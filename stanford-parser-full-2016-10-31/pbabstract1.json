    "0": "High-end analytical methods provide excellent data but may lack the robustness required in large analytical studies. In particular complex chemical matrices may cause difficulties and increase the need for extensive sample preparation. For screening of patients we thus developed a low-tech assay to monitor bradykinin degradation by serum proteases. The bradykinin concentration mirrors the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Dabsylated bradykinin (DBK) and its labeled fragments DBK1-8 and DBK1-5 were visualized by thin-layer chromatography using only 3\u03bcL of serum. Lower DBK1-5 levels indicated reduced ACE activity due to medication (ACE-inhibitors) or disease. Provided that purified DBK is available, the assay protocol itself is very simple and does not require any expensive high-end equipment.", 
    "1": "Factors predisposing the older person with acute myocardial infarction (MI) to develop heart failure (HF) include an increased prevalence of MI, multivessel coronary artery disease, decreased left ventricular (LV) contractile reserve, impairment of LV diastolic relaxation, increased hypertension, LV hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus, valvular heart disease, and renal insufficiency. HF associated with acute MI should be treated with a loop diuretic. The use of nitrates, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, beta-blockers, digoxin, and positive inotropic drugs; treatment of arrhythmias and mechanical complications; and indications for use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization is discussed.", 
    "2": "Heart failure (HF) with abnormal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction should be identified and treated. Treat hypertension with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and \u03b2-blockers. Treat myocardial ischemia with nitrates and \u03b2-blockers. Treat volume overload and HF with diuretics. Treat HF with ACE inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers. Sacubitril/valsartan may be used instead of an ACE inhibitor or ARB in chronic symptomatic HF and abnormal LV ejection fraction. Add isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine in African Americans with class II to IV HF treated with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and \u03b2-blockers. Exercise training is recommended. Indications for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy are discussed.", 
    "3": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of arterial hypertension as well as in more complex mechanisms of cardiovascular and renal diseases. RAAS-blocking agents like angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, have long been key components in the treatment of essential hypertension, heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and chronic kidney disease, showing benefits well beyond blood pressure reduction. Renin blockade as the first step of the RAAS cascade finally became possible in 2007 with the approval of aliskiren, the first orally active direct renin inhibitor available for clinical use and the newest antihypertensive agent on the market. In the last decade, many clinical trials and meta-analyses have been conducted concerning the efficacy and safety of aliskiren in comparison to other antihypertensive agents, as well as the efficacy and potential clinical use of various combinations. Large trials with cardiovascular and renal endpoints attempted to show potential benefits of aliskiren beyond blood pressure lowering, as well as morbidity and mortality outcomes in specific populations such as diabetics, heart failure patients, and post-myocardial infarction individuals. The purpose of this review is to present the currently available data regarding established and future potential clinical uses of aliskiren.", 
    "4": "This study was designed to investigate the impact of renin-angiotensin system blockade (RASB) therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers on the outcomes of coronary artery ectasia (CAE).", 
    "5": "The CAE patients identified by coronary angiography from our center were consecutively enrolled. We obtained the baseline discharge prescription of RASB from medical records system and conducted follow-up through telephone interviews. Cox regression models, propensity score and subgroup analysis were used to assess the impact of RASB on all-cause mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction. Both the unadjusted and adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by RASB therapy were plotted.", 
    "6": "There were 595 patients with CAE in total and 333 (56.0%) were prescribed RASB therapy. Over a 2-year follow-up time, 16 all-cause deaths and 10 non-fatal myocardial infarctions were identified. Those patients treated with RASB had a significantly lower all-cause mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction rate with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.32 (95% confidence interval: 0.13 to 0.77, P\u2009=\u20090.011). The outcome benefits of RASB therapy were further confirmed in the propensity score analysis and subgroup analysis.", 
    "7": "This observational study suggests that RASB therapy is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients with CAE.", 
    "8": "The prescription of optimal medical therapy for heart failure is often delayed despite compelling evidence of a reduction in mortality. We calculated the absolute risk resulting from delayed prescription of therapy. For comparison, we established the threshold applied by clinicians when discussing the risk for death associated with an intervention, and the threshold used in official patient information leaflets.", 
    "9": "We undertook a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to calculate the excess mortality caused by deferral of medical therapy for 1\u2009year. Risk ratios for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists were 0.80, 0.73 and 0.77, respectively. In patients who might achieve a 1-year survival rate of 90% if treated, a 1-year deferral of treatment reduced survival to 78% (i.e. an annual absolute increase in mortality of 12 in 100 patients). This corresponds to an additional absolute mortality risk per month of 1%. A survey of clinicians carried out to establish the risk threshold at which they would obtain written consent showed the majority (85%) sought written consent for interventions associated with a 12-fold lower mortality risk: one in 100 patients. A systematic review of UK patient information leaflets to establish the magnitude of risk considered sufficient to be stated explicitly showed that leaflets begin to mention death at a \u223c18\u2009000-fold lower mortality risk of just 0.0007 in 100 patients.", 
    "10": "Deferring heart failure treatment for 1\u2009year carries far greater risk than the level at which most doctors seek written consent, and 18\u2009000 times more risk than the level at which patient information leaflets begin to mention death.", 
    "11": "Radiation-induced lung injuries mainly include the (acute or sub-acute) radiation pneumonitis, the lung fibrosis and the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The present review aims at describing the diagnostic process, the current physiopathological knowledge, and the available (non dosimetric) preventive and curative treatments. Radiation-induced lung injury is a diagnosis of exclusion, since clinical, radiological, or biological pathognomonic evidences do not exist. Investigations should necessarily include a thoracic high resolution CT-scan and lung function tests with a diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. No treatment ever really showed efficacy to prevent acute radiation-induced lung injury, or to treat radiation-induced lung fibrosis. The most promising drugs in order to prevent radiation-induced lung injury are amifostine, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and pentoxifylline. Inhibitors of collagen synthesis are currently tested at a pre-clinical stage to limit the radiation-induced lung fibrosis. Regarding available treatments of radiation-induced pneumonitis, corticoids can be considered the cornerstone. However, no standardized program or guidelines concerning the initial dose and the gradual tapering have been scientifically established. Alternative treatments can be prescribed, based on clinical cases reporting on the efficacy of immunosuppressive drugs. Such data highlight the major role of the lung dosimetric protection in order to efficiently prevent radiation-induced lung injury.",

    "14": "In this prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 96 HT recipients were randomized to undergo ramipril or placebo therapy. They underwent coronary angiography, endothelial function testing; measurements of fractional flow reserve (FFR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR) and the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR); and intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) of the left anterior descending coronary artery, within 8 weeks of HT. At 1 year, the invasive assessment was repeated. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were quantified at baseline and 1 year.",

Patients receiving ramipril had improvement in microvascular function as shown by a significant decrease in IMR (21.4 \u00b1 14.7 to 14.4 \u00b1 6.3; p\u00a0= 0.001) and increase in CFR (3.8 \u00b1 1.7 to 4.8 \u00b1 1.5; p\u00a0= 0.017), from baseline to 1 year. This did not occur with IMR (17.4 \u00b1 8.4 to 21.5 \u00b1 20.0; p\u00a0= 0.72) or CFR (4.1 \u00b1 1.8 to 4.1 \u00b1 2.2; p\u00a0= 0.60) in the placebo-treated patients. EPCs decreased significantly at 1 year in the placebo group but not in the ramipril group.",

    "18": "The BleeMACS project is a multicentre observational registry enrolling patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention worldwide in 15 hospitals. The primary endpoint was a composite event of death and re-infarction after one year of follow-up. Bleedings were the secondary endpoint. 15,401 patients were enrolled, 926 (6.4%) in the cancer group and 14,475 (93.6%) in the group of patients without cancer. Patients with cancer were older (70.8\u00b110.3 vs. 62.8\u00b112.1 years, P<0.001) with more severe comorbidities and presented more frequently with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction compared with patients without cancer. After one year, patients with cancer more often experienced the composite endpoint (15.2% vs. 5.3%, P<0.001) and bleedings (6.5% vs. 3%, P<0.001). At multiple regression analysis the presence of cancer was the strongest independent predictor for the primary endpoint (hazard ratio (HR) 2.1, 1.8-2.5, P<0.001) and bleedings (HR 1.5, 1.1-2.1, P=0.015). Despite patients with cancer generally being undertreated, beta-blockers (relative risk (RR) 0.6, 0.4-0.9, P=0.05), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (RR 0.5, 0.3-0.8, P=0.02), statins (RR 0.3, 0.2-0.5, P<0.001) and dual antiplatelet therapy (RR 0.5, 0.3-0.9, P=0.05) were shown to be protective factors, while proton pump inhibitors (RR 1, 0.6-1.5, P=0.9) were neutral.",

Moreover, these patients are often undertreated from clinical despite medical therapy seems to be protective. Registration:The BleeMACS project (NCT02466854).", 
    "20": "The novel combination sacubitril/valsartan represents a new therapeutic approach in the management of heart failure. With the simultaneous blockage of the enzyme neprilysin (by sacubitril) and angiotensin II receptors (by valsartan), this combination reduces the degradation of natriuretic peptides and other counterregulatory peptide systems while avoiding the deleterious effect of angiotensin II receptors activation and thereby encompasses a beneficial impact of 2 important neurohormonal pathways activated in heart failure. As opposed to previously tested neprilysin inhibitors, sacubitril/valsartan represents a more effective method in reducing morbidity and mortality in heart failure, while preserving a safety profile comparable to well-established, standard, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor's therapy."
