    "0": "Myocardial dysfunction and heart failure are common in pediatric patients with congenital and acquired heart disease. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) has been suggested as a biomarker for myocardial dysfunction after Fontan operation. We hypothesized that pediatric patients with myocardial dysfunction requiring orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) have diminished AP compared to normal. A retrospective review was performed in all patients who underwent OHT at Arkansas Children's Hospital between January 2007 and October 2012. Anatomic diagnoses, therapeutic interventions, and ventricular ejection fraction (EF) were recorded. Z scores for AP levels in the study group were determined by comparing the observed AP levels to age- and gender-matched normative values. T tests were performed to compare the mean AP Z score prior to and after OHT. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. During the study period, 124 OHTs were performed. Complete study data were available and analyzed from 71/124 patients (mean age at OHT 3.9 years; 51% female). The mean AP Z score was significantly lower in the study group prior to OHT compared to normal (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy prior to OHT was associated with a significant increase in AP and the ventricular EF (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for both). Treatment with milrinone was associated with an increase in EF. AP is significantly lower in pediatric patients with myocardial dysfunction prior to OHT compared to normal. AP increases significantly after the initiation of therapies to improve myocardial function. Diminished AP is an indicator of myocardial dysfunction in pediatric patients.", 
    "1": "A novel nanomaterial-based voltammetric sensor has been developed for use a highly sensitive tool for the simultaneous determination of captopril (CA), acetaminophen (AC), tyrosine (TY) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The device is based on the application of NiO/CNTs and (2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione) (DPID) to modify carbon paste electrodes. The NiO/CNTs nanocomposite was synthesized through a direct chemical precipitation approach and was characterized with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The NiO/CNTs/DPID/CPEs were found to facilitate the analysis of CA, AC, TY and HCTZ in the concentration ranges of 0.07-200.0, 0.8-550.0, 5.0-750.0 and 10.0-600.0\u03bcM with the respective detection limits of 9.0nM, 0.3\u03bcM, 1.0\u03bcM and 5.0\u03bcM. The developed NiO/CNTs/DPID/CPEs were used for the determination of the mentioned analytes in pharmaceutical and biological real samples.",

This study aimed to evaluate patient characteristics and interventions during hospitalization associated with the development of AKI in patients continued on renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers during hospitalization.", 
    "3": "A retrospective study of 184 adult patients admitted between January 2012 and September 2014 and continued on RAS blockers was conducted. Risk factors for AKI were compared between AKI (n = 92) and non-AKI (n = 92) groups.", 
    "4": "Patients who developed hospital-acquired AKI had a higher baseline serum creatinine (1.2 \u00b1 0.4 versus 1 \u00b1 0.3mg/dL, P < 0.001) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (54 \u00b1 10 versus 57 \u00b1 7mL/minute/1.73m(2), P = 0.03) compared with patients who did not develop AKI. Patients who developed AKI were also more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit, have surgical procedures, have hypotension and be prescribed loop diuretics. The presence of chronic kidney disease and hypotension were risk factors associated with AKI development. In addition, the AKI group had a significantly longer length of stay (14 days versus 8 days, P < 0.0001) and had a higher rate of all-cause hospital mortality (9% versus 1%, P = 0.03).", 
    "5": "Patients with chronic kidney disease, hypotension and those undergoing surgeries were more likely to develop AKI while receiving RAS blockers. During hospitalization, temporary discontinuation of these medications may be warranted in patients with these characteristics.",

AR-42 is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) developed at The Ohio State University that inhibits the proliferation of several cancers, including multiple myeloma, lung, and hepatocellular cancer. In this study, we investigated whether AR-42 would prevent or decrease. The growth and metastasis of a canine PCa (Ace-1 cells) to bone in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "7": "Proliferation, cell viability, invasion, and metastasis of a canine prostate cancer cell line (Ace-1) were measured following treatment with AR-42. Expression of anoikis resistance, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and stem cell-related markers were also evaluated. To assess the efficacy of AR-42 on prevention of PCa metastasis to bone, Ace-1 cells were injected in the left cardiac ventricle of nude mice, mice were treated with AR-42, and the incidence and growth of bone metastasis were measured. Bioluminescence was performed to monitor the bone metastases in nude mice.", 
    "8": "AR-42 inhibited the in vitro proliferation of Ace-1 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The IC50 concentration of AR-42 for Ace-1 cells was 0.42\u2009\u03bcM after 24\u2009hr of treatment. AR-42 induced apoptosis, decreased cell migration, and increased the stem cell properties of Ace-1 cells in vitro. AR-42 downregulated E-cadherin, N-cadherin, TWIST, MYOF, anoikis resistance, and osteomimicry genes, while it upregulated SNAIL, PTEN, FAK, and ZEB1 gene expression in Ace-1 cells. Importantly, AR-42 decreased the bioluminescence and incidence of bone metastasis in nude mice. In addition, AR-42 induced apoptosis and altered the tumor cell morphology to an irregular cell phenotype with condensed chromatin in the bone metastases.",

    "10": "Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 5% to 10% of all patients with myocardial infarction. Clinical trials of secondary prevention treatment in MINOCA patients are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between treatment with statins, renin-angiotensin system blockers, \u03b2-blockers, dual antiplatelet therapy, and long-term cardiovascular events.", 
    "11": "This is an observational study of MINOCA patients recorded in the SWEDEHEART registry (the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapy) between July 2003 and June 2013 and followed until December 2013 for outcome events in the Swedish Cause of Death Register and National Patient Register. Of 199\u2009162 myocardial infarction admissions, 9466 consecutive unique patients with MINOCA were identified. Among those, the 9136 patients surviving the first 30 days after discharge constituted the study population. Mean age was 65.3 years, and 61% were women. No patient was lost to follow-up. A stratified propensity score analysis was performed to match treated and untreated groups. The association between treatment and outcome was estimated by comparing between treated and untreated groups by using Cox proportional hazards models. The exposures were treatment at discharge with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events defined as all-cause mortality, hospitalization for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and heart failure.", 
    "12": "At discharge, 84.5%, 64.1%, 83.4%, and 66.4% of the patients were on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy, respectively. During the follow-up of a mean of 4.1 years, 2183 (23.9%) patients experienced a major adverse cardiac event. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for major adverse cardiac events were 0.77 (0.68-0.87), 0.82 (0.73-0.93), and 0.86 (0.74-1.01) in patients on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and \u03b2-blockers, respectively. For patients on dual antiplatelet therapy followed for 1 year, the hazard ratio was 0.90 (0.74-1.08).", 
    "13": "The results indicate long-term beneficial effects of treatment with statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers on outcome in patients with MINOCA, a trend toward a positive effect of \u03b2-blocker treatment, and a neutral effect of dual antiplatelet therapy. Properly powered randomized clinical trials to confirm these results are warranted.", 
    "14": "Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a potent endogenous inhibitor of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis, widely studied as a target in drug development for treating cancer. Several studies performed in the cardiovascular field on TSP-1 are contradictory, the role of TSP-1 in the physiopathology of cardiovascular disorders (CVDs) being, for the moment, incompletely understood and may be due to the presence of several domains in its structure which can stimulate many cellular receptors. It has been reported to inhibit NO-mediated signaling and to act on the angiogenesis, tissue perfusion, endothelial cell proliferation, and homeostasis, so we aimed to quantify the effect Perindopril has on TSP-1 plasma levels in hypertensive patients with endothelial dysfunction in comparison with other antihypertensive drugs, such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics, in a chronic treatment. As a conclusion, patients under treatment with Perindopril had increased plasma levels of TSP-1 compared with other hypertensive patients and with the control group. The results of this study confirms the pleiotropic properties of Perindopril: anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, with effects showed by quantifying a single biomarker: TSP-1.", 
    "15": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have become standards of care for diabetic nephropathy. The authors assessed the association between treatment adherence to ACEIs and ARBs and the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The cohort comprised the 9895 members of the Central District of Clalit Health Services aged 40 to 70\u00a0years, diagnosed with diabetes before 2002, who filled at least four ACEI or ARB monthly prescriptions during 2002-2011. Forty-six percent of patients made 10 or more purchases a year. Hazard ratios for ESRD development and death decreased as adherence increased, with no evidence of a cutoff threshold or plateau. For both outcomes, hazard ratios were significantly lower among patients who purchased at least 10 monthly prescriptions (83% adherence), after adjusting for age, sex, and a number of clinically relevant factors. While ACEIs/ARBs have become standards of care in diabetes, treatment adherence is essential to achieve full benefit.",

    "19": "A total of 7009 prevalent hemodialysis patients were enrolled. Fifty-five percent of the patients had their hemoglobin levels within the target values. In those with a hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL to 10 g/dL, an erythropoietin dose of 10000 IU/wk to 12000 IU/wk led to a significant increase in hemoglobin level. A mean erythropoietin dose of 7700 IU/wk was effective in maintaining the target hemoglobin of 10 g/dL to 12 g/dL during a 3-month follow-up period. Improvement in hemoglobin level was associated with male sex, diabetes mellitus, and hemodialysis adequacy, and its deterioration with lower parathyroid hormone, calcium-phosphorus product, and creatinine levels; malnutrition; transfusion; and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (R2 = 29.1%, P < .001). A dosage of 66.5 IU/kg/wk led to 1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin in anemic patients.", 
    "20": "Data suggested that an estimated erythropoietin dose of 66.5 IU/kg/wk for each 1 g/dL hemoglobin level below the target could be used as a guide for prescription. A dosage of about 8000 IU/wk could help maintaining hemoglobin within the target. A longitudinal study is needed to estimate the required erythropoietin dose.", 
    "21": "Angiogenesis is implicated in formation of gastrointestinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Angiotensin II signaling is involved in angiogenesis through the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2 pathways.

Of 100 patients who received ACEI or ARB therapy, 24 experienced GIB (24%), with 9 caused by AVMs (9%). Logistic regression hazards model demonstrated that ACEI or ARB therapy was independently associated with a reduced risk for all-cause GIB (odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.72) and AVM-related GIB (odds ratio 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.71).",
