The electrode configuration was determined before randomization. One thousand and sixty-seven patients eventually received an ICD, 516 (48.4%) with a SC- and 551 (51.6%) with a DC-electrode. DC-electrodes were preferentially selected in older patients, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, dual chamber, Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) devices, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin (AT) receptor blockers and without Sotalol. However, the preference of the investigational site was dominant over clinical parameters. The DF energy at the final electrode position was higher in SC-electrodes (adjusted difference\u2009+1.15 J; P\u2009=\u20090.005; only patients tested). Less patients with DC-electrodes required intra-operative system reconfiguration (adjusted difference -3.9; P\u2009=\u20090.046; only patients tested). Using mixed logistic regression, the FSE was 92.6% in SC- and 97.8% in DC-electrodes (adjusted odds ratio 4.3 (95% confidence interval [1.9, 9.8]; P\u2009<\u20090.001)).",

    "11": "Drugs that target the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) have recently come into focus for their potential utility as cancer treatments. The use of Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors (ACEIs) to manage hypertension in cancer patients is correlated with improved survival outcomes for renal, prostate, breast and small cell lung cancer. Previous studies demonstrate that the Angiotensin Receptor Type I (AT1R) is linked to breast cancer pathogenesis, with unbiased analysis of gene-expression studies identifying significant up-regulation of AGTR1, the gene encoding AT1R in ER+ve/HER2-ve tumors correlating with poor prognosis. However, there is no evidence, so far, of the functional contribution of AT1R to breast tumorigenesis. We explored the potential therapeutic benefit of ARB in a carcinogen-induced mouse model of breast cancer and clarified the mechanisms associated with its success.Mammary tumors were induced with 7,12-dimethylbenz[\u03b1]antracene (DMBA) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in female wild type mice and the effects of the ARB, Losartan treatment assessed in a preventative setting (n = 15 per group). Tumor histopathology was characterised by immunohistochemistry, real-time qPCR to detect gene expression signatures, and tumor cytokine levels measured with quantitative bioplex assays. AT1R was detected with radiolabelled ligand binding assays in fresh frozen tumor samples.We showed that therapeutic inhibition of AT1R, with Losartan, resulted in a significant reduction in tumor burden; and no mammary tumor incidence in 20% of animals. We observed a significant reduction in tumor progression from DCIS to invasive cancer with Losartan treatment. This was associated with reduced tumor cell proliferation and a significant reduction in IL-6, pSTAT3 and TNF\u03b1 levels. Analysis of tumor immune cell infiltrates, however, demonstrated no significant differences in the recruitment of lymphocytes or tumour-associated macrophages in Losartan or vehicle-treated mammary tumors.Analysis of AT1R expression with radiolabelled ligand binding assays in human breast cancer biopsies showed high AT1R levels in 30% of invasive ductal carcinomas analysed. Furthermore, analysis of the TCGA database identified that high AT1R expression to be associated with luminal breast cancer subtype.Our in vivo data and analysis of human invasive ductal carcinoma samples identify the AT1R is a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer, with the availability of a range of well-tolerated inhibitors currently used in clinics. We describe a novel signalling pathway critical in breast tumorigenesis, that may provide new therapeutic avenues to complement current treatments.",

Methods CENTRAL, EMBASE, Ovid-MEDLINE, PubMed, and CNKI were searched for relevant, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). A meta-analysis was performed to review the effect of PTF plus ACEIs/ARBs vs. ACEIs/ARBs alone on proteinuria and kidney function in CKD. Results Eleven RCTs including 705 patients were retrieved. PTF plus ACEI/ARB treatment significantly decreased proteinuria in patients with CKD within 6 months (standard mean difference [SMD] -0.52; 95% CI -0.90 to 0.15; I(2\u2009)=\u200968%) and significantly attenuated a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with stages 3-5 CKD after 6 months of treatment (standard mean difference [SMD] 0.30; confidence limit [Cl] 95% CI 0.06 to 0.54; I(2\u2009)=\u20090%). PTF plus ACEIs/ARBs for 9 to 12 months significantly reduced albuminuria in patients with CKD (SMD-0.30, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.03; I(2\u2009)=\u20090%) and alleviated the decline in eGFR in patients with stages 3-5 CKD (SMD 0.51; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.96; I(2\u2009)=\u200961%). Conclusion The combination of an ACEI or ARB and PTF has a protective effect in reducing proteinuria by ameliorating the decline in eGFR in patients with stages 3-5 CKD.", 
    "13": "Numerous studies have reported that high-dose statin loading therapy prior to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) improves the clinical outcomes of patients following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, little is known about the effects of long-term statin use prior to PPCI on such outcomes. Therefore, the aim of the present analysis was to clarify the effects of long-term statin use before PPCI on the treatment outcomes of patients following AMI. The records of 213 patients who had AMI and met the inclusion criteria were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: A control group (n=178) who had received no statin pretreatment before AMI onset, and a statin group (n=35) who had received statin treatment for \u22651 month before AMI onset. All patients received a standard treatment regimen for the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease after PPCI. Baseline clinical variables, details of the PPCI procedure and clinical outcomes within 3 months after treatment were reviewed. Patients in the statin group were significantly older than those in the control group (P=0.003). Compared with the control group, there was a greater proportion of patients with hyperlipidemia and previous angina pectoris in the statin group. There were no differences in the use of other drugs (aspirin, \u03b2-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) prior to PPCI between the two groups. The corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC) was significantly lower in the statin group than in the control group (24.1\u00b112.8 vs. 29.4\u00b114.3, respectively; P=0.043). Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that long-term statin use before AMI was a significant predictor of cTFC after PPCI (P=0.012). Furthermore, the incidence of major adverse cardiac events within 3 months after PPCI was higher in the control group than in the statin group (16.8 vs. 2.9%, respectively; P=0.032). Logistic regression analysis showed that previous statin use was associated with the incidence of major adverse cardiac events within 3 months after treatment (P=0.012). The results of the present study demonstrate that long-term statin use prior to PPCI improved treatment outcomes after AMI in actual clinical practice.", 
    "14": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a progressive segmental abdominal aortic dilation, is associated with high mortality. AAA is characterized by inflammation, smooth muscle cell (SMC) depletion and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Surgical intervention and endovascular therapy are recommended to prevent rupture of large AAAs. Unfortunately, there is no reliable pharmacological agent available to limit AAA expansion. In the past decades, extensive investigations and a body of ongoing clinical trials aimed at defining potent treatments to inhibit and even regress AAA growth. In this review, we summarized recent progress of potential strategies, particularly macrolides, tetracyclines, statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blocker, corticosteroid, anti-platelet drugs and mast cell stabilizers. We also consider recently identified novel molecular targets, which have potential to be translated into clinical practice in the future.",

The prevalence of hypertension in the US varies across race/ethnicity with African Americans having the highest prevalence and overall less control among racial/ethnic minorities compared with non-Hispanic whites. Therapeutic lifestyle modifications are the bedrock of essential hypertension control, but most patients with hypertension will require pharmacotherapy, usually with multiple medications often in combination. Overall, the principal drug classes recommended as initial pharmacotherapy are thiazide-type diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.",

    "20": "Background The development and use of minimally invasive procedures provide improved options for the management of symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency. While many patients with iliac venous occlusive disease and superficial venous insufficiency improve with combined iliac venous stenting and correction of superficial venous reflux, some patients have symptoms which persist. The goal of this study was to identify clinical factors related to persistent symptoms in patients with leg swelling after treatment of both iliac vein stenting and thermal ablation. Methods This observational study analyzed data for patients who underwent both iliac vein stent placement as well as endovenous ablation (either RFA or EVLT) as a management for chronic venous insufficiency between February 2012 and February 2014. Follow-up was performed after completion of both procedures and inquiring for improvement of swelling. Statistical analysis performed using Chi-square and student's t-test. Results Of the total 173 patients who underwent both endovenous closure and iliac vein stent placements, 55 (31.8%) patients were men; 29 (16%) patients stated they had no improvement after these procedures. The average age of patients who did not improve was 68.8 (\u00b116.7 SD) years and 66.2 (\u00b113.3 SD) years for patients who improved. Over all, the classification of the presenting symptoms by CEAP classification demonstrated 25.4%, 53.2%, 5.8%, and 15.6%, for C3-C6, respectively. There was no correlation with failure to improve the swelling with: age ( P\u2009=\u2009.44), gender ( P\u2009=\u2009.33), presenting symptom ( P\u2009=\u2009.67), use of calcium channel blockers ( P\u2009=\u2009.85), nitroglycerin ( P\u2009=\u2009.86), Plavix ( P\u2009=\u2009.07), aspirin ( P\u2009=\u2009.55), Synthyroid ( P\u2009=\u2009.55), Coumadin ( P\u2009=\u2009.14), angiotensin receptor blocker ( P\u2009=\u2009.81), \u03b2 Blockers ( P\u2009=\u2009.61), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( P\u2009=\u2009.88), furosemide 40\u2009mg ( P\u2009=\u2009.74), hydrochlorothiazide 12.5\u2009mg ( P\u2009=\u2009.07), hydrochlorothiazide 25\u2009mg ( P\u2009=\u2009.48), and EVLT vs. RFA ( P\u2009=\u2009.91). The use of furosemide (20\u2009mg) was associated with continued swelling ( P\u2009=\u2009.01). The use of dual diuretics (furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide) was associated with persistent swelling even after these combined endovenous procedures P\u2009=\u2009.03). Conclusion These preliminary data suggest that the treatment with diuretics may be associated with failure to relieve lower extremity swelling despite combined endovascular therapy for chronic venous insufficiency.",

Blueberry leaves are byproducts of the blueberry industry, which are rich in bioactive phenolics, such as quercetin (Q), hyperin (H), and chlorogenic acid (C). This study investigated protective effects of 3 phenolics (Q, H, and C) from leaves of rabbiteye blueberry Vaccinium ashei on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The results showed that all these 3 phenolics could improve endothelial function by inhibiting oxidative damage and proinflammatory cytokines caused by tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). The cell vitalities of endothelial cells pretreated with Q, H, and C were higher than those stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 only. These phenolics could decrease reactive oxygen species and xanthine oxidase-1 levels and increase superoxide dismutase and heme oxygenase-1 levels in endothelial cells. They also could decrease the protein expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 induced by TNF-\u03b1. In addition, Q, H, and C also exhibited vasodilatory effect by reducing the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) protein levels in endothelial cells. Mostly 3 phenolics exhibited bioactivities as a function of concentration, but the effects not always depended on the concentration. The antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects of Q seemed to be more pronounced than H; however, H exhibited higher cell vitalities. The results indicated that phenolics from rabbiteye blueberry leaves could be potential antioxidants, inflammation and ACE inhibitors, and rabbiteye blueberry leaves provide a new resources of phytochemicals beneficial for cardiovascular health.",

During the study period, there were 10 kidney transplant recipients, all of whom were Caucasian females. Seven of them were living-donor kidney transplant recipients, and the mean age at time of transplant was 56.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.99 years. The mean post-transplant follow-up was 76.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a056.18 months; the mean dialysis vintage was 46.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a080.35 months, ranging from 8 to 272\u00a0months; and the mean serum creatinine (Cr) levels at 3, 6, and 12 months were 1.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.47 mg/dL, 1.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.51 mg/dL, and 1.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.49 mg/dL, respectively. There were 5 graft failures with median graft survival of 101\u00a0months. None had recurrence of scleroderma renal crisis. In those without graft failure, the mean serum Cr at last follow-up was 0.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39 mg/dL. Six patients were on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) after transplant. In univariate analysis, none of the factors including, age at time of transplant, dialysis vintage, use of ACE-I, living-donor transplant, cytomegalovirus infection, and serum\u00a0Cr at 1\u00a0year were predictive of graft failure. In our study, we hoped to find outcomes and various factors associated with graft failure in these patients. We found a wide variation in outcomes after kidney transplantation. More studies are needed to assess the factors that may influence the graft survival in this rare disease.\u2029."
