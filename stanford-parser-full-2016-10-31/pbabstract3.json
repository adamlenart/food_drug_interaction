    "0": "Aldosterone breakthrough (ABT) is the condition in which angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers fail to effectively suppress the activity of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system. The objective of this study was to determine if ABT occurs in dogs with naturally occurring myxomatous mitral valve disease\u00a0receiving an ACEI, using the urine aldosterone to creatinine ratio (UAldo:C) as a measure of renin angiotensin aldosterone system activation.", 
    "1": "This study includes 39\u00a0dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease. A UAldo:C cut-off definition (derived from a normal population of healthy, adult, and client-owned dogs) was used to determine the prevalence of ABT in this population. Spearman analysis and univariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the relationship between UAldo:C and ABT (yes/no) and eight variables (age, serum K(+) concentration, serum creatinine concentration, ACEI therapy duration and ACEI dosage, furosemide therapy duration and furosemide dosage, and urine sample storage time). Finally, the UAldo:C in dogs receiving spironolactone, as part congestive heart failure (CHF) therapy, was compared to dogs with CHF that were not receiving spironolactone.", 
    "2": "The prevalence of ABT was 32% in dogs with CHF and 30% in dogs without CHF. There was no relationship between either the UAldo:C or the likelihood of ABT and the eight variables. Therapy with spironolactone lead to a significant elevation of the UAldo:C.", 
    "3": "Using the UAldo:C and a relatively stringent definition of ABT, it appears that incomplete RAAS blockade is common in dogs with MMVD receiving an ACEI. The prevalence of ABT in this canine population mirrors that reported in humans. While the mechanism of ABT is likely multifactorial and still poorly understood, the proven existence of ABT in dogs offers the potential to improve the prognosis for MMVD with the addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor blocker to current therapeutic regimens.", 
    "4": "Approximately 30% of dogs being treated for heart disease and CHF satisfied the definition of ABT. Identifying patient subpopulations experiencing ABT may help guide future study design and clinical decision-making.", 
    "5": "The commercially available synthetic angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to exert negative side effects which have driven many research groups globally to discover the novel ACE inhibitors.", 
    "6": "Literature search was performed within the PubMed, ScienceDirect.com and Google Scholar.", 
    "7": "The presence of proline at the C-terminal tripeptide of ACE inhibitor can competitively inhibit the ACE activity. The effects of other amino acids are less studied leading to difficulties in predicting potent peptide sequences. The broad specificity of the enzyme may be due to the dual active sites observed on the somatic ACE. The inhibitors may not necessarily competitively inhibit the enzyme which explains why some reported inhibitors do not have the common ACE inhibitor characteristics. Finally, the in vivo assay has to be carried out before the peptides as the antihypertensive agents can be claimed. The peptides must be absorbed into circulation without being degraded, which will affect their bioavailability and potency. Thus, peptides with strong in vitro IC50 values do not necessarily have the same effect in vivo and vice versa.", 
    "8": "The relationship between peptide amino acid sequence and inhibitory activity, in vivo studies of the active peptides and bioavailability must be studied before the peptides as antihypertensive agents can be claimed.", 
    "9": "A collective century of discoveries establishes the importance of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system in maintaining blood pressure, fluid volume and electrolyte homeostasis via autocrine, paracrine and endocrine signaling. While research continues to yield new functions of angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7), the gap between basic research and clinical application of these new findings is widening. As data accumulates on the efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers as drugs of fundamental importance in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal disorders, it is becoming apparent that the achieved clinical benefits is suboptimal and surprisingly no different than what can be achieved with other therapeutic interventions. We discuss this issue and summarize new pathways and mechanisms effecting the synthesis and actions of angiotensin II. The presence of renin-independent non-canonical pathways for angiotensin II production are largely unaffected by agents inhibiting renin angiotensin system activity. Hence, new efforts should be directed to develop drugs that can effectively block the synthesis and/or action of intracellular angiotensin II. Improved drug penetration into cardiac or renal sites of disease, inhibiting chymase the primary angiotensin II forming enzyme in the human heart, and/or inhibiting angiotensinogen synthesis would all be more effective strategies to inhibit the system. Additionally, given the role of angiotensin II in the maintenance of renal homeostatic mechanisms, any new inhibitor should possess greater selectivity of targeting pathogenic angiotensin II signaling processes and thereby limit inappropriate inhibition.", 
    "10": "Screening echocardiograms are not indicated. Our aim is to evaluate the impact of screening echocardiograms on improving clinical management among older adults.", 
    "11": "We performed screening echocardiograms for all consecutive patients and defined incident systolic heart failure (HF) as an ejection fraction of less than 50% among patients without a previous HF diagnosis. We reviewed medical record data to determine if the new cases where Stage B or C. We obtained prescribed medications and vital signs from the electronic health record to determine absolute changes before and after the echocardiogram.", 
    "12": "We performed an echocardiogram in 6,417 patients with a mean age of 71.4\u00b16. The echocardiogram identified 292 seniors with new cases of systolic HF (5.34%; 95% CI: 4.7-5.9) and 239 were stage B HF. The increase in the use of ace-inhibitor, beta blocker when comparing the pre and post echocardiogram periods was highest in those with Stage C and those with ejection fraction lower than 40%. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased from 140\u00b119 to 136\u00b115 (P<0.01) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) from 105\u00b136 to 97\u00b133 (P<0.01).", 
    "13": "Performing echocardiograms in senior-focused value-based primary care improves evidence-based cardiovascular treatment and short-term clinical outcomes, including lowering SBP and LDL.", 
    "14": "The burden of heart failure has increased in Korea. This registry aims to evaluate demographics, clinical characteristics, management, and long-term outcomes in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure (AHF).", 
    "15": "We prospectively enrolled a total of 5625 consecutive subjects hospitalized for AHF in one of 10 tertiary university hospitals from March 2011 to February 2014. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the baseline characteristics of the study population and to compare them with those from other registries.", 
    "16": "The mean age was 68.5\u00b114.5 years, 53.2% were male, and 52.2% had de novo heart failure. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 131.2\u00b130.3 mmHg and 78.6\u00b118.8 mmHg at admission, respectively. The left ventricular ejection fraction was \u226440% in 60.5% of patients. Ischemia was the most frequent etiology (37.6%) and aggravating factor (26.3%). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists were prescribed in 68.8%, 52.2%, and 46.6% of the patients at discharge, respectively. Compared with the previous registry performed in Korea a decade ago, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and heart transplantation have been performed more frequently (ECMO 0.8% vs. 2.8%, heart transplantation 0.3% vs. 1.2%), and in-hospital mortality decreased from 7.6% to 4.8%. However, the total cost of hospital care increased by 40%, and one-year follow-up mortality remained high.", 
    "17": "While the quality of acute clinical care and AHF-related outcomes have improved over the last decade, the long-term prognosis of heart failure is still poor in Korea. Therefore, additional research is needed to improve long-term outcomes and implement cost-effective care.", 
    "18": "Recent work has renewed interest in therapies targeting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to improve \u03b2-cell function in type 2 diabetes. Studies show that generation of angiotensin-(1-7) by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its binding to the Mas receptor (MasR) improves glucose homeostasis, partly by enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Thus, islet ACE2 upregulation is viewed as a desirable therapeutic goal. Here, we show that although endogenous islet ACE2 expression is sparse, its inhibition abrogates angiotensin-(1-7)-mediated GSIS. However, a more widely expressed islet peptidase, neprilysin, degrades angiotensin-(1-7) into several peptides. In neprilysin-deficient mouse islets, angiotensin-(1-7) and neprilysin-derived degradation products, angiotensin-(1-4), -(5-7) and -(3-4), failed to enhance GSIS. Conversely, angiotensin-(1-2) enhanced GSIS in both neprilysin-deficient and wild-type islets. Rather than mediating this effect via activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), MasR, angiotensin-(1-2) was found to signal via another GPCR, namely GPCR family C group 6 member A (GPRC6A). In conclusion, in islets, intact angiotensin-(1-7) is not the primary mediator of beneficial effects ascribed to the ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/MasR axis. Our findings warrant caution for concurrent use of angiotensin-(1-7) compounds and neprilysin inhibitors as therapies for diabetes.", 
    "19": "Salt-sensitivity (SS) refers to changes in blood pressure in response to changes in sodium intake. SS individuals are at greater risk for developing kidney disease, and also respond differently to antihypertensive therapies compared to salt-resistant (SR) individuals. In this study we used a systems pharmacology model of renal function (presented in a companion article) to evaluate the ability of proposed mechanisms to produce salt-sensitivity. The model reproduced previously published data on renal functional changes in response to salt-intake, and also predicted that glomerular pressure, a variable that is not easily evaluated clinically but is a key factor in renal injury, increases with salt intake in SS hypertension. We then used the model to generate mechanistic insight into the differential blood pressure and glomerular pressure responses to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers observed in SS and SR hypertension.", 
    "20": "A wealth of evidence has shown that opioid and kinin systems may control proximal defense in the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (dPAG), a critical panic-associated area. Studies with drugs that interfere with serotonin-mediated neurotransmission suggest that the \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR) synergistically interacts with the 5-HT1A receptor in the dPAG to inhibit escape, a panic-related behavior. A similar inhibitory effect has also been reported after local administration of bradykinin (BK), which is blocked by the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. The latter evidence, points to an interaction between BK and opioids in the dPAG. We further explored the existence of this interaction through the dPAG electrical stimulation model of panic. We also investigated whether intra-dPAG injection of captopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) that also degrades BK, causes a panicolytic-like effect. Our results showed that intra-dPAG injection of BK inhibited escape performance in a dose-dependent way, and this panicolytic-like effect was blocked by the BK type 2 receptor (B2R) antagonist HOE-140, and by the selective MOR antagonist CTOP. Conversely, the panicolytic-like effect caused by local administration of the selective MOR agonist DAMGO was antagonized by pre-treatment with either CTOP or HOE-140, indicating cross-antagonism between MOR and B2R. Finally, intra-dPAG injection of captopril also impaired escape in a dose-dependent way, and this panicolytic-like effect was blocked by pretreatment with HOE-140, suggesting mediation by endogenous BK. The panicolytic-like effect of captopril indicates that the use of ACE inhibitors in the clinical management of panic disorder may be worth exploring.",

    "22": "Retrospective cohort study.", 
    "23": "Using archived data from the electronic health record (EHR), we evaluated patients with ACS admitted to 1 of 2 hospitals between January 2008 and December 2012. Patients aged 18 to 89 years who were discharged with a principal diagnosis of ACS were included in the study. Descriptive statistics were compiled and medication use was compared at 3 time points: admission, discharge, and within 90 days post discharge.", 
    "24": "This study included 4767 patients. The mean number of total medications increased from 8.6 \u00b1 6.5 to 11.4 \u00b1 5.4 from admission to discharge, dropping slightly within 90 days post discharge (11.1 \u00b1 5.2). Patients taking medications at least twice daily increased from 6.4 of 10 at admission to 9 of 10 at discharge. Cardioprotective medication use increased by a relative 76% for aspirin, 72% for statins, 85% for beta-blockers, and 29% for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers from admission to discharge, whereas P2Y12 receptor inhibitor use increased 4-fold.", 
    "25": "Medication complexity among patients with ACS are high, with notable changes from admission to discharge. Awareness of the extent of medication burden provides clinicians and policy makers with insight to help address medication use during the ACS peri-hospitalization period.", 
    "26": "Optimal treatment of blood pressure (BP) and other cardiovascular risk factors, including hyperglycemia, is integral to diabetes management. There are limited data from the primary care setting concerning the contemporary and comprehensive management of type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors in relation to guideline-recommended BP target achievement.", 
    "27": "The Diabetes Mellitus Status in Canada (DM-SCAN) survey included 5172 ambulatory patients with type 2 diabetes. Data were collected on patient demographics, medical histories, medication usage, BP levels and laboratory investigations. We stratified the study population based on their attainment of the BP target recommended by the Canadian Diabetes Association 2013 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Diabetes in Canada and the Canadian Hypertension Education Program (<130/80\u2009mmHg) and compared patient clinical characteristics and treatments.", 
    "28": "Of the 5145 patients with available BP data, 36% achieved the BP target. Prevalence of smoking, known coronary artery disease, retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy were similar in the groups with BP 130/80\u2009mmHg or higher and BP 130/80\u2009mmHg or lower. Patients with BP 130/80\u2009mmHg or higher were taking more antihypertensive agents and were more likely to be taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics and calcium channel blockers. They also had significantly higher glycated hemoglobin and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. Overall, these patients were also less likely to achieve guideline-recommended glycemic and lipid targets.", 
    "29": "Only about one-third of patients with diabetes achieved the target BP of below 130/80\u2009mmHg. Patients with BP 130/80\u2009mmHg or higher were also less likely to achieve optimal guideline-recommended glycated hemoglobin and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol targets. Improved comprehensive management of all risk factors in patients with diabetes is warranted."
