    "0": "Previous studies have shown that an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may be triggered by external activities; however, their frequency, predictors, and significance are uncertain. We evaluated data from the National Israel Survey of Acute Coronary Syndromes, which was conducted in 2004 (February to March) in all 25 coronary care units and cardiac wards in Israel. Demographic and clinical data were recorded for consecutive participants, including potential triggers and time of symptom onset of ACS. Among the 1,849 patients who completed the trigger question, 1/4 (25.9%) reported a possible trigger, comprising heavy physical exertion (15.2%), emotional stress (8.3%), anger (1.1%), heavy meal (1.3%), and sexual activity (0.5%). Predictors of a triggered ACS were age <65\u00a0years, previous angina, no previous angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin 2 receptor blockers, impaired functional class, not having typical chest pain on admission, and a final diagnosis of unstable angina. The highest proportion of triggered ACS was between noon and 6 p.m. Physical exertion as a trigger was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (0.4% vs 2.8%, p <0.05) and 1-year mortality. Emotional stress as a trigger did not influence in-hospital or 1-year mortality; however among those discharged from hospital, it was associated with increased 30-day rehospitalization (27.6% vs 19.3%, p <0.05) and a trend toward increased mortality (4.1% vs 2.0%, p\u00a0= 0.10).", 
    "1": "Patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy. While dose reduction/discontinuation (r/d) of \u03b2-blockers (BB) and furosemide in acute decompensated HF (ADHF) worsen outcomes, data on ACEI/ARB are lacking.", 
    "2": "To determine the frequency and reasons for ACEI/ARB therapy r/d in ADHF patients, we studied 174 patients with LVEF <40% on ACEI/ARB and BB therapy upon admission over 1 year.", 
    "3": "ACEI/ARB doses were r/d in 17.2% because of acute kidney injury (56.7%), hypotension (23.3%), and hyperkalemia (10%). Clinical characteristics were similar between patients with r/d and continued therapy. Admission and discharge creatinine (Cr) levels were higher in the r/d group. On multivariate analysis, admission Cr and admission systolic blood pressures were independent predictors of r/d. Among patients with renal dysfunction cited as the r/d reason, Cr did not significantly rise in 23.5%. The r/d group had a longer length of stay (LOS).", 
    "4": "ACEI/ARB dose is reduced and/or discontinued in nearly one-fifth of all ADHF admissions, and LOS is longer in the ACEI/ARB r/d group. While impaired renal function is the most frequently cited reason, nearly one-fourth of the patients had stable renal function. ACEI/ARB r/d therapy in the setting of ADHF merits further study.", 
    "5": "Heart failure treatment can count on several drugs, all providing an improvement in outcome, but that cannot be realistically used all together in the same patient. It would be useful to have a tool that allows arranging the most appropriate therapy cocktail in each patient. The aim of this review is to show the main differences in the effects of several drugs on cardiopulmonary function in heart failure patients, both in resting condition and during exercise, and to discuss how these differences can be taken into account when choosing the most appropriate therapeutic protocol. In summary, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers act synergistically increasing exercise capacity and peak oxygen uptake, but through different mechanisms, the former improving lung diffusion and exercise ventilatory efficiency, an action that is counteracted by concomitant aspirin therapy, and the latter probably by improving muscle perfusion. As to beta-blocker, non-selective compounds, such as carvedilol, improve ventilation efficiency on one side, but interfere with lung diffusion on the other, and they are probably less tolerated in hypoxic conditions. On the contrary, \u03b21 selective compounds, such as bisoprolol or nebivolol, have a neutral effect on both lung diffusion and ventilation efficiency. These observations could be the basis for the choice of pharmacological therapy in heart failure patients.", 
    "6": "Yes for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, no for angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). A 2011 meta-analysis of 5 RCTs (total 2975 patients) that compared ACE inhibitor therapy with placebo in diabetic patients without hypertension and albuminuria found that ACE inhibitors reduced the risk of new-onset microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria by 18% (relative risk [RR]=0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.92).", 
    "7": "Background Cardiovascular medications have been commonly associated with medication errors. Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence and predictors of medication errors in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Setting the coronary care unit of a university teaching hospital. Methods This was a prospective observational study on 150 patients admitted to the coronary care unit between August 2014 and July 2015. Main outcome measure The principal outcome was the number (frequency) of encountered medication errors. Results Of total 5790 prescription items reviewed, 547 (9.4%) potential medication errors were identified of which 523 (9.0%) were prescribing errors and 24 were monitoring errors. The most frequent prescribing errors were dosing errors (231, 42.2%) followed by loading dose omission error (91, 16.6%), omission of essential drugs on 1st day (43, 7.9%), and timing error (40, 7.3%). Errors frequently encountered with drugs such as aspirin, enoxaparin, beta-blockers followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and clopidogrel. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that renal impairment (OR 6.02; 95% CI 1.4-35.4; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and longer duration of hospital stay (OR 4.01; 95% CI 1.5-10.7; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) were predictors of the higher incidence of medication errors. Conclusion Prescribing and monitoring errors in coronary care unit are frequent and avoidable, with the majority of errors were ranked to be of mild to moderate severity. Dosing errors, omission of essential drugs and monitoring errors were most common error types encountered. Dosage adjustment based on estimation of the glomerular filtration rate immediately after admission help avoiding dosage-related errors.", 
    "8": "Heart failure is an epidemic in the United States and a major health problem worldwide. The syndrome of acute heart failure is marked by a recent onset of symptoms usually in terms of days to a few weeks of worsening fatigue, shortness of breath, orthopnea, swelling, and sudden onset of weight gain. Physicians caring for patients with heart failure must know the risk factors for this disease, pathophysiology, symptomatology, important examination findings, key diagnostic tests, and management approach so as to improve symptoms and reduce mortality.", 
    "9": "Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) benazeprilat have not been evaluated in horses. This study was designed to establish PK profiles for benazepril and benazeprilat after intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) administration of benazepril using a PK/PD model. This study also aims to determine the effects of benazeprilat on serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), selecting the most appropriate dose that suppresses ACE activity. Six healthy horses in a crossover design received IV benazepril at 0.50mg/kg and PO at doses 0 (placebo), 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00mg/kg. Blood pressures (BP) were measured and blood samples were obtained at different times in order to measure serum drug concentrations and serum ACE activity, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and spectrophotometry, respectively. Systemic bioavailability of benazeprilat after PO benazepril was 3-4%. Maximum ACE inhibitions from baseline were 99.63% (IV benazepril), 6.77% (placebo) and 78.91%, 85.74% and 89.51% (for the three PO benazepril doses). Significant differences in BP were not found. Although oral availability was low, benazeprilat 1.00mg/kg, reached sufficient serum concentrations to induce long lasting serum ACE inhibitions (between 88 and 50%) for the first 48h. Additional research on benazepril administration in equine patients is indicated.", 
    "10": "In heart failure (HF), the heart cannot pump blood efficiently and is therefore unable to meet the body's demands of oxygen, and/or there is increased end-diastolic pressure. Current treatments for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotension receptor type 1 (AT1 ) antagonists, \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists, aldosterone receptor antagonists, diuretics, digoxin and a combination drug with AT1 receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor. In HF, the risk of readmission for hospital and mortality is markedly higher with a heart rate (HR) above 70 bpm. Here, we review the evidence regarding the use of ivabradine for lowering HR in HF. Ivabradine is a blocker of an I funny current (I(f)) channel and causes rate-dependent inhibition of the pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial node. In clinical trials of HFrEF, treatment with ivabradine seems to improve clinical outcome, for example improved ejection fraction (EF) and less readmission for hospital, but the effect appears most pronounced in patients with HRs above 70 bpm, while the effect on cardiovascular death appears less consistent. The adverse effects of ivabradine include bradycardia, atrial fibrillation and visual disturbances, but ivabradine avoids the negative inotrope effects observed with \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists. In conclusion, in patients with stable HFrEF with EF<35% and HR above 70 bpm, ivabradine improves the outcome and might be a first choice of therapy, if beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are not tolerated. Further studies must show whether that can be extended to HF patients with preserved EF.", 
    "11": "A rapid and highly specific assay was developed and validated for the estimation of ZYDPLA1 in rat plasma using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry with positive electrospray ionization. Method validation comprised of parameters such as specificity, matrix effect, precision, accuracy, recovery, stability, etc. The assay procedure involved a simple protein precipitation of ZYDPLA1 and alprazolam (internal standard) from rat plasma using acetonitrile. Chromatographic separation was achieved with a gradient mobile phase comprising: (A) 0.2% ammonia in purified water; (B) 0.1% formic acid in isopropyl alcohol/methanol (1: 1\u2009v/v); and (C) acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1\u2009mL/min on an ACE-5, C18 (4.6\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009mm) column with a run time of 5.5\u2009min. The quantitation of ZYDPLA1 was achieved by the summation of four multiple reaction mode transitions (m/z 399.7\u2009\u2192\u2009383.0, 399.7\u2009\u2192\u2009276.10, 399.7\u2009\u2192\u2009153.20 and 399.7\u2009\u2192\u2009127.20), while that of the internal standard was by a single multiple reaction mode transition (m/z 309.10\u2009\u2192\u2009281.00). The lower limit of quantitation achieved was 0.01\u2009\u03bcg/mL and the method showed linearity from 0.01 to 25\u2009\u03bcg/mL. The intra- and inter-day precision (%CV) of the quality control samples was within 8.81% and accuracy was \u00b110% of nominal values. This novel method was applied for evaluation of toxicokinetics of ZYDLA1 in rats.", 
    "12": "Hypotensive transfusion reactions, which account for almost 3% of all transfusion reactions, are associated with patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The current hypothesis suggests that they are caused by bradykinin-induced vasodilation in the absence of allergic, hemolytic, or septic mechanisms. The hypotension observed frequently is unresponsive to conventional therapy with catecholamines. The suggested intraoperative management includes cessation of transfusion and washing red blood cells before blood replacement. We present a patient experiencing a severe intraoperative hypotensive transfusion reaction, unresponsive to epinephrine and norepinephrine, in whom we were able to restore blood pressure and continue the transfusion of blood and plasma by infusing vasopressin.",

The search terms were a RAS, angiotensin, angiotensin receptor, prorenin, pro (renin) receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker associated with ocular disorders like cataract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy (DR), macular degeneration, and uveitis. Articles were reviewed on the basis of the association between ocular disorders and RAS and relevant articles were discussed.", 
    "15": "The literature revealed that the individual RAS components including renin, angiotensins, angiotensin converting enzymes, and RAS receptors have been expressed in the specific ocular tissues like retina, choroid, and ciliary body. The activation of both circulatory and local RAS potentiate the various inflammatory and angiogenic signaling molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and advanced glycation end products (AGE) in the ocular tissues and leads to several blinding disorders like DR, glaucoma, and macular degeneration. The classical and newer RAS inhibitors have illustrated protective effects on blinding disorders, including DR, glaucoma, macular degeneration, uveitis, and cataract.",
