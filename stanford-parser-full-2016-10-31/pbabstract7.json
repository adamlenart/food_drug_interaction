    "1": "In this prospective, exploratory study we analyzed 12 hemodialysis (HD) patients, who received a KTX and had excellent graft function six to 12 months thereafter. The concentrations of plasma Angiotensin (Ang) peptides (Ang I, Ang II, Ang-(1-7), Ang-(1-5), Ang-(2-8), Ang-(3-8)) were simultaneously quantified with a novel mass spectrometry-based method. Further, renin and aldosterone concentrations were determined by standard immunoassays.", 
    "2": "Ang values showed a strong inter-individual variability among HD patients. Yet, despite a continued broad dispersion of Ang values after KTX, a substantial improvement of the renin/Ang II correlation was observed in patients without RAS blockade or on angiotensin receptor blocker (HD: renin/Ang II R(2) = 0.660, KTX: renin/Ang II R(2) = 0.918). Ang-(1-7) representing the alternative RAS axis was only marginally detectable both on HD and after KTX.", 
    "3": "Following KTX, renin-dependent Ang II formation adapts in non-ACE inhibitor-treated patients. Thus, a largely normal RAS regulation is reconstituted after successful KTX. However, individual Ang concentration variations and a lack of potentially beneficial alternative peptides after KTX call for individualized treatment. The long-term post-transplant RAS regulation remains to be determined.", 
    "4": "The mortality rate attributed to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has decreased in the world. However, this disease is still responsible for high costs for health systems. Several factors could decrease mortality in these patients, including implementation of cardiac intensive care units (CICU). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CICU implementation on prescribed recommended treatments and mortality 30 days after STEMI.", 
    "5": "We performed a retrospective study with patients admitted to CICU between 2005 and 2006 (after group) and between 2000 and 2002, before CICU implementation (before group).", 
    "6": "The after group had 101 patients, while the before group had 143 patients. There were no differences in general characteristics between groups. We observed an increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, clopidogrel and statin prescriptions after CICU implementation. We did not find differences regarding number of patients submitted to reperfusion therapy; however, there was an increase in primary percutaneous angioplasty compared with thrombolytic therapy in the after group. There was no difference in 30-day mortality (before: 10.5%; after: 8.9%; p=0.850), but prescription of recommended treatments was high in both groups. Prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blocker decreased mortality risk by 4.4 and 4.9 times, respectively.", 
    "7": "CICU implementation did not reduce mortality after 30 days in patients with STEMI; however, it increased the prescription of standard treatment for these patients.", 
    "8": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are important agents in blood pressure (BP) management. It was recently shown that the egg-protein hydrolysate NWT-03 inhibited ACE in Zucker diabetic fatty rats. We therefore designed a dose-finding study to assess the effects of 1, 2 and 5 g NWT-03 on daytime, 36-h, and night-time systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) in ninety-two generally healthy subjects with normal BP (n 29), high-normal BP (n 34) or mild hypertension (n 29). The study had a cross-over design with six treatment arms (1 g NWT-03 or placebo in period 1 and placebo or 1 g NWT-03 in period 2, 2 g NTW-03 or placebo in period 1 and placebo or 2 g NWT-03 in period 2, or 5 g NTW-03 or placebo in period 1 and placebo or 5 g NTW-03 in period 2). A comparable number of subjects from each BP class were included in each study arm. Duration of both treatments in each arm was 7 d, separated by 5-d wash-out periods. BP was measured with an ambulatory BP monitor before and after the treatments. In mild-hypertensive subjects, 2 g NWT-03 significantly decreased daytime SBP (7\u00b79 mmHg; P=0\u00b7006), daytime DBP (4\u00b72 mmHg; P=0\u00b7009), 36-h SBP (6\u00b79 mmHg; P=0\u00b7015) and 36-h DBP (3\u00b75 mmHg; P=0\u00b7035) compared with placebo subjects. In addition, in mild-hypertensive subjects, 5 g NWT-03 significantly decreased night-time SBP (14\u00b78 mmHg; P=0\u00b7008) and night-time DBP (8\u00b74 mmHg; P=0\u00b7020) compared with that in placebo subjects. To conclude, we found that 2 g NWT-03 lowered daytime and 36-h BP in subjects with mild hypertension, and 5 g NWT-03 lowered night-time BP in subjects with mild hypertension. As no dose-response relationship was evident, these results should be interpreted with care, and additional studies are needed.", 
    "9": "We examined whether tolvaptan combined with an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) is more effective than tolvaptan alone in the treatment of patients with heart failure (HF). Sixty-five hospitalized patients with acute decompensated HF were included in this study. They were divided into 2 groups; an ARB/ACE-I group (n = 44, who received ARB or ACE-I before the use of tolvaptan) and a non-ARB/ACE-I group (n = 21). There were no significant differences in patient characteristics including medications at baseline between the non-ARB/ACE-I and ARB/ACE-I groups with the exception of the percentages of hypertension and ischemic heart disease. Urinary volume (UV) at baseline in the ARB/ACE-I group was slightly higher than that in the non-ARB/ACE-I group. The increase in UV after the use of tolvaptan in the non-ARB/ACE-I group was significantly higher than that in the ARB/ACE-I group. The cardiothoracic ratio and the reduction in body weight were similar between the groups after tolvaptan use. Finally, in a logistic regression analysis, a response to the use of tolvaptan was independently associated with the non-use of ARB/ACE-I, but not with age, gender, body mass index, loop diuretic, or human arterial natriuretic peptide. In conclusion, tolvaptan alone might induce an increase in UV in decompensated HF patients without ARB/ ACE-I, although the treatment of HF with ARB/ACE-I is the first choice strategy.", 
    "10": "Most chronic nephropathies progress relentlessly to end-stage kidney disease. Research in animals and humans has helped our understanding of the mechanisms of chronic kidney disease progression. Current therapeutic strategies to prevent or revert renal disease progression focus on reduction of urinary protein excretion and blood pressure control. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers is the most effective treatment to achieve these purposes in non-diabetic and diabetic proteinuric renal diseases. For those individuals in which nephroprotection by RAS blockade is only partial, sodium-glucose linked cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors could be a promising new class of drugs to provide further renoprotective benefit when added on to RAS blockers.", 
    "11": "Hypertension and diabetes are two of the most important modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular and renal disease. The majority of patients with diabetes also have high blood pressure (BP) and the presence of hypertension in these patients dramatically increases cardiovascular and renal risk. Areas covered: This article will discuss chemical therapies for hypertension in patients with diabetes, based on currently available evidence on the effects of antihypertensive treatment on metabolic profile and renal endpoints that are the factors mostly influencing drug choice. Expert opinion: Several lines of evidence suggest that angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin-receptor-blockers (ARBs) and calcium-channel-blockers (CCBs) have beneficial or neutral effects on carbohydrate metabolism, whereas old \u03b2-blockers and thiazide diuretics have not. Renal outcome trials clearly suggest that in proteinuric diabetic CKD ACEIs and ARBs reduce the rate of disease progression. Thus, an ACEI or an ARB, if tolerated, should be the first choice in diabetic individuals, followed by CCBs, vasodilating \u03b2-blockers and diuretics, depending on the individual patient characteristics. Recent studies suggest that the novel antidiabetic class of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors may offer a small reduction in BP together with important decrease in incidence of cardiovascular and renal events in patients with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "12": "Adherence to pharmacotherapeutic treatment guidelines in patients with heart failure (HF) is of major prognostic importance, but thorough implementation of guidelines in routine care remains insufficient. Our aim was to investigate prevalence and characteristics of HF in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), and to assess the adherence to current HF guidelines in patients with HF stage C, thus identifying potential targets for the optimization of guideline implementation.", 
    "13": "Patients from the German sample of the European Action on Secondary and Primary Prevention by Intervention to Reduce Events (EuroAspire) IV survey with a hospitalization for CHD within the previous six to 36\u00a0months providing valid data on echocardiography as well as on signs and symptoms of HF were categorized into stages of HF: A, prevalence of risk factors for developing HF; B, asymptomatic but with structural heart disease; C, symptomatic HF. A Guideline Adherence Indicator (GAI-3) was calculated for patients with reduced (\u226440%) left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) as number of drugs taken per number of drugs indicated; beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) were considered.", 
    "14": "509/536 patients entered analysis. HF stage A was prevalent in n\u00a0=\u00a020 (3.9%), stage B in n\u00a0=\u00a0264 (51.9%), and stage C in n\u00a0=\u00a0225 (44.2%) patients; 94/225 patients were diagnosed with HFrEF (42%). Stage C patients were older, had a longer duration of CHD, and a higher prevalence of arterial hypertension. Awareness of pre-diagnosed HF was low (19%). Overall GAI-3 of HFrEF patients was 96.4% with a trend towards lower GAI-3 in patients with lower LVEF due to less thorough MRA prescription.", 
    "15": "In our sample of CHD patients, prevalence of HF stage C was high and a sizable subgroup suffered from HFrEF. Overall, pharmacotherapy was fairly well implemented in HFrEF patients, although somewhat worse in patients with more reduced ejection fraction. Two major targets were identified possibly suited to further improve the implementation of HF guidelines: 1) increase patients\u00b4 awareness of diagnosis and importance of HF; and 2) disseminate knowledge about the importance of appropriately implementing the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.", 
    "16": "This is a cross-sectional analysis of a non-interventional study. Therefore, it was not registered as an interventional trial.", 
    "17": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are recommended as first-line therapy in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The comparative effectiveness of different ACEIs is not known.", 
    "18": "4,723 out-patients with stable HFrEF prescribed either enalapril, lisinopril, or ramipril were identified from three registries in Norway, England, and Germany. In three separate matching procedures, patients were individually matched with respect to both dose equivalents and their respective propensity scores for ACEI treatment.", 
    "19": "Our results suggest that enalapril, lisinopril and ramipril are equally effective in the treatment of patients with HFrEF when given at equivalent doses.", 
    "20": "Little is known about patterns of medication use and lifestyle counseling in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) in the United States.", 
    "21": "The authors sought to evaluate trends in both medical therapy and lifestyle counseling for PAD patients in the United States from 2005 through\u00a02012.", 
    "22": "Data from 1,982 outpatient visits among patients with PAD were obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a nationally representative assessment of office-based and hospital outpatient department practice. Trends in the proportion of visits with medication use (antiplatelet therapy, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs], and cilostazol) and lifestyle counseling (exercise or diet counseling and smoking cessation) were evaluated.", 
    "23": "Over the 8-year period, the average annual number of ambulatory visits in the United States for PAD was 3,883,665. Across all visits, mean age was 69.2 years, 51.8% were female, and 56.6% were non-Hispanic white. Comorbid coronary artery disease (CAD) was present in 24.3% of visits. Medication use for cardiovascular prevention and symptoms of claudication was low: any antiplatelet therapy in 35.7% (standard error [SE]: 2.7%), statin in 33.1% (SE: 2.4%), ACEI/ARB in 28.4% (SE: 2.0%), and cilostazol in 4.7% (SE: 1.0%) of visits. Exercise or diet counseling was used in 22% (SE: 2.3%) of visits. Among current smokers with PAD, smoking cessation counseling or medication was used in 35.8% (SE: 4.6%) of visits. There was no significant change in medication use or lifestyle counseling over time. Compared with visits for patients with PAD alone, comorbid PAD and CAD were more likely to be prescribed antiplatelet therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8 to 3.9), statins (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.8 to 3.9), ACEI/ARB (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.8 to 3.9), and smoking cessation counseling (OR: 4.4; 95% CI: 2.0 to 9.6).", 
    "24": "The use of guideline-recommended therapies in patients with PAD was much lower than expected, which highlights an opportunity to improve the quality of care in these high-risk patients.", 
    "25": "Drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) improved the prognosis in patients with hypertension, heart failure, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. However, combining different drugs brought no further benefit while increasing the risk of hyperkalemia, hypotension and acute renal failure. This was so with combining angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptors type 1 antagonists (ARB). Dissimilarly, in animal disease models this dual therapy proved clearly superior to single drug treatment and became the optimal standard regime for comparison with other treatments. This review analyzes the causes of the discrepancy of effects of the dual therapy between animal experiments versus clinical studies, and is focused on the outcomes in chronic kidney disease. Discussed is the role of species differences in RAAS, of the variability of the disease features in humans versus relative stability in animals, of the genetic uniformity in the animals but not in humans, and of the biased publication habits of experimental versus clinical studies. We attempt to understand the causes and reconcile the discordant findings and suggest to what extent dual RAAS inhibition should be continued in animal experiments and why its application in the clinics should be limited to strictly selected groups of patients."
