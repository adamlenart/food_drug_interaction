Visceral angioedema was diagnosed based on clinical suspicion and abdominal computed tomography (CT). Awareness of this rare side effect of a common medication is key to avoid delays in diagnosis and unnecessary procedures.", 
    "1": "Pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) are largely derived from animal models. To examine if renin-angiotensin system (RAS) changes in humans are concordant with rodent models, we measured concentration of angiotensinogen (AOG), cathepsin D(CTSD), angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE), ACE2 and enzymatic activities of ACE, ACE2 and aminopeptidase-A in FVB mice 13-20 weeks after streptozotocin (n=9) or vehicle (n=15) and people with longstanding type 1 diabetes, with (n=37) or without (n=81) DKD. In streptozotocin-treated mice, urine AOG and CTSD were 10.4-and 3.0-fold higher than controls, respectively (p-values <0.001). Enzymatic activities of ACE, ACE2 and APA were 6.2-, 3.2- and 18.8-fold higher, respectively, in diabetic animals (p-values <0.001). AngiotensinII was 2.4-fold higher in diabetic animals (p-value 0.017). Compared to people without DKD, those with DKD had higher urine AOG (170 vs. 15\u03bcg/g) and CTSD (147 vs. 31\u03bcg/g). In people with DKD, urine ACE concentration was 1.8-fold higher (1.4vs. 0.8\u03bcg/g without DKD), while its enzymatic activity was 0.6-fold lower (1.0 vs. 1.6 x 10 RFU/g without DKD). Lower ACE activity, not ACE protein concentration, was associated with ACE inhibitor (ACEI) treatment. After adjustment for clinical covariates, AOG, CTSD, ACE concentration and activity remained associated with DKD. In conclusion, in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and humans with DKD, urine concentrations and enzymatic activities of several RAS components are concordantly increased, consistent with enhanced RAS activity and greater angiotensinII formation. ACEI use was associated with a specific reduction in urine ACE activity, not ACE protein concentration, suggesting it may be a marker of exposure to this therapy.",

    "3": "In QUALIFY, an international, prospective, observational, longitudinal survey, 6669 outpatients with HFrEF were recruited 1-15 months after heart failure (HF) hospitalization from September 2013 to December 2014 in 36 countries and followed up at 6 months. A global adherence to guidelines score was developed for prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers (BBs), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and ivabradine and their dosages. Baseline global adherence score was good in 23% of patients, moderate in 55%, and poor in 22%. At 6-month follow-up, poor adherence was associated with significantly higher overall mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-3.44, P=0.001], cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.36-3.77, P=0.003), HF mortality (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.21-4.2, P=0.032), combined HF hospitalization or HF death (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08-1.71, P=0.024) and cardiovascular hospitalization or cardiovascular death (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.69, P=0.013). There was a strong trend between poor adherence and HF hospitalization (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.68, P=0.069).", 
    "4": "Good adherence to pharmacologic treatment guidelines for ACEIs, ARBs, BBs, MRAs and ivabradine, with prescription of at least 50% of recommended dosages, was associated with better clinical outcomes during 6-month follow-up.

    "6": "Twenty-four consecutive patients were retrospectively identified among women presenting with PPCM in Western Sweden. Of these, 14 had concomitant preeclampsia. There was only one fatality. The mean (standard deviation) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at diagnosis was 35.0\u2009\u00b1\u20099.9%. Ten women, 47.6%, required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. All patients received \u03b2-blockers (BB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACE-I/ARB), which were tapered off over a mean/median period of 3.3/2.5\u2009years with only one case of worsening heart failure. The mean follow-up for medication was 7.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6\u2009years. Early and late/non-recovery was defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I and NYHA II-IV at one\u2009year, respectively.

    "8": "Heart failure is common in adults, accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its prevalence is increasing because of ageing of the population and improved treatment of acute cardiovascular events, despite the efficacy of many therapies for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), \u03b2 blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and advanced device therapies. Combined angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) have been associated with improvements in hospital admissions and mortality from heart failure compared with enalapril, and guidelines now recommend substitution of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with ARNIs in appropriate patients. Improved safety of left ventricular assist devices means that these are becoming more commonly used in patients with severe symptoms. Antidiabetic therapies might further improve outcomes in patients with heart failure. New drugs with novel mechanisms of action, such as cardiac myosin activators, are under investigation for patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is a heterogeneous disorder that remains incompletely understood and will continue to increase in prevalence with the ageing population. Although some data suggest that spironolactone might improve outcomes in these patients, no therapy has conclusively shown a significant effect. Hopefully, future studies will address these unmet needs for patients with heart failure. Admissions for acute heart failure continue to increase but, to date, no new therapies have improved clinical outcomes.", 
    "9": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is being increasingly recognised in ageing populations. There are a paucity of data about AKI risk factors among older individuals with diabetes and infections, who are at particularly high risk of AKI. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for developing acute kidney injury (AKI) amongst older patients with diabetes and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in England, and whether the impact of underlying kidney function varied with age.", 
    "10": "This was a population-based retrospective cohort study over 7 years (01/04/2004-31/3/2011) using electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics. The study population comprised individuals with diabetes aged \u226565\u00a0years with CAP. Associations between demographic, lifestyle factors, co-morbidities and medications and development of AKI within 28\u00a0days of CAP were explored in a logistic regression model.", 
    "11": "Among 3471 patients with CAP and complete covariate data, 298 patients developed subsequent AKI. In multivariable analyses, factors found to be independently associated with AKI included: male sex (adjusted odds ratio, aOR: 1.56 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-2.04), hypertension (aOR1.36 95% CI 1.01-1.85), being prescribed either angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II-receptor-blockers (aOR: 1.59 95% CI: 1.19-2.13), or insulin (aOR: 2.27 95% CI: 1.27-4.05), presence of proteinuria (aOR 1.27 95% CI 0.98-1.63), and low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The odds of AKI were more graded amongst older participants aged \u226580\u00a0years compared to those of younger age: for eGFR of \u226429\u00a0mL/min/1.73m(2) (vs 60\u00a0ml/min/1.73m(2)) aOR: 5.51 95% CI 3.28-9.27 and for eGFR 30-59\u00a0mL/min/1.73m(2) 1.96 95% CI 1.30-2.96, whilst any eGFR\u00a0<\u00a060\u00a0ml/min/1.73m(2) was associated with approximately 3-fold increase in the odds of AKI amongst younger individuals (p-value for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.007).",

    "13": "Renin-angiotensin system and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathway both play important roles in carcinogenesis, but the interplay of renin-angiotensin system and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase in carcinogenesis is not clear. In this study, we researched the interaction of renin-angiotensin system and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase in renal carcinogenesis of uninephrectomized rats. A total of 96 rats were stratified into four groups: sham, uninephrectomized, and uninephrectomized treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Renal adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and its downstream molecule acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot at 10\u2009months after uninephrectomy. Meanwhile, we examined renal carcinogenesis by histological transformation and expressions of Ki67 and mutant p53. During the study, fasting lipid profiles were detected dynamically at 3, 6, 8, and 10\u2009months. The results indicated that adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase expression in uninephrectomized rats showed 36.8% reduction by immunohistochemistry and 89.73% reduction by western blot. Inversely, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase expression increased 83.3% and 19.07% in parallel to hyperlipidemia at 6, 8, and 10\u2009months. The histopathology of carcinogenesis in remnant kidneys was manifested by atypical proliferation and carcinoma in situ, as well as increased expressions of Ki67 and mutant p53. Intervention with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker significantly prevented the inhibition of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and renal carcinogenesis in uninephrectomized rats. In conclusion, the novel findings suggest that uninephrectomy-induced disturbance in adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathway resulted in hyperlipidemia and carcinogenesis in tubular epithelial cells, which may be largely attenuated by renin-angiotensin system blockade, implying the interaction of renin-angiotensin system and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in renal carcinogenesis of uninephrectomized rats.", 
    "14": "Intensive physical exercise may facilitate potassium release from skeletal muscles that may result in hyperkalemia. Commonly used drugs including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and statins increase a risk of hyperkalemia. It is not known whether the effect of these drugs on serum potassium during physical exercise is additive. The study compared the effect of physical exercise on the changes of serum potassium in hypertensive patients receiving ACEI alone or in combination with statin. Eighteen patients with arterial hypertension with normal renal function were included in a prospective placebo-controlled cross-over study. The patients underwent 3 exercise tests on a bicycle ergometer with 55 - 60% of maximum oxygen consumption each lasting 30 minutes, i.e. after being treated with ACEI alone for six months, and then in a random order after the administration of ACEI with statin or ACEI with placebo each time for eight weeks separated by 2-week wash-out. Serum potassium was measured with atomic emission flame spectrometry before and after 15 and 30 minutes exercise and after 30-minute recovery. During the exercise serum potassium concentration increased moderately but significantly during all exercise tests. Mean serum potassium during exercise remained within the normal range. There were no differences in the exercise-induced changes of serum potassium during the exercise tests performed after ACEI combined with statin or with placebo. Addition of statin to ACEI does not increase the risk of hyperkalemia in hypertensive patients with preserved renal function during physical exercise with intensity typical for routine daily activities.", 
    "15": "Beta-blocker treatment improves left ventricular function, morbidity, and survival in patients with systolic heart failure (HF). However, there are limited data addressing the safety and efficacy of \u03b2 blockers in the setting of cocaine use as there is a perceived risk of adverse outcomes. Our aim was to determine if beta-blocker treatment was safe in HF patients with a history of cocaine use compared with HF patients without history of cocaine use. We also examined whether effects differed between cardioselective versus noncardioselective \u03b2 blockers. Ninety systolic HF patients with cocaine use were compared with 177 patients with nonischemic, systolic HF, and no cocaine use. Outcomes were HF readmissions, major adverse cardiovascular events, and death using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, black race, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, renal insufficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Beta-blocker treatment in systolic HF patients with cocaine use did not have significant differences in HF readmissions (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.1.38), major adverse cardiovascular events (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.09), death (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.34), or all combined outcomes (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.47) compared with beta-blocker treatment in HF patients without cocaine use. Within HF patients with cocaine use, mortality rates (HR 1.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 8.23) were not significantly different between patients treated with noncardioselective versus cardioselective \u03b2 blockers. In conclusion, beta-blocker treatment in systolic HF patients with cocaine use was not associated with adverse outcomes.",

Patients with RV dysfunction in the absence of severe valvular dysfunction are eligible for inclusion. The primary end point is the change in RV ejection fraction after 18 to 24 months, as measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, laboratory measurements, echocardiography, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing are performed.",
