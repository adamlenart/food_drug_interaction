    "0": "Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and nonobstructive coronary artery disease (nonobCAD) may be perceived to be at lower risk for cardiac events, relative to those with obstructive CAD (obCAD), and thus less likely to receive optimal preventive medications in the year following AMI.", 
    "1": "We aimed to determine if AMI patients with nonobCAD, compared to obCAD, received lower rates of prevention medications in the year following AMI.", 
    "2": "We compared optimal prevention medication use at hospital discharge, 1, 6, and 12 months after hospitalization. Optimal medication use was defined as the receipt of all prevention medications for which that patient was eligible (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel, statins, \u03b2-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers). We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to determine the association between nonobCAD to medication use and adjusted for potential confounders.", 
    "3": "Three thousand six hundred thirty AMI patients were studied, of whom 200 (5.2%) had nonobCAD. Fewer nonobCAD patients received optimal medication use compared to obCAD patients at discharge (31% vs 65%, P < 0.001), driven primarily by lower rates of clopidogrel use (40.5% vs 83.3%, P < 0.001). After adjustment for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), differences in medication use were similar at discharge and 1 year after hospitalization. Stratified analyses by receipt of PCI suggested patients confined to medical management had less optimal medication use, regardless of their CAD burden.", 
    "4": "Lower rates of unadjusted optimal medication use were seen in nonobCAD patients, driven by low clopidogrel use among medically managed patients, suggesting improvement efforts should focus on these patients.", 
    "5": "The renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASBs), including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), are widely used to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Accumulating pre-clinical and clinical studies suggested that RASBs possesses anti-carcinogenic properties, and their use is associated with favorable outcomes in several type cancers. To conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of adjunctive therapy of renin-angiotensin system blockers combined with chemotherapeutic agents in cancer patients.", 
    "6": "Data from a total of 2436 patients from 7 retrospective studies investigating chemotherapeutic agents in combination with RASBs agents versus chemotherapeutic agents were included in this meta-analysis. Publication bias was assessed by the Begg's Test, Egger's test and funnel plot. Subgroup analysis was conducted when the chemotherapeutic agents were the same.", 
    "7": "A signi\ufb01cant reduction in overall mortality in favor of chemotherapeutic agents in combination with RASBs agents was observed, hazard ratio (HR) 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69-0.92); there was a signi\ufb01cant decrease in the risk of disease progression in favor of chemotherapeutic agents in combination with RASBs regimens, HR 0.79 (95% CI: 0.66-0.94), compared with those who only used chemotherapeutic agents. Subgroup analysis indicated that platinum-based agents plus ACEI/ARB could increase significantly the survival outcome (HR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.38-0.82).", 
    "8": "Our results suggest that RASBs combined with chemotherapeutic agents may improve outcomes in multiple types' cancer patients. More research and well-designed, rigorous, large clinical trials are required to address these issues.", 
    "9": "Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is a complex of risk factors for the development of cardiovascular complications and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Pharmacological management of the condition is complex, as multiple drug groups have to be used, as the syndrome itself is multi faceted. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) are chiefly used to manage the hypertensive component of the syndrome. However, recent studies have shown that these drugs may have a role in the non hypertensive aspects of the syndrome as well.", 
    "10": "To evaluate the therapeutic effect of enalapril on total body weight, random blood glucose and serum lipid profile in a rodent model of olanzapine induced MS.", 
    "11": "Three different dosages (1 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day) of oral enalapril were administered (for three weeks) in albino wistar rats, which received prior intra peritoneal olanzapine (for three weeks), and compared against control (normal saline) and standard (olanzapine only and enalapril only) groups. Parameters like total body weight, random blood glucose and serum lipid profile were measured at baseline, at three weeks and at six weeks.", 
    "12": "Enalapril at 20 mg/kg/day was found to be effective in reversing the weight gain, hyperglycaemia and hypercholesterolaemia, without any changes in triglycerides, High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL). 10 mg/kg/day of enalapril prevented any further rise in body weight, blood glucose, total cholesterol and serum triglycerides, after olanzapine was stopped. 1 mg/kg/day of enalapril was ineffective.", 
    "13": "High dose of enalapril may be considered as a component of therapeutic regimens to combat weight gain, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia seen in MS, in addition to its antihypertensive utility. Further rodent and clinical studies may be required to ascertain the same.", 
    "14": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) generates, maintains, and makes worse hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) through its biologically active component angiotensin II (Ang II), that causes vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and structural alterations of the heart and the arteries. A few endogenous vasodilators, kinins, natriuretic peptides, and possibly angiotensin (1-7), exert opposite actions and may provide useful therapeutic agents. As endothelial autacoids, the kinins are potent vasodilators, active natriuretics, and protectors of the endothelium. Indeed, the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) is considered the dominant mechanism for counteracting the detrimental effects of the hyperactive RAS. The 2 systems, RAS and KKS, are controlled by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) that generates Ang II and inactivates the kinins. Inhibitors of ACE can reduce the impact of Ang II and potentiate the kinins, thus contributing to restore the cardiovascular homeostasis. In the last 20 years, ACE-inhibitors (ACE-Is) have become the drugs of first choice for the treatments of the major CVDs. ACE-Is not only reduce blood pressure, as sartans also do, but by protecting and potentiating the kinins, they can reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life for patients with CVDs. This paper provides a brief review of the literature on this topic.", 
    "15": "Patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) have an elevated cardiac event rate, suggesting that these patients may benefit from cardiac medication.", 
    "16": "We evaluated the rates of cardiac medication use 3 months before angiography and 3 months following clinically indicated angiography for MI in patients with no CAD, nonobstructive CAD, and obstructive CAD. We also examined the sex differences in cardiac medication use 3 months following angiography in patients by extent of angiographic CAD.", 
    "17": "We studied patients \u226520 years old with MI undergoing coronary angiography in British Columbia, Canada, from January 1, 2008, to March 31, 2010 (n\u2009=\u20093,841). No CAD, nonobstructive CAD, and obstructive CAD were defined as 0%, 1% to 49%, and \u226550% luminal narrowing in any epicardial coronary artery, respectively. Medication use, 3 months before and 3 months following angiography, was obtained through British Columbia PharmaNet for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers, statins, and antiplatelet agents. Optimal medical therapy (OMT) was defined as filled prescriptions for all three: ACE-Is/ARBs, beta-blockers, and statins.", 
    "18": "Following angiography, in all medication categories except CCBs, patients with no CAD and nonobstructive CAD had significantly lower rates of prescriptions filled than patients with obstructive CAD (all p\u2009<\u20090.001). After adjusting for age and prior medication use, patients with nonobstructive CAD were still less likely to receive these medications than patients with obstructive CAD, including OMT with an odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.25 (95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.36). There were no significant sex differences in medication use 3 months postangiography.", 
    "19": "In post-MI patients, medication use following angiography is significantly lower in nonobstructive CAD than obstructive CAD at 3 months. While sex was not an independent predictor of medication use 3 months post-catheterization, future studies should explore methods of improving medication use in both females and males with nonobstructive CAD post-MI.", 
    "20": "Treatment of patients with stable angina and nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been well characterized. We comparatively evaluated medication use in males and females with stable angina with no CAD, nonobstructive CAD, and obstructive CAD.", 
    "21": "We studied all patients \u226520 years old with stable angina undergoing coronary angiography in British Columbia (BC), Canada, from January 2008 to March 2010 (n\u2009=\u20097,535). No CAD, nonobstructive CAD, and obstructive CAD were defined as 0%, 1%-49%, and \u226550% luminal narrowing in any epicardial coronary artery, respectively. Medication use, 3 months before and 3 months following angiography, was obtained through BC PharmaNet for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers, statins, antiplatelet agents, and prescriptions for all three ACE-I/ARBs, beta-blockers, and statins (combination therapy).", 
    "22": "Following angiography, patients with no and nonobstructive CAD had significantly lower rates of prescription use of all medications, including combination therapy, than patients with obstructive CAD (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Use of ACE-I/ARBs, beta-blockers, statins, and combination therapy did not differ by sex, but females had higher use of CCB in all CAD groups, and clopidogrel in nonobstructive and obstructive CAD groups, compared to males.", 
    "23": "In patients with stable angina, medication use following angiography is low in nonobstructive CAD with only 58.9% prescribed a statin and 19.4% on combination therapy at 3 months. There are no important sex differences in medication use in any CAD category post-angiography. Future studies should explore methods of improving quality of care in patients with nonobstructive CAD.", 
    "24": "Hyperkalemia can be a life-threatening disorder, especially for at-risk patients with heart failure, chronic kidney disease, with diabetes, and patients on certain drugs like renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. There are limited therapeutic options available for hyperkalemia, and they have narrow effectiveness because of their unfavorable side effects profile in long-term and high cost utilization requiring inpatient care. Patiromersorbitex calcium and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are novel potassium-lowering compounds for the treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in at-risk population. These therapeutic agents have shown encouraging results in early phase II and phase III clinical trials. However, there is need to further study their efficacy and safety in heart failure population in order to establish their clinical use. The focus of this chapter will be to promote better understanding of potassium homeostasis in heart failure patients and the mechanistic overview of novel drugs, with emphasis on heart failure population.", 
    "25": "Hypertension is a chronic condition associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Renin is the enzyme responsible for converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Renin inhibitors are a new class of drugs that decrease blood pressure (BP) by preventing the formation of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II.",

    "27": "The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. There was no restriction by language or publication status. We also searched the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for clinical study reports, the Novartis Clinical Study Results Database, bibliographic citations from retrieved references, and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.", 
    "28": "We included randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies evaluating BP lowering efficacy of fixed-dose monotherapy with renin inhibitor compared with placebo for a minimum duration of three to 12 weeks in adult patients with primary hypertension.", 
    "29": "This systematic review is a comprehensive update which includes four additional studies and extensive detail from nine clinical study reports (CSRs) of previously included studies obtained from EMA. The remaining three CSRs are not available.Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. In all cases where there was a difference between the CSR and the published report, data from the CSR was used. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs.", 
    "30": "12 studies (mean duration of eight weeks) in 7439 mostly Caucasian patients (mean age 54 years) with mild-to-moderate uncomplicated hypertension were eligible for inclusion in the review. Aliskiren was the only renin inhibitor evaluated. All included studies were assessed to have high likelihood of attrition, reporting and funding bias.Aliskiren has a dose-related systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) lowering effect as compared with placebo MD with 95% CI: aliskiren 75 mg (MD -2.97, 95% CI -4.76 to -1.18)/(MD -2.05, 95% CI -3.13 to -0.96) mm Hg (moderate-quality evidence), aliskiren 150 mg (MD -5.95, 95% CI -6.85 to -5.06)/ (MD -3.16, 95% CI -3.74 to -2.58) mm Hg (moderate-quality evidence), aliskiren 300 mg (MD -7.88, 95% CI -8.94 to -6.82)/ (MD -4.49, 95% CI -5.17 to -3.82) mm Hg (moderate-quality evidence), aliskiren 600 mg (MD -11.35, 95% CI -14.43 to -8.27)/ (MD -5.86, 95% CI -7.73 to -3.99) mm Hg (low-quality evidence). There was a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure for aliskiren 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg. The blood pressure lowering effect of aliskiren 600 mg was not different from 300 mg (MD -0.61, 95% CI -2.78 to 1.56)/(MD -0.68, 95% CI -2.03 to 0.67). Aliskiren had no effect on blood pressure variability. Due to very limited information available regarding change in heart rate and pulse pressure, it was not possible to meta-analyze these outcomes.Mortality and non-fatal serious adverse events were not increased. This review found that in studies of eight week duration aliskiren may not increase withdrawal due to adverse events (low-quality evidence). Diarrhoea was increased in a dose-dependent manner (RR 7.00, 95% CI 2.48 to 19.72) with aliskiren 600 mg (low-quality evidence). The most frequent adverse events reported were headache, nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, dizziness and fatigue.", 
    "31": "Compared to placebo, aliskiren lowered BP and this effect is dose-dependent. This magnitude of BP lowering effect is similar to that for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). There is no difference in mortality, nonfatal serious adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse effects with short term aliskiren monotherapy. Diarrhoea was considerably increased with aliskiren 600 mg.", 
    "32": "Awareness of CKD remains low in comparison with other chronic diseases, such as diabetes, leading to low use of preventive medications and appropriate testing. The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of care provided to people with and at risk of CKD.",

We assessed multiple quality indicators in people with eGFR=15-59 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), including appropriate risk stratification with albuminuria testing and preventive medication use and screened people with diabetes using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and serum creatinine measurements.", 
    "34": "Among 96,480 adults with eGFR=15-59 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), we found that 17.0% of those without diabetes were appropriately risk stratified with a measure of albuminuria compared with 64.2% of those with diabetes (P<0.001). Of those with eGFR=15-59 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and moderate or severe albuminuria, 63.2% of those without diabetes received an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker compared with 82.1% in those with diabetes (P<0.001). Statin use was also significantly lower in patients with eGFR=15-59 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) without diabetes (39.2%) compared with those with diabetes (64.6%; P<0.001). Among 235,649 adults with diabetes, only 41.8% received a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and 73.2% received a serum creatinine measurement over 1 year.", 
    "35": "We identified large gaps in care, especially in those with CKD but no diabetes. The largest gap was in the prescription of guideline-concordant medication in those with CKD as well as appropriate screening for albuminuria in those with diabetes. Our work illustrates the importance of measuring health system performance as the first step in a quality improvement process to improve care and outcomes in CKD.", 
    "36": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are a common cause of drug-induced angioedema in the United States. Most epidemiologic ACEI angioedema data are from large multicenter clinical trials.",

    "38": "We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all ACEI prescriptions in the outpatient setting of a large academic center between January 1, 2000, and September 30, 2008. We determined frequency, timing, and risk factors for ACEI angioedema within 5 years of prescription. All data were derived from EHR sources, with angioedema defined by EHR reactions of angioedema, swelling, edema, or lip, eye, face, tongue, throat or mouth swelling.", 
    "39": "Among 134,945 patients prescribed an ACEI, 0.7%\u00a0(n\u00a0= 888) developed angioedema during the subsequent 5 years. Sex was similar but patients who developed ACEI angioedema were younger (61.5 vs 62.7 years, P\u00a0= .007). Patients with ACEI angioedema were more likely to have a history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug allergy compared with patients who did not develop angioedema (7.1% vs 4.2%, P < .001). We identified a 0.07% incidence of ACEI angioedema within 1 month of prescription and a 0.23% incidence during the first year. Incidence of angioedema was relatively constant annually over the subsequent 4 years (0.10%\u00a0to 0.12%).", 
    "40": "The incidence of ACEI angioedema within a large EHR is consistent with large clinical trial data. We observed a persistent and relatively constant annual risk; however, angioedema risk factors and underlying genetic and pathophysiological mechanisms require further study."
