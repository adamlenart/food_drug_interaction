    "1": "We identified 511,843 older adults (>65 years) who died in Sweden between 2007 and 2013 and reconstructed their drug prescription history for each of the last 12 months of life through the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. Decedents' characteristics at time of death were assessed through record linkage with the National Patient Register, the Social Services Register, and the Swedish Education Register.", 
    "2": "Over the course of the final year before death, the proportion of individuals exposed to \u226510 different drugs rose from 30.3% to 47.2% (P <.001 for trend). Although older adults who died from cancer had the largest increase in the number of drugs (mean difference, 3.37; 95% confidence interval, 3.35 to 3.40), living in an institution was independently associated with a slower escalation (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.90, 95%\u00a0confidence interval,\u00a0-0.92 to\u00a0-0.87). During the final month before death, analgesics (60.8%), anti-throm-botic agents (53.8%), diuretics (53.1%), psycholeptics (51.2%), and \u03b2-blocking agents (41.1%) were the 5 most commonly used drug classes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins were used by, respectively, 21.4% and 15.8% of all individuals during their final month of life.", 
    "3": "Polypharmacy increases throughout the last year of life of older adults, fueled not only by symptomatic medications but also by long-term preventive treatments of questionable benefit. Clinical guidelines are needed to support physicians in their decision to continue or discontinue medications near the end of life.", 
    "4": "Accumulating evidence suggests that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) medication protects against cognitive decline in the elderly patients. We investigated whether ACE-I use was associated with higher plasma levels of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), possibly indicating improved A\u03b2 clearance from brain to blood.", 
    "5": "We measured and compared plasma concentrations of A\u03b242, A\u03b240, and creatinine in cognitively impaired individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, and mixed probable AD/vascular dementia.", 
    "6": "Plasma A\u03b242 levels and A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratios of participants taking ACE-Is (n = 11) significantly exceeded ( t = 3.1, df = 19, P = .006; U = 24, P = .029, respectively) those not taking ACE-Is (n = 10).",

Future investigations should assess whether a possible ACE-I-induced increase in plasma A\u03b242 indicates improved A\u03b242 clearance from brain that contributes to protection from cognitive decline.", 
    "8": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) patients with comorbid hypertension (HTN) are at a higher risk of developing microvascular and macrovascular DM complications. Through guideline-driven recommendations, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are highly recommended for these patients. Unfortunately, medication adherence to these products, though crucial to achieving therapeutic benefit, is frequently suboptimal. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a patient-centered collaborative communication style that is used to strengthen internal motivation for change that may prove effective in enhancing adherence.", 
    "9": "To examine the effect of an MI telephone intervention conducted by pharmacy students in improving adherence to ACEIs/ARBs among Medicare Advantage Plan (MAP) patients with both DM and HTN.", 
    "10": "A prospective study was conducted among patients enrolled in a Texas MAP. Medical claims data were used to identify patients with DM and HTN, and pharmacy claims were observed to recognize those who filled either an ACEI or an ARB during June 2014. Patients with a 6-month proportion of days covered (PDC) < 0.80 in the previous 6 months were determined nonadherent, and 75% of those were randomly selected to serve as potential subjects for the intervention, while 25% were randomly selected to serve as potential subjects for the control group. The intervention was a telephone call by a pharmacy student on rotation at the health plan, and 5 monthly follow-up calls. Before implementing calls, participating students attended a 3-day MI training course, where their proficiency for MI skills was evaluated. Refill data during the 6-month postintervention were evaluated to examine the intervention effect measured on 3 outcomes: PDC; PDC \u2265 0.80 versus < 0.80; and discontinuation versus continuation. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were constructed to adjust for any imbalances in baseline characteristics, including age, gender, number of other medications, regimen complexity, health low-income subsidy status, prescriber specialty, comorbidities, 6-month previous hospitalization, baseline 6-month PDC, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services risk score.", 
    "11": "A total of 11 students participated in the intervention implementation. Patients receiving calls were randomly selected from those potential subjects for the intervention arm until a target of 250 was reached; 500 controls were randomly selected from the potential subjects for the control arm. The final cohort included in multivariate models consisted of 743 patients. Patients completing the initial call and at least 2 follow-ups were less likely to discontinue (OR = 0.29; 95% CI = 0.15-0.54; P < 0.001) and more likely to be adherent in the linear regression model (\u03b2 = 0.0604, P < 0.001) and the logistic regression model (OR = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.02-2.28; P = 0.009). Other factors significantly associated with better adherence included higher baseline PDC and number of medications. Depression status was significantly associated with lower adherence.", 
    "12": "Patients receiving 2 or more calls had significantly better adherence and less discontinuation during the 6 months following initial calls compared with those who did not receive calls. This finding indicates that an MI-based telephone intervention by pharmacy students may be a promising intervention to improve adherence. Future research should examine the sustainability of the intervention effect for longer time periods and its influence on associated clinical outcomes.",

    "14": "Cell therapy repair strategies using adult mesenchymal stromal cells have shown promising evidence to prevent cardiac deterioration in rodents even in the absence of robust differentiation of the cells into cardiomyocytes. We tested whether increasing doses of porcine adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (pASCs) increase cardiac tissue perfusion in pigs post-myocardial infarction (MI) receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors) and Beta-blockers similarly to patients. Female pigs were subjected to MI induction by sponge permanent occlusion of left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) generating approximately 10% of injured LV area with minimum hemodynamic impact. We assessed tissue perfusion by real time myocardial perfusion echocardiography (RTMPE) using commercial microbubbles before and following pASCs treatment. Four weeks after the occlusion of the left circumflex artery, we transplanted placebo or pASCs (1, 2 and 4x106 cells/Kg BW) into the myocardium. The highest dose of pASCs increased myocardial vessel number and blood flow in the border (56% and 3.7-fold, respectively) and in the remote area (54% and 3.9-fold, respectively) while the non-perfused scar area decreased (up to 38%). We also found an increase of immature collagen fibers, although the increase in total tissue collagen and types I and III was similar in all groups. Our results provide evidence that pASCs-induced stimulation of tissue perfusion and accumulation of immature collagen fibers attenuates adverse remodeling post-MI beyond the normal beneficial effects associated with ACE inhibition and beta-blockade.", 
    "15": "We aimed to evaluate the effects of the five main classes of antihypertensive agents on the long-term outcome of 313 consecutive patients discharged after acute ischemic stroke (36.4% males, age 78.5 \u00b1 6.3 years). One year after discharge, the functional status [evaluated with the modified Rankin scale (mRS)], the occurrence of cardiovascular events, and vital status were recorded. Patients prescribed angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) had lower mRS than patients not prescribed ARBs (1.7 \u00b1 2.0 vs. 2.9 \u00b1 2.5, respectively; p = 0.006). The rates of adverse outcome (mRS 2-6) and cardiovascular events did not differ between patients prescribed each one of the major classes of antihypertensive agents and those not prescribed the respective class. Patients who were prescribed ARBs had lower risk of death during follow-up than patients who did not receive ARBs (9.4 and 26.9%, respectively; p < 0.05). In binary logistic regression analysis, the only independent predictor of all-cause mortality during follow-up was the mRS at discharge (relative risk 1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.25-2.28; p < 0.001). In conclusion, in patients discharged after acute ischemic stroke, administration of ARBs appears to have a more beneficial effect on long-term functional outcome and all-cause mortality than treatment with other classes of antihypertensive agents.", 
    "16": "Hypertension aggravates macrovascular and microvascular diseases and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The current Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines of the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2014) recommends that antihypertensive medication should be initiated concomitantly with lifestyle modification when blood pressure (BP) is \u2a7e130/80\u2009mm\u2009Hg and that target levels of office and home BP should be <130/80\u2009mm\u2009Hg and <125/75\u2009mm\u2009Hg, respectively, in T2DM patients. Considering more favorable metabolic profiles and renoprotective effects than other classes of antihypertensive agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are recommended as the first-line therapy for patients with hypertension and T2DM in JSH 2014. However, the target BP and the first-line therapy remain controversial because of the paucity of high-quality evidence with consistency. It is suggested that BP management should be tailored for each patient with T2DM, based on tolerability and considerations of comorbidity.Hypertension Research advance online publication, 27 April 2017; doi:10.1038/hr.2017.55.", 
    "17": "Prior work suggests that some but not all antihypertensive treatments may benefit cognition and risk for Alzheimer's disease, independent of stroke. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been highlighted as one antihypertensive drug class that may confer greatest benefit.", 
    "18": "The participants comprised 1626 nondemented adults, aged 55-91 years, recruited from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative sites. Three groups were compared: ARB users (HTN-ARBs), other antihypertensive drug users (HTN-Other), and normotensives. In post hoc analyses, we also examined (1) users of ARBs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), (2) users of blood-brain barrier (BBB)-crossing ARBs and users of non-BBB-crossing ARBs, and (3) users of BBB-crossing ARBs and ACEIs (BBB crossers) and users of non-BBB-crossing ARBs and ACEIs (BBB noncrossers). Groups were compared regarding cognition and magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain volume and white matter hyperintensities (WMH), using analysis of covariance and multilevel models.", 
    "19": "At baseline, the HTN-Other group performed worse than normotensives on Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) Immediate Recall (p\u2009=\u20090.002), Delayed Recall (p\u2009<\u20090.001), Recognition Memory (p\u2009=\u20090.001), and Trails A (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and B (p\u2009=\u20090.01). ARB users performed better than the HTN-Other group on Recognition Memory (p\u2009=\u20090.04) and worse than normotensives on Trails A (p\u2009=\u20090.04). The HTN-Other group performed worse than normotensives on Logical Memory Immediate (p\u2009=\u20090.02) and Delayed Recall over the 3-year follow-up (p\u2009=\u20090.007). Over the follow-up period, those taking BBB-crossing ARBs performed better than the HTN-Other group on AVLT Delayed Recall (p\u2009=\u20090.04), Logical Memory Immediate (p\u2009=\u20090.02), and Delayed Recall (p\u2009=\u20090.05). They also had fewer WMH than the HTN-Other group (p\u2009=\u20090.008) and those taking non-BBB-crossing ARBs (p\u2009=\u20090.05). There were no group differences in brain volume. Users of BBB-crossing medications (ARBs or ACEIs) showed better performance on AVLT Delayed Recall over time than all other groups, including normotensives (all p\u2009<\u20090.01), and had less WMH volume over time than the BBB noncrossers group (p\u2009=\u20090.03), although they had more WMH volume than normotensives (p\u2009=\u20090.01). The BBB noncrossers group performed worse than normotensives on Logical Memory Delayed Recall over time (p\u2009=\u20090.01), but the BBB crossers group was not significantly different (p\u2009=\u20090.13).", 
    "20": "Hypertensive participants demonstrated worse baseline memory and executive function, as well as greater memory decline, over the 3-year follow-up than normotensives, unless they were ARB users, who showed preserved memory compared with those taking other antihypertensive drugs. Users of BBB-crossing ARBs showed superior memory performance over time compared with other antihypertensive drug users and had less WMH volume. Users of BBB-crossing medications (ARBs or ACEIs) showed better list-learning memory performance over time than all other groups, including normotensives, and had less WMH volume over time than users of non-BBB-crossing medications. These findings demonstrate that ARBs, especially those of the BBB-crossing variety, are associated with greater memory preservation and less WMH volume than other antihypertensive medications.", 
    "21": "We evaluated the evolution of chronic medical therapy in patients admitted for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) over a 13-year period and to analyze the difference in medical treatment between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. A retrospective study was conducted on patients treated between 2002 and 2015. The use of antiplatelets (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA], ticlopidine, and clopidogrel), oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT), statins and antihypertensives (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE-I]/angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs], \u03b2-blockers [BB]) administration was evaluated. During the study period, 852 CEAs were performed in 681 (79.9%) asymptomatic patients. Prescription rate increased significantly for ASA (+29.2%), clopidogrel (+10.3%), statins (+60.8%), ACE-I/ARBs (+31.1%), and BB (+19.3%; all Ptrend < .05). No significant modification was observed for ticlopidine and OAT (ticlopidine use was abandoned in the recent years, but this difference was not significant due to the small numbers). A lower medication intake was recorded for symptomatic patients when compared with asymptomatic patients, except for OAT and clopidogrel. Our analysis suggests that medical therapy has changed over the years for patients with carotid stenosis. Although this is a big step toward best medical therapy, preoperative drug therapy remains suboptimal in symptomatic patients.", 
    "22": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been reported to benefit from different types of exercises. It has also been shown that the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, and the natural product curcumin are also beneficial in different models of CKD in rats. We assessed the influence of moderate swimming exercise (SE) on rats with adenine-induced CKD, and tested the possible effects of lisinopril and/or curcumin thereon using several physiological, biochemical, histopathological and immunohistochemical parameters. Rats (either sedentary or subjected to SE) were randomly divided into several groups, and given for five weeks either normal food or food mixed with adenine (0.25% w/w) to induce CKD. Some of these groups were also concomitantly treated orally with curcumin (75 mg/kg), or lisinopril (10 mg/kg) and were subjected to moderate SE (45 min/day three days each week). Rats fed adenine showed the typical biochemical, histopathological signs of CKD such as elevations in blood pressure, urinary albumin / creatinine ratio, and plasma urea, creatinine, indoxyl sulfate and phosphorus. SE, curcumin or lisinopril, given singly, significantly ameliorated all the adenine-induced actions. Administering curcumin or lisinopril with SE improved the histopathology of the kidneys, a salutary effect not seen with SE alone. Combining SE to the nephroprotective agents' curcumin or lisinopril might offer additional nephroprotection.", 
    "23": "Although it is known that 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) displays vasoprotective activity in mice, as yet the effect of MNA on endothelial function has not been demonstrated in vivo. Here, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we profile the effects of MNA on endothelial phenotype in mice with atherosclerosis (ApoE/LDLR(-/-)) in vivo, in comparison to angiotensin (Ang) -converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (perindopril), with known vasoprotective activity. On a biochemical level, we analyzed whether MNA- or perindopril-induced improvement in endothelial function results in changes in ACE/Ang II-ACE2/Ang-(1-7) balance, and L-arginine/asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio. Endothelial function and permeability were evaluated in the brachiocephalic artery (BCA) in 4-month-old ApoE/LDLR(-/-) mice that were non-treated or treated for 1 month or 2 months with either MNA (100 mg/kg/day) or perindopril (10 mg/kg/day). The 3D IntraGate(\u00ae)FLASH sequence was used for evaluation of BCA volume changes following acetylcholine (Ach) administration, and for relaxation time (T1) mapping around BCA to assess endothelial permeability using an intravascular contrast agent. Activity of ACE/Ang II and ACE2/Ang-(1-7) pathways as well as metabolites of L-arginine/ADMA pathway were measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based methods. In non-treated 6-month-old ApoE/LDLR(-/-) mice, Ach induced a vasoconstriction in BCA that amounted to -7.2%. 2-month treatment with either MNA or perindopril resulted in the reversal of impaired Ach-induced response to vasodilatation (4.5 and 5.5%, respectively) and a decrease in endothelial permeability (by about 60% for MNA-, as well as perindopril-treated mice). Improvement of endothelial function by MNA and perindopril was in both cases associated with the activation of ACE2/Ang-(1-7) and the inhibition of ACE/Ang II axes as evidenced by an approximately twofold increase in Ang-(1-9) and Ang-(1-7) and a proportional decrease in Ang II and its active metabolites. Finally, MNA and perindopril treatment resulted in an increase in L-arginine/ADMA ratio by 107% (MNA) and 140% (perindopril), as compared to non-treated mice. Functional and biochemical endothelial profiling in ApoE/LDLR(-/-) mice in vivo revealed that 2-month treatment with MNA (100 mg/kg/day) displayed a similar profile of vasoprotective effect as 2-month treatment with perindopril (10 mg/kg/day): i.e., the improvement in endothelial function that was associated with the beneficial changes in ACE/Ang II-ACE2/Ang (1-7) balance and in L-arginine/ADMA ratio in plasma."
