    "1": "To investigate whether interindividual variability in the response to ACE inhibitors is explained by the \"ACE phenotype\"-for example, variability in plasma ACE concentration, activity, and conformation and/or the degree of ACE inhibition in each individual.", 
    "2": "The ACE phenotype was determined in plasma of 14 patients with hypertension treated chronically for 4 weeks with 40 mg enalapril (E) or 20 mg E + 16 mg candesartan (EC) and in 20 patients with hypertension treated acutely with a single dose (20 mg) of E with or without pretreatment with hydrochlorothiazide. The ACE phenotyping included (1) plasma ACE concentration; (2) ACE activity (with 2 substrates: Hip-His-Leu and Z-Phe-His-Leu and calculation of their ratio); (3) detection of ACE inhibitors in patient's blood (indicator of patient compliance) and the degree of ACE inhibition (ie, adherence); and (4) ACE conformation.", 
    "3": "Enalapril reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure in most patients; however, 20% of patients were considered nonresponders. Chronic treatment results in 40% increase in serum ACE concentrations, with the exception of 1 patient. There was a trend toward better response to ACEI among patients who had a higher plasma ACE concentration.", 
    "4": "Due to the fact that \"20% of patients do not respond to ACEI by blood pressure drop,\" the initial blood ACE level could not be a predictor of blood pressure reduction in an individual patient. However, ACE phenotyping provides important information about conformational and kinetic changes in ACE of individual patients, and this could be a reason for resistance to ACE inhibitors in some nonresponders.", 
    "5": "The United States is experiencing its greatest life expectancy ever. Nonetheless, the general health of the US population is far from at an all-time high. An important contributor to the pandemic of cardiovascular disease is that overweight and obesity are also the major determinants of metabolic syndrome, an all too common and all too serious clinical and public health challenge. Clinicians have traditionally evaluated each of the major risk factors contributing to metabolic syndrome on an individual basis. There is evidence, however, that the risk factors are more than additive. The overlap of these factors in each disease state, resulting in increased atherogenic risks, is worth examining as a broader entity rather than separately. While therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLCs) should be strongly recommended, clinicians should not let the perfect be the enemy of the possible. Evidence-based doses of statins, aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers should be prescribed as adjuncts, not alternatives, to TLCs. In fact, there is cogent evidence that the benefits of these pharmacologic therapies may also be at least additive.", 
    "6": "We explored the significance of the expression of hepatitis E virus (HEV) open reading frame 3 (ORF3) in hepatitis E rat models. We also investigated its diagnostic value. Forty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were infected with HEV and 10 uninfected rats were selected for the control group. Rats were sacrificed at 14, 21, 35 and 70 days after infection. They were divided into 4 groups: Model group 1, model group 2, model group 3 and model group 4. ORF3 protein expression level in liver tissue, level of adipokines [fatty acid synthase (FAS), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor 2 (ACE-2)], Th1/Th2 cells balance [interferon (IFN), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Th1/Th2] and the level of immune outcome (levels of CD4(+), CD8(+) T lymphocytes and CD4(+)/CD8(+)) were measured and compared among groups. Our results showed that HEV IgG and HEV RNA levels in the model group 3 were higher than those in the other 3 groups. Compared with the control group, expression level of ORF3 protein in the liver tissue as well as Fas and TIMP levels were significantly higher in the model group 3. ACE-2 level was significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). In the model group 3, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and Th1/Th2 levels were meaningfully higher than those of the control group. CD4(+) T lymphocytes and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio were obviously lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). The expression level of ORF3 was positively correlated with levels of Fas, TIMP-2 and Th1/Th2. It was negatively correlated with ACE-2 and CD4(+)/CD8(+) levels (P<0.05). We concluded that ORF3 expression level was directly related to severity and prognosis, and that ORF3 protein can be considered as a sensitive and specific diagnostic index.",

Both male and female patients of age between 30 and 80 years with systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 130 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) above 80 mmHg were enrolled in the study. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), beta-blocker (\u03b2B), calcium-channel blocker (CCB), diuretics (D), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as well as \u03b1-blocker classes of antihypertensive drugs were used. These drugs were used as monotherapy as well as combination therapy. The study was conducted for 4 months (July-October). After 4 months, patients were assessed for efficacy by monitoring blood pressure (BP) and tolerability by assessing safety profile on renal function, liver function as well as lipid profile.", 
    "9": "Significant control in mean BP by all drug groups was observed in \"both groups that is patients with diabetes and without diabetes.\" The efficacy and tolerability data revealed that in diabetic patients with hypertension, the highest decrease in SBP and DBP was observed using monotherapy with ACEI, two-drug combination therapy with ACEI plus diuretic, ARBs plus diuretic, ACEI plus CCBs, three-drug combination therapy with ACEI plus CCBs plus diuretic, and four drug combination therapy with ACEI plus CCBs plus diuretic plus \u03b2Bs, ARB's plus CCBs plus diuretic plus \u03b2Bs while in NDPs, monotherapy with diuretic, two-drug combination therapy with ACEI plus CCBs, ACEI plus \u03b2Bs, three-drug combination therapy with \u03b2Bs plus ACEI plus D was found more effective in controlling SBP as well as DBP.

Cardiovascular comorbidity and diabetes were present in 13 and 15% of women, and in 18 and 20% of men. Overall BP reductions from 2001-2002 to 2007-2008 were 9.0/3.1\u200ammHg; greater in women than men, with advancing age, and in patients with comorbidity (all P\u200a<\u200a0.001).

The mean age was 66.1\u2009\u00b1\u200912.2\u2009years. At baseline an MRA was prescribed to 741 (56%) patients. Patients who were prescribed MRAs at baseline were younger, more often male, had higher body mass index, lower sodium, higher proportion of hypertension history and ACEi/ARB prescription (all P < 0.05). Of the 1049 patients who completed the baseline plus the 9 month visit, 585 (56%) had an MRA prescribed at baseline and 662 (63%) had an MRA prescribed at 9 months. Among the 585 patients with MRA at baseline, 91 (16%) had discontinued therapy and among the 461 (44%) patients without MRA at baseline 168 (36%) had initiated therapy subsequently. MRA discontinuation was more likely in subjects with higher left ventricular ejection fraction and NYHA class III/IV (P < 0.05 for both). MRA prescription both at baseline and 9 months was not associated with the outcome of death or heart failure hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.66-1.58; P\u2009=\u20090.93).",

    "26": "In experimental diabetic and nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) combination therapy reduce proteinuria and prevent structural lesions more effectively than either drug alone. Consistently, in humans, a multidrug individually tailored antiproteinuric treatment based on combination therapy with maximum tolerated doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (\"Remission Clinic\") reduced proteinuria and prevented end-stage renal disease more effectively than angiotensin-converting enzyme/angiotensin receptor blockers monotherapy, in particular in subjects with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease. Fixed doses of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or renin inhibitor added-on losartan failed to exert any additional renoprotective effect as compared with losartan monotherapy in patients with type 2\u00a0diabetes and overt nephropathy. However, the VA NEPHRON D study found that losartan and lisinopril combination therapy reduced by 34\u00a0% the risk of pre-defined reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate, end-stage renal disease or death as compared to losartan in 1448\u00a0type 2\u00a0diabetes patients with overt nephropathy. Unfortunately, treatment effect failed to achieve the nominal significance (P=0.07) because of premature trial interruption. Thus, the Remission Clinic protocol is the most powerful tool to prevent progression to end-stage renal disease in nondiabetic proteinuric chronic kidney disease. Results of the ongoing VALID trial will show whether this approach can be safely extended to type 2\u00a0diabetes patients.",

The use of TZB is commonly associated with cardiotoxicity manifesting as asymptomatic decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or overt heart failure. Several studies demonstrated favorable effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers (BBs) in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. We hypothesize that patients, randomized to receive an ACE inhibitor or a BB during trastuzumab therapy for breast cancer, will maintain a higher LVEF than patients randomized to placebo.",

The primary objectives include (1) comparison of incidence of cardiotoxicity and (2) comparison of LVEF as a continuous variable in between the arms. Cardiotoxicity was defined as an absolute decrease in LVEF from baseline of \u226510% at follow-up or an absolute decrease of \u22655% in LVEF from baseline for individuals with <50% LVEF at follow-up. The target accrual is 468 participants, representing patients both with and without anthracycline exposure. The enrollment is completed. The trial is co-sponsored by University of South Florida and National Cancer Institute. The LVEF is being evaluated by echocardiography or multigated acquisition scan.",

At baseline, of 8399 patients, 3634 (43.3%) had a prior MI and 4796 (57.1%) had a history of any coronary artery disease. Among all patients, compared with enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan reduced the risk of the primary outcome (HR 0.80 [0.73-0.87], P<.001), the broader composite (HR 0.83 [0.76-0.90], P<.001) and the coronary composite (HR 0.83 [0.75-0.92], P<.001). Although each of the components of the coronary composite occurred less frequently in the sacubitril/valsartan group, compared with the enalapril group, only CV death was reduced significantly.",
