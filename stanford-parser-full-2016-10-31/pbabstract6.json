    "0": "The Australian National Heart Foundation Guidelines have been developed to guide clinicians on how to best manage chronic heart failure (CHF) patients according to the current best available evidence. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the proportion of patients prescribed evidence-based therapy (EBT) for CHF on discharge at this Australian metropolitan hospital and factors affecting its prescribing. The secondary aims are to examine the proportion of patients prescribed EBT on discharge on cardiac wards compared to medical wards and to explore the role of the pharmacist in the management of these patients.", 
    "1": "A retrospective audit of patients' medical notes who were admitted consecutively for CHF management was conducted over 6\u00a0months to examine their management.", 
    "2": "The results showed at discharge, a total of 52% of patients were discharged on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, 49% were discharged on \u03b2-blockers, 15% were on Aldosterone receptor antagonists, 90% were discharged on diuretics, and 29% were discharged on Digoxin. The main determinants of prescribing EBT on discharge were the presence of prescribing contraindications and patients' comorbidities. Patients discharged from cardiac wards were more likely to be prescribed EBT than if discharged on medical wards. Furthermore, in the subset of the cohort who was reviewed by a pharmacist during admission, a higher percentage of patients were discharged on EBT compared with those who did not have a pharmaceutical input.", 
    "3": "This study highlighted existing gaps between the National CHF Guidelines and clinical prescribing practice in this hospital. Patients who were discharged from cardiac wards were more likely to be prescribed medications concordant with the guidelines, and there is further opportunity for pharmacists to assist in closing gaps in prescribing practice by the promotion of adherence to these guidelines.", 
    "4": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of end stage renal disease. The comprehensive management of DKD depends on combined target-therapies for hyperglycemia, hypertension, albuminuria, and hyperlipaemia, etc. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, the most recently developed oral hypoglycemic agents acted on renal proximal tubules, suppress glucose reabsorption and increase urinary glucose excretion. Besides improvements in glycemic control, they presented excellent performances in direct renoprotective effects and the cardiovascular (CV) safety by decreasing albuminuria and the independent CV risk factors such as body weight and blood pressure, etc. Simultaneous use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers are novel strategies to slow the progression of DKD via reducing inflammatory and fibrotic markers induced by hyperglycaemia more than either drug alone. The available population and animal based studies have described SGLT2 inhibitors plus RAAS blockers. The present review was to systematically review the potential renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors combined with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and especially the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers.", 
    "5": "The present study aimed to investigate temporal trends in myocardial infarction (MI) presentation with or without ST-segment elevation (STE) and the association with use of cardioprotective drugs prior to admission.", 
    "6": "Using individual-level linkage of data from Danish nationwide registries, we identified all patients 30 years or older admitted with a first-time MI in the period 2003-2012, and their use of cardioprotective drugs 6 months prior to admission. We calculated incidence rates per 100.000 person-years (IRs) of STEMI and NSTEMI. We identified 22,247 patients admitted with STEMI and 50,403 with NSTEMI. IRs for NSTEMI decreased by 35% from 194 in 2003 to 126 in 2012, whereas IRs for STEMI peaked in 2007 and subsequently declined from 71 to 65. Preadmission use of cardioprotective drugs increased in both groups from 2003 to 2012. Patients admitted with STEMI had odds ratio (OR) 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.67) for preadmission use of aspirin compared with patients admitted with NSTEMI. Corresponding ORs were 0.82 (CI 0.78-0.87) for statins, 0.87 (CI 0.82-0.91) for beta-blockers, 0.89 (CI 0.85-0.92) for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and 0.52 (CI 0.44-0.61) for thienopyridines. Also, 30-day and one-year mortality declined in patients both admitted with STEMI and NSTEMI.", 
    "7": "The IRs of MI declined between 2003 and 2012, primarily driven by a 35% reduction in IRs for NSTEMI whereas IRs for STEMI declined after 2007. Preadmission use of cardioprotective drugs increased markedly and was associated with lower ORs of presenting with STEMI than NSTEMI.", 
    "8": "Use of antihypertensive medication (AHM) is potentially associated with a reduced risk of dementia. Both calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are suggested to have a more pronounced protective effect. We aimed to study the association between different classes of AHM and dementia in older people.", 
    "9": "A subgroup of community-dwelling older people using AHM included in the 'Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care' randomized controlled trial was studied. Incident dementia rates in participants with different AHM classes (mono and combination therapy) were compared with dementia rates in participants with any other AHM.", 
    "10": "At baseline, 1951 participants (55.3%) used AHM [mean age, 74.4 year (SD 2.5); mean SBP, 156.4\u200ammHg (SD 21.5)]. In total, 986 participants (50.5%) used \u03b2-blockers, 798 diuretics (40.9%), 623 angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors (31.9%), 522 CCBs (26.8%), and 402 ARBs (20.6%). After 6.7 years (interquartile range 6.0-7.3) of follow-up, 136 participants (7.0%) developed dementia. Both use of CCBs [hazard ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.36-0.87] and ARBs (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.37-0.98) were independently associated with a decreased risk of dementia. The association of CCBs with dementia was most apparent in participants without a history of cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.81) and with uncontrolled hypertension (hazard ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.11-0.61). SBP was not significantly lower in participants using CCBs or ARBs.", 
    "11": "Both use of CCBs and ARBs are independently associated with a decreased risk of dementia in older people.", 
    "12": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered to have similar renoprotective effects; so far there has been no consensus about their priorities. This study aimed to compare ACEIs and ARBs for major renal outcomes and survival in a 15-year cohort of adults with diabetes.", 
    "13": "This study utilized Taiwan's medical and pharmacy claims data in the Longitudinal Cohort of Diabetes Patients. The primary outcome was long-term dialysis, and secondary outcomes were hospitalization for acute kidney injury, hospitalization for hyperkalemia, all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and non-cardiovascular death. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for outcomes comparing ACEIs with ARBs. We conducted subgroup analyses and interaction tests among patients with different age and comorbid diseases.", 
    "14": "A total of 34,043 patients received ACEIs and 23,772 patients received ARBs. No differences were found for primary or secondary outcomes in the main analyses. ACEIs showed significantly lower hazard than ARBs for long-term dialysis among patients with cardiovascular disease (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66-0.97, interaction P = 0.003) or chronic kidney disease (0.81, 0.71-0.93, interaction P = 0.001).", 
    "15": "Our analyses show similar effects of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes. However, ACEIs might provide additional renoprotective effects among patients who have cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease.", 
    "16": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is a signaling pathway which responsible in the blood pressure regulation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is one of the key elements responsible for the hypertensive mechanism. It converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II. The discovery history of the ACE inhibitory activity assay method has been through a long stage for decades and development continues until today. The ACE inhibitory activity has become an effective screening method in the search for new antihypertensive agents from herbal plants. Some of in vitro assay methods were used to examine the activity of ACE inhibitors based on the substrate usage, such as; Cushman and Cheung Method using a substrate hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (HHL), Holmquist method using a substrate furanacryloyl-tripeptide, Elbl and Wagner method using a substrate benzoil-[l-14C] glicyl-L-histidine-L-leucine, Carmel and Yaron method using a substrate o-aminobenzoylglycyl-p-nitrophenylalanilproline, and Lam method using 3-hydroxybutyrylglycyl-glycyl-glycine as substrate. Several different methods to measure the results of enzymatic reactions or separating substrate with products, including spectrophotometric, fluorometric, high-performance liquid chromatography, electrophoresis, and radiochemistry. Application of the test method for screening the ACE inhibitors activity and investigation of active compounds from natural products can be done easily with this method, it is very helpful in research because the results obtained are simple, accurate, and rapid.", 
    "17": "The purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate the long-term effects of flosequinan on the morbidity and mortality of patients with severe chronic heart failure.", 
    "18": "Flosequinan was the first oral vasodilator to be used in the clinic to augment the effects of digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure. However, the drug activated neurohormonal systems and exerted both positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, raising concerns about its safety during long-term use.", 
    "19": "Following a run-in period designed to minimize the risk of tachycardia, we randomly assigned 2,354 patients in New York Heart Association functional class III to IV heart failure and with an ejection fraction\u00a0\u226435% to receive long-term treatment with placebo or flosequinan (75 or 100 mg/day) in addition to their usual therapy. The primary outcome was\u00a0all-cause mortality.", 
    "20": "The trial was terminated after a recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, because during an average of 10 months of follow-up, 192 patients died in the placebo group and 255 patients died in the flosequinan group (hazard ratio: 1.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.15 to 1.67; p\u00a0= 0.0006). Flosequinan also increased the risk of disease progression, which was paralleled by drug-related increases in heart rate and neurohormonal activation. However, during the first month, patients in the flosequinan group were more likely to report an improvement in well-being and less likely to experience worsening heart failure. Similarly, during the month following drug withdrawal at the end of the trial, patients withdrawn from flosequinan were more likely than those withdrawn from placebo to report symptoms of or to require treatment for worsening heart failure.", 
    "21": "Although flosequinan produced meaningful symptomatic benefits during short- and long-term treatment,\u00a0the\u00a0drug increased the risk of death in patients with severe chronic heart failure.", 
    "22": "The aim of this study was to assess the impact of regulatory action taken in June 2014 on the co-prescribing of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers in UK primary care.", 
    "23": "RAS blocker prescriptions, issued between 01/01/2009-30/06/2015, were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to estimate the quarterly prevalence (number of patients with at least one co-prescription) and incidence (number of patients first receiving a RAS blocker co-prescription) of co-prescribing. Two different RAS blockers prescribed on the same day constituted a co-prescription.", 
    "24": "A total of 880\u00a0364 patients were prescribed a single RAS blocker during the study period. Prevalence of co-prescribing increased from 4812 patients per million person-years in Q1 2009 to 4865 in Q1 2010. A reduction then occurred decreasing to 2901 patients per million person-years in Q2 2014 when the EU review concluded and continued to decrease thereafter despite a continued increase in the prevalence of prescribing of a single RAS blocker. Incidence of new co-prescribing decreased from 454 patients per million person-years in Q1 2009 to 159 in Q2 2014, but remained relatively constant at ~119 patients per million person-years on average after the EU review concluded. A total of 96% of co-prescriptions were for an ACE inhibitor\u00a0+\u00a0ARB, and 4% accounted for an ACE inhibitor or ARB\u00a0+\u00a0renin inhibitor.", 
    "25": "Recently, there has been a decrease in the prevalence and incidence of RAS blocker co-prescribing. Reassuringly, overall co-prescribing reduced in line with recommendations, although there was a decreasing trend prior to this likely due in part to prior publication of the data used in the EU review. \u00a9 2017 Crown copyright. Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", 
    "26": "Despite significant therapeutic advances, patients with chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) remain at high risk for heart failure progression and death. The PARADIGM-HF study, the largest outcome trial in HFrEF, has shown improved cardiovascular outcomes with sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto\u00ae, Novartis), previously known as LCZ696, compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy, possibly leading us to a new era for heart failure treatment. Sacubitril/valsartan represents a first-in-class drug acting through inhibition of angiotensin receptor and neprilysin, thus modulating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and vasoactive substances such as natriuretic peptides. This approach can be considered a \"paradigm shift\" from neurohumoral inhibition to neurohumoral modulation. Based on the PARADIGM-HF results, the European Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines proposed a substitution of ACE-inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker therapy rather than an \"add-on\" strategy in HFrEF. Sacubitril/valsartan can be considered a milestone in cardiovascular therapy, like aspirin, statins, beta-blockers. Of course there are many questions that arise spontaneously from this trial, three recognized experts can help us to answer them.", 
    "27": "To analyze the current usage of optimal medical therapy (OMT), influencing factors, and the predictive value of OMT for all-cause mortality in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with different subgroups.", 
    "28": "A total of 3176 CAD patients confirmed by coronary angiography were included. OMT was defined as the combination of anti-platelet drugs, statins, beta blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Factors for OMT and its prognostic value were analyzed in CAD patients across different subgroups.", 
    "29": "Out of 3176 patients, only 39.8% (n = 1265) were on OMT at discharge. Factors associated with OMT at discharge were pre-admission OMT and discharge department. All-cause mortality occurred in 6.8% (n = 217) of patients. Multivariate analyses indicated that OMT was significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.45-0.95; P = 0.025). Sub-group analyses indicate that male acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients were more likely to receive survival benefits with OMT at discharge. The positive impact of OMT at discharge was more apparent after 24 months, regardless of revascularization therapy. Four-drug combination of OMT was superior to 3-drug combination therapy in ACS patients but not in stable patients.", 
    "30": "OMT was associated with significant improvement in survival in patients with CAD. The positive impact of OMT was distinct in the CAD patients with different characteristics.", 
    "31": "This study evaluated the potential effect of hydration intensity on the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with renal insufficiency.", 
    "32": "All eligible patients were included and stratified according to hydration intensity defined as saline hydration volume to body weight tertiles: <10.21 mL/kg, 10.21 to <17.86 mL/kg, and \u2a7e17.86 mL/kg.", 
    "33": "In total, 84 (6.7%) of 1254 patients developed contrast-induced nephropathy: 6.2% in the ACEI/ARB group versus 10.8% in the non-ACEI/ARB group ( P=0.029), with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-1.73, P=0.735). The incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy was lower in the ACEI/ARB group than in the non-ACEI/ARB group in the second tertile ( P=0.031), while not significantly different in the first ( P=0.701) and third ( P=0.254) tertiles. ACEIs/ARBs were independently associated with a lower contrast-induced nephropathy risk (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09-0.74, P=0.012) and long-term all-cause death (hazard ratio 0.461, 95% CI 0.282-0.755, P=0.002) only in the second hydration volume to body weight tertile.", 
    "34": "The effects of ACEIs/ARBs on contrast-induced nephropathy risk vary according to saline hydration intensity in chronic kidney disease patients, and may further reduce contrast-induced nephropathy risk in patients administered moderate saline hydration."
