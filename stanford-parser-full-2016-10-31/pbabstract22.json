The research on the antihypertensive medicines consumption is important for highlighting the ever increasing impact of hypertension among the population.", 
    "1": "The methods used in this research were the following: marketing research, method of sampling, descriptive methods, retrospective analysis, method of comparison.", 
    "2": "The results showed that the drugs containing the active substances of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors class had had significant increases in quantitative and value sales, bringing substantial revenues to pharmacies. From the quantitative perspective, the best-selling products were those containing Enalaprilum, while in terms of value, the best-selling medicines were those containing Perindoprilum. We evidenced that spectacular sales were also achieved for products that have Lisinoprilum, respectively Captoprilum, as active substances. The largest quantities were marketed for the Captopril Terapia\u00ae product and the highest earnings were recorded for the Prestarium\u00ae medicine.", 
    "3": "This paper approaches an interesting and topical issue, which can be helpful to professionals (pharmacists, doctors) and other categories, such as economists, statisticians, representatives of companies manufacturing medicines, as well as to hypertensive patients, as it could be used to warn population regarding the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and, at the same time, trace sales trends in order to accomplish profitable business plans.", 
    "4": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin II (Ang II) system by AT1 blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors retards the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by reducing albuminuria/proteinuria. However, many patients with CKD suffer from residual albuminuria/proteinuria, which is an independent risk factor for CKD progression. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of pitavastatin, one of the adjunctive agents to ARBs, on the reduction of albuminuria/proteinuria and further renoprotection mediated by telmisartan in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "5": "Forty-two-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were grouped randomly and received 8 weeks of treatments with vehicle, telmisartan, pitavastatin or a combination of telmisartan and pitavastatin. Both albuminuria and proteinuria were inhibited significantly in the telmisartan-treated group, but an obviously residual albuminuria was maintained. The combination treatment with telmisartan and pitavastatin displayed a more effective decrease in albuminuria and proteinuria, even to the normal level. Enhanced nephroprotection was also observed in this combination group, which was independent of the cholesterol-lowering effects. Further mechanistic studies revealed that the combination therapy greatly attenuated the expression of intrarenal Ang II and AT1, thereby decreasing the activation of TGF-\u03b2-Smad and NF-\u03baB and inhibiting fibrosis and inflammation.", 
    "6": "Adjunctive therapy with pitavastatin dramatically reduced residual albuminuria/proteinuria and enhanced nephroprotection, likely by downregulating the expression of intrarenal Ang II and AT1. It could be concluded that statins might be a promising adjunctive therapeutic agent to conventional ARB treatment in hypertensive renal damage.", 
    "7": "We hypothesized that the testis-specific isoform of angiotensin-converting enzyme (tACE) is released during bovine sperm capacitation, and its peptidase activity is required for capacitation. Specific objectives of this study were to (i) develop an anti-tACE antibody; (ii) characterize expression of tACE in bovine testes and sperm; and (iii) determine the role of tACE in capacitation. A 110-kDa protein, consistent with the mass of tACE, was detected in sperm extract by our anti-tACE immunoserum. This immunotarget localized at the acrosomal region and principal piece, but was only expressed in testis of mature bulls. When bull sperm were incubated in Sp-TALP (0 and 4\u2009hr) plus 10\u2009\u00b5g/ml heparin (capacitation group) or 10\u2009\u00b5g/ml heparin\u2009+\u200910\u2009\u00b5M captopril (an ACE inhibitor) for 4\u2009hr, the number of acrosome-reacted (40.1 vs. 24.0%, respectively) and hyperactivated (15.0 vs. 9.7%) sperm increased, and tyrosine phosphoprotein content were higher (p\u2009<\u20090.05) for sperm in heparin alone. tACE activity was also higher (0.04\u2009U/ml; p\u2009<\u20090.01) in incubation medium of sperm exposed to heparin compared to 0- and 4-hr incubation controls or heparin\u2009+\u2009captopril conditions (0, 0.005, and 0.009\u2009U/ml, respectively). Furthermore, capacitation-associated shedding of a portion of tACE into the medium decreased sperm content of the 110-kDa tACE, but concurrently increased the abundance of a 60-kDa tACE variant. Thus, a portion of the extracellular region of tACE (containing its catalytic site) is released from bovine sperm during capacitation, and tACE activity may be required for sperm capacitation.", 
    "8": "The PARADIGM-HF trial showed that sacubitril-valsartan, an ARB-neprilysin inhibitor, is more effective than enalapril for some patients with heart failure (HF). It is uncertain what proportion of patients with HF would be eligible for sacubitril-valsartan in clinical practice.", 
    "9": "Between 2001 and 2014, 6131 patients consecutively referred to a community HF clinic with suspected HF were assessed. The criteria required to enter the randomized phase of PARADIGM-HF, including symptoms, NT-proBNP, and current treatment with or without target doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, were applied to identify the proportion of patients eligible for sacubitril-valsartan. Recognizing the diversity of clinical opinion and guideline recommendations concerning this issue, entry criteria were applied singly and in combination. Of 1396 patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (\u226440%, HFrEF) and contemporary measurement of NT-proBNP, 379 were on target doses of an ACE inhibitor or ARB at their initial visit and, of these, 172 (45%) fulfilled the key entry criteria for the PARADIGM-HF trial. Lack of symptoms (32%) and NT-proBNP <600 ng/L (49%) were common reasons for failure to fulfil criteria. A further 122 patients became eligible during follow-up (n = 294, 21%). However, if background medication and doses were ignored, then 701 (50%) were eligible initially and a further 137 became eligible during follow-up.", 
    "10": "Of patients with HFrEF referred to a clinic such as ours, only 21% fulfilled the PARADIGM-HF randomization criteria, on which the ESC Guidelines are based; this proportion rises to 60% if background medication is ignored.", 
    "11": "Aphloia theiformis (Vahl.) Benn. (AT) is traditionally used in Sub-Saharan African countries including Mauritius as a biomedicine for the management of several diseases. However, there is a dearth of experimental studies to validate these claims. We endeavoured to evaluate the inhibitory effects of crude aqueous extract as traditionally used together with the crude methanol extracts of AT leaves on urease, angiotensin (I) converting enzyme (ACE), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), cholesterol esterase (CEase), glycogen phosphorylase a (GPa), and glycation in vitro. The crude extract showing potent activity against the studied enzymes was further partitioned using different solvents of increasing polarity. The enzyme inhibitory and antiglycation activities of each fraction was assessed. Kinetic of inhibition of the active crude extract/fractions on the aforementioned enzymes was consequently determined using Lineweaver-Burk plots. An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC-UV/MS) system was used to establish the phytochemical profile of AT. The real time cell analysis system (iCELLigence\u2122) was used to monitor any cellular cytotoxicity of AT. Crude methanolextract (CME) was a potent inhibitor of the studied enzymes, with IC50 ranging from 696.22 to 19.73\u03bcg/mL. CME (82.5%) significantly (p<0.05) inhibited glycation and was comparable to aminoguanidine (81.5%). Ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions of CME showed non-competitive, competitive, and uncompetitive mode of inhibition against ACE, CEase, and AChE respectively. Mangiferin, a xanthone glucoside was present in CME, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol fractions. Active extract/fractions were found to be non-cytotoxic (IC50>20\u03bcg/mL) according to the U.S National Cancer Institute plant screening program. This study has established baseline data that tend to justify the traditional use of AT and open new avenues for future biomedicine development.", 
    "12": "Co-administration of a diuretic or calcium channel blocker with an ACE inhibitor are both preferred combinations in patients with hypertensive chronic kidney disease (CKD). According to the available evidence, it is still unknown which combination plays a more active role in renal protection. We hypothesised that a combination of fosinopril and benidipine may delay the progression of CKD more effectively than a combination of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ).", 
    "13": "This study will be a multicentred, prospective, double-blind, randomised parallel controlled trial for hypertensive CKD patients in China. Patients will be randomised to one of two treatment groups: a combination of benidipine 4-8\u2005mg/day and fosinopril 20\u2005mg/day; or a combination of HCTZ 12.5-25\u2005mg/day and fosinopril 20\u2005mg/day. Patients will be followed up for 24\u2005months after a month's fosinopril run-in. There will be dose-titration after 1 and 2\u2005months. The primary endpoint is changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline to month 24. Secondary endpoints include changes in home blood pressure (BP), ambulatory BP, proteinuria, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, and composite renal events in 24\u2005months. Inclusion criteria are: age 18-80\u2005years, non-dialysis CKD patients with eGFR >30\u2005mL/min/1.73\u2005m(2), home BP >130\u2005mm\u2005Hg systolic or BP >80\u2005mm\u2005Hg diastolic at the screening and randomisation, and 24\u2005hour proteinuria <3.5\u2005g. Principal exclusions are hypertensive crisis, transplantation, cancer, severe diabetes complications, hyperkalaemia and severe allergy. The required sample size was 511 patients for detecting a difference in the change of eGFR (one sided \u03b1=0.025, power 1-\u03b2=0.90).",

    "16": "This review assessed the utility of vasopressin and vasopressin analogues for the treatment of refractory hypotension associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the perioperative setting. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, and ProQuest. Six randomized controlled trials met eligibility criteria. In the perioperative setting, continued use of ACE inhibitors within 24 hours before surgery remains controversial. Authors of the reviewed studies suggested that the morning dose of the ACE inhibitor be held, and those patients experienced decreased catecholamine use postoperatively and shorter duration of decreased mean arterial pressure. No incidence of refractory hypertension from withholding the morning dose of the ACE inhibitor was mentioned. All of the patients receiving vasopressin demonstrated improved hemodynamic stability with small, intermittent doses, without profound ischemic changes. For management (prevention and treatment) of ACE inhibitor-associated hypotension in the perioperative setting, all studies showed statistically significant success with vasopressin or vasopressin analogues for improvement of systemic blood pressures. Before vasopressin is widely accepted as a standard of care, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and assess the general utility of vasopressin in surgical populations for management of ACE inhibitor-associated refractory hypotension.", 
    "17": "Drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), namely angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, are the most commonly prescribed drugs for patients with or at risk for cardiovascular events. However, new treatment strategies aimed at mitigating the rise of the heart failure pandemic are warranted because clinical trials show that RAS blockers have limited benefits in halting disease progression. The main goal of this review is to put forward the concept of an intracrine RAS signaling through the novel angiotensin-(1-12)/chymase axis as the main source of deleterious angiotensin II (Ang II) in cardiac maladaptive remodeling leading to heart failure (HF).", 
    "18": "Expanding traditional knowledge, Ang II can be produced in tissues independently from the circulatory renin-angiotensin system. In the heart, angiotensin-(1-12) [Ang-(1-12)], a recently discovered derivative of angiotensinogen, is a precursor of Ang II, and chymase rather than ACE is the main enzyme contributing to the direct production of Ang II from Ang-(1-12). The Ang-(1-12)/chymase axis is an independent intracrine pathway accounting for the trophic, contractile, and pro-arrhythmic Ang II actions in the human heart. Ang-(1-12) expression and chymase activity have been found elevated in the left atrial appendage of heart disease subjects, suggesting a pivotal role of this axis in the progression of HF. Recent meta-analysis of large clinical trials on the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in cardiovascular disease has demonstrated an imbalance between patients that significantly benefit from these therapeutic agents and those that remain at risk for heart disease progression. Looking to find an explanation, detailed investigation on the RAS has unveiled a previously unrecognized complexity of substrates and enzymes in tissues ultimately associated with the production of Ang II that may explain the shortcomings of ACE inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade. Discovery of the Ang-(1-12)/chymase axis in human hearts, capable of producing Ang II independently from the circulatory RAS, has led to the notion that a tissue-delimited RAS signaling in an intracrine fashion may account for the deleterious effects of Ang II in the heart, contributing to the transition from maladaptive cardiac remodeling to heart failure. Targeting intracellular RAS signaling may improve current therapies aimed at reducing the burden of heart failure.", 
    "19": "Antihypertensive medication use may vary by race and ethnicity. Longitudinal antihypertensive medication use patterns are not well described in women.", 
    "20": "Participants from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a prospective cohort of women (n=3302, aged 42-52), who reported a diagnosis of hypertension or antihypertensive medication use at any annual visit were included. Antihypertensive medications were grouped by class and examined by race/ethnicity adjusting for potential confounders in logistic regression models. A total of 1707 (51.7%) women, mean age 50.6\u00a0years, reported hypertension or used antihypertensive medications at baseline or during follow-up (mean 9.1\u00a0years). Compared with whites, blacks were almost 3 times as likely to receive a calcium channel blocker (odds ratio, 2.92; 95% CI, 2.24-3.82) and twice as likely to receive a thiazide diuretic (odds ratio, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.93-2.94). Blacks also had a higher probability of reporting use of \u22652 antihypertensive medications (odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.55-2.45) compared with whites. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and thiazide diuretics increased over time for all racial/ethnic groups. Contrary to our hypothesis, rates of \u03b2-blocker usage did not decrease over time.", 
    "21": "Among this large cohort of multiethnic midlife women, use of antihypertensive medications increased over time, with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers becoming the most commonly used antihypertensive medication, even for blacks. Thiazide diuretic utilization increased over time for all race/ethnic groups as did use of calcium\u00a0channel blockers among blacks; both patterns are in line with guideline recommendations for the management of hypertension.", 
    "22": "Adherence to medicines is vital in treating diseases. Initial medication non-adherence (IMNA) - defined as not obtaining a medication the first time it is prescribed - has been poorly explored. Previous studies show IMNA rates between 6 and 28% in primary care (PC). The aims of this study were to determine prevalence and predictive factors of IMNA in the most prescribed and expensive pharmacotherapeutic groups in the Catalan health system.", 
    "23": "This is a retrospective, register-based cohort study which linked the Catalan PC System (Spain) prescription and invoicing databases. Medication was considered non-initiated when it was not collected from the pharmacy by the end of the month following the one in which it was prescribed. IMNA prevalence was calculated using July 2013-June 2014 prescription data. Predictive factors related to patients, general practitioners and PC centres were identified through multilevel logistic regression analyses. Missing data were attributed using simple imputation.", 
    "24": "Some 1.6 million patients with 2.9 million prescriptions were included in the study sample. Total IMNA prevalence was 17.6% of prescriptions. The highest IMNA rate was observed in anilides (22.6%) and the lowest in angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (7.4%). Predictors of IMNA are younger age, American nationality, having a pain-related or mental disorder and being treated by a substitute/resident general practitioner in a resident-training centre.",

    "26": "Endothelium has a function to regulate vascular tone by releasing mediators either vasodilating or vasoconstricting blood vessels. Endothelial dysfunction can be measured conveniently by Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI) with a peripheral arterial tonometry. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II (AT II) receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered to have beneficial effects on endothelium through inhibition of AT II. This study was performed to compare the effect of ACEIs or ARBs on endothelial function estimated by RHI in hypertensive patients.", 
    "27": "Twenty consecutive patients with hypertension (57.9\u2009\u00b1\u200911.3\u00a0years, 60% men) were assigned to receive treatment with ramipril or telmisartan for eight weeks (n\u2009=\u200910 per group). Blood pressure (BP) and RHI were measured at baseline and after eight weeks treatment.", 
    "28": "The two groups were similar in terms of demographic and laboratory characteristics. But baseline systolic BP and pulse pressure (PP) were higher in telmisartan group than ramipril group (systolic BP, 159\u2009\u00b1\u20096.83 vs 150\u2009\u00b1\u20097.49, p\u2009=\u20090.028; PP, 75.0\u2009\u00b1\u200914.0 vs 60.3\u2009\u00b1\u200912.4, p\u2009=\u20090.034). In both groups, systolic and diastolic BP decreased significantly after eight weeks treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.05 for each). Although PP reduced in both group (ramipril group, 60.3\u2009\u00b1\u200912.4\u00a0mm Hg to 50.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.60\u00a0mm Hg; telmisartan group, 75.0\u2009\u00b1\u200914.0\u00a0mm Hg to 57.4\u2009\u00b1\u200915.1\u00a0mm Hg), change was statistically remarkable only in telmisartan group. During eight weeks, there was no significant changes of RHI in both groups. There was a positive relationship between decrease of PP after 8\u00a0weeks and the improvement of endothelial function only in ramipril group, but not in telmisartan group (ramipril group, r\u2009=\u20090.671, p\u2009=\u20090.034; telmisartan group, r\u2009=\u2009-0.487, p\u2009=\u20090.153).", 
    "29": "Despite PP reduction effect favoring endothelial function, it's not correlated with RHI improvement with telmisartan. These findings suggest telmisartan itself may negatively influence endothelium dependent vasodilatation different from ramipril."
