They result in increased levels of circulating bradykinins. Rare cases of angioedema following local trauma in patients using ACE inhibitors have been published. We present such a case. A 54-year-old Caucasian female with a history significant for hypertension, controlled with lisinopril, was admitted for routine cervical spine surgery. She has severe degenerative cervical disc disease and was admitted to the hospital for an elective cervical diskectomy. The patient failed weaning off the ventilator on multiple attempts postoperatively. There were no observed symptoms of an allergic reaction. A CT scan of the neck showed extensive soft tissue edema at the level of the arytenoids. Dexamethasone was given to reduce the edema without successful resolution. On review of her medications, it was found that the patient was resumed on lisinopril following the procedure. It was subsequently discontinued. By the following day the patient had a positive leak around the ET tube cuff and patient was successfully extubated.", 
    "1": "Approximately one-fourth of the adult population is diagnosed with hypertension, which has been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke. Early detection and treatment is key and can lead to a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "2": "In this review, we discuss the management and treatment strategies in patients with hypertension in the current era. Blood pressure (BP) targets will be reviewed in accordance with the recent literature and current guidelines. There is a controversy about lower BP target in patients with coronary artery disease with some studies showing a J-curve relationship but a recent randomized trial (SPRINT) showing a benefit, albeit with controversy as to how BP was measured in the trial. Nevertheless, lower BP targets come with a price of needing more medication (thus impacting cost and compliance) and increases in medication-related adverse effects. There is a growing recognition that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium antagonists or thiazide diuretics can be used a first-line therapy for hypertension. Evidence also supports the use of combination drug therapy as opposed to monotherapy for more synergistic effect on lowering of BP, offsetting side effects and for improved adherence to a drug regimen.", 
    "3": "Overall, we aim to review BP targets and medical therapies for hypertension in the current era, recognizing varying clinical characteristics such as comorbidities and patient-risk profile.", 
    "4": "The control of mosquitoes is threatened by the appearance of insecticide resistance and therefore new control chemicals are urgently required. Here we show that inhibitors of mosquito peptidyl dipeptidase, a peptidase related to mammalian angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), are insecticidal to larvae of the mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. ACE inhibitors (captopril, fosinopril and fosinoprilat) and two peptides (trypsin-modulating oostatic factor/TMOF and a bradykinin-potentiating peptide, BPP-12b) were all inhibitors of the larval ACE activity of both mosquitoes. Two inhibitors, captopril and fosinopril (a pro-drug ester of fosinoprilat), were tested for larvicidal activity. Within 24\u2009h captopril had killed >90% of the early instars of both species with 3(rd) instars showing greater resistance. Mortality was also high within 24\u2009h of exposure of 1(st), 2(nd) and 3(rd) instars of An. gambiae to fosinopril. Fosinopril was also toxic to Ae. aegypti larvae, although the 1(st) instars appeared to be less susceptible to this pro-drug even after 72\u2009h exposure. Homology models of the larval An. gambiae ACE proteins (AnoACE2 and AnoACE3) reveal structural differences compared to human ACE, suggesting that structure-based drug design offers a fruitful approach to the development of selective inhibitors of mosquito ACE enzymes as novel larvicides.", 
    "5": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multisystemic, chronic disease accompanied by microvascular complications involving various complicated mechanisms. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and cluster of differentiation-146 (CD146) are mainly expressed by endothelial cells, and facilitate the adhesion and transmigration of immune cells, leading to inflammation. In the present study, we evaluated the levels of soluble adhesion molecules in patients with microvascular complications of T2DM.", 
    "6": "Serum and whole blood samples were collected from 58 T2DM patients with microvascular complications and 20 age-matched healthy subjects. Levels of soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) and soluble VCAM-1 (sVCAM-1) were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while flow cytometry was used to determine CD146 levels.", 
    "7": "Serum sICAM-1 levels were lower in T2DM patients with microvascular complications than in healthy controls (P<0.05). No significant differences were found in sVCAM-1 and CD146 levels between the study and the control group. Although patients were subdivided into groups according to the type of microvascular complications that they experienced, cell adhesion molecule levels were not correlated with the complication type.", 
    "8": "In the study group, most of the patients were on insulin therapy (76%), and 95% of them were receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor agents. Insulin and ACE-inhibitors have been shown to decrease soluble adhesion molecule levels via various mechanisms, so we suggest that the decreased or unchanged levels of soluble forms of cellular adhesion molecules in our study group may have resulted from insulin and ACE-inhibitor therapy, as well as tissue-localized inflammation in patients with T2DM.",

Genotyping of ACE I/D and AGT M235T polymorphisms were performed by using primer specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-RFLP techniques, respectively.", 
    "11": "Forty-eight percent of DN patients (responders) benefited with respect to proteinuria from ACE inhibitor therapy at 6 mo follow-up. A significant reduction in ACR was observed after 6 mo treatment with ACE inhibitor irrespective of whether DN patients were micro-albuminuric (\u2265 30 and < 300 mg/g creatinine) or macro-albuminuric (\u2265 300 mg/g creatinine) at the time of enrollment. However, macro-albuminuric patients (55%) showed better response to therapy. A reduction in urinary ACR was found independent of genotypes of ACE I/D and AGT M235T polymorphisms although macro-albuminuric patients having TT genotype showed statistically insignificant increased response (72%).",

At 6 and 12 months after hospital discharge, all-cause mortality rates were 9.5% and 15.9%, respectively, and cardiovascular mortality rates were 6.8% and 10.5%, respectively. Twenty-three patients (1.5%) underwent heart transplantation. During a follow-up period of 1 year, 46.4% of patients were free from mortality, HF re-hospitalization, left ventricular assist device use and heart transplantation. At the conclusion of follow-up, 57.5% of patients were prescribed either with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers; also, 66.3% were prescribed with beta-blockers and 40.8% were prescribed with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.",

Use of beta-blocker, type and dose was acquired through the Danish Prescription Registry. According to guideline recommendations, we defined target daily doses as\u2009\u226550\u2009mg carvedilol and\u2009\u2265200\u2009mg metoprolol. Prior to implantation 2427 of 2935 (83%) patients received beta-blocker therapy, with 2166 patients (89%) having initiated treatment 3 months or more prior to implantation. The majority of patients was prescribed carvedilol (52%) or metoprolol (41%). Patients on carvedilol reached target dosages more frequently than patients on metoprolol, with 39% of patients on carvedilol and 26% of patients on metoprolol at the time of implantation (P\u2009<\u20090.001 for all time-points). Increase in proportion of patients reaching target daily doses was observed for both carvedilol and metoprolol after ICD implantation. Carvedilol treatment was a strong predictor for being on target dose of BB at time of implant, as was treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or spironolactone, no history of myocardial infarction, younger age and less pronounced heart failure symptoms.",

    "37": "Hypertension is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A major pathophysiological factor contributing to hypertension is reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Strategies to address this pathophysiological mechanism could offer significant advantages. Areas covered: In this review we aimed at examining a variety of drugs (statins, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers) used to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, particularly with respect to their potential of increasing NO bioavailability and activity in the cardiovascular system. There is now evidence supporting the notion that many cardiovascular drugs activate NO signaling or enhance NO bioavailability as a contributing mechanism to their beneficial cardiovascular effects. Moreover, other drugs may attenuate NO inactivation by superoxide and other reactive oxygen species by exerting antioxidant effects. More recently, the NO oxidation products nitrite and nitrate have been acknowledged as sources of NO after recycling back to NO. Activation of the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway is an alternate pathway that may generate NO from both anions and exert antihypertensive effects. Expert opinion: In this review, we provide an overview of the possible mechanisms by which these drugs enhance NO bioavailability and help in the therapy of hypertension."
