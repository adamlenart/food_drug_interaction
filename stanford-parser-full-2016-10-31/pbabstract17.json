    "0": "Cardiopathies and osteoporosis are inter-related due to pathogenetic, hormonal, genetic features as well as an increased risk of fragility. An important feature is attributed to the process of atherosclerosis, which is responsible for an osteopenia effect and degeneration of vascular walls. To date the study populations have been limited. To verify the incidence of cardio-vascular disease in a larger osteoporotic population, we designed a retrospective clinical study analyzing the \u0093Hospital Discharge Data\u0094 (HDD) in Apulia between 2006 and 2010. All patients over 55 years with a hospitalization for a fragility fracture and/or drugs prescription for osteoporosis were crossed with the diagnosis and/or drugs prescription for cardiovascular disease. We observed that between 2006 and 2010, in Apulia, 177,639 patients were hospitalized and diagnosed as having fragility fractures, 66.3% had a diagnosis of cardiopathy, with a higher prevalence in males and in patients over 80 years. The incidence of fractures were as follows: femur (51.9%), spine (20.2%), humerus (10.6%), forearm (9%), tibial pilon (7.2%) and tarsus and metatarsus (1.1%). Cerebrovascular diseases were the most frequent, followed by arrhythmias, heart failure and cardiomyopathies. In these patients, the most prescribed drugs were anti-coagulants, ACE inhibitors and diuretics. In patients affected by cerebral circulation disorder there is a greater propensity to fall and thus have a fragility fracture, particularly of the femur. The vertebral fracture, misdiagnosed in 60-70% of patients, may compromise the cardio-respiratory function of these patients. We verified a higher incidence of fragility fractures in patients who were prescribed certain categories of drugs for the treatment of cardio-vascular disease. This hypothesis is not supported by the literature, where contradictory results on the potential effects of these drugs on bone have been published. The high incidence of heart disease found in patients with fragility fractures supports the need for specific screening for osteoporosis in the population with cardio-circulatory pathology.", 
    "1": "Hypertension is an important factor in cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors like synthetic drugs are widely used to control hypertension. ACE-inhibitory peptides from food origins could be a good alternative to synthetic drugs. A number of plant-based peptides have been investigated for their potential ACE inhibitor activities by using in vitro and in vivo assays. These plant-based peptides can be obtained by solvent extraction, enzymatic hydrolysis with or without novel food processing methods, and fermentation. ACE-inhibitory activities of peptides can be affected by their structural characteristics such as chain length, composition and sequence. ACE-inhibitory peptides should have gastrointestinal stability and reach the cardiovascular system to show their bioactivity. This paper reviews the current literature on plant-derived ACE-inhibitory peptides including their sources, production and structure, as well as their activity by in vitro and in vivo studies and their bioavailability.", 
    "2": "We performed a nested case-control study in a cohort of antihypertensive drug users to assess the association between discontinuation of different antihypertensive agents and the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Cases and controls were drawn from the Utrecht Cardiovascular Pharmacogenetics database. Patients who were hospitalised for their first AMI were considered cases and controls were not hospitalised for AMI. Antihypertensive users were defined as current users if the index date (date of AMI) fell within the prescribed duration or as discontinuers if this date fell outside the prescribed duration. According to the recency of discontinuation, discontinuers were divided into the following: recent discontinuers (\u2a7d90 days), intermediate-term discontinuers (91-180 days) and long-term discontinuers (>180 days). We found that the risk of AMI was significantly increased in discontinuers, regardless of time since discontinuation, of beta-blockers (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.54; 95% confidence interval (CI; 1.25-1.91), P-value<0.0005), calcium channel blockers (CCBs; adjusted OR 2.25; 95% CI (1.53-3.30), P-value<0.0005) and diuretics (adjusted OR 1.76; 95% CI (1.24-2.48), P-value=0.002) compared to current users of these drugs. Moreover, the risk of AMI was significantly increased in long-term discontinuers (beta-blockers, CCBs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics) and intermediate-term discontinuers (beta-blockers and CCBs) versus current users of these drugs. There was no difference in AMI risk between recent discontinuers of antihypertensive drugs versus current users of these drugs. In conclusion, discontinuation of antihypertensive drugs increases the risk of AMI after >90 days of discontinuation. This further underlines the importance of persistence to antihypertensive drug therapy to reduce the risk of AMI in patients with hypertension.Journal of Human Hypertension advance online publication, 23 March 2017; doi:10.1038/jhh.2017.1.", 
    "3": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a rare kidney disorder impacting \u223c1:2,500 individuals among the general US population. Hypertension is a significant predictor of ADPKD progression, and a risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the most common cause for mortality among ADPKD patients. Angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors (ACE-I) are widely used as first-line treatment in ADPKD for the management of hypertension. However, their cost-effectiveness relative to other hypertensive medications, such as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), has never been assessed.",

    "5": "A Markov-state decision model was constructed for estimation of cost and outcome benefits in hypertensive ADPKD patients. Transition probabilities were extrapolated from a retrospective cohort study comparing chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage transitions in ADPKD patients. Annual pharmaceutical costs per average daily dose per CKD stage were extracted from a US healthcare claims database. Median total healthcare costs per CKD stage or transplant were extracted from the published literature. The time horizon was set to 30 years, with 1-year duration to cycle shift. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ACE-I vs ARB per additional year of prevented transplant and/or death. A one-way probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted, with 10% variation in probabilities and cost.", 
    "6": "Total annual healthcare costs accrued after 30 years among ADPKD patients taking ACE-Is was estimated to be $3,505,028.41, compared to ARB at $3,644,327.65. Life expectancy was increased by 1.39 years among patients taking ACE-I. Approximate 10-year survival in patients taking ACE-Is was 47% compared to ARB at 34%.", 
    "7": "ACE-I dominated ARB and displayed greater cost-effectiveness due to lower cost and increased capacity to prolong years of life without transplant or death among hypertensive ADPKD patients. This model strengthens the value of ACE-I over ARB as first-line treatment for hypertension management in ADPKD patients.", 
    "8": "Antihypertensives are widely prescribed and could influence kidney stone risk by altering urinary calcium excretion. However, the impact of different classes of antihypertensives on kidney stone risk is unknown. To assess this impact, we conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study using linked health administrative databases. Individuals aged >65 years who initiated one of the four antihypertensive classes (that is, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics) were included. The participants were followed for the occurrence of a kidney stone event while maintaining continuous usage on their drug class. The association between antihypertensive class and outcome was estimated by Cox regression. Of the 542\u2009581 people included, we observed 4533 kidney stone events (0.83%) over a median follow-up of 368 days (365-729). Compared with beta-blockers, thiazides were associated with a lower risk of kidney stones (hazard ratio (HR) 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68-0.84), ACEis/ARBs with a borderline decreased risk (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.83-0.98) and calcium channel blockers with a comparable risk (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.92-1.13). When the risk of requiring an intervention for a kidney stone was examined, the results were consistent with the primary analysis; however, the protective effect of ACEis/ARBs was eliminated (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.87-1.06). In conclusion, relative to beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics were associated with a decreased risk of kidney stone formation in adults aged >65 years, whereas ACEis/ARBs and calcium channel blockers had a comparable risk of presenting with a kidney stone.Hypertension Research advance online publication, 23 March 2017; doi:10.1038/hr.2017.42.",

There were marked differences between European countries. Reaching\u2009<50% of the recommended ACE-inhibitor/ARB and beta-blocker dose was associated with an increased risk of death and/or heart failure hospitalization. Patients reaching 50-99% of the recommended ACE-inhibitor/ARB and/or beta-blocker dose had comparable risk of death and/or heart failure hospitalization to those reaching\u2009\u2265100%. Patients not reaching recommended dose because of symptoms, side effects and non-cardiac organ dysfunction had the highest mortality rate (for ACE-inhibitor/ARB: HR 1.72; 95% CI 1.43-2.01; for beta-blocker: HR 1.70; 95% CI 1.36-2.05).",

    "12": "Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) often have multiple comorbid conditions that may interact with each other, confound the choice of treatments, and reduce mortality. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most important comorbidities of CVD, which causes serious consequences in patients with ischemic heart disease, stroke, arrhythmia, and heart failure. COPD shares common risk factors such as tobacco smoking and aging with CVD, is associated with less physical activity, and produces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Overall, patients with COPD have a 2-3-fold increased risk of CVD as compared to age-matched controls when adjusted for tobacco smoking. Chronic heart failure (HF) is a frequent and important comorbidity which has a significant impact on prognosis in COPD, and vice versa. HF overlaps in symptoms and signs and has a common comorbidity with COPD, so that diagnosis of COPD is difficult in patients with HF. The combination of HF and COPD presents many therapeutic challenges including beta-blockers (BBs) and beta-agonists. Inhaled long-acting bronchodilators including beta2-agonists and anticholinergics for COPD would not worsen HF. Diuretics are relatively safe, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are preferred to treat HF accompanied with COPD. BBs are only relatively contraindicated in asthma, but not in COPD. Low doses of cardioselective BBs should be aggressively initiated in clinically stable patients with HF accompanied with COPD combined with close monitoring for signs of airway obstruction and gradually up-titrated to the maximum tolerated dose. Encouraging appropriate and aggressive treatment for both HF and COPD should be recommended to improve quality of life and mortality in HF patients with COPD.",
