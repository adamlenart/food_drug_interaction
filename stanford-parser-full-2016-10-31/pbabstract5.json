    "1": "A cohort study of 142,990 women (66 y and above) newly diagnosed with breast cancer from 2001 to 2009 was conducted using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare-linked database. The ACEI/BB exposure was defined as filled prescription(s) before or after the initiation of trastuzumab/anthracyclines. The nonexposed group was defined as those who had never been prescribed ACEIs/BBs. Cumulative rates of cardiotoxicity and all-cause mortality were estimated and marginal structural Cox models were used to determine factors associated with cardiotoxicity and all-cause mortality adjusting for baseline covariates and use of chemotherapy. All statistical tests were 2 sided.",

Adjusted hazard ratio for cardiotoxicity and all-cause mortality for the ACEI/BB exposed group were 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.95) and 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.90) compared with the nonexposed group, respectively. Starting ACEIs/BBs\u22646 months after the initiation of trastuzumab/anthracyclines and having exposed duration\u22656 months were also associated with decreased risk of cardiotoxicity and all-cause mortality. Baseline characteristics, including age, non-Hispanic black, advanced cancer, region, comorbidity, preexisting cardiovascular conditions, lower socioeconomic status, and concomitant treatment were significantly associated with an elevated risk of all-cause mortality and/or cardiotoxicity (all P<0.05).",

Relative to ACEIs, atenolol had a more favorable impact on peripheral diastolic blood pressure (PDBP) (WMD = -1.912 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.732 to -0.091, P = 0.040) and HR (WMD = -9.23 bpm, 95% CI: -12.53 to -5.93, P < 0.001). In stratified analyses, particularly by follow-up period, atenolol was observed to be superior over ACEIs within early 3-month treatment in PSBP (WMD = -4.097 mmHg, 95% CI: -6.589 to -1.605, P = 0.001), PDBP (WMD = -6.802 mmHg, 95% CI: -8.517 to -5.087, P < 0.001) and HR (WMD = -14.242 bpm, 95% CI: -16.427 to -12.058, P = 0.028), without heterogeneity (I(2) = 0.0%).

They usually have many co-morbidities requiring multiple drug regimens, and memory or cognitive problems that can interfere with management. Also, they sometimes have a degree of social problems as they might often live alone, and thereby cater for their daily activities with minimal assistance. Multiple drug use combined with their fragile health predispose them to adverse drug reactions, drug-drug interactions, and direct drug toxicity from overdosing. We report and discuss the lessons learnt from the case of an elderly woman in an urban setting in sub-Saharan Africa who presented with problems of drug dosing, adverse drug effect, and drug-drug interaction that might prove useful in the future management of hypertension with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.",

With ever-widening indications for ACEI in diseases including hypertension, congestive heart failure and diabetic nephropathy, a concomitant increase in ACEI-Angioedema (ACEI-A) has been reported. At present there is no validated severity scoring or discharge criteria for ACEI-A. We sought to develop and validate an investigator rating scale with corresponding discharge criteria using clinicians experienced in treating ACEI-A.", 
    "18": "In-depth, 60-min qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with 12 US-based emergency physicians. Beforehand, clinicians were sent four case studies describing patients experiencing different severities of angioedema attacks. Clinicians were initially asked open-ended questions about their experience of patients' symptoms, treatment and discharge decisions. Clinicians then rated each patient case study and discussed patient diagnoses, ratings of symptom severity and discharge evaluation. The ratings were used to assess inter-rater reliability of the scale using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) using IBM SPSS analysis Version 19 software.", 
    "19": "The findings provide support focusing on four key symptoms of airway compromise scored on a 0-4 scale: 1) Difficulty Breathing, 2) Difficulty Swallowing, 3) Voice Changes and 4) Tongue Swelling and the corresponding discharge criteria of a score of 0 or 'No symptoms' for Difficulty Breathing and Difficulty Swallowing and a score of 0 or 1 indicating mild or absence of symptoms for Voice Change and Tongue Swelling. Eleven clinicians agreed the absence of standardized discharge criteria supported the use of this scale. All physicians concurred with the recommended discharge criteria. The clinician ratings provided evidence of strong inter-rater reliability for the rating scale (ICC\u2009>\u20090.80).",

    "21": "The local role of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) was documented recently beside its conventional systemic functions. Studies showed that the effector angiotensin II (AngII) alters bone health, while inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-1) preserved these effects. The newly identified Ang1-7 exerts numerous beneficial effects opposing the AngII. Thus, the current study examines the role of Ang1-7 in mediating the osteo-preservative effects of ACEI (captopril) through the G-protein coupled Mas receptor using an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model of osteoporosis. 8 weeks after the surgical procedures, captopril was administered orally (40mgkg(-1) d(-1)), while the specific Mas receptor blocker (A-779) was delivered at infusion rate of 400ngkg(-1)min(-1) for 6 weeks. Bone metabolic markers were measured in serum and urine. Minerals concentrations were quantified in serum, urine and femoral bones by inductive coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Trabecular and cortical morphometry was analyzed in the right distal femurs using micro-CT. Finally, the expressions of RAS peptides, enzymes and receptors along with the receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) were determined femurs heads. OVX animals markedly showed altered bone metabolism and mineralization along with disturbed bone micro-structure. Captopril significantly restored the metabolic bone bio-markers and corrected Ca(2+) and P values in urine and bones of estrogen deficient rats. Moreover, the trabecular and cortical morphometric features were repaired by captopril in OVX groups. Captopril also improved the expressions of ACE-2, Ang1-7, Mas and OPG, while abolished OVX-induced up-regulation of ACE-1, AngII, Ang type 1 receptor (AT1R) and RANKL. Inhibition of Ang1-7 cascade by A-779 significantly eradicated captopril protective effects on bone metabolism, mineralization and micro-structure. A-779 also restored OVX effects on RANKL expression and ACE-1/AngII/AT1R cascade and down-regulated OPG expression and ACE-2/Ang1-7/Mas pathway. In line with the clinical observations of the bone-preservative properties following ACE-1 inhibition, local activation of ACE-2/Ang1-7/Mas signaling and suppressed osteoclastogenesis seem responsible for the osteo-preservative effect of captopril, which could offers a potential therapeutic value in treatment of disabling bone and skeletal muscular diseases.",

    "23": "We used data from the National Disease and Therapeutic Index (NDTI), a nationally representative physician survey produced by QuintilesIMS. We selected patients with a diagnosis of HTN and identified those prescribed antihypertensive therapies. We analyzed the type of antihypertensive agents prescribed. Extent of BP control, and associated patient and physician characteristics. We calculated 95% confidence intervals that accounted for the multistage NDTI sampling design.", 
    "24": "Among those treated for HTN in 2014, BP control varied: systolic BP (SBP) \u2265160 (15%) vs. SBP 150-159 (9%) vs. SBP 140-149 (19%) vs. SBP 130-139 (26%) vs. SBP <130 (32%). Of those treated for HTN, 29% used of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs); 24%, thiazide-like diuretics; 22%, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), 21%, calcium-channel blockers (CCBs); and 19% beta-blockers. Newer drugs had very limited uptake; no drugs approved after 2002 were used in more than 5% of patients. Selection of agents varied only modestly by patient and physician characteristics.", 
    "25": "The treatment of HTN in 2014 predominantly involved older medications in 5 major classes of drugs: ACEIs, thiazide diuretics, ARBs, CCBs, and beta-blockers. Selection of antihypertensive agents showed limited variation by age, gender, race, and insurance type. Although 58% of treated patients had SBP <140, 24% had poorly controlled HTN with SBP \u2265150, indicating the need for improved treatment.", 
    "26": "Elevated blood pressure (BP) and headache have long been linked in the medical literature. Headache associated with arterial hypertension is a main concern in emergency department. It is believed that headache may be a symptom attributed to arterial hypertension only if the BP values are very high or rise quickly. Many studies support the hypothesis that migraine patients have an increased risk of developing hypertension, while hypertensive subjects do not seem to have an increased risk of migraine or other types of headache. Conversely many studies found an inverse association. Hypertension has been identified as one of the most important factors of chronic transformation of episodic migraine and increases the cerebrovascular and cardiovascular risk of migraine patients. Migraine and arterial hypertension may share common mechanisms like endothelial dysfunction, deficiency of autonomic cardiovascular regulation and renin angiotensin system involvement. Preventive effects of migraine were described by several antihypertensive agents traditionally beta-blockers, and more recently angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.",

The pathogenesis involves the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (first phase) and renin-angiotensin system (second phase). Only a limited number of different treatment strategies have been published in the literature, without any comparative studies.", 
    "28": "Our aim was to describe the current international practice variation surrounding pharmacological treatment currently being employed to treat paradoxical hypertension following the repair of coarctation of the aorta in children. We performed an online survey among 197 members of the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society. We also conducted a systematic review of the literature regarding the treatment of paradoxical hypertension.", 
    "29": "Eighty-eight people (45%), from 62 different centers, responded and answered the questions regarding blood pressure control. Nitroprusside is the first drug of choice for initial blood pressure control in 66% of respondents, esmolol in 11%, labetalol in 11%, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are used by 3% of respondents. For oral blood pressure control after discharge from the pediatric intensive care unit, 75% of respondents use ACEIs, 18% use labetalol, and 12% use other beta-blockers (propranolol, carvedilol, atenolol, metoprolol). The systematic review identified 14 articles reporting pharmacological treatment of direct postoperative hypertension following coarctation repair.", 
    "30": "There is wide practice variability, due to the lack of sufficient compelling evidence. The majority (66%) of caregivers use nitroprusside to control blood pressure in the acute postoperative phase. The ACEIs are the drug of choice for chronic blood pressure control.", 
    "31": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used to reduce blood pressure. Here, we examined if ACE is important for the antibacterial effectiveness of neutrophils. ACE knockout mice or mice treated with an ACE inhibitor were more susceptible to bacterial infection by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In contrast, mice over expressing ACE in neutrophils (Neu(ACE) mice) have increased resistance to MRSA, and better in vitro killing of MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae ACE overexpression increased neutrophil production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following MRSA challenge, an effect independent of the angiotensin II AT1 receptor. Specifically, as compared to wild type mice (WT), there was a marked increase of superoxide generation (greater than 2-fold, p<0.0005) in Neu(ACE) neutrophils following infection while ACE knockout neutrophils decreased superoxide production. Analysis of membrane p47-phox and p67-phox indicates that ACE increases NADPH oxidase activity but does not increase expression of these subunits. Increased ROS generation mediates the enhanced bacterial resistance of Neu(ACE) mice as the enhanced resistance is lost with DPI inhibition. Neu(ACE) granulocytes also have increased neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NET) and IL-1\u03b2 release in response to MRSA. In a mouse model of chemotherapy-induced neutrophil depletion, transfusion of ACE overexpressing neutrophils was superior to WT neutrophils in treating MRSA infection. These data indicate a previously unknown function of ACE in neutrophil anti-bacterial defenses, and suggest caution in the treatment of certain individuals with ACE inhibitors. ACE overexpression in neutrophils may be useful in boosting the immune response to antibiotic resistance bacterial infection.",

We defined persistence as the duration of treatment from the first to the last fill date before a 90-day permissible gap, and used Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models to assess crude and adjusted non-persistence. The secular trends of ART persistence in 43 598 HIV patients were compared with the secular trends of persistence with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), statins, and metformin in (1) non-HIV-infected patients and (2) subgroups of HIV patients who started these control medications while using ART.",
