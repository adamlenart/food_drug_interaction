This study reports the creation and validation of sex-specific inpatient (i) heart failure (HF) risk scores using electronic data from the beginning of inpatient care for effective and efficient prediction of 30-day readmission risk.", 
    "1": "HF patients hospitalized at Intermountain Healthcare from 2005 to 2012 (derivation: n=6079; validation: n=2663) and Baylor Scott & White Health (North Region) from 2005 to 2013 (validation: n=5162) were studied. Sex-specific iHF scores were derived to predict post-hospitalization 30-day readmission using common HF laboratory measures and age. Risk scores adding social, morbidity, and treatment factors were also evaluated.", 
    "2": "The iHF model for females utilized potassium, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration; for males, components were B-type natriuretic peptide, sodium, creatinine, hematocrit, red cell distribution width, and mean platelet volume. Among females, odds ratios (OR) were OR=1.99 for iHF tertile 3 vs. 1 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.28, 3.08) for Intermountain validation (P-trend across tertiles=0.002) and OR=1.29 (CI=1.01, 1.66) for Baylor patients (P-trend=0.049). Among males, iHF had OR=1.95 (CI=1.33, 2.85) for tertile 3 vs. 1 in Intermountain (P-trend <0.001) and OR=2.03 (CI=1.52, 2.71) in Baylor (P-trend < 0.001). Expanded models using 182-183 variables had predictive abilities similar to iHF.", 
    "3": "Sex-specific laboratory-based electronic health record-delivered iHF risk scores effectively predicted 30-day readmission among HF patients. Efficient to calculate and deliver to clinicians, recent clinical implementation of iHF scores suggest they are useful and useable for more precise clinical HF treatment.", 
    "4": "CD8(+) T-cell response is critical in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria during blood-stage. Our group and other have been shown that angiotensin II (Ang II) and its receptor AT1 (AT1R), a key effector axis of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), have immune regulatory effects on T cells. Previously, we showed that inhibition of AT1R signaling protects mice against the lethal disease induced by Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection However, most of the Ang II/AT1R actions were characterized by using only pharmacological approaches, the effects of which may not always be due to a specific receptor blockade. In addition, the mechanisms of action of the AT1R in inducing the pathogenic activity of Plasmodium-specific CD8(+) T cells during blood-stage were not determined. Here, we examined how angiotensin II/AT1R axis promotes the harmful response of Plasmodium-specific CD8(+) T-cell during blood-stage by using genetic and pharmacological approaches. We evaluated the response of wild-type (WT) and AT1R(-/-)Plasmodium-specific CD8(+) T cells in mice infected with a transgenic PbA lineage expressing ovalbumin; and in parallel infected mice receiving WT Plasmodium-specific CD8(+) T cells were treated with losartan (AT1R antagonist) or captopril (ACE inhibitor). Both, AT1R(-/-) OT-I cells and WT OT-I cells from losartan- or captopril-treated mice showed lower expansion, reduced IL-2 production and IL-2R\u03b1 expression, lower activation (lower expression of CD69, CD44 and CD160) and lower exhaustion profiles. AT1R(-/-) OT-I cells also exhibit lower expression of the integrin LFA-1 and the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3, known to play a key role in the development of cerebral malaria. Moreover, AT1R(-/-) OT-I cells produce lower amounts of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 and show lower degranulation upon restimulation. In conclusion, our results show the pivotal mechanisms of AT1R-induced harmful phenotype of Plasmodium-specific CD8(+) T cells during blood-stage malaria.", 
    "5": "Chronic allograft dysfunction is a complex and multifactorial process characterized by progressive interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. The finding of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy is prevalent among kidney transplant patients receiving a calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppressive regimen and may be considered as a surrogate of allograft survival. Both immune (acute rejection episodes, sensitization, and HLA incompatibility) and nonimmune (donor age, delayed graft function, calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, infections, and hypertension) mechanisms play a role in chronic allograft dysfunction, and different causes all lead to similar histologic and clinical final pathways, with the end result of graft loss. In our study, we aimed to compare the outcomes of kidney transplant recipients with or without interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy in protocol biopsies to determine the conditions that may affect allograft survival.", 
    "6": "We divided 192 kidney transplant recipients into 2 groups (96 patients with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy; 96 patients without interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy) according to protocol biopsy at 6 months. Patient groups were compared according to their risk factors for chronic allograft dysfunction (cold ischemia time, delayed graft function, donor age, infections, mean blood calcineurin levels, and hypertension).", 
    "7": "Cold ischemia time, delayed graft function, high 24-hour proteinuria levels, and higher mean blood calcineurin levels were found to be major risk factors for poor graft function in kidney transplant recipients with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Renin-angiotensin system blockage with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers was found to be preventive for interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy after kidney transplant.", 
    "8": "Preventing prolongation of cold ischemia time, lowering blood cholesterol levels, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker treatment even without existing proteinuria and avoiding higher doses of calcineurin inhibitors should be major approaches in kidney transplant recipients.", 
    "9": "Angioedema of the small bowel (ASB) is an extremely rare side effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). We present a case of ACEI-induced ASB mimicking postoperative complication. The diagnosis of ACEI-induced ASB should be considered in patients using these drugs and presenting sudden gastrointestinal symptoms and thickening of small bowel not attributable to other diseases.", 
    "10": "Combinations between an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) are among the recommended treatments for hypertensive patients uncontrolled by monotherapy. Four randomized, double-blind, parallel group studies with a similar design, including 1469 hypertensive patients uncontrolled by a previous monotherapy and with \u22651 cardiovascular risk factor, compared the efficacy of a combination of a sulfhydryl ACE inhibitor (zofenopril at 30 or 60\u00a0mg) or an ARB (irbesartan at 150 or 300\u00a0mg) plus HCTZ 12.5\u00a0mg. The extent of blood pressure (BP)-lowering was assessed in the office and over 24\u00a0h. Pleiotropic features of the treatments were evaluated by studying their effect on systemic inflammation, organ damage, arterial stiffness, and metabolic biochemical parameters. Both treatments similarly reduced office and ambulatory BPs after 18-24\u00a0weeks. In the ZODIAC study a larger reduction in high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) was observed under zofenopril (-0.52 vs. +0.97\u00a0mg/dL under irbesartan, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), suggesting a potential protective effect against the development of atherosclerosis. In the ZENITH study the rate of carotid plaque regression was significantly larger under zofenopril (32% vs. 16%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.047). In the diabetic patients of the ZAMES study, no adverse effects of treatments on blood glucose and lipids as well as an improvement of renal function were observed. In patients with isolated systolic hypertension of the ZEUS study, a slight and similar improvement in renal function and small reductions in pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AI), and central systolic BP were documented with both treatments. Thus, the fixed combination of zofenopril and HCTZ may have a relevant place in the treatment of high-risk or monotherapy-treated uncontrolled hypertensive patients requiring a more prompt, intensive, and sustained BP reduction, in line with the recommendations of current guidelines.", 
    "11": "Chronic restraint stress (CRS) is known to cause various behavioural and biochemical alterations, leading to several negative health outcomes. The present study was designed to explore the impact of inhibiting Renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) and inflammatory pathways in stress pathophysiology. In the present study, male LACA mice were subjected to restraint stress daily for 30 days. Losartan, nimesulide, ramipril, minocycline and their combinations were administered 45min prior to restraint stress daily and their effects were observed. Restraint stressed mice depicted depression like behavior along with increased oxidative stress markers in their brains. CRS induced insulin resistance depicted by hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypercholesteremia, increased glycosylated hemoglobin and HOMA-IR. Besides, treatment with losartan, nimesulide, ramipril and minocycline significantly restored the behavioural and biochemical alterations and improved insulin sensitivity in stressed mice. Combination treatments synergistically reversed depression like behavior and decreased plasma glucose levels. Moreover they restored insulin levels, glycosylated hemoglobin levels and HOMA-IR values to the normal. This study signifies the synergistic effect of simultaneously blocking RAS and inflammatory pathways in stress pathophysiology.", 
    "12": "There are limited contemporary data on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) utilization and long-term clinical outcomes in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) with and without concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD). From 2006 to 2013, 879 patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia (CLI) underwent diagnostic angiography or therapeutic endovascular intervention at our multidisciplinary vascular center. GDMT use was assessed at the time of angiography, and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and all-cause mortality were determined during 5\u00a0years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to adjust for baseline differences between patients with and without concomitant CAD. Despite a higher adherence to GDMT (all p \u22640.002) for the use of aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, and statins, patients with PAD and concomitant CAD had higher unadjusted 5-year rates of MACCE (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.4, p\u00a0= 0.0001). After adjustment for baseline co-morbidities, the presence of CAD remained an independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.80, p\u00a0= 0.04) but not for MACCE (adjusted HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.60, p\u00a0= 0.10) in patients with PAD. A sensitivity analysis limited to patients with CLI demonstrated that concomitant CAD was associated with significantly higher adjusted rates of both MACCE (adjusted HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.03, p\u00a0= 0.01) and mortality (adjusted HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.20, p\u00a0= 0.006). In conclusion, despite higher rates of GDMT use, PAD patients with concomitant CAD had significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality during a 5-year postprocedural follow-up. The subgroup of CLI patients with concomitant CAD was at particularly high risk for both MACCE and all-cause mortality.", 
    "13": "There is a close relationship between arterial stiffness and blood pressure. The studies suggest that the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and its cell receptor (RAGE) are involved in the arterial stiffness in two ways: changes in arterial structure and vascular function. Plasma levels of AGEs and expression of RAGE are elevated, while the levels of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) and endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE) are lowered in patients with hypertension (HTN). There is a positive correlation between plasma levels of AGEs and arterial stiffness, and an inverse association between arterial stiffness/HTN, and serum levels of sRAGE and esRAGE. Various measures can reduce the levels of AGEs and expression of RAGE, and elevate sRAGE. Arterial stiffness and blood pressure could be reduced by lowering the serum levels of AGEs, and increasing the levels of sRAGE. Levels of AGEs can be lowered by reducing the consumption of AGE-rich diet, short duration of cooking in moist heat at low temperature, and cessation of cigarette smoking. Drugs such as aminoguanidine, vitamins, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, statins, and metformin inhibit AGE formation. Alagebrium, an AGE breakers reduces levels of AGEs. Clinical trials with some drugs tend to reduce stiffness. Systemic administration of sRAGE has beneficial effect in animal studies. In conclusion, AGE-RAGE axis is involved in arterial stiffness and HTN. The studies suggest that inhibition of AGEs formation, reduction of AGE consumption, blockade of AGE-RAGE interaction, suppression of RAGE expression, and exogenous administration of sRAGE may be novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of arterial stiffness and HTN.", 
    "14": "Cost-sharing scheme for pharmaceuticals in Spain changed in July 2012. Our aim was to assess the impact of this change on adherence to essential medication in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the region of Valencia.", 
    "15": "Population-based retrospective cohort of 10\u2009563 patients discharged alive after an ACS in 2009-2011. We examined a control group (low-income working population) that did not change their coinsurance status, and two intervention groups: pensioners who moved from full coverage to 10% coinsurance and middle-income to high-income working population, for whom coinsurance rose from 40% to 50% or 60%. Weekly adherence rates measured from the date of the first prescription. Days with available medication were estimated by linking prescribed and filled medications during the follow-up period.", 
    "16": "Cost-sharing change made no significant differences in adherence between intervention and control groups for essential medications with low price and low patient maximum coinsurance, such as antiplatelet and beta-blockers. For costlier ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) and statins, it had an immediate effect in the proportion of adherence in the pensioner group as compared with the control group (6.8% and 8.3%\u2009decrease of adherence, respectively, p<0.01 for both). Adherence to statins decreased for the middle-income to high-income group as compared with the control group (7.8% increase of non-adherence, p<0.01). These effects seemed temporary.", 
    "17": "Coinsurance changes may lead to decreased adherence to proven, effective therapies, especially for higher priced agents with higher patient cost share. Consideration should be given to fully exempt high-risk patients from drug cost sharing.",

    "19": "Information on all 4966 cases hospitalized in 2008-2010 for acute pancreatitis was retrieved from the Finnish national registers on hospital discharges and prescriptions. A total of 24\u00a0788 age and sex-matched population-based controls were randomly selected using density sampling. ACE inhibitor use between 1 January 2003 and the index date were determined by the date of hospitalization for acute pancreatitis among the cases. The incidence rate ratios of acute pancreatitis not diagnosed as biliary or alcohol-induced were modeled by conditional logistic regression and adjusted for comorbidities.", 
    "20": "A total of 1276 (26%) cases and 3946 (16%) controls had been exposed to ACE inhibitors. The use of ACE inhibitors was associated with an increased incidence rate of acute pancreatitis (odds ratio [OR] 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-1.95). The increase was slightly higher among current new users (OR 1.86, 95%CI 1.65-2.09) and somewhat lower among current prevalent (OR 1.54, 95%CI 1.35-1.75) and former users (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.31-1.74).",

    "22": "Sarcopenia of age is prevalent and costly and proven pharmacological interventions are currently lacking. The pathophysiology of sarcopenia is incompletely understood but appears to involve multiple pathways, including inflammation, hormonal dysregulation, impaired regeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction and denervation. There are several ways in which we might select potential pharmacological interventions for testing in clinical trials. These include a 'bottom-up' approach using basic science to elucidate the molecular processes involved and identify potential targets from this knowledge-a strategy that has led to the development of myostatin inhibitors. A 'top-down' approach might use observational data to examine the association between physical function and use of certain medications, such as the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with slower decline in physical function. Once a pharmacological intervention has been proposed, efficacy must be demonstrated in this complex multi-morbid population. Both muscle mass and muscle function need to be measured as outcomes, but these outcomes require large sample sizes and sufficient follow-up to detect change. Biomarkers that can predict the response of sarcopenia to intervention after a short time would greatly assist our ability to select candidate interventions in short proof-of-concept trials. Further development of trial methods is required to accelerate progress in this important area of medicine for older people."
