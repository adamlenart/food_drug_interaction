    "0": "The biological activities of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) might be mediated through a classical receptormediated or non-classical endocytic pathway. JAB1 (C-Jun activation domain-binding protein-1) promotes the degradation of the tumor suppressor, p53, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27. When MIF and JAB1 are bound to each other in various intracellular sites, MIF inhibits the positive regulatory effects of JAB1 on the activity of AP-1. The intestinal parasite, Anisakis simplex, has an immunomodulatory effect. The molecular mechanism of action of As-MIF and human JAB1 are poorly understood. In this study, As-MIF and hJAB1 were expressed and purified with high solubility. The structure of As-MIF and hJAB1 interaction was modeled by homology modeling based on the structure of Ace-MIF. This study provides evidence indicating that the MIF domain of As-MIF interacts directly with the MPN domain of hJAB1, and four structure-based mutants of As-MIF and hJAB1 disrupt the As-MIF-hJAB1 interaction.

    "1": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is commonly known to regulate blood pressure, water and electrolyte homeostasis, however it also exerts paracrine and autocrine actions on the kidney. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), alongside their hypotensive properties, have been shown to decrease kidney function decline in animal models of nephropathy. Glutamate (GLU) is the main stimulatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, however its importance in the periphery should also be considered. Activation of renal GLU receptors has been linked to normal kidney function and also renal injury. The wide spectrum GLU receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (KYNA) possesses neuroprotective and central hypotensive effects, however its actions outside the brain are less well recognized. KYNA is a tryptophan metabolite synthesized from kynurenine by kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs). The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of three ACE-Is: lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril on KYNA production and KATs activity in rat kidney in vitro.", 
    "2": "The effect of ACE-Is on KYNA production and KATs activity was examined in rat kidney homogenates. KYNA was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and quantified fluorometrically.", 
    "3": "All examined ACE-Is: lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril decreased KYNA production in rat kidney in vitro. KAT I activity was decreased by lisinopril and ramipril whereas the activity of KAT II was lowered by ramipril.", 
    "4": "Our study shows that ACE-Is can decrease KYNA production in rat kidney in vitro. Further studies are required to determine the clinical importance of the inhibitory action of ACE-Is on KYNA synthesis in the kidney.", 
    "5": "Over the years, thanks to the addition of new generation systemic agents, as well as the use of more advanced and precise radiotherapy techniques, it was able to obtain a high curability rate for breast cancer. Anthracyclines play a key role in the treatment of breast disease, with a well-known benefit on disease-free survival of patients with positive nodal status. Trastuzumab have shown a significant outcome advantage after 1-year administration in case of HER2-positive disease. Unfortunately, significant increase in cardiotoxicity has been observed after anthracyclines and trastuzumab therapies. Even though the cardiology and oncology community strongly recommend a cardiotoxicity prevention strategy for this subset of patients, there is still no consensus on the optimal patient's approach. We aimed to review the published and ongoing researches on cardioprevention strategies and to present the SAFE trial (CT registry ID: NCT2236806; EudraCT number: 2015-000914-23). It is a randomized phase 3, four-arm, single-blind, placebo-controlled study that aims to evaluate the effect of bisoprolol, ramipril or both drugs, compared to placebo, on subclinical heart damage evaluated by speckle tracking cardiac ultrasound in non-metastatic breast cancer patients.", 
    "6": "Renal fibrosis is a common complication of diabetic nephropathy and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease. Despite the suggested link between renal fibrosis and microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation in diabetic nephropathy, the identification of the specific miRNAs involved is still incomplete. The aim of this study was to investigate miRNA profiles in the diabetic kidney and to identify potential downstream targets implicated in renal fibrosis.", 
    "7": "miRNA expression profiling was investigated in the kidneys of 8-month-old Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats during overt nephropathy. Localisation of the most upregulated miRNA was established by in situ hybridisation. The candidate miRNA target was identified by in silico analysis and its expression documented in the diabetic kidney associated with fibrotic markers. Cultured tubule cells served to assess which of the profibrogenic stimuli acted as a trigger for the overexpressed miRNA, and to investigate underlying epigenetic mechanisms.", 
    "8": "In ZDF rats, miR-184 showed the strongest differential upregulation compared with lean rats (18-fold). Tubular localisation of miR-184 was associated with reduced expression of lipid phosphate phosphatase 3 (LPP3) and collagen accumulation. Transfection of NRK-52E cells with miR-184 mimic reduced LPP3, promoting a profibrotic phenotype. Albumin was a major trigger of miR-184 expression. Anti-miR-184 counteracted albumin-induced LPP3 downregulation and overexpression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. In ZDF rats, ACE-inhibitor treatment limited albuminuria and reduced miR-184, with tubular LPP3 preservation and tubulointerstitial fibrosis amelioration. Albumin-induced miR-184 expression in tubule cells was epigenetically regulated through DNA demethylation and histone lysine acetylation and was accompanied by binding of NF-\u03baB p65 subunit to miR-184 promoter.", 
    "9": "These results suggest that miR-184 may act as a downstream effector of albuminuria through LPP3 to promote tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and offer the rationale to investigate whether targeting miR-184 in association with albuminuria-lowering drugs may be a new strategy to achieve fully anti-fibrotic effects in diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "10": "Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is associated with improved morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) on optimal medical therapy. We aimed to evaluate changes of medical therapy during CRT and its influence on the CRT response.", 
    "11": "We evaluated 85 HF patients' pharmacological treatment changes during 1-year follow-up of CRT. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS statistical software (SPSS v.21.0 for Mac OS X).", 
    "12": "Beta-blockers (BAB) were used in 81.2% of patients before CRT, and consumption increased after CRT implantation (96.5% at 1-year follow-up visit) (p<0.002). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) consumption and dose didn't significantly change statistically during the study. 55.3% of patients were taking spironolactone before CRT, and this number increased at discharge till 76.5% (p<0.001) and till 70.6% (p=0.01) at 1-year follow-up visit. The average dose of spironolactone during the study significantly decreased statistically. The use of diuretics was higher after CRT device implantation, compared with the period before CRT 80% to 84.7% (p<0.001), but torasemide dose hadn't significantly changed statistically and remained almost the same. Cardiovascular medication consumption was significantly lower before CRT, compared with discharge (p<0.001) and follow-up (p<0.001) periods. However, no statistically significant relation between pharmacological treatment and echocardiographic response was found.", 
    "13": "The present study confirmed that pharmacological treatment has changed during the period before and after CRT. But no statistically significant relation between pharmacological treatment and echocardiographic response was found.", 
    "14": "Diabetic nephropathy remains a major clinical problem. The effects of prorenin might be adverse, but the literature data are controversial. We compared the renal effects of the (pro)renin receptor ((P)RR) blockade and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the progression of diabetic nephropathy in rats.", 
    "15": "Diabetes (DM) was induced by ip. streptozotocin administration in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, followed by eight weeks of treatment with the (P)RR blocker \"handle region\" decoy peptide (HRP, 0,1 mg/kg/day) or with the ACE inhibitor Quinapril (Q, 50 mg/kg/day) and grouped as follows: 1. Control (n=10); 2. DM (n=8); 3. DM+HRP (n=6); 4. DM+Q (n=10); 5. DM+Q+HRP (n=10). Renal functional parameters, histology and gene expressions were evaluated.", 
    "16": "HRP reduced glomerulosclerosis and podocyte desmin expression, but did not affect proteinuria and tubular ERK(1/2) phosphorylation. Both Q and Q+HRP treatment reduced proteinuria, glomerular and tubular damage, tubular TGF-\u00df1 expression and ERK(1/2) phosphorylation to the same extent.", 
    "17": "The effects of HRP were partially beneficial on diabetic kidney lesions as HRP reduced damage but did not improve tubular damage and failed to reduce ERK(1/2) phosphorylation in rats. The combination of HRP with Quinapril had no additive effects over Quinapril monotherapy on the progression of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "18": "For many years heart failure (HF) was known as a fatal disease with an ominous prognosis. In the last decades better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HF has resulted in major breakthrough in the management and improvement in the natural history of this clinical syndrome. Areas covered: The review is focused on current and upcoming pharmacological therapies in patients with chronic and acute HF, starting with brief overview of drugs which improve the outcomes in patients with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) including neurohormonal antagonists, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and If- channel inhibitor, then presenting the summary of symptomatic treatment, the pharmacotherapy in chronic HF with preserved and mid-range EF and in acute HF. Finally, we report the emerging pharmacologic options and ongoing clinical trials and future directions in pharmacotherapy. Expert commentary: The guidelines-recommended therapies in HF with reduced EF need to be widely implemented into the everyday clinical practice. Better clinical characterization of HF with preserved, mid-range EF and acute HF, with better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms may ultimately result in a development of effective strategies improving ominous outcomes in these patients.", 
    "19": "This study investigated the influence of antihypertensive drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs), voltage-gated L-type calcium channel blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), on the effects of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] on aorta and coronary arteries from pressure-overloaded rats. Pressure overload was induced by abdominal aortic banding (AB). To evaluate the role of antihypertensive drugs on the effect of Ang-(1-7), AB male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g were treated with vehicle or low doses (5 mg\u00b7kg-1\u00b7day-1, gavage) of losartan, captopril, amlodipine, or spironolactone. Isolated aortic rings and isolated perfused hearts under constant flow were used to evaluate the effect of Ang-(1-7) in thoracic aorta and coronary arteries, respectively. Ang-(1-7) induced a significant relaxation in the aorta of sham animals, but this effect was reduced in the aortas of AB rats. Chronic treatments with losartan, captopril or amlodipine, but not with spironolactone, restored the Ang-(1-7)-induced aorta relaxation in AB rats. The coronary vasodilatation evoked by Ang-(1-7) in sham rats was blunted in hypertrophic rats. Only the treatment with losartan restored the coronary vasodilatory effect of Ang-(1-7) in AB rat hearts. These data support a beneficial vascular effect of an association of Ang-(1-7) and some antihypertensive drugs. Thus, this association may have potential as a new therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "20": "Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are on hemodialysis have high risk of vascular diseases. Our study sought to examine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) could reduce the frequencies of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients receiving hemodialysis using the medication possession ratio (MPR) method of analysis.This retrospective cohort study identified cases of ESRD with dialysis from the National Health Insurance Research Database between 1999 and 2006, and used Cox-regression methods to evaluate risk of poor outcomes. Primary outcomes, including death from any cause, and secondary outcomes, including admission for stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, were examined.Compared to the nonuser group, the adjusted HRs for mortality of the nonadherence group and the adherence group were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76-0.86) and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.86-1.13), respectively. Cardiovascular events were more frequent in patients with ESRD receiving ACEIs /ARBs than in nonusers. Compared with nonusers, the hazard of secondary outcome significantly increased in the nonadherence group or adherence group in 10 years follow-up.Compared with patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, patients on hemodialysis may not experience the same cardiovascular and cerebrovascular benefits from ACEIs/ARBs use.", 
    "21": "An ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry method was developed and applied to identify short angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory cryptides in Tilapia (Oreochromis Niloticus) protein hydrolyzate. A database was created with previously identified ACE-inhibitory di- and tripeptides and the lowest molecular weight fraction of Tilapia hydrolysate was analysed for coincidences. Only VW and VY were identified. Further analysis of collected fractions conducted to the identification of 51 different peptides in major fractions. 19 peptides selected were synthesised and tested for their ACE inhibitory potential. TL, TI, IK, LR, LD, IQ, DI, AILE, ALLE, ALIE and AIIE were identified as new ACE inhibitors. The findings from this study point UPLC-MS/MS combined with the creation of a database as an efficient technique to identify specific short peptides within a complex hydrolysate, in addition with de novo sequencing. This efficient characterisation of bioactive factors like cryptides in protein hydrolysates will extend their use as functional foods.", 
    "22": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular diseases often coexist. The mechanistic links between these two diseases are complex, multifactorial and not entirely understood, but they can influence the therapeutic approach. Therapy can be primarily directed towards treating the respiratory symptoms and reducing lung inflammation. Smoking cessation, bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids are central to this therapeutic approach. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that are responsible for the increased cardiovascular risk in COPD remain unclear, but might include arterial stiffness, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction as a consequence of systemic exposure to chemicals in cigarette smoke or airborne pollution. Therefore, it is plausible that treatment of cardiovascular co-morbidities might reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with COPD and, consequently, therapy of COPD should be shifted to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and systemic inflammation. In support of this approach, early data suggest that patients with COPD treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, statins, anti-platelet drugs or \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockers may have improved survival and reduced hospitalisation from acute exacerbations of COPD. In this review, the potential impact of traditional therapies for COPD that are centred on treating the lungs and newer strategies potentially able to affect and mitigate cardiovascular risks in patients with COPD are discussed."
