       "{0: u'High-end analytical methods provide excellent data but may lack the robustness required in large analytical studies. In particular complex chemical matrices may cause difficulties and increase the need for extensive sample preparation. For screening of patients we thus developed a low-tech assay to monitor bradykinin degradation by serum proteases. The bradykinin concentration mirrors the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Dabsylated bradykinin (DBK) and its labeled fragments DBK1-8 and DBK1-5 were visualized by thin-layer chromatography using only 3\\u03bcL of serum. Lower DBK1-5 levels indicated reduced ACE activity due to medication (ACE-inhibitors) or disease. Provided that purified DBK is available, the assay protocol itself is very simple and does not require any expensive high-end equipment.',\n",

       "{0: u'Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, \\u03b2-lactam antibiotics, non-\\u03b2 lactam antibiotics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the most common classes of drugs that cause angioedema. Drug-induced angioedema is known to occur via mechanisms mediated by histamine, bradykinin, or leukotriene, and an understanding of these mechanisms is crucial in guiding therapeutic decisions. Nonallergic angioedema occurs in patients with genetic variants that affect metabolism or synthesis of bradykinin, substance P, prostaglandins, or leukotrienes, or when patients are taking drugs that have synergistic mechanisms. The mainstay in treatment of nonallergic drug-induced angioedema is cessation of the offending agents.',\n",
       " 1: \"Fabry's disease (FD) is a severe congenital metabolic disorder characterized by the deficient activity of lysosomal exoglycohydrolase alpha-galactosidase, characterized by glycosphingolipid deposition in several cells, such as capillary endothelial cells, renal, cardiac, and nerve cells. As a systemic disease leading to a contemporaneous myocardial and renal dysfunction, FD might be an example of cardiorenal syndrome type 5 (CRS-5). Kidney damage is commonly characterized by proteinuria, isosthenuria and altered tubular function when occurs at the second-third decade, azotemia and end-stage renal disease in third-fifth decade. Beyond the irreversible glomerular, tubular and vascular damages, the podocytes foot process effacement is the major cause of kidney dysfunction. Myocardial damage is usually observed with right and left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias (due to sinus node and conduction system impairment), diastolic dysfunction, congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia, fibrosis and cardiac death. The enzymatic replacement therapy is essential for the management of FD, as well as the control of renal (with anti-proteinuric agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors- and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers), brain (coated aspirin, clopidogrel and statins to prevent strokes) and heart complications (calcium channel blockers for ischemic cardiomyopathy, warfarin and amiodarone or cardioverter device for arrhythmias).\",\n",
       " 2: u'The progression of chronic kidney disease CKD is largely independent of the underlying kidney disorder once renal function has fallen below a critical level. Hypertension is an independent risk factor for disease progression in both adult and pediatric patients with kidney disorders. Optimal blood pressure control (130 /80mm Hg) represents a main goal of conservative therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease CKD but it is rarely achieved in clinical practice. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are more effective than other drugs in slowing progression of proteinuric CKD. Dietary salt restriction (\\u2264100 mEq/die of NaCl) may be useful to correct the extracellular volume expansion. If this intervention fails, hypertension can be treated by thiazide diuretics in patients with mild CKD, whereas loop diuretics at adequate doses are indicated in patients with more advanced CKD.',\n",
       " 3: 'RAAS, a major pharmacological target in cardiovascular medicine, is inhibited by pharmacological classes including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin-II type 1 blockers (ARBs) and aldosterone receptors antagonists, in addition to the recently introduced direct renin inhibitors (DRIs). However, currently used RAAS inhibitors still cannot achieve their desired effects and are associated with certain drawbacks, such as adverse side effects, incomplete blockage of the system and poor end-organ protection. In this review, we discuss the efficiency and specificity of the current RAAS inhibitors and propose some recommendations for achieving better treatments with better end-organ protection.Hypertension Research advance online publication, 6 July 2017; doi:10.1038/hr.2017.65.',\n",
       " 4: 'The beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists in patients with heart failure secondary to reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are felt to result from prevention of the adverse effects of AII on systemic afterload and renal homeostasis. However, AII can activate the sympathetic nervous system and part of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and AII antagonists may result from their ability to inhibit such activation. We examined the acute effects of the ACE inhibitor captopril (25 mg, n = 9) and the AII receptor antagonist losartan (50 mg, n = 10) on hemodynamics as well as total body and cardiac norepinephrine spillover in patients with chronic HFrEF. Hemodynamic and neurochemical measurements were made at baseline and at 1, 2 and 4 hours after oral dosing. Administration of both drugs caused significant reductions in systemic arterial, cardiac filling and pulmonary artery pressures (P < 0.05 vs baseline). There was no significant difference in the magnitude of those hemodynamic effects. Plasma concentrations of AII were significantly decreased by captopril and increased by losartan (P < 0.05 vs baseline for both). Total body sympathetic activity increased in response to both captopril and losartan (P < 0.05 vs baseline for both), however there was no change in cardiac sympathetic activity in response to either drug. The results of the current study do not support the hypothesis that the acute inhibition of the renin angiotensin system has sympathoinhibitory effects in patients with chronic HFrEF.',\n",

Weighted multivariable regression was used to examine trends in rates of sudden death over time. Adjusted hazard ratios for sudden death in each trial group were calculated with the use of Cox regression models. The cumulative incidence rates of sudden death were assessed at different time points after randomization and according to the length of time between the diagnosis of heart failure and randomization.',\n",

       " 9: 'Patients with an alcohol use disorder experiencing acute intoxication or withdrawal may be at risk for electrocardiograph (ECG) abnormalities, including prolongation of repolarization (long QTc [corrected QT]) that may contribute to arrhythmias and may be associated with a threefold increase in the likelihood of sudden cardiac events. Patients with acute coronary syndrome may have prolonged QTc as well. To our knowledge, no previous studies have compared the QTc of ACS with acute ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal syndromes in the emergency department (ED). The purpose of our study was to compare the QTc of those with EtOH withdrawal emergencies with patients with ACS in our ED. Our hypothesis was that the QTc would be similarly prolonged in the two cohorts.',\n",
       " 10: u'The study compared two cohort groups, those with ACS and those with EtOH withdrawal-related ED visits over a 1-year period. We compared ECG QTc, cardiac medication use, and electrolyte differences. We considered a QTc of >450 ms elevated for men and >470 ms elevated for women based on the literature. Fifty subjects in whom an ECG, serum osmolality, and EtOH level were recorded within 2 hours of one another and who were administered a Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment protocol were compared with 203 patients with ACS during the same period. We excluded patients with incomplete data. Medications compared included clopidogrel, acetylsalicylic acid, \\u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins. ECG QT and QTc, as well as electrolytes, were recorded and compared. Data were extracted by two investigators with a 20% sample re-evaluated by the other extractor as a reliability measure. Descriptive statistics including medians and interquartile ranges were measured for continuous variables. Comparisons were made using two-tailed t tests for parametric data and the Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric data.',\n",

The mean QTc in the ACS group was 457 ms and the mean QTc in the EtOH withdrawal-related group was 468 ms (diff 11, not significant). Significantly more patients had a prolonged QTc in the EtOH withdrawal group than in the ACS group 62% vs 46%; diff 16; 95% CI (0.1, 30). There was significantly more use of clopidogrel, acetylsalicylic acid, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins (P < 0.05 for all) in the ACS group compared with the EtOH withdrawal group; however, there was no difference in \\u03b2-blocker usage. There was a significantly higher admission rate: 100% of ACS compared with 76% of the EtOH withdrawal group (P < 0.01, diff 24, 95% confidence interval 18-29). Electrolytes were not significantly different in the two groups.',\n",
       " 12: 'More patients with EtOH withdrawal-related ED visits had a long QTc than patients presenting with ACS.

If any medications that prolong the QTc are considered, then an ECG should be obtained before administering medications that may affect the myocardium to make medication safer for the patient.',\n",
       " 13: 'Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) makes up half of diagnosed heart failure cases and has similar outcomes compared to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) but a discrepancy in knowledge and approach to treatment. HFpEF is diagnosed using the following criteria: symptoms, preserved ejection fraction (greater than 50%), and evidence of abnormal left ventricular filling or relaxation, or diastolic distensibility or stiffness. Studies conducted to examine the efficacy of angiotensin receptor blockers (irbesartan and candesartan), thiazide diuretics (chlorthalidone), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (perindopril) in the treatment of HFpEF, showed moderate efficacy but no clear benefit. Recently, the FDA has approved a novel drug, which combines an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (valsartan) named LCZ696 (entresto) for possible treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In this article, we will discuss the failure of previous treatment modalities and the promise that LCZ696 (entresto) may hold for treating patients with HFpEF.',\n",
       " 14: 'Several medications have been used perioperatively in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery in an attempt to improve outcomes. Antiplatelet therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular events should generally be discontinued seven to 10 days before surgery to avoid increasing the risk of bleeding, unless the risk of a major adverse cardiac event exceeds the risk of bleeding. Antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention should be continued perioperatively, except before procedures with very high bleeding risk, such as intracranial procedures. Antiplatelet drugs should be continued and surgery delayed, if possible, for at least 14 days after percutaneous coronary intervention without stent placement, 30 days after percutaneous coronary intervention with bare-metal stent placement, and six to 12 months after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent placement. Perioperative beta blockers are recommended for patients already receiving these agents, and it is reasonable to consider starting therapy in patients with known or strongly suspected coronary artery disease or who are at high risk of perioperative cardiac events and are undergoing procedures with a high risk of cardiovascular complications. Long-term statin therapy should be continued perioperatively or started in patients with clinical indications who are not already receiving statins. Clonidine should not be started perioperatively, but long-term clonidine regimens may be continued. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers generally can be continued perioperatively if patients are hemodynamically stable and have good renal function and normal electrolyte levels.',\n",

Renin blockade as the first step of the RAAS cascade finally became possible in 2007 with the approval of aliskiren, the first orally active direct renin inhibitor available for clinical use and the newest antihypertensive agent on the market. In the last decade, many clinical trials and meta-analyses have been conducted concerning the efficacy and safety of aliskiren in comparison to other antihypertensive agents, as well as the efficacy and potential clinical use of various combinations. Large trials with cardiovascular and renal endpoints attempted to show potential benefits of aliskiren beyond blood pressure lowering, as well as morbidity and mortality outcomes in specific populations such as diabetics, heart failure patients, and post-myocardial infarction individuals.
