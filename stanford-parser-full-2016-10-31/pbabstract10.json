Metabolic disease is one such multifactorial disorder characterized by hyperglycaemia, hypertension and dyslipidaemia among others. In this paper we report a new class of molecular framework combining the pharmacophoric features of DPP4 inhibitors with those of ACE inhibitors to afford potent dual inhibitors of DPP4 and ACE.",

    "2": "Forty-seven hypertensive patients who underwent transcutaneous CO2 therapy were enrolled. Thirty healthy individuals were recruited for the control group. Blood samples were taken one hour before, as well as one hour, 24 hours and 3 weeks after the first CO2 treatment. Controls did not undergo CO2 treatment. Plasma ADMA levels were measured by ELISA.", 
    "3": "ADMA levels decreased significantly one hour after the first CO2 treatment compared to the baseline concentrations (p=0.003). Significantly greater reduction was found among patients in whom angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) were administered (p=0.019).", 
    "4": "The short- and long-term decrease of ADMA levels suggests that CO2 is not only a vasodilator, but also has a beneficial effect on the NO pathway. ACE inhibition seems to enhance the effect of CO2 treatment.", 
    "5": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to progression of diabetic nephropathy, which promotes end-stage renal failure in diabetic patients. This study was undertaken to investigate the actions of tempol and ramipril, pharmacological agents that target the consequences of NADPH oxidase, on diabetic nephropathy in a rat model of type 1 diabetes, with an emphasis on markers of ER stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intravenously with a single bolus of streptozotocin (55mg/kg) to induce type 1 diabetes. An additional age-matched group of rats was administered with citrate vehicle as controls. After 4 weeks of untreated diabetes, rats received tempol (1.5mM/kg/day subcutaneously, n=8), ramipril (1mg/kg/day in drinking water, n=8) or remained untreated for an additional 4 weeks (n=7). After 8 weeks of diabetes in total, kidneys were collected for histological analysis, gene expression and protein abundance. Tempol and ramipril blunted diabetes-induced upregulation of NADPH oxidase isoforms (Nox4, Nox2, p47(phox)), accompanied by an amelioration of diabetes-induced glomerular injury (podocin, nephrin, Kim-1), tubulo-interstitial fibrosis (TGF\u03b21, TGF\u03b2-R2, pSMAD3, \u03b1-SMA) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, MCP-1, ANX-A1, FPR2) expression. In addition, the diabetes-induced renal ER stress, evidenced by increased expression of GRP-78 chaperone and stress-associated markers ATF4, TRB3, as well as XBP1s, phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and 3-nitrotyrosination, were all attenuated by tempol and ramipril. These observations suggest that antioxidant approaches that blunt NADPH upregulation may attenuate diabetic nephropathy, at least in part by negatively regulating ER stress and inflammation, and hence ameliorating kidney damage.", 
    "6": "Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, e.g. H2O2, nitric oxide) confer redox regulation of essential cellular signaling pathways such as cell differentiation, proliferation, migration and apoptosis. At higher concentrations, ROS and RNS lead to oxidative stress and oxidative damage of biomolecules (e.g. via formation of peroxynitrite, fenton chemistry). Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is characterized by severe ischemic conditions in the periphery leading to intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia (end stage). It is well known that redox biology and oxidative stress play an important role in this setting. We here discuss the major pathways of oxidative stress and redox signaling underlying the disease progression with special emphasis on the contribution of inflammatory processes. We also highlight therapeutic strategies comprising pharmacological (e.g. statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, phosphodiesterase inhibition) and non-pharmacological (e.g. exercise) interventions. Both of these strategies induce potent indirect antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms that may contribute to an improvement of PAD associated complications and disease progression by removing excess formation of ROS and RNS (e.g. by ameliorating primary complications such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension) as well as the normalization of the inflammatory phenotype suppressing the progression of atherosclerosis.", 
    "7": "Background Long-term use of evidence-based medications is recommended by international guidelines for the management of stable coronary artery disease, however, non-adherence to medications is common. This meta-analysis aims to systematically evaluate the impact of medication adherence on clinical outcomes in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Methods Articles from January 1960-December 2015 were retrieved from the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases without any language restriction. A meta-analysis was performed to investigate the risk ratios of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction/hospitalization between groups with good medication adherence and poor medication adherence. Studies were independently reviewed by two investigators. Data from eligible studies were extracted, and the meta-analysis was performed using R Version 3.1.0 software. Results A total of 10 studies were included in the analysis, with a total of 106,002 coronary artery disease patients. The results showed that good adherence to evidence-based medication regimens, including \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, antiplatelet drugs, and statins, was related to a lower risk of all-cause mortality(risk ratio 0.56; 95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.69), cardiovascular mortality(risk ratio 0.66; 95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.87), and cardiovascular hospitalization/myocardial infarction(risk ratio 0.61; 95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.82). Conclusions This meta-analysis confirms the significant impact of good medication adherence on clinical outcomes in patients with stable coronary artery disease. More strategy and planning are needed to improve medication adherence.", 
    "8": "EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas contain a subpopulation of cells that have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and can grow independently of EGFR. To kill these cancer cells, we need a novel therapeutic approach other than EGFR inhibitors. If a molecule is specifically expressed on the cell surface of such EGFR-independent EGFR-mutant cancer cells, it can be a therapeutic target. We found that a mesenchymal EGFR-independent subline derived from HCC827\u00a0cells, an EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line, expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to a greater extent than its parental cells. ACE2 was also expressed at least partially in most of the primary EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas examined, and the ACE2 expression level in the cancer cells was much higher than that in normal lung epithelial cells. In addition, we developed an anti-ACE2 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb), termed H8R64, that was internalized by ACE2-expressing cells. If an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of a humanized mAb based on H8R64 and a potent anticancer drug were produced, it could be effective for the treatment of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas.",

    "10": "The aim of the study was to assess inappropriate antihypertensive prescriptions to older patients.", 
    "11": "An observational, prospective multicentric study was conducted to assess potentially inappropriate prescription of antihypertensive drugs, in patients aged 75\u00a0years and older with arterial hypertension (HTN), in the month prior to hospital admission, using four instruments: Beers, Screening Tool of Older Person's Prescriptions (STOPP), Screening Tool to Alert Doctors to the Right Treatment (START) and Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders 3 (ACOVE-3). Primary care and hospital electronic records were reviewed for HTN diagnoses, antihypertensive treatment and blood pressure readings.", 
    "12": "Of 672 patients, 532 (median age 85\u00a0years, 56% female) had HTN. 21.6% received antihypertensive monotherapy, 4.7% received no hypertensive treatment, and the remainder received a combination of antihypertensive therapies. The most frequently prescribed antihypertensive drugs were diuretics (53.5%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (41%), calcium antagonists (32.2%), angiotensin receptor blockers (29.7%) and beta-blockers (29.7%). Potentially inappropriate prescription was observed in 51.3% of patients (27.8% overprescription and 35% underprescription). The most frequent inappropriately prescribed drugs were calcium antagonists (overprescribed), ACEIs and beta-blockers (underprescribed). ACEI and beta-blocker underprescriptions were independently associated with heart failure admissions [beta-blockers odds ratio (OR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-0.71, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; ACEIs OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.36-0.70, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001].",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarize cardiovascular medication use between 1995-2015 and to assess factors in associated with the trends in cardiovascular medications.", 
    "15": "A systematic search was conducted in four databases (Pubmed, Embase, CENTRAL, and CNKI) to obtain observational studies published between 1995 and 2015, reporting on the use of cardiovascular medications in China. Risk of bias of individual studies was appraised and selected studies were pooled for estimated prevalence of cardiovascular medication. Prevalence of cardiovascular medication use for 1995 and 2015 was estimated by random effects meta-regression model.", 
    "16": "From 13,940 identified publications, 35 studies, comprising 28,000 patients, were included. The pooled prevalence for aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, ACE-Inhibitors, ACE-Inhibitor/ARBs and nitrates was 92% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89-0.95], 63% (95% CI: 0.57-0.69), 72% (95% CI: 0.60-0.82), 49% (95% CI: 0.41-0.57), 59% (95% CI: 0.48-0.69) and 79% (95% CI: 0.74-0.91), respectively. A significant increase in beta-blocker and statin use and a decrease of nitrate use was observed over time. The estimated prevalence of beta-blockers, statins, and nitrates was 78%, 91.1%, and 59.3% in 2015, compared to 32%, 17% and 96% in 1995, respectively.",

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in elderly patients undergoing surgery and is associated with the clinical outcome. We evaluated the incidence and risk factors of AKI in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery and the impact of AKI on short- and long-term clinical outcomes.", 
    "20": "We performed a retrospective cohort study of 450 elderly patients who underwent hip fracture surgery between January 2010 and December 2012. We defined AKI according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria and investigated the effect of AKI on the duration of hospital stay and in-hospital and long-term mortality.", 
    "21": "Of the 450 patients, 95 (21.1%) developed AKI during hospitalization and 178 (39.6%) died, with a mean follow-up of 3.6 \u00b1 1.0 years. The baseline serum creatinine level, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, red blood cell transfusion volume, and history of coronary artery disease were independent risk factors for AKI. Patients with AKI during hospitalization had significantly longer hospital stays and higher in-hospital and long-term mortality than those without AKI. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, history of coronary artery disease, serum albumin level, and AKI were independent predictors of long-term mortality.",

    "24": "The study included all type 2 diabetic patients over 40 years, members of one District of Clalit Health Services Israel, who were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus before 2008 and who filled at least one prescription per year during 2008-2010, for the following medications: metformin, glibenclamide, acarbose, statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs). Purchase of at least 9 monthly prescriptions during 2009 was considered \"good medication persistence\". We compared HbA1c and LDL levels, according to medication persistence, for each medication; and cross persistence rates between medications.", 
    "25": "21,357 patients were included. Average age was 67.0\u00b111.0years, 48.9% were men, and 35.8% were from low SES. Good medication persistence rates for ARBs were 78.8%, ACEI 69.0%, statins 66.6%, acarbose 67.8%, metformin 58.6%, and glibenclamide 55.3%. Good persistence to any of the medications tested was associated with a higher rate of good persistence to other medications. Patients who took more medications had better persistence rates.", 
    "26": "Different oral medications used by diabetic patients have different persistence rates. Good persistence for any one medication is an indicator of good persistence to other medications. Investment in enhancing medication persistence in persons with diabetes may improve persistence to other medications, as well as improve glycemic control.", 
    "27": "Diabetes is an enormous and ever-growing calamity and a global public health threat of the 21st century. Besides insulin and oral hypoglycaemic drugs, blockage of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) denotes a key pharmacotherapy for the management of cardiovascular (CVD) and chronic kidney diseases (CKD), which are the leading causes of disability and death among diabetic patients. Neprilysin (NEP) inhibition, auxiliary to RAS blockage increases the bioavailability of natriuretic peptides and benefits the cardio-renal system. Omapatrilat, a dual angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and NEP inhibitor has been reported to show superior anti-hypertensive, anti-atherosclerotic, insulin-sensitizing, cardiovascular and renoprotective effects to ACE inhibitors in experimental animal models for diabetes. In clinical trials on hypertensive subjects Omapatrilat increased the risk of angioedema due to which its further development as anti-hypertensive drug was hampered. This event prompted the development of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi). The first representative of ARNi, LCZ696 (Sacubitril/ Valsartan) halted cardiovascular and renal functional decline and hence protected against CKD and CVD. Recently, LCZ696 was approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of heart failure. This concise review intends to summarise the currently available reports on NEPi as a therapeutic intervention to treat CVD and CKD associated with diabetes."
