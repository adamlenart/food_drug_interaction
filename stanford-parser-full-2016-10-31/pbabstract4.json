Icatibant is a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist that may be beneficial in patients with ACE-I-induced angioedema.", 
    "1": "We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of icatibant in subjects with ACE-I-induced angioedema.", 
    "2": "At 31 centers in 4 countries, adults on ACE-Is who presented within 12 hours of the onset of at least moderately severe angioedema were randomized 1:1 to icatibant 30 mg or placebo administered subcutaneously. The primary efficacy end point was time to meeting discharge criteria after study drug administration, based on the severity of airway symptoms assessed hourly by a blinded physician using clinical ratings across 4 domains.", 
    "3": "A total of 121 subjects were randomized (icatibant, n\u00a0= 61; placebo, n\u00a0= 60); 118 received treatment a median of\u00a07.8 hours from symptom onset. We observed no difference in\u00a0time to meeting discharge criteria between groups (median, 4.0 hours in each group; P\u00a0= .63). There also was no difference in time to onset of symptom relief (median, icatibant, 2.0 hours; placebo, 1.6 hours; P\u00a0= .57) or any other secondary end point. Similar findings were noted in prespecified and post hoc subgroup analyses stratified by symptom severity, time interval to treatment, age, and other clinical covariates. No new safety signals were detected.",

    "5": "The objective of this article is to review the available studies regarding angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers and their effect on patients at risk for anaphylaxis. A literature search was conducted in PUBMED to identify peer-reviewed articles using the following keywords: anaphylaxis, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, food allergy, radiocontrast media, venom allergy, skin testing, and immunotherapy. Some studies show an increased risk of anaphylaxis in patients who are taking ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, whereas others studies do not show an increased risk. For venom immunotherapy, there are more data supporting the concomitant use of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors in the build-up and maintenance phases. Most of the medical literature is limited to case reports and retrospective data. Prospective controlled trials are needed on this important topic. For those patients at risk of anaphylaxis who lack cardiovascular disease, it is recommended to avoid beta-blockers and possibly ACE inhibitors. However, for those patients with cardiovascular disease, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have been shown to increase life expectancy. Consideration should be given for the concomitant use of these medications while patients are receiving venom immunotherapy.", 
    "6": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an enlargement of the abdominal aorta. It is a common disease in the elderly, with a prevalence of 1-5%. An AAA is normally asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is often incidental, identified when a patient is examined for other conditions. The major risk of having an AAA is sudden rupture and death caused by massive hemorrhaging. As rupture risk increases with increasing AAA diameter, the current management strategies include regular imaging surveillance and elective repair before rupture occurs. Ruptured AAA (rAAA) carries high mortality, and an identification of a drug or compound with the potential to halt the growth of an AAA and/or reduce the risk of a rAAA is needed. Thus, the aims of this thesis were to examine the clinical impact of treatment with statins (Study I), reninangiotensin system (RAS) blockers (Study II), and low-dose aspirin (ASA)(Study III) on the risk of rAAA and case fatality following rAAA. The thesis is based on three nation-wide, combined case-control and follow-up studies using data from Danish population-based health-care and administrative registries. In Study I (1996-2008), we included 3,691 patients with an incident diagnosis of rAAA (cases). For the risk analyses, we matched 3,584 rAAA cases to 3,584 age- and sex-matched patients with an incident diagnosis of AAA (controls). Current statin use was associated with a lower risk of rAAA, adjusted odds ratio (OR): 0.73 (95% CI: 0.61;0.86), compared to never use of statins. Furthermore, current statin use was associated with a lower 30-day case fatality following rAAA, adjusted mortality rate ratio (MRR): 0.80 (95% CI: 0.68;0.95). In Study II (1996-2012), we identified 4,052 rAAA cases and 10,549 AAA controls. We were unable to demonstrate any association between the current use of either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and the risk of rAAA, adjusted ORs: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.85;1.07) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.79;1.09), respectively. The results were robust in supplemental propensity score matched analyses. Likewise, no association between current use of RAS-blockers and 30-day case fatality was found. In Study III (1996-2012), 4,055 rAAA cases were included. The adjusted OR for the risk of rAAA in ASA users compared to non-users was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86;1.08). However, ASA use was associated with an unfavorable 30-day case fatality, adjusted MRR 1.17 (95% CI: 1.06;1.28), corresponding to an excessive rAAA case fatality in ASA users of nearly 20%. In conclusion, we found an approximately 25% lower risk of rAAA and 20% lower 30-day case fatality in statin-treated patients. Furthermore, we found an almost 20% higher 30-day case fatality following rAAA in ASA treated patients. No association between the use of RAS-blockers and the risk of rAAA or case fatality following rAAA was found. Similarly, we found no association between the use of ASA and the risk of rAAA.",

Monthly medicine expenditure, medicine consumption, changes in medicine use, and market competition (Herfindahl-Hirschman index) were determined to assess the TRP impact on market dynamics. Interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the TRP cost-saving potential.", 
    "9": "Medicine expenditure in all three therapeutic classes was decreasing prior to TRP; however, with the TRP introduction, the cost for ACEIs and LLAs fell 25 and 45%, respectively. The costs for PPIs decreased by 10%, but the cost reductions before TRP were greater. After TRP introduction, the downward trend for monthly medicine expenditure was less steep; coefficient changes from -20,798 to -363 for PPIs (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), from -18,175 to -4862 for ACEIs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and from -10,669 to -2761 for LLAs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.105) were observed. Consumption of any therapeutic class or their market competition were not changed significantly. An increased use of the reference pantoprazole (PPIs) was observed and the market position of ezetimibe was deteriorated significantly after TRP introduction. However, the demand for the references simvastatin (LLAs) and ramipril (ACEIs) did not increase.",

    "14": "No differences between treated groups and placebo in adverse events or in study completion. The primary endpoint, change from baseline in ADAS-Cog11, was not met. At Week 52, the difference between sembragiline and placebo in ADAS-Cog11 change from baseline was - 0.15 (p\u200a=\u200a0.865) and 0.90 (p\u200a=\u200a0.312) for 1 and 5\u200amg groups, respectively. Relative to placebo at Week 52 (but not at prior assessment times), the 1\u200amg and 5\u200amg sembragiline groups showed differences in ADCS-ADL of 2.64 (p\u200a=\u200a0.051) and 1.89 (p\u200a=\u200a0.160), respectively. A treatment effect in neuropsychiatric symptoms (as assessed by the difference between sembragiline and placebo on BEHAVE-AD-FW) was also seen at Week 52 only: - 2.80 (p\u200a=\u200a0.014; 1\u200amg) and - 2.64 (p\u200a=\u200a0.019; 5\u200amg), respectively.

    "17": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an HF-PDM clinic on adherence to evidence-based HF medication therapy.", 
    "18": "In this retrospective cohort study, we identified patients discharged from the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System between 2009 and 2012 with a primary diagnosis of HF. Data from patients who attended the HF-PDM clinic immediately following HF-related hospitalization between 2010 and 2012 were compared with those from historical controls, who did not attend the HF-PDM clinic, from 2009. The main outcome was adherence to evidence-based HF medications during the 90 days after discharge. Adherence was defined as the proportion of days covered at 90 days after discharge (PDC-90) of \u22650.80. The percentages of patients adherent to each medication were compared between the 2 groups using the \u03c7(2) test. A logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounding variables was constructed to evaluate the percentages of patients adherent to evidence-based HF medications.", 
    "19": "A total of 277 patients (144 clinic, 133 control) were included in the study. Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the clinic was associated with improved medication adherence to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, a twice-daily \u03b2-blocker, and aldosterone antagonists compared with controls. The most significant increases were in adherence to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, with mean PDC-90 values of 0.84 (control) versus 0.93 (clinic) (P = 0.008) and 90-day adherence rates of 69% (control) versus 87% (clinic) (P = 0.005).",

    "21": "We investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg), a major tea catechin. EGCg inhibited both the ACE activity in the lysate of human colorectal cancer cells and human recombinant ACE (rh-ACE) in a dose-dependent manner. Co-incubation with zinc sulfate showed no influence on the rh-ACE inhibition by EGCg, whereas it completely counteracted the inhibitory effect of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, a chelating-type ACE inhibitor. Although hydrogen peroxide was produced by the autoxidation of EGCg, hydrogen peroxide itself had little effect on the ACE activity. Conversely, the co-incubation of EGCg with borate or ascorbic acid significantly diminished the EGCg inhibition. A redox-cycling staining experiment revealed that rh-ACE was covalently modified by EGCg. A Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis indicated that EGCg inhibited the ACE activity in a non-competitive manner. These results suggested that EGCg might allosterically inhibit the ACE activity through oxidative conversion into an electrophilic quinone.", 
    "22": "Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASIs), including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin AT1 receptor blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), are the cornerstone for the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases. Areas covered: The authors searched MEDLINE, PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify eligible full-text English language papers. Herein, the authors discuss AT2-receptor agonists and ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas-receptor axis modulators, direct renin inhibitors, brain aminopeptidase A inhibitors, biased AT1R blockers, chymase inhibitors, multitargeted drugs, vaccines and aldosterone receptor antagonists as well as aldosterone synthase inhibitors. Expert opinion: Preclinical studies have demonstrated that activation of the protective axis of the RAAS represents a novel therapeutic strategy for treating cardiovascular and renal diseases, but there are no clinical trials supporting our expectations. Non-steroidal MRAs might become the third-generation of MRAs for the treatment of heart failure, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. The main challenge for these new drugs is that conventional RAASIs are safe, effective and cheap generics. Thus, the future of new RAASIs will be directed by economical/strategic reasons.", 
    "23": "Tuberous sclerosis or tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant inherited neurocutaneous disorder that variably affects the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, and other organs. It is characterized by skin and renal lesions in addition to central and peripheral nervous system tumors, with neurological and psychiatric findings. We report such a rare case of tuberous sclerosis in a 25-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain and hypertension. Physical examination showed dermatological signs that included hypopigmented maculae, shagreen plaque, angiofibromas on the centrofacial areas, periungual fibromas on toes, and molluscum pendulum around the neck. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed bilateral renal angiomyolipoma. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed subependymal nodules and cortical tubers. She also presented retinal and oral lesions. Our patient has a definitive diagnosis of TSC. Hypertension was related to the renal involvement of TSC, and the patient benefitted from oral angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors with a favorable outcome.", 
    "24": "BACKGROUND Bradykinin is an underestimated mediator of angioedema. One subgroup of bradykinin induced angioedema is angioedema triggered by treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Due to its localization in the head and neck region and its unpredictable course, it is a possibly life-threatening condition. There is not an officially approved treatment for ACE inhibitor induced angioedema. CASE REPORT We present a case of an 83-year-old woman, who presented to our ENT department because of acute swelling of the tongue. On admission, there was no pharyngeal or laryngeal edema and no dyspnea. Treatment with glucocorticoids and antihistamines had no response. The patient had ramipril as regular medication, so we assumed ACE inhibitor induced angioedema and treated consequently with C1-inhibitor (human) 1,500 IU. Nevertheless, swelling was progressive and required intubation. Even after the second specific treatment with icatibant, her angioedema subsided extremely slowly. The patient also had regular treatment with saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, so we assumed that the simultaneous inhibition of two bradykinin degrading enzymes led to a treatment-refractory course of angioedema. CONCLUSIONS General awareness for bradykinin induced angioedema due to regular medication is limited. Our case demonstrated the importance of improving awareness and knowledge about this side effect. We need a better understanding of the pathomechanism to aid in more precise clinical diagnosis. Securing the patient's airway as well as administration of an officially approved therapy is of utmost importance. As the number of patients simultaneously treated with antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs is likely to increase, the incidence of bradykinin mediated drug induced angioedema is likely to increase as well."
