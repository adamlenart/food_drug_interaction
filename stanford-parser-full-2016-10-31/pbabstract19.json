The observation included 957 patients. Prematurely retired from the study 17patients completed the observation in accordance with the protocol of 940 people.", 
    "2": "Of the patients included men was 40.8%, 28.1% smokers , obese patients were 32.2% , cholesterol >5.0 mmol/l - 54.1%, diabetes - 13.3% . Angina was at 19.5% of patients had previous myocardial infarction, 5.3%, 3.7% of stroke, heart failure, was at 26.5% . Previously treated with 16% of patients , 53% had received monotherapy 2-koponentnuyu - 35% 3-component therapy and more 13% of patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme obtained 50.9% of the patients, 20.2% Sartana, diuretics - 22.9%, -blockers - 25.8%, calcium antagonists - 13.6% other drugs - 2.2%. With the inclusion in the program every fifth patient had BP Stage I level and included patients had hypertension II degree. The mean duration of disease was 7.0+/-6.2 years (median 5 years). When replacing the previously used ACE inhibitors or sartans on mouth-dispersible form of perindopril arginine BP decreased from 140,9+/-12.7/84.2+/-7.6 to 127.0+/-8.4/78.1+/-5.8 mm Hg. Target BP <140/90 mm Hg 91.4% of patients reached after 3 months of treatment. Adherence to the treatment of patients improved significantly and the total score increased from an average of 2.76+/-1.25 to 3.57+/-0.89 points (p<0.00001). When filling out a special questionnaire >2/3 of patients agreed or strongly agreed with the statements that orodispersible form is more easy to use, dissolves quickly and easily swallowed, is more convenient for the reception is at home or traveling.",

Median \"onset of symptoms - first medical contact\" time was 3.4 (1.0-16.8) hours, \"first medical contact - hospital admission\" time - 1.5 (1.0-3.1) hours. Cardiac troponin was determined in 76% of pts. Coronary angiography was carried out in 70 and 46% of pts with STE and non-STE ACS, respectively. (16% of all patients hospitalized in \"noninvasive\" cetnters were transferred for angiography to invasive ones). Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed in 39% of patients with STEACS (in 65% of them with \"door to pPCI\" time less or equal 90 min). Thrombolytic therapy (TLT) was administered to 32% of pts (in half of them prehospitally). Overall reperfusion therapy received 68% of pts. Among non-STEACS pts rate of PCI was 20% (1/3 of procedures within 2, 1/3 - >2-24hours). Inhospital antiplatelet therapy (APT) included aspirin (88%), clopidogrel (71%), ticagrelor (14%); 86% of pts received dual APT.

    "8": "We report the case of a 41-year-old male patient with juvenile onset refractory hypertension while taking four drugs including a diuretic. Fourteen years before he underwent a complete investigation for secondary hypertension (including the aldosterone to renin ratio-ARR) that was negative. Since that, hypertension control gradually worsened, hypertensive organ damage aggravated and hypokalemia developed in spite of ACE inhibitor treatment. At the re-evaluation ARR was elevated, and the further workup for primary aldosteronism demonstrated an unilateral aldosterone producing adenoma that was surgically removed, with subsequent optimal blood pressure control with two anti-hypertensive drugs. In this case, the failure of the first screening prevented a correct diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, with consequent inadequate blood pressure control in following years and end organ damage. The case suggests the need of clinical follow-up and eventual reappraisal of patients showing a condition of refractory hypertension associated with hypokalemia despite a first negative screening test.",

    "11": "Of 103 children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, 25(24.3%) were steroid resistant, of whom 17 received additional medications. Full remission rate for cyclosporine was 70% (7/10). Remission rates prior to the availability of cyclosporine were 40% (2/5) for cyclophosphamide and 66% (2/3), (partial remission only) with enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor used in combination with alternate day prednisolone. One child with cyclophosphamide resistance subsequently achieved remission with cyclosporine. Remission was not related to sex (p=0.96), age (p=0.54), serum albumin (p=0.37) or hypertension (p=0.43) but to serum cholesterol (p= 0.02). The estimated glomerular filteration rate (eGFR) among children treated with cyclosporine ranged from 30-167 ml/min/1.73m(2) as follows: >90 (5); 60-89 (3); 30-59 (2) while the mean pre and post treatment eGFR in those with eGFR <90 were 60 and 104ml/min/1.73m(2) respectively (p=0.03).

    "13": "The leptin-deficient BTBRob/ob mouse develops progressive albuminuria and morphological lesions similar to human diabetic nephropathy (DN), although whether glomerular hyperfiltration, a recognized feature of early DN that may contribute to renal injury, also occurs in this model is not known. Leptin replacement has been shown to reverse the signs of renal injury in this model, but in contrast, the expected renoprotection by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in BTBRob/ob mice seems to be limited. Therefore, to investigate the potential renal benefits of improved metabolic control in this model, we studied the effect of treatment with the dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b1/\u03b3 agonist AZD6610 and compared it with the ACE inhibitor enalapril. AZD6610 lowered plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations and increased liver size, but had no significant effect in reducing albuminuria, whereas enalapril did have an effect. Nephrin and WT1 mRNA expression decreased in the kidneys of BTBRob/ob mice, consistent with podocyte injury and loss, but was unaffected by either drug treatment: at the protein level, both nephrin and WT1-positive cells per glomerulus were decreased. Mesangial matrix expansion was reduced in AZD6610-treated mice. GFR, measured by creatinine clearance, was increased in BTBRob/ob mice, but unaffected by either treatment. Unexpectedly, enalapril-treated mice showed intrarenal arteriolar vascular remodeling with concentric thickening of vessel walls. In summary, we found that the BTBRob/ob mouse model shows some similarities to the early changes seen in human DN, but that ACE inhibition or PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 agonism afforded limited or no kidney protection.", 
    "14": "Angioedema is a condition in which an increase in vascular permeability leads to the swelling of body tissues. There are both hereditary and acquired forms of the disease, with the latter often associated with the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medication. Involvement of the intestinal tract is a rare manifestation of angioedema, and can present with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. It is critical for radiologists to be aware of this entity, as they may have the only opportunity to make the diagnosis. We present three cases of intestinal angioedema diagnosed on MRI with discussion of the imaging findings.",

High risk patients were randomized into 2 treatment groups: NT-proBNP based (group I, n=35) and standard (group II, n=35) therapy. At study closure we formed another group consisting of group I and II participants noncomplaint with study protocol (group NC, n=10). Groups practically did not differ by main clinical functional characteristics. Aim of treatment was lowering of NT-proBNP level below 1000 picog/ml or more or equal 50% from baseline. At discharge median NT-proBNP concentration was 3750.0 (2224.0; 6613.0), 2783.0 (2021.5; 4827.5), and 2162.0 (1684.5; 5750.0) picog/ml in groups I, II, and NC, respectively (=0.315).",

After 6 months changes of doses of neuro-hormonal modulators in group I were more pronounced than in group II. NT-proBNP concentration decreased by 53% down to 1585.5 (976,6; 2742,5) picog/ml, =0.001, and by 10.2% in groups I and II, respectively (between group =0.001). In group I compared with II we observed more pronounced improvement of clinical functional indicators, quality of life, and parameters of systolic and diastolic LV function (<0.05), fewer cardiovascular deaths (4 vs. 10, =0.033) and repeat decompensations and rehospitalizations because CHF (4 vs. 14, =0.007).", 
    "24": "Compared with standard therapy long-term NT-proBNP guided treatment of high risk patients significantly significantly decreased rate of CV deaths and repeat decompensations and rehospitalizations because CHF, and more effectively influenced clinical and functional state, quality of life and main echocardiographical parameters of LV systolic and diastolic function.",

If target BP (<140 and 90 mm Hg) was not achieved after 2 weeks, doses were increased to 160/12.5 and 20/12.5 mg, respectively. Patients in whom target BP was not achieved after another 2 weeks were excluded from the study. Follow - up after achieving target BP was 12 weeks.", 
    "27": "Both combinations significantly (p<0.001) reduced office systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), however, BP decrease in group I was significantly (p<0.01) greater (-42.0+/-2,7 /-22.2+/-1.2 mm Hg) than in group II (-26,4+/-2,1/-6.6+/-0.4 mm Hg). Significant reduction of day- and night-time BP (p<0.001) observed in both groups was also more pronounced (p<0.01) in group I. In both groups we recorded significant (p<0.01) decreases of BP variability and morning BP rise. Variability of DBP at night (-3.3+/-0.2 mm Hg), magnitude and speed of morning DBP surge (-20.9+/-0.3 mm Hg and -3.4+/-0.2 mm Hg/hour, respectively) in group I decreased significantly (p<0.05) greater compared with same parameters in group II (-2.5+/-0.2 mm Hg, -17.7+/-0.3 mm Hg, -2.6+/-0.2 mm Hg/hour, respectively).", 
    "28": "Fixed-dose combinations of RAAS blockers and HCT provided reliable reduction of BP, BP variability, morning BP rise, and high percentage of achievement of target BP. Val/HCT combination was more effective in terms of reducing SBP, DBP and pulse BP levels at routine measurement, and day- and night-time SBP and DBP, night-time DBP variability, and rate of morning DBP rise.", 
    "29": "In work reported here, a proteolytic extract prepared from Maclura pomifera latex was employed to hydrolyze bovine caseins. Densitograms of Tricine-sodium-dodecyl-sulfate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicated that the caseins were considerably degraded after a 10-min reaction. The degree of hydrolysis determined by the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic-acid method was 17.1\u00b10.7% after 180min of digestion. The concentration of small peptides increased with hydrolysis time, and analysis by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP HPLC) and mass spectrometry, revealed a virtually unchanged peptide profile. These results suggested that those proteases were highly specific, as only certain peptide bonds were cleaved. The hydrolysate of 180min displayed the highest inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) showing an IC50 of 1.72\u00b10.25mg/mL, and the analysis of the peptide fractionation in this hydrolysate by RP HPLC exhibited two peaks responsible for that activity. Fragmentation analysis through the use of iterated matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS) with the aid of bioinformatics tools enabled us to deduce two peptide sequences-one, YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV, having been previously reported as an ACE-inhibitor; the other, RFFVAPFPE, as yet undescribed. The presence of bioactive peptides in these casein hydrolysates argues for their potential use in the development of functional foods.",

    "33": "We showed that mangiferin binds to all enzymes by \u03c0-\u03c0 and hydrogen bonds mostly. Allosteric sites were identified by SiteMap and mangiferin was docked to both allosteric and orthosteric sites of \u03b1-glucosidase by \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. However, several hydrogen bonds were observed at the orthosteric position, suggesting a preference for this site. The docking of mangiferin on AChE with the catalytic pocket occupied by paraoxon could be attributed to \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking involving amino acid residues, Trp341 and Trp124.",
