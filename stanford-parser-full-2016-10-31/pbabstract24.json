    "0": "Aims The high risk of recurrent events in patients with reduced renal function following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may in part be due to suboptimal secondary prevention. We aimed to describe the association between renal dysfunction and the prescription, initiation and persistent use of secondary prevention during the first year after a first ACS. Methods We identified all patients admitted to any Swedish coronary care unit for a first ACS between 2005 and 2010 ( n\u2009=\u200977,432). In 75,129 patients, creatinine levels were available in order to obtain the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Persistent use of prescribed drugs was determined for 1 year using the National Prescription Registry, with complete coverage of all prescribed and dispensed drugs in Sweden. Results After adjustment for relative and absolute contraindications, compared to patients with eGFR\u2009\u2265\u200960\u2009mL/min/1.73 m(2), patients with eGFR 30-59 had higher odds of not being prescribed acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; odds ratio [OR]: 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47-1.67), statins (OR: 2.94, 95% CI: 2.86-3.13) or \u03b2-blockade (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.18-1.32). Patients with eGFR 30-59 were more likely to discontinue treatment with ASA (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.42-1.56), statins (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.29-1.41), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.31-1.43) or \u03b2-blockade (HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.18-1.27). Patients with eGFR\u2009<\u200930 showed a similar pattern in both prescription and discontinuation. Conclusion High-risk ACS patients with reduced renal function are less likely to be prescribed secondary prevention drugs at discharge, are less likely to initiate treatment when being prescribed these drugs, are less likely to be persistent in the use of these drugs and more often discontinue treatment.", 
    "1": "Health-promoting effects of kefir may be partially caused by bioactive peptides. To evaluate their formation or degradation during gastrointestinal digestion, we monitored changes of the peptide profile in a model of (1) oral, (2) gastric, and (3) small intestinal digestion of kefir. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy analyses revealed clearly different profiles between digests 2/3 and kefir/digest 1. Subsequent ultraperformance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry identified 92 peptides in total (25, 25, 43, and 30, partly overlapping in kefir and digests 1, 2, and 3, respectively), including 16 peptides with ascribed bioactivity. Relative quantification in scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mode showed that many bioactive peptides were released by simulated digestion. Most prominently, the concentration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor \u03b2-casein203-209 increased approximately 10\u202f000-fold after combined oral, gastric, and intestinal digestion. Thus, physiological digestive processes may promote bioactive peptide formation from proteins and oligopeptides in kefir. Furthermore, bioactive peptides present in certain compartments of the gastrointestinal tract may exert local physiological effects.", 
    "2": "Cardiovascular diseases including hypertension are often associated with behavioural alterations. The aim of this study was to show, whether ivabradine, the blocker of If-channel in sinoatrial node, is able to modify the behaviour of rats in L-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced hypertension and to compare the effect of ivabradine with captopril and melatonin. 12-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into the following groups: controls, ivabradine (10 mg/kg/24 h), L-NAME (40 mg/kg/24 h), L-NAME + ivabradine, L-NAME + captopril (100 mg/kg/24 h), L-NAME + melatonin (10 mg/kg/24 h). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured by tail-cuff method once a week. The behaviour of rats was investigated during 23-hours in the phenotyper after four weeks of the treatment. Chronic administration of L-NAME induced hypertension without a change in HR. All tested substances partly prevented the increase of SBP, while ivabradine and melatonin also reduced HR. Ivabradine, captopril and melatonin reduced daily food intake, slightly decreased daily water intake and attenuated body weight gain. In L-NAME group, locomotor activity was enhanced by ivabradine, whereas exploratory behaviour was increased by melatonin and captopril. In conclusion, ivabradine, besides its potentially protective hemodynamic actions, does not seem to exert any disturbing effects on behaviour in L-NAME-induced hypertension in rats, while some of its effects were similar to captopril or melatonin. It is suggested that ivabradine used in cardiovascular indications is harmless regarding the effect on behaviour.", 
    "3": "We previously reported that exogenous angiotensin (Ang) 1-7 has adverse cardiac effects in experimental kidney failure due to its action to increase cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity. This study investigated if the addition of an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) to Ang 1-7 infusion would unmask any beneficial effects of Ang 1-7 on the heart in experimental kidney failure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent subtotal nephrectomy (STNx) and were treated with vehicle, the ACEi ramipril (oral 1mg/kg/day), Ang 1-7 (subcutaneous 24 \u03bcg/kg/h) or dual therapy (all groups, n = 12). A control group (n = 10) of sham-operated rats were also studied. STNx led to hypertension, renal impairment, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and increased both left ventricular ACE2 activity and ACE binding. STNx was not associated with changes in plasma levels of ACE, ACE2 or angiotensin peptides. Ramipril reduced blood pressure, improved cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and inhibited cardiac ACE. Ang 1-7 infusion increased blood pressure, cardiac interstitial fibrosis and cardiac ACE binding compared to untreated STNx rats. Although in STNx rats, the addition of ACEi to Ang 1-7 prevented any deleterious cardiac effects of Ang 1-7, a limitation of the study is that the large increase in plasma Ang 1-7 with ramipril may have masked any effect of infused Ang 1-7.",

    "6": "A systematic literature search was conducted using three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL). Articles published in English from January 1995 to December 2015 were retrieved for analysis to identify peer-reviewed, observational studies assessing use of preventive medications in patients with LLE. Inclusion criteria were: patients with a LLE (less than or equal to two\u00a0years); prescribed/used preventive medications.", 
    "7": "Of the 15 studies meeting our eligibility criteria, six were from inpatient hospital settings, five in palliative care, three in nursing homes, and one in community settings. The most common life-limiting illnesses described in the studies were cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a06), cardiovascular diseases (n\u00a0=\u00a04), dementia and cognitive impairment (n\u00a0=\u00a02), and other life-limiting illnesses (n\u00a0=\u00a03). Lipid-lowering medications, especially the statins were frequently prescribed preventive medication followed by antiplatelets, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, anti-osteoporosis medications, and calcium channel blockers. Only four studies reported the instances of medication withdrawal.", 
    "8": "Patients continue to receive medications that are not prescribed as symptomatic treatment despite having a LLE. Very few rigorous studies have been conducted on minimizing preventive medications in patients with LLE, and expert opinion varies on medication optimization at the end of life. A consensus guideline that addresses this gap is of paramount importance.", 
    "9": "Dilated cardiomyopathy is defined by the presence of left ventricular dilatation and contractile dysfunction. Genetic mutations involving genes that encode cytoskeletal, sarcomere, and nuclear envelope proteins, among others, account for up to 35% of cases. Acquired causes include myocarditis and exposure to alcohol, drugs and toxins, and metabolic and endocrine disturbances. The most common presenting symptoms relate to congestive heart failure, but can also include circulatory collapse, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. Secondary neurohormonal changes contribute to reverse remodelling and ongoing myocyte damage. The prognosis is worst for individuals with the lowest ejection fractions or severe diastolic dysfunction. Treatment of chronic heart failure comprises medications that improve survival and reduce hospital admission-namely, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and \u03b2 blockers. Other interventions include enrolment in a multidisciplinary heart failure service, and device therapy for arrhythmia management and sudden death prevention. Patients who are refractory to medical therapy might benefit from mechanical circulatory support and heart transplantation. Treatment of preclinical disease and the potential role of stem-cell therapy are being investigated.",

    "11": "Using the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure Registry, we linked clinical data from 16\u00a0052 heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (ejection fraction \u226440%) patients with Medicare claims data. We divided ACEi/ARB-eligible patients into 4 categories based on admission and discharge ACEi/ARB use: continued (reference group), started, discontinued, or not started on therapy. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the association between ACEi/ARB category and outcomes. Most, 90.5%, were discharged on ACEi/ARB (59.6% continued and 30.9% newly started). Of those discharged without ACEi/ARB, 1.9% were discontinued, and 7.5% were eligible but not started. Thirty-day mortality was 3.5% for patients continued and 4.1% for patients started on ACEi/ARB. In contrast, 30-day mortality was 8.8% for patients discontinued (adjusted hazard ratio [HRadj] 1.92; 95% CI 1.32-2.81; P<0.001) and 7.5% for patients not started (HRadj 1.50; 95% CI 1.12-2.00; P=0.006). The 30-day readmission rate was lowest among patients continued or started on therapy. One-year mortality was 28.2% for patients continued and 29.7% for patients started on ACEi/ARB compared to 41.6% for patients discontinued (HRadj 1.35; 95% CI 1.13-1.61; P<0.001) and 41.7% (HRadj 1.28; 95% CI 1.14-1.43; P<0.001) for patients not started on therapy.",

    "13": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a key role in regulating blood pressure in the body by converting the angiotensin I (AI) into angiotensin II (AII). Angiotensin II is a potent vaso-active peptide that causes arterioles to constrict, resulting in increased blood pressure. A rapid and sensitive method for the identification of inhibitors of ACE was developed, and optimized employing HPLC-ESI-QqQ-MS. In this assay, angiotensin I substrate was converted into the product angiotensin II with the catalytic action of ACE. A calibration curve for depleting concentration of angiotensin I was developed and linearity of R(2)=0.999 with a remarkably low concentration of substrate range 20-200nM. The limit of detection and quantification of angiotensin I was found to be 1.93 and 5.84nM, respectively. The enzymatic reaction was optimized for incubation time, concentration, and volume of enzyme and substrate. All reactions were performed at 37\u00b0C at pH7.5 with standard incubation time of 20min. Two standard inhibitors, Captopril and Lisinopril, were checked through the newly developed method for their inhibitory potential, and their IC50 values were found to be 3.969 and 0.852\u03bcM, respectively. Reproducibility and precision analysis of different experiments showed <9.9% RSD. The developed method can be used for the identification of new ACE inhibitors.", 
    "14": "Controversy exists about breast cancer risk associated with long-term use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), respectively. Our objective in this study was to separately evaluate associations between duration of CCB or ACEi use and breast cancer in hypertensive women aged \u226555 years at 3 sites in the Kaiser Permanente health-care system (1997\u20132012). Exposures included CCB or ACEi use of 1\u201312 years\u2019 duration, determined from pharmacy dispensings. Outcomes included invasive lobular or ductal carcinoma. Statistical methods included discrete-time survival analyses. The cohort included 19,674 (17.9%) CCB users and 90,078 (82.1%) ACEi users. Two percent (n = 397) of CCB users and 1.9% (n = 1,733) of ACEi users developed breast cancer. Compared with 1\u2013<2 years of use, in adjusted analysis, there was no association between CCB use for 2\u2013<12 years and breast cancer: All 95% confidence intervals included 1. Increasing duration of ACEi use was associated with reduced breast cancer risk: Compared with 1\u2013<2 years of use, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 0.63, 0.92) for 5\u2013<6 years of use and 0.63 (95% confidence interval: 0.43, 0.93) for 9\u2013<10 years of use. We conclude that among older women with hypertension, long-term CCB use does not increase breast cancer risk and long-term treatment with ACEis may confer protection against breast cancer.",

After treatment for at least 12\u00a0months, ACEI/ARBs were associated with a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (weighed mean differences [WMD] -5.76\u00a0mL/min; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: -9.31 to -2.20) and a decrease in hemoglobin (WMD -9.81\u00a0g/L; 95% CI: -14.98 to -4.64). There were no significant differences in mortality between ACEI/ARB and non-ACEI/ARB groups (risk ratio [RR] 0.98, 95% CI: 0.58 to 1.76), nor in graft failure (RR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.38 to 1.32).
