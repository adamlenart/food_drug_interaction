    "0": "Whey based peptides are well known for their nutritional and multifunctional properties. In this context, whey proteins from buffalo colostrum & milk were digested by in vitro simulation digestion and analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS. Functional protein association networks, gene annotations and localization of identified proteins were carried out. An ACE inhibitory peptide sorted from the library was custom synthesized and an in vitro ACE assay was performed. The study led to the identification of 74 small peptides which were clustered into 5 gene functional groups and majority of them were secretory proteins. Among the identified peptides, majority of them were found identical to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antioxidant, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and opioidal peptides. An octapeptide (m/z - 902.51, IQKVAGTW) synthesized was found to inhibit ACE with an IC50 of 300\u00b12\u00b5M. The present investigation thus establishes newer vista for food derived peptides having ACE inhibitory potential for nutraceutical or therapeutic applications.", 
    "1": "Bioactive peptides from food proteins exert beneficial effects on human health, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and antihypertensive activity. Several studies have reported that ACE-inhibitory peptides can come from animal products, marine organisms, and plants-derived by hydrolyzing enzymes such as pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin-and microbial enzymes such as alcalase, thermolysin, flavourzyme, and proteinase K. Different ACE-inhibitory effects are closely related with different peptide sequences and molecular weights. Sequences of ACE-inhibitory peptides are composed of hydrophobic (proline) and aliphatic amino acids (isoleucine and leucine) at the N-terminus. As result of this review, we assume that low molecular weight peptides have a greater ACE inhibition because lower molecular weight peptides have a higher absorbency in the body. Therefore, the ACE-inhibitory effect is closely related with the degree of enzymatic hydrolysis and the composition of the peptide sequence.", 
    "2": "We determined whether stroke and/or TIA subjects have exercise-induced blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses (QIPAVA ) and/or patent foramen ovale (QPFO ) and a genetic predisposition for ischemic stroke.", 
    "3": "Twenty-eight stroke and/or TIA subjects (33-63\u00a0years old) underwent transthoracic saline contrast echocardiography concomitant with transcranial Doppler to detect QIPAVA and QPFO at rest and during supine exercise with and without breathing 100% O2 . We also examined genetic polymorphisms in FV Leiden (G1691A; rs6025), factor II (FII) prothrombin (G20210A; rs1799963), methylene tetrahydfropholate reductase (C677T, rs1801133), and plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (4G/5G; rs1799889) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; I/D, rs4646994) in 24/28 subjects.", 
    "4": "No subject without PFO had QIPAVA at rest (n=17), but 12/17 did with exercise. All PFO subjects had QPFO at rest (n=11) and 7/11 had either QIPAVA or QPFO with exercise. Breathing 100% O2 during exercise reduced or eliminated left heart contrast in all subjects. Gene analyses revealed that 15/24 patients were either heterozygous or homozygous for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene polymorphism; 4G/4G and 4G/5G genotypes of plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 were present in 7/24 and 13/24 patients, respectively; polymorphisms of ACE D/D genotype were present in 6/24 and I/D in 14/24 patients. Having both I/D and 4G/4G genotypes was more prevalent in PFO+ subjects (P=.03), and there was a trend (P=.06) for PFO- subjects to have a greater D/D genotype prevalence.", 
    "5": "Novel genetic predispositions reported here in PFO subjects should be investigated further in larger stroke and/or TIA patient datasets.", 
    "6": "Heart rate variability (HRV) has been linked to mortality in maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients, but it is less clear whether HRV is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and hospitalization.", 
    "7": "This study enrolled 179 maintenance HD patients. HRV was measured to assess its prognostic significance in relation to MACEs and hospitalization.", 
    "8": "During the follow-up period of 33.3 \u00b1 6.7 months, 36 (20.1%) patients had a MACE, and 98 (54.7%) experienced hospitalization. In multivariate adjusted Cox regression analysis, low very low frequency (VLF) power (hazard ratio [HR], 0.727; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.624-0.848; p < 0.001), a history of coronary artery disease, high ultrafiltration rate, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, and the use of beta-blockers were all significantly associated with MACEs. Low VLF power (HR, 0.873; 95% CI, 0.785-0.971; p = 0.012), low serum albumin, low serum creatinine, low Kt/V levels, and high serum calcium-phosphorus product levels significantly predicted hospitalization in maintenance HD patients.", 
    "9": "Reduced VLF power is linked to an increased risk of MACEs and hospitalization in maintenance HD patients. Assessing cardiac autonomic function through HRV is of pivotal prognostic significance for this patient population.", 
    "10": "Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) and Leu-Lys-Pro (LKP) are food-derived antihypertensive peptides which inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and may have potential to attenuate hypertension. There is debate over their mechanism of uptake across small intestinal epithelia, but paracellular and PepT1 carrier-mediated uptake are thought to be important routes. The aim of this study was to determine their routes of intestinal permeability using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo intestinal models. The presence of an apical side pH of 6.5 (mimicking the intestinal acidic microclimate) and of Gly-Sar (a high affinity competitive inhibitor and substrate for PepT1) were tested on the transepithelial apical to basolateral (A to B) transport of [(3)H]-IPP and [(3)H]-LKP across filter-grown Caco-2 monolayers in vitro and rat jejunal mucosae ex vivo. A buffer pH of 6.5 on the apical side enabled Gly-Sar to reduce the apparent permeability (Papp) of [(3)H]-IPP and [(3)H]-LKP, but this inhibition was not evident at an apical buffer pH of 7.4. Gly-Sar reduced the Papp across isolated jejunal mucosae and the area under the curve (AUC) in intra-jejunal instillations when the apical/luminal buffer pH was either 7.4 or 6.5. However, the jejunal surface acidic pH was maintained in rat jejunal tissue even when the apical side buffer pH was 7.4 due to the presence of the microclimate which is not present in monolayers. PepT1 expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence on monolayers and brush border of rat jejunal tissue. This data suggest that IPP and LKP are highly permeable and cross small intestinal epithelia in part by the PepT1 transporter, with an additional contribution from the paracellular route.", 
    "11": "Human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) targeted therapies have survival benefit in adjuvant and metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer but are associated with cardiac dysfunction. Current U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommendations limit the use of HER2 targeted agents to patients with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function.", 
    "12": "The objective of the SAFE-HEaRt study is to evaluate the cardiac safety of HER2 targeted therapy in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with optimized cardiac therapy. Thirty patients with histologically confirmed HER2 positive breast cancer (stage I-IV) and reduced LVEF (40% to 49%) who plan to receive HER2 targeted therapy for \u22653 months will be enrolled. Prior to initiation on study, optimization of heart function with beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors will be initiated. Patients will be followed by serial echocardiograms and cardiac visits during and 6 months after completion of HER2 targeted therapy. Myocardial strain and blood biomarkers, including cardiac troponin I and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, will be examined at baseline and during the study.", 
    "13": "LV dysfunction in patients with breast cancer poses cardiac and oncological challenges and limits the use of HER2 targeted therapies and its oncological benefits. Strategies to prevent cardiac dysfunction associated with HER2 targeted therapy have been limited to patients with normal LVEF, thus excluding patients who may receive the highest benefit from those strategies. SAFE-HEaRt is the first prospective pilot study of HER2 targeted therapies in patients with reduced LV function while on optimized cardiac treatment that can provide the basis for clinical practice changes. The Oncologist 2017;22:518-525 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) targeted therapies have survival benefit in adjuvant and metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer but are associated with cardiac dysfunction. To our knowledge, SAFE-HEaRt is the first clinical trial that prospectively tests the hypothesis that HER2 targeted therapies may be safely administered in patients with mildly reduced cardiac function in the setting of ongoing cardiac treatment and monitoring. The results of this study will provide cardiac safety data and inform consideration of clinical practice changes in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and reduced cardiac function, as well as provide information regarding cardiovascular monitoring and treatment in this population.", 
    "14": "A 50-year-old male UK resident with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia presented to the emergency department with a 48-hour history of sudden onset bilateral thigh swelling and pain unrelieved by regular analgesia. 3\u2005days prior to presentation, he performed a vigorous workout in the gym. His medications included ramipril 5\u2005mg once daily and atorvastatin 20\u2005mg at night time. He was a non-smoker and did not consume alcohol. He reported no known drug allergies. Physical examination confirmed bilateral swollen thighs, with no overlying skin changes, clinically suggestive of compartment syndrome. His creatine kinase was >50\u2005000\u2005IU with normal renal and liver function tests. Further investigation with MRI-identified prominent swelling of the vastus intermedius and medialis muscles, more marked on the left, with extensive diffuse short tau inversion recovery (STIR) signal hyperintensity and isointensity on T1 sequences, suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. He underwent bilateral fasciotomies of his thighs and aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation with close monitoring of his electrolytes. Intraoperatively his muscle was healthy, with no evidence of haematoma or necrosis. His medication atorvastatin was stopped due to his rhabdomyolysis. 48\u2005hours later, he returned to theatre and review of his fasciotomy wounds was unremarkable. 4\u2005days later, he was discharged uneventfully. His postoperative recovery was complicated by a serous discharge from his left medial thigh wound. Further investigation with an ultrasound confirmed a 4\u00d71\u00d71cm multiloculated collection within the superficial tissue directly underlying the wound. An aspirate was performed and cultures revealed no growth. He remains under review in the department of plastic surgery. This case report discusses the aetiological spectrum, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, investigations, management and complications of rhabdomyolysis.", 
    "15": "Acute myocardial infarction is a major cause of hospitalization and death in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, temporal trends in the management and clinical outcomes of these patients remain unclear.", 
    "16": "We conducted an observational study by using a representative sample of 1\u00a0million beneficiaries from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Comorbidities, in-hospital treatment, and outcomes were compared for patients with acute myocardial infarction with and without COPD between 2004 and 2013. Temporal trends in treatment and outcomes were analyzed. We included 6770 patients admitted to hospitals with acute myocardial infarction diagnoses, of whom 1921 (28.3%) had COPD. Fewer patients with COPD received \u03b2-blockers (adjusted odds ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.59-0.74), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (adjusted odds ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.93), statins, anticoagulants, dual antiplatelets, and coronary interventions. These patients had higher mortality (in hospital: adjusted hazard ratio 1.25 [95% CI 1.11-1.41]; 1 year: adjusted hazard ratio 1.20 [95% CI 1.09-1.32]) and respiratory failure risk during admission. Temporal trends showed little improvement in mortality in patients with COPD over 10\u00a0years. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that dual antiplatelets, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, statins, coronary angiography, and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery were significantly correlated with improved mortality in patients with COPD.", 
    "17": "In Taiwan, a lower proportion of patients with COPD received evidence-based therapies for acute myocardial infarction than did patients without COPD, and their clinical outcomes were inferior. Limited improvement in mortality was observed over the preceding 10\u00a0years and is attributable to the underuse of evidence-based treatments.", 
    "18": "The goal of this study was to determine if left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) predicts heart failure (HF) readmission in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.", 
    "19": "Two hundred ninety one patients were enrolled at the time of admission for acute decompensated heart failure between January 2011 and September 2013. Left ventricle global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) by velocity vector imaging averaged from 2, 3 and 4-chamber views could be assessed in 204 out of 291 (70%) patients. Mean age was 63.8\u2009\u00b1\u200915.2\u00a0years, 42% of the patients were males and 78% were African American or Hispanic. Patients were followed until the first HF hospital readmission up to 44\u00a0months. Patients were grouped into quartiles on the basis of LV GLS. Kaplan-Meier curves showed significantly higher readmission rates in patients with worse LV GLS (log-rank p\u2009<\u20090.001). After adjusting for age, sex, history of ischemic heart disease, dementia, New York Heart Association class, LV ejection fraction, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, systolic and diastolic blood pressure on admission and sodium level on admission, worse LV GLS was the strongest predictor of recurrent HF readmission (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The ejection fraction was predictive of readmission in univariate, but not in multivariate analysis.", 
    "20": "LV GLS is an independent predictor of HF readmission after acute decompensated heart failure with a higher risk of readmission in case of progressive worsening of LV GLS, independent of the ejection fraction.", 
    "21": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the second leading cause (16.4%) of end-stage renal disease in China. The current study assessed the cost-effectiveness of preventing DKD in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes from the Chinese healthcare perspective.", 
    "22": "A lifetime Markov decision model was developed according to the disease course of DKD. Patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes might receive treatment according to one of the following three strategies: (i) \"do nothing\" strategy (control strategy); (ii) treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (universal strategy); (iii) or screening for microalbuminuria followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment (screening strategy). Clinical and utility data were obtained from the published literature. Direct medical costs and resource utilization in the Chinese healthcare setting were considered. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to test the impact of a range of variables and assumptions on the results.", 
    "23": "Compared with the control strategy, both the screening and universal strategies were cost-saving options that showed lower costs and better health benefits. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the universal strategy over the screening strategy was US $30,087 per quality-adjusted life-year, which was higher than the cost-effectiveness threshold of China. The sensitivity analyses showed robust results, except for the probability of developing macroalbuminuria from microalbuminuria.", 
    "24": "Screening for microalbuminuria could be a cost-saving option for the prevention of DKD in the Chinese setting.", 
    "25": "The prevalence of diabetic nephropathy continues to rise and it remains a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Patients diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy are actively excluded from most trials involving diabetic medications and it is important to understand the prescription patterns in this subset of patients with diabetes.", 
    "26": "Using the IMS Health's National Disease and Therapeutic Index, we analysed the medication prescription patterns for six classes of medications from 2010 to 2014 among patients, 35 years or older, with diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "27": "Annual office visits increased from 772 860 (95% confidence interval (CI), 755, 470-790, 249) in 2010 to 1 868 618 (95% CI, 1 834 422-1 902 814) in 2013 and declined to 830 596 (95% CI, 809 167-852 025) in 2014. Sulfonylureas and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 inhibitors) were the most frequently used of the four classes of diabetic medications included in this study. DPP-4 inhibitors use increased gradually and was used in 54% (95% CI 49-58) of treatment visits by the last quarter of 2014. Across these years, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs and ARBs) were prescribed in the majority of treatment visits with peaks above 90%. However, there were some periods when utilization of these antihypertensives was low.", 
    "28": "Significant increases occurred in the uptake of new diabetic medications; DPP-4 inhibitors and SGLT-2 inhibitors and in the utilization of ACEIs and ARBs compared to the findings reported in other studies with increased complexity in the treatment of patients with diabetic nephropathy. Improved and continued used of these medications may be beneficial in improving patient outcomes."
