However, currently used RAAS inhibitors still cannot achieve their desired effects and are associated with certain drawbacks, such as adverse side effects, incomplete blockage of the system and poor end-organ protection. In this review, we discuss the efficiency and specificity of the current RAAS inhibitors and propose some recommendations for achieving better treatments with better end-organ protection.Hypertension Research advance online publication, 6 July 2017; doi:10.1038/hr.2017.65.', 4: 'The beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists in patients with heart failure secondary to reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are felt to result from prevention of the adverse effects of AII on systemic afterload and renal homeostasis. However, AII can activate the sympathetic nervous system and part of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and AII antagonists may result from their ability to inhibit such activation. We examined the acute effects of the ACE inhibitor captopril (25 mg, n = 9) and the AII receptor antagonist losartan (50 mg, n = 10) on hemodynamics as well as total body and cardiac norepinephrine spillover in patients with chronic HFrEF. Hemodynamic and neurochemical measurements were made at baseline and at 1, 2 and 4 hours after oral dosing. Administration of both drugs caused significant reductions in systemic arterial, cardiac filling and pulmonary artery pressures (P < 0.05 vs baseline). There was no significant difference in the magnitude of those hemodynamic effects. Plasma concentrations of AII were significantly decreased by captopril and increased by losartan (P < 0.05 vs baseline for both). Total body sympathetic activity increased in response to both captopril and losartan (P < 0.05 vs baseline for both), however there was no change in cardiac sympathetic activity in response to either drug. The results of the current study do not support the hypothesis that the acute inhibition of the renin angiotensin system has sympathoinhibitory effects in patients with chronic HFrEF.', 5: 'The risk of sudden death has changed over time among patients with symptomatic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction with the sequential introduction of medications including angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists. We sought to examine this trend in detail.', 6: 'We analyzed data from 40,195 patients who had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and were enrolled in any of 12 clinical trials spanning the period from 1995 through 2014. Patients who had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator at the time of trial enrollment were excluded. Weighted multivariable regression was used to examine trends in rates of sudden death over time. Adjusted hazard ratios for sudden death in each trial group were calculated with the use of Cox regression models. The cumulative incidence rates of sudden death were assessed at different time points after randomization and according to the length of time between the diagnosis of heart failure and randomization.', 7: 'Sudden death was reported in 3583 patients. Such patients were older and were more often male, with an ischemic cause of heart failure and worse cardiac function, than those in whom sudden death did not occur. There was a 44% decline in the rate of sudden death across the trials (P=0.03). The cumulative incidence of sudden death at 90 days after randomization was 2.4% in the earliest trial and 1.0% in the most recent trial. The rate of sudden death was not higher among patients with a recent diagnosis of heart failure than among those with a longer-standing diagnosis.', 8: 'Rates of sudden death declined substantially over time among ambulatory patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who were enrolled in clinical trials, a finding that is consistent with a cumulative benefit of evidence-based medications on this cause of death. (Funded by the China Scholarship Council and the University of Glasgow.).', 9: 'Patients with an alcohol use disorder experiencing acute intoxication or withdrawal may be at risk for electrocardiograph (ECG) abnormalities, including prolongation of repolarization (long QTc [corrected QT]) that may contribute to arrhythmias and may be associated with a threefold increase in the likelihood of sudden cardiac events. Patients with acute coronary syndrome may have prolonged QTc as well. To our knowledge, no previous studies have compared the QTc of ACS with acute ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal syndromes in the emergency department (ED). The purpose of our study was to compare the QTc of those with EtOH withdrawal emergencies with patients with ACS in our ED. Our hypothesis was that the QTc would be similarly prolonged in the two cohorts.', 10: u'The study compared two cohort groups, those with ACS and those with EtOH withdrawal-related ED visits over a 1-year period. We compared ECG QTc, cardiac medication use, and electrolyte differences. We considered a QTc of >450 ms elevated for men and >470 ms elevated for women based on the literature. Fifty subjects in whom an ECG, serum osmolality, and EtOH level were recorded within 2 hours of one another and who were administered a Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment protocol were compared with 203 patients with ACS during the same period. We excluded patients with incomplete data. Medications compared included clopidogrel, acetylsalicylic acid, \\u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins. ECG QT and QTc, as well as electrolytes, were recorded and compared. Data were extracted by two investigators with a 20% sample re-evaluated by the other extractor as a reliability measure. Descriptive statistics including medians and interquartile ranges were measured for continuous variables. Comparisons were made using two-tailed t tests for parametric data and the Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric data.', 11: u'Agreement in the 20% sampling between investigators was high (96%). The mean QTc in the ACS group was 457 ms and the mean QTc in the EtOH withdrawal-related group was 468 ms (diff 11, not significant). Significantly more patients had a prolonged QTc in the EtOH withdrawal group than in the ACS group 62% vs 46%; diff 16; 95% CI (0.1, 30). There was significantly more use of clopidogrel, acetylsalicylic acid, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins (P < 0.05 for all) in the ACS group compared with the EtOH withdrawal group; however, there was no difference in \\u03b2-blocker usage. There was a significantly higher admission rate: 100% of ACS compared with 76% of the EtOH withdrawal group (P < 0.01, diff 24, 95% confidence interval 18-29). Electrolytes were not significantly different in the two groups.', 12: 'More patients with EtOH withdrawal-related ED visits had a long QTc than patients presenting with ACS. ED physicians should carefully monitor patients experiencing EtOH withdrawal for cardiac arrhythmias and obtain an ECG. If any medications that prolong the QTc are considered, then an ECG should be obtained before administering medications that may affect the myocardium to make medication safer for the patient.', 13: 'Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) makes up half of diagnosed heart failure cases and has similar outcomes compared to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) but a discrepancy in knowledge and approach to treatment. HFpEF is diagnosed using the following criteria: symptoms, preserved ejection fraction (greater than 50%), and evidence of abnormal left ventricular filling or relaxation, or diastolic distensibility or stiffness. Studies conducted to examine the efficacy of angiotensin receptor blockers (irbesartan and candesartan), thiazide diuretics (chlorthalidone), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (perindopril) in the treatment of HFpEF, showed moderate efficacy but no clear benefit. Recently, the FDA has approved a novel drug, which combines an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (valsartan) named LCZ696 (entresto) for possible treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In this article, we will discuss the failure of previous treatment modalities and the promise that LCZ696 (entresto) may hold for treating patients with HFpEF.', 14: 'Several medications have been used perioperatively in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery in an attempt to improve outcomes. Antiplatelet therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular events should generally be discontinued seven to 10 days before surgery to avoid increasing the risk of bleeding, unless the risk of a major adverse cardiac event exceeds the risk of bleeding. Antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention should be continued perioperatively, except before procedures with very high bleeding risk, such as intracranial procedures. Antiplatelet drugs should be continued and surgery delayed, if possible, for at least 14 days after percutaneous coronary intervention without stent placement, 30 days after percutaneous coronary intervention with bare-metal stent placement, and six to 12 months after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent placement. Perioperative beta blockers are recommended for patients already receiving these agents, and it is reasonable to consider starting therapy in patients with known or strongly suspected coronary artery disease or who are at high risk of perioperative cardiac events and are undergoing procedures with a high risk of cardiovascular complications. Long-term statin therapy should be continued perioperatively or started in patients with clinical indications who are not already receiving statins. Clonidine should not be started perioperatively, but long-term clonidine regimens may be continued. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers generally can be continued perioperatively if patients are hemodynamically stable and have good renal function and normal electrolyte levels.', 15: 'There has been a dearth of comprehensive data on the profile of adverse reactions to antihypertensive medicines in the Nigerian setting despite increased use.', 16: 'This study was aimed to characterize the adverse reactions experienced in the homogenously black African population.', 17: u\"The study was carried out at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria, in consenting eligible hypertensive patients \\u226518 years. Adverse reactions were sought using patient's self-report and a medicine-induced symptom checklist.\", 18: u'A total of 514 patients (340 females) aged 22-97 years were studied. Thirteen percent, 27.6%, 26.7%, 22.0%, and 10.7% were on 1, 2, 3, 4, and \\u22655 medicines, respectively, for control of their blood pressure with the frequency of adverse effects increasing proportionately up to four medicines. Adverse reactions to antihypertensive medicines were reported by a total of 93 (18.1%) patients. Diuretics - 27.9%, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) - 26.8%, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) - 26.8% accounted for most of the adverse reactions seen, notably frequent micturition and headaches (CCB); excessive micturition and dizziness (diuretics); dry irritating cough (ACEI). Notable complaints for all patients using the checklist were increased frequency of micturition, reduction in libido, and headaches. The reactions resulted in the discontinuation and substitution of therapy in 49.5% of the patients.', 19: 'The characterization of these reactions in Nigerians requires further studies as frequent micturition reported is still a neglected complaint in antihypertensive therapy.'}\n"
