      "renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) antagonists, including ACEI, angiotensin receptor blockers (arb), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (mra) decrease mortality and morbidity in heart failure but increase the risk of hyperkalemia, especially when used in combination. prevention of hyperkalemia and its associated complications requires careful patient selection, counseling regarding dietary potassium intake, awareness of drug interactions, and regular laboratory surveillance. recent data suggests that the risk of hyperkalemia may be further moderated through the use of combined angiotensin-neprilysin inhibitors, novel mras, and novel potassium binding agents. clinicians should be mindful of the risk of hyperkalemia when prescribing raas inhibitors to patients with heart failure. in patients at highest risk, such as those with diabetes, the elderly, and advanced chronic kidney disease, more intensive laboratory surveillance of potassium and creatinine may be required. novel therapies hold promise for reducing the risk of hyperkalemia and enhancing the tolerability of raas antagonists.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "heart failure is a disease with a high prevalence and incidence. new therapeutic approaches are needed to prevent the onset of heart failure and to reduce the high morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. an optimized therapy of arterial hypertension in patients with risk factors and the use of the sglt2 inhibitor empagliflozin in type 2 diabetics are proven strategies to prevent heart failure. the therapeutic options in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are still insufficient. in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction sacubitril/valsartan, the first approved angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, is superior to an ACEI (ACEI) inhibitor. whether digitalis affects the prognosis in heart failure remains unclear; however, serum concentration should be targeted at the lower therapeutic range. iron supplementation in heart failure with reduced systolic function and iron deficiency improves symptoms and quality of life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "participants (n=418) underwent one of the following 3 conditions: i) multicomponent exercise training 3times/week (mex; n=116); ii) ACEI used mono-dose daily (ACEI; n=70); iii) combined exercise and ACEI drugs (aceimex; n=232). the trial was completed by 82% of the participants (n=342): mex (n=90); ACEI (n=66); aceimex (n=186). baseline and 2-year follow-up evaluations included the senior fitness test battery, short form health survey 36 (sf-36), the health history questionnaires, anthropometric and hemodynamic profile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "heart failure (hf) prevalence continues to rise and remains a significant burden to patients, caregivers, providers, and the healthcare system. guideline-directed medical therapy with standard neurohormonal blockade has been the cornerstone of medical management for many years. despite aggressive utilization of ACEI, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, hf hospitalizations and readmissions are common and residual mortality remains high. with the development of two novel medical therapies (sacubitril/valsartan and ivabradine), the american college of cardiology, american heart association, and heart failure society of america released a pharmacologic update to provide guidelines for incorporation of these agents into clinical practice. although effective via different mechanisms of action, both agents now have a prominent role in risk reduction. hf medical regimens often become quite complex, especially when associated with comorbid conditions, and require frequent follow-up. providers must be proficient in patient monitoring, medication dose titration, and therapy optimization. individualized patient care strategies such as guideline-directed therapy can promote long-term adherence and quality of life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "we included a group with no dd (n=649), a group with grade 1 dd (n=2875), and those with grades 2 and 3 (n=1357) who had normal ejection fraction. the prevalence of grade 2 or 3 dd with preserved ejection fraction was 25%; 95% ci: 24-26. the absolute change of ACEI-inhibitor use before and after the echocardiogram increased by 14, 19, 23, 27 in patients without dd, those with grade 1, grade 2 or 3 asymptomatic and grade 2 or 3 symptomatic, respectively. the use of β-blocker, statin, and diuretic had similar trends.\r\n",

      "A number of experimental and clinical investigations support the notion that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) compounds attenuate renal fibrosis. Fibrosis can be attenuated by either suppressing matrix formation or facilitating matrix degradation. In this study, drugs of ACEi and ARB classes were tested for their ability to facilitate matrix degradation in the kidney. A murine model system in which cyclosporin A (CsA) treatment for a specified period caused interstitial matrix deposition in the kidney was used. CsA was then discontinued, and experimental procedures were initiated to investigate matrix degradation. Benazepril, an ACEi, facilitated matrix degradation via the bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor on tubular epithelial cells in the kidney, whereas CGP-48933, an ARB, did not. In this murine model of CsA nephropathy under ACE blockade, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression was decreased in tubular epithelial cells, possibly leading to conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by plasminogen activator and subsequent activation of matrix metalloproteinases. These findings were confirmed in this study by measurements of plasmin activity, collagenolytic activity, and matrix metalloproteinase activities in the kidneys. In tubular epithelial cells stimulated in vitro, BK suppressed PAI-1 gene expression. All of these results suggest that ACEi can decrease PAI-1 expression via BK, thereby facilitating matrix degradation via activation of degradative enzymes to reduce interstitial matrix deposition.\r\n",

      "Plasmin is an important factor in the degradation of extracellular matrix. In the study reported here we examined the expression of plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and uPA receptor (uPAR), as well as the relevance of such expression to the production of type IV collagen, a major component of extracellular matrix, in the renal tissue of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Because angiotensin II is involved in the synthesis of PAI-1 and uPA, we also examined the effect of benazepril, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, on the expression of PAI-1, uPA, and uPAR messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and type IV collagen protein. Rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes-some untreated and some treated with 30 mg/L benazepril-and nondiabetic control rats were sacrificed at 4, 12, or 24 weeks after induction of diabetes. We examined the expression of PAI-1, uPA, and uPAR mRNAs through the use of in situ hybridization and that of type IV collagen by means of immunohistochemical methods. In control rats, we detected weak signals for PAI-1, uPA, and uPAR mRNAs in glomeruli. Diabetic rats exhibited high levels of expression of PAI-1, uPA, and uPAR mRNAs and type IV collagen protein, mainly in mesangial cells. These mRNAs were synthesized in various renal cells (epithelial, mesangial, and endothelial cells and Bowman's capsule). Benazepril inhibited increases in all 3 mRNAs, especially in the mesangium; reduced type IV collagen expression; and attenuated mesangial expansion. Our results indicated that altered expression of PAI-1, uPA, and uPAR in diabetic nephropathy was associated with mesangial expansion and that the beneficial effects of ACE-I may be at least associated with such expression.\r\n",

      "The effects of the combined use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) benazepril and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (AT1RA) valsartan on apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins Fas and FasL in the kidney of rats with adriamycin-induced nephritic glomerulosclerosis was investigated. Uninephrectomy and the injection of adriamycin induced the rat model of glomerulosclerosis. Benazepril (6 mg/kg), valsantan (20 mg/kg), or benazepril (3 mg/kg) plus valsantan (20 mg/kg) was respectively delivered daily by gavage to the rats in three treatment groups for 12 weeks. Apoptosis was examined by means of terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated d-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Immunohistochemistry was adopted to detect the expression of Fas and FasL. Software of pathological analysis quantitated the levels of Fas and FasL. The results showed that as compared with those in the control group, the kidneys in the model group had more severe glomerulosclerosis, much more apoptotic cells and higher levels of expression of Fas and FasL. The degree of glomerulosclerosis, the number of apoptotic cells and the levels of expression of Fas and FasL were reduced by benazepril and valsartan. The combined use of benazepril and valsartan had the best therapeutic effect. It was concluded that benazepril and valsartan could suppress the excessive apoptosis of kidney cells by lowering the expression of the apoptosis-related proteins Fas and FasL, so as to postpone the process of glomerulosclerosis. The combined use of benazepril and valsartan has better therapeutic effect.\r\n",

      "The disposition and effect of benazepril and its active metabolite, benazeprilat, were evaluated in cats using a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model. Cats received single 1 mg/kg doses of intravenous 14C-benazeprilat and oral 14C-benazepril.HCl, and single and repeat (eight daily) oral administrations of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg nonlabelled benazepril.HCl. The pharmacokinetic endpoints were plasma concentrations of benazepril and benazeprilat, and recovery of radioactivity in faeces and urine. The pharmacodynamic endpoint was plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. Benazeprilat data were fitted to an equation corresponding to a single-compartment model with a volume equal to the blood space (Vc = 0.093 L/kg). Within this space, benazeprilat was bound nonlinearly to ACE, which was mainly tissular (89.4%) rather than circulating (10.6%). Free benazeprilat was eliminated quickly from the central compartment (t1/2 approximately 1.0 h; Cl approximately 0.125 L/kg/h), elimination being principally biliary ( approximately 85%) rather than urinary ( approximately 15%). Nevertheless, inhibition of ACE was long-lasting (t1/2 16-23 h) due to high affinity binding of benazeprilat to ACE (Kd approximately 3.5 mmol/L, IC50 approximately 4.3 mmol/L). Simulations using the model predict a lack of proportionality between dose of benazepril, plasma benazeprilat concentrations and effect due to the nonlinear binding of benazeprilat to ACE. For example, increasing the dose of benazepril (e.g. above 0.125 mg/kg q24 h) produced only small incremental inhibition of ACE (either peak effect or duration of action).\r\n",

      "Albuminuria and hypertension are predictors of poor renal and cardiovascular outcome in diabetic patients. This study tested whether dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with both an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACE-I) and an Angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) is superior to either drug alone in type I diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). A randomized double-blind crossover trial was performed with 8-wk treatment with placebo, 20 mg of benazepril once daily, 80 mg of valsartan once daily, and the combination of 20 mg of benazepril and 80 mg of valsartan. Twenty type I diabetic patients with DN were included. At the end of each treatment period, albuminuria, 24-h BP, and GFR were measured. Eighteen patients completed the study. Placebo values were: albuminuria [mean (95% CI)], 701 (490 to 1002) mg/24 h; BP [mean (SEM)], 144 (4)/79 (2) mmHg, and GFR [mean (SEM)], 82 (7) ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Treatment with benazepril, valsartan, or dual blockade significantly reduced albuminuria and BP compared with placebo. Benazepril and valsartan were equally effective. Dual blockade induced an additional reduction in albuminuria of 43 % (29 to 54 %) compared with any type of monotherapy, and a reduction in systolic BP of 6 (0 to 13) mmHg and 7 (1 to 14) mmHg (versus benazepril and valsartan, respectively) and a reduction of 7 (4 to 10) mmHg diastolic compared with both monotherapies. GFR was reversibly reduced on dual blockade compared with monotherapy and placebo. All treatments were safe and well tolerated.

      "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used in the management of essential hypertension, stable chronic heart failure, myocardial infarction (MI) and diabetic nephropathy. There is an increasing number of new agents to add to the nine ACE inhibitors (benazepril, cilazapril, delapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, pentopril, perindopril, quinapril and ramipril) reviewed in this journal in 1990. The pharmacokinetic properties of five newer ACE inhibitors (trandolapril, moexipril, spirapril, temocapril and imidapril) are reviewed in this update. All of these new agents are characterised by having a carboxyl functional groups and requiring hepatic activation to form pharmacologically active metabolites. They achieve peak plasma concentrations at similar times (t(max)) to those of established agents. Three of these agents (trandolapril, moexipril and imidapril) require dosage reductions in patients with renal impairment. Dosage reductions of moexipril and temocapril are recommended for elderly patients, and dosages of moexipril should be lower in patients who are hepatically impaired. Moexipril should be taken 1 hour before meals, whereas other ACE inhibitors can be taken without regard to meals. The pharmacokinetics of warfarin are not altered by concomitant administration with trandolapril or moexipril. Although imidapril and spirapril have no effect on digoxin pharmacokinetics, the area under the concentration-time curve of imidapril and the peak plasma concentration of the active metabolite imidaprilat are decreased when imidapril is given together with digoxin. Although six ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, quinapril and ramipril) have been approved for use in heart failure by the US Food and Drug Administration, an overview of 32 clinical trials of ACE inhibitors in heart failure showed that no significant heterogeneity in mortality was found among enalapril, ramipril, quinapril, captopril, lisinopril, benazepril, perindopril and cilazapril. Initiation of therapy with captopril, ramipril, and trandolapril at least 3 days after an acute MI resulted in all-cause mortality risk reductions of 18 to 27%. Captopril has been shown to have similar morbidity and mortality benefits to those of diuretics and beta-blockers in hypertensive patients. Captopril has been shown to delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy, and enalapril and lisinopril prevent the development of nephropathy in normoalbuminuric patients with diabetes. ACE inhibitors are generally characterised by flat dose-response curves. Lisinopril is the only ACE inhibitor that exhibits a linear dose-response curve. Despite the fact that most ACE inhibitors are recommended for once-daily administration, only fosinopril, ramipril, and trandolapril have trough-to-peak effect ratios in excess of 50%.\r\n",

Cutaneous side effects of captopril include angio-edema, anaphylactoid reactions, maculopapular eruptions, pitiryasis rosea-like rash, toxic erythema, and exfoliative dermatitis. Some of the immunological captopril-induced cutaneous adverse reactions have been diagnosed in recent years by patch tests. A case of a cutaneous immune adverse reaction to captopril with tolerance to enalapril and lisinopril demonstrated both by patch tests and double-blind challenge tests is reported for the first time. A 71-year-old nonatopic woman suffered a generalized pruriginous maculopapular rash. Two months earlier, she had started oral treatment with captopril 50 mg t.i.d and glibenclamide 5 mg daily. After the rash appeared, she stopped both drugs and the reaction cleared. A skin biopsy from one of the lesions showed perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate of the upper dermis. Skin prick tests with captopril and glibenclamide and patch tests with enalapril, lisinopril, and glibenclamide at 1% and 10% pet., and with mercaptobenzothiazole (a sulfhydryl group-containing chemical at 1% pet were negative. Only patch tests with captopril at 1% and 10% concentrations were positive at 48 h. Oral double-blind challenge tests with glibenclamide, enalapril, lisinopril, and placebo showed good tolerance. The patient was advised to avoid only captopril. Because captopril is the only ACE inhibitor containing a sulfhydryl group and has occasionally been implicated in complex immunological diseases, this chemical group has been considered the culprit of allergic reactions to captopril. The lack of cross-reactivity between captopril, enalapril, and benazepril has been demonstrated in a few patients by patch tests. In our patient, patch tests identified captopril as the drug responsible for a probably immune adverse reaction not due to the sulfhydryl group. Patch tests are useful and safe in the diagnostic work-up of allergic drug reactions and in studies of cross-sensitivity among ACE inhibitors.\r\n",

      "Combination therapy is required in many patients to achieve goal blood pressure (BP). Calcium antagonists are highly effective antihypertensive drugs in a broad range of demographic groups. Yet, higher doses are associated with an increased frequency of lower extremity edema. The purpose of our open label, single-center clinical trial was to evaluate the use of concomitant pharmacologic therapies to attenuate the lower extremity edema associated with dihydropyridine calcium antagonists therapy using a water displacement technique. Forty-seven patients received 5 mg/day of oral amlodipine for a period of 6 weeks after a 4-week wash-out off of all antihypertensive medications to establish baseline BP. They were then randomized to receive either an additional 5 mg of amlodipine, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), or 20 mg of benazepril for an additional 6 weeks. Blood pressure determinations and water displacement measurements were obtained at the end of the 4-week placebo wash-out period, after 6 weeks of 5 mg/day of oral amlodipine therapy, and after an additional 6 weeks of 5 mg of amlodipine and randomized drug therapy. Adjusted BP reductions (based on pretreatment BP) were -6.8/-3.8 mm Hg for the 10-mg amlodipine group, -9.9/-8.2 mm Hg for the amlodipine (5 mg)/HCTZ (25 mg) group, and -26.2/-16.4 mm Hg for the amlodipine (5 mg)/benazepril (20 mg) group (P < .0167, group 3 v group 1 diastolic BP, which was statistically significant by the improved Bonferroni method). Seventeen of the 47 patients developed at least a 10% increase in lower extremity edema water displacement in response to 5 mg/day of oral amlodipine therapy (36.2%). Adding 5 mg of amlodipine to a baseline of 5 mg of amlodipine resulted in no net change in lower extremity edema (+58.0 mL,+ 0.6% change, n=5). Adding 25 mg of HCTZ reduced lower extremity edema by a mean of 136.3 mL (-11.1% change, n=4). Benazepril reduced water displacement by 204.4 mL (-14.3% change, n=8). Our pilot study indicates that adding an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is the most effective way to not only reduce systolic and diastolic BP but also attenuate lower extremity edema. Due to the inherent daily variability of lower extremity edema, power calculations indicate many patients (n=702, 356 in each group) would be needed to compare the antiedema efficacy of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and the thiazide diuretic.\r\n",
