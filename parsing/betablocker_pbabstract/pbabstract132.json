The S- and R-propranolol side-chain glucuronides produced in the incubation mixtures were assayed simultaneously by RP-HPLC with fluorescent detector. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 310 nm and 339 nm, respectively. UGT1A9 prefers catalyzing S-enantiomer to R-enantiomer and the intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) ratios of S-enantiomer to R-enantiomer are 3.8 times and 6.5 times for racemic propranolol and individual enantiomers, respectively. UGT2B7, however, catalyzes slightly less S-enantiomer than R-enantiomer and the CL(int) ratio of S-enantiomer to R-enantiomer is 0.8 times. The high concentration of racemic propranolol (>0.57 mmol/l) and individual enantiomers (>0.69 mmol/l) exhibited substrate inhibition of glucuronidation for UGT2B7, but only the S-enantiomer (>0.44 mmol/l) in racemic propranolol exhibited substrate inhibition for UGT1A9. The substrate inhibition constants (K(si)) were all similar (P > 0.05). Drug-drug interactions were also found between S- and R-enantiomer glucuronidation metabolisms by UGT1A9 and UGT2B7.",

However, there is little available data to demonstrate whether this is generally the case. In the present study, a framework was developed to guide testing of transformation products using phototransformation of the beta-blocker propranolol to test the hypothesis for this particular transformation route. Phototransformation is an important depletion mechanism of some pharmaceuticals in surface waters with fast reaction rate constants at environmentally relevant conditions. Samples of propranolol in deionized water (DIW) and river water (RW) were exposed to a solar simulator (lambda: 295-800 nm) and comparative toxicity of propranolol and its degraded mixtures measured using algal (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and rotifer (Brachionus calyciflorus) screening tests. Results suggested a reduction of toxicity in photodegraded mixtures compared to the parent active pharmaceutical ingredient in all samples tested. Chemical analysis of effect test solutions supported the hypothesis that propranolol was transformed into compounds that appear to be less toxic to the organisms tested under the study conditions. Although the reactions were much faster in RW than in DIW, profiles of transformation products were similar in both matrices at two starting concentrations (1 and 10 mg/L). Results for propranolol implied that the reduction of toxicity using algal and rotifer screening tests was probably due to the production of more hydrophilic and more polar transformation products. Such results will provide useful insights into the environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals by taking into account their transformation products.",

Inhibition of contractile activity in the proximal and distal parts of thejejunum in the 1st phase of the stressor response manifested on the background of blockade of presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor with yohimbin, nonselective blockade of alpha-adrenoceptor with dihydroergotoxin, or blockade of beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptor with propranolol. Conclusion is made that the stressor inhibition of contractile activity in the proximal and distal parts of the jejunum was not \"adrenergic cholinergic\" or \"adrenergic\" in origin. The contractile activity inhibition of the jejunum was actualized with the contribution of \"nonadrenergic noncholinergic\" inhibitory mechanism and mediated via nonadrenergic inhibitory neurons of the enteric nervous system. Depression of the contractile activity in the proximal part of ileum being preserved after blockade of presynaptic \"alpha 2-adrenoceptor\" or blockade of beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptor, was not \"adrenergic cholinergic\" or \"beta-adrenergic\". Nonselective blockade of alpha-adrenoceptor resulted in diminished stressor inhibition of the contractile activity in the proximal part of ileum. The data obtained suggest that the stressor inhibition of the contractile activity in the proximal part of ileum was caused by \"nonadrenergic noncholinergic\" inhibitory mechanism with participation of the \"alpha-adrenergic\" inhibition. The \"nonadrenergic noncholinergic\" inhibition of the contractile activity in the jejunum and ileum might result from activation of enteric inhibitory neurons with a stressor factor of hormonal nature.",

In the case of hypertensive subjects with respiratory comorbidities, when first introduced, these beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists were described as affecting airway patency as a result of their antagonism against beta(2)-adrenergic receptors within airway muscles. New molecules with a better respiratory tolerability were subsequently designed in order to overcome the narrow therapeutic window of first-generation beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists. Nebivolol is a third-generation beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with high beta(1)-selective adrenergic receptor antagonism and vasodilating properties that induces a substantial decrease of arterial pressure in hypertensive subjects while preserving their left ventricular function. Respiratory effects of nebivolol have been investigated in animal models, in healthy volunteers and in clinical trials carried out on patients suffering from bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In contrast to older compounds, nebivolol, which modulates the endogenous production of nitric oxide and affects oxidative cascade, proved clinically well tolerated in terms of respiratory outcomes in this type of subject. Moreover, due to the substantial dissociation between its cardiac and pulmonary activity, nebivolol confirmed a very good safety profile when regularly administered to hypertensive subjects with obstructive respiratory comorbidities.",

Telmisartan is a unique angiotensin II receptor blocker with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma)-stimulating activity. Activation of PPAR-gamma is expected to prevent inflammation and Abeta accumulation in the brain. We investigated the possible preventive effect of telmisartan on cognitive decline in an Alzheimer disease mouse model via PPAR-gamma activation. Here, male ddY mice underwent ICV injection of Abeta 1-40. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Morris water maze test. A low dose of telmisartan (0.35 mg/kg per day) was administered in drinking water with or without GW9662, a PPAR-gamma antagonist. Cerebral blood flow was evaluated by laser speckle flowmetry. Inflammatory cytokine levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Abeta 1-40 ICV injection significantly impaired cognitive function. Pretreatment with telmisartan improved this cognitive decline to a similar level to that in control mice. Cotreatment with GW9662, a PPAR-gamma antagonist, attenuated this telmisartan-mediated improvement of cognition. Treatment with telmisartan enhanced cerebral blood flow and attenuated the Abeta-induced increase in expression of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and inducible NO synthase in the brain. Interestingly, coadministration of GW9662 cancelled these beneficial effects of telmisartan. Abeta 1-40 concentration in the brain was significantly decreased by treatment with telmisartan, whereas administration of GW9662 attenuated the decrease in telmisartan-mediated Abeta 1-40 concentration.

The prepared transdermal drug delivery systems were extensively evaluated for in vitro release, ex vivo permeation through rat abdominal skin, moisture absorption, moisture content, water vapor transmission, stability, and mechanical properties. Formulations F2, F3, and F5 were composed of a 4:1 ratio of HPMC, ERS 100; HPMC, HPC; and HPMC, ERL 100, respectively, whereas F4, F6, and F7 were composed of 3:0.5:0.5 of HPMC, ERS 100, HPC; HPMC, HPC, ERL 100; and HPMC, ERS 100, ERL 100. Formulation F1 was composed of HPMC polymer. All formulations carried 8% v/w of d-limonene as a penetration enhancer and 20% v/w of dibutylphthalate as a plasticizer. The physicochemical interaction between carvedilol and polymers were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Formulation F5 showed both maximum drug release (12.31 mg) and permeation (2987.67 microg/cm2) in 24 h, which differed significantly (P < 0.05) among all the formulations. Formulation F5 showed maximum flux (32.80 microg/h/cm2), which meets the flux requirements, and differed significantly (P < 0.05) among all the formulations with a permeation coefficient of 0.82 x 10(-2) cm/h. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry studies showed no evidence of interaction between the drug and polymers. The formulations mechanical properties, tensile strength and elastic modulus (5.89 kg/cm2 for formulation F5) reveal that they are strong but not brittle. A shelf life of 2 years was predicted for the transdermal drug delivery systems. Carvedilol monolithic matrix-type transdermal therapeutic systems could be prepared having both the required flux and suitable mechanical properties.",

Aldosterone-induced renal injury was associated with increased renal cortical content of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), NAD(P)H oxidase complex formation and mRNA expression of NAD(P)H oxidase membrane components (p22 and gp91). Administration of azelnidipine [3 mg/kg per day, orally (p.o.)] markedly attenuated the aldosterone-induced increases in SBP, UproteinV, renal cortical tissues TBARS content, NAD(P)H oxidase complex formation, mRNA levels of p22 and gp91, and morphological changes. In aldosterone-infused rats, treatment with a nonspecific vasodilator, hydralazine (5 mg/kg per day in drinking water) resulted in a reduction in SBP similar to azelnidipine; however, it did not affect any renal parameters.

The CHANCE study showed a substantial reduction in morbidity and mortality in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a multidisciplinary management programme for patients with chronic heart failure in Russia. Data from the B-Convinced study, also an RCT, suggest that continuation of beta-blocker (BB) therapy in patients hospitalized with worsening heart failure may be associated with improved outcomes when compared with treatment discontinuation. The CHAT study suggests that telephone support can improve prognosis in heart failure patients living in remote rural locations. CIBIS-ELD showed that titration of BBs to target doses in older patients with heart failure is more difficult; but tolerance levels were similar for bisoprolol and carvedilol. Signal-HF randomized elderly heart failure patients to treatment guided by NT-proBNP levels or usual care, and showed no effect of NT-proBNP-guided treatment on outcomes.",

PEC membranes were prepared within a narrow pH window (3.0-3.5) for a SF-HA weight ratio of 20 and they were characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy in addition to characterization studies previously reported by our group. Swelling kinetics of the membranes was studied for a pH window of 2.5-7.4 and cyclic swelling test was performed to determine the pH-responsiveness of the membranes. It was shown that membranes swelled more in alkaline conditions and responded to variations in pH of the medium. Electric-stimuli assisted drug permeation and release studies were performed with a custom-made diffusion cell under both passive condition and electric field applied in pulsatile fashion. The instantaneous flux raised as the current was applied and then declined when the current application was terminated, and this process was repeated on subsequent applications.

This study examined whether enhancing of gap junction coupling can reduce transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) and prevent torsade de pointes (TdP) in a canine LQT2 model. Canine left ventricular wedge preparations were perfused with delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) blocker d-sotalol to mimic LQT2 and the antiarrhythmic peptide 10 (AAP10) was used as a gap junction coupling enhancer. As compared with the control group, the LQT2 group had significantly augmented TDR and higher incidence of TdP associated with increased nonphosphorylated connexin 43 (Cx43). AAP10 prevented augmentation of TDR and induction of TdP while rescuing Cx43 phosphorylation. There was no significant change in the quantity and spatial distribution of Cx43. These data indicate that gap junction enhancer AAP10 can prevent augmentation of TDR and suppress TdP by preventing dephosphorylation of Cx43 in a LQT2 model.",

An excessive release of glutamate is widely considered to be one of the molecular mechanisms of neuronal damage in several neurological diseases. We investigated whether pyridoxine affected glutamate release in rat cerebral cortex nerve terminals (synaptosomes). Pyridoxine inhibited the release of glutamate that was evoked by exposing synaptosomes to the K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and this phenomenon was concentration-dependent. Inhibition of glutamate release by pyridoxine was prevented by the vesicular transporter inhibitor bafilomycin A1, or by chelating intraterminal Ca(2+), but was insensitive to DL-threo-beta-benzyl-oxyaspartate, a glutamate transporter inhibitor. Pyridoxine did not alter the resting synaptosomal membrane potential or 4-AP-mediated depolarization. Examination of the effect of pyridoxine on cytosolic [Ca(2+)] revealed that diminution of glutamate release could be attributed to a reduction in voltage-dependent Ca(2+) influx. Consistent with this, the pyridoxine-mediated inhibition of glutamate release was completely prevented by blocking the N- and P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels, but not by blocking intracellular Ca(2+) release or Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange. Furthermore, the pyridoxine effect on 4-AP-evoked glutamate release was abolished by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I (GF109203X) or bisindolylmaleimide IX (Ro318220), and pyridoxine significantly decreased the 4-AP-induced phosphorylation of PKC, PKCalpha, and myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate. Together, these results suggest that pyridoxine inhibits glutamate release from rat cortical synaptosomes, through the suppression of presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca(2+) entry and PKC activity.",

    "112": "The potential of using CE frontal analysis (CE-FA) to study the interactions between a range of charged low molecular weight drug substances and liposomes was evaluated. The liposomes used were net negatively charged and consisted of 2-oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate monosodium salt in a ratio of 80/20 mol%. Apparent distribution coefficients (D(mem)), defined as the molar concentration of drug substance in the membrane phase divided by the molar concentration of drug substance in the aqueous phase, were successfully determined for six positively and eight negatively charged drug substances with log D(mem) ranging from 1.35 to 3.63. The extent of liposome-buffer distribution was found to be dependent on the drug concentration. The results obtained with the developed CE-FA method were in good agreement with results obtained by equilibrium dialysis. Furthermore, the CE-FA method was faster, less labor intensive and required smaller sample volumes (approximately 50 microL) compared with equilibrium dialysis. Thus, CE-FA is an efficient and useful tool for the characterization of interactions between liposomes and low molecular weight drug substances.",

Both monotherapies with carvedilol and perindopril attenuated the increment of LVEDP, and significantly increased +dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, activity of SR Ca(2+) pump and density of RyR2 (P<0.01). Combined treatment even further enhanced the therapeutic effects, whereas terazosin produced no obvious effect.

    "121": "beta(3)-adrenoceptor activation produces relaxation of human urinary bladder smooth muscle (detrusor). Therefore, beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonism is being investigated as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of overactive bladder. The aim of the current study was to identify the functional presence of beta(3)-adrenoceptors in mouse isolated urinary bladder using the selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist CL316,243 and antagonists SR59230A and L748,337. The effects of CL316,243 on basal tone, spontaneous activity and electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions were investigated using in vitro techniques, while the in vivo effects of intravenously administered CL316,243 on the micturition reflex were investigated using cystometry. CL316,243 decreased basal tone (pEC(50)=6.4+/-0.4) as well as spontaneous activity (53+/-7% at 3 microM) and inhibited EFS-induced contractions (pEC(50)=7.0+/-0.2) of the detrusor muscle. The beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A (1 microM) significantly inhibited the relaxing effects of CL316,243 on basal tone and neurogenic contractions (pA(2)=7.0 and 7.2, respectively). Another beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist L748,337 (1-10 microM) significantly blocked the CL316,243-evoked inhibition of neurogenic contractions in a concentration-dependent manner (pK(B)=6.8), while the selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI118,551(30 nM) had no effect. In anesthetized mice, CL316,243 (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly increased bladder capacity and threshold pressure without a modification of bladder compliance. Moreover, it induced a significant decrease in the amplitude of both micturition and non-voiding contractions. Based on the current results obtained using the beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist CL316,243 (as well as various beta-adrenoceptor antagonists), functional beta(3)-adrenoceptors appear to be present in mouse urinary bladder.", 
    "122": "Current guidelines recommend beta blockers for patients after myocardial infarction (MI). Novel therapies for heart failure should be tested in combination with this medication before entering clinical trials. In this methodologic study, we sought to describe the time course of systolic and diastolic parameters of cardiac performance over a 6-wk period in closed-chest model of swine MI treated with a beta blocker. Myocardial infarction in pigs (n = 10) was induced by 90-min balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Echocardiography and pressure-volume data were collected before and at 1 and 6 wk after MI; histopathology was assessed at 6 wk. Left-ventricular (LV) volume increased significantly over 6 wk, with significant decreases in ejection fraction, wall motion index, stroke work, rate of pressure development (dP/dt(max)), preload recruitable stroke work, and mechanical efficiency. Impairment of diastolic function was manifested by a significant increase in the exponential beta coefficient of the LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relation and reduction of LV pressure decay. At 6 wk, histopathologic analysis showed that the size of the infarct area was 16.3% +/- 4.4%, and the LV mass and myocyte cross-sectional area in both the infarct border and remote zones were increased compared with those of noninfarcted pigs (n = 5). These findings suggest a dynamic pattern of remodeling over time in a closed-chest ischemia-reperfusion swine model of acute MI on beta-blocker therapy and may guide future studies.", 
    "123": "Obesity-associated cardiovascular disease exerts profound human and monetary costs, creating a mounting need for cost-effective and relevant in vivo models of the complex metabolic and vascular interrelationships of obesity. Obesity is associated with endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. Free fatty acids (FFA), generated partly through beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated lipolysis, may impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV) by proinflammatory mechanisms. beta-Adrenergic antagonists protect against cardiovascular events by mechanisms not fully defined. We hypothesized that beta antagonists may exert beneficial effects, in part, by inhibiting lipolysis and reducing FFA. Further, we sought to evaluate the fat-fed rat as an in vivo model of obesity-induced inflammation and EDV. Control and fat-fed rats were given vehicle or beta antagonist for 28 d. Serum FFA were measured to determine the association to serum IL6, TNFalpha, and C-reactive protein and to femoral artery EDV. Compared with controls, fat-fed rats weighed more and had higher FFA, triglyceride, leptin, and insulin levels. Unexpectedly, in control and fat-fed rats, beta antagonism increased FFA, yet inflammatory cytokines were reduced and EDV was preserved. Therefore, reduction of FFA is unlikely to be the mechanism by which beta antagonists protect the endothelium. These results reflect the need for validation of ex vivo models of obesity-induced inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, concurrent with careful control of dietary fat composition and treatment duration.", 
    "124": "In all actual clinical guidelines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) belong to the recommended first line antihypertensive drugs to treat essential hypertension. Several recent large clinical trials have confirmed their efficacy not only in lowering blood pressure but also in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with a normal or high cardiovascular risk profile. In clinical trials such as ALLHAT, VALUE or ASCOT, an amlodipine-based therapy was at least as effective, when not slightly superior, in lowering blood pressure and sometimes more effective in preventing target organ damages than blood pressure lowering strategies based on the use of diuretics, beta-blockers and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. One of the main clinical side effects of the first and second generation CCBs including amlodipine is the development of peripheral edema. The incidence of leg edema can be markedly reduced by combining the CCB with a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system. This strategy has now led to the development of several fixed-dose combinations of amlodipine and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Another alternative to lower the incidence of edema is to use CCBs of the third generation such as lercanidipine. Indeed, although no major clinical trials have been conducted with this compound, clinical studies have shown that lercanidipine and amlodipine have a comparable antihypertensive efficacy but with significantly less peripheral edema in patients receiving lercanidipine. In some countries, lercanidipine is now available in a single-pill association with an ACE inhibitor thereby further improving its efficacy and tolerability profile.", 
    "125": "For the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, the most frequent cause of irreversible visual loss, fixed combinations of different topical intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering molecules have gained an important role in recent years. The use of fixed combinations reduces the number of daily instillations, which promotes adherence to the prescribed medication and diminishes the exposition of the ocular surface to preservatives. The fixed combination of brinzolamide and timolol was recently approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and is now available in several countries in Europe. It contains two molecules widely used to treat glaucoma: timolol 0.5% (5 mg/ml) and brinzolamide 1% (10 mg/ml) in ophthalmic suspension formulation. This fixed combination is approved for twice-daily instillation to reduce elevated IOP in open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The brinzolamide/timolol fixed combination provides an approximately 30-33% IOP reduction from the untreated baseline IOP of 25-27 mmHg; thus, it is more potent than either of its ingredients alone. It is similarly effective but better tolerated than the dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination, which consists of molecules from the same pharmacological classes. The brinzolamide/timolol fixed combination can be used by itself as a separate therapy, but owing to the additivity of its ingredients to IOP-lowering drugs belonging to other classes, it may also be administered adjunctive to other IOP-reducing molecules, most importantly topical prostaglandin analogues. The ocular and systemic tolerance of the brinzolamide/ timolol fixed combination was reported favorable in Phase III studies, but no long-term clinical experience with this preparation is available at present.",

    "130": "During a 33-month follow-up of 1038 consecutive patients who had implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, appropriate shocks occurred in 329 of 1038 patients (32%). Appropriate shocks occurred in 101 of 380 patients (27%) treated with beta-adrenergic blockers alone; in 31 of 95 patients (33%) treated with amiodarone alone; in 39 of 149 patients (26%) treated with beta-blockers plus amiodarone; in 11 of 28 patients (39%) treated with sotalol alone; and in 147 of 386 patients (38%) treated with no beta-blockers, amiodarone, or sotalol (P < 0.001 comparing patients treated with beta-adrenergic blockers alone with patients treated with no beta-blockers, amiodarone, or sotalol; and P < 0.01 comparing patients treated with beta-blockers plus amiodarone with patients treated with no beta-blockers, amiodarone, or sotalol). In conclusion, patients having implantable cardioverter-defibrillators should also be treated with beta-adrenergic blockers to reduce the frequency of appropriate shocks.", 
    "131": "The incidence of postoperative stroke ranges from 0.08% to 0.7% in noncardiac surgery. Recently, the PeriOperative ISchemic Evaluation (POISE) study reported an incidence of postoperative stroke of 1% in patients scheduled for noncardiac surgery when beta blockers were initiated immediately before surgery. To assess the association between chronic beta-blocker use and postoperative stroke in noncardiac surgery, we undertook a case-control study among 186,779 patients who underwent noncardiac surgery from 2000 to 2008 at the Erasmus Medical Centre. Patients who were undergoing intracerebral surgery or carotid surgery or who had head and/or carotid trauma were excluded. The case subjects were 34 patients (0.02%) who had experienced a stroke within 30 days after surgery. Of the remaining patients, 2 controls were selected for each case and were stratified according to calendar year, type of surgery, and age. For cases and controls, information was obtained regarding beta-blocker use before surgery, the presence of cardiac risk factors, and the use of other cardiovascular medication. The use of beta blockers was as common in the cases as in the controls (29% vs 29%; p = 1.0). The adjusted odds ratio for postoperative stroke among beta-blocker users compared with nonusers was 0.4 (95% confidence interval 0.1 to 1.5). Similar results were obtained in the subgroups of patients stratified according to the use of cardiovascular therapy and the presence of cardiac risk factors. In conclusion, the present case-control study has shown no increased risk of postoperative stroke in patients taking chronic beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "132": "Folic acid (FA) is crucial for fetal development. We aimed to study the modulation of FA placental uptake by: hyperserotoninemia and hyperglycaemia, anti-hypertensives, insulin and drugs of abuse. For this, we characterized (3)H-FA uptake by primary cultures of human cytotrophoblasts (TB cells) and tested the effects of these compounds upon (3)H-FA uptake, TB cell viability and gene expression. Our results show that: (a) acutely, (3)H-FA uptake was decreased by labetalol (0.1-1000 microM), ecstasy and amphetamine (0.025-25 microM); and (b) chronically, (3)H-FA uptake was decreased by high glucose (30 mM), atenolol, nicotine (0.1 and 10 microM), ethanol (0.01 and 10mM), ecstasy, amphetamine (0.25 and 1 microM) and tetrahydrocannabinol (1 and 100 nM). Moreover, many of these drugs were cytotoxic and they differentially modulated the mRNA expression of FA placental transport systems. Our results suggest that inhibition of FA placental uptake may constitute one of the mechanisms involved in the fetotoxicity of many of the compounds tested.", 
    "133": "Heart rate is a major determinant of myocardial oxygen consumption and of cardiac work, and thus reduction of heart rate may represent an important strategy for the treatment of patients with a wide range of cardiac disorders. In addition, several experimental lines of research point to high heart rate as an important risk factor for atherosclerosis and, thus, pharmacologic heart rate reduction could prevent or retard the development of atherosclerotic plaques and increase survival. Today, in patients with acute or chronic coronary syndromes or with congestive heart failure, reducing heart rate is a generally accepted treatment modality. Up to now, no human study has been performed to demonstrate the efficacy and the risk-benefit ratio of cardiac slowing in patients without cardiac disorders. However, recent retrospective analyses of the INternational VErapamil-SR/trandolapril STudy and the Paris Prospective Study 1 provided promising results. Treatment of high heart rate in healthy subjects appears to be premature, but in clinical conditions such as hypertension or diabetes, the reduction of elevated heart rate appears a desirable additional goal of therapy.", 
    "134": "In the past 2 decades, there have been growing evidences that resting heart rate might be a marker of risk or even a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This article reviews current evidences concerning the relation between heart rate and patients' outcome in different clinical settings such as acute coronary syndromes, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and heart failure. The relationship between resting heart rate and the development of coronary artery disease, as well as all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, has been found to be strong, graded, and independent from other risk factors. Several lines of research indicate that heart rate plays an important role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and in the clinical manifestations of coronary artery disease and that it is an independent prognostic factor in all coronary syndromes. The prognostic value of elevated heart rate in patients with heart failure has been tested in several clinical trials evaluating pharmacologic heart rate-lowering agents (eg, beta-blockers). It is difficult to determine which percentage of the clinical benefit obtained with beta-blockers is related to induced bradycardia because cardiac slowing is only one of the effects of these drugs. In the BEAUTIFUL trial, a subgroup analysis conducted in patients with resting HR more than 70 beats per minute showed that treatment with ivabradine was able to improve outcome. According to the results presented in this review, we can conclude that heart rate is a predictor of death in both stable coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndromes. Elevated heart rate is also able to negatively predict clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure. However, it is still unclear if heart rate reduction per se can improve prognosis.", 
    "135": "Cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling in hypertension has been associated with impaired exercise capacity. The authors tested whether an angiotensin receptor blocker, candesartan, improved exercise peak oxygen volume (VO2) in this population. A total of 154 untreated hypertensive patients, aged 40 to 66 years, with World Health Organization stage I or II hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, were randomized to receive placebo, candesartan (32 mg), each of these plus aspirin (300 mg/d), or the same preparations in a reverse order, for 3 weeks, with a 3-week washout period between treatments. The authors measured maximal workload and oxygen reserve with an exercise test, 24 hour-ambulatory blood pressure, and echocardiography at the end of each treatment. Hypertensive patients did not achieve the maximal workload (116 [99-133] W vs 132 (AMA style = no period on vs) [116-149] W; P=.01). This impaired exercise capacity was in a multiple regression analysis related to lower oxygen reserve (r=0.49, P<.001), and the lower oxygen reserve to higher left ventricular hypertrophy by echocardiography (beta=-0.34), respectively. The use of candesartan alone or with aspirin resulted in an improvement of peak VO2 and exercise tolerance, when compared with controls. Patients with hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy cannot achieve a predicted maximal workload. The use of an angiotensin receptor blocker in therapy may represent a useful treatment in these patients for its effect on exercise peak VO2 and exercise tolerance. The use of aspirin did not affect outcome.", 
    "136": "Current therapy for preventing the first variceal bleed includes beta-blocker and variceal band ligation (VBL). VBL has lower bleeding rates, with no differences in survival, whereas beta-blocker therapy can be limited by side effects. Carvedilol, a non-cardioselective vasodilating beta-blocker, is more effective in reducing portal pressure than propranolol; however, there have been no clinical studies assessing the efficacy of carvedilol in primary prophylaxis. The goal of this study was to compare carvedilol and VBL for the prevention of the first variceal bleed in a randomized controlled multicenter trial. One hundred fifty-two cirrhotic patients from five different centers with grade II or larger esophageal varices were randomized to either carvedilol 12.5 mg once daily or VBL performed every 2 weeks until eradication using a multibander device. Seventy-seven patients were randomized to carvedilol and 75 to VBL. Baseline characteristics did not differ between the groups (alcoholic liver disease, 73%; median Child-Pugh score, 8; median age, 54 years; median follow-up, 20 months). On intention-to-treat analysis, carvedilol had lower rates of the first variceal bleed (10% versus 23%; relative hazard 0.41; 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.96 [P = 0.04]), with no significant differences in overall mortality (35% versus 37%, P = 0.71), and bleeding-related mortality (3% versus 1%, P = 0.26). Six patients in the VBL group bled as a result of banding ulcers. Per-protocol analysis revealed no significant differences in the outcomes.",

The comparison considered the analysis time, selectivity, peak shape (column efficiency and asymmetry) and resolution, and was extended to a wide range of mobile phase compositions. The Chromolith column showed good performance for the analysis of beta-blockers with regard to the packed columns. In terms of selectivity and analysis time, the greatest similarity was found between the Chromolith and XTerra columns. The addition of a silanol blocking agent (0.1% triethylamine) to both Chromolith and Spherisorb columns yielded, apparently, a similar blocking degree of the silanol groups (based on the similar peak shapes), and gave rise to similar selectivity.", 
    "144": "Inadequate skin permeability is the main challenge encountered in the transdermal drug delivery and to solve this crisis physical and chemical enhancement techniques are being developed. The aim of the present investigation was to study the combined effect of two such techniques, iontophoresis and esterification, on the transdermal delivery of atenolol. A series of ester prodrugs of atenolol were synthesized, characterized and studied for physicochemical properties and stability. In vitro permeation studies were carried out for atenolol and prodrugs at different donor concentrations (5, 10, and 20 mM) by passive process and iontophoresis (0.5 mA/cm(2)). Evaluation of the physicochemical parameters showed significant increase in lipophilicity and slight reduction in pK value in the ester prodrugs compared to parent drug. Stability studies revealed higher stability at pH 4 than pH 6. Prodrugs significantly enhanced the transdermal flux of atenolol in passive process while in iontophoresis the enhancement ranged from 1.4 to 2.7 fold compared to atenolol. In the prodrug series, permeation rate increased with increase in the length of alkyl side chain up to the addition of 5 carbon units, but thereafter no specific pattern was recorded in both passive and iontophoretic process. The steady state flux was highest in atenolol valerate (1.48 micromol/cm(2) h), which shows the promise of meeting the desired permeation rate (3.0- 31.0 micromol/ h) for maintenance of the therapeutic level in a 70 kg human.", 
    "145": "The chromatographic performance of a Chromolith RP-18e column was comprehensively examined for a group of basic drugs (beta-blockers), eluted with isocratic ACN-water mixtures at increasing flow-rate up to 6 mL/min. As the flow-rate increases at fixed mobile phase composition, peak distribution (selectivity) is maintained, but the relative peak widths increase. This reduces the resolution below satisfactory values for closely eluting compounds. With the monolithic column, flow-rate becomes thus an important factor to be optimised, in addition to the mobile phase composition. Since, theoretically, retention factors (k) are independent of the flow-rate, the classical quadratic model relating log k with the solvent content allows the prediction of the retention at any combination of organic solvent content and flow-rate. The small deviations found for the most retained compounds were corrected by including, in the quadratic model, an additional term correlating linearly log k with the flow-rate. Peak shape and resolution changes were predicted by taking advantage of the approximated linear relationships between peak half-widths and retention times, which offered similar coefficients for peaks eluting at different organic solvent contents and flow-rates. The accuracy of the predictions in critical conditions was experimentally verified to be satisfactory.",

There is also evidence suggesting that the two dementia types thought to be most common, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, have overlapping risk factors. Seven placebo-controlled trials of antihypertensive treatment have assessed cognitive function, incident dementia, or both, with mixed outcomes. The Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET), despite showing reductions in mortality and stroke with active treatment, found no significant reduction of incident dementia, although the trial was stopped early. Meta-analyses used to explore this area further are inconclusive, and comparative trials are now required.", 
    "149": "Recent evidence suggests that central blood pressure is a more important determinant of cardiovascular risk than brachial pressure. Interestingly, antihypertensive drugs exert different effects on brachial and central pressure. Traditional beta-blockers, such as atenolol, appear to have an adverse impact on central pressure, despite lowering brachial pressure. This may help to explain the results of recent large outcome studies using atenolol. Further research is required to clarify whether other antihypertensive agents lower central pressure beyond the effects observed on brachial pressure.", 
    "150": "Controlling hypertension is known to be the most important treatment in preventing stroke. The past decade has been spent in debate over which class of hypertensive medication is most effective. This article reviews the studies assessing the efficacy of each agent class in secondary stroke prevention. The comparison of studies and agents is often difficult because of differences in achieved blood pressures and in the exact agents and combinations of agents that are used. Meta-analysis has attempted to resolve some of these difficulties by using meta-regression modeling to predict \"expected\" risk reduction given an achieved blood pressure. The resultant ability to give a value to \"blood pressure-independent\" effects is questioned. The effect of reducing blood pressure far outweighs any other effect in reducing stroke risk, and the agent that has been shown to be most consistently equal or superior to any agent compared with it has been amlodipine, a calcium-channel blocker.", 
    "151": "In the last decade there have been considerable advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VA) and Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD). Over 80% of SCD occurs in patients with organic heart disease. However, approximately 10-15% of SCD occurs in the presence of structurally normal heart and the majority of those patients are young. In this group of patients, changes in genes encoding cardiac ion channels produce modification of the function of the channel resulting in an electrophysiological substrate of VA and SCD. Collectively these disorders are referred to as Cardiac Ion Channelopathies. The 4 major syndromes in this group are: The Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), the Brugada Syndrome (BrS), the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS), and the Catecholaminergic Polymorphic VT (CPVT). Each of these syndromes includes multiple subtypes with different and sometimes complex genetic abnormalities of cardiac ion channels. Many are associated with other somatic and neurological abnormalities besides the risk of VA and SCD. The current management of cardiac ion channelopathy could be summarized as follows: 1) in symptomatic patients, the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the only viable option; 2) in asymptomatic patients, risk stratification is necessary followed by the ICD, pharmacotherapy, or a combination of both. A genotype-specific approach to pharmacotherapy requires a thorough understanding of the molecular-cellular basis of arrhythmogenesis in cardiac ion channelopathies as well as the specific drug profile.",

The laboratory findings revealed that plasma renin activity was 59.0 ng mL hr and plasma aldosterone concentration was 1700 pg mL together with serum creatinine of 0.42 mg dL and serum potassium of 2.8 mEq L. Urinalysis revealed insignificant findings. Her hypertension was extremely resistant to antihypertensive agents, including hydralazine, alpha-methyldopa, and alpha beta blocker, leading to suspicion of secondary hypertension as a cause. Adrenal tumor was not detected but Doppler ultrasonography suggested the constriction of the right renal artery consistent with renovascular hypertension. Considering the following imaging test and medications, the patient and her family decided to abort the pregnancy. 3D-CT and MR angiography showed stenosis of the right renal artery, therefore, percutaneous transcatheter renal angioplasty was performed, resulting in normalization of the blood pressure without antihypertensives. Two years later she successfully gave birth uneventfully. Her hypertension was presumably irrelevant to preeclampsia because it occurred at 10 weeks of pregnancy and proteinuria was not associated. The stenosis of the right renal artery was probably due to fibromuscular dysplasia, which is one of the major causes of renal artery stenosis in young women. This patient was such a case and presented a difficult decision on how to treat and whether or not to abort.

Results of in-vivo research shows that actions at ERb may underline some antidepressant effects of estrogen. We hypothesized that trilostane may exert antidepressive effects in the forced swim in part due to actions through ERb. Trilostane (25 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), compared with vehicle, had significant antidepressant-like effects but only when administered to wild-type, not ERb knockout, mice.

We utilized echocardiography and pressure-volume (PV) loop analyses to determine whether LV contractility was decreased in inbred C57BL/6J mice exposed to IH and whether blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors modified the response to hypoxia. Adult male 9- to 10-wk-old mice were exposed to 4 wk of IH (nadir inspired O(2) 5-6% at 60 cycles/h for 12 h during the light period) or intermittent air (IA) as control. A second group of animals were exposed to the same regimen of IH or IA, but in the presence of nonspecific beta-blockade with propranolol. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and PV loop analyses, and mRNA and protein expression in ventricular homogenates was determined. Contrary to our expectations, we found with PV loop analyses that LV ejection fraction (63.4 +/- 3.5 vs. 50.5 +/- 2.6%, P = 0.015) and other measures of LV contractility were increased in IH-exposed animals compared with IA controls. There were no changes in contractile proteins, atrial natriuretic peptide levels, LV posterior wall thickness, or heart weight with IH exposure. However, cAMP levels were elevated after IH, and propranolol administration attenuated the increase in LV contractility induced by IH exposure. We conclude that, contrary to our hypothesis, 4 wk of IH exposure in C57BL/6J mice causes an increase in LV contractility that occurs independent of ventricular hypertrophy and is, in part, mediated by activation of cardiac beta-adrenergic pathways.",

If target blood pressure (< 140/90 mmHg) was not achieved at week 4, hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg/day) was also administered. Plasma levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and vWF were determined at baseline and after treatment. Between-group baseline characteristics and blood pressure decrease were comparable. Losartan significantly reduced plasma PAI-1 and vWF and PAI-1/tPA ratio. Atenolol significantly increased plasma tPA, but PAI-1, vWF and PAI-1/tPA ratio were unchanged.

However, whether Angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) is critically required to the development of T3-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy as well as whether the intracellular mechanisms that are triggered by AT1R are able to contribute to this hypertrophy model is unknown. To address these questions, we employed a selective small interfering RNA (siRNA, 50 nM) or an AT1R blocker (Losartan, 1 microM) to evaluate the specific role of this receptor in primary cultures of neonatal cardiomyocytes submitted to T3 (10 nM) treatment. The cardiomyocytes transfected with the AT1R siRNA presented reduced mRNA (90%, P < 0.001) and protein (70%, P < 0.001) expression of AT1R. The AT1R silencing and the AT1R blockade totally prevented the T3-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, as evidenced by lower mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic factor (66%, P < 0.01) and skeletal alpha-actin (170%, P < 0.01) as well as by reduction in protein synthesis (85%, P < 0.001). The cardiomyocytes treated with T3 demonstrated a rapid activation of Akt/GSK-3beta/mTOR signaling pathway, which was completely inhibited by the use of PI3K inhibitors (LY294002, 10 microM and Wortmannin, 200 nM). In addition, we demonstrated that the AT1R mediated the T3-induced activation of Akt/GSK-3beta/mTOR signaling pathway, since the AT1R silencing and the AT1R blockade attenuated or totally prevented the activation of this signaling pathway. We also reported that local Angiotensin I/II (Ang I/II) levels (120%, P < 0.05) and the AT1R expression (180%, P < 0.05) were rapidly increased by T3 treatment. These data demonstrate for the first time that the AT1R is a critical mediator to the T3-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy as well as to the activation of Akt/GSK-3beta/mTOR signaling pathway. These results represent a new insight into the mechanism of T3-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, indicating that the Ang I/II-AT1R-Akt/GSK-3beta/mTOR pathway corresponds to a potential mediator of the trophic effect exerted by T3 in cardiomyocytes.",

    "203": "All-cause mortality rates were 6% (95% CI 3% to 8%) at 1 month, 11% (8% to 14%) at 3 months and 14% (11% to 18%) at 6 months in the 2004-5 cohort compared with 16% (13% to 20%), 22% (19% to 25%) and 26% (22% to 29%), respectively, in the 1995-7 cohort (difference between the two cohorts, p<0.001). The difference in survival was not explained by any difference in the demographics or severity of heart failure at presentation. There was a difference at baseline and thereafter in the use of neurohormonal antagonists (beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors).", 
    "204": "Although early mortality remains high among patients with newly diagnosed heart failure in the UK general population, there is strong evidence of a marked improvement in survival from 1995-7 to 2004-5, perhaps partly explained by an increased usage of neurohormonal antagonists.", 
    "205": "We had proposed previously a novel combination of beta2-adrenoreceptor (AR) agonist and beta1-AR blocker that in the rat model of postmyocardial infarction (MI) dilated cardiomyopathy exceeds the therapeutic effectiveness of either monotherapy. In the present study, we compared that treatment with a combination of beta1-AR blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), a current standard chronic heart failure (CHF) therapy. Two weeks after coronary artery ligation, rats were divided into groups of similar average MI size, measured by echocardiography, and the following 12-month treatments were initiated: fenoterol (250 microg/kg/day), a beta2-AR agonist, plus metoprolol (100 mg/kg/day), a beta1-AR blocker (beta1-beta2+); metoprolol plus enalapril (20 mg/kg/day), an ACEi (beta1-ACEi); and a combination of all three drugs (beta1-beta2+ACEi). These treatment groups were compared with each other and with nontreated (nT) and sham groups. The 12-month mortality was significantly reduced in all treatment groups (44% in beta1-beta2+, 56% in beta1-beta2+ACEi, 59% in beta1-ACEi versus 81% in nT). Bimonthly echocardiography revealed significant attenuation of the left ventricular (LV) chamber remodeling, LV functional deterioration, and MI expansion in all three treatment groups, but effects were significantly more pronounced when treatment included a beta2-AR agonist. The results indicated that a combination of beta1-AR blocker and beta2-AR agonist is equipotent to a combination of beta1-AR blocker and ACEi in the treatment of CHF in rats, with the respect to mortality, and exceeds the latter with respect to cardiac remodeling and MI expansion. Thus, this novel therapeutic regimen for CHF warrants detailed clinical investigation."
