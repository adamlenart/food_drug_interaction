PGE2, PIA and clonidine inhibited markedly lipolysis stimulated by MIX, and slightly that stimulated by isoprenaline. Whilst propranolol inhibited markedly lipolysis stimulated by isoprenaline and slightly that stimulated by MIX. These results indicate that the inhibitory activity of PGE2, adenosine and alpha-2-adrenergic receptor stimulation depends upon the presence of MIX, whereas that of the beta-adrenoceptor blockade does not.", 
    "1": "Responsiveness to catecholamines may be blunted after prolonged exposure to an agonist; this phenomenon, termed desensitization, is often mediated by receptor down-regulation. beta-Adrenergic receptors mediate relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. We have examined the possibility that this response may be desensitized after prolonged exposure to increased concentrations of epinephrine. Rats were treated with epinephrine infusions (300 micrograms/kg/hr from a minipump) for 7 days and had levels of plasma epinephrine 70-fold greater than those of controls. The mesenteric artery rings from the epinephrine-treated rats contracted normally when exposed to serotonin; however, the extent of relaxation promoted by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol was blunted (86 +/- 4 vs. 43 +/- 9%; p less than 0.05). Acetylcholine and nitroglycerine, which may act through a cyclic GMP mechanism, caused virtually identical relaxation responses in both control and epinephrine-treated groups. To determine the mechanism for the loss in responsiveness to isoproterenol, we measured adrenergic receptors in individual mesenteric arteries using [125I]cyanopindolol. Specific binding of [125I]cyanopindolol was found to have the expected characteristics of interaction with beta receptors. There was no difference in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors between control and epinephrine-treated animals (24 +/- 5 vs. 26 +/- 6 fmol/mg of protein), although there was significantly marked down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in hearts (23 +/- 2 vs. 10 +/- 1 fmol/mg of protein; p less than 0.001) and lungs (172 +/- 29 vs. 76 +/- 7 fmol/mg of protein; p less than 0.01) in the same rats. The ability of isoproterenol to stimulate cyclic AMP production in the mesenteric arteries from the two groups was not significantly different (20.3 +/- 3.5 vs. 23.8 +/- 4.7 pmol of cAMP/mg of protein/2 min). Furthermore, mesenteric artery relaxation was found to be decreased in response to the cyclic AMP analogue dibutyryl cyclic AMP (45 +/- 2.0 vs. 28 +/- 2.0%; p less than 0.001) in the epinephrine-infused rats. These data suggest that the desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated smooth muscle relaxation may be caused by a mechanism distal to cyclic AMP production.", 
    "2": "Current concepts of collagen metabolism suggest that fibroblasts tightly control collagen production. One of the possible mechanisms of control is via the cyclic nucleotides, cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP). Beta adrenergic agonists, by elevating intracellular cAMP levels, have been shown in vitro to suppress fibroblast collagen production; whereas beta adrenergic antagonists were effective in removing this suppression by blocking the rise in cAMP. In the present study with mice, we showed that administration of the beta adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, at a dose demonstrated to decrease the ratio of cAMP to cGMP, resulted in an elevation in total lung collagen in vivo. The increase in collagen was evident only when propranolol was administered before and during acute lung damage induced by either butylated hydroxytoluene, bleomycin or high concentrations of oxygen. There was no increase in lung collagen when propranolol administration was delayed after injury or when given to an undamaged lung. We propose that via beta adrenergic blockade by propranolol, fibroblasts involved in the normal reparative process may have lost a mechanism for regulatory control, resulting in excessive deposition of collagen.", 
    "3": "Specific binding sites for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) were characterized in dispersed rat parotid acini. The binding of [125I]VIP was rapid, saturable, reversible, and temperature dependent. Scatchard analysis indicated two functionally independent classes of receptor sites: 41,000 high affinity-low capacity sites per cell with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 6.4 nM and 420,000 low affinity-high capacity sites per cell with a Kd of 150 nM. A peptide with N-terminal histidine and C-terminal isoleucine and secretin, which are structurally related to VIP, inhibited the tracer binding 30 and 200 times less strongly, respectively, than VIP. Epinephrine and carbachol did not inhibit [125I]VIP binding to parotid acinar cells. VIP stimulated cAMP accumulation in parotid lobules and induced amylase secretion in a dose-dependent manner. A peptide with N-terminal histidine and C-terminal isoleucine and secretin were less potent than VIP regarding cAMP accumulation (1/12 and 1/80 of VIP, respectively) and amylase secretion (1/40 and 1/500 of VIP, respectively). Substance P did not stimulate cAMP accumulation but stimulated amylase secretion more strongly than VIP. These observations clearly demonstrated the presence of VIP receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase system in the rat parotid gland, which plays an important role in the regulation of the amylase secretion. The regulation of parotid function by VIP was independent of the adrenergic or muscarinic regulatory system and of the influence of substance P.", 
    "4": "It seems possible to draw some overall conclusions from the data on antiarrhythmic drug-induced QT prolongation and its role in drug effects. At one end of the spectrum are patients with highly exaggerated QT responses during therapy, most often in the setting of hypokalemia and long cycle lengths (post-ectopic pauses, bradycardia). These patients may be at high risk for development of arrhythmias during therapy. It should also be remembered that the presence of hypokalemia may render antiarrhythmic agents less effective in general. On the other hand, modest QT prolongation in the course of therapy with an antiarrhythmic drug may well be a marker of reduction of dispersion of action potential durations or refractory periods and hence represent an antiarrhythmic effect. The clinical actions of these drugs in patients with arrhythmias strongly suggest that this is the case. New agents with the ability to reduce dispersion of repolarization or of refractoriness without inducing arrhythmias may well become the agents of choice for the treatment of serious cardiac rhythm disturbances.", 
    "5": "Using echocardiography, we identified 21 patients with a syndrome that included severe concentric cardiac hypertrophy, a small left ventricular cavity, and supernormal indexes of systolic function without concurrent medical illness or ischemic heart disease. Thirteen of the patients presented with dyspnea or chest pain. All patients studied had a history of hypertension and were compared with normotensive controls matched for age and sex. The patients were elderly (mean age, 73.3 years), predominantly female (16 patients), and mostly black (15 patients). Their cardiac function was characterized by excessive left ventricular emptying (ejection fraction on two-dimensional echocardiography [patients vs. controls], 79 +/- 4 vs. 59 +/- 5 per cent, P less than 0.001) and abnormal diastolic function as manifested by a prolonged early diastolic filling period (279 +/- 25 vs. 160 +/- 45 msec, P less than 0.001) and reduced peak diastolic dimension increase (11 +/- 4 vs. 16 +/- 5 cm per second, P less than 0.05). In spite of the clinical presentation of heart failure, all of 9 patients receiving either beta-receptor antagonists or calcium-channel blocking agents obtained symptomatic relief, whereas 6 of 12 patients receiving vasodilator medications had severe hypotensive reactions, including one death. We conclude that this unique subset of hypertensive patients has a clinical syndrome that warrants recognition and tailored management.", 
    "6": "Verapamil exerts a wide spectrum of hemodynamic effects in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC), and its administration offers an important alternative to beta-receptor blocker therapy in such patients. The intravenous administration of verapamil to 62 patients in the catheterization laboratory decreased systolic blood pressure from 118 +/- 17 to 102 +/- 17 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). It had no significant effect on heart rate, mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure, left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure or cardiac output; however, LV outflow gradient in the basal state decreased from 62 +/- 34 to 29 +/- 34 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). These findings demonstrate a decrease in LV outflow tract obstruction. Radionuclide angiography indicated the major action responsible for the reduction in obstruction appears to be an improvement in LV diastolic function. Short-term nifedipine administration to patients with HC produced no significant effect on LV outflow tract gradients and early diastolic filling. Short-term double-blind studies showed that verapamil improved exercise time by 26 +/- 35% (p less than 0.005) compared with placebo, whereas propranolol improved it by 21 +/- 35% (p less than 0.025). In a separate study, verapamil improved exercise duration by 38 +/- 58% (p = 0.02) compared with placebo, whereas nifedipine improved it by 20 +/- 47% (difference is not significant). Verapamil resulted in a more beneficial subjective symptomatic response than propranolol or nifedipine when compared with placebo. Long-term verapamil therapy was instituted in 227 patients; 133 of these patients have continued taking the medication for an average of 25 +/- 13 months because their quality of life improved compared with what they experienced with their former therapy (usually beta blocker). Improved exercise capacity of 40% has been maintained in 32 patients for 2 years. A decrease in ventricular septal thickness of 1.5 +/- 2.6 mm was also found in 32 patients studied after 39 +/- 8 months of verapamil therapy. Nine patients died during follow-up study, but it is unclear whether the drug increased survival or, conversely, whether any of the deaths could be attributed to verapamil administration. Significant adverse electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects were seen in 59 instances. The electrophysiologic events, atrioventricular block and sinus arrest, were definitely verapamil-related, but it is uncertain how many of the hemodynamic problems of hypotension and pulmonary congestion were drug-related.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "7": "Combination therapy using calcium-channel blockers and beta blockers in patients with refractory chronic stable angina has gained much popularity, but remains highly controversial because of the potential for serious additive deleterious hemodynamic or electrophysiologic reactions. In studies involving patients with preserved left ventricular function receiving chronic oral beta blockers, short-term administration of intravenous verapamil has been shown to cause a further lowering in heart rate and blood pressure while prolonging atrioventricular node conduction; additive cardiodepressant effects were noted, including a tendency toward increased left and right heart filling pressures. Nifedipine, on the other hand, when added acutely to beta blockers, causes an increase in heart rate, a decrease in blood pressure and either no change or a slight improvement in most cardiac performance variables. Controlled, double-blind clinical trials have demonstrated that combinations of calcium-channel blockers and beta blockers result in augmented symptom benefit compared with either drug class alone. The predominant mechanism responsible for such improvement is increased lowering of myocardial oxygen demand by virtue of additive diminution in heart rate, blood pressure and, consequently, pressure-rate product both at rest and during exercise. Verapamil (and possibly diltiazem) plus beta blockers appears to have the greatest therapeutic efficacy but also the highest frequency of harmful adverse cardiac effects, whereas nifedipine plus beta blockers is generally safer but also less efficacious. Factors that should be carefully considered by clinicians contemplating combination therapy are the choice of calcium-channel blocker, the dose of calcium-channel blocker and beta blocker, the presence of antecedent left ventricular dysfunction or conduction system disease and the possibility of drug interactions. Concomitant calcium-channel blocker and beta-blocker therapy is an important contribution to the pharmacologic management of resistant patients who remain symptomatic during single drug treatment. However, the possibility of additive adverse cardiac effects mandates careful patient selection and close clinical monitoring.", 
    "8": "The diagnosis of coronary artery spasm is confirmed by angiography, for example, change in caliber of the coronary arteries plus evidence of ischemia. The prevalence and contribution of coronary artery spasm in the individual patient with symptoms of ischemic heart disease is not known and depends on how the condition is defined. The prognosis of patients with coronary artery spasm appears to depend on the presence or absence of severe coronary atherosclerosis, that is, those with severe disease have a worse prognosis. Nitrates should be used to initiate therapy in all patients with this problem. Intravenous nitrates have proven useful in patients whose symptoms are difficult to control and who require hospitalization. beta blockers used alone may be detrimental in patients with coronary artery spasm, but studies supporting the detrimental effects are few. The combination of nitrates, beta blockers and nifedipine has proved effective therapy for many patients with recurrent angina at rest, possibly related to coronary artery spasm. Several open-label and double-blind placebo control trials have shown that all of the calcium antagonists are effective short-term agents for patients with proven coronary artery spasm. When nifedipine was compared with isosorbide dinitrate in a randomized crossover, double-blind trial in patients with coronary artery spasm, both drugs were shown to be efficacious and neither was superior. The traditional alpha-blocking agents have not been shown to be an effective therapy, but a recent study of prazosin, a selective alpha blocker, revealed excellent results in patients whose conditions were resistant to therapy with traditional calcium blockers, beta blockers and, in 1 case, phenoxybenzamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Calcium-entry blocking agents resemble established dilators such as diazoxide, minoxidil and hydralazine in that they act predominantly on the arterial resistance vessels and have little or no effect upon the veins. They have therefore been evaluated in the treatment of hypertension. Controlled studies have shown that verapamil and nifedipine are effective in decreasing blood pressure when given as sole agents. The antihypertensive effect of nifedipine is additive with that of a beta blocker, and nifedipine is also effective when given as a \"third step\" agent in combination with a beta blocker (or alpha methyldopa) and a diuretic. In contrast to other directly acting dilators, nifedipine causes, at most, only moderate stimulation of renin secretion and verapamil does not increase renin release at all; neither drug induces sodium retention. Both verapamil and nifedipine produce a moderate incidence of unwanted effects; these are mostly subjective in nature, but verapamil may cause constipation that is occasionally severe and nifedipine sometimes causes ankle swelling. Calcium-entry blockers should be considered as initial therapy when some contraindication exists to the use of other standard drugs. Nifedipine appears preferable to hydralazine for use in combination with a beta blocker and a diuretic: it is at least as effective as hydralazine and has a lower incidence of serious adverse effects.", 
    "10": "P815, a murine mastocytoma cell line, possesses beta-adrenergic binding sites as assessed by using [3H]dihydroalprenolol (antagonist) and [3H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol (agonist). The number of binding sites per cell was 29 000 for the agonist and 75 000 for the antagonist, as determined by direct binding assays and inhibition experiments on intact cells. On membrane preparations from the same cells, binding of alprenolol was only displaceable by antagonists, while stereospecific binding of hydroxybenzylisoproterenol was only displaceable by agonists. The P815 membranes also possessed an adenylate cyclase stimulated by Gpp(NH)p and NaF but not by 1-isoproterenol. The intracellular cAMP level of intact cells was not modulated by 1-isoproterenol or by 1-epinephrine, but was increased by forskolin. These results suggest that the beta-adrenergic receptor of P815 mastocytoma cells is non-functional. This may explain the failure of agonists to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in these cells.", 
    "11": "Lymphocytosis promoting factor (LPF), alternatively described as pertussis toxin, inhibits the vasodilation after beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation with salbutamol as well as the negative chronotropic activity induced by the muscarinic receptor stimulant arecoline 4 days after vaccination of rats. To analyse whether arachidonic acid metabolites contributed to these phenomena the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin and the phospholipase A2 inhibitor dexamethasone were administered over a period of 4 days. Pretreatment with either drug restored beta 2-adrenoceptor responsiveness. The cardiac anticholinergic effect, however, was not changed. Interestingly, neither of the inhibitors prevented the blood pressure lowering effect of LPF. The reversing effect on vascular beta 2-hyporesponsiveness of indomethacin and dexamethasone therefore appears to be rather specific. It is concluded that endogenous prostaglandins may participate in the vascular beta 2-adrenergic impairment caused by LPF. Furthermore, the results are considered in view of desensitization theories and underlying mechanisms of LPF-induced autonomic impairment.", 
    "12": "Serotonergic raphe deafferentiation elicits an up regulation of a nM (3H)WB-4101 binding site in rat hippocampus for which norepinephrine displays high affinity and prazosin displays low affinity. Guanine nucleotide affects the nM binding to hippocampal alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. Firstly, Gpp(NH)p, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, inhibits (3H)WB-4101 binding at 3 nM concentration of the radioligand, the ligand concentration labelling the lower affinity, nM, binding site. Secondly, the addition of Gpp(NH)p causes recovery of the heterogeneity of binding sites lost upon preincubation of the membranes with 100 microM epinephrine, apparently by decreasing the affinity of the nM (3H)WB-4101 binding site for the adrenergic receptors. The phenomenon was still observed in the presence of saturating concentrations of the alpha-2 antagonist, yohimbine, and the beta antagonist, propranolol. The results imply that Gpp(NH)p regulates ligand binding to hippocampal alpha-1 agonist sites. It is likely that agonist and antagonist binding sites for the alpha-1 receptor exist in hippocampus with the agonist site being modulated by serotonin.", 
    "13": "14 hypertensive men with type II diabetes sequentially received, in random order, hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg twice a day, propranolol 80 mg twice a day, and both drugs in combination. The 3-week treatment periods were separated by a 1-week washout period. Hydrochlorothiazide significantly increased fasting glucose by 31% (p less than 0.05) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) by 6.0% (p less than 0.10). A similar treatment period of propranolol 80 mg twice a day caused no significant increases. However, when both drugs were taken in combination, fasting glucose rose by 56% and HbA1c by 14.7% (p less than 0.01). The hyperglycaemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide and its potentiation by propranolol were independent of serum potassium and of endogenous insulin secretion as measured by urine C-peptide excretion. The combination of hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol thus seems to cause serious disturbances in glycaemic control in type II diabetics by mechanisms independent of insulin secretion.", 
    "14": "In a double-masked, randomized, comparison titration study to determine the effective dose of topically applied levobunolol, three concentrations of levobunolol (0.25%, 0.5%, and 1%) and of timolol (0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5%) were evaluated in patients with mild open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Following a washout of ocular hypotensive medication, twice-daily treatment in both eyes was initiated with the lowest of the three doses of either drug. The concentration was increased if intraocular pressure remained uncontrolled. Intraocular pressure was controlled in 63% (15 of 24) of the patients tested with the lowest concentration of levobunolol and 69% (18 of 26) with the lowest concentration of timolol. Overall, 75% (18 of 24) of the patients in the levobunolol group and 73% (19 of 26) of the patients in the timolol group had adequately controlled intraocular pressure. At the lowest concentrations tested, mean decreases from baseline in intraocular pressure ranged from 6 to 8 mm Hg in both treatment groups.", 
    "15": "A group of 162 patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were treated twice daily for up to 15 months with one of the following topical ophthalmic solutions: 0.5% levobunolol, 1% levobunolol, or 0.5% timolol. Overall mean reductions in intraocular pressure were 8 mm Hg for patients receiving 0.5% levobunolol or timolol and 8.2 mm Hg for patients receiving 1% levobunolol. There were no significant differences between levobunolol and timolol in mean reductions in intraocular pressure, percent of patients with adequately controlled intraocular pressure, or life-table estimates of the probability of successful treatment.", 
    "16": "On intact human lymphocytes a specific binding site (BS) for 125I-Cyanopindolol (125I-CYP), a derivative of the beta-blocking drug pindolol, was characterized. Inhibition of binding for catecholamines in the following order of potency: l-isoprenaline greater than l-adrenaline greater than l-noradrenaline proves the BS as a beta 2-receptor subtype. In 77 healthy persons (36 females, 41 males) the number of BS amounted to 2,639 +/- 125 BS/cell without any significant correlation to age (17-86 years) or sex. The dissociation constant (KD) indicating the affinity of iodocyanopindolol to the BS on intact lymphocytes was KD = 1.9 +/- 1.1 X 10(-10) M. A change of the number of beta-adrenergic receptors on intact human lymphocytes has been measured previously in asthmatics and in the myocardium of patients with congestive heart failure. We investigated a possible change in the beta-receptors on lymphocytes by physical and mental activity (\"stress\") in physicians going about their daily routine work. Persons left alone in a hospital room reading or sleeping were defined as \"inactive controls\". The number of BS on intact lymphocytes was significantly higher in inactive persons at 8 a.m. (2,230 +/- 482 BS) compared to active persons (1,743 +/- 285 BS; P less than 0.05) and at 1 p.m. (2,394 +/- 253 BS vs 1,733 +/- 556; P less than 0.05) but not different at 6 p.m. (1,634 +/- 578 BS vs 1,768 +/- 588 BS; P less than 0.1). The KD remained unchanged under all conditions. The serum noradrenaline and adrenaline levels were also measured during the day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "The effects of cyclic AMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, theophylline, isoproterenol and propranolol on mesaconitine (MA)-induced antinociception in mice were investigated employing the tail flick and acetic acid-induced writhing methods for the evaluation of antinociceptive activity. MA-induced antinociception was significantly potentiated by cyclic AMP and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline also significantly potentiated the MA-induced antinociception. Further, MA-induced antinociception was markedly increased by a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, and reduced by a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol. These results suggest that the antinociceptive action of MA is potentiated through cyclic AMP and stimulation of the central beta-adrenergic system.", 
    "18": "The characteristics of the binding of the hydrophilic beta-adrenergic antagonist [3H]CGP 12177 to intact rat adipocytes were studied at 37 degrees C and 6 degrees C. At both temperatures and at 90% saturation, the non-specific binding was less than 30% of the total binding. At 37 degrees C, specific [3H]CGP 12177 binding was rapid, reversible of high affinity (1.8 +/- 0.4 nM) and saturable. The number of specific binding sites per adipocyte increased with the fat cell size (about 35 000 and 115 000 sites per cell in adipocytes with diameters of 60 microns and 88 microns, respectively) but remained constant when expressed per unit fat cell surface area. Displacement of [3H]CGP 12177 bound to adipocytes by unselective and selective beta-antagonists was stereospecific, had the same characteristics as those found in adipocyte membranes and showed a heterogeneous specificity for beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic subtypes. In contrast, beta agonist competition curves, which modeled to two affinity-states of binding, showed high-affinity-state Kd values for agonists 10-25-times higher than those found in membranes under the same experimental conditions. At 6 degrees C, although the number and affinity of the specific binding sites for [3H]CGP 12177 were the same as those found at 37 degrees C, the Kd value for (-)-isoproterenol binding to the high affinity state of these sites (3.0 +/- 0.5 nM) was 25-times lower than at 37 degrees C and similar to the value found in membrane preparations (1.5-4 nM). These results show that the [3H]CGP 12177 specific binding sites detected on intact adipocytes represent the physiological beta-adrenergic receptors. Moreover, this study extends to the adipocyte the validity of the model recently proposed for other cell lines, according to which in intact cells, but not in membranes, agonist-binding promotes a rapid and temperature-dependent conformational change of the beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to a progressive loss of capacity of agonists to form a high-affinity complex.", 
    "19": "Increasing dosages of two potent diuretic agents (5, 10, 20 mg metolazone or 40, 80, 160 mg furosemide) were compared in 35 patients with hypertension and chronic renal failure. In cases with insufficient blood pressure control, 10 mg pindolol was given as a second drug. Finally, patients not responding to a betablocker-diuretic combination received 100 mg hydralazine as a third drug. Both diuretics had comparable antihypertensive potency during a treatment period of up to 12 weeks. Maximal antihypertensive response was observed under 10 mg metolazone or 160 mg furosemide. However, only in 25% of our patients blood pressure was normalized with diuretic monotherapy (metolazone or furosemide). The remaining cases needed either an additional betablocker or a combination of three different antihypertensive agents. Under these conditions a substantial proportion of our patients (20%) did not reach the therapeutic goal (diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg). These results document the difficulties of hypertension management in chronic renal failure. An early change to the stepped-care approach should be made in all cases with insufficient blood pressure response to potent diuretics.", 
    "20": "Treatment of rat cerebral cortical membranes with phospholipase A2 affects, in a parallel fashion, beta-, alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor binding, but not the affinity of these receptors for their respective ligands. Pretreatment of membranes with 0.1 percent glutaraldehyde blocks the effects of phospholipase A2 on adrenergic receptor binding. The results support the hypothesis that desensitization or \"masking\" of adrenergic receptors may involve changes in membrane lipid composition. Furthermore, glutaraldehyde may prove a useful tool in the investigation of the dynamic roles of lipids in receptor function and more specifically, their regulation and coupling to physiological events.", 
    "21": "A new chemical affinity label for the beta-adrenergic receptor, based on the structure of pindolol, has been synthesized and iodinated with 125I. The compound, N-bromoacetylamino-cyanopindolol (BAM-CYP), has an apparent dissociation constant of 44 +/- 7 pM towards the turkey erythrocyte membranes. This compound blocks irreversibly both the ability of beta-adrenergic receptors to bind 125I-cyanopindolol and the ability of beta-receptors to activate adenylate cyclase in the presence of beta-agonists. Furthermore, the irreversible binding of BAM-CYP to half of the beta-receptor sites abolishes the ligand binding activity of all the sites. These findings suggest that the beta-receptor is oligomeric in its native state. Although 125I-BAM-CYP blocks irreversibly and specifically the beta-adrenergic receptor, it does so by labeling a non-protein component, most probably a water-soluble lipid. The labeling is stereospecific since it is prevented by l-propranolol and not by d-propranolol. It is suggested that this lipid is tightly associated with the receptor in close proximity to the binding site. It is also suggested that this water-soluble lipid fraction may prove crucial for the optimal interaction between the beta-adrenergic receptor and the components of adenylate cyclase.", 
    "22": "The interaction of gallopamil (Procorum) and propranolol was studied in conscious trained dogs by injecting gallopamil intravenously (consecutive injection of 0.0464, 0.1 and 0.215 mg/kg at 30-min intervals) with and without propranolol pre-medication (0.464 mg/kg i.v., 10 min before the first injection of gallopamil). An intraindividual comparison of the cardiovascular effects was made. The interaction was mostly minor and occurred only with the highest dose of gallopamil. It was noticeable most in the influence on myocardial contractility which was more pronounced than the influence on electrophysiological parameters. A shift in threshold doses was not observed. Much more pronounced effects of the gallopamil-propranolol interaction become apparent when the animals were at the same time subjected to vagal blockade (methylatropine). In this situation, combined administration of gallopamil and propranolol led to a greater reduction of contractility, increase of AV block and occurrence of asystole. As regards the latter, a shift in the threshold dose occurred. The differences in the intensity of the interaction between gallopamil and propranolol in animals with or without vagal blockade are therefore a consequence of the presence or absence of reflex regulation. The findings explain, and relativize, the clear-cut interaction in the anaesthetized dog demonstrated by other authors, i.e. experimental conditions matching an autonomic blockade.", 
    "23": "The study involved 13 patients with primary hypertension who exercised on a bicycle ergometer with intensity increasing up to submaximum level. The exercise was carried out in four stages: before treatment (1st study), following one week treatment with 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide daily (2nd study), after one week treatment with the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide and 120 mg binazine daily (3rd study), and after one week treatment with hydrochlorothiazide and binazine, and 60 mg of propranolol daily (4th study). Using the approach of Weissler et al., left ventricular systolic time intervals were analysed at rest, after exercise and up to the 90th minute of restitution. Hydrochlorothiazide and binazine treatment decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the total electromechanical systolic time index (QS2I) and the left ventricular ejection time index (LVETI), and increased the PEP/LVET index at rest and after exercise. Addition of propranolol did not augment the hypotensive effect, while the left ventricular systolic time intervals returned to the values observed before treatment.", 
    "24": "The systemic effects of timolol eye drops were investigated in 35 patients divided into three groups: 1. (15 asthmatics); 2. (10 non-asthmatic patients suffering from glaucoma); 3. (10 elderly control subjects). A placebo eye drops was given at time 0, the timolol maleate drops were given at time 30 mn. The control parameters were checked every 15 minutes. They did not show variations under placebo. After administration of timolol, systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as vital capacity remained unchanged. Heart rate decreased in 91% of subjects by a mean: 18.5% and, extreme 38%: Bradycardia was always sino-atrial and there was a dose effect relationship. Also F.E.V., decreased in 13 of the 15 asthmatics and in 2 patients with chronic bronchitis: in 4 patients the decrease in flow exceeded 20%. The importance of timolol in the treatment of open-angle chronic glaucoma is well-established, but the results reported here and else where emphazing frequent risks should induce prescribers to comply with the rules of good use: analysis of previous history, and compliance with general contra-indications to beta blockers.

Patients have been divided into two groups: group A: 58 eyes treated for at least three years by timolol associated or not with an other treatment: medical, surgical or physical (laser); group B: 44 eyes divided into two sub-groups: group B1: 44 eyes, all having for at least three years a therapy for glaucoma (medical or surgical), other than timolol; group B2: 44 eyes, same population as in group B1 but where timolol as been introduced in the therapy. Perimetric follow-up was performed for all patients by the Friedmann analyser with a calculation for each eye of the total visual capability (TVC). For each eye, a linear relation according to time TVC/IOP has been established so that we could make a comparison of the evolution gradient of visual capabilities with time. It is a retrospective study. It showed that introduction of timolol in the therapy straightened the evolutive slope (severity gradient) of the Friedmann visual capabilities. But, this favorable action is only transient and only lasted three years on the average. In any event, whatever therapy is envisaged, even with rigourous follow-up, the visual field loss progresses inexorably with in the glaucomatous diseases.", 
    "26": "Recently a medical treatment with propranolol has been proposed in order to decrease portal pressure and lessen the risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. No data are available about another beta-blocker, nadolol, which, unlike propranolol, has a low hepatic metabolism, a low lipid solubility, a long serum half-life and does not reduce renal blood flow in patients with arterial hypertension. In 18 cirrhotics with portal hypertension, the effects of nadolol were studied on systemic and hepatic haemodynamics and liver function, at a dosage which reduced the heart rate by 25%. After one month of treatment, a significant decrease in cardiac output, portohepatic gradient and estimated hepatic blood flow were found. The degree of oesophageal varices was reduced in 11 patients, unchanged in the other seven. Hepatic function, evaluated by galactose eliminating capacity, did not change significantly. Although the small number of treated patients does not allow definitive conclusions, nadolol seems to have the features needed to be used in the medical treatment of portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis.", 
    "27": "The plasma levels and urinary excretion of carteolol and its main metabolites 8-hydroxycarteolol and carteolol glucuronide were investigated in 6 healthy subjects and 9 patients with varying degrees of renal impairment following a single oral dose of 30 mg carteolol hydrochloride. In healthy subjects the half-life of carteolol was 7.1 h. 63% of the administered dose was recovered unchanged in urine, and in all 84% was excreted by the kidneys. The renal clearance of carteolol was 255 ml/min. In chronic renal failure (CRF) the terminal half-life was increased to a maximum of 41 h. Both the elimination rate constant and renal clearance were closely related to the creatinine clearance. In CRF the recovery of carteolol and its metabolites from urine was considerably reduced, suggesting that another pathway of drug elimination becomes relevant in renal disease. To avoid an increase in side-effects due to drug accumulation, the dosage of carteolol should be adjusted in relation to the reduction in creatinine clearance. The maintenance dose should be reduced to a half in patients with a creatinine clearance below 40 ml/min and above 10 ml/min. In those with a creatinine clearance of 10 ml/min or less, the dose should be reduced to 1/4.", 
    "28": "Liver injuries following application of dihydralazine in 14 patients, ten of them with the typical pattern of perivenous liver cell necrosis, are reported. The other 4 patients, all having been exposed to additional hepatotoxic substances, histologically showed mixed patterns of tissue injury in liver biopsy. Moreover, in 6 of 14 patients there were diseases in the upper abdomen and/or metabolic disorders as well as an exposition to chemical hepatotoxic substances, or an additional application of potential hepatotoxic drugs. 9 of 14 patients had been treated with propranolol and dihydralazine simultaneously. One female patient showed the typical morphologic pattern of 'dihydralazine-damage' after application of propranolol only. In 3 cases with reexposition of dihydralazine merely one of them developed the typical histological behaviour documented in the literature. Distinct fibrosis of the liver remained in 2 cases. Consequently, to the hitherto existing pathogenetic concept of dihydralazine-caused liver injury as a metabolic-toxic-allergic one, there is to be added the new aspect of summing up of the actions of various additional noxious agents.", 
    "29": "Blood plasma and myocardial total lipids (TL), cholesterol (Ch), triglycerides (TGL), phospholipids (PhL), as well as plasma free fatty acids (FFA) were studied in 56 male rabbits with experimental thyrotoxic myocardial hypertrophy, induced by Thyreotom (group T14-14 days, T45-45 days). Combinations with Trasicor (TT-14 days) and aminooxyacetic acid (TAOAA-14 days) were also applied. The data showed a significantly lower plasma Ch and TL levels both in T14 and T45 as compared to the control group. The myocardial levels of TGL both in T14 and T45 were significantly higher than in the control group. In the TT group, myocardial Ch tended to decrease. A considerable decrease in plasma and myocardial lipids was found in the TAOAA group. Treatment with Thyreotom with or without Trasicor or AOAA resulted in a decrease of polyunsaturated FA, which was most expressed in the TT group. The combinations with Trasicor and AOAA had a protective effect on thyrotoxic disturbances.", 
    "30": "After oral administration of [14C]-labelled 3,4-dihydro-8-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino)propoxy-3-nitroxy-2H-1-b enzopyran (nipradilol, NP, K-351) to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at doses of 3 and 30 mg/kg, the blood levels of radioactivity reached a peak at 1 h (197 and 1972 ng eq. NP/ml, respectively), whereas unchanged NP levels showed a peak at 30 min and Cmax values at both doses indicated a great difference (70-fold) in comparison with the dose ratio. Most of the radioactivity was excreted in urine and feces up to 72 h after administration. Large amounts of unchanged NP were distributed in the heart, aorta and vein which were considered to be target organs of NP. The half-lives of NP in those tissues, as well as in the blood, were short. The level of NP in the liver was low in comparison with the blood level. No significantly different levels of NP and its metabolites between SHR and normotensive rats were seen, except that the free type of 5-OH-DN was higher in the liver and urine in SHR.", 
    "31": "This study presents a case of beta-blocker intoxication due to massive overdose of metoprolol (7.5 g). Prenalterol in a dose of 420 mg was given as antidote, in combination with epinephrine in intermittent doses. Resuscitation was performed during 4 hours because of mechanical asystole. The patient regained health in 24 hours after further repeated doses of 30 mg prenalterol. Prenalterol is valuable in the management of toxic doses of beta-blocking drugs, and a titration to extremely high doses of prenalterol might be necessary.", 
    "32": "In contrast to all commonly observed myocardial disorders presenting more or less pronounced hypertrophy in the sense of an adaptation to increased work load, the hypertrophic process in hypertrophic cardiomyopathies is characterized by the unknown etiology and pathogenesis (no adaptation), by the non homogeneous gross anatomic and microscopic picture, by the problems in measuring the muscle mass, by a non dilating ventricular cavity during follow-up, by the lack of experimental models in animals, and by concealed myocardial storage diseases. Methods for the investigation of the regression of hypertrophy include echocardiography, angiocardiography, ECG and myocardial biopsy. The studies are based on changes of hypertrophy in the natural course and after the application of propranolol, verapamil and surgical management respectively. According to previous available results regression of cardiac hypertrophy could not be proved either during the natural course nor after medical or surgical treatment. The data indicate that clinical and hemodynamic improvements observed after therapeutic interventions are not induced by global or regional decrease of myocardial mass. They may be a consequence of systolic and diastolic improvement of ventricular function, which apparently is independent of regression of cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "33": "A case of prolonged Q-T interval syndrome without deafness (Romano-Ward syndrome) is reported. A 2-month-old female was seen in consultation because of a near-miss event (syncopal attack). An EKG showed a long Q-T interval. Successful therapy was achieved with propanolol.", 
    "34": "We report three clinical cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension with favorable evolution. The treatment of this poorly-understood affection is still only symptomatic. Through the literature, we review the different physiopathological hypotheses proposed, among which the faultly resorption of C S F predominates. By analogy with the physiopathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma, we have treated these patients with beta-blocking agents.", 
    "35": "A procedure for the determination of the activation state of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-PK) in the cytosolic fraction of dog myocardium was derived from existing assays of this enzyme in tissues, a new element being the absence of added sodium chloride throughout the procedure. About 2/3 of the total cAMP-PK in normal dog ventricular myocardium was found to be present in the cytosolic (supernatant) fraction, the remaining 1/3 being particle-bound. The isoenzyme profile in the cytosolic fraction as determined by DEAE-cellulose chromatography revealed the presence of nearly equal amounts of the type I and type II isoenzymes. This distribution was also evident in experiments in which the RI and RII regulatory subunits were photoaffinity labeled with 8-azido- [32P] cAMP. Ligation of the left circumflex coronary artery in anesthetized open-chest dogs kept under artificial respiration caused increases in the cAMP-PK activity ratio (-cAMP/+cAMP) from a control value of 0.11 to 0.26 and 0.22, respectively, in the ischemic and in a nonischemic area of the left ventricle. This effect was clearly evident 2 min after ligation and was still observable in the ischemic area after 20 min. It was associated with increases in cAMP levels and in the activity ratio (-5' -AMP/+5' -AMP) of glycogen phosphorylase in the ventricular tissues. Pretreatment of the dogs with (+/-)-propranolol (2 mg/kg) abolished the cAMP and cAMP-PK responses, while the phosphorylase activity ratio remained elevated.", 
    "36": "It has been found empirically that either average or minimum steady-state plasma concentrations (Css) of drugs obeying Michaelis-Menten elimination kinetics give essentially linear plots on semilogarithmic graph paper when Css is plotted versus the maintenance dose (D) or dose rate (R). The equations of such straight lines may be converted to the following nonlinear equation: Css = abD which fits the Css,D data essentially as well as D = VmCss/(Km + Css). The parameter b is analogous to unity plus the interest fraction in logarithmic growth or compound interest calculations, and each drug appears to have a characteristic value of this parameter, with extremely small intersubject variation. From the above equation the following equation, Dn+1 = Dn + 1n(Cn+1/Cn)1n b can be derived, which forms the basis of predicting the needed dosage, Dn+1, to obtain a desired steady-state concentration, Cn+1, using one initial steady-state concentration, Cn, obtained with dose, Dn, and using a population value of b for the drug. It appears that it is the value of the \"initial capital\" (i.e., a in relation to the initial dose) rather than the \"interest fraction\" (i.e., b - 1) that causes most of the intersubject variation in Css of a given drug. Several drugs illustrate the usefulness of the method. A semilogarithmic plot also appears to be an excellent method to distinguish simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics from parallel Michaelis-Menten and first order elimination kinetics and from simple first order kinetics with steady-state data in the range 0.3-3 Km.", 
    "37": "A total of 64 patients with coronary heart disease were examined using contrast coronaro-ventriculography, veloergometry and estimation of the lactic acid level in the coronary sinus blood. Fifty-seven patients were referred to obsidan therapy by the \"blind\" method. Two groups of patients with asynergies of ischemic and cicatricial genesis were singled out. The sensitivity of the ST segment depression and sigma R increment as objective signs of ischemia significantly reduced in the presence of postinfarction cardiosclerosis. Obsidan monotherapy caused a rise of load power and volume of work performed in the patients with asynergies of ischemic origin: an antianginal effect of the drug in such cases was comparable to that in the patients without disturbed myocardial regional cantractility.", 
    "38": "Renal arterial infusion of acetylcholine (ACh) in control dogs produced a natriuresis and diuresis and an increase in renal plasma flow (RPF) without a change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or in renin secretory rate (RSR). In dogs pretreated with indomethacin (Indo), an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase, renal arterial infusion of ACh first produced a rise, then a decline in urine flow, sodium excretion (UNaV) and GFR that was accompanied by a progressive fall in RPF and a progressive rise in RSR. The rise in RSR was potentiated by renal arterial infusion of an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker, phenoxybenzamine (Phenoxy), and attenuated, but not completely abolished, by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol (Prop). Chemical denervation with reserpine alone, or in combination with chronic surgical renal denervation, failed to prevent the fall in RPF, GFR and UNaV and the rise in RSR produced by ACh in Indo-treated dogs. Renal arterial infusion of Phenoxy and intravenous infusion of Prop, alone or in combination with renal arterial infusion of an angiotensin II antagonist, saralasin, failed to maintain the vasodilatory, diuretic and natriuretic effects of ACh in Indo-treated dogs. Elimination of endogenous vasopressin by hypophysectomy also failed to prevent the vasoconstriction induced by ACh in Indo-treated dogs. The results suggest that ACh produced renal vasoconstriction in Indo-treated dogs by mechanism(s) other than an increase in renal adrenergetic activity or an increase in the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. The results also suggest that the vasoconstriction was independent of vasopresin.", 
    "39": "Five healthy male volunteers ingested 40 mg of propranolol in the morning and the blood plasma was analyzed at various intervals by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. In addition to propranolol, its metabolites 4-OH propranolol, 4-OH propranolol glucuronide and propranolol glucuronide, were found in the plasma. The plasma concentrations of these substances reached maximum levels 2-3 hours after propranolol ingestion. The ratio of propranolol over 4-OH propranolol, (U), and also the ratio of propranolol plus propranolol glucuronide over 4-OH propranolol plus 4-OH propranolol glucuronide (U + G), were calculated. The area under the concentration-time curves (AUC) of these compounds were calculated over 8 hours and the AUC0-8 hr ratios were computed for both (U) and (U + G). The AUC0-8 hr ratio was, in both (U) and (U + G) ratios, linearly correlated with the ratio obtained 2 hours after the propranolol ingestion. Accordingly, the 2-hour values of the (U) or (U + G) ratios were thought to represent the metabolic ratio of the propranolol hydroxylation, and the distribution of these ratios was examined in 162 healthy young male volunteers. Based on the null hypothesis theory, 4 out of the 162 volunteers (2.5%) were judged as poor metabolizers of the debrisoquine-type, ie, hydroxylation of propranolol. The pulse rate, systolic blood pressure and intraocular pressure decreased after propranolol ingestion, the maximum effects being at 2-3 hours after the ingestion. No significant effect was found on the diastolic blood pressure. In the subjects with poor propranolol metabolism, the pharmacological effects of propranolol did not differ significantly from those in other subjects.", 
    "40": "Platelet adhesion was studied in whole blood using a simple stagnation flow method in patients at high risk for the development of atherosclerosis. Fourteen patients with hypercholesterolemia, 26 with hypertriglyceridemia and 25 normolipidemic hypertensive subjects were compared with 75 normal (normotensive and normolipidemic) subjects. Increased platelet adhesion was found in hypercholesterolemic (but not hypertriglyceridemic) patients only when native blood with no anticoagulants was used. In hypertensive patients, platelet adhesion was significantly elevated, but remarkably reduced by beta-blocker drugs. Propranolol and atenolol significantly reduced platelet adhesion, but this effect was found to take a longer time than that required for significant blood pressure reduction.", 
    "41": "The pharmacokinetics of penbutolol, its 4-hydroxylated metabolite and of their conjugates was studied in hypertensive patients with various degrees of renal impairment. A single oral dose of penbutolol 40 mg, was rapidly absorbed after a lag-time of 0.34 h. Its plasma concentration reached a maximum after 0.84 h and then declined bi-exponentially, with an apparent elimination half-life of 21.8 h. The hydroxylation of penbutolol was negligible and conjugation was of major importance for its elimination. Consequently, the kinetics of unchanged penbutolol were not altered by renal impairment. The 48 h-urinary excretion of penbutolol and its metabolites reached 13-14% of the administered dose, which is consistent with extensive metabolism of the drug. After treatment for 30 days with penbutolol 40 mg/d there was no accumulation of the parent drug but the concentration of its conjugates was increased. It is concluded that the dose of penbutolol need not be changed in patients with mild renal insufficiency, 4-hydroxypenbutolol is unlikely to participate in the anti-hypertensive effect of the drug, due to its low concentrations, and biotransformation of penbutolol may be enhanced during chronic treatment.", 
    "42": "Male Broad Breasted White Turkeys (BBWT) are naturally hypertensive and prone to develop atherosclerosis. Hypertension is characterized by high levels of circulating and tissue catecholamines; atherosclerosis affects mainly the aorto-iliac tract. To evaluate the effect of a beta-blocker on both hypertension and atherosclerosis, 2 groups of BBWT were studied. First group: 12 BBWT treated from the 8th week of age with daily p.o. placebo; second group: 6BBWT treated from the 8th week with 2 mg/kg p.o. daily oxprenolol. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were periodically measured with an indirect method. Seven and 5 BBWT of the first group were sacrificed at 24 and 51 weeks respectively. The 6 animals of the second group were sacrificed at 51 weeks. No significant difference in mean BP and HR values was found between the two groups of animals. On the contrary the oxprenolol treated group displayed a significant reduction in extent and severity of the atherosclerotic lesions. These results seem to substantiate that oxprenolol might positively interfere with the setting of atherosclerosis in these animals independently of BP reduction. One possible explanation could be a direct effect of oxprenolol on the arterial wall.", 
    "43": "The concentration of ionic calcium (Ca2+ in the smooth muscular cells of the resistance vessels is a determining factor of their contraction. It depends on the influx of Ca2+ to the interior of the cells through the calcium channels in the sarcolemma. The effect of a specific Ca2+-channel blocking agent - nifedipine - on arterial hypertension in a group of 18 patients with chronic renal hypertension is reported in this study. The combination of nifedipine and propranolol in the control of hypertension in 6 of these patients in a long-term follow-up was also studied. It was concluded: (1) Ca2+ blockade had a rapid and powerful antihypertensive effect in all patients; (2) the antihypertensive effect was higher with high initial blood pressure levels; this fact was especially evident and appeared particularly useful in hypertensive emergencies; (3) in some patients, the action of nifedipine was dose-dependent; (4) nifedipine had a short-lived action; (5) the combination nifedipine-propranolol was efficient in the long-term control of hypertension.", 
    "44": "Time courses of heart rate (HR), arterial pressure (AP), and head movement at the beginning of eating were analyzed in conscious cats. The cats were trained to eat when movements of their body trunks were restrained. Food was presented for 10 sec at intervals of 100 sec. With the abrupt presentation of food, a head-down movement occurred immediately and thereafter eating started with a mean latency of 1.6 sec. During eating HR increased by 22% from the preeating value and AP was elevated by 11%. To determine the time relation between the onset of eating and the change in each variable in response to eating, mean time courses of HR, AP, and head movement were obtained from 7-40 trials in each cat. The head-down movement preceded the onset of eating by 1.3 sec. The increase in HR preceded the onset of eating by 0.2 sec; the change in AP followed it by 3-4 sec. This indicated that the increase in HR was not induced reflexly either by food intake or by the change in AP. After administration of hexamethonium, the changes in HR and AP in response to eating were abolished, although eating was evoked by the food presentation. Additionally, the increase in HR was also reduced by propranolol and atropine. Thus, the acceleration of HR at the beginning of eating may be induced by central activation of the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "45": "Overfeeding normal volunteers with either carbohydrate or a mixture of supplements for 20 days increased resting metabolic rate, but most of the excess energy was retained. There was no significant increase in urinary VMA or catecholamine excretion or plasma catecholamine concentrations during overfeeding, suggesting that there was no diffuse activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Overfeeding did not enhance the thermogenic response to norepinephrine infusion, suggesting that the increase in resting metabolic rate during overfeeding in man is not mediated by increased sensitivity to norepinephrine or by hypertrophy of brown fat. Propranolol slightly reduced postprandial resting metabolic rate during overfeeding is not mediated by increased sympathetic nervous system activity. These data are not consistent with the hypothesis that the sympathetic nervous system regulates dietary thermogenesis in man.", 
    "46": "The effects of various doses of salbutamol, d-amphetamine and d-fenfluramine were studied on sucrose intake by freely-fed rats. All the drugs reduced sucrose consumption dose-dependently. Bilateral electrolytic lesions in the ventral noradrenergic bundle, which deplete hypothalamic noradrenaline, antagonized the effect of 1.25 mg/kg d-amphetamine on sucrose intake. A dose of 2.5 mg/kg d, 1-propranolol, a beta adrenergic blocker, prevented the effect of 10 mg/kg salbutamol but the dose of 5 mg/kg did not significantly change the effect of 0.6 or 1.25 mg/kg d-amphetamine. Captopril (35 mg/kg) reduced salbutamol's effect on water intake, but not on sucrose intake. Metergoline, 1 mg/kg, a central serotonin antagonist, but not xylamidine 2 mg/kg, a 5HT antagonist with limited access to the brain, counteracted the effect of 2.5 mg/kg d-fenfluramine on sucrose intake. These findings suggest a role for serotoninergic and adrenergic mechanisms in inhibiting ingestive behaviour maintained mainly by taste.", 
    "47": "The changes in some parameters of plasma lipoprotein metabolism in 25 hypertensive men, caused by a two months lasting oral treatment with 120 mg propranolol/day, were compared to the changes that occur during the same time in the subjects (n = 9) of an untreated control group. Propranolol led to an increase of triglycerides and a decrease of HDL cholesterol in plasma, the latter consisting in a small increase of unesterified cholesterol and a larger decrease of cholesteryl esters. In parallel a decrease in the lecithin:cholesterol acyl transfer, measured as initial rate of cholesterol esterification, was observed. The extent of the plasma lipid and enzyme alterations was shown to be dependent on the patient's pretreatment situation. Changes in lecithin:cholesterol acyl transfer rate after oral treatment correlated significantly with similar changes after propranolol addition in comparable amounts to plasma in vitro. A similarity between propranolol induced alterations in the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins and the situation in hereditary LCAT deficiency is obvious and may be interpreted as a harmful component of propranolol action.", 
    "48": "Diltiazem and propranolol alone and in combination as antianginal agents were compared with placebo in 12 patients with stable exertional angina at Stanford University Medical Center. The patients performed symptom-limited, multi-stage upright bicycle ergometric exercise while undergoing radionuclide angiographic studies every two weeks while being treated with 90 mg of diltiazem four times daily, 60 mg of propranolol four times daily, a combination of 90 mg of diltiazem and 60 mg of propranolol four times daily, and placebo. Diltiazem, propranolol and a combination all significantly increased exercise duration compared to placebo (526 +/- 149, 525 +/- 115, and 549 +/- 129 vs 430 +/- 132 sec.). Although rate pressure product and heart rate decreased with diltiazem therapy at submaximal workloads, these values were unchanged at peak exercise in contrast to propranolol or the combination of propranolol or diltiazem. Diltiazem decreased the sub-maximal and maximal degree of exercise-induced ST segment depression by over 50% compared to placebo (P less than 0.01 vs placebo). Diltiazem resulted in a higher exercise left ventricular ejection fraction compared to placebo, propranolol or the combination of diltiazem or propranolol (all less than P less than 0.05). Sinus bradycardia or orthostatic hypertension occurred in four patients on the high-dose combination therapy and required dose reduction. We concluded that high-dose diltiazem, appeared to be even more effective than moderate-dose propranolol or the combination of diltiazem and propranolol in improving exercise tolerance, electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischaemia and left ventricular function in patients with stable effort angina due to occlusive coronary artery disease.", 
    "49": "Diltiazem can be effective monotherapy for most patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. The exact mechanism(s) of action of diltiazem for producing a salutary effect in patients with angina pectoris is unknown, but probably involves a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand and an increase in supply via coronary artery dilatation. Administration of less than or equal to 240 mg/day in divided doses uncommonly produces any side effects. Doses of 360 mg/day may be required in some patients. The major adverse effect of high dose therapy is mild pedal oedema. Caution concerning orthostatic hypotension is advised when high dose diltiazem is combined with nitrate therapy or used in patients with poor left ventricular function. Also, diltiazem may potentiate bradycardia or atrio-ventricular block, especially when combined with digitalis preparations or beta-blockers. However, in patients with severe angina, diltiazem may be additive to nitrate and/or beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "50": "Propranolol decreases portal venous pressure in patients with cirrhosis but no method is available in man to study the effect of this beta-blocker on splanchnic organ blood flow. Because in rats, the microsphere method allows evaluation of regional blood flow, the acute effect of propranolol on both splanchnic and systemic circulations was studied in normal rats and in rats with portal hypertension due to portal vein stenosis. Portal venous pressure significantly decreased during propranolol administration in normal (5.6 +/- 1.0-4.7 +/- 1.1 mm Hg; mean +/- SD) as well as in portal hypertensive rats (11.7 +/- 2.3-10.3 +/- 1.8 mm Hg). Propranolol slightly decreased cardiac output and arterial pressure in all rats. Portal tributary blood flow was significantly reduced by propranolol in normal rats (17.4 +/- 3.0-11.3 +/- 2.2 ml/min) and in portal hypertensive rats (23.7 +/- 5.0-16.6 +/- 3.3 ml/min). Accordingly vascular resistance of the different organs in the portal venous territory increased in these rats receiving propranolol. The percentage of the decrease in portal tributary blood flow was significantly more marked than the percentage of reduction in cardiac output in portal hypertensive rats but, in normal rats, these percentages were parallel. Hepatic arterial blood flow did not change or slightly increased and, consequently, hepatic arterial vascular resistance decreased. These findings further clarify the marked effects of propranolol on splanchnic circulation.", 
    "51": "The splanchnic and systemic haemodynamic effects of mepindolol (0.6 mg, IV), a beta-blocker with a marked beta 2-blockade activity and propranolol (15 mg, IV) were studied in two groups of eight patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis. Similar decreases in the hepatic venous pressure gradient were observed after mepindolol and propranolol, whereas hepatic blood flow significantly decreased after mepindolol but did not significantly do so after propranolol. The decreases in cardiac output and heart rate were statistically significant and similar after mepindolol and propranolol. Mepindolol slightly decreased mean arterial pressure and propranolol slightly increased this pressure. Both beta-blockers significantly increased systemic vascular resistance. From these observations, it was not possible to demonstrate that mepindolol offered a beneficial effect on splanchnic haemodynamics in patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis.", 
    "52": "Abrupt withdrawal of the centrally-acting antihypertensive agent, clonidine, is associated with a high incidence of rebound hypertension and tachycardia, with symptoms of sympathetic overactivity and increased catecholamine excretion. Gradual clonidine withdrawal has been recommended, but does not always avoid the reaction. A regimen is described comprising high doses of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, the cardioselective beta-blocker, atenolol, and chlordiazepoxide, specifically designed to counter both central and peripheral effects of sudden withdrawal of a central alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist. This combination was completely successful in preventing the haemodynamic and symptomatic features of clonidine withdrawal in eight hypertensive patients.", 
    "53": "The effects of atenolol were investigated in car drivers participating in an amateur car rally. Atenolol or placebo were administered to two groups of 20 crews (driver and assistant) in this double-blind randomized trial. When compared with placebo, there was no deterioration in subjective appraisal of alertness and reaction ability in subjects given atenolol, and stress symptoms were markedly reduced. When compared with previous experience, the incidence of improved subjective appraisal of general driving ability was higher with atenolol (30 reports) than with placebo (5 reports). Furthermore the incidence of unchanged or worsened driving ability was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) with placebo (34 reports) than with atenolol (9 reports). At the end of the rally (16 hours after administration) subjects receiving atenolol 50 mg had significant reductions in heart rate (p less than 0.001), diastolic pressure (p less than 0.01), and systolic pressure (p less than 0.01) when compared with placebo.", 
    "54": "This randomized crossover out-patient study was designed to compare the antihypertensive effects of atenolol and pindolol. After a wash-out period of two weeks in pretreated cases, 107 patients with essential hypertension were given either atenolol 100 mg once-daily or pindolol 20 mg slow release (SR) once-daily. Both atenolol and pindolol lowered blood pressure over the 24 week period. The diastolic blood pressure reduction was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) with atenolol than with pindolol. Before beta-blocker therapy, many patients had already experienced side-effects such as fatigue, sleep disturbances and dreams. This probably relates to the high sensitivity of the analogue scale used to assess side-effects, and to the high incidence of such symptoms in untreated patients. As the study progressed there was a reduction in the frequency of fatigue (p less than 0.03) and dreams (p less than 0.05) in both groups, whereas sleep disturbances significantly increased under pindolol (p less than 0.05) but decreased under atenolol (p less than 0.05). The only important side-effect difference between the two beta-blockers was the higher incidence of sleep disturbances with pindolol which may be due to the higher lipophilicity of this beta-blocker.", 
    "55": "After a single 200 mg oral dose of metoprolol tartrate the mean metoprolol AUC was found to be six-fold higher in poor metabolizers (PMs) of debrisoquine than in extensive metabolizers (EMs). This was associated with impaired metabolic clearance via alpha-hydroxylation and O-dealkylation. A population study (n = 143) has shown a bimodal distribution in the ratio of metoprolol: alpha-hydroxymetoprolol recovered in urine which was correlated highly with the debrisoquine metabolic ratio. Nine per cent of the population were PMs. Plasma metoprolol concentrations three hours after a 100 mg oral dose of metoprolol were greater than 200 ng/ml in PMs but were lower than this in most EMs. This dose of metoprolol given once daily provided a clinically significant reduction (16%) in exercise heart rate in PMs after 24 hours. EMs require conventional doses (100 mg b.d.) to achieve the same degree of beta-blockade. Preliminary data from family studies support the view that the defect in metoprolol oxidation is inherited. In 12 hypertensive patients who were EMs we compared the beta-blocking activity and antihypertensive effect of chronic treatment with metoprolol 200 mg once daily (conventional and long-acting formulations), with those of atenolol 100 mg once daily and placebo. The effects of all active preparations were similar at 3.5 hours but atenolol was superior to all metoprolol formulations at 24 hours after dosing. It is concluded that for the majority of patients metoprolol should be prescribed twice daily when using currently available dosage forms. Relationships between oxidation phenotype and side-effects should be examined.", 
    "56": "Vivid and bizarre dreams, hallucinations, sleep disturbance and psychosis have all been described following treatment with beta-blockers. It has been suggested that these central nervous system (CNS) side-effects are related to the degree of lipophilicity of the beta-blocker. A randomized double-blind crossover study was performed to compare the incidence of CNS side-effects with atenolol and metoprolol in hypertensive patients who had reported CNS side-effects with lipophilic beta-blockers. Eleven women and six men completed the study, in which a 30-item psychiatric questionnaire was used to detect changes in psychological status and possible CNS side-effects. Discontinuation of the original lipophilic beta-blocker produced a significant improvement in quality of sleep, dreams, concentration, memory, energy, and anxiety. No significant CNS side-effects were reported with atenolol, but introduction of metoprolol caused a significant increase in the incidence of sleep disturbance (p less than 0.01) and restless nights (p less than 0.05), as well as failure to achieve satisfactory sexual intercourse (p less than 0.05). When compared with atenolol, metoprolol was associated with a significantly higher incidence of restless disturbed nights (p less than 0.05). Blood pressure control was identical for both beta-blockers. This study appears to confirm the association between CNS-related side-effects and the lipophilicity of beta-blockers.", 
    "57": "In a randomized double-blind prospective between-patients trial in patients presenting with primary anxiety, atenolol significantly improved mean values on the Hamilton rating scale at two and four weeks when compared with placebo. There was also a significant improvement in affective symptoms at 28 days for atenolol when compared with placebo.", 
    "58": "Additional side-effects of two beta-blockers, atenolol (hydrophilic) and metoprolol (lipophilic), were measured in 18 normal male volunteers in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. A saccadic eye movement reaction time (RT) task, a manual RT version of the Stroop Colour-Word Task, the Span of Apprehension Task, and the Continuous Performance Task were presented on a graphics display screen. Standard cognitive effects were replicated on all measures. Atenolol was noticeably, but not significantly, superior to metoprolol in visual alerting and in angular breadth of visual information processing, both with saccadic RT.", 
    "59": "In 72 outpatients with early stage disease and mild to moderate hypertension, metabolic parameters were evaluated before and during 6 years of treatment with two different thiazide diuretic-based antihypertensive therapy regimens. Compared to the untreated state, chronic diuretic treatment caused a persisting increase in serum lipids in men or postmenopausal women. The high incidence of electrocardiographic abnormalities indicative of ischemic changes suggests a possible negative influence of diuretic-induced metabolic alterations on coronary heart disease in these patients.", 
    "60": "The effects of labetalol on serum lipoproteins, the intravenous fat tolerance test (IVFTT) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) activities were studied in 16 patients with mild hypertension before and after 6 months of therapy. Most patients were found to be normotensive on 200 mg labetalol/day. Before therapy the mean concentration of serum TG was 0.75 +/- 0.21 (SD) mmol/l, of total cholesterol 5.41 +/- 1.25 mmol/l and of HDL cholesterol 1.67 +/- 0.61 mmol/l. After labetalol no significant changes were found in the concentrations of TG and cholesterol in the VLDL, LDL and HDL fractions. The mean values for the IVFTT and for LPL and HL activities were in the normal range and remained unchanged during therapy.", 
    "61": "The effect of blood collection devices on the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurement of propranolol was assessed. Blood was collected from hypertensive patients treated with propranolol for at least 7 days. Two venipunctures (opposite arm technique) were performed on each patient using the reference (syringe/silanized, ethylene diamintetraacetate tubes) procedure and the Vacutainer Brand Tubes (lavender-, royal blue-, green-, and red-stoppered) that were free of tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate. Propranolol concentrations were determined utilizing a published HPLC procedure. This study showed that in the four evacuated tubes, propranolol concentrations in serum or plasma were highly correlated to those of the reference procedure (correlation coefficients, 0.986 to 0.997; and slope, 0.912 to 1.013). Mean propranolol concentrations of the red-stoppered tube serum were lower (7.5%) than that of the reference syringe (0.01 less than p less than 0.05). Thus, lavender-, royal blue-, green-, and red-stoppered tubes would be acceptable for propranolol monitoring.", 
    "62": "14 phobic subjects were given propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin) and placebo in a double-blind fashion according to a repeated measurement design. Subjects were exposed to their source of fear while their anxiety and cardiovascular responses (heart rate, blood pressure and peripheral temperature) were recorded. In accordance with the Three-Systems Model of fear and phobias, the subjects were divided into two groups of high and low physiological reactors, operationalized by the cardiovascular items in their anxiety pattern from a revised version of the Autonomic Perception Questionnaire (APQ). It was found that beta-blockade had the predicted effect on heart rate and peripheral temperature while diastolic blood pressure was unaffected. The systolic blood pressure finally was lowered for the low cardiovascular reactors. The subjectively rated anxiety rose consistently during exposure. There was no general effect of the beta-blocking drugs on subjective anxiety. For the high cardiovascular reactors propranolol was associated with a higher anxiety level.", 
    "63": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that Mg++ prevents the electrophysiologic changes caused by hypoxia in cardiac cells. Canine right ventricular false tendons (32 hearts) were pinned to the floor of a tissue bath and suffused with physiologic solution. Microelectrodes recorded the spontaneous action potentials. The isolated tissue was exposed to a hypoxic solution (PO2 less than 50 mm Hg) containing either normal [Mg++] (0.85 mmol/l) or high [Mg++] (3.4 mmol/l). Hypoxia with normal [Mg++] caused increased firing rate (+40%), depolarization of the resting (maximum diastolic) potential (from-72 to -55 mV), and reduction in amplitude (from 88 to 76 mV). The depolarization, reduction in amplitude, and most of the increased firing rate were completely blocked when [Mg++] was elevated to 3.4 mmol/l; propranolol (10 mg/l) blocked the residual increase in firing rate.", 
    "64": "A case of hypermagnesemia associated with pheochromocytoma is described. A further increase in serum Mg was observed with initiation of beta-blocking therapy. Unilateral adrenalectomy normalized serum Mg levels.", 
    "65": "beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA) produced a contraction of the guinea-pig isolated lung parenchymal strip and bronchoconstriction of perfused lungs. Reserpine pretreatment had little effect on these responses indicating a substantial direct effect. Phentolamine (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) had minimal effect on PEA in the lung strip compared with that on noradrenaline, eliminating involvement of alpha-adrenoceptors. PEA was unaffected by atropine (10(-7)M) or a mepyramine (10(-7)M); metiamide (10(-4)M) mixture. The contraction was not therefore mediated via muscarinic or histaminergic receptors. 5-HT and dopamine receptors were also discounted. Possible stimulation of a phenylethylaminergic receptor and its relevance to bronchial asthma is discussed.", 
    "66": "The transfer of labetalol into human breast milk and amniotic fluid was studied in women with pregnancy hypertension. The women were treated with labetalol 600-1200 mg daily. The ratio between the areas under the milk and plasma concentration versus time curves varied between 0.8 and 2.6. No consistent relation between milk and plasma concentration in the mother was observed either within the individuals during a dose interval or between different individuals. One of the nursed infants at the end of the dose interval had a plasma labetalol in the same range as the mother, and in another infant the level was below the detection limit. Amniotic fluid concentrations 2-3 h after dosing were generally lower than in plasma.", 
    "67": "The efficacy and safety of a new slow-release formulation of nifedipine (\"Adalat Retard\") were assessed in a double-blind cross-over trial in 19 subjects with essential hypertension (14 male, 5 female--ages: 34-72 years), 14 of whom continued previous antihypertensive medication. There were two 6 week treatment phases in which nifedipine 20 mg twice daily and placebo tablets twice daily were administered in random order. Supine mean blood pressure was 115 +/- 2 mm Hg during the placebo phase and 105 +/- 2 mm Hg during the nifedipine phase (p less than 0.001); and standing mean blood pressure was 121 +/- 2 mm Hg after placebo and 110 +/- 2 mm Hg after nifedipine (p less than 0.001). The magnitude of the blood pressure difference between the two phases was not related either to age or to the placebo phase blood pressure. The hypotensive effect of nifedipine was observed when administered as a single agent or in combination with diuretic and/or beta blocker. Heart rate was increased after nifedipine--75 +/- 2 beats/minute compared with 71 +/- 2 beats/minute after placebo (p less than 0.01). In this dose nifedipine (as \"Adalat Retard\") is an effective hypotensive agent which is a useful addition to presently available therapy.", 
    "68": "In anesthetized spontaneously breathing dogs, brevetoxin caused dose-dependent periods of apnea and, at high doses, respiratory arrest. In artificially ventilated dogs, i.v. brevetoxin caused complex dose-related cardiovascular changes consisting of: (1) bradycardia; (2) triphasic blood pressure changes, sequentially characterized by depressor/pressor/depressor phases; (3) cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation; (4) muscle fasciculations. Prevention of bradycardia by atropine, vagotomy or ganglionic blockage unmasked a tachycardic action of the toxin. Ganglionic blockade, but not atropine or vagotomy, reduced the initial depressor effect of toxin. Phentolamine prevented the toxin-induced initial hypotension and secondary hypertension. Propranolol prevented the tachycardic and late depressor effects of toxin. In reserpinized dogs, low doses of toxin caused muscle fasciculations but none of the above cardiovascular effects; large doses caused bradycardia preventable by atropine, but not by vagotomy or chlorisondamine. These results suggest that brevetoxin: elicits the Bezold-Jarisch effect, i.e. initial hypotension, bradycardia and apnea; releases catecholamines, probably adrenal epinephrine, causing tachycardic, secondary pressor and late depressor effects; in large doses, releases vagal acetylcholine; -induced catecholamine and acetylcholine release is not nicotinic; produces effects, like those reported for veratridine, attributable to a common action on excitable membranes.", 
    "69": "The effects of pretreatment with metoprolol (2 mg/kg, i.v.), UK 38,485 (5 mg/kg, i.v.), and a combination of the two drugs were examined on early (0-0.5/hr) and late (0.5-4 hr) ischemic arrhythmias resulting from coronary artery ligation in the anesthetized rat. Metoprolol was administered at different times after the onset of ischemia to determine any relationship between antiarrhythmic effects and the time of administration. Studies with two other thromboxane synthetase inhibitors, dazoxiben and carboxyheptylimizadole, and a thromboxane analogue, U 46,619, were performed on the early arrhythmias to investigate a possible role of thromboxane A2 in the genesis of ischemic arrhythmias. Pretreatment and very early intervention with metoprolol caused a significant reduction in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the 0-0.5 hr period. The number of ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) and the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) during the 0.5-4 hr period were markedly reduced by both pretreatment and late intervention with metoprolol. VEBs and VT in the 0-0.5 hr phase were reduced by UK 38,485 and carboxyheptylimidazole and increased by U 46,619. Administration of a combination of the drugs produced a significant reduction in early VF and late VEBs.", 
    "70": "Indoramin is a selective alpha 1-antagonist which reduces blood pressure without reflex tachycardia and can cause a bradycardia. The direct bradycardic effect of indoramin was investigated in various isolated cardiac preparations as well as in the intact cat. In isolated guinea-pig atria indoramin reduced spontaneous atrial rate in concentrations similar to those that reduced maximal driving frequency but smaller than those reducing contractility (EC30 = 0.9, 1.3 and 5.2 micrograms/ml, respectively). In the isolated perfused electrically driven (2.5 Hz) guinea-pig heart, indoramin 1 microgram/ml mainly increased ST interval with no effect on QRS interval, higher concentrations (3 micrograms/ml) also increased the QRS interval. In anaesthetized cats indoramin 6 mg/kg i.v. reduced blood pressure and heart rate (increased cycle length), increased the ST interval and effective refractory period (measured by electrical stimuli from the right ventricle) but had little or no effect on the QRS interval and the diastolic stimulation threshold. With the 10 mg/kg dose the latter two parameters were increased. Analogous experiments with the antiarrhythmic drug mexiletine (class I) showed little changes in cycle length, effective refractory period and the ST interval, however, there was a marked increase in diastolic threshold. DL-sotalol, which as well as having a beta-adrenoceptor blocking action, also prolongs action potential duration (class III antiarrhythmic activity), had the same cardiac profile as indoramin. For both indoramin and sotalol a significant positive correlation was shown between increase in cycle length and increase in effective refractory period. It is suggested that indoramin exerts class III antiarrhythmic activity and that this property is responsible for the bradycardic action of the drug which is seen in doses that already markedly reduce blood pressure. In higher doses or concentrations indoramin also exerts class I antiarrhythmic activity which, however, does not contribute to the bradycardic effect.", 
    "71": "This is the first report describing the syndrome of hypotony and ciliochoroidal detachment following pharmacologic aqueous suppressant therapy in previously filtered eyes. Four patients had a history of advanced primary open-angle glaucoma treated with multiple medical therapies, including timolol for 11 to 36 months. They then underwent filtration surgery, which failed in two cases. Timolol and/or acetazolamide therapy was instituted 1 to 18 months following surgery. The patients then developed hypotony and ciliochoroidal detachment, which resolved spontaneously after cessation of the pharmacologic aqueous suppressant therapy. In three of the cases, the episode of hypotony and ciliochoroidal detachment recurred after a second challenge with timolol and/or acetazolamide therapy. Inflammation, tumor, wound leakage, retinal detachment and cyclodialysis cleft were excluded. A mechanism of formation of ciliochoroidal detachment in this syndrome is proposed. Long-term timolol therapy followed by filtration surgery and its attendant postoperative hypotony and ciliochoroidal detachment sensitizes the ciliary epithelium. Subsequent pharmacologic aqueous suppressant therapy results in almost total reduction of aqueous production, causing hypotony and ciliochoroidal detachment.", 
    "72": "Cerium was applied for the ultrastructural, cytochemical localization of adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1.). The enzyme activity was stimulated with norepinephrine, prenalterol and cholera toxin in the brown fat cells of newborn rats. The final reaction product was observed in the plasmalemmas of the stimulated adipocytes. The precipitate was finely crystalline, easily visible in the electron microscope and in the X-ray microprobe analysis it yielded cerium and phosphate peaks, respectively. The use of cerium offers a new tool valid for the cytochemical localization of adenylate cyclase enzyme related to the membrane receptors.", 
    "73": "The effects of iontophoretic application of 1-norepinephrine (NE) and related drugs on granule cell responses evoked by a stimulus pulse applied to the medial perforant pathway were studied in anesthetized rats. Drugs were applied and responses recorded at successive dorso-ventral positions along the dendrites and at the cell body layer. 1. Reciprocal actions of alpha and beta receptors were revealed in the cell body region. The beta agonist isoproterenol decreased the population spike while the beta antagonist sotalol increased it. In contrast, the alpha agonists phenylephrine and clonidine increased the population spike whereas the alpha antagonist prazosin decreased it. The action of the drugs was rapid, dose dependent and reversible. NE itself had no effect when applied in the granule cell layer. 2. In contrast to the failure of NE to elicit a short term response, and in confirmation of a previous report (Neuman and Harley 1983), the prolonged application of NE in the granule cell layer produced a longterm enhancement of the population spike. However, this effect was also observed after the application of d-NE. 3. NE affected granule cell responses in the middle third of the dendrites where it reduced the evoked synaptic potential (ESP, current flow produced by excitatory synaptic activity) in a dose-dependent manner. Recordings taken simultaneously in the cell body region revealed a reduction of the population spike and no change in the ESP at the cell body layer (the positive-going ESP reflecting an outward current flow from the cell). In an attempt to delineate receptor specificity, a series of alpha and beta agonists and antagonists were applied to the mid-dendritic region. All drugs reduced the ESP in a manner similar to NE. Such lack of specificity in the action of NE has been previously reported in the spinal motoneuron (Engberg et al. 1976; Marshall 1983). The function of NE in the dentate gyrus is discussed in the light of these and previous results.", 
    "74": "The antihypertensive and beta-blocking effect of 100 mg atenolol and 100 mg metoprolol each given once daily were compared using an observer-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured 22 hours after the last tablet of a 2-week dosing period. Twenty-five patients completed the study. Both drugs caused a significant decrease in supine and standing blood pressure, with atenolol effecting, numerically, the greater reductions. The decrease in standing diastolic blood pressure was significantly greater with atenolol than with metoprolol (p less than 0.05). Metoprolol at 22 hours post-dosing did not differ from placebo in the control of exercise systolic blood pressure (191.1 v 194.6 mmHg): the exercise systolic blood pressure achieved on atenolol (177.3 mmHg) was significantly lower than that achieved on both placebo (p less than 0.001) or metoprolol (p less than 0.05). The heart rates achieved on atenolol were significantly lower than those achieved on metoprolol in similar circumstances (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that, at the doses examined in this study, atenolol is the more suitable agent for the control of supine, standing and exercise blood pressure over 22 hours.", 
    "75": "In order to determine if there are differences in reactivity of small arteries of cutaneous and skeletal muscle vascular beds taken from rabbits of different ages, vascular smooth muscle strips were tested in vitro with a variety of drugs. Arteries from the ear and hind limb skeletal muscle were removed from adult female rabbits, aged 6-48 months. Developed force of the vessel strips was measured during exposure to cumulative concentrations of norepinephrine, norepinephrine following propranolol, angiotensin II (skeletal muscle artery only) and histamine (ear artery only). Comparable segments of arteries from rabbits of different ages showed no significant differences in size or in maximum developed force attributable to age. A lack of beta-adrenoceptor activity was indicated in the ear arteries of all adult age groups studied, while propranolol enhanced contractile responses to norepinephrine in skeletal muscle arteries independent of age. Likewise, there were no consistent, age-related changes in the reactivity of either vessel type to norepinephrine, histamine, or angiotensin. This study indicates that small cutaneous and skeletal muscle arteries from mature female rabbits do not undergo any appreciable change in adrenergic and nonadrenergic sensitivity with age.", 
    "76": "Changes in the content of lipid peroxidation (LP) products and activities of antioxidant enzymes--superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase in myocardium of rats after experimental infarction as well as after pretreatment with antioxidant ionol, beta-adrenoblocker inderal and verapamil, an inhibitor of slow Ca2+-channels have been studied. In the left ventricles of the control animals decreased levels of LP-products (Schiff bases and lipid hydroperoxides) have been registered as compared with right ventricles, accompanied by increased activity of antioxidant enzymes in the left ventricles. In experimental infarction the level of LP products increases and activity of antioxidant enzymes decreases both in ischemic and nonischemic regions of the heart. In nonischemic zone these changes can be prevented by pretreatment with inderal and ionol but not with verapamil.", 
    "77": "The antihypertensive effect of the combined use of the new calcium channel blocker nicardipine and atenolol was assessed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving twenty hypertensive patients. Atenolol 100 mg once daily was given to all patients. In addition, either placebo or nicardipine, in increasing doses (5-20 mg three times daily), was allocated randomly to the patients. Compared with placebo, nicardipine had an additional dose-dependent, blood-pressure-lowering effect in the hypertensive patients who had been pretreated with atenolol. An increase in the heart rate was not observed, suggesting that atenolol prevented reflex activation of sympathetic nerve tone caused by the vasodilating properties of nicardipine. The combination of both atenolol and nicardipine was well tolerated by all patients; side effects were minor and did not cause discontinuation of the treatment. No effects on A-V conduction were observed. It is concluded that the combined administration of nicardipine and atenolol is a useful treatment for hypertension that is well accepted by the patients.", 
    "78": "The in vitro plasma protein binding of phenytoin (diphenylhydantoin), salicylic acid, propranolol, pethidine (meperidine) and chlorpromazine was measured using an air-driven, bench-top ultracentrifuge and the results were compared with those obtained by equilibrium dialysis. For all drugs studied, except chlorpromazine, a significant correlation was found between the plasma binding results obtained by the two methods. However, only in the case of propranolol the actual binding values obtained by the two techniques were very similar. In the case of phenytoin, salicylic acid and pethidine, ultracentrifugation gave higher plasma binding values than equilibrium dialysis. Binding values obtained by the two methods for chlorpromazine were not correlated at all. This may be explained by binding of chlorpromazine to the very low density lipoprotein fraction which floats after ultracentrifugation. The described ultracentrifugation binding technique may be useful to rapidly measure the plasma binding of certain drugs in microsamples.", 
    "79": "Serum protein binding of furosemide and penbutolol, the active principles of Betasemid (Hoe 9358), was studied by equilibrium dialysis. Membranes from commercial dialysis tubes were used within commercially available cells. Serum drug and portion unbound in buffer were determined by quantitative thin-layer chromatography. In the range of 1-20 micrograms drug/ml serum, 96 +/- 0.3% of furosemide vs. 88 +/- 4% of penbutolol were bound to proteins. The same results were obtained, when the two substances simultaneously interacted with proteins. Thus, specific protein binding sites for both compounds were demonstrated. For both drugs, Scatchard plots revealed two classes of specific binding sites with statistical mean values/protein of 0.4 and 5 in the case of furosemide and 0.04 and 0.3 in the case of penbutolol. Binding energies were 27.6 and 19.6 kJ/mol furosemide vs. 31.5 and 23.9 kJ/mol penbutolol. Further, serum protein binding of furosemide was studied by ultrafiltration. A micropartition system MPS-1 was used. Results were the same as those from equilibrium dialysis.", 
    "80": "18 healthy volunteers received conventional atenolol (Tenormin) 50 mg once daily and metoprolol 50 mg twice daily for 6 days in a balanced randomised cross-over fashion. There was a wash-out period of two weeks between each phase. Plasma concentrations of the drugs were measured on the last day of each phase. Comparison of the coefficients of variation showed a lower variability in the pharmacokinetics of atenolol compared to metoprolol. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.", 
    "81": "Recently propranolol was found to inhibit human lecithin: cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activity both after oral treatment and after addition to plasma in vitro. Now the dose-response relationship of the propranolol effect on LCAT activity was evaluated in vitro. Concentrations required to produce half-maximal effects in 7 men ranged from 32.4 to 121.4 nmol/l which corresponds to the therapeutical concentration range of the drug. Complete inhibition could not be achieved. The maximal effect (propranolol-sensitive LCAT activity) varied between subjects depending on the preexiting lecithin: cholesterol acyl transfer rate in plasma. Propranolol mediated inhibition of LCAT activity could be abolished when heat-inactivated plasma instead of native plasma was used as LCAT substrate. It is concluded that the interindividual variability of propranolol-sensitive LCAT activity may reflect differences in the thermoinstable lipoprotein structure.", 
    "82": "Mechanisms of control for activities of relay neurons (P-cells) in the rat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) are surveyed with special reference to ascending projection arising from the locus coeruleus (LC), the local projection from the visual portion of the thalamic reticular nucleus (vTRN) and the descending projection from the visual cortex (VC). Noradrenaline released from terminals of LC neurons exerts a facilitatory influence on P-cell activity via alpha-receptors. A recurrent projection of vTRN neurons on P-cells is inhibitory, utilizing GABA as a transmitter. P-cells receive an excitatory input from corticothalamic neurons of VC. However, in many P-cells the corticofugal excitation is counterbalanced by inhibition arising in vTRN neurons which are invariably exited by the collateral branches of the corticogeniculate axons. Thus, LGNd is not a simple relay station, but various modifications of visual information are made in this nucleus."
