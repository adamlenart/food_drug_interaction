Tartaric acid was used as solubility promoter, sodium chloride as osmotic agent and polyvinyl pyrrolidone as retardant agent. Ethyl cellulose was employed as semipermeable membrane containing polyethylene glycol 400 as plasticizer. The formulation of atenolol monolithic osmotic pump tablet was optimized by orthogonal design and evaluated by similarity factor (f(2)). The optimal monolithic osmotic pump tablet was found to be able to deliver atenolol at the rate of approximate zero-order up to 24h, independent of release media and agitation rate. The approach of solubility-modulated by acid-alkali reaction might be used for the preparation of osmotic pump tablet of other poorly water-soluble drugs with alkaline or acid groups.", 
    "1": "The beta-blocker, carvedilol has an additional endothelium-dependent vasodilating properties in patients with hypertension or heart failure. Whether carvedilol can improve endothelium-dependent relaxation in a diabetic animal model and its mechanism of action are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of carvedilol on the endothelial-response of aortas from diabetic rats and the underlying mechanism. Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced endothelium-independent relaxation, and expression of nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) mRNA were measured in aortas isolated from both non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The level of NO in serum was also measured 5 weeks after carvedilol administration (1 or 10 mg/kg/day). Endothelium-dependent relaxation declined along with the decrease of serum NO level in aortas from diabetic rats. Treatment with carvedilol for 5 weeks prevented the inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation and the decrease of serum NO levels caused by diabetes. The expression of NOS3 mRNA, protein expression and NOS3 phosphorylation at Ser1177 in diabetic rat aorta was very low in untreated diabetic aortas compared with the healthy group. Administration of carvedilol not only significantly increased the expression of NOS3 mRNA but also protein expression and NOS3 phosphorylation at Ser1177 in the healthy and diabetic groups. In conclusion, chronic carvedilol administration significantly ameliorated the endothelial dysfunction in diabetic rat aortas, in which increased NO level, up-regulated NOS3 mRNA and phosphorylation at Ser1177 may be involved.", 
    "2": "Adrenal gland involvement could account for 6% of active tuberculosis. The diagnosis of this extrapulmonary form of tuberculosis is difficult, especially when presenting as unilateral adrenal tumor. This report describes an unusual case of adrenal tuberculosis presenting as a tumor occurring shortly after surgical removal of an adrenal pheochromocytoma located in the opposite gland, in a 63-year-old woman with a previous history of breast cancer. At initial presentation, the patient suffered from symptomatic paroxysmal hypertension. A pheochromocytoma in the left adrenal was diagnosed and resected. One year later, while physical examination and biological parameters were unremarkable, an enhanced adrenal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a right adrenal mass mimicking the CT features of the resected pheochromocytoma. A peripheral tissular rim delineating a central hypodensity characterized this tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the same findings on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted slices, while the mass was not seen on T2-weighted images. No tumoral signal loss was observed on out of phase images when using the in phase-out of phase T1-weighted sequence. Because of the tumoral evolution and the uncertainty of the nature of that lesion, the patient underwent a second adrenalectomy. Definitive diagnosis was provided by culture of tissue sample, which resulted in the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In an era of tuberculosis resurgence, this unusual case underscores the necessity of keeping in mind adrenal tuberculosis as a possible differential diagnosis in adrenal tumors of uncertainty nature. It stresses the importance of culture of biopsy tumor, whenever feasible, to avoid unnecessary operations. In the near future, interferon-gamma assay could be a valuable means to recognize extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis.", 
    "3": "It has been acknowledged that patients who receive a beta-blocker or diuretic based regimen are at increased risk of developing new-onset diabetes. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to decrease patients' odds of developing new-onset type 2 diabetes. A number of large placebo-controlled multi-center trials in post-myocardial infarction and heart failure patients have shown the ability of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system medications to reduce the onset of type 2 diabetes. Pharmacologic data has shown improved insulin sensitivity with ACEIs and ARBs. Controversy persists regarding the influence of calcium channel blockers on the development of new-onset diabetes.",

    "7": "Circulating cardiac natriuretic peptide levels are being used increasingly in a range of clinical circumstances. Since it is evident that drugs used in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders can modulate natriuretic peptide levels, we here review the literature documenting these effects. Diuretics, blockers of the renin-angiotensin system, vasodilator agents, dopamine-like agonists, amiodarone, and perhaps allopurinol and statins suppress natriuretic peptide levels, most obviously in heart failure. Beta-blockers stimulate natriuretic peptide concentrations in hypertensive subjects, whereas in heart failure they have little effect or are stimulatory in the short term and inhibitory with sustained therapy. Digitalis compounds and aspirin tend to increase natriuretic peptide levels, and calcium channel blocking agents have varying effects depending on the individual drug and duration of administration. The effects of other drugs are less clear. Additional information is needed regarding the effects of medications along with dissection of the role of altered cardiac secretion versus changes in plasma clearance as explanation for drug-induced perturbations in natriuretic peptide concentrations. In the meantime, clinicians need to consider the known effects of medications when interpreting plasma levels of the cardiac natriuretic peptides.",

Anticholinergics remain the first line in pharmacotherapy, however the use of these agents is hindered by adverse effects and limited efficacy. Thus there is a need for more effective treatments. Recently, there has been a move towards targeting novel pathways thought to play a role in overactivity. This review aims to provide an insight into the recent developments in pharmacotherapy of the overactive bladder.",

It is shown that exercise and beta-AR blockade have a favorable effect on cardiac and vascular beta-AR signaling in several cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we examined the effects of these two different strategies on beta-AR dysregulation and LV inotropic reserve in the aging heart. Forty male Wistar-Kyoto aged rats were randomized to sedentary, exercise (12 wk treadmill training), metoprolol (250 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) for 4 wk), and exercise plus metoprolol treatment protocols. Ten male Wistar-Kyoto sedentary young rats were also used as a control group. Old trained, old metoprolol-treated, and old trained plus metoprolol-treated rats showed significantly improved LV maximal and minimal first derivative of the pressure rise responses to beta-AR stimulation (isoproterenol) compared with old untrained animals. We found a significant reduction in cardiac sarcolemmal membrane beta-AR density and adenylyl cyclase activity in old untrained animals compared with young controls. Exercise training and metoprolol, alone or combined, restored cardiac beta-AR density and G-protein-dependent adenylyl cyclase activation in old rats. Although cardiac membrane G-protein-receptor kinase 2 levels were not upregulated in untrained old compared with young control rats, both exercise and metoprolol treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction of G-protein-receptor kinase 2 protein levels, which is a further indication of beta-AR signaling amelioration in the aged heart induced by these treatment modalities. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that exercise and beta-AR blockade can similarly ameliorate beta-AR signaling in the aged heart, leading to improved beta-AR responsiveness and corresponding LV inotropic reserve.",

Carvedilol was administered in the food at an optimum concentration (i.e. known to provide clinically relevant blood concentrations and reduce cardiac hypertrophy determined from previous studies). In addition, SP and WKY rats were fed a normal diet (SP normal diet group and WKY normal diet group). These groups are known to not develop the same significant cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction within this limited time of study, and provided two more normal control groups for comparison. In the second reversal study, one group of SP was fed SFD for 12 weeks (SP-SFD pretreatment period) to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Carvedilol (2,400 parts per million) was then added to the diet for an additional 6 weeks (SP-SFD carvedilol treatment period).",

M-mode-measured and -calculated parameters demonstrated that carvedilol treatment in the SP-SFD carvedilol group prevented increases in left-ventricular wall thickness (p < 0.05) and decreases in diastolic chamber diameter and volume, stroke volume, ejection fraction and cardiac output (all p < 0.05) that occurred in the SP-SFD control group. Further, cardiac measurements in the SP-SFD carvedilol group were normalized to levels similar to those in the SP and WKY normal diet groups. All SFD-fed groups exhibited similar, significantly elevated blood pressure during the study. In the second reversal study, carvedilol treatment for 6 weeks reversed the cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction that developed in SP-fed SFD for 12 weeks prior to carvedilol intervention. Under these conditions, carvedilol improved/normalized left-ventricular wall thickness, diastolic ventricular-chamber diameter and volume, stroke volume, ejection fraction and cardiac output (all p < 0.05).", 
    "53": "These data indicate that carvedilol provides protection from and facilitates reversal of progressive cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in this SP-SFD model of cardiac hypertrophy/heart failure. Since these effects occurred in the absence of effects on blood pressure, other known actions of carvedilol, especially its antioxidant activity, for example, may explain this significant cardiac protection. In addition, research using this SP-SFD model of cardiac hypertrophy/end-organ injury appears to translate well to human cardiovascular disease.",

The direct crystallizations were carried out in an automatic lab reactor (Mettler Toledo LabMax) system. The optical purity of final product crystals was examined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), HPLC and PXRD. The crystal size distribution and morphology were analyzed using Malvern Mastersizer and Jeol SEM. It was found that optically pure crystal product could be obtained within certain safe supersaturation limit and there was no evidence of polymorph or solvate/hydrate transformation during the crystallization process. There was no selectivity of crystal growth or nucleation between the pure enantiomer and its racemate when the solution reaches the temperature lower than saturation temperature of the racemate.

This X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder is reported to involve abnormalities in autonomic cardiovascular regulation. As an initial step in understanding the basis for these abnormalities we have characterized autonomic cardiovascular function in Mecp2 deficient mice. Arterial pressure waves were recorded in freely moving animals using telemetry. Baseline blood pressure and pulse interval (PI) as well as indices of heart rate variability (HRV): standard deviation of PI (SDNN), range encompassing 90% of PIs (PI90) and standard deviation of adjacent PIs (SDSD) were similar in Mecp2(+/+) and Mecp2(+/-) animals. Spectral analysis of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PI in the frequency domain showed similar relative power in low frequency 1 (LF1, 08-0.4 Hz), low frequency 2 (LF2, 0.4-1.0 Hz), middle frequency (MF, 1-3 Hz) and high frequency (HF, 3.0-10.0 Hz) bands. Autonomic blockade with atropine or propranolol as well as elevation in ambient temperature to 32 degrees C resulted in changes in blood pressure, PI and HRV that did not differ between the strains. Atropine, propranolol and elevated temperature resulted in similar changes in both MAP and PI spectral power. Baroreceptor function was tested using intravenous injections of nitroprusside followed by phenylephrine. Maximum gain was not different. These results do reveal any disturbance of autonomic cardiovascular regulation in the Mecp2 deficient mouse genotype.",

Both blockers caused significant decrease in T(b) values mainly during scotophase. Nocturnal urine production rates were higher for M. socialis treated with the drugs compared with controls. Overall, urine production rates were systematically higher in PROP-voles over the 24 h period when compared with PRAZ-voles; however these differences were not statistically significant. Interestingly, PROP caused significant elevation in urinary 6-SMT at the second half of the dark phase, whereas PRAZ had no effects. These data suggest that the mechanisms regulating MEL synthesis and thermoregulatory responses in M. socialis are different from those described in other rodents' species. Importantly, the data also suggest that the beta-blockade-induced elevation in MEL levels may be directly associated with increased urination in M. socialis.", 
    "84": "Adult cats lack ocular dominance plasticity, showing little change in the ocular dominance distribution following monocular deprivation. Ocular dominance plasticity is also lost in kitten visual cortex that has been continuously infused with either catecholaminergic neurotoxin, beta-adrenoreceptor blocker, or inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A). Complementarily, in adult cats we showed earlier that pharmacological activation of protein kinase A, albeit partially, restored ocular dominance plasticity. In the present study, we first asked whether, mediated by protein kinase A activation, the same molecular mechanisms could restore ocular dominance plasticity to kitten cortex that once lost the expression of plasticity due to prior pharmacological treatments. Concurrently with monocular deprivation, two kinds of cyclic AMP-related drugs (cholera toxin A-subunit or dibutyryl cyclic AMP) were directly infused in two types of aplastic kitten cortex pretreated with either 6-hydroxydopamine or propranolol. The combined treatment resulted in clear ocular dominance shift to the non-deprived eye, indicating that cortical plasticity was fully restored to aplastic kitten cortex. Next, to directly prove the sensitivity difference in protein kinase A activation between the immature and mature cortex, we compared the thus-obtained data in kittens with the published data derived from adult cats under the comparable experimental paradigm. The extent of ocular dominance changes following monocular deprivation was compared at different drug concentrations in the two preparations: the shifted ocular dominance distribution in aplastic kitten cortex infused with dibutyryl cyclic AMP at the lowest concentration tested and the W-shaped distribution in similarly treated adult cortex at a thousandfold-higher drug concentration that induced nearly maximal changes. We conclude that, irrespective of the animal's age, activation of protein kinase A cascades is a general mechanism to maintain ocular dominance plasticity high, their sensitivity being substantially higher in the immature than mature cortex.",

Twenty-five (32%) of the patients were receiving beta-blocker therapy before the onset of their symptoms. Back pain was the most common initial symptom (72.2%). Emergency surgery was required in 19 patients (23%): 12 for rupture or impending rupture, four for mesenteric ischemia, and three for lower extremity ischemia. The need for emergency surgery was significantly higher in smokers (P=.03), in patients>70 years old (P=.035), and in patients who were not receiving beta-blocker therapy before the onset of symptoms (P=.023).

    "93": "The involvement of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in the modulation of bone adaptation to its load-bearing demand remains controversial. This study tested the involvement of SNS in the adaptive response of trabecular and cortical bone to either external loading or disuse. External loading consisted of cyclic strain (40 cycles, peak 1500 microstrain) applied for 7 min, 3 days/week, while disuse was induced by unilateral sciatic neurectomy (SN). C57Bl/J6 mice, female, 9 weeks old, were subjected to loading or disuse for 2 weeks. Half of the loaded and SN mice were injected with the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (PRO, 20 mug/g) 1 week before the start of loading or disuse and during all the duration of the experiment. MicroCT analysis of the tibiae showed that the applied load induced significant changes on both trabecular architecture and cortical geometry compared to the contralateral controls, indicating increased bone mass. In contrast, disuse markedly reduced trabecular and cortical indexes. However, these adaptive responses were not altered by PRO treatment. We further tested whether the lack of protective effect of PRO against disuse-induced bone loss was due to the very short duration of treatment by blocking SNS signaling for 8 weeks with either PRO (0.5 mg/ml in drinking water) or guanethidine sulfate (GS, 40 mug/g, injected). At the end of fourth week of treatment, mice underwent SN surgery so that disuse was induced for the remaining 4 weeks. Again, neither PRO nor GS treatments altered the disuse-induced bone loss in the neurectomized tibia. In addition, blockade of SNS signaling for either 3 or 8 weeks did not affect the basal trabecular bone architecture in control tibiae and in L4 vertebrae. This study shows that the mechano-adaptive response occurring in trabecular and cortical bone upon loading or disuse is not altered by inactivation of beta-adrenergic signaling. Furthermore, sympathectomy had no effect on trabecular bone at different skeletal sites. This suggests that the osteo-regulatory action of beta-adrenergic signaling is not involved in the bone mechano-adaptive response and must therefore affect other bone regulatory pathways.",

In our study, we have evaluated the influence of various preparation parameters such as concentration of the polymer, concentration of the pore former and temperature of the precipitation bath on the permeability and the release characteristics of propranolol. Propranolol tablets were prepared by direct compression and were coated with varying concentrations of cellulose acetate and glycerin. The coat was precipitated in water, maintained at various temperatures, followed by air drying of the coat. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the asymmetric structure of the membrane. The influence of various preparation parameters on the release of propranolol from asymmetric coated tablets was evaluated. SEM confirmed the asymmetric nature of the membrane. A zero order release of propranolol was obtained from the coated tablets of propranolol. Various preparation parameters studied significantly affected (p<0.05) the release of propranolol hydrochloride from the asymmetric membrane coated tablets and the release was independent of the pH and the rate of agitation of the dissolution medium (p>0.05). Asymmetric membranes can be successfully utilized in the controlled delivery of highly water soluble drugs like propranolol and by modifying preparation parameters like polymer concentration, pore former concentration and temperature of the precipitation bath, desired release rates can be obtained.", 
    "95": "Two distinct intracellular mechanisms have been proposed to affect the firing rate of cardiac pacemaker cells: one involves modulation of the I(f) current by the second messenger cAMP, and one relies upon disruption or alteration of SR Ca2+ transients during activity. Although both mechanisms are necessary for proper automaticity and autonomic rate control, the specific contribution of each to pacemaking is still debated. We investigated if the two processes can be separated based on potentially different effects on action potential characteristics during rate modulation. To identify specific I(f)-mediated effects, we used the selective I(f) blocker ivabradine and found that ivabradine (3 microM) slows rate (-16.2%) by selectively reducing (-31.9%) the steepness of early diastolic depolarization (EDD). On the other hand ryanodine (3 microM), used to evaluate the effects of abolishment of SR Ca2+ transients, slowed rate (-31.3%) by depolarizing the take-off potential (TOP, 18.1%) without affecting EDD. We therefore used these two parameters to identify I(f)-based or SR Ca2+ transients-based processes and analyzed the effects on action potential's characteristics of Rp-cAMPs (50 microM), a membrane permeable cAMP analogue directly activating f-channels; we found that Rp-cAMPs accelerates rate by increasing EDD (+42.3%) without modifying TOP. Finally, rate modulation was achieved by muscarinic (ACh 0.01 microM) or beta-adrenergic (Iso 1 microM) stimulation; in both cases, rate changes were associated with modifications of EDD (ACh, -29.3% and Iso, +47.6%) and not of TOP. We conclude that rate-related changes in the EDD induced by autonomic agonists are mediated by I(f) and not by processes involving SR Ca2+ transients.", 
    "96": "Three small serum proteins (SSP-1, -2, and -3), with molecular masses of 6.5-10kDa, were isolated from Habu (Trimeresurus flavoviridis) serum, and the amino acid sequences were determined by protein and cDNA analysis. Despite only limited sequence identity to any mammalian prostatic secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94), all of the Cys residues in these SSPs were well conserved. SSPs are the first PSP94 family proteins to be identified in reptiles. SSP-1 and -3 weakly inhibited the proteolytic activity of a snake venom metalloproteinase. On the other hand, SSP-2 formed a tight complex with triflin, a snake venom-derived Ca(2+) channel blocker that suppresses the smooth muscle contraction. This suggests a role for SSP-2 in the self defense system of venomous snakes.",

Talinolol permeability was selectively inhibited by grapefruit juice and its components. The furano coumarin, 6',7'-epoxybergamottin, was the most potent inhibitor (IC(50) = 0.7 microM), followed by 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (IC(50) = 34 microM) and bergamottin that did not show any inhibition at concentrations up to 10 microM.

The flavonoids and furanocoumarins tested in this study are in the same range of concentration they are present in the juice contributing, therefore, for the overall inhibitory effect of GFJ on P-gp activity. The in vitro data suggest that compounds present in grapefruit juice are able to inhibit the P-gp activity modifying the disposition of drugs that are P-gp substrates such as talinolol.", 
    "110": "We have previously reported that Fas-resistant A20 cells (FasR) have phospholipase D (PLD) activity upregulated by endogenous PLD2 overexpression. In the present study, we investigated how overexpressed PLD2 in FasR could generate survival signals by regulating the protein levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. To confirm the effect of PLD2 on Bcl-2 protein levels, we transfected PLD2 into wild-type murine B lymphoma A20 cells. The transfected cells showed markedly the increases in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels, and became resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis, similar to FasR. Treatment of wild-type A20 cells with phosphatidic acid (PA), the metabolic end product of PLD2 derived from phosphatidylcholin, markedly increased levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. Moreover, PA-induced expressions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were enhanced by propranolol, an inhibitor of PA phospholydrolase (PAP), whereas completely blocked by mepacrine, an inhibitor of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), suggesting that PLA(2) metabolite of PA is responsible for the increases in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels. We further confirmed the involvement of arachidonic acid (AA) in PA-induced survival signals by showing that 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DPPA), PA without AA, was unable to increase Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. Moreover, PA notably increased cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 protein expression, and PA-induced expression of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was inhibited by NS-398, a specific inhibitor of COX-2. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PA generated by PLD2 plays an important role in cell survival during Fas-mediated apoptosis through the increased Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels which resulted from PLA(2) and AA-COX2 pathway.",

In this study we investigated the involvement of NCX1 as well as the role of non-selective-cation channels (NSCC) in cardiac myofibroblast cell function in vitro.

NCX1 mRNA and proteins as well as Ca(v)1.2a protein are also expressed in P1 myofibroblasts. Myofibroblast motility in the presence of 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB was blocked with AG1296. Myofibroblast motility, contraction, and proliferation were sensitive to KB-R7943, a specific NCX1 reverse-mode inhibitor. In contrast, only proliferation and contraction, but not motility were sensitive to nifedipine, while gadolinium (NSCC blocker) was only associated with decreased motility. ML-7 treatment was associated with inhibition of the chemotactic response and contraction. Thus cardiac myofibroblast chemotaxis, contraction, and proliferation were sensitive to different pharmacologic treatments suggesting that regulation of transplasmalemmal calcium movements may be important in growth factor receptor-mediated processes. NCX1 may represent an important moiety in suppression of myofibroblast functions.",

In vivo, dobutamine infusion evoked smaller heart rate and/or contractility increases in subjects carrying Gly389Gly-beta(1)AR vs subjects carrying Arg389Arg-beta(1)AR. The aim of this study was to find out whether the Arg389Gly-beta(1)AR polymorphism might also determine demand of catecholamine-induced inotropic support in patients with low cardiac index (CI) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). For this purpose, we assessed in 82 patients, who were preoperatively chronically treated with metoprolol, after CABG surgery with CPB, the dose and duration of adrenaline-induced inotropic support in relation to the Arg389Gly-beta(1)AR genotype. Patients homozygous for the Arg389-beta(1)AR variant (n = 45) required, in comparison to patients homozygous for the Gly389-beta(1)AR variant (n = 9), lower adrenaline doses (53 +/- 24 vs 164 +/- 39 ng/kg body weight/min, p < 0.05) to reach a stable and comparable hemodynamic status and a CI >or= 3.0 l/min/m(2). Moreover, the time necessary for inotropic support tended to be shorter in patients homozygous for the Arg389-beta(1)AR than in patients homozygous for the Gly389-beta(1)AR (10.5 +/- 6 vs 20.5 +/- 12 h). Values for patients heterozygous for the Arg389Gly-beta(1)AR (n = 28) were in between. We conclude that the Arg389Gly-beta(1)AR polymorphism appears to be a determinant of cardiac responses to catecholamine stimulation. Thus, by assessment of the Arg389Gly-beta(1)AR polymorphism, it might be possible to predict demand of and therapeutic responses to beta AR agonist treatment.",

Our object was to study the latter system involved in these behaviours, using male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g with i.c.v. implants. The results show that all the adrenoceptor antagonists \"per se\" do not affect excessive grooming behaviour or motor activity. Intracerebroventricular administration of propranolol, a general beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, before neuropeptide-EI, inhibited the induced excessive grooming behaviour in a dose dependent manner. Metoprolol, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, also blocked this behaviour. However, intracerebroventricular injections of phentolamine, an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, and ((+/-)-1-[2,3-(Dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol), a beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, had no effect on the behaviour induced by neuropeptide-EI induced behaviour for any of the doses tested. On the other hand, isoproterenol, a general beta-adrenoceptor agonist and dobutamine, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor agonist, both elicited similar behaviours as those induced by neuropeptide-EI. These results support the hypothesis that a relationship exists between neuropeptide-EI and beta-adrenoceptors, more specifically the beta(1)-adrenoceptor, as found with other similar endogenous peptides such as neurotensin, cholecystin, substance P and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone. Hence, neuropeptide-EI could probably be exerting a neuromodulating effect on the central nervous system.",

Beta-blocker therapy significantly reduces the incidence of SCD. These clinical observations suggest a close association between ventricular arrhythmia and sympathetic activity. The identification of patients at risk is a major clinical problem not only for the unpredictability of the event, but also for the continuous growth of patients'number. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is highly effective at terminating life threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia At present, 1-2% of the population has heart failure and numbers continue to increase, but the ICD remains expensive. The challenge lies in identifying patients with heart failure who are at significant risk of arrhythmia and who would benefit from an ICD in addition to other anti-arrhythmic strategies. Our power of identifying heart failure patients at risk for arrhythmic death is far from being satisfactory. Heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity analysis has been largely utilized to obtain information on autonomic modulation of sinus node as well as to identify patients at risk. It is possible that the combination of results of multiple noninvasive tests such as reduction in ejection fraction and positivity for T wave alternans may not only provide general prognostic information but also facilitate the appropriate identification of patients at risk who may benefit from antiarrhythmic therapy.",

In recent years, beta-blockers have been shown to improve the status of HF patients, although the precise mechanisms remain unclear. The present study evaluates the effect of beta-blockade with carvedilol (1 mg/kg/day) on cardiovascular function in 2- and 6-month-old cardiomyopathic hamsters (SCH) after 1-month and 5-month treatment periods with the drug, respectively. Age-matched golden hamsters were used as controls (CT). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and echocardiographic studies were evaluated. The latter studies included left ventricular end-systolic (LVESV) and end-diastolic (LVEDV) volumes, ejection fraction (EF), cardiac output index (COI), heart rate (HR), and left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT). In 2-month-old SCH, carvedilol administration during a 1-month period reduced SBP from 107.59 +/- 3.49 to 77.26 +/- 3.49 mm Hg (n = 5, p < 0.05). At this stage, cardiac parameters in SCH were similar to those of controls and were not affected by carvedilol administration. In 6-month-old SCH, 5-month administration of carvedilol decreased SBP from 102.16 +/- 3.61 to 90.60 +/- 2.80 mm Hg (n = 5, p < 0.05), HR from 363 +/- 14 to 324 +/- 14 bpm (n = 5, p < 0.05), and LVESV from 0.18 +/- 0.01 to 0.13 +/- 0.01 ml/100 g BW (n = 5, p < 0.05), and increased EF and COI by 14 and 23%, respectively (n = 5, p < 0.05). The drug did not modify LVEDV or LVPWT. These results reveal that carvedilol significantly improves cardiac function in 6-month-old cardiomyopathic hamsters, but it does not prevent ventricular dilatation. Improved cardiac function appears to be secondary to decreased total peripheral resistance, due mainly to the vasodilator properties of the drug. Thus, overactivation of the sympathetic system is not likely to be a determining factor in the etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy in this animal model.", 
    "166": "Adrenergic signaling is important for the retrieval of intermediate-term contextual and spatial memories. The role of norepinephrine in retrieval requires signaling through beta1-adrenergic receptors in the hippocampus. Environmental cues activate the locus ceruleus, the main adrenergic nucleus of the brain, when an environmental stimulus is memorable. This leads to norepinephrine activation in the hippocampus, which is important for retrieving memories. Although beta-blockers do not impair cognition in normal subjects, this article explores the possibility that central nervous system (CNS)-active beta-blockers could affect delayed memory in patients with cognitive impairment. The authors investigated the influence of beta-blockers on delayed memory function in cognitively impaired patients. There was a trend for worse delayed memory retrieval in patients who were on CNS-active beta-blockers. These data support the notion that common medications used in cognitively impaired elderly patients can worsen cognition and that careful selection of medications may help to maximize retrieval of newly formed memories.",

After a baseline 24-hour Holter evaluation in all subjects, patients with MVP were started on metoprolol succinate therapy at a dose of 25 to 100 mg/d, and Holter analysis was repeated at the end of 3 months of metoprolol therapy. At the basal evaluation, all time-domain HRV indices with the exception of proportion of adjacent RR intervals differing by >50 ms in the 24-hour recording were significantly lower in patients with MVP than controls (SD of all normal-to-normal [NN] intervals, p = 0.013; SD of average NN intervals calculated during 5-minute periods of the entire recording, p = 0.03; triangular index, p = 0.025; and square root of mean squared differences in successive NN intervals, p = 0.026).

IDRA is a congenital anomaly with unknown pathogenesis and highly variable clinical presentation. Optimal management of severe IDRA is controversial and individualized. Literature reports of long-term follow-up have been limited. We describe a child with IDRA with rapid atrial tachycardia (AT) refractory to both medical and surgical management, and we provide long-term follow-up on our two previously reported cases, both of whom had documented AT. For infants with AT, the clinical course is unpredictable, and medical therapy is the first line of treatment. The decision to proceed with surgical resection of a giant right atrium should be made on an individual basis. Atrial resection along with a modified right atrial MAZE procedure could be considered in infants with life-threatening atrial tachyarrhythmia refractory to medical treatment. Surgical scarring of the right atrium may produce substrate for atrial arrhythmia, which may also be refractory to medical therapy. Histological examination of excised atrial tissue remains inconsistent and not contributory to the determination of the etiology of IDRA. Our three infants with IDRA illustrate unique features of their variable clinical courses, as well as continued difficulties with establishing clear guidelines with regard to surgical management of this unusual disorder.",

This prospective study was conducted to investigate whether early intravenous (IV) metoprolol injection acutely decreases P(maximum) and P(dispersion) in patients with ACS. This study involved 100 consecutive patients with ACS who were divided into 2 groups according to whether or not they received early IV metoprolol. Group 1 consisted of 19 patients who received IV metoprolol within 3 h after onset of symptoms, and group 2 consisted of 81 patients who did not receive IV metoprolol within 3 h after symptom onset because of late admission. P(maximum) and P(dispersion) were measured on admission and again at 2 h after admission. Two-dimensional echocardiographic examination was also performed. For patients who received early IV metoprolol, P(maximum) and P(dispersion), measured 2 h after admission, were shorter than values at admission (P<.001). Conversely, P(maximum) and P(dispersion), measured 2 h after admission, did not differ significantly from values at admission in patients who did not receive early IV metoprolol (P=.292 and P=.236, respectively).

A human intestinal cell line, Caco-2, was used as an in-vitro model of the intestinal mucosa to assess transepithelial transport of zolmitriptan. In the Caco-2 cells, the absorptive transport of zolmitriptan was pH dependent and the transport was enhanced at weakly alkali pH on the apical side. No concentration dependence and saturation were observed for the apical-to-basolateral and basolateral-to-apical transport of zolmitriptan at a concentration of 0.1-10 mM. The permeability ratio value was about 1.5-2.6 at a concentration of 0.1-2.0 mM. Inhibition experiments using verapamil, nifedipine and nimodipine as inhibitors were studied and indicated that P-glycoprotein participated in the transport of zolmitriptan. Inhibition of the Na+-H+ exchanger with amiloride resulted in a significant increase in absorption and a slight inhibition in secretion. This suggests that the Na+-H+ exchanger may be involved in the transport of zolmitriptan. The results indicated that the transport of zolmitriptan was mediated by both passive diffusion and active transport. A series of drug-drug interaction experiments were carried out between zolmitriptan and some drugs that may be co-administrated with zolmitriptan in the clinic. The results indicated that flunarizine, cetirizine, propranolol and atenolol potently decreased both the apical-to-basolateral and basolateral-to-apical transport rate of zolmitriptan. Cimetidine and aspirin slightly inhibited the apical-to-basolateral transport of zolmitriptan, but significantly decreased the basolateral-to-apical transport of zolmitriptan. Thus, the absorption drug-drug interactions should be considered when these drugs are co-administrated with zolmitriptan in the clinic.",

Frequently physicians treat patients with asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and patients with hypertension on beta-blockers without clear evidence that there is value in doing so. Chronic heart failure poses an extraordinary economic burden; any effective therapy that limits the progression to symptomatic heart failure can probably reduce monetary expenditures in addition to potentially reducing morbidity and mortality. In this article, we review the available literature on using beta-blockers in stage A and B heart failure to prevent progression to the symptomatic stages. The literature reveals that there is no benefit in using beta-blockers to treat essential hypertension. In patients who experience LV dysfunction post-myocardial infarction, even if asymptomatic, there is improved mortality and a trend toward a reduction in progression to symptomatic heart failure. In patients with asymptomatic chronic LV dysfunction there are data that beta-blockers reduce LV dimensions and improve ejection fraction. Patients with hypertension should not be given beta-blockers as primary treatment. All patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction should be treated with a beta-blocker, regardless of whether they experienced myocardial infarction.",

Eight simultaneously recorded monophasic action potentials demonstrated an increase in dispersion of repolarization, especially between the left and the right ventricle. During programmed ventricular stimulation with up to two extrastimuli, pinacidil significantly increased the inducibility of ventricular fibrillation (1 heart under baseline conditions, 29 hearts during pinacidil administration; P = 0.0001). Additional treatment with the I(Kr) blocker sotalol (100 microM) and the class I antiarrhythmic drugs flecainide (2 microM) and quinidine (0.5 microM) randomly assigned to three groups of 16 hearts led to prolongation of repolarization as well as refractory period. Sotalol or flecainide did not reduce the rate of inducibility of ventricular fibrillation significantly (P = 0.63; P = 0.219). However, quinidine reduced the inducibility of ventricular fibrillation by 73% (P = 0.008). The antiarrhythmic potential of quinidine was associated with a significantly greater prolongation of MAP duration, refractoriness, and postrepolarization refractoriness (PRR) as compared with sotalol and flecainide. Moreover, quinidine, in contrast to sotalol and flecainide, reduced dispersion of repolarization.",

Seventy-five healthy adults were randomized to receive therapeutic oral doses of artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin, arteether, artemether or artesunate for 5 days (days 1-5). A six-drug cocktail consisting of caffeine, coumarin, mephenytoin, metoprolol, chlorzoxazone and midazolam was administered orally on days -6, 1, 5 and 10 to assess the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A, respectively. Four-hour plasma concentrations of parent drugs and corresponding metabolites and 7-hydroxycoumarin urine concentrations were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The 1-hydroxymidazolam/midazolam 4-h plasma concentration ratio (CYP3A) was increased on day 5 by artemisinin [2.66-fold (98.75% CI: 2.10-3.36)], artemether [1.54 (1.14-2.09)] and dihydroartemisinin [1.25 (1.06-1.47)] compared with day -6. The S-4'-hydroxymephenytoin/S-mephenytoin ratio (CYP2C19) was increased on day 5 by artemisinin [1.69 (1.47-1.94)] and arteether [1.33 (1.15-1.55)] compared with day -6. The paraxanthine/caffeine ratio (CYP1A2) was decreased on day 1 after administration of artemisinin [0.27 (0.18-0.39)], arteether [0.70 (0.55-0.89)] and dihydroartemisinin [0.73 (0.59-0.90)] compared with day -6. The alpha-hydroxymetoprolol/metoprolol ratio (CYP2D6) was lower on day 1 compared with day -6 in the artemisinin [0.82 (0.70-0.96)] and dihydroartemisinin [0.83 (0.71-0.96)] groups, respectively. In the artemisinin-treated subjects this decrease was followed by a 1.34-fold (1.14-1.58) increase from day 1 to day 5. These results show that intake of artemisinin antimalarials affect the activities of several principal human drug metabolizing CYP450 enzymes. Even though not significant in all treatment groups, changes in the individual metrics were of the same direction for all the artemisinin drugs, suggesting a class effect that needs to be considered in the development of new artemisinin derivatives and combination treatments of malaria.", 
    "204": "beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) have historically been considered an effective and safe option for first-line treatment of hypertension. However, very recently, it has been proposed that beta-blockers should no longer be considered suitable for first-line therapy in the patient with uncomplicated hypertension because of unfavourable morbidity and mortality data. New evidence from recent clinical studies of nebivolol, a third-generation highly selective beta(1)-blocker with additional endothelial nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilating activity, confirms previous findings that this drug differs from other beta-blockers. The combined mechanisms of beta-adrenoceptor antagonism and NO-mediated vasodilation may potentiate the blood pressure-lowering effect of this agent, and confer a broader favourable metabolic profile, which may be clinically relevant for hypertensive patients. The antioxidant properties of nebivolol and its neutral or even favourable effects on both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are well documented. These properties consistently differentiate nebivolol from nonvasodilating beta-blockers such as atenolol, metoprolol or bisoprolol. Therapeutic indications for beta-blockers include a wide range of co-morbidities found in hypertensive patients, including ischaemic heart disease, tachyarrhythmias and heart failure. Given that the majority of hypertensive patients require more than one drug to control blood pressure, the multiple mechanisms of action and favourable metabolic profile of nebivolol could make it an alternative therapeutic option for hypertensive patients requiring beta-adrenoceptor therapy.",

At present there is no effective and accepted therapy for NASH. The renin-angiotensin system is involved in hepatic fibrosis through activation of hepatic stellate cells, major fibrogenic cells in the liver. Hepatic stellate cells are activated by liver injury to express excessive matrix proteins and profibrogenic cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta 1. Medicines that inhibit this pathway may be of therapeutic potential in NASH. Using a methionine-choline-deficient rat model of NASH, we studied the potential utility of an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB), olmesartan, on biochemical, histologic, and antioxidant measures of disease activity.

Here, we characterized the vasodilator action of angiotensin-(1-7) in the isolated guinea pig heart. Angiotensin-(1-7) (1-10 nmol, bolus) induced dose-dependent increase in the coronary flow. The coronary vasodilation induced by angiotensin-(1-7) was significantly reduced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (100 microM) and abolished by a B(2) receptor antagonist, icatibant (100 nM). Coronary vasodilation induced by bradykinin (3 pmol, bolus) was inhibited by L-NAME and icatibant to similar extent as that induced by angiotensin-(1-7). Neither the selective AT(2) angiotensin receptor antagonist, PD123319 (1 microM), nor the antagonist of a putative angiotensin-(1-7) receptors, [D-alanine-7]-angiotensin-(1-7) (A-779, 1 microM), influenced the response to angiotensin-(1-7). In conclusion, in the isolated guinea pig heart angiotensin-(1-7) induces coronary vasodilation that is mediated by endogenous bradykinin and subsequent stimulation of nitric oxide release through endothelial B(2) receptors. In contrast to other vascular beds, AT(2) angiotensin receptors and specific angiotensin-(1-7) receptors do not appear involved in angiotensin-(1-7)-induced coronary vasodilation in the isolated guinea pig heart.",

With less tight (versus tight) control, the rates of other treatments and outcomes were the following: post-randomisation antenatal antihypertensive medication use: 46 (69.7%) versus 58 (89.2%), severe hypertension: 38 (57.6%) versus 26 (40.0%), proteinuria: 16 (24.2%) versus 20 (30.8%), serious maternal complications: 3 (4.6%) versus 2 (3.1%), preterm birth: 24 (36.4%) versus 26 (40.0%), birthweight: 2675 +/- 858 versus 2501 +/- 855 g, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission: 15 (22.7%) versus 22 (34.4%), and serious perinatal complications: 9 (13.6%) versus 14 (21.5%).", 
    "226": "The CHIPS pilot trial confirms the feasibility and importance of a large definitive trial to determine the effects of less tight control on serious perinatal and maternal complications."
