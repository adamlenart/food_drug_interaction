She had been undergoing treatment with methimazole for Graves's hyperthyroidism since the age of 34. Three months after discontinuation of methimazole she presented with clinical and laboratory evidence of thyrotoxicosis, with elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and blunted response to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH). This secondary hyperthyroidism was self-limited and resolved a few months later.",

    "3": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of sesame oil in hypertensive diabetics medicated with atenolol (beta-blocker) and glibenclamide (sulfonylurea). This open label trial with two intervention periods comprised 22 male and 18 female patients, 45-65 years old, with mild to moderate hypertension and diabetes. Sesame oil (Idhayam Gingelly oil, V.V.V. & Sons, Virudhunagar, Tamilnadu, India) was supplied to the patients, who were instructed to use it in place of other cooking oils for 45 days. Blood pressure (BP), anthropometric measurements, plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profiles [total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG)], lipid peroxidation [thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS)], electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and chloride), and enzymic (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase) and nonenzymic (vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and reduced glutathione) antioxidants were measured at baseline and after 45 days of sesame oil substitution. The same patients were then switched over to other oils like palm or groundnut oils as their regular oils at random for another 45 days, and the investigations were carried out again at the end. Systolic and diastolic BP decreased remarkably. When oil substitution was withdrawn, BP values rose again. Body weight, body mass index, girth of waist, girth of hip, and waist:hip ratio were reduced upon substitution of sesame oil. Plasma glucose, HbA1c, TC, LDL-C, and TG were decreased. TBARS level was reduced, while the activities of enzymic and the levels of nonenzymic antioxidants were increased. Plasma sodium levels were reduced, while potassium levels were elevated. These results indicate that substitution of sesame oil as the sole edible oil has an additive effect in further lowering BP and plasma glucose in hypertensive diabetics.", 
    "4": "Despite the recognized role of bradykinin (BK)-induced calcium and chloride conductance in regulating salt transport in the kidney, the signaling pathway involved has not been well examined. Patch clamp of murine proximal tubule (TKPTS) cells revealed that BK (10 nM) produced an increase in an outwardly rectifying current from a basal level of 2.9 +/- 0.6 to 13.8 +/- 1.1 pA/pF following addition of BK (n = 8; p < 0.001). The shift in reversal potential seen with BK on changing the intracellular solution to 152 mM chloride and significant inhibition of the current by 100 microM 4,4'-di-isothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS) suggested that BK activated a chloride current. BK-induced current was blocked by B2 receptor antagonist but not by B1 antagonist or pertussis toxin indicating that the current was mediated by B2 receptors possibly through Gq activation. TMB-8 completely blocked the BK-calcium rise in fura-2 studies but did not block the BK-chloride response indicating that BK-mediated chloride current is calcium-independent. BK-induced current was dependent on phospholipase C (PLC) since U73122, a PLC-beta blocker (10 microM) blocked it completely. Furthermore, chloride conductance was not modulated by bisindolylmaleimide, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), but was enhanced by dibutyryl cAMP. We conclude that BK-induced rise in chloride current is mediated by B2 receptors and dependent on PLC activation but not dependent on calcium rise. Furthermore, the current can be modulated by cAMP but not PKC.", 
    "5": "The Marfan's syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder resulting in a diminished strength of connective tissue. The ocular, skeletal and cardiovascular systems are mostly at risk. Principal complications of the disease are aortic dilatation and the risk of acute dissection. Pregnancy increases this risk. Based on the experience of our obstetrics department and after reviewing medical literature, we have tried to establish guidelines for obstetric care adapted to pregnant patients affected by Marfan's syndrome. Women with aortic root > 40 mm should avoid pregnancy. In all cases B-adrenergic receptor blockers must be used as soon as possible. Because there is a 50% risk that offspring will inherit the syndrome, prenatal diagnosis should be suggested. In addition to usual pregnancy monitoring, echocardiography should be performed every 3 months as well as 2 months after delivery. No increase of obstetrical complications has been shown in these patients. Route of delivery also depends on the diameter of the aortic root: vaginal delivery is warranted if the aortic root is<40; cesarean section should be performed in the other cases. Thus, with appropriate supervision, women with Marfan's syndrome will tolerate pregnancy without any adverse effect.",

    "7": "Fifty-three patients affected by migraine-related vertigo were selected from a cohort of 652 vertiginous patients referred to our Dizziness Unit from March 2001 to June 2005. Inclusion criteria were at least five vertigo attacks occurred in any period of time or dizziness and/or positional vertigo for at least 6 months; migraine, past or present, and/or a family history of migraine and/or motion intolerance; and exclusion of other causes. Patients were submitted to migraine pharmacologic prophylaxis selected on the basis of the characteristics of the patients and of the drug side effects. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated after 6 months by questionnaire divided into five outcome categories (resolution, substantial control, moderate control, minimal control, no improvement or worsening) and, for the patients with recurrent vertiginous attacks, also reporting the percentage reduction of the attack frequency.", 
    "8": "Thirty-six patients completed the study and were submitted to analysis of the results: 10 reported complete resolution of symptoms, 15 substantial control, 7 moderate control, one minimum control and 3 no improvement. Thirty-three of them had recurrent vertigo: 19 reported complete disappearance of the attacks, 8 reduction of the frequency >50%, 5 reduction <50%, and one no reduction.",

    "10": "We previously reported that nicotine promoted gastric cancer cell growth via upregulation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). In the present study, we further investigated whether beta-adrenoceptors, protein kinase C (PKC), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) were involved in the modulation of COX-2 expression and cell proliferation by nicotine in AGS, a human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line. Results showed that nicotine dose dependently increased the phosphorylation of EKR1/2 and the expression of AP-1 subunits c-fos and c-jun. In this connection, the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 abrogated the upregulation of AP-1 and COX-2 as well as cell proliferation induced by nicotine. Moreover, nicotine induced the translocation of PKC-betaI from cytosol to membrane and increased the total levels of PKC expression. Inhibition of PKC by staurosporine attenuated nicotine-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and COX-2 expression. Furthermore, atenolol and ICI 118,551, a beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, respectively, reversed the stimulatory action of nicotine on the expression of PKC, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and COX-2 together with cell proliferation. Collectively, these results suggest that nicotine stimulates gastric cancer cell growth through the activation of beta-adrenoceptors and the downstream PKC-betaI/ERK1/2/COX-2 pathway.", 
    "11": "Bleeding from the edge of an ileostomy site is a common problem. In those who have undergone a proctocolectomy with ileostomy formation in conjunction with a risk of chronic liver disease (even with normal liver function tests), this may be due to peristomal varices. If this is the case, significant, difficult-to-control and potentially life-threatening bleeding is likely in the future and may require transfusion. Improvements in radiological imaging techniques can give quick, sensitive and specific information to diagnose and guide management in this group. In those patients with major bleeding episodes, an initial conservative management policy should be adopted with the knowledge that, if bleeding persists, propanolol therapy, portosystemic shunt insertion or even liver transplantation may be indicated.",

Platelet function was measured with the platelet function analyzer (PFA-100; Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany) at baseline for collagen/adenosine diphosphate closure times (CADP-CT) and for collagen/epinephrine closure times (CEPI-CT) after infusion of a uniform dose of 250 mg aspirin.", 
    "14": "Of the conventional risk factors, only the prevalence of diabetes was higher in ACS patients with re-events. However, use of clopidogrel and use of beta blockers were also slightly lower in patients with re-events (P < 0.05). The unadjusted risk hazard ratio (HR) for re-events was 3.3 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.4-7.4; P = 0.005] in those patients with the shortest CADP-CT values (lowest quartile). Similarly, the risk was 2.0-fold higher (95% CI: 1.1-3.6; P = 0.02) in ACS patients with CEPI-CT < 300 s as compared with CEPI-CT >or = 300 s. Inclusion of diabetes, clopidogrel and beta blockers in a multivariate Cox regression model enhanced the predictive value of CEPI-CT (HR: 2.7). Inclusion of von Willebrand factor levels did not alter the HR for recurrent ACS (HR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1-5.2; P = 0.03) for CEPI-CT < 300 s, but reduced the HR for CADP-CT (HR: 2.8, 95% CI: 0.8-9.8; P = 0.11).",

    "17": "A retrospective analysis of national health statistics in Scotland from 1994 to 2004. The Scottish morbidity record was used to collect information on all episodes of trabeculectomy. Data on number of prescriptions were gathered for individual drugs and also for groups of active ingredient. The population likely to have glaucoma (PLG) was calculated from estimates of prevalence in individuals aged 40 years and older, based on published epidemiological studies. The outcome measures were trabeculectomy rates, corrected for population likely to be at risk of glaucoma (PLG), and prescribing volume and cost for glaucoma medications.",

The cost of prescribing has increased by 122% over 11 years compared with an increase in number of items per 1,000 PLG by 27.5%. In 1994, beta-blockers accounted for 65.2% of prescribed drugs but by 2004 this had dropped to 33%.

    "20": "The use of doping substances and methods is extensive not only among elite athletes, but also among amateur and recreational athletes. Many types of drugs are used by athletes to enhance performance, to reduce anxiety, to increase muscle mass, to reduce weight or to mask the use of other drugs during testing. However, the abuse of doping substances and methods has been associated with the occurrence of numerous health side-effects. The adverse effects depend on the type of the consumed drug, as well as the amount and duration of intake and the sensitivity of the body, since there is a large inter-individual variability in responses to a drug. Usually the doses used in sports are much higher than those used for therapeutic purposes and the use of several drugs in combination is frequent, leading to higher risk of side-effects. Among biomedical side-effects of doping, the cardiovascular ones are the most deleterious. Myocardial infarction, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, thrombosis, arrythmogenesis, heart failure and sudden cardiac death have been noted following drug abuse. This paper reviews the literature on the adverse cardiovascular effects after abuse of prohibited substances and methods in athletes, aiming to inform physicians, trainers and athletes and to discourage individuals from using drugs during sports.",

In multivariable analyses, patients not graduating from high school (odds ratio [OR], 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.60) were more likely to discontinue use of all medications. The effect of increasing age on medication therapy discontinuation was greater for females (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.34-2.34) than males (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02-1.47). Patients who discontinued use of all medications at 1 month had lower 1-year survival (88.5% vs 97.7%; log-rank P<.001) compared with patients who continued to take 1 or more medication(s). In multivariable survival analysis, medication therapy discontinuation was independently associated with higher mortality (hazards ratio, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.88-7.72). Results were consistent when evaluating discontinuation of use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and statins separately.", 
    "24": "Medication therapy discontinuation after MI is common and occurs early after discharge. Patients who discontinue taking evidence-based medications are at increased mortality risk.

    "25": "Left ventricular (LV) contraction dyssynchrony is not easily quantified. We previously described a model for quantifying LV dyssynchrony that referenced regional amplitude and phase angles to global LV systole using esmolol-induced regional dyskinesis. We tested the hypothesis that our sine wave model and phase angle analysis of regional dyssynchrony in a canine model could also assess dyssynchrony of contraction during regional ischemia. Hence we compared intracoronary esmolol and matched regional ischemia in 10 anesthetized open-chest dogs. Regional and total LV volumes (conductance catheter), piezoelectric crystal shortening, and LV pressures were measured before, during, and after esmolol-induced apical dyskinesis and matched regional ischemia. We defined regional phase angle of contraction (alpha) as the relative distance, measured in degrees, that regional minimal volume differed from global end-systole. We also compared maximal stroke volume (SV), observed effective SV (that portion of regional SV contributing to total SV for each treatment), and calculated effective SV (total regional SV x cosine alpha). Dobutamine infusion increased homogeneity of regional alpha relative to baseline. Both esmolol and ischemia significantly delayed (P < 0.05) apical contraction as quantified by increased alpha (12.4 degrees +/- 28.1 degrees to 27.4 degrees +/- 30.4 degrees and 54.2 degrees +/- 32.6 degrees , respectively) (mean +/- sd) and decreased regional effective SV (4.7 +/- 2.5 mL to 3.6 +/- 2.2 mL and 4 +/- 2.5 mL, respectively) relative to baseline. Our study indicates that intracoronary esmolol and ischemia induced qualitatively similar mechanical effects on myocardial function and that a sine wave model to estimate regional effective SV is a sensitive method to detect and quantify regional dyssynchrony induced by ischemia. Potentially, phase angle and regional amplitude analyses may prove to be effective measures to identify and quantify the beneficial effects of resynchronization therapies on myocardial function.",

Three thousand five hundred and eighty patients were entered into the database by the end of August 2005. Mean age was 70 years, and 61% of patients were male. New-onset AHF (de novo AHF) was diagnosed in 37%, of which 42% was due to acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Clinical classification according to the guidelines divided AHF patients into (i) decompensated HF (65%), (ii) pulmonary oedema (16%), (iii) HF and hypertension (11%), (iv) cardiogenic shock (4%), and (v) right HF (3%). Coronary heart disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation were the most common underlying conditions. Arrhythmias, valvular dysfunction, and ACS were each present as precipitating factor in one-third of cases. Preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (> or =45%) was observed in 34%. Valvular disorders were common, especially mitral regurgitation (MR) which was reported on echocardiography in 80% of patients. Median length of stay was 9 days, and in-hospital mortality 6.7%. At discharge, 80% of patients were on angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, whereas 61% were taking beta-blocker medication.", 
    "28": "Decompensated HF is the most common clinical presentation of AHF patients. More than one-third of AHF patients do not have a previous history of HF, and new-onset HF is often caused by ACS. Preserved systolic function is found in a substantial proportion of the patients. The prevalence of valvular dysfunction is strikingly high and contributes to the clinical presentation. The EHFS II on AHF verified that the use of evidence-based HF medication was well adopted to clinical practice.",

During follow-up, aortic elastic properties improved in 21 (70%) of 30 patients and deteriorated in 9 (30%) irrespective of beta-blocker dosage. Improvement was observed in 100% of patients (n = 7; age, 5.3 +/- 4.2 years) with end-diastolic aortic root diameters between 20 and 30 mm and in 61% of patients (14/23; age, 20.5 +/- 10.0 years) with root diameters between 30 and 52 mm.",

    "37": "Treatment with beta-blockers is recommended to achieve and maintain adequate blood pressure control in patients with hypertension, and these agents have been shown to decrease cardiovascular risk factors in patients with both hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, beta-blocker therapy also may worsen glycemic and lipidemic control and may lead to microalbuminuria. A recent study showed a better metabolic profile with carvedilol than with metoprolol in patients with both type 2 diabetes and hypertension in the presence of renin-angiotensin system blockade. This beneficial effect on metabolic components has been proposed as attributable to carvedilol's alpha-blocking effects or antioxidant properties. In this article, the pathophysiology of hypertension and type 2 diabetes and the association between them are reviewed, the pharmacologic properties of carvedilol are discussed, and clinical studies in the literature comparing carvedilol with selective beta-blockers in patients with both type 2 diabetes and hypertension are identified and evaluated. This information should be useful to practitioners when selecting the optimum beta-blocker for treating hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "38": "The vascular endothelium plays a fundamental role in the basal and dynamic regulation of the circulation. Thus, it has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. A spectrum of vasoactive substances is synthesised in the endothelium; of these, nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin (PGI2) and endothelin (ET)-1 are the most important. There is a continuous basal release of NO determining the tone of peripheral blood vessels. Systemic inhibition of NO synthesis or scavenging of NO through oxidative stress causes an increase in arterial blood pressure. Also, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has a major role in hypertension as it has a direct vasoconstrictor effect and important interactions with oxygen free radicals and NO. Prostacyclin, in contrast to NO, does not contribute to the maintenance of basal vascular tone of conduit arteries, but its effect on platelets is most important. ET acts as the natural counterpart to endothelium-derived NO and has an arterial blood pressure-raising effect in man. Anti-hypertensive therapy lowers blood pressure and may influence these different mediators, thus influencing endothelial function. In summary, due to its position between the blood pressure and smooth muscle cells responsible for peripheral resistance, the endothelium is thought to be both victim and offender in arterial hypertension. The delicate balance of endothelium-derived factors is disturbed in hypertension. Specific anti-hypertensive and anti-oxidant treatment is able to restore this balance.",

A model for unmeasured confounding is presented along with a family of prior distributions that model beliefs about a possible unknown unmeasured confounder. Simulation from the posterior distribution is accomplished using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Because the model for unmeasured confounding is not identifiable, standard large-sample theory for Bayesian analysis is not applicable. Consequently, the impact of different choices of prior distributions on the coverage probability of credible intervals is unknown. Using simulations, we investigate the coverage probability when averaged with respect to various distributions over the parameter space. The results indicate that credible intervals will have approximately nominal coverage probability, on average, when the prior distribution used for sensitivity analysis approximates the sampling distribution of model parameters in a hypothetical sequence of observational studies. We motivate the method in a study of the effectiveness of beta blocker therapy for treatment of heart failure.",

The results on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) showed that the combination of simvastatin and carvedilol was associated with a relative risk reduction of 53% (p<0.001), treatment with simvastatin alone with a relative risk reduction of 44% (p=0.001), and carvedilol alone with a relative risk reduction of 40% (p=0.003) compared with neither treatment. The independent predictors of 1-year MACE were neither treatment, elevated high sensitivity C-reactive protein (> or =0.5 mg/dl), and old age (>70 years).",

    "52": "Oxidative stress is an important susceptibility factor for dilated cardiomyopathy. We have investigated the effects of bisoprolol, a beta1-selective adrenoceptor blocker, on oxidative stress and the development of cardiac dysfunction in a model of dilated cardiomyopathy. Male TO-2 and control hamsters at 8 weeks of age were treated with bisoprolol (5 mg/kg per day) or vehicle for 4 weeks. Treatment with bisoprolol prevented the progression of cardiac dysfunction in TO-2 hamsters. This drug did not affect the increase in NADPH oxidase activity but prevented the reduction in activity and expression of mitochondrial manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase as well as the increases in the concentrations of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the left ventricle of TO-2 hamsters. Attenuation of the development of cardiac dysfunction by bisoprolol may thus result in part from normalization of the associated increases in the levels of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the left ventricle.", 
    "53": "Recommendations for the management of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction in the general population and patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) include the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers.

The goal of this study is to describe the use of these medications and investigate barriers to their use in dialysis patients.", 
    "54": "We prospectively studied 420 hemodialysis patients. Diagnosis of systolic dysfunction was based on echocardiogram results.

    "55": "Forty-seven patients (11%) were found to have an LV ejection fraction of 40% or less. Of those, 72% were administered a beta-blocker and 36% were administered an ACE inhibitor. Only 12 patients (25.5%) were administered a combination of beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor. Reasons indicated by nephrologists for not prescribing these medications were \"concern about adverse reactions (eg, hypotension, hyperkalemia)\" in 88% of cases, \"adequate control of symptoms with ultrafiltration\" in 38%, \"unproven benefit\" in 25%, and \"unfavorable risk-benefit ratio\" in 17%. Medication costs and concern about patient compliance were not identified as significant concerns by physicians.",

Sudden cardiac death was observed in 16 patients, 8 patients in each group. Previous myocardial infarction resulted in a 4.9-fold increased risk of sudden death (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 13.2). The use of beta blockers showed their protective nature (hazard ratio 0.2, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.9). The randomized treatment strategy, heart rhythm during follow-up, use of antiarrhythmic drugs, and number of stroke risk factors were not associated with sudden cardiac death. In conclusion, the treatment of underlying disease, rather than the heart rhythm, seems essential to prevent mortality.", 
    "58": "Statins have been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular events and overall mortality in primary and secondary prevention trials. This study was designed to examine the effect of statin use on overall death. Cross-sectional data were obtained from the Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Integrated Service Network 16 database for approximately 1.5 million veterans followed up in 10 hospitals in the southern United States. Statins were prescribed more often to elderly subjects with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, current smoking, and using cardiovascular drugs (beta blockers, aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers). The predictors of death were, as expected, cancer, diabetes mellitus, the use of cardiac drugs, and age. Importantly, using statins showed a highly significant negative association with death (odds ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 0.69, p <0.0001), even after adjustment for all other variables. Overall, the mean age at death among statin users was 2 years older than among nonstatin users, despite statin users being at a higher risk of death. In conclusion, the results of this study have shown that using statins is a potent life-saving strategy. The benefit observed in this study is unique because almost 1/2 the patients were >or=70 years of age when statin therapy was initiated.", 
    "59": "Knowledge of predictors of diabetes mellitus (DM) development in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who use antihypertensive therapy could contribute to decreasing this adverse metabolic consequence. This is particularly relevant because the standard of care, beta blockers combined with diuretics, may contribute to adverse metabolic risk. The INternational VErapamil SR-trandolapril STudy compared a calcium antagonist-based (verapamil SR) and a beta-blocker-based (atenolol) strategy with trandolapril and/or hydrochlorothiazide added to control blood pressure (BP) in patients with CAD. The 16,176 patients without DM at entry were investigated with regard to newly diagnosed DM during follow-up. Newly diagnosed DM was less frequent in the verapamil SR versus atenolol strategy (7.0% vs 8.2%, hazard ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.95, p <0.01). Characteristics associated with risk for newly diagnosed DM included United States residence, left ventricular hypertrophy, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack, Hispanic ethnicity, coronary revascularization, hypercholesterolemia, greater body mass index, and higher follow-up systolic BP. Addition of trandolapril to verapamil SR decreased DM risk and addition of hydrochlorothiazide to atenolol increased risk. In conclusion, clinical findings associated with more severe vascular disease and Hispanic ethnicity identify a group at high risk for developing DM, whereas lower on-treatment BP and treatment with verapamil SR-trandolapril attenuated this risk.",

In overdose, beta-blockers and CCBs have similar presentation and treatment overlaps and are often refractory to standard resuscitation measures. The common feature of beta-blocker toxicity is excessive blockade of the beta-receptors resulting in bradycardia and hypotension. Poisoning by CCBs is characterized by cardiovascular toxicity with hypotension and conduction disturbances, including sinus bradycardia and varying degrees of atrioventricular block. Therapies include beta-agonists, glucagon, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. However, in beta-blocker poisoning where symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension are present, high-dose glucagon is considered the first-line antidote. Traditionally, antidotes for CCB overdose have included calcium, glucagon, adrenergic drugs, and amrinone. For cases of CCB poisoning where cardiotoxicity is evident, first-line therapy is a combination of calcium and epinephrine; high-dose insulin with supplemental dextrose and potassium therapy (HDIDK) is reserved for refractory cases. Health-system pharmacists should be aware that when these drugs are used as antidotes, higher than normal dosing is needed.",

The whole-cell perforated patch-clamp technique was used to record L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)), action potential duration (APD) and arrhythmic activity at 37 degrees C in enzymatically isolated atrial cells obtained from patients undergoing cardiac surgery, in SR or with chronic AF. In the AF group, 5-HT (10microM) produced an increase in I(CaL) of 115+/-21% above control (n=10 cells, 6 patients) that was significantly smaller than that in the SR group (232+/-33%; p<0.05; n=27 cells, 12 patients). Subsequent co-application of isoproterenol (1microM) caused a further increase in I(CaL) in the AF group (by 256+/-94%) that was greater than that in the SR group (22+/-6%; p<0.05). The APD at 50% repolarisation (APD(50)) was prolonged by 14+/-3ms by 5-HT in the AF group (n=37 cells, 14 patients). This was less than that in the SR group (27+/-4ms; p<0.05; n=58 cells, 24 patients). Arrhythmic activity in response to 5-HT was observed in 22% of cells in the SR group, but none was observed in the AF group (p<0.05). Atrial fibrillation was associated with reduced effects of 5-HT, but not of isoproterenol, on I(CaL) in human atrial cells. This reduced effect on I(CaL) was associated with a reduced APD(50) and arrhythmic activity with 5-HT. Thus, the potentially arrhythmogenic influence of 5-HT may be suppressed in AF-remodelled human atrium.",

During his presurgical evaluation for \"refractory epilepsy\", one typical event was captured that was associated with asystole and normal electroencephalogram. The diagnosis of vasodepressor syncope was made and anticonvulsant medication was discontinued.

After the arrest, both patients regained consciousness and were discharged home. The chronotropic and inotropic effects of PDE III inhibitors are due to inhibition of intracellular PDEIII and are therefore unaffected by beta-blockers. These cases suggest that PDEIII inhibitors may be useful in restoring spontaneous circulation in cardiac arrest associated with beta-blocker administration when standard ALS is ineffective.",

Variations of both intervals had similar wave structure (power spectrum) and similar reactions to noise stimulus. Atropine pronouncedly decreased all components of the spectra in the high, low, and very low frequency ranges. It eliminated the reactions of both intervals to noise stimulation. In RR intervals, the high-frequency spectrum component decreased more strongly than the low-frequency ones. By contrast, in AV intervals atropine most greatly decreased the very-low-spectrum component, while the high frequency was decreased less of all. Propranolol produced no effect on the response to noise. It did not decrease components of the wave structure in both intervals, except for the very-low-frequency peak of AV interval.

Here we tested this notion by analyzing radical scavenging properties of selected beta-adrenolytic drugs and their ability to release nitric oxide in biological preparations. Selective beta1-adrenolytics such as nebivolol, atenolol, metoprolol and non-selective beta-adrenolytics with alpha1-receptor blocking properties such as carvedilol and labetalol were chosen for analysis. NO-releasing properties of nebivolol and carvedilol distinguished third generation beta-adrenolytics from their older counterparts while the reactivity towards hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals discerns only carvedilol but not nebivolol. Thus, superior clinical efficacy of third generation beta-adrenolytics may be related to their ability to release NO rather then to their direct antioxidant properties.", 
    "100": "AICAR (5-amino-1-beta-D: -ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide) is an adenosine analog which improves the recovery of the heart after ischemia. In some tissues AICAR enters cells and stimulates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We explored the mechanism of cardioprotection in isolated rat hearts. We confirmed that AICAR (0.5 mM) applied 10 min prior to a 30-min period of ischemia and present throughout ischemia and reperfusion caused a substantial improvement in the recovery of developed pressure on reperfusion. However, adenosine (100 microM) produced no improvement, suggesting that the mechanism of action of AICAR was not increased endogenous adenosine production. Measurements of intracellular sodium concentration ([Na(+)](i)) showed that AICAR prevented the rapid rise of [Na(+)](i), which normally occurs on reperfusion. Inhibitors of the cardiac sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE1) also protect the heart from ischemic damage and also prevent the rapid rise of [Na(+)](i) on reperfusion, suggesting that AICAR might cause the inhibition of NHE1. We tested this possibility on isolated rat ventricular myocytes in which the recovery of pH(i) after NH(4)Cl exposure provides a measure of NHE1 activity. AICAR (0.5 micromM) inhibited NHE1 activity in response to an acid load by about 80%. To test whether the AICAR-induced inhibition of NHE1 arose through adenosine, we used the adenosine receptor blocker 8-sulfophenyltheophylline (8-SPT) and found that it had no measureable effect. To test whether the AICAR-induced inhibition of NHE1 might occur through the activation of AMPK, we measured the activity of two isoforms of AMPK. Surprisingly, activity was reduced, whereas in many other tissues AICAR increases AMPK activity. Furthermore, this effect of AMPK was blocked by 8-SPT, suggesting that the inhibition of AMPK arose through an adenosine-receptor-related pathway. We conclude that AICAR inhibits NHE1 through an unidentified pathway. This inhibition may make a contribution to the cardioprotective effects of AICAR.", 
    "101": "Monitoring national patterns of antihypertensive drug therapy is essential to assessing adherence to treatment guidelines and the impact of major scientific publications on physician prescribing. We analyzed data from 2 US National Ambulatory Care Surveys to examine trends between 1993 and 2004 in the prescription of antihypertensive drug classes for uncomplicated hypertension and the association between thiazide and beta-blocker prescribing and physician and patient characteristics. Diuretic prescriptions remained level through 2001 (39%; 95% CI: 34% to 44%) but increased to 53% (48% to 58%) in 2003, largely because of a 72% increase in thiazide prescriptions in the first quarter of 2003 (50%; 95% CI: 40% to 59%). However, these increases did not sustain in 2004. Beta-blocker prescriptions increased modestly from 1993 (24%; 95% CI: 19% to 29%) to 2004 (33%; 95% CI: 28% to 39%). Prescription of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors declined significantly following the sixth Joint National Committee report, but both subsequently rebounded to prereport levels. Prescription of angiotensin II receptor blockers increased continuously from 1% in 1995 to 23% by 2004. Polytherapy prescriptions, particularly those involving > or = 3 drug classes, became increasingly prevalent, accounting for 60% of antihypertensive drug visits by 2004. Prescriptions of thiazides and beta-blockers were both more likely in 1998-2004 (versus 1993-1997). Blacks, women, and hospital outpatients were more likely to receive thiazides. Also, cardiologists were more likely to prescribe beta-blockers. Evidence-based guidelines for antihypertensive drug therapy do impact physician prescribing, but the impact seems to be short lived. Future interventions are imperative for promoting long-term adherence to published guidelines.",

The modern third generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, not only has a favourable antihypertensive and anti-ischemic effect, but anti-atherosclerosis properties as well. There are plenty of evidence which demonstrate that lisinopril, a first line antihypertensive agent, has a positive effect in the treatment of left ventricular hypertrophy, retinopathy and nephropathy, and also has a favourable outcome after myocardial infarction and in heart failure. The combined administration of the two drugs leads to a favourable additive effect, with a decrease in the number and severity of side effects. The results of the ASCOT study proved a favourable effect with amlodipine based, combination therapy with an ACE-inhibitor, compared with the traditional beta-blockers and diuretics. The data of the CAFE sub-study showed, that in spite of the similar peripheral antihypertensive effect, the amlodipine based therapy decreased the central aortic pulse pressure to a greater extent. The central aortic pressure showed a good correlation with the end-points of the study, respectively. The results of the Hungarian multicenter study (HAMLET) proved the effective and safe administration of the two drugs in combination. Based on the above evidence, the fixed-dose combination of the CCB-ACE inhibitor (amlodipine-lisinopril) has not only effective blood pressure reducing properties, but also results in cardiovascular risk reduction, good tolerability and favourable compliance.",

    "110": "All three drugs similarly reduced maximal rate of increase of left ventricular pressures (LV+dP/dt(max)) by approximately 10%, but diversely modified the force-interval relationship. The parameter c (the reduction in LV+dP/dt(max) of a fixed premature stimulus on mechanical restitution) was significantly reduced by metoprolol (by 9+/- 4%, p < 0.05), was increased by verapamil (by 6 +/- 2%, p < 0.05), and was not significantly changed by sotalol. Similarly, metoprolol had a minimal effect on the extent of frequency potentiation, whereas sotalol and verapamil attenuated frequency potentiation (the relative response to 10 s of rapid pacing was 1.19 +/- 0.58-fold, 0.07 +/- 0.35-fold, and 0.03 +/- 0.17-fold of the baseline response after 10 min of metoprolol, sotalol, or verapamil, respectively).",

    "112": "Preeclampsia and eclampsia continue to be major causes of maternal death. Currently, approximately 18% of U.S. maternal deaths are attributed to hypertensive disorders and eclampsia, and several hundred women die from eclampsia and its complications every year. In the United States, preeclamptic women have received magnesium sulfate as a seizure prophylaxis agent for 3 decades, and this practice is becoming more widely accepted internationally. In addition to a recognized failure rate, there are financial, logistic, and safety concerns associated with the universal administration of magnesium sulfate. Many institutions in the developing world lack the necessary equipment and expertise to administer the medication, and many preeclamptic patients thus do not receive magnesium sulfate before their first seizure. As effective as it has been in reducing mortality from eclampsia, magnesium sulfate is also associated with appreciable morbidity and mortality from administration errors and magnesium toxicity. The availability of an easily administered, cheap, safe, and orally administered alternative to magnesium sulfate would be welcomed in the developing world and would provide an extremely useful alternative therapy to the current standard of care. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and eclampsia, primarily related to cerebral perfusion and blood flow, could allow us to reduce the seizure rate in treated preeclamptic women even further than what is currently reported. This article deals with the rationale behind the use of labetalol as an alternative to magnesium sulfate for the prevention of eclampsia.",

    "115": "Peri-operative beta-blockade has been shown to reduce the incidence of postoperative cardio- vascular complications including cardiac death in high-risk non-cardiac surgical patients. However, the recent analysis by Lindenauer et al. suggests that it is inappropriate to administer beta-blockers blindly to all surgical patients. In an attempt to determine the appropriateness of peri-operative beta-blocker administration across patients with a spectrum of cardiovascular risks, we have examined studies of intermediate-risk patient groups (that is those undergoing intermediate risk surgery or those with a Lee Revised Cardiac Risk Score of < or =2). We analysed data from randomised prospective studies of the effects of acute peri-operative beta-blockade on the incidence of peri-operative myocardial ischaemia. By examining the demographics and surgical interventions in these patients, we have compared these studies with other studies of peri-operative silent myocardial ischaemia representing patients of similar risk. We thus estimated the expected long-term postoperative cardiovascular complication rate associated with myocardial ischaemia in these patients in terms of number needed to treat for ischaemia prevention and for prevention of major cardiovascular complications. Prevention of peri-operative myocardial ischaemia with acute beta-blockade in non-cardiac surgical patients with 1-2 RCRI clinical risk factors can be achieved with a number needed to treat of 10. It is not associated with a significant increase in drug associated side-effects. However, acute beta-blockade shows no real benefit in the prevention of major cardiovascular complications in intermediate risk non-vascular surgical patients with a number-needed-to-treat of 833. Vascular surgical patients undergoing intermediate-risk surgery may benefit from the protective effects of acute peri-operative beta-blockade, however, with a number-needed-to-treat of 68 it would require a randomised clinical trial of over 24,000 patients to prove their efficacy.",

We examined the effect of epithelium removal on the beta-adrenoceptor desensitization resulting from incubation of guinea pig trachea in the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (10 microM). Desensitization was measured as the change in EC50, the concentration of beta-agonist that produced 50% relaxation of tracheal rings contracted with methacholine. As a second measure of desensitization, we measured the shift in EC50 resulting from incubation of tracheal rings with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (20 nM), expressed as CR-1 ([post-propranolol EC50/baseline EC50]-1). Initially, we measured desensitization immediately after incubation in isoprenaline; subsequently, we repeated the protocol and allowed a 30 min rest between the end of incubation and the measurement. The sensitivity of denuded epithelium trachea to isoprenaline and (CR-1) was significantly higher than that of intact epithelium only in non-incubated preparations (p<0.05 to p<0.001). Incubation to isoprenaline caused a significant reduction in the tracheal response to isoprenaline in both the denuded groups (p<0.005 for both cases) and intact epithelium groups (p<0.05 for both cases). Incubation to isoprenaline also caused a significant reduction in (CR-1) value in both the denuded groups (p<0.005 for group 2 and p<0.001 for group 4) and intact epithelium only in group 1 (p<0.05). However, the changes in EC50 due to tissue incubation with isoprenaline were significantly greater in denuded than intact epithelium trachea (p<0.05 for all cases) and for CR-1 value only in groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). These results indicate decrease in both tracheal response to beta-agonist (tolerance) and CR-1 (due to incubation of tissues with isoprenaline), which were greater in denuded epithelium groups.",

    "123": "Differentiation of myofibroblast, as evidenced by alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression, is largely mediated by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). This mechanism often follows inflammatory events such as endothelial damage due to oxidative stress, which can further leads to vascular thickening, stiffness, and fibrosis. We hypothesized that hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-induced oxidative stress lead to vascular stiffness, in part due to endothelial-myofibroblast differentiation and alteration of collagen homeostasis in the extracellular matrix (ECM). We tested our hypothesis in vitro using mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAEC). Our result shows that Hcy induces alpha-SMA and collagen type-1 expression in MAEC as evidenced by immunoblot and confocal imaging. RT-PCR shows robust increase of alpha-SMA and collagen type-1 mRNA level in Hcy-induced condition. We demonstrated that Hcy induces autophosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (a member of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) family) at Tyr-397. PP2 (general PTK inhibitor) as well as FAK siRNA abrogates Hcy-mediated alpha-SMA formation. In addition to that, Hcy-mediated TGF-beta1 induction was inhibited by TGF-beta R1 kinase inhibitor II (ALK5 inhibitor II) and attenuated FAK phosphorylation and alpha-SMA expression. Furthermore, we showed that Hcy activates ERK-44/42 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway and augments collagen type-1 deposition. Studies with pharmacological ERK blocker, PD98059 and ERK siRNA attenuated ERK-44/42 phosphorylation and collagen type-1 synthesis. Taken together our results demonstrate that Hcy-mediated TGF-beta1 upregulation triggers endothelial-myofibroblast differentiation secondary to FAK phosphorylation and that Hcy-induced ERK activation is involved in ECM remodeling by altering collagen type-1 homeostasis.",

In this paper, we review four experimental agents that promise to advance therapeutics by one of these mechanisms. Aliskiren is the first in a new class of potent, orally effective renin inhibitors. Aliskiren produces dose-dependent BP reduction with few side effects and constitutes a novel pharmacologic approach to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibition. Nebivolol is a third-generation, cardioselective beta-blocker that produces vasodilation and improves endothelial function via the l-arginine/nitric oxide pathway. Clevidipine is an ultra-short-acting, vascular-selective, dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that is being developed for intravenous use in acute hospitalized patients. Darusentan is an endothelin(A) selective endothelin receptor antagonist that is effective in achieving BP control in a significant percentage of patients who remain uncontrolled despite treatment with three or more antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "169": "Hypertension is the second leading attributable cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States today. The African-American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension was a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to determine whether strict blood pressure (BP) control, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-based, or calcium channel blocker (CCB)-based regimens were superior to less strict BP control and beta-blocker (BB)-based regimens, respectively. The study enrolled 1093 African Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis and followed them for 4 years with repeated direct measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and monitoring of end points, including rapid decline in GFR, end-stage kidney disease, and death. From this landmark study, we learned that strict BP control is achievable in this study population, but it did not slow progression of kidney disease, and we learned that an ACEI-based therapy was superior to either a BB- or CCB-based regimen. In addition, we learned that proteinuria is the most important predictor of progression of kidney disease; ACEI and CCB have differential effects on proteinuria; and a CCB-based regimen combined with strict BP control may be the next best choice to an ACEI-based regimen in this population.", 
    "170": "Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is the dominant form of hypertension in the elderly. It is associated with increased arterial pulse pressure, to which an early-returning and magnified pulse-wave reflection makes an important contribution. Treatment of ISH with diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and angiotensin II inhibitors is effective in reducing systolic blood pressure, preventing cardiovascular morbid events, and lowering mortality; these agents may have to be used in combination to achieve the systolic blood pressure goal of < 140 mm Hg. Treatment with beta-blockers appears to be less effective. The relative efficacy of various classes of antihypertensive drugs for lowering pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure is determined in part by their differing abilities to reduce pulse-wave reflection. In patients with ISH that is refractory to dual or triple therapy, measurement of the reflected wave by applanation tonometry may be useful in determining which additional antihypertensive agent to use.", 
    "171": "To investigate the haemodynamic response to and clinical safety and tolerability of intravenous esmolol (Brevibloc), Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) in elderly and younger patients with acute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and heart failure.", 
    "172": "We studied 24 consecutive patients, 12 of them elderly (> or =75 years old) and 12 younger (32-74 years old), with NSTEMI and symptoms of heart failure on presentation. After stabilisation of the patient's condition with standard therapy, intravenous esmolol was administered. An infusion rate of 0.05 mg/kg/min for 30 minutes was instituted and, if no adverse effects developed, this was increased to 0.20 mg/kg/min. All haemodynamic parameters were measured before and at the end of each administration using a Swan-Ganz catheter.", 
    "173": "Only one patient in the elderly subgroup did not tolerate the augmented infusion rate (because of severe bradycardia) and so had to return to the initial lower infusion rate. The cardiac index (mean +/- SD) was 2.4 +/- 0.9 L/min/m(2) at baseline and decreased to 1.9 +/- 0.4 L/min/m(2) (p < 0.05 vs baseline) at the end of the administration of the second dose of esmolol in the elderly patients and 2.6 +/- 0.5 L/min/m(2) and 2.2 +/- 0.5 L/min/m(2) (p < 0.05 vs baseline), respectively, in the younger patients. Mean pulmonary wedge pressure was 17 +/- 6mm Hg at baseline and increased to 19 +/- 4mm Hg (p < 0.05 vs baseline) at the end of the second dose of esmolol in the elderly patients and 16 +/- 10mm Hg and 18 +/- 10mm Hg (p < 0.05 vs baseline), respectively, in the younger patients. The response of both age groups to esmolol was the same for all of the parameters examined.", 
    "174": "Intravenous esmolol was safe and well tolerated in the early phase of NSTEMI in patients presenting with symptoms of heart failure and ongoing ischaemia, regardless of their age.", 
    "175": "Thiazide diuretics are known to induce a transient fall of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which, in turn, reduces tubular Na(+) load. This tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) curtails the natriuretic effect of this class of diuretics. Cardiovascular and antiinflammatory therapeutics may interfere with TGF and thereby influence the effect of thiazides once co-administration is clinically indicated.", 
    "176": "The effects on GFR and saluresis of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT; 25 mg) monotherapy were measured in healthy volunteers and compared to those obtained during co-administration of the thiazide and a second therapeutic.", 
    "177": "In the presence of the ACE inhibitor enalapril (10 mg), the transient fall in the GFR induced by HCT was almost abolished, and Na(+) excretion increased by approximately 30 % as compared to HCT monotherapy. K(+) excretion, however, remained unchanged. Similar results were obtained with the AT II type 1 receptor antagonist candesartan (8 mg): GFR remained stable, Na(+) excretion rose by 35 % and K(+) excretion was not changed. The effect of the Ca(2+) channel blocker amlodipine (5 mg) on GFR and HCT-induced Na(+) excretion equalled that obtained with the AT(1) blocker, yet with this treatment K(+) excretion rose in proportion to Na(+) excretion. The beta-blockers propranolol (80 mg) or bisoprolol (5 mg) reduced GFR but maintained TGF. HCT-induced Na(+) excretion was significantly reduced in the presence of a beta-blocker, whereas K(+) excretion was not changed. The inhibition of cyclooxygenase by diclofenac (50 mg) or rofecoxib (25 mg) significantly reduced the diuretic/natriuretic effect of HCT, but K(+) excretion was unchanged, and TGF was still demonstrable.", 
    "178": "In conclusion, AT(1) receptors, as well as the Ca(2+) channels in the smooth muscle cells of the afferent arteriole, are considered prerequisites for TGF function; their blockade increases the diuretic/natriuretic efficacy of thiazide diuretics. In contrast, beta-blockers and COX inhibitors do not interfere directly with TGF. These first dose effects reflect the primary response of the kidney to the drugs. They cannot, however, predict the benefits of long-term treatment.", 
    "179": "Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by low bone mass, impaired micro-architecture and susceptibility to fracture. Osteoporosis may be, inter alia, a result of a long-term glucocorticosteroid therapy, e.g. with prednisolone. Although a number of properties of prednisolone in influencing bone metabolism have been recognized, the effect of prednisolone-induced osteoporosis on the function of blood circulation and autonomic nervous system in bones remains open. In order to clarify this problem, the present study concentrated on the effects of catecholamines on intramedullary pressure in rats with prednisolone-induced osteoporosis. Prednisolone was administered to male Wistar rats at the doses of 5 mg/kg im, for 3 weeks. Norepinephrine, epinephrine, isoprenaline as well as adrenoceptor antagonists (phentolamine and propranolol) were administered to the controls and to the rats with prednisolone-induced osteoporosis. The examinations demonstrated that rats with prednisolone-induced osteoporosis displayed a decreased intramedullary pressure. In addition, a disordered effect of catecholamines on intramedullary pressure of osteoporotic bone was observed.", 
    "180": "Transdermal therapeutic systems (TTSs) were studied applying different sucrose fatty acid esters (SEs) as drug delivery agents. Matrix and membrane controlled TTSs were prepared and compared. Membrane was made from a methacrylic polymer (Eudragit NE) of pH independent permeability which can achieve diffusion controlled drug liberation. Model drug was a water soluble beta-blocker, metoprolol, which has short biological half-life, so applying it in a TTS, the duration of its action could be prolonged. Sucrose fatty acid esters of different fatty acid chain lengths and consequently different hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values were studied considering their effect on the metoprolol release from TTSs. Different mathematical models were applied for the evaluation of the release process. The results of the in vitro studies indicated that SEs of shorter fatty acid chain length and higher HLB value increased the amount of released drug about 10 times. SEs could be promising agents in transdermal therapeutic systems to control the drug release and cutaneous absorption.", 
    "181": "Calcium signaling is important for multiple events during embryonic development. However, roles of calcium influx during embryogenesis have not been fully understood since routes of calcium influx are often redundant. To define roles of voltage-gated calcium channel (Cav) during embryogenesis, we have isolated an ascidian Cav beta subunit gene (TuCavbeta) and performed gene knockdown using the morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MO). The suppression of Cav activity by TuCavbetaMO remarkably perturbed gastrulation and tail elongation. Further, larvae with normal morphology also failed to exhibit motility. Phalloidin-staining showed that arrangement of myofibrils was uncoordinated in muscle cells of TuCavbetaMO-injected larvae with normal tail. To further understand the roles of Cav activity in myofibrillogenesis, we tested pharmacological inhibitions with ryanodine, curare, and N-benzyl-p-toluensulphonamide (BTS). The treatment with ryanodine, an intracellular calcium release blocker, did not significantly affect the motility and establishment of the myofibril orientation. However, treatment with curare, an acetylcholine receptor blocker, and BTS, an actomyosin ATPase specific inhibitor, led to abnormal motility and irregular orientation of myofibrils that was similar to those of TuCavbetaMO-injected larvae. Our results suggest that contractile activation regulated by voltage-dependent calcium influx but not by intracellular calcium release is required for proper arrangement of myofibrils.", 
    "182": "An increase in intracellular calcium transients is responsible for the positive inotropic effect of insulin on human myocardium, but the mechanisms involved in this increase in [Ca2+]i remain unclear.", 
    "183": "We studied isolated trabeculae or cardiomyocytes from end-stage failing hearts of 38 patients undergoing heart transplantation. The effect of insulin on isometric twitch force (37 degrees C, 0.5 Hz) and L-type Ca2+ current (whole-cell voltage clamp) was assessed.", 
    "184": "Crystalline insulin increased the contractile force in a dose-dependent manner (0.01 to 10 micromol/liter), with a maximum increase of 45 +/- 8% (p < 0.05) at 1 micromol/liter. It also increased L-type Ca2+ peak current density by 26 +/- 6% (p < 0.05). This insulin-mediated positive inotropic effect was unchanged in the presence of propranolol (1 micromol/liter). Positive inotropy was partially independent of glucose. L-type Ca2+ channel blockade (diltiazem, 5 micromol/liter), and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-release channel blockade (ryanodine, 0.1 micromol/liter) did not affect the inotropic response to insulin. However, blockade of SR Ca2+-ATPase (cyclopiazonic acid, 10 micromol/liter), inhibition of Na+-H+ exchange (HOE642, 10 micromol/liter), and inhibition of Na+-Ca2+ exchange (SEA0400, 1 micromol/liter) partially prevented the inotropic response to insulin.", 
    "185": "Positive inotropy of insulin was not related to catecholamine release and subsequent stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptor, but it may enhance the activity of SR Ca2+-ATPase and trans-sarcolemmal Ca2+ entry, mainly via reverse-mode Na+-Ca2+ exchange and insulin-mediated activation of Na+-H+ exchange. We hypothesize that these changes in [Ca2+]i might be secondary to the activation of reverse-mode Na+-Ca2+ exchange, presumably via elevated intracellular Na+ concentration."
