Because atenolol is the \u03b2-blocker used in 75% of these studies, uncertainty about widespread application to all \u03b2-blockers exists. Different pharmacological and physiological properties, both within \u03b2-blockers and compared with other antihypertensives, may explain divergent effects. Evidence shows that \u03b2-blockers have a truncated effect on central aortic pressure, an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, compared with other antihypertensive classes; differences within the class may exist, but the evidence is inconclusive. Metabolic effects differ within the \u03b2-blocker class, with evidence that carvedilol causes less metabolic dysregulation.",

    "5": "Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling represents a suitable method for pharmacokinetic studies in rats, particularly if serial sampling is needed. To study the pharmacokinetics of drugs in a rat heart failure (HF) model, we developed and validated a method for the simultaneous determination of bisoprolol, ramiprilat, propranolol and midazolam in DBS samples. Bisoprolol and ramipril are widely used in the treatment of HF, and midazolam and propranolol are markers of hepatic metabolism, which can be altered in HF. A 20\u03bcL sample of rat blood was pipetted onto Whatman 903 Protein Saver Card and allowed to dry. The whole spot was excised and 300\u03bcL of solvent (methanol with 10% ultrapure water and 0.1% formic acid) was added. After mixing and incubating the sample in an ultrasonic bath, a mixture of isotopically labeled internal standards was added. After centrifugation, the extracts were cleaned on an Ostro\u2122 plate and analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. The method was successfully validated. No significant interference was observed in the retention times of analytes or internal standards. The intraday and interday accuracy and precision were within a \u00b115% interval. The method was linear in the range 5-250\u03bcg/L and the lower limit of quantification was 5\u03bcg/L for all four analytes. The absolute matrix effect ranged from 98.7% for midazolam to 121% for ramiprilat. The recovery was lowest for ramiprilat and highest for propranolol. Samples were stable at all tested temperatures. The method has been used successfully in a real-time pharmacokinetic study in rats.",

Our aim was to assess those changes and associated factors in a population-based, prospective study.", 
    "7": "Data from the population-based, CoLaus study, conducted among subjects initially aged 35-75\u00a0years and living in Lausanne, Switzerland. 772 hypertensive subjects (371 women) were followed for a median of 5.4\u00a0years. Data Subjects were defined as continuers (no change), switchers (one antihypertensive class replaced by another), combiners (one antihypertensive class added) and discontinuers (stopped treatment). The distribution and the factors associated with changes in antihypertensive drug treatment were assessed.", 
    "8": "During the study period, the prescription of diuretics decreased and of ARBs increased: at baseline, diuretics were taken by 46.9% of patients; angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) by 44.7%, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) by 28.8%, beta-blockers (BB) by 28.0%, calcium channel blockers (CCB) by 18.9% and other antihypertensive drugs by 0.3%. At follow-up (approximately 5\u00a0years later), their corresponding percentages were 42.8%, 51.7%, 25.5%, 33.0% 20.7% and 1.0%. Among all participants, 54.4% (95% confidence interval: 50.8-58.0) were continuers, 26.9% (23.8-30.2) combiners, 12.7% (10.4-15.3) switchers and 6.0% (4.4-7.9) discontinuers. Combiners had higher systolic blood pressure values at baseline than the other groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Almost one third (30.6%) of switchers and 29.3% of combiners improved their blood pressure status at follow-up, versus 18.8% of continuers and 8.7% of discontinuers (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Conversely, almost one third (28.3%) of discontinuers became hypertensive (systolic \u2265140\u00a0mm Hg or diastolic \u226590\u00a0mm Hg), vs. 22.1% of continuers, 16.3% of switchers and 11.5% of combiners (p\u2009<\u20090.001).

    "10": "Blood pressure (BP) is monitored and managed to prevent cardiovascular complications of hypertension, but BP variability (BPV) has not been sufficiently studied. This analysis assessed whether patients receiving amlodipine vs other antihypertensive agents had lower BPV after \u226512\u00a0weeks of treatment. Studies were included if individual subject data were available, had \u22651 active comparator, and treatment duration was \u226512\u00a0weeks. BPV was assessed using standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) of systolic BP across visits from 12\u00a0weeks. Individual trial and meta-analyses were performed for SD- and CV-based methodology. Five studies (47,558 BPV-evaluable patients) were included. Patient characteristics were largely consistent across the studies, but BP measurements varied from \u223c4\u00a0months to \u223c6\u00a0years. BPV with amlodipine was significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) lower vs atenolol and lisinopril; significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) lower than enalapril in one study and numerically, but not significantly lower in another; and similar to chlorthalidone and losartan. Meta-analysis revealed a treatment difference (standard error) for amlodipine vs all active comparators of -1.23 (0.46; P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) mm Hg using SD and -0.86 (0.31; P\u00a0=\u00a0.005) using CV. These findings suggest that amlodipine is effective for minimizing BPV. Future studies need to confirm a causal link between BPV and cerebrovascular/cardiovascular outcomes.", 
    "11": "\u03b2-Adrenergic receptor blockers or \u03b2-blockers represent one of the oldest classes of cardiovascular agents and have been considered a cornerstone therapy for hypertension and heart disease for the past 5 decades. They are advocated as a first-line treatment for uncomplicated essential hypertension in patients younger than 60 years of age as recommended by the Canadian Hypertension Education Program. However, despite the well-established antihypertensive and cardiovascular benefits of \u03b2-blockers, a number of studies argue that they might not have the same clinical advantages of other classes of agents in terms of morbidity/mortality outcomes. This review will focus on the heterogeneity of the pharmacologic characteristics of \u03b2-blockers, and we will discuss the metabolic and hemodynamic differences within the \u03b2-blocker class and try to assess the potential implications of these differences for optimal selection in hypertension.", 
    "12": "We describe the case of a 45-year-old female patient with coronary fistulas arising from both the left and right coronary artery system and emptying in the left ventricle. Only sporadically do coronary artery fistulas drain into the left ventricle. In our patient, the most likely explanation of the fistulous communications was a congenital cause. We review the literature on coronary cameral fistulas and discuss the etiology of the diagnostic findings. Small coronary artery fistulas are generally well-tolerated and should impose no significant restriction on daily routine and activities. Nevertheless, small fistulas may under certain conditions produce a \"steal\" phenomenon and shunt blood flow away from the myocardial capillary network, causing ischemia.", 
    "13": "\u03b2-Blockers are used for a wide range of diseases from hypertension to glaucoma. In some diseases/conditions all \u03b2-blockers are effective, while in others only certain subgroups are therapeutically beneficial. The best-documented example for only a subset of \u03b2-blockers showing clinical efficacy is in heart failure, where members of the class have ranged from completely ineffective, to drugs of choice for treating the disease. Similarly, \u03b2-blockers were tested in murine asthma models and two pilot clinical studies. A different subset was found to be effective for this clinical indication. These findings call into question the current system of classifying these drugs. To consider '\u03b2-blockers', as a single class is misleading when considering their rigorous pharmacological definition and their appropriate clinical application.", 
    "14": "Since pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activities of drugs are often related to their interactions with biomembranes, it is of high interest to establish an approach for the characterization of these interactions at the molecular level. For the present study, beta-blockers (oxprenolol, propranolol, and acebutolol) were selected due to their well described nonspecific membrane effects (NME). Their interactions with model lipid membranes composed of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) were studied using Time-Dependent Fluorescence Shift (TDFS) and Generalized Polarization (GP) as well as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Liposomal vesicles were labeled with fluorescent membrane polarity probes (Laurdan, Prodan, and Dtmac). Increasing beta-blocker concentrations (0-10 mM for acebutolol and oxprenolol, and 0-1.5 mM for propranolol) significantly rigidifies the lipid bilayer at the glycerol and headgroup level, which was detected in the steady-state and in the time-resolved fluorescence data. The effects of propranolol were considerably stronger than those of the two other beta-blockers. The addition of fluorescent probes precisely located at different levels within the lipid bilayer revealed the insertion of the beta-blockers into the POPC bilayer at the glycerol backbone level, which was further confirmed by MD simulations in the case of propranolol.",

There are hundreds of secondary headache diagnoses and this article is not an exhaustive discussion of secondary headache disorders. Maintaining a high level of virulence and having a structured approach to evaluating all patients with headache is the key to timely diagnosis of secondary headache disorders. Diagnostic testing is indicated based on the suspected disorder and management is determined by treatment of the underlying disease causing the headache.", 
    "16": "Although often considered together, gastric and ectopic varices represent complications of a heterogeneous group of underlying diseases. Commonly, these are known to arise in patients with cirrhosis secondary to portal hypertension; however, they also arise in patients with noncirrhotic portal hypertension, most often secondary to venous thrombosis of the portal venous system. One of the key initial assessments is to define the underlying condition leading to the formation of these portal-collateral pathways to guide management. In the authors' experience, these patients can be grouped into distinct although sometimes overlapping conditions, which can provide a helpful conceptual basis of management.", 
    "17": "Combination therapy with beta-blockers and endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is the standard prophylaxis of esophageal variceal rebleeding in cirrhosis. Beta-blockers are the backbone of combination therapy, since their benefit extend to other complications of portal hypertension. EBL carries the risk of post-banding ulcer bleeding, which explains why overall rebleeding is reduced when beta-blockers are added to EBL, and not when EBL is added to beta-blockers. TIPS is the rescue treatment, but it could be considered as first choice in patients that first bleed while on beta-blockers, those with contraindications to beta-blockers or with refractory ascites, and those with fundal varices.", 
    "18": "Primary prevention of variceal bleeding is an important and long-debated topic in the management of patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices. Prophylaxis is recommended for high-risk patients with small esophageal varices (advanced liver disease and/or presence of red wale marks) and those with medium/large varices. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers and endoscopic band ligation have been shown to be equally effective in primary prevention of variceal bleeding and are the only currently recommended therapies. Controversy still exists, however, regarding which one of these strategies is preferred.

Okra gum was extracted from the pods of Hibiscus esculentus using acetone as a drying agent. Dried Okra gum was made into powder form and its physical and chemical characteristics such as solubility, pH, moisture content, viscosity, morphology study using SEM, infrared study using FTIR, crystallinity study using XRD, and thermal study using DSC and TGA were carried out. The powder was used in the preparation of tablet using granulation and compression methods. Propranolol hydrochloride was used as a model drug and the activity of Okra gum as a binder was compared by preparing tablets using a synthetic and a semisynthetic binder which are hydroxylmethylpropyl cellulose (HPMC) and sodium alginate, respectively. Evaluation of drug release kinetics that was attained from dissolution studies showed that Okra gum retarded the release up to 24 hours and exhibited the longest release as compared to HPMC and sodium alginate. The tensile and crushing strength of tablets was also evaluated by conducting hardness and friability tests. Okra gum was observed to produce tablets with the highest hardness value and lowest friability. Hence, Okra gum was testified as an effective adjuvant to produce favourable sustained release tablets with strong tensile and crushing strength.",

Preparation was conducted at ambient conditions, and NS@P xerogel as well as PNH loaded NS@P xerogel were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Investigations on morphology and porous characteristics of NS@P xerogel and methanol modified NS@P xerogel were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nitrogen adsorption. The results showed that the order of morphology compactness was NS@P xerogel>25%NS@P xerogel>75%NS@P xerogel because PEIs scaffold ability for silica condensation and forming hydrogen bond weakened with increasing volume ratio of methanol modification. Moreover, SBET decreased and uniformity of pore size distribution was interrupted after methanol modification. PNH loaded carrier materials displayed controlled release, and release effect was related with pore size of materials and PEIs scaffold ability.

However, the effect of telmisartan on cognitive impairment associated with type 1 diabetes is not well known. Here, we examined the possibility that telmisartan could improve memory function in a type 1 diabetic mouse model, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. STZ-induced diabetic mice subjected to the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task exhibited a significant decline of spatial learning and memory. Oral administration of telmisartan at two nonhypotensive doses (0.7 or 0.35 mg/kg) significantly improved memory deficits in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Telmisartan treatment markedly reduced A\u03b2\u2084\u2082, APP, BACE1, RAGE, and NF-\u03baB p65 of the hippocampus and cortex, but did not beneficially affect hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia in the STZ-induced diabetic mice compared with untreated diabetic mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that telmisartan ameliorates memory deficits in type 1 diabetic mice, at least partly because of attenuation of amyloidosis in the brain.",

In a cohort of 2780 hypertensive patients treated by either calcium channel blockers (CCBs), diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or \u03b2-blockers alone or in combination, we compared indices of short-term BPV according to the different treatments. Short-term BPV was calculated as the standard deviation (s.d.) of 24\u2009h, daytime or nighttime systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP). Short-term BPV was compared between patients treated with a given antihypertensive class of interest (alone or in combination) and those not treated with this class, after controlling for ambulatory average blood pressure, heart rate, age, gender, propensity scores and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Patients treated with CCBs (n=1247) or diuretics (n=1486) alone, or in addition to other drugs had significant lower s.d. of 24-h SBP compared with those not treated with these classes (mean differences in s.d. -0.50\u00b10.50\u2009mm\u2009Hg, P=0.001 and -0.17\u00b10.15\u2009mm\u2009Hg, P=0.05, respectively). There was no significant difference regarding treatment with or without ARBs, ACEIs and \u03b2-blockers.

Therapy with metoprolol facilitates the control by phosphodiesterase PDE3, but not PDE4, of inotropic effects of catecholamines in human failing ventricle. However, it is not known whether carvedilol has the same effect. We investigated whether the PDE3-selective inhibitor cilostamide (0.3 \u03bcM) or PDE4-selective inhibitor rolipram (1 \u03bcM) modified the positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of catecholamines in ventricular myocardium of heart failure patients treated with carvedilol. Right ventricular trabeculae from explanted hearts of nine carvedilol-treated patients with terminal heart failure were paced to contract at 1 Hz. The effects of (-)-noradrenaline, mediated through \u03b21-adrenoceptors (\u03b22-adrenoceptors blocked with ICI118551), and (-)-adrenaline, mediated through \u03b22-adrenoceptors (\u03b21-adrenoceptors blocked with CGP20712A), were assessed in the absence and presence of the PDE inhibitors. The inotropic potency, estimated from -logEC50s, was unchanged for (-)-noradrenaline but decreased 16-fold for (-)-adrenaline in carvedilol-treated compared to non-\u03b2-blocker-treated patients, consistent with the previously reported \u03b22-adrenoceptor-selectivity of carvedilol. Cilostamide caused 2- to 3-fold and 10- to 35-fold potentiations of the inotropic and lusitropic effects of (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline, respectively, in trabeculae from carvedilol-treated patients. Rolipram did not affect the inotropic and lusitropic potencies of (-)-noradrenaline or (-)-adrenaline. Treatment of heart failure patients with carvedilol induces PDE3 to selectively control the positive inotropic and lusitropic effects mediated through ventricular \u03b22-adrenoceptors compared to \u03b21-adrenoceptors. The \u03b22-adrenoceptor-selectivity of carvedilol may provide protection against \u03b22-adrenoceptor-mediated ventricular overstimulation in PDE3 inhibitor-treated patients.

As major findings, the combination was more effective than metoprolol alone in reversing cardiac remodelling and preventing ventricular arrhythmia. The association of the two molecules improved cardiac function, reduced hypertrophy and fibrosis, and corrected the heart rate, sympatho-vagal balance (low frequencies/high frequencies) and ECG parameters (P to R wave interval (PR), QRS duration, QTc intervals). It also improved altered Ca(2+) cycling by normalising Ca(2+)-handling protein levels (S100A1, SERCA2a, RyR2), and prevented pro-arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves derived from abnormal Ca(2+) sparks in ventricular cardiomyocytes.

NO physiologically regulates numerous cellular responses through S-nitrosylation of protein at cysteine residues. It has been reported that phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) deletion strongly showed axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. PTEN inactivation by S-nitrosylation results in the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5) triphosphate (PIP3) and the activation of Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling.

We have determined the structure of an ultra-thermostable \u03b21AR mutant bound to the weak partial agonist cyanopindolol to 2.1 \u00c5 resolution. High-quality crystals (100 \u03bcm plates) were grown in lipidic cubic phase without the assistance of a T4 lysozyme or BRIL fusion in cytoplasmic loop 3, which is commonly employed for GPCR crystallisation.

Remarkably, this water network and Na+ ion is highly conserved between \u03b21AR and the adenosine A2A receptor (rmsd of 0.3 \u00c5), despite an overall rmsd of 2.4 \u00c5 for all C\u03b1 atoms and only 23% amino acid identity in the transmembrane regions. The affinity of agonist binding and nanobody Nb80 binding to \u03b21AR is unaffected by Na+ ions, but the stability of the receptor is decreased by 7.5\u00b0C in the absence of Na+. Mutation of amino acid side chains that are involved in the co-ordination of either Na+ or water molecules in the network decreases the stability of \u03b21AR by 5-10\u00b0C.

Lack of the verapamil effects in LiCl-treated and FRZB-downregulated OA chondrocytes also suggested that verpamil suppressed Wnt signaling by inducing FRZB. Verapamil enhanced gene expressions of chondrogenic markers of ACAN encoding aggrecan, COL2A1 encoding collagen type II \u03b11, and SOX9, and suppressed Wnt-responsive AXIN2 and MMP3 in human OA chondrocytes. Verapamil ameliorated Wnt3A-induced proteoglycan loss in chondrogenically differentiated ATDC5 cells. Verapamil inhibited hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes in the explant culture of mouse tibiae. Intraarticular injection of verapamil inhibited OA progression as well as nuclear localizations of \u03b2-catenin in a rat OA model. We propose that verapamil holds promise as a potent therapeutic agent for OA by upregulating FRZB and subsequently downregulating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling.",

The aim of this work was to study thermoresponsive polyanionic and polycationic hydrogels of N-isopropylacrylamide copolymers with acrylic acid and N-aminopropylmethacrylamide in terms of their interaction with two widely used drugs, propranolol and ibuprofen. Binding energetics of these drugs by the gels in swollen and collapsed state was estimated by means of high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry. Thermodynamic parameters of the gel collapse (transition temperature, enthalpy, heat capacity increment, and width) were determined as a dependence of the drug concentrations. From these data the excess free energy of collapse was calculated as a function of drug concentration. Deconvolution of this function resulted in the evaluation of binding parameters and contributions from interactions of various types to the free energy of binding. The binding mechanism of both drugs to the swollen and collapsed gels was elucidated. Its main features are the cooperative character of the drug binding by the collapsed gel and the predominant role of the hydrophobicity of drugs in their affinity for the swollen gel.",

    "122": "Pancreatic cancer cells intimately interact with a complex microenvironment that influences pancreatic cancer progression. The pancreas is innervated by fibers of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and pancreatic cancer cells have receptors for SNS neurotransmitters which suggests that pancreatic cancer may be sensitive to neural signaling. In vitro and non-orthotopic in vivo studies showed that neural signaling modulates tumour cell behavior. However the effect of SNS signaling on tumor progression within the pancreatic microenvironment has not previously been investigated. To address this, we used in vivo optical imaging to non-invasively track growth and dissemination of primary pancreatic cancer using an orthotopic mouse model that replicates the complex interaction between pancreatic tumor cells and their microenvironment. Stress-induced neural activation increased primary tumor growth and tumor cell dissemination to normal adjacent pancreas. These effects were associated with increased expression of invasion genes by tumor cells and pancreatic stromal cells. Pharmacological activation of \u03b2-adrenergic signaling induced similar effects to chronic stress, and pharmacological \u03b2-blockade reversed the effects of chronic stress on pancreatic cancer progression. These findings indicate that neural \u03b2-adrenergic signaling regulates pancreatic cancer progression and suggest \u03b2-blockade as a novel strategy to complement existing therapies for pancreatic cancer.",

The world is becoming progressively older and with that, the prevalence of hypertension is increasing. A peculiar form of hypertension, most prevalent among the elderly, is isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). Hypertension in the elderly, especially when systolic blood pressure (SBP) exceeds 160 mm Hg should be treated. Lowering the SBP to less than 150 mm Hg confers substantial cardiovascular protection. This has been demonstrated in both older and newer drugs for ISH and systolo-diastolic hypertension and is beneficial in both younger individuals (60-79 years) and uncomplicated elderly (80+ years) individuals suffering from hypertension. However, a number of issues remain controversial. Firstly, the 140 mm Hg cut-off for SBP cannot be applied to all age groups. It is conceivable that lowering the SBP below 140mm Hg in some patients, particularly in the elderly may not be beneficial. Hence, the generalizations made in clinical trials should be approached with caution. Additionally some drugs, such as beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics may be associated with significantly less benefit in the elderly patients.

    "170": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is frequently associated with chronic heart failure (CHF) or coronary artery disease (CAD). In spite of the recommendation to use beta-blockers (BB) they are likely under-prescribed to patients with concurrent COPD and heart diseases. To find out the prevalence of use of BB, 256 COPD patients were consecutively recruited by pulmonary physicians from 14 hospitals in 7 regions of Spain in their outpatient offices if they had a diagnosis of COPD, were not on long-term oxygen therapy, had CHF or CAD, and met the criteria for BB treatment. In patients with indication 58% (95%CI, 52-64%) of the COPD patients and 97% of the non-COPD patients were on BB (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In patients with COPD, several factors were independently related to at least one visit to the emergency room in the previous year such as use of BB, adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.27 (95% CI 0.15-0.50), GOLD stage D, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.52 (1.40-4.53), baseline heart rate >70, OR 2.19 (1.24-3.86) use of long-acting beta2-agonists OR\u00a0=\u00a02.18 (1.29-3.68), previous episodes of left ventricular failure OR 2.27 (1.19-4.33) and diabetes, OR\u00a0=\u00a01.82 (1.08-3.38). We conclude that, according to what is recommended by current guidelines, BB are still under-prescribed in COPD patients. COPD patients with CHF or CAD using BB suffer fewer exacerbations and visits to the ER. GOLD stage, use of long-acting beta2-agonists, baseline heart rate and comorbidities are also risk factors for exacerbations in this population.",

We enrolled 678 consecutive patients who underwent CCT from December 2011 to March 2012 and divided them into three groups, which were a propranolol group (n\u2009=\u2009277), a low-dose landiolol group (n\u2009=\u2009188), and a high-dose landiolol group (n\u2009=\u2009213). Patients in the propranolol group received oral propranolol (10-20\u00a0mg) prior to CCT. Patients in the low-dose and high-dose landiolol groups were administered a bolus injection of landiolol (0.125\u00a0mg/kg), while the high-dose group received an additional 3.75\u00a0mg of landiolol if the baseline HR was \u226575/min.

Among patients with baseline HR \u226575/min, the average HR tended to be lower in the high-dose landiolol group (67.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9/min) compared with the low-dose landiolol group (69.0\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9/min, P\u2009=\u20090.10), and there was a corresponding difference in image quality between these two groups (P\u2009=\u20090.02). In conclusion, Although the decrease of HR was significantly larger in the propranolol group than in the landiolol groups, the image quality was similar. Among the patients who received landiolol, a higher dose was associated with a lower HR and better image quality. Further investigation to assess higher-dose bolus injection of landiolol or bolus injection following oral administration of a \u03b2-blocker would be needed.", 
    "176": "Accurate diagnosis of predisposition to long QT syndrome is crucial for reducing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. In recent years, drug-induced provocative tests have proved useful to unmask some latent mutations linked to cardiac arrhythmias. In this study we expanded this concept by developing a prototype for a computational provocative screening test to reveal genetic predisposition to acquired long-QT syndrome (aLQTS). We developed a computational approach to reveal the pharmacological properties of IKr blocking drugs that are most likely to cause aLQTS in the setting of subtle alterations in IKr channel gating that would be expected to result from benign genetic variants. We used the model to predict the most potentially lethal combinations of kinetic anomalies and drug properties. In doing so, we also implicitly predicted ideal inverse therapeutic properties of K channel openers that would be expected to remedy a specific defect. We systematically performed \"in silico mutagenesis\" by altering discrete kinetic transition rates of the Fink et al. Markov model of human IKr channels, corresponding to activation, inactivation, deactivation and recovery from inactivation of IKr channels. We then screened and identified the properties of IKr blockers that caused acquired long QT and therefore unmasked mutant phenotypes for mild, moderate and severe variants. Mutant IKr channels were incorporated into the O'Hara et al. human ventricular action potential (AP) model and subjected to simulated application of a wide variety of IKr-drug interactions in order to identify the characteristics that selectively exacerbate the AP duration (APD) differences between wild-type and IKr mutated cells. Our results show that drugs with disparate affinities to conformation states of the IKr channel are key to amplify variants underlying susceptibility to acquired long QT syndrome, an effect that is especially pronounced at slow frequencies. Finally, we developed a mathematical formulation of the M54T MiRP1 latent mutation and simulated a provocative test. In this setting, application of dofetilide dramatically amplified the predicted QT interval duration in the M54T hMiRP1 mutation compared to wild-type.",

It is very important to identify these patients with recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation and/or ICD shocks with regard to the presence of triggering premature ventricular contractions (PVC), which may be amenable to mapping and catheter ablation by screening Holter and ICD recordings. The practical problem, which is frequently encountered, is the absence of these PVCs when the patients are brought to the EP lab. However, catheter ablation is an important adjunctive tool to antiarrhythmic drug treatment, beta blocker therapy, and general anesthesia in this setting. Local electrogram criteria related to this phenomenon have been identified guiding mapping and ablation (e.g., low amplitude, high-frequency Purkinje potentials preceding a closely coupled ventricular signal (Fig.\u00a01a)). The favorable long-term follow-up after catheter ablation has been demonstrated in the setting of right and left ventricular Purkinje-related PVCs leading to polymorphic VT/VF (Leenhardt et al., Circulation 89:206-215, 1994) and also following myocardial infarction (Baensch et al., Circulation 108:3011-3016, 2003) and right ventricular outflow tract-associated VF (Noda et al., Journal of the American College of Cardiology 46:1288-1294, 2005).

The tuberculin skin test is used to identify individuals LTBI, but many studies have shown that this test is not suitable for RA patients. The goal of this work was to test the specific cellular immune responses to the Mtb malate synthase (GlcB) and heat shock protein X (HspX) antigens of RA patients and to correlate those responses with LTBI status. The T-helper (Th)1, Th17 and Treg-specific immune responses to the GlcB and HspX Mtb antigens were analysed in RA patients candidates for tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 blocker treatment. Our results demonstrated that LTBI RA patients had Th1-specific immune responses to GlcB and HspX. Patients were followed up over two years and 14.3% developed active TB.

    "198": "Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction involves activation of the sympathetic nervous system and chronic hyperactivation of the sympatho-adrenergic receptors (ARs) \u03b2-ARs and \u03b11-ARs, which are thought to be cardiotoxic and worsen pathological remodeling and function. Concurrently, the failing heart manifests significant decreases in sympathetic nerve terminal density, decreased cardiac norepinephrine levels, and marked downregulation of \u03b2-AR abundance and signaling. Thus, a state of both feast and famine coexist with respect to the adrenergic state in heart failure. For the failing heart, the hyperadrenergic state is toxic. However, the role of hypoadrenergic mechanisms in the pathophysiology of heart failure is less clear. Cardiotoxic effects are known to arise from the \u03b21-AR subtype, and use of \u03b2-AR blockers is a cornerstone of current heart failure therapy. However, cardioprotective effects arise from the \u03b22-AR subtype that counteract hyperactive \u03b21-AR signaling, but unfortunately, \u03b22-AR cardioprotective signaling in heart failure is inhibited by \u03b2-AR blocker therapy. In contrast to current dogma, recent research shows \u03b21-AR signaling can also be cardioprotective. Moreover, for some forms of heart failure, \u03b22-AR signaling is cardiotoxic. Thus for both \u03b2-AR subtypes, there is a balance between cardiotoxic versus cardioprotective effects. In heart failure, stimulation of \u03b11-ARs is widely thought to be cardiotoxic. However, also contrary to current dogma, recent research shows that \u03b11-AR signaling is cardioprotective. Taken together, recent research identifies cardioprotective signaling arising from \u03b21-AR, \u03b22-AR, and \u03b11-ARs. A goal for future therapies will to harness the protective effects of AR signaling while minimizing cardiotoxic effects. The trajectory of heart failure therapy changed radically from the previous and intuitive use of sympathetic agonists, which unfortunately resulted in greater mortality, to the current use of \u03b2-AR blockers, which initially seemed counterintuitive. As a cautionary note, if the slow adoption of beta-blocker therapy in heart failure is any guide, then new treatment strategies, especially counterintuitive therapies involving stimulating \u03b2-AR and \u03b11-AR signaling, may take considerable time to develop and gain acceptance.",

    "216": "Studies were included that investigated the effect of placebo-controlled, randomized beta-blocker therapy in patients with AF at baseline and HF with reduced systolic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)\u00a0<40%.", 
    "217": "We identified 4 studies, which enrolled 8,680 patients with HF, and 1,677 of them had AF (19%; mean 68 years of age; 30% women); there were 842 patients treated with beta-blocker, and 835 with placebo. In AF patients, beta-blockade did not reduce mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.86 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66 to 1.13]; p\u00a0= 0.28), while in sinus rhythm patients, there was a significant reduction (OR: 0.63 [95% CI: 0.54 to 0.73]; p\u00a0< 0.0001). Interaction analysis showed significant interaction of the effects of beta-blocker therapy in AF versus that in sinus rhythm (p\u00a0= 0.048). By meta-regression analysis, we did not find confounding by all relevant covariates. Beta-blocker therapy was not associated with a reduction in HF hospitalizations in AF (OR: 1.11 [95% CI: 0.85 to 1.47]; p\u00a0= 0.44), in contrast to sinus rhythm (OR: 0.58 [95% CI: 0.49 to 0.68]; p\u00a0< 0.0001). There was a significant interaction of the effects of beta-blocker therapy in AF versus that in sinus rhythm (p\u00a0< 0.001).", 
    "218": "Our findings suggest that the effect of beta-blockers on outcome in HF patients with reduced systolic LVEF who have AF is less than in those who have sinus rhythm.", 
    "219": "Recent results indicate that the reduction of \u03b2-adrenergic signaling impairs angiogenesis under ischemic conditions. Because angiogenesis may occur in the absence of ischemia, it remains to be determined whether and how \u03b2-adrenergic signaling regulates angiogenesis, which develops under normoxic conditions. The effect of \u03b2-adrenergic ligands on angiogenesis was investigated using 3-dimensional cultures of mouse aortic rings embedded in collagen type I, in which luminized microvessels develop in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Under normoxic conditions, both isoproterenol, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) agonist, and forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, were unable to influence aortic microvessel sprouting. On the contrary, treatment with propranolol, a \u03b2-AR antagonist, caused an approximately 70% increase in VEGF-mediated microvessel sprouting. This effect was abolished in rings from both double \u03b2-AR and \u03b21-AR knockout mice, but not in rings from \u03b22-AR knockout mice. Significant increases in microvessel sprouting were also observed when mouse aortic rings from C57BL/6 mice were treated with the \u03b21-AR-selective antagonists metoprolol and bisoprolol or with the \u03b22-AR-selective antagonist ICI 118,551. Conversely, carvedilol, a nonselective \u03b2-AR antagonist, was unable to affect aortic sprouting. These findings suggest that some \u03b2-blockers display proangiogenic activity through a mechanism that is independent of their ability to antagonize catecholamine action. The present results also identify a new function for \u03b2-AR signaling as a facilitator for VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and have implications for understanding the mechanisms that regulate angiogenic responses under normoxic conditions.", 
    "220": "Brugada Syndrome (BrS) is a cardiac disorder characterized by incomplete right bundle-branch block and ST elevations in the anterior precordial leads especially V1 -V3 , associated with an increased risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young adults. Our case describes a patient with family history of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) who presented with a Brugada pattern unmasked by severe hyperkalemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Several studies have concluded there may be a genetic link among SIDS, SDC, and BrS resulting from mutations in cardiac ion channel-related genes. Recognizing SIDS as part of the diagnostic criteria for BrS would help us identifying a significant number of families susceptible to develop SCD (as well as SIDS).", 
    "221": "Our objectives were to describe recent trends in the characteristics and in-hospital outcomes in diabetic as compared with non-diabetic patients hospitalized with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).", 
    "222": "We reviewed the medical records of 2537 persons with (n = 684) and without (n = 1853) a history of diabetes who were hospitalized for STEMI between 1997 and 2009 at 11 medical centres in Central Massachusetts.", 
    "223": "Diabetic patients were more likely to be older, female and to have a higher prevalence of previously diagnosed comorbidities. Diabetic patients were more likely to have developed important in-hospital complications and to have a longer hospital stay compared with non-diabetic patients. Between 1997 and 2009, there was a marked decline in hospital mortality in diabetic (20.0%-5.6%) and non-diabetic (18.6%-7.5%) patients.",

    "225": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is now recognized as a major and growing public health problem worldwide. Yet significant uncertainties still surround its pathophysiology and treatment, leaving clinicians in a dilemma regarding its optimal management. Whether HFpEF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are two distinct entities or two ends of a common spectrum remains a matter of debate. In particular, the lack of benefit observed with renin-angiotensin system blockers has raised questions regarding our understanding of the pathophysiology of HFpEF. New paradigms including a prominent role of co-morbidities, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and pro-hypertrophic signalling pathways have been proposed. Recent proof-of-concept trials using a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, an angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, or a sino atria, if current blocker provide important insight for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in HFpEF.", 
    "226": "Bilateral lesions of nucleus tractus solitarii in rat result in acute hypertension, pulmonary edema, and death within hours. The hypertension results from excessive catecholamine release. Catecholamine can activate connexin43 to regulate cell death. There is no study investigating the cardiopulmonary impacts of different adrenergic blockers and apoptosis mechanism in rat model.", 
    "227": "The authors microinjected 6-hydroxydopamine into nucleus tractus solitarii of the rat (n = 8 per group) and evaluated the cardiopulmonary changes after treatment with different concentrations of \u03b11-blockers, \u03b12-blockers, \u03b2-blockers, and \u03b1-agonists.", 
    "228": "In the rat model, the authors found that prazosin (0.15 mg/kg) treatment could preserve cardiac output and reverse neutrophil infiltrations in lungs and lead to prevent pulmonary hemorrhagic edema. The time-dependent increases in connexin43 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells induced by 6-hydroxydopamine lesions were decreased after prazosin treatment (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells at 6 h: 64.01 \u00b1 2.41% vs. 24.47 \u00b1 3.10%; mean \u00b1 SD, P < 0.001, in heart, and 80.83 \u00b1 2.52% vs. 2.60 \u00b1 1.03%, P < 0.001, in lung). However, propranolol caused further compromise of the already impaired cardiac output with consequence of rapid death. Phenylephrine enhanced the phenotype in the link between connexin43 expressions and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells but not yohimbine. Connexin43 expressions and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells were more decreased with prazosin (0.15 and 0.3 mg/kg) than that with prazosin (0.05 mg/kg) treatment.", 
    "229": "\u03b11-Receptors are the keystones of the phenotype. In some brainstem encephalitis and brain injury with nucleus tractus solitarii involvement, early \u03b11-receptor blockade treatment may prevent acute death from tissue apoptosis. \u03b1-Blockers can also decrease cerebral perfusion pressure, and further studies are needed in translation to brain injury with increased intracranial pressure.", 
    "230": "Ethical guidelines for human subject research require that the burdens and benefits of participation be equally distributed. This study aimed to provide empirical data on exclusion of trial participants and reasons for this exclusion. As a secondary objective, we assessed to what extent exclusion affects generalizability of study results.", 
    "231": "Review of trials on secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.", 
    "232": "One hundred thirteen trials were identified, of which 112 reported exclusion criteria. One study justified the exclusion criteria applied. Ambiguous exclusion criteria due to the opinion of the physician (28 of 112 = 25%) or physical disability (12 of 112 = 11%) were reported. Within groups of trials that studied similar treatments (ie, beta-blocker, clopidogrel, or statin therapy), baseline characteristics differed among trials. For example, the proportion of women ranged between 23.1-47.4%, 2.1-38.9%, and 10.6-50.6% for the clopidogrel, beta-blocker, and statin trials, respectively. Nevertheless, no evidence was found for heterogeneity of treatment effects.", 
    "233": "Almost none of the articles justified the applied exclusion criteria. No evidence was found that inclusion of dissimilar participants affected generalizability. To allow for a normative discussion on equitable selection of study populations, researchers should not only report exclusion criteria but also the reasons for using these criteria.", 
    "234": "The membrane fatty acid unsaturation hypothesis of aging and longevity is experimentally tested for the first time in mammals. Lifelong treatment of mice with the \u03b21-blocker atenolol increased the amount of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase signaling protein and successfully decreased one of the two traits appropriately correlating with animal longevity, the membrane fatty acid unsaturation degree of cardiac and skeletal muscle mitochondria, changing their lipid profile toward that present in much more longer-lived mammals. This was mainly due to decreases in 22:6n-3 and increases in 18:1n-9 fatty acids. The atenolol treatment also lowered visceral adiposity (by 24%), decreased mitochondrial protein oxidative, glycoxidative, and lipoxidative damage in both organs, and lowered oxidative damage in heart mitochondrial DNA. Atenolol also improved various immune (chemotaxis and natural killer activities) and behavioral functions (equilibrium, motor coordination, and muscular vigor). It also totally or partially prevented the aging-related detrimental changes observed in mitochondrial membrane unsaturation, protein oxidative modifications, and immune and behavioral functions, without changing longevity. The controls reached 3.93 years of age, a substantially higher maximum longevity than the best previously described for this strain (3.0 years). Side effects of the drug could have masked a likely lowering of the endogenous aging rate induced by the decrease in membrane fatty acid unsaturation. We conclude that it is atenolol that failed to increase longevity, and likely not the decrease in membrane unsaturation induced by the drug."
