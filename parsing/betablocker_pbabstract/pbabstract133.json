    "0": "The vascular endothelium starts to age at the first heartbeat. There is no longer a need to demonstrate that an increased resting heart rate--above 70 b.p.m.--is associated with the onset of cardiovascular events and reduces lifespan in humans. Each cardiac cycle imposes a mechanical constraint on the arteries, and we would like to propose that this mechanical stress damages the vascular endothelium, its dysfunction being the prerequisite for atherogenesis. Consequently, reducing heart rate could protect the endothelium and slow the onset of atherosclerosis. The potential mechanisms by which reducing heart rate could be beneficial to the endothelium are likely a combination of a reduction in mechanical stress and tissue fatigue and a prolongation of the period of steady laminar flow, and thus sustained shear stress, between each systole. With age, irreparable damage accumulates in endothelial cells and leads to senescence, which is characterized by a pro-atherogenic phenotype. In the body, the highest mechanical stress occurs in the coronary vessels, where blood only flows during diastole and even reverses during systole; thus, coronary arteries are the prime site of atherosclerosis. All classical risk factors for cardiovascular diseases add up, to accelerate atherogenesis, but hypertension, which further raises mechanical stress, is likely the most damaging. By inducing flow through the arteries, the heart rate determines shear stress and its stability: mechanical stress and the associated damage induced by each systole are efficiently counteracted by the repair capacities of a healthy endothelium. The maintenance of a physiological, low heart rate may be key to prolonging the endothelial healthy lifespan and thus, vascular health.", 
    "1": "The effect of carazolol on the ease of penetrating the cervix during artificial insemination, lambing rate and litter size was studied using 1.5-4.0-year old Kivircik ewes in an incomplete 3 x 2 x 2 experimental design. All of the ewes in this study were synchronized for oestrus by insertion of a progesterone impregnated vaginal sponge for 12 days and administration of 400 IU PMSG at sponge withdrawal. Three methods of service were compared: natural service, artificial insemination (AI) with fresh semen, or AI with frozen semen. Two times of insemination (fixed time AI versus AI at observed oestrus) were compared on the fresh and frozen AI treatments. The absence (control) or use of carazolol (carazolol; 0.5mg/ewe i.m. 30 min before mating) was the third factor in the design and penetration of the cervix by the insemination pipette was assessed as shallow (<10mm), middle (10-20mm) or deep (>20mm). Natural service ewes were only mated at observed oestrus. Consequently, the factorial design was incomplete and there were a total of 10 treatments each represented by 30 ewes. Natural service resulted in a significantly (P<0.05) higher lambing rate and litter size (86%; 2.0+/-0.05 lambs/ewe) than AI using fresh (65%; 1.6+/-0.1 lambs/ewe) or frozen (40%; 1.4+/-0.14 lambs/ewe) semen. For AI animals the lambing rate and litter size were not significantly different when service was at a fixed time (50%; 1.5+/-0.12 lambs/ewe) or at observed oestrus (56%; 1.5+/-0.12 lambs/ewe). Carazolol did not permit complete cervical penetration in any ewe. Deep penetration of the cervix at AI was achieved in 33% of untreated (control) and 48% of carazolol treated ewes (P<0.05). However, the proportion of ewes in which penetration of the cervix and semen deposition was greater than shallow was similar for control (82%) and carazolol (85%), and lambing rate and litter size were similar for both treatments. Over the three service methods, the lambing rate was 56% for control and 63% for carazolol (NS) and litter size was similar for both treatments. It was concluded that the carazolol treatment used prior to natural mating or AI in this experiment did not improve lambing rate or litter size in Kivircik ewes.", 
    "2": "Transient left ventricular (LV) ballooning syndrome, or Takotsubo syndrome, is characterized by a reversible LV dysfunction. The pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated, but an excess of catecholamines seems to have an essential role. The case of a 27-year-old man who developed transient LV dysfunction resembling Takotsubo syndrome after self-injection of adrenaline is described. The present case may provide additional evidence to the hypothesis of excess sympathetic activation in LV ballooning syndrome.", 
    "3": "Amphetamine induces xerogenic effects, but its mechanism of action and xerogenic potency are unknown. In the current in vivo study on the rat parotid gland, the effects of amphetamine on reflex-evoked and acetylcholine-evoked salivation were examined in the absence and presence of adrenergic and dopaminergic antagonists. Under anaesthesia, amphetamine increased the secretion of salivary fluid and the amount of protein therein in response to acetylcholine. Phentolamine abolished the increase in salivary flow and had no effect on the salivary protein concentration, whereas propranolol only reduced the salivary protein concentration. Reflex activation of the secretion evoked a well-maintained level of secretion that was reduced by amphetamine [50% inhibitory dose (ID(50)) 1.9 +/- 0.1 mg kg(-1) intravenously); the salivary protein concentration was increased in the presence of amphetamine. Phentolamine and haloperidol reduced the amphetamine-inhibitory effect on the reflex-evoked fluid response, whereas propranolol had no effect on the fluid response. The xerogenic effect of amphetamine is mainly exerted by central mechanisms involving alpha-adrenoceptors, while, indirectly, amphetamine causes secretion of protein by inducing the release of noradrenaline from glandular nerve terminals.", 
    "4": "Beta-blockers are prescribed for a variety of cardiovascular conditions including hypertension, heart failure, primary treatment of myocardial infarction (MI), and secondary prevention of ischemic cardiac events. Yet they remain underprescribed in populations at increased risk for cardiovascular disease because of tolerability and safety concerns. Beta-blockers are heterogeneous with respect to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects. \"Original\" agents were nonselective, blocking both beta1-adrenoceptors and beta2-adrenoceptors. Later, new agents were developed with selectivity for beta1-adrenoceptors, and were subsequently followed by beta-blockers, which exhibit additional effects, such as vasodilation. Among newer agents, labetalol, carvedilol, and nebivolol have been approved for use in the United States. Nebivolol possesses both beta1-selectivity and nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatory effects, while carvedilol has attractive effects on insulin resistance and exhibits antioxidant effects. Newer beta-blockers may overcome concerns about efficacy, adverse effects, and tolerability, while delivering cardiovascular protection.",

    "6": "In situ hybridization coupled with immunostaining demonstrated that ICA cells exclusively expressed CGRP mRNA and co-expressed CGRP and delta-opioid receptor in human and rat left ventricular (LV) myocardium. Radioimmunoassay detected constitutive CGRP release from ICA cells in human and rat hearts. The delta-opioid agonist [D-Pen(25)]-enkephalin (DPDPE) increased CGRP release from ICA cells in denervated rat heart. In an ischaemia/reperfusion rat model, pre-ischaemic treatment with DPDPE reduced infarct size (IS) by 51 +/- 16% (P < 0.01). Co-infusion of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)-AR) and CGRP receptor (CGRP-R) antagonists increased IS by 62 +/- 23% (P < 0.01) compared with saline and abolished DPDPE-initiated IS reduction. Pre-treatment of ICA cell-myocyte co-culture with the beta(2)-AR/CGRP-R antagonists increased myocyte death rate by 24 +/- 4% (P < 0.01) and abolished DPDPE-initiated myocyte protection against hypoxia/reoxygenation (re-O(2)). In the ICA cell-depleted myocyte culture, DPDPE did not confer myocyte protection. Supplementing ICA cell-depleted myocyte culture with beta(2)-AR/CGRP-R agonists reduced hypoxia/re-O(2)-induced myocyte death by 24 +/- 5% (P < 0.01), simulating endogenous neurohormonal effects of ICA cells. Western blot analysis showed that DPDPE markedly increased phosphorylated myocardial Akt levels. This effect was abolished in the presence of beta(2)-AR/CGRP-R blockade. Terminal dUTP nick-end labelling staining analysis of the LV infarct zone demonstrated that DPDPE reduced myocyte apoptosis by 58 +/- 19% (P < 0.05), an effect that was eliminated in the presence of beta(2)-AR/CGRP-R blockade. Finally, echocardiography showed that DPDPE increased LV contractility in a manner dependent on beta-AR/CGRP-R stimulation.",

    "9": "We demonstrated that propranolol reduced the incidence of arrhythmias in a rat model of myocardial infarction by coronary artery occlusion. Overexpression of miR-1 was observed in ischaemic myocardium and strikingly, administration of propranolol reversed the up-regulation of miR-1 nearly back to the control level. In agreement with its miR-1-reducing effect, propranolol relieved myocardial injuries during ischaemia, restored the membrane depolarization and cardiac conduction slowing, by rescuing the expression of inward rectifying K(+) channel subunit Kir2.1 and gap junction channel connexin 43. Our results further revealed that the beta-adrenoceptor-cAMP-Protein Kinase A (PKA) signalling pathway contributed to the expression of miR-1, and serum response factor (SRF), which is known as one of the transcriptional enhancers of miR-1, was up-regulated in ischaemic myocardium. Moreover, propranolol inhibited the beta-adrenoceptor-cAMP-PKA signalling pathway and suppressed SRF expression.", 
    "10": "We conclude that the beta-adrenergic pathway can stimulate expression of arrhythmogenic miR-1, contributing to ischaemic arrhythmogenesis, and beta-blockers produce their beneficial effects partially by down-regulating miR-1, which might be a novel strategy for ischaemic cardioprotection.",

Among these compounds, 4-nitrophenylthiourea (18i) and 3-methoxyphenylthiourea (18k) derivatives were found to exhibit potent agonistic activity at the beta3-AR, with EC(50) values of 0.10 and 0.16 microM, respectively, and no agonistic activity for either the beta1- or beta2-AR. In addition, they showed significant hypoglycemic activity in a rodent diabetic model.",

During CPR, animals were randomized into two groups to receive saline as placebo or esmolol after two standard doses of epinephrine. At post-resuscitation 2-h, six pigs were randomly selected from each group and the second VF induction was performed. Local activation-recovery intervals (ARI) restitutions and the VF inducibility between control group and esmolol group were compared. Western blotting was performed to determine expression of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIdelta(CaMKIIdelta) and cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) protein, and their phosphorylation status.", 
    "14": "Injection of esmolol combined with epinephrine during CPR significantly decreased recurrent rate of ventricular fibrillation during 2-h post-resuscitation, meanwhile it has no adverse affect on the restore of spontaneous circulation. Esmolol significantly flattened ARI restitution slope, lessened regional difference of ARI restitution, decreased the VF inducibility, and alleviated CaMKIIdelta hyper-activation and RyR2 hyper-phosphorylation.",

Though the mutant Asp104Ala showed agonist-induced receptor activation, interestingly this mutant was not internalized. However, the mutant Asp104Lys, which showed uncoupling with G protein, was internalized 31.77+/-3.13% from cell surface. Asp104Lys mutant produced the same level of GRK2 expression in (-)-isoproterenol induced stimulation of wild type receptor and addition of (-)-isoproterenol further increased GRK2 expression in mutant receptors. In addition, overexpression of beta-arrestin1 in mutant Asp104Lys promoted (39.75+/-2.19%) and knockdown of beta-arrestin1 by siRNA decreased (3.55+/-1.75%) internalization compared to Asp104Lys mutant of beta(1)-ARs.",

    "20": "The aim of this study was to assess the effect ofmetoprolol on cardiac function in children with heart failure. This randomized double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial was performed in children with heart failure due to left ventricle volume overload structural heart disease such as VSD, PDA, AI and MR who referred to pediatric cardiology clinics in sari in 2007. The patients divided into case and control groups. All cases were matched as viewpoints of age, sex, weight, kinds of primary disease and cardiac drugs (except for metoprolol).Metoprolol with single daily dose of 1 mg kg(-1) and placebo were given to patients in case and control groups respectively. Echocardiography with cardiac indices of systolic and diastolic function was done as baseline and monthly for 3 months in all the patients. Data were analyzed using SPSS software and statistical t-test. Thirty patients (16 cases and 14 controls) were enrolled in the study. CI, MPI and dv/dt (dt) decreased significantly at first month. Significant changes in LVEF and EPSS appeared on the second month and in E wave and E/A appeared on the third month. The results were in favor of systolic and diastolic improvement. Metoprolol causes improvement of cardiac systolic and diastolic function in children with heart failure due to cardiac defect. Therefore, metoprolol is recommended in patients with heart failure in above mentioned diseases that have not been controlled adequately in spite of receiving standard cardiac failure drug therapy such as an inotrope, a diuretic and a vasodilator agent.",

    "22": "Propylthiouracil (PTU), a thyonamide class drug commonly used to treat hyperthyroidism has been reported to cause adverse reactions in 3% to 12% of patients. The side effects have been described more frequently as mild, but ocasionally severe fatal reactions may occur. We report the case of a fourteen years old patient in use of PTU for the last three years who presented with fever, hemorrhagic blisters, necrotic ulcers, and that developed purpuric lesions and nodules in lower extremities. Laboratory and histopathologic findings were compatible with skin leukocytoclastic vasculitis, a pattern found in hypersensitivity reaction vasculitis. Suspension of PTU and introduction of prednisone, induced complete remission of symptoms and healing of the skin lesions. The importance of this study is to call attention to the occurrence of serious cutaneous manifestation with a mortality rate that might reach 10%, associated with a systemic drug frequently used in internal medicine. Early diagnosis and withdrawal of the suspected medication is mandatory. Administration of corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressives agents must be considered.", 
    "23": "In the present study, we evaluated the mechanisms underpinning the hypertension observed in freely moving juvenile rats submitted to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Male juvenile Wistar rats (20-21 days old) were submitted to CIH (6% O(2) for 40 s every 9 min, 8 h day(1)) for 10 days while control rats were maintained in normoxia. Prior to CIH, baseline systolic arterial pressure (SAP), measured indirectly, was similar between groups (86 +/- 1 versus 87 +/- 1 mmHg). After exposure to CIH, SAP recorded directly was higher in the CIH (n = 28) than in the control group (n = 29; 131 +/- 3 versus 115 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.05). This higher SAP of CIH rats presented an augmented power of oscillatory components at low (10.05 +/- 0.91 versus 5.02 +/- 0.63 mmHg(2), P < 0.05) and high (respiratory-related) frequencies (12.42 +/- 2.46 versus 3.28 +/- 0.61 mmHg(2), P < 0.05) in comparison with control animals. In addition, rats exposed to CIH also exhibited an increased cardiac baroreflex gain (3.11 +/- 0.08 versus 2.1 +/- 0.10 beats min(1) mmHg(1), P < 0.0001), associated with a shift to the right of the operating point, in comparison with control rats. Administration of hexamethonium (ganglionic blocker, i.v.), injected after losartan (angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist) and [beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopenta-methylenepropionyl(1), O-Me-Tyr(2), Arg(8)]-vasopressin (vasopressin type 1a receptor antagonist), produced a larger depressor response in the CIH (n = 8) than in the control group (n = 9; 49 +/- 2 versus 39 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.05). Fifteen days after the cessation of exposure to CIH, the mean arterial pressure of CIH rats returned to normal levels. The data indicate that the sympathetic-mediated hypertension observed in conscious juvenile rats exposed to CIH is not secondary to a reduction in cardiac baroreflex gain and exhibits a higher respiratory modulation, indicating that an enhanced respiratory-sympathetic coupling seems to be the major factor contributing to hypertension in rats exposed to CIH.", 
    "24": "The thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) largely depends on the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which is up-regulated by environmental alterations such as cold. Recently, CIDEA (cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor-alpha-like effector A) has also been shown to be expressed at high levels in the mitochondria of BAT. Here we examined the effect of cold on the mRNA and protein levels of CIDEA in interscapular BAT of conscious rats with regard to the sympathetic nervous system. Cold exposure (4 degrees C for 3h) elevated the plasma norepinephrine level and increased norepinephrine turnover in BAT. Cold exposure resulted in down-regulation of the mRNA and protein levels of CIDEA in BAT, accompanied by up-regulation of mRNA and protein levels of UCP1. The cold exposure-induced changes of CIDEA and UCP1 were attenuated by intraperitoneal pretreatment with propranolol (a non-selective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist) (2mg/animal) or SR59230A (a selective beta(3)-adrenoreceptor antagonist) (2mg/animal), respectively. These results suggest that acute cold exposure resulted in down-regulation of CIDEA in interscapular BAT by sympathetically activated beta(3)-adrenoreceptor-mediated mechanisms in rats.", 
    "25": "In 40% of children with symptomatic idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), medical therapy fails within 2 years of diagnosis. Strong evidence-based therapies are not available for these children, and how evidence-based therapies for adults with IDC should be applied to children is unclear. Using data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry, we compared practice patterns of initial therapies for children with IDC diagnosed from 1990 to 1995 (n = 350) and from 2000 to 2006 (n = 219). At diagnosis, 73% had symptomatic heart failure (HF), and 7% had > or =1 family member with IDC. Anti-HF medications were most commonly prescribed initially. Anti-HF medication use was similar across the 2 periods (84% and 87%, respectively), as was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use (66% and 70%, respectively). These medications were used more commonly in children with greater left ventricular dilation and poorer left ventricular fractional shortening and functional class (p <0.001). Beta-blocker use was 4% to 18% over the 2 periods. Treatments for pediatric IDC have changed little over the previous 25 years. Anti-HF medications remain the most common treatment, and they are often given to children with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. Children with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction are often not offered angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors without echocardiographic evidence of advanced disease. In conclusion, therapeutic clinical trials are strongly indicated because practice variation is substantial and medical outcomes in these children have not improved in the previous several decades.", 
    "26": "Previous clinical trials have shown that alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonists are not effective in subjects with heart failure (HF) and might increase HF rates when used for hypertension. However, alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonists may be prescribed to subjects with HF who have symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. We sought to determine any association between alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist use, commonly prescribed for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the clinical outcomes of subjects with HF receiving contemporary therapy. An existing database of 388 subjects with decompensated HF admissions from 2002 to 2004 at the Veterans Affairs Hospital was analyzed according to the use of alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonists at discharge. Covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine any association with future admissions for decompensated HF and total mortality. Alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist therapy was prescribed in 25% of our HF population, predominantly for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and was not associated with significant increases in the combined risk of all-cause mortality and rehospitalization for HF (hazard ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.65, p = 0.14), HF hospitalization (hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.70, p = 0.31), or all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.56, p = 0.57). In patients not receiving beta-blocker therapy, alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist therapy was significantly associated with increased HF hospitalizations (hazard ratio 1.94, 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 3.32, p = 0.015). In conclusion, in patients with chronic HF, the use of alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonists was significantly associated with more HF hospitalizations when prescribed without concomitant beta blockade. Thus, background beta-blocker therapy appears to be protective against the potential harmful effects of alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist therapy in patients with HF.", 
    "27": "This study evaluated the timing, causes, and predictors of death during long-term follow-up after primary angioplasty with stent implantation versus in-hospital fibrinolysis with a tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase). We randomized 1,572 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction to primary angioplasty or alteplase and followed them for 3 years. The causes of death were prospectively assessed by an end point committee unaware of the study treatment. A total of 225 patients (14.3%) died, 113 within the first 30 days and 112 between 31 days and 3 years. The mortality and causes of death did not differ between the 2 treatments. The causes of death were cardiogenic shock/congestive heart failure (41%), sudden death (17%), other cardiac death (10%), cancer (12%), and other noncardiac death (20%). Cardiac death was predominant during the first month only (86% of early deaths), and noncardiac death and cardiac death were equally frequent after 30 days (49% and 51% of late deaths, respectively). Independent predictors of death after discharge were age, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes, Killip class, and a lack of treatment with a beta blocker or statin. In conclusion, the causes of death did not differ between alteplase treatment and primary angioplasty with stent implantation. One half of the deaths within 3 years after ST-elevation myocardial infarction occurred during the first 30 days, and cardiac death was predominant during the first 30 days only.", 
    "28": "The occurrence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with silent ischemia after myocardial infarction (MI) and the factors facilitating SCD are unknown. This study aimed to determine the factors facilitating SCD in patients with silent ischemia after MI. In the Swiss Interventional Study on Silent Ischemia Type II (SWISSI II), 201 patients with silent ischemia after MI were randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or medical management. The main end point of the present analysis was SCD. Multivariable regression models were used to detect potential associations between baseline or follow-up variables and SCD. During a mean follow-up of 10.3 +/- 2.6 years, 12 SCDs occurred, corresponding to an average annual event rate of 0.6%. On multivariate regression analysis, the decline in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) during follow-up was the only independent predictor of SCD (p = 0.011), other than age; however, the baseline LVEF was not. The decline in LVEF was greater in patients receiving medical management than in those who had received PCI (p <0.001), as well as in patients with residual myocardial ischemia or recurrent MI compared with patients without these findings (p = 0.038 and p <0.001, respectively). Compared with medical management, PCI reduced the rate of residual myocardial ischemia (p <0.001) and recurrent MI (p = 0.001) during follow-up. In conclusion, patients with silent ischemia after MI are at a substantial risk of SCD. The prevention of residual myocardial ischemia and recurrent MI using PCI resulted in better long-term LVEF and a reduced SCD incidence.", 
    "29": "Concern has been raised about combining beta blockers with angiotensin-receptor blockers in patients with heart failure. The VALsartan In Acute myocardial infarction (VALIANT) trial enrolled 14,703 patients with myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure or documented left ventricular systolic dysfunction. These patients were randomly allocated to treatment with valsartan, captopril, or both. Physicians were also encouraged to prescribe beta blockers because of previous evidence of benefit. The baseline characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were compared among 4 groups: patients taking beta blockers at admission only, at discharge only, at both admission and discharge, and neither. Patients treated with beta blockers were at lower risk than those not treated at any period. Those treated with beta blockers at both intervals had a lower 3-year mortality rate (17.7%) than those treated only at randomization (30.7%) or only at discharge (25.9%). The greatest mortality (35.1%) occurred in patients not treated at either point. No statistically significant interaction with prognosis was observed between beta-blocker use and treatment with valsartan or valsartan plus captopril. Patients discharged with a beta blocker had a significant survival advantage after adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics and intervening complications (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.98, p = 0.02). This association was most pronounced in patients prescribed consistent beta blockers at randomization and discharge and was present in both patients with impaired and those with preserved systolic left ventricular function. These results have further confirmed that beta blockers reduce the risk of death and nonfatal cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure or systolic left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. In conclusion, no evidence was found of adverse interactions between the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan and beta blockers or of a negative effect of the combination of valsartan, captopril, and beta blockers.", 
    "30": "Previous studies have suggested that female and elderly patients with heart failure (HF) are less likely to receive guideline-recommended therapies, but these studies have involved select patient populations. We evaluated the differences in medical care and patient outcomes by age and gender among a broad cohort of hospitalized patients with HF. The Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) is a registry and performance-improvement program involving 48,612 patients with HF from 259 hospitals. The data were analyzed by gender, age <75 years, and age > or =75 years. Appropriate angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker and beta-blocker use were similar between women and men (p = 0.244 and p = 0.237, respectively). However, compared with men, fewer women received hospital discharge instructions (p <0.001) and the length of stay was longer (p <0.001). Risk-adjusted in-hospital and postdischarge mortality were similar. All guideline-recommended cardiac medications were prescribed less frequently at discharge to eligible patients > or =75 than to those <75 years (all p <0.001). Older age was independently associated with in-hospital and postdischarge mortality risk increases (76% and 62%, respectively; p <0.001 for both). In conclusion, among the OPTIMIZE-HF hospitals, female patients with HF generally received similar medical care and had similar risks of adverse clinical outcomes compared with male patients. Older patients with HF were less likely to receive guideline-recommended therapies and remained at greater risk of adverse outcomes.", 
    "31": "The transport and uptake of individual propranolol (PPL) enantiomers were studied in human intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers, and a reversed-phase HPLC-UV assay was used for quantitative analysis. S-PPL and R-PPL across Caco-2 cell monolayers was determined in the concentrations range of 10-500 microM in both apical (AP) to basolateral (BL) and BL to AP directions. S-PPL exhibited greater permeability than R-PPL in the AP to BL direction, whereas in the BL to AP direction S-enantiomer transported less than R-enantiomer. Uptake of R-PPL was significantly higher than that of S-PPL either from AP side or from BL side. The statistically significant differences in uptake were observed at the concentrations range from 10 to 50 microM. Furthermore, the apparent Michaelis constant (K(m)) and maximal velocity (V(max)) also showed significant difference between the two enantiomers. Moreover, the AP to BL transport of PPL enantiomer was markedly decreased by lowering the pH of the apical side but it did not affect the stereoselectivity of PPL across Caco-2 cell monolayers. The transport and uptake of PPL in the BL to AP direction was not influenced by several protein inhibitors.

Procollagen types I and III as well as TGF-beta1 gene expressions were measured by real-time quantitative PCR method. Collagen protein level was measured by Sirius red-based colorimetric method and Western blot analysis. The optimal dose of NE on fibrogenesis was 0.1 muM. Incubation for 24 hours increased procollagen I, III and TGF-beta1 gene expression by 1.35 +/- 0.23, 1.26 +/- 0.16 and 1.35 +/- 0.21 fold, respectively (all p < 0.05).

Addition of carvedilol (a non-selective beta-blocker with alpha-blockage activity) inhibited the effect of NE on procollagen I (0.64 +/- 0.17 vs 1.28 +/- 0.08 fold, p < 0.01), procollagen III gene (0.47 +/- 0.16 vs 1.45 +/- 0.29 fold, p < 0.01) and collagen protein expressions (0.99 +/- 0.12 vs 1.26 +/- 0.31 fold, p < 0.05, respectively).

Total abundance of the beta-adrenoceptors decreased to approximately 10% upon tissue homogenization, and the proportion of low-affinity sites was the same as that of the high-affinity sites in the membranes. The majority of the high-affinity binding sites of [(3)H]-CGP12177 in the segments and the membranes were beta(1H)-adrenoceptor, being highly sensitive to propranolol and beta(1)-antagonists (atenolol and ICI-89,406), whereas the low-affinity binding sites showed a beta(1L)-profile (less sensitive to propranolol and beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-antagonists). Furthermore, a part of the beta(1L)-adrenoceptors was insensitive to atenolol, ICI-89,406, and/or isoproterenol.

Naive male OF1 mice were individually housed for 12 days before being inoculated with tumor cells or vehicle. Six days later, tumor-bearing mice were inoculated with antalarmin (a corticotropin-releasing factor receptor antagonist), nadolol (a beta-adrenergic antagonist) or vehicle. All these mice were subjected to social stress by pairing them for 24h with counterparts selected for their high and homogeneous levels of aggressiveness. The pairs were only in physical contact for three 5-min periods, being in sensory contact for the rest of this period. One hour after social stress, serum corticosterone and IFN-gamma levels were analyzed in each experimental group. Fifteen days later, lungs were removed to determine the number of metastatic foci with their areas, and blood samples were taken to assess serum titers of corticosterone and IFN-gamma. Both antalarmin and nadolol-treated mice developed significantly fewer metastatic foci with smaller areas than vehicle-treated subjects although only the group treated with antalarmin had reduced corticosterone levels. This study confirms that social stress has complex effects on immune system and tumor development that are not simply linked to corticosterone titers.",

In all cases, the bioactive conformation of each ligand was derived from molecular docking at the crystal structure of the receptor. We identified the most effective models applicable to the different scenarios, in the presence or in the absence of a training set. For ranking the affinity of closely related analogs when a training set is available, a ligand-based consensus model (LI-CM) seems to be the best choice, while the structure-based MM-GBSA score seems the best alternative in the absence of a training set. For virtual screening purposes, the structure-based MM-GBSA score was found to be the method of choice. Consensus models consistently had performances superior or close to those of the best individual components, and were endowed with a significantly increased robustness. Given multiple models with no a priori knowledge of their predictive capabilities, constructing a consensus model ensures results very close to those that the best model alone would have yielded.",

Evidence for cortisol stimulation by upright posture and insulin-induced hypoglycemia in a patient with CS related to AIMAH led us to try beta-blockers as a therapeutic test and then as a first line treatment. Thus, a 3-day beta-blocker test (320 mg/d propranolol) induced normalization of cortisol secretion, with return of hypercortisolism at the end of the test. A long term treatment with 320 mg/d propranolol allowed sustained normalization of cortisol secretion and progressive disappearance of Cushingoid features but after 8 months the patient complained of Raynaud's syndrome and fatigue. Lowering propranolol dosage or switching to atenolol was less efficient to reduce cortisol levels. Unilateral adrenalectomy was then performed as a second line treatment, leading to normalisation of the 24h urinary cortisol without adrenal insufficiency. Long term control of blood pressure and glycemia were observed during a 7-year follow-up without beta-blocker. In conclusion, a 3-day propranolol test may identify patients with AIMAH who can benefit from a long term beta-blocker treatment. In case of intolerance to beta-blocking agents, unilateral adrenalectomy may allow for long term control of Cushing's syndrome related to AIMAH without adrenal insufficiency.",

The rationale for preparing mouth-dissolving tablet of carvedilol was to make the drug available in a soluble form in the mouth, which would facilitate its absorption from the buccal cavity. This would help to overcome its first-pass metabolism and thereby improve bioavailability. Phase solubility studies revealed the ability of beta-cyclodextrin and citric acid to complex with carvedilol and significantly increase its solubility.

Experiments were carried out on 42 laboratory white rats with the body mass 180-200 g. Model of acute toxic hepatitis was created using paracetamol (peroral administration with the dose of 1000 mg/kg, once a day). Beta-adrenoblockers (beta-AB) were used with following dozes: propranolol -1,4 mg/kg; bisoprolol - 0,7 mg/kg and carvedilol - 0,9 mg/kg; beta-AB were used during 9 days (perorally), immediately after paracetamol administration. Each group consisted of 7 rats. Functional state of the liver was estimated according to blood serum concentration of aspartat-transferase (AST) and alanin-transferase (ALT) using routine method of measurement on 5th and 9th days after administration of paracetamol. Results of experiments have shown that single administration of paracetamol with the dose of 1000 mg/kg impaired functional state of the liver that was confirmed by significantly increased activation of transaminases. It was stated that non-selective beta-AB Propranolol worsens-, cardio selective beta1-AB Bisoprolol - has no effect, while nonselective beta-AB carvedilol, with additional vasodilatory and antioxidant effects - slightly improves functional state of the liver at acute toxic hepatitis caused by paracetamol. Has been suggested that hepatotoxicity is not characteristic for all types of beta-AB. According to the obtained results, it has been recommended to estimate functional tests of the liver before propranolol administration, and carry out monitoring of the liver's functional state at treatment course, especially in individuals suffering with liver malfunction.

    "118": "Protein kinase (PK)Calpha, PKCbeta, and PKCgamma comprise the conventional PKC isoform subfamily, which is thought to regulate cardiac disease responsiveness. Indeed, mice lacking the gene for PKCalpha show enhanced cardiac contractility and reduced susceptibility to heart failure. Recent data also suggest that inhibition of conventional PKC isoforms with Ro-32-0432 or Ro-31-8220 enhances heart function and antagonizes failure, although the isoform responsible for these effects is unknown. Here, we investigated mice lacking PKCalpha, PKCbeta, and PKCgamma for effects on cardiac contractility and heart failure susceptibility. PKCalpha(-/-) mice, but not PKCbetagamma(-/-) mice, showed increased cardiac contractility, myocyte cellular contractility, Ca(2+) transients, and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) load. PKCalpha(-/-) mice were less susceptible to heart failure following long-term pressure-overload stimulation or 4 weeks after myocardial infarction injury, whereas PKCbetagamma(-/-) mice showed more severe failure. Infusion of ruboxistaurin (LY333531), an orally available PKCalpha/beta/gamma inhibitor, increased cardiac contractility in wild-type and PKCbetagamma(-/-) mice, but not in PKCalpha(-/-) mice. More importantly, ruboxistaurin prevented death in wild-type mice throughout 10 weeks of pressure-overload stimulation, reduced ventricular dilation, enhanced ventricular performance, reduced fibrosis, and reduced pulmonary edema comparable to or better than metoprolol treatment. Ruboxistaurin was also administered to PKCbetagamma(-/-) mice subjected to pressure overload, resulting in less death and heart failure, implicating PKCalpha as the primary target of this drug in mitigating heart disease. As an aside, PKCalphabetagamma triple-null mice showed no defect in cardiac hypertrophy following pressure-overload stimulation. In conclusion, PKCalpha functions distinctly from PKCbeta and PKCgamma in regulating cardiac contractility and heart failure, and broad-acting PKC inhibitors such as ruboxistaurin could represent a novel therapeutic approach in treating human heart failure.",

Adrenaline is generally accepted to improve the resuscitation outcome, since it improves coronary and cerebral blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but several detrimental effects have been associated with its use, most of which are thought to be mediated by its beta adrenergic properties. Several animal studies suggest that beta adrenergic blockade during resuscitation, is associated with increased rates of resuscitation and improved post-resuscitation myocardial function.

    "120": "Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are key modulators of neuronal activity by providing the depolarizing cation current I(h) involved in rhythmogenesis, dendritic integration, and synaptic transmission. These tasks critically depend on the availability of HCN channels, which is dynamically regulated by intracellular cAMP; the range of this regulation, however, largely differs among neurons in the mammalian brain. Using affinity purification and high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identify the PEX5R/Trip8b protein as the beta subunit of HCN channels in the mammalian brain. Coassembly of PEX5R/Trip8b affects HCN channel gating in a subtype-dependent and mode-specific way: activation of HCN2 and HCN4 by cAMP is largely impaired, while gating by phosphoinositides and basal voltage-dependence remain unaffected. De novo expression of PEX5R/Trip8b in cardiomyocytes abolishes beta-adrenergic stimulation of HCN channels. These results demonstrate that PEX5R/Trip8b is an intrinsic auxiliary subunit of brain HCN channels and establish HCN-PEX5R/Trip8b coassembly as a mechanism to control the channels' responsiveness to cyclic nucleotide signaling.",

We enrolled 16 untreated hypertensive hypercholesterolemic patients (57.4 +/- 7 years old) in a randomized, single-blind, cross-over design. All the patients were allocated to treatment with simvastatin 20 mg/day for 2 weeks, then randomly assigned to telmisartan (40-80 mg/day) or bisoprolol (5-10 mg/day). After 4 weeks the antihypertensive drugs have been withdrawn for a wash-out period of 2 weeks when they were treated with simvastatin alone, then they have been allocated to the alternative antihypertensive treatment for four additional weeks. We measured: systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), 24-h mean BP (MBP), Baseline and post-ischemia forearm blood flow (FBF) and vascular resistance (FVR), and Lipid profile. After 2 weeks of treatment with Simvastatin, baseline and post-ischemic FBF increased (both P < 0.05), while baseline and post-ischemic FVR decreased (both P < 0.05). Standing DBP and MBP were reduced more after treatment with telmisartan than with bisoprolol (P < 0.05). Basal and post-ischemic FBF were significantly increased (P < 0.05 and P < 0.005, respectively) and basal and post-ischemic FVR significantly decreased (both P < 0.005) only after treatment with telmisartan, as well as plasma triglycerides (TG) (P < 0.05). From this preliminary study carried out on hypercholesterolemic hypertensive patients it appears that the association of telmisartan and simvastatin (but not of bisoprolol and simvastatin) could exert positive effects on a large quantity of vascular functionality parameters, just after a short treatment.",

Serum malondialdehyde and antioxidant levels were estimated in patients at the time of presentation and also after a antihypertensive therapy for 3 months. During the period of study no antioxidant/s was given to the patients and control subjects. Mean blood pressure values were altered in the hypertensive patients following antihypertensive therapy from their respective values observed at the time of presentation. Serum malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher in the hypertensive patients in comparison to control cases. The antioxidant activity of enzymes super oxide dismutase, glutathione and non enzymatic antioxidant levels of vitamins E and C were significantly lower in patients compared to controls. After 3 months of antihypertensive treatment all the above parameters showed reversal in the respective levels of serum malondialdehyde and antioxidant activity. Antihypertensive medications lower the blood pressure and thereby results in reduced oxidative stress which indicates that oxidative stress is not the cause, but rather a consequence, of hypertension.",

    "146": "Different types of ethylcellulose-based mini-matrices were prepared by hot-melt extrusion and thoroughly characterized in vitro. Metoprolol tartrate was used as model drug, and various amounts and types of polyethylene glycol (PEG)/polyethylene oxide (PEO) were added as release rate modifiers. Based on the experimental results, appropriate mathematical theories were identified/developed, allowing for a better understanding of the underlying drug release mechanisms. For instance, it could be shown that at high initial PEG/PEO contents and/or intermediate initial PEG/PEO contents of low molecular weight, drug diffusion with time- and position-independent diffusivities is predominant. In contrast, at low initial PEG/PEO contents and intermediate initial PEG/PEO contents of high molecular weight, the time- and position-dependent dynamic changes in the matrix porosities significantly affect the conditions for drug and PEG/PEO diffusion. These dynamic changes must be taken into account in the mathematical model. Importantly, the proposed theories are mechanistic realistic and also allow for the quantitative prediction of the effects of the device design on the resulting drug release patterns. Interestingly, these quantitative predictions could be confirmed by independent experiments. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy allowed for the determination of the resulting drug concentration-position profiles within the mini-matrices as a function of time and confirmed the theoretical predictions.", 
    "147": "Preeclampsia is a significant, multifactorial, multiorgan disease affecting 6%-8% of all pregnancies in the United States and is the third leading cause of maternal mortality. As such, it is incumbent upon any anesthesia provider involved in obstetric cases to be familiar with the varied manifestations of the disease, management goals from an obstetric standpoint, and the implications for provision of anesthesia in this patient group. Despite improvements in the diagnosis and management of preeclampsia, severe complications can occur in both the mother and the fetus. A systematic approach to the anesthetic evaluation is therefore necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve outcomes. The potential pitfalls of general anesthesia, including failed intubation, in these complicated patients make regional anesthesia the preferred choice in many cases. Recent studies have shown that spinal anesthesia is often appropriate for preeclamptic patients, even in severe cases. Nevertheless, it is important to be aware of the potential contraindications to neuraxial anesthesia and to prepare for the possibility of encountering a difficult airway.",

The number of distal anastomoses was 1.7+/-0.8 per patient, and the internal thoracic artery was used in all but 3, most frequently for left anterior descending artery lesions. Saphenous vein grafts were used in 24 patients, mostly for non-left anterior descending artery lesions. Patients underwent multiple angiograms to evaluate their coronary and graft status. There was no operative or hospital mortality. Both 20- and 25-year survival rates were 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88 to 98). Five deaths occurred, all cardiac in origin.

Twenty male healthy Chinese volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg of carvedilol. The plasma concentrations of carvedilol were determined by reversed-phase HPLC method with fluorescence detection, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by DAS2.0. The mean arterial blood pressure was measured and the pharmacodynamics of carvedilol was characterized by tail-cuff manometry. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of carvedilol were as follows, t1/2 (4.56 +/- 2.56) h, Cmax (46.29 +/- 21.07) ng x mL(-1), AUC(0-infinity) (173.76 +/- 87.36) ng x mL(-1) x h. The estimated Kin was (0.41 +/- 0.31)% h(-1), Kout was (0.40 +/- 0.26) h(-1), the IC50 value was (24.40 +/- 21.10) ng x mL(-1) and the area under the effect curve (AUE) was (3.82 +/- 1.46)% h for the indirect response PD model.

Two different procedures were evaluated and compared using amphetamine derivatives and beta-blockers as model compounds. In one case, cyclodextrins (CD) were directly added to the mobile phase and chiral separations were carried out in less than 5 min. However, this strategy suffered from several drawbacks linked to column lifetime and low chromatographic efficiencies. In the other case, the analysis of enantiomers was carried out after a derivatization procedure using two different reagents, 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-alpha-D-arabinopyranosyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and N-alpha-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorophenyl)-L-alaninamide (Marfey's reagent).

    "161": "Activation of the peripheral nerve system by endotracheal intubation is accompanied by an increase in bispectral index (BIS). Esmolol produces a dose-dependent attenuation of the adrenergic response to endotracheal intubation. Desflurane increases sympathetic nerve activity and plasma norepinephrine relative to sevoflurane. The authors hypothesized that esmolol might blunt the BIS response to endotracheal intubation more during sevoflurane anesthesia than desflurane anesthesia. In this double blind, randomized study, after the induction of anesthesia, patients were mask-ventilated with either sevoflurane or desflurane (end-tidal 1 minimum alveolar concentration) and received normal saline or esmolol (0.5 mg/kg) 1 minute before intubation (sevoflurane-control, sevoflurane-esmolol, desflurane-control, and desflurane-esmolol groups, n=20/group). BIS, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were measured before the induction of anesthesia (awake), before esmolol injection (time point -1), immediately before intubation (time point 0), and every minute for 5 minutes after tracheal intubation (time point 1 to 5). Compared with preintubation, esmolol attenuated the increase in BIS at 1 minute after intubation during sevoflurane anesthesia (5.1% for esmolol and 31.7% for control) but not during desflurane anesthesia (28.6% for esmolol and 30.8% for control). Mean arterial pressure and heart rate increased after intubation in all groups but the changes were greater in the control groups than the esmolol groups. In conclusion, a single dose of esmolol blunted the increase in BIS to tracheal intubation during sevoflurane but not desflurane anesthesia.",

    "163": "Chronic exposure to high fluoride (F(-)) may lead to local tissue disturbances, known as fluorosis. F(-) is an oxidising agent and a well-known reversible enzymatic inhibitor that interferes with the enzyme activity of at least 80 proteins. The goals of the current study were to evaluate whether F(-) exposure affected the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in C57BL6 mice; and to determine the mechanisms at work in glucose homeostasis at the cellular level, in mouse pancreatic beta-cells (betaTC-6) exposed to F(-). Mice received 45 mgl(-1) F(-), as NaF, via drinking water, and cells were exposed for 12h to NaF (equivalent to 0, 0.007, 0.045, 0.180, 1.35 or 2.26 mM F(-)) at a basal or stimulatory glucose concentration (2.8 or 16.6mM, respectively). Mice showed marginal hyperglycemia an impaired glucose tolerance after 4 weeks of F(-) exposure, while beta-cells exposed to 1.35 and 2.26 mM F(-) had significantly lower insulin mRNA expression and subsequent secretion in the presence of the stimulatory glucose concentration. Western blot analyses did not show any alteration in the levels of glucose transporter-2 protein beta-cells on exposure to F(-)in vitro. However, oxidative stress evaluated by the functional activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and generation of the superoxide anion (O(2)(-)), showed significantly decreased SOD activity, in a dose-dependent manner. This was accompanied by an increase in the generation of O(2)(-), and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in F(-) exposed cells. Insulin secretion was lower in beta-cells exposed to F(-), even in the presence of glibenclamide, the ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel blocker, suggesting down-regulation of the K(ATP) channel in the cell. Exposure to high levels of F(-) in drinking water may decrease insulin mRNA and its secretion from beta-cells, and might therefore affect the OGTT.", 
    "164": "A mucoadhesive combination of a maize starch (Amioca, mainly consisting of amylopectine) and a cross-linked acrylic acid-based polymer (Carbopol 974P) was spray-dried with metoprolol tartrate (used as model molecule) in order to develop a powder suitable for nasal drug delivery via a one-step manufacturing process. The bioavailability of metoprolol tartrate after nasal administration of this powder to rabbits was compared with powders manufactured via other procedures: (a) freeze-drying of a dispersion prepared using the co-spray-dried powder, (b) freeze-drying of a dispersion prepared using a physical mixture of drug and mucoadhesive polymers. After co-processing via spray-drying a low bioavailability (BA 10.8+/-2.3%) was obtained, whereas manufacturing procedures based on freeze-drying yielded a higher BA: 37.9+/-12.8% using the co-processed powder and 73.6+/-24.9% using the physical mixture. The higher bioavailability was due to the deprotonation of poly(acrylic acid) during neutralisation of the dispersion prior to freeze-drying. This induced repulsion of the ionised carboxyl groups and a lower interaction between poly(acrylic acid) and starch, creating a less compact matrix upon hydration of the polymer and allowing an easier escape of metoprolol tartrate from the matrix. This study showed that co-processing of a mucoadhesive Amioca/Carbopol 974P formulation with metoprolol tartrate via co-spray-drying did not provide any added value towards the bioavailability of the drug after nasal administration of the mucoadhesive powder.",

The stimulatory actions of chloroform-extract on cell proliferation and COX-2 expression were abolished by beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptor selective antagonists, implicating that COX-2 was downstream to the beta-adrenoceptors.

    "169": "The aim of the present research was to study if the beta-blocker propranolol, which is known to increase bone mass, could reverse the adverse skeletal effects of mild chronic food restriction in weanling rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, control+propranolol (CP), nutritional growth retardation (NGR) and nutritional growth retardation+propranolol (NGRP). Control and CP rats were fed freely with the standard diet. NGR and NGRP rats received, for 4 weeks, 80 % of the amount of food consumed by the control and CP rats, respectively. Results were expressed as mean values and sem. Food restriction induced detrimental effects on body and femur weight and length (P < 0.05) and bone structural and geometrical properties (P < 0.001), confirming results previously shown in our laboratory. However, the beta-blocker overcame the deleterious effect of nutritional stress on load-bearing capacity, yielding load, bone stiffness, cross-sectional cortical bone area and second moment of inertia of the cross-section in relation to the horizontal axis without affecting anthropometric, histomorphometric and bone morphometric parameters. The results suggest that propranolol administration to mildly chronically undernourished rats markedly attenuates the impaired bone status in this animal model of growth retardation.",

The primary objective was to demonstrate that atenolol/amlodipine combination therapy is superior to atenolol monotherapy with respect to mean fall in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. The secondary objective was to compare the response rate and to evaluate the tolerability of study medications. This randomized, comparative, multicentric, 12-week study consisted of screening visit followed by baseline visit 48-hours postscreening. All enrolled patients received 7-day placebo washout. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either atenolol 25 mg/amlodipine 2.5 mg or atenolol 25 mg alone. Nonresponders after 4 weeks of therapy were escalated to atenolol 50 mg/amlodipine 5 mg or atenolol 50 mg, respectively. Out of 190 enrolled patients (94: combination group; 96: monotherapy group), 174 patients (84: combination therapy, 90: monotherapy) completed the study. After 4 weeks of therapy, low-dose combination group was superior to low-dose monotherapy with respect to mean fall in SBP (P = 0.008) and DBP (P = 0.021) and response rate (P = 0.012). Also high-dose combination therapy was superior to high-dose monotherapy with respect to mean SBP (P = 0.001), DBP (P = 0.011), and response rate (P = 0.035) at the end of 12 weeks of therapy. At the end of therapy, significantly more number of patients from combination group achieved normalization of BP (SBP < 120 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg) (P = 0.009).

Thrombus was extracted with export catheter from LAD, and coronary artery perfusion was restored. The pain disappeared completely immediately after this intervention. Transoesophageal echocardiography performed 2 days later revealed no thrombus at the prosthetic valve.

Recovery of endothelial dysfunction has been associated with improved prognosis in these patients. The aim of the present study was to verify whether antagonism of angiotensin II AT1 receptors with an angiotensin receptor blocker, candesartan, improved endothelial function in patients with hypertension, stable coronary artery disease, and endothelial dysfunction. We studied 26 patients who were receiving beta-blockers with optimal blood pressure control, in a randomized, double blind study. Patients were randomized to placebo (n=13) or to candesartan 16 mg/d (n=13) for 2 months. Endothelial function was assessed by ultrasound using hyperemic flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery. Mean arterial blood pressure was unchanged in both groups (from 93.3 +/- 9.2 to 93.2 +/- 17.3 mm Hg in the candesartan group and from 101.3 +/- 14.2 to 102.3 +/- 13.9 mm Hg in the placebo group; both P=ns). Maximal blood flow was similar between placebo and candesartan groups at baseline and at the end of the study, whereas flow-mediated dilation significantly increased in the candesartan group (from 5.27% +/- 1.69% to 7.15% +/- 2.67%; P=0.01) but remained unchanged in the placebo group (from 4.49% +/- 1.97% to 5.88% +/- 2.30%; P=ns).

    "173": "The nitric oxide (NO)/soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC)/protein kinase G (PKG) pathway is important for memory processing, but the identity of its downstream effectors as well as its actual participation in the consolidation of nonaversive declarative long-term memory (LTM) remain unknown. Here, we show that training rats in an object recognition (OR) learning task rapidly increased nitrites/nitrates (NOx) content in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus while posttraining intra-CA1 microinfusion of the neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) inhibitor L-NN hindered OR LTM retention without affecting memory retrieval or other behavioral variables. The amnesic effect of L-NN was not state dependent, was mimicked by the sGC inhibitor LY83583 and the PKG inhibitor KT-5823, and reversed by coinfusion of the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and the PKG activator 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8Br-cGMP). SNAP did not affect the amnesic effect of LY83583 and KT-5823. Conversely, 8Br-cGMP overturned the amnesia induced by LY83583 but not that caused by KT-5823. Intra-CA1 infusion of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker timolol right after training hindered OR LTM and, although coadministration of noradrenaline reversed the amnesia caused by L-NN, LY83583, and KT5823, the amnesic effect of timolol was unaffected by coinfusion of 8Br-cGMP or SNAP, indicating that hippocampal beta-adrenergic receptors act downstream NO/sGC/PKG signaling. We also found that posttraining intra-CA1 infusion of function-blocking anti-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) antibodies hampered OR LTM retention, whereas OR training increased CA1 BDNF levels in a nNOS- and beta-adrenergic receptor-dependent manner. Taken together, our results demonstrate that NO/sGC/PKG signaling in the hippocampus is essential for OR memory consolidation and suggest that beta-adrenergic receptors link the activation of this pathway to BDNF expression during the consolidation of declarative memories.",

    "175": "Ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) systems able to work with columns packed with sub-2 microm particles offer very fast methods to determine the lipophilicity of new chemical entities. The careful development of the most suitable experimental conditions presented here will help medicinal chemists for high-throughput screening (HTS) log P(oct) measurements. The approach was optimized using a well-balanced set of 38 model compounds and a series of 28 basic compounds such as beta-blockers, local anesthetics, piperazines, clonidine, and derivatives. Different organic modifiers and hybrid stationary phases packed with 1.7-microm particles were evaluated in isocratic as well as gradient modes, and the advantages and limitations of tested conditions pointed out. The UHPLC approach offered a significant enhancement over the classical HPLC methods, by a factor 50 in the lipophilicity determination throughput. The hyphenation of UHPLC with MS detection allowed a further increase in the throughput. Data and results reported herein prove that the UHPLC-MS method can represent a progress in the HTS-measurement of lipophilicity due to its speed (at least a factor of 500 with respect to HPLC approaches) and to an extended field of application.", 
    "176": "Stress-induced cardiomyopathy, also known as takotsubo syndrome, imitates an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction or an acute coronary syndrome, but without concomitant coronary artery disease. It mainly affects postmenopausal women, but no established epidemiologic data of this syndrome are available to date. Furthermore, the underlying etiologies are still largely unknown. The most frequently described trigger is strong emotional stress. Supportive therapy with aspirin, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is recommended. The abnormal kinetics usually reverse or improve within 4-5 weeks. Compared with acute myocardial infarction, takotsubo cardiomyopathy carries a favorable prognosis. However, severe complications, including ventricular fibrillation and cardiogenic shock, may still occur."
