In four litters successful radiotransmissions of electrocardiograms were recorded once hourly for four days before and during treatment. Alinidine and nadolol produced an overall mean bradycardia in comparison with saline treated animals, the effect of alinidine exceeding that of nadolol. At 48-70 hours after the end of treatment the hearts were used for in vitro electrophysiological study. Nadolol, but not alinidine, induced a prolongation of action potential duration compared with that of saline treated littermates in both atrial and ventricular muscle. An incidental observation was that heart rate in the rabbit followed a circadian rhythm, heart rates being slower in the morning and faster in late afternoon and evening. The circadian rhythm was attenuated but not abolished by alinidine and nadolol. These results suggest that if prolongation of action potential duration by sustained beta blockade in patients after myocardial infarction contributes to protection against sudden death (by a class III antiarrhythmic action) then alinidine would not be expected to provide a comparable prophylaxis.", 
    "1": "Twelve patients with neuroleptic-induced akathisia were treated in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over design with propranolol and matching placebo. Propranolol caused significant decrements in both subjective and objective ratings of akathisia, but not in anxiety scores. This confirms prior findings of the efficacy of propranolol in akathisia induced by neuroleptic treatment.", 
    "2": "The calcium antagonists are presently accepted as the treatment of choice for vasospastic angina. They are accepted by some as a good second choice therapy in the treatment of stable angina pectoris, while by others as an excellent first choice in its treatment. When introduced to the North American market, warning was given of the risk of left ventricular failure and/or atrioventricular block from their combination with beta-blockers. Perhaps now a deeper knowledge of their hemodynamic and electrophysiologic properties allows us to conceptualize potent and safe anti-anginal associations by use, in specific patients, of differing combinations. Thus we must learn to use with care and flair this new form of treatment which offers our severely afflicted patients much greater symptomatic relief.", 
    "3": "Quantitative structure-activity relationship studies have been performed in a series of 81 beta-adrenergic blocking 1-phenoxy-3-([substituted amido)alkyl] amino)-2-propanols using the Fujita-Ban model. A correlation significant at p less than 0.0005 (r = 0.883, F46,34 = 2.60) was obtained using 46 independent substituents. The set of independent substituents has been successfully contracted to 36 substituents (F 36,44 = 4.26). On the basis of the calculated group contributions the derivatives with high predicted activity have been proposed.", 
    "4": "H3-dihydroalprenolol (H3-DHA) binding in isolated smooth muscle cells has been studied. Two different binding sites have been detected: a high affinity (highly specific) and a low affinity (nonspecific) binding site. Local anaesthetics are able to displace H3-DHA from nonspecific sites with a rank order of potency that mirrors their local anaesthetic activity. This finding correlates, at the molecular level, with the local anaesthetic properties of beta-blockers, as concluded from classical pharmacological experiments.", 
    "5": "The effects of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs propranolol and tertatolol on regional hemodynamics were studied in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Regional blood flows were measured using a 20 MHz directional pulsed Doppler system with miniaturized Doppler probes on the left renal artery, the superior mesenteric artery and the abdominal aorta. This allowed the determination of changes in resistances in the renal (RR), mesenteric (MR) and hindquarter (HQR) vascular beds. Tertatolol and propranolol caused an immediate fall in heart rate. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased during the first 15-30 min following injection of the beta-blockers. Thereafter it gradually fell below control values to reach significant decreases in MAP 3-4 hr following injection. Fifteen to thirty min after propranolol, vascular resistances increased in all 3 vascular beds significantly. Resistances returned to control values over the next 3-4 hr. Following tertatolol, HQR increased significantly during the first 15-30 min. MR and RR did not increase significantly whereas a significant fall in RR was observed after 3-4 hr. These data indicate different regional hemodynamic effects for tertatolol and propranolol in the conscious SHR. Tertatolol does not cause the renal and mesenteric vaso-constriction observed following propranolol.", 
    "6": "Eighteen patients with essential tremor were treated for 2 days with a non-selective adrenergic beta-blocking drug (dl-propranolol, 80 mg X 3), a beta-2-selective blocker (ICI-118.551, 50 mg X 3) and placebo (X 3) in a randomized double blind cross-over study. Postural hand tremor was recorded with an accelerometer before administration of the drugs and at the end of each treatment period. Compared with placebo, both the beta-blocking drugs caused a statistically significant decrease in tremor intensity and they possessed approximately similar antitremor potency. Subjective benefit was reported by 12 of the 18 patients receiving ICI-118.551, 13 when on propranolol and 3 when on placebo.", 
    "7": "Impedance cardiography is a non-invasive electrical method designed to measure cardiac function on a beat-to-beat basis. Impedance changes within a constant high frequency AC-current field are detected by two thoracic electrodes. The potential changes within these two inner electrodes reflect impedance changes due to underlying pulsatile volume displacements. The relevance of the method was shown in investigations with a beta 1,beta 2-mimetic drug, a beta-blocker, an alpha-agonist, an alpha-blocker and a diuretic drug.", 
    "8": "Long-term treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension is being carried out increasingly by topical application of beta-adrenergic drugs. They bind to the beta 2-subtypes of beta-receptors in the unpigmented epithelia of the ciliary processes with high affinity. Aqueous humor production is thus inhibited. On the other hand the velocity of penetration through the cornea and the drug accumulation at this location increase with rising lipophilicity of the beta-blocker used. In this respect timolol and metipranolol, which was recently introduced on the Austrian market, possess favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics due to their intermediate lipophilicity. A calculation shows that one drop of 0.1% metipranolol solution produces supramaximal concentrations for several hours at the place of pharmacodynamic action. This is confirmed by the clinical efficacy, at the same time reducing the risk of local and systemic side effects.", 
    "9": "Of the 4.1 million population of Norway about 7500 patients between 20 and 75 years of age are admitted each year to hospital for acute myocardial infarction. Of these 1100 die in hospital, and 6400 are candidates for secondary prevention. On the basis of survival curves, we present a model for calculating potential benefits of secondary prevention. We use 'years of life gained' as a measure of outcome of secondary prevention. We consider three economic elements in secondary prevention: (a) Use of health services. The drug costs are moderate. The indirect costs are unknown, but probably moderate. (b) Resumed productivity is small. (c) Pensions and other transfers will increase the public expense. The net effect is an increase in public expense. Beta blockers reduce mortality by 25% and can be given prophylactically to about one third of the patients. So far, the effect is uncertain after two years. Secondary prevention for two years will cost Norway about 3.8 million NOK (526 000 US +) per year for drugs, give 597 extra survivors and provide 0.24 additional life years per patient treated. In case of life-long treatment and effect, the result will be 1.6 years of life per patient treated. About 50% of Norwegian patients smoke. If all the men stopped, there will be no costs, about 5120 extra survivors, and 3.3 additional years of life per patient who quits smoking. The effect is not limited in time.", 
    "10": "Experimental studies have shown that calcium antagonists are beneficial in reducing myocardial damage following induced infarction and thus substantiate the concept that these drugs may influence reinfarction rate and death following myocardial infarction in man. Multicenter studies with verapamil and nifedipine are in progress but without conclusive results as yet. Which patients--if any--should receive calcium antagonists for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction remains an open question. The answer will depend on whether calcium antagonists are greater, equal or less effective than beta blockers for this purpose. If calcium antagonists should prove more efficacious than beta blockers, it would seem reasonable to give calcium antagonists preference for secondary prevention in those patients where contraindications to these drugs do not exist. If however, beta blockers prove the better alternative, they should be given preference unless beta blockers are contraindicated. The complex question of the future role of drugs in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction is by far not clarified and socioeconomic consequences as well as quality of life will have to be considered in context with drug influence on survival.", 
    "11": "Immense therapeutic effort has been devoted to testing the secondary preventative value of beta-blocking drugs in survivors of acute myocardial infarction. The failure to demonstrate a universally statistically significant benefit is ascribable to major inadequacies of design and technical errors in the majority of trials. Moreover, even in the very few trials in which survival benefit has been demonstrated, the ultra-selection of patients eventually included severely limits the general clinical application of their result. The specific subgroups of patients who derive most benefit and as importantly those that are disadvantaged by these drugs are ill-defined. Lack of comparative trials and absence of dose-response information also pose insuperable problems in attempting secondary prevention with beta-blocking drugs in practice. When to start these drugs to achieve maximum benefit and when to stop them to avoid long-term adverse reactions are major outstanding problems. The consequences of missed therapy are also unknown. Lack of a clinically discernible endpoint of success in the individual patient means that the physician's role is relegated to one of faith. Data so for available is insufficient to afford a rational change in therapeutic practice. However, these extensive studies have advanced understanding. They have clearly defined the design faults which must be avoided in future trials. They have made us aware that many post-infarct patients may not need beta-blocking drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "This contribution reviews the beneficial effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in experimental myocardial ischaemia (infarction). These effects include the ability to reduce early, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, improvement in ultimate long-term survival from an ischaemic insult with or without subsequent reperfusion and a reduction in the extent and degree of myocardial (and microvascular) ischaemic damage. Most of the evidence for protection, however, comes from studies in which drugs have been administered before the onset of ischaemia. Much less is known about the effects of intervening with beta-blocking drugs after the commencement of the ongoing infarction process. Although beta-blockers have a great deal to offer in the experimental situation there remains the strong possibility that other approaches might be able to offer even more. One promising approach is the combination of a beta-blocking drug with a specific inhibitor of thromboxane synthesis.", 
    "13": "The safety of and the diagnostic information provided by a predischarge exercise test performed 2-7 days after admission to the coronary care unit (CCU) was evaluated in 400 patients less than 65 years of age with suspected unstable coronary artery disease, i.e. probable or definite non-transmural myocardial infarction, progressive angina pectoris or recurring chest pain of recent onset ('new chest pain'). No serious complications occurred. Signs of ischaemia during exercise tests were more common in older than in younger men and more often found in subjects with than without pathological findings in resting ECGs in the CCU. Above 45 years of age, more than half of the men with progressive angina or non-transmural MI had SI depression greater than or equal to 2 mm and/or limiting chest pain, whereas men less than 45 years of age had a 10-25% incidence of corresponding findings in the test. In women above 55 years with progressive angina or non-transmural MI, 30-35% had ST depression and/or limiting chest pain at the test while 20-30% of women below 55 years of age had similar findings at the test. Beta-adrenoceptor blockade was used by half of the patients but did not seem to conceal signs of severe ischaemia. Thus a predischarge exercise test can be performed safely in patients with suspected unstable coronary artery disease in order to support or reduce the suspicion of severe disease.", 
    "14": "Assuming one knows that myocardial ischemia is present, rational management will first require a careful history to assess the severity of symptoms, such as angina, the lifestyle of the patient, his/her age, and the availability of resources. When a patient is greater than or equal to 70 years, has little angina, even the demonstration of ischemia will not require early arteriography; pharmacological therapy on a trial basis is the preferred approach. Judging the response to oral nitroglycerine, isosorbide dinitrate, beta blockers and calcium antagonists, (often combined and in modest doses) is good rational management. If symptoms persist despite therapy or when the patient is younger and has symptoms which cannot be alleviated by changes in lifestyle and/or workload, the established ischemia assumes much greater significance and nearly always requires a coronary arteriogram for proper management. Once the coronary arteriogram has been analyzed in terms of severity of flow impairment, correlation with the tests showing the extent of myocardial ischemia must be made, best during exercise. If single vessel disease is found with a local dyskinetic (echo, scintigraphy, or angio) segment, which corresponds to a stenosis of greater than or equal to 70%, particularly when found in the anterior descending artery, balloon dilatation (PTCA) or bypass surgery (CABG) should follow. When tests, such as the ECG, are obtained during an attack of angina, the Chahine classification may be used first. In Class IIa with pure ST-segment elevation significant atherosclerotic lesions are absent in most patients, while local spasm can be shown upon provocation. Here rational management can be limited to calcium antagonists sometimes combined with beta blockers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "15": "Social isolation results in dynamic changes of neurobiological functions. The altered internal state of the CNS is reflected in changes in spontaneous behavior, changed responses to transmission-related substances and changed responsiveness to an additional impairment of normal relations between the organism and its environment. We analysed the influence of an acute 2-hour immobilization on such isolation-dependent changes. Whereas the susceptibility to pentetrazole-induced seizures increased continuously with lengthening of isolation and was not affected by the additional impairment, the responsiveness to transmission-related substances changed dynamically depending upon isolation-induced alterations. An immobilization-induced increase in responsiveness to LSD and propranolol was demonstrable in grouped controls and after short-term isolation. The apomorphine stimulation during prolonged isolation experienced a down- and an upregulation which were repeated in a stronger manner by immobilization responses especially after long-term isolation. It is suggested that the dynamics of isolation-induced changes coincided with changed acute adaptive functions.", 
    "16": "In unanaesthetized guinea-pigs, propranolol treatment (0.1 mg kg-1 i.v.) substantially increased reactivity to intravenous acetylcholine infusion or aerosolized histamine to a comparable degree. Neither BW755c (5 mg kg-1 i.v.), FPL 55712 (1 mg kg-1 i.v.), nor piriprost (5 mg kg-1 i.v.) pretreatment influenced propranolol's effect on muscarinic reactivity although BW755c abolished histaminic hyperreactivity. This suggests that propranolol-induced muscarinic hyperreactivity in the guinea-pig is not mediated by leukotrienes whereas histaminic hyperreactivity may be.", 
    "17": "The effect of PTH infusion on PRA was evaluated in 22 normotensive subjects. Intravenous infusion of PTH produced an increase in PRA in studied subjects. This increase in PRA was dose dependent from 1.505 +/- 0.226 to 2.500 +/- 0.346 nmol/l/hour after administration of 100 units of PTH and from 1.648 +/- 0.189 to 4.294 +/- 0.614 nmol/l/hour after 200 units of PTH and was markedly decreased by a beta blocking drug from 1.660 +/- 0.259 to 2.498 +/- 0.485 nmol/l/hour. These responses were observed without any significant changes in plasma calcium and blood pressure. From our results we can conclude that PTH increases PRA in normotensive controls. This effect is partly blocked by beta adrenergic blockers.", 
    "18": "Of the 3 most widely used calcium antagonists--nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem--nifedipine is the most potent arterial vasodilator. Increases in cardiac output and coronary blood flow following nifedipine administration result in part from the afterload reduction. Reflex adrenergic stimulation produces an increase in heart rate and masks a direct inhibitory effect on myocardial contractility. The negative inotropic action of nifedipine is observed during intracoronary administration or may be made apparent by concurrent beta-blocker therapy. While verapamil is also a potent vasodilator, negative inotropic and dromotropic properties are more apparent in therapeutically used dosages. Reflex sympathetic activation is also triggered by verapamil, with an offsetting of the negative inotropic effects such that little change in cardiac output results. A decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption, with or without a decrease in coronary sinus blood flow, has regularly been observed following verapamil administration. Reduced oxygen demand appears to be a major mechanism of its antianginal effect. The heart rate X systolic pressure product is decreased both by the fall in arterial pressure and, particularly after oral administration, by a decrease in heart rate. Diltiazem produces similar haemodynamic and electrophysiological effects to those of verapamil but has less potency in inducing arterial dilatation and more of a tendency to slow the heart rate. Diltiazem does not appear to cause significant increases in coronary blood flow or bring about improvement in ejectional and isovolumic indices of myocardial contraction - evidence of its intrinsic negative inotropic effect.", 
    "19": "Physical dependence to sedative/hypnotic drugs is not an uncommon clinical problem. The withdrawal syndrome is analogous to alcohol withdrawal, except the duration of the syndrome occurs over a longer period of time with the symptoms being less intense than generally encountered with alcohol. The potential for withdrawal reactions is probably greater for the shorter-acting agents than the longer-acting drugs. Potentially dependent sedative/hypnotic users require stabilization of their symptoms initially, followed by tolerance testing. If tolerant, the patients should be withdrawn using either a long-acting sedative/hypnotic (e.g., diazepam) or phenobarbital. Compared to other benzodiazepines and barbiturates, diazepam appears to be the drug of choice for treating dependent patients. Diazepam is rapidly absorbed and distributed to the brain and therefore useful for stabilization and tolerance testing. It is metabolized on chronic administration to a long-acting metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, which makes the drug ideal for a tapered withdrawal schedule.", 
    "20": "The beta-blocking effect of 4 beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with different pharmacokinetic properties was studied after intravenous and intraportal administration to control rats and to rats with experimental inflammation. In rats with inflammation the effects of propranolol and oxprenolol, which are mainly bound to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP), were significantly less after intravenous administration, but not after intraportal administration. In contrast, for metoprolol and atenolol, which are only negligibly serum bound, no difference was observed between control rats and rats with inflammation for either route of administration. Total and unbound serum concentrations of propranolol were measured 20 min after intravenous and intraportal administration. After intravenous administration, in the rats with inflammation total concentrations of propranolol were more than twice, and unbound concentrations less than half those of control rats. After intraportal administration the total concentrations were 8 times, and the unbound concentrations 3 times higher in the rats with inflammation. There was a significant correlation between the beta-blocking effect and the unbound concentrations of propranolol after intravenous administration, but not after intraportal administration. The latter finding is probably because the unbound concentrations were supramaximal.", 
    "21": "The antinociceptive actions of several beta-adrenoceptor agonist drugs have been studied in mice by use of a modified abdominal constriction test. All the drugs studied had high antinociceptive activity, with ID50 values in the nmol kg-1 range. (-)-Isoprenaline and (+/-)-isoxsuprine were the most potent, being about ten times more active than salbutamol, the least potent drug studied. All these drugs produced their action very rapidly and appear to act within the peritoneum. (-)-Isoprenaline had about six times the potency of the (+)-isomer. (+/-)-Propranolol caused rightward shifts, usually parallel, of the dose-response curves for (-)-isoprenaline. (+)-Propranolol was more than ten times less potent than the racemic drug. Practolol also caused parallel, rightward shifts of the dose-response curves for (-)-isoprenaline, and was about twice as potent as (+/-)-propranolol, whether given by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection. Atenolol and ICI 118551 had intermediate potencies. Propranolol, practolol and ICI 118551 were all considerably less potent in antagonizing the antinociceptive actions of fenoterol and RO363, than (-)-isoprenaline. None of these antagonist drugs showed more than a slight ability to discriminate between the beta 1- and beta 2-selective agonist drugs. No evidence was found for the involvement of opioid, dopamine, or alpha-adrenoceptors in the antinociceptive action of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist drugs. Evidence for and against the involvement of beta-adrenoceptors is discussed, and it is concluded that if these receptors do mediate the antinociceptive action they appear to be atypical.", 
    "22": "Single doses of ketanserin (20 or 40 mg) and placebo were compared in a double-blind cross-over study in 10 patients with chronic stable angina treated with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. Ketanserin had no significant effect on the exercise time to angina, the rate of ST segment depression, or the circulatory response to exercise. The 95% confidence limits indicate that ketanserin is unlikely to increase exercise time to angina by more than 20%.", 
    "23": "The effects of intravenous doses of propranolol, sotalol, timolol, atenolol and placebo on exercise-induced tachycardia and exercise-induced increases in hand tremor were assessed in four healthy volunteers. All active drugs produced significant reductions in exercise-induced tachycardia. Exercise caused consistent significant increases in hand tremor which were blocked by the three non-cardioselective drugs but not by atenolol or placebo. The blockade of exercise-induced hand tremor is suggested as a possible test for the assessment of the selectivity of beta-adrenoceptor blockade in man.", 
    "24": "The decrease in intraocular pressure elicited by isoproterenol in ocular normotensive animals is widely recognized. The participation of the beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in mediating this ocular hypotensive response has, however, remained unclear, because previous studies have been limited to monitoring the activity of single, supramaximal doses of relatively selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists. The studies herein report a relatively extensive pharmacological characterization of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor involvement in ocular hypotension associated with beta-adrenergic stimulation in the pigmented rabbit. A beta 2-adrenoceptor mechanism was indicated by the following evidence: isoproterenol and relatively selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists produced ocular hypotension over a similar dose range (0.001-0.1%; beta 1-adrenoceptor agonists, at doses likely to confer beta 1-adrenoceptor specificity, did not cause a similar decrease in intraocular pressure; the ocular hypotensive response to isoproterenol was abolished by topical timolol and pindolol and the relatively selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551, whereas the relatively selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists metoprolol and betaxolol were topically inactive; intravenous injection of beta 1-adrenoceptor-specific doses of metoprolol and betaxolol had little effect on isoproterenol-induced ocular hypotension, whereas the response was antagonized by a beta 2-adrenoceptor-specific i.v. dose of ICI 118551. These pharmacological results are consistent with radioligand binding and beta-adrenoceptor-linked adenylate cyclase studies which indicate a predominantly beta 2-adrenoceptor population associated with the ocular ciliary processes. None of the beta-blockers themselves altered normal intraocular pressure in the pigmented rabbit.", 
    "25": "Arthritis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by the injection of a heat-killed bacterial suspension into the right hind foot pad. The animals were deemed arthritic if their erythrocyte sedimentation rate was greater than 2 mm/hr. A pithed rat preparation was employed to investigate simultaneously the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propranolol in this disease state. Propranolol administered via the hepatic portal vein to simulate oral administration resulted in elevated blood concentrations in the arthritic rats, but the pharmacological effect, measured by the inhibition of an electrically induced tachycardia, was not altered. Propranolol administered iv also resulted in increased blood drug concentrations, but, in addition, the pharmacological effect was decreased. Hepatic blood flow was determined in control and arthritic rats using radiolabeled microspheres, but no change was observed. These results, taken together with previous in vitro studies, suggest that the elevated blood concentrations of propranolol can be attributed to increased plasma protein binding, rather than to decreased hepatic metabolism or altered hepatic blood flow.", 
    "26": "A short-term effect of propranolol on beta 2-adrenoceptor density in mononuclear lymphocytes was studied in 15 male patients with essential hypertension. According to receptor density alterations the hypertensive subjects were divided into two groups. In the first group lymphocyte beta 2-receptor density increased substantially (3 times, on the average). Propranolol had a weak antihypertensive effect in this group, with the initially low plasma renin activity remaining unchanged after the treatment. The patients of the second group, on the contrary, revealed features of sympathetic hyperactivity and a decrease (2 times on the average) in lymphocyte beta 2-receptor density. Propranolol administration caused a decline in the initially normal or elevated plasma renin activity as well as in systolic arterial blood pressure and heart rate.", 
    "27": "Medically supervised exercise programs have increasingly gained acceptance in management of the coronary patient. Beneficial postexercise results published include: Improved exercise and work tolerance, a decrease in frequency and severity of angina, and earlier return to work. The present retrospective study evaluates the outcome of a three-month cardiac rehabilitation exercise program with changes in exercise performance, compliance with postdischarge exercise routine, and return to work pattern. The study group included 38 patients with documented coronary artery disease and two participants free of ischemic heart disease. Thirty patients were treated with beta blocker medications, ten were not. Time of follow-up ranged from six months to two years. Pre- and postexercise performance expressed in VO2 ml/kg/min was assessed at target heart rate using a modified exercise protocol. Training resulted in statistically significant increases in median exercise performance in both patient groups: 2.38 ml O2/kg/min (range 1.33, 7.18; p 0.0068, one-tail) in the untreated group, and 3.45 ml O2/kg/min (range 2.63, 11.48; p 0.001, one-tail) in the beta blocker treated group. Fifty-seven percent of the participants complied with a postdischarge exercise routine while 7/12 (58%) patients unemployed at time of referral resumed work during or following completion of the exercise program. Such programs appear to be a valuable component in the management of the coronary patient. Further studies involving larger numbers of patients are indicated to document cost effectiveness of such programs.", 
    "28": "When dose-response curves are replicated, averaging the responses to each dose of drug reduces the slope of the mean curve. The shape of the curve can be preserved, however, by first normalizing each dose-response curve and then interpolating log concentrations that induce predetermined responses. These log concentrations are averaged, and then the responses are scaled to the mean maximal response. Mean dose-response curves obtained using this method were compared with mean curves obtained by the conventional method. It was found that this method did not distort the slope of the curve, and smaller differences were detected as significant. Neither method was found to be satisfactory for obtaining a truly representative mean curve for biphasic dose-response curves. The nature of the distribution of EC50 and maximal response was investigated, and it was confirmed that EC50 are log-normally distributed, whereas maximal responses are normally distributed.", 
    "29": "Twelve beta adrenoceptor antagonists were examined for their effects on mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR), plasma renin activity (PRA) and sympathetic nerve function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The selected drugs included cardioselective agents (acebutolol, atenolol and metoprolol), agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (oxprenolol, acebutolol, alprenolol and pindolol) and agents with local anesthetic activity (propranolol, oxprenolol, acebutolol, alprenolol and labetalol). All 12 beta adrenoceptor antagonists, administered once daily for 4 days (30 mg/kg p.o.), significantly decreased MBP of SHR. This reduction in MBP was dissociable from both reductions in HR as well as peripheral beta adrenoceptor blockade. In addition, the onset of MBP reduction was slower than the onset of beta adrenoceptor blockade and became greater with duration of treatment. PRA activity was significantly and markedly reduced by both bunolol and metoprolol shortly after dosing at a time when HR was significantly reduced but MBP was not. Conversely, at a time when MBP was significantly reduced by both bunolol and metoprolol, PRA and HR were found to be normal. The changes in HR and PRA were correlated with peripheral beta adrenoceptor blockade but changes in MBP were not. Bunolol, metoprolol and propranolol had no consistent inhibitory effect on pressor responses to nerve stimulation in pithed SHR, although positive chronotropic responses to norepinephrine, tyramine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and angiotensin I and II were significantly and markedly reduced. It is concluded that beta adrenoceptor antagonists, as a class, reduce MBP of conscious SHR, provided that sufficient time is allowed for this observation to occur. Furthermore, the reduction in MBP caused by beta adrenoceptor antagonists is unrelated to acute beta adrenoceptor blockade, changes in HR, reductions in PRA or inhibition of sympathetic nerve function. Finally, cardioselectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetric activity and local anesthetic activity are not required for the antihypertensive activity of these agents.", 
    "30": "The effects of chronic elevation of plasma epinephrine concentrations on pressor and cardiac chronotropic responses to spinal stimulation and exogenous norepinephrine were studied in the pithed rat. Animals were treated s.c. with epinephrine (100 micrograms/kg/hr) or vehicle for 6 days. Treatment with epinephrine resulted in hypertension. Epinephrine treatment significantly reduced pressor and cardiac chronotropic responses to norepinephrine. This treatment also reduced cardiac chronotropic responses to spinal stimulation but had no significant effect on pressor responses to spinal stimulation. The preferential beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (50 micrograms/kg) had no effect on pressor or cardiac chronotropic responses to norepinephrine in either vehicle-treated or epinephrine-treated animals. Similarly, pressor responses to spinal stimulation were unaffected in the vehicle-treated group. However, ICI 118,551 significantly reduced pressor responses to spinal stimulation after epinephrine treatment. Chronic epinephrine treatment also resulted in accumulation of epinephrine in the heart, kidneys and aorta. However, epinephrine accumulation in the heart was much greater than in the kidney or aorta. Acute infusion of epinephrine, which produced plasma epinephrine concentrations similar to those observed in the chronically treated animals, caused a reduction of pressor and cardiac chronotropic responses to both nerve stimulation and norepinephrine. In conclusion, chronic epinephrine treatment led to accumulation of epinephrine in peripheral tissues and to the development of a facilitatory influence of beta-2 adrenoceptors on pressor responses to nerve stimulation in the pithed rat that were not observed in vehicle-treated animals. The authors believe that this influence is prejunctional in nature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "The effective treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (VA) leading to sudden cardiac death remains a major health problem. Cellular electrophysiological techniques that have provided insight into the underlying mechanisms of these arrhythmias have also provided a convenient classification of antiarrhythmic drugs based on their dominant electrophysiological action. Traditional pharmacological approaches to the management of VA have involved primarily class I agents. Newer drugs in this class are potent conduction depressants (class IC agents), which, however, have been limited in their clinical impact on VA because of unwanted cardiac and extracardiac side effects. Other recent approaches include the introduction of class III agents, which are thought to interrupt primarily reentrant impulses by specific prolongation of action potential duration and refractoriness without compromising normal cardiac conduction. Newer approaches may also include drugs with greater specificity of action, agents with combinations of electrophysiological effects (class I/III, I/II), drugs exemplifying novel mechanisms of action such as anion antagonism (class V), and agents controlling sympathetic neural outflow. The growing awareness of the potential proarrhythmic effects of antiarrhythmic drugs has also become important in drug development and assessment, as emphasized by the search for improved methods of drug selection (e.g., programmed electrical stimulation). Finally, the desired characteristics of a new antiarrhythmic agent are presented as a goal for future drug development.", 
    "32": "The possible involvement of adrenergic mechanisms in regulating the secretion of growth hormone (GH)-releasing factor (GRF) from the rat hypothalamus was examined in vitro with a perifusion system. A high potassium concentration (56 mM) stimulated GRF release from the hypothalamus. The infusion of clonidine (10(-4) M), an alpha 2-adrenergic stimulant, resulted in an increase in the spontaneous release of GRF. In the presence of propranolol (10(-5) M), a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, clonidine (10(-5) and 10(-4) M) stimulated GRF release more prominently in a dose-related manner, whereas propranolol (10(-5) and 10(-4) M) by itself did not affect the spontaneous GRF release. The stimulatory effect of clonidine (10(-4) M) on GRF release in the presence of propranolol was inhibited by yohimbine (10(-4) M), an alpha 2-adrenergic blocking agent. These findings suggest that alpha 2-adrenergic mechanisms play a role in stimulating GRF release from the hypothalamus in rats.", 
    "33": "The effect of chemical stimulation of the central nervous system was studied in anesthetized rats. (Bu)2 cAMP, cAMP, 5'-adenosine monophosphate (AMP), ATP, and (Bu)2 N6,O2-dibutyryl guanosine-3'5'-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt were injected directly into the third cerebral ventricle, and changes in hepatic venous plasma glucose, immunoreactive glucagon, and insulin concentrations were studied. The injection of (Bu)2cAMP (1 X 10(-8) to 5 X 10(-7) mol/microliter saline) into the third cerebral ventricle caused a dose-dependent hyperglycemia associated with increased immunoreactive glucagon. (Bu)2cAMP-induced hyperglycemia and hyperglucagonemia were inhibited by prior bilateral adrenalectomy. The injection of somatostatin (1 X 10(-9) mol) with (Bu)2cAMP (5 X 10(-7) mol) into the third cerebral ventricle abolished both (Bu)2cAMP-induced hyperglycemia and an increase of glucagon secretion. These results suggest that cAMP may act intracellularly within the central nervous system to increase hepatic glucose output, and this appears to depend on the adrenal gland. Epinephrine secreted from the adrenal gland may directly act on the liver or enhance glucagon secretion, which in turn increases hepatic glucose output.", 
    "34": "This report describes our experience with 12 patients with thyrotoxic Graves' disease who were prepared for thyroidectomy using only a long-acting orally administered beta-adrenergic blocking agent (nadolol or atenolol); iodides were not used. This form of preparation proved to be very effective, fast acting, and economical. It permitted rapid preparation of patients for surgery and resulted in excellent control of the manifestations of hyperthyroidism in the perioperative period. The surgery was relatively easy and bloodless, and there were no operative complications. We recommend that these long-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agents be considered as the preferred medication for the preparation of thyrotoxic patients for surgery.", 
    "35": "Drugs used to treat portal hypertension cause constriction of mesenteric arterioles, reducing inflow to the portal venous system, portal pressure, and flow through portasystemic collaterals (such as esophageal varices). Vasopressin and somatostatin are direct vasoconstrictors. Propranolol acts by blocking vasodilatory beta 1 receptors and reducing cardiac output. A major side effect of vasopressin therapy is impaired cardiac performance secondary to coronary vasoconstriction and increased work against high arterial pressure. Infusion of vasopressin together with a cardiac inotrope or a vasodilator, and administration of vasopressin as an inactive \"hormonogen\" which is slowly released in vivo, may lessen adverse effects. Somatostatin appears to act selectively in the mesenteric circulation. Controlled trials indicate that vasopressin may be useful for controlling hemorrhage from esophageal varices and that somatostatin works at least as well as vasopressin. Propranolol treatment has been used to prevent variceal bleeding; however, controlled trials of its effectiveness have produced conflicting results.", 
    "36": "This study examined the effect of esmolol, an ultrashort-acting beta-receptor blocker, in 10 patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Simultaneous hemodynamic and radionuclide angiographic measurements were obtained at incremental doses of esmolol (2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 mg/min). At a dose of 4 mg/min, esmolol produced beats blockade: a decrease in heart rate from 91 +/- 4 to 83 +/- 4 beats/min (p less than 0.05) (mean +/- SEM) and a decrease in systolic aortic pressure from 133 +/- 5 to 128 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). At the maximal dose, the heart rate decreased to 79 +/- 3 beats/min (p less than 0.05) and biventricular function was depressed; the left ventricular ejection fraction decreased from 27 +/- 2 to 21 +/- 2% (p less than 0.05) and the right ventricular ejection fraction decreased from 38 +/- 2 to 29 +/- 2% (p less than 0.05). These changes were accompanied by increases in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (p less than 0.05), left ventricular end-systolic volume (p less than 0.05) and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (p less than 0.05), as well as a decrease in cardiac output (p less than 0.05). The hemodynamic abnormalities (which showed considerable interindividual variability) returned to near baseline levels 10 to 30 minutes after infusion was stopped. Thus, esmolol can be administered to patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. The beneficial effect (beta-adrenergic blockade) is usually achieved with small doses without clinically important hemodynamic changes. At larger doses, however, significant changes in biventricular function may be observed.", 
    "37": "The amylase release from mouse pancreatic fragments was studied after dopamine (DA), and alpha- or beta-sympathomimetic agonist application. The electrical parameters of the acinar cell membrane were also monitored. Both DA (from 5 X 10(-6) to 10(-4) M) and beta-stimulants (isoprenaline from 5 X 10(-6) to 5 X 10(-5) M; noradrenaline from 3 X 10(-4) to 10(-3) M) evoked an increase in amylase release, while noradrenaline in alpha-receptor stimulating doses failed to have any effect. The stimulatory effect of DA was blocked by ganglion blockers (Arfonad 10(-5) M; pentamethonium 3 X 10(-5) M) in a competitive manner and a dual antagonism was observed with atropine (10(-7) M, 10(-9) M). An alpha-receptor antagonist (phentolamine 10(-5) M) and a beta-receptor antagonist (propranolol 10(-5) M) had no influence on the dopamine response. Moreover, the DA-induced stimulation was dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium. Perfusion with 10(-4) and 10(-3) M-DA or local application (from 77 micrograms to 4.3 mg), resulted in marked membrane depolarization with diminution of the input resistance. This effect was blocked by atropine (10(-5) M) and pentamethonium (10(-4) M), but not by propranolol (10(-5) M) or phentolamine (10(-5) M). The isoprenaline- (IP) and noradrenaline- (NA) induced increase in amylase release was competitively blocked by propranolol (10(-5) M) but not by phentolamine (10(-5) M). Atropine caused a dose-dependent (10(-7) M, 10(-6) M) decrease in the maximal response (non-competitive antagonism), while the ganglion blocker pentamethonium (10(-4) M) was without effect. NA caused membrane depolarization accompanied by a decrease in the input resistance after local application (from 77 micrograms to 1.6 mg). This effect persisted in the presence of 10(-5) M-phentolamine but was abolished by 10(-5) M-propranolol. IP perfusion (10(-4) and 10(-3) M) or local application (0.3 M; from 32 to 130 micrograms) caused the same electrical changes as those induced by NA and DA. The effect of IP persisted in the presence of 10(-5) M-phentolamine, 10(-4) M-pentamethonium and 10(-4) M-domperidone, but was abolished by propranolol (10(-5) M) and tetrodotoxin (5 X 10(-6) M) and markedly diminished by atropine (10(-5) M).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "38": "In isolated cardiac myocytes from adult rats low concentrations of ouabain, 10(-9) to 5 X 10(-10) M, decreased cellular Na+ content and 45Ca influx and increased 86Rb uptake. Propranolol, 10(-7) M, did not affect these parameters either in the presence or absence of ouabain. These results indicate that Na+ pump stimulation by low concentrations of digitaloids may occur in the absence of adrenergic innervation and is unaffected by adrenergic beta-blockade. Stimulation of 86Rb uptake in ventricular muscle slices was also unaffected by propranolol, indicating that in intact ventricular muscle also, the effect does not depend on beta-adrenergic mediation. This is in contrast to earlier reports on studies in isolated atria.", 
    "39": "Forskolin caused a concentration-dependent relaxation and increase in cyclic AMP levels in rabbit detrusor muscle. Propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, did not affect the relaxation induced by forskolin. 3-isobutyl-1-metylxanthine (IBMX), a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor, potentiated the relaxation induced by forskolin. These data suggest that the relaxation of rabbit detrusor muscle induced by forskolin is mediated by cyclic AMP accumulation resulting from activation of adenylate cyclase.", 
    "40": "Prizidilol, a combined vasodilator/beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, has two optical isomers. The pharmacological activities of these isomers have been established and heart rate/blood pressure responses to both isomers have been determined. Both the R and S isomers elicited similar blood pressure lowering and vasodilator activity in anaesthetised normotensive rats. S-Prizidilol was a substantially more potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist in vitro and in vivo than R-prizidilol. Neither optical isomer showed any specificity for either beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors. In conscious rats both isomers lowered blood pressure similarly with only marginal differences in heart rate. In conscious cats the importance of increased sympathetic drive in reflex tachycardia was emphasised by the incidence of tachycardia after R-prizidilol but not after S-prizidilol when administered at equieffective blood pressure lowering doses. In conscious dogs both isomers caused tachycardia although S-prizidilol tended to cause the greater fall in blood pressure.", 
    "41": "New antiarrhythmic drug regimens are constantly being sought because of the relatively low efficacy rates of standard antiarrhythmic agents in preventing induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias; the application of these agents is also limited due to serious or debilitating side-effects. The combination of two antiarrhythmic agents with complimentary electrophysiologic activities and differing toxicities might offer significant advantages in overcoming the drawbacks of standard antiarrhythmic drug therapy. A knowledge of the pharmacodynamics of the major classes of antiarrhythmic agents will allow informed choices of drugs for use in combination therapy. Judging antiarrhythmic drug efficacy is a complex problem, requiring an understanding of the influence of the arrhythmia monitoring technique, arrhythmia morphology and the response to previous drugs on drug efficacy rates, so that accurate comparisons of drug effectiveness can be made among different agents or combinations. A number of combination therapies have been tested for suppression of complex ventricular ectopy, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. The most successful combinations have been those using class IA and IB agents and class IA and II agents. In general, these combinations tend to show higher efficacy rates in suppressing all forms of ventricular ectopy and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and usually have a lower incidence of toxic side-effects compared with individual agents alone. On the basis of these initial results, it seems warranted to perform further studies to explore these combinations in larger populations and to test new combinations developed on the basis of pharmacodynamic principles.", 
    "42": "Glucocorticoid hormones cause marked muscular atrophy, the mechanism of which is unknown. We employed a potent glucocorticoid antagonist, RU38486 [11 beta-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)17 beta-hydroxy-17 alpha-(prop-1-ynyl)estra-4,9-dien-3-one], to determine whether intracellular glucocorticoid receptors are involved. RU38486 was shown to be an effective blocker of glucocorticoid receptor binding in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, this compound significantly blocked the loss of body and muscle weight caused by injection of dexamethasone. These data indicate that intracellular glucocorticoid receptors are important in the etiology of steroid myopathy. Studies with glucocorticoid antagonists may lead to the design of specific therapeutic modalities for the treatment of both endogenously and exogenously produced steroid myopathies.", 
    "43": "Over 1,200 middle-aged men with no apparent vascular disease participated in a 5-year multifactorial primary prevention trial, in which 612 received dietetic, hygienic and--when indicated--pharmacologic treatment for the following risk factors: hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity and abnormal glucose tolerance. Pharmacologic therapy included hypolipidemic agents (mainly probucol and clofibrate) and antihypertensive drugs (mainly diuretics and beta blockers). At the end of the 5 years, results in these men were compared with findings in 610 high risk and 593 low risk control subjects, none of whom had received treatment. Although intervention decreased the mean risk factor status of the treated men by 33%, their 5-year coronary incidence exceeded that of the high risk control subjects (3.1% vs 1.5%). Stroke incidence, however, was markedly reduced in the treated subjects (0% vs 1.3%). Multivariate analysis showed that the coronary events occurred in patients taking beta blockers or clofibrate, while few occurred in those receiving probucol or the diuretics. The decrease in mean serum cholesterol was 15% in men receiving only probucol, and ranged from 0% to 13% in those receiving different drug combinations, including clofibrate plus probucol (11%). Probucol also markedly decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, especially when combined with clofibrate. It is possible that adverse drug effects offset the probable benefit of an improved risk profile in the treated men, thereby explaining the greater than expected occurrence of cardiac events in this group. The probucol data, however, suggest that it may not be harmful to lower the high density lipoprotein cholesterol level when there is a significant decrease in total cholesterol as well.", 
    "44": "We conducted a multicenter randomized double-blind clinical trial among 626 men with mild to moderate hypertension to determine the effects of captopril, methyldopa, and propranolol on their quality of life. Hydrochlorothiazide was added if needed to control blood pressure. After a 24-week treatment period, all three groups had similar blood-pressure control, although fewer patients taking propranolol required hydrochlorothiazide. Patients taking captopril alone or in combination with a diuretic were least likely to withdraw from treatment because of adverse effects (8 percent vs. 20 percent for methyldopa and 13 percent for propranolol). The treatment groups were similar in scores for sleep dysfunction, visual memory, and social participation. However, patients taking captopril, as compared with patients taking methyldopa, scored significantly higher (P less than 0.05 to less than 0.01) on measures of general well-being, had fewer side effects, and had better scores for work performance, visual-motor functioning, and measures of life satisfaction. Patients taking propranolol also reported better work performance than patients taking methyldopa. Patients taking captopril reported fewer side effects and less sexual dysfunction than those taking propranolol and had greater improvement (P less than 0.05 to less than 0.01) on measures of general well-being. Our findings show that antihypertensive agents have different effects on the quality of life and that these can be meaningfully assessed with available psychosocial measures.", 
    "45": "Stereospecific saturable and reversible binding of d-cis-diltiazem has been demonstrated in cardiac sarcolemmal membrane vesicles. Analysis of binding by either equilibrium or kinetic techniques indicates the presence of a single class of benzothiazepine receptors which bind diltiazem with a KD of 80 nM at 25 degrees C. Benzothiazepine receptors copurify with other sarcolemmal marker activities and exist in a complex with distinct receptors for dihydropyridine and aralkylamine Ca2+ entry blockers in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry. Ligand binding to one receptor of this complex influences binding reactions at the other two sites in a manner that depends on ambient temperature. Binding of either dihydropyridine agonists or antagonists causes partial inhibition of diltiazem binding at 25 degrees C (Bmax effect), while most dihydropyridine antagonists stimulate and agonists inhibit diltiazem binding at 37 degrees C (both are KD effects). This temperature-dependent change in receptor coupling was confirmed by Scatchard analyses and study of diltiazem dissociation kinetics. Verapamil, interacting at the aralkylamine receptor, inhibits diltiazem binding equivalently at 25 and 37 degrees C (KD effects). In addition, both classes of dihydropyridines inhibit verapamil binding in a temperature-independent fashion, as does diltiazem (all are KD effects). Allosteric coupling between benzothiazepine and dihydropyridine receptors is manifested in cardiac muscle since the negative inotropic potency of diltiazem is increased by nitrendipine and decreased by 4-(O-trifluromethy(phenyl)-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-1,4-dihydropyridin e-3- carboxylic acid, methyl ester. These results suggest a model in which the Ca2+ entry blocker receptor complex undergoes a change between 25 and 37 degrees C so that at the latter temperature all sites are directly coupled. Allosteric coupling may have important consequences in vivo since it can be detected in functional assays of Ca2+ channel activity.", 
    "46": "We used 31P NMR spectroscopy to study the effect of acebutolol on the metabolic disturbances caused by ischaemia in the isolated rat heart. The intracellular acidosis and high-energy phosphate compound depletion induced by global low-flow ischaemia were significantly attenuated in the presence of acebutolol 2.7 X 10(-5) and 1.35 X 10(-4) M. The drug displayed no significant effect either at the 5.4 X 10(-6) M concentration or when administered as pretreatment to the animals (50 mg X kg-1, 120 and 60 min before isolating the heart). Since acebutolol had no effect on the contractility of the isolated rat heart at the 2.7 X 10(-5) M concentration the present results suggest that the mechanisms through which acebutolol exerts its effects on energy metabolism are not related to a reduction of cardiac work. The possible contribution of the membrane-stabilizing property of the drug is suggested by the fact that high concentrations are needed and that a short pretreatment had no effect.", 
    "47": "The effects of veratrine on renin release from rat kidney cortical slices were compared with those of norepinephrine (NE). Veratrine (10-100 micrograms/ml) produced a concentration-dependent increase in renin release. This action was markedly attenuated by propranolol but not influenced by prazosin. On the other hand, relatively higher concentrations of NE produced an inhibition of renin release and the inhibitory action was reversed by prazosin. These results suggest that exogenous NE inhibits renin release by preferential activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors while neuronally released NE stimulates renin release by exclusive activation of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "48": "The electrophysiological effects of amosulalol, a newly developed alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, were examined and compared with those of labetalol, prazosin and propranolol in isolated rabbit papillary muscles by means of standard microelectrode techniques. Amosulalol above 3 microM produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax) and an increase in action potential duration (APD). Labetalol and prazosin produced a similar APD prolongation, and Vmax was depressed by all these drugs in a concentration-dependent manner. The depressant action of these drugs on Vmax was enhanced by increasing the stimulation rate from 0.25 to 2.0 Hz. In the presence of these drugs the Vmax declined exponentially to a new plateau level (rate-dependent block) and the onset of the rate dependent block for amosulalol at 1 Hz was similar to that for labetalol and propranolol, and faster than that for prazosin. The time constants of the recovery from rate-dependent block for amosulalol, labetalol and prazosin were considerably slower than that for propranolol. These results suggest that amosulalol possesses class I and III antiarrhythmic properties and the recovery from the rate-dependent block of Vmax is relatively slow with this drug.", 
    "49": "The use of four cardioselective beta-blockers in a group of patients with chronic obstructive bronchopneumopathies was examined. Of the 4 drugs the only possible one for use in this patient category was atenolol which produced significant bronchial dilation after spray treatment, thus demonstrating the responsiveness of beta 2-receptors to pharmacological stimulus.", 
    "50": "Rimcazole (BW 234U) is a potential antipsychotic agent which in open-clinical trials appears to be effective in acute schizophrenic patients. In the present study, rimcazole was found to block the specific binding of [3H]-(+)-SKF 10,047 to sigma sites in rat and guinea pig brain (IC50 = 5.0 X 10(-7) M). The compound was 100 times weaker as a blocker of phencyclidine sites (IC50 = 4.3 X 10(-5) M). At 1 X 10(-5) M, rimcazole had only weak effects on mu, delta, kappa and epsilon opioid receptors. Scatchard analysis of the binding data from guinea pig brain revealed an apparent KD for [3H]-(+)-SKF 10,047 of 85 +/- 5 nM and a Bmax of 824 +/- 27 fmole/mg protein. In the presence of 5 X 10(-7) M BW 234U, the apparent KD was 165 +/- 35 nM, but the Bmax (892 +/- 146 fmoles/mg protein) was not affected. This suggests that rimcazole is a competitive inhibitor of sigma sites. The agent was also capable of blocking sigma sites in vivo (ID50 = 6 mg/kg i.p., mice) as judged by an in vivo sigma receptor binding assay. Thus, if the antipsychotic activity of rimcazole is confirmed in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, it would be the first compound whose mechanism of antipsychotic activity may best be explained by a direct blockade of sigma sites and not by a direct blockade of dopamine (D2) receptors in brain.", 
    "51": "Many of the agents held responsible for fatal poisoning in England and Wales--particularly dextropropoxyphene, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-adrenergic antagonists, and chlorpromazine--possess membrane stabilising activity (MSA). This pharmacological property, although regarded as being of little importance in therapeutic use, may be responsible for death in more than 30% of fatal poisonings. Awareness of this possibility may lead to greater care in the prescribing of drugs with this property, to the development of safer alternatives, and to more rational therapy of the poisoned patient.", 
    "52": "The density and affinity of beta-2-adrenoceptors on mononuclear cells from peripheral blood were studied in fifteen patients with cirrhosis of different severity and in thirteen controls. There was no significant difference between cirrhotic patients and controls in density or affinity of beta-2 binding sites. Within the cirrhotic group, however, the number of binding sites per cell was significantly lower in patients with severe ascites than in patients with mild to moderate or no ascites. This down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors could influence the haemodynamic response to beta-blockers.", 
    "53": "The total concentration of the norepinephrine metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyl glycol (MOPEG) and propranolol concentration was measured in the medulla, pons, hypothalamus and thoracic spinal cord of conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats during the development of the antihypertensive effect of a single dose of d,l-propranolol (10 mg/kg s.c.). Propranolol significantly increased MOPEG concentration by 21% in the thoracic spinal cord (2 h) and 16% in the hypothalamus (4 h), but no consistent pattern of change in regional MOPEG concentration was found in relation to the time course of the antihypertensive effect of propranolol.", 
    "54": "The effect of vasopressin, angiotensin II and phorbol myristate acetate on the alpha 1-adrenergic action (induced by epinephrine + propranolol), was studied. We selected three conditions: (a) ureagenesis in medium without added calcium and containing 25 microM EGTA; (b) ureagenesis using cells from hypothyroid animals, and (c) gluconeogenesis from dihydroxyacetone. Under these conditions epinephrine + propranolol produces clear metabolic effects, whereas the vasopressor peptides do not (although they stimulate phosphoinositide turnover). It was observed that the vasopressor peptides and the active phorbol ester inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion the effect of epinephrine + propranolol. It is suggested that activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters or physiological stimuli (hormones that activate phosphoinositide turnover, such as vasopressin or angiotensin II) modulate the hepatocyte alpha 1-adrenergic responsiveness.", 
    "55": "The responsiveness of fetal mouse Leydig cells to catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine), a beta-agonist agent (L-isoproterenol) and hCG was investigated in vitro. Fetal Leydig cells when freshly isolated were unable to respond to L-isoproterenol (10(-5) M). However, L-isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine significantly stimulated androgen production by fetal Leydig cells after 24 h of primary culture. Androgen production was increased in both conditions and to a greater extent by hCG. Propranolol blocked the stimulatory effect of L-isoproterenol and epinephrine. It is concluded that catecholamines can regulate fetal testosterone biosynthesis.", 
    "56": "The effects of changes of membrane potential on amino acid transport through systems A, ASC and L was investigated in the Ehrlich cell and the human erythrocyte. Changes of membrane potential were produced by incubating cells whose K+ permeability had been increased, either by valinomycin or by activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels, in medium containing different K+ concentrations. The changes in membrane potential were followed by measuring the distribution ratio reached by lipophilic indicators. Transport through Na+-dependent system A was sensitive to the membrane potential, the rate of amino acid uptake increasing 2.2-3.1-times for each 60 mV-hyperpolarization. The Na+-dependent system ASC was insensitive to membrane potential. The Na+-independent system L was not directly affected by membrane potential, but the steady-state accumulation of system L substrates was increased by hyperpolarization.", 
    "57": "The influence of celiprolol on the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia was compared with placebo in a randomized double blind study. 17 female patients were treated with a single daily dose of 200 mg celiprolol and 18 female patients received placebo for a period of 3 months. All patients got additional neuroleptic treatment. Celiprolol produced a small decrease in heart rate and systolic blood pressure, but had no influence on the diastolic blood pressure. The effects of celiprolol on the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia were similar to those of the placebo; in both groups improvements and deteriorations were observed. One patient of the celiprolol group became symptom free. Two cases of collapse occurred after 10 weeks of treatment with celiprolol. In one case collapse was associated with diarrhoea, in the other case the patient had preexisting hypotensive circulatory dysregulation. Sporadic reports about the effect of propranolol in patients with tardive dyskinesia might reflect the normal progress of the disease or the effect might depend on the different pharmacological profile of propranolol.", 
    "58": "Glutaraldehyde appears to preferentially effect the activation processes of the adenylate cyclase complex of turkey erythrocyte membranes. The primary effect of low concentration (0.01 percent, 0.05 percent, and 0.1 percent) glutaraldehyde membrane treatment is to decrease catecholamine-stimulated cAMP formation. The effect can be blocked by prior activation of the system with isoproterenol + p[NH]ppG. 0.6 percent glutaraldehyde treatment of membranes has substantial effects on both F(-)- and catecholamine-stimulated cAMP production. The effects are blocked by prior activation of the adenylate cyclase complex with NaF, but not by isoproterenol + p[NH]ppG. Glutaraldehyde at these concentrations has no effect on Mn++-stimulated cAMP formation. The data is discussed with respect to the organization of the major macromolecular components of the adenylate cyclase complex as it exists within the native membrane prior to and following activation of the system.", 
    "59": "A double blind randomised study of 154 patients with myocardial infarction assigned to metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) and 147 assigned to placebo compared the effects of treatment in relation to health state over three years. Health state was evaluated by a new method based on the average number of days spent in each of seven mutually exclusive categories of health. The scale took into account death, history of serious complications, functional state, and side effects of treatment. Of the maximum attainable 1095 days alive during the three years patients given metoprolol attained 992 days and those given placebo 964 days. During the period alive the metoprolol treated group spent an average of 278 days in an optimal functional state as compared with 176 days for the placebo treated group. This included 221 and 156 days respectively in a completely asymptomatic state (that is, without either cardiac symptoms or side effects of treatment). The time spent with a serious non-fatal complication was shortened by 56 days in the metoprolol group. The overall differences between the groups were statistically significant (p = 0.03). Aside from bringing an improved quality of life after myocardial infarction, metoprolol may add up to one month to life expectancy for three years of treatment.", 
    "60": "The effect of 2-(2-methyl-indazol-4-imino)-imidazoline (Sgd 101/75) on the rate of urea synthesis by isolated rat hepatocytes was studied. This agent was observed to stimulate ureagenesis through the activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors (prazosin-sensitive). The effect of Sgd 101/75 was dependent on the presence of calcium and was not affected by insulin. The active phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, blocked the effect of Sgd 101/75. It was also observed that this adrenoceptor agonist was unable to stimulate ureagenesis in hepatocytes obtained from hypothyroid rats but produced clear stimulation of this metabolic pathway in cells obtained from adrenalectomized rats. The data indicate that this agonist stimulates hepatic metabolism through a calcium-dependent, insulin-insensitive pathway for alpha 1-adrenergic action, modulated by the thyroid status of the animal.", 
    "61": "Correlation between contractile activity and norepinephrine (NE) release induced by electrical stimulation or by high K+ depolarization has been analyzed in isolated preparations of mouse uterus throughout the different stages of the estrous cycle. Both the contractile activity induced by electrical stimulation and the capacity to maintain contracture, after changing the physiological bathing solution by high K+ solution, followed the same pattern: estrous greater than proestrous greater than diestrous greater than metestrous. High-K+ induced 3H-NE release was also different according to the stage of the estrous cycle. 3H-NE release was significantly less in estrous than in diestrous uterine horns. EC50 values for inhibiting contractile response, for isoprenaline, norepinephrine and phenylephrine were significantly greater in metestrous than in other stages of the estrous cycle. On the other hand, reserpinized mouse uteri showed an increase in EC50 values in the stages tested. The data support the hypothesis that in a mouse uterus, sex steroid hormones could affect beta-adrenergic receptor function indirectly, perhaps through an action on adrenergic neurons by a mechanism affecting NE release from sympathetic terminals.", 
    "62": "The beta-blocking agent carteolol hydrochloride differs slightly from other beta-blockers by its intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Its effect on intraocular pressure and heart rate was tested in a comparison with timolol maleate, as was subjective tolerance of it, in 28 eyes (14 subjects) with either ocular hypertension or simple chronic open-angle glaucoma. The two drugs had a similar effect on intraocular pressure; both were well tolerated subjectively. Carteolol lowered heart rate more in patients with higher heart rates, while timolol lowered it more in patients with lower heart rates.", 
    "63": "Changes in isovolumetric (IRRC) and auxovolumetric (ARRC) relaxation rate constants in response to inotropic and mechanical influences were studied experimentally in 23 narcotized cats. IRRC was determined by the slope of the curve of isovolumic relaxation pressure, expressed as natural logarithms, in relation to time. ARRC was determined on the basis of auxovolumetric relaxation pressure values. A pressure variation between 100 and 180 mmHg over one cycle had no noticeable effect on either IRRC or ARRC; those only diminished as the pressure rose beyond 200 mmHg. Electric stimulation of heart rate before and after propranolol administration raised both IRRC and ARRC, the latter showing twice the increment of the former. ARRC was also more sensitive to blood Ca2+, as compared to IRRC, that was measured by means of intravenous administration of CaCl2 and sodium citrate. It is concluded that ARRC is more indicative of myocardial relaxation, as compared to IRRC or relaxation time constant.", 
    "64": "The hypotensive action of diltiazem by oral administration to conscious renal hypertensive dogs (one kidney, one figure 8) was studied and the effect was compared with that of nifedipine. Diltiazem decreased mean blood pressure 10-20 mmHg at doses of 1-4 mg/kg. The same doses of nifedipine exhibited hypotensive actions similar to diltiazem, but nifedipine induced a more pronounced reflex tachycardia than diltiazem. Combined administration of diltiazem with pindolol produced a greater hypotension than that caused by individual drugs and caused an increase in heart rate, smaller than by pindolol alone and larger than by diltiazem alone. When 60 mg of diltiazem was administered 3 times a day for 10 consecutive days, blood pressure decreased 15 mmHg on the third day or later. Although the time course of plasma level of diltiazem on the last day was similar to that on the first day, the heart rate initially increased slightly and decreased later. Prolongation of the PQ interval of an electrocardiogram was diminished after the fourth day. In conclusion, diltiazem decreased blood pressure of renal hypertensive dogs at doses comparable to those used for clinical treatment in acute and chronic experiments.", 
    "65": "Three kinds of suppositories were constructed with oleaginous base material (Witepsol H-15): a conventional type suppository containing propranolol (PPL) hydrochloride mixed with a base material (I), a hollow type suppository containing PPL in a form of aqueous solution (PPL was dissolved in isotonic NaCl solution) in its cavity (II), a hollow type suppository containing PPL as powder (hydrochloride salt) in its cavity (III). Bioavailability was estimated after rectal administration of each suppository in rabbits and compared with oral administration. The peak plasma PPL concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were lower with I than with II or III. The Cmax and the AUC measured after rectal administration of III were significantly higher than those in the case of oral administration. By using III, the highest values of the mean Cmax (795 +/- 160 ng/ml) and of the mean AUC (459 +/- 21 h X ng/ml) were obtained. It was found that systemic availability was increased by rectal administration of PPL hollow type suppositories. These data on bioavailability suggested that PPL was absorbed more efficiently with the hollow type suppository than with the conventional one. PPL was released faster from II and III than from I. It was concluded that the hollow type suppository was a suitable device for absorption of PPL into the rectum.", 
    "66": "The effects of a biologically active water-soluble splenic material on the rat blood pressure are described. The endovenous perfusion of the splenic material in acidified and alkalinized forms caused significant increases of the mean blood pressure in normal, vagotomized and pithed rats, showing that, in contradiction to previous reports, changes in pH did not affect its hypertensive activity. In normal rats, the hypertensive responses were not affected by the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists: tolazoline, ergotoxine and propranolol, supporting the previously stated view that adrenergic mechanisms are not involved. In addition, the aforementioned results obtained in vagotomized and pithed rats suggest a lack of involvement of cardiac and vascular nervous mechanisms.", 
    "67": "The metabolism and ocular binding of practolol were investigated after oral administration of 14C-practolol to hamsters treated with three modifiers of mixed-function oxidase activity: piperonyl butoxide, cobalt chloride or phenobarbitone. The major urinary metabolites of practolol were 3-hydroxypractolol and polar metabolites which included glucuronide conjugates. A number of unidentified metabolites constituted a minor portion of urinary radioactivity. Each pretreatment modified both the urinary excretion pattern (0-24 h) of practolol and its metabolites and also the metabolite profile of eye extracts 24 h after an oral dose. None of the modifiers of mixed-function oxidase activity had any significant effect on the ocular binding (both extractable and non-extractable components) of practolol and its metabolites. The results indicated that the non-extractable component was neither practolol nor 3-hydroxypractolol.", 
    "68": "The influence of subpartal beta-sympathicomimetic tocolysis on a subsequent Caesarean section with halothane as inhalational anaesthetic was examined in 42 pregnant women. Alterations in the heart rate, blood pressure and heart action during the operation were measured. 23 patients (group \"bolus\") received fenoterol monotherapy. In 19 patients (group \"iv-tocolysis\") fenoterol was combined with the cardioselective beta-1-blocking agent metoprolol. In comparison with these two groups, 25 pregnant women without tocolysis were examined as controls. There were only slight differences in heart rate and blood pressure between the three groups. Arrhythmias were registered in 42 percent of the cases, in most cases during light anaesthesia before delivery. Sinus tachycardias with a heart rate of 130 beats per minute or more were observed most frequently. Arrhythmias of ectopic origin and sinus bradycardias, however, were found seldom. The incidence of arrhythmias in the three groups during Caesarean section did not differ significantly. There was no evidence for an increased occurrence of arrhythmias following beta-sympathicomimetic tocolysis.", 
    "69": "Beta-adrenoceptor blockers used in the medical management of portal hypertension decrease liver blood flow. The sporadic onset of hepatic encephalopathy during propranolol treatment was ascribed to this decrease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of chronic treatment with nadolol on liver blood flow and liver function. Nadolol, a non-cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker, has been reported to be as powerful as propranolol in decreasing portal pressure. Before and after 1 month of treatment with nadolol at a dose reducing heart rate by 25%, in 15 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension, the following parameters were determined: hepatic venous pressure gradient, hepatic blood flow, galactose eliminating capacity, aminopyrine metabolic activity, ICG clearance and intrinsic hepatic clearance. Hepatic venous pressure gradient and hepatic blood flow were decreased by nadolol. However liver function was not affected by the drug. We conclude that, despite a lowered hepatic blood flow, liver function is not affected by 1 month of nadolol treatment.", 
    "70": "This study re-examines the proposal that beta-adrenoceptor blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity decrease plasma noradrenaline levels. Thirteen patients (aged 29-65 years) with uncomplicated essential hypertension were randomly allocated to a three period, double-blind cross-over trial. The treatment periods, each of 3 weeks duration, were composed of placebo, pindolol (5 mg twice daily) and metoprolol (100 mg twice daily), dispensed in identical capsules. At the end of each treatment period, patients were exercised on a bicycle ergometer to a predetermined workload. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured before, immediately on completion of exercise and after 10 min post-exercise rest. Blood samples for plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline determination were also collected at these times. Blood pressures were similar during treatment with pindolol and metoprolol. As expected, heart rate was consistently lower during metoprolol treatment. Basal, pre-exercise plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline were similar at the end of each treatment period. However, the increase following exercise was significantly greater during metoprolol treatment. The post-exercise increase during pindolol treatment was indistinguishable from that in the placebo period. These findings, in a randomised placebo-controlled study, therefore demonstrate that pindolol does not influence basal or exercise-stimulated plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations. This is best explained by a lack of effect of pindolol on the plasma clearance of catecholamines, which is impaired by beta-adrenoceptor blockers devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.", 
    "71": "The pharmacodynamic effect of a homologous series of aminomethyldimethyl-(methoxyphenyl)-silane derivatives have been tested on isolated guinea-pig left atria. All molecules increase the force of contraction to different degrees by a partly direct and partly indirect mechanism (measured on atria isolated from reserpine treated guinea-pigs). The positive inotropic effect is reduced by bupranolol. Furthermore the compounds show an antagonistic effect to orciprenaline. The membrane stabilising action is lowest for those compounds showing the highest inotropic effects and vice versa."
