    "1": "In both experimental and human studies, ACE inhibitors have shown a clear tendency to perform better than other types of antihypertensive therapy in reversing cardiac structural changes. A recent meta-analysis of 109 studies showed that ACE inhibitors were more effective than beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and diuretics in reducing left ventricular mass. Furthermore, cardiac hypertrophy was reversed to a significantly greater extent with enalapril than hydrochlorothiazide in a long-term study of previously untreated men. Multivariate analyses of the results from that study showed that the reversal of cardiac hypertrophy was independently related to the blockade of the circulating renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore, experimental studies have shown that ACE inhibition can induce reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy even without a fall in blood pressure.",

    "3": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors seems to have independent significance for the reversal of cardiac hypertrophy. However, we still do not know whether it is the attenuation of angiotensin II (locally or systemically), apart from a fall in blood pressure, that is the most important effect of ACE inhibition. Therefore, results from future studies on the ability of angiotensin II antagonists to affect left ventricular hypertrophy, in comparison with ACE inhibitors, are awaited with great interest, especially regarding the differential effects on myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis.", 
    "4": "It has been shown that central transduction of the input from arterial baroreceptors shows bandpass characteristics. Previous studies have demonstrated that anesthesia may affect the gain of arterial baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity, but whether anesthesia affects the frequency response of central transduction of the arterial baroreflex system is not known. We examined cardiac cycle-related oscillation of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RNA) in conscious (n = 5) and alpha-chloralose-anesthetized (n = 10) rabbits. Power spectra of arterial pressure and RNA were obtained at rest, after i.v. propranolol and after i.v. isoproterenol. At rest with a cardiac cycle at about 5 Hz, cardiac cycle-related oscillation of RNA was observed in conscious rabbits, but it was not present or markedly attenuated in anesthetized rabbits. As the cardiac cycle was slowed by propranolol in anesthetized rabbits, cardiac cycle-related oscillation of RNA gradually appeared. These results suggest that alpha-chloralose anesthesia in rabbits narrowed the bandpass region of the central baroreflex system so that the baroreceptor input at a high frequency (above 5 Hz) was no longer transduced into RNA.", 
    "5": "The effect was studied of 8 weeks of treatment with propranolol and pindolol on the left-ventricular myocardium mass, left-ventricular myocardium mass index, plasma renin activity, and serum aldosterone and total catecholamine concentrations. The studies were carried out in 72 patients with essential arterial hypertension of slight degree. A statistically significant decrease was shown of the left-ventricular myocardium mass, left-ventricular myocardium mass index, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone concentration in all studied patients. A decrease of total catecholamine concentration appeared in patients treated with propranolol. Weaker effect of pindolol on the studied parameters may be connected with its intrinsic sympathicomimetic activity. A correlation was shown between the decrease of the left-ventricular myocardium mass, and the decrease of systolic arterial blood pressure.", 
    "6": "The data shows that Fisher rats treated with propranolol, betamethasone or exposed to cobalt60-treatment before challenge with T. gondii exhibit an impaired resistance to this opportunistic parasite infection. In fact, in rats propranolol-treatment induces an increase mortality rate up to 66.6% (P < 0.01, with respect to controls). Whereas betamethasone or cobalt60-treatment induces an increased of mortality rate about 33.3% (P < 0.05 respectively, with respect to unirradiated rats). In contrast to beta blocker, corticosteroid-treated or irradiated rats, beta adrenergic-treated rats do not significantly differ from untreated rats in their time of survival. These data lead the authors to hypothesise that in rats the natural resistance to T. gondii can be modulate beta adrenergics or corticosteroids.", 
    "7": "Within the relationship of the structure and effect of new beta-adrenolytic agents derivatived from p-hydroxyacetophenone and p-hydroxypropiophenone with a propoxymethyl group in the lipophilic part of the molecule and with a propanamine, a butanamine and a pyrrolidine in the side-chain were studied. In order to prepare these substances, a procedure was selected from several tested ones, in which 4-hydroxy-3propoxymethylphenylketone were treated with chloromethyloxirane and subsequent reaction a hydrobromic acid were prepared 4-(3-brom-2-hydroxypropoxy)-3-propoxymethylalkylketone. Final substances were prepared reaction with amine. The structure of prepared compounds was confirmed on the basic interpretation of the IR, UV and 1H NMR spectra. The results of pharmacological evaluation of selected compounds showed a significant beta 1-blocking activity lower than acebutolol. Their local anesthetic activity is low according with their partition coefficients. The characteristic of the prepared compounds was supplemented by the determination of their partition coefficients, surface tension, dissociation constants and acute toxicity.", 
    "8": "The use of phenylboronic acid (PBA) solid-phase extraction cartridges for the extraction of a range of beta-blockers from aqueous buffer and plasma has been investigated and compared with other phases commonly used for solid-phase extraction. PBA was found to provide an efficient means for the extraction of this class of compound from simple aqueous buffer systems. Extraction from buffers was pH-dependent and gave optimum results at approximately pH 8. Extraction from plasma was less efficient for some of the test compounds; this matrix effect was probably due to protein binding. Chromatography showed that plasma extracts were free of major sources of interference.",

    "10": "A series of ester prodrugs of propranolol was synthesized by incorporating substituents (straight alkyl, branched alkyl, acyloxyalkyl and cycloalkyl) into the beta-hydroxy function of propranolol with the aim of protecting the drug against first-pass metabolism following oral administration. The in-vitro hydrolysis rates of the prodrugs were, in increasing order, liver homogenate > plasma > buffers. The pH-rate profile of the prodrugs showed maximum stability around pH 4.0; the hydrolysis rates were drastically increased over pH 6.8. QSAR analysis revealed hydrophobic (pi) and electronic (sigma) effects of the substituents play the main roles for prodrug hydrolysis in buffers and plasma, while hydrolysis in liver homogenate could not be well explained by any of these parameters. Four prodrugs (O-acetyl-, O-butyryl-, O-isovaleryl- and O-cyclopropanoyl-propranolol) were selected for oral administration based on their hydrolysis in-vitro. Following oral administration of prodrugs to beagle dogs the absolute bioavailabilities (F) of propranolol were about 2-4-fold that after an equivalent dose of propranolol. The prodrugs were rapidly absorbed and regenerated propranolol to attain peak plasma levels at 0-0.5h. Intact prodrug levels were also observed, which varied depending on their respective stabilities in in-vitro media. A linear relationship between F of propranolol and log P was obtained. F further appeared to be parabolically dependent on the observed hydrolysis rates of prodrugs in liver homogenate suggesting optimal design manipulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "We report on a patient who developed hypersensitivity pneumonitis during treatment with the beta-blocker, celiprolol. The clinical picture was a severe alveolitis, with compromised gas exchange. Inadvertent subsequent rechallenge with celiprolol led to recurrence of the pneumonitis, 10 weeks after drug readministration. Again, the pneumonitis was fully reversible. Lymphocytes were elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage, and progressively normalized upon discontinuation of the drug. This case is reminiscent of pneumonitis to other beta-blockers, which are reviewed here.",

    "16": "There was no difference in exercise induced increases in heart rate, but after treatment with bisoprolol the dose of salbutamol required to increase heart rate by 40 beats/min was 1.9 micrograms/kg compared with 2.9 micrograms/kg after placebo (p < 0.005). The fall in diastolic blood pressure was not significantly different on the two occasions. Hypokalaemia induced by salbutamol, but not hyperglycaemia or hyperinsulinaemia, was enhanced after bisoprolol.", 
    "17": "This study shows that treatment with a beta 1 blocker in vivo leads to sensitisation of cardiac beta 2 adrenoreceptors but not cardiac beta 1 adrenoreceptors or vascular beta 2 receptors. This previously unrecognised form of receptor cross sensitisation in the heart may noticeably diminish the efficacy of selective beta 1 blockade in preventing arrhythmias in patients with ischaemic heart disease. These findings reopen the question of which type of beta blocker is more appropriate for such patients.", 
    "18": "Ten to 15 years ago, the thrust of research in the treatment of congestive heart failure centered around finding new inotropic agents. While initially useful, these agents given chronically actually accelerated left ventricular failure and were associated with excess mortality. Recently, it has been learned that altering the body's response to heart failure is more beneficial compared to attempts to stimulate left ventricular inotropic function. Such altering of the neurohumoral responses to heart failure has been associated with improvements in both morbidity and mortality.", 
    "19": "Plasma prolactin concentrations were measured in unanaesthetized male rats before and after stereotaxic microinjection of adrenergic agents into the mediobasal and preoptic-anterior hypothalamus. In the mediobasal hypothalamus injection of the alpha 2 agonist clonidine produced a dose-dependent increase in prolactin secretion over the dose range 0.1 to 10 nmoles, the stimulation due to 1 nmole being blocked by idazoxan (alpha 2 antagonist). Stimulation of prolactin release was also caused by isoprenaline (beta agonist) and was significantly reduced by the beta antagonist propranolol. The beta 2 agonist salbutamol was also effective in stimulating prolactin secretion. However, the adrenergic agonists, noradrenaline (mixed alpha and beta), phenylephrine (alpha 1) and tyramine (sympathomimetic) failed to affect prolactin secretion. In the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus clonidine caused a dose-dependent increase in prolactin secretion over the dose range 0.001 to 10 nmoles, the stimulation due to 0.1 nmole being abolished by idazoxan. While prolactin levels were significantly elevated by noradrenaline and tyramine, phenylephrine was ineffective. We conclude that the activation of alpha 2 and beta 2 adrenoceptors in the mediobasal hypothalamus and of alpha 2 adrenoceptors in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus, on or near prolactin-regulating neurons, results in increased prolactin secretion. An alpha 1 inhibitory action in the mediobasal hypothalamus has however not been ruled out. Adrenergic inputs in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus appear to exert a predominant facilitatory effect on prolactin secretion.", 
    "20": "To investigate the role of endogenous catecholamines and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the control of growth hormone (GH) secretion, secretory profiles of GH and prolactin were measured in conscious, male rats following intravenous administration of either 1) alpha 2 antagonist idazoxan 2 mg/kg, a dose that blocked alpha 2 agonist induced GH rise, 2) alpha 1 antagonist prazosin 1 mg/kg, 3) non-specific beta-blocker propranolol 1.5 mg/kg, a dose that prevented beta 2 agonist (salbutamol) induced inhibition, 4) serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine 0.5 mg/kg, a dose that inhibited serotonin agonist quipazine induced GH rise, or 5) control. No drug altered mean GH or prolactin levels and pulsatile GH release persisted. Unilateral injections of prazosin, propranolol and idazoxan were made into the medial basal hypothalamus and preoptic-anterior hypothalamic area and of cyproheptadine into the medial basal hypothalamus, all with no effect on short-term GH release. GH and prolactin secretory profiles were measured after giving rats 6 units/kg intravenous insulin. Blood glucose levels fell to less than 50% basal. Hypoglycaemia caused a non-significant 30% fall in mean 2 h GH. Intravenous idazoxan, prazosin, propranolol and cyproheptadine (doses as in first study) did not modify the blood glucose fall, but idazoxan produced a significant reduction of mean GH compared to insulin alone (4 +/- 1.1 ng/ml SEM, idazoxan/insulin versus 16 +/- 5.6 ng/ml, saline/insulin). The lack of an effect of alpha- and beta-blockers on normal, pulsatile GH release is against a role for endogenous catecholamines in controlling this release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "1. To investigate the effects of acute beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade on sympathetic nervous activity, cardiac and whole-body noradrenaline kinetics were determined during intravenous infusions of saline placebo and of metoprolol (10-15 mg plus 150 micrograms min-1 kg-1) in 10 patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization, in whom beta-adrenoceptor antagonists had been discontinued for 7 days. 2. Coronary haemodynamics were measured in these 10 patients plus two others. Compared with saline placebo, metoprolol administration was associated with decreases in heart rate (68 +/- 2 to 59 +/- 3 beats/min, P < 0.001) and coronary sinus blood flow (86 +/- 8 to 68 +/- 6 ml/min, P < 0.001) and an increase in calculated coronary vascular resistance (1.42 +/- 0.19 to 1.75 +/- 0.22 mmHg min ml-1, P < 0.001). Arterial and femoral venous noradrenaline concentrations, whole-body noradrenaline clearance and whole-body noradrenaline spillover to arterial plasma did not change. In contrast, cardiac noradrenaline spillover (33.7 +/- 5.1 to 20.2 +/- 4.3 pmol/min, P < 0.05) and cardiac noradrenaline clearance (31 +/- 3 to 23 +/- 3 ml/min, P < 0.001) were significantly decreased during metoprolol administration. 3. These results may be explained by inhibition of pre-junctional facilitatory beta-adrenoceptors, which we hypothesize may be predominantly of the beta 1-subtype in the heart and of the beta 2-subtype in the periphery.", 
    "22": "The effects of amino acids on intrinsic cardiac neuronal activity identified in 10 anesthetized dogs were investigated. Local injection of small volumes (1-10 microliters) of the excitatory amino acids, glutamate (100 mM) and aspartate (10 mM), and the inhibitory amino acids, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA; 10 mM) and glycine (10 mM), modified the activity of 39 of 50 identified neurons. Spontaneous activity of eight neurons was modified by both excitatory and inhibitory amino acids. Cardiodynamic responses accompanied neuronal activity modification in 15 instances. After acute decentralization, repeat doses of amino acids altered the activity of 21 neurons and elicited cardiovascular responses in 7 instances. Neuronal and cardiovascular responses were elicited after atropine administration. Neuronal but not cardiac responses were elicited after subsequent timolol administration. In other animals, GABA but not other amino acids elicited neuronal and cardiodynamic responses after hexamethonium administration in decentralized preparations, indicating that non-nicotinic synapses were involved in some GABA-induced responses. These results demonstrate that excitatory and inhibitory amino acids can modify intrinsic cardiac neuronal activity such that, as a consequence, cardiac variables can be modified.", 
    "23": "To evaluate the hypothesis that lactate supply is essential to maintain euglycemia during iron deficiency, female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to iron-sufficient (50 mg Fe2+/kg diet, +Fe), or iron-deficient (15 mg Fe2+/kg diet, -Fe) dietary groups and were injected with a specific beta 2-adrenergic inhibitor, ICI 118,551 (1.0 mg/kg body wt). Rats were studied at rest or after 30 min of running at 13.4 m/min 0% grade. Dietary iron deficiency decreased hemoglobin concentration 38%, but resting arterial concentrations of glucose ([Glc]), lactate ([La]), or alanine ([Ala]) were unaffected. Administration of ICI 118,551 (beta 2-blockade) decreased [La] and [Glc] 52 and 32% in resting -Fe rats, respectively. beta 2-Blockade attenuated the exercise-induced rise in [La] and decreased [Glc] 31% in exercising -Fe rats. [Ala] were unaffected by iron deficiency or exercise but decreased 24 and 18% because of beta 2-blockade in resting and exercising +Fe rats. Iron deficiency depleted resting liver glycogen concentration 45%, with no additional effect of exercise or beta 2-blockade. beta-Blockade decreased arterial insulin and increased arterial glucagon concentrations in resting -Fe and +Fe rats. During exercise glucagon concentration increased significantly more in -Fe than +Fe rats. Decreased arterial [La] with a corresponding decrease in arterial [Glc] in response to beta 2-blockade support the contention that lactate supply is critical to maintenance of euglycemia in -Fe rats at rest and during exercise.", 
    "24": "The beta-3 adrenoceptor protein lacks most of the potential phosphorylation sites for beta adrenoceptor kinase and protein kinase A. In addition, it exhibits a lower affinity toward norepinephrine than beta-1 or beta-2 adrenoceptors. It is thus expected that beta-3 adrenoceptors could be less implicated in desensitization processes than the beta-1 or beta-2 adrenoceptors. An attempt to demonstrate the physiological relevance of this prediction was performed by using fat cells having a beta-3 adrenergic responsiveness or not (hamster and guinea pig). The influence of prolonged in vivo exposure to norepinephrine on the beta adrenoceptor-mediated lipolytic responses was investigated in both species. In control guinea pigs, isoproterenol, norepinephrine and epinephrine were fully lipolytic, whereas BRL 37344 [(R',R')-4-2[2-((2[(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino] propyl)phenyl]phenoxyacetic acid], CGP 12177](+-)-4-(3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)- benzimidazole-2-on hydrochloride] and other beta-3 agonists were inefficient, whereas hamster adipocytes exhibited maximal response to the beta-3 agonists. Blockade of the lipolytic effect of isoproterenol in the guinea pig gave a rank order of beta antagonists [CGP 20712A (1-[2-(3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxyphenoxy)ethylamino]-3-4-(1-methyl-4-tr i-fluoro-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)phenoxy-2-propanol methanesulfonate] > bupranolol > or = propranolol > ICI 118551 [erythrodl-1-(7- methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminobutan-2-ol)] in agreement with that of a beta-1 effect. In contrast, the selective beta-1 antagonist CGP 20712A did not counteract the effect of BRL 37344 in hamsters and bupranolol was the best beta antagonist tested; a result arguing for the predominance of a beta-3 component in the adrenergic activation of lipolysis, as in rat fat cells. In treated guinea pigs (6-day treatment with osmotic minipumps delivering norepinephrine at the rate of 5 micrograms/min/kg), the adrenocorticotropic hormone dose-response curve was identical to that of controls, but the curves for isoproterenol, norepinephrine and epinephrine were flattened and shifted to the right. A down-regulation of beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors was evidenced by a reduction in [3H]CGP 12177 high-affinity binding sites. In treated hamsters, compared to the controls, there was no change in the lipolytic response to the beta adrenergic agonists. Other protocols of chronic exposure to norepinephrine (e.g., daily injections) at different doses were also unable to reduce the beta-lipolytic effect in the hamster fat cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Esmolol hydrochloride was administered by constant-rate continuous infusion to 10 patients undergoing hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary artery revascularization surgery. After a suitable loading dose, the esmolol infusion was started approximately 30 minutes before bypass and was stopped 10 minutes after termination of bypass. Esmolol concentrations were measured in arterial and venous blood samples collected before and after bypass and in samples taken from the inflow and outflow ports of the membrane oxygenator during bypass. Blood esmolol concentrations increased during hypothermia in a manner that correlated significantly and inversely with temperature. All patients were separated from the extracorporeal circulation without difficulty, and the average arterial esmolol concentration was slightly below the prebypass concentration within minutes of discontinuing bypass. Esmolol disappeared from the blood rapidly on terminating the infusion. There was no difference between esmolol concentrations measured simultaneously from the inflow and outflow ports of the membrane oxygenator during bypass, but radial arterial esmolol concentrations before and after bypass were on average about sevenfold higher than forearm venous esmolol concentrations during the esmolol infusion. The results of this study lead to two important conclusions: (1) in vivo clearance of esmolol demonstrates acute temperature dependence and (2) esmolol is removed irreversibly as it passes through the microcirculation of the hand, making measurement of peripheral esmolol concentrations markedly dependent on sampling site (arterial versus venous).", 
    "26": "To elucidate the role of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in the mechanism of intragastric nicotine protection against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury, the following studies were performed. At 0.5-hr prior to the injury study, rats were pretreated with: subcutaneous control, prazosin (0.5 mg/kg) or yohimbine (5 mg/kg) to block alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenoceptors; or intraperitoneal control, metoprolol (2 mg/kg) or butoxamine (4 mg/kg) to block beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors, respectively. At 1-hr intervals, rats received intragastric vehicle or nicotine (4 mg/kg) and 40% ethanol (10 ml/kg). Total lengths of the linear gastric corpus mucosal lesions were measured by an unbiased observer using a caliper. In a separate study, 0.5-hr after subcutaneous control or yohimbine (5 mg/kg), rats were treated with intragastric vehicle or nicotine (4 mg/kg). One hour later, gastric mucus volume, gastric juice volume and pH, and titratable acid in the gastric juice were measured. In the rat stomach, the intragastric nicotine protection against 40% ethanol-induced mucosal injury was not blocked by selective alpha 1-(prazosin), beta 1-(metoprolol), or beta 2-(butoxamine) adrenoceptor antagonists. The protection was significantly reduced although not completely abolished by selective alpha 2-(yohimbine) adrenoceptor antagonist. Yohimbine also significantly reduced basal and nicotine-stimulated increase in gastric mucus volume. These data suggest that alpha 2-adrenoceptors are involved in the protective effect of intragastric nicotine against 40% ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury possibly by a mucus-dependent mechanism.", 
    "27": "The main goal of therapy in atrial fibrillation is to restore sinus rhythm, if this is possible, to avoid adverse hemodynamic, electrical, and embolic consequences. The restoration of sinus rhythm is urgent if the patient is unstable. In a stable patient, if the duration is shorter than 48 hours and an atrial thrombus is unlikely, then sinus rhythm can be restored after initial rate control. If the duration of atrial fibrillation is more than 48 hours, the embolic risk may be significant, and anticoagulation will be required for 2 to 4 weeks before an attempt at cardioversion. In patients in whom sinus rhythm cannot be restored or maintained, the goal of therapy is rate control and reduction of embolic risk unless the risk of anticoagulation outweighs its benefit. In difficult cases, rate control may be accomplished with AV nodal ablation and pacemaker implantation or with one of the surgical procedures described above with varying degrees of normalization of the physiology. Although not included in this flow chart, we do not advocate episodic intermittent therapy for patients with infrequent episodes of atrial fibrillation because this could be potentially dangerous and may place the patient at a higher risk for developing proarrhythmia.",

Estimation of beta-receptor concentration was based on a graphic method applied on myocardial PET time-concentration curves obtained after an intravenous injection of 11C-CGP followed 30 minutes later by a coinjection of labeled and unlabeled CGP. The clinical tolerance of these injections was good. Left ventricular concentration of beta-receptors was decreased in patients compared with controls (3.12 +/- 0.51 versus 6.60 +/- 1.18 pmol/mL, respectively; p < 0.001). This 53% decrease agrees with previous in vitro data. In eight of the 10 patients, the beta-receptor concentration obtained from PET was compared with the beta-receptor density determined on left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy samples by in vitro binding technique using 3H-CGP-12177. Results obtained with both techniques were correlated (r = 0.79, p = 0.019). Moreover, decreased beta-receptor concentration correlated with the beta-contractile responsiveness to intracoronary dobutamine infusion (r = 0.83, p = 0.003), indicating a direct link between changes in the receptor number and its biological function.",

Exercise time, invasive hemodynamic data (12- and 24-h monitoring) and variables of left ventricular function were examined at baseline and after 3 months of orally administered nebivolol (1 to 5 mg/day, n = 11) or placebo (n = 13).",

Similar hemodynamic results were obtained in the catheterization laboratory. Analysis of high fidelity measurements of left ventricular pressure showed a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in the nebivolol group (group mean 21 to 15 vs. 24 to 20 mm Hg with placebo) but no change in the maximal rate of pressure development or in two variables of left ventricular relaxation (maximal negative rate of change of left ventricular pressure [dP/dtmax] and the time constant tau). Left ventricular mass decreased (p = 0.04). Despite a decrease in heart rate with nebivolol, there was a slight decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (p = NS). End-systolic volume tended to decrease (p = 0.07) despite no reduction in end-systolic stress. The net result was a significant increase in ejection fraction (group mean 0.23 to 0.33 vs. 0.21 to 0.23 with placebo), presumably as a result of an increase in contractile performance. This effect was corroborated by an increase in a relatively load-independent variable of myocardial performance.",

Accordingly, we studied 18 conscious dogs, instrumented to measure micromanometer LV and left atrial (LA) pressures and determine LV volume from three dimensions. CHF was produced by 4-5 weeks of right ventricular rapid pacing. Before CHF, exercise (5.5-8.5 mph for 8-15 minutes) increased the maximum rate of LV filling (dV/dtmax) (197 +/- 37 versus 297 +/- 56 ml/sec [mean +/- SD], p < 0.05) in response to an increase in the maximum early diastolic LA to LV pressure gradient (5.8 +/- 2.0 versus 9.8 +/- 1.9 mm Hg, p < 0.05) produced by a fall in minimum LV pressure (1.0 +/- 2.9 versus -3.9 +/- 3.1 mm Hg, p < 0.01), whereas mean LA pressure was unchanged (6.4 +/- 3.1 versus 6.4 +/- 4.2 mm Hg, p = NS). The time constant of LV relaxation was shortened (28.1 +/- 3.2 versus 21.0 +/- 4.2 msec, p < 0.05). After CHF, dV/dtmax (141 +/- 51 versus 200 +/- 59 ml/sec, p < 0.05) and the maximum LA to LV pressure gradient (6.0 +/- 1.1 versus 11.1 +/- 2.7 mm Hg, p < 0.05) continued to increase with exercise (3-5.0 mph for 4-8 minutes). However, the time constant of LV relaxation was prolonged (35.6 +/- 4.8 versus 38.9 +/- 5.5 msec, p < 0.05), and minimum LV pressure (15.1 +/- 5.6 versus 17.6 +/- 5.9 mm Hg, p < 0.05) and mean LA pressure increased (22.6 +/- 7.2 versus 29.1 +/- 7.3 mm Hg, p < 0.05). These altered effects of exercise on LV diastolic filling dynamics persisted when heart rate and wall stress during exercise before and after CHF were matched by varying the level of exercise. We conclude that, during normal exercise, mitral valve flow is augmented by a fall of early diastolic LV pressure without a rise in LA pressure. After CHF, early diastolic LV pressure does not fall but increases during exercise. Thus, the increase in the early diastolic LA to LV pressure gradient and the rate of mitral valve flow results from an increase in LA pressure during exercise after CHF. This study suggests that the failure of the enhancement of LV relaxation and an increase in early diastolic LV pressure with exercise after CHF may contribute to exercise intolerance in CHF.",

Simultaneous pharmacological blockade by propranolol's injections of neuroconductive and humoral pathways of transmission to the kidneys of pathological stimulus, caused in result of chronic irritation of sciatic nerve, prevents the development of disturbance in kidney's mineralocorticoid receptor apparatus functioning to a more extent, than the blockade of the neuroconductive pathway only. The obtained results point out that propranolol is a substance, which may prevent the development of neurogenic dystrophies.", 
    "38": "We examined the kinetics study of serum enzyme after the administration of beta-blocking agents or alpha-stimulator in the experimental rats. Following the administration of beta-blocking agents, propranolol and pindolol, the serum levels of adenylate kinase, aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase as well as that of creatine kinase increased in rats. The same was observed following the administration of noradrenaline (an alpha-stimulator). Isoenzyme pattern indicated that most of these enzymes were considered to be released from muscular tissues. There were also changes in serum calcium, inorganic phosphorus and magnesium, concurrently with the release of the enzymes into the serum.", 
    "39": "The role of the sympathetic nervous system in the regulation of bone marrow hematopoiesis has been studied on mice CBA after administration of 5-fluorouracil (114 mg/kg). The double injection (3-5 minutes before and 5 hours after 5 + U) of ganglionic blocking drug (pentamine, 6 mg/kg), alpha-adrenergic (dihydroergotamine, 3.9 mg/kg) or beta-adrenergic antagonists (propranolol, 5 mg/kg) inhibited the post-cytostatic reparation of erythro- and granulocytopoiesis. Besides, addition of the same neurotropic antagonists and 5-FU (10(-7) M) to bone marrow culture led to 1.5-3 fold decrease of cell content in comparison with alone cytostatic after 24 hours incubation. On the contrary injection of neuroblocking agents (twice in 5 hours) on day 3 after 5-FU administration elevated the total count of erythroid cells immature and mature granulocytic leukocytes in bone marrow and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in blood. Thus, the unequal role of the sympathetic nervous system in the regulation of hematopoiesis at the different periods after high dose of 5-FU administration has been demonstrated.",

Pretreatment of either phentolamine, Propranolol or methyl atropine (i.v.) could markedly reduce the depressor response, indicating that the sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve, the cardia sympathetic nerve and cardiac vagal nerve all are involved in the hypotensive response.", 
    "41": "The present study was carried out in ten cats which did not attack the rats spontaneously. Predatory attack on a rat was produced by lateral hypothalamic stimulation using mean current strength of 340-690uA. This attack was accompanied by minimal affective display and culminated in neck biting. It was found that norepinephrine (NE) when microinjected into dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) region in doses of 2, 4 and 10ug significantly lowered the mean current strength required for the elicitation of predatory attack by hypothalamic stimulation. Microinjection of propranolol (Prop), a beta-blocker, within the same region in similar doses significantly blocked the response as indicated by the increase in current strength required to produce the response. Control injections of normal saline and propylene glycol failed to produce any change. These findings indicate that hypothalamically induced aggressive responses involves beta adrenoceptive mechanisms located in the dPAG.",

    "43": "Administration of the serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor agonist ipsapirone has been shown to decrease cold-elicited thyrotropin (TSH) secretion. We have analyzed (1) the influence of 5-HT1A receptors and ipsapirone metabolism into 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (1-PP, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) on the effect of ipsapirone on TSH release, and (2) the interaction between the corticosterone-releasing effect of ipsapirone and its inhibitory influence on TSH release. Pretreatment with proadifen (50 mg/kg, 5 h before ipsapirone), i.e. an inhibitor of ipsapirone metabolism into 1-PP, did not affect ipsapirone-induced inhibition of cold-elicited TSH secretion. Pretreatment (15 min before ipsapirone) with the 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist metergoline 2 mg/kg) or with the 5-HT1A receptor blocker (-)-pindolol (5 mg/kg) increased baseline and cold-elicited TSH release but the inhibitory influence of ipsapirone on cold-elicited TSH release was alleviated by (-)-pindolol pretreatment only. Cold exposure increased corticosterone release, an effect which was insensitive to (-)-pindolol pretreatment. Lastly, pretreatment with the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine prevented the immediate inhibitory effect of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) upon cold-induced TSH release, but it amplified the late release of TSH in cold-exposed 8-OH-DPAT-injected rats. These results suggest that presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors mediate ipsapirone-induced inhibition of cold-elicited TSH release, an effect which may be partially opposed by postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor stimulation.", 
    "44": "beta-N-Oxalyl-L-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid (beta-L-ODAP) is thought to be the causative agent in lathyrism due to its neuroexcitatory and neurotoxic properties. We have recently reported that beta-L-ODAP is also gliotoxic at high concentrations (Bridges et al.: Brain Res 561:262, 1991). Evidence is now presented that low, subgliotoxic concentrations of beta-L-ODAP may alter the ability of astrocytes to regulate glutamate concentrations in the CNS by increasing astrocyte glutamine synthetase activity. When astrocytes cultured from rat cortex were exposed to 100 microM beta-L-ODAP for 24 h, the resulting glutamine synthetase activity was 155% of control levels. This effect was enantiomer- and isomer-specific, dose-dependent, and required protein translation as the induction was blocked with cycloheximide. The effect of beta-L-ODAP on glutamine synthetase was not mimicked by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) or kainate, suggesting that the induction was not transduced solely through activation of cell surface non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors. An intracellular site of action of beta-L-ODAP is proposed because its effect on glutamine synthetase activity could be blocked by the amino acid uptake blocker dihydrokainate.", 
    "45": "The effect of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists and interleukin-4 (IL-4) on the CD23 expression on, and release from, the human promonocytic cell line, U 937, was investigated. As assessed by flow cytometry, incubation of U 937 cells in the presence of salbutamol, fenoterol or IL-4 induced a concentration- and time-dependent increase in CD23 expression, that was maximal after 48 hr and followed by a decrease thereafter. In addition, salbutamol potentiated the effect of IL-4, the optimal concentration of the drug being a function of the concentration of this cytokine. This synergy between IL-4 and beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists was also observed for the release of the soluble form of CD23. The effect on CD23 expression of salbutamol and fenoterol, but not of IL-4, was blocked in the presence of D,L-propranolol (1 microM) or butoxamine (1 microM). The alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, norepinephrine (1 microM), was ineffective in inducing CD23 expression or potentiating the one evoked by IL-4. Salbutamol down-regulated the expression of Fc gamma RI (CD64) and Fc gamma RII (CD32) whereas IL-4 was ineffective. Only when added together at the onset of the culture did salbutamol and IL-4 induce, after 48 hr, the expression of the monocyte marker, CD14. The expression of CD18 was up-regulated in response to salbutamol either alone or in combination with IL-4, this cytokine alone being inefficient. These data suggest that IL-4 and beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists induce differentiation of U 937 cells into monocyte-like cells.", 
    "46": "Haemodynamically, the combination of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is a logical one. alpha 1-Adrenoceptor blockade causes vasodilatation and hence counteracts elevated peripheral vascular resistance, the most consistent haemodynamic derangement in established essential hypertension. beta-Blockers, which lower elevated blood pressure by a different (not yet clearly understood) mechanism, suppress the reflex tachycardia triggered by vasodilatation. Combined alpha/beta-adrenoceptor blockade can be obtained by the simultaneous administration of both types of adrenoceptor antagonists, but also by giving drugs that possess alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity in the same molecule. Carvedilol and labetalol are the best known examples of such combined alpha/beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, although their pharmacodynamic profile is a result of different receptor selectivity of their component stereoisomers, rather than combined alpha/beta-blocking activity in a single chemical entity. Both compounds have been investigated clinically in the treatment of essential hypertension in moderate-to-large scale trials. A few newer combined alpha/beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as amosulalol, arotinolol and medroxalol have been developed, but clinical data on these compounds are relatively scarce.", 
    "47": "Protein kinase C (PKC) and its potential role in myelin gene expression were investigated in primary cultured rat oligodendrocytes. The major myelin genes were expressed in a developmentally coordinated manner in cultured oligodendrocytes. PKC activity in these cells was similarly regulated with differential expression of PKC isozyme mRNAs. PKC-gamma mRNA was expressed transiently and was most abundant in 9-day cells in vitro. PKC-alpha and PKC-beta mRNAs were present at low levels throughout development in these cells, and their expression increased in 18-25 day cells. Immunocytochemical colocalization of PKC with oligodendrocyte-specific markers--O4, galactosyl cerebroside, MBP, and PLP--in enriched oligodendrocyte cultures suggested that the PKC enzyme activities assayed in these cultures were predominantly contributed by oligodendrocytes. PKC inhibition resulting from long-term exposure to 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (4 beta-PDB) reduced steady-state levels of MBP, PLP, MAG, CNP, and PKC-alpha mRNAs, as detected by slot blots or in situ hybridization, and downregulated the oligodendrocyte-specific markers O4, galactosyl cerebroside, and the major constituent proteins MBP and PLP, as detected by immunocytochemistry. PKC-mediated downmodulation of myelin gene expression was most profound in normally differentiating oligodendrocytes at or before the onset of myelin protein synthesis. Six-day oligodendrocytes were most susceptible to such modulation. To elucidate the mechanism of reduction in various myelin gene messages upon modulation of PKC, we analyzed mRNA levels in oligodendrocytes, which were pretreated with either the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D or the protein synthesis blocker cycloheximide before exposure to 4 beta-PDB. Our results demonstrate that the PKC inhibition-mediated loss in myelin mRNA levels did not require the transcription of any genes, but appeared to be at least partially dependent on continuous protein synthesis.",

We examined the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor binding properties, cellular electrophysiology, and antiarrhythmic efficacy of CK-3579 and the two enantiomers CK-4000 (S) and CK-4001 (R). Both CK-3579 and CK-4000 were equipotent in displacing [3H]dihydroalprenolol from cardiac membranes (IC50 = 2.4 +/- 0.3 and 1.7 +/- 0.4 microM, respectively) and were approximately 23-59 times more selective for the heart receptor than the lung receptor. The IC50 for CK-4001 at the beta 1-adrenoceptor was 38.1 +/- 8 microM and > 100 microM at the beta 2-adrenoceptor. In isolated canine Purkinje fibers and ventricular muscle preparations, all three compounds increased action potential duration at 95% repolarization (APD95) with equal potency, having an average EC20 of approximately 1 microM in Purkinje fiber and 2 microM in ventricular muscle. No significant effects were observed on any other action potential (AP) parameters. In Purkinje fibers with APs shortened by isoproterenol, the class III activity of CK-4000 was significantly greater than that of CK-4001. CK-4000 inhibits the potassium delayed rectifier current Ik in a concentration-dependent manner in isolated feline ventricular myocytes. The IC50 for inhibition of fully activated current was 0.4 +/- 0.2 microM. Steady-state currents negative to -20 mV were unchanged by CK-4000, but the \"hump\" in the outward current between -20 and +30 mV was flattened.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "Programmed electrical stimulation (PES) was used to compare the effects of flecainide and D-sotalol in a canine occlusion-reperfusion infarction model. The increase in the effective refractory period (ERP) was greater with D-sotalol than with flecainide (26.4 +/- 5.2 vs. 10.3 +/- 2.7 ms). In contrast, ventricular activation time was significantly increased by flecainide (from 72 +/- 2 to 87 +/- 3 ms) but was unchanged after D-sotalol administration (from 73 +/- 2 to 75 +/- 2 ms). Thirteen dogs with inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias at control became noninducible after drug administration. All but one of these favorable drug responses were associated with D-sotalol. In contrast, 10 noninducible dogs at control had sustained ventricular arrhythmias induced after drug administration. All of these adverse responses were associated with flecainide (p < 0.0001). An increase in the ratio of conduction to refractoriness was observed in 100% of adverse drug trials but in only 25% of favorable drug trials (p = 0.003). These data suggest that flecainide enhances induction of sustained ventricular arrhythmias in this postinfarction canine model. This proarrhythmic drug effect may be related to the selective effect of flecainide on myocardial conduction.", 
    "50": "The combination of quinidine and sotalol is very effective in prevention of recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (SVT). The cellular mechanisms underlying this efficacy were examined in guinea pig papillary muscle, using standard microelectrode techniques and stimulation frequencies of 1, 2, and 3 Hz. Action potential duration (APD) and effective refractory period (ERP) were measured under control conditions, after 30-min perfusion with quinidine (5 microM) or sotalol (6 microM), and after an additional 30 min of quinidine + sotalol (5 and 6 microM, respectively). Quinidine, sotalol, and quinidine + sotalol all prolonged APD at 90% repolarization (APD90) by 9 +/- 1, 13 +/- 1, and 15 +/- 2%, respectively (at 3 Hz; p = NS, comparison of the three drugs; p < 0.05 for each drug as compared with control). Quinidine + sotalol prolonged ERP (at 3 Hz) by 27 +/- 2% as compared with 11 +/- 2% after sotalol and 18 +/- 2% after quinidine alone (p < 0.05). As a result, the ERP/APD ratio was increased by the combination to 0.87 +/- 0.2 (p < 0.05) as compared with 0.78 +/- 0.2 for control 0.79 +/- 0.1 for sotalol, and 82 +/- 0.1 for quinidine (at 3 Hz). Although sotalol alone decreased the maximum rate of depolarization of phase 0 of the AP (Vmax) by only 3 +/- 2% (p = NS), sotalol attenuated Vmax decrease of quinidine (at 3 Hz) from 40 +/- 4 to 16 +/- 3% (p < 0.05). Effects at 1 and 2 Hz were similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "The individual and combined effects of bunazosin, a selective alpha 1-adrenergic blocking agent, and propranolol on ventricular refractoriness and its dispersion were assessed in 33 chloralose-anesthetized, sympathectomized, and vagotomized dogs 2-3 h after occlusion of the obtuse marginal branches of the circumflex artery. The refractory period was measured in eight sites of the ischemic zone, two sites of the border zone, and two sites of the normal zone with S1-S2 extrastimulus methods. In group 1 dogs (n = 9), coronary artery ligation significantly shortened refractoriness in the ischemic zone (p = 0.023-0.001 in each site). Intravenous (i.v.) administration of a low dose of bunazosin at 0.1 mg/kg significantly blunted the shortening of refractoriness in the ischemic zone (p = 0.026-0.002 in each site), although the values did not reach those observed in the nonischemic zones (both the border and normal zones), where refractoriness remained unchanged. In group 2 dogs (n = 11), a higher dose of i.v. bunazosin, 0.5 mg/kg, significantly blunted the shortening of the refractory period within the ischemic zone (from 149 +/- 14 to 175 +/- 8 ms; mean +/- SD, p < 0.001) and reached the levels of the nonischemic zones (border zone 175 +/- 15 ms, normal zone 170 +/- 14 ms), resulting in a dispersion reduction in refractoriness between the ischemic and nonischemic zones. This dispersion tended to increase again with i.v. administration of 0.2 mg/kg propranolol (ischemic vs. border zone p = 0.034; ischemic vs. normal zone p = 0.089).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "One aim of our study was to characterize in intact rats the pharmacologic effects of carvedilol. After 3 days of continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion of carvedilol (0.5 mg/kg/h), the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of i.v. bolus injections of isoproterenol (0.1, 0.3, and 1 microgram/kg) and phenylephrine (3, 10, and 30 micrograms/kg), respectively, were measured and compared with those obtained in rats that received a continuous i.v. infusion of 0.9% NaCl, prazosin (0.1 mg/kg/h), and propranolol (0.5 mg/kg/h). The chronotropic response to isoproterenol was less blunted in carvedilol-treated animals than in propranolol-treated animals. The pressure response to phenylephrine was attenuated only moderately. Thus, carvedilol had beta-receptor blocking actions on intact rat heart that were similar to but not as pronounced as those of propranolol. Because it reduced diastolic aortic pressure (DAP) and left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), it also had a moderate vasodilating effect. Carvedilol (continuous i.v. infusion of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg/h) antagonized the effects of norepinephrine (NE, i.v. infusion of 0.2 mg/kg/h for 3 days) on heart function and heart weight in a dose-dependent manner. It also attenuated markedly the norepinephrine (NE)-induced increase in the activity of cardiac glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), although a 37% stimulation persisted.",

    "54": "Effects of ultrasound were evaluated in the ejecting LV of anesthetized, open-chest dogs under different conditions of LV volume and contractile state and after mild selective alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation. LV pressures, left atrial pressures, and regional segment lengths were measured in anterior and posterior midwall. A cylindrical ultrasound probe (0.9 MHz, 25 W) mounted on a catheter was inserted into the LV cavity through the apex and was activated for 4 minutes in each condition. In protocol A (n = 7), LV volume was altered with caval vein occlusion and intravenous dextran infusion. The ultrasound probe was activated at low (4.1 +/- 0.9 mm Hg), mid (10.6 +/- 1.5 mm Hg), and high (17.9 +/- 1.8 mm Hg) LV end-diastolic pressure (EDP). Effects of ultrasound were less pronounced at higher EDP. For example, the time interval from end-diastole to peak (-)dP/dt decreased by 7.5 +/- 2.3% at low, 4.4 +/- 2.2% at mid, and 1.9 +/- 1.6% at high LVEDP (p < 0.001). In protocol B (n = 7), LV inotropic state was altered by slow intravenous infusion of low-dose calcium. The ultrasound probe was activated before and after calcium. Effects of ultrasound were less pronounced after calcium. Time from end-diastole to peak (-)dP/dt decreased by 8.4 +/- 3.1% at baseline and by 3.5 +/- 2.1% after calcium (p < 0.001). In protocol C (n = 7), activation of the ultrasound probe was performed at baseline and after mild selective alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation (propranolol plus phenylephrine). Effects of ultrasound were similar at baseline and after propranolol but increased after phenylephrine. Time from end-diastole to peak (-)dP/dt decreased by 5.2 +/- 2.4% at baseline, by 5.3 +/- 1.9% after propranolol, and by 8.9 +/- 3.2% after phenylephrine (p < 0.05).",

    "56": "We have investigated the early steps of myelin basic protein (MBP) degradation in a membrane mimetic system (reverse micelles), resembling the interlamellar aqueous spaces where the protein is located in the myelin sheath. MBP, unfolded in buffer, refolds on incorporation into the micelles, resulting in reduced accessibility to three proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, cathepsin D, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, in comparison with aqueous solution. Eleven cleavage sites seen in buffer are removed from proteolytic attack in micellar solution. These sites delineate a protected protein domain displaying a potential beta-sheet structure capable of interacting with the myelin membrane. An additional site not seen in buffer is attacked in the micelles. Experiments with a structure inducer, 15% 1-propanol in buffer, reveal that the refolding pattern of MBP in reverse micelles is specific to the membrane biomimetic system and is not produced by organic solvent per se. Micellar digestions of MBP generate long peptides, two of which, isolated after tryptic digestion, have been found to be immunodominant in multiple sclerosis patients. The findings suggest the structure induced in MBP by the micelles resembles that leading to production of the self-peptides recognized by T cells during proteolytic breakdown of MBP in autoimmune demyelinating diseases.", 
    "57": "This study compares the membrane activity of ibutilide, d-sotalol, sematilide, E-4031 and dofetilide on single ventricular cells under identical experimental conditions. We found that ibutilide and dofetilide produced a 'bell-shaped' concentration-dependent effect on action potential duration. Ionic current measurement showed that ibutilide, at 10(-8) M, increased a late inward current; the other compounds had either no effect or decreased it. Moreover, only ibutilide, at a high concentration of 10(-5) M, increased an outward current, as oppose to a uniform depression of IK by d-sotalol, sematilide, E-4031 and dofetilide, and the depression of IK by the latter compounds could be reversed by 10(-5) M ibutilide. Finally, low concentration of ibutilide could further prolong the action potential duration that had already been prolonged by a K+ channel blocker, but a high concentration of ibutilide did just the opposite by reversing the prolongation caused by K+ channel blockers. Therefore, action potentials agree well with the ionic current results. Possible mechanistic advantage of ibutilide over K+ channel blockers was discussed.", 
    "58": "In a test of working memory using a three-panel runway task, the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), at 1.0 mg/kg i.p. significantly increased the number of errors (attempts to pass through two incorrect panels of the three panel gates at four choice points), but it had no effect on errors in a test of reference memory. Intrahippocampal injection of 8-OH-DPAT at 10 micrograms/side also significantly increased the number of working memory errors, without affecting that of reference memory errors. The effect of intrahippocampal 8-OH-DPAT (10 micrograms/side) on working memory was blocked by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, (-)-propranolol, at 5 mg/kg i.p. These results suggest that activation of hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors impairs working memory, but does not affect retention of reference memory.", 
    "59": "The effects of local application of serotonin (5-HT) on extracellular levels of dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (N. ACC) were assessed using in vivo microdialysis. At a perfusate flow rate of 0.3 microliter/min the baseline dialysate concentration of DA was 2.1 +/- 0.7 nM (mean +/- S.E.M.; n = 5) and significantly increased to 142 +/- 18%, 220 +/- 47% and 332 +/- 35% of baseline when 0.1 microM, 0.2 microM and 0.4 microM concentrations of 5-HT were included in the perfusate. Perfusate 5-HT concentrations below 0.1 microM had no effect on dialysate DA. The in vivo dialysis efficiency for 5-HT was found to be 39 +/- 12%, and thus the concentrations of 5-HT reaching the extracellular space at the surface of the dialysis membrane were estimated to be 40, 80 and 160 nM for the 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 microM 5-HT perfusates, respectively.

Thus a beta 1-selective beta blocker with about 45% intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), such as xamoterol, was thought to have a desirable pharmacologic profile. Long-term studies of xamoterol in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy have shown improved cardiac performance and exercise tolerance, while exercise heart rate, left ventricular ejection fraction, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure were decreased. This improvement in exercise capacity and overall quality of life in patients treated with xamoterol has been confirmed in further controlled trials of patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure (NYHA class I and II). However, in patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure (NYHA class III and IV), mortality was unfavorably influenced by xamoterol. The therapeutic role of xamoterol in patients with heart disease needs further refinement.", 
    "61": "Bucindolol hydrochloride is a phenoxypropanolamine with potent nonselective beta antagonist and mild vasodilatory properties. In humans with congestive heart failure, it is extremely well tolerated and produces improvements in left ventricular systolic (ejection fraction, systolic elastance, cardiac index, and stroke work) and diastolic (isovolumic relaxation) performance while reducing pulmonary artery pressures and heart rate. These improvements occur without an increase in myocardial oxygen extraction or oxygen consumption. In addition, functional class improves with this agent although exercise tolerance and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) does not change, an effect that is not unexpected with a beta-adrenergic antagonist. Bucindolol produces a decrease in plasma renin activity and plasma norepinephrine, effects that may be beneficial for the long-term treatment of congestive heart failure. However, these effects are most marked in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy compared with patients with ischemic heart disease. This agent holds great promise for the treatment of heart failure patients.", 
    "62": "In response to early reports indicating a beneficial adrenoceptor effect of beta blockade, 2 small trials were conducted to investigate the hemodynamic effects of acute and chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy. Acute beta-blocker therapy with intravenous acebutolol, 25 mg, resulted in a significant decline in cardiac performance, whereas chronic therapy with acebutolol, 200 mg twice daily, resulted in no beneficial effects on exercise tolerance, as reported by the original Swedish investigators. Further, beta-adrenoceptor blockade has been associated with a number of clinical problems: beta blockers tend to interfere with the compensatory mechanisms that support circulation during early or mild heart failure and therefore have little value as routine therapy at that stage of the disorder. Although excessive beta-adrenoceptor blockade may worsen ventricular function by decreasing myocardial contractility, beta blockers appear to have a useful role in patients with moderate heart failure accompanied by tachycardia. Carefully titrated doses of beta blockers in conjunction with afterload-reducing agents may also provide a benefit in patients with rapid heart rates and grossly elevated levels of circulating catecholamines.", 
    "63": "Early studies of acute beta-blocking drug therapy, such as metoprolol and acebutolol, in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) and survivors of acute myocardial infarction were interpreted to have detrimental or, at best, neutral effects on cardiac and clinical hemodynamics. Subsequent trials of longer duration with metoprolol versus placebo in patients with IDC demonstrated an \"exceptional response\" to beta-blocker therapy in some individuals. Hemodynamics and patient demographic characteristics appear not to predict those patients who may or may not benefit. Controlled trials with newer beta-adrenoceptor modulating drugs--such as xamoterol, bucindolol, and carvedilol--have been equivocal in some situations. Xamoterol has been associated with progressive heart failure and increased sudden cardiac deaths, whereas bucindolol improved clinical heart failure symptoms and testing hemodynamic parameters, as did treatment with carvedilol, in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The success of these agents in patients with congestive heart failure may be in their ability to modulate the excessive myocardial stimulation of the beta-adrenergic nervous system while benefitting the dynamics of the peripheral system.",

Several of the larger trials did include high-risk patients with a history of compensated heart failure or with symptoms and signs suggesting mild LVD. Data from these trials indicate that beta-blocker treatment was well tolerated by patients with LVD, both in the acute phase of myocardial infarction and during long-term follow-up treatment. Further, data for LVD patients indicate that mortality in the beta-blocker group was reduced by 20-30% when compared with the placebo group. A similar mortality reduction was obtained for the entire patient population in the trials. Because of the high mortality among patients with mild LVD, the absolute gain in numbers of lives saved per 100 patients treated with beta blockers is even larger than that in patients without LVD. Data from two long-term trials indicate marked (47% and 43%) reductions in the likelihood of sudden death among LVD patients treated with beta blockers. These results suggest that all patients with LVD who can tolerate beta blockade may benefit from treatment with these agents.", 
    "65": "In early 1973, Waagstein administered bolus intravenous injections of practolol and, subsequently, alprenolol, 50 mg twice daily, to reduce the heart rate of a 59-year-old woman with refractory, idiopathic dilated congestive cardiomyopathy (DCCM) and resting tachycardia. The patient's condition improved dramatically and continued to improve during subsequent oral therapy. This experience, combined with increasing interest in the role of beta blockade in myocardial protection, led to investigation of oral practolol, 50-400 mg twice daily, for 2-12 months in 6 additional patients with advanced DCCM. These findings, published in 1975, indicated improved ventricular function for all participants. In a 1980 open-label follow-up study, 28 patients with DCCM received alprenolol, metoprolol, practolol, or propranolol. Treatment was associated with improvements in myocardial function as well as in related symptomatology. These effects were reversed following drug withdrawal. The findings suggested that beta blockers possessed potential value in treatment of idiopathic DCCM.", 
    "66": "Alterations in the myocardial receptor-G protein-adenylate cyclase (RGC) complex and cardiac adrenergic neurons in the failing human heart result in subsensitivity to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Pharmacologic interventions such as beta blockade may modify critical components of the RGC complex and partially restore the sensitivity of the beta-adrenergic pathway. Among the receptors coupled to the stimulatory (Gs) protein are the beta 1 and beta 2 receptors. Because of differences in receptor population and agonist (i.e., norepinephrine) affinity, the beta 1-receptor is the predominate adrenergic subtype regulating contractility in the nonfailing myocardium. Down-regulation occurs in the myocardial beta-receptor component of the RGC complex with mild-to-moderate and severe left ventricular dysfunction. However, abnormalities of the RGC complex vary with the etiology of heart failure; beta 1-receptor down-regulation is greater in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy than in post-infarction cardiomyopathy, while beta-receptor uncoupling is greater in post-infarction disease. In chronic heart failure, the adrenergic nervous system is activated in the heart and kidney. There is evidence that an increased cardiac norepinephrine concentration contributes to the decrease in beta 1-receptor density in heart failure. However, norepinephrine exposure is not the only factor responsible for regulating beta-adrenergic receptors in heart failure. Chronic beta blockade may improve hemodynamic and clinical response in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy by protecting the myocardium from the cardiotoxic effects of increased catecholamines and by up-regulating the beta 1 receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "An understanding of the important role of neurohormonal compensatory mechanisms in heart failure has been translated into therapeutic options that can improve cardiac function, alter disease progression, and improve survival. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are of proven benefit in this regard, and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists are potentially another such class of agents. By inhibiting the myocardial effects of chronic adrenergic activation, beta blocking agents may improve left ventricular function or delay its deterioration in patients with heart failure. Aside from blocking beta-adrenergic receptors, other ancillary properties inherent in third-generation beta-blocking agents (such as vasodilation) may exert additional favorable effects. Clinical data generated in subjects with heart failure indicate that beta-antagonist therapy exerts its physiologic and clinical effects through neurohormonal antagonism, generally analogous to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Virtually all controlled long-term studies show that beta-blocking agents improve cardiac function and hemodynamics in patients with chronic heart failure, but large-scale trials are needed to ascertain a favorable effect on the natural history of heart failure.", 
    "68": "The venom of the scorpion Androctonus mauretanicus mauretanicus contains a toxin, P05, which is structurally and functionally similar to scorpion leiurotoxin I (87% sequence identity), a blocker of the apamin-sensitive Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels. It is a 31-residue polypeptide cross-linked by three disulfide bridges. A C-terminal carboxyl-amidated analog of P05 (sP05-NH2) was chemically synthesized by the solid-phase technique and fully characterized. Toxicity assays in vivo established that sP05-NH2, like native P05, is a potent and lethal neurotoxic agent in mice (LD50 of 20 ng per mouse). Pharmacological assays in vitro however showed that, unlike P05 which has a binding affinity of 2 x 10(-11) M, sP05-NH2 apparently binds irreversibly to the apamin receptor. Iodination at the C-terminal His gave diiodo-sP05-NH2, which had a binding affinity similar to that of native P05. The disulfide bridge pairings were chemically determined for sP05-NH2 and thereby deduced for P05 and leiurotoxin I: linkages were between Cys3 and Cys21, Cys8 and Cys26, and Cys12 and Cys28. Molecular dynamics refinement of P05 also using data from leiurotoxin I suggests that P05 is mainly composed of a double-stranded, antiparallel beta-sheet (from Leu18 to Val29) linked to an alpha-helix (from Arg6 to Gly16) by two disulfides (Cys8-Cys26 and Cys12-Cys28) and to an extended fragment (from Thr1 to Leu5) by the third disulfide (Cys3-Cys21). In agreement with the model, circular dichroism analysis of sP05-NH2 showed that the toxin structure is highly rigid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

If the result of either test was abnormal, angiography was undertaken, followed immediately by angioplasty (if a stenosis was found) or by renal vein renin determinations. Patients whose blood pressures were lower 6 to 12 weeks after a revascularization procedure (surgery or angioplasty) were diagnosed as having renovascular hypertension.",

Of 53 patients who had surgery (n = 21) or angioplasty (n = 32), 51 had lowered blood pressures compared with before the procedure. Sensitivity and specificity of the tests were as follows: renal scintigram with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor: 92% and 91% (all patients) and 92% and 80% (only patients with angiograms); captopril challenge test: 76% and 82% (all patients) and 76% and 58% (only patients with angiograms).

    "73": "The effect of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) on thyroxine type II 5'-deiodinase (5'-D) and N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activities were studied using pineal cells of euthyroid and hypothyroid rats. VIP activated 5'-D activity in a dose-dependent manner in both euthyroid and hypothyroid animals. However, basal and VIP stimulated activity was higher in pinealocytes from hypothyroid than in cells from euthyroid rats. VIP was also able to stimulate NAT activity but hypothyroidism did not induce modifications in its activity. Both 5'-D and NAT activities were stimulated not only by VIP, but also by isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, and forskolin, a potent activator of adenylate cyclase activity. The results suggest that VIP may be involved in the physiological regulation of pineal 5'-D activity.", 
    "74": "Nipradilol is a beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, whose structure contains an NO2 group. Thus, it is possible that it modulates the function of glomerular mesangial cells through the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. To prove this hypothesis, we examined the effect of nipradilol on soluble guanylate cyclase, intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) accumulation, and the mitogenesis of cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells. Nipradilol increased intracellular cGMP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner through the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. Furthermore, nipradilol inhibited the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the mesangial cells stimulated by 2.5% fetal bovine serum in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that nipradilol may modulate mesangial cell function through an increase in intracellular cGMP resulting from the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase.",

Left ventricular circumferential end-systolic wall stress versus rate-corrected velocity of shortening (Vcfc) relations were generated over a range of loads using nitroprusside. Data were acquired before and during esmolol infusion, thereby allowing assessment of hemodynamic responses with the sympathetic nervous system functionally intact as well as ablated. The adequacy of sympathetic blockade was confirmed with isoproterenol challenges. In each case, left ventricular contractile state was measured relative to placebo and esmolol data as delta Vcfc at a common end-systolic wall stress. Increased and decreased contractility were defined as delta Vcfc > 0 and delta Vcfc < 0, respectively.",

The chromatography was performed using a C18 column and a phosphate buffer (pH 3)-acetonitrile (65:35, v/v) mixture. After homogenization of the brain tissue in perchloric acid, the supernatant was buffered at pH 9 and extracted with diethyl ether, followed by back-extraction in sulphuric acid. Recoveries of between 80 and 100% were achieved. The method was found to be accurate (100%) and precise (coefficient of variation around 10%).

    "88": "Central monoaminergic neurotransmitters have been implicated in the control of food intake in different animal species but it remains unclear whether these same neurochemical systems effectively regulate feeding behaviour in the genetically obese (ob/ob) mouse. Neuropharmacological studies have demonstrated, for example, that microinjection of norepinephrine can elicit a reliable feeding response in the rat, particularly at dark onset. The present study was therefore designed to examine the impact of central injection of norepinephrine (20-160 nmol) and clonidine (5-80 nmol), an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, on food intake in ob/ob mice and lean (+/?) controls. Presatiated obese and lean mice were injected with norepinephrine or clonidine immediately prior to the onset of the dark cycle. Food intake (kcal) was measured 1 h postinjection. Obese mice ingested more food than lean mice under baseline saline conditions. Injection of norepinephrine and clonidine increased eating in both phenotypes, although the ob/ob showed an enhanced feeding response to norepinephrine and clonidine administration. Intracerebroventricular pretreatment with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (12.5-50 nmol) significantly attenuated the increase in food intake observed in response to central injection of norepinephrine (40 nmol) and clonidine (10 nmol). However, the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist corynanthine (15-60 nmol) or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (25-100 nmol) failed to alter noradrenergic feeding. These results suggest that modification of central alpha 2-noradrenergic function can alter natural feeding in mice, and that the ob/ob is particularly sensitive to this effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "89": "To determine whether there is an age-related difference in circadian blood pressure changes after administration of a beta-adrenergic blocker, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure was measured before and after administration of long-acting carteolol, a beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, in 9 younger and 13 older hypertensive patients. Ambulatory blood pressure was measured noninvasively using an ambulatory blood pressure monitor every 30 minutes for 24 hours before and 8 weeks after a once-daily administration of 15 mg of carteolol. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the office significantly decreased in both groups after 8 weeks of carteolol treatment. The whole-day systolic and diastolic blood pressures also fell significantly after carteolol treatment in both groups. Carteolol reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures during the day in both groups. However, no reduction was observed in nighttime systolic blood pressure in either group, although nighttime diastolic blood pressure tended to decrease in the younger group (P = 0.051). The pulse rate during the night significantly increased in both groups, although no change was observed during the day in either group. We conclude that the antihypertensive effect of carteolol on the circadian blood pressure pattern in younger and older hypertensive patients is comparable. Carteolol reduced only daytime blood pressure while hardly affecting the nighttime blood pressure in both groups.", 
    "90": "Numerous theories have been proposed to explain the origin of central serous choroidopathy (CSC). However, it has been shown recently that there is a close relationship between CSC and type A-behaviour pattern (TABP) which is characterized by high adrenergic activity in the body. It is interesting to note that one of our patients who had chronic central serous choroidopathy, and metoprolol treatment for hypertension during one year, developed a recurrence of CSC three weeks after cessation of metoprolol treatment. This was one of the reasons to start this treatment modality for CSC. In this study, we present 6 cases of CSC in which the diagnosis was established by ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography. In these patients, we proposed to analyse the relationship between CSC and a high adrenergic activity by the use of a selective beta-blocker (metoprolol; 50 mg tablets, twice daily). In two of the six cases, laser photocoagulation was also performed prior to commencement of the metoprolol treatment. Visual acuity improved in two patients, stayed at 1.0 in three patients and stabilized on the pretreatment level (0.8) in one patient (case-5). However, the symptoms (metamorphopsia and micropsia) and the signs (serous retinal detachment and angiographic hyperfluorescence) decreased or disappeared in all patients after treatment. Also visual complaints in all patients improved subjectively. No recurrences were noted during the metoprolol treatment in any of the patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In both in vitro and in vivo preparations, it exhibited significant positive inotropic activity with concomitant increase in heart rate and decrease in mean blood pressure. Though its potency is lower than that of forskolin, its duration of action is more prolonged. In conscious dog experiments, HL 706, administered orally, also showed a dose related increase in LV dP/dtmax. A significant reversal of cardiac failure was attained in anaesthetised dogs subjected to propranolol induced cardiac insufficiency. HL 706, like forskolin increased cAMP by virtue of its adenylate cyclase stimulant activity. Through increase in cAMP it also exhibited non-specific smooth muscle relaxant activity in isolated vascular and ileal preparations. Its therapeutic ratio is quite favourable.", 
    "97": "Besides the important role of emotional factors in the production of psychological-stress-induced analgesia (PSY-SIA), recent attention to the participation of serotonergic (5-HTnergic) neurons in the fear- and anxiety-evoking mechanism led us to examine the effects of 5-HTnergic ligands on PSY-SIA. Pretreatment of mice with 2.0 to 10 mg/kg of methysergide, a 5-HT receptor antagonist, or 1.0 to 10 mg/kg of buspirone, a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, dose-dependently suppressed the production of PSY-SIA. Ritanserin, a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, 1.0 to 5.0 mg/kg, or Y-25,130, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg, also inhibited PSY-SIA dose-dependently, while (+/-)pindolol, a 5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist, was ineffective at doses up to 3.0 mg/kg. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of PSY-stress on the development of antinociceptive tolerance to morphine was also antagonized by methysergide, buspirone, ritanserin and Y-25,130, but not by (+/-)pindolol.

    "98": "We investigated whether a potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin, stimulated the proliferation of human thyroid epithelial cells (thyrocytes). [3H]-thymidine incorporation into normal thyrocytes and thyrocytes from patients with Graves' disease was significantly increased at 10(-9) mol/l endothelin, reaching a plateau at 10(-8) mol/l. The proliferative responses of the thyrocytes obtained from patients with Graves' disease were similar to those of normal thyrocytes. Furthermore, the cell number of thyrocytes stimulated by endothelin was increased as compared with that of unstimulated thyrocytes. Neither indomethacin nor heparin affected this endothelin-stimulated thyrocyte proliferation. When thyrocytes were cultured with both endothelin and recombinant interleukin 1 beta, there was an additive effect on thyrocyte proliferation. The Ca2+ entry blocker, verapamil, inhibited both the proliferative responses of thyrocytes to endothelin and the additive effect of endothelin and recombinant interleukin 1 beta on thyrocyte proliferation. These results suggest that endothelin functions as a growth-promoting factor for human thyrocytes, presumably through intracellular calcium influx.", 
    "99": "Several imperatives drive the need to establish the merit of treating isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly. These include its higher prevalence with age, the associated excess cardiovascular risks, and the rapid aging of the population. The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program demonstrated a significant reduction in stroke incidence (fatal and nonfatal) (36%, equivalent to preventing 30 strokes per 1,000 participants per 5 years). A 27% reduction in coronary heart disease incidence and a 32% reduction in all major cardiovascular events were also achieved (equivalent to the prevention of 16 and 55 events per 1,000 participants per 5 years, respectively). These results were associated with a treatment regimen in which the primary agent was low-dose chlorthalidone. The benefits accrued to all subgroups identified based on baseline age, race and sex, blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, and electrocardiographic abnormalities. The reduction in coronary disease is consistent with predictions based on prospective epidemiological studies and is concordant with other recent intervention trials. It is a reasonable inference from the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program findings that middle-aged as well as older people with isolated systolic hypertension, and people with less severe degrees of this condition, particularly when other risk factors are present, would benefit from such therapy. Another reasonable implication of the trial relates to the matter of preferred drug treatment regimens for diastolic hypertension, in middle-aged as well as older people.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "100": "Pancreatic islets prelabelled with either 86Rb or 45Ca were perifused in the presence of propranolol (0.1 microM) and, when required, exposed to epinephrine (0.1 microM). In the absence of D-glucose, epinephrine failed to cause any obvious change in either 86Rb or 45Ca outflow. In the presence of 16.7 mM D-glucose, however, epinephrine lowered both 86Rb and 45Ca outflow, this coinciding with suppression of insulin release. Epinephrine also suppressed the increment in 86Rb outflow evoked by a rise in glucose-concentration from 8.3 to 16.7 mM. Epinephrine did not abolish the early fall in 45Ca efflux evoked by the administration of D-glucose (16.7 mM) to islets previously deprived of the hexose but, within the same experiments, impaired the secondary rise in effluent radioactivity. Likewise, epinephrine prevented the increase in 45Ca outflow provoked by a rise in hexose concentration from 8.3 to 16.7 mM. These findings are compatible with the recent proposal that epinephrine interferes with the entry of Ca2+ into the B-cell, as mediated by voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, but do not rule out a multifactorial coupling between the occupancy of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and the eventual inhibition of insulin release.",

The neat plasma sample was directly injected onto the size-exclusion column, and the deproteinized fraction of AT enantiomers was concentrated on the ODS silica column. The enantiomers were then transferred and separated mutually on the ph-beta-CD silica column. The calibration line for each of the AT enantiomers was linear in the range of plasma concentration of 10-200 ng/ml (r > 0.9997) with good reproducibility (CV < 9.7%, n = 20).

    "102": "4-Phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (4-PTIQ) has previously been shown to have antagonistic properties to methamphetamine in the spinal cord. Administration of 4-PTIQ (5 mg/kg, s.c.) reduced the ambulation induced by methamphetamine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) in rats. Methamphetamine (3 micrograms), injected unilaterally into the nucleus accumbens, increased ambulation. Alone, 4-PTIQ (10 micrograms) failed to elicit ambulation; however, it inhibited the methamphetamine-induced increase in ambulation. The alpha 1-antagonist prazosin (0.5 micrograms) or the beta-antagonist propranolol (3 micrograms) showed no effect on ambulation induced by methamphetamine. Haloperidol (5 ng), which possesses strong dopamine-blocking activity, abolished the ambulation induced by methamphetamine. The drug 4-PTIQ had weak affinity for dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. These results support the possibility that the inhibitory effects of 4-PTIQ on the ambulation-stimulating effects of methamphetamine, are due to blocking of the dopamine-releasing effect of methamphetamine but not due to dopamine blocking effects.", 
    "103": "The equatorial current of the frog lens was studied with microelectrodes and a vibrating probe. Norepinephrine, isoproterenol and terbutaline applied topically at the surface of the cornea as a 1% solution increased the equatorial current of the lens about 80%. This increase was blocked by timolol. Topical forskolin increased the equatorial current by over 80%. This effect of forskolin was not blocked by timolol. These substances did not affect the equatorial current of the lens when the lens was suspended in a frog Ringers solution. 8-Bromo cyclic AMP increased the equatorial current when it was applied topically but not when it was added directly to the medium bathing an isolated lens. The results suggest that beta-adrenergic agonists, applied topically to the cornea, increase the equatorial current of the lens by a mechanism that is mediated by cyclic AMP. The finding that 8-bromo cyclic AMP did not act directly on the lens suggests that a currently unknown substance or process is active at the level of the lens.",

    "106": "The objective of this study was to analyze the long-term hemodynamic effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine in mild hypertension compared with those of the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol, focusing in particular on the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Ten male patients with mild essential hypertension were entered into a double-blind crossover study. Examinations were carried out after 2 weeks of placebo run-in, and after 6 and 12 months of active treatment. Mean resting blood pressure was reduced from 115 +/- 12 mm Hg to 106 +/- 12 mm Hg with atenolol, and to 107 +/- 8 mm Hg with isradipine. The increase in the product of heart rate times blood pressure was significantly greater during isradipine treatment, as was the maximum exercise capacity. Left ventricular mass was increased from 228 +/- 36 g to 305 +/- 68 g with atenolol whereas it remained unchanged with isradipine (254 +/- 55 g). The results indicate that antihypertensive treatment with isradipine as monotherapy may prevent the development of left ventricular hypertrophy whereas treatment with atenolol as monotherapy does not appear to offer this possibility.", 
    "107": "The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of 1.25 to 2.5 mg of isradipine twice daily in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, as seen in general practice. A total of 595 patients were treated for 6 months with an initial dose of isradipine at 1.25 mg twice daily. This dose was doubled if normotension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] < or = 90 mm Hg) was not achieved after 4 weeks of treatment (n = 327). If, after 8 weeks, blood pressure was still not normalized, either the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor spirapril at 3 mg (n = 58) or the beta-blocker pindolol at 5 mg (n = 54) was added to the treatment. After 24 weeks, the mean blood pressure decrease with isradipine at 1.25 mg twice daily was 28.5/19.0 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (SBP)/DBP and, with 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily, 28.4/18.5 mm Hg. There was no relevant change in heart rate. The overall normalization rate for all 595 patients was 78.2%. Side-effects that were considered related or possibly related to treatment were reported in 73 patients (12.3%). Treatment with isradipine plus either spirapril or pindolol was discontinued in 32 patients (5.4%) because of side-effects related, or possibly related, to the study treatment. Blood pressure was also self-recorded in a subgroup of 45 patients. The self-recorded values were 11/6 mm Hg (SBP/DBP) lower than the respective causal readings at the start of active treatment. However, this difference disappeared completely after 8 weeks of treatment.", 
    "108": "In order to increase the ocular absorption of carteolol, this antiglaucomatous drug was incorporated into either nanoparticles (NP) or nanocapsules (NC). The polymer used was poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL). The dosage forms were tested on intraocular hypertensive-induced rabbits. Results are presented as the chronological variations of the intraocular pressure (IOP) in comparison with the commercial aqueous solution (Carteol eye drops). The therapeutic results (decrease in IOP) were much more pronounced with carteolol incorporated into the colloidal carriers than with the commercial eye drops. Further, NC displayed a better effect than NP because the drug was entrapped in the oily core of the carrier, thus more readily available to the eye. The incorporation of the drug into nanocapsules produced a decline in the cardiovascular side effects in comparison with aqueous eye drops, thus showing that the undesired noncorneal absorption was reduced. In conclusion, colloidal suspension made of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) could offer a good opportunity for ophthalmic delivery of drugs.", 
    "109": "Skeletal muscle ventricles (SMVs) were constructed from the latissimus dorsi muscle in seven beagles. Following 3 weeks of vascular delay and 6 weeks of electrical conditioning, the SMVs were connected in series with the thoracic aorta using a valved aortic homograft for the efferent limb. The SMVs were stimulated to contract synchronously during diastole. Effective aortic diastolic counterpulsation was achieved in all dogs, with an average 24.2% +/- 15.3% improvement in diastolic pressure. In two animals surviving beyond 3 months, increase in SMV function was noted over time. Appropriate aortic homograft valve function was documented by echocardiogram. Acute reversible heart failure was induced with propranolol in one dog alive after 126 days. A 61.3% reduction in cardiac output and a 37.6% reduction in mean arterial blood pressure were achieved. During profound low cardiac output, SMV stimulation with 33 Hz and 50 Hz improved cardiac output by 16.9% and 17.8%, improved the tension time index by 14.9% and 16.1%, and improved the endocardial viability ratio by 34.1% and 34.1%, respectively. These results again demonstrate the long-term effectiveness of SMVs as aortic counterpulsators. A valve in the efferent limb of the SMV system functions appropriately over time and may improve the efficiency of the system.", 
    "110": "To evaluate the cellular mechanisms involved in hypoxic relaxation of airway smooth muscle, we investigated the effects of hypoxia on the behavior of third- and fourth-order porcine bronchial rings contracted with either carbachol or KCl. In one series of experiments, hypoxia (95% N2-5% CO2) was imposed and rings were then exposed to increasing concentrations of carbachol or KCl. In separate experiments, rings were first contracted with carbachol (10(-6) M) or KCl (40 mM) and were then exposed to solutions bubbled with decreasing concentrations of O2. The CO2 concentration was maintained constant at 5% in all experiments. The initial magnitude of KCl-induced but not carbachol-induced contractions was profoundly reduced by 95% N2-5% CO2. The sensitivity of the airway to carbachol was unchanged. In rings precontracted with either carbachol or KCl, hypoxia caused similar losses of airway smooth muscle tone in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. The effects of hypoxia were independent of the presence of an intact epithelium and were not inhibited by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (5 microM), the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue (50 microM), or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (1 microM). The impairment by hypoxia of the initiation phase of KCl-induced contractions and of the maintenance phase of both KCl- and carbachol-induced contractions, but not the initiation phase of carbachol-induced contractions, suggests that changes in O2 tension modulate airway tone by altering the entry of extracellular calcium into the airway smooth muscle.", 
    "111": "beta-Adrenergic blockade suppressed lipolysis and normalized the exercise-induced increments in glucose uptake (GlcU) and metabolic clearance rate (MCR) in alloxan-diabetic dogs with residual insulin, but not in insulin-deprived depancreatized dogs even when combined with methylpalmoxirate (MP), which suppresses fatty acid oxidation. The effects of a minimal amount of insulin (as in the alloxan-diabetic dog), were studied in depancreatized, 24-h insulin-deprived dogs during rest and treadmill exercise (6 km/h, 10% slope) using a 1/4 basal insulin infusion (50 microU.kg-1.min-1, insulin, n = 6) alone, or with MP (20 mg.kg-1.day orally, 2.5 days, MP+insulin, n = 6). At rest, insulin decreased circulating fatty acids (31%) and Glc (13%) and increased GlcU and MCR (86 and 72%). Glc production was unaffected. MP plus insulin markedly suppressed hepatic fatty acid oxidation, decreased Glc (44%) and Glc production (50%), and markedly increased MCR (128%). The exercise-induced increments in MCR were markedly improved only by MP plus insulin but were still lower than in the propranolol-treated alloxan-diabetic dogs. Plasma Glc inversely correlated with the exercise-induced increase in MCR (r = -0.86). We conclude that 1) acute infusion of subbasal insulin improved GlcU in depancreatized dogs at rest but not during exercise; 2) inhibition of fatty acid oxidation combined with subbasal insulin improved the exercise-induced increase in MCR; and 3) the difference in GlcU and MCR between the MP plus insulin-treated depancreatized dogs and the beta-blockade-treated alloxan-diabetic dogs suggests a difference between acute and chronic effects of insulin.", 
    "112": "In 36 cats under nembutal anaesthesia, stimulation of the central end of the cut vagus nerve caused blood flow to increase in only the ipsilateral side in six cats (17%) and in the bilateral sides in 30 cats (83%) in the lower lips. Pretreatment with hexamethonium to block nicotinic synapses in autonomic ganglia resulted in a time-dependent reduction of the reflex vasodilator response, while phentolamine, propranolol (alpha-, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists) and tripelennamine (histamine receptor antagonist) had no effect. Pretreatment with atropine (muscarinic receptor antagonist) showed a slight, but not statistically insignificant attenuation of the reflex vasodilatation. Ipsilateral section of either the glossopharyngeal nerve root or the inferior alveolar nerve completely abolished the reflex vasodilator response elicited by central vagal stimulation. The reflex vasodilator response induced by stimulation of the central end of the cut vagus nerve was abolished by topical capsaicin application on the central cut ends of the vagus nerve but not by capsaicin on the inferior alveolar nerve. These results suggest that there is a cutaneous reflex vasodilator system that can be activated via capsaicin-sensitive afferent fibres in the vagus nerve. Parasympathetic vasodilator fibres of this system emerge from the brain stem with the glossopharyngeal nerve and reach the blood vessels in the cat mandibular lip via the inferior alveolar nerve.", 
    "113": "Fifty patients (aged 53 +/- 7 years) with confirmed coronary disease performed two stress tests (baseline and following treatment with vasodilators) and were divided into two groups: (A) fixed ischaemic threshold (n = 27), and (B) variable ischaemic threshold (n = 23). All patients underwent 24-h baseline Holter monitoring and monitoring following treatment with nifedipine, placebo, propranolol and nifedipine + propranolol. In Group A, 92% of ischaemic episodes occurred at heart rates similar to those found during exercise testing. In Group B, the heart rate was lower in 66%. In Group A, positive stress testing before the first 3 min of exercise, or at < 140 beat,min-1 with ST segment depressions > or = 0.02 mV, correlated with higher Holter indexes. In Group A, propranolol reduced both the number of episodes and total ischaemia time. In Group B, the best effects were achieved with nifedipine and combined treatment. Our results further emphasize the contrasts between patients with angina and fixed and variable ischaemic thresholds and suggest that therapy tailored to the physiopathology may be most efficacious.", 
    "114": "In an inositol-depleted 1321 N1 astrocytoma cell line, propranolol at 0.5 mM concentration and carbachol in the presence of Li+ induce a large increase (30-60-fold) in the amount of CMP-phosphatidate, the lipid substrate of PtdIns synthase. The actions of both agents on CMP-phosphatidate accumulation were reversed by co-incubation with 1 mM inositol. In cells grown in the presence of 40 microM inositol the propranolol- and carbachol-mediated CMP-phosphatidate accumulation was much smaller (2-4-fold). Propranolol- and carbachol-mediated increases in CMP-phosphatidate accumulation were at least additive in both inositol-replete and -depleted cells. The subcellular distribution of accumulated CMP-phosphatidate was investigated by sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation of a lysate of inositol-depleted cells. There were two coincident peaks of carbachol-stimulated [3H]CMP-phosphatidate and PtdIns synthase activity, respectively. The first peak of accumulated [3H]CMP-phosphatidate and PtdIns synthase activity is characteristic of a 'light vesicle' fraction, since it sediments at sucrose densities similar to that of endocytosed 125I-transferrin. The later peak, containing both carbachol-stimulated [3H]CMP-phosphatidate and PtdIns synthase activity, has a distribution in the gradient that is similar to NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity, an endoplasmic-reticulum marker. By contrast, propranolol-stimulated [3H]CMP-phosphatidate accumulates in membranes which sediment as a single peak corresponding to the endoplasmic-reticulum marker. These observations suggest that agonist-stimulated PtdIns synthesis occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and in at least one additional membrane compartment which is insensitive to propranolol, an inhibitor of endoplasmic-reticulum phosphatidate phosphohydrolase.", 
    "115": "Six patients with Marfan's syndrome were included in a study to determine the effect of beta-blockers on progressive aortic dilation. Patients' histories and results of physical examination, chest radiogram, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram are reported. Patients ranged in age from 5 years 8 months to 14 years; one was black, five were white, and four were male. The study included a brother and sister whose mother had had Marfan's syndrome and died at age 32. All six patients had aortic dilatation documented by echocardiography; two also had mitral valve prolapse. Auscultatory findings were unrevealing, but patients showed easy fatigability. During the prospective, randomized study, half of the patients were given beta-blockers; the other half formed a control group. Findings at short to midterm follow-up suggest that beta-blockers are beneficial in arresting progressive dilatation of the aorta.", 
    "116": "In this study, we examined the localization of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A receptors mediating hypothermia in the rat, evaluated the pharmacological specificity of this response and examined the influence of a series of novel 5-HT1A receptor ligands upon core temperature. Administered s.c., 8-hydroxy-(2-di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT), an agonist at both pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, elicited pronounced hypothermia. In contrast, BMY 7378, which shows low efficacy at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors but high efficacy at presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, elicited only mild hypothermia. Similarly, 8-OH-DPAT was more efficacious than BMY 7378 in eliciting corticosterone secretion, a response mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, whereas BMY 7378 was as efficacious as 8-OH-DPAT in inhibiting striatal accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan, a response mediated by presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. These data suggest, by analogy, that postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors mediate hypothermia, an interpretation supported by the observation that destruction of central 5-HT neurons with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine failed to reduce 8-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia (DIH). Agonists at 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C, 5-HT2 and/or 5-HT3 receptors did not elicit hypothermia, and drugs releasing 5-HT elicited hyperthermia. In contrast, DIH was fully mimicked by the novel 5-HT1A receptors agonists, eltoprazine, WY 48,723, MDL 72832, tandospirone, S 14671, S 14506 and WY 50,324, whereas the novel partial agonist, zalospirone, was less efficacious. DIH was blocked by (-)-alprenolol, (+/-)-pindolol and the novel beta-blocker, (-)-tertatolol, which also has high affinity for 5-HT1A receptors; in distinction, betaxolol and ICI 118,551, antagonists at beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors, respectively, were inactive. Spiperone, NAN-190 and BMY 7378 also inhibited DIH whereas ritanserin, SCH 39166, raclopride and prazosin, antagonists at 5-HT2 receptors, D1 and D2 dopamine receptors and alpha-1 adrenoceptors, respectively, were inactive. The novel 5-HT1A antagonists, WAY 100,135, MDL 73005 EF and (very potently) SDZ 216-525 all blocked DIH. Potency for induction of hypothermia and inhibition of DIH correlated well with affinity for 5-HT1A binding sites. In conclusion, hypothermia is a highly specific and sensitive response to activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. Furthermore, DIH is inhibited by their selective blockade. At postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors mediating hypothermia, eltoprazine, WY 48,723, MDL 72832 and tandospirone are agonists, zalospirone is a partial agonist and (-)-tertatolol, WAY 100,135, MDL 73005 EF and SDZ 216-525 are antagonists.", 
    "117": "Mechanisms to explain tone-dependent responses of the feline pulmonary vascular (PV) bed to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were investigated in intact-chest, spontaneously breathing cats under conditions of controlled pulmonary blood flow and constant left atrial pressure. At low (resting) PV tone, intralobar injections of 5-HT produced dose-dependent vasoconstrictor (VC) responses which were significantly blocked by the selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin and enhanced by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor meclofenamate. When PV tone was increased with 9,11-dideoxy-9 alpha 11 alpha epoxymethano prostaglandin F2 alpha, intralobar injections of 5-HT produced vasodilator (VD) responses at low doses, biphasic VC/VD responses at midrange doses and predominant VC responses at high doses. The VC responses at elevated PV tone were dose dependent and antagonized by ketanserin. The VD responses were antagonized by the mixed 5-HT1, 5-HT2 receptor antagonist methysergide. Meclofenamate had no effect on VC or VD responses of 5-HT at elevated PV tone. At both low (resting) and elevated PV tone, 5-HT and the selective 5-HT2 receptor agonist alpha-methyl-5-HT produced greater VC responses than the selective 5-HT1 receptor agonist 5-carboxyaminotryptamine and the selective 5-HT3 receptor agonist 2-methyl-5-HT. At elevated PV tone, 5-carboxyaminotryptamine and 5-HT produced greater VD responses than alpha-me-5-HT and 2-methyl-5-HT. Compared to low (resting) PV tone, VC responses of 5-HT and alpha-methyl-5-HT were enhanced at elevated PV tone. These data support that 5-HT-induced VC responses at both low (resting) and elevated PV tone are mediated by 5-HT2 receptors and 5-HT-induced VD responses at elevated PV tone are mediated by \"5-HT1-like\" receptors. A change in PV tone may alter receptor availability, affinity or receptor-effector coupling."
