    "0": "One hundred seven patients with intraocular pressures (IOPs) between 22 and 28 mmHg with normal visual fields on Goldmann perimetry and without evidence of optic nerve damage were randomly assigned to either a timolol treatment (TT) or a no treatment (NT) arm in a prospective clinical trial. The patients were followed for an average of 56 and 51 months, respectively. Criteria for failure were a confirmed IOP of greater than 32 mmHg, stereophotographically documented optic nerve progression, or development of glaucomatous visual field loss by Goldmann or Octopus perimetry. Nine patients failed in the TT group and 17 in the NT group (P = 0.07). Of the nine TT group failures, six had discontinued timolol before failure (4 for greater than 6 months). In a Cox proportional hazards analysis controlling for confounding variables, timolol was found to be significantly protective with an adjusted risk ratio of 0.38 (95% confidence interval = 0.16-0.89, P = 0.03). When only field and disc failure criteria were considered, timolol treatment was found to be significantly protective in an analysis considering patients who stopped timolol as being lost to follow-up (P = 0.05). A higher tonographic facility of outflow was protective in all analyses. A trend toward a substantial loss of effectiveness of timolol on IOP was not observed. Seasonal fluctuations in IOP were observed (P = 0.0007), with higher IOP occurring in the winter. The results demonstrate a favorable influence of timolol therapy on the clinical course of patients with mildly elevated IOP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "In a randomized double-blind study the effect of topically applied Timolol (Chibro-Timoptol 0.5%) on the retinal circulation was investigated. In order to quantify the retinal hemodynamics 20 healthy volunteers were examined twice using video fluorescein angiography. The arteriovenous passage time (AVP) and the dye bolus velocity (MDV) were quantified using an image-analyzing system. Following administration of Timolol, IOP decreased from 14.5 +/- 1.9 mm Hg to 9.4 +/- 1.7 mm Hg (P less than 0.010). The study also showed that there was a significant reduction in AVP from 1.75 +/- 0.5 s to 1.56 +/- 0.3 s (P less than 0.05) and an increase in MDV following local application of Timolol. No effect on systemic blood pressure or pulse rate was observed. The results indicate that in addition to its pressure-lowering effect, timolol also leads to increased retinal perfusion.", 
    "2": "Understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertension and diabetes mellitus and their association is at present fragmentary at best. Optimal antihypertensive drug therapy of patients with both disorders is therefore based on limited experimental data, practical experience and educated guesswork, and needs to be tailored to each (often multimorbid) individual. In most patients monotherapy would be preferred, and would begin with a calcium antagonist or a converting enzyme inhibitor at a low to moderate dosage. If this is not effective an alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibitor, a cardioselective beta-blocker or a diuretic, always at a low to moderate dosage, should be tried. If still unsuccessful, low dose combinations of 2 of these drugs are next. The (long term) regimen should be as simple as possible, and its effects--desired and undesired--monitored as closely as the carbohydrate disorder.", 
    "3": "Administration of Escherichia coli endotoxin (100 micrograms/100 g, i.v.) to conscious rats induces transient hyperglycemia and a sustained increase in whole body glucose turnover. To identify the tissues responsible for the increase in glucose utilization, the glucose metabolic rate (Rg) of peripheral tissues was determined in vivo by the 2-deoxyglucose tracer technique during and after the hyperglycemic phase. Rg was markedly increased in spleen, liver, intestine, epidydimal fat, gastrocnemius muscle, and skin during the early hyperglycemic period (80 min after endotoxin) and remained elevated in the subsequent euglycemic period (220 min). Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, achieved by the primed continuous infusion of phentolamine and propranolol, prevented the transient hyperglycemia that followed endotoxin injection. Adrenergic blockade also prevented or considerably attenuated the early increases in tissue glucose utilization that were induced by endotoxin. The results indicate that the early increase in Rg can be mainly attributed to adrenergic stimulation and the resultant hyperglycemia, while the sustained elevation is due to mechanisms independent of hyperglycemia.", 
    "4": "The role of renal nerves and norepinephrine release on renin secretion during fetal and postnatal maturation has not been studied. Experiments were performed to determine the effect of veratridine, a substance known to promote norepinephrine release from nerve terminals, on active and inactive renin secretion from renal cortical slices of fetal (134-138 days gestation; term is 145 days), newborn (4-9 days of age), and adult nonpregnant sheep. Veratridine (10-300 microM) significantly increased active renin secretion and produced a small but nonsignificant rise in inactive renin secretion in all three groups of animals (P less than 0.05). The percent rise in active renin secretion during veratridine stimulation was similar among all groups. Veratridine-stimulated (300 microM) active renin secretion was antagonized by tetrodotoxin (0.5 and 5.0 microM) and DL-propranolol (1 microM) in fetal renal cortical slices. However, neither tetrodotoxin nor propranolol completely inhibited the stimulatory effect of veratridine on active renin secretion. These results suggest that 1) norepinephrine released from nerve terminals may regulate active renin secretion early during development; 2) the effect of veratridine on active renin secretion was similar in fetal, newborn, and adult sheep; 3) veratridine had no significant effect on inactive renin secretion; and 4) active renin secretion due to depolarization of nerve terminals in fetal sheep is dependent on activation of beta-adrenoceptors as it is in adults.", 
    "5": "Thirteen women during the 5th and 6th weeks of gestation were treated with a progesterone receptor blocker (ZK 98734) for pregnancy termination. Five patients received 100 mg/day of the compound, and eight patients received 50 mg/day for 4 days. Daily blood samples were obtained during the treatment period as well as on days 8 and 15 after the beginning of drug administration, and cytotoxic activity, progesterone sensitivity, and progesterone binding capacity of the lymphocytes were determined. Determination of SP-1 concentrations monitored the saturation state of trophoblastic progesterone receptors. High and low responders to the progesterone antagonist were identified. Lymphocytes of high responders treated with the 100 mg/day dose demonstrated a rapid increase of cytotoxicity, with a concomitant fall in progesterone sensitivity and progesterone binding capacity. Vaginal bleeding began as early as the 2nd day of treatment, and pregnancy was terminated by the 8th day of the treatment. Low responders receiving 100 mg/day demonstrated similar but attenuated changes. Low responders did not bleed during the first 4 days of treatment, and termination of pregnancy occurred later compared to high responders. Lymphocytes of high responders treated with 50 mg/day behaved similarly to those obtained from the low responders treated with 100 mg/day, and abortion was not completed before the 25th day after the beginning of the treatment. Lymphocytes function of low responders treated with 50 mg/day did not change significantly, the SP-1 concentration did not decline, and pregnancies continued. We conclude that a difference in sensitivity to the progesterone receptor blocker explains the selective block at trophoblastic binding sites only and the inability to block those in the lymphocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "There is increasing evidence that mechano-electric feedback, defined as a change in mechanical state that precedes and alters transmembrane potential, operates in a wide variety of preparations and species including man. Load reduction is becoming a common therapeutic tool in a variety of clinical settings but the electrophysiological effects of these manoeuvres is not known. In this study the effect of changes in loading conditions on the time course of ventricular repolarisation were examined in the in situ heart in 13 pigs anaesthetised with halothane. Monophasic action potentials, electrocardiograms and segment length changes were recorded from the left ventricular epicardium using suction operated devices. Afterload was decreased by intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside, and increased by aortic cross clamping. Infusion of sodium nitroprusside resulted in a rise in action potential duration (measured at 70% repolarisation) in all 21 infusions (mean 3.4 ms), which was linearly related to the fall in systolic left ventricular pressure (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001) and the change in minimum systolic segment length (r = 0.46, p less than 0.05), but not to the change in maximum diastolic length (r = 0.33, NS). Aortic constriction, sufficient to elevate peak systolic left ventricular pressure back to the control level, restored the changes in action potential duration to normal. In addition, there were concomitant changes in the QT interval and T wave of the epicardial ECG. These findings show that mechano-electric feedback operates in the in situ heart and has potential importance in the clinical setting where changes in systemic blood pressure may directly alter cardiac electrophysiology.", 
    "7": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed to determine the levels of propranolol and its major metabolite, 4-hydroxypropranolol, in human plasma. The limits of determination are 10 ng ml-1 of propranolol and 5 ng ml-1 of 4-hydroxypropranolol using a 0.5-ml plasma sample. The stability of plasma samples stored at -30 degrees C for up to 2 months was also tested. No stabilising antioxidants were added to the samples.", 
    "8": "The study of clinical manifestations and cardiodynamics in macrofocal myocardial infarction was conducted a few hours or days since the disease onset. Altogether 36 patients were examined. Obsidan administration was employed in 24 patients, basic indication to its use being clinico-hemodynamic++ signs of sympathetic hyperactivity. Clinical response to the drug was correlated with reactions of neurohumoral adaptation of the acute phase: levels of cyclic AMP, GMP and serotonin. Potentiating effect on obsidan analgesia, resolution of clinical symptoms of sympathetic hypertonus efficient energetic regime of the heart are mediated by activation of stress-limiting systems, i.e. links of cGMP and serotonin mechanisms.", 
    "9": "To formulate right ventricular (RV) mechanical and energetic properties in terms of the time-varying elastance model, Emax and the systolic pressure-volume area (PVA) of RV were measured in the excised cross-circulated heart preparation, while the left ventricle was beating unloaded. Emax of RV was constant, and independent of the RV volume, the stroke volume, the ejection velocity, and the pre-ejection period in the control contractile state. Enhancement of the contractile state with calcium increased Emax, and reduction of the contractile state with propranolol decreased Emax. The whole heart oxygen consumption (Vo2) was linearly regressed on PVA of RV, in both the control and the calcium-enhanced contractile state. Calcium elevated the regression line in a parallel manner. The slope of the regression line was (1.85 +/- 0.19) x 10(-5) ml O2/mmHg ml in the control state, and (1.57 +/- 0.44) in the calcium state. These slope values were similar to those in left ventricle (LV). We therefore conclude that mechanical and energetic properties of RV are similar to those of LV.", 
    "10": "Myocardial contractility of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rabbits was determined following an iv bolus injection of propranolol HCl. Left ventricular pressure and dimension were used to calculate the contractility parameters of (dP/dt)max, maximum fiber shortening velocity (Vcf), and the slope of the end systolic pressure-end systolic volume line (ESP-ESV line). Hypertension was induced by a methoxamine HCl iv infusion which mimicked the cardiac effects seen in essential hypertension. Propranolol caused a significant decrease in all contractility parameters (p less than 0.05) within 15 min after administration, with a peak effect occurring after 30-35 mins. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propranolol were fit using Hill's equation in conjunction with the concentration of drug in the theoretical effect compartment. The normotensive group of rabbits had a calculated EC(50) of 12.7 ng/ml, while the hypertensive group had an EC(50) of 6.9 ng/ml, indicating that the hypertensive rabbits were much more sensitive to the propranolol than the normotensive group. In addition, the normotensive group of rabbits demonstrated a much different pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship than that of the hypertensive group, indicating that the hypertensive state of the animal has a significant effect upon the concentration-effect relationship.", 
    "11": "1. The aim of the present investigation was to examine if adrenaline released as a cotransmitter by field stimulation of sympathetic neurons in rabbit isolated aorta facilitates noradrenaline release by activation of presynaptic beta-adrenoreceptors. 2. Rabbit aortic rings were preincubated with adrenaline (10(-8)-3 x 10(-6) M) or noradrenaline (10(-8)-3 x 10(-6) M) prior to incubation with 3H-noradrenaline (3H-NA; 10(-7) M). Subsequently, the tissues were subjected to repeated electrical-field stimulation. 3. Preincubation of aorta with either adrenaline or noradrenaline did not change the time course of repeated stimulation-evoked 3H-overflow from tissues preloaded with 3H-NA. 4. Propranolol (10(-8)-10(-6) M) did not alter the stimulation-evoked 3H-overflow. 5. Rauwolscine (10(-7)-10(-5) M) enhanced markedly the 3H-overflow evoked by stimulation. In the presence of rauwolscine, propranolol (10(-8)-10(-6) M) and metoprolol (10(-8)-10(-6) M) did not change the 3H-overflow. 6. In experiments using rings of aorta exposed to adrenaline (10(-8) M) for 30 min in the absence of cocaine, stimulation-evoked 3H-overflow was not affected after withdrawal of adrenaline. This was also the case in the presence of propranolol (10(-6) M). 7. We conclude that adrenaline released as a cotransmitter from sympathetic nerve terminals in rabbit aorta does not facilitate noradrenaline release.", 
    "12": "The hemodynamic effects of the combination of clonidine and propranolol were studied in conscious rats with portal hypertension owing to secondary biliary cirrhosis. Pressure and blood flow measurements (radioactive microsphere method) were performed in three groups of eight rats before and after drug administration. The combined effects of clonidine (2 micrograms/100 g body wt., i.v.) and propranolol (0.2 mg/min for 10 min) were compared with those observed after administration of either clonidine alone or propranolol alone. The association of clonidine and propranolol induced significant decreases in portal pressure (30%) and portal tributary blood flow (43%), the magnitude of these changes being significantly more marked than that after administration of either clonidine alone (12 and 20%, respectively) or propranolol alone (16 and 17%, respectively). After the combination, no significant change in arterial pressure was observed, but cardiac output significantly decreased and systemic vascular resistance significantly increased. Renal blood flow decreased to a similar extent (40%) in the three groups. These findings indicate that the combination of clonidine and propranolol is more effective for reversing splanchnic hemodynamic changes than clonidine alone or propranolol alone. The additive effects of this association are in agreement with the action of clonidine and propranolol at different levels (central and peripheral) and on different receptors (alpha and beta). It suggests that an increase in sympathetic activity may play a major role in hemodynamic changes observed in experimental cirrhosis.", 
    "13": "At a critical premature interval, atrial premature beats encounter sinus node refractoriness and are blocked on entering and fail to reset the sinus node, resulting in interpolation of the premature beat. The transition from reset to interpolated response has been used to define the effective refractory period of the sinus node (SNERP). In an in vitro preparation of rabbit sinus node, we evaluated the effects of acetylcholine, propranolol, and verapamil on SNERP. Results obtained in the control state were compared with those obtained during superfusion with drugs, all of which prolonged refractoriness: acetylcholine from 233 +/- 41 (SD) to 325 +/- 88 ms; propranolol from 215 +/- 60 to 241 +/- 67 ms; and verapamil from 192 +/- 69 to 254 +/- 79 ms (p less than 0.005 with all drugs). The site of block of premature beats was mapped between sinus node and crista terminalis with an intracellular microelectrode. All three drugs resulted in block of premature beats at sites farther from the primary pacemaker site. Thus, acetylcholine, propranolol, and verapamil prolong sinus node refractoriness.",

    "15": "The potential of erythrocytes (RBC) to serve as \"barriers\" of hepatic elimination of propranolol, a drug with rapid equilibration in blood, was studied in rats under two conditions: (I) the drug was preequilibrated in blood before infusion into the liver, and (II) the drug was directly infused into the liver. The mean fractions of dose escaping elimination during each pass under conditions I and II were 0.0561 +/- 0.040 and 0.0290 +/- 0.024, respectively (P less than 0.02). Contrary to the early study on doxorubicin, most drug molecules in RBC were found to be available for elimination. Implications of the present findings in the prediction of hepatic first-pass effect after oral administration, on the basis of intravenous data, are discussed. Marked underestimation of oral bioavailability of propranolol in humans is consistent with the RBC \"barrier\" effect hypothesis.", 
    "16": "In 24 patients with stable spontaneous and effort-related angina, ischemic episodes at rest were not preceded by changes in circulatory variables (heart rate, systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures) that may raise myocardial oxygen consumption. We interpreted these episodes as caused by critical and reversible coronary flow reduction at the site of a stenotic lesion, and evaluated the clinical efficacy of nifedipine and propranolol in the treatment of this condition. Propranolol fully abolished or reduced the number of spontaneous ischemic episodes in a significantly larger number of patients than did nifedipine; it was also effective in several cases in whom nifedipine had failed or had even caused a paradoxic effect. Quantitative angiographic evaluation of the influence of nifedipine (Group 1, 12 patients, 10 mg sublingually) and propranolol (Group 2, 12 patients, 0.1 mg/kg intravenously) on the residual lumen diameter of 1 significant coronary stenosis in each patient showed that after nifedipine, the lumen was unchanged in 1, augmented in 7, and reduced in 4 cases; variations ranged between +1.59 and -1.2 mm, and their direction correlated closely with the influence of oral nifedipine on the episodes of spontaneous ischemia; and in no case did treatment with propranolol vary the stenosis lumen by more than 0.3mm. In this form of angina, a number of lesions seem to offer a compliant substrate for vasomotion and, possibly, for critical changes in flow. The vasomotor influences of nifedipine on these lesions are variable as well as the efficacy of the drug on the manifestations of ischemia at rest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "Experiments were performed under the same condition described in the accompanying paper. (1) Injection of sodium L-glutamate (Glu) into A5 area of rat induced depressor and bradycardia responses, as Glu-injection into A1 area did. (2) Bilateral vagotomy also markedly attenuated the cardiovascular effect of Glu-injection into A5. (3) Influences of the receptor blockers injected into rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVL) on the depressor and bradycardia responses of Glu-injection into A5 were slightly different from those of the same receptor blockers administered into RVL: phentolamine, propranolol, naloxone and bicuculline all markedly reduced the depressor and bradycardia effects of A5-excitation (propranolol and bicuculline even reversed these effects). These results indicate that not only alpha-, beta-, GABA receptors, but also opiate receptors mediate the depressor and bradycardia effects of A5.", 
    "18": "In chloral hydrate-anesthetized, tubocurarine-immobilized and artificially ventilated rats, the following results were observed: (1) Microinjection of sodium L-glutamate (Glu) into A1 area induced a significant fall in blood pressure and heart rate. (2) Bilateral vagotomy markedly reduced the magnitude of the depressor and bradycardia effects of Glu-injection into A1. (3) Injection of phentolamine or propranolol into bilateral RVL reduced the depressor effect of Glu-injection into A1. Naloxone-injection into RVL had no significant influence on cardiovascular effects of A1-excitation, but injecting bicuculline into RVL could reverse both depressor and bradycardia effects of A1 area. The results suggest that A1 exerts its cardiovascular effects mainly via RVL, and the alpha-, beta- and GABA-receptors within RVL (but not opiate receptors) mediate the hypotension effect of A1 area, while GABA-receptors play an important role in mediating the bradycardia effect of the A1 area.", 
    "19": "Biodegradable pellets intended for either parenteral or oral use were successfully prepared from low molecular weight poly(DL-lactide) (low MW PLA, MW' = 2000) or a relatively high molecular weight poly(L-lactide) (L-PLA, MW = 215,000) sample by a simple direct compression technique without the use of heat or organic solvents. The energy imparted during the compression step caused fusion of the low MW PLA particles. Pellets prepared from low MW PLA swelled considerably before eroding in pH 7.4 buffer, but acted as an enteric matrix in 0.1 M HCl. This was attributed to the high carboxyl endgroup:polymer chain ratio which increased with a decrease in molecular weight. Interactions between salts of basic drugs (quinidine sulfate or propranolol hydrochloride) and the polymeric carboxyl endgroups caused retardation in the drug release from low MW PLA pellets. The drug release from L-PLA pellets was independent of the pH of the dissolution media and drug-polymer interactions were absent. The drug release could be increased by admixing sodium chloride prior to compression, or reduced by dipping the pellets into methylene chloride for a short period of time.", 
    "20": "The pars intermedia of the pituitary gland in Xenopus laevis secretes alpha-melanophore-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), which causes dispersion of pigment in dermal melanophores in animals on a black background. In the present study we have determined plasma levels of alpha-MSH in animals undergoing adaptation to white and black backgrounds. Plasma values of black-adapted animals were high and decreased rapidly after transfer to a white background, as did the degree of pigment dispersion in dermal melanophores. Plasma MSH values of white-adapted animals were below the detection limit of our radioimmunoassay. Transfer of white animals to a black background resulted in complete dispersion of melanophore pigment within a few hours, but plasma MSH levels remained low for at least 24 hr. This discrepancy between plasma MSH and degree of pigment dispersion suggested the involvement of an additional factor for stimulating dispersion. Results of in vitro and in vivo experiments with receptor agonists and antagonists indicated that a beta-adrenergic mechanism, functioning at the level of the melanophore, is involved in the stimulation of pigment dispersion during the early stages of background adaptation.", 
    "21": "The efficacy of sustained-release diltiazem (diltiazem-SR) 120 mg b.i.d. was compared with metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. in 12 patients with stable angina. Following a 1-week placebo period, patients received diltiazem-SR or metoprolol in two 3-week treatment periods, in a randomized double-blind crossover design. Total exercise time was increased more with diltiazem-SR than with metoprolol (1.2 min vs 0.4 min, P = 0.02), although the reduction in frequency of weekly anginal attacks was equal with both drugs (5 +/- 3 with placebo to 1 +/- 1 with both drugs). The difference between diltiazem-SR and metoprolol may, in part, be due to the fact that the tests were performed 12 h after drug administration. The diltiazem plasma levels were in the therapeutic range; metoprolol plasma levels, in contrast, were all below the therapeutic range. In addition, the patients might be tired out earlier during beta-blockade therapy, because a greater increase in exercise time with diltiazem-SR compared with metoprolol was found in those patients in whom the exercise endpoint changed from angina to fatigue. Thus, diltiazem-SR effectively reduces the frequency of anginal attacks when given twice daily, and improves exercise capacity to a greater extent than metoprolol 12 h after last dose.", 
    "22": "Cardiac effects of drugs used for circulatory disorders in traditional Japanese medicine based on ancient Chinese medicine (Kampo Medicine): Saikoka-ryukotsu-borei-to, Oren-gedoku-to, Toki-shakuyaku-san, Shimbu-to, Moku-boi-to, Ryo-kei-jutsu-kan-to, Sha-kanzo-to, Keishi-ninjin-to, Toki-to and Ryo-kan-kyo-mi-shin-ge-nin-to were investigated using canine isolated, blood-perfused sinoatrial node and papillary muscle preparations. Single injections of small doses of Oren-gedoku-to, Moku-boi-to and Ryo-kan-kyo-mi-shin-ge-nin-to (0.1 to 3 mg) dose-dependently increased the sinoatrial rate and the developed tension of papillary muscle, while other drugs showed almost no effect on these parameters. All the drugs had almost no effect on the blood flow through the nutrient arteries of each preparation. The positive chronotropic and inotropic effects induced by Oren-gedoku-to, Moku-boi-to and Ryo-kan-kyo-mi-shin-ge-nin-to did not show tachyphylaxis and were not affected after pharmacological denervation by tetrodotoxin treatment or by reserpine pretreatment, but were significantly suppressed by atenolol. These results indicate that these three drugs act as beta-adrenoceptor agonists to produce clinically useful cardiac effects.", 
    "23": "The effects of labetalol, diltiazem and verapamil on antipyrine and indocyanine green clearance were evaluated in a placebo-controlled, repeated measures evaluation. Twelve healthy subjects received either labetalol (200 mg every 12 hours), diltiazem (90 mg. every 8 hours), verapamil (80 mg every 8 hours), or placebo (every 12 hours) for 4 days. On the morning of Day 3 immediately following their dose, the subjects assumed the supine position for 90 minutes, after which time a 0.5 mg/kg dose of indocyanine green was administered. Blood samples were obtained serially over a 20 minutes period for indocyanine green plasma concentration determinations by HPLC. Ten minutes later, subjects ingested a 1.2 Gm. dose of antipyrine and blood samples were obtained over a 48 hour period for antipyrine plasma concentration determinations by HPLC. A 2 week washout period separated treatment sequences. Mean (SD) antipyrine clearance (L/hr/kg) following diltiazem [0.028 (0.010)] and verapamil [0.030 (0.012)] treatment was significantly lower than that observed following placebo [0.039 (0.012)]. Antipyrine clearance following labetalol administration [0.033 (0.010)] was not significantly different from that observed following placebo, diltiazem or verapamil administration. No effects of these drugs on indocyanine green clearance could be detected.", 
    "24": "1. The ocular hypotensive effect of 0.025% bromocriptine and 0.25% timolol eye drops was compared in nine healthy human volunteers, using non-contact tonometry. 2. Considering all post-dosing measurements compared with placebo and including the baseline values as continuous independent variables, using multiple linear regression analysis, both bromocriptine and timolol had a significant ocular hypotensive effect (P less than 0.0001) in the treated eye with a significant but lesser effect in the contralateral eye. 3. In the concentrations used, timolol was more efficacious than bromocriptine in lowering intraocular pressure (P less than 0.025). 4. Using other forms of vehicles for bromocriptine to improve efficacy and studying the ocular hypotensive effect of topical application of other dopamine-2-receptor agonists such as pergolide and lisuride was suggested.", 
    "25": "The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the transfollicular pathway in the diffusion process of chemicals through excised human skin in vitro. Skin was obtained from 5 cadavers (3 males, 3 females) within 24 h of death. The age of the subjects varied between 18-77 years. Three radiolabelled drugs, namely 14C-coumarin, 3H-propranolol and 3H-griseofulvin, were studied. The permeation parameters such as flux, lag time, diffusion coefficient and permeability constant were determined across scalp and abdominal skin using the Thomas Diffusion Cell. For all tested substances the flux through scalp skin was higher than across abdominal skin and the lag time was decreased. The differences were statistically significant at p less than 0.05 for coumarin and propranolol. These data suggest that the transfollicular pathway in permeation might have a significant impact on the diffusion parameters for some drugs. Also, in the case of coumarin, permeability seems to be epidermis/dermis-controlled, whereas for griseofulvin and propranolol the Stratum corneum apparently is the permeability limiting barrier.", 
    "26": "Light absorption and fluorescence measurements can be used to detect accumulations of small molecules in intraocular lenses (IOLs). It was shown that HEMA IOLs can store and to some extent release a variety of drugs and fluorescein. PMMA and silicone IOLs, however, do not have this characteristic. UV-blocking IOLs absorb UV light completely. The absorption limit varies between 390 and 410 nm, depending on the make. Neither absorption nor fluorescence response were affected by exposure to UV light or heat.", 
    "27": "The relative influences of sympathetic and parasympathetic neural modulation on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), and their respective variabilities, were studied in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). An on-line computerized system was used for continuous intra-arterial measurements of MAP and HR in unrestrained rats. In addition, the autonomic nervous control of MAP and HR was studied in ageing SHR and WKY. Both WKY and SHR showed diurnal rhythms with regard to MAP and HR. The MAP variability was higher in SHR than in WKY during both daytime (inactive) and night-time (active), and did not change in response to either beta 1-adrenoceptor- or cholinergic blockade. Structural vascular changes, with a resultant increase in reactivity, may explain the elevated MAP variability in SHR. HR variability was clearly reduced in SHR; this was not influenced by vagal blockade, whereas HR variability was significantly reduced in WKY. This pattern is suggested to be due to a reduced tonic vagal discharge in SHR, as part of a persistent, mild defence reaction. The initial reduction in vagal activity will in turn eliminate vagally mediated tachycardias. Furthermore, administration beta 1-blockade to SHR of different ages caused a greater fall in MAP and HR than in WKY, indicating an increased dependence upon the sympathetic nervous system in SHR with age.",

    "29": "Decreased elimination of sotalol (160 mg) is found in patients with renal insufficiency. Simulation of plasma concentrations at steady-state exhibits moderately higher concentrations when creatinine clearance is between 10 and 30 ml/min and very high plasma concentrations when creatinine clearance is less than 10 ml/min suggesting, if treatment is absolutely necessary, monitoring in these cases and the reduction of the dose in major renal insufficiency.", 
    "30": "To determine whether beta-blockade protects rat heart against thyroxine (T4)-induced accelelation of lipid peroxidation, in vivo effects of 3 beta-blockers with different ancillary properties on the mitochondrial oxidative enzyme, antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxide were investigated. The rats were rendered hyperthyroid by adding T4 to their drinking water for 3 weeks and were treated simultaneously with either carteolol (a blocker with partial agonist activity; 30 mg/kg/day), atenolol (50 mg/kg/day) or arotinolol (a blocker with weak alpha-blocking action; 50 mg/kg/day). The T4-induced tachycardia was alleviated completely by either atenolol or arotinolol, but only partially by carteolol. Cytochrome c oxidase activity in the heart muscle was increased by T4 with a parallel increase in manganese (mitochondrial) superoxide dismutase. Atenolol, but neither carteolol nor arotinolol, suppressed this increase. Similarly, the T4-induced acceleration of lipid peroxidation was suppressed by atenolol alone. Glutathione peroxidase was markedly decreased, and both copper zinc (cytosolic) superoxide dismutase and catalase were also decreased or tended to be decreased by T4. The levels of these 3 enzymes were only minimally affected by the beta-blocker treatments. These results suggest that beta-blockade suppresses mitochondrial hypermetabolism and protects heart muscle against oxidative stress in hyperthyroidism, and that the ancillary properties of beta-blockers such as partial agonist activity and alpha-blocking action negate the protection.", 
    "31": "The status of platelet aggregability, cyclic nucleotides and the thromboxane-prostacyclin system was examined in 40 patients with Functional Class II-III angina pectoris treated with perdipine, a calcium antagonist, and in 40 patients with Stage II hypertensive disease treated with tenolol, a beta-adrenoblocker. The therapy was found to modify the initially abnormal parameters of platelet-vessel hemostasis both in coronary heart disease and hypertension. When the initial parameters of platelet functional activity were normal, the treatment with perdipine and tenolol caused no noticeable changes.", 
    "32": "1. In pithed rats, the blood pressure effects of ATP, alpha,beta-methylene ATP (mATP), alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists and of electrical stimulation of the thoracolumbar sympathetic outflow were studied in the absence and presence of mATP, suramin and adrenoreceptor antagonists. 2. ATP elicited an initial rise in mean blood pressure followed by a decrease and a second increase. mATP produced a short-lived increase in blood pressure, whereas equieffective doses of noradrenaline, methoxamine and B-HT 920 (6-allyl-2-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-thiazolo-(5,4-d)-azepine) produced a more prolonged, biphasic pressor response. 3. In the presence of high doses of prazosin, rauwolscine plus propranolol, the initial vasopressor and the vasodepressor effect to ATP were not affected, whereas the delayed vasopressor response to ATP, the vasopressor response to electrical stimulation and even more so that to noradrenaline were suppressed. 4. Suramin, which by itself produced a short-lived decrease, followed by a persistent increase in blood pressure, decreased the pressor responses to ATP (initial phase), to mATP and to electrical stimulation without affecting the fall and second rise in blood pressure elicited by ATP and the pressor response to noradrenaline. 5. Desensitization of P2x receptors by a low dose of mATP abolished the initial vasopressor response to ATP but failed to affect the subsequent blood pressure effects of ATP as well as the pressor responses to noradrenaline and electrical stimulation. A high dose of mATP, in addition, decreased the vasopressor responses to noradrenaline, methoxamine, B-HT 920 and electrical stimulation; the delayed effects of ATP on blood pressure were not changed. 6. The electrically induced increase in blood pressure subsequent to administration of high doses of prazosin, rauwolscine plus propranolol was diminished by suramin and by the low and high dose of mATP. 7. The present study suggests that under certain circumstances ATP, which, added exogenously, has a triphasic effect on mean blood pressure, contributes to the electrically induced vasopressor response by activation of P2x receptors.", 
    "33": "The alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors were found to strengthen a depressor effect of prostacyclin and to increase the heart rate in dogs. The blockade of M-cholinoreactive structures increased the systolic volume alone.", 
    "34": "The effects of celiprolol on the heart rate (HR) and the total peripheral resistance (TPR) were studied in chronically instrumented conscious dogs in comparison with those of pindolol, propranolol and labetalol. Intravenous injection of pindolol, celiprolol and labetalol increased the HR and decreased the TPR dose-dependently, whereas propranolol did not. The ratios of doses that elicited 12% changes in both parameters (HR12/TPR12) were 4.85 +/- 2.63, 0.61 +/- 0.03 and 0.42 +/- 0.11 for celiprolol, pindolol and labetalol, respectively, indicating the preferential reduction of TPR by celiprolol. Changes in HR and TPR produced by these three agents were antagonized by propranolol dose-dependently. However, inhibition by 3 mg/kg of propranolol was incomplete in the cases of labetalol-induced decrease in the TPR at the dose of TPR12 (51%) and celiprolol-induced increase in the HR at the dose of HR12 (89%). These results suggest that changes produced by celiprolol as well as pindolol and labetalol were mostly explainable by partial agonist activity via beta-adrenoceptors. However, the contribution of the alpha-blocking activity must also be taken into consideration in the case of the reduction of the TPR by labetalol. In addition, there is a possibility that celiprolol may increase HR via its direct action.",

The influence of changing the b.p.d. with aspirin on the buccal absorption of propranolol from a series of buffers of pH5-10 has been studied in eight volunteers. The study confirmed that the buccal absorption of propranolol was markedly pH dependent, but pretreatment of the buccal membrane with aspirin had no influence on the absorption of propranolol.", 
    "36": "The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of two betablockers: atenolol and bopindolol, was compared in a group of 30 elderly subjects aged 64.8 +/- 4.6 years. The daily dose of the two agents was relatively low. Atenolol 50-100 mg and bopindolol 0.5-1.0 mg sufficed to cause reduction of DBP to the target of less than or equal to 95 mm Hg, when applied as monotherapy. This was achieved in 75% of cases with bopindolol and in 93% of cases with atenolol. Atenolol, 50-100 mg/dd, lowered blood pressure from 173.7 +/- 13.2/103.7 +/- 3.0 (weekly) to 155.5 +/- 16.5/86.5 +/- 8.2 mm Hg (week 12) (P less than 0.005) while bopindolol, 0.5-1.0 mg, lowered blood pressure from 171.6 +/- 11.3/104.1 +/- 3.6 to 158.7 +/- 20.9/86.1 +/- 6.0 mm Hg (P less than 0.005). Heart rate was reduced from 80.5 (week 4) to 66.7 +/- 7.3 (week 12) by atenolol (P less than 0.0001), and from 83.7 +/- 11.8 (week 4) to 71.1 +/- 7.5 (week 12) by bopindolol (P less than 0.0001). Between treatment differences: comparisons yielded P values which were not sufficiently low to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the two treatments. Well-being and short-term memory were not affected by either agent and tolerability of both drugs was good. These findings demonstrate that both bopindolol and atenolol are useful agents for control of hypertension in the elderly.", 
    "37": "Changes in femoral vein pH, lactate, glucose and potassium were studied in a double-blind randomized, short-term, dynamic cycle ergometry exercise test on six healthy male subjects after administration of non-selective (timolol), beta-1-selective (atenolol) beta blocker or placebo. The exercise intensity was increased in steps of 200 kpm/min every 2 min until exhaustion. During submaximal exercise, potassium concentrations in blood from the exercising leg muscles increased progressively with increasing exercise intensity, and was significantly higher for any given exercise level following timolol as compared to placebo administration. The potassium concentrations following atenolol were in-between those of timolol and placebo. Despite reduced working capacity after non-selective beta blockade, almost identical potassium concentrations were reached at exhaustion irrespective of treatment regimens (placebo: 6.3, range 5.8-6.8 mmol/l; atenolol: 6.5, range 6.1-7.3 mmol/l and timolol: 6.4, range 6.2-6.8 mmol/l). The increase in s-lactate concentrations was similar across all treatments, and rose in proportion to the increase in the exercise intensity. A biphasic increase in lactate was observed with identical breaking points (anaerobic threshold) irrespective of treatment regimens. There was no difference in glucose concentrations between the treatment regimens. The marked increase in serum potassium during maximal exercise coincides with leg muscle fatigue and may, by its effect on the muscle cell membrane potential, limit the maximal working capacity following beta blockers. The rise in serum potassium may curtail the use of maximal exercise test as an index of cardiac performance in healthy young subjects.", 
    "38": "In rats the effect of i.p. applied beta-adrenomimetic isoprenaline (ISO) 0.4 mg/kg, sulbutamol (SAL) 2mg/kg, beta-adrenoblocker propranolol (PRO) 2 mg/kg and metipranolol (MET) 4 mg/kg on the duration of perphenazine-induced catalepsy (CAT) and pressure-maintained tonic immobility (TI) was studied. It appeared that a mild constant pressure on the rat body permitted to measure the length of duration of TI in adult rats. The time course of changes in the duration of CAT and TI was repeatedly measured in one-hour intervals with different results. While ISO had no effect on the duration of CAT, SAL prolonged it. Both beta-symathomimetic compounds prolonged the duration of TI. PRO and MET shortened the duration of CAT. PRO did not influence, MET failed in the first phase but in the second phase it significantly prolonged TI duration. In spite of a certain affinity of both phenomena the two, that is, CAT and TI were not parallely influenced by the betasympathotropic agents used.", 
    "39": "Beta-blockers can precipitate hypoglycemia and mask its warning signs. Ten male insulin-dependent, otherwise healthy diabetic patients underwent two submaximal exercise tests and two insulin-induced hypoglycemic events (0.2 u/Kg short-acting insulin IV) after six days administration of placebo followed by tertatolol, a non selective beta-blocker (5 mg once daily). Tertatolol modified neither the exercise-induced changes in blood glucose, lactate and plasma unesterified fatty acid levels, nor those of counter regulatory hormones (glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol), while blood pressure, heart rate and plasma renin activity were significantly reduced, proving that tertatolol had actually been ingested, and was active. During the insulin-induced hypoglycemia, similarly tertatolol did not modify the course of the plasma fuels and hormones. Particularly, hypoglycemia was neither deeper nor more prolonged in the presence than in the absence of tertatolol. Warning symptoms were not affected except for palpitations which were not perceived. These results suggest that tertatolol did not precipitate hypoglycemia following exercise, and did not aggravate insulin-induced hypoglycemia in short term administration, and in otherwise healthy diabetic patients.", 
    "40": "Because of the physiologic changes associated with aging, a nonpharmacologic approach is recommended as initial therapy for the elderly hypertensive. Approximately 80% of this patient population, however, requires pharmacologic therapy, as well. When initiating drug treatment, the physician should remember several guidelines and have some understanding of the mechanisms of action of the available agents. The four drug classes recommended by JNC IV for the treatment of high blood pressure are quite similar in effectiveness. Low-dose diuretics, however, particularly when combined with a potassium-sparing agent, produce significantly fewer adverse reactions than seen with the other classes of drugs. This advantage, coupled with their low cost, makes diuretics the reasonable first choice for the treatment of older hypertensives.", 
    "41": "Symptomatic and metabolic side effects seen in the treatment of elderly hypertensive patients are an area of concern for physicians. Of the four drug classes used as Step 1 antihypertensive agents--diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium-entry blocking agents--only diuretics have been studied as monotherapy for the elderly in placebo-controlled, long-term clinical trials. These studies have shown diuretics to be well tolerated in this patient population, producing only mild, infrequent side effects.", 
    "42": "This laboratory previously reported that centrally administered interleukin 1 (IL-1) in fasted pentobarbital-anesthetized rats elicited significant hyperinsulinemic and febrile responses. In characterizing this putative central mechanism for the regulation of pancreatic insulin secretion, hyperinsulinemia and fever elicited by IL-1 injected intravenously (iv) or intracerebroventricularly (icv) was totally eliminated by prior cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin, ibuprofen, or meclofenamate but not lipoxygenase inhibition with propyl gallate or leukotriene receptor antagonism with LY 171883. Furthermore, central administration of prostaglandin E2 at 10 and 100 ng doses consistently evoked hyperinsulinemic, hypercorticotropinemic, and febrile responses in anesthetized rats maintained on isothermal pads. beta-Adrenergic and vagus nerves to the pancreatic beta-cells seemed likely candidates to mediate the enhanced secretion of insulin elicited by IL-1 acting centrally. However, pretreatment of rats with hexamethonium, propanolol, atropine, or bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy all failed to reduce hyperinsulinemia after IL-1 iv or icv. This evidence suggests that the central mechanism for enhanced pancreatic insulin secretion elicited by IL-1 may depend on a humoral rather than autonomic neural efferent pathway. Moreover, the hyperinsulinemia is mediated in part by prostaglandins just like the well-studied febrile response.", 
    "43": "In 15 previously untreated hypertensive subjects with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy who responded favorably (supine blood pressure less than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg) to antihypertensive treatment with a nonselective beta-blocking agent, tertatolol, the effects of reversal of LV hypertrophy on systolic and diastolic function were assessed. Patients underwent echocardiographic and radionuclide studies in control conditions (phase 1), after 1 month of blood pressure normalization (phase 2), after reversal of LV hypertrophy or at least a 20% reduction of LV mass compared to basal value (phase 3) and finally, after a 1-month washout (phase 4). In phase 2, blood pressure (130 +/- 2/85 +/- 1 vs 148 +/- 4/104 +/- 1 mm Hg) and heart rate (59 +/- 1 vs 76 +/- 2 beats/min) decreased (both p less than 0.01); LV mass remained unchanged. There were improvements in peak filling rate (end-diastolic volume/s) (2.4 +/- 0.1 vs 2.0 +/- 0.1), ejection fraction (65 +/- 1 vs 61 +/- 1%) and their ratio (stroke counts/s) (3.7 +/- 0.2 vs 3.2 +/- 0.1) (all p less than 0.05). In phase 3, blood pressure and heart rate were unchanged and reversal of LV hypertrophy was accompanied by a further increase in peak filling rate (2.9 +/- 0.1), ejection fraction (69 +/- 1%) and their ratio (4.1 +/- 0.1) compared to phase 2 (all p less than 0.01). Finally, in phase 4 blood pressure and heart rate returned to the basal value, but peak filling rate (2.7 +/- 0.1) and ejection fraction (65 +/- 1%), although reduced compared to phase 3, were still higher than phase 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "We characterized the beta-adrenergic receptors in the upper (pacemaker) and lower (nonpacemaker) regions of the rabbit renal pelvis, using radioligand binding techniques. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol was the ligand used for determining the total density of beta-adrenergic receptors. The beta-1 and beta-2 subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors were defined by inhibition of [3H]DHA binding by ICI 89,406, a beta-1 selective antagonist, and ICI 118,551, a beta-2 selective antagonist. Saturation studies with [3H]DHA showed that there was no significant difference in the equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, and the maximum number of binding sites Bmax, between the upper and lower renal pelvis. Although the inhibition constants of ICI 118,551 were smaller than those of ICI 89,406 in both the upper and lower pelvis, indicating a predominance of beta-2 receptors in both regions, the Ki values of ICI 118,551 were significantly greater in the upper than in lower pelvis. These data suggest that there are significant amounts of beta-adrenergic receptors in the rabbit renal pelvis without regional differences in the total density of beta receptors and that there is a greater proportion of beta-2 subtypes in the lower than in the upper renal pelvis.", 
    "45": "The subcellular distribution of [125I]cyanopindolol (125I-CYP) binding in membrane fractions derived from the longitudinal smooth muscle/myenteric plexus (LSM/MP) of dog ileum followed a bimodal pattern with selective enrichments in the purified synaptosomal (S2) fraction and the purified smooth muscle plasma membrane (M2) fraction. The half-maximal saturation of binding sites in both fractions occurred at 10 pM [125I]CYP with maximal binding capacities, in femtomoles per milligram of protein, 70 +/- 10 (S2 fraction) and 110 +/- 25 (M2 fraction). Approximately 80% of binding sites in either membrane fraction exhibited a high affinity for beta-2 selective antagonist ICI 118,551 (Ki = 1.4 +/- 0.4 nM in S2 and 1.8 +/- 0.6 nM in M2; mean +/- S.D. n = 3), whereas remaining 20% of binding sites had a low affinity for this agent (Ki = 2.6 +/- 1.5 microM in S2 and 0.55 +/- 0.2 microM in M2). The beta-1-selective antagonist ICI 89,406 had a high affinity for approximately 20% of binding sites (Ki = 12 +/- 7 nM in S2 and 4 +/- 2 nM in M2) and a low affinity for approximately 80% of binding sites (Ki = 0.34 +/- 0.16 microM in S2 and 0.42 +/- 0.24 microM in M2). The displacement potencies of beta-adrenergic agonists followed the order (-)-isoproterenol greater than salbutamol (-)-epinephrine greater than (-)-norepinephrine in each membrane preparation. The inclusion of 0.1 mM 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate into assay medium resulted in a decreased affinity of receptors for agonists and increased values of Hill coefficients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "The anti-ischemic properties of the new cardioselective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist celiprolol were investigated in an open study of 12 men (mean age: 58 +/- 6.6 years) with exercise-induced angina pectoris. After all previous anti-anginal medication had been withdrawn for at least 5 half-lives, the patients received placebo, single doses of nitroglycerin buccal spray, sublingual nifedipine, celiprolol alone, and then in association with nitroglycerin and nifedipine. Exercise tests were performed on a bicycle ergometer, with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Significantly more work was completed after treatment with celiprolol than at baseline (5280 +/- 2500 versus 4005 +/- 1792 kpm; P less than 0.01). There were further improvements in work completed after the addition of nitroglycerin and nifedipine. Celiprolol reduced the mean resting heart rate from a baseline value of 77.1 beats/min to 69.2 beats/min (P less than 0.01). In contrast, nifedipine induced tachycardia (82.6 beats/min). At rest, all treatments significantly reduced systolic blood pressure, but only nifedipine significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure. At the completion of the exercise protocol, celiprolol reduced the maximal systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P less than 0.05) with further decreases after the addition of nifedipine. The double product was significantly decreased by celiprolol compared with control, nitroglycerin and nifedipine. There was a further improvement of the double product after the addition of nitroglycerin to celiprolol, but the further increase after addition of nifedipine was not significant. In conclusion, it is clear that celiprolol, both alone and in combination with nitroglycerin or nifedipine, can significantly increase the work capacity of patients with exercise-induced angina pectoris and significantly reduce myocardial oxygen consumption.", 
    "47": "In an attempt to further clarify the mechanism of the maintenance of the antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, the effects of four antagonists with different ancillary properties (acebutolol, atenolol, pindolol, and propranolol) on systemic and renal hemodynamics, body fluid volumes, hormones, and lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor density were studied in four groups of 10 hypertensive patients. The patients were observed for 3 weeks during active treatment and for 2 weeks after withdrawal of treatment. At the end of the 3-week treatment period, the four drugs had an equal antihypertensive effect (fall in mean arterial pressure, 10-13%). Although renin activity was suppressed (60-70%) by all four drugs, changes in renin or pretreatment values of renin levels were not correlated with the fall in blood pressure. The drugs had no effect on plasma catecholamine concentrations or body fluid volumes. Despite similar antihypertensive effects among the four drugs, the changes in flow and resistance underlying the fall in blood pressure differed considerably. With pindolol, the fall in blood pressure was associated with a fall in vascular resistance (26 +/- 6%), whereas with propranolol, it was predominantly associated with a fall in cardiac output (11 +/- 7%). No significant changes in vascular resistance or cardiac output occurred with atenolol or acebutolol. The changes in renal blood flow and renal vascular resistance occurred in parallel with the changes in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. Plasma epinephrine concentration and pretreatment cardiac chronotropic responsiveness to isoproterenol appeared to be inversely correlated with lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor density (Bmax) (r = -0.41 and -0.43, respectively). With pindolol, Bmax decreased maximally by 39 +/- 6%, and with propranolol, it increased by 51 +/- 17%. With both drugs, significant changes in Bmax were already present 24 hours after treatment. Furthermore, 1 week after withdrawal of treatment with pindolol, Bmax was still down-regulated, and cardiac chronotropic responsiveness was still decreased, whereas 1 week after withdrawal of propranolol, Bmax was still up-regulated, and cardiac chronotropic responsiveness was still increased. No changes in Bmax occurred with the beta 1-selective antagonists acebutolol and atenolol. Thus, despite an equal antihypertensive effect, the four beta-adrenoceptor antagonists appear to have dissimilar effects on cardiac output, renal blood flow, and lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors. Changes in cardiac output, the circulating blood volume, or angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction are factors unlikely to be crucial for the antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Therefore, interference with vasoconstrictor nerve activity through blockade of either central or peripheral prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors could be an alternative explanation of their blood pressure-lowering potential.", 
    "48": "The time of acute myocardial infarction was determined in all 1,741 patients of the ISAM (Intravenous Streptokinase in Acute Myocardial Infarction) Study, based on onset of clinical symptoms and evaluation of plasma CK-MB enzyme time-activity curves. The incidence of myocardial infarction was markedly increased between 6:00 AM and 12:00 noon compared with other times of day (p less than 0.001). Myocardial infarction occurred 3.8 times more frequently between 8:00 and 9:00 AM (hour of maximum incidence) than between 12:00 midnight and 1:00 AM (hour of minimum incidence). Time of myocardial infarction based on clinical and enzymatic methods correlated well (r = 0.95). Patients with higher or lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher or lower degree of wall motion abnormalities and residual stenosis of the coronary arteries, and one-, two-, or three-vessel disease exhibited a similar circadian pattern, suggesting that the morning is a risk period for patients with mild as well as severe coronary artery disease. Only the group of patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking therapy before the event did not show an increased morning incidence of myocardial infarction. This observation may contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms by which beta-blockers reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction. Further investigation of physiologic changes occurring during the morning period of increased risk of myocardial infarction may lead to better understanding of the disorder. Design and timing of cardioprotective medication may play a crucial role in improving prevention of acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "49": "Reperfusion injury includes a spectrum of events, such as reperfusion arrhythmias, vascular damage and no-reflow, and myocardial functional stunning. The concept of reperfusion injury remains controversial with many proposed mechanisms when applied to humans, whereas in animal models, there are two main proposed mechanisms: calcium over-load and formation of oxygen free radicals. To prove that reperfusion injury is specifically caused by reperfusion would require evidence that an intervention given at the time of reperfusion can diminish or abolish the injury as in the case of arrhythmias, which are thought to be mediated by excess recycling of cytosolic calcium with delayed afterdepolarizations and ventricular automaticity. In the case of myocardial stunning, the phenomenon may be mediated, at least in part, by a burst of free radicals formed within the first minute of reperfusion and improved by free radical scavengers given at the time of reperfusion. The alternate hypothesis is that cytosolic calcium overload damages mechanisms for normal intracellular calcium regulation so that the stunned myocardium responds to agents that are thought to increase intracellular cytosolic calcium, such as beta-receptor agonists. A further component of reperfusion injury, under active investigation, is microvascular damage with alterations at the level of platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial integrity. From the therapeutic point of view, the divergent results of experimental interventions and the possibility that the abrupt onset of reperfusion in animals differs from the situation in humans with thrombolysis means that the best way currently available to limit reperfusion injury is by minimizing the ischemic period by early reperfusion and by optimizing the metabolic status of the ischemic myocardium at the end of the ischemic period.", 
    "50": "Down regulation of the beta adrenoceptor is thought to play an important role in the diminished response to catecholamines in heart failure. beta Adrenoceptor densities were measured on membrane homogenates of rat right ventricle and lymphocytes 48 h or 7 d after experimental myocardial infarction, and in rats exposed to a continuous infusion of isoprenaline (400 micrograms.kg-1.h1). The performance of the rat hearts was also evaluated 48 h post infarction in an isolated retrograde perfused heart preparation. In contrast to a 60% down regulation in right ventricle and a 20% down regulation in lymphocyte membranes after isoprenaline infusion, there was no change in right ventricle and lymphocyte beta adrenoceptor densities after myocardial infarction. Left ventricular contractile performance was significantly depressed 48 h after myocardial infarction. Mean basal left ventricular pressure decreased from 108(SEM 3) to 63(4) mm Hg while the maximal response to dobutamine was decreased from 204(4) to 105(12) mm Hg (n = 8). No correlation was found between the receptor densities of right ventricular and lymphocyte membranes. We conclude that diminished response to beta sympathomimetics after myocardial infarction cannot be attributed to a loss of surface beta adrenoceptors, and that the lymphocyte beta adrenoceptor does not provide an adequate system to monitor small receptor changes on the myocardium.", 
    "51": "The alpha 2-adrenoceptor selective agonist, [3H]guanabenz ([ 3H]GBZ), labels a unique population of binding sites in whole kidney which are not labeled by [3H]p-aminoclonidine ([3H]PAC). These binding sites are saturable and of high affinity (Kd = 10-12 nM). [3H]GBZ was not displaced from these sites by other alpha 1- or alpha 2-ligands, suggesting that they are non-adrenergic. This hypothesis is further supported by the insensitivity of renal guanabenz binding to regulation by guanyl nucleotides or to destruction by trypsin. Also, there appears to be no effect of guanabenz on the potency of isoproterenol in competing for beta-adrenoceptors in the kidney, which has been previously reported to be sensitive to clonidine. The absence of any effect of guanabenz on isoproterenol displacement of [3H]dihydroalprenolol in kidney suggests there are subtle differences in activation of alpha-receptors by clonidine and guanabenz in the kidney. In the brain, [3H]GBZ labels two binding sites. Part of the binding of [3H]GBZ in the brain is to sites essentially identical to the alpha 2-adrenoceptors labeled by [3H]PAC. The remainder of the binding resembles the non-adrenergic binding in kidney. The relationship of this unique binding site to the pharmacologic actions of guanabenz is currently not known.", 
    "52": "1. The norepinephrine (NE)-containing locus coeruleus (LC) neurons control posture as well as the gain of the vestibulospinal reflexes either through direct coeruleospinal (CS) projections or by inhibiting the dorsal pontine reticular formation (pRF) and the related medullary inhibitory reticulospinal (RS) system. The question whether these inhibitory influences on the pRF are mediated through beta-adrenoceptors was investigated by injecting in precollicular decerebrate cats small doses of the non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol in different pontine tegmental structures. 2. Injection of propranolol (usually 0.25 microliters at the concentration of 4.5 micrograms/microliters of saline) in dorsal pontine structures, which decreased the tonic contraction of limb extensors ipsilateral to the side of the injection, greatly increased the amplitude of the multiunit EMG responses of the ipsilateral triceps brachii to roll tilt of the animal at 0.15 Hz, +/- 10 degrees. Correspondingly, the response gain of the forelimb extensor to labyrinth stimulation increased. Moreover, a slight decrease in phase lead of the responses was observed. These responses were always characterized by an increased EMG activity during ipsilateral tilt and a decreased activity during contralateral tilt, as shown in the control records (alpha-responses). The same injection also produced in some instances an increase of the extensor tonus of the contralateral limbs, associated with an increased EMG activity of the contralateral triceps brachii; on the other hand, the amplitude of modulation and thus the response gain of this muscle to the same parameters of labyrinth stimulation decreased, while the response pattern reversed (beta-responses), thus being opposite to that displayed by the triceps brachii ipsilateral to the side of the injection. 3. The changes in posture and reflexes described above appeared 10-20 min after unilateral injection of propranolol in the pRF, reached in highest values in about 60-100 min and persisted for more that three hours before returning to the control level. These effects were not due to irritative phenomena following injection of the fluid, since neither changes in posture nor in the response gain of the triceps brachii to labyrinth stimulation were observed after injection of an equal volume of saline in the pRF of that side. Moreover, the magnitude of the effects increased to some extent in relation to the dose of the beta-adrenergic blocker. 4. Histological controls indicated that the structure responsible for these postural and reflex changes was located in the dorsal pontine tegmental region immediately ventral to the LC and included the peri-LC alpha and the surrounding dorsal pRF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "53": "The alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (5.0 x 10(-6) mol/L) was used to stimulate myocardial alpha-adrenoceptors of the guinea-pig ventricular papillary muscle, and changes of transmembrane action potential and contractile force of the muscle were observed. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin (5.0 x 10(-7) mol/L) and the alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocker yohimbine (5.0 x 10(-7) mol/L) were used to determine which subtype of alpha-adrenoceptor is responsible for the effects. The beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol (1.0 x 10(-6) mol/L) was used throughout the experiment. The results show that the myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation (1) increases the contractile force of the guinea-pig ventricular papillary muscle, (2) prolongs the time to peak contractile force while the duration of relaxation is not altered, (3) prolongs the fast response action potential duration, and (4) increases the maximal rate of depolarization during the phase 0 of the slow response action potential. It is suggested that the electrophysiological and positive inotropic effects of myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation might be due to the activation of the slow inward current and an increase in Ca2+ influx.",

In all species studied, alpha-receptor density in the newborn was greater than in the adult. The inotropic effect of phenylephrine was measured using the isolated arterially perfused heart preparation of rabbit and rat. The heart was stimulated electrically at 40/min. In the presence of propranolol, phenylephrine caused a significant positive inotropic effect which was significantly less in the newborn than in the adult. Since alpha-adrenergic stimulation activates protein kinase C, the inotropic effect of protein kinase C activation was studied in the rabbit and rat using phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). PMA caused a negative inotropic effect and the decrease in contractile function in the newborn was greater than in the adult. These data suggest that myocardial alpha-receptor density decreases and the positive inotropic effect of alpha-agonist increases with development. The reasons for this discrepancy remain unclear but there may be developmental differences in the signal transduction processes of alpha-stimulation. The greater negative inotropy of protein kinase C activation in the premature heart may be one of the mechanisms of the reduced inotropy of alpha-agonist in this age group.", 
    "55": "1. The positive inotropic responses of rat paced left atria to adrenaline and noradrenaline were recorded. Desmethylimipramine (DMI, 1 microM) and metanephrine (10 microM) were initially present throughout. 2. The positive chronotropic responses of spontaneously beating right atria to adrenaline were used as a reference. In these, pindolol, in increasing concentrations, caused progressive shift of the concentration-response curves to the right, which yielded a pA2 value (8.15) compatible with antagonism of beta-adrenoceptors. 3. The left atrial tension responses to adrenaline showed an initial progressive displacement by pindolol (up to 3 microM) which gave an unexpectedly low pA2 value (6.48). However, with further increases in pindolol concentration there was no additional shift of the curve. In the presence of pindolol (3 microM), prazosin (0.1 microM) displaced the curve to the right but the pA2 value derived from this shift (7.75) was less than expected for alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonism. 4. When the experiments in the presence of pindolol (3 microM) were repeated in the absence of DMI, prazosin displaced the concentration-response curves for adrenaline-induced left atrial tension to a greater extent and the pA2 value (8.76) was now compatible with adrenaline stimulating typical alpha 1-adrenoceptors. 5. The concentration-response curves for noradrenaline-induced left atrial tension were also progressively displaced to the right by pindolol (0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 microM). These concentrations yielded a Schild plot of unity slope and a pA2 value of 7.94 +/- 0.04. This was not significantly different from the pA2 value of 8.02 +/- 0.07 determined for pindolol against isoprenaline in the left atria, which indicates a normal interaction of noradrenaline with beta-adrenoceptors in the absence and presence of low concentrations of pindolol. 6. A further increase in the concentration of pindolol to 3 microM failed to induce an additional shift of the noradrenaline curves, whether a 'before and after' antagonist or a 'na\u00efve tissue' design was adopted. Similarly, the rightwards shift of the concentration-response curves by timolol reached a limit as the concentration was increased. In all cases the limit of shift occurred at a noradrenaline EC50 value of 5-10 microM. 7. At the limit of beta-adrenoceptor antagonism, prazosin and dibenamine did not displace the noradrenaline curves further. The residual inotropic response to noradrenaline therefore appeared to be mediated via neither alpha- nor beta-adrenoceptors. 8. DMI, in the absence of beta-blockade, produced the potentiation of adrenaline and noradrenaline expected of a neuronal uptake inhibitor. However, in the presence of pindolol, there was no potentiation of the right atrial rate response to adrenaline while its left atrial tension responses were antagonized. This suggested that DMI was acting as an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist. It also explained the less-than-expected shift by prazosin of the adrenaline responses in the presence of both pindolol and DMI, the latter drug already exerting some alpha-blocking activity. In contrast, the left atrial tension responses to noradrenaline in the presence of pindolol (1 microM) were neither potentiated nor antagonized by DMI. 9. When the effects of prazosin upon left atrial tension responses to noradrenaline in the presence of pindolol (10 microM) were examined in the presence of a lower concentration of DMI (O.1 microM) or cocaine (1O microM), again there was no further shift of the curve. However, when the effect of prazosin) The Macmillan Press Ltd 1989 598 K.L. WILLIAMSON & K.J. BROADLEY was examined in the absence of DMI, but in the presence of pindolol (1 and 1O microM) or timolol (3 microM), there was a small shift of the curves by prazosin (0.1 microM). This yielded pA2 values of 7.19, 7.34 +/- 0.1 and 7.66 +/- 0.09, which were at least one order of magnitude less than literature values and that obtained with adrenaline (8.76 +/- 0.18), and are not consistent with noradrenaline stimulating an alpha 1-adrenoreceptor in the presence of beta-adrenoceptor blockade, the increase in left atrial tension by noradrenaline does not appear to be mediated by beta l- or typical alpha-adrenoceptors. This is in contrast to adrenaline which in these conditions stimulates typical alpha 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "56": "The inotropic effects of isoproterenol (ISO), as well as the beta-adrenoceptors population, were measured in cardiac tissues from normal and short-term (3 days) diabetic rats. ISO increased the tension of both normal and diabetic ventricles, but the efficacy (Emax) of the concentration-response curve was greater on ventricles from diabetic rats than in those from the normal control. This phenomenon was accompanied by a decrease in the number of beta-adrenoceptor sites (Bmax) during diabetes. Insulin-treated diabetic hearts partially reversed the phenomenon. Propanolol blocked, in a competitive manner, the positive inotropic action of ISO in both types of ventricles. Inhibition of the synthesis and receptors of thromboxane (TX) reduced the hyperreactivity to ISO and increased the number of beta-adrenoceptors during diabetes, producing Bmax values almost similar to those of the normal heart. Additionally, the diabetic heart generated and released a greater amount of TXB2 than the normal heart, even in the presence or absence of ISO. The stimulatory effect of ISO upon TXB2 release was altered by the specific beta-adrenergic blockade and by verapamil. In addition, the drugs able to induce a sustained increase of endogenous cAMP also inhibited the release of TXB2 by diabetic ventricles. Exogenous TXB2 exerted the same type of hyperreactivity in diabetic ventricles. This phenomenon was accompanied by an inhibition of Na+ + K+-ATPase activity. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic inotropic stimulation is secondary to receptor-mediated hydrolysis of arachidonic acid with subsequent release of thromboxanes, which, in turn, may be responsible for both the superreactivity and the decrease in the number of beta-adrenoceptors during diabetes. The abnormal reactivity to beta-agonists also could be associated with alterations of the diabetic cardiac Na+ + K+-ATPase activity induced by TXB2 whose production is increased during diabetes.", 
    "57": "AC glioma cells, a clonal cell line derived from a rat glioma, responded to 1 mM dibutyryl-cyclic AMP and isobutylmethylxanthine with a change to stellate morphology. A concentration-related morphological change was induced by beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic agonists with the order of potency being isoproterenol greater than soterenol greater than norepinephrine. Propranolol (nonselective, beta-antagonist), butoxamine (beta 2-antagonist) and metoprolol (beta 1-antagonist) significantly decreased the cell response to isoproternol. Schild analysis of the response, using the competitive antagonist metoprolol, gave pA2 values of 7.5 and 8.5 for the agonists norepinephrine and soterenol, respectively, with slopes of the curves being less than unity. These observations indicate that both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors mediate the change in cellular morphology.", 
    "58": "The nervous system may play a role in regulation of bone metabolism. The effects of norepinephrine(NE), vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP), and ATP on cytosolic Ca2+ were assessed in a rat osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cell line (UMR-106) responsive to PTH. All three transmitters transiently increased Ca2+, with ATP much greater than PTH greater than NE = VIP, and then caused sustained increases in Ca2+. The ATP-induced transient resulted from mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ store, while NE and VIP-induced transients also involved influx of Ca2+. Later sustained increases by all agonists were dependent upon extracellular Ca2+. Release of intracellular Ca2+ by ATP was associated with a marked increase in IP3 but without a significant change in cAMP. NE, VIP, and ATP, through regulation of Ca2+ metabolism, may be involved in various osteoporotic conditions.", 
    "59": "[3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate binding of membranes of rat parotid gland were generally unchanged after 10, 15, 30, or 60 min of simultaneous electrical stimulation of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves to the gland, although stimulation of either nerve separately caused nerve-specific changes in both. Concentrations of cyclic nucleotides of the gland were, however, increased significantly from levels of the unstimulated parotid gland. Cyclic GMP showed a 10-fold increase after 10 min of stimulation, whereas only a 2-fold increase in cyclic AMP was found at this time. The increases were maintained, albeit at reduced levels, at 15 and 30 min also but by 60 min both were not different from levels of the unstimulated gland. The increases induced by separate stimulation of each nerve were greater but nerve specific, and the changes induced with simultaneous stimulation tended to reflect a reigning influence of one nerve on the other.", 
    "60": "The birth process is associated with dramatic alterations of left ventricular (LV) volume loading, pressure loading, and contractile state. The preterm LV has considerable volume loading reserve. We have assessed neuroendocrine and related hemodynamic responses of the preterm lamb LV at 0.8 gestation during acute pressure loading within the first 2-4 h after birth. We measured plasma catecholamines and hemodynamic and cineangiocardiographic parameters of LV pump performance and contractility at basal levels and during rapid LV pressure loading by partial balloon obstruction of the ascending aorta before and after propranolol. A relatively high level of propranolol (3 mg/kg) was required to produce beta-adrenoceptor blockade associated with reduction of heart rate and blood pressure, but after atrial pacing there was no detectable difference of basal LV pump performance or contractility at comparable heart rate, preload, and afterload. The LV pump performance was maintained and plasma catecholamines and LV contractility were increased when aortic systolic pressure was augmented 60% over baseline. The increased contractile state at greater afterload was minimally blunted by propranolol. Thus the preterm LV is relatively hypercontractile soon after birth and is capable of an integrated augmentation of pump performance and contractile state during pressure loading. These findings are relevant to the maintenance of adequate LV performance and successful adaptation to the acute alterations of afterload associated with the transitional circulation at birth.",

Both membranes specifically bound the ligand, with the epithelial membranes exhibiting a greater number of higher affinity sites. This is the first demonstration of lens beta-adrenergic receptors using this type of assay and the first direct demonstration of beta-adrenergic receptors in lens fiber cells.", 
    "62": "Dilevalol, an agent that combines nonselective beta-blocking and beta 2-mediated vasodilating properties, was compared with placebo in 16 subjects with moderate hypertension in a double-blind crossover study. Dilevalol or a placebo was administered intravenously in bolus injections of 25, 50, and 50 mg at 15-minute intervals. Fifteen minutes after a cumulative dose of 125 mg, the blood pressure was lowered by 11/9 mm Hg, compared with 2/1 mm Hg after placebo (p less than 0.01 between groups for systolic and diastolic blood pressure), an effect that persisted for at least 105 minutes. Standing systolic blood pressure was also lowered in dilevalol-treated patients without orthostatic symptoms. No significant effects on heart rate were noted. Fifteen minutes after the last dose of dilevalol, plasma norepinephrine levels increased from a baseline of 200 +/- 24 to 495 +/- 44 pg/ml (p less than 0.01), compared with a nonsignificant rise from 262 +/- 21 to 306 +/- 28 pg/ml with placebo vehicle. Dilevalol also increased alpha-human atrial natriuretic factor by 5.4 pg/ml, compared with 0.5 pg/ml after placebo (p less than 0.01 between groups). Plasma renin activity and plasma epinephrine, aldosterone, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels were unchanged by dilevalol. There were no significant adverse effects with dilevalol administration. Compared with placebo, dilevalol given intravenously appears to be safe and effective antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "63": "The incorporation of 32Pi into phospholamban, troponin I, phosphatidylinositols, and inositol trisphosphates was studied in Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts stimulated with isoproterenol. Hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing [32P]Pk and freeze-clamped at different times during the positive inotropic response. Exposure of the hearts to 0.1 microM isoproterenol for up to 1 minute was associated with significant (up to threefold) increases in phospholamban and troponin I phosphorylation, but there was no significant increase in 32P incorporation into phospholipids. However, longer exposure (2 minutes or more) to isoproterenol was associated with increases in the degree of 32P labeling of phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acid. Examination of 32P labeling of inositol trisphosphates in the same hearts revealed that the radioactivity associated with these compounds decreased with time. The decreases were significant at times of exposure of 2 minutes or longer to beta-adrenergic stimulation. The tissue levels of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate isoform were also measured in hearts perfused with isoproterenol for 3 minutes, and they were found to be significantly lower compared with values obtained in control hearts. The effects of isoproterenol on 32P incorporation into phospholipids and proteins were observed in the presence of prazosin, and they were completely abolished by the beta-receptor blocker propranolol. Examination of the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity in the perfused hearts revealed that isoproterenol stimulation was associated with a decrease in the membrane-associated enzymatic activity at physiological calcium concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "The mechanism of propranolol-inhibited sarcolemmal membrane lipid peroxidation was investigated by electron spin resonance spin-trapping technique using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) and 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (MNP). Highly purified canine myocytic sarcolemma were peroxidized by a superoxide-driven (from dihydroxyfumarate) and Fe3+-catalyzed free radical-generating system. Hydroxyl radicals (.OH), identified by electron spin resonance signals as DMPO-OH adducts, were generated in the aqueous phase. Propranolol up to 500 microM did not effectively reduce the intensity of the DMPO-OH adducts. When the sarcolemma were incubated with MNP before the addition of free radicals, MNP adducts characteristic of carbon-centered radicals were produced. Pretreatment of the membranes with propranolol (3-100 microM) decreased the intensity of the MNP adducts in a log concentration-dependent manner; the EC50 is about 7 microM. D- and L-propranolol were found equally effective. When protein-depleted sarcolemmal lipids were similarly incubated with MNP and the free radical system, identical MNP adducts were observed; this finding suggests that the adducts were lipid-derived products arising from lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, their formation was also inhibited by propranolol pretreatment. Since propranolol is not an effective scavenger of oxygen radicals in the aqueous phase, the data suggest that the antiperoxidative effect of propranolol is due to its lipophilic interaction with the membrane and thus subsequent interruption of the free radical chain reactions.", 
    "65": "The beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor populations in rat cortex were individually quantified by labelling all of the receptors with [3H]dihydroalprenolol and displacing with isoprenaline (200 microM) or CGP 20712A (1-(2-[(3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxy)phenoxy]ethylamino)-3-[4-(1-methyl-4- trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)phenoxy]-2-propanol methanesulphonate; 100 nM) to define total beta-adrenoceptors and beta 1-adrenoceptors, respectively. Binding parameters for beta 2-adrenoceptors were calculated by the difference. Oral administration of the monoamine reuptake inhibitors sibutramine HCl (3 mg/kg), amitriptyline (10 mg/kg), desipramine (10 mg/kg), or zimeldine (10 mg/kg) for 10 days decreased the total number of beta-adrenoceptors present in rat cortex. This effect was entirely due to a reduction in the number of beta 1-adrenoceptors. Similarly, 10 days of treatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine (10 mg/kg p.o.) or five electroconvulsive shocks (ECSs; 200 V, 2 s) spread over this period also down-regulated beta-adrenoceptors by reducing the content of the beta 1-subtype. By contrast, treatment with clenbuterol (5 mg/kg p.o.) for 10 days reduced the number of cortical beta-adrenoceptors by an effect on the beta 2-adrenoceptor population. The effects of short-term treatment with these drugs were also investigated, and, using the doses shown above, the results of 3 days of administration or a single ECS were determined. Sibutramine HCl and desipramine were alone in producing a reduction in number of beta-adrenoceptors after 3 days. Once again, this was exclusively due to a loss of beta 1-adrenoceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "This study compared the antihypertensive effects and the haemodynamic mechanisms of action of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, a beta-blocker and the combination of both in patients with mild to severe hypertension. After a placebo run-in period of 2 weeks, patients were treated for 3 weeks with each of the following: cilazapril (2.5 mg daily) and propranolol (120 mg daily), in a randomized sequence, and thereafter a combination of the two drugs. Blood pressure, cardiac output (measured by Doppler ultrasound) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) in a sitting position at rest were determined. One patient out of 18 was withdrawn in the cilazapril phase. Both monotherapies yielded significant and similar reductions of diastolic blood pressure (average -10 mmHg). Cardiac output and TPR showed opposite effects. Cardiac output was lower with the beta-blocker than with the ACE inhibitor (3.4 versus 4.5 l.min-1), while TPR behaved conversely (2646 versus 2005 dyne.s.cm-5). The combination of both drugs lowered diastolic blood pressure significantly more than the monotherapies (average -20 mmHg); the haemodynamic effects of the monotherapies were attenuated by the combination (cardiac output = 3.7 l.min-1; TPR = 2170 dyne.s.cm-5). A sitting diastolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 90 mmHg could be achieved in six out of 17 patients with propranolol alone, in eight out of 18 with cilazapril alone, and in 14 out of 17 with the coadministration of both drugs. The combination was better tolerated subjectively than the beta-blocker alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "A liquid chromatographic method using electrochemical detection is described for the assay of brain concentrations of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), centrally acting serotonin agonists selective for the 5HT-1A subtype of serotonin receptors. The method is sensitive to approximately 5 ng/g concentrations. After a 1mg/kg s.c. dose of 8-OH-DPAT in rats, its concentration in whole brain declined rapidly during the first 4 hr with a half-life of 26 min. At 30 min after a 1 mg/kg s.c. dose of 8-OH-DPAT, concentrations were approximately equal in hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum and brain stem but were slightly lower in midbrain. 8-OH-DPAT disappeared from hypothalamus, midbrain and hippocampus at similar rates during the first 90 min after a 1 mg/kg s.c dose. Concentrations of 8-OH-DPAT in whole brain were markedly higher after s.c. than after i.p. administration of 8-OH-DPAT, consistent with earlier data showing 8-OH-DPAT to be more potent when given s.c. than when given i.p. in decreasing brain concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Pretreatment with proadifen (SKF-525A), an inhibitor of microsomal drug metabolism, slightly increased brain concentrations of 8-OH-DPAT. Pindolol, which antagonized the elevation of serum corticosterone concentration by 8-OH-DPAT, did not alter brain concentrations of 8-OH-DPAT. The analytical method should be useful in correlating brain concentrations of 8-OH-DPAT with various neurochemical, behavioral or other functional effects that have been described for this compound.", 
    "68": "The hypothesis tested in this study was that beta-adrenergic stimulation is responsible for the inhibition of fetal lung liquid production during moderate fetal asphyxia. In chronically catheterized fetal sheep, net lung liquid production rates were measured over three consecutive periods: a control period, a period of reduced uterine blood flow (RUBF) or epinephrine infusion, and periods of RUBF or epinephrine infusion in the presence of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol. The net production rate of fetal lung liquid was decreased from a mean control value of 7.7 +/- 1.0 to 1.5 +/- 0.4 ml/h (P less than 0.001) by RUBF; the administration of propranolol had no further effect on these liquid production rates (1.1 +/- 0.5 ml/h). In other experiments epinephrine infusion reduced the net production rate of fetal lung liquid from a mean control value of 7.2 +/- 1.4 to 1.7 +/- 1.8 ml/h (P less than 0.025); the addition of propranolol reversed this inhibition (secretion rate 6.1 +/- 1.4 ml/h, P less than 0.005). We conclude that the inhibition of fetal lung liquid production induced by moderate fetal asphyxia does not solely result from catecholamine stimulation of pulmonary beta-receptors.",

    "70": "Since beta-blockers could affect lipid levels at the therapeutic dose range in hypertensive patients, a parallel 6-month randomized trial with pindolol (PDL) (16 pts.) and propranolol (PPL) (23 pts.) was designed (mean age = 55 + 7.1 years and 57 + 8.0 years; 9 males, 7 females and 15 males, 8 females, respectively). Total cholesterol, LDL and HDL fractions, and triglycerides (TGs) were determined before (washout phase) and during 1, 3, and 6 months of therapy. Patients were instructed to maintain their usual dietary habits. Daily drug doses were adjusted step by step to attain an optimal hypotensive effect (PDL 15-45 mg, PPL 180-240 mg). In the PPL-treated group, total cholesterol and LDL did not change significantly, HDL decreased (from 45.2 to 40.5 mg/dl, p less than 0.05) and TG increased (from 133 to 169 mg/dl, p less than 0.05). In the PDL group total cholesterol and LDL did not change either, but HDL increased (35.9 to 44.7 mg/dl, p less than 0.01) and TGs, were reduced (from 169 to 131 mg/dl, p less than 0.05). No dose-effect relationship was recorded. It is concluded that pindolol does not negatively influence HDL nor the TG blood lipid profile as does PPL. Accordingly, pindolol might be preferred to propranolol in the treatment of hypertensive patients with an unfavorable lipid profile, but this assumption remains to be proven in larger, prospective, long-term followup trials.", 
    "71": "Class III antiarrhythmic agents may prolong refractoriness via modulation of ion channels, which may be sensitive to Ca2+ regulatory proteins or enzymes. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to quantitate the effects of several structurally diverse class III antiarrhythmic agents on calmodulin-regulated enzymes and protein kinase C activity, and to evaluate the ability of these agents and known calmodulin antagonists to prolong cardiac refractoriness in vivo. The rank order of potency (IC50;microM) of selected class III antiarrhythmic agents and reference calmodulin antagonists as inhibitors of calmodulin-regulated phosphodiesterase activity were: calmidazolium (0.12 microM) greater than amiodarone (0.62 microM) greater than desethylamiodarone (1.5 microM) greater than trifluoperazine (4.3 microM), bepridil (5 microM) greater than W-7 (7.5 microM), clofilium (13 microM). Similar concentration-related inhibition was evident in a second calmodulin-regulated system, inhibition of myosin light-chain phosphorylation and superprecipitation of arterial actomyosin. Sotalol and tetraethylammonium were inactive at 100 microM. Protein kinase C activity was also inhibited by some of these agents; desethylamiodarone (IC50 = 11 microM) was more potent than the reference agent, H-7 (IC50 = 79 microM), or amiodarone (38% inhibition at 100 microM) and clofilium (32% inhibition at 100 microM). In vivo, the minimally effective doses required to increase ventricular effective refractory periods in paced guinea pigs were (in mg/kg) bepridil, sotalol [1] greater than clofilium [3] greater than amiodarone [10] greater than W-7, desethylamiodarone [20]. No changes in refractory period were noted with maximum testable doses of calmidazolium or trifluoperazine. These studies show that some, but not all, class III antiarrhythmic agents are effective and potent calmodulin antagonists or protein kinase C inhibitors. Moreover, some calmodulin antagonists are effective at prolonging refractoriness in vivo. However, a lack of correlation between these agents suggests that these mechanisms are not solely responsible for the prolongation of refractoriness of all class III agents.", 
    "72": "The calcium channel activator BAY-K 8644 injected intravenously produces a significant rise in the calcitonin content of the thyroid. Because adrenalin and noradrenaline play a certain role in the regulation of ionic calcium channels and in the preservation of the secretory tonus of the calcitonin secreting C cells, the effect of BAY-K 8644 was followed-up in adrenalectomized animals and in animals in which propranolol was previously administered. Adrenalectomy of beta receptor blocking does not prevent the effect of BAY-K 8644 on the activation of calcium channels, the calcitonin secretion being stimulated in these conditions too. The data obtained stress the relative independence of the calcium channels or the beta-adrenergic stimulating system in the achievement of calcium ion transfer. However, the calcitonin levels obtained were lower in adrenalectomized animals or following propranolol after stimulation with BAY-K 8644 in those with intact sympatho-adrenergic tonus. This stresses the importance of the integrity of the beta receptors in the activation of the calcium channels.", 
    "73": "1. In the rat aortic ring with endothelium, suspended in a K+-free salt solution containing 1.25 mM Ca2+, the concentration-response curve to K+ (2-50 mM) was characterized by an initial small contractile phase occurring at 2-5 mM (Emax 1 = 0.67 +/- 0.18 g, n = 9) followed by a plateau (4-8 mM) and then a secondary contractile response (Emax2 = 1.64 +/- 0.13 g). 2. (-)-Bay k 8644 (0.01-0.3 microM) increased greatly the maximum of the first and only slightly that of the second contractile phase to K+. 3. In preparations treated with 0.3 microM (-)-Bay k 8644, only the contractile responses to low concentrations of K+ were inhibited by RP 49356 (0.1-1.0 microM), cromakalim (0.1-1.0 microM), nicorandil (1-10 microM), minoxidil sulphate (10 microM) or HA 1004 (1 microM). 4. In contrast, nitrendipine (0.01-0.1 microM) and diltiazem (1.0 microM) inhibited contractile responses to all concentrations of K+, whereas bucindolol (3 microM), dihydralazine (100 microM) and cinnarizine (1.0 microM) depressed only the second phase of the K+ concentration-response curve. 5. These results indicate that the enhancement by (-)-Bay k 8644 of the contractile response to low K+ (2-10 mM) is possibly due to activation of voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCs). The inhibition by purported K+ channel activators (cromakalim, RP 49356, nicorandil, minoxidil sulphate) of these contractions is compatible with membrane hyperpolarization mediated by an increase in outward K+ current. This mechanism would lead to VOC closure and therefore a fall in free cytosolic Ca2+. 6. Thus, the determination of the effects of myorelaxant agents on the concentration-response curve to K+ in the presence of (-)-Bay k 8644, is a novel and simple functional approach to the discrimination quantitatively and qualitatively of activators of K+ channels from other classes of compounds (such as calcium entry blockers) or vasodilators with an as yet undetermined cellular mechanism (e.g. bucindolol).", 
    "74": "The effects of long-term beta-adrenoceptor stimulation or inhibition on parotid and submandibular glands, saliva secretion, and caries development were studied. Groups of rats were treated daily with: 0.5 or 5 mg/kg body weight of isoproterenol (IPR), 0.5 or 5 mg/kg bw propranolol (PRO), or saline. After 42 days, saliva was collected and analyzed for secretion rate, total protein, amylase, sialic acid and electrolytes. Total protein and amylase in saliva decreased and potassium increased in the high IPR group. Phosphate increased in both IPR groups and decreased in the high PRO group. The average weight of parotid glands increased 3.7 times in the high IPR group and 1.8 times in the low IPR group. Amylase and total protein in parotid gland extracts decreased in both IPR groups. The submandibular gland weight increased 1.5 times in the high IPR group. Total protein decreased in the high IPR group. There was no difference in caries development.", 
    "75": "The chronotropic effect of Bay K 8644, a dihydropyridine known to increase the slow inward current, was studied in spontaneously beating rat atria. Increases in atrial rate were concentration-dependent and the maximal increase (106 +/- 10 beats/min) was obtained at 3 x 10(-6) mol/l. Reserpine pretreatment, or propranolol 3 x 10(-7) mol/l, or propranolol plus prazosin 10(-6) mol/l decreased the maximum chronotropic effect of Bay K 8644 by about 60%. Blockade of the removal mechanisms of catecholamines (hydrocortisone 3 x 10(-5) mol/l plus cocaine 10(-5) mol/l) did not prevent the chronotropic effect of the compound. Exposure to Bay K 8644 increased the spontaneous outflow of tritium from atria preloaded with [3H]-norepinephrine by 30%. The results indicate that Bay K 8644 produces positive chronotropic effects through two mechanisms: a direct one and an indirect mechanism that involves the participation of norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerve endings.", 
    "76": "To clarify the hemodynamic effects of verapamil, we investigated in normal volunteers the effects of 4-day treatment with verapamil (240 mg/day) on left ventricular function and on systemic and brachial artery haemodynamics, in comparison with the effects of placebo and atenolol (100 mg/day). Left ventricular structure and function was evaluated by echocardiography, systemic hemodynamics were assessed by pulsed Doppler velocimetry of the ascending aorta, and brachial artery hemodynamics were assessed pulsed Doppler velocimetry of the brachial artery. Verapamil decreased systemic and brachial artery vascular resistance (p less than 0.05), increased cardiac output (CO, p less than 0.01) and brachial flow (p = 0.054), and did not affect blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). In contrast, atenolol decreased BP, HR, and CO (p less than 0.001) but did not significantly affect brachial flow and systemic and brachial artery vascular resistance. We conclude that short-term administration of verapamil in normal humans produces systemic and brachial artery vasodilatation, with a reflex increase of stroke volume but not of HR.", 
    "77": "The role of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors (adrenoceptors) on cardiac contractility was investigated in human subjects. The effect of methoxamine, a selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, and angiotensin II, on cardiac contractility was determined by means of noninvasive assessment of the slope of the end-systolic pressure (ESP)/end-systolic dimension (ESD) relationship. The slope (m) of this ratio was significantly higher with methoxamine (17.0; SD = 9.0 mm Hg/mm) than with angiotensin II (4.8; SD = 1.9 mm Hg/mm) (p less than 0.05). Slopes with methoxamine were higher when heart rates (HRs) were reflexly reduced, and were significantly diminished when reflex bradycardia was prevented by atropine (p less than 0.05) or atrial pacing (p less than 0.01). Previous treatment with propranolol did not modify m values with methoxamine (m = 15.5; SD = 4.4 mm Hg/mm). Phentolamine, given at peak methoxamine effect, did not consistently modify m values, resulting in an average slope not significantly different from that obtained with methoxamine alone. However, the addition of phentolamine did not cause an increase in ESDs at each level of ESP with respect to methoxamine. In the same subjects, infusion of phentolamine after angiotensin did not modify ESDs at comparable ESP levels. These findings suggest the existence of a positive inotropic effect mediated by alpha 1 adrenoceptors in the intact human heart.", 
    "78": "Propafenone (Pf) is a class I antiarrhythmic drug that can be given both orally and intravenously. In order to examine whether its two major metabolites [5-hydroxypropafenone (5-OH-Pf) and N-depropylpropafenone (N-DP-Pf)] possess pharmacodynamical properties, we compared their electrophysiological effects to those of the parent drug on papillary muscle fibers from guinea pig ventricular myocardium. After baseline action potential and refractory period characteristics were measured at different pacing rates, the tissue preparations were superfused with either Pf, 5-OH-Pf, or N-DP-Pf at five different concentrations and electrophysiological characteristics were studied again. The maximal rate of depolarization (Vmax) was depressed by the three compounds only at the highest concentration, although the effect of N-DP-Pf was slightly less than the other two. Refractory periods were altered only by the highest concentration of 5-OH-Pf. Propafenone and N-DP-Pf exhibited equally slow on-set/off-set kinetics of the sodium channel block, whereas those of 5-OH-Pf were twice as long, which seems to suggest a slower rate of dissociation of the latter from the inactivated sodium channels. Thus, 5-OH-Pf and N-DP-Pf comply with the definition of the class IC antiarrhythmic drugs. The cumulative in vivo effects of the two metabolites and of the parent drug could have far reaching clinical implications, especially in the genetically predisposed extensive metabolizing subject.", 
    "79": "The results of the present study show that the reduction of the total number of beta adrenoceptors affected the beta 1-adrenoceptor subpopulation, whereas the beta 2 adrenoceptors were not detectably altered in the failing heart. Dopexamine had a 9.8-fold greater affinity to beta 2 adrenoceptors than to beta 1 adrenoceptors. In nonfailing myocardium, dopexamine increased force of contraction concentration-dependently. However, dopexamine alone had no effect in papillary muscle strips from moderately (NYHA II-III) and severely (NYHA IV) failing myocardium. However, in the presence of milrinone, it concentration-dependently increased force of contraction. Under this condition, the effectiveness was slightly less pronounced in NYHA IV than in NYHA II-III. Dopexamine concentration-dependently stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Experiments with the beta 1-selective antagonist CGP 207.12 A and the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118.551 showed that both stimulation of adenylate cyclase and the increase of force of contraction are mediated by beta 2 adrenoceptors. It is concluded that although the number of beta 2 adrenoceptors is preserved in the failing myocardium, dopexamine alone does not increase force of contraction. However, the positive inotropic effect of dopexamine, which is observed in the presence of milrinone and the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by dopexamine are mediated by beta 2 adrenoceptors. Therefore, beta 2 adrenoceptors exist in the human myocardium, are coupled to adenylate cyclase, and are capable of increasing force of contraction. These results provide evidence for an impaired coupling of beta 2 adrenoceptors to mechanisms beyond receptor occupation in terminal heart failure.", 
    "80": "The effects of TA-064 (TA) on \"fast\" and \"slow\" response action potentials and contractile tensions were studied in isolated guinea pig papillary muscles, and the findings were compared with those of isoproterenol (ISP) and ouabain. The results are as follows: (a) TA produced a dose-dependent (10(-7)-10(-5) M) increase in developed tension, with no significant changes in the resting membrane potential (RMP), action potential duration (APD), and maximum rate of rise of action potential (Vmax). (b) The concentration required to increase the developed tension by threefold (\"equivalent concentration\") were 10(-6) M with both TA and ouabain, while that of ISP was 5 x 10(-8) M. (c) TA increased the maximum rate of rise, dP/dtmax, and the maximum rate of fall, dR/dtmax, of the developed tension to the same extent, unlike those of ISP and ouabain. (d) Positive inotropic effects of TA (10(-7)-10(-5) M) were not completely abolished by atenolol (3.8 x 10(-5) M), a specific beta 1 blocker, whereas those of ISP were completely abolished. (e) The increasing effects of \"equivalent concentration\" of TA (10(-6) M) on the Vmax of the slow response were less than those of ISP (5 x 10(-8) M). These results suggest that the positive inotropic effects of TA are mainly due to stimulation of beta 1 adrenoceptors, but that the mode of action of the drug differs in several respects from that of ISP or ouabain.", 
    "81": "1. We studied the effect of electrically stimulating the locus coeruleus (LC) and iontophoresing noradrenergic antagonists on visual responses and spontaneous activity of individual cells in the cat primary visual cortex. 2. A bilateral projection from LC to visual cortex was demonstrated anatomically, by retrograde labeling using horseradish peroxidase. Where electrical stimulation of both ipsilateral and contralateral LC affected a cortical neuron, the effect induced by stimulating each side was similar. 3. One hundred and two cells were recorded in area 17: 52% of them had their activity suppressed and 36% had their activity facilitated by LC stimulation. The suppressive effect was predominant in cortical layers II + III and IV, whereas most cells in layer V and one-half of the cells in layer VI were facilitated by LC stimulation. This suggests that LC neurons innervate each cortical layer in a different manner. 4. Simple and complex cells were equally sensitive to LC stimulation. For simple cells, the suppressive effect of LC stimulation was dominant throughout all layers. For complex cells, the suppressive effect was dominant in layers II + III and IV, whereas the facilitatory effect was dominant in layers V and VI. 5. The suppressive effect of LC stimulation was blocked by iontophoretic application of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists and the facilitatory effect was blocked by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists. 6. Nonselective alpha-, and selective alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptor antagonists suppressed visual and spontaneous activity in almost all neurons tested, suggesting that these receptors are either facilitatory at a postsynaptic site or inhibitory at a site presynaptic to an inhibitory synapse in the visual cortex. 7. beta-Receptor antagonists facilitated activity in 45% and suppressed activity in 36% of the cells tested, suggesting there are both suppressive and facilitatory types of beta-receptors. 8. The effectiveness of alpha- and beta-antagonists on the activity of neurons without LC stimulation also suggested that spontaneously released noradrenaline activated noradrenergic receptors in the visual cortex even in the anesthetized and paralyzed cat. 9. In most cells tested, both alpha- and beta-receptor antagonists exerted effects on single neurons suggesting that endogenous noradrenaline acts on both alpha- and beta-receptors on the same cell. 10. The activation of LC did not improve the signal- (visual response)to-noise (spontaneous discharge) ratio of neurons in the visual cortex. 11. LC seemed to control the activity of each cortical layer differently, by activating different kinds of noradrenergic receptors in different layers.", 
    "82": "A monoclonal antibody was raised against the affinity purified beta 1-adrenergic receptor from turkey erythrocytes. This antibody, B120, of the IgG1 isotype, precipitates the photoaffinity-labeled purified receptor and the corresponding binding activity. The antibody recognizes the 42 kDa component of the receptor of erythrocyte membranes, after electrotransfer on nitrocellulose. B120 does not inhibit binding of dihydroalprenolol on membranes and has no effect on the activity of adenylate cyclase. Since specific immunofluorescence was detected only after ethanol treatment of the erythrocytes, the epitope recognized by B120 appears not to be accessible at the cell surface.", 
    "83": "Phosphate uptake by proximal renal cells derived from the human kidney occurs by a saturable process that is approximately 85% dependent on the presence of sodium. Kinetic analysis is consistent with two distinct transport events with Km of 0.08 and 0.63 mM and Vmax of 3.4 and 11.0 nmol.mg-1.3 min-1, respectively. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), isoproterenol, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) increased cellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP). PTH-stimulated cAMP prevented binding of the photolabel 8-azido[32P]cAMP with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 1 nM PTH, 30-fold lower than the EC50 for intracellular cAMP accumulation. These data are qualitatively similar to those observed in OK cells. PTH did not inhibit phosphate uptake in human cells, although it activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase and increased cytosolic calcium. Thus phosphate uptake in human proximal renal cells maintained in short-term culture is unresponsive to PTH in spite of increased cytosolic calcium and activation of the cAMP pathway.", 
    "84": "The effects of insulin and norepinephrine on glucose transport, glucose uptake, and cell respiration were investigated in isolated rat brown adipocytes. Glucose transport and uptake were determined using [U-14C]-D-glucose and 2-deoxy-[1,2-3H]-D-glucose, respectively. Brown adipocyte respiration was measured polarographically. Dose-response experiments revealed that insulin stimulated D-glucose transport and 2-deoxyglucose uptake between 10(-11) and 10(-7) M with a maximal four- to sixfold stimulation. In the absence of insulin, norepinephrine concentrations ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-7) M also enhanced glucose transport and uptake with a maximal two- to fourfold stimulation. Experiments with alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists showed that the effect of norepinephrine was predominantly mediated via beta-adrenergic pathways. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine also increased glucose transport, suggesting that the effects of norepinephrine are cyclic AMP dependent. Moreover, norepinephrine (10(-8) M) enhanced insulin sensitivity for glucose transport [half-maximum velocity constant (1/2 V max)] but failed to potentiate insulin responsiveness (Vmax). On the other hand, insulin (10(-9) M) had no effect on basal respiration but rapidly inhibited the calorigenic effect of norepinephrine (10(-7) M) by greater than 50%. These results demonstrate that 1) in the absence of insulin, physiological concentrations of norepinephrine stimulate glucose transport via beta-adrenergic pathways, 2) the neurohormone synergistically potentiates brown adipocyte submaximal insulin responses for glucose transport, and 3) insulin counteracts the effects of norepinephrine on brown adipocyte thermogenesis despite the fact that both hormones enhance glucose uptake.", 
    "85": "Rat parotid acinar cells were employed to investigate the mechanism by which receptor agonists that activate the phosphoinositide pathway enhance the stimulatory effects of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) on amylase secretion. Norepinephrine (NE), which activates both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, evoked a secretory response that was greater than the sum of the responses obtained when NE was employed as a beta-agonist (in the presence of prazosin) and as an alpha-agonist (in the presence of propranolol). The enhancement of amylase secretion induced by NE was accompanied by an augmented rise in Ca2+ influx, as determined by fura-2 analysis. NE-induced cAMP production was comparable to that evoked by NE as a beta-agonist, and the accumulation of [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) evoked by NE was comparable to that elicited by NE as an alpha-agonist. The beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol potentiated the rise in cytosolic Ca2+ elicited by the muscarinic agonist carbachol, while possessing no stimulatory effect of its own. Isoproterenol had no effect on carbachol-induced stimulation of [3H]IP3 or 1,3,4,5-[3H]inositol tetrakisphosphate accumulation. Ionomycin and dibutyryl cAMP in combination produced a similar enhancing effect on the Ca2+ signal and amylase release as adrenergic and muscarinic receptor agonists. These results suggest that the synergism between the phosphoinositide and cAMP-signaling systems in parotid cells resides in enhanced Ca2+ availability.", 
    "86": "We used kainic acid-lesioned hippocampal slices to examine glial responses to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in a neuron-free environment. Slices were prepared from rats which received intracerebroventricular injections of kainic acid 1 month prior to experiments. Astrocytes (membrane potential averaged 81.4 +/- 5.5 mV; n = 46; mean +/- SD) were impaled in the CA3 region of the slice, which was completely depleted of neurons. GABA (1 mM) application by bath perfusion depolarized membrane potential from 1 to 5 mV. The GABA-induced depolarization was not affected by a tetrodotoxin (1 microM)/high-Mg2+/low-Ca2+ solution. Changing the Cl- equilibrium potential by reducing extracellular Cl- greatly increased the GABA-induced depolarization. Muscimol mimicked the GABA response, while picrotoxin (0.1 mM), an antagonist of the GABA-activated Cl- channel, resulted in a 60% blockade. The barbiturate, pentobarbital (0.1 mM), and the benzodiazepine agonist, flunitrazepam (1 mM), enhanced the depolarization by 60 and 40%, respectively. A blocker of glial GABA uptake, beta-alanine (1 mM), did not affect the GABA-induced membrane depolarization, indicating that the depolarization is not caused by electrogenic uptake of the amino acid. The pharmacological properties of the GABA response of astrocytes from the hippocampal slice is similar to that previously described for cultured astrocytes from rat cerebral hemispheres. Our data suggest that GABA receptors, which are coupled to Cl- channels, are also expressed by astrocytes in an intact tissue.", 
    "87": "A normal-phase chromatographic method for the determination of (R)- and (S)-propranolol in plasma is described. The chiral separation is performed by adding an optically active complexing agent, N-benzoxycarbonylglycyl-L-proline, to the mobile phase (dichloromethane). The solid phase is LiChrosorb DIOL. After adjustment of the pH of the plasma, the propranolol enantiomers are extracted into hexane-dichloromethane-n-butanol (72:18:10). The organic phase is evaporated and the residue dissolved in the mobile phase before injection on to the column. Quantifications are performed by using internal standardization, giving a precision of better than 2% (coefficient of variation). The method employs 1-ml plasma samples and has linear calibration graphs (r = 0.999) over the concentration range studied, 9.2-288 nmol/l. injections of sample solutions with a composition different from that of the mobile phase gave system peaks that might affect the shape of the solute peaks. Several possibilities for avoiding these disturbing system peaks in the chromatogram by changing the mobile phase composition are discussed.", 
    "88": "After the injection of DDAVP in 39 non-anaesthetized dogs (0.4 micrograms/kg) factor VIII:C activity rose to 145% of baseline values (p less than 0.0001) and the fibrinolytic potential of euglobulin precipitate rose to 196% (p less than 0.0001). The injection of DDAVP was repeated three times in each dog of a group of good responder animals at weekly intervals, but after: A) Pentobarbital anesthesia (30 mg/kg)--the increase of factor VIII:C was reduced from 164% to 116% (n = 11; p less than 0.0005) and the increase in fibrinolytic activity was reduced from 270% to 192% (n = 11; p less than 0.05). B) Injection of propranolol (1 mg/kg)--the increase of factor VIII:C was reduced from 167% to 110% (n = 13; p less than 0.0005) and there was no significant decrease of fibrinolytic activity (n = 13; n.s.) C) Splenectomy--the increase of factor VIII:C was reduced from 166% to 122% (n = 10; p less than 0.0005) and fibrinolytic activity was not significantly changed from 196% to 256% (n = 9; n.s.). There were no statistically significant differences in the increases of factor VIII:C and fibrinolytic potential of euglobulin precipitate after repeating only the injection of DDAVP three times in the same animal at weekly intervals (n = 5; n.s.). We conclude that the increases in factor VIII:C and fibrinolytic activities observed after DDAVP infusion in the dog are due to different mechanisms of action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "89": "This paper examines the pattern of drug treatment of hypertension in Auckland in the period 1982 to 1987 using data from a representative sample of the adult population interviewed in 1982 and followed up in 1987. In 1982 the age standardised prevalence of antihypertensive treatment for people aged 40-64 years was 12.2% (95%Cl 10.4, 14.0) and in 1987 it was 10.2% (95%Cl 8.5, 11.8). Over the five year period of this study, 6% of the sample untreated in 1982 began treatment with antihypertensive medication, while 24% of those on drugs in 1982 had stopped treatment by 1987. The most common medications used in both 1982 and 1987 for hypertension were diuretics and beta blockers. Over the five year period diuretic use fell and beta blocker use remained constant. In 1982 3% of hypertensives were taking a calcium antagonist but in 1987 13% were on these drugs and a further 13% were using ACE inhibitors. This study suggests that the prevalence of drug treatment for hypertension has plateaued in New Zealand; coincidentally there is a trend towards use of more expensive drugs."
