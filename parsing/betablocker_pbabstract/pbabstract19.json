    "0": "Arrhythmias are common in horses. Some, such as frequent atrial or ventricular premature beats, may require long-term anti-arrhythmic therapy. In humans and small animals, sotalol hydrochloride (STL) is often used for chronic oral anti-arrhythmic therapy. STL prolongs repolarization and the effective refractory period in all cardiac tissues. No information on STL pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics in horses is available and the aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intravenously (IV) and orally (PO) administered STL and the effects on surface electrocardiogram and left ventricular systolic function. Six healthy horses were given 1\u2009mg STL/kg bodyweight either IV or PO. Blood samples to determine plasma STL concentrations were taken before and at several time points after STL administration. Electrocardiography and echocardiography were performed at different time points before and after IV STL administration. Mean peak plasma concentrations after IV and PO administration of STL were 1624\u2009ng/mL and 317\u2009ng/mL, respectively. The oral bioavailability was intermediate (48%) with maximal absorption after 0.94\u2009h, a moderate distribution and a mean elimination half-life of 15.24\u2009h. After IV administration, there was a significant increase in QT interval, but no significant changes in other electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters. Transient transpiration was observed after IV administration, but no adverse effects were noted after a single oral dose of 1\u2009mg/kg STL in any of the horses. It was concluded that STL has an intermediate oral bioavailability in the horse and might be useful in the treatment of equine arrhythmias.", 
    "1": "We aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on preventing atrial fibrillation in essential hypertensive patients. Systematic literature retrieval was carried out to obtain randomized controlled trials on the effects of ACEI/ARBs on essential hypertensive patients before December, 2013. Data extraction and quality evaluation were performed. Meta-analysis was performed by Review Manager 5.2.3. Ten high quality studies (11 articles) with a total of 42,892 patients (20,491 patients in the ACEI/ARBs group and 22,401 patients in the \u03b2-blocker or the calcium antagonist group) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that ACEI/ARBs reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence compared to calcium antagonists (RR\u200a=\u200a0.48; 95%CI, 0.40-0.58; P<0.00001) or \u03b2-blockers (RR\u200a=\u200a0.39; 95%CI, 0.20-0.74; P\u200a=\u200a0.005) in long-term follow-up, respectively. Furthermore, ACEI/ARBs reduced the incidence of congestive heart failure (RR\u200a=\u200a0.86; 95%CI, 0.77-0.96; P\u200a=\u200a0.007). However, no significant effects were observed on the incidence of new AF, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Our results suggest that ACEI/ARBs may reduce the incidence of AF recurrence and congestive heart failure, with fewer serious adverse effects.", 
    "2": "Although essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder, little is known regarding its pathophysiology. Cutaneous silent period (CSP) is a spinal inhibitory reflex that causes suppression of the voluntary muscle contraction that is induced by strong electrical stimulation of the cutaneous nerves. Clinical interest in the CSP stems from its potential usefulness for evaluating segment and components of sensory nerves that are not well assessed by standard electrodiagnostic methods. The aim of this study was to investigate CSP in patients with ET before and after treatment. A total of 30 patients (12 females\u00a0+\u00a018 males), having ET diagnosis and propranolol treatment initiated, were studied with technique of CSP. Patient group's pre-treatment latency average is found 84.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.63, average CSP duration 42.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.82, and CSP final latency average 127.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.13. According to post-treatment CSP analysis, it is seen that patients' average latency values are found 83.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020.92 and it is determined that there is no significant statistical difference compared to pre-treatment latency values (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Post-treatment average CSP duration is found 36.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.38, and it is seen that there is a significant statistical shortening compared to pre-treatment durations (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Patients' post-treatment CSP final latency averages are found 123.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.67, and it is determined that there is no significant statistical difference compared to pre-treatment latency values (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The main finding of this study is that in ET the CSP is prolonged and that treatment with propranolol shortens the CSP and brings it closer to normal values. A small dose of propranolol has the effect of shortening pathologically prolonged CSP in a subset of ET patients (women and without family history), making further investigations with this method interesting. From this point of view in our study, patients with ET treatment give an idea of the effectiveness of propranolol. In recent years, a technique of CSP is interested in the field of electrophysiology and shows the effect of ET that given other pharmacological treatment and also it can be considered a quantitative measure to compare them. The usefulness of CSP should be supported by further studies with more patients.",

    "12": "The predictability of the zebrafish embryo model is highly influenced by internal exposure of the embryo/larva. As compound uptake is likely to be influenced by factors such as lipophilicity, solvent use, and chorion presence, this article focuses on investigating their effects on compound distribution within the zebrafish embryo. To visualize compound uptake and distribution, zebrafish embryos were exposed for 96 hr, starting at 4 hr postfertilization, to water-soluble dyes: Schiff's reagent (logP -4.63), Giemsa stain (logP -0.77), Van Gierson stain (logP 1.64), Cresyl fast violet (logP 3.5), Eosine Y (logP 4.8), Sudan III (logP 7.5), and Oil red O (logP 9.81), with and without 1% dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO). Three additional compounds were used to analytically determine the uptake and distribution: Acyclovir (logP -1.56), Zidovudine (logP 0.05), and Metoprolol Tartrate Salt (logP 1.8). Examinations were performed every 24 hr. Both methods (visualization and specific analysis) showed that exposure to higher logP values results in higher compound uptake. Specific analysis showed that for lipophilic compounds >90% of compound is taken up by the embryo. For hydrophilic compounds, >90% of compound within the complete egg could not be associated to embryo or chorion and is probably distributed into the perivitelline space. Overall, internal exposure analyses on at least two occasions (i.e., before and after hatching) is crucial for interpretation of zebrafish embryotoxicity data, especially for compounds with extreme logP values. DMSO did not affect exposure when examined with the visualization method, however, this method might be not sensitive enough to draw hard conclusions.", 
    "13": "The incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms, including overactive bladder (OAB), is continuing to rise, and is associated with a negative impact on quality of life and a heavy economic burden. A major risk factor for OAB is advancing age. The etiology of OAB is multifactorial and appears to involve myogenic, neurogenic, and urotheliogenic factors. In this article, we review the strengthening preclinical evidence supporting the contribution of chronic pelvic ischemia to the pathogenesis of OAB. In animal models, chronic ischemia induced by arterial injury and a high-fat diet upregulates markers of oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines in the urothelium and lamina propria, and leads to increased expression of nerve growth factor. These processes result in increased afferent activity and an increased frequency of micturition, reflecting a state of bladder hyperactivity. In severe, prolonged cases, bladder overactivity may develop into underactivity. Antimuscarinic therapies are the mainstay of OAB treatment, but their usefulness is limited by modest efficacy and troublesome side-effects. Our increasing understanding of the contribution of chronic ischemia to OAB is leading toward novel therapeutic options targeting chronic pelvic ischemia and its morphological, functional, and oxidative consequences. Preclinical trials have demonstrated encouraging results with \u03b11 -adrenoreceptor blockade, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibition, \u03b23 -adrenoreceptor agonism, free radical scavenging, and stem cell therapy, in preventing morphological, biochemical and functional changes induced by chronic bladder ischemia.",

Therefore, a mouse ECG analysis algorithm was developed and validated. Surface ECG (lead II) was acquired during transthoracic echocardiography from C57Bl/6J mice under isoflurane anesthesia. The effect of aging was studied in young (2-3\u00a0months), middle-aged (14\u00a0months) and old (20-24\u00a0months) mice. The ECG changes associated with pharmacological interventions and common cardiac pathologies, that is, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and progressive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), were studied. The ECG raw data were analyzed with an in-house ECG analysis program, modified specially for mouse ECG. Aging led to increases in P-wave duration, atrioventricular conduction time (PQ interval), and intraventricular conduction time (QRS complex width), while the R-wave amplitude decreased. In addition, the prevalence of arrhythmias increased during aging. Anticholinergic atropine shortened PQ time, and beta blocker metoprolol and calcium-channel blocker verapamil increased PQ interval and decreased heart rate. The ECG changes after AMI included early JT elevation, development of Q waves, decreased R-wave amplitude, and later changes in JT/T segment. In progressive LVH model, QRS complex width was increased at 2 and especially 4\u00a0weeks timepoint, and also repolarization abnormalities were seen. Aging, drugs, AMI, and LVH led to similar ECG changes in mice as seen in humans, which could be reliably detected with this new algorithm.

RX821002, an \u03b12-AR antagonist, produced Arc and Zif268 elevations across cortical layers. Next we examined the effects of delivering RX821002 with an \u03b11-AR antagonist, prazosin, and a \u03b2-AR antagonist, propranolol. RX821002 given with a prazosin and propranolol cocktail, or with each of these antagonists individually, decreased Arc and Zif268 to saline-treated control levels in most cortical layers. Arc and Zif268 levels were also similar to saline-treated control levels when rats were given a prazosin and propranolol cocktail alone, or when each of these antagonists were delivered individually.

Overstimulation of \u03b22AR inhibited the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes. Additionally, \u03b2AR mediated cardiac insulin resistance by reducing glucose uptake and GLUT4 expression via the cAMP-dependent and protein kinase A-dependent pathways.

In the current study, despite some species difference in drug clearances, this modeling methodology was adapted to estimate human plasma concentrations of P450 probes based on data from commonly used medium-sized experimental animals, namely dogs and minipigs. Using known species allometric scaling factors and in vitro metabolic clearance data, the observed plasma concentrations of slowly eliminated caffeine and warfarin and rapidly eliminated omeprazole, metoprolol and midazolam in two young dogs were scaled to human oral monitoring equivalents. Using the same approach, the previously reported pharmacokinetics of the five P450 probes in minipigs was also scaled to human monitoring equivalents. The human plasma concentration profiles of the five P450 probes estimated by the simplified human PBPK models based on observed/reported pharmacokinetics in dogs/minipigs were consistent with previously published pharmacokinetic data in humans. These results suggest that dogs and minipigs, in addition to monkeys, could be suitable models for humans during research into new drugs, especially when used in combination with simple PBPK models.",

The overall adherence was high in the GWTG participating hospitals. Those with the LOS <4 days were more likely to receive aspirin (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.19; p <0.001), clopidogrel (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.60 to 1.95; p <0.001), lipid-lowering therapy if indicated (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.21; p <0.001), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker for left ventricular systolic dysfunction (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.21; p = 0.04) and smoking cessation counseling (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.24; p <0.001) compared to those with the LOS \u2265 4 days. In contrast, those with the LOS <4 days were less likely to receive beta blockers (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.93; p <0.001). The odds of receiving defect-free care were greater for patients with the LOS <4 days (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.21; p <0.001). In conclusion, in GWTG participating hospitals, a shorter LOS did not appear to adversely affect adherence to discharge quality of care measures.", 
    "40": "In the present work, novel nanostructures comprising of glyceryl monooleate (GMO) and Eudragit E100 were prepared using high intensity ultrasonic homogenization. 3(2) Factorial design approach was used for optimization of nanostructures. Results of regression analysis revealed that the amount of GMO and Eudragit E100 had a drastic effect on particle size and percent entrapment efficiency. Optimized carvedilol-loaded nanostructures (Car-NS) were characterized by FTIR, TEM, DSC, in vitro drug release study. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax, Tmax, Ke, Ka, Vd and AUC were estimated for Car-NS upon its oral administration in Sprague-Dawley rats. Particle size of Car-NS was found to be 183\u2009\u00b1\u20092.43\u2009nm with an entrapment efficiency of 81.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.512%. FTIR studies revealed loading and chemical compatibility of carvedilol with the components of nanostructures. DSC thermograms did not show endothermic peak for melting of carvedilol which could be attributed to solubilization of carvedilol in molten GMO during DSC run. The prepared Car-NS released carvedilol in sustained manner over a period of 10\u00a0h as suggested by in vitro drug release study. The pharmacokinetic study of Car-NS showed significant improvement in Cmax (two fold, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and AUC (four folds, p\u2009<\u20090.001) of carvedilol when compared to carvedilol suspension. Car-NS were found to be stable for a period of 3 months. Thus, a stable, floating, multiparticulate GMO/Eudragit E100 nanostructures having ability to release the drug in sustained manner with enhanced oral bioavailability can prove to be a promising carrier system for poorly water soluble drugs.",

Surgical resection is the mainstay of therapy and patients are at risk of significant hemodynamic and circulatory complications mainly attributable to catecholamine excess. The mainstay of medical therapy in order to optimize patients for surgery includes: alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blocker and other agents to achieve normal blood pressure, heart rate, as well as normal volume status. Understanding the pathophysiology of pheochromocytoma, the pharmacology of medications used, and recognizing postoperative complications will impact patient outcomes.",

    "43": "Laboratory studies have suggested that adrenergic blockers may inhibit the proliferation and migration of cancer cells, but epidemiological evidence of their effect on cancer incidence has proven inconsistent. We therefore conducted a case-control study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to assess the effect of adrenergic blockers on the incidence of prostate, lung, bowel and breast cancers. From among patients aged 18 years or older who contributed at least 2 years of prospectively gathered data between 1 January 1987 and 31 December 2012, we selected incident cases of relevant cancers and controls, frequency matched 10\u2009:\u20091 by age. Logistic regression was used to adjust effect estimates for age, sex, smoking, alcohol use, and a number of potentially confounding comorbidities and coprescriptions. A total of 18\u2009968 colorectal, 19\u2009082 lung, 21\u2009608 prostate and 29\u2009109 breast cancers were identified. We found no evidence of a protective effect of adrenergic blockade in lung and prostate cancers and found a slightly increased risk for colorectal and breast cancers in users. This was largely explained by the effects of confounding in multivariate analyses, with final odds ratio estimates for lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers of 0.99 [95% confidence interval (0.96-1.04)], 1.14 (1.09-1.18), 1.10 (1.06-1.14), and 1.01 (0.98-1.05), respectively, for \u03b2-blocker exposure, and final odds ratio estimates for lung, colorectal and breast cancer of 1.03 (0.97-1.09), 1.13 (1.07-1.20), and 1.08 (1.00-1.17), respectively, for \u03b1-blocker exposure. We found no evidence to suggest that adrenergic blocker use prevents common cancers. Indeed, we found a slightly increased risk for colorectal and breast cancers, which may reflect residual confounding.", 
    "44": "The main first-line treatment strategy for glaucoma is to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) by topical ocular hypotensive medications, but many patients require multiple medications for adequate IOP control. Fixed-combination therapies provide several benefits, including simplified treatment regimens, theoretical improved treatment adherence, elimination of the potential for washout of the first drug by the second, and the reduction in ocular exposure to preservatives. \u03b2-Adrenoceptor antagonists (particularly 0.5% timolol) are the most commonly used agents in combination with other classes of drugs as fixed-combination eyedrops, but they are contraindicated in many patients, owing to local allergy or systemic side effects. A fixed-combination preparation without a \u03b2-blocker is therefore warranted. This paper reviews the clinical effectiveness of brinzolamide 1% and brimonidine 0.2% fixed combination (BBFC) for use in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. We searched PubMed and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry, and identified three randomized controlled trials comparing BBFC vs its constituents (brimonidine vs brinzolamide), and one comparing BBFC with unfixed brimonidine and brinzolamide. All of the studies demonstrated mean diurnal IOP to be statistically significantly lower in the BBFC group compared with constituent groups and noninferior to that with the concomitant group using two separate bottles. The safety profile of BBFC was consistent with that of its individual components, the most common ocular adverse events being ocular hyperemia, visual disturbances, and ocular allergic reactions. Common systemic adverse effects included altered taste sensation, oral dryness, fatigue, somnolence, and decreased alertness. BBFC seems to be a promising new fixed combination for use in glaucoma patients. However, long-term effects of BBFC on IOP, treatment adherence, and safety need to be determined.",

In total 254 studies were retrieved from medical databases and comprised 10,022 patients divided into 5 different treatment groups. Information about working mechanism, side effects and adverse events of therapies used as a single agent for IH are discussed and evaluated according to information from pharmacotherapeutic databases. Randomized controlled trials have only scarcely been performed for the many therapeutic options reported for IH.

    "48": "Current evidence suggests that beta-blocker lower the risk of development of atrial fibrillation (AF) and in-hospital stroke after cardiac surgery. This study was to assess whether beta-blockers could decrease incidence of new-onset AF in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). We identified patients from a nation-wide database called Registry for Catastrophic Illness, which encompassed almost 100% of the patients receiving dialysis therapy in Taiwan from 1995 to 2008. Propensity score matching and Cox's proportional hazards regression model were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for new-onset AF. Among 100066 patients, 41.7% received beta-blockers. After a median follow-up of 1500 days, the incidence of new-onset AF significantly decreased in patients treated with beta-blockers (HR = 0.483, 95% confidence interval = 0.437-0.534). The prevention of new-onset AF was significantly better in patients taking longer duration of beta-blockers therapy (P for time trend <0.001). The AF prevention effect remains robust in subgroup analyses. In conclusion, beta-blockers seem effective in the primary prevention of AF in ESRD patients. Hence, beta-blockers may be the target about upstream treatment of AF.",

The recommendation to stop BBs prior to stress testing in order to ensure the highest MBF remains advisable. If temporary BB withdrawal is unfeasible due to contraindications, a tight clinical schedule, or because a patient forgot to withhold the BB, it is appropriate to perform adenosine stress testing according to the results of this study.",

The Pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of the BF nasal formulation were evaluated in Wistar rats. The BF nasal spray after administration exhibited very fast absorption and higher plasma drug concentration. The maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and the time to reach it (T(max)) were 409.5 ng/ml and 3.6 min for the BF nasal spray, 39.4 ng/ml and 26.7 min for the drug solution, respectively. The bioavailability of the BF nasal spray was greater than 1500.0%. Meantime, the effect of the BF nasal spray on nasal mucociliary movement was also studied with a toad palate model. The BF nasal preparation showed minor ciliotoxicity, but the adverse effect was temporary and reversible.",

Eudragit L100, pectin, acacia as sustained release polymers in different ratios for SR metoprolol tartrate layer and sodium bicarbonate, citric acid as gas generating agents for the floating extended release layer. The floating bilayer tablets of lisinopril maleate and metoprolol tartrate were designed to overcome the various problems associated with conventional oral dosage form. Floating tablets were evaluated for floating lag time, drug contents and in-vitro dissolution profile and different kinetic release models were applied. It was clear that the different ratios of polymers affected the drug release and floating time. L2 and M4 showed good drug release profile and floating behavior. The linear regression and model fitting showed that all formulation followed Higuchi model of drug release model except M4 that followed zero order kinetic. From the study it is evident that a promising controlled release by floating bilyer tablets of lisinopril maleate and metoprolol tartrate can be developed successfully.",

The decomposition of organic matter is an important functional process in aquatic systems, and it is known that this can be impacted by the presence of pollutants. Previous studies on leaf litter breakdown have only considered the effects of antibiotics and not other groups of drugs though. The current study investigated the effects of anti-inflammatories, a beta-blocker and an antibiotic on microbially mediated breakdown of leaf litter in the laboratory; colonisation of leaf packs by benthic macroinvertebrates when placed in a stream; and shredding of leaf litter by these organisms. Furthermore, the effects of single compounds relative to their mixture were assessed. It was found that exposure of leaf litter to the study compounds did not influence its breakdown by microbes in the laboratory or macroinvertebrates in a stream. Exposure of leaf litter to pharmaceuticals also had no effect on its colonisation by macroinvertebrates in this study. Many unknowns remain, however, and further studies of the effects of pharmaceuticals on structural and functional endpoints are needed to aid aquatic conservation.", 
    "61": "Serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)], an inflammatory mediator, contributes to inflammatory pain. The presence of multiple 5-HT subtype receptors on peripheral and central nociceptors complicates the role of 5-HT in pain. Previously, we found that 5-HT2B/2C antagonist could block 5-HT-induced mechanical hyperalgesia. However, the types of neurons or circuits underlying this effect remained unsolved. Here, we demonstrate that the Gq/11-phospholipase C\u03b2-protein kinase C\u03b5 (PKC\u03b5) pathway mediated by 5-HT2B is involved in 5-HT-induced mechanical hyperalgesia in mice. Administration of a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) antagonist inhibited the 5-HT-induced mechanical hyperalgesia. 5-HT injection enhanced 5-HT- and capsaicin-evoked calcium signals specifically in isolectin B4 (IB4)-negative neurons; signals were inhibited by a 5-HT2B/2C antagonist and PKC\u03b5 blocker. Thus, 5-HT2B mediates 5-HT-induced mechanical hyperalgesia by regulating TRPV1 function.",

We compared major aortic events including mortality, aortic dissection, and reoperation in patients without RAAS blockade (group 1, n=27) to those with (group 2, n=63). The aortic growth rate was calculated by dividing the diameter change on CT scans taken immediately post-operatively and the latest scan available.",

    "67": "Chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) contributes to cardiac remodeling and the transition to heart failure (HF). Renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) may ameliorate this damage by improving renal function and sympathetic cardioregulation in hypertensive HF patients with renal injury. The efficacy may be comparable to that of chronic \u03b2-blocker treatment. Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats were subjected to RDN in the hypertrophic stage. Another group of Dahl rats were subjected to sham operations and treated chronically with vehicle (CONT) or \u03b2-blocker bisoprolol (BISO). Neither RDN nor BISO altered the blood pressure; however, BISO significantly reduced the heart rate (HR). Both RDN and BISO significantly prolonged survival (22.2 and 22.4 weeks, respectively) compared with CONT (18.3 weeks). Echocardiography revealed reduced left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and improved LV function, and histological analysis demonstrated the amelioration of LV myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis in the RDN and BISO rats at the HF stage. Tyrosine hydroxylase and \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (ADR) expression levels in the LV myocardium significantly increased only in the RDN rats, whereas the \u03b11b-, \u03b11d- and \u03b12c-ADR expression levels increased only in the BISO rats. In both groups, renal damage and dysfunction were also reduced, and this reduction was accompanied by the suppression of endothelin-1, renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme mRNAs. RDN ameliorated the progression of both myocardial and renal damage in the hypertensive rats independent of blood pressure changes. The overall effects were similar to those of \u03b2-receptor blockade with favorable effects on HR and \u03b1-ADR expression. These findings may be associated with the restoration of the myocardial SNS and renal protection.",

Patients treated with monotherapy or with SSRI showed in the multiple regression analysis significant lower RHR than other subjects, whereas both polytherapy with more antipsychotics and the diagnosis of schizophrenia could be identified as an independent risk factor of elevated RHR (p<0.05, 2-tailed).

Whether this effect is less pronounced with vasodilating \u03b2-blockers (VBB) when compared with nonvasodilating \u03b2-blockers (NVBB) remains unsettled. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials exploring the effects of \u03b2-blockers on both pSBP and cSBP in hypertension. We selected 20 studies, for a total of 32 treatment arms (n=21 for NVBB, n=11 for VBB) and 1263 participants (n=962 for NVBB, n=301 for VBB). pSBP decreased from 150 to 133 mm Hg for NVBB and from 145 to 134 mm Hg for VBB. cSBP decreased from 137 to 126 mm Hg for NVBB and from 132 to 123 mm Hg for VBB. SBP amplification (pSBP-cSBP) decreased significantly under VBB (-5.6 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -7.8, -3.4 mm Hg), but not under NVBB (-1.1 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -3.4, +1.2 mm Hg; P<0.01 versus NVBB). There was high heterogeneity both within and between \u03b2-blockers subclasses. In a meta-regression model, the weighted difference in treatment-induced changes in SBP amplification between NVBB and VBB lost its significance after adjustment for mean age and baseline pSBP and heart rate (-2.9\u00b12.3 mm Hg; P=0.22) and was almost abolished after adjustment for treatment-induced heart rate changes (-0.1\u00b10.5 mm Hg; P=0.78). In conclusion, NVBBs, but not VBBs, determine a lower reduction in cSBP than in pSBP.

Specific agents targeting pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been developed over the last few years, but the efficacy of these agents in pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (PH-LHD) is uncertain. We report a case of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) initially presented with biventricular failure, which was misdiagnosed as PH-LHD. A 31-year-old man who had a history of recurrent hemoptysis was referred to our center with biventricular failure. Right heart catheterization (RHC) showed elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). He was diagnosed as having PH-LHD, specifically combined post-capillary and precapillary PH (CpcPH). We treated him for 2 years with diuretics, a beta blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and sildenafil, which was added to treat CpcPH. A follow-up echocardiography showed that biventricular function had improved, but not PH. A second RHC revealed elevated mPAP and normal PCWP, which made us change the diagnosis to IPAH.

Pre-operative identification of high-risk individuals and appropriate peri-operative management can reduce cardiovascular risk. It is important to continue chronic beta-blocker and statin therapy. Statins are relatively safe and peri-operative initiation may be beneficial in high-risk patients and those scheduled for vascular surgery. The pre-operative introduction of beta-blockers reduces myocardial injury but increases rates of stroke and mortality, possibly due to hypotension. They should only be considered in high-risk patients and the dose should be titrated to heart rate. Alpha-2 agonists may also contribute to hypotension. Aspirin continuation can increase the risk of major bleeding and offset the benefit of reduced myocardial risk. Contrary to the initial ENIGMA study, nitrous oxide does not seem to increase the risk of myocardial injury.

RACK1 may be a target protein of S-propranolol during I/R. At present, we constructed a lentiviral expression vector for RNA interference (RNAi) of RACK1. The interference efficiency of the lentivirus was confirmed by RT-PCR and western blot. H9C2 cells infected with Lv-RACK1-shRNA or control were subjected to simulate I/R in the presence and absence of S-propranolol. The release of cytokines and chemokines was determined by ELISA assay. Flow cytometry was employed to determine mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), Ca(2+) concentration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cell apoptosis. We found that RACK1 RNAi and S-propranolol treatment remarkably protected I/R injured cells from apoptosis via attenuating the release of cytokines and chemokines, Ca(2+) overload, ROS concentration, and MMP. Furthermore, RACK1 RNAi and S-propranolol, separately and in combination, significantly reduced caspase-3 activity, cytochrome c release and JNK activation.

This study aimed to compare serial serum levels of the components of the RAS in patients before and after surgical excision, propranolol or captopril treatment for problematic proliferating IH. Patients with problematic proliferating IH underwent measurements of serum levels of plasma renin activity (PRA), ACE and angiotensin II (ATII) before, and 1-2 and 6 months following surgical excision, propranolol or captopril treatment.

Treatment with either surgical excision or propranolol resulted in significant decrease in the mean levels of PRA. Surgical excision or captopril treatment led to significant decline in the mean levels of ATII. All three treatment modalities had no significant effect on the mean levels of ACE.

Addressing these problems effectively requires an intervention that durably reduces both the intrusiveness of key fear-related memories and state anxiety during surgery. Moreover, evidence suggests that propranolol is capable of inhibiting \"memory reconsolidation\" (that is, it blocks the process of storing a recently retrieved fear memory).

Aortic aneurysms in Fibulin-4 mutant mice were associated with upregulation of TGF-\u03b2 signalling. How Fibulin-4 deficiency leads to deregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway is largely unknown. Isolated aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from Fibulin-4 deficient mice showed reduced growth, which could be reversed by treatment with TGF-\u03b2 neutralizing antibodies. In Fibulin-4 deficient SMCs increased TGF-\u03b2 signalling was detected using a transcriptional reporter assay and by increased SMAD2 phosphorylation. Next, we investigated if the increased activity was due to increased levels of the three TGF-\u03b2 isoforms. These data revealed slightly increased TGF-\u03b21 and markedly increased TGF-\u03b22 levels. Significantly increased TGF-\u03b22 levels were also detectable in plasma from homozygous Fibulin-4(R/R) mice, not in wild type mice. TGF-\u03b22 levels were reduced after losartan treatment, an angiotensin-II type-1 receptor blocker, known to prevent aortic aneurysm formation. In conclusion, we have shown increased TGF-\u03b2 signalling in isolated SMCs from Fibulin-4 deficient mouse aortas, not only caused by increased levels of TGF-\u03b21, but especially TGF-\u03b22. These data provide new insights in the molecular interaction between Fibulin-4 and TGF-\u03b2 pathway regulation in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms.",

Such drugs include long acting beta agonists (LABAs) that are paradoxically linked to excess asthma-related mortality. Here we show that LABAs such as salmeterol and structurally related \u03b22-AR drugs such as formoterol and carvedilol, but not short-acting agonists (SABAs) such as albuterol, promote exaggerated asthma-like allergic airway disease and enhanced airway constriction in mice. We demonstrate that salmeterol aberrantly promotes activation of the allergic disease-related transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) in multiple mouse and human cells. A novel inhibitor of STAT6, PM-242H, inhibited initiation of allergic disease induced by airway fungal challenge, reversed established allergic airway disease in mice, and blocked salmeterol-dependent enhanced allergic airway disease. Thus, structurally related \u03b22-AR ligands aberrantly activate STAT6 and promote allergic airway disease. This untoward pharmacological property likely explains adverse outcomes observed with LABAs, which may be overcome by agents that antagonize STAT6.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the roles of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a ubiquitous gasotransmitter, in itch signaling. We found that intradermal injection of H2S donors NaHS or Na2S, but not GYY4137 (a slow-releasing H2S donor), dose-dependently induced scratching behavior in a \u03bc-opioid receptor-dependent and histamine-independent manner in mice. Interestingly, NaHS induced itch via unique mechanisms that involved capsaicin-insensitive A-fibers, but not TRPV1-expressing C-fibers that are traditionally considered for mediating itch, revealed by depletion of TRPV1-expressing C-fibers by systemic resiniferatoxin treatment. Moreover, local application of capsaizapine (TRPV1 blocker) or HC-030031 (TRPA1 blocker) had no effects on NaHS-evoked scratching. Strikingly, pharmacological blockade and silencing of Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel by mibefradil, ascorbic acid, zinc chloride or Cav3.2 siRNA dramatically decreased NaHS-evoked scratching. NaHS induced robust alloknesis (touch-evoked itch), which was inhibited by T-type calcium channels blocker mibefradil. Compound 48/80-induced itch was enhanced by an endogenous precursor of H2S (L-cysteine) but attenuated by inhibitors of H2S-producing enzymes cystathionine \u03b3-lyase and cystathionine \u03b2-synthase. These results indicated that H2S, as a novel nonhistaminergic itch mediator, may activates Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel, probably located at A-fibers, to induce scratching and alloknesis in mice.",

One target of 3-T1AM is the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), which is a member of the rhodopsin-like family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Interestingly, the effects of 3-T1AM remain detectable in TAAR1 knockout mice, suggesting further targets for 3-T1AM such as adrenergic receptors. Therefore, we evaluated whether \u03b2-adrenergic receptor 1 (ADRB1) and 2 (ADRB2) signaling is affected by 3-T1AM in HEK293 cells and in human conjunctival epithelial cells (IOBA-NHC), where these receptors are highly expressed endogenously.",

We used data from three satavaptan trials to examine whether NSBBs increase mortality in cirrhosis patients with ascites. The trials were conducted in 2006-2008 and included 1198 cirrhosis patients with ascites followed for 1 year. We used Cox regression to compare all-cause mortality and cirrhosis-related mortality between patients who did and those who did not use NSBBs at randomization, controlling for age, gender, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, Child-Pugh score, serum sodium, previous variceal bleeding, cirrhosis etiology, and ascites severity. Moreover, we identified clinical events predicting that a patient would stop NSBB treatment. At randomization, the 559 NSBB users were more likely than the 629 nonusers to have a history of variceal bleeding but less likely to have Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis, hyponatremia, or refractory ascites. The 52-week cumulative all-cause mortality was similar in the NSBB user and nonuser groups (23.2% versus 25.3%, adjusted hazard ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.72-1.18), and NSBBs also did not increase mortality in the subgroup of patients with refractory ascites (588 patients, adjusted hazard ratio = 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.74-1.40) or in any other subgroup.

    "151": "We report a simple and versatile method to covalently immobilize molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanoparticles on a Raman active substrate (Klarite) using a disulfide-derivatized perfluorophenylazide (PFPA-disulfide). Gold-coated Klarite was functionalized with PFPA-disulfide via a gold-sulfur bond. Upon light radiation, the available azido groups were converted to highly reactive singlet perfluorophenyl nitrene that undergoes a CH insertion reaction and form covalent bonds with the MIP nanoparticles. The resulting surfaces were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy to study the morphology and template affinity of the surfaces, respectively. The Raman measurements clearly show a dose-responsive signal when propranolol binds to the MIP surface. Because the MIP particles were covalently attached to the Raman active substrate, the sensing surface was stable and could be reused after regeneration in acetic acid solution. The MIP-based Raman sensor was used successfully to detect propranolol in urine samples (7.7 \u00d7 10(-4) M). Our results show that the high selectivity of MIPs and the fingerprint Raman identification can be integrated into a compact sensing unit using high-efficiency photoconjugation.

    "152": "Cellular signaling associated with cardiac \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-AR) is composed of coupled mechanism among \u03b2 1-/\u03b22-AR and Gs proteins with contribution of constitutive \u03b23-AR coupling to Gi proteins. However, down-regulation of \u03b2-ARs in the heart under pathological conditions is mediated with a signaling G proteins-included mechanism. Additionally, there are serious conflicting data on this field in literature yet. Although some of these conflictions are generally related with either experimental protocols for different approaches or different animal models. To treat cardiovascular disorders, generally, various types of \u03b2-blockers are used while their action mechanisms are not fully known yet. Furthermore, although \u03b2-blockers are generally used to block the activated \u03b2-ARs, they can be used to scavenge free radicals under oxidative stress. Studies, in whole-system, organ or cellular levels, showed that some \u03b2-blockers, including timolol, have protective-actions against increased oxidative stress in diseased heart via ROSscavenging. Additionally, it has been mentioned that some \u03b2-blockers nicely prevented the development of heart failure in both experimental and clinical studies by restoring sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release channels, RyR2. Since diabetic cardiomyopathy is recognized due to its diminished responsiveness to \u03b21-AR agonist stimulation in the heart with an up-regulation of \u03b2 3-AR, inducing a strong negative inotropic effect on left ventricular function, it has been shown that treatment of streptozotocin-diabetic rats with timolol provided a marked cardio-protection. Importantly, it has been also documented that timolol treatment-dependent cardio-protection in diabetic rats includes basically prevention of RyR2- hyperphosphorylation, which, in turn, block Ca(2+)-leakage from SR via scavenging oxidative agents to control redox-state of cardiomyocytes. This action of timolol in diabetic heart is very similar to other known antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine or selenium compounds. In this review article, antioxidant-like action of timolol in diabetic cardiomyopathy was summarized in way of comparison with the benefits obtained with other antioxidants in the similar animal model.",

The alginate gel beads having 51-58% entrapped MT showed 90% release within 45 min in gastric medium (pH 1.2). Tapioca starch blending markedly improved the entrapment efficiency (88%) and sustained the release for 3-4 h. A 12% w/w HPMC coating on these beads extended the release upto 9-11 h. In vitro wash off and buoyancy test in gastric media revealed that the beads containing CaCO3 has gastric residence of more than 12 h. In vitro optimized multi-unit formulation consisting of immediate and sustained release mucoadhesive-floating beads (40:60) showed good initial release of 42% MT within 1h followed by a sustained release of over 90% for 11 h. Pharmacokinetic study performed in rabbit model showed that the relative oral bioavailability of MT after administration of oral solution, sustain release and optimized formulation was 51%, 67% and 87%, respectively.

We tested whether \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 trafficking and surface expression would be altered by in vitro exposure to flumazenil, a benzodiazepine ligand which reduces \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 expression in vivo. We first determined that flumazenil (100 nM-100 \u03bcM, IC50=\u223c1 \u03bcM) acted as a negative modulator, reducing GABA (10 \u03bcM)-gated current in the presence of 100 nM THP (to increase receptor efficacy), assessed with whole cell patch clamp recordings of recombinant \u03b14\u03b22\u03b4 expressed in HEK-293 cells. Surface expression of recombinant \u03b14\u03b22\u03b4 receptors was detected using a 3XFLAG reporter at the C-terminus of \u03b14 (\u03b14F) using confocal immunocytochemical techniques following 48 h exposure of cells to GABA (10 \u03bcM)+THP (100 nM). Flumazenil (10 \u03bcM) decreased surface expression of \u03b14F by \u223c60%, while increasing its intracellular accumulation, after 48 h. Reduced surface expression of \u03b14\u03b22\u03b4 after flumazenil treatment was confirmed by decreases in the current responses to 100 nM of the GABA agonist gaboxadol. Flumazenil-induced decreases in surface expression of \u03b14\u03b22\u03b4 were prevented by the dynamin blocker, dynasore, and by leupeptin, which blocks lysosomal enzymes, suggesting that flumazenil is acting to increase endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the receptor. Flumazenil increased the rate of receptor removal from the cell surface by 2-fold, assessed using botulinum toxin B to block insertion of new receptors. These findings may suggest new therapeutic strategies for regulation of \u03b14\u03b22\u03b4 expression using flumazenil.",

A recent classification (BDDCS) of drugs based on ADME properties (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) was clearly correlated with the acute ecotoxicities towards algae. Over-estimation of toxicity from our QSAR models was observed for classes 2, 3 and 4 whereas our model results were in agreement for the class 1 pharmaceuticals.

In those with CAD, there was no difference for all-cause death, CV death, major CV events, and MI for CCBs relative to comparators; however, a reduction in the risk of stroke and an increase in the risk of CHF were seen. For BP lowering, CCBs were at least as efficacious as comparators.

Retrospective studies have shown that \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockers, specifically propranolol, significantly decrease mortality of TBI through mechanisms not yet fully elucidated but are thought to counterbalance a hyperadrenergic state resulting from a TBI. Conversely, cellular therapies have been shown to improve long-term behavior following TBI, likely by reducing inflammation. Given the nonredundancy in their therapeutic mechanisms, we hypothesized that a combination of acute propranolol followed by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from human bone marrow would have additive effects in treating a rodent model of TBI. We have found that the treatments are well-tolerated individually and in combination with no adverse events. MSCs decrease BBB permeability at 96 hours after injury, inhibit a significant accumulation of activated microglia/macrophage in the thalamic region of the brain both short and long term, and enhance neurogenesis short term. Propranolol decreases edema and reduces the number of fully activated microglia at 7 days and the number of semiactivated microglia at 120 days. Combinatory treatment improved cognitive and memory functions 120 days following TBI.

These results have direct translational application.

Released insulin from \u03b2-cells inhibits insulin and glucagon secretion with autocrine and paracrine modes. However, molecular mechanism by which insulin inhibits hormone secretion remains elusive. Here, we investigated the effect of autocrine insulin on surface abundance of KATP channel in mouse clonal \u03b2-cell line, MIN6. High glucose increased plasmalemmal sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1), a component of KATP channel as well as exogenous insulin treatment. SUR1 trafficking by high glucose or insulin was blocked by inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) with wortmannin. Pretreatment with brefeldin A or silencing of vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) abolished insulin-mediated upregulation of surface SUR1. Functionally, glucose-stimulated cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) increase was blunted by insulin or diazoxide, a KATP channel opener. Insulin-induced suppression of [Ca(2+)]i oscillation was prevented by an insulin receptor blocker.

A unique action of carvedilol is its suppression of store overload-induced calcium release (SOICR) through the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), which can trigger ventricular arrhythmias. Since the effects of carvedilol metabolites on SOICR have not yet been investigated, three carvedilol metabolites hydroxylated at the 3-, 4' and 5'-positions were synthesized and assayed for SOICR inhibition in mutant HEK 293 cells expressing the RyR2 mutant R4496C. This cell line is especially prone to SOICR and calcium release through the defective RyR2 channel was measured with a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye.

Furthermore, right ventricle-targeted therapies, aimed at mitigating the effects of functional right ventricular failure, include \u03b2-adrenoceptor (\u03b2-AR) blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antioxidants, modulators of metabolism, and 5-hydroxytryptamine-2B (5-HT2B) receptor antagonists. Newer nonpharmacologic modalities for right ventricular support are increasingly being implemented. Early, effective, and individualized therapy may prevent overt right heart failure in fibrotic lung disease leading to improved outcomes and quality of life.",

As a secondary objective, to determine the most effective dose of each agent in delaying first cardiovascular disease hospital admission, including but not limited to heart failure exacerbation, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, or death.", 
    "178": "This study was a retrospective chart review of 272 veterans at the VA Boston Healthcare System newly started on metoprolol succinate (n = 157) or carvedilol (n = 115) between January 2000 and December 2008. After an 8-week study medication titration period, subjects were subcategorized into low-, medium-, and high-dose ranging groups and followed until the first cardiovascular disease hospitalization, death, or 365 days. The main outcome measure was time to first cardiovascular hospitalization or death.", 
    "179": "The mean age (69.9 years vs. 67.9 years) and ejection fraction (26% vs. 25%) were comparable between study arms at baseline. Mean time to first cardiovascular disease hospitalization was significantly different (p = 0.001) between study groups with 330.6 days with in metoprolol succinate group vs. 282.6 days in the carvedilol groups. High-dose carvedilol significantly delayed time to first hospitalization in comparison to medium or low carvedilol doses (p = 0.015, p = 0.005). Low- and high-dose metoprolol succinate were not significantly different (p = 0.509) in time to first event, and both dosing groups fared better compared to medium dose metoprolol succinate (p = 0.046).", 
    "180": "In this veteran patient population in need of additional heart failure treatments, metoprolol succinate use resulted in a delayed time to first cardiovascular disease hospitalization or death compared to carvedilol. Both low and high doses of metoprolol succinate showed a significant delay of time to first cardiovascular hospitalization compared to medium doses of metoprolol succinate. Higher doses of carvedilol showed a significant delay of time to cardiovascular hospitalization than lower carvedilol doses.", 
    "181": "Selective vagal nerve stimulation (sVNS) has been shown to reduce blood pressure without major side effects in rats. This technology might be the key to non-medical antihypertensive treatment in patients with therapy-resistant hypertension. \u03b2-blockers are the first-line therapy of hypertension and have in general a bradycardic effect. As VNS itself can also promote bradycardia, it was the aim of this study to investigate the influence of the \u03b21-selective blocker Metoprolol on the effect of sVNS especially with respect to the heart rate. In 10 male Wistar rats, a polyimide multichannel-cuff electrode was placed around the vagal nerve bundle to selectively stimulate the aortic depressor nerve fibers. The stimulation parameters were adapted to the thresholds of individual animals and were in the following ranges: frequency 30-50\u2009Hz, amplitude 0.3-1.8\u2009mA and pulse width 0.3-1.3\u2009ms. Blood pressure responses were detected with a microtip transducer in the carotid artery, and electrocardiography was recorded with s.c. chest electrodes. After IV administration of Metoprolol (2\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) body weight), the animals' mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) decreased significantly. Although the selective electrical stimulation of the baroreceptive fibers reduced MAP and HR, both effects were significantly alleviated by Metoprolol. As a side effect, the rate of stimulation-induced apnea significantly increased after Metoprolol administration. sVNS can lower the MAP under Metoprolol without causing severe bradycardia.", 
    "182": "The European Pharmacopeia (EP) metoprolol impurities M and N are polar, nonchromophoric \u03b1-hydroxyamines, which are poorly retained in a conventional reversed-phase chromatographic system and are invisible for UV detection. Impurities M and N are currently analyzed by TLC methods in the EP as specified impurities and in the United States Pharmacopeia-National Formulary (USP-NF) as unspecified impurities. In order to modernize the USP monographs of metoprolol drug substances and related drug products, a hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) method coupled with a charged aerosol detector (CAD) was explored for the analysis of the two impurities. A comprehensive column screening that covers a variety of HILIC stationary phases (underivatized silica, amide, diol, amino, zwitterionic, polysuccinimide, cyclodextrin, and mixed-mode) and optimization of HPLC conditions led to the identification of a Halo Penta HILIC column (4.6 \u00d7 150 mm, 5 \u03bcm) and a mobile phase comprising 85% acetonitrile and 15% ammonium formate buffer (100 mM, pH 3.2). Efficient separations of metoprolol, succinic acid, and EP metoprolol impurities M and N were achieved within a short time frame (<8 min). The HILIC-CAD method was subsequently validated per USP validation guidelines with respect to specificity, robustness, linearity, accuracy, and precision, and could be incorporated into the current USP-NF monographs to replace the outdated TLC methods. Furthermore, the developed method was successfully applied to determine organic impurities in metoprolol drug substance (metoprolol succinate) and drug products (metoprolol tartrate injection and metoprolol succinate extended release tablets).", 
    "183": "Binding of extracellular ligands to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) initiates transmembrane signaling by inducing conformational changes on the cytoplasmic receptor surface. Knowledge of this process provides a platform for the development of GPCR-targeting drugs. Here, using a site-specific Cy3 fluorescence probe in the human \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR), we observed that individual receptor molecules in the native-like environment of phospholipid nanodiscs undergo spontaneous transitions between two distinct conformational states. These states are assigned to inactive and active-like receptor conformations. Individual receptor molecules in the apo form repeatedly sample both conformations, with a bias toward the inactive conformation. Experiments in the presence of drug ligands show that binding of the full agonist formoterol shifts the conformational distribution in favor of the active-like conformation, whereas binding of the inverse agonist ICI-118,551 favors the inactive conformation. Analysis of single-molecule dwell-time distributions for each state reveals that formoterol increases the frequency of activation transitions, while also reducing the frequency of deactivation events. In contrast, the inverse agonist increases the frequency of deactivation transitions. Our observations account for the high level of basal activity of this receptor and provide insights that help to rationalize, on the molecular level, the widely documented variability of the pharmacological efficacies among GPCR-targeting drugs.", 
    "184": "Activation of the sympathetic nervous system by stress increases breast cancer metastasis in vivo. Preclinical studies suggest that stress activates \u03b2-adrenoceptors (\u03b2ARs) to enhance metastasis from primary tumors and that \u03b2-blockers may be protective in breast cancer. However, the subtype of \u03b2AR that mediates this effect, as well as the signaling mechanisms underlying increased tumor cell dissemination, remain unclear. We show that the \u03b22AR is the only functionally relevant \u03b2AR subtype in the highly metastatic human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231HM. \u03b22AR activation results in elevated cAMP (formoterol pEC50 9.86 \u00b1 0.32), increased intracellular Ca(2+) (formoterol pEC50 8.20 \u00b1 0.33) and reduced phosphorylated ERK (pERK; formoterol pIC50 11.62 \u00b1 0.31). We demonstrate that a highly amplified positive feedforward loop between the cAMP and Ca(2+) pathways is responsible for efficient inhibition of basal pERK. Importantly, activation of the \u03b22AR increased invasion (formoterol area under the curve [AUC] relative to vehicle: 1.82 \u00b1 0.36), which was dependent on the cAMP/Ca(2+) loop (formoterol AUC in the presence of 2'5'-dideoxyadenosine 0.64 \u00b1 0.03, or BAPTA-AM 0.45 \u00b1 0.23) but independent of inhibition of basal pERK1/2 (vehicle AUC with U0126 0.60 \u00b1 0.30). Specifically targeting the positive feedforward cAMP/Ca(2+) loop may be beneficial for the development of therapeutics to slow disease progression in patients with breast cancer."
