    "0": "Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. In patients who have had a myocardial infarction or revascularization procedure, secondary prevention of coronary artery disease by comprehensive risk factor modification reduces mortality, decreases subsequent cardiac events, and improves quality of life. Options for secondary prevention include medical therapy and surgical revascularization in the form of coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention. Medical therapy focuses on comprehensive risk factor modification. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (including weight management, physical activity, tobacco cessation, and dietary modification) improve cardiac risk factors and are universally recommended by evidence-based guidelines. Treatment of hypertension and dyslipidemia reduces morbidity and mortality. Recommendations for persons with diabetes mellitus generally encourage glucose control, but current evidence has not shown reductions in mortality with intensive glucose management. Aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta blockers reduce recurrent cardiac events in patients after myocardial infarction. Surgical revascularization by coronary artery bypass grafting is recommended for those with significant left main coronary artery stenosis, significant stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery, multivessel coronary disease, or disabling angina. Percutaneous coronary intervention may be considered in select patients with objective evidence of ischemia demonstrated by noninvasive testing.", 
    "1": "Propranolol has recently been introduced as a novel pharmacologic treatment for infantile hemangiomas. Systematic examination of this treatment in a tertiary care setting has not been described. This study explores the impact of propranolol on both proliferative and involuting hemangiomas at a tertiary vascular anomalies center.", 
    "2": "Retrospective single institution review.", 
    "3": "We reviewed children treated with propranolol for problematic hemangiomas followed by a blinded prospective analysis of serial photographs taken during the course of their therapy. Parental questionnaires were obtained to evaluate perceived therapeutic response and complications to oral propranolol.", 
    "4": "Thirty-two children with complete photo documentation were treated with oral propranolol for infantile hemangiomas between September 2008 and June 2009. Twenty-seven patients began therapy during the proliferative phase of their lesions (mean age, 4.9 months), whereas five patients began during the involutional phase (mean age, 19.4 months). Ninety-seven percent of patients displayed improvement in the quality of their hemangiomas during propranolol therapy. Patients were determined to be excellent responders (n = 16, 50%), partial responders (n = 15, 47%), or nonresponders (n = 1, 3%). Partial and nonresponders received adjuvant therapy (75%, laser therapy; 31%, steroid injections). Ten patients experienced minor but reportable side effects to propranolol, including somnolence (27.2%), gastroesophageal reflux (9.1%), respiratory syncytial virus exacerbation (4.5%), and rash (4.5%).", 
    "5": "Propranolol may revolutionize the treatment of problematic hemangiomas that cause imminent functional or cosmetic sequelae. At therapeutic doses, propranolol is safe and effective in the majority of patients. Adjunctive therapies may still be required. Minor side effects, expected from beta-blocker therapy, are common but easily managed.", 
    "6": "Microwave-induced corneal endothelial damage was reported to have a low threshold (2.6 W/kg), and vasoactive ophthalmologic medications lowered the threshold by a factor of 10-0.26 W/kg. In an attempt to confirm these observations, four adult male Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) under propofol anesthesia were exposed to pulsed microwaves in the far field of a 2.8 GHz signal (1.43 +/- 0.06 micros pulse width, 34 Hz pulse repetition frequency, 13.0 mW/cm(2) spatial and temporal average, and 464 W/cm(2) spatial and temporal peak (291 W/cm(2) square wave equivalent) power densities). Corneal-specific absorption rate was 5.07 W/kg (0.39 W/kg/mW/cm(2)). The exposure resulted in a 1.0-1.2 degrees C increase in eyelid temperature. In Experiment I, exposures were 4 h/day, 3 days/week for 3 weeks (nine exposures and 36 h total). In Experiment II, these subjects were pretreated with 0.5% Timolol maleate and 0.005% Xalatan(R) followed by 3 or 7 4-h pulsed microwave exposures. Under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia, a non-contact specular microscope was used to obtain corneal endothelium images, corneal endothelial cell density, and pachymetry at the center and four peripheral areas of the cornea. Ophthalmologic measurements were done before and 7, 30, 90, and 180 days after exposures. Pulsed microwave exposure did not cause alterations in corneal endothelial cell density and corneal thickness with or without ophthalmologic drugs. Therefore, previously reported changes in the cornea exposed to pulsed microwaves were not confirmed at exposure levels that are more than an order of magnitude higher.", 
    "7": "The impact of nebivolol therapy on the renal proximal tubular cell (PTC) structure and function was investigated in a transgenic (TG) rodent model of hypertension and the cardiometabolic syndrome. The TG Ren2 rat develops nephropathy with proteinuria, increased renal angiotensin II levels and oxidative stress, and PTC remodeling. Nebivolol, a beta(1)-antagonist, has recently been shown to reduce albuminuria, in part, through reductions in renal oxidative stress. Accordingly, we hypothesized that nebivolol therapy would attenuate PTC damage and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.", 
    "8": "Young Ren2 (R2-N) and SD (SD-N) rats were treated with nebivolol (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (R2-C; SD-C) for 3 weeks. PTC structure and function were tested using transmission electron microscopy and functional measurements.", 
    "9": "Nebivolol treatment decreased urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, tubulointerstitial ultrastructural remodeling and fibrosis, NADPH oxidase activity, 3-nitrotyrosine levels, and increased megalin and lysosomal-associated membrane protein-2 immunostaining in PTCs. Ultrastructural abnormalities that were improved with therapy included altered canalicular structure, reduced endosomes/lysosomes and PTC vacuoles, basement membrane thickening, and mitochondrial remodeling/fragmentation.",

    "11": "Clinical observations in patients with long QT syndrome carrying sodium channel mutations (LQT3) suggest that bradycardia caused by parasympathetic stimulation may provoke torsades de pointes (TdP). Beta-adrenoceptor blockers appear less effective in LQT3 than in other forms of the disease.", 
    "12": "We studied effects of autonomic modulation on arrhythmias in vivo and in vitro and quantified sympathetic innervation by autoradiography in heterozygous mice with a knock-in deletion (DeltaKPQ) in the Scn5a gene coding for the cardiac sodium channel and increased late sodium current (LQT3 mice). Cholinergic stimulation by carbachol provoked bigemini and TdP in freely roaming LQT3 mice. No arrhythmias were provoked by physical stress, mental stress, isoproterenol, or atropine. In isolated, beating hearts, carbachol did not prolong action potentials per se, but caused bradycardia and rate-dependent action potential prolongation. The muscarinic inhibitor AFDX116 prevented effects of carbachol on heart rate and arrhythmias. beta-Adrenoceptor stimulation suppressed arrhythmias, shortened rate-corrected action potential duration, increased rate, and minimized difference in late sodium current between genotypes. Beta-adrenoceptor density was reduced in LQT3 hearts. Acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade by esmolol, propranolol or chronic propranolol in vivo did not suppress arrhythmias. Chronic flecainide pre-treatment prevented arrhythmias (all P < 0.05).", 
    "13": "Cholinergic stimulation provokes arrhythmias in this model of LQT3 by triggering bradycardia. beta-Adrenoceptor density is reduced, and beta-adrenoceptor blockade does not prevent arrhythmias. Sodium channel blockade and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation suppress arrhythmias by shortening repolarization and minimizing difference in late sodium current.", 
    "14": "Propensity score methods are increasingly being used to estimate the effects of treatments on health outcomes using observational data. There are four methods for using the propensity score to estimate treatment effects: covariate adjustment using the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, propensity-score matching, and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score. When outcomes are binary, the effect of treatment on the outcome can be described using odds ratios, relative risks, risk differences, or the number needed to treat. Several clinical commentators suggested that risk differences and numbers needed to treat are more meaningful for clinical decision making than are odds ratios or relative risks. However, there is a paucity of information about the relative performance of the different propensity-score methods for estimating risk differences. We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations to examine this issue. We examined bias, variance estimation, coverage of confidence intervals, mean-squared error (MSE), and type I error rates. A doubly robust version of IPTW had superior performance compared with the other propensity-score methods. It resulted in unbiased estimation of risk differences, treatment effects with the lowest standard errors, confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates, and correct type I error rates. Stratification, matching on the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score resulted in minor to modest bias in estimating risk differences. Estimators based on IPTW had lower MSE compared with other propensity-score methods. Differences between IPTW and propensity-score matching may reflect that these two methods estimate the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect for the treated, respectively.", 
    "15": "Patients who undergo abdominal surgery present along a variable spectrum of health. This ranges from the healthy young patient undergoing elective hemorrhoid surgery to the octogenarian in unstable health with multiple comorbidities. Regardless of a patient's current state of health, a preoperative assessment is crucial in planning the operative approach and in recognizing the possible postoperative complications for the implementation of a proper intervention if necessary. A broad evaluation of the patient includes identifying conditions that may predispose the patient to risks and the complications not directly related to the surgical procedure. The purpose of this article is to review the preoperative assessment in patients undergoing simple to complex procedures. The article provides general guidelines for the preoperative workup, which should be individualized for each patient, and the planned procedure, with the goal of reducing the postoperative complications. Risk stratification depends on a patient's condition and the extension of the planned surgical approach. It may also help to improve the postoperative outcome. A further preoperative workup should be individualized and tailored to the complexity of each case.", 
    "16": "Cardiomyocytes derived from murine embryonic stem (ES) cells possess various membrane currents and signaling cascades link to that of embryonic hearts. The role of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in regulation of membrane potentials and Ca(2+) currents has not been investigated in developmental cardiomyocytes.", 
    "17": "We investigated the role of ANP in regulating L-type Ca(2+) channel current (I(CaL)) in different developmental stages of cardiomyocytes derived from ES cells. ANP decreased the frequency of action potentials (APs) in early developmental stage (EDS) cardiomyocytes, embryonic bodies (EB) as well as whole embryo hearts. ANP exerted an inhibitory effect on basal I(CaL) in about 70% EDS cardiomyocytes tested but only in about 30% late developmental stage (LDS) cells. However, after stimulation of I(CaL) by isoproterenol (ISO) in LDS cells, ANP inhibited the response in about 70% cells. The depression of I(CaL) induced by ANP was not affected by either Nomega, Nitro-L-Arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthetase (NOS) inhibitor, or KT5823, a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) selective inhibitor, in either EDS and LDS cells; whereas depression of I(CaL) by ANP was entirely abolished by erythro-9-(2-Hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA), a selective inhibitor of type 2 phosphodiesterase(PDE2) in most cells tested. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCES: Taken together, these results indicate that ANP induced depression of action potentials and I(CaL) is due to activation of particulate guanylyl cyclase (GC), cGMP production and cGMP-activation of PDE2 mediated depression of adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophophate (cAMP)-cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in early cardiomyogenesis.", 
    "18": "Anxiety is common after acute myocardial infarction and increases the number of complications and the length of stay in the hospital. Anxiety-induced activation of the sympathetic nervous system is hypothesized to be an underlying cause of increased complication rates. Little is known about whether use of \u03b2-blockers eliminates the effects of anxiety on complication rate and length of stay.",

    "20": "A total of 322 patients with acute myocardial infarction participated in this study within 48 hours of hospital admission. Patients completed the Brief Symptom Inventory to assess anxiety level. After discharge, medical records were reviewed to determine use of \u03b2-blockers, type and number of complications, and length of stay.", 
    "21": "Most patients (96%) were treated with less than 200 mg daily of metoprolol. Anxious patients had more complications (mean [SD], 1.43 [0.15] vs 0.73 [.09], P \u2264 .01) and longer stays (7.0 [0.49] vs 5.7 [0.36] days, P < .05) than did nonanxious patients. To test whether the dose of \u03b2-blocker made a difference, the interaction between daily dose and anxiety score was tested. No interaction was found between metoprolol dose and anxiety score, and no main effect was found for metoprolol dose.", 
    "22": "Anxious patients had more complications and longer stays than did nonanxious patients. The administration of metoprolol did not eliminate this relationship, perhaps because patients did not receive a sufficient dose of metoprolol to counter the effect of anxiety.",

We aimed to determine the prevalence of arrhythmias and efficacy of beta-blocker treatment in mutation-positive family members diagnosed by cascade genetic screening.", 
    "24": "Relatives of six unrelated CPVT patients were tested for the relevant mutation in the ryanodine receptor-2 gene. Mutation carriers underwent an exercise test at inclusion time and 3 months after the initiation of beta-blocker therapy in the highest tolerable dose. The occurrence of ventricular premature beats, couplets, and non-sustained ventricular arrhythmias (nsVT) were recorded in addition to the heart rate at which they occurred. Thirty family members were mutation carriers and were followed for 22 (13-288) months. Previous undiagnosed CPVT-related symptoms were reported by eight subjects. Exercise test induced ventricular arrhythmias in 23 of the 30 mutation carriers. On beta-blocker treatment, exercise-induced arrhythmias occurred at a lower heart rate (117 +/- 17 vs. 135 +/- 34 beats/min, P = 0.02) but at similar workload (P = 0.78). Beta-blocker treatment suppressed the occurrence of exercise-induced nsVT in three of the four patients, while less severe arrhythmias were unchanged. One patient died during follow-up.",

    "27": "Tartaric acid, metoprolol free base and metoprolol tartrate act as plasticisers for Eudragit RL, in the dry but also in the wet state. Fitting analytical solutions of Fick's second law of diffusion allowed for the determination of the apparent diffusivities of water and of tartaric acid, metoprolol free base and metoprolol tartrate upon exposure of thin films to 0.1M HCl, phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and distilled water. Based on these calculations, it could be shown that water penetration into the systems is predominantly controlled by pure diffusion, irrespective of the type of bulk fluid. Interestingly, the plasticising effect of metoprolol tartrate was much more pronounced than that of tartaric acid, resulting in monotonically increasing diffusion coefficients with increasing initial drug content. In contrast, the plasticising activity of metoprolol free base was very limited in the wet state, due to drug precipitation in aqueous environments. Partially observed film shrinking (after an initial system swelling) could be attributed to the leaching of the plasticising compound into the release medium, resulting in less flexible polymeric networks and squeezing out of water. Also the release of tartaric acid, metoprolol free base and metoprolol tartrate into the investigated bulk fluids was predominantly diffusion controlled. However, the precipitation of the free base in wet films rendered the mass transport mechanisms more complex, at moderate and high initial drug loadings. The obtained new insight into the underlying drug release mechanisms in Eudragit RL networks can help to facilitate the optimisation of this type of dosage forms.",

    "29": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed in 32 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy before and 8 +/- 2 months after therapy. Patients were assigned clinically to beta-blocker therapy (n = 20) or revascularization (n = 12). CMR at baseline was performed to assess regional and global LV function at rest and under low-dose dobutamine. Wall thickening was analyzed in dysfunctional, adjacent, and remote segments. Follow-up CMR included rest function evaluation.", 
    "30": "Augmentation of wall thickening during dobutamine at baseline was similar in dysfunctional, adjacent and remote segments in both patient groups. Therefore, baseline characteristics were similar for both patient groups. In both patient groups resting LV ejection fraction and end-systolic volume improved significantly (p < 0.05) at follow-up. Stepwise multivariate analysis revealed that improvement in global LV ejection fraction in the beta-blocker treated patients was significantly related to improved function of remote myocardium (p < 0.05), whereas in the revascularized patients improved function in dysfunctional and adjacent segments was more pronounced (p < 0.05).", 
    "31": "In patients with chronic ischemic LV dysfunction, beta-Blocker therapy or revascularization resulted in a similar improvement of global systolic LV function. However, after beta-blocker therapy, improved global systolic function was mainly related to improved contraction of remote myocardium, whereas after revascularization the dysfunctional and adjacent regions contributed predominantly to the improved global systolic function.", 
    "32": "In the mid-1990s, significant gaps existed in the quality of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) care between rural and urban hospitals. Since then, overall AMI care quality has improved. This study uses more recent data to determine whether rural-urban AMI quality gaps have persisted.", 
    "33": "Using inpatient records data for 34,776 Medicare beneficiaries with AMI from 2000-2001, unadjusted and logistic regression analysis compared receipt of 5 recommended treatments between admissions to urban, large rural, small rural, and isolated small rural hospitals as defined by Rural Urban Commuting Area codes.",

Admissions to small rural and isolated small rural hospitals were least likely to receive most treatments (eg, 69.2% urban, 68.3% large rural, 59.9% small rural, 53.4% isolated small rural received discharge beta-blocker prescriptions). Adjusted analyses found no treatment differences between admissions to large rural and urban area hospitals, but admissions to small rural and isolated small rural hospitals had lower rates of discharge prescriptions such as aspirin and beta-blockers than urban hospital admissions.", 
    "35": "Many simple guidelines that improve AMI outcomes are inadequately implemented, regardless of geographic location. In small rural and isolated small rural hospitals, addressing barriers to prescription of beneficial discharge medications is particularly important. The best quality improvement practices should be identified and translated to the broadest range of institutions and providers.", 
    "36": "In the present study, we evaluated cardiac baroreflex responses of rats submitted to acute restraint stress. The baroreflex was tested: immediately before, during a 30 min exposure to restraint stress, as well as 30 and 60 min after ending the stress session (recovery period). Restraint increased both mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). The magnitude of tachycardiac responses evoked by intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside was higher during restraint stress, whereas that of bradycardiac responses evoked by intravenous infusion of phenylephrine was decreased. Restraint-evoked baroreflex changes were still observed at 30 min into the recovery period, although MAP and HR values had already returned to control values. The baroreflex was back to control values at 60 min of the recovery period. Intravenous administration of the selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol blocked the restraint-evoked increase in the tachycardiac baroreflex response, but did not affect the effects on the bradycardiac response. In conclusion, the present results suggest that psychological stresses, such as those resulting from acute restraint, affect the baroreflex. Restraint facilitated the tachycardiac baroreflex response and reduced the bradycardiac response. Restraint-related effects on baroreflex persisted for at least 30 min after ending restraint, although MAP and HR had already returned to control levels. The cardiac baroreflex returned to control values 60 min after the end of restraint, indicating non-persistent effects of acute restraint on the baroreflex. Results also indicate that the influence of restraint stress on the baroreflex tachycardiac response is mainly dependent on cardiac sympathetic activity, whereas the action on the bradycardiac response is mediated by the cardiac parasympathetic component.",

A net-benefit regression model was used to derive the propensity score-adjusted cost-effectiveness curve. The incremental cost effectiveness of eplerenone in cost per life-year gained (LYG) and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained beyond the trial period was estimated using data from the Framingham Heart Study, the Saskatchewan Health database, and the Worcester Heart Attack Registry.

    "47": "Here we examine the effect of adding carvedilol (CVD) to University of Wisconsin (UW) solution on the preservation of steatotic and nonsteatotic livers during cold ischemia and after normothermic reperfusion. We used an isolated perfused rat liver model. The following protocols were evaluated. Protocol 1 concerned the effect of CVD after cold ischemia. Steatotic and nonsteatotic livers were preserved for 24 hours in UW solution alone or with CVD. Livers without cold ischemia were used as controls. Transaminases were evaluated in the flushing effluent. Protocol 2 involved the effect of CVD after reperfusion. Both liver types were preserved for 24 hours in UW solution alone or with CVD and then perfused ex vivo for 2 hours at 37 degrees C. Livers flushed and perfused without ischemia were used as controls. Hepatic injury and functionality [transaminases, bile production, and hepatic clearance of sulfobromophthalein (BSP)] were evaluated after reperfusion. In addition, factors potentially involved in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury, including oxidative stress (malondialdehyde and superoxide anion levels), mitochondrial damage (glutamate dehydrogenase activity), microcirculatory disorders (flow rate and vascular resistance), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, were evaluated after reperfusion. After cold ischemia, steatotic livers preserved in UW solution showed higher transaminase levels than nonsteatotic livers. After reperfusion, steatotic livers preserved in UW solution showed higher transaminase levels and lower bile production and BSP clearance than nonsteatotic livers. Alterations in the perfusion flow rate and vascular resistance, mitochondrial damage, and reduced ATP content were more evident in steatotic livers preserved in UW solution. The addition of CVD to UW solution reduced hepatic injury, obstructed its mechanisms, and improved hepatic functionality in both liver types. We conclude that CVD is a useful additive for UW solution that improves the preservation of steatotic and nonsteatotic livers subjected to prolonged cold ischemia.", 
    "48": "Paraplegia is a devastating and unpredictable complication occasionally resulting from surgery of the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta. Because ultrashort-acting selective beta(1)-adrenoreceptor antagonists provide neuroprotective effects after brain ischemia, we hypothesized that they would also ameliorate spinal cord injury after transient ischemia and reperfusion in rats.",

Infusion of saline or drugs was initiated 30 minutes before spinal cord ischemia and continued for the subsequent 24-hour reperfusion. Spinal cord ischemia was induced by intraaortic balloon occlusion combined with proximal arterial hypotension for 10 minutes. The spinal cord was then reperfused for 24 hours. Ischemic injury was assessed in terms of the motor deficit index score of the hindlimb and the number of viable motor nerve cells in the anterior spinal cord at 24 hours after reperfusion.", 
    "50": "The motor deficit index scores were significantly lower in the esmolol and landiolol groups compared with the saline group (P < 0.05). Histopathologic evaluation of the spinal cord showed less damage in the esmolol and landiolol groups than in the saline group (P < 0.05).",

    "52": "Beta blockers are empirically used in many patients with heart failure (HF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) because they allow more time for diastolic filling and because they improve outcomes in patients with systolic HF. However, recent data suggest that impaired chronotropic and vasodilator responses to exercise, which can worsen with beta blockade, may play a key role in the pathophysiology of HFpEF. We prospectively examined the association between beta-blocker therapy after hospitalization for decompensated HF and HF rehospitalization at 6 months in 66 consecutive patients with HFpEF (71 +/- 13 years old, 68% women, 42% Black). Subjects were stratified based on receiving (BB+; 15 men, 28 women) or not receiving (BB-) beta-blockers at hospital discharge. In men, HF rehospitalization occurred less frequently in the BB+ than in the BB- group, albeit nonsignificantly (20% vs 50%, p = 0.29). In women, HF rehospitalization occurred more frequently in the BB+ than in the BB- group (75% vs 18%, p <0.001). In univariate analyses, discharge beta-blocker was associated with HF rehospitalization in women (odds ratio [OR] 14.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.09 to 63.51, p = 0.001), but not in men (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.92, p = 0.18). In a forward logistic regression model that offered all univariate predictors of HF rehospitalization, discharge beta blocker remained an independent predictor of HF rehospitalization in women (OR 11.06, 95% CI 1.98 to 61.67, p = 0.006). In conclusion, this small observational study suggests that beta-blocker therapy may be associated with a higher risk of HF rehospitalization in women with HFpEF. The risks and benefits of beta-blocker therapy in patients with HFpEF should be evaluated in randomized, controlled trials.", 
    "53": "Heart failure (HF) is a common public health problem, and many new cases are now recognized to occur in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. beta Blockers improve the outcomes of patients with known left ventricular systolic dysfunction, but whether beta blockers provide similar protection among patients with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is unclear. We studied the association between use of beta blockers and subsequent hospitalization for HF in patients with diastolic dysfunction and stable coronary heart disease. We evaluated medication use and performed echocardiography at baseline in a prospective cohort of 911 outpatients with known coronary heart disease from the Heart and Soul Study. Hospitalizations for HF were assessed by blinded review of the medical records during an average follow-up of 5.2 years. Of the 911 participants, 118 (13%) had diastolic dysfunction, of whom 2 were lost to follow-up. Of the 116 remaining patients, 19 (25%) of the 77 using beta blockers were hospitalized for HF compared to 16 (41%) of the 39 not using beta blockers (age-adjusted hazard ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.26 to 1.00; p = 0.05). This association remained after additional adjustment for gender, smoking, history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, and creatinine (hazard ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.93; p = 0.03). The results were similar after excluding 31 participants with a history of self-reported HF (hazard ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.86; p = 0.02) and 24 participants with concurrent systolic dysfunction (hazard ratio 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 0.89; p = 0.03). In conclusion, the use of beta blockers is associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization for HF in patients with diastolic dysfunction and stable coronary heart disease.", 
    "54": "Even after successful repair, hypertension is one of the main determinants of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with aortic coarctation (CoA). We compared the effect of candesartan (angiotensin II receptor blockade) and metoprolol (beta-adrenergic receptor blockade) on blood pressure, large artery stiffness, and neurohormonal status in hypertensive patients after repair of CoA. In the present open-label, crossover study, hypertensive patients after CoA repair were first randomly assigned to treatment with candesartan 8 mg or metoprolol 100 mg once per day. After 8 weeks of treatment with one of the drugs, the other treatment was given for 8 weeks. The treatment effects were assessed with 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, measurement of large artery stiffness, and neurohormonal plasma levels at baseline and after 8 weeks of either treatment. Sixteen patients (mean age 37 +/- 12 years, 26 +/- 15 years after repair, 63% men) completed the study. The 24-hour mean arterial pressure at baseline was 97.7 +/- 6.2 mm Hg. Metoprolol (mean dose 163 +/- 50 mg/day) decreased the mean arterial pressure (7.0 +/- 4.2 and 4.1 +/- 3.6 mm Hg, respectively) more than did candesartan (mean dose 13 +/- 4 mg/day; p = 0.018, 95% confidence interval 0.6 to 5.5). Large artery stiffness did not change with either treatment. With metoprolol, plasma B-type natriuretic peptide increased and plasma renin decreased. With candesartan, the plasma renin and noradrenaline levels increased and aldosterone levels decreased. In conclusion, in adult hypertensive patients after CoA repair, metoprolol had more of an antihypertensive effect than did candesartan. Moreover, the neurohormonal outcome did not support a significant role for the renin-angiotensin system in the causative mechanism of hypertension after CoA.", 
    "55": "beta Blockers are widely used to improve the postoperative cardiac outcome in patients with coronary artery disease scheduled for noncardiac surgery. However, recently serious concerns regarding the safety of perioperative beta blockers have emerged. To assess the incidence, risk factors, and beta-blocker use associated with postoperative stroke in the Dutch Echocardiographic Cardiac Risk Evaluation Applying Stress Echocardiography (DECREASE) trials, we evaluated all 3,884 patients of the DECREASE trials for postoperative stroke. All cardiac risk factors and medication use were assessed. The incidence of stroke within 30 days after surgery was recorded. The incidence of postoperative stroke in the DECREASE trials was 0.46% (18 of 3,884). For the beta-blocker users, the incidence was 0.5%. All the strokes had an ischemic origin. A history of stroke was associated with a greater incidence of postoperative stroke (odds ratio [OR] 3.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 11.6). Statins and anticoagulants were not associated with postoperative stroke (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.3 to 2.4; and OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.4 to 4.6, respectively). No association with bisoprolol therapy was found (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.4 to 3.4).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of long duration beta-adrenergic blockade treatment for hypertension control, on autonomic cardiovascular control in a 78-year-old male patient in relation to population findings. Heart rate variability was determined in the frequency domain (Total power, low frequency power and high frequency power), during baseline (supine and standing) and during 24 hour Holter recording. Results were compared with heart rate and heart rate variability data obtained from a normal healthy male population as a function of age. Circadian rhythm remained present. Heart rate during daytime was lower compared to the population group. None of the heart rate variability parameters were different from the normal population age group. Our results show that after 35 years of beta-blockade treatment, autonomic modulation of cardiac function remains within normal limits for that age group.

    "65": "Presentation, response to therapy, and clinical outcome differ according to race for patients with hypertension. Black patients have a higher prevalence and earlier onset of hypertension than other ethnic groups, with poorer prognosis than white patients. Blacks are more likely to be salt-sensitive, and to have a low plasma renin activity than are whites. They are at much greater risk of developing cardiovascular and renal complications. Despite many advances in the understanding and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, black patients continue to have increased morbidity and mortality from the end-organ complications of hypertension. The explanations for these observations remain incompletely understood, but genetic differences, added to socio-economic and environmental factors, have been proposed to explain this disparity. The first therapeutic approach is to decrease salt and increase potassium intakes. Diuretics (thiazides and potassium-sparing agents) and calcium channel blockers constitute the first antihypertensive drug choices. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, the angiotensin II receptor blockers and beta-blockers appear to be less effective in blacks with regard to uncomplicated hypertension, especially in older people, but addition of a small dose of diuretic improves their efficacy. These combinations are preferred among patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure. The goal for blood pressure target is the same in blacks as it is in whites, being a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mmHg in uncomplicated hypertension and less than 130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease.",

A 30-year-old pregnant woman with Marfan syndrome in the 38th week of gestation was referred to our department for an emergency Cesarean section because of development of acute aortic dissection. Blood pressure (BP) decreased from 157/70 to 128/64 mmHg after giving nicardipine and nitroglycerin. However, heartrate (HR) increased from 112 to 145 bpm, which was reduced to 105 bpm with landiolol, while BP was maintained. A Cesarean section was performed without complications under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. Hemodynamic state, uterine contraction, and the extent of aortic dissection remained stable. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient and her baby were discharged safely. Landiolol was useful for reduction of HR without affecting BP or uterine contractions during a Cesarean section procedure in our patient with aortic dissection.",

We enrolled 788 subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension treated with a beta-blocker for > or = 4 weeks before screening. After washout, 500 subjects with a baseline mean intraocular pressure (IOP) > or = 26 and < 37 mmHg were randomized to fixed combination latanoprost-timolol in the evening (n = 170), latanoprost monotherapy in the evening (n = 165), or timolol monotherapy in the morning (n = 165). At weeks 2, 6, and 12, each subject's IOP level was measured in triplicate at 8 AM (predose), 10 AM, and 4 PM in each eye. Adverse events were monitored throughout. The statistical superiority of the fixed combination for the 18 pairwise comparisons with the 2 monotherapies was evaluated (analysis of variance). RESULTS. The statistical superiority of the fixed combination was demonstrated at 7/9 time points versus latanoprost and 9/9 time points versus timolol. Mean diurnal IOP levels were similar at baseline but significantly lower with the fixed combination than with either monotherapy at weeks 6 and 12 (each p < 0.05). Patients treated with the fixed combination were significantly more likely than those treated with either monotherapy to reach prespecified percent IOP reductions at the upper thresholds and to achieve very low target diurnal IOP levels. All therapies were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS. Fixed combination latanoprost/timolol safely reduces IOP levels in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, though only slightly more than does latanoprost monotherapy.",

Much attention has been recently paid to the effects of other medicines on mechanisms important in the pathogenesis of asthma, including beta-blockers and statins. Many researchers have suggested a potentially useful role of some beta-blockers in chronic asthma therapy, particularly considering their effect on the pharmacodynamics of beta receptors in the bronchi.

The contemporary presence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO), systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet, and acute mitral regurgitation might explain the worsening of the heart failure or the occurrence of cardiogenic shock in some patients with apical ballooning syndrome. The use of beta-blockers should improve the LVOTO gradient by reducing basal hypercontractility, increasing left ventricular filling and size, and reducing heart rate. However, clear evidence of the direct haemodynamic effects of beta-blockers is still lacking. We present a case of apical ballooning syndrome complicated by dynamic LVOTO, treated with metoprolol.",

    "81": "Improvement in cognitive scores in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been reported in two trials in which intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) preparations were administered. IvIg's benefits in AD patients have been suggested to be due to antibodies to amyloid-beta (Abeta). Our previous study using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicated that much of IvIg's apparent binding to Abeta1-42 is nonspecific; it is detectable even when IvIg is incubated on \"specificity controls\" (bovine serum albumin [BSA] and Abeta reverse sequence Abeta42-1) rather than Abeta1-42. The objective of this study was to evaluate procedures that might reduce this nonspecific binding. The IvIg preparation used was Gamunex (Talecris Biotherapeutics). Multiple blocking agents were evaluated, but even the most effective blocker only reduced nonspecific binding by 48%. Dissociating Gamunex's antibody-antigen complexes had no effect on specific binding when Abeta42-1 was used as the specificity control, although it increased this binding when BSA was the specificity control. Decreasing Gamunex's dilution from 1:1,500 to 1:500 resulted in a slight (7.4%) but significant (p=0.027) increase in specific binding. Using a sandwich ELISA to measure Gamunex's anti-Abeta antibodies resulted in even less specific binding to Abeta1-42 than with the indirect ELISA. Despite Gamunex's low percentage of specific binding to Abeta1-42, it inhibited Abeta oligomer formation. We conclude that, when anti-Abeta antibodies in IvIg are measured by indirect ELISA, extensive nonspecific binding occurs despite procedures taken to prevent it. This must be subtracted from total binding to accurately measure specific anti-Abeta antibody concentrations.",

For comprehensive forensic-toxicological analysis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was accomplished in positive as well as in negative ion mode on a quadrupole-quadrupole-time-of-flight instrument. Dissolved samples were introduced into the mass spectrometer by flow-injection. Mass spectra as well as tandem mass spectra were acquired. A data-dependent acquisition strategy was used to switch between the mass spectrometric modes. Identification was accomplished via search within a tandem mass spectral library. The applied database contained 8252 spectra collected from 836 compounds in positive ion mode as well as 1023 spectra collected from 103 compounds in negative ion mode. A total of 22 casework samples collected during autopsies from mouth, oesophagus or gastric contents, seized by the police, or found with patients at hospital were screened.

    "83": "People with high level spinal cord injury (SCI) suffer from both hypotension and spontaneous hypertension due to loss of supraspinal control of spinal sympathetic outflow. Few reports have addressed whether any changes occur in central regulation of blood pressure (BP) and heart rat (HR) at the supraspinal level. Central tachykinin NK-1 and NK-3 receptors are located in many cardiovascular areas in the brain and are known to modulate BP and HR. This study examined the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) effects of the selective NK-1 receptor agonist [Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)]SP (65pmol, n=6) and NK-3 receptor agonist senktide (650pmol, n=6) on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR before and after complete spinal cord transection at thoracic level 4 (T4). [Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)]SP evoked increases in MAP and HR which were still present 4days after the T4 SCI. Further analysis using the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (10mgkg(-1)) revealed an increased contribution of HR in the MAP increase after SCI. For senktide, 2 and 5weeks after T4 SCI, the rise in MAP induced by senktide was significantly increased in magnitude and was similar to a normal response at 8weeks. These effects were accompanied by a bradycardia, which was still present and amplified at 8weeks. Our results reveal a transient potentiation of the senktide-mediated MAP effect and a greater contribution of the HR in MAP increase by [Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)]SP in T4 transected rats. Although the significance of these changes remains to be established. This suggest a reorganization of supraspinal mechanisms regulating BP and HR after a high level SCI. Central NK-1 and NK-3 receptors might therefore contribute to the maintenance of MAP following high thoracic SCI.", 
    "84": "Several first-line antihypertensive drugs, including calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers, undergo metabolism through different CYP isoforms. As a consequence of CYP-dependent metabolism, wide interindividual variability of plasma concentrations of antihypertensive drugs has been found in clinical practice compromising blood pressure lowering response and clinical outcomes. Several factors, including aging, hepatic impairment, drug interactions, conditions affecting hepatic blood supply and polymorphisms, contribute to changes in oral and systemic clearance affecting drug exposure during antihypertensive therapy and cardiovascular response. Considering that the degree of blood pressure reduction is related to antihypertensive drug plasma concentrations, a greater knowledge of the sources of pharmacokinetic variability of hepatically eliminated antihypertensive drugs and the applicability of an individualized approach in hypertension management by means of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and pharmacogenetic testing could enhance blood pressure lowering response to pharmacological therapy. The aim of the present review is to discuss the relevance of drug metabolism in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "85": "A functional test using Daphnia magna Straus hydrobionts is proposed for studying the role of intermediatory relationships in the heart rate (HR) regulation. It is established that the M-cholinomimetic carbamylcholine increases for two hours and decreases after 24 hours the HR in D. magna. Caffeine (a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptors) potentiates the action of carbamylcholine during the first hour and then ceases to influence the drug effect. Caffeine normalizes the HR rate D magna, which was decreased by the cholinolytic atropine and the beta-adrenolytic atenolol. The possibilities of using the proposed test for the investigation of intermediatory relationships in the HR regulation, rapid analysis of the cardiothropic action of xenobiotics, and the primary screening of drugs for the pharmacological correction of HR disturbances are discussed.", 
    "86": "Carvedilol is a potent noncardioselective beta-blocker, with weak vasodilating properties because of alpha 1 blockade. A reduction in both intrahepatic and portocollateral resistance contribute to enhanced effects on portal pressure. There are 10 published hemodynamic studies involving 168 patients investigating the role of carvedilol in portal hypertension. A reduction in the hepatic venous pressure gradient of up to 43% (range 10-43%) has been reported, particularly after chronic administration. However, tolerability at doses greater than 12.5 mg/day was comprised because of a fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP), particularly in ascitic patients. Carvedilol was more effective than propranolol in reducing hepatic venous pressure gradient in two of three studies, albeit with a greater decrease in MAP. One study showed deterioration of pre-existing ascites with carvedilol. The addition of nitrates to propranolol was less effective than carvedilol monotherapy in another study. A large multicentre, randomized controlled trial comparing carvedilol with variceal band ligation for the prevention of variceal bleeding has been published. Carvedilol resulted in fewer episodes of bleeding, although there was no difference in survival. Carvedilol was well tolerated. Carvedilol is a promising agent, and seems to be more effective than propranolol in hemodynamic studies. The efficacy in primary prevention of variceal bleeding suggests that carvedilol has a role in the management of clinically significant portal hypertension.", 
    "87": "Hypertension is present in most patients with end-stage renal disease and likely contributes to the premature cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients. Previous practice guidelines have recommended that, in patients on chronic dialysis, blood pressure (BP) should be reduced below 130/80 mm Hg. This is based on opinions but not strong evidence, since no concrete information exists about which BP values should be the parameter to follow and which should be the target BP values. The majority of the antihypertensive agents can be used in this population, but the pharmacokinetics altered by the impaired kidney function and dialyzability influence the appropriate dosage as well as the time and frequency of administration. Combination therapy using multiple agents is often necessary. Because of the prevalence of overactivity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic tone as well as the high calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle cells in dialysis patients, drugs acting in these three specific systems may potentially have additional cardioprotective benefits beyond their BP-lowering effect. Thus, antihypertensive regimens should preferably be based on these classes of drugs, alone or in combination. Other antihypertensive drug classes can play a complementary role.",

The BP reduction from adding a beta-blocker as the second drug was estimated by comparing the difference in BP reduction between the combination and monotherapy groups. A reduction in BP was seen with adding a beta-blocker to thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers at doses as low as 0.25 times the manufacturer's recommended starting dose. The BP lowering efficacy of beta-blockers as a second drug was 6/4 mmHg at 1 times the starting dose and 8/6 mmHg at 2 times the starting dose. Beta-blockers reduced heart rate by 10 beats/min at 1 to 2 times the starting dose. Beta-blockers did not statistically significantly increase withdrawals due to adverse effects but this was likely due to the lack of reporting of this outcome in 35% of the included RCTs.", 
    "94": "Addition of a beta-blocker to diuretics or calcium-channel blockers reduces BP by 6/4mmHg at 1 times the starting dose and by 8/6 mmHg at 2 times the starting dose. When the blood pressure lowering effect of beta-blockers from this review was compared to that of thiazide diuretics from our previous review (Chen 2009), second-line beta-blockers reduce systolic BP to the same extent as second-line thiazide diuretics, but reduce diastolic BP to a greater degree. The different effect on diastolic BP means that beta-blockers have little or no effect on pulse pressure whereas thiazides cause a significant dose-related decrease in pulse pressure. This difference in the pattern of BP lowering with beta-blockers as compared to thiazides might be the explanation for the fact that beta-blockers appear to be less effective at reducing adverse cardiovascular outcomes than thiazide diuretics, particularly in older individuals.", 
    "95": "The amino acid sequences of the human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A9 and 1A10 are 93% identical, yet there are large differences in their activity and substrate selectivity. For example, the regioselectivity in propranolol glucuronidation, the regioselectivity in dobutamine glucuronidation, and the glucuronidation rate of alpha- and beta-estradiol differ greatly between UGT1A9 and UGT1A10. To identify the residue responsible for the activity differences, we divided the N-terminal half of the two UGTs into five comparable segments by inserting four unique restriction sites at identical positions in both genes and constructing chimeras in which segments of UGT1A9 were individually replaced by the corresponding segments from UGT1A10. Activity analyses of the resulting mutants, 910A [1A10((1-83))/1A9((84-285))], 910B [1A9((1-83))/1A10((84-147))/1A9((148-285))], 910C [1A9((1-147))/1A10((148-181))/1A9((182-285))], 910D [1A9((1-181))/1A10((182-235))/1A9((236-285))], and 910E [1A9((1-235))/1A10((236-285))] indicated that more than one residue is responsible for the differences between UGT1A9 and UGT1A10. We next prepared four double chimeras, in which two of the above UGT1A9 segments were replaced simultaneously by the corresponding UGT1A10 segments. However, none of the double chimeras glucuronidated either estradiol, propranolol, or dobutamine at rates that resembled those of UGT1A10. On the other hand, studying the kinetics of 1-naphthol glucuronidation yielded more focused results, indicating that residues within segment B (84-147) contribute directly to the K(m) value for this substrate. Further mutagenesis and activity assays suggested that Phe117 of UGT1A9 participates in 1-naphthol binding. In addition, it appears that residues within segment C of the N-terminal domain, mainly at positions 152 and 169, contribute to the higher glucuronidation rates of UGT1A10.", 
    "96": "Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is an unusual complication of hyperthyroidism that frequently presents in a dramatic fashion, necessitating treatment in an emergency department or admission to an intensive care unit. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is characterized by transient, recurrent episodes of flaccid muscle paralysis affecting proximal more severely than distal muscles. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is most commonly a complication of Graves' disease in Asian males, although in recent decades, an increasing number of patients from all racial and ethnic backgrounds have been reported. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis has a higher predilection for men than women despite the fact that thyroid disease is more frequently diagnosed in women. The presence of both hypokalemia and elevated levels of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are important diagnostic features during the acute episode. Treatment of TPP involves 2 steps, immediate action to reverse the paralysis followed by measures to prevent future attacks by restoration of a euthyroid state. Although the mainstay of treating an acute attack of TPP is correction of hypokalemia to avoid fatal cardiac arrhythmias and reverse muscle weakness, it must be appreciated by treating physicians that patients with TPP do not have a total body deficiency of potassium. Close attention must be given to potassium replacement as overly aggressive treatment can result in hyperkalemia. Correction of hypokalemia and the underlying thyrotoxic state usually results in amelioration of the acute attack. This review summarizes the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of TPP.",

Patients with heart failure randomized to high-dose losartan treatment (150 mg) in the HEAAL study had a reduced risk of death or heart failure hospitalization compared with patients in the low-dose (50 mg) group. In FAIR-HF, patients with heart failure and concomitant iron deficiency but without severe anaemia who received iron supplementation therapy demonstrated an improvement in symptoms at 24 weeks compared with placebo.

Treatment of infarcted animals with these agents also attenuated the MI-induced depression in myofibrillar Ca(2+) -stimulated ATPase activity and phosphorylated cTnI protein content. The MI-induced decrease in \u03b1-MHC and increase in \u03b2-MHC protein content were attenuated by both atenolol and propranolol at low and high doses; however, only high dose of propranolol was effective in mitigating changes in the gene expression for \u03b1-MHC and \u03b2-MHC.

Only 4% (8/198) of the conjunctival specimens were positive to Tyrosinase immunostaining, with no statistically significant difference among the groups (P=0.449). In all cases, the proportion of positive cells was below 4%. When compared with subjects having negative specimens, those with positive immunostains did not show any statistically significant difference in skin complexion, eye color or exposure to irritants, and ultraviolet (P>0.05).",

    "158": "During induction of general anesthesia hypertension and tachycardia caused by tracheal intubation may lead to cardiac ischemia and arrhythmias. In this prospective, randomized study, dexmedetomidine has been used to attenuate the hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation with low dose fentanyl and etomidate in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization receiving beta blocker treatment. Thirty patients undergoing myocardial revascularization received in a double blind manner, either a saline placebo or a dexmedetomidine infusion (1 microg/kg) before the anesthesia induction. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored at baseline, after placebo or dexmedetomidine infusion, after induction of general anesthesia, one, three and five minutes after endotracheal intubation. In the dexmedetomidine (DEX) group systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP) and mean arterial pressures (MAP) were lower at all times in comparison to baseline values; in the placebo (PLA) group SAP, DAP and MAP decreased after the induction of general anesthesia and five minutes after the intubation compared to baseline values. This decrease was not significantly different between the groups. After the induction of general anesthesia, the drop in HR was higher in DEX group compared to PLA group. One minute after endotracheal intubation, HR significantly increased in PLA group while, it decreased in the DEX group. The incidence of tachycardia, hypotension and bradycardia was not different between the groups. The incidence of hypertension requiring treatment was significantly greater in the PLA group. It is concluded that dexmedetomidine can safely be used to attenuate the hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization receiving beta blockers.",

Patients with ED had longer time since the diagnosis of hypertension and higher prevalence of risk factors and comorbidities. The prevalence of ED increased linearly with age. ED patients received more medications and were more frequently treated with carvedilol and less frequently with nebivolol.

This is the first report of treating infantile airway hemangiomas with only propranolol without additional surgical intervention or corticosteroid use. Review of literature reveals initial case series with similar, successful results using propranolol as an adjuvant treatment along with other medications and surgical interventions. We conclude that the initial use of propranolol as the sole treatment for infantile airway hemangioma is promising. Literature review reveals that propranolol as the sole treatment for most head and neck hemangiomas shows significant promise based on early case reports.

Altering the polymer combinations did not affect the physical properties of the buccal tablets. However, the presence of SCMC and sodium alginate at 1:2 ratio in the tablet showed a sustained drug release. In addition, this polymer combination at 2:1 ratio did release the drug completely during the stipulated dissolution time. Swelling study indicated the tablet structure collapse over time at 2:1 polymer ratio, thus exposing the drug molecules directly to the dissolution medium to attain the complete drug release from the SCMC and sodium alginate-based tablets. On the other hand, whatever the polymer ratios, the SCMC and carbopol 974P combination always retarded the drug release in an almost similar manner. Though the SCMC- and carbopol 974P-based tablets did display an impressive mucoadhesion property, the surface pH value determined for this polymer combination was found to decrease considerably due to the liberation of the free carboxylic acid over the time period.",

To evaluate chronic hormonal and pharmaceutical mediated changes in ASP and potential mechanisms, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with physiological concentrations of relevant hormones and drugs currently used in treatment of metabolic diseases for 48 h. Medium ASP production and C3 secretion were evaluated in relation to changes in adipocyte lipid metabolism (cellular triglyceride (TG) mass, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) release and real-time FA uptake). Chylomicrons increased ASP production (up to 411 +/- 133% P < 0.05), while leptin, triiodothyronine, and beta-blockers atenolol and propranolol had no effect. Dexamethasone, lovastatin, rosiglitazone and rimonabant decreased ASP production (-53 to -85%, P < 0.05), associated with a decrease in the precursor protein C3 (-37% to -65%, P < 0.01). By contrast, epinephrine, progesterone, testosterone, angiotensin II and metformin also decreased ASP (-54% to -100%, P < 0.05), but without change in precursor protein C3, suggesting a direct effect on convertase activity, possibly mediated by interference (except metformin) due to marked increases in NEFA (5.6-31-fold, increased P < 0.05). Both lovastatin and metformin induced decreases in ASP were also associated with decreased TG mass (maximal -60%, P < 0.05) and real-time FA uptake (maximum -75%, P < 0.05), suggesting a change in adipocyte differentiation status. These in vitro results are consistent with in vivo ASP profiles in subjects, and suggest that ASP may be regulated through precursor C3 availability, convertase activity and differentiation status.",

The groups were matched according to age, gender, and frequency of migraine attacks prior to treatment. The period of treatment was two months and the frequency and intensity of headache attacks of the 30 days pre-treatment period were compared with the frequency of headaches in the treatment period. Fourteen patients in groups A and B and sixteen patients in group C have completed the study. Treatment with propranolol, alone or in combination, was shown to be effective. Treatment with nortriptyline alone was not effective. All three therapeutic regimens were safe and side effects were minimal. The frequency of discontinuation of the study was the same in the 3 groups but no patient left the study due to adverse reactions. The combined therapy proved to be as safe as the monotherapy. Further studies evaluating this and other possible combinations of drugs in higher doses and for longer periods, should more clearly elucidate the role of combined therapy in the treatment of migraine.",

Similarly, the recovery (%) in developed tension and heart rate were significantly more in treated groups during post-ischemia when compared to control. Moreover, GH-250 either alone or with PRO showed significant increase in activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase during IRI damage. However, GH-500 failed to show cardioprotective effect when given alone or along with PRO. These biochemical findings were supported by changes in histopathological studies.",

The vast majority of daily headache is nonparoxysmal, or chronic daily headache. In the general population, the distribution of chronic tension-type headache and chronic migraine is fairly equal, but in medical practice chronic migraine accounts for the vast majority of nonparoxysmal daily headache. The first step in the management of chronic daily headache is to identify potential overuse of analgesic and vasoconstrictor medications. Preventive treatment is then initiated with a tricyclic antidepressant, beta-blocker, calcium-entry blocker, and/or anticonvulsant. Chronic migraine patients who are refractory to specific headache treatment may take a triptan frequently, if not daily, or a (long-acting) opioid. Both management strategies of refractory daily headache are controversial but appear safe and effective, although daily opioid treatment should be reserved for a relatively small, selected subpopulation. Through a practice survey, we looked at potential differences between daily (long-acting) opioid and daily triptan treatment in 53 patients. We found patient satisfaction with either treatment to be relatively favorable, although there was an implication that triptans outperform opioids in providing headache relief. However, it was also evident that in both treatment groups, despite the relatively positive patient satisfaction results, chronic migraine patients clearly continued to experience a negative impact from their headaches.", 
    "207": "This pharmacogenetics substudy from the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint reduction in Hypertension study in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) treated with the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan versus the beta-blocker atenolol for 4.8 years tested whether the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene and 12 other previously well-characterized polymorphisms of hypertension susceptibility genes affected blood pressure reduction, heart rate reduction, cardiovascular events, and/or response to treatment. These polymorphisms were chosen because they could affect blood pressure control or the pharmacological action of losartan or atenolol.", 
    "208": "We genotyped 3503 patients, 1774 on losartan and 1729 on atenolol.", 
    "209": "ACE and the 12 other genotypes did not affect the reduction in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, or heart rate, or treatment differences between losartan and atenolol on these endpoints, as assessed by general linear models. Also, ACE and the 12 other genotypes did not affect risk of the primary composite endpoint or its components stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death, or treatment differences between losartan and atenolol on these endpoints, as assessed by Cox proportional hazards models including baseline Framingham risk score and LVH.", 
    "210": "ACE insertion/deletion and 12 other polymorphisms of hypertension susceptibility genes did not affect blood pressure reduction, heart rate reduction, or cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension and LVH, or treatment differences between losartan and atenolol on these endpoints. These results suggest that the observed effects of losartan versus atenolol in the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint reduction in hypertension study do not depend on ACE and 12 other polymorphisms of hypertension susceptibility genes.", 
    "211": "Acute stress disorder (ASD) can interfere with satisfactory recovery of children with severe burn injuries. Recent studies have found propranolol to be effective in reducing posttraumatic symptoms, but the benefits of this medication with ASD are unknown. Therefore, we hypothesized that individuals who were administered propranolol acutely would be less likely to develop ASD than those who were not.", 
    "212": "A review of electronic medical records was conducted on the children included in a previous blinded randomized-control trial, in which the participants received propranolol or no propranolol during the acute phase of recovery (first 30 days). These data were merged with electronic information regarding medication treatment for ASD. The psychologists and clinicians who had previously assessed for ASD for purposes of treating the children's distress were blinded to who received propranolol and who did not.", 
    "213": "There were 363 participants (232 boys, 131 girls) and the mean total body surface area was 56%. Of this sample, 22 participants had been previously diagnosed and treated for ASD, and 341 were in a non-ASD group. Eight percent of those children who received propranolol required treatment for ASD, whereas 5% of children who received no propranolol also required treatment for ASD. No statistically significant difference was noted.", 
    "214": "Propranolol was not found to influence the risk for subsequent ASD. This finding is in contrast to the observed benefit of propranolol reported in other studies with different at risk populations. Further exploration is warranted to assess the possible long-term benefit on posttraumatic symptoms in pediatric burn survivor patients.", 
    "215": "Nebivolol is a novel beta1-blocker with a nitric oxide (NO)--potentiating, vasodilatory effect that is unique among beta-blockers. It was already shown that nebivolol ameliorates atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits. We, therefore, wanted to investigate whether this is the case in the fine experimental model of atherosclerosis: apolipoprotein E (apoE)-knockout mice. Nebivolol attenuated atherogenesis, measured both by \"en face\" method (9.23+/-1.8% vs. 14.6+/-2.1%) and \"cross-section\" method (63125+/-8455 microm(2) vs. 91416+/-8357 m(2)). This is the first report showing the effect of nebivolol on atherogenesis in gene-targeted mice."
