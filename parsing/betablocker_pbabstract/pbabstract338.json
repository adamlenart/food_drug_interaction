Lack of pain on injection and complete regeneration of the nerve after 12 months in a patient with severe peripheral vascular disease led us to postulate ischaemic nerve damage as a mechanism of injury. Adrenaline-induced unopposed alpha-mediated vasoconstriction in a beta-blocked patient is suggested as a possible mechanism of peripheral nerve injury worthy of further investigation.", 
    "1": "1. By using the sucrose gap technique, we have investigated the effect of the metabolically stable P2Y receptor agonist, adenosine 5'-O-2-thiodiphosphate (ADPbetaS), on the membrane potential and tension in the circular muscle of the guinea-pig proximal colon. All experiments were performed in the presence of atropine (1 microM), guanethidine (3 microM), indomethacin (3 microM), nifedipine (1 microM), L-nitroarginine (L-NOARG, 100 microM) and of the tachykinin NK1 and NK2 receptor antagonists, SR 140333 (0.1 microM) and GR 94800 (0.1 microM), respectively. 2. ADPbetaS (100 microM for 15 s) evoked a tetrodotoxin- (1 microM) resistant hyperpolarization and contraction of the smooth muscle. In the presence of apamin (0.1 microM), the ADPbetaS-induced hyperpolarization was converted to depolarization and the contraction was potentiated while tetraethylammonium (TEA, 10 mM) did not affect significantly the response to ADPbetaS. The combined application of apamin and TEA reproduced the effect observed with apamin alone. 3. Pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acids (PPADS, 30 microM) slightly but significantly increased the ADPbetaS-induced hyperpolarization, while the contraction evoked by ADPbetaS was reduced by about 80%. Suramin (100 microM) did not affect the ADPbetaS-induced hyperpolarization but totally blocked the ADPbetaS-induced contraction. In the presence of suramin (100 microM), a small relaxation of the circular muscle was observed upon application of ADPbetaS. 4. The contraction and hyperpolarization evoked by ADPbetaS were abolished in Ca2+-free Krebs solution. The blocker of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump, cyclopiazonic acid (10 microM) reduced contraction and hyperpolarization induced by ADPbetaS by about 60 and 50%, respectively. 5. A comparison of our present and previous findings enables to conclude that at least 3 types of P2 receptors are present on the smooth muscle of the guinea-pig colon, as follows: (1) inhibitory P2 receptors, producing an apamin-sensitive hyperpolarization, which are activated by alpha,beta-methylene ATP (alpha,beta-meATP) and by endogenously released purines, sensitive to suramin and PPADS; (2) inhibitory P2 receptors, producing an apamin-sensitive hyperpolarization, which are activated by ADPbetaS and are resistant to suramin and PPADS; (3) excitatory P2 receptors, producing contraction, which are activated by ADPbetaS and are sensitive to suramin and PPADS. The data also support the idea of the existence of a restricted pool of specialized junctional P2 receptors producing the apamin-sensitive NANC inhibitory junction potential in response to endogenous ligand(s).", 
    "2": "We ascertained nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use in 2,651 participants in the UK MRC treatment trial of hypertension in older adults and measured change in cognitive function over the subsequent 54 months. There was a significant, although modest, association between change in the Paired Associate Learning Test score over time and NSAID use, which was modified by age. NSAID users showed less decline, with younger subjects seeming to benefit more than older. We found no relationship between NSAID use and time taken to complete the Trail Making Test and also no relationship between anti-indigestion drug use and either cognitive outcome. These analyses highlight the need for larger studies with prospective classification of NSAID use and adequate control of confounding, including exposure to other medications. A randomized controlled trial of NSAIDs, in those known to be at risk of cognitive decline or dementia, may be indicated in the future.",

ONO-1101 was administered intravenously at a dose level of 0 (control), 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day from day 17 of gestation to day 20 after parturition to examine the effects on pregnancy, delivery, lactation and the effects on postnatal growth and development of offspring. In the 100 mg/kg/day group, hypoactivity, reddish lacrimation, clonic convulsion and bradypnea/apnea were observed after administration and 5 animals died in the treatment period, and body weight on day 21 and food consumption on day 14-21 of dam at weaning were lower than control group. In the 50 mg/kg/day group, reddish lacrimation was occasionally seen in some animals. ONO-1101 had no effects on pregnancy, delivery, lactation and necropsy findings or organ weights of dams. In the 100 mg/kg/day group, viability of offspring on day 4 after birth decreased and body weight gain of the suckling suppressed, but those changes recovered after weaning. On the skeletal examination of offspring culled on day 4 after birth, decrease in the mean number of osiffied phalanges of hindpaw and increase in the incidence of unossified talus bone were seen in the 100 mg/kg/day group, however, no delay of ossification was found form the weanling. There were no influence of ONO-1101 on external differentiation, functional, behavioral or learning abilities or reproductive performance in offspring.

    "10": "The pharmacokinetics of nadolol in blood serum and its excretion in the urine were studied in 6 male patients (aged from 35 to 59 years) with arterial hypertension for 48 h and, respectively, 72 h after a single per os administration of nadolol in a dose of 80 mg in the morning (9.00 a.m.), in daytime (15.00 p.m.) and in the evening (20.00 p.m.). The concentration of nadolol in the blood serum and urine was determined by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Analysis of the obtained data showed maximum blood serum nadolol concentration and the area under the concentration--time curve to be lower (93 ng/ml and 1786 ng h/ml) in the case of evening medication, and the peroral clearance and kinetic distribution volume to be higher (44.8 l/h and 940 l) than after morning medication (188 ng/ml, 2816 ng h/ml, and 28.4 l/h and 650 l, respectively). The corresponding parameters after daytime medication had intermediate values. The half-life period, mean retention time, and time of achievement of maximum blood serum nadolol concentration did not depend on the time of medication and were in the range of 15.2-15.8 h, 21.1-22.0 h, and 2.9-4.0 h, respectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters characterizing nadolol excretion with the urine were independent of the time of its intake. On the basis of the character of the detected circadian changes in the parameters of nadolol pharmacokinetics it is suggested that these changes reflect the circadian variations in the absorption of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract.", 
    "11": "In 21 pregnancies complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) which was treated by antihypertensive drugs (labetalol, nifedipine), fetal behavioural recordings (quiet state, C1F; active state, C2F; no coincidence, NOC) and Doppler measurements of blood flow velocity in the umbilical artery (UA) (resistance index, RI) were made on two occasions (27-32 and 33-36 weeks of gestation). Data were compared to those of a control group of normally grown fetuses (n = 96); in 15 cases we were able to match fetuses from the study group for age (+/- 1 week) and weight (+/- 150 g) at birth with fetales from a control group. It was the aim of this study to investigate if there are disturbances in the development of fetal behavioural states and if possible disturbances are due to poor fetal growth or to antihypertensive therapy. Our results show that in PIH treated by antihypertensive drugs, there are disturbances in the development of fetal behavioural states with higher percentages of NOC and C1F, lower percentages of C2F, and higher UA RI values. These disturbances are mainly due to coexisting placental impairment and poor fetal growth rather than to nifedipine or labetalol therapy, although these drugs may cause some redistribution of states.", 
    "12": "The trough:peak (T:P) ratio serves as an index of efficacy of antihypertensive drugs with respect to their dose and dose interval. There is no consensus regarding the method for the calculation of the T:P ratio. We assessed the influences of curve smoothing, the average fall in 24-h mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the length of the peak effect period on the result of T:P ratio calculation. Forty-two patients with essential hypertension (aged 27-81 years; 20 males) had a 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurement on two occasions. The first was performed at baseline, the second after 12 weeks of treatment with a beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, calcium slow-channel blocker, diuretic or a centrally acting drug, all taken once daily. BP data were analysed both by Fourier analysis (FA) with four harmonics and by time block analysis (TBA). The peak effect was defined as the maximum drop in MAP over a period of 0 to 3 h following drug intake at any time in the 24 h, and the trough effect as the fall in MAP over the last 2 h of the dose interval. FA gave higher T:P ratio values than TBA (0.51 vs 0.43; P < 0.05) and the variability of the results was reduced by FA (FA: 0.49-0.52; TBA: 0.35-0.46). A greater fall in 24-h MAP was associated with a higher T:P ratio (r = 0.42, P < 0.02; TBA: r = 0.31, P = 0.09). Half of the patients whose fall in 24-h MAP after treatment was <10 mm Hg, had higher trough BP values, resulting in negative T:P ratios. With increasing length of the peak period, the calculated peak effect was reduced and the T:P ratio increased (both FA and TBA: P < 0.001). The mean trough responses during the last 2 h of the dose interval were similar after TBA and FA. Based on these data, we recommend the use of FA for calculation of T:P ratios, especially when the magnitude of the antihypertensive effect is small. We also suggest using peak- and trough-effect periods of 2 h each. Whenever T:P ratios are calculated, the method used for curve smoothing and the length of peak- and trough-effect periods should be specified in order to obtain meaningful results. T:P ratios need to be interpreted individually together with the magnitude of the antihypertensive drug effect and the circadian BP profile.", 
    "13": "DIFFERENCES AMONG TYPES OF CALCIUM ANTAGONISTS: Calcium antagonists lower blood pressure, relieve angina pectoris and improve chronic heart failure, primarily through peripheral and coronary vasodilation. The debate as to whether short-acting, long-lasting (L)-channel calcium influx antagonists of the 1,4-dihydropyridine type might be involved in excess cardiac mortality has raised new controversies with respect to the cardiac morbidity and mortality outcome for all calcium antagonists. Different pharmacodynamic effects (short-acting vasodilation inducing pulsatile sympathetic reflex stimulation) may explain differences in outcome with calcium antagonist therapies. Calcium antagonists also differ in their direct effects on the sympathetic nervous system, and on its long endocrine arm, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These differential effects relate to the cardiac conduction system and ventricular ectopic activity, to cardiac and vascular remodelling and hypertrophy, and perhaps also to the development of hypertension. L-CHANNEL CALCIUM ANTAGONISTS: Depending on their pharmacodynamic characteristics, L-channel calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine, verapamil or diltiazem type reflexly activate the sympathetic nervous system and blunt beta-adrenoceptor-mediated calcium influx, thus eliciting negative inotropy and activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Both verapamil and diltiazem slow down pacemaker activity and atrioventricular conduction. MIBEFRADIL: The new-class T-channel blocker mibefradil exhibits vascular selectivity and induces peripheral and coronary vasodilation. There is no reflex sympathetic activation and no negative inotropic effect. It increases coronary blood flow without increasing oxygen consumption and causes a slight slowing of the heart rate, thereby inducing diastolic relaxation. The latter improves subendocardial and small artery perfusion. There is a sympatholytic effect, owing to T-channel expression in neurones, sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes and Purkinje fibres. In experimental models, ventricular ectopic activity is reduced with mibefradil. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and endothelin effects are blunted by T-channel inhibition. These and other factors reduce smooth muscle cell proliferation, hypertrophy and matrix deposition. T-type calcium channel inhibition, over and above its antihypertensive and anti-ischaemic effects, and afterload-reducing effects in chronic heart failure, offers the potential for a cardiovascular protective benefit, which may be critically related to interference with the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "14": "The fluorescent indicator Fura-2 was used to characterize the store-operated Ca2+ entry in insulin-releasing pancreatic beta-cells. To avoid interference with voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry, the cells were hyperpolarized with 400 microM diazoxide and the channel blocker methoxyverapamil was also present in some experiments. The cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]j) of hyperpolarized mouse beta-cells was strikingly resistant to changes in external Ca2+. In cells exposed to 20 mM glucose, stimulation with 100 microM carbachol induced an initial [Ca2+]j peak followed by a sustained increase due to store-operated influx of the cation. Store-operated influx was also induced by the intracellular Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. In the presence of store-operated influx, [Ca2+]j became markedly sensitive to variations in external Ca2+, but this sensitivity was blocked by La3+. In beta-cells exposed to both Ca2+ and Mn2+ there was slow Mn2+ quenching of the Fura-2 fluorescence, which was accelerated upon stimulation of store-operated influx. This acceleration was reversed by glucose-stimulated filling of the internal Ca2+ stores. The store-operated Ca2+ entry increased markedly during culture of the beta-cells. Activation of protein kinase C by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate, inhibition of serine/threonine phosphatase by okadaic acid and inhibition of tyrosine kinase by genistein had little effect on the store-operated influx of Ca2+. In beta-cells equilibrated in 5 mM Sr2+, carbachol exposure resulted in a pronounced cytoplasmic Sr2+ ([Sr2+]j) peak due to intracellular mobilization, but little or no sustained elevation. Moreover, after activating the store-operated pathway by exposure to thapsigargin, variations in extracellular Sr2+ between 0-2 mM had only marginal effects on [Sr2+]j. Although the store-operated influx apparently accounts for a minor fraction of the Ca2+ entry, its depolarizing influence may under certain conditions be up-regulated with resulting distortion of the beta-cell function.", 
    "15": "We tested whether ACE-inhibition with ramipril (A), beta-adrenergic blockade with metoprolol (beta) or combined treatment (beta A) for 6 weeks after inducing myocardial infarction in rats by left coronary artery ligation modifies contractile function of hypertrophied papillary muscle from left ventricles with different infarct size (IS) compared to a placebo group (P). At IS<40% of left ventricle, contraction and relaxation were less impaired than at IS>40% compared to sham operated rats (SO). Isometrically developed peak force and calcium sensitivity of myofilaments, measured in skinned fibres, were significantly higher in beta. Treatment with ramipril or metoprolol improved contraction rate and force development, respectively, mainly at IS<40%, but deteriorated relaxation rate. ACE-inhibition and beta-adrenergic blockade had no significant improving effect on the relaxation rate and further characteristics of the contractile function at IS>40%, although combined treatment reduced the infarct size and ramipril treatment suppressed the development of hypertrophy. Post-extrastimulatory potentiation was increased in beta and beta A at IS>40%. Post-rest potentiations were influenced hardly at IS<40% and were significantly smaller in A at IS>40%. The twitch-to-twitch decay of the potentiations was faster at IS>40%. Increase in the degree of post-extrastimulatory potentiation, steeper twitch-dependent decay of the potentiations and loss of rest-dependent potentiation at IS>40% indicate relatively increased trans-sarcolemmal Ca2+ transports via Ca2+ channels and Na+/Ca2+ exchange, partly modified by ramipril and metoprolol. The results demonstrate that ACE-inhibition and beta-adrenergic blockade induce a dissociation between trophic effects and phenotypic effects on contractile function after chronic infarction.", 
    "16": "The study examined the possibility that propranolol, buspirone, pCPA, and reserpine have antianxiety effects by comparing their effects with those of chlordiazepoxide on an open-field test of emotionality in rats. The effects of intraperitoneal injections of d,l, propranolol (5, 10, 20 mg/kg), buspirone (1.25, 2.5, 5 mg/kg), reserpine (0.5 mg/kg), parachlorophenylalanine (pCPA) (100 mg/kg), and chlordiazepoxide (CDP) (2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg) were compared with performance of rats under saline or water using an open-field test on 5 successive days. Significant effects were found on peripheral movements, rearing, grooming, immobility, and defecation. The patterns of effects of high doses of propranolol and buspirone resembled those of CDP, while pCPA had some of the effects of CDP, and reserpine produced few effects. With propranolol, buspirone, and CDP, there was evidence of dose sensitivity. The effects of repeated testing across 5 days were different from these of CDP or other drugs. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the effects of propranolol and buspirone on open-field behavior are anxiolytic, and may be mediated by action on the same brain systems.",

    "18": "Improvement of symptoms and, accordingly, quality of life, as well as prolongation of life, are the objectives of drug therapy in congestive heart failure patients. Diuretics are most effective in relieving symptoms related to congestion, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improve exercise capacity, reduce the incidence of decompensations and hence hospitalizations, and prolong life. Angiotensin type-1 receptor antagonists also seem to improve survival, while digoxin improves symptoms and morbidity but not survival in patients in sinus rhythm. The value of prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone and oral anticoagulation in the presence of sinus rhythm is not established, and the role of newer dihydropyridine calcium antagonists and betablockers is also not precisely defined. These agents should only be considered in selected cases after careful consideration of potential advantages and risks, and should usually be used as an addition to established therapy. Better understanding of the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure will lead to the development of new treatment concepts, the clinical relevance of which will have to be tested in appropriately designed clinical trials.", 
    "19": "Among the different application routes peroral administration remains the one most widely used. Hence, mechanisms affecting p.o. bioavailability are of particular interest, also in drug development. In recent years, intestinal drug secretion mediated by the multi-drug resistance gene product P-glycoprotein (Pgp) has been discovered as a possible mechanism of low and erratic bioavailability. Due to the saturability of this process, a dose-dependent apparent oral clearance may be observed which decreases upon increasing dose. However, in vivo intestinal secretion might be revealed only in the lower or subtherapeutic dose range. In permeability studies with Caco-2 cell monolayers, the MDR-reversing agent verapamil inhibits secretion of P-glycoprotein substrates and, hence, increases apical-to-basolateral permeability. The aim of the rat studies with talinolol presented here was to test the relevance of the intestinal secretion process as well as the extent of inhibition by verapamil in ex vivo, in situ, and in vivo talinolol/verapamil drug-drug interaction studies. Intestinal secretion of talinolol was detected indirectly in ex vivo studies via transport inhibition with verapamil and directly in in situ intestinal perfusions in rats following a talinolol i.v. bolus. Both i.v. and p.o. verapamil appear to affect the concentration-time profiles of talinolol. Relevant observations with respect to drug absorption are the decreased apparent oral clearance upon verapamil coadministration as well as the decreased tmax and mean absorption times at high verapamil doses. Talinolol may be regarded as a potential model compound for mechanistic studies on Pgp interactions, including permeability as well as binding studies and the involvement of transporters other than Pgp.", 
    "20": "Lungs from near-term fetal guinea pigs (60 +/- 2 days of gestation) were supported in vitro for 3 h; lung liquid production was monitored by a dye-dilution method. Studies of 30 fetuses showed that untreated preparations produced fluid at 1.34 +/- 0.21 ml.h-1.kg body wt-1, but epinephrine at concentrations known at delivery (10(-8) and 10(-7) M) produced significant reductions or fluid reabsorption (analysis of variance, regression analysis); at high levels (10(-6) and 10(-5) M, epinephrine had no effect. Maximal responses from 10(-7) M epinephrine involved alpha-adrenoreceptors, since they were abolished by 10(-6) M phentolamine (alpha-antagonist) but were unaffected by 10(-6) M propranolol (beta-antagonist; n = 36). Activation was through alpha2-adrenoreceptors, since responses were abolished by 10(-4) M yohimbine (alpha-antagonist; n = 24) but were resistant to 10(-5) M prazosin (alpha 1-antagonist; n = 24). At high levels of epinephrine (10(-5) M), where responses did not normally occur, reductions in lung liquid production were large if prazosin was also present (n = 24), and increases were significant if yohimbine was included (n = 24). In guinea pigs, epinephrine appears to activate lung fluid reabsorption through alpha 2-adrenoreceptors; at high concentrations only, it can also increase production through alpha 1-adrenoreceptors. Therefore, species differences appear to exist.",

    "26": "With a primary culture of ventricular cardiomyocytes from newborn rats as an in vitro model, the long-term effects of norepinephrine (NE) on hypertrophic postnatal development and the I/V properties of L-type calcium currents were investigated with the whole-cell configuration of patch-clamp technique. These effects of NE also were tested in the presence of propranolol (P). Compared with mean values obtained in control conditions, the measurement of cell membrane capacitance (Cm) as an index of cell growth demonstrated that Cm was increased by 12, 35, and 42% after 1, 3, and 6 days, respectively, of treatment with 2 microM NE. Similar increases were observed when propranolol (2 microM) was added to the NE treatment, suggesting that growth potentiation could be attributed to the alpha-adrenergic effect of NE. Under control conditions, the L-type calcium current (ICa-L) density did not alter with the age of the culture. However, in the presence of NE, ICa-L density increased significantly compared with control conditions at the same stage of culture and was also significantly increased after 3 and 6 days of NE treatment when compared with ICa-L density after 1 day of NE treatment. Similar results were obtained in the presence of propranolol. These results show that the growth and functional properties of neonatal cardiomyocytes in primary culture can be regulated by catecholamines and demonstrate that these regulatory effects were achieved through activation of alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "27": "To assess the effects of celiprolol, which is a selective beta1-antagonist with vasodilating properties, on chronic heart failure in the cardiomyopathic hamster UM-X7.1 (CMH), we studied survival in treated CMH (celiprolol, 100 mg/kg/day) and untreated CMH. We also measured the hamsters' locomotor activity (by using an Automex system), in vivo left ventricular (LV) pressure with or without dobutamine infusion, and the myocardial beta-adrenergic-receptor density (Bmax), all at the age of approximately 210 days. Survival was significantly improved in the treated group compared with untreated group by 33.4% at the age of 210 days, and the median probabilities of survival were age 252 days in the treated group and 203 days in the untreated group (p < 0.01). The locomotor activity count was significantly higher in the treated group (14,945+/-6,895) than in the untreated group (8,264+/-2,945 counts/day; p < 0.05). The response of LV peak +/-dP/dt to dobutamine was significantly improved in the treated group by 22.9 and 34.8%, respectively, at 18 microg/kg/min. Bmax was also higher in the treated group than in the untreated group (80.1+/-15.1 vs. 65.2+/-10.6 fmol/mg; p < 0.05). This study suggests that long-term treatment with celiprolol could improve both survival and the hemodynamic responses to dobutamine, associated with the upregulation of beta-receptors, and increased locomotor activity.",

DBD-COCl exhibited high reactivity for the reaction completed within 5 min under mild conditions and without any need for a catalyst. The derivatives were well separated enantiomerically on cellulose CSPs (the derivative of propranolol on a Chiralcel OD-R column and those of metoprolol and atenolol on a Chiralcel OJ-R column) in the reversed-phase mode, with the S-configurations being eluted before the R-configurations. The derivatives were stable at 4 degrees C for 1 week.

Resolution of the enantiomers was achieved using hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) as the chiral selector. Parameters found to influence separation include cyclodextrin concentration, potential, pH and organic solvent/additive. It was observed that 17 mM HP-beta-CD gave optimum separation over the concentration range used in this study, however different racemates appear to have best resolution at different CD concentration. The potential does not have a great effect on enantiomer resolution, but appears to cause relative metabolite migration times to alter such that separation is affected. Carrier pH affects both migration time, and enantiomer resolution and metabolite separation. Above pH 5 inferior results are obtained. This is the first report of enantiomeric resolution of propranolol metabolites using CE.", 
    "30": "It is conventionally thought that electrical cardioversion in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) of longstanding duration or with a large left atrial diameter, only seldom results in long term success. Recurrence is common, although antiarrhythmic drugs often effectively decrease the number and duration of recurrent AF episodes. We analysed clinical, functional and pharmacological variables which could possibly influence the long term outcome after a first electrical cardioversion for AF in a retrospective study on 85 patients. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to identify factors predicting maintenance of sinus rhythm at 100 days, and absence of recurrence during the entire follow-up. In univariate analysis, the only significant predictor for maintenance of sinus rhythm at 100 days was the duration of the preceding AF episode. Multivariate analysis with persistence of sinus rhythm at 100 days as endpoint confirmed this as a prognostic factor (p < 0.03), but sotalol treatment also contributed to maintenance of sinus rhythm (p < 0.05). When considering the entire observation period, class III antiarrhythmic drugs, i.e. sotalol and amiodarone, were useful in preventing recurrence (p < 0.01 and < 0.02). High age (above 75 years) was a predictor of recurrence. In conclusion, class III antiarrhythmic drugs, the duration of atrial fibrillation and high age were the most important determinants of long term outcome, while echocardiographic parameters and the presence of heart disease played no role.", 
    "31": "Radiofrequency catheter ablation of a right septal accessory pathway was performed in a 66-year-old patient with incessant orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. Intravenous administration of flecainide, ajmaline, verapamil, and d,l-sotalol had been ineffective in controlling the tachycardia. After the ablation procedure, precordial T-wave inversion was observed during sinus rhythm. These repolarization abnormalities persisted and were suggested to represent \"cardiac memory.\" Three days later, atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular response developed and oral d,l-sotalol, which had been well tolerated previously on a long-term basis, was started again. However, at this time, and in the presence of the persisting repolarization abnormalities, the T waves became deeper and broader within a few hours after the introduction of d,l-sotalol. Marked QT prolongation that was paralleled by the occurrence of repeated episodes of torsade de pointes developed. Serum electrolytes were normal. Direct current cardioversion was necessary due to the degeneration of torsade de pointes into ventricular fibrillation. Further sustained arrhythmia episodes were suppressed by temporary endocardial ventricular pacing. The patient recovered without any sequela. This case demonstrates that repolarization abnormalities after catheter ablation, which may be due, at least in part, to the \"cardiac memory,\" are not always benign but may contribute significantly to proarrhythmia.",

Female New Zealand white rabbits, 4-5 weeks old, were treated with 5 mg/kg estradiol dipropionate (estrogen group) or saline (control group) injected intramuscularly weekly for 2 weeks. Electrical field stimulation (supramaximum voltage, 2 ms pulse duration, 0.3-15 Hz and 3 s train) caused frequency-dependent relaxation of urethral strips in both groups, which was inhibited by Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (L.-NNA). This inhibition was overcome by addition of L-arginine. The relaxation induced by nitrergic nerve stimulation was significantly lower in the estrogen group than in the control group. There was no significant difference in sodium nitroprusside-induced urethral relaxation between the two groups. The production of NO in urethral strips during nitrergic nerve stimulation was evaluated by measuring nitrite/nitrate (NO2-/NO3-) levels in both groups, using microdialysis. The NO2-/NO3- production during electrical field stimulation in the estrogen group was significantly less than that in the control group. The NADPH diaphorase-positive reaction in the control group was greater than that in the estrogen group. The results suggest that estrogen treatment may reduce NO synthase activity, and inhibit the relaxation induced by nitrergic nerve stimulation in rabbit urethral smooth muscle.", 
    "38": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of propranolol intoxication on the QT and QTc intervals in a canine model. Lead II surface electrocardiograms were retrospectively evaluated from a previous study performed in this laboratory. Thirteen pentobarbital-anesthetized and instrumented animals, after a 30-min baseline period, were given 10 mg/kg dl-propranolol i.v. over 10 min. The electrocardiogram was printed continuously. Average heart rate and QT interval were measured and QTc was calculated at baseline and again 1 min after propranolol infusion was complete. Data for hemodynamic parameters have been previously reported demonstrating significant cardiovascular depression in all animals and one death with the administration of propranol. The QT interval was significantly prolonged by propranolol administration from baseline at 0.257 +/- 0.039 to 0.295 +/- 0.035 s. There was no significant difference in the QTc between baseline (0.371 +/- 0.026 s) and postpropranolol (0.366 +/- 0.021 s) measurements. In this canine model of propranolol intoxication, QT interval prolongation appears to be the result of associated bradycardia. Cardiovascular depression does not appear to include a significant direct effect on ventricular repolarization, as judged by the QTc interval.",

The isoproterenol response was also significantly (p < 0.03) blocked by the non-selective alpha-antagonist phentolamine. Cyclic AMP and phosphodiesterase inhibitors significantly decreased Vm. Pretreatment with these inhibitors potentiated the agonist-induced depolarization. Barium, a blocker of Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ channels, significantly decreased baseline Vm. Barium pretreatment blocked the beta-agonist and cAMP induced depolarization of Vm, suggesting that the K+ current is necessary for the observed isoproterenol response. Pretreatment with the cotransport inhibitor bumetanide had no effect on the isoproterenol-induced response.",

    "45": "The effects of the combined distension of the stomach and the descending colon on coronary blood flow were examined in seven alpha-chloralose anaesthetized pigs whilst preventing changes in heart rate and aortic blood pressure. Changes in coronary blood flow in the left circumflex or anterior descending coronary artery were assessed using electromagnetic flowmeters during distension with Ringer solution of balloons positioned in the viscera. In a first set of studies, graded distension of the stomach with distending volumes of 0.8, 1.1 and 1.4 l always caused graded decreases in coronary blood flow. The additional distension of the descending colon at a distending volume of 0.25 l augmented the response of decrease in coronary blood flow caused by the first two levels of gastric distension, but it did not have any further effect when added to the higher level of gastric distension. Similar results were obtained in a second set of studies in which distension of the stomach at a volume of 0.8 l was additionally performed during graded distension of the descending colon with distending volumes of 0.25, 0.35 and 0.45 l. These effects elicited by combined distension of the two viscera were not affected by the administration of propranolol, but they were abolished by subsequent administration of phentolamine. The results showed that combined distension of the stomach and the descending colon in anaesthetized pigs augmented the reflex response of coronary vasoconstriction and that the response to distension of one viscus was attenuated during increased levels of distension of the other viscus. These combined responses to distension of the two viscera involved efferent sympathetic mechanisms related to alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "46": "Patch-clamp recordings were made from isolated and intact retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of the ferret to examine the calcium-activated potassium channels expressed by these neurons and to determine their functional role in the generation of spikes and spiking patterns. Single-channel recordings from isolated neurons revealed the presence of two calcium-sensitive potassium channels that had conductances of 118 and 22 pS. The properties of these two channels were shown to be similar to those ascribed to the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BKCa) and small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SKCa) channels in other neurons. Whole cell recordings from isolated RGCs showed that apamin and charybdotoxin (CTX), specific blockers of the SKCa and BKCa channels, respectively, resulted in a shortening of the time to threshold and a reduction in the hyperpolarization after the spike. Addition of these blockers also resulted in a significant increase in spike frequency over a wide range of maintained depolarizations. Similar effects of apamin and CTX were observed during current-clamp recordings from intact alpha and beta ganglion cells, morphologically identified after Lucifer yellow filling. About 20% of these neurons did not exhibit a sensitivity to either blocker, suggesting the presence of functionally distinct subgroups of alpha and beta RGCs on the basis of their intrinsic membrane properties. The expression of these calcium-activated potassium channels in the majority of alpha and beta cells provides a means by which the activity of these output neurons could be modulated by retinal neurochemicals.", 
    "47": "Suramin acts as a G protein inhibitor because it inhibits the rate-limiting step in activation of the Galpha subunit, i.e., the exchange of GDP for GTP. Here, we have searched for analogues that are selective for Gsalpha. Two compounds have been identified: NF449 (4,4',4\",4'\"-[carbonyl-bis[imino-5,1,3-benzenetriyl bis-(carbonylimino)]]tetrakis-(benzene-1,3-disulfonate) and NF503 (4, 4'-[carbonylbis[imino-3,1-phenylene-(2, 5-benzimidazolylene)carbonylimino]]bis-benzenesulfonate). These compounds (i) suppress the association rate of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate ([35S]GTP[gammaS]) binding to Gsalpha-s but not to Gialpha-1, (ii) inhibit stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in S49 cyc- membranes (deficient in endogenous Gsalpha) by exogenously added Gsalpha-s, and (iii) block the coupling of beta-adrenergic receptors to Gs with half-maximum effects in the low micromolar range. In contrast to suramin, which is not selective, NF503 and NF449 disrupt the interaction of the A1-adenosine receptor with its cognate G proteins (Gi/Go) at concentrations that are >30-fold higher than those required for uncoupling of beta-adrenergic receptor/Gs tandems; similarly, the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (a prototypical Gq-coupled receptor) is barely affected by the compounds. Thus, NF503 and NF449 fulfill essential criteria for Gsalpha-selective antagonists. The observations demonstrate the feasibility of subtype-selective G protein inhibition.",

    "49": "Carvedilol, a new vasodilating beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and a potent antioxidant, produces a high degree of cardioprotection in a variety of experimental models of ischemic cardiac injury. Recent clinical studies in patients with heart failure have demonstrated that carvedilol reduces morbidity and mortality and inhibits cardiac remodeling. The present study was designed to explore whether the protective effects of carvedilol on the ischemic myocardium include inhibition of apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and, if so, to determine its mechanism of action. Anesthetized rabbits were subjected to 30 minutes of coronary artery occlusion followed by 4 hours of reperfusion. Detection of apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was based on the presence of nucleosomal DNA fragments on agarose gels (DNA ladder) and in situ nick end labeling. Carvedilol (1 mg/kg IV), administered 5 minutes before reperfusion, reduced the number of apoptotic myocytes in the ischemic area from 14.7 +/- 0.4% to 3.4 +/- 1.8% (77% reduction, P<.001). Propranolol, administered at equipotent beta-blocking dosage, reduced the number of apoptotic myocytes to 8.9 +/- 2.1% (39% reduction, P<.05). DNA ladders were observed in the hearts of all six vehicle-treated rabbits but only one of six carvedilol-treated rabbits (P<.01). Immunocytochemical analysis of rabbit hearts demonstrated an upregulation of Fas protein in ischemic cardiomyocytes, and treatment with carvedilol reduced both the intensity of staining as well as the area stained. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion led to a rapid activation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) in the ischemic area but not in nonischemic regions. SAPK activity was increased from 2.1 +/- 0.3 mU/mg (basal) to 8.9 +/- 0.8 mU/mg after 30 minutes of ischemia followed by 20 minutes of reperfusion. Carvedilol inhibited the activation of SAPK by 53.4 +/- 6.5% (P<.05). Under the same conditions, propranolol (1 mg/kg) had no effect on SAPK activation. Taken together, these results suggest that carvedilol prevents myocardial ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes possibly by downregulation of the SAPK signaling pathway, by inhibition of Fas receptor expression, and by beta-adrenergic blockade. The former two actions represent novel and important mechanisms that may contribute to the cardioprotective effects of carvedilol.", 
    "50": "Many beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are weak partial agonists, possessing significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Under certain conditions, ISA may be deleterious through stimulation of beta 1- and/or beta 2-adrenoceptors in the heart. Drugs with ISA are particularly problematic in the treatment of congestive heart failure since agents that activate cardiac beta-adrenoceptors, such as xamoterol, have been associated with increases in the incidence of arrhythmia and mortality. Carvedilol was recently approved for the treatment of congestive heart failure, and bucindolol is currently in large clinical trials for this indication. In the present study, the ISA of bucindolol and carvedilol was evaluated in a standard model used to investigate ISA, the pithed rat. Both compounds produced dose-dependent inhibition of the positive-chronotropic effects of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, confirming that these drugs are beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. However, cumulative administration of bucindolol (10-1,000 micrograms/kg i.v.) in the pithed rat produced a significant dose-related increase in heart rate. The maximal increase in heart rate produced by bucindolol was 44% of that obtained with isoproterenol (90 +/- 6vs. 205 +/- 11 bpm, respectively). In marked contrast, cumulative administration of carvedilol (10-1,000 micrograms/kg i.v.) had no significant effect on resting heart rate in the pithed rat. The maximal increase in heart rate elicited by bucindolol (1,000 micrograms/kg i.v.) was inhibited by treatment with the competitive beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (99 +/- 8.7 vs. 26 +/- 2.6 bpm), confirming that the ISA observed with bucindolol was mediated through stimulation of myocardial beta-adrenoceptors. Carvedilol, which had no ISA, antagonized the ISA of bucindolol, and was as effective as propranolol in blocking the ISA of bucindolol (99 +/- 8.7 vs. 27 +/- 2.3 bpm). In summary, bucindolol and carvedilol are both potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in the pithed rat: however, only bucindolol possesses beta-adrenoceptor-mediated ISA.", 
    "51": "Meta-iodo-benzylguanidine (MIBG), a selective inhibitor of mono-ADP-ribosylation, has been shown to inhibit histamine induced inositol-trisphosphate and prostacyclin production. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of MIBG on the binding of histamine to the H1-receptor and to study its effects on phospholipid metabolism in human endothelial cells. The effects of MIBG and MIBA (meta-iodo-benzylamine), which does not affect cellular ADP-ribosylation, on agonist induced cGMP production in cultured HUVEC's were measured by RIA and a binding study carried out to evaluate their effects on the binding of [3H]mepyramine to membrane fractions. MIBG (0.3 mM) reduced histamine induced cGMP production by 90.8% but did not inhibit the cGMP production induced by other agonists. MIBA had no effect. MIBG also reduced the binding of [3H]mepyramine (1.0 nM) to membrane fractions with IC50 at 0.094 mM and maximal inhibition (83%) at 0.22mM MIBG. The calculated Ki was 0.076mM. MIBG and MIBA altered phospholipid metabolism in a similar way as the cationic amphiphilic drug propranolol. MIBA caused up to 42% reduction in [3H]mepyramine binding, probably due to its inhibition of nonspecific binding. These results indicate that MIBG reduces histamine induced cGMP production by inhibiting its binding to H1-receptors and alters phospholipid metabolism in cultured endothelial cells in a similar way as known cationic amphiphilic drugs.",

The trough-to-peak sitting diastolic ratios also favoured nebivolol (84% vs 60%, P = 0.002). Nebivolol, but not enalapril, slightly but significantly lowered heart rate.

    "53": "It has been suggested that long term treatment with calcium antagonist drugs might inhibit platelet function and lead to an anti-atheromatous effect. However recent data have also suggested that such an effect might increase mortality due to an increased incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. We identified 43 subjects from general practice with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension to compare the effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine with that of the beta-blocker atenolol on platelet function, plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels, fibrinolysis, and serum lipids in a randomised double-blind parallel group study. After careful evaluation to exclude concomitant aspirin use, only 24 subjects were eligible to enter the study. While isradipine and atenolol produced comparable and clinically significant falls in blood pressure (167 +/- 2/102 +/- 1 to 153 +/- 3/91 +/- 2 mm Hg, and 165 +/- 2/101 +/- 1 to 156 +/- 4/91 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively), neither drug produced a detectable effect on ex vivo platelet aggregation, platelet retention, or thromboxane generation with adrenaline, collagen, adenosine-di-phosphate, or platelet activating factor. However a decrease in plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels was observed which reached statistical significance (P < 0.05) after 12 weeks treatment in the isradipine but not the atenolol group. A 39% reduction with isradipine compared with 34% following atenolol treatment. Euglobulin clot lysis time was not altered by either drug. Serum cholesterol concentrations were also unaltered by drug treatment. Therapeutic doses of the calcium antagonist isradipine may produce a minor indirect effect on platelet function after several weeks of treatment. However, this is of doubtful clinical importance and may simply reflect an effect of lowered blood pressure on platelet function.", 
    "54": "The effect of a sustained decrease in sympathetic nervous activity, achieved through 5-day head-down bed rest (HDBR), on the beta-adrenergic lipolytic activity of s.c. adipose tissue was studied in eight healthy men. The in situ beta-adrenoceptor (AR) sensitivity was studied using the microdialysis method. Local perfusion of increasing concentrations of isoprenaline showed an increased beta-AR sensitivity to lipolysis (assessed by extracellular glycerol concentration) and to vascular tone (assessed by the ethanol clearance). The adrenergic sensitivity of isolated adipocytes was studied in vitro. Basal lipolysis and the response to nonselective (isoprenaline) or selective (dobutamine, terbutaline, and CGP 12177) beta-AR agonists were increased after HDBR as was the lipolytic effect of dibutyryl cAMP. When data were expressed as a percentage of the dibutyryl cAMP effect to rule out the postreceptor events, basal and lipolytic responses to beta-AR agonists where similar before and during HDBR. The alpha 2-AR-mediated antilipolytic effects of adrenaline were not modified. Lymphocyte beta-AR number was unchanged during HDBR. Our results demonstrate that a sustained sympathoinhibition induces an increase in the lipolytic beta-adrenergic response in adipose tissue and suggest that this hypersensitization is linked to an increase in the postreceptor steps of the lipolytic cascade in the adipocyte rather than to changes in beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "55": "A recently reported approach to the prediction of blood-brain drug distribution uses the general linear free energy equation to correlate equilibrium blood-brain solute distributions (logBB) with five solute descriptors: R2 an excess molar refraction term; pi2H, solute dipolarity or polarizability; alpha2H and beta2H, the hydrogen bond acidity or basicity, and Vx, the solute McGowan volume. In this study we examine whether the model can be used to analyse kinetic transfer rates across the blood-brain barrier in the rat. The permeability (logPS) of the blood-brain barrier to a chemically diverse series of compounds was measured using a short duration vascular perfusion method. LogPS data were correlated with calculated solute descriptors, and octanol-water partition coefficients (logP(oct)) for comparison. It is shown that a general linear free energy equation can be constructed to predict and interpret logPS values. The utility of this model over other physicochemical descriptors for interpreting logPS and logBB values is discussed.", 
    "56": "To describe a case of milrinone-associated tachycardia that was successfully treated with two beta-blockers.", 
    "57": "A 74-yr-old male patient underwent elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair under combined epidural/general anaesthesia. He had a history of alcohol abuse, controlled hypertension and ischaemic heart disease. Postoperatively, the patient had persistent sinus tachycardia that was initially unsuccessfully treated with metoprolol. Subsequently, the patient's blood pressure and cardiac index decreased with an associated increase in pulmonary artery pressure. Analysis of the ST-segment revealed no evidence of myocardial ischaemia or infarction. These haemodynamic changes were treated with milrinone which exacerbated the baseline tachycardia without adverse blood pressure response. The subsequent administration of beta-blockers (esmolol and metoprolol) was successful in controlling the heart rate response to milrinone without adversely affecting the patient's haemodynamic profile.", 
    "58": "This report demonstrates the efficacy of esmolol and metoprolol for the treatment of milrinone-associated tachycardia, without compromising the haemodynamic effects of milrinone.", 
    "59": "The prospective, randomized multicentre HOT study (Hypertension Optimal Treatment) is at present being undertaken in 26 countries. The cardinal questions to be answered were: (1) the relationship between three targeted diastolic pressures (< or = 90, < or = 85 and < or = 80 mm Hg, respectively) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates among hypertensives; and (2) the effect of low dosage aspirin (75 mg daily) on morbidity and mortality rates, compared with a placebo.", 
    "60": "A total of 19,193 patients (9056 women, 10,137 men; age range 50-80 years) with a diastolic blood pressure of > or = 100 to < or = 115 mm Hg were randomized. Antihypertensive treatment was begun with the calcium-channel blocker felodipine (5 mg once daily; step 1). When the target could not be reached at this dosage, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or beta-receptor blocker was added (stage two), after which felodipine, 10 mg daily, could be given, if necessary (step 3). Any necessary changes in dosage (step 4) were made according to a prescribed plan. As fifth and final step a diuretic could be additionally administered. One-year results are now available for all patients and reported here. Results of older patients (> or = 65 years, n = 6113) were compared to those of younger patients (< 65 years, n = 13,080).", 
    "61": "Average diastolic pressure in the previously < or = 90 mm Hg group had been reduced to 86 mm Hg, in the < or = 85 group to 83 mm Hg, and in the < or 80 mm Hg group to 81 mm Hg. The percentage proportion of patients in whom the targeted pressures had been reached after 12 months of treatment were: 84% for the < 90 mm Hg group, 72% in the < 85 mm Hg group and 57% in the < 80 mm Hg group. In a subgroup of elderly patients (> 65 years, n = 6113) the corresponding percentage proportions were higher: 86%, 76% and 61%. Side effects were noted only rarely, despite the intensive treatment (> 65 years and < 65 years): ankle oedema in 2.6% and 3.0%; and cough in 1.3 and 0.8%, an overall incidence of > or = 1%. The same treatment (with felodipine) was still being given after one year to 88% of all patients.", 
    "62": "These results after one year indicate that most patients well tolerate consistent blood pressure reduction. This raises the hope that the primary questions of the study can be answered.", 
    "63": "Although it is considered that the lipoprotein metabolism in tumor plays an important role in growth and multiplication, it is not clear as to the details. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of lipoprotein-triacylglyceride. In this study, we examined the regulatory step of LPL in lipoprotein metabolism of Ehrlich ascites tumor and especially the enzyme-release from the tumor cells. When LPL was stimulated to release from the tumor cells by the low molecular weight dextran sulfate (3.2 kDa), cyclic AMP content in the tumor cells was observed to increase rapidly in a time-dependent manner up to 30 s; its maximal effect was 1.5-fold higher than the basal level of cyclic AMP. The increase in cyclic AMP content was more enhanced in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine and was never suppressed by propranolol. Moreover, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity in the tumor cells was also recognized to elevate in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, the release of LPL activity from the tumor cells was inhibited by 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine. These results suggest that LPL in the tumor cells is released through a pathway involving an activation of PKA associated with the rapid increase in cyclic AMP content.", 
    "64": "Within the last 30 years pharmacotherapy has significantly contributed to an improvement of the prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease. With regard to antianginal drugs beta-blocker therapy has in particular enabled a risk reduction in patients with unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction and following acute myocardial infarction. Antithrombotic therapy has largely been influenced by platelet inhibitors. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has convincingly shown to enable a risk reduction in patients with stable angina, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction and in the secondary prevention following myocardial infarction. The introduction of thienopyridines has led to a further improvement of antiplatelet therapy. Thus, the combination of ticlopidine + ASA was combined with a significant risk reduction of subacute stent thrombosis and has enabled stent implantation to become a breakthrough technology. Clopidogrel, another thienopyridine has been shown to be superior in comparison to a monotherapy with ASA in patients with atherothrombotic diseases. The introduction of glycoproteine-IIb-IIIa-receptor antagonists has led to a significant risk reduction of periinterventional complications in patients with unstable angina. The combination of heparin + ASA was clearly superior to a monotherapy with ASA in patients with unstable angina. Recently, a further improvement of prognosis with low molecular weight heparin has been reported. Due to somewhat conflicting results, the definite role of direct thrombin inhibitors like hirudin still has to be defined. A possible risk reduction in patients with unstable coronary syndromes has been reported. Reperfusion therapy with fibrinolytic agents has revolutionised the therapy of patients with acute myocardial infarction throughout the last decades. In numerous trials successful fibrinolysis has convincingly shown to improve the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction and thus is still considered to be the gold standard of treatment in acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "65": "In some patients it was seen that chronic headaches disappeared after laser iridectomies had been done to prevent glaucoma, in persons with normal intra-ocular pressure (IOP).", 
    "66": "To make a study of patients with headache, some of whom were treated with topical beta-blockers (carteolol) and others by Yag-laser iridectomies. The effect on headache and IOP was analyzed.", 
    "67": "A survey, ophthalmological examination and headache provocation test were carried out in patients with headaches, and the changes in IOP determined by pharmacologically inducing miosis and mydriasis were recorded. Three treatment groups were formed and the results analyzed statistically.", 
    "68": "In the 12 patients treated pharmacologically, 62% improved and in 14% the headaches disappeared. In the 16 treated using laser 94% were cured and 6% improved. When both types of treatment were used on 9 patients, 22% improved and 78% were cured. The validity of the ocular pressure curve was checked in the diagnosis of blockage of the pupil.", 
    "69": "Some headaches of ocular origin (ophthalmotonic), not previously described, occur due to abrupt changes in intraocular pressure, and improve significantly when the IOP is reduced by beta-blockers or Yag-laser iridectomies are done. A valid provocation tests for diagnosis of this type of headache is described. We consider that blockage of the pupil and/or of the angle of the anterior chamber are possible etiopathogenic mechanisms.", 
    "70": "These is increasing evidence to suggest that central noradrenergic mechanisms may contribute to the central nervous system manifestations of acute liver failure. To further elucidate this possibility, extracellular brain concentrations of the monoamines, noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), and serotonin, were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in microdialysates from the extracellular compartment of frontal cortex in rats with acute (ischemic) liver failure at various times during the progression of encephalopathy and brain edema, as well as in obligate control groups of animals. In addition, binding sites for the noradrenergic receptor subtype ligands, [3H]-prazosin (alpha1 sites), [3H]-RX821002 (alpha2 sites), and [125]I-iodopindolol (beta sites), were assessed using quantitative receptor autoradiography in regions of the brains of rats at coma stage of acute liver failure and of control groups of animals. Coma stages of encephalopathy in acute liver failure were associated with selectively increased noradrenaline concentrations (P < .05) and a concomitant selective loss of alpha1 and beta1 sites in frontal cortex and thalamus. These findings add to a growing body of evidence that central noradrenergic function is modified in acute liver failure and suggest that alpha1/beta1 receptor-mediated noradrenergic mechanisms may play a role in the pathogenesis of brain edema and encephalopathy in this condition.", 
    "71": "We 1) evaluated whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) is produced in the peripheral circulation in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), 2) estimated the factors for increased IL-6, and 3) clarified the prognostic role of high plasma levels of IL-6 in patients with CHF.", 
    "72": "Although plasma levels of IL-6 have been reported to increase in patients with CHF, and production of IL-6 in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells has been postulated from in vitro studies, the origin of the increase of IL-6 in CHF remains unknown. Moreover, the prognostic value of a high plasma level of IL-6, independent of classic neurohumoral factors, remains to be elucidated.", 
    "73": "A comparison was made of the plasma levels of IL-6 between the femoral artery and the femoral vein in 13 normal subjects and in 80 patients with CHF. In another study, we measured plasma IL-6 in 100 patients with CHF and follow-up data.", 
    "74": "Plasma IL-6 levels increased significantly from the femoral artery to the femoral vein in normal subjects and in patients with CHF. Arteriovenous IL-6 spillover in the leg increased with the severity of CHF. Among the hemodynamic variables and the various neurohumoral factors, the plasma norepinephrine (NE) level showed an independent and significant positive relation with the plasma IL-6 level in patients with CHF. Moreover, treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents showed an independent and significant negative relation with plasma IL-6 levels. In 100 patients, plasma IL-6 (p < 0.0001), NE (p = 0.0004) and left ventricular ejection fraction (0.015) were significant independent prognostic predictors by Cox proportional hazards analysis.", 
    "75": "Our findings indicate that the IL-6 spillover in the peripheral circulation increases with the severity of CHF and that the increase in plasma IL-6 is mainly associated with the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. High plasma levels of IL-6 can provide prognostic information in patients with CHF, independent of left ventricular ejection fraction and plasma NE, suggesting an important role for IL-6 in the pathophysiology of CHF.", 
    "76": "To investigate whether the expression of angiotensinogen (ANG) in rat kidney proximal tubules is stimulated by dexamethasone and isoproterenol, immortalized rat proximal tubular cells (IRPTC) were cultured in a monolayer. Immunoreactive rat ANG (IR-rANG) in the culture medium was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) for rANG. This RIA was developed by employing rabbit antiserum against the purified recombinant rat ANG (rANG). The purified rANG from plasma and the iodinated rANG were used as the hormone standard and tracer, respectively. The RIA is specific for rat ANG and it has no cross-reactivity with other pituitary hormone preparations or other rat plasma proteins. The sensitivity of detection of the RIA is approximately 2 ng of rANG. The levels of IR-rANG in the culture media of IRPTC ranged from 2 to 5 ng/ml/24 hr/10(6) cells. The addition of dexamethasone (10(-13) to 10(-5) M) stimulated the expression and secretion of rANG from IRPTC in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the addition of isoproterenol alone had no effect. However, a combination of both dexamethasone and isoproterenol synergistically stimulated the expression and secretion of rANG by IRPTC. The synergistic effect of dexamethasone and isoproterenol was blocked by the presence of RU 486 (a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist) or propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor blocker). These studies suggest that the addition of dexamethasone and isoproterenol acts synergistically to stimulate the expression and secretion of ANG protein in rat proximal tubules in vivo.", 
    "77": "The effect of long-term atenolol therapy on the structural and functional parameters of the left-ventricular (LV) myocardium was studied in patients with dilatational cardiomyopathy by means of echocardiography. Six-months treatment with atenolol improved the clinical status and reduced the degree of LV dilatation in patients with circulatory insufficiency of functional classes I and II. The contractility parameters (ejection fraction and delta S) increased in patients of all functional classes but more markedly in those of functional classes I and II. The effect of atenolol on the transmitral diastolic flow in patients with the initial stages of chronic circulatory insufficiency was characterized by the absence of changes in the flow rate during the period of rapid filling and a significant lowering of the atrial peak, which corresponded to improvement in the patients' status.", 
    "78": "We present the results of sequential imaging studies conducted in two patients with dilated cardiomyopathy whose responses to long-term beta-blocker therapy differed. We evaluated the time course of the myocardial clearance and the heart to upper mediastinal ratios of I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy. In the first patient, the left ventricular ejection fraction as well as the clinical symptoms were improved by long-term beta-blocker therapy with a concurrent normalization of the myocardial clearance and the heart to upper mediastinal ratio of I-123 MIBG scintigraphy. The myocardial clearance and the upper mediastinal ratio of I-123 MIBG indicated no improvement in the second patient, and the left ventricular function did not change. The myocardial clearance and the heart to upper mediastinal ratio of I-123 MIBG scintigraphy were useful in evaluating the efficacy of long-term beta-blocker therapy in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "79": "Despite extensive investigation, the control of blood flow during dynamic exercise is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine whether beta-adrenergic or muscarinic receptors are involved in the vasodilation in exercising skeletal muscle. Six mongrel dogs were instrumented with ultrasonic flow probes on both external iliac arteries and with a catheter in a branch of one femoral artery. The dogs exercised on a treadmill at 6 miles/h while drugs were injected intra-arterially into one hindlimb. Isoproterenol (0.2 microg) or acetylcholine (1 microg) elicited increases in iliac blood flow of 89.8 +/- 14.4 and 95.6 +/- 17.4%, respectively, without affecting systemic blood pressure or blood flow in the contralateral iliac artery. Intra-arterial propranolol (1 mg) or atropine (500 microg) had no effect on iliac blood flow, although they abolished the isoproterenol and acetylcholine-induced increases in iliac blood flow. These data indicate that exogenous activation of beta-adrenergic or muscarinic receptors in the hindlimb vasculature increases blood flow to dynamically exercising muscle. More importantly, because neither propranolol nor atropine affected iliac blood flow, we conclude that beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors are not involved in the control of blood flow to skeletal muscle during moderate steady-state dynamic exercise in dogs.", 
    "80": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the immune changes seen during in vivo whole body hyperthermia are mediated by elevations in the plasma concentrations of either catecholamines, growth hormone or beta-endorphins. Eight healthy volunteers were immersed in a hot water bath (WI; water temperature 39.5 degrees C) for 2 h during which their rectal temperature rose to 39.5 degrees C. In a single blind, randomized, cross-over study the stress hormone effects were blocked one at a time by administration of propranolol, somatostatin or naloxone; the results were compared to those obtained during saline infusion (control). Blood samples were collected before, at the end of 2 h of WI (body temperature 39.5 degrees C), and 2 h later. Hormone blockade did not abolish the hyperthermia-induced recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells to the blood, and no influence was observed on the percentages or concentrations of any other subpopulations of blood mononuclear cells, except that the number of cluster designation (CD)3+ cells slightly increased after hyperthermia only in the propranolol experiment. Furthermore, the NK cell activity, both unstimulated and interferon-alpha or interleukin-2 stimulated, did not differ from the control situation. It is of interest, however, that somatostatin partly abolished the hyperthermia induced increase in the neutrophil number. Based on these data and previous results showing that growth hormone infusion increases the concentration of neutrophils in the blood, it is suggested that growth hormone is at least partly responsible for hyperthermia induced neutrocytosis.", 
    "81": "A windkessel model was applied on a beat-to-beat basis to evaluate the arterial mechanical characteristics in seven conscious rats. Ascending aortic arterial pressure (AP) and blood flow were recorded during steady-state in basal conditions, during infusions of isoprenaline, sodium nitroprusside, and phenylephrine, and after intravenous atenolol injection. For each cardiac cycle the exponential decay time constant (tau) was estimated from the aortic AP curve, peripheral resistances (R) were taken as the ratio of mean AP to cardiac output, and systemic arterial compliance (C) was calculated as tau/R. In all conditions, mean correlation coefficients of the exponential regression and approximately 70% of values in each rat were > 0.99, demonstrating the model validity. In all conditions tau and C exhibited a large spontaneous variability over time, and beat-to-beat correlations were high between tau and C (0.83 +/- 0.03). C was increased by sodium nitroprusside, decreased by isoprenaline, but not significantly decreased by phenylephrine [5.1 +/- 0.2, 3.2 +/- 0.3, and 3.9 +/- 0.2 microliters/mmHg, respectively, vs. 4.2 +/- 0.3 microliters/mmHg (baseline)]. In conclusion, the windkessel model enables tau and C to be reliably estimated in conscious rats during spontaneous and drug-induced hemodynamic variations.", 
    "82": "We examined the role and the peripheral mechanism of action of central dopamine on basal pancreatic exocrine secretion in conscious rats. Rats were fitted with bile and pancreatic catheters to collect bile and pancreatic juice separately and also with a left lateral brain ventricle and external jugular vein catheters. After 90-min basal collection, the D1- and D2-receptor antagonists (Sch-23390 and eticlopride, respectively) and dopamine were administered into the lateral brain ventricle. Sch-23390 (30, 100, and 300 nmol/rat), but not eticlopride (300 nmol/rat), stimulated pancreatic fluid and protein secretion. Dopamine (30, 100, and 300 nmol/rat) inhibited pancreatic secretion lose dependently. Pretreatment with Sch-23390 prevented the inhibitory effect of dopamine. Intravenously injected Sch-23390 or dopamine had no effect on pancreatic secretion. The inhibitory effect of dopamine was blocked by bretylium, an inhibitor of norepinephrine release, and phentolamine, an alpha-blocker, but not by vagotomy. The beta-antagonist propranolol alone significantly inhibited basal pancreatic secretion, and dopamine did not modify the inhibitory effect of propranolol. The proton pump inhibitor omeprazole partially but not completely reduced the inhibition by dopamine. These results suggest that central dopamine inhibits pancreatic exocrine secretion via D1-like receptors and that the inhibitory effect is mediated via sympathetic nerves, especially alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "83": "Inverse agonists are ligands that preferentially stabilize inactive conformations of G protein-coupled receptors. In a range of systems, sustained treatment with inverse agonists can produce substantially greater upregulation of receptor levels than antagonists. The use of constitutively active mutant receptors can exaggerate this effect but may also allow agonists and antagonists to mimic the effect by preventing denaturation of the mutant receptor polypeptide. In this review Graeme Milligan and Richard Bond consider the basis for these effects and their therapeutic implications.", 
    "84": "Many clinical trials conducted in the 1970s and early 1980s have shown that the long-term use of beta-blockers after an acute myocardial infarction significantly reduces mortality and reinfarction rates. This study assessed the impact of these findings in clinical practice.", 
    "85": "We retrospectively analysed the beta-blocker prescriptions for 36,817 patients with acute myocardial infarction included in three large randomized clinical trials (Gruppo Italiano di Studio sulla Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico--GISSI, 1, 2, and 3), conducted by a highly representative sample (about 75%) of Italian coronary care units in 1984-85, 1988-89 and 1991-93.", 
    "86": "The prescription of beta-blockers at discharge increased gradually from 8.5% in 1984-85 to 25.0% in 1988-89 and to 31.4% in 1991-93. A similar trend was apparent for beta-blocker prescriptions 6 months after acute myocardial infarction. The strongest predictors of beta-blocker prescription are the presence of post-infarctual angina and a history of arterial hypertension. Besides the classical contraindications, advanced age, transitory cardiac failure or arrhythmias in the acute phase of acute myocardial infarction are important predictors of nonprescription.", 
    "87": "The use of beta-blockers after acute myocardial infarction in Italy has increased more than three-fold in the last decade, but they are still prescribed to too few patients, especially those at higher risk, for whom the expected benefit is greater.", 
    "88": "To characterize the effect of beta-adrenergic activation on renal production of renin in the intact organism.", 
    "89": "Renal expression of renin [renin messenger RNA (mRNA)], plasma renin activity (PRA), inactive renin level, intrarenal renin distribution (immunohistochemistry), and the time course of activation of renin as well as hemodynamic parameters were determined during the subcutaneous infusion of isoproterenol (ISO) into rats. To examine whether beta-adrenergic activation of the renin system is modulated by the rate of salt intake rats were fed diets with normal, low and high salt contents.", 
    "90": "Systolic blood pressure was not altered. PRA was elevated as much as fourfold after 40 h of ISO infusion. Although renal renin mRNA levels were elevated dose-dependently up to 4.2-fold, no significant recruitment of renin-containing cells could be detected. The time course of PRA revealed a marked transient rise of PRA during 6 h of ISO infusion with a subsequent decline. Inactive renin level was elevated during 3 to 18 h of ISO infusion. In contrast, renin mRNA level increased steadily with a lag phase of 3 h. Infusion of ISO increased PRA and renin mRNA level under a high-salt diet, but had no additional effect either on PRA or on renin mRNA level under low-salt diet.", 
    "91": "Activation of beta-adrenergic receptors is a powerful stimulus of renin secretion and renin gene expression in juxtaglomerular cells in vivo, albeit the kinetics of upregulation of renin secretion and renin expression are markedly different. Therefore, the sympathetic tone might be a major factor determining the activity of the renin system in vivo. The ability of adrenergic agonists to stimulate the renin system appears to be modulated by the steady-state level of salt intake.", 
    "92": "To assess the relevance of sympathetic nerves for the stimulation of renin secretion and renin gene expression during effective angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade in vivo.", 
    "93": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with the angiotensin II type 1-receptor blocker losartan (40 mg/kg) for 3 days. To examine the role of renal sympathetic nerves in the stimulation of the renin system by losartan, left kidneys were denervated 4 days prior to the treatment with losartan. Also, to examine the role of circulating catecholamines in the stimulation of the renin system by losartan, the animals were administered a combination treatment of losartan with the beta1-adrenoreceptor blocker metoprolol (50 mg/kg per day) for 3 days.", 
    "94": "Losartan treatment increased plasma renin activity about sevenfold and renal renin messenger RNA (mRNA) levels about fivefold and decreased systolic blood pressure from 118 to 95 mmHg. Administration of losartan elevated renin mRNA both in the innervated and in the denervated kidneys to the same level as it did in kidneys of normal animals. Losartan treatment increased plasma renin activity and renal renin mRNA levels in the beta1-blocker-treated rats to the same extent as it did in animals administered losartan only.", 
    "95": "These findings suggest that, under sub-chronic treatment with hypotensive doses of angiotensin II receptor blockers, sympathetic outflow plays no important mediator role in the characteristic stimulation of renin secretion and renin gene expression, suggesting that it is mainly a direct disinhibition of angiotensin II's action on the level of juxtaglomerular cells that accounts for the effect.", 
    "96": "Zolmitriptan (Zomig, formerly known as 311C90), a selective 5HT1B/1D agonist is under development as an acute oral treatment for migraine. Despite the use of prophylactic medication, such as propranolol, breakthrough attacks often occur in patients. Consequently we investigated the effects of propranolol on the pharmacokinetics of, and cardiovascular responses to, zolmitriptan.", 
    "97": "A double-blind, randomized, crossover study of the effects of pre-treatment with propranolol 160 mg daily for 7 days or placebo on the pharmacokinetics and effects on blood pressure of a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan in 12 healthy volunteers.", 
    "98": "Propranolol increased mean zolmitriptan Cmax and AUC by 56% and 37% respectively; mean t1/2 was prolonged from 3.1 to 4.0 h. Mean Cmax and AUC of the pharmacologically active N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 24% and 11% respectively and the metabolite:parent AUC ratio (AUCm/AUCp) fell from 0.46 to 0.26. Mean Cmax and AUC for the inactive indole acetic acid metabolite were both reduced by 13% and AUCm/AUCp from 1.04 to 0.59. A small pressor effect of short duration was observed following zolmitriptan with mean peak rises of 13 and 11 mmHg in systolic and diastolic pressures respectively; propranolol had no effect on the pressor response.", 
    "99": "The results suggest that propranolol inhibits biotransformation of zolmitriptan but with no change in the small pressor response to zolmitriptan. It is therefore unlikely that the pharmacokinetic changes will lead to clinically important changes in pharmacological effects and dosage adjustment of zolmitriptan is not required in patients taking propranolol for migraine prophylaxis.", 
    "100": "The catecholaminergic neuronal activity and the densities of alpha-1 and beta adrenoceptors and angiotensin II receptors were simultaneously determined in BIO 53.58, a model of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and F1B control hamsters. Further, we examined the effect of repeated p.o. administration of metoprolol on these biochemical parameters. Compared with F1B control hamsters, there was a significant decrease in Bmax of specific binding of both (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol and [3H]prazosin with a marked elevation of plasma catecholamine (mainly norepinephrine and epinephrine) concentrations, in BIO 53.58 hamsters at 11 and 18 weeks of age (severe cardiomyopathic stage), but not at 5 weeks of age. On the other hand, the Bmax value of myocardial [125I]angiotensin II binding in BIO 53.58 hamsters was almost identical to that in F1B hamsters. These results suggest a development of down-regulation of myocardial beta and alpha-1 adrenoceptors because of an increased catecholaminergic neuronal activity with aging in BIO 53.58 hamsters. Repeated p.o. administration of a relatively low dose (1 mg/kg/day) of metoprolol for 7 weeks in 11-week-old BIO 53.58 hamsters caused a significant increase of myocardial (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol binding sites with a marked reduction in plasma catecholamine levels; this indicated a significant recovery to the F1B levels. The improvement of these biochemical parameters by metoprolol treatment was also accompanied by a significant decrease in the fibrosis in the heart in BIO 53.58 hamsters. These data suggest that catecholaminergic neurons and adrenoceptors play a part in the development of heart failure in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Consequently, the present study may provide a further pharmacological basis for the use of beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "101": "Evidence indicates that the modulatory effects of the adrenergic stress hormone epinephrine as well as several other neuromodulatory systems on memory storage are mediated by activation of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in the amygdala. In view of our recent findings indicating that the amygdala is involved in mediating the effects of glucocorticoids on memory storage, the present study examined whether the glucocorticoid-induced effects on memory storage depend on beta-adrenergic activation within the amygdala. Microinfusions (0.5 microg in 0.2 microl) of either propranolol (a nonspecific beta-adrenergic antagonist), atenolol (a beta1-adrenergic antagonist), or zinterol (a beta2-adrenergic antagonist) administered bilaterally into the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) of male Sprague-Dawley rats 10 min before training blocked the enhancing effect of posttraining systemic injections of dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg) on 48-h memory for inhibitory avoidance training. Infusions of these beta-adrenergic antagonists into the central nucleus of the amygdala did not block the dexamethasone-induced memory enhancement. Furthermore, atenolol (0.5 microg) blocked the memory-enhancing effects of the specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR or type II) agonist RU 28362 infused concurrently into the BLA immediately posttraining. These results strongly suggest that beta-adrenergic activation is an essential step in mediating glucocorticoid effects on memory storage and that the BLA is a locus of interaction for these two systems.", 
    "102": "Human epithelial kidney cells (HEK) were prepared to coexpress alpha1A, alpha2delta with different beta calcium channel subunits and green fluorescence protein. To compare the calcium currents observed in these cells with the native neuronal currents, electrophysiological and pharmacological tools were used conjointly. Whole-cell current recordings of human epithelial kidney alpha1A-transfected cells showed small inactivating currents in 80 mM Ba2+ that were relatively insensitive to calcium blockers. Coexpression of alpha1A, betaIb, and alpha2delta produced a robust inactivating current detected in 10 mM Ba2+, reversibly blockable with low concentration of omega-agatoxin IVA (omega-Aga IVA) or synthetic funnel-web spider toxin (sFTX). Barium currents were also supported by alpha1A, beta2a, alpha2delta subunits, which demonstrated the slowest inactivation and were relatively insensitive to omega-Aga IVA and sFTX. Coexpression of beta3 with the same combination as above produced inactivating currents also insensitive to low concentration of omega-Aga IVA and sFTX. These data indicate that the combination alpha1A, betaIb, alpha2delta best resembles P-type channels given the rate of inactivation and the high sensitivity to omega-Aga IVA and sFTX. More importantly, the specificity of the channel blocker is highly influenced by the beta subunit associated with the alpha1A subunit.",

    "104": "The effect of rac-sotalol on QT interval duration was studied in 10 patients after single oral administration (160 mg) and after 6-day multiple oral dosing (80 mg two or three times daily). In order to separate the pure Class III effect from the bradycardia-related QT prolongation, heart rate/QT relationship was preliminarly assessed in each patient after the administration of a pure beta-adrenoceptor blocker (propranolol, 80 mg orally). Repolarization changes were quantified as percent difference between the measured QT and the expected QT on the basis of the individual heart rate/QT relationship.", 
    "105": "In all patients QT interval prolongation was linearly correlated with rac-sotalol log plasma concentration. The maximal QT prolongation and peak plasma concentration were not significantly different following acute and chronic administrations (QT effect: +18.1+/-6.3% vs +14.2+/-3.3%; peak concentration: 1.64+/-0.49 mg l(-1) vs 1.83+/-0.66 mg l(-1)). Line slopes were also unchanged following chronic treatment (21.8+/-8.9 vs 21.1+/-9.2). In four cases a significant rightward shift of the line occurred during repeated administrations, consistent with the appearance of pharmacodynamic tolerance. The inconstancy of this change in responsiveness may either be ascribed to a genetically determined individual susceptibility or to a variable interplay between Class III effect, gradual QT prolongation due to long-term beta-adrenoceptor blockade and tolerance development.", 
    "106": "During maintenance treatment with rac-solatol, partial loss of repolarization effects occurred in some patients suggesting pharmacological tolerance.", 
    "107": "Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, have been shown to exert anticonvulsant effects in several animal models of epilepsy. In view of recent studies showing that 5-HT1A receptor antagonists (somatodendritic autoreceptor antagonists) enhance the increase in extracellular 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) produced by serotonin reuptake inhibitors, it was of interest to determine if these antagonists also enhance the anticonvulsant effect of fluoxetine in Genetically Epilepsy-Prone Rats (GEPRs). The 5-HT1A receptor antagonists (-)-pindolol and LY 206130 (1-[1-H-indol-4-yloxy]-3-[cyclohexylamino]-2-propanol maleate) were examined in the present study and both enhanced the anticonvulsant action of fluoxetine in severe seizure GEPRs (GEPR-9s). The latter effect of LY 206130 was found to be dose- and 5-HT-dependent. These findings provide further evidence that the increase in extracellular serotonin observed after administering fluoxetine in combination with a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist is physiologically important and that the anticonvulsant effect of fluoxetine in the GEPR is mediated through an increase in extracellular 5-HT.", 
    "108": "Patients after myocardial infarction are at a substantial risk for recurrent cardiac events; therefore, an optimal patient care is of great importance. Early revascularisation is one important contributor to the prognosis after myocardial infarction. Antithrombotic agents, betablockers, and ACE-inhibitors also contribute significantly to the improved outcome after myocardial infarction. Reduction of risk factors, in particular cessation of smoking and lowering of lipids are of highest importance to improve the prognosis after myocardial infarction.", 
    "109": "We report here a new family with thyroid hormone resistance (RTH), with phenotypic variability among subjects. Particular emphasis is given to the clinical and hormonal outcome after 2 years of triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC) treatment in an affected child with peripheral thyrotoxic features (pituitary RTH [PRTH]). The genetic defect was a substitution in position 1642 (C to A) within the exon 10 of thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TRbeta1) gene, resulting in the codon change P453T. The mutant receptor had a significantly reduced triiodothyronine (T3) binding affinity. Within this family, the child and the mother suffered from hyperthyroidism and were clinically classified as PRTH, while the maternal grandmother was clinically euthyroid, indicating a generalized form of the disease (GRTH). Rapid normalization of heart rate was initially obtained by the association of the cardioselective beta-blocker atenolol with TRIAC. Nevertheless, long-term TRIAC therapy, through its lowering action of serum thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroid hormone levels, maintained a normal heart rate after atenolol discontinuation and normalized the neurological disturbances and the clinical signs in the child, without any apparent side effect. In fact, growth velocity remained unchanged and no alteration of several parameters of thyroid hormone action at the tissue level was observed, whereas soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels improved significantly, confirming the safety and efficacy of long-term TRIAC therapy for PRTH also during childhood. We thus recommend testing the efficacy of TRIAC therapy in all RTH patients presenting with clinical features of hyperthyroidism.", 
    "110": "The ocular ciliary epithelium is a bilayer of neuroepithelial cells specialized in the secretion of aqueous humor fluid and the regulation of intraocular pressure. In this study, we report on the expression of the regulatory peptide neurotensin (NT) and a set of differentiated neuroendocrine markers including neurotensin receptors (NTrs), the prohormone convertases furin, PC1, and PC2, and the neuroendocrine polypeptide 7B2 in the ciliary epithelium. Using a human cell line, ODM-2, derived from the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium, we demonstrate that (1) NT expression is highly activated by nerve growth factor, glucocorticoid, and activators of adenylate cyclase; (2) NTr expression is up-regulated by selective ligand-activated beta2-adrenergic receptor; and (3) PC1 and PC2 expression are up-regulated via distinct signaling transduction pathways. PC1 gene expression is activated by phorbol ester, and PC2 by the same inducers as those of NT expression. A radioimmunoassay for NT detected an NT-like immunoreactivity in human ciliary epithelium and ODM-2 cell extracts, in aqueous humor, and in conditioned culture medium. The results support the view that the entire ciliary epithelium functions as a neuroendocrine tissue, synthesizing, processing, and releasing NT into the aqueous humor where it may exert important physiological functions through autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms.", 
    "111": "The effects of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker pindolol and the calcium antagonist verapamil administered alone or in combination on retention in step-down- and shuttle-box-trained rats and on the biogenic monoamine levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus were examined. The chronic oral treatment with pindolol impaired retention in step-down- and shuttle-box-trained rats, decreasing the dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) levels and increasing the serotonin (5-HT) levels in the cortex and hippocampus. Verapamil did not influence retention in step-down- and shuttle-box avoidance situation and the biogenic monoamine levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. It should, however, be noted that the chronic oral treatment with verapamil completely abolished the retention-impairing effect of pindolol, restoring to normal DA, NA and 5-HT levels. These findings might be of interest to clinical practice and suggest the necessity for using a combination of beta-blockers with Ca2+ antagonists in case of prolonged treatment of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "112": "1. Electrical field stimulation (EFS) of the rat lower esophageal sphincter produced tetrodotoxin-sensitive relaxant responses. 2. The relaxant responses were not significantly affected by propranolol but were attenuated by 6-hydroxydopamine and cyanopindolol, indicating beta 3-adrenoceptor activation. 3. The relaxant responses were significantly reduced in tissues previously exposed to BRL 37344, a beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist. 4. It was concluded that EFS-induced relaxation was adrenergic in origin and was mediated by beta 3-adrenoceptors.",

    "114": "A randomized, double-masked, multicenter study was conducted in 209 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, whose intraocular pressure (IOP) was higher than 21 mm Hg on bet-blocker twice a day alone. The test medications were administered twice daily for 4 months. IOP was measured at 9 and 11 a.m. at the beginning of the study (with beta-blocker alone) and after one and four months of treatment. Adverse effects were recorded.", 
    "115": "Both combinations caused a similar, statistically significant decrease in IOP. At four months, in the CBS341A group a 2.4 mm Hg (9%) reduction in IOP was achieved at 9 a.m. and 4.1 mm Hg (17.3%) at 11 a.m. compared with respectively 3 mm Hg (11%) and 4.5 mm Hg (19.5%) in the timolol-pilocarpine group. No statistical difference was observed between the two groups in safety and efficacy.",

    "117": "Two studies were conducted to check the effects of beta-blocker eye drops, 2% carteolol (Mikelan) and 0.5% timolol (Timoptol), on regeneration of corneal epithelium in rabbit eyes. For the short-term study, epithelial deficiency was artificially induced in the cornea of albino rabbits. One of the beta-blocker eye drops or 0.005% benzalkonium chloride was applied in the right eye and physiological saline solution was applied to the left eye four times a day, and wound healing rate was calculated. Two weeks later, images of the surface epithelium were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and proliferative capacity was studied, using proliferating cell nuclear antigen as a marker. The long-term study was conducted similarly except that the eye drops were applied twice a day and epithelial deficiency was re-induced every two weeks. In the short-term study, epithelial wound healing rate was slowed in beta-blocker groups. Significant differences were detected between the Mikelan and Timoptol groups, and the benzalkonium and physiological saline groups. The beta-blocker groups had severe epithelial cell desquamation, as well as detachment. In the long-term study, the Mikelan group had significantly delayed wound healing at first induction, the benzalkonium group showed delay up to the third induction and the Timoptol group up to the fifth induction. These studies indicate that beta-blocker eye drops delay corneal epithelial wound healing and supported the concept that corneal epithelial deficiency occurs clinically after the long-term administration of beta-blocker eye drops.", 
    "118": "The effects of a vasodilating beta-blocker, celiprolol, on insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular risk factors were compared with those of another beta1-selective adrenoceptor blocker, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. A randomized 21-month crossover trial was carried out with 25 patients with dyslipidemia receiving antihypertensive monotherapy. The study consisted of a 3-month active run-in period and two treatment periods, during which the patients received celiprolol (200-400 mg daily) or the control drug for 12 and 6 months in a crossover manner. A hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed every 6 months. According to the clamp tests, the insulin-sensitivity index increased on average by 32% (p < 0.0001) during celiprolol treatment compared with that with the other antihypertensive agents, including ACE inhibitors. In OGTT, area under the incremental glucose curve decreased by 36% (p = 0.002) during celiprolol treatment, whereas insulin secretion diminished on average by 26% (p = 0.006). The mean decrease in fasting serum triglycerides was 11% (NS), whereas the high-density lipoprotein to low-density lipoprotein (HDL/LDL) ratio increased by 15% (p = 0.012). The results suggest that celiprolol improves insulin sensitivity of hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia in long-term therapy.", 
    "119": "Considering the Survival With ORal D-sotalol (SWORD) study results, in which mortality was higher in patients treated by the pure class III agent D-sotalol, we tested DL- and D-sotalol (5 and 10 microM) in an in vitro model of \"border zone\" arrhythmias. Isolated guinea-pig ventricular strips were partly exposed to normoxia (\"Normal Zone,\" NZ) and partly to modified Tyrode's solution (\"Ischemic Zone,\" IZ) for 15 or 30 min (\"ischemia\"), followed by return to normoxia for 30 min (\"reperfusion\"). Resting membrane potential, action potential (AP) amplitude, and maximal upstroke velocity of AP were not significantly modified. DL- And D-sotalol, 5 and 10 microM, lengthened AP duration 90% (APD90) in NZ (p < 0.05), whereas these drugs were unable to prevent ischemia-induced APD shortening. By using the accelerated failure time Weibull's model, and a large number of reference experiments to control random variability of analyzed covariates, DL- and D-sotalol increased significantly the incidence of spontaneous arrhythmias during ischemia (chi2 = 24.79; p = 0.0367): 83 (5 microM D- and DL-sotalol), 86, and 62% (10 microM D- and DL-sotalol, respectively) versus 32% of controls. During reperfusion, 10 microM DL-sotalol prevented the occurrence of spontaneous arrhythmias (chi2 = 46.74; p = 0.0001) similar to what seen with the beta-blocking agent propranolol (10 microM). These data, providing evidence for proarrhythmic effects of DL- and D-sotalol on border-zone arrhythmias, concomitant with differential class III actions on NZ versus IZ, might be considered for understanding the SWORD study results.", 
    "120": "New-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) is frequent after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and beta-blockers decrease its incidence. To examine whether a beta-blocker with class III properties is superior to a pure one, 191 consecutive patients undergoing CABG were randomized to receive oral sotalol, 120 mg daily (n = 93), or metoprolol, 75 mg daily (n = 98), postoperatively. The doses were adjusted if beta-blockade was inadequate or excessive. AF occurred in 16 (16%) of 98 sotalol patients and in 30 (32%) of 93 metoprolol patients (p < 0.01). Symptoms related to beta-blockade or proarrhythmia did not appear. After CABG, sinus heart rate increased in both groups (p < 0.001) but less in the sotalol patients (p < 0.001) throughout the postoperative period. Corrected QT duration (by the Bazett equation) was prolonged after the operation in both groups (p < 0.001), whereas uncorrected QT duration at similar heart-rate levels were prolonged only in sotalol patients (mean increase, 31 ms; 95% confidence interval, 2042 ms; p < 0.01). Uncorrected QT durations at similar heart-rate levels were longer during sotalol (compared with metoprolol) treatment (p < 0.05). Heart rates or QT durations did not differ between the patients with or without AF. In conclusion, sotalol significantly reduces the incidence of AF after CABG. Although a marked class III effect is demonstrated with relatively low doses (as prolonged ventricular repolarization) in direct comparison unbiased by any rate correction, its contribution as an enhanced antifibrillatory mechanism in the postoperative state remains unconfirmed.", 
    "121": "The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that an increase in the alpha1-adrenoceptor tone would potentiate the myocardial biphasic contractile response to inorganic phosphate [Pi, the substrate of Na/Pi-cotransporter (NP)]. A second aim was to determine whether activation of alpha1-adrenoceptor is necessary for the NP-mediated increase in myocardial contractility (+dP/dt). Earlier study from this laboratory showed that high concentration of Pi (10 mM) produces a biphasic contractile response: initial increase in +dP/dt was followed by decline. In another study, Pi (3.5 mM) potentiated phenylephrine (PHE)-induced increase in +dP/dt. The alpha1-adrenoceptor was not blocked in these studies, and it can still be activated by the electrical stimulation of the sympathetic nerve terminals to the heart. Additionally, alpha1-adrenoceptor-activated increases in the activity of NP have been reported in numerous studies in noncardiac tissues and cell lines; therefore it is not clear whether Pi-induced increase in +dP/dt occurs only in the presence of alpha1-adrenoceptor activation. This study was performed by using isolated perfused rat heart in the condition of controlled extracellular calcium activity (0.72 mM); fixed preload (15 mm Hg); and constant heart rate (280 beats/min) and coronary flow (8 ml/min). The electronically differentiated value of the left ventricular pressure (LVP) signal was used as an index of myocardial contractility. The data show that activation of the alpha1-adrenoceptor is not necessary for the Pi-induced increase in +dP/dt (i.e., NP-mediated increase in +dP/dt has both the alpha1-adrenoceptor-dependent and alpha1-adrenoceptor-independent components. The interaction between alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist (PHE) and Pi (10 mM) did not produce a biphasic myocardial contractile response in the presence of propranolol. Because our earlier data on myocardial biphasic contractile response to 10 mM Pi was obtained when neither the beta- nor the alpha-adrenoceptor was blocked, we carried out more studies to see whether beta-adrenoceptor plays a role in this Pi-induced biphasic response. When both the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors were activated with norepinephrine (NE), myocardial depression by high Pi concentration was markedly potentiated. This myocardial depression did not occur in the presence of phosphonoformate, a selective inhibitor of NP. It also did not occur when alpha1-adrenoceptor was blocked. Our data suggest that alpha1- and beta-adrenoceptors do not interact with the cardiac NP to potentiate the Pi-induced biphasic contractile response, but they interact in a manner that potentiates Pi-induced myocardial depression.", 
    "122": "Tachyphylaxis to the cardiac effects of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation after long-term beta2-agonist administration is well recognized, but the influence on global cardiac beta-adrenoceptor density has not been previously investigated in vivo.

Mononuclear leukocyte (MNL) beta-receptor density was determined in vitro by means of a radioligand binding assay. Beta-receptor density was 8.41 +/- 2.03 pmol/gm tissue in heart, 10.81 +/- 1.91 pmol/gm tissue in lung, and 38.0 +/- 17.5 fmol/mg protein on MNLs. There was a weak relationship between cardiac and pulmonary beta-receptor densities (r = 0.45, p < 0.02) but not between cardiac and MNL receptor density. In seven subjects, the measurements were repeated after 2 weeks of albuterol treatment (4 mg orally twice daily and 200 microg inhaled four times daily in the first week, with doubling of the dose during the second week). After the albuterol treatment, beta-receptor density fell on average by 19% (p < 0.05) in the heart compared with 22% (p < 0.05) in the lung and 42% (p < 0.05) in MNLs. Correlations were found between the percentage changes in receptor density in heart and lung (r = 0.98, p < 0.001) and in heart and MNLs (r = 0.99, p < 0.002).",

    "130": "The effects on parameters of the capillary system of the beta 1-blocker bisoprolol and of the alpha 1/beta-blocker carvedilol were investigated in 12 healthy female and 12 male non-smokers and smokers and in 20 hypertensive patients (state WHO I-II). Besides the antihypertensive and heart rate-reducing effect, carvedilol but not bisoprolol provoked a short-term increase in the capillary red blood cell velocity by 20% and an increase in the oxygen tension (tcpO2) in healthy smokers by 27% (p < 0.05). In hypertensive patients the single intake of carvedilol enhanced the capillary velocity by 16% after the first dose, the effect decreased by 5.4% after the intake for 4 weeks. The simultaneously observed increase in tcpO2 lasted only 30 min post dose, while bisoprolol was without significant effects. Carvedilol did not change the venous capacity after the first dose but increased it by 35% after intake for 4 weeks, while bisoprolol with its slight peripheral resistance-enhancing effect decreased the venous capacity after intake for 2 and 4 weeks. The venous outflow increased 1.5 and 2 h after carvedilol administration, but this was not seen 2 and 4 weeks later. The deformability of red blood cells was not changed by both beta-blockers. The data in volunteers and hypertensives indicate a weak vasodilating effect of carvedilol in contrast to bisoprolol in the arterial and venous capillary bed. These effects must be confirmed by additional studies.", 
    "131": "Variceal hemorrhage still carries a high mortality and a high risk of recurrence. Esophageal varices bleed rarely with a porto-systemic pressure gradient below 12 mmHg; pharmacotherapy, thus, aims at lowering the pressure gradient below this critical threshold. Conceptually, this can be achieved by decreasing portal-venous inflow (via lowering cardiac output and/or increasing splanchnic-arteriolar vasoconstriction) or by decreasing portal-venous resistence (via portal vasodilation). In acute variceal bleeding, easily applicable pharmacotherapy with terlipressin plus nitroglycerin, probably also with octreotide, can help to stabilize the patient and to buy time until diagnostic endoscopy and treatment by sclerotherapy or variceal band ligation. For pharmacotherapeutic secondary prophylaxes of variceal hemorrhage the combination of propranolol or nadolol with isosorbid-5-mononitrate is available. Future studies will tell, whether this drug combination is superior to the nowadays established endoscopic eradication of varices, especially by long-term variceal band ligation. For primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage non-selective beta-anatagonists remain the therapy of choice in compliant patients with esophageal varices and endoscopic signs indicating a high risk of bleeding. Future studies must clarify the role of the beta-antagonist-nitrate combination, as well as that of prophylactic variceal band ligation, in this setting.", 
    "132": "An increased spatial dispersion of ventricular repolarization duration (QT dispersion) is associated with an increased vulnerability to arrhythmias. This study was designed to examine the effect of exercise on QT dispersion in ischemic heart disease (IHD). QT dispersion, corrected QT dispersion, and percentage change in uncorrected and corrected QT dispersion between rest and peak exercise were examined in 14 members of a control group, 17 patients with IHD, and 14 patients with IHD who were receiving beta-blockers (IHD-B). All subjects had undergone a standard Bruce protocol exercise test, and QT intervals were measured at rest and peak exercise with a digitizing tablet interfaced to a personal computer. QT dispersion at rest was markedly increased in the IHD group compared with that in the control and IHD-B groups, respectively (corrected QT dispersion in milliseconds), 74 +/- 7, 40 +/- 4, 49 +/- 5, p < 0.03). The corrected QT dispersion at peak exercise was greater in the IHD group compared with that in the control group (57 +/- 5 vs 26 +/- 3 msec, p < 0.03). The percentage change in QT dispersion with exercise was significantly higher in the IHD group (52% +/- 5%) compared with that in both the control group (28% +/- 4%, p < 0.002) and the IHD-B group (30% +/- 3%, p < 0.01). A larger mean QT dispersion at peak exercise and an increased percentage change in QT dispersion with exercise may help explain the increased susceptibility of the IHD group for arrhythmias. The cardioprotective action of beta-blockers may be explained by their blunting effect on exercise-related changes in QT dispersion."
