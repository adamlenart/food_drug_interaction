The major action is on the hypothalamus to decrease release of LH-releasing hormone (LHRH). The release of LHRH is controlled by nitric oxide (NO) as determined by in vivo and in vitro experiments. The hypothesized pathway is via norepinephrine (NE)-induced release of NO from NOergic neurons, which activates LHRH release. We have evaluated details of this process in male rats by incubating medial basal hypothalamic (MBH) explants in vitro and examining the release of NO and metabolites generated by NO that control LHRH release. NE increased release of NO as measured by determining the content of the enzyme at the end of the experiment (30 min) by adding [14C]arginine to the homogenate and measuring its conversion to [14C]citrulline since this is formed in equimolar quantities with NO by NO synthase (NOS). Because this increase in content, presumably caused by activation of the enzyme by NE, was blocked by the alpha 1 receptor blocker prazosin, it appears that alpha 1 receptors activate NOS by increasing intracellular free calcium in the NOergic neurons, which combines with calmodulin to activate NOS. The release of LHRH induced by nitroprusside (NP), a donor of NO, is accompanied by an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the medium supporting the activation of guanylate cyclase by NO. This activation is important in releasing LHRH since addition of 8-monobutyryl cGMP also released the peptide. Ethanol had no effect on the content of NOS or on the increase in content induced by NE, indicating that it did not act on NOS. Earlier experiments indicated that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was important in releasing LHRH. PGE2 is produced by activation of cyclooxygenase by NO since this occurred following addition of the NO donor, NP. Not only does NP increase PGE2 release, but it also increases the conversion of [14C]arachidonic acid to its metabolites, particularly PGE2, by activating cyclooxygenase. NP also activated lipoxygenase as indicated by increased release of leukotrienes, which also stimulate LHRH release. Ethanol acts at this step, because it completely blocked the release of PGE2, leukotrienes, and LHRH induced by NP. Therefore, the results support the theory that NE acts to stimulate NO release from NOergic neurons. This NO diffuses to the LHRH terminals, where it activates guanylate cyclase, leading to an increase in cGMP. At the same time, it also activates cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase. The increase in cGMP increases intracellular free calcium, required for activation of phospholipase A2. Phospholipase A2 converts membrane phospholipids into arachidonic acid, the substrate for conversion by the activated cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase to PGE2 and leukotrienes that activate the release of LHRH. Because alcohol inhibits conversion of labeled arachidonic acid to PGE2 and leukotrienes, it must act either directly to inhibit cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase or by some other mechanism which, in turn, inhibits the enzyme. We initially believed that the action of alcohol was exerted directly on the LHRH terminals; however, our recent experiments indicate that alcohol suppresses LHRH release, at least in part, by stimulating beta-endorphinergic neurons that inhibit the release of NE, which drives the NOergic release of LHRH.", 
    "1": "During infection, bacterial and viral products, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), cause the release of cytokines from immune cells. These cytokines can reach the brain by several routes. Furthermore, cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), are induced in neurons within the brain by systemic injection of LPS. These cytokines determine the pattern of hypothalamic-pituitary secretion which characterizes infection. IL-2, by stimulation of cholinergic neurons, activates neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). The nitric oxide (NO) released diffuses into corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-secreting neurons and releases CRH. IL-2 also acts in the pituitary to stimulate adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion. On the other hand, IL-1 alpha blocks the NO-induced release of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) from LHRH neurons, thereby blocking pulsatile LH but not follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) release and also inhibiting sex behavior that is induced by LHRH. IL-1 alpha and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) block the response of the LHRH terminals to NO. The mechanism of action of GMCSF to inhibit LHRH release is as follows. It acts on its receptors on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons to stimulate GABA release. GABA acts on GABAa receptors on the LHRH neuronal terminal to block NOergic stimulation of LHRH release. This concept is supported by blockade of GMCSF-induced suppression of LHRH release from medial basal hypothalamic explants by the GABAa receptor blocker, bicuculline. IL-1 alpha inhibits growth hormone (GH) release by inhibiting GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) release, which is mediated by NO, and stimulating somatostatin release, also mediated by NO. IL-1 alpha-induced stimulation of prolactin release is also mediated by intrahypothalamic action of NO, which inhibits release of the prolactin-inhibiting hormone dopamine. The actions of NO are brought about by its combined activation of guanylate cyclase-liberating cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and activation of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase with liberation of prostaglandin E2 and leukotrienes, respectively. Thus, NO plays a key role in inducing the changes in release of hypothalamic peptides induced in infection by cytokines. Cytokines, such as IL-1 beta, also act in the anterior pituitary gland, at least in part via induction of inducible NOS. The NO produced inhibits release of anterior pituitary hormones.", 
    "2": "Using an in vitro culture system, we investigated whether bovine trabecular meshwork cells undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) following exposure to anti-glaucoma medications (timolol, pilocarpine and epinephrine) and known inducers of apoptosis (5-fluorouracil, mitomycin-C and dexamethasone). Third to fifth passage bovine trabecular meshwork cells were grown to confluence and incubated for 1-12 days in growth media with timolol (1-1000 microM), pilocarpine (15-15,000 microM), epinephrine (5-5000 microM), 5-fluorouracil (10-100 micrograms ml-1), mitomycin-C (0.01-100 micrograms ml-1) and dexamethasone (0.01-100 microM). The cultures were evaluated for apoptosis by phase-contrast microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and in situ apoptosis labeling. 5-Fluorouracil (10-100 micrograms ml-1), mitomycin-C (0.1-100 micrograms ml-1) and epinephrine (500-5000 microM) induced apoptosis in a dose and time-dependent manner. Timolol, pilocarpine, and dexamethasone-treated specimens did not show evidence of apoptosis at any of the concentrations tested. Trabecular meshwork cells incubated in timolol (100-1000 microM) developed cytoplasmic granules, and specimens treated with pilocarpine (15,000 microM) developed cytoplasmic vacuoles. These granules and vacuoles have the appearance of secondary lysosomes. Dexamethasone-treated cells developed an increased number of mitochondria. This study suggests that the trabecular meshwork may undergo apoptosis following exposure to 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin-C and epinephrine. Timolol, pilocarpine and dexamethasone did not induce apoptosis. However, these drugs can incite characteristic morphologic changes in cultured trabecular meshwork cells.", 
    "3": "Torsade de pointes is a polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia associated with a long QT interval. The prognosis is excellent if torsade is recognized early. In the acquired long QT syndrome, measures should be taken quickly to identify and correct all predisposing conditions and to treat or prevent torsade. Established treatments of acquired torsade are magnesium bolus, electrolyte replacement, isoproterenol infusion and cardiac pacing. Sotalol overdose causing torsade is reported in which lidocaine appears to have suppressed an episode of torsade as well as prevented further episodes. Current understanding of the electrophysiological mechanisms of torsade and lidocaine, a review of the literature and the author's experience indicate that lidocaine is a potentially useful therapy in torsade.", 
    "4": "To elucidate whether and why glucose directly influences renin secretion, the effect of glucose on renin secretion was investigated in the rat. In an in vivo study, renin activity significantly (p<0.01) increased from the basal value of 7.6 +/- 1.4 to 14.2 +/- 3.2 ng Ang I/ml/hr (mean +/- SD) after intravenous glucose (1.0 g/kg, in 50% glucose solution ) injection. Propranolol (10.5 mg/kg) pretreatment partly abolished the increase in renin activity induced by glucose injection. In an in vitro study, the isolated kidneys of male Wistar rats (200-250 g) were perfused with a basal perfusing medium containing 5.5 mM glucose for 20 min, and then perfused with the medium containing 16.5 mM glucose, 27.5 mM glucose, 5.5 mM glucose + 22 mM mannitol, 27.5 mM glucose + 1 microM phentolamine, or 27.5 mM glucose + 1 microM propranolol for 10 min, respectively. Renin activity was significantly increased from a basal value of 8.1 +/- 4.5 to peak value of 17.9 +/- 3.0 ng Ang I/ml/hr (p<0.01) by 16.5 mM glucose, to 59.0 +/- 10.5 ng Ang I/ml/hr (p<0.005) by 27.5 mM glucose, and to 24.7 +/- 5.8 ng Ang I/ml/hr (p<0.01) by 5.5 mM glucose + 22 mM mannitol. The increase in renin activity in the kidney perfused with 27.5 mM glucose was significantly (p<0.005) higher than that with 16.5 mM glucose or that with 5.5 mM glucose + 22 mM mannitol. The 27.5 mM glucose-stimulated increase in renin activity was not changed by the addition of 1 microM phentolamine, while it was completely abolished by the addition of 1 microM propranolol. These results suggest that glucose has a direct stimulating effect on renin secretion probably through beta-adrenergic mechanisms in the rat.", 
    "5": "Nitrosation of propranolol under the standard conditions recommended by the World Health Organization (10 mM propranolol hydrochloride, 40 mM sodium nitrite, pH 3.5) was carried out in the absence and in the presence of phenol, benzenediols and benzenetriols added to the nitrosation mixture in concentrations ranging from 2 to 40 mM. The yield of N-nitrosopropranolol (NOP) was reduced, with potency decreasing in the following order, by 1,2-benzenediol > 1,2,3-benzenetriol > 1,4-benzediol; their inhibiting effect was dose-dependent. 1,2,4-Benzenetriol displayed a significant inhibitory activity only at 20-40 mM concentrations. The maximum reduction of NOP formation (7% of the yield obtained under control conditions) was produced at 120 min by 40 mM 1,2-benzenediol. In contrast, the yield of NOP was increased by 1,3-benzenediol and 1,3,5-benzenetriol, but this effect was inversely related to the concentration. The effect of the various phenols on the time course of propranolol nitrosation was dependent on both the test phenol and its concentration. 1,2-Benzenediol and 1,3-benzenediol displayed on the nitrosation of proline effects qualitatively of the same type, but quantitatively different, as compared with those observed on the nitrosation of propranolol. Taken as a whole, the results of this study indicate that depending on the positions of hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring benzenediols and benzenetriols may inhibit or hasten nitrosation reactions.",

No additional reduction in heart rate occurred when the ophthalmic timolol solution was administered in conjunction with diltiazem. The concomitant use of timolol and nicardipine or diltiazem did not induce an additional reduction in intraocular pressure. Oral nicardipine or diltiazem did not reduce intraocular pressure.

    "19": "The role of beta3- and other putative atypical beta-adrenoceptors in human white adipocytes and right atrial appendage has been investigated using CGP 12177 and novel phenylethanolamine and aryloxypropanolamine beta3-adrenoceptor (beta3AR) agonists with varying intrinsic activities and selectivities for human cloned betaAR subtypes. The ability to demonstrate beta1/2AR antagonist-insensitive (beta3 or other atypical betaAR-mediated) responses to CGP 12177 was critically dependent on the albumin batch used to prepare and incubate the adipocytes. Four aryloxypropanolamine selective beta3AR agonists (SB-226552, SB-229432, SB-236923, SB-246982) consistently elicited beta1/2AR antagonist-insensitive lipolysis. However, a phenylethanolamine (SB-220646) that was a selective full beta3AR agonist elicited full lipolytic and inotropic responses that were sensitive to beta1/2AR antagonism, despite it having very low efficacies at cloned beta1- and beta2ARs. A component of the response to another phenylethanolamine selective beta3AR agonist (SB-215691) was insensitive to beta1/2AR antagonism in some experiments. Because no [corrected] novel aryloxypropanolamine had a beta1/2AR antagonist-insensitive inotropic effect, these results establish more firmly that beta3ARs mediate lipolysis in human white adipocytes, and suggest that putative 'beta4ARs' mediate inotropic responses to CGP 12177. The results also illustrate the difficulty of predicting from studies on cloned betaARs which betaARs will mediate responses to agonists in tissues that have a high number of beta1- and beta2ARs or a low number of beta3ARs.", 
    "20": "Activation of beta3 adrenergic receptors on the surface of adipocytes leads to increases in intracellular cAMP and stimulation of lipolysis. In brown adipose tissue, this serves to up-regulate and activate the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1, which mediates a proton conductance pathway that uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, leading to a net increase in energy expenditure. While chronic treatment with beta3 agonists in nonprimate species leads to uncoupling protein 1 up-regulation and weight loss, the relevance of this mechanism to energy metabolism in primates, which have much lower levels of brown adipose tissue, has been questioned. With the discovery of L-755,507, a potent and selective partial agonist for both human and rhesus beta3 receptors, we now demonstrate that acute exposure of rhesus monkeys to a beta3 agonist elicits lipolysis and metabolic rate elevation, and that chronic exposure increases uncoupling protein 1 expression in rhesus brown adipose tissue. These data suggest a role for beta3 agonists in the treatment of human obesity.", 
    "21": "G protein alpha subunits consist of two domains, a GTPase domain and a helical domain. Receptors activate G proteins by catalyzing replacement of GDP, which is buried between these two domains, with GTP. Substitution of the homologous alphai2 residues for four alphas residues in switch III, a region that changes conformation upon GTP binding, or of one nearby helical domain residue decreases the ability of alphas to be activated by the beta-adrenergic receptor and by aluminum fluoride. Both sets of mutations increase the affinity of alphas for the beta-adrenergic receptor, based on an increased amount of high affinity binding of the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. The mutations also decrease the rate of receptor-mediated activation and disrupt the ability of the beta-adrenergic receptor to increase the apparent affinity of alphas for the GTP analog, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Simultaneous replacement of the helical domain residue and one of the four switch III residues with the homologous alphai2 residues restores normal receptor-mediated activation, suggesting that the defects caused by mutations at the domain interface are due to altered interdomain interactions. These results suggest that interactions between residues across the domain interface are involved in two key steps of receptor-mediated activation, promotion of GTP binding and subsequent receptor-G protein dissociation.", 
    "22": "The microdialysis method was used to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the beta-adrenergic antagonists carteolol and timolol and the new ophthalmic solution WP-934 in rabbit aqueous humor, following instillation. A probe with a microdialysis membrane (length, 5 mm; diameter, 0.2 mm) was implanted in the anterior chamber of the pigmented rabbit and perfused with Ringer's solution. Twenty microliters of 0.5% timolol maleate (0.5% Timoptol(R)), 2% carteolol hydrochloride (2% Mikelan(R)), or a novel preparation of 0.5% timolol maleate (WP-934) that gels after instillation were then instilled. The concentrations of these drugs in dialysates were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography and an electrochemical detection system. In vitro relative recovery of the membrane with timolol and carteolol was approximately 17.5% and 21. 6%, respectively. Timolol and carteolol levels in aqueous humor increased rapidly after instillation of Timoptol and Mikelan and reached maximal levels (Cmax) within 60 minutes. The Cmax of carteolol (4.25 microg ml-1) was lower than that of timolol (5.52 microg ml-1), suggesting that the corneal permeability of timolol is higher than that of carteolol. After instillation of WP-934, the Cmax of timolol (12.32 microg ml-1) was 2.2-fold higher than that after instillation of Timoptol. However, t1/2 values of beta-adrenergic antagonists after instillation of the three preparations were not significantly different. These data suggest that the microdialysis technique is useful for continuous monitoring of aqueous levels of beta-blockers and for analysis of their pharmacokinetic parameters while requiring much fewer animals than conventional sampling with paracentesis.", 
    "23": "1. The whole-cell patch clamp was employed to study Na+-K+ pump current (Ip) in acutely isolated myocytes. alpha-Adrenergic receptors were activated with noradrenaline (NA) after blocking beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol. Ip was measured as the current blocked by strophanthidin (Str). 2. Activation of alpha-receptors by NA increased Ip in a concentration-dependent manner. The K0.5 depended on intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), however maximal stimulation did not. At 15 nM [Ca2+]i the K0.5 was 219 nM NA whereas at 1.4 microM [Ca2+]i it was 3 nM. 3. The voltage dependence of Ip was not shifted by NA at either high or low [Ca2+]i. At each voltage, maximal stimulation of Ip was 14-15 %. 4. Staurosporine (St), an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), eliminated the alpha-receptor-mediated stimulation of Ip at either high or low[Ca2+]i. 5. The stimulation of Ip was independent of changes in intracellular sodium or external potassium concentrations, and did not reflect a change in affinity for Str. 6. Phenylephrine, methoxamine and metaraminol, three selective alpha1-adrenergic agonists, stimulate Ip in a similar manner to NA. Stimulation of Ip by NA was eliminated by prazosin, an alpha1-antagonist, but was unaffected by yohimbine, an alpha2-antagonist. 7. We conclude noradrenaline activates ventricular alpha1-receptors, which are specifically coupled via PKC to increase Na+-K+ pump current. The sensitivity of the coupling is [Ca2+]i dependent, however the maximal increase in pump current is [Ca2+]i and voltage independent.",

The effect of polysorbate 80 concentration on the permeation of propranolol incorporated into micelles of polysorbate 80 in water, oil-in-water microemulsions of isopropyl myristate-polysorbate 80-sorbitol-water and oil-in-water emulsions of isopropyl myristate-polysorbate 80-sorbitan monooleate-water has been investigated by use of an artificial double-layer membrane, composed of a barrier foil and a lipid barrier, in Franz-type diffusion cells. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, with celiprolol as internal standard, was used to determine the concentration of propranolol in the receptor compartment and a logarithmic equation was used to estimate the apparent permeability coefficient of propranolol from disperse systems. For each disperse system the apparent permeability coefficient of propranolol decreased with increasing polysorbate 80 concentration. Moreover, for a given polysorbate 80 concentration the apparent permeability coefficient of propranolol increased when the disperse system was changed from emulsion to microemulsion and then to solubilized system, because of the increasing interfacial area of total disperse phase. The results show that transdermal permeation of propranolol is greater when it is diffused from solubilized systems rather than from microemulsions or emulsions.",

Microinjection of A II into the MPOA increased plasma LH. This effect was reduced by previous microinjection of an alpha- (phentolamine), but not a beta- (propranolol) adrenergic blocker into the MPOA. Plasma PRL decreased after microinjection of A II into the MPOA, but this effect was unchanged by phentolamine or propranolol. There was no change in plasma FSH in any condition. These results indicate that A II in the MPOA stimulates LH secretion and inhibits PRL secretion in estrogen-primed OVX rats. The effect on secretion of LH, but not of PRL, is mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptors in the MPOA.",

Groups of structurally related compounds, including beta-blockers and 1,4-benzodiazepines, were separated using coupled achiral/chiral stationary phases under subcritical fluid conditions. The achiral selectivity of amino and cyano stationary phases was used to modify the resolution of compounds on a Chiralcel OD chiral stationary phase by combining the achiral and chiral columns in series. In the case of the benzodiazepines, separation of achiral compounds was performed concurrently with the enantioseparation of chiral molecules. The separation of components of a multidrug cough and cold medication was also demonstrated on a cyano column coupled with a Chiralpak AD chiral stationary phase. The use of modified carbon dioxide eluents eliminated the mobile phase incompatibility problems associated with column coupling in liquid chromatography and incorporated the high efficiency of sub- and supercritical fluid chromatography.", 
    "40": "Electromechanical dissociation (EMD) occurred in a 20-year-old woman 48 hours after an overdose of atenolol, despite intensive treatment of the beta-blocker poisoning (gastric lavage, charcoal, glucagon, epinephrine, atropine, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, administration of fluids, cardiac pacing, and mechanical ventilation). Administration of calcium chloride during EMD repeatedly restored blood pressure. Therefore it may have a role to play in management of atenolol overdose.", 
    "41": "The influence of pirlindole and dehydro-pirlindole on GABAA receptor binding and MAO-A activity was investigated in vitro. Inhibition of rat brain and human placenta MAO-A by both compounds was much more potent (with IC50 range 0.3-0.005 microM) than that of GABAA receptors. Pirlindole was inactive as a GABA antagonist. Dehydro-pirlindole exhibited selective blockade of GABA-A receptors with EC50 12 microM. Effects of both compounds on MAO-A activity were partially reversible. Data obtained suggest that in contrast to pirlindole dehydro-pirlindole may act not only as a MAO-A inhibitor but also as a potent GABAA receptor blocker.", 
    "42": "To investigate whether a Ca2+ sensitizer increases sinus rate, we studied the effects of racemic thiadiazinone, EMD 53998 (a Ca2+ sensitizer with phosphodiesterase inhibitory action) and its (+)-enantiomer EMD 57033 (a relatively pure Ca2+ sensitizer) on isolated, blood-perfused spontaneously beating right atria and paced left ventricles of the dogs. EMD 53998 increased sinus rate dose-dependently, but EMD 57033 did not. Both substances increased atrial and ventricular contractile force. Propranolol did not affect the responses to each substance. These results suggest that the Ca2+ sensitizing action induced by EMD 57033 does not affect pacemaker currents directly.", 
    "43": "Effects of azelnidipine, a dihydropyridine derivative, on stunned myocardium were examined in anesthetized open-chest dogs. The left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was ligated for 20 min and then released for 60 min. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the solvent of azelnidipine, or azelnidipine (0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg) was injected i.v. 20 min before ligation. Segment shortening was determined by sonomicrometry. The levels of high-energy phosphate were measured in 60-min reperfused hearts. Azelnidipine at 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg significantly decreased diastolic blood pressure and increased % segment shortening. The increase in % segment shortening due to azelnidipine appeared to be abolished by propranolol and atropine pretreatment. Ischemia significantly decreased % segment shortening in all groups. The % segment shortening that had been decreased by ischemia recovered during reperfusion, but did not reach its preischemic level in each group. In the 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg of azelnidipine-treated dogs, a significant enhancement of % segment shortening recovery during reperfusion was observed, as compared with that in the DMSO-treated dogs. Azelnidipine did not affect the high-energy phosphate levels in 60-min reperfused hearts. In conclusion, azelnidipine improved the contractile dysfunction in stunned myocardium, without any preservation of high-energy phosphate.", 
    "44": "In six patients (4 women aged 80, 62, 43 and 52 years and 2 men aged 58 and 51 years), who used eyedrops containing beta-blockers for the treatment of glaucoma, allergic contact dermatitis of the eyelids was diagnosed. Three were allergic to metipranolol, 2 to levobunolol and 1 to timolol. In literature, less than 50 cases of hypersensitivity to beta-blockers in eye medication have been reported. There are, however, reasons to assume that sensitization is more frequent: (a) not all patients are referred by the ophthalmologist to the dermatologist; (b) false-negative reactions to patch tests with the commercial preparations and with beta-blockers are not infrequent; (c) they are not routinely tested because beta-blockers are difficult to obtain in pure form; (d) cross-reactions with other beta-blockers are infrequent, and changing to another preparation therefore usually solves the clinical problem. Nevertheless it is advisable to test a battery of beta-blockers (befunolol, levobunolol, metipranolol, timolol) in allergic patients. A test preparation of 2% in water or 3%-10% in petrolatum may be suitable. Control testing in non-exposed individuals is necessary to exclude irritation reactions.", 
    "45": "Dilated cardiomyopathy is a common cause of heart failure with systolic dysfunction. Medications used to treat this condition are usually for symptomatic relief. We studied the effect of atenolol in heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy in a double blinded randomized fashion. There were 17 males and 5 females. All patients underwent right and left heart catheterization, coronary angiography, endomyocardial biopsy, exercise testing and doppler echocardiography. By 3 months, atenolol significantly reduced resting and exercise heart rate and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. There was no difference in exercise capacity. We conclude from this study that atenolol improve hemodynamic condition in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy without improving exercise capacity during this short observation period.", 
    "46": "The influence of cell culture conditions and previous drug exposure on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression levels in Caco-2 cells was determined. In this study, the expression of P-gp is demonstrated (i) visually by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), (ii) functionally by transport studies with substrates of the efflux pump, and (iii) quantitatively by flow cytometry (FCM) analysis using specific monoclonal antibodies (anti P-gp MRK 16 as an external antibody and P-GlycoCheck C219 as an internal antibody). Trypsinization of the cells after reaching confluence led to a decrease of P-gp expression levels, while trypsinization before reaching confluence led to an increase after long-term cultivation. Culturing the cells on polycarbonate filters did not elicit a significant change of P-gp expression over time in culture, whereas in plastic flasks (polystyrene) a decrease was detected. Using CLSM a strong fluorescence on the apical side of Caco-2 cell monolayers was observed, as a result of incubation with MRK 16 as primary and IgG Cy5 as secondary antibody. Previous drug exposure of the cells showed that verapamil, celiprolol, and vinblastine induced the P-gp expression, while metkephamid (MKA) decreased the P-gp expression level as compared to the control. Permeation studies consolidated the theory that P-gp is expressed in the Caco-2 cells examined. For talinolol and MKA, a higher transport from basolateral to apical side than from apical to basolateral could be measured. Incubation of the cell monolayer with MRK 16 reduced the secretion process to the apical side, but did not influence [3H]mannitol flux. Caco-2 cells seem to be a suitable cell line model for P-gp-mediated secretion studies. However, the variability of the P-gp expression requires careful control when this model is to be used in quantitative structure/secretion studies.", 
    "47": "Penetration of model beta-blockers, propranolol, oxprenolol, metaprolol, and nadolol, into dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) monolayers cast on a pH 7.4 phosphate buffer (mu = 0.155 adjusted with NaCl) at 25 degreesC was monitored using a film balance equipped with a Wilhelmy plate for measuring changes in surface pressure. Drug solution (pH 7.4) is injected below the surface of the monolayer. The difference in surface pressure, Delta pi, for each drug concentration added to the monolayer was measured at equilibrium. Delta pi increased with increasing drug concentration. Consistent with the relative lipophilicities, the Delta pi vs drug concentration slopes were as follows: propranolol > metaprolol > oxprenolol > nadolol. The intrinsic surface activity of the beta-blockers was also determined in the absence of the lipid. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were also made on DMPC bilayers in the above buffer. DMPC suspended in buffered drug solutions were scanned over a temperature range of 5 degrees to 40 degreesC at a scan rate of 0.091 degreesC/min. The DSC studies indicate that the DMPC thermotropic phase behavior is modulated by these compounds as follows: propranolol > metaprolol congruent with oxprenolol > nadolol which agrees with reported partition coefficients as well as the above Delta pi observations. However, an accounting of the intrinsic surface activity of these compounds results in a lower than expected affinity for the DMPC monolayer.", 
    "48": "Beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents are commonly used for treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris and arrhythmias and as secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. The modest protection against myocardial infarction conferred by these compounds in primary-preventive studies has suggested that beneficial effects of beta-blockade are counteracted by known adverse influences on lipid and glucose metabolism. As most beta-blockers increase plasma triglycerides and decrease the high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration, a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study was conducted to evaluate whether a 12-week treatment with metoprolol (100 mg o.d.) or placebo affected the metabolism of postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in 15 middle-aged men with a modestly increased cardiovascular risk. Metoprolol treatment significantly increased the postprandial responses of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and VLDL remnants to a mixed meal-type of oral fat tolerance test. The effect was particularly prominent for larger (Svedberg flotation rate (Sf) > 400 and Sf 60-400) particle species (P < 0.001 in repeated measures ANOVA), whereas the smaller (Sf 20-60) particles were less affected (P < 0.05). The changes in the postprandial responses of the different VLDL species were mainly related to an effect on the fasting plasma concentrations, with limited or no influences on VLDL catabolism during the postprandial state. In contrast, metoprolol treatment did not significantly influence the postprandial responses of chylomicrons and chylomicron remnants. Notably, the enhanced fasting and postprandial triglyceridaemia during metoprolol treatment was neither accompanied by a rise in fasting or postprandial free fatty acid concentrations, nor by alterations of the glucose and insulin responses to a standard oral glucose challenge. The ensuing shift in the LDL particle size distribution towards smaller particles was limited (fraction small LDL: metoprolol 22.8 +/- 15.7% versus placebo 19.3 +/- 15.0%, P < 0.05). In conclusion, metoprolol treatment primarily enhances fasting and postprandial triglyceridaemia in middle-aged men by increasing the basal hepatic production of VLDL.", 
    "49": "Betaxolol, a long-acting beta-adrenergic blocker that enters the central nervous system, was examined for therapeutic effects on the persistent anxiety of anxiety disorders. Prior studies of beta-blockers examined only agents that were short-acting or did not enter the brain. Betaxolol was administered to 31 patients in open trials. Of 13 outpatients, 11 had generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and 2 had adjustment disorder with anxiety. Five with GAD had concurrent panic disorder. Of 18 inpatients, 16 had GAD and 2 had adjustment disorder with anxiety. Betaxolol doses were increased until the patient responded or declined further dosage. Severity was rated on a 4-point global scale. Before betaxolol, all were moderately or severely ill. In all patients with panic disorder panic attacks stopped within 2 days (p<0.001). Anxiety decreased to no more than marginally ill in 85% of outpatients (p<0.0001) and all inpatients (p<0.0001). Betaxolol doses were usually 5 mg once or twice daily; four inpatients took 10 to 20 mg twice daily. In sum, betaxolol administration was rapidly followed by improvements that were easily noticed by the doctor, even in patients with longstanding anxiety and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Preliminary observations in posttraumatic stress disorder are similar.", 
    "50": "Previous studies have suggested that moderate cooling increases the responsiveness of vascular alpha2-adrenoceptors. However, limited information is available documenting the influence of temperature changes on adrenoceptor responses in the microvasculature of thermoregulatory organs (e.g., the human digit and the rabbit ear) subjected to a wide range of temperatures. In the present study, the effect of local cooling (24 degrees C) on cutaneous microvascular adrenoceptors in the ear was observed in vivo in male New Zealand White rabbits (total: 66 ears). The rabbit ear was studied in a temperature-controlled tissue bath; the ear preparation was pretreated with terazosin (an alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist) (10(-5) M) or a combination of terazosin (10(-5) M) and propranolol (a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) (10(-6) M). The microvascular diameter responses of the ear to norepinephrine (10(-11)-10(-4) M) then were determined at 24 or 34 degrees C, respectively, to determine the influences of low temperature on adrenoceptor responses to norepinephrine stimulation. The results demonstrated that low concentrations of norepinephrine induced vasodilation in arterioles and arteriovenous anastomoses. This vasodilation was followed by vasoconstriction with an increased concentration of norepinephrine in animals with alpha1-adrenergic blockade at 34 degrees C. Moderate tissue cooling increased the microvascular maximal response of the rabbit ear to norepinephrine and abolished the vasodilatation induced by a low concentration of norepinephrine. There was no significant difference in the microvascular response to norepinephrine between the two temperature conditions after simultaneous blockade of alpha1-adrenoceptors and beta-adrenoceptors. Data from the present study indicate that moderate cooling does not enhance the responsiveness of alpha2-adrenoceptors to norepinephrine. In contrast, cooling reduced the beta-adrenergic activity of arterioles and arteriovenous anastomoses after norepinephrine stimulation.",

Recognition and appropriate management of AF is important to optimize care of concurrent medical problems and prevent long-term consequences. DC cardioversion under sedation should be performed in patients with pulmonary edema, angina, or hypotension.

Anticoagulation should be considered in all patients with AF duration < 48 hours, except for those under 65 years old and having no other risk factors of stroke. Recent data imply that early attempts at cardioversion may increase success rates and decrease AF recurrence rates. Thus, transesophageal echocardiogram-guided early cardioversion may become more widely used.",

We have previously shown that IOP is not adversely affected by increased intraperitoneal pressure up to 15 mm Hg in women with no preexisting eye disease. The aim of this study was to measure IOP changes associated with increased intraperitoneal pressure (up to 15 mm Hg) of 2 h duration in 12 rabbits with alpha-chymotrypsin-induced glaucoma. A reliable model of glaucoma was created by injecting alpha-chymotrypsin into the posterior chamber of the right eye in 12 rabbits. Thereafter, 5 of the 12 rabbits with glaucomatous eyes were treated with topical timolol. The left eye was used as a control. During pentobarbital general anesthesia, increased intraperitoneal pressure up to 15 mm Hg was created by intraperitoneal CO2 insufflation. Body temperature and expired CO2 were kept constant throughout the study. IOP measurements were made using an electronic pneumotonometer. IOP, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and central venous pressure were recorded in head-up and head-down positions before, during, and after increased intraperitoneal pressure. The IOP of both eyes, in both treated and untreated rabbits, increased significantly from baseline only when increased intraperitoneal pressure associated with the head-down position resulted in a significant increase in central venous pressure. However, the IOP increase remained within the diurnal range. The major finding of this study is that, in a reliable model of glaucoma, CO2 pneumoperitoneum was associated with an increase in IOP when a head-down position was combined with pneumoperitoneum.",

    "57": "In this study, we aimed to elucidate the effects of intrinsic nitric oxide (NO) on cardiac neural regulation. Twenty-two cats were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane and allocated to Group I (intact; n = 7), Group D (denervated baroreceptors and vagi; n = 8), or Group B (autonomic blockade with i.v. hexamethonium, propranolol, and atropine; n = 7). Cardiac sympathetic nerve activity (CSNA), mean arterial pressure (MAP), sinus heart rate (HR), and A-H and H-V intervals during pacing (150 bpm) were measured before and after i.v. administration of a NO synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 30 mg/kg) and after reversal with an excessive dose of L-arginine (300 mg/kg), before and during intermittent electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus. L-NNA significantly increased MAP in Groups I and B, but not in Group D. L-NNA significantly decreased HR and lengthened A-H in Group I, but not in other groups. L-arginine further decreased HR and lengthened A-H unexpectedly. The reasons for these findings could not be determined in this study. L-NNA did not change CSNA. Hypothalamic stimulation did not potentiate L-NNA-induced changes in CSNA, hemodynamic variables, and atrioventricular conduction. In conclusion, intrinsic NO may modulate atrioventricular conduction and sinus rate through a vagal cholinergic, rather than a nonautonomic mechanism.",

    "63": "Dissolution behavior of two class I drugs, i.e. acetaminophen and metoprolol, and of three class II drugs, i.e. danazol, mefenamic acid and ketoconazole, was studied with USP Apparatus 2 in water, SGF, milk, Simulated Intestinal Fluid without pancreatin (SIFsp) and in two media simulating the small intestinal contents in the fed (FeSSIF) and fasted (FaSSIF) states, respectively.", 
    "64": "Class I powders dissolved rapidly in all media tested. Acetaminophen dissolution in milk was slow from one tablet formulation, in all other cases dissolution was more than 85% complete in 15 minutes. The dissolution rate of metoprolol was shown to be dependent on formulation and manufacturing method, and one of the three tablet formulations did not meet compendial specifications (80%/30 minutes). Dissolution behavior of class II drugs was greatly affected by choice of medium. Dissolution from a capsule formulation of danazol proved to be dependent on the concentration of solubilizing agents, with a the 30-fold increase in percentage dissolved within 90 minutes upon changing from aqueous media without surfactants to FaSSIF. Use of FeSSIF or milk as the dissolution medium resulted in an even greater increase in percentage dissolved, 100 and 180-fold respectively. Dissolution of the weak acid mefenamic acid from a capsule formulation is dependent on both pH and bile salt concentration, which leads to an offset between increased bile salt concentration and lower pH in the fed state compared to the fasted state medium. The weak base ketoconazole showed complete dissolution from a tablet formulation in Simulated Gastric Fluid without pepsin (SGFsp) within 30 minutes, 70% dissolution in 2 hours under fed state simulated upper jejunal conditions but only 6% dissolution in 2 hours under fasted state conditions.",

    "66": "Most ligands which have been employed to investigate the regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors (betaAR) under pathophysiological conditions and in response to pharmacological manipulations have also been shown to have affinity for 5-HT1B receptors. We examined the effects of serotonin and metergoline (10 microM) on 125I-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP, 5-100 pM) binding to betaAR in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus membranes. In both brain regions, the presence of either serotonin or metergoline significantly lowered iodocyanopindolol dissociation constant (Kd) and maximum binding capacity (Bmax). Isoproterenol displacement curves showed that the decrease in receptor density was primarily due to a significant decrease in the receptors in the low-conformational state. Thus, a significant fraction of the apparent ICYP binding to betaAR in the low-conformational state was due to binding to 5-HT1B receptors. Neither serotonin nor metergoline had an effect on the agonist isoproterenol dissociation constant from betaAR in either conformational state.", 
    "67": "Mammalian hibernation, an adaptation to survive harsh winter conditions, is one of the most prominent seasonal rhythmic processes exactly regulated on a low metabolic level. Diurnal variations in vegetative physiology are missing during hibernation; however, a precisely working diurnal system is mandatory for both the proper initiation and termination of the annual hibernation phase and the periodical arousal reactions. Biorhythms and the vegetative physiological processes connected with hibernation are, among others, controlled by hypothalamic noradrenaline systems. In this study, the density, binding capacity, and relative proportions of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors (AR) within the hypothalamus of: 1) motorically inactive summer; 2) motorically active summer; 3) aroused, motorically active winter; and 4) deeply hibernating winter European hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) were studied. For further analysis of the beta-adrenergic signal transduction cascade, the activity of adenylyl cyclase (AC) was measured by formation of cAMP in controls, after stimulation of G proteins, or after forskolin stimulation without or in presence of manganese ions. While beta 1- and beta 2-AR subtypes were nearly equally abundant (50% beta 1:50% beta 2) in active summer, inactive summer, and hibernating hamsters, a significant redistribution in favor of beta 2-AR occurred after arousal (40% beta 1:60% beta 2). The activity of AC was much higher in active summer hamsters than in inactive summer, aroused winter, and hibernating winter hamsters. When AC was stimulated by guanylylimidophosphate [Gpp(NH)p], MnCl2, forskolin, or by forskolin in presence of MnCl2 instead of MgCl2, the potency to stimulate AC was found to show the following rank order: basal < Gpp(NH)p < MnCl2 < or = forskolin + MnCl2 < forskolin.", 
    "68": "Body temperature (Tb) daily rhythms and the effects of alpha and beta blockade were studied in the South African diurnal striped mouse Rhabdomys pumilio. Eleven mice (8 males and 3 females) with a body mass of 42.7+/-7.8 g (mean +/- SD) were tested. Mice were acclimated to a 13 h:11 h light-dark photoperiod at an ambient temperature of 25 degrees C. To assess the daily rhythm of pineal melatonin secretion, urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6-SMT) was determined. Mice displayed a robust Tb daily rhythm with an acrophase in the dark period, which is unexpected for a diurnal species. The nocturnal increase in Tb was accompanied by a significant rise in urinary 6-SMT. The beta blocker propranolol (4.5 mg/kg), injected 1 h before lights-off, resulted in a higher Tb value, whereas the alpha blocker prazosin (1 mg/kg) blocked the increase of Tb during the dark period. Prazosin also significantly attenuated the nocturnal increase of urinary 6-SMT. These results are in agreement with those obtained from the golden spiny mouse Acomys russatus and support the idea that small diurnal mammals retain the Tb rhythm of a nocturnal rodent. They also suggest that pineal melatonin secretion in these rodents is regulated by alpha rather than by beta receptors.", 
    "69": "alpha 1-Adrenergic receptor-mediated responses are overwhelming in adult rat hepatocytes. Inversely, beta-responses are predominant over alpha 1-responses in the hepatocytes that have been cultured at a low cell density (10(4) cells/cm2) for 24 h. The insulin-EGF-induced DNA synthesis in the beta-response-dominant hepatocytes was doubled by beta-agonists or cAMP-generating agents added far behind (16-20 h) the addition of insulin/EGF; i.e., immediately before the entry into the S-phase of the cell cycle. Agonists of alpha 1-adrenergic or other Ca2+, mobilising receptors added to the alpha 1-response-dominant hepatocytes increased DNA synthesis only if they were added within 1-2 h after the addition of insulin/EGF, at the early stage of G1-phase. Agonists of \"non-dominant\" receptors were rather antagonistic to agonists of \"dominant\" receptors. Thus, agonists of alpha 1-adrenergic (and other Ca2+ mobilising) receptors and agonists of beta-adrenergic (and other cAMP-generating) receptors acted as comitogens in their own particular manners in the presence of growth factors in hepatocytes in which the respective receptor functions were dominant.", 
    "70": "Alveolar macrophages are the most common cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The macrophages participate in the inflammatory response and defence of the airways by secretion of mediators and by phagocytizing foreign particles such as bacteria and viruses. beta-Agonists and glucocorticosteroids are the most frequently used drugs in asthma. Alveolar macrophages have beta 2-adrenoceptors on their surface but the functional role of these receptors is unknown. Glucocorticosteroids interact with mediator release from macrophages. However, nothing is known about the effects of those drugs on the phagocytic capacity of alveolar macrophages. Therefore, the present study has investigated phagocytosis of alveolar macrophages from nine healthy volunteers after incubation with a beta 2-agonist, terbutaline (10(-8), 10(-6) and 10(-4) M) and a glucocorticosteroid, budesonide (10(-9), 10(-7) and 10(-5) M). Alveolar macrophages were incubated with FITC-labelled Escherichia coli, and the drugs and phagocytosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Phagocytosis was measured as the proportion of phagocytizing cells and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). MFI was highly correlated with phagocytized E. coli per cell assessed by fluorescence microscopy (r = 0.996). The proportion of phagocytizing macrophages (control) was [median (25th-75th) percentiles] 46% (40-63) and 29% (18-60), and MFI were 174 (154-205) and 122 (90-271) in the terbutaline and budesonide experiments, respectively. Terbutaline did not affect the phagocytosis significantly, while budesonide decreased the phagocytic capacity (percent phagocytizing cells and MFI) in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.01). At the highest budesonide concentration (10(-5) M), phagocytosis was approximately half of the control situation. In conclusion, this in vitro study indicate that a glucocorticosteroid decreases phagocytosis in alveolar macrophages in a concentration that may be relevant in the airway lining fluid. Further investigations regarding the effect on other micro-organisms and in vivo effects are necessary to further elucidate these findings.",

Metoprolol was associated with a 30% reduction in all cause mortality (7% to 48%, p = 0.015) and a 26% reduction in mortality or transplantation (7% to 41%, p = 0.009).",

    "75": "Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal motility disturbances in women compared with men. This may partly be due to the effects of sex hormones on smooth muscle cells. To further characterize the mechanisms by which sex hormones affect intestinal smooth muscle, we studied the effects of several structurally related progestins on intestinal contractility. Segments of the murine intestine oriented along the longitudinal axis were connected to force displacement transducers. We recorded the isometric tension generated by the murine jejunum spontaneously and after cholinergic stimulation. The baseline tension, amplitude of spontaneous contractions, and increase in tension after cholinergic stimulation were measured in the presence and absence of various steroid hormones. Progesterone dose dependently decreased the contractile activity of the murine jejunum. This effect occurred within less than 1 min and could not be inhibited by a specific blocker of the progesterone receptor, suggesting a nongenomic pathway. Experiments with several progestins demonstrated a stereoselectivity of this steroid hormone effect. This was most pronounced for dihydroprogesterone: the 5 alpha form did not affect intestinal contractility, while the stereoisomer 5 beta-dihydroprogesterone significantly inhibited smooth muscle tension. We conclude that progesterone significantly inhibits the contractility of the murine jejunum in vitro. The differential effects of various structural analogues argue against a nonspecific effect of the steroid hormones on the lipid bilayer with secondary functional alterations of membrane proteins. Rather, they suggest a specific interaction between the steroid hormone and a still unidentified protein that differs in its function and pharmacological profile from the known progesterone receptor.",

The maximal PIE of Ang II was about 30% of the isoproterenol-induced maximum (ISOmax), while the maximal increase in the peak Ca2+ transient induced by Ang II was only 7% of ISOmax. Ang II tended to prolong the duration of contraction (both time to peak force and relaxation time) but did not produce a discernible change in the duration of Ca2+ transient. The relationship between the amplitude of Ca2+ transient and peak force was shifted to the left by Ang II, as compared with the relationship for elevation of [Ca2+]o (2.5-15.0 mM). The PIE and the increase in the amplitude of Ca2+ transient induced by Ang II were abolished by a selective angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist losartan (10(-5) M) but were not affected by a selective AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 (10(-6) M).",

    "80": "Transmembrane voltage-gated Ca2+ channels play a central role in the development and control of heart contractility which is modulated by the concentration of free cytosolic calcium ions (Ca2+). Ca2+ channels are closed at the normal membrane resting potential of cardiac cells. During the fast upstroke of the action potential (AP), they are gated into an open state by membrane depolarisation and thereby transduce the electrical signal into a chemical signal. In addition to its contribution to the AP plateau, Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels induces a release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) which initiates contraction. Because of their central role in excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling, L-type Ca2+ channels are a key target to regulate inotropy [1]. The role of T-type Ca2+ channels is more obscure. In addition to a putative part in the rhythmic activity of the heart, they may be implicated at early stages of development and during pathology of contractile tissues [2]. Despite therapeutic advances improving exercise tolerance and survival, congestive heart failure (HF) remains a major problem in cardiovascular medicine. It is a highly lethal disease; half of the mortality being related to ventricular failure whereas sudden death of the other patients is unexpected [3]. Although HF has diverse aetiologies, common abnormalities include hypertrophy, contractile dysfunction and alteration of electrophysiological properties contributing to low cardiac output and sudden death. A significant prolongation of the AP duration with delayed repolarisation has been observed both during compensated hypertrophy (CH) and in end-stage HF caused by dilated cardiomyopathy (Fig. 1A) [4-8]. This lengthening can result from either an increase in inward currents or a decrease in outward currents or both. A reduction of K+ currents has been demonstrated [6,9]. Prolonged Na+/Ca2+ exchange current may also be involved [9]. In contrast, there is a large variability in the results concerning Ca2+ currents (ICa). The purpose of this paper is to review results obtained in various animal models of CH and HF with special emphasis on recent studies in human cells. We focus on: (i) the pathophysiological role of T-type Ca2+ channels, present in some animal models of hypertrophy; (ii) the density and properties of L-type Ca2+ channels and alteration of major physiological regulations of these channels by heart rate and beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation; and (iii) recent advances in the molecular biology of the L-type Ca2+ channel and future directions.", 
    "81": "The neuropeptide galanin is widely distributed in the gastrointestinal tract and exerts several inhibitory effects, especially on intestinal motility and on insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells. The presence of galanin fibres not only in the myenteric and submucosal plexus but also in the mucosa, prompted us to investigate the regulatory role of galanin, and its mechanism of action, on the secretion of the insulinotropic hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Rat ileal cells were dispersed through mechanical vibration followed by moderate exposure to hyaluronidase, DNase I and EDTA, and enriched for L-cells by counterflow elutriation. A 6- to 7-fold enrichment in GLP-1 cell content was registered after elutriation, as compared with the crude cell preparation (929 +/- 81 vs 138 +/- 14 fmol/10(6) cells). L-cells then accounted for 4-5% of the total cell population. Bombesin induced a time-(15-240 min) and dose- (0.1 nM-1 microM) dependent release of GLP-1. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP, 100 nM), forskolin (10 microM) and the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 1 microM) each stimulated GLP-1 secretion over a 1-h incubation period. Galanin (0.01-100 nM) induced a dose-dependent inhibition of bombesin- and of GIP-stimulated GLP-1 release (mean inhibition of 90% with 100 nM galanin). Galanin also dose-dependently inhibited forskolin-induced GLP-1 secretion (74% of inhibition with 100 nM galanin), but not TPA-stimulated hormone release. Pretreatment of cells with 200 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 3 h, or incubation with the ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker disopyramide (200 microM), prevented the inhibition by galanin of bombesin- and GIP-stimulated GLP-1 secretion. These studies indicate that intestinal secretion of GLP-1 is negatively controlled by galanin, that acts through receptors coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and involves ATP-dependent K+ channels.", 
    "82": "Because the availability of transgenic mice makes it possible to examine the contribution of single genes to in vivo function, we developed a simple in situ mouse model that can be used to quantify isosmolar alveolar epithelial fluid clearance (AFC). Mice were killed, a tracheostomy was done, and then a test solution of a 5% isosmolar albumin solution with 0.1 micro Ci of 125I-labeled albumin was instilled via the trachea into the distal air spaces of both lungs. After instillation, the lungs were inflated to 7 cmH2O with 100% O2 and maintained at 37 degrees C by placing the animals under an infrared lamp. AFC was measured by the progressive increase in concentration of labeled and unlabeled protein over 1 h. The results indicated the following. 1) Basal, unstimulated AFC in mouse lungs was significantly faster than in ex vivo rat lungs (27 +/- 5% in in situ mice vs. 11 +/- 3% in ex vivo rat lungs; P < 0.05). 2) Comparison of equivalent doses (10(-4) M) of beta-adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol) and beta2-adrenergic agonists (terbutaline and salmeterol) indicated that stimulated clearance occurred only in presence of isoproterenol. 3) Because atenolol, a specific beta1-antagonist, abolished the effect of isoproterenol, the beta-adrenergic stimulation appears to be mediated by beta1-receptors. The rate of AFC in nonperfused mouse lungs was significantly faster than in prior studies of nonperfused lungs in rats and sheep. Interestingly, the stimulated clearance rate in mice was similar to the fast rates of AFC that we recently reported in patients recovering from hydrostatic pulmonary edema. This in situ model is a unique experimental preparation that can be readily used to quantify isosmolar epithelial fluid clearance in mice.", 
    "83": "beta-Adrenergic agonists are important regulators of perinatal pulmonary circulation. They cause vasodilation primarily via the adenyl cyclase-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) pathway. We examined the responses of isolated fourth-generation pulmonary veins of term fetal (145 +/- 2 days gestation) and newborn (10 +/- 1 days) lambs to isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist. In vessels preconstricted with U-46619 (a thromboxane A2 analog), isoproterenol induced greater relaxation in pulmonary veins of newborn lambs than in those of fetal lambs. The relaxation was eliminated by propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist. Forskolin, an activator of adenyl cyclase, also caused greater relaxation of veins of newborn than those of fetal lambs. 8-Bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, a cell membrane-permeable analog of cAMP, induced a similar relaxation of all vessels. Biochemical studies show that isoproterenol and forskolin induced a greater increase in cAMP content and in adenyl cyclase activity of pulmonary veins in the newborn than in the fetal lamb. These results demonstrate that beta-adrenergic-agonist-mediated relaxation of pulmonary veins increases with maturation. An increase in the activity of adenyl cyclase may contribute to the change.",

    "91": "The beta2-adrenoreceptor (beta2AR) couples to the G-protein Gs to mediate adenylyl cyclase activation. The splice variants of Gs alpha differ by a 15-amino acid insert between the Ras-like domain and the alpha-helical domain. The long splice variant of Gs alpha (Gs alphaL) binds GDP with lower affinity than the short splice variant (Gs alphaS), but the impact of this difference on the interaction of Gs alpha with the beta 2AR is not known. We studied the beta2 AR/Gs alpha interaction using receptor/G-protein fusion proteins (beta2 AR Gs alphaS and beta2 AR Gs alphaL) expressed in Sf9 cells. Fusion of the beta2 AR to Gs alpha promotes efficient coupling as shown by high-affinity agonist binding and GTPase and adenylyl cyclase activation and ensures fixed stoichiometry between receptor and G-protein. Importantly, fusion does not change the fundamental properties of the beta2 AR or Gs alpha. The beta2 AR in beta2 AR Gs alphaL showed hallmarks of constitutive activity (increased potency and intrinsic activity of partial agonists, increased efficacy of inverse agonists, and increased basal GTPase activity) compared with the beta2 AR in beta2 AR Gs alphaS. The apparent constitutive activity of the beta2 AR in beta2 AR Gs alphaL may be due to the lower GDP affinity of Gs alphaL compared with Gs alphaS, i.e. Gs alphaL is more often nucleotide-free than Gs alphaS and, therefore, more frequently available to stabilize the beta2 AR in the active (R*) state. This study demonstrates that subtle structural differences between closely related G-protein alpha-subunits can have important consequences for the functional properties of a G-protein-coupled receptor.",

The present study uses intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) NE to mimic in vitro bath conditions in vivo. Short-term NE potentiation was reliably seen with 10 microg [+/-] NE in 2 microl of 0.9% saline i.c.v. Long-term potentiation occurred with higher doses of NE. The beta-agonist isoproterenol and the alpha-agonist phenylephrine also produced potentiation. Long-term effects were common with isoproterenol. The beta-antagonist metoprolol and the alpha-antagonist phentolamine attenuated NE potentiation. The results suggest that both alpha- and beta-receptors could play a role in NE potentiation in dentate gyrus in vivo. In awake animals, 10 microg NE i.c.v. reproduced the potentiation pattern seen in anesthetized rats. NE potentiation in awake rats was independent of behavioral variation.", 
    "97": "The initiation of insulin release from rat islet beta cells relies, in large part, on calcium influx through dihydropyridine-sensitive (alpha1D) voltage-gated calcium channels. Components of calcium-dependent insulin secretion and whole cell calcium current, however, are resistant to L-type channel blockade, as well as to omega-conotoxin GVIA, a potent inhibitor of alpha1B channels, suggesting the expression of additional exocytotic calcium channels in the islet. We used a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-based strategy to ascertain at the molecular level whether the alpha1A calcium channel isoform was also present. Results revealed two new variants of the rat brain alpha1A channel in the islet with divergence in a putative extracellular domain and in the carboxyl terminus. Using antibodies and cRNA probes specific for alpha1A channels, we found that the majority of cells in rat pancreatic islets were labeled, indicating expression of the alpha1A channels in beta cells, the predominant islet cell type. Electrophysiologic recording from isolated islet cells demonstrated that the dihydropyridine-resistant current was sensitive to the alpha1A channel blocker, omega-agatoxin IVA. This toxin also inhibited the dihydropyridine-resistant component of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting functional overlap among calcium channel classes. These findings confirm the presence of multiple high voltage-activated calcium channels in the rat islet and implicate a physiologic role for alpha1A channels in excitation-secretion coupling in beta cells.", 
    "98": "To construct a homogeneous lipid membrane chromatographic phase, biotinylated unilamellar liposomes of small and large sizes (SUVs and LUVs, respectively) were immobilized in avidin- or streptavidin-derived gel beads in amounts up to 55 micromol phospholipid/ml gel bed at yields above 50%. The immobilized liposomes exhibited excellent stability due to avidin-biotin multiple-site binding. The trapped volume and size distribution of the immobilized liposomes (0.33-0.42 microl/micromol lipid and 20-30 nm diameter for SUVs, 1.7-1.9 microl/micromol lipid and 80-120 nm for LUVs) indicated the unilamellarity and integrity of the immobilized liposomes. Partitioning of 15 pharmaceutical drugs into the bilayers of LUVs immobilized in different gel matrices correlated very well, as shown by chromatographic drug retention analysis. The partitioning of several beta-blockers into the immobilized LUVs showed a close correlation with their partitioning, reported in the literature, into free liposomes. The avidin-biotin-immobilized unilamellar liposomes can thus be used for chromatographic analysis and screening of solute-membrane interactions.",

    "104": "1. The effect of activation of nicotinic cholinoceptors in rat duodenal segments following electrical field stimulation (EFS) was investigated. 2. Electrical field stimulation elicited a two-component response: transient relaxation followed by contraction. The EFS-evoked response was tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 mumol/L) sensitive. The relaxation component was NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; 100 mumol/L) sensitive, while the contractile response was atropine (1 mumol/L) sensitive. 3. 1,1-Dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazinium iodide (DMPP; 20 mumol/L) induced relaxation of spontaneously active preparations that was L-NNA sensitive. L-Arginine (1 mmol/L) reversed the effects of L-NNA on DMPP-induced relaxation. 4. When EFS was applied, DMPP increased the amplitude of the relaxation component of the response and reduced the contractile component. 5. In the presence of L-NNA, the effect of DMPP on the relaxation component of the response to EFS was reduced, but the contractile response was not affected. L-Arginine partly reduced this effect of L-NNA. 6. Neither propranolol (1 mumol/L) nor yohimbine (1 mumol/L) had any effect on the actions of DMPP on EFS-evoked responses, but prazosin (1 mumol/L) strongly reduced the effect of DMPP on the contractile component of the response to EFS and slightly reduced the effect of DMPP on the relaxation response. 7. Histochemical studies demonstrated that, in the myenteric plexus of the rat duodenum, there are many reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d)-positive neurons and that their number decreased after treatment with L-NNA. In the presence of L-arginine and L-NNA, the number of NADPH-d-positive neurons was similar to that found in control samples. 8. The data suggest that activation of nicotinic cholinoceptors modulates EFS-evoked responses in the rat duodenum as a result of the potentiation of nitrergic and adrenergic neurotransmission.", 
    "105": "1. The present study was performed to test whether beat-to-beat cardiovascular control in cardiac allograft recipients resides in cholinergic and/or adrenergic nerves that are intrinsic to the heart. 2. Heart rate (HR) fluctuations synchronous with respiration during spontaneous, double tidal volume and metronome-synchronized breathing were quantified in 13 human heart transplant recipients. We also examined the effects of sequential cholinergic and beta-adrenoceptor (combined) autonomic blockade on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). We computed RSA amplitude and the correlation between respiration and changes in HR (cardiopulmonary synchronization; CPS). Group means were compared using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Transplant recipients served as their own controls. 3. In the basal state, moderate RSA amplitude and CPS were observed. During cholinergic and combined blockade, we observed no significant change in RSA amplitude, whereas CPS increased significantly during combined blockade (P < 0.05). The amplitude of RSA increased during respiration at double baseline tidal volume, but not at any of the other breathing manoeuvres (P < 0.01). In contrast, CPS increased significantly during both patterned breathing manoeuvres. No significant correlation was seen between mean right atrial pressure and RSA amplitude. In 23% of subjects with low CPS, HR oscillated with arterial pressure. These oscillations were independent of respiration. During all three patterns of respiration, a significant inverse correlation was observed between CPS and pulse pressure (r = -0.53 to -0.73). Thus, as the amplitude of pulse pressure increased, respiration accounted for a smaller percentage of HR variation. 4. In conclusion, RSA persists and the magnitude of CPS increases following combined autonomic blockade. These studies suggest that while RSA after cardiac transplantation is not cholinergically or adrenergically mediated, it may be related to mechanical stretch of the sinus node caused by changes in intrathoracic pressure and perfusion pressure.", 
    "106": "Our laboratory has previously reported that the antimitogenic effect of nitric oxide (NO) in primary cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle cells may be attributed to activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase and dephosphorylation of protein phosphotyrosine [G.S. Dhaunsi, C. Matthews, K. Kaur, and A. Hassid, Am, J. Physiol. 272 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 41): H1342-H1349, 1997]. The goal of the current study was to investigate the role of cytoplasmic Ca in this process and to identify protein substrates that are dephosphorylated by treatment with NO. Treatment of primary rat aortic smooth muscle cell cultures with the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) decreased cytoplasmic Ca levels and elicited phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation. Both effects were mimicked by the extracellular and intracellular Ca chelators ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), respectively, and by the Ca channel blocker nifedipine. Conversely, elevation of cytoplasmic Ca via the use of the Ca ionophore A-23187 or high extracellular K+ prevented or attenuated SNAP-induced dephosphorylation. Both BAPTA and nifedipine also decreased DNA synthesis, providing further evidence to link dephosphorylation to antimitogenesis. Two of the proteins dephosphorylated by treatment of cells with NO or EGTA were identified as the focal adhesion proteins, cortactin and paxillin. These results indicate that NO-induced dephosphorylation of protein phosphotyrosine is mediated by reduction of cytoplasmic Ca and suggest that dephosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins may be of relevance to the antimitogenic effect of NO.", 
    "107": "beta-Adrenergic agonists have been reported to increase lung liquid clearance by stimulating active Na+ transport across the alveolar epithelium. We studied mechanisms by which beta-adrenergic isoproterenol (Iso) increases lung liquid clearance in isolated perfused fluid-filled rat lungs. Iso perfused through the pulmonary circulation at concentrations of 10(-4) to 10(-8) M increased lung liquid clearance compared with that of control lungs (P < 0.01). The increase in lung liquid clearance was inhibited by the beta-antagonist propranolol (10(-5) M), the Na(+)-channel blocker amiloride (10(-4) M), and the antagonist of Na-K-ATPase, ouabain (5 x 10(-4) M). Colchicine, which inhibits cell microtubular transport of ion-transporting proteins to the plasma membrane, blocked the stimulatory effects of Iso on active Na+ transport, whereas the isomer lumicolchicine, which does not affect cell microtubular transport, did not inhibit Na+ transport. In parallel with these changes, the Na-K-ATPase alpha 1-subunit protein abundance and activity increased in alveolar type II cells stimulated by 10(-6) M Iso. Colchicine blocked the stimulatory effect of Iso and the recruitment of Na-K-ATPase alpha 1-protein to the basolateral membrane of alveolar type II cells. Accordingly, Iso increased active Na+ transport and lung liquid clearance by stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors and probably by upregulation of apical Na+ channels and basolateral Na-K-ATPase mechanisms. Recruitment from intracellular pools and microtubular transport of Na+ pumps to the plasma membrane participate in beta-adrenergic stimulation of lung liquid clearance in rat lungs.",

Watson. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 45: 965-973, 1997). In the present study, we examined the cellular redistribution of Rap1 following treatment of acini with isoproterenol (ISO), the beta-adrenergic agonist, and determined the relationship between translocation and amylase release. In the presence of ISO, Rap1 translocated to the cytosol in a concentration- and time-dependent manner; this effect was not mimicked by the muscarinic agonist, carbachol. Translocation was maximal at 1 microM ISO and paralleled amylase release immediately after ISO stimulation. Rap1 translocation and amylase release were blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, whereas okadaic acid, a downstream secretory inhibitor, significantly blocked amylase release but did not inhibit Rap1 redistribution. Results suggest that the translocation of Rap1 is causally related to secretion and that the role of Rap1 in secretion is at a site proximal to the exocytotic event.", 
    "110": "The purpose of the present study was to determine whether cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) acts as a second messenger for Ca2+ release through ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels in tracheal smooth muscle (TSM). Freshly dissociated porcine TSM cells were permeabilized with beta-escin, and real-time confocal microscopy was used to examine changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). cADPR (10 nM-10 microM) induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i, which was blocked by the cADPR receptor antagonist 8-amino-cADPR (20 microM) and by the RyR blockers ruthenium red (10 microM) and ryanodine (10 microM), but not by the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor blocker heparin (0.5 mg/ml). During steady-state [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by acetylcholine (ACh), addition of 100 nM and 1 microM cADPR increased oscillation frequency and decreased peak-to-trough amplitude. ACh-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations were blocked by 8-amino-cADPR; however, 8-amino-cADPR did not block the [Ca2+]i response to a subsequent exposure to caffeine. These results indicate that cADPR acts as a second messenger for Ca2+ release through RyR channels in TSM cells and may be necessary for initiating ACh-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations.", 
    "111": "In Experiment 1 six dose levels (range 0.66-2000 microg) of progesterone (P) and two synthetic progestins with a double bond at C6: megestrol acetate (MA) and chlormadinone acetate (CA), which cannot be reduced at C5, were injected to estrogen-primed (2 microg estradiol benzoate 42 h earlier) ovariectomized (ovx) rats. The three progestins elicited significant lordosis and proceptive behaviors. Potency analysis showed that MA was the most potent progestin for stimulating estrous behavior, followed by P and CA. These results suggest that ring A reduction of progestins to 5alpha/5beta metabolites is not essential for the facilitation of estrous behavior in ovx estrogen-primed rats. Progestins with the 3-ketone group and a double bond at C4 can also be reduced at C3 to yield 3alpha-hydroxysteroid metabolites potentially capable of stimulating estrous behavior. In Experiment 2, the relevance of the formation of 3alpha-hydroxysteroid metabolites for estrous behavior facilitation was tested by concurrently injecting indomethacin (1.5 mg), a blocker of 3alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase, with 400 microg of P, MA, or CA to ovx estrogen-primed rats. Indomethacin failed to block the stimulatory effect of these progestins on estrous behavior. These results suggest that 3-ketosteroid reduction is also not essential for estrous behavior facilitation by progestins.", 
    "112": "The levels of insulin, free fatty acids (FFA), and triglycerides in rat sera increase with age. The increase in serum FFA levels accompanied the stimulation of basal lipolysis (i.e., lipolysis in the absence of lipolytic agents) in fat cells and enlargement of the diameter of the cells. An overnight fast resulted in a significant increase in basal lipolysis in fat cells from 6- and 8-week-old rats. Although insulin inhibited lipolysis induced by norepinephrine and ACTH at a concentration of 10(-10) M, it failed to inhibit basal lipolysis even at a concentration of 10(-6) M. Propranolol, another antilipolytic agent like insulin, also did not affect basal lipolysis. Insulin did not inhibit the accelerated basal lipolysis in enlarged fat cells, fasted fat cells, and sonicated cells. These results indicate that insulin inhibits only the lipolysis induced by lipolytic agents such as norepinephrine and ACTH but not the basal lipolysis found in the absence of lipolytic agents. The possibility that free fatty acids produced by enlarged fat cells initiate insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, is discussed.", 
    "113": "Experimental data are provided which substantiate the concept on reciprocal changes in immune reactivity and stress sensitivity as a basis for selection of adaptation strategy under unfavorable conditions. The data obtained suggest that transition from the resistant (stress) strategy of adaptation to hypobiosis is a prerequisite for maintenance of the immune reactivity under extreme conditions. Stimulation of the immune system per se may provide for transition from stress to the tolerant (hypobiotic) strategy of adaptation.", 
    "114": "Signaling through protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) is a major contributor to the transmission of mitogenic stimuli to the interior of the cell and nucleus. The present study was designed to determine the effect of the tyrphostin AG1295, a selective blocker of PDGF-receptor PTK, on the growth of porcine and human smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in culture, on the outgrowth kinetics of SMCs from porcine and human arterial explants, and on neointimal formation after balloon injury in pigs.", 
    "115": "SMCs for culture were obtained from porcine abdominal aortas, human internal mammary arteries, and endarterectomy tissue from a single human carotid artery. Addition of AG1295 to SMCs before PDGF stimulation completely inhibited PDGF-beta-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation without affecting the level of PDGF-beta-receptor. AG1295 resulted in a selective, reversible inhibition of SMC proliferation in culture (76%) with only mild (13.5%) inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation. The number of SMCs accumulating around explants of porcine carotid arteries and human endarterectomy specimens 12, 15, 19, 22, and 24 days after plating was reduced by 82% to 92% in AG1295-treated compared with nontreated specimens, and initiation of SMC outgrowth was markedly delayed. The numbers of cells accumulated 10 days after initiation of outgrowth were significantly lower in treated versus control explants. Local intravascular delivery of AG1295-impregnated polylactic acid-based nanoparticles (130+/-25 nm) to the site of balloon injury to porcine femoral arteries resulted in significant reductions in intima/media area ratio and luminal cross-sectional area narrowing by neointima compared with contralateral control arteries to which empty nanoparticles were applied (0.15+/-0.07 versus 0.09+/-0.03, P=.046 and 20+/-4% versus 10+/-4%, P=.0009, n=6 for both).", 
    "116": "The tyrphostin AG1295, a selective blocker of PDGF-receptor kinase, exerts a marked inhibitory effect on the activation, migration, and proliferation of porcine and human SMCs in vitro and an approximately 50% inhibitory effect on neointimal formation after balloon injury in porcine femoral arteries when delivered via biodegradable nanoparticles. Further studies appear to be warranted to evaluate the applicability of this novel approach to the interventional setting.", 
    "117": "A combined method of immunoaffinity extraction with high-performance liquid chromatography has been developed for the enantioselective determination of bufuralol and its metabolites in human plasma. The antibodies having high affinity toward the asymmetric center at the C-1 position of bufuralol and its 1'-oxidized metabolites and low affinity to their antipodes were elicited by immunization of rabbits with immunogens, (1R)- and (1S)-1'-oxobufuralol O-carboxymethyloxime-bovine serum albumin conjugates, respectively. 0.5 ml Of the immunoaffinity adsorbent (7.6 mg.ml-1 for anti-(1S)-antibody and 28.8 mg.ml-1 for anti-(1R)-antibody) prepared by immobilization of an antibody was capable of retaining up to 1 microgram of (R)- and (S)-bufuralol and up to 500 ng of other metabolites. The adsorbates were recovered quantitatively by elution with methanol-10 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5) (95:5, v/v) without any interfering peaks on the high-performance liquid chromatogram. The proposed method was evaluated to be useful for the simultaneous determination of optically active bufuralol and its metabolite in plasma with acceptable recovery and precision.", 
    "118": "Chitosan microspheres were prepared using an emulsification-coacervation technique. The w/o emulsion comprised a mixture of light and heavy liquid paraffins containing sodium dioctyl sulphosuccinate as the oil phase and chitosan solution as the aqueous phase. Pentasodium tripolyphosphate was included as a counterion. The chitosan microspheres obtained showed a high degree of aggregation. This was markedly reduced, by the incorporation of magnesium stearate in the disperse phase. The resultant microspheres were then discrete, spherical with smooth surfaces. Additionally, with an increasing magnesium stearate content, larger-sized microspheres were produced. The DSC analysis data suggested that the magnesium stearate was converted to stearic acid during the preparation process. Chitosan microspheres containing propranolol hydrochloride were similarly prepared, but their surface was convoluted and their shape not well defined. Unlike the microspheres without drug, the size of the drug-loaded microspheres decreased with increasing magnesium stearate content. The release of propranolol hydrochloride from the microspheres was fast, irrespective of the content of magnesium stearate. Drug encapsulation efficiency was enhanced when a greater amount of magnesium stearate was used.", 
    "119": "The use of heart rate in clinical practice is limited by its variability under measurement situations. The mean heart rate on ambulatory monitoring provides a more robust statistic for clinical use. We examined the relationship between mean heart rate on initial referral ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to the BP-lowering efficacy of the four main groups of anti-hypertensive medications, in a referral hypertensive population. Patients were retrospectively identified by review of the BP database, and data collected from the initial referral BP monitor off medication, and the subsequent ABPM after treatment with either beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The change in mean arterial BP from the initial to the subsequent ABPM (ie, as a result of treatment) was correlated with the mean heart rate on the initial ABPM. A moderate association was found for initial daytime heart rate and BP response to beta-blockers (r = 0.24, P = 0.02), and ACE inhibitors (r = 0.14, P = 0.05). No such association was found for calcium antagonists or diuretics. When the groups were divided into those with a mean daytime heart rate <75 and > or =75 beats per min, BP reduction from beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy was significantly greater in those patients with a higher daytime heart rate. We conclude that average daytime heart rate on pre-treatment ABPM can be useful as a predictor of BP response to beta-blockade or ACE inhibition.", 
    "120": "Clinical treatment with a combination of Class IA and III antiarrhythmic drugs is not recommended, as they both favor bradycardia-dependent proarrhythmic events such as torsades de pointes (TdP). However, this theoretical additive effect on ventricular repolarization has never been demonstrated and could be questioned as other Class I drugs, such as mexiletine, a Class IB drug, limit the number of sotalol-induced TdP in dogs with AV block, suggesting the possibility of an antagonistic action of Class I properties against Class III effects.", 
    "121": "We compared the electrophysiologic and proarrhythmic effects of sotalol (Class III) alone and combined with quinidine (Class IA) in a canine model of acquired long QT syndrome. Seven hypokalemic (K+: 3 +/- 0.1 mEq/L) dogs with chronic AV block had a demand pacemaker implanted and set at a rate of 25 beats/min. They were submitted to two (sotalol-alone and sotalol-plus-quinidine) experiments 48 hours apart using a randomized cross-over protocol. They were pretreated with quinidine (10 mg/kg + 1.8 mg/kg per hour) or saline infused throughout the experiment, and given sotalol (4.5 mg/kg + 1.5 mg/kg per hour) for 2 hours, 30 minutes after the beginning of the pretreatment infusion during both experiments. Ventricular and atrial cycle lengths were similarly increased by sotalol after quinidine or saline. The sotalol-induced prolongation of the QT interval was significantly shorter in quinidine-pretreated dogs (24 +/- 7 msec after quinidine vs 40 +/- 8 msec after saline). Fewer dogs developed TdP: significantly during the first hour of infusion (1/7 sotalol-plus-quinidine vs 6/7 sotalol-alone dogs, P < 0.05) but nonsignificantly during the second hour (3/7 vs 6/7).",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether ECE-1 mRNA expression is modified in human cardiovascular disease. Tissue samples from the left human atrium were analyzed for ECE-1 expression and related to different clinical parameters. A quantitative PCR assay (qPCR) with competitive and non-competitive standards was established. The ECE-1 measurements were normalized by a GAPDH qPCR. Patients who suffered from a myocardial infarction had elevated ECE-1 levels when compared to controls (5.81+/-0.76 vs. 3.20+/-0.51 fg ECE-1, ng GAPDH, p<0.05). Drug treatment with the beta-blocker metoprolol was associated with a decreased ECE-1 expression level (3.90+/-0.58 vs. 5.81+/-0.76 fg ECE-1, ng GAPDH, p<0.1). We conclude that the expression of ECE-1 is altered in the atrial tissue depending on the physiological status of the heart. This suggests a differential role of ECE-1 in cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "124": "Human insulin receptor (hINR) number and its response to medical treatment was evaluated in 14 male controls and 40 male hypertensive patients. Twenty patients treated with fosinopril (10 to 20 mg daily orally) comprised Group A and 20 treated with atenolol (25 to 50 mg daily orally) Group B. The hINR number (receptors x 10(3)/red cell) was greater in controls compared to untreated patients (8.22+/-2.4 v 5.53+/-1.27, P < .001). After 6 months of treatment the hINR number increased in Group A (5.73+/-1.47 v 7.5+/-2.06, P < .001) and remained unchanged (5.35+/-1.09 v 5.5+/-1.31, P = NS) in Group B. Thus, hINR number is decreased in hypertension and, in contrast to atenolol, fosinopril treatment is associated with an increase in hINR number, suggesting a favorable effect on glucose metabolism.", 
    "125": "Pharmacotherapy with nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium antagonists is the cornerstone of management of patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. While these agents are all effective, their use may be limited by pharmacologic tolerance, side effects, and drug interactions. Mibefradil is a recently developed calcium antagonist with a unique chemical structure, pharmacologic profile, and mode of action. Unlike all previously available calcium antagonists, mibefradil acts primarily by selective blockade of T-type calcium channels, rather than L-type channels, at clinically relevant concentrations. It has been evaluated as a treatment for angina in placebo-controlled and active-controlled clinical trials. Treatment with 50 mg mibefradil resulted in a significant improvement in exercise tolerance test duration in three of the five placebo-controlled trials, and a significant improvement in time to onset of angina in two of the five trials. Time to onset of ischemia as evaluated by 0.1 mV ST-segment depression was increased in all five placebo-controlled trials. Treatment with 100 mg mibefradil resulted in significant improvement in all three exercise tolerance test parameters in all studies. Mibefradil further improved exercise tolerance test duration and other efficacy parameters when administered concomitantly to patients on background beta-blocker or nitrate therapy. In addition, treatment with mibefradil was associated with a dose-dependent decrease in heart rate, double product, frequency of anginal attacks, nitroglycerin consumption, and both frequency and duration of silent ischemic episodes. In comparative trials, 100 mg mibefradil once daily was superior in efficacy to 10 mg amlodipine once daily and was at least equivalent to diltiazem in both efficacy and tolerability. Mibefradil was safe and well tolerated in all studies.", 
    "126": "The class III antiarrhythmic agent, azimilide, has been shown to inhibit dihydroalprenolol binding to the beta-adrenergic receptor of rat brain and heart in an in-vitro ligand-binding assay. Azimilide, was assessed for beta-adrenergic activity, either agonist or antagonist, in the isolated perfused guinea pig heart in comparison with class III reference agents and the class II agent, propranolol. Varying concentrations of compound (0.03-100 microM) were retrogradely perfused and the effects on corrected QT interval, baseline heart rate, and isoproterenol-stimulated heart rate were measured. Propranolol, dl-sotalol, azimilide, and d-sotalol inhibited isoproterenol-induced tachycardia with IC50 values (the concentration giving 50% inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated heart rate) of 0.12, 1.4, 14.6, and 38.0 microM, respectively. Clofilium, dofetilide, and sematilide did not affect the action of isoproterenol. Dofetilide, clofilium, azimilide, sematilide, dl-sotalol, and d-sotalol increased the QTc interval approximately 20 ms at concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 30.0, and 100.0 microM, respectively. The class III antiarrhythmic agents also slowed baseline heart rate and exhibited linear R-R and QT-interval relationships of similar slope. Azimilide's antagonism of isoproterenol in this isolated heart model may reflect a direct receptor interaction or a contribution from the bradycardic action of the compound, which distinguishes it from several other pure IKr-blocking class III antiarrhythmic agents.",

    "132": "Among patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP), those who have non-ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are at higher risk for subsequent adverse events. To determine predictors of AMI in patients with UAP, we studied consecutive nonreferral patients with UAP or AMI admitted from the emergency department to the intensive care or telemetry units of an urban teaching hospital over 1 year. There were 280 study patients (mean age 66 years, 1/3 women); 24% had AMI at presentation, whereas 76% had UAP without evidence of AMI. Thresholds of > or = 3 involved leads (odds ratio [OR] 3.3; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.6 to 6.9) and > or = 0.2 mV (OR 5.1; 95% CI 2.2 to 11.6) of ST depression on the presenting electrocardiogram were strongly associated with AMI. The multivariate predictors of AMI were reported duration of symptoms >4 hours (OR 3.8; 95% CI 1.9 to 7.3), absence of prior revascularization (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.6 to 7.5), absence of beta-blocker use before presentation (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.3 to 5.8), and presence of new ST depression (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.4 to 5.7). Using the 4 multivariate predictors, a prediction rule was developed. The percentages of patients with AMI when 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 characteristics were present, respectively, were 7%, 6%, 24%, 46%, and 83% (p <0.001). A similar prediction rule developed from the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Ischemia III trial was validated in our cohort. Among patients with UAP, electrocardiographic and clinical variables can help immediately identify those at high risk for AMI at presentation.", 
    "133": "Although stimulation of insulin secretion by glucose is regulated by coupled oscillations of membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), the membrane events regulating these oscillations are incompletely understood. In the presence of glucose and tetraethylammonium, transgenically derived beta-cells (betaTC3-neo) exhibit coupled voltage and [Ca2+]i oscillations strikingly similar to those observed in normal islets in response to glucose. Using these cells as a model system, we investigated the membrane conductance underlying these oscillations. Alterations in delayed rectifier or Ca2+-activated K+ channels were excluded as a source of the conductance oscillations, as they are completely blocked by tetraethylammonium. ATP-sensitive K+ channels were also excluded, since the ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker tolbutamide substituted for glucose in inducing [Ca2+]i oscillations. Thapsigargin, which depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores, and maitotoxin, an activator of nonselective cation channels, both converted the glucose-dependent [Ca2+]i oscillations into a sustained elevation. On the other hand, both SKF 96365, a blocker of Ca2+ store-operated channels, and external Na+ removal suppressed the glucose-stimulated [Ca2+]i oscillations. Maitotoxin activated a nonselective cation current in betaTC3 cells that was attenuated by removal of extracellular Na+ and by SKF 96365, in the same manner to a current activated in mouse beta-cells following depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Currents similar to these are produced by the mammalian trp-related channels, a gene family that includes Ca2+ store-operated channels and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-activated channels. We found several of the trp family genes were expressed in betaTC3 cells by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using specific primers, but by Northern blot analysis, mtrp-4 was the predominant message expressed. We conclude that a conductance underlying glucose-stimulated oscillations in beta-cells is provided by a Ca2+ store depletion-activated nonselective cation current, which is plausibly encoded by homologs of trp genes.",

In adult patients treated with sotalol, Tdp has been reported to the occur with an incidence of 2%-4%. In children who are treated with sotalol, occurrence of Tdp has been reported in only a single case. A 15-month-old girl with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome developed recurrent syncopal attacks. She had been treated with sotalol 1.5 mg/kg daily since shortly after birth because of recurrent episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. ECG monitoring exhibited frequent Tdp tachycardia. Serum electrolyte levels were normal. Echocardiographic analysis excluded a structural heart defect and did not show any signs of myocardial infection. Sotalol treatment was stopped and an infusion with lidocaine was started. Despite this therapy the Tdp continued. Magnesium aspartate was then administered, which immediately stopped the Tdp. As no other reason was evident, Tdp in this child has to be judged as a proarrhythmia related to sotalol therapy.",

Several compounds had an antagonist effect matching that of propranolol in in vitro (binding data and pA2 values on rat heart ventricle homogenates and guinea pig spontaneously beating right and electrically driven left atrial isolated preparations, respectively) and in in vivo tests (measurement of antagonism toward isoprenaline-induced tachycardia in anesthetized rats).

    "140": "The present study investigated the effect of bisoprolol, a beta 1-selective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), on lipid and glucose metabolism and quality of life (QOL) in elderly patients with essential hypertention. Bisoprolol at doses of 5-10 mg was administered once daily for 12 weeks to 60 non-elderly and 21 elderly outpatients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. In both groups bisoprolol significantly decreased both systolic and diastolic blood pressures and significantly reduced pulse rates to the same extent. The levels of serum cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride, and the response of plasma glucose and insulin to 75 g oral glucose load, were not changed in either group by the bisoprolol treatment. Bisoprolol significantly improved QOL in both groups. Bradycardia, a side effect attributable to bisoprolol, was noted in only one patient in the elderly group. These results suggest that bisoprolol is a safe and useful antihypertensive drug in elderly and non-elderly patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "141": "The contribution of adrenergic stimulation to the proarrhythmic effects of pinacidil (30 microM), an opener of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K+ATP), was tested in an isolated guinea-pig heart model of global ischemia (10 min) and reperfusion (10 min). None (0%) of the control hearts (n=10) elicited arrhythmias during ischemia or reperfusion. In the pinacidil-treated group, one heart (5%) experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT)/fibrillation (VF) during normoxia. During ischemia, 63% (12 out of 19) of pinacidil-treated hearts exhibited episodes of VT or VF. Hearts not in VT or VF (n=7) at the time of reperfusion, exhibited 71% VT and 43% VT/VF upon reperfusion. Proarrhythmic effects of pinacidil during ischemia or reperfusion were completely reversed by glyburide (n=9; 10 microM), a K+ATP antagonist, or nadolol (n=9; 3 microM), a beta-adrenergic antagonist. Isoproterenol (n=10; 50 nM), a beta-adrenergic agonist, induced a 20% incidence of ischemic VT and VF, and a 70% incidence of reperfusion VF, while methoxamine (n=10; 10 microM), an alpha-adrenergic agonist, demonstrated little proarrhythmia (20% VT/VF at reperfusion only). Proarrhythmic effects of isoproterenol were reversed by nadolol, but not glyburide. Pinacidil caused a slight potentiation of tachycardia induced by a bolus injection of tyramine (30 micro g), an indirectly acting sympathomimetic, but bolus injections of pinacidil (100 micro g) had no effect on heart rate. Nisoxetine, a catecholamine uptake 1 inhibitor, had no proarrhythmic effects when given alone. Catecholamine levels were reduced in pinacidil-treated hearts relative to vehicle-treated. In conclusion, it is suggested that the proarrhythmic effects of pinacidil following global ischemia and reperfusion in the isolated perfused guinea-pig heart appears to involve stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. These proarrhythmic effects of pinacidil do not appear to be mediated solely through direct opening of K+ATP, but rather through an indirect enhancement of catecholamine release.", 
    "142": "The effects of topical adrenergic agents on the tissue circulation of the optic nerve head (ONH) were studied in animal and human eyes with use of a laser speckle tissue circulation analyzer. Drugs studied were nipradilol, a beta1-2-blocker with weak alpha-blocking and nitroglycerinlike activities; bunazosin, a selective alpha1-blocker; carteolol, a beta1-2-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity; and betaxolol, a selective beta1-blocker. In the animal experiment, one eye each of nine albino rabbits received 0.25% nipradilol (N = 9) twice daily for 15 days or 0.01% bunazosin (N = 10) twice daily for 20 days; the fellow eye received the vehicle of each drug in a randomized masked design. Normalized blur (NB) in an area of ONH free of visible surface vessels, a quantitative index of peripheral blood velocity in ONH, was measured under general anesthesia before treatment and 2 hours after the last instillation on the 15th or 20th day. At 15 days, intraocular pressure and NB in the nipradilol-treated eyes decreased by 4.3 mm Hg (P < 0.01) and increased by 15.9% (P < 0.01), respectively, while those in the vehicle-treated eyes showed little change. At 20 days NB in both bunazosin- and vehicle-treated eyes showed little change, while intraocular pressure decreased only in the bunazosin-treated eyes (P < 0.01). In the human volunteer experiment NB was averaged over five pulses (mean NB) in both eyes before and 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 hours after a 30 microL instillation of the vehicle of carteolol or betaxolol to serve as a control. Intraocular pressure, blood pressure and pulse rate were also measured. One week later a 30 microL drop of 2.0% carteolol (N = 6) or 0.5% betaxolol (N = 10) was instilled in one randomly chosen eye and the vehicle for each drug in the other eye, and those parameters were measured as above in a double-masked manner. In the carteolol experiment, mean NB in both eyes was significantly higher at 3 hours than it was in the control experiment (P < 0.05), while intraocular pressure was significantly lower in both eyes and blood pressure and pulse rate showed little change. In the betaxolol experiment, intraocular pressure at 1.5 hours and blood pressure at 4.5 hours were significantly lower than those in the control experiment (P < 0.05), while mean NB and pulse rate showed little change. In summary, using the laser speckle method we found that topical nipradilol and carteolol increase ONH blood velocity in rabbits and humans, respectively. This finding suggests that some topical beta-blockers used clinically may influence the ONH tissue circulation in patients and that this method may be used in clinical situations to assess the effect of various drugs on ONH circulation.",

    "146": "In the retrospective study, good responders (n = 16) had a shorter QRS duration (mean (SD): 122.9 (11) v 138 (14.4) ms, p < 0.005) and LAS40 (33.1 (8.9) v 42.5 (7.8) ms, p < 0.005), and a higher RMS40 (31.6 (16.3) v 19.0 (10.3) microV, p < 0.02) than poor responders (n = 15). Signal averaged ECG criteria for good response were defined as two or more of the following: QRS duration < 130 ms, RMS40 > 20 microV, LAS40 < 40 ms (sensitivity 81%, specificity 73%). In the prospective study, six of seven patients who met these criteria showed a good response to the beta blocker treatment, while eight of nine who did not showed a poor response (chi 2 = 6.1, p < 0.02). The signal averaged ECG criteria gave a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 89% for predicting the effectiveness of beta blocker treatment.", 
    "147": "A signal averaged ECG might be useful in predicting the effectiveness of beta blocker treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "148": "Despite its moderate anti-tumour activity in head and neck cancers there have been no reports on the activity of paclitaxel in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer, a highly chemosensitive tumour. A phase II study was thus initiated to determine the objective response rate and toxicity of paclitaxel in patients with previously untreated metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer.", 
    "149": "Twenty-four patients with previously untreated measurable metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma were accrued, one of them ineligible because of concomitant beta-blocker usage. Male:female ratio was 19:5, with a median age of 46 years. All had previously received radiotherapy but were chemotherapy-na\u00efve. The great majority (20 of 24) had undifferentiated carcinoma. Paclitaxel (Anzatax, Faulding Pharmaceuticals) 175 mg/m2 was given intravenously over three hours every 21 days after premedication with oral dexamethasone and intravenous diphenhydramine and cimetidine.", 
    "150": "There were five (21.7%) partial responses while eight patients remained stable. Median response duration was 7.5 months and median survival was 12 months. The main toxicity was haematological, with grade 1-2 neutropenia in 19% and grade 3-4 neutropenia in 4.5% of cycles. Three cycles were complicated by grade 3-4 anaemia and one patient required a blood transfusion. No thrombocytopenia was seen. Peripheral neuropathy was frequent (20 of 23 patients) but mild. Alopecia was complete in 14 patients. There were no cardiac toxicity or hypersensitivity reactions.", 
    "151": "Paclitaxel is well tolerated even in previously irradiated patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer. Single-agent activity was 22% and its inclusion into combination chemotherapy regimens should be studied.", 
    "152": "Medicines work better if taken, which must be true of migraine prophylaxis. There is evidence that compliance with regular medication can be badly deficient. To assess how serious the problem might be in routine migraine management, we undertook a covert observational 2-month survey in a specialist headache clinic using objective measures of compliance. Subjects were 38 patients needing prophylaxis with medication prescribed once (od), twice (bd), or three times daily (tds). Medication was dispensed, unknown to them, in Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS) to record openings in real time. Number, timing, and pattern of actual openings were compared with what was expected. Compliance rates averaged 66%, although returned pill counts indicated 91%. A substantial and significant difference was shown between od and bd or tds regimens. Measures of dosing interval--used-on-schedule rate and therapeutic coverage--averaged between 44% and 71%. Once-daily treatment was associated with a used-on-schedule rate more than double those of multiple daily dosing, but still only 66%. We conclude that routine use of drug prophylaxis in migraine may be so seriously undermined by poor compliance that it has little chance of efficacy. Returned-pill counting is inadequate for compliance assessment.", 
    "153": "Racemic sotalol has demonstrated anti-arrhythmic properties which include Class II (beta blockade) and Class III (potassium channel blockade) activity. The Class II activity is demonstrated primarily in l-sotalol, and Class III activity is almost equipotent in each isomer. Class II and Class III activity of dl-sotalol was investigated following repeated oral administration (80 mg b.i.d.) for 7 days. Class II activity was evaluated according to the low frequency spectral power obtained by fast Fourier analysis of the R-R interval variation. Class III activity was evaluated according to the change in the QTc interval of the surface electrocardiogram. The low frequency spectral power decreased after administration of the first dose on day 1 and this trend continued throughout the duration of the study. The QTc interval did not change with dl-sotalol administration. These findings may suggest that Class II activity is more potent than Class III activity.", 
    "154": "Formoterol, a beta2-adrenergic agonist has been shown in ovariectomized rat models to have anabolic effects on bone. However, those studies did not determine whether the effect of formoterol was by a direct action on bone cells themselves or indirectly via anabolic action on muscle. To address the question of whether formoterol could directly affect osteoblast function we investigated the expression patterns of beta3-adrenergic receptors (betaARs) in human osteoblast-like cells and functional coupling to gene expression. Northern blot analysis showed that betaAR subtypes are expressed at different levels in the osteoblast-like cell lines TE-85, SaOS-2, MG-63, and OHS-4. beta1AR expression was found in SaOS-2, OHS-4, and TE-85, but not MG-63 cells. beta2ARs are expressed at higher levels in MG-63 cells than in TE-85 and SaOS-2 cells, but were not detected in OHS-4 cells. PCR analysis paralleled the northern blot analysis except that beta3AR expression was found in one of three human primary osteoblast cDNAs tested. beta3AR expression was not found in any of the osteoblast-like cell lines. The nonspecific betaAR agonist, isoproterenol, and the beta2AR-specific agonist, formoterol, induced c-fos gene expression in cultured SaOS-2 cells in an immediate early fashion. This effect was inhibited by the beta2AR-specific antagonist, ICI 118551, but not by the beta1AR-specific antagonist, CGP 20712, indicating that induction of c-fos gene expression is specifically mediated by beta2ARs. c-fos gene expression was induced by both isoproterenol and formoterol via increases in cAMP, which in turn activated the cAMP/PKA pathway; the PKA inhibitor, H89, inhibited c-fos gene expression. Thus, betaARs are expressed in osteoblast-like cells and are coupled to c-fos gene expression via the beta2AR, increases in cAMP levels and activation of a PKA-dependent pathway.", 
    "155": "The interactions between substance P and beta-adrenergic agonists such as isoprenaline, dobutamine and terbutaline in the control of the secretion of fluid and protein from the rat submandibular gland have been examined. Substance P elicited large volumes of saliva whereas isoprenaline, dobutamine and terbutaline elicited small volumes only. The secretion of fluid in response to substance P was markedly enhanced when substance P was administered in combination with isoprenaline or dobutamine but not when it was administered in combination with terbutaline. Isoprenaline elicited large amounts of protein, whereas substance P elicited small amounts. The secretion of protein in response to isoprenaline did not change when isoprenaline was administered in combination with substance P. The secretion of fluid and protein induced by substance P in combination with isoprenaline was antagonized by metoprolol and by spantide, but it was unaffected by pretreatment with ICI118551. These results suggest that in the rat submandibular gland stimulation of beta1-adrenoceptors but not of beta2-adrenoceptors potentiates the secretion of fluid that is induced by stimulation of tachykinin receptors, whereas stimulation of tachykinin receptors does not enhance the secretion of protein that is induced by stimulation of beta1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "156": "The effects of chronic treatment of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) with carvedilol, an antihypertensive agent which has both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor-blocking actions, on membrane potential and relaxation of mesenteric resistant artery were studied. Five-week old SHRSP were treated with carvedilol for three months. At 16 weeks, the resting membrane potential of arteries from carvedilol-treated SHRSP was more negative than that of arteries from untreated SHRSP. The magnitude of acetylcholine-induced hyperpolarization in arteries from carvedilol-treated SHRSP was not different from that of arteries from untreated SHRSP. In the presence of noradrenaline, the membrane potential of arteries from carvedilol-treated SHRSP was more negative than that of arteries from untreated SHRSP. The membrane potential of arteries from carvedilol-treated SHRSP in the presence of noradrenaline and acetylcholine was more negative than that of arteries from untreated SHRSP. The acetylcholine-induced relaxation in noradrenaline-precontracted preparations from carvedilol-treated SHRSP was greater than that in preparations from untreated SHRSP and was smaller than that in preparations from Wistar Kyoto rats. Scanning electronmicroscopy showed that carvedilol-treatment decreased the structural abnormalities of the endothelium of arteries from SHRSP. These results indicate that chronic carvedilol treatment made the membrane potential of smooth muscle more negative and improved endothelial function in the mesenteric artery of SHRSP, which may contribute to the antihypertensive effect of carvedilol.", 
    "157": "Expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein immunoreactivity in the rat retina was studied after intravitreal injection of substances known to influence neural function in different ways. The substances were the excitatory amino acid glutamate, the inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide, the depolarizing agent potassium chloride, and the potassium channel blocker barium chloride. In comparison with controls, more beta-amyloid precursor protein immunoreactivity was observed in the radial process of M\u00fcller glial cells 24 hours after injection of glutamate or lipopolysaccharide. In contrast, administration of barium chloride greatly reduced immunostaining in M\u00fcller cells. Further, an increase in immunostaining was observed in the inner and outer plexiform layers in retinas treated with any of the 3 chemicals, and in blood vessels after injection of glutamate and lipopolysaccharide. These observations suggest that multiple but specific signaling pathways are involved in regulating expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein in distinct cell types and regions in the retina.", 
    "158": "Beta-blockers are being revived as effective, safe, reasonably priced and well-tolerated drugs. Differences in the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of beta-blockers now make it possible to select for the therapy of the individual diseases from a wide range of available beta-blockers the most effective drug with the minimal undesirable effects. It is made possible by the progress in the development of this ATS group and particularly by the third generation of these compounds. A proof of the prospects of these drugs is provided by their extended indications as the first-choice drugs (myocardial infarction) as well as the generally extended possibilities of their therapeutic use (therapy of heart failure)."
