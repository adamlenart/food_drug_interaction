At the same time, the desynchronization of rhythms provoked severe sinus arrhythmia which had a distinct periodic character.

In heart failure, activation of sympathetic nervous system has been described as one of the most important pathophysiologic abnormalities in patients with congestive heart failure and as one of the most important mechanisms that may be responsible for progression of heart failure. The use of beta blockers which may inhibit sympathetic activity, might reduce the risk of disease progression in heart failure, improve symptoms and increase survival. Several large clinical trials with metoprolol, carvedilol and bisoprolol have shown that long term use of these agents can improve left ventricular function and symptoms of CHF, it may also reduce hospital readmission and decrease mortality. Current guidelines recommend the use of beta blocker in mild, moderate and severe CHF, in the absence of contraindications or tolerance in combination with ACE inhibitor and diuretics. Beta blocker should be initiated in patients after maximal medical therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitor and digitalis and patients already stabilized and in compensated conditions.

Talinolol was selected as a model analyte. Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and protein precipitation were evaluated regarding sensitivity and throughput for the MALDI-MRM technique and its applicability without and with chromatographic separation. Compared to classical electrospray liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) method development, with MALDI-MRM the tuning of the analyte in single MS mode is more challenging due to interfering matrix background ions. An approach is proposed using background subtraction. With LLE and using a 200 microL human plasma aliquot acceptable precision and accuracy could be obtained in the range of 1 to 1000 ng/mL without any LC separation. Approximately 3 s were required for one analysis. A full calibration curve and its quality control samples (20 samples) can be analyzed within 1 min. Combining LC with the MALDI analysis allowed improving the linearity down to 50 pg/mL, while reducing the throughput potential only by two-fold. Matrix effects are still a significant issue with MALDI but can be monitored in a similar way to that used for LC/ESI-MS analysis.", 
    "31": "Activation of either coexisting beta1- or beta2 -adrenoceptors with noradrenaline or adrenaline, respectively, causes maximum increases of contractility of human atrial myocardium. Previous biochemical work with the beta2 -selective agonist zinterol is consistent with activation of the cascade beta2 -adrenoceptors-->Gsalpha-protein-->adenylyl cyclase-->cAMP-->protein kinase (PKA)-->phosphorylation of phospholamban, troponin I, and C-protein-->hastened relaxation of human atria from nonfailing hearts. However, in feline and rodent myocardium, catecholamines and zinterol usually do not hasten relaxation through activation of beta2 -adrenoceptors, presumably because of coupling of the receptors to Gi protein. It is unknown whether the endogenously occurring beta2 -adrenoceptor agonist adrenaline acts through the above cascade in human atrium and whether its mode of action could be changed in heart failure. We assessed the effects of (-)-adrenaline, mediated through beta2 -adrenoceptors (in the presence of CGP 20712A 300 nM to block beta1 -adrenoceptors), on contractility and relaxation of right atrial trabecula obtained from nonfailing and failing human hearts. Cyclic AMP levels were measured as well as phosphorylation of phospholamban, troponin I, and protein C with Western blots and the back-phosphorylation procedure. For comparison, beta1 -adrenoceptor-mediated effects of (-)-noradrenaline were investigated in the presence of ICI 118,551 (50 nM to block beta2 -adrenoceptors). The positive inotropic effects of both (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline were accompanied by reductions in time to peak force and time to reach 50% relaxation. (-)-Adrenaline caused similar positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in atrial trabeculae from failing hearts. However, the inotropic potency, but not the lusitropic potency, of (-)-noradrenaline was reduced fourfold in atrial trabeculae from heart failure patients. Both (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline enhanced cyclic AMP levels and produced phosphorylation of phospholamban, troponin I, and C-protein to a similar extent in atrial trabeculae from nonfailing hearts. The hastening of relaxation caused by (-)-adrenaline together with the PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of the three proteins involved in relaxation, indicate coupling of beta2 -adrenoceptors to Gs protein. The phosphorylation of phospholamban at serine16 and threonine17 evoked by (-)-adrenaline through beta2 -adrenoceptors and by (-)-noradrenaline through beta1 -adrenoceptors was not different in atria from nonfailing and failing hearts. Activation of beta2 -adrenoceptors caused an increase in phosphorylase a activity in atrium from failing hearts further emphasizing the presence of the beta2 -adrenoceptor-Gsalpha-protein pathway in human heart. The positive inotropic and lusitropic potencies of (-)-adrenaline were conserved across Arg16Gly- and Gln27Glu-beta2 -adrenoceptor polymorphisms in the right atrium from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, chronically treated with beta1 -selective blockers. The persistent relaxant and biochemical effects of (-)-adrenaline through beta2 -adrenoceptors and of (-)-noradrenaline through beta1 -adrenoceptors in heart failure are inconsistent with an important role of coupling of beta2 -adrenoceptors with Gialpha-protein in human atrial myocardium.", 
    "32": "The aim of present study was to evaluate the application of a hydrophilic matrix tablet capable of polyion complex (PIC-tablet) to a controlled-release device for highly water-soluble drugs. The PIC-tablet was prepared from a mixture of dextran sulfate and [2-(diethylamino)ethyl] dextran chloride, and diltiazem hydrochloride was used as a model drug. Release tests revealed that the drug release was sustained even in 50% drug loading and was influenced by ionic strength but not by pH in medium. The drug release mechanism was thus investigated from the viewpoint of drug micelle forming property. The micelle forming ability of diltiazem was examined by the conductivity method, and was found to be influenced by ionic strength but not by pH value in accordance with the release tests. The results suggested that the drug's micelle interacted with the polyionic matrix. Further studies were conducted using metoprolol tartrate and thiamine hydrochloride as cationic drugs and sodium cloxacillin and sodium salicylic acid as anionic ones. The release profiles of the micelle-forming drugs metoprolol tartrate and sodium cloxacillin were also suppressed in spite of different solubility or opposite ionic charge from diltiazem hydrochloride.

The relaxant effects of YM178 were evaluated in rats and humans bladder strips precontracted with carbachol (CCh) and compared with those of isoproterenol and 4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one hydrochloride (CGP-12177A) (beta3-AR agonist). EC50 values of YM178 and isoproterenol in rat bladder strips precontracted with 10(-6) M CCh were 5.1 and 1.4 microM, respectively, whereas those in human bladder strips precontracted with 10(-7) M CCh were 0.78 and 0.28 microM, respectively. In in vivo study, YM178 at a dose of 3 mg/kg i.v. decreased the frequency of rhythmic bladder contraction induced by intravesical filling with saline without suppressing its amplitude in anesthetized rats. These findings suggest the suitability of YM178 as a therapeutic drug for the treatment of symptoms of overactive bladder such as urinary frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence.", 
    "52": "Vasostatins (VSs) are vasoactive peptides derived from chromogranin A (CgA), a protein contained in secretory granules of chromaffin and other cells. The negative inotropic effect and the reduction of isoproterenol (Iso)-dependent inotropism induced by VSs in the heart suggest that they have an antiadrenergic function. However, further investigation of the mechanisms of action of VSs is needed. The aim of the present study was to define the signaling pathways activated by VS-1 in mammalian ventricular myocardium and cultured endothelial cells that lead to the modulation of cardiac contractility. Ca(2+) and nitric oxide (NO) fluorometric confocal imaging was used to study the effects induced by recombinant human VS-1 [STA-CgA-(1-76)] on contractile force, L-type Ca(2+) current, and Ca(2+) transients under basal conditions and after beta-adrenergic stimulation in rat papillary muscles and ventricular cells and the effects on intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and NO production in cultured bovine aortic endothelial (BAE-1) cells. VS-1 had no effect on basal contractility of papillary muscle, but the effect of Iso stimulation was reduced by 27%. Removal of endocardial endothelium and inhibition of NO synthesis and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity abolished the antiadrenergic effect of VS-1 on papillary muscle. In cardiomyocytes, 10 nM VS-1 was ineffective on basal and Iso (1 microM)-stimulated L-type Ca(2+) current and Ca(2+) transients. In BAE-1 cells, VS-1 induced a Ca(2+)-independent increase in NO production that was blocked by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. Our results suggest that the antiadrenergic effect of VS-1 is mainly due to a PI3K-dependent NO release by endothelial cells, rather than a direct action on cardiomyocytes.", 
    "53": "Both small and large biologically active agents were encapsulated into biodegradable sol-gel derived SiO2. Both fast and slowly-eroding SiO2 matrices were prepared. Propranolol represented a small molecule and a model protein, BSA (bovine serum albumin) the larger one. The release mechanisms were studied using two different dissolution media representing extreme cases with respect to the matrix erosion, free dissolution of the SiO2 matrix in sink conditions and a dissolution medium saturated with respect to the matrix. The utilisation of the two different dissolution media as such provided information on the general release mechanisms and power law-based mathematical models supported the propranolol release results. A modified power law is suggested, where both the initially released amount and time are included. BSA was not released without matrix erosion and propranolol release was mainly diffusion-controlled, although the matrix dissolution was needed for R=3 monoliths due to closed pores. It is also shown that for R=30 microparticles propranolol release was partly matrix erosion controlled.", 
    "54": "In Nembutal anaesthetised, spontaneously breathing rats, stereotaxic mapping of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) for respiratory neuronal activity was undertaken. Eight different types of respiratory cells were found between 0.25 and 1.5 mm lateral to midline, extending 0.5 mm caudal to 1.5 mm rostral to obex, and 0.4-1.5 mm below the dorsal surface. A study of the respiratory motor (diaphragm EMG) and neuronal responses to excitatory amino acid (EAA) stimulation of the NTS areas was undertaken. Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve was employed to study the NTS cellular responses to activation of pulmonary afferents. The effects of chemical activation of the midbrain periaqueductal grey (PAG) on NTS respiratory neuronal activity were investigated. EAA microinjections into the ventrolateral NTS rostral to the obex resulted in an increase in respiratory motor frequency along with increases to inspiratory cell discharge, whilst microinjections into the medial NTS caudal to the obex caused respiratory depression. EAA stimulation of calamus scriptorius produced apnea. NTS inspiratory neurones were inhibited following stimulation of ipsilateral vagus nerve, suggesting their involvement in the Hering-Breuer reflex pathway. PAG stimulation caused excitation of the NTS inspiratory cells indicating the presence of an excitatory respiratory pathway between the two nuclei. Following beta-adrenergic antagonist pre-treatment of ventrolateral NTS, EAA microinjections into PAG did not evoke a cardiorespiratory effect. Based on the various findings the role of NTS in organising respiration in the rat is discussed.", 
    "55": "We developed methods for prolonged (12 h), sterile, normothermic perfusion of rat kidneys and screened compounds for renal preservation including: mitochondrial transition pore inhibitor (decylubiquinone); caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD); peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) agonists (gemfibrozil, WY-14643); antioxidants (trolox, luteolin, quercetin); growth factors (HGF, PDGF, EGF, IGF-1, VEGF, transferrin); calpain inhibitor (Z-Val-Phe-CHO); calmodulin inhibitor (W7); K(ATP) opener (minoxidil, minoxidil sulfate); PARP inhibitor (3-aminobenzamide); calcium channel blocker (verapamil); V(2) agonist (DDAVP); diuretics (acetazolamide, hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, mannitol); peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-beta agonist (L-165041); dopamine agonist (dopamine); essential fatty acid (linolenic acid); beta-NAD; urea; uric acid; and aldosterone. In pilot studies, only PPARalpha agonists and mannitol provided promising results. Accordingly, these agents were investigated further. Fifteen rat kidneys were perfused for 12 h with L-15 media at 37 degrees C in the absence or presence of mannitol, gemfibrozil, gemfibrozil + mannitol or WY-14643. Chronic perfusion in untreated kidneys caused destruction of glomerular and tubular architecture (light and electron microscopy), disappearance of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase-alpha(1) (Western blotting), and apoptosis (Apoptag staining). Gemfibrozil and WY-14643 marginally improved some biomarkers of renal preservation. However, the combination of gemfibrozil with mannitol markedly improved all parameters of renal preservation. We conclude that PPARalpha agonists, particularly when combined with mannitol, protect organs from normothermic, perfusion-induced damage.",

The goal of the present study was to determine the extent to which chronically enhanced sympathetic drive, in the absence of heart failure, alters reflex autonomic control in conscious, transgenic (TG) rabbits with overexpressed cardiac Gsalpha. Nine TG rabbits and seven wild-type (WT) littermates were instrumented with a left ventricular (LV) pressure micromanometer and arterial catheters and studied in the conscious state. Compared with WT rabbits, LV function was enhanced in TG rabbits, as reflected by increased levels of LV dP/dt (5,600 +/- 413 vs. 3,933 +/- 161 mmHg/s). Baseline heart rate was also higher (P < 0.05) in conscious TG (247 +/- 10 beats/min) than in WT (207 +/- 10 beats/min) rabbits and was higher in TG after muscarinic blockade (281 +/- 9 vs. 259 +/- 8 beats/min) or combined beta-adrenergic receptor and muscarinic blockade (251 +/- 6 vs. 225 +/- 9 beats/min).

With veratrine administration, the bradycardia was enhanced in TG for any given decrease in arterial pressure. Thus the chronically enhanced sympathetic drive in TG rabbits with overexpressed cardiac Gsalpha resulted in enhanced LV function and heart rate and impaired reflex autonomic control.

    "95": "We previously identified melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) in a search for genes associated with hypoglossal nerve regeneration. As melanocortins promote nerve regeneration after axonal injury, we investigated whether MC4R functions as a key receptor for peripheral nerve regeneration. In situ hybridization revealed that MC4R mRNA is induced in mouse hypoglossal motor neurons after axonal injury, whereas mRNAs for MC1R, MC2R, MC3R, and MC5R are not expressed either before or after nerve injury. This result was confirmed by RT-PCR. The level of MC4R mRNA expression increased significantly from day 3 after axotomy, reached a peak on day 5, and decreased to the control level on day 14. Similar induction of MC4R was observed in axotomized mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). MC4R mRNA expression was induced exclusively among the MCR family in the L4-6 DRG after sciatic nerve injury. We further examined whether alpha-melanocortin stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) promotes neurite elongation via MC4R. In mouse DRG neuron culture, alpha-MSH significantly promoted neurite outgrowth at a concentration of 10(-8) mol/L. This neurite-elongation effect was entirely inhibited by the addition of a selective MC4R blocker, JKC-363. Therefore, it is concluded that alpha-MSH could stimulate neurite elongation via MC4R in DRG neurons. The present results suggest that induction of MC4R is crucial for motor and sensory neurons to regenerate after axonal injury.",

    "97": "Although mutant receptors are highly useful to dissect the signal transduction pathways of receptors, they are difficult to study in physiological target tissues, due to the presence of endogenous receptors. To study AT(1) angiotensin receptors in their physiological environment, we constructed a mutant receptor, which differs only from the AT(1A) receptor in its reduced affinity for candesartan, a biphenylimidazole antagonist. We have determined that the conserved S109Y substitution of the rat AT(1A) receptor eliminates its candesartan binding, without exerting any major effect on its angiotensin II and peptide angiotensin receptor antagonist binding, internalization kinetics, beta-arrestin binding, and potency or efficacy of the inositol phosphate response. To demonstrate the usefulness of this mutant receptor in signal transduction studies, we combined it with substitution of the highly conserved DRY sequence with AAY, which abolishes G protein activation. In rat C9 hepatocytes the S109Y receptor caused ERK activation with the same mechanism as the endogenous AT(1) receptor. After combination with the DRY/AAY mutation G protein-independent ERK activation was detected demonstrating that this approach can be used to study the angiotensin II-stimulated signaling pathways in cells endogenously expressing AT(1) receptors.",

Experimental evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a dominant role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Carvedilol, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor and selective alpha1-adrenoceptor blocker, also has antioxidant and free radical scavenger properties. In the present study the effect of carvedilol on the antioxidative status of cardiac tissue was investigated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced early diabetic rats. The subjects were randomly divided into age-matched rats, STZ-induced untreated diabetic rats, small and large dosage (1mg/kg/d or 10mg/kg/d) carvedilol-administrated diabetic rats. After 5 weeks, hemodynamic parameters, echocardiography characteristics and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the cardiac tissues of all groups were meassured. Diabetic rats had lower ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and higher systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and developed pressure. These parameters were improved by administration of carvedilol. Diabetic rats showed elevated MDA level and CAT activity, but lower activities of SOD and GSH-Px. Carvedilol treatment increased activities of SOD and GSH-Px in diabetic rats. These results indicate that carvedilol improves cardiac function via its antioxidant property in diabetic rats.",

The effects of rutin on rings preconstricted with phenylephrine, with or without endothelium, were determined using an organ bath technique. The mechanism was explored by measuring the effects of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME), the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor methylene blue, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, the ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup>channel blocker glibenclamide and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Rutin at the range of 10-160 mumol/L caused dose-dependent vasorelaxation in preconstricted endothelium-intact rings, but had no effect on rings without endothelium. The maximal response calculated from the vasorelaxation curves of rutin was 44.28 plus or mines 7.48%. Pretreatment with L-NAME (0.1 mmol/L), methylene blue (10 mumol/L), glibenclamide (10 mmol/L) or indomethacin (10 mmol/L) attenuated the vasorelaxation induced by rutin in endothelium-intact rings. Glibenclamide (10 mmol/L) enhanced the vasorelaxation of rutin. Propranolol (10 mumol/L) did not block the effect of rutin. The results indicate that vasorelaxation is induced by rutin via the nitric oxide-guanylyl cyclase pathway and a prostaglandin-mediated mechanism, as well as activation of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel.",

Nebivolol is also subjected to a complex metabolic process where glucuronidation, aromatic and alicyclic hydroxylation are the major pathways leading to several metabolites. We have studied the effect of nebivolol, its enantiomers and metabolites on intracellular oxidative stress and NO availability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, since the receptors involved in this endothelial effect of nebivolol remain controversial, we have studied this matter by the use of antagonists of beta-AR. dl-Nebivolol, d-nebivolol and l-nebivolol significantly reduced the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide induced by oxidized-low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), although the racemic and l-form were significantly more active than d-nebivolol in this activity. A marked decrease in the availability of intracellular NO was found in HUVECs exposed to ox-LDL and this parameter was normalized by the prior incubation with dl-nebivolol, d-nebivolol and l-nebivolol; the effect of racemate was mainly mimicked by its l-enantiomer. eNOS activity significantly increased by a 5-min contact of HUVECs with dl-nebivolol and l-nebivolol, but not with d-nebivolol, and a similar pattern was observed when the intracellular calcium increase was measured. The metabolites A2, A3', A12 and A14 but not A1, A3 and R 81,928, derived from different metabolic pathways, retained the antioxidant activity of the parent racemic compound dl-nebivolol, reducing the intracellular formation of ROS and superoxide. The effects of dl-nebivolol on intracellular formation of NO, eNOS activity and intracellular Ca(2+) were partially antagonized by the antagonists of beta(1-2)-AR nadolol or by the beta(3)-AR antagonist SR59230A and further antagonized by their combination or by (beta(1-2-3)-AR antagonist bupranolol. In conclusion, this study shows that the NO releasing effect of nebivolol is mainly due to its l-enantiomer; the racemate and its enantiomers possess a remarkable antioxidant activity that contributes to its effect on the cellular NO metabolism and the activation of beta(3)-AR through a calcium dependent pathway is involved in the mechanisms leading to the NO release.", 
    "105": "The sorption behavior of the amine containing beta-receptor blocking agent propranolol (Ppn) in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) vesicles was investigated. Both protonated and unprotonated Ppn were measured in the continuous phase after removal of the vesicles containing sorbed Ppn by centrifugation. In contrast, by analyzing the surface charge density, deduced from electrophoretic mobility measurements, only the sorbed protonated Ppn was determined. A partitioning model was used to describe the sorption behavior. Sensitivity analysis revealed that sufficiently reliable and independent parameters were obtained. The partition coefficient of the unprotonated Ppn was about 22 times higher than that of the protonated analogue. Statistical analysis revealed a significant increase in the intrinsic partition coefficients of both Ppn analogues with an increase in the salt concentration.", 
    "106": "Myocardial beta adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) concentration can substantially decrease in congestive heart failure and significantly increase in chronic volume overload, such as in severe aortic valve regurgitation. Positron emission tomography (PET) with an appropriate ligand-receptor model can be used for noninvasive estimation of myocardial beta-AR concentration in vivo. An optimal design of the experiment protocol, however, is needed for sufficiently precise estimates of beta-AR concentration in a heterogeneous population. Standard methods of optimal design do not account for a heterogeneous population with a wide range of beta-AR concentrations and other physiological parameters and consequently are inadequate. To address this, we have developed a methodology to design a robust two-injection protocol that provides reliable estimates of myocardial beta-AR concentration in normal and pathologic states. A two-injection protocol of the high affinity beta-AR antagonist [18F]-(S)-fluorocarazolol was designed based on a computer-generated (or synthetic) population incorporating a wide range of beta-AR concentrations. Timing and dosage of the ligand injections were optimally designed with minimax criterion to provide the least bad beta-AR estimates for the worst case in the synthetic population. This robust experiment design for PET was applied to experiments with pigs before and after beta-AR upregulation by chemical sympathectomy. Estimates of beta-AR concentration were found by minimizing the difference between the model-predicted and experimental PET data. With this robust protocol, estimates of beta-AR concentration showed high precision in both normal and pathologic states. The increase in beta-AR concentration after sympathectomy predicted noninvasively with PET is consistent with the increase shown by in vitro assays in pig myocardium. A robust experiment protocol was designed for PET that yields reliable estimates of beta-AR concentration in a population with normal and pathologic states. This methodology is applicable in general to optimal estimation of parameters in heterogeneous populations.",

    "117": "Both beta-adrenergic blockade and bradycardia may contribute to the therapeutic effect of beta-blockers in chronic heart failure (CHF). This study tested the relative importance of bradycardia by comparing cilobradine (Cilo), a sinus node inhibitor, with a beta-blocker, metoprolol (Meto), in an established canine model of CHF. Dogs were chronically instrumented for hemodynamic and left ventricular (LV) volume measurements. CHF was created by daily coronary embolization via a chronically implanted coronary (left anterior descending coronary artery) catheter. After establishment of CHF, control (n=6), Meto (30 mg/day, n=5), Cilo (low) (1 mg/kg/day, n=5), or Cilo (high) (3 mg/kg/day, n=5) was given orally for 12 weeks. Systemic hemodynamics, echocardiography, and pressure volume analysis were measured at baseline, at CHF, and 3 months after treatment in an awake state. Protein levels of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA2a), ryanodine receptor (RyR2), and Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) were measured by Western blot. RyR2 protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation was determined by back-phosphorylation. After 12 weeks, Meto and Cilo (high and low) produced similar bradycardic effects, accompanied by a significantly improved LV dP/dt versus control [Meto, 2602+/-70; Cilo (low), 2517+/-45; Cilo (high), 2579+/-78; control, 1922+/-115 mm Hg/s; p<0.05]. Both Meto and Cilo (high) normalized protein levels of SERCA2a and NCX1 and reversed PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2, in contrast to controls. High-dose cilobradine effectively produced bradycardia and improved cardiac function after CHF, comparable with metoprolol. Restored protein levels of SERCA2a and improved function of RyR2 may be important mechanisms associated with cilobradine therapy.",

However, most (69%) major cardiac events occurred in patients not meeting criteria for cardiac testing. Abnormal noninvasive cardiac testing results did not alter medication recommendations and only resulted in coronary revascularization in 0.6% of patients.

    "127": "Previous investigations have shown that rat adrenocortical cells are provided with galanin receptors, and galanin stimulates glucocorticoid secretion from dispersed cells. The present study aimed to clarify the possible role of galanin in the physiological regulation of rat adrenal secretory activity. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction detected galanin mRNA expression in the adrenal medulla, but not in the cortex. Sizeable concentrations of galanin-immunoreactivity were measured by radioimmune assay only in the adrenomedullary tissue. Galanin raised norepinephrine, but not epinephrine, release from adrenomedullary tissue. Galanin immunoneutralization (obtained with concentrations of anti-galanin antibody able to block the galanin glucocorticoid secretagogue effect on dispersed adrenocortical cells) decreased basal corticosterone production from adrenal slices containing adrenomedullary tissue, without affecting that from dispersed adrenocortical cells. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist l-alprenolol partially prevented galanin-stimulated corticosterone secretion from adrenal slices, without per se altering basal secretion. Taken together, our findings allow us to conclude that endogenous galanin, produced in adrenal medulla, is involved in the regulation of adrenocortical glucocorticoid secretion acting via a two-fold paracrine mechanism: i) direct activation of adrenocortical galanin receptors; and ii) stimulation of adrenomedullary release of catecholamines, which in turn activate beta-adrenoceptors located on adrenocortical cells.", 
    "128": "We hypothesize that remodelling of action potential and intracellular calcium (Ca(i)) dynamics in the peri-infarct zone contributes to ventricular arrhythmogenesis in the postmyocardial infarction setting. To test this hypothesis, we performed simultaneous optical mapping of Ca(i) and membrane potential (V(m)) in the left ventricle in 15 rabbit hearts with myocardial infarction for 1 week. Ventricular premature beats frequently originated from the peri-infarct zone, and 37% showed elevation of Ca(i) prior to V(m) depolarization, suggesting reverse excitation-contraction coupling as their aetiology. During electrically induced ventricular fibrillation, the highest dominant frequency was in the peri-infarct zone in 61 of 70 episodes. The site of highest dominant frequency had steeper action potential duration restitution and was more susceptible to pacing-induced Ca(i) alternans than sites remote from infarct. Wavebreaks during ventricular fibrillation tended to occur at sites of persistently elevated Ca(i). Infusion of propranolol flattened action potential duration restitution, reduced wavebreaks and converted ventricular fibrillation to ventricular tachycardia. We conclude that in the subacute phase of myocardial infarction, the peri-infarct zone exhibits regions with steep action potential duration restitution slope and unstable Ca(i) dynamics. These changes may promote ventricular extrasystoles and increase the incidence of wavebreaks during ventricular fibrillation. Whereas increased tissue heterogeneity after subacute myocardial infarction creates a highly arrhythmogenic substrate, dynamic action potential and Ca(i) cycling remodelling also contribute to the initiation and maintenance of ventricular fibrillation in this setting.",

    "136": "A rapid, sensitive and selective method for the determination of carvedilol in human plasma was developed using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS). Carvedilol and cisapride (internal standard) were extracted from human plasma with methyl tert-butyl ether at basic pH and analyzed on an Atlantis HILIC Silica column with the mobile phase of acetonitrile-ammonium formate (50 mM, pH 4.5) (90:10, v/v). The analytes were detected using an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple-reaction-monitoring mode. The standard curve was linear (r=0.9998) over the concentration range of 0.1-200 ng/ml. The lower limit of quantification for carvedilol was 0.1 ng/ml using 50 microl plasma sample. The coefficient of variation and relative error for intra- and inter-assay at four QC levels were 1.6-4.5% and -6.4 to 4.8%, respectively. The absolute and relative matrix effect for carvedilol and cisapride were practically absent. The extraction recoveries of carvedilol and cisapride were 81.6 and 85.2%, respectively. This method was successfully applied to the bioequivalence study of carvedilol in humans.", 
    "137": "The beneficial effect of antihypertensive treatment on the risk of major vascular events is well established. Several trials comparing older and newer drugs in the treatment of primary hypertension suggested that it is the blood pressure achieved, rather than choice of the drug that determines most of the primary outcomes. Beta-blockers have been widely used to treat hypertension and are still recommended as first-line drugs in guidelines. However, recent meta-analyses of trials (either placebo-controlled or using drug comparisons) involving atenolol (a popular beta-blocker), have cast doubt on the suitability of atenolol as a first-line antihypertensive drug. We consider the mechanisms which might be responsible for the inferiority of atenolol in preventing vascular morbidity and mortality in patients with primary hypertension. This knowledge may help design drugs that are not only more effective in achieving blood pressure targets but that also markedly decrease vascular events.", 
    "138": "A buccal patch for systemic administration of carvedilol in the oral cavity has been developed using two different mucoadhesive polymers. The formulations were tested for in vitro drug permeation studies, buccal absorption test, in vitro release studies, moisture absorption studies and in vitro bioadhesion studies. The physicochemical interactions between carvedilol and polymers were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. According to FTIR the drug did not show any evidence of an interaction with the polymers used and was present in an unchanged state. XRD studies reveal that the drug is in crystalline state in the polymer matrix. The results indicate that suitable bioadhesive buccal patches with desired permeability could be prepared. Bioavailability studies in healthy pigs reveal that carvedilol has got good buccal absorption. The bioavailability of carvedilol from buccal patches has increased 2.29 folds when compared to that of oral solution. The formulation AC5 (HPMC E 15) shows 84.85 + 0.089% release and 38.69 + 6.61% permeated through porcine buccal membrane in 4 hr.

This analysis compares characteristics, outcomes, and carvedilol dosing of blacks and whites in COHERE. Compared with whites (n=3433), blacks (n=523) had more severe HF symptoms despite similar systolic function. At similar carvedilol maintenance doses, symptoms improved in 33% of blacks vs 28% of whites, while worsening in 10% and 11%, respectively (both nonsignificant), and HF hospitalization rates were reduced comparably in both groups (-58% vs -56%, respectively; both P<.001). Incidence and hazard ratios of death were similar in blacks and whites (6.9% vs 7.5%, hazard ratio 1.2 vs 1.0, P=.276).

All analyses with S-(-)-atenolol as the internal standard were conducted at ambient temperature. The assay involved the use of a solid-phase extraction procedure for human plasma samples prior to HPLC analysis. The C18 cartridge gave good recovery rates for both enantiomers without any interference. The method was validated over the range of 20-200 ng/ml for each enantiomer concentration. Recovery rates for S-(-)- and R-(+)-bisoprolol enantiomers were in the range of 95-102%. The method proved to be precise (within-run precision expressed as % RSD ranged from 1.0-6.2% and between-run precision ranged from 0.9-6.7%) and accurate (within-run accuracies expressed as percentage error ranged from 0.2-4.8% and between-run accuracies ranged from 0.3-1.7%).

    "141": "Rats stressed by specific alternation of rhythm in temperature (SART) show various symptoms of disautonomia, increased pulse rates, continuous hypotension, and severe orthostatic hypotension (OH) when they are subjected to postural change. The OH symptoms are improved by muscarinic M2-receptor blockers. In the present study, effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents on OH in SART-stressed rats were investigated. Anesthetized rats were restrained on a board in the supine position, and direct blood pressure and ECG were measured automatically using Fluclet Jr.2. Postural change was performed by raising the rat's head up to a 60 degrees angle for 4 min. Unstressed rats treated with hexamethonium showed large decrease in blood pressure, small reflex from the bottom of pressure and decreased tachycardia reflex, whereas isoproterenol showed little changes. In SART-stressed rats, isoproterenol alleviated the decrease in blood pressure in postural change, brought large reflex from the bottom of pressure and increased tachycardia reflex, whereas hexamethonium had little changes. Propranolol and atenolol induced the similar changes as those seen by hexamethonium. ICI-118,551, a selective beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist showed large reflex from the bottom of pressure and increased tachycardia reflex in stressed rats, whereas little changes in unstressed rats. In conclusion, it was suggested that the hypotension in OH manifestation time of rats reflects the state of peripheral blood vessels, and beta1-adrenoceptors played a role in compensatory tachycardia reflex and beta2-adrenoceptors in blood pressure reflex. The circulatory regulation in SART-stressed rats seems to be poorly functioning in nervous reflex in postural changes.", 
    "142": "Spreading depression (SD) has long been associated with the underlying pathophysiology of migraine. Evidence that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor (NMDA-R) is implicated in the generation and propagation of SD has itself been available for more than 15 years. However, to date, there are no reports of NMDA-R antagonists being developed for migraine therapy. In this study, an uncompetitive, pan-NMDA-R blocker, memantine, approved for clinical use, and two antagonists with selectivity for NMDA-R containing the NR2B subunit, (1S,2S)-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidino)-1-propanol (CP-101,606) and (+/-)-(R*,S*)-alpha-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-beta-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidine propanol (Ro 25-6981), were investigated to assess their protective effects against SD in the rat. Under isoflurane anesthesia, d.c. potential and the related cortical blood flow and partial pressure of O2 (pO2) were recorded simultaneously at separate cortical sites. Drugs (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg i.p.) were given 1 h or 30 min before KCl application to the brain surface. Core temperature and arterial pCO2,pO2, and pH measurements confirmed physiological stability. KCl induced 7.7+/-1.8 (mean+/-S.D.) SD events with d.c. amplitude of 14.9+/-2.8 mV. Memantine and CP-101,606 dose-dependently decreased SD event number (to 2.0+/-1.8 and 2.3+/-2.9, respectively) and SD amplitude at doses relevant for therapeutic use. Ro 25-6981 also decreased SD events significantly, but less effectively (to 4.5+/-1.6), without affecting amplitude. These results indicate that NR2B-containing NMDA receptors are key mediators of SD, and as such, memantine- and NR2B-selective antagonists may be useful new therapeutic agents for the treatment of migraine and other SD-related disorders (e.g., stroke and brain injury). Whether chronic, rather than acute, treatment may improve their efficacy remains to be determined.", 
    "143": "The combination therapy of nitrate and selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist has shown benefits for treatment of hypertension and heart disease than either drug alone. The objectives of the present study were to define effects on the anti-hypertension activity and pharmacokinetics of a novel transdermal patch incorporating isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) with bisoprolol (BP). The 3:2 ratio of ISDN to BP (mg/mg) in the transdermal patches exhibited better anti-hypertension effect synergistically with a similar inhibiting heart rates effect to that of BP alone in renovascular hypertensive rats, and was therefore selected as a final formulation. The in vitro transdermal penetration of both ISDN and BP from the patches displayed a zero-order process, and the penetration rate constants were 7.4 microg/(cm(2)h) for ISDN, and 5.9 microg/(cm(2)h) for BP, respectively. After transdermal administration at single dose or multiple doses, the synergistic anti-hypertension effect was confirmed in spontaneously hypertensive rats also. The effect of each patch lasts for 3 days, and increased with the total dose of two drugs (2mg/cm(2), ISDN:BP=3:2, mg/mg), showing a dose dependant manner. After transdermal administration to rabbits, the absolute bioavailabilities were 33.6% for ISDN, and 31.3% for BP, respectively. The maximal concentrations (C(max)) of both drugs were significantly reduced while the areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), and mean residence times (MRT) were evidently increased and extended, respectively. As a patient-friendly, convenient, and multi-day dosing therapeutic system, the transdermal patches incorporating ISDN and BP could be promising for prevention and treatment of hypertension.",

All action potentials had minor phase-1 notches, resembling the endocardial action potential in the ventricular free wall. Increasing cycle lengths and concentrations of sotalol and ATX-II prolonged APD without midmyocardial preference and increased the transseptal dispersion of APDs.",

    "148": "The three beta-adrenoceptor subtypes (beta(1), beta(2), beta(3)) represent important therapeutic targets. The use of beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists as bronchodilators and beta(1) or beta(1)/beta(2) antagonists as antihypertensives is well established; research is ongoing in these areas to refine pharmacodynamic properties. It is also feasible to design molecules combining beta-adrenoceptor affinity with other pharmacophores. This is facilitated by the ability to confer beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity via attachment of a phenylethanolamine moiety or to incorporate diverse structural elements in the N-alkyl substituent of a beta-adrenoceptor agonist or antagonist. beta(3)-Adrenoceptor agonists have not yet been successfully developed as drugs for any therapeutic indication; nevertheless, during the past few years many highly potent and selective beta(3)-agonists have been reported, some with good oral bioavailability. Selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonists have also been identified; useful pharmacological tools are now available for the evaluation of the functional role of each beta-adrenoceptor subtype.", 
    "149": "The subclassification of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors has resulted in many opportunities for drug discovery. Important adrenoceptor targets include beta(2)-agonists as bronchodilators, beta(1) or beta(1)/beta(2) antagonists as antihypertensives, centrally acting alpha(2)-agonists for a variety of applications and alpha(1)-antagonists for hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The pharmacology and nomenclature of 9 adrenoceptors is now established, with alpha(1), alpha(2) and beta-adrenoceptors being divided into three subtypes each. It is unlikely that additional discrete adrenoceptor sequences will be identified; however the presence of \"affinity states\" can give rise to tissue specific differences in pharmacology for a specific subtype. Polymorphisms and splice variants of adrenoceptors continue to be identified; in some cases these modifications can affect pharmacological characteristics and could influence the efficacy of adrenoceptor-targeted therapy. Selective antagonists are now available of all 9 adrenoceptor subtypes. Although these will not all have therapeutic application, the availability of improved pharmacologic tools could lead to the identification of new adrenoceptor targets.", 
    "150": "Beta-blockers are a very important group of drugs widely used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. All aryloxyaminopropanols are chiral and show different stereoselectivity in their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties for each enantiomer. The more potent beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity is generally associated with (S)-enantiomers. Most beta-blocking agents are sold as racemates although (R)-enantiomers not only show in some cases lack of activity but might be responsible for undesirable effects. Among reports on the direct enzymatic resolution of the most representative beta-blocker propranolol, the most interesting is N-acetylation method with commercially available lipases to yield (S)-N-acetylpropranolol. Another type of the one-step (S)-isomer biocatalytic preparation from racemic mixture of propranolol is the biodegradation with the fungus. Biocatalytic methods of obtaining homochiral beta-blockers that are focused on production of versatile precursors are widely described in literature. The strategies based on the use of glycidol and derivatives as C-3 synthones have been shown to be extremely useful for the introduction of the 2-propanol chain on the aromatic system. Halohydrins are the established intermediates in the preparation of optically active beta-blockers. Its resolution by esterhydrolases has been used as a standard alternative in preparation of the homochiral propranolol. Additionally, the enzymatic resolution of the following intermediates was reported: 1-azido-3-aryloxy-2-propanols, 4-(1-aryloxy)-3-hydroxybutyric acid esters, glycerol and cyanohydrin derivatives. However, even the highly enantioselective lipase-catalyzed process can only provide 50% of the starting racemate in an optically active form. An alternative method such as a reduction of a prochiral ketone by various strains of yeast might quantitatively provide an enantiomeric product with a yield greater than 50%. The reported substrates for microbial reductions were: 1-halo-aryloxypropan-2-ones and 1-acetoxy-aryloxypropan-2-ones.", 
    "151": "The beneficial effects of beta-blocker therapy in patients with heart failure have been consistently shown by multi-center randomised trials. These agents are effective and also relatively well tolerated in the elderly and in patients with diabetes and advanced heart failure--traditionally considered as relative contraindications to their administration. However, the use of beta-blockers in clinical practice remains low. The difficulties in their initiation and up-titration may be overcome by patient and physician education, as well as by their initiation during hospitalisation and/or the involvement of non-physician providers (i.e., a nurse facilitator). Forthcoming advances in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of some beta-blockers, and testing of novel methods for patient and drug selection may be based on genetic testing, and may allow further improvement of beta-blocker therapy in the next future.", 
    "152": "We investigated whether treatments with beta-blockers or other administrations that have similar actions to beta-blockers, such as Chinese herbs or needling, were effective in treating osteoporosis induced by ovariectomy (OVX). Female Wister rats were divided into five groups: a sham-operated control group treated with vehicle (Sham, n = 8), an ovariectomized (OVX) group treated with vehicle (Model, n = 8), an OVX group administered with propranolol (Pro, n = 10), an OVX group administered an ethanol extract of Fructus Citri Sarcodactylis (Fcs, n = 9), and an OVX punctured at Sanyinjiao (SP-6) and Neiguan (PC-6) (Needling, n = 8). The treatment started when rats were 12 weeks old and continued for 24 weeks. Serum osteocalcin and urinary deoxypyridinoline (Dpd) levels were upregulated in rats in response to OVX, together with a significantly decreased BMD and trabecular bone area. The Pro, Fcs and Needling treatment improved the decreased BMD and the trabecular area, increased the trabecular number, lowered the trabecular separation to some extent as well as significantly depressed the urinary Dpd levels (p < 0.05). The bone formation markers, such as the mineralizing surface, mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate were not significantly changed, along with a slightly higher trend of osteocalcin levels when compared with the Model rats. The slower heart rate and lower plasma NE levels in these therapeutic groups were also found. Our results suggested that propranolol, Fcs and needling on Sanyinjiao (SP-6) and Neiguan (PC-6) may improve the bone mass of OVX rats, and it provides an alternative and potential therapy for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.",

Little is still known however, concerning the nature of the putative bacterial adrenergic and/or dopaminergic receptor(s) to which catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine) may bind and exert their effects, or even whether the binding properties of such a receptor are similar between different species.", 
    "154": "Use of specific catecholamine receptor antagonists revealed that only alpha, and not beta, adrenergic antagonists were capable of blocking norepinephrine and epinephrine-induced growth, while antagonism of dopamine-mediated growth was achieved with the use of a dopaminergic antagonist. Both adrenergic and dopaminergic antagonists were highly specific in their mechanism of action, which did not involve blockade of catecholamine-facilitated iron-acquisition. Use of radiolabeled norepinephrine suggested that the adrenergic antagonists could be acting by inhibiting catecholamine uptake.",

Beta-blockers (BB) were shown to provide mortality benefit in patients with SHF, and currently indicated in all stages of patients with SHF. We evaluated the factors influencing the prescription of BBs at discharge in patients hospitalised with HF. Hospital discharge records of consecutive 1418 patients (996 men, 422 women) with a mean age of 57 +/- 15 years, hospitalised and treated for SHF (EF < 45%), were retrospectively reviewed. Mean age of female (n = 422) and male patients (n = 996) was similar (58 +/- 15 years vs. 58 +/- 14 years, p = 0.654). Mean EF was 33 +/- 7%, and not different for each sex (p = 0.288). BBs were present in 47.4% of patients at hospital discharge, and female patients were more frequently prescribed than men (51.7% vs. 45.7%, p = 0.036). Patients who were prescribed BBs at discharge were younger than those who were not (p = 0.034). Patients who were prescribed BBs at discharge had significantly higher EF than those who were not (p = 0.019). Older patients were prescribed low-dose BBs. Besides, creatinine level was significantly higher in the group who were prescribed low-dose BBs than those who were prescribed high dose. However, EF was significantly lower in the group, who were prescribed low-dose BBs than in those prescribed moderate-high dose (33 +/- 7% vs. 35 +/- 7%, p = 0.023). There exist several factors associated with underuse of this highly recommended medication in patients with HF.",

    "161": "Carvedilol a poorly water soluble drug undergoes extensive first pass metabolism, which reduces its bioavailability to 25-30%. Mouth dissolving tablets of Carvedilol were prepared with the purpose of delivering the drug directly into the systemic circulation and bypassing the hepatic first pass metabolism with a concomitant increase in bioavailability. The solubility of Carvedilol was improved by forming inclusion complex with cyclodextrin which was then further used for the formulation of mouth dissolving tablet. Differential scanning calorimetry and Infrared spectroscopy results indicated no incompatibilities between drug-excipient mixtures. Effect of three different superdisintegrants on disintegration was studied. The formulations were evaluated for drug content, content uniformity, friability, disintegration time and in-vitro dissolution. Tablets containing Carvedilol-beta-cyclodextrin complex exhibited good tablet properties, with 90% drug dissolved within 5 min. This demonstrated the effectiveness of using various superdisintegrants and Carvedilol-beta-cyclodextrin complex in formulation of mouth dissolving tablet.", 
    "162": "Pharmacologic therapy to alleviate symptoms in chronic angina has been enhanced by the recent approval of several novel compounds that complement the traditional approach using beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, calcium antagonists, and long-acting nitrates. In the United States, ranolazine, a drug that inhibits late I(Na), was approved for patients with chronic angina that remain symptomatic on beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, or long-acting nitrates, on the basis of an acceptable safety profile and efficacy in several randomized placebo controlled studies. A slight increase in the QT interval is observed (<10 ms on average) at the maximum approved dose of 1,000 mg twice daily. Therefore, an ECG should be acquired at baseline and during follow-up, and the drug should not be used in patients with QT prolongation or those who are on QT prolonging drugs unless longer term randomized outcome data demonstrates no excess risk. The MERLIN trial of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE ACS) randomized 6,560 patients to assess the potential benefit of ranolazine in reducing the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and recurrent ischemia, with results expected in 2007. In Europe, ivabradine, a drug that inhibits the hyperpolarization-activated mixed sodium/potassium inward I(f) current, which slows the rest and exercise heart rate, was approved in 2005. Ivabradine at a dose of 10 mg twice daily has been shown to have similar efficacy to amlodipine 10 mg once daily or atenolol 100 mg once daily in alleviating chronic angina symptoms. In this review, several other novel investigational approaches are presented and patient selection considerations for the most recent approved drugs for chronic angina are discussed.", 
    "163": "Ischemic heart disease is the foremost cause of death in the United States and the developed countries. Stable angina is the initial manifestation of ischemic heart disease in one half of the patients and becomes a recurrent symptom in survivors of myocardial infarction (MI) and other forms of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). There are multiple therapeutic modalities currently available for treatment of anginal symptoms in patients with stable CAD. These include anti-anginal drugs and myocardial revascularization procedures such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABGS), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Anti-anginal drug therapy is based on treatment with nitrates, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. A newly approved antianginal drug, ranolazine, is undergoing phase III evaluation. Not infrequently, combination therapy is often necessary for adequate symptom control in some patients with stable angina. However, there has not been a systematic evaluation of individual or combination antianginal drug therapy on hard clinical end points in patients with stable angina. Most revascularization trials that have evaluated treatment with CABGS, PTCA, or PCI in patients with chronic CAD and stable angina have not shown significant improvement in survival or decreased incidence of non-fatal MI compared to medical treatment. In the CABGS trials, various post-hoc analyses have identified several smaller subgroups at high-risk in whom CABGS might improve clinical outcomes. However, there are conflicting findings in different reports and these findings are further compromised due to the heterogeneous groups of patients in these trials. Moreover, no prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) has confirmed an advantage of CABGS, compared to medical treatment, in reduction of hard clinical outcomes in any of the high-risk subgroups. Based on the available data, it appears reasonable to conclude that for most patients (except perhaps in those with presence of left main disease > 50% stenosis) there is no apparent survival benefit of CABGS compared to medical therapy in stable CAD patients with angina. Although these trial have reported better symptom control associated with the revascularization intervention in most patients, this has not been adequately compared using modern medical therapies. Available data from recent studies also suggest treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), a statin and a regular exercise regimen in patients with stable CAD and angina pectoris.",

The 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST segment elevation in DII, DIII, aVF, V5 and V6, and depression in DI, aVL, V2 and V3. Echocardiographic imaging monitoring showed dyskinesia of inferior septum and akinesia of inferior wall. The test was interrupted immediately. The patient was medicated and improved her precordial pain condition as well as wall motion abnormalities.

    "165": "Oxidative stress might exert deleterious cardiovascular effects. The aim of the present study was to compare the antioxidative effects of carvedilol and atenolol. Levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ox-LDL), vitamin E, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured. In a prospective, open, and end-point-blinded study, 232 patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were randomized to receive either carvedilol or atenolol at equipotent doses, and the previously mentioned 3 parameters were measured at baseline and after 12 months of active treatment, with changes during the study period being compared both within and between the groups. Ox-LDL decreased in both treatment modalities, from 40.5 +/- 15.6 to 35.0 +/- 13.8 U/L, P = 0.0001, in the carvedilol group and from 40.3 +/- 16.5 to 37.4 +/- 13.1 U/L, P = 0.044, in the atenolol group, with a significant between-group difference in the changes (P = 0.036). The levels of vitamin E did not change during carvedilol treatment (31.0 +/- 10.2 vs 31.7 +/- 11.1 micromol/L), but it decreased marginally in the atenolol group (30.8 +/- 12.1 vs 27.2 +/- 9.1 micromol/L, P = 0.056), with a significant between-group difference (P = 0.008). No significant change in TBARS was observed between the carvedilol and atenolol groups (P = 0.454). These results indicate that carvedilol has a more pronounced antioxidative effect than atenolol in post-AMI patients, which might be of clinical importance.",

    "167": "Aortic root dilatation is the principal life-threatening complication in Marfan syndrome, leading to aortic regurgitation, dissection, and rupture. Beta blockade slows aortic dilatation in adults, but there has been no definitive evidence in children. Therefore, the evolution of aortic diameter at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva in 155 children (82 males, 73 females) aged <12 years who had been diagnosed with Marfan syndrome according to international criteria was retrospectively studied. Affected children treated by beta blockade >or=1 time during their lives (n = 77, mean age at diagnosis 6.1 +/- 3.2 years) were compared with affected children who had never received beta blockers (n = 78; 42 males, mean age 7.4 +/- 5.2 years). A mean delay of 1.3 years was observed between diagnosis and the initiation of beta blockade in the treated group (mean age at initiation 7.5 years). At the time of diagnosis, aortic diameters were similar in the 2 groups, but after 1.3 years, aortic diameters were greater in the group of children in whom beta blockers had been initiated. On univariate analysis, aortic diameter was related to age and height, but not gender or familial history of aortic dissection. On multivariate analysis, treatment and age remained significant determinants of aortic diameter. Beta blockade significantly decreased the rate of aortic dilatation at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva by a mean of 0.16 mm/year (p <0.05), an effect that increased with treatment duration. A trend toward lower cardiac mortality, decreased need for preventive aortic surgery, and less dissection was observed. In conclusion, beta blockade appears to limit aortic dilatation during childhood in patients affected by Marfan syndrome. Therefore, this treatment should be recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made.", 
    "168": "There is an increasing need for nasal drug delivery systems that could improve the efficiency of the direct nose to brain pathway especially for drugs for treatment of central nervous system disorders. Novel approaches that are able to combine active targeting of a formulation to the olfactory region with controlled release bioadhesive characteristics, for maintaining the drug on the absorption site are suggested. If necessary an absorption enhancer could be incorporated. Low methylated pectins have been shown to gel and be retained in the nasal cavity after deposition. Chitosan is known to be bioadhesive and also to work as an absorption enhancer. Consequently, two types of pectins, LM-5 and LM-12, together with chitosan G210, were selected for characterisation in terms of molecular weight, gelling ability and viscosity. Furthermore, studies on the in vitro release of model drugs from candidate formulations and the transport of drugs across MDCK1 cell monolayers in the presence of pectin and chitosan were also performed. Bioadhesive formulations providing controlled release with increased or decreased epithelial transport were developed. Due to their promising characteristics 3% LM-5, 1% LM-12 pectin and 1% chitosan G210 formulations were selected for further biological evaluation in animal models.", 
    "169": "The mechanism(s) by which glucose regulates glucagon secretion both acutely and in the longer term remain unclear. Added to isolated mouse islets in the presence of 0.5 mmol/l glucose, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibited glucagon release to a similar extent (46%) as 10 mmol/l glucose (55%), and the selective GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) antagonist SR95531 substantially reversed the inhibition of glucagon release by high glucose. GABA(A)R alpha4, beta3, and gamma2 subunit mRNAs were detected in mouse islets and clonal alphaTC1-9 cells, and immunocytochemistry confirmed the presence of GABA(A)Rs at the plasma membrane of primary alpha-cells. Glucose dose-dependently increased GABA(A)R expression in both islets and alphaTC1-9 cells such that mRNA levels at 16 mmol/l glucose were approximately 3.0-fold (alpha4), 2.0-fold (beta3), or 1.5-fold (gamma2) higher than at basal glucose concentrations (2.5 or 1.0 mmol/l, respectively). These effects were mimicked by depolarizing concentrations of K(+) and reversed by the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nimodipine. We conclude that 1) release of GABA from neighboring beta-cells contributes substantially to the acute inhibition of glucagon secretion from mouse islets by glucose and 2) that changes in GABA(A)R expression, mediated by changes in intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration, may modulate this response in the long term.", 
    "170": "One of the potential mechanisms to explain the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is imbalance of autonomic nervous system tone. The myocardium is innervated not only by cholinergic and adrenergic nerves but also by peptidergic nerves that synthesize and secrete neuropeptides. To investigate the possible role of cardiac neuropeptides in the development of AF after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), we analyzed the plasma levels of substance P (SubP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and angiotensin II (Ang II) in patients who underwent elective on-pump CABG.", 
    "171": "This prospective study group included 83 consecutive patients scheduled for elective, on-pump CABG. Depressed left ventricular (LV) function (ejection fraction [EF] less than 0.30), concomitant cardiac procedures, history of atrial fibrillation, second or third degree atrioventricular block, implanted pacemaker, postoperative myocardial infarction, use of class I or III antiarrhythmic drug, and hemodynamic deterioration were exclusion criteria. Preoperative and postoperative serum levels of SubP, NPY, and AngII were measured by radioimmunoassay technique.",

Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, only a decrease in SubP level (odds ratio [OR] = 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.767 to 0.99, p = 0.031) and an increase in AngII level (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.002 to 1.021, p = 0.023) after CABG were found to be independently associated with AF. Increased age (p = 0.02), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.023), preoperative use of beta blocker (p = 0.024), proximal right coronary artery involvement (p = 0.024), low preoperative sodium levels (p = 0.023), low LVEF (p = 0.013), and increased mitral E wave deceleration time (p = 0.044) were also associated with AF.",

    "174": "We have recently demonstrated that s.c.-injected 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) induces nociception by an indirect action on the primary afferent nociceptor in addition to its previously described direct action. Although the mechanisms mediating hyperalgesia can be quite separate and distinct from those mediating nociception, the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that 5-HT induces mechanical hyperalgesia by mechanisms similar to those mediating nociception. s.c. injection of 5-HT induced a dose-dependent mechanical hyperalgesia measured by the mechanical paw withdrawal nociceptive threshold test in the rat. 5-HT-induced hyperalgesia was significantly reduced by local blockade of the 5-HT(3) receptor by tropisetron, by the nonspecific selectin inhibitor fucoidan, by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, by guanethidine depletion of norepinephrine in the sympathetic terminals, and by local blockade of the beta(1)- or beta(2)-adrenergic receptor by atenolol or ICI 118,551, respectively. Taken together, these findings indicate that like nociception, hyperalgesia induced by the injection of 5-HT in the s.c. tissue is also mediated by an indirect action of 5-HT on the primary afferent nociceptor. This indirect hyperalgesic action of 5-HT is mediated by a combination of mechanisms involved in inflammation such as neutrophil migration and the local release of prostaglandin and norepinephrine. However, in contrast to nociception, hyperalgesia induced by 5-HT in the s.c. tissue is mediated by a norepinephrine-dependent mechanism that involves the activation of peripheral beta(2) adrenoceptors.",

    "179": "Renin secretion and synthesis in renal juxtaglomerular cells are controlled by short feed back loops involving angiotensin II and the intrarenal blood pressure. The operating mechanisms of these negative feed back regulators are widely unknown, except for the fact that both require calcium to exert their inhibitory action. We here show that in the absence of connexin40 (Cx40), which form gap junctions between juxtaglomerular and endothelial cells, the negative control of renin secretion and synthesis by angiotensin II and by intravasal pressure is abrogated, while the regulation by salt intake and beta-adrenergic stimulation is maintained. Renin secretion from Cx40-deficient kidneys or wild-type kidneys treated with the nonselective gap junction blocker 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid (10 micromol/L) resembles the situation in wild-type kidneys in the absence of extracellular calcium. This disturbed regulation is reflected by an enhanced plasma renin concentration despite an elevated blood pressure in Cx40-deficient mice. These findings indicate that Cx40 connexins and likely intercellular communication via Cx40-dependent gap junctions mediate the calcium-dependent inhibitor effects of angiotensin II and of intrarenal pressure on renin secretion and synthesis. Because Cx40 gap junctions are also formed between renin producing cells and endothelial cells our finding could provide additional information to suggest that the endothelium may be strongly involved in the control of the renin system.", 
    "180": "Relatively small changes in G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 3 expression (approximately 2-fold) profoundly affect alpha2-adrenergic receptor (AR) function and preferentially regulate neuronal alpha2A- and alpha2B-AR signaling. In the present study, we provide evidence that epinephrine (EPI)-induced up-regulation of GRK3 protein expression in two neuronal cell lines, BE(2)-C cells (endogenously express alpha2A- and beta2AR) and BN17 cells [endogenously express alpha2B (NG108) and transfected to express beta2-AR] is due in part to increased GRK3 gene expression. In both cell lines, the increase in GRK3 transcription occurred via an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2-dependent mechanism because the increase in GRK3 mRNA is eliminated in the presence of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1/2 inhibitor, U0126 [1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis (2-amino phenylthiobutadiene)]. EPI-induced GRK3 mRNA up-regulation also is prevented in the presence of propranolol or phentolamine. Moreover, GRK3 mRNA did not increase in response to EPI treatment in NG108 cells (endogenously express alpha2B-AR with no beta2-AR). Both these results suggest that simultaneous activation of alpha2- and beta2-AR by EPI is required for the ERK1/2-dependent increase in GRK3 mRNA. The EPI-induced increase in GRK3 mRNA was unaffected in the presence of the protein kinase C inhibitor, chelerythrine chloride. Finally, EPI treatment resulted in increased nuclear translocation and accumulation of the transcription factors, Sp-1 and Ap-2, in BE(2)-C cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate the involvement of the ERK1/2 pathway in selective up-regulation of GRK3 mRNA expression, possibly via activation of Sp-1 and Ap-2 transcription factors in neuronal cells.",

We therefore studied effects of AIs including the steroidal AI, exemestane (EXE), and non-steroidal AIs, Aromatase Inhibitor I (AI-I) and aminoglutethimide (AGM), on a human osteoblast. We employed a human osteoblast cell line, hFOB, which maintains relatively physiological status of estrogen and androgen pathways of human osteoblasts, i.e., expression of aromatase, androgen receptor (AR), and estrogen receptor (ER) beta. We also employed osteoblast-like cell lines, Saos-2 and MG-63 which expressed aromatase, AR, and ERalpha/beta in order to further evaluate the mechanisms of effects of AIs on osteoblasts. There was a significant increment in the number of the cells following 72 h treatment with EXE in hFOB and Saos-2 but not in MG-63, in which the level of AR mRNA was lower than that in hFOB and Saos-2. Alkaline phosphatase activity was also increased by EXE treatment in hFOB and Saos-2. Pretreatment with the AR blocker, flutamide, partially inhibited the effect of EXE. AI-I exerted no effects on osteoblast cell proliferation and AGM diminished the number of the cells. hFOB converted androstenedione into E2 and testosterone (TST). Both EXE and AI-I decreased E2 level and increased TST level. In a microarray analysis, gene profile patterns following treatment with EXE demonstrated similar patterns as with DHT but not with E2 treatment. The genes induced by EXE treatment were related to cell proliferation, differentiation which includes genes encoding cytoskeleton proteins. We also examined the expression levels of these genes using quantitative RT-PCR in hFOB and Saos-2 treated with EXE and DHT and with/without flutamide. HOXD11 gene known as bone morphogenesis factor and osteoblast growth-related genes were induced by EXE treatment as well as DHT treatment in both hFOB and Saos-2. These results indicated that the steroidal aromatase inhibitor, EXE, stimulated hFOB cell proliferation via both AR dependent and independent pathways.", 
    "182": "Exercise increases AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) activity in human and rat adipocytes, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of this activation are not known. Since adrenaline (epinephrine) concentrations increase with exercise, in the present study we hypothesized that adrenaline activates AMPK in adipocytes. We show that a single bout of exercise increases AMPKalpha1 and alpha2 activities and ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) Ser79 phosphorylation in rat adipocytes. Similarly to exercise, adrenaline treatment in vivo increased AMPK activities and ACC phosphorylation. Pre-treatment of rats with the beta-blocker propranolol fully blocked exercise-induced AMPK activation. Increased AMPK activity with exercise and adrenaline treatment in vivo was accompanied by an increased AMP/ATP ratio. Adrenaline incubation of isolated adipocytes also increased the AMP/ATP ratio and AMPK activities, an effect blocked by propranolol. Adrenaline incubation increased lipolysis in isolated adipocytes, and Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, attenuated this effect. Finally, a potential role for AMPK in the decreased adiposity associated with chronic exercise was suggested by marked increases in AMPKalpha1 and alpha2 activities in adipocytes from rats trained for 6 weeks. In conclusion, both acute and chronic exercise are significant regulators of AMPK activity in rat adipocytes. Our findings suggest that adrenaline plays a critical role in exercise-stimulated AMPKalpha1 and alpha2 activities in adipocytes, and that AMPK can function in the regulation of lipolysis."
