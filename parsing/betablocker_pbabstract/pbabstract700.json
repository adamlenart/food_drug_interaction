Furthermore, there is widespread illicit use of psychoactive drugs, including narcotics, psychostimulants, and central nervous system depressants. All of these agents have potent effects on the cardiovascular system and, in addition, may undergo numerous drug-drug interactions with cardiovascular medications. Given the high incidence of both cardiovascular disease and psychoactive drug use in the United States, it is likely that clinicians manage many patients with cardiovascular disease, possible receiving cardiovascular medications, and also needing psychopharmacological interventions. Consequently, the authors have reviewed the pharmacology of the major classes of psychoactive agents: (I & II) Antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors); (III) Lithium Carbonate; (IV) Major Tranquilizers (phenothiazines, thioxanthines, butyrophenones, reserpine); and (V) Minor tranquilizers, Sedatives, and Hypnotics (benzodiazepines and barbiturates) with respect to their cardiotoxicity, cardiovascular side effects, and drug-drug interactions. Management of the cardiovascular complications of psychotropic overdose is discussed, as well as potential therapeutic uses of psychopharmacological medications in patients with cardiovascular pathology.", 
    "1": "We have applied a new method for quantitative measurement of bronchial beta adrenoceptor blockade to a new beta adrenoceptor antagonist, bevantolol. Dose-response curves to a beta agonist, albuterol, were obtained in six normal subjects by measuring specific airway conductance (sGaw) after increasing doses of inhaled albuterol. These were repeated on three separate occasions 2 hr after subjects had taken oral placebo or bevantolol (75 or 150 mg), double-blind in random order. The dose-response curves after bevantolol 75 mg were displaced in the right of placebo in four subjects and after 150 mg were displaced to the right of placebo in all subjects. The mean dose ratios for bevantolol 75 or 150 mg were 1.02 and 2.77, much the same as those obtained in the same subjects after practolol 100 and 200 mg and considerably less than that after propranolol 40 mg. The mean reductions in exercise heart rate were 25% and 29% after bevantolol 75 and 150 mg. Our data show that bronchial beta blockade after a beta blocking drug can be assessed quantitatively in many by a double-blind technique.", 
    "2": "The contribution of released epinephrine and norepinephrine to the pressor response induced by i.v. injected angiotensin II was assessed in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Control pressor dose-response curves for i.v. angiotensin II were obtained in dogs pretreated with hexamethonium, atropine and practolol. Hexamethonium and atropine minimized the cardiovascular reflex responses elicited by the pressor action of angiotensin II which would preclude interpretation of the results. Practolol was administered to antagonize indirect cardiac stimulation selectively through sympathoadrenal activation by angiotensin II. Three additional pressor dose-response curves for angiotensin II were obtained in each dog. The second dose-response curve was obtained after the administration of phentolamine and the third dose-response curve was obtained after the subsequent administration of sotalol. The final dose-response curve was obtained after partial recovery of the pressor responsiveness to norepinephrine and epinephrine from phentolamine blockade. The pressor responses for angiotensin II after phentolamine and sotalol (curve 3) were significantly smaller than those in the control dose-response curve (curve 1). No significant differences in the pressor responses to angiotensin II were noted after phentolamine when compared with those obtained after phentolamine plus sotalol (curve 2 vs. curve 3). The angiotensin II pressor responses after partial recovery from phentolamine (curve 4) did not differ significantly from those obtained in the control dose-response curve. These results of released catecholamines mediated through alpha adrenergic receptors in the pressor response to angiotensin II.", 
    "3": "Ocular tension of cats was measured after topical administration of the selective beta 1-adrenergic agonist CGP 7760B, the selective beta 1-adrenergic antagonist atenolol, the selective beta 2-adrenergic agonist salbutamol, the selective beta 2-adrenergic antagonist H 35/25, and the mixed beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic antagonist timolol. Although atenolol did not alter intraocular pressure, CGP 7760B produced a modest decrease amounting to 3 to 4 mm Hg. Salbutamol, H 35/25, and timolol each produced a dose-dependent lowering of ocular tension, with maximal reductions amounting to 7, 5, and 5 mm Hg, respectively. Sympathetically denervated cat eyes showed supersensitivity to the pressure-lowering effect of salbutamol. In contrast, sympathectomy markedly reduced the effects of H 35/25 and timolol on ocular tension. Eyes rendered subsensitive to the pressure-lowering effects of cholinomimetics by chronic echothiophate treatment likewise showed diminished responsiveness to H 35/25 and timolol. Pretreatment with timolol (3 hr) completely abolished the pressure-lowering effect of salbutamol, and pretreatment with atenolol likewise completely antagonized the effect of CGP 7760B. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic receptors in the anterior segment of the cat eye are predominantly beta 2. Although beta-adrenergic antagonists apparently exert their effects on ocular tension by action at beta-adrenergic receptors, a cholinergic mechanism may be involved as well.", 
    "4": "Minoxidil is an orally active vasodilator for treatment of severe hypertension. In combination with diuretics and beta-adrenergic blocking agents, it is effective treatment for more than 80% of patients whose blood pressure has been inadequately controlled with combinations of other been inadequately controlled with combinations of other antihypertensive drugs. Major adverse reactions include reflex activation of the adrenergic nervous system, renal sodium retention, and hypertrichosis. Despite the possibility of adverse reactions, minoxidil is indicated in patients whose blood pressure cannot be controlled with conventional therapy, in persons with major adverse reactions to other drugs, and in patients who are candidates for bilateral nephrectomy for control of hypertension.", 
    "5": "The thirst mechanism by carbamylcholine and the possible interactions with the renin-angiotensin system have been investigated. Rats placed in metabolic cages in order to measure the drunk water and the emitted urine were used. Carbamylcholine has been injected together with captopril, an inhibitor of the enzyme converting angiotensin I into angiotensin II, and with propranolol, which blocks the renin beta-receptors respectively. When given in combination with these substances, the thirst by carbamylcholine was not reduced; this result does not favour the hypothesis of a role of the renin-angiotensin system. On the contrary, the thirst by carbamylcholine seems to be due to a vasomotor action. These results confirm the hypothesis that an unbalance between the blood circulating mass and the venous vessels underlies the regulation of the thirst.", 
    "6": "Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with differential pulse polarographic detection at a dropping mercury electrode provides a high degree of specificity for stability-indicating assays of drugs in animal feed. The selectivity of this detection system is demonstrated in the assay of diacetolol in feed at concentrations down to 50 microgram/g.", 
    "7": "26 patients with severe hypertension (10 essential, 9 renal parenchymatous, 7 renovascular) and a mean age of 42 years were treated with the new oral converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (SQ 14225). During the initial phase with a standardized triple therapy (STT) consisting of propranolol (maximum 320 mg/day), hydralazine (maximum 200 mg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide (maximum 100 mg/day) or furosemide (maximum 250 mg/day) mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values remained almost unchanged (184 +/- 32/111 +/- 17 mm Hg to 179 +/- 34/112 +/- 19 mm Hg), indicating true therapy resistance to conventional antihypertensive therapy. After discontinuing each antihypertensive agent captopril was then titrated from 3 X 25 mg/day to a maximum of 4 X 150 mg/day. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks after starting captopril were 154/95, 155/97, 149/93 and 143/91 mm Hg. The corresponding mean captopril doses were 242, 280, 325 and 299 mg daily. During captopril medication mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were significantly lower (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.005) than during STT. Throughout the observation period of 16 weeks only 15% of the cases were on monotherapy with captopril whereas 62% needed the addition of a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide). In 23% of the cases even the combination of captopril and diuretic was insufficient and thus propranolol was added as a third drug. The side effects observed were 1 case with renal water and fluid retention and with reversible skin rash and 1 with pruritus. The results demonstrate that captopril has good blood pressure lowering activity in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. However, in the majority of our cases the addition of a diuretic was necessary. Finally, some patients required a beta-blocker as a third drug.", 
    "8": "Beta-blockers are valuable agents in the treatment of hypertension, being useful at all stages of hypertension except when heart failure is present. They are usually the first choice of therapy in younger patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In elderly or Black patients, added diuretic therapy is essential. Otherwise diuretic therapy is only added if beta-blockade alone is unsuccessful, as it will be in 30-50% of patients. Requirements for an ideal beta-blocker are stated. Costs of currently available beta-blockers are given. The prices of some compare well with those of vasodilators, but thiazide diuretics are much cheaper. Centrally acting agents tend to fall into an intermediate price range. Beta-blockers cannot be prescribed without prior enquiry into a history of asthma (an absolute contraindication) or bronchospasm (an indication for a cardioselective agent), nor without examination of the heart and lungs of the patient.", 
    "9": "18 male patients under betablocker therapy adapted to their individual stage of hypersympathicotonic circulatory regulation disturbances were tested in a motor-vehicle simulator to find out possible changes of their driving ability. Besides observing driving-style and reactions, the following parameters were controlled: blood pressure, time of pulse waves, heart rate. Speeds of deviation angles (= deviation from straight line per time unit) decreased significantly. No differences between tests under betablocker medication and without it could be demonstrated, neither in simple-reaction times nor in the more complex multiple-reaction times, which can be compared with realistic traffic situations. Blood pressure and heart rate showed more significant decreases after medication than in tests without previous betablocker treatment. The results prove that the betablocking agent Bupranolol does not influence the ability of car-driving, not even in case of semichronical application.", 
    "10": "The effect of oxotremorine was studied on the concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylglycol (MHPG) in the corpus striatum of rats. At a dose of 1 mg/kg oxotremorine increased HVA levels by 68% and MHPG, by 51%. MHPG was also increased in the nucl. accumbens (58%) and neocortex (42%). Pretreatment with clonidine, 0.1 mg/kg abolished the increase in MHPG in the striatum and significantly inhibited the rise in HVA. 1-Propranolol 2.5 mg/kg, but not d-propranolol, had an effect similar to that of clonidine. A lower dose of oxotremorine (0.5 mg/kg) increased striatal HVA by 36% but did not alter MHPG levels. This increase in HVA was not reduced by 1-propranolol. Eight days after bilateral lesions of the locus coeruleus, there was a reduction in the basal concentrations of noradrenaline (41%) and MHPG (57%) in the striatum. The data suggest that at higher doses of oxotremorine (1 mg/kg), but not a lower dose (0.5 mg/kg), a noradrenergic pathway is stimulated to increase the rate of metabolism of noradrenaline in the striatum. Oxotremorine also appears to increase dopamine metabolism in the striatum by at least two separate mechanisms, one of which involves the mediation of noradrenaline.", 
    "11": "The mitral valve prolapse syndrome may present with a variety of clinical manifestations and has proved to be a common cause of nonspecific cardiac symptoms in clinical practice. Primary and secondary forms must be distinguished. Myxomatous degeneration appears to be the common denominator of the primary form. The diagnostic standard of this form has not previously been defined because the detection of mitral leaflet tissue in the left atrium (prolapse) on physical examination or angiography is nonspecific. M mode echocardiography has greatly enhanced the recognition of this syndrome but has not proved to be the best diagnostic standard because of its limited view of mitral valve motion. The advent of two dimensional echocardiography has provided the potential means for specific identification of the mitral leaflet motion in systole and can be considered the diagnostic standard for this syndrome. Primary myxomatous degeneration with leaflet prolapse is not localized to the mitral valve. Two dimensional echocardiography has detected in preliminary studies tricuspid valve prolapse in up to 50 percent and aortic valve prolapse in about 20 percent of patients with idiopathic mitral valve prolapse.", 
    "12": "In 37 patients with essential hypertension (WHO-stage I and II) ergometric examinations with submaximum stress were performed in sitting position for the judgement of the behaviour of heart rate and blood pressure (control group 20 clinically healthy persons). On account of the different behaviour of the heart rate the patients could be subdivided into 4 groups: A: normal heart rate in rest and under stress. B: heart rate increased only under stress. C: heart rate increased already in rest. Group D consisted of patients with hypertensive disturbance of the regulation (normal blood pressure immediately before ergometry). In 12 of the patients were also performed ergometric examinations under therapy: in group A the combined use of beta-receptor blocker and saluretic was necessary, in the groups B, C and D monotherapy with beta-receptor blocker was sufficient. The opinion is uttered that an abundant increase of blood pressure under stress in anamnestically known increased values of blood pressure in rest is also an indication to therapy as the appearance of very varying and on an average occasionally increased blood pressure values. In group A (normal regulation of frequency) by the beta-receptor blocker alone as a rule no sufficient effect is expected, the combination with a saluretic is necessary. In the other groups apart from the regulation of the blood pressure also the regulation of the heart rate is disturbed (among others reduction of the vagal inhibition of the heart, lack of training) and apart from the medicamentous therapy with beta-receptor blockers also a physical training is to be recommended. The different patterns of reaction which were to be proved by means of ergometry in patients with hypertension may in most cases be supposed already by the observation of the course and thus be included in the consideration concerning the differential therapy.", 
    "13": "Nitroglycerin (0.8 mg p. o.) improves exercise hemodynamics in patients with coronary heart disease by normalizing left ventricular filling pressure and elevating volume output. Exercise heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure remain unchanged. Pretreatment with a beta-receptor-blocker (Mepindolol) and the combination of beta-receptor-blocker (Oxprenolol) with a calcium-antagonist (Fendiline) reduces the efficacy of nitroglycerin. The effects of the underlying treatment on the ventricular function curve shifting rightwards are not antagonized by nitroglycerin.", 
    "14": "Prostaglandin (PG) release was measured from the isolated perfused rabbit heart. The effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation and blockade suggest that PG synthesis is regulated in part by adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "15": "The arterial blood pressure, heart rate and systolic time intervals were measured in 10 male tetraplegic subjects before and during the filling of the bladder with sterile normal saline. This procedure was repeated on separate occasions after pretreatment of the patients with blocking dosages of propranolol, labetalol, phenoxybenzamine and guanethidine respectively. During hyperreflexia the pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time (PEP/LVET) ratio and the PEP and electromechanical systole (QS2) reduced, suggesting positive inotropic effects. Propranolol practically eliminated these effects and labetalol also opposed them. The effects of phenoxybenzamine and guanethidine were unpredictable.", 
    "16": "This study investigated the first-pass effect (E) and total hepatic intrinsic clearance (Clint) of propranolol and pindolol by means of an isolated rat liver perfusion model. It was shown that propranolol has a highly significantly greater E and Clint than pindolol. These marked differences between the drugs may be accounted for by the strong initial binding of propranolol to liver sites, a phenomenon possibly related to the greater lipid solubility of propranolol compared with pindolol.", 
    "17": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of bufuralol, a benzofuran analogue, in plasma is described. The unchanged drug, the major metabolites and an internal standard are extracted from plasma, purified by back-extraction steps and thereafter separated using a reversed-phase liquid chromatographic system. The detection is carried out by means of a fluorescence detector and an UV detector connected in series. The sensitivity of the assay for the unchanged drug and the major metabolite is about 1 ng/ml plasma using a 0.5 ml specimen per analysis and the relative standard deviation of the whole assay lies in the range +/- 4-5%. The procedure was successfully used to determine plasma levels in volunteers following a single oral dose of 40 mg of bufuralol. The results obtained using the new high-performance liquid chromatographic method were compared with those determined by another method which combines gas chromatography with mass fragmentography, and it was found that these two sets of results coincided quite well.", 
    "18": "The presence of both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in liver designated the hepatic plasma membrane as a useful tool for the elucidation of the mechanisms by which the hormonal signal is transferred through the membrane via a coupling system to an amplifying entity. This process is well documented for the beta-adrenergic receptor which is linked to adenylate cyclase, whereby it modulates the cyclic AMP level. Much less is known about the alpha-adrenergic receptor. Recently, two factors have contributed to a renewed interest in alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in liver: i) The fact that activation of glycogenolysis in isolated liver parenchymal cells by epinephrine may be mediated by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors, depending on the species or on the state of nutrition, and not only by beta-adrenergic receptors as previously thought. ii) The existence of specific adrenergic agonists and antagonists radiolabeled to a high specific activity which has permitted the characterization of adrenergic receptors in terms of nature, number, affinity and regulation. The present review will be devoted to the recent progress made in the physiological, pharmacological and biochemical characterization of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in the liver.", 
    "19": "Antisera against acebutolol were produced in rabbits immunized by means of this drug conjugated with bovine serum albumin. These antisera were used to develop a method of radioimmunoassay for acebutolol. The plasma radioimmunoassay, described here, requires no extraction and is very easy to perform besides being quick, specific and sensitive. As little as 2.97 X 10(-9) mol/l of acebutolol can be detected. This radioimmunoassay is suitable for assaying the large number of samples usually measured in pharmacological studies.", 
    "20": "The oxidative metabolic activity of restricted regions of hippocampal slices was assessed by a continuous measurement of the fluorescence of intramitochondrial nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH). A large increase in NADH fluorescence was triggered by substituting the oxygen supply to the slice by nitrogen gas. A large and transient increase in NADH fluorescence was also produced by superfusion of the the slice with a high (50 mM) potassium-containing medium. Addition of norepinephrine (NE) to the superfusion medium caused a propranolol-inhibited increase in NADH fluorescence. Furthermore, ouabain, which inhibits the Na-K pump, blocked the effects of NE. An analog of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), 8-bromo cAMP, mimicked the effect of NE. Finally, effects of NE could still be produced in a kainic acid-treated hippocampus, where most neurons were previously destroyed by the drug. It is suggested that NE activates a Na-K-ATPase, that this effect might be mediated by cAMP, and that these interrelations may underly the physiological action of NE in the brain.", 
    "21": "[3H]Quinuclydinyl benzylate ([3H]QNB) binding was carried out on crude synaptosomal membranes isolated from cat cerebral cortex. The specific binding showed a single type of site with KD 0.25 nM, Hill number 0.89 and Bmax 114 pmol/g protein. The local anesthetics procaine, tetracaine and dibucaine, and the adrenergic antagonists phentolamine and propranolol, in concentrations between 1 nM and 500 microM, inhibited [3H]QNB binding with Ki varying between 9 microM for procaine and 80 microM for propranolol. The Hill coefficients obtained from logit/log plots suggested that there was no cooperativity between the binding sites for local anesthetics. At various concentrations the inhibition by procaine and propranolol may appear as competitive or non-competitive. The Hill numbers obtained from the saturation curves suggest that there was no cooperativity between anesthetics and [3H]QNB binding sites. Neither 1 mM Ca2+ nor Mg2+ affected [3H]QNB binding or the action of the drugs. The effect of local anesthetics and adrenergic antagonists was reversible and these drugs did not protect the muscarinic receptor from the deleterious effect of Triton X-100 as was the case with muscarinic agents. Our findings suggest that local anesthetics inhibit [3H]QNB binding to the muscarinic receptor by acting at some accessory site but not on the true receptor site. The possible mechanism of action and local anesthetics on synaptic transmission is discussed.", 
    "22": "The effect and tolerance of a single daily tablet of Tenormin 100 in the treatment of essential hypertension was investigated in a private practice multicenter trial. 4083 Patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (age range 15--89 years) were treated for four weeks. According to WHO criteria 83.4% of all patients were clearly hypertensive. At the end of the treatment 88.8% were under satisfactory control. The treatment was generally well tolerated. No hitherto unknown side effects occurred. The global therapeutic success rating, also taking into account the side effects, was confirmed mathematically and showed a success rate of 82% for Atenolol in this trial.", 
    "23": "Dose-response curves to noradrenaline in the presence and absence of beta-receptor antagonists were established with isolated atria from euthyroid, hypothyroid and hyperthyroid rats. Baseline atrial rate and Emax were significantly lower than normal in the hypothyroid group and significantly higher than normal in the hyperthyroid group. Differences between the groups were minimal for pD2 and range of response to noradrenaline. The response to beta-receptor antagonists was the same in all 3 groups with the exception of the hypothyroid group which showed an attenuated increase in baseline atrial rate with compounds possessing partial agonist activity. This was particularly marked for practolol. These results do not provide evidence for an altered responsiveness to catecholamines due to altered thyroid status but suggest that thyroid hormones have a direct action on cardiac tissue.", 
    "24": "1 Previous studies of propranolol disposition in renal failure have been conflicting. 2 Using simultaneous administration of [3H]-propranolol intravenously and unlabelled propranolol orally the principal determinants of drug distribution were calculated in normals, patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 14.5 +/- 2.8 ml/min) but not on haemodialysis and patients on haemodialysis (creatinine clearance less than 5 ml/min). 3 The effect of haemodialysis on propranolol binding and free fraction was also examined. The percentage of propranolol unbound rose from 7.1% to 9.9%. (P less than 0.001) 20 min following heparinization and beginning haemodialysis. This was accompanied by a large rise in free fatty acids from 0.567 +/- 0.059 to 3.326 +/- 0.691 mumol/ml (P less than 0.005). 4 The blood to plasma concentration ratios of propranolol were significantly higher in patients with renal failure (P less than 0.02) and on haemodialysis (P less than 0.001) and were significantly negatively correlated (P less than 0.001) with the haematocrit. 5 Although the half-life propranolol was significantly shortened in the patients with renal failure (P less than 0.02), there was no change in the apparent liver blood flow, extraction ratio or the principal determinants of steady-state drug concentrations in blood namely oral and intravenous clearance from blood. 6 There is, therefore, no pharmacokinetic basis to adjust the dosage of propranolol in patients with renal failure.", 
    "25": "The blood levels of propranolol in rats and dogs were compared after the administration of nasal, intravenous, and oral solutions. The results indicate that the blood drug levels after nasal and intravenous administration were identical, but the oral administration resulted in considerably lower blood levels. Sustained-release formulations of the drug also were administered nasally and resulted in low initial but prolonged blood levels. The bioavailability of the sustained-release formulation was identical to that of the intravenous administration.", 
    "26": "The autonomic regulation of heart rate was examined in 30 patients with symptoms of sinus node disease (SND) and 18 control subjects. Heart rate, expressed as sinus cycle length, was determined after injection of isoprenaline (0.1 microgram/kg), propranolol (0.1 mg/kg), and atropine (0.02 mg/kg); heart rate was also determined at maximal exercise and during carotid sinus stimulation. In addition, heart rate responses, expressed as the absolute change in sinus cycle length, were calculated. Mean heart rates after the applied maneuvers were all significantly different in the patient group, but so was the mean spontaneous heart rate. None of the induced changes differed significantly between the groups. Thus, although all these patients had impaired sinus node automaticity no uniform decrease in responsiveness to adrenergic or cholinergic stimulation or to inhibition of autonomic influences could be detected. The response patterns were heterogeneous, indicating diversity of the underlying mechanisms. No single heart rate reaction provided a satisfying diagnostic capacity for SND. However, the combined sensitivity of the three tests--isoprenaline stimulation, carotid sinus pressure, and autonomic inhibition--was 97% with a specificity of 50%. Clinically, normal findings in all these three tests, i.e., with resulting heart rates greater than 100, 55, and 70 beats/min, respectively, strongly suggest absence of SND.", 
    "27": "1. The central noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus seems to participate in arousal reactions and cardiovascular modulation. Using single cell recording techniques and biochemical assays, we have studied locus coeruleus neuronal regulation and its interaction with antihypertensive treatments. 2. Acute (5 microgram/kg intravenously) or chronic clonidine treatment (2 microgram/ml in drinking water for 2 weeks) significantly reduced locus coeruleus neuronal activity, probably via activation of alpha 2-receptors within the nucleus. Termination of the chronic regimen increased the noradrenaline cell firing rates above baseline, a finding possibly related to the withdrawal syndrome. 3. In spontaneously hypertensive rats the activation of locus coeruleus neurons by yohimbine, an alpha 2-receptor antagonist, was increased compared with that in normotensive (Wistar-Kyoto) control rats, implying an altered alpha 2-receptor-mediated control of the central noradrenaline neurons. 4. Chronic treatment with DL-propranolol (5 or 10 mg/kg daily for 1 week) but not D-propranolol or acutely given DL-propranolol significantly reduced neuronal activity in the locus coeruleus, an effect which may relate to mental and cardiovascular actions of beta-receptor-blocking drugs. 5. In contrast, chronically given salbutamol, a beta 2-receptor agonist (5 mg/kg subcutaneously for 2 weeks), increased brain noradrenaline utilization. Thus beta-receptors probably participate in the control of brain noradrenaline neurons.", 
    "28": "1. Fifty-five patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were admitted to hospital, where 25 of them were treated with propranolol (average daily dose 240 mg) and 30 were left untreated. 2. In all of them renal arteriography was carried out, after which procedure renal plasma flow ([125I]hippuran clearance), cortical blood flow (xenon washout) and renal noradrenaline release were measured. 3. Compared with the untreated hypertensive patients, responders to propranolol (mean blood pressure less than or equal to 110 mmHg) during treatment showed enhanced cortical blood flow and reduced noradrenaline secretion. Non-responders had reduced cortical flow rates, but increased noradrenaline secretion. 4. Both in the untreated group and in the propranolol-treated group an inverse relationship between arterial noradrenaline concentration and cortical blood flow was found. 5. The results indicate that sympathetic activity may be an important determinant of renal blood flow in hypertension. The effectiveness of propranolol seems to depend upon a reduction in alpha-adrenergic tone.", 
    "29": "1. Atenolol (100 mg/day) was given to 12 hypertensive patients for 8 weeks, and its effects on mean arterial pressure, cardiac index and ejection phase indices of myocardial performance were examined by echocardiography. 2. Echocardiographic studies were made before treatment after 4 weeks on placebo and repeated after 4 and 8 weeks of atenolol therapy. Mean arterial pressure fell by 14 and 21% after 4 and 8 weeks respectively. Cardiac index fell by 22 and 20%, and stoke index fell by 11 and 7%. Calculated peripheral resistance did not change significantly. 3. Ejection phase indices, namely fractional shortening, ejection fraction and normalized mean rate of circumferential fibre shortening, did not change. End-diastolic volume index did not change and there was no relationship between changes in heart rate and end-diastolic volume index. 4. The study shows that atenolol in the resting state has no effect on certain echocardiographic indices of left ventricular function when given orally to hypertensive patients with normal left ventricular size and function. The reduction in cardiac and stroke indices were presumably secondary to a decrease in cardiac venous filling.", 
    "30": "1. Dose-response curves for heart rate, cardiac output, arterial blood pressure and pulmonary artery pressure were obtained in 16 male patients after intravenous administration of three increasing doses of pindolol, propranolol or placebo. All patients had an uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction 6-8 months earlier. 2. The dose-response curves were obtained at rest and during repeated bouts of supine bicycle exercise. The cumulative dose amounted to 0.024 mg/kg body weight for pindolol and to 0.192 mg/kg body weight for propranolol. 3. At rest propranolol significantly reduced heart rate and cardiac output by 12% and 15% respectively. Arterial mean blood pressure was reduced by 9.2 mmHg. Mean pulmonary artery pressure increased significantly by 2 mmHg. Statistically significant changes in these variables were not seen after pindolol or placebo. 4. During exercise pindolol and propranolol both reduced cardiac output, heart rate and arterial blood pressure to the same extent. After propranolol mean pulmonary artery pressure was increased significantly by 3.6 mmHg. Pindolol and placebo did not change pulmonary artery pressure significantly. 5. The study suggests that pindolol may offer haemodynamic advantages over beta-receptor-blocking agents without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity during low activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and may be preferable in situations where the beta-receptor-blocking effect is required only during physical or psychic stress.", 
    "31": "1. Sixteen neurosurgical patients received (oral) beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agents (beta-receptor blockers) for 3-22 days. 2. Lipophilic beta-receptor blockers (propranolol) and metoprolol appeared in cerebrospinal fluid at concentrations similar to the free drug plasma concentration. 3. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of beta-receptor blockers were poor predictors of brain concentrations. 4. Both lipophilic beta-receptor blockers appeared in high concentrations in the brain: the brain/plasma ratio was approximately 15:1. 5. Hydrophilic atenolol appeared at low concentrations in brain tissue (about 20 times lower than the lipophilic beta-receptor blockers): the brain/plasma ratio was approximately 0.1:1. 6. Central nervous system-related side effects associated mainly with lipophilic beta-receptor blockers possibly result from high brain tissue concentrations.", 
    "32": "1. Haemodynamic and left ventricular variables were determined by M-mode echocardiography in 21 normotensive and 36 hypertensive patients during the last trimester of pregnancy. 2. Blood pressure of hypertensive patients was lowered by bed rest only, or by oxprenolol or methyldopa, but remained elevated. 3. Cardiac output was raised in the last trimester of pregnancy in both normotensive and hypertensive patients. 4. Left ventricular mass was increased in normal pregnancy, but displayed an exaggerated increase in hypertensive patients. 5. Total peripheral resistance was inappropriately elevated in hypertensive pregnancy, except in the oxprenolol-treated group. 6. There ws no reduction in heart rate or cardiac output in the group treated with beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents. These factors, in combination with normal peripheral resistance, may contribute to the improvement in foetal outcome described in maternal hypertension of pregnancy treated with oxprenolol.", 
    "33": "1. Aortic compliance and plasma catecholamine levels were determined in 26 essential hypertensive patients: 14 < 45 years (group 1) and 12 > 45 years (group 2). 2. Aortic rigidity, the reciprocal of aortic compliance, was calculated by the ratio of pulse pressure to stroke volume. Pulse pressure was derived by arterial pressure measured in the ascending aorta. Stroke volume was obtained by dye dilution. 3. A significant correlation (r = 0.60) was found between aortic rigidity and plasma noradrenaline in group 2. In this group both aortic rigidity and plasma noradrenaline levels were consistently higher than in group 1. 4. In 15 patients (seven of group 1 and eight of group 2) aortic rigidity was again measured after acute phentolamine (five patients) and labetalol (ten patients) administration. 5. Aortic rigidity was reduced significantly after both alpha-adrenoreceptor blockade alone and combined alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor blockade. A highly significant correlation was found between aortic rigidity reduction and pretreatment noradrenaline levels (r = 0.77). 6. Aortic compliance is influenced, at least in part, by sympathetic nervous system activity. Drugs which block the peripheral effects of catecholamines may improve aortic compliance and consequently the control of systolic hypertension in selected cases.", 
    "34": "Regimens of once-a-day or twice-a-day 0.25% timolol ophthalmic solution were compared for efficacy and tolerability in a four-week study of 41 patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma and elevated, untreated intraocular pressure. Significant reductions in IOP relative to untreated baseline values were achieved within a range of 18% to 25%. No significant between-group differences were noted, although the twice-a-day group had somewhat lower IOPs at each evaluation point and the once-a-day group had somewhat fewer subjective symptoms of local irritation. A statistically significant decrease from baseline in mean pulse rate was noted in the twice-a-day treatment group after two weeks; no clinically significant or serious adverse reactions occurred in any patient. Both once-daily and twice-daily administrations of 0.25% timolol ophthalmic solution were found to be effective and well tolerated in the population studied.", 
    "35": "In a double-blind crossover study the beta-adrenergic blocking drug propranolol hydrochloride reduced symptoms in 17 of 26 patients with chronic anxiety disorders. Both somatic and psychic symptoms improved as judged by patient and observer ratings. The most frequent side effects (dizziness, fatigue, and insomnia) were difficult to distinguish from anxiety symptoms and were, for the most part, mild. The therapeutic and side effects observed suggested CNS activity of the drug. Although propranolol is of benefit to patients with anxiety, its efficacy, compared with that of other antianxiety drugs, has not been established.", 
    "36": "Effects of isometric contraction and catecholamines on glucose and glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle were investigated with the in vitro rat epitrochlearis preparation. Mechanical performance and glycogenolysis exhibited two phases. During the initial 30 min, muscle work was 30% greater and glycogenolysis 8- to 10-fold faster than the steady-state values in the subsequent 3-4 h of contraction. Glucose uptake was increased by contraction and remained relatively constant during stimulation. Epinephrine (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) and norepinephrine (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) produced inotropic and glycogenolytic effects blocked by propranolol but not phentolamine. Chemical sympathectomy and propranolol blocked the initial glycogenolytic and inotropic effects produced by isometric contraction, suggesting that they were caused by the release of endogenous catecholamines. Net lactate production in resting muscles accounted for > 50% of total glucosyl units utilized. During contraction net lactate production accounted < 10-15% of total glycosyl flux indicating that rat fast-twitch pale muscle is capable of significant rates of aerobic glucose oxidation. Oleate and caprylate did not affect mechanical performance, glycogen, or glucose metabolism in resting or contracting muscles.", 
    "37": "Fifty patients who underwent coronary and left ventricular angiography for suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) had ambulatory ECG monitoring at a time remote from that of catheterization. After correcting for positional ST segment variation on ambulatory ECG, the amount of time that ST segments deviated more than 1 mm. from baseline without corresponding angina was determined, and these results were correlated with results of angiography. Silent ST segment deviations were seen in patients without significant CAD in 2.2% of observations, but increased significantly with extent of coronary artery disease (2.9%, 8.2%, and 10.1% of observations in the one-, two-, and three-vessel disease groups, respectively). This relationship was independent of ventricular function, resting ECG, and previous symptoms. It is concluded that silent ST segment deviations on ambulatory ECG reflect the presence and severity of coronary artery disease.", 
    "38": "We have presented a case of \"painless thyroiditis,\" a syndrome of transient hyperthyroidism with low 131I uptake and no local thyroid gland symptoms. Although the cause is not known, our patient had recurrences after each of her three pregnancies, strengthening the association of this disorder with the postpartum state.", 
    "39": "Electrical stimulation in the lateral midbrain reticular formation (LRF) inhibited the responses of spinal dorsal horn neurons to noxious (50 degrees C) skin heating. Systemic administration of naloxone (0.1-2 mg/kg) had no effect on inhibition produced by LRF stimulation in 10 units, while this inhibition was partially blocked in 3 units. The results indicate that endogenous opiates are not primarily involved in mediating descending inhibition from LRF stimulation.", 
    "40": "Propranolol is a nonselective beta adrenergic blocking agent used clinically as the racemic mixture. Since (-)-propranolol is about 100 times more potent than its optical antipode, significant differences in their disposition may be important clinically, especially if affected by disease state. The present technique, for the first time, allows for the quantitation of both propranolol enantiomers after administration of the racemic mixture in man and dogs. Enantiomers are reacted with synthetically prepared and optically pure N-trifluoroacetyl-(-)-prolyl chloride, followed by high-performance liquid chromatographic separation of the diastereoisomers using fluorescence detection. Derivatization is quantitative (> 98%) from 2 to 1000 ng/ml; 4-hydroxy and N-desisopropyl propranolol, basic metabolites, do not interfere with the assay. (-)-Propranolol and (+)-propranolol and their corresponding glucuronide concentrations were determined in an angina patient taking 800 mg of propranolol daily and in two dogs given a single oral 80 mg dose. The ratio of the area under the plasma concentration-time curves for (-):(+)-propranolol, and for (-):(+)-propranolol glucuronide were 1.4 and 3.4, respectively, in man, and averaged 0.5, and 3.1, respectively, in dogs.", 
    "41": "The influence of surgery and anesthesia on perioperative plasma propranolol levels was studied in 25 hyperthyroid and five euthyroid patients undergoing thyroidectomy. Propranolol levels fell markedly after surgery as a consequence of poor drug administration in the immediate postoperative period due largely to patients' nausea and inability to swallow. Propranolol was not detectable in the plasma of three hyperthyroid patients 8 hr after surgery. When propranolol was given through a nasogastric tube, propranolol levels were satisfactory throughout. Compared with preoperative levels, in all patients there was a two- to threefold rise in total and free propranolol levels 24 hr after surgery, suggesting decreased hepatic clearance of propranolol. The degree of plasma protein binding of propranolol had also increased on the day after surgery, leading to a 30% reduction in propranolol free fraction. Surgery and anesthesia greatly influence the handling of propranolol in the perioperative period.", 
    "42": "The kinetics of propranolol and its metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol were determined together with heart rate and blood pressure responses in five cyanotic children on long-term propranolol therapy and after abrupt withdrawal. The daily dose range of propranolol was 2.4 to 4.4 mg/kg. Mean steady-state plasma propranolol concentrations, 16.5 to 114 ng/ml, were linearly related to dose (r = 0.93; p < 0.02) above a threshold dose of 1.8 mg/kg/day. There was excellent correlation (r = 0.96; p = 0.01) between concentrations and reduction in heart rate (delta HR, 14 to 27.5 beats/min), which also suggested a maximum heart rate response at plasma propranolol concentrations of 80 to 100 ng/ml. There was an inverse relationship between the plasma concentrations of 4-hydroxypropranolol and dose. On abrupt withdrawal of long-term propranolol therapy, plasma levels declined with a propranolol half-life (t1/2) of 3.9 to 6.4 hr, which correlated with the hemoglobin value. The 4-hydroxypropranolol t1/2 was 5.2 to 7.5 hr. Heart rates returned to normal after approximately 36 hr. Changes in blood pressure were minimal.", 
    "43": "Serial electrophysiologic testing of multiple drugs was performed in 21 patients with recurrent atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). All patients had reproducible sustained PSVT induced before drug administration. Serial daily PSVT induction was attempted after administration of i.v. ouabain (0.01 mg/kg) (16 patients), i.v. propranolol (0.1 mg/kg (17 patients), i.v. ouabain + propranolol (same dosages) (12 patients), i.v. procainamide (600-1000 mg) (17 patients) and oral quinidine (1600-2400 mg/day) (nine patients). In two of 21 patients (10%), no tested drug prevented induction of sustained PSVT. In 19 of 21 patients (90%), one or more drugs prevented induction of sustained PSVT: ouabain--seven patients, propranolol--seven patients, ouabain + propranolol--seven patients, procainamide--11 patients, quinidine--seven patients. The site of action of ouabain and/or propranolol was either the antegrade limb or the retrograde limb (RL) of the circus movement. The site of action of procainamide or quinidine was always the RL. These 19 patients were treated with oral drugs, based on results of serial testing. Eighteen patients were successfully followed for 6-50 months. In 13 of these 18 patients PSVT did not recur. Two patients (11%) had > 95% reduction in frequency of PSVT recurrences, and three (17%) did not respond to chosen oral drugs. Serial electrophysiologic testing of multiple drugs is feasible in patients with AV nodal reentrant paroxysmal tachycardia. Drug responses are variable. In most but not all patients, serial electrophysiologic testing defines effective prophylactic drug therapy. This method of defining prophylactic drug therapy appears most suitable for patients with poorly tolerated tachycardias that occur only sporadically.", 
    "44": "This study concerns 8 elderly patients with age-related chronic atrial fibrillation that required control of the ventricular response. The effects of oral administration of placebo, pindolol, verapamil, digoxin and digoxin + pindolol were assessed (each for a week) during three daily activity and sleep sessions, over a six-week period. Cardiac rhythm was monitored by taped electrocardiograms. Either digoxin or pindolol was effective, but digoxin was the best tolerated of all the drugs. A combination of pindolol and digoxin reduced the maximum ventricular rate without further depression of the minimum ventricular rate. Digoxin seems to be well tolerated in the control of atrial fibrillation in the elderly, and beta blockade may be a useful therapeutic adjunct.", 
    "45": "The effect of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) upon plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP), measured by a specific and sensitive RIA, has been studied in unanesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. Injection of the drug ip at a dose of 100 mg/kg BW caused a 10-fold rise in plasma AVP to 23.4 +/- 4.9 pg/ml (mean +/- SD). This effect was associated with a rise in plasmas osmolality to 301.8 +/- 3.9 mosmol/kg, but this change was accounted for totally by a rise in plasma glucose to 17.3 +/- 3.0 mM and in plasma urea to 3.4 +/- 0.4 mM. The only effective solute, plasma sodium, fell to 135.0 +/- 0.8 mM. Idiogenic osmoles did not change. Blood volume was reduced by about 5%, while PRA and mean arterial pressure did not change. Thus, the rise in plasma AVP caused by 2DG was not mediated by osmotic or hemodynamic stimuli. Treatment with propranolol (2.5 mg/kg BW) 15 min before 2DG completely abolished the AVP response. These results indicate that 2DG stimulates AVP release by a primary mechanism different from that which mediates the effect of insulin-induced hypoglycemia on AVP.", 
    "46": "Thirty-eight patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma were treated with topical timolol for 12-30 months (mean 20). A long lasting hypotensive effect of timolol eyedrops was found. However a need to increase therapy during the follow-up period was noted especially in the glaucoma group. Eyes with pseudoexfoliations often required concomitant therapy from the beginning. Ocular side effects were relatively few but four cases of punctate keratitis and another two with decreased corneal sensitivity were observed.", 
    "47": "1. Spontaneous isometric contractions were measured in 2 cm segments of bovine mesenteric lymphatics. 2. Field stimulation at 0.25, 1 anf 4 Hz increased the frequency of contraction. 3. Tetrodotoxin 3 x 10(-6) M blocked the response to electrical stimulation. 4. Phenoxybenzamine 3 x 10(-7) M converted the excitatory effect of stimulation to an inhibitory one. 5. Propranolol 3 x 10(-7) M potentiated the excitatory response to stimulation at 1 and 4 Hz. 6. Field stimulation was without effect in the presence of propranolol and phenoxybenzamine together. 7. Cocaine potentiated the response to stimulation at 0.25 and 1 Hz. 8. Atropine 3 x 10(-7) M failed to block the excitatory effect. 9. Field stimulation at 0.5 and 1 Hz increased the frequency of spontaneous contractions and propulsion of fluid by 8 cm cannulated segments of lymphatic. 10. The results suggest that bovine lymphatic vessels have a noradrenergic innervation which is capable of controlling lymph flow.", 
    "48": "1. Current-clamp experiments were carried out with guinea-pig papillary muscles to determine the dependence of depolarization-induced automaticity on endogenous catecholamines. 2. Catecholamine depletion was produced by pre-treatment of animals with 6-hydroxydopamine and confirmed by fluorimetric assay of right ventricular tissue. Papillary muscles from depleted animals demonstrated a marked suppression of depolarization-induced automaticity for maximum diastolic potentials less negative than -55 mV. This suppression was completely reversed by noradrenaline but not by tyramine. 3. In normal tissue, noradrenaline and tyramine had much smaller effects on automaticity arising from maximum diastolic potentials negative to -55 mV than on repetitive activity arising positive to this level. 4. L-propranolol in concentrations of 2-3 x 10(-7) M reduced repetitive activity in the less negative range of maximum diastolic potential. No evidence of direct membrane depression was observed at these doses and the effect was reversed by application of noradrenaline. 5. D-propranolol, the isomer with much lower beta-receptor blocking potency, required twentyfold higher concentrations to depress automaticity and this was accompanied by evidence of direct membrane depression, i.e. reduction of upstroke velocity of action potentials. 6. These results show that automaticity induced in guinea-pig papillary muscles by depolarization positive to -55 mV is strongly dependent upon endogenous catecholamines. 7. The hypothesis that endogenous catecholamines facilitate depolarization-induced automaticity through an increase in calcium conductance was modelled using numerical techniques. It was found that changes in calcium conductance caused changes in the model which closely parallelled the experimental effects of catecholamine depletion and beta-blockade. The effects of changes in delayed rectification in the model did not accurately reproduce the experimental results.", 
    "49": "Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded during classical delay conditioning of rhesus macaque monkeys. When portions of the autonomic nervous system were selectively blocked by pharmacological agents, it appeared that the initial increases in heart rate and blood pressures in response to the conditioned stimulus were the result of increased sympathetic activity and a concomitant decrease in parasympathetic activity. Towards the end of the conditioned stimulus, an increase in parasympathetic activity was indicated. Blockade of the autonomic system which produced total elimination of the conditioned cardiac rate response and substantial reduction or elimination of the conditioned blood pressure response, was not necessarily or always accompanied by a corresponding elimination of the respective unconditioned responses. Such a finding suggests a different underlying neural mediation of these conditioned and unconditioned responses.", 
    "50": "The electrophysiological effects of the beta-adrenergic antagonist, alprenolol, were compared in normal and depressed canine myocardium. Both (+) and (+/-)-alprenolol (5 x 10(-6) and 10(-5) mol.litre-1) decreased action potential amplitude and Vmax in Purkinje fibres superfused with Tyrode's solution in tissue bath. These concentrations shortened action potential duration and effective refractory period of Purkinje fibres but prolonged those of ventricular muscle. Alprenolol more markedly decreased Vmax and sometimes prevented action potential propagation in Purkinje fibres overlying infarcted regions. Similar depressant actions were noted in Purkinje fibres depolarised by exposure to 9 mmol.litre-1 K+. Depolarised and diseased myocardium is more sensitive to alprenolol and the drug's membrane depressant actions may be significant in terminating arrhythmias in such tissue.", 
    "51": "31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to ascertain whether propranolol could reduce the development of myocardial acidosis during periods of ischaemic arrest and were studied. Cardiac pH progressively declined during ischaemia from a normal 6.97 +/- 0.02 (n = 23) to 6.09 +/- 0.04 or 5.96 +/- 0.04, respectively. Normalisation of pH following reperfusion occurred only in the 35 min ischaemic hearts. Propranolol (1 mg. litre-1) given prior to arrest significantly reduced the magnitude of developing acidosis regardless of the length of ischaemia. Furthermore, it aided in the normalisation of intramyocardial pH upon reperfusion in both groups. Propranolol significantly reduced the magnitude of phosphocreatine (PCr loss normally seen during ischaemic arrest alone, but it did not protect against depletion of ATP. Restoration of PCr reperfusion was virtually complete in all cases, while transient increases in ATP were seen only in those hearts protected by propranolol. In summary, this NMR study demonstrated the first direct evidence that a significant component of the myocardial acidosis caused by global ischaemia and arrest can be blocked by propranolol.", 
    "52": "In this study we have attempted: firstly to assess the extent to which the presence of partial agonist activity in a beta-blocking compound and/or sympathetic drive, influence ischaemic injury, and secondly to determine if any of the observed differences are due to changes in contractile activity. In the isolated, globally ischaemic (low flow) rat heart, oxprenolol (which possesses partial agonist activity) did not reduce creatine kinase leakage to the same extent as propranolol (no partial agonist activity) regardless of the background level of catecholamine drive. However, increasing background catecholamine drive increased the relative protection against enzyme leakage, of both beta-blockers. Under conditions of zero contractile activity (high K+ - medium) neither beta-blocker reduced enzyme leakage. Thus at equi-blocking doses oxprenolol and propranolol reduce enzyme leakage to different extents and the lesser protection afforded by oxprenolol is likely to be attributed to the presence of partial agonist activity. In addition, the reduction in enzyme leakage caused by both these compounds is due to reductions in contractile activity.", 
    "53": "The pharmacokinetics of propranolol in a fasted dog was examined following single oral, intraportal and intravenous doses. Extensive tissue uptake of propranolol occurred after intravenous dosing, the overall distribution volume was 11 liters/kg. Biological half-life was 1.5 hr, but was prolonged after oral and intraportal drug administration. Following oral doses, the absorption efficiency of propranolol as unchanged drug was 71%, while first-pass metabolism accounted for a further loss of 62% prior to its reaching the systemic circulation. Accordingly, the overall oral bioavailability was 27%.", 
    "54": "A double-masked study was carried out to assess the effect of timolol ophthalmic-solution on corneal sensitivity in seven normal volunteers. No significant change in corneal sensitivity was demonstrated during four weeks of timolol administration. Corneal sensitivity was determined in two age-matched groups, one comprising 27 glaucomatous patients on timolol therapy for at least three months and the other consisting of 24 normal individuals who had never been on any beta-blocking agents. No significant difference in corneal sensitivity was noted between the two groups. The tear production was determined by means of the Schirmer test I in 15 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension prior to and during timolol therapy of 13 months duration. No significant change in tear production was noted.", 
    "55": "Many sympathetic principal neurones of the superior cervical ganglion of the newborn rat are known to be plastic with respect to the choice between norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh) as transmitter; when the neurones are dissociated and placed in culture, a majority of them can be shifted from an initial, immature, adrenergic state to a cholinergic state by co-culture with a variety of non-neuronal cells or by medium conditioned by such cells. To study this transition it has been helpful to grow single neurones, each in a microculture which also contains cardiac myocytes. The transmitter status of a neurone can be assayed by recording its effect on the myocytes (adrenergic excitation, cholinergic inhibition or dual function); then a fine structural assay of the neurone based on the appearance of the synaptic vesicles can be made and correlated directly with the physiology. In this paper we report the following findings on principal neurones developing in such microcultures. (i) During the transition period, a majority of the neurones were dual in function and in vesicular appearance. (ii) The physiological effects and vesicular appearance varied from mainly adrenergic to mainly cholinergic. (iii) In preliminary attempts to follow the transition by recording at least twice from the same microculture, partial transitions were observed, always in the direction adrenergic-to-cholinergic. (iv) The transitions were not synchronous or fixed in time course even in pairs of neurones grown side by side in the same microculture.", 
    "56": "The diurnal increase of fibrinolytic activity in the forenoon was investigated after alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade in 15 volunteers. Four milligrams propranolol was injected i. v. alone or in combination with 20 mg phentolamine. Neither the beta-blocking agent, propranolol, nor the combination with the alpha-blocker, phentolamine, had any significant effect on the diurnal increase of fibrinolytic activity.", 
    "57": "Captopril is the first orally active inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme to become available. It has been studied primarily in hypertension. In mild to moderate essential hypertension captopril is about as effective as usual doses of hydrochlorothiazide or propranolol, about one-half of such patients needing the addition of a diuretic to achieve satisfactory control of blood pressure. In severe hypertension captopril plus a diuretic (and in some patients a beta-blocker) usually reduced blood pressure significantly more than could be achieved with 'standard triple therapy' in patients not responding adequately to such a regimen, and often resulted in an improved feeling of well-being in severely hypertensive patients previously receiving intensive multiple drug therapy. Indeed, at the present stage of the drug's development, patients not responding to or not tolerating 'traditional' antihypertensive therapy represent the most suitable candidates for captopril treatment. While captopril has been well tolerated in most patients, some troublesome or potentially serious side effects have been reported, including agranulocytosis, dysgeusia and reduced renal function; although a clear causal relationship with captopril was not always established, it would appear that the final place of captopril in the treatment of hypertension may ultimately depend on further clarification of its adverse effects profile. In addition to studies in hypertension, captopril has produced encouraging improvement in a small number of patients with severe congestive heart failure resistant to conventional therapy. Captopril must be considered an exciting addition to the therapeutic armamentarium; it, and pharmacologically related compounds of the future, will continue to generate much interest as their final place in therapy becomes better defined through additional well designed studies and wider clinical experience.", 
    "58": "Twenty patients undergoing elective myocardial revascularization for coronary insufficiency were divided into two equal groups. In 10 patients, propranolol was discontinued 24 hours before operation while the remaining patients received propranolol until the day of operation. Plasma renin was elevated in the intensive care unit in the control group (p < 0.05) whereas patients receiving propranolol did not demonstrate significant elevation of plasma renin. Systemic vascular resistance was elevated in both groups in the intensive care unit (p < 0.05) and was associated with hypertension as defined by a blood pressure of greater than or equal to 160/100 mm Hg in 80% of the control patients and 70% of patients receiving propranolol. We conclude from this study that renin metabolism does not contribute significantly to the production of hypertension following coronary artery operation.", 
    "59": "The hemodynamic effects of intravenous labetalol (a combined alpha- and beta-blocking agent) were studied in 11 patients during early post-open heart surgery hypertension. With a mean dosage of 15 mg, labetalol reduced both systemic arterial pressures and the heart rate by an average of 21 percent (p < .001). The patients failed to compensate for the decline in pressure and pulse rate by elevation of their stroke volume, and even the cardiac index (CI) was severely depressed (from 2.30 to 1.67 L/min/m2, ie, 27 percent; p < .001). Neither left ventricular filling pressure nor vascular resistance was affected by labetalol early after open heart surgery. In four patients, 3 mg of glucagon after administration of labetalol elevated pulmonary arterial pressures and increased the CI by 16 percent. Two patients were observed on the preoperative day, and their response to labetalol was similar to that described in earlier studies: during blood pressure decline, CI was slightly augmented, and the systemic vascular resistance was greatly reduced (26 percent). The results indicate that after open heart surgery, patients are highly sensitive to the beta-blocking effects of labetalol, and although labetalol can greatly reduce myocardial oxygen consumption, it cannot be recommended for the treatment of post-open heart surgery hypertension.", 
    "60": "1. In eight hypertensive diabetic subjects receiving hydrochlorothiazide, glucose homeostasis as measured by the changes in plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon after an oral glucose load was not significantly affected by 8 weeks of therapy with metoprolol. 2. The combination of metoprolol plus hydrochlorothiazide significantly lowered blood pressure in all subjects. 3. Plasma renin activity was suppressed by therapy with metoprolol.", 
    "61": "The effect of the administration of propranolol 0.15 mg per kg body weight i.v. on the metabolic response to pelvic surgery was compared with results in similar patients who had not received propranolol. The only significant difference between the two groups was a lower plasma insulin concentration in the beta-blockade patients after 60 and 90 min of surgery. The glycaemic response to surgery was unimpaired in the propranolol-treated patients and there were no adverse haemodynamic effects. We conclude that beta-adrenergic blockage is unlikely to have deleterious metabolic effects on healthy patients.", 
    "62": "Renal glomeruli were isolated from rat kidneys using a passive mechanical sieving technique. Suspensions of 40-50 mg glomeruli were placed in glass chambers and superfused by a modified Krebs-Ringer solution. Effluent collections of 10-min fractions were measured for renin or prostaglandin (PG) E2 concentration using radioimmunoassays. The perfusate was altered to contain either the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, angiotensin II, or arachidonic acid. Isoproterenol at 1.78 or 8.1 X 10(-4) M produced a significant release of renin, but the concentration of PGE2 was unaffected. Isoproterenol-stimulated renin release was blocked by 1.2 X 10(-4) M propranolol but was unaffected by 6.3 X 10(-6) M meclofenamate. Angiotensin II at 4 or 40 X 10(-9) M altered neither renin nor PGE2. Arachidonic acid administered at 1.6 or 16.0 X 10(-5) M produced a marked increase in PG synthesis and stimulated a significant release of renin. Treatment of glomeruli with 6.3 X 10(-6) M meclofenamate attenuated PGE2 synthesis and abolished renin release, but 1.2 X 10(-4) M propranolol had no effect on PG synthesis or the coincident release of renin. These results give direct evidence of an interrelating mechanism between renal prostaglandins and renin release that is independent of external tubular or hemodynamic stimuli and show that the beta-adrenergic pathway of renin stimulation is independent of any modifying influence exerted by prostaglandins.", 
    "63": "Fifty-five patients with primary hypertension, World Health Organization (WHO) stages I and II, were randomly allocated to a 9-mo multicenter, controlled, double-blind, crossover study with timolol, a nonselective beta adrenoceptor blocker, and hydrochlorothiazide combined with the potassium-sparing drug amiloride (AHCT). In 54% of the patients the blood pressure responded to timolol, in 87% to AHCT, and in 91% to a combination of the two. The diurectic was more effective than the beta blocker in patients with low-renin hypertension, who all responded to AHCT. Overall, there was no correlation between pretreatment plasma renin activity (PRA) and hypothensive effect of either drug. Timolol reduced PRA by 58% and plasma aldosterone (PA) by 23% while AHCT increased these levels threefold. Combination therapy increased PA while PRA returned towards baseline, suggesting greater aldosterone stimulation by the diuretic component. Serum triglycerides rose during timolol treatment alone and in combination. Both timolol and AHCT are effective antihypertensives. In combination they normalize blood pressure in most patients with primary hypertension (WHO stages I and II). Determination of PRA is useful as a guide to the choice of the first treatment in searching out low-renin hypertensive patients, who are best treated with diuretics.", 
    "64": "Isoproterenol infusion (0.1 microgram/kg per min) into the renal artery of the cat induced an increase in plasma renin concentration (PRC) from 14.3 +/- 5.7 (mean +/- SE) ng angiotensin I/ml per hr to 56.8 +/- 7.7 after 70 minutes (P < 0.05) and an increase in catecholamine secretion rate from 38.7 +/- 6.0 ng/kg per 10 min to 180.0 +/- 40.0 after 70 minutes (P < 0.001). Intravenous infusion of the same dose of isoproterenol had no significant effect on adrenomedullary catecholamine secretion rate. Isoproterenol induced preferential norepinephrine release: the ratio of norepinephrine to epinephrine secretion changed from 11.5:23.7 during the control period to 130.0:40.1 70 minutes after the start of isoproterenol administration. Intrarenal infusion of propranolol (3.0 mg/kg per min) inhibited renal renin release and adrenal catecholamine secretion in response to intrarenal isoproterenol. Intravenous infusion (0.4 microgram/kg per min) of an angiotensin II antagonist [Sar1, Ileu8]angiotensin II abolished the catecholamine response to intrarenal isoproterenol infusion. It is suggested that intrarenal isoproterenol infusion stimulates renal renin release and angiotensin production which, in turn, stimulates a preferential secretion of adrenomedullary norepinephrine.", 
    "65": "The effect of insulin-induced hypoglycemia upon plasma arginine vasopressin measured by a specific and sensitive RIA has been studied in unanesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. Hypoglycemia caused a 5-fold rise in plasma arginine vasopressin to a maximum of 28.0 +/- 9.1 pg/ml (mean +/- SD). This response was associated with a 2% fall in plasma osmolality, a rise in plasma sodium of less than 1%, a 10% fall in estimated blood volume, and no significant change in mean arterial blood pressure. PRA was increased 5-fold by hypoglycemia. However, beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol completely prevented the renin response without altering the rise in vasopressin. In contrast, water loading abolished and hypertonic saline loading enhanced the effect of hypoglycemia on plasma vasopressin. We conclude that insulin-induced hypoglycemia stimulates vasopressin secretion by some as yet unrecognized primary mechanism whose responsiveness can be altered by changes in osmolality."
