    "0": "Ten patients affected by essential moderate or severe hypertension were given five sequential treatments, each for three weeks: 1) placebo, 2) chlorthalidone (Cl) 100 mg daily, 3) Cl 50 mg + oxprenolol slow release (Ox) 160 mg daily, 4) Ox 160 mg and 5) Ox 320 mg daily. Four subjects poor responders (DPB greater than or equal to 110 mmHg) received a later administration of Ox 160 + Cl 50 + hydrallazine (Hydr) 25-100 mg daily. Both groups of patients showed the greatest antihypertensive action with Ox 160 + Cl 50 mg daily. Oxprenolol induced a similar hypotensive effectiveness at 160, as well as 320 mg/day. Relationship between plasma renin activity (PRA) values and antihypertensive response to each treatment takes the following conclusions: 1) Basal PRA levels cannot be a guide for preferential choice of diuretic or betablocking therapy. 2) It is likely that renin activated by Cl and Hydr partially blunts their hypotensive activity. On the contrary, essential hypertension with normal or low PRA does not seem depending on angiogensinogenic factors. 3) Oxprenolol remarkably inhibits the overreninism induced by chlorthalidone and hydrallazine, in such way increasing their antihypertensive action. 4) In the management of essential moderate or severe hypertension is preferable to employ a mild dosage of betablockers and diuretics, rather than use higher doses of a single agent.", 
    "1": "Nine uraemic patients not yet on dialysis received IV 1 microgram/kg/min of propranolol for 85 min after a priming dose of 1 mg. Fifteen days later six of them received IV 1.2 microgram/kg/min of metoprolol after a priming dose of 1.2 mg. Plasma concentrations of PTH and calcitonin decreased significantly with propranolol but not with metoprolol. No change was observed with either drug as regards plasma concentration of total and ionised Ca and PO4. Heart rate was decreased similarly with both drugs. We conclude that (i) propranolol acutely suppresses PTH and Calcitonin secretion in uraemic patients. This warrants further studies to assess its long term effects on the secretion of these hormones and on renal osteodystrophy; (ii) the contrast between the significant effect of propranolol and the lack of effect with metoprolol supports the concept that PTH and CT secretion are moderated through specific beta 2 receptors.", 
    "2": "The anti-fibrillatory ED50-values of a series of agents were determined. Upon administration of the agents in this ED50-dose (all agents then being equieffective in their antifibrillatory action) various side effects of each of them were quantitatively measured. The measured side effects were: the negative inotropic and chronotropic action, the conduction retarding, refractory period prolonging, excitability decreasing and ectopic automaticity depressing action. The substrate for these measurements was the isolated perfused rat heart. The series of agents tested consisted of a group possessing a beta-adrenolytic component and a group in which this component was absent. We compared quantitatively the side effects induced by the one group with those induced by the other. Differences were found in their influence on contractility and conductivity but not in their influence on the other parameters. The results obtained do not support the expectation that a beta-adrenolytic component will enlarge the therapeutic range of an antifibrillatory agent.", 
    "3": "Parasympathetic and beta-adrenergic blocking agents were administered to near term chronically instrumented sheep. Parasympathetic blockade resulted in a significant increase in fetal heart rate and fetal arterial blood pressure, with a minimal nonsignificant increase in umbilical blood flow. beta-Adrenergic blockade resulted in a decrease in fetal heart rate and umbilical blood flow, though neither was statistically significant. There was no change in arterial blood pressure. The net result of parasympathetic and beta-adrenergic blockade on fetal heart rate suggests that the intrinsic rate is the same as when these influences are present.", 
    "4": "The effect of D-, L- and DL-propranolol on the glucose uptake in human erythrocytes was studied. It was observed that all three compounds competitively inhibit the glucose transport and have identical inhibition constants. The pH dependence of the inhibition constant indicates that uncharged propranolol is a more potent inhibitor than the charged one. The thermodynamic parameters of the interaction of propranolol with the glucose transport system were determined and discussed.", 
    "5": "The authors have analysed a series of 357 patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass. The onset of complications was studied in relation to the past history, the anaesthetic protocol, the period of extra-corporeal circulation and the type of myocardial protection. Complications consisted of acute hypertensive episodes, arrhythmias, peroperative myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction. The degree of beta-blocker therapy and above all its continuation up to the time of operation would seem to be an important factor in effective myocardial protection.", 
    "6": "On the basis of a haemodynamic study involving the intravenous administration of disopyramide, a review is undertaken of the haemodynamic action of various anti-arrhythmics likely to be used pre- or peroperatively by the anaesthetist. All anti-arrhythmic agents have possible haemodynamic properties which may prove troublesome for the anaesthetist: --all (with the possible exception of bretylium tosylate) have negative inotropic properties; --all (with the exception of disopyramide) decrease peripheral resistance. These effects are as a rule slight in the healthy subject but may give rise to difficulties during anaesthesia of a patient with a damaged myocardium.", 
    "7": "Beta-blockers have been used in cardiology for the past 15 years in three directions: angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. The haemodynamic effects are real: --imposed bradycardia, whether the basal rhythm be sinus or atrial fibrillation; --confirmed myocardial depression which reduces the energy needs of the myocardium; --fall in systolic pressure, the mechanism of which remains open to discussion. The theories explaining these haemodynamic effects are reviewed. The harmful effects of these substances are defined, together with the drug combinations which may avoid or counteract them.", 
    "8": "The antiarrhythmic activity of the compound N-(trans-3-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl)-N-(3-oxo-3-phenyl-2-methylpropyl)-piperazine hydrochloride, referred to as P11, is studied on anaesthesized cats and Wistar albino rats, as well as on non-anaesthesized rabbits. Four types of experimental arrhythmia are used--with BaCl2, with chloroform-adrenaline, with strophantine G and with aconitine. The compound P11 is introduced in doses of 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg intravenously and 10 mg/kg orally. The compound manifests antiarrhythmic activity in all models of experimental arrhythmia used, causing greatest inhibition on the arrhythmia induced by chloroform-adrenaline (in 90 per cent) and with BaCl2 (in 84 per cent). The results obtained are associated with the beta-adrenoblocking and with the membrane-stabilizing action of the compound.", 
    "9": "The effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade by propranolol and practolol on submaximally pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion was studied in conscious non-vagotomized and in vagotomized gastric fistula dogs. Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) intravenously augmented gastric acid output in vagotomized dogs, more after truncal and selective vagotomy than after parietal cell vagotomy. Vagally innervated dogs also showed an increase, but to a lesser degree and not statistically significant. The increase restored the acid output to preoperative levels in the vagotomized dogs. Practolol (1.0 mg/kg) intravenously resulted in a slight and insignificant increase in acid output in dogs with truncal vagotomy and had only a negligible effect in vagally innervated dogs and after selective and parietal cell vagotomy. It is concluded that propranolol augments pentagastrin-stimulated acid output in vagotomized dogs, and this augmentation was most pronounced in the totally vagotomized stomach. Practolol had minor influence on gastric acid secretion. This effect of the two beta-blocking agents indicates that beta 2-blockade is most important for the secretory augmentation. The restoration of postvagotomy acid secretion to preoperative levels suggests that adrenergic influence is important for the decrease in pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion after vagotomy.", 
    "10": "The effects of single equipotent doses of Propranolol and Carazolol on cardiac haemodynamics of normal persons were investigated in a placebo-controlled double-blind study by radiocardiographic measurements of minimal cardiac transit times (MTTs). 90 min after oral application of 40 mg Propranolol a significant (p less than 0.005) prolongation of MTTs between the right auricle and the aortic root by 25% could be observed. A corresponding effect after treatment with 5 mg Carazolol was not recognizable (p greater than 0.05). Both substances strongly reduced the heart rate. The negative chronotropic effects of both beta-blockers were indistinguishable (p greater than 0.05).", 
    "11": "Five mg of a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist (atenolol) was given i.v. to 5 women with severe pre-eclampsia in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. There was a significant decrease of both mean systolic blood pressure, from 171 to 155 mm Hg, and mean diastolic blood pressure, from 116 to 107 mm Hg. The mean maternal heart rate decreased significantly from 90 to 74 and mean fetal heart rate significantly from 145 to 138 beats per min. There were no significant changes in the plasma levels of cyclic AMP, insulin, glucose, free fatty acids, 3-hydroxy-butyrate or glycerol.", 
    "12": "Six healthy volunteers took part in a randomized, single-blind, crossover study to quantitate the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) of penbutolol in comparison with one drug possessing ISA (alprenolol) and with the standard non-ISA drug (propranolol). Single intravenous and one week oral administrations were studied. Complete parasympathetic and sympathetic isolation of the heart was obtained by administration of atropine 0.04 mg/kg body weight i.v. and propranolol 0.4 mg/kg i.v., or corresponding equipotent doses of alprenolol 0.4 mg/kg i.v. and penbutolol i.v. 0.08 mg/kg. In the chronic, oral study propranolol 160 mg b.i.d. was given, or corresponding equipotent doses of alprenolol (400 mg b.i.d.) or penbutolol (40 mg b.i.d.). The test procedure included measurement of heart rate and blood pressure in the supine, sitting and standing positions, and during isometric and dynamic exercise. ISA was calculated by comparison of the change in of heart rate with that produced by propranolol. The ISA of alprenolol was 22--26% and of penbutolol 12--18% of maximal sympathetic activity. Isometric and dynamic exercise gave comparable ISA values.", 
    "13": "The metabolism of pamatolol was studied in man, dogs, rats and mice after oral administration of a single dose. The drug was well absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract and excreted in the urine, mainly in unchanged form, within 24 hrs. Four urinary metabolites were identified by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric techniques. The metabolic data, in man, dog and mouse was found to be similar, both qualitatively and quantitatively. One metabolism route, involving aliphatic hydroxylation and subsequent oxidation, was found, to a significant extent only in the rat. The species variation between the mouse and the rat with regard to long-term toxicity of pamatolol is discussed. Artefact formation during trace analysis was observed.", 
    "14": "1 This study was designed to compare in a double-blind randomized crossover trial, atenolol, labetalol, metoprolol and pindolol. Considerable differences in dose (atenolol 138 +/- 13 mg daily; labetalol 308 +/- 34 mg daily; metoprolol 234 +/- 22 mg daily; and pindolol 24 +/-2 mg daily were required to produce similar antihypertensive effects. 3 The overall incidence of side-effects was similar with atenolol, metoprolol and pindolol but was slightly less with labetalol. Sleep disturbances and abnormal dreaming patterns were most frequent with pindolol. 4 There was a significantly greater fall in pulse rate during atenolol and metoprolol treatment periods.", 
    "15": "1 The pharmacological and therapeutic effects of labetalol were investigated during an 8 h interdose period of chronic oral therapy in six patients with essential hypertension. 2 Peak plasma labetalol concentrations were observed 2 h after the morning oral dose, and subsequent decline was mono exponential. 3 Beta-adrenoceptor blockade paralleled the changes in labetalol concentration and was maximal 2 and 4 h after the oral dose. 4 Resting supine systolic BP rose significantly during the interdose period, but no change occurred in diastolic BP. 5 Ambulatory intra-arterial BP studies in a further six patients with essential hypertension controlled with labetalol did not confirm the increase in BP during an 8 h interdose period.", 
    "16": "1 After acute intravenous administration labetalol reduced mean values for BP, total peripheral resistance, heart rate and cardiac output. All changes were more pronounced during bicycle exercise. 2 After a mean duration of 20 months' treatment with oral labetalol the haemodynamic findings were broadly similar except for a more marked reduction in the total peripheral resistance and cardiac output had returned to pretreatment level due to an increased stroke volume which had counter balanced the reduction in heart rate. These changes occurred at rest, in the erect position and during exercise but the reductions in BP and peripheral resistance were most marked during exercise. 3 Left ventricular filling pressures and stroke volume/filling pressure ratios were not significantly altered after intravenous labetalol compared with pretreatment values. 4 Systolic BP x heart rate product was lowered particularly during exercise after both intravenous and oral labetalol. 5 After long-term oral labetalol, the most striking haemodynamic change was in the elevated resting stroke volume supine and standing.", 
    "17": "Particulate fractions of myocardium taken from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) contained an adenylate cyclase system that was less responsive than normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats to norepinephrine, isoproterenol (mixed beta-agonist), salbutamol (beta 2-agonist), dobutamine (beta 1-agonist), dopamine, histamine, and glucagon. Addition of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate to the SHR myocardial preparation again yielded a lessened sensitivity to all agents except norepinephrine, dopamine, and histamine. Chronic treatment of SHR with clonidine and a high dose of propranolol produced a cardiac enzyme that was insensitive to activation by norepinephrine. Similar treatment with a low dose of propranolol did not alter myocardial responses to norepinephrine.", 
    "18": "The relationships between the cardiovascular effects, alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking actions and plasma concentration of labetalol have been examined in conscious DOCA hypertensive rats. Labetalol (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg p.o.) reduced resting heart rate; blood pressure was reduced only by the two higher doses. The effects lasted 5-24 hours. There was a highly significant correlation between the plasma labetalol concentration and its cardiovascular effects. During the labetalol-induced hypotension and bradycardia the vasopressor responses to intra-arterial injections of phenylephrine were reduced; the tachycardia and vasodepressor responses produced by intra-arterial injections of isoprenaline were also reduced. It is concluded that alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade probably account for the labetalol-induced decreases in resting blood pressure and heart rate respectively.", 
    "19": "The disposition profiles of a new beta-adrenergic-blocking drug, timolol, were investigated in healthy subjects after single oral doses, and in patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension given multiple doses. The t1/2 of timolol were different between the two groups, possibly due to the decreased plasma clearance after multiple administration. The dosage regimen calculations for patients indicated to receive the treatment for certain chronic diseases, should be determined by utilizing the disposition data obtained in steady-state conditions. The absolute reduction of exercise heart rate gave the best coefficient as a beta-blockade assessment. Applying a theory for translating the pharmacokinetics to the duration-action course of drug, pharmacokinetic t1/2 was proven to be much shorter than pharmacological t1/2. Timolol given on a twice-daily schedule has shown both antihypertensive effectiveness and plasma-renin-suppressing action in different subject. However, the casual relationship between the drug plasma level, blood pressure fall and change in PRA was not so clearly disclosed. The pharmacokinetics of beta-blockers, particularly with the property of receiving extensive metabolism by the mechanism of hepatic first-pass effect should be studied between single- and multiple-dosing schedules in subjects with diverse clinical conditions.", 
    "20": "In a cohort of 417 patients admitted consecutively to the Coronary Care Unit for acute myocardial ischemia (unstable angina pectoris in 121, acute myocardial infarction in 296 patients) 21 cases of non arrhythmogenic sudden death occurred within 24 hours after admission. 16 of these patients suffered from acute myocardial infarction and 5 from unstable angina pectoris. Cause of death was cardiac rupture in 12 and pump failure in 4 patients with acute myocardial infarction, whereas all patients with unstable angina pectoris died from pump failure. Patients with cardiac rupture within 24 hours after admission, had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure in comparison with the other groups and with patients dying from cardiac rupture on the third day, or later. All patients dying from pump failure with unstable angina pectoris and one of the patients dying from pump failure with acute myocardial infarction had beta blocker therapy. Beta blockers were given to 68 of the patients with unstable angina pectoris. Acute pump failure occurred in this group only. The risk of pump failure with beta receptor blocking drugs is indicated by angina decubitus, marked dyspnea during anginal attacks (even in patients free of signs of cardial insufficiency outside their attacks) and a lack of responsiveness to beta blocking therapy. In these patients rapid coronary angiography and bypass surgery seems to be the prefered method of management. Beta blockers should not be given to these patients or discontinued in cases which lack responsiveness.", 
    "21": "The usefulness of labetalol, a new combined alpha and beta adrenoceptor antagonist as a hypotensive agent in otological operations was studied in 18 otherwise healthy patients. After a single 1.0 mg/kg i.v. dose the maximum decrease in systolic (18%) and diastolic (8%) blood pressure occured between 5 to 15 minutes (mean 11 min), and the pretreatment blood pressure values were reached in 15 to 55 min (mean 26 min). Similarly, after a single 2.0 mg/kg i.v. dose the maximum blood pressure decrease (32%/20%) was observed in 5 to 40 minutes (mean 23.5 min) lasting 30 to 95 minutes (mean 60.1 min). Generally, a moderate decrease in blood pressure without a concomitant increase in heart rate or excessive hypotension was found.", 
    "22": "Tienilic acid has blood pressure lowering properties alone and in combined treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents; 250 mg of tienilic acid seems to correspond to 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Tienilic acid effectively reduces serum urate and has no marked or rapid effect on potassium balance. During short-term treatment, no impairment of glucose tolerance was found.", 
    "23": "The authors examined the influence of beta-adrenergic stimulators Isoprenaline and Salbutamol as well as beta-adrenergic blockers Propranolol, Practolol and Pindolol on the proliferation of cells, forming plaques, 7S-immunoglobulins, hemagglutination titres and hemolytic activity of the complement. Primary stimulation with subsequent inhibition was induced by beta-adrenergic agonists and inhibition--by beta blocker Propronanol in a base of 10 mg/kg on the proliferation of cells, forming antibodies. The results were in correlation with hemagglutination titres. Salbutamol and beta-blockers inhibited immune hemolysis. The mechanisms of the observed effect are discussed in respect to the specific and nonspecific effect of the drugs used.", 
    "24": "The wide variety of antihypertensive agents now available allows considerable flexibility in the pharmacologic management of hypertension. The newly available alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents have added considerably to this flexibility. Their safety and efficacy insure that they will find increasing use in the treatment of hypertension. The new postsynaptic alpha-receptor blocker prazosin, is generally free of the side effects that precluded the use of alpha-blockers which affected both pre- and postsynaptic receptors. Is is moderately effective and, excepting the problem of \"first-dose\" hypotension, it is usually well tolerated. Labetalol, a compound possessing both alpha- and beta-receptor blocking properties, has been found to be effective both as an oral therapy for chronic hypertension and as an intravenous agent in treating hypertensive crisis. Further experience with labetolol will determine its safety and efficacy for the long-term management of hypertension. Although the usefulness of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents in hypertension is unquestionable, the mechanism by which they lower the blood pressure remains in question. Most of our experience has been with propranolol, but other beta-blockers, now used in England and Europe, are likely to become available in the United States. As of January, 1979 only metoprolol has been added to propranolol as approved beta-blockers for the treatment of hypertension. General guidelines for the use of propranolol are given in Table 6. Metoprolol will likely find increasing use since it seems to work as well as propranolol and probably causes fewer side effects. Nevertheless, the experiences with one beta-blocker, both good and bad, cannot be interpolated to another beta-blocker since there are obvious and subtle differences in their actions. Patients doing well on propranolol therapy should continue to receive that drug; patients being started on a beta-blocker therapy can be given the choice of metoprolol and, in the near future, other beta-blockers as well. Beyond their efficacy and freedom from side effects in about 80% of patients, beta-blockers may offer a special advantage in protecting from coronary heart disease. Such protection has been suggested in limited trials but needs further documentation. In the meantime, the known advantages of beta-blockers ensure their increasing use in the treatment of hypertension. Regardless of which alpha- or beta-blocker is chosen, a diuretic should be used concomitantly to enhance and preserve the effectiveness of the adrenergic blocker.", 
    "25": "Antiacetylcholine activity some beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs was investigated using isolated guinea pig cremaster muscle and frog fectus abdominis muscle. On the cremaster muscle, the antagonism to acetylcholine was non competitive in K0 1313, (+/-)-INPEA and (--)-INPEA, competitive in (+)-INPEA and functional in practolol; All three INPEA isomers, practolol and propranolol behaved as noncompetitive antagonists of acetylcholine on frog rectus muscle. Caffeine-induced contractions of this muscle were partially inhibited by propranolol but not by the other drugs. It is suggested that the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs produce their antiacetylcholine action by interaction with sites on the muscle which are different from the cholinceptor, and which vary between compounds and species.", 
    "26": "The influence of triamterene on the contractile force and the cellular electrolyte content and exchange was studied in isolated, electrically stimulated guinea-pig atria. 1. Triamterene (40 to 200 mumol/l) produces a positive inotropic effect which is most pronounced when the extracellular calcium concentration is reduced (1.2 to 0.6 mmol/l) or the contractile force is diminished by pentobarbital (400 mumol/l). The inotropic action of triamterene was shown to be independent of the rate of stimulation (1--2 Hz). 2. By pretreatment with the adrenergic beta-receptor blocking drugs bupranolol and pindolol or by reserpinization the positive inotropic effect of triamterene was not significantly altered. 3. After incubating the atrial preparations with 45calcium for 30 min the intracellularly exchangeable calcium fraction was significantly enhanced by triamterene (100 mumol/l). If triamterene was added to the bathing medium after the 45calcium exchange process had already reached a steady-state, no further increase in the extent of the intracellular calcium exchange was observed during an additional 30-min period of incubation. Since the cellular total calcium content shows remained unchanged it is postulated that the increase in calcium influx is balanced by a simultaneous elevation of calcium efflux. In addition, triamterene did not show any influence on the intracellular potassium, sodium and magnesium content as well as on the extracellular space volume.", 
    "27": "1 A treatment group comprising 635 hypertensive men (casual SBP greater than 175 or DBP greater than 115 twice) was compared with a reference group (n = 391 men; casual SBP greater than 175 or DBP greater than 115 only at screening). All men belonged to the same population sample of 7,455 men aged 47-54 yr. 2 The two groups did not differ with respect to age, smoking habits or cholesterol values, but screening BPs were higher in the treatment group. 3 During 4.3 years' follow-up there was a significantly lower total death rate in the treatment group compared with reference group. 4 There was also a strong tendency towards lower incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction (P = 0.06). The pooled incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD was lower in the treatment group than in the reference group (P less than 0.03).", 
    "28": "1 Echocardiography showed 14 of 24 patients with essential hypertension to have hypertrophy of their left ventricular walls. In eight of these 14 patients the left ventricular configuration initially fulfilled the criteria for asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH) and six were symmetrically hypertrophied, the remaining ten being normal. 2 Following 12 weeks' treatment of hypertension with the object of reducing the supine BP to 150/90 mmHg or below, there was a reduction of wall thickness so that only two of the eight continued to show ASH. 3 The six patients with symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy also showed a significant reduction in the thickness of the septum and the posterior wall. Those with normal echocardiograms did not change. 4 This reduction of wall thickness produced by antihypertensive therapy may represent regression of left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "29": "1 Nadolol excretion was studied in 24 patients with chronic renal failure. 2 The amount of nadolol excreted during the 120-h period after receiving the drug ranged from less than 1% in functionally anephric, patients up to 11.5% in patients with average creatinine clearance of 57.9 +/- 3.6 ml/min/1.73 m2. 3 Renal clearance of nadolol was found to correlate with creatinine clearance; nadolol elimination is retarded in patients with renal failure. 4 Nadolol serum half-life is prolonged in proportion to the remaining renal function. Therefore, dosage intervals in renal patients receiving nadolol should be adjusted to creatinine clearance. 5 Haemodialysis effectively reduced serum concentration of the drug; it may therefore be a useful therapy for drug intoxication.", 
    "30": "1 Nadolol was administered intravenously to five hypertensive patients and three healthy volunteers in balance on a 10 mEq sodium intake. 2 Nadolol (0.3-10.0 micrograms/kg) induced a significant, dose-related increase in renal blood flow, measured with radioxenon, with a maximum increase of 72 +/- 4 ml/100g/min (26%) at 3.0 micrograms/kg. 3 Heart rate and plasma renin activity decreased significantly over the same dose range. 4 The renal vascular response to nadolol contrasts sharply with those found with other beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agents. 5 The magnitude of the increase in renal blood flow, its time-course and the parallel fall in plasma renin activity raise the possibility that the renal vasodilation reflects the reversal of angiotensin's influence on the renal arterial bed.", 
    "31": "1 The regulation of renin secretion is mediated by way of adrenoceptors. The role of alpha-adrenoceptors remains controversial, whereas it is generally accepted that activation of beta-adrenoceptors stimulates renin and their blockade suppresses renin. 2 Although experimental renin regulation appears to be a beta 2-receptor function, clinical studies suggest that in man it is a beta 1 effect. 3 beta-Adrenoceptor-blocking agents are effective antihypertensive agents, but have variable effects on renin secretion; this variability may be attributable to different degrees of instrinsic partial beta-agonistic activity and/or different receptor or organ selectivity of various compounds. 4 Antihypertensive effectiveness seems unrelated in magnitude or timing to the baseline levels or the changes of plasma renin activity for the majority of beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs.", 
    "32": "1 The stepped care approach for the treatment of hypertension was adopted in a study at Ain Shams Hospital using hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) and a new beta-blocker, nadolol. Sixty mild to moderately hypertensive patients were studied for 20 weeks (2 weeks no antihypertendive the therapy, 3 weeks placebo, 3 weeks HCT, 4 weeks nadolol + HCT dose titration and 8 weeks nadolol + HCT maintenance). The dose of HCT was 50 mg once daily throughout the study except for six patients who had their HCT dose increased to 100 mg daily during maintenance. The dose of nadolol ranged from 40-240 mg daily. 2 No patient on HCT monotherapy achieved full control of his supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP less than 90 mm Hg). On combined therapy, 55 patients (91.7%) showed a full response, whereas the remaining five patients a good or adequate response. 3 Thirty-two of these patients agreed to continue in the study for a further 21 months (totalling 2 yr of therapy). To date, 15 of them have completed a total of 10 months, 7 have completed 11 months and 10 have completed 12 months. The delta percentage decrease in supine BP continued to be 28.0 and 19.5 for systolic and diastolic BPs respectively. 4 No significant changes in funduscopies, chest X-rays, ECGs, or full laboratory investigations were noted. A few side-effects of mild nature occurred. None necessitated discontinuation of therapy. 5 Combined therapy with nadolol and HCT is a safe and effective method of controlling hypertension over extended periods.", 
    "33": "1 Patients with borderline (group I) and sustained hypertension (group II) were treated with beta-blocking drugs, diuretics and the combination of both. In the two groups of patients the antihypertensive effectiveness of both short-term intravenous or chronically oral propranolol was directly related to the extent to which the drug produced an absolute reduction in plasma renin activity (PRA). No such a correlation could be obtained with pindolol. In group I following beta-blockade, day-night profiles of PRA were similar to those observed in group II before treatment. Thus, in this latter subgroup, low renin profiles might reflect reduced beta-adrenergic activity. 2 When the chronically beta-blockaded patients were changed to chronic diuretic therapy it became evident that young hypertensive patients of group II showed a more pronounced BP response than the patients of group I. In those patients of group II in whom pressure was not controlled by the diuretic alone, combination with a beta-blocker led to pressure normalization. 3 The beta-blocking drug induced reduction in pressure was greater in the 25-35 yr olds, than in those older than 55. In contrast, the antihypertensive effect of the diuretic was more pronounced in the 55-70 yr olds than in those younger than 40. 4 It is concluded that sympathetic nervous system activity mainly determined PRA as well as antihypertensive effectiveness of both the beta-blockers and the diuretics. As to outpatient management it is proposed that with exception of young borderline hypertensives who seem to respond best to beta-blockers, initial antihypertensive drug therapy may consist of a diuretic agent. If the antihypertensive effect of the diuretic is insufficient, combination with a beta-blocking drug could be used to achieve the best effect.", 
    "34": "1 In the United States, the thiazide diuretics are considered the cornerstone of all antihypertensive regimens for four reasons: by themselves, they are capable of controlling the blood pressure in 60-70% of the hypertensive population; they prevent the sodium retention produced by all other antihypertensive agents; they can be given once a day; and they are inexpensive. 2 Despite these advantages, the thiazide do cause hypokalaemia hyperuricaemia and hyperglycaemia. The incidence of hypokalaemia (K less than 3.0 mEq/l) is only 2-4%; the incidence of hyperuricaemia (uric acid greater than 10 mg per cent is 3-4%; and the incidence of hyperglycaemia is 1-2%. 3 The possibility that a beta-blocking agent combined with a thiazide diuretic might produce better BP control, prevent thiazide-induced abnormalities and exert a coronary prevention action with once daily administration would suggest that such a combination should be the ideal initial therapy for most patients with hypertension.", 
    "35": "1 Cardioselective and non-selective beta-blockers affect to a different degree several aspects of the circulatory homeostasis. The evidence available in this regard has been evaluated and the possible clinical importance of these differences has been discussed. 2 Venous return in partly regulated by beta-receptors (possibly of the beta 2 type) in the venous resistance vessels. Differences in blockade of venous return by the two classes of beta-blockers may, therefore, influence the degree of increase in left ventricular size, left ventricular end diastolic BPs and stroke volume during beta-blockade. 3 At the first part of the dose-reponse curve, non-selective beta-blockers seem to block more effectively renin release than cardioselective beta-blockers. 4 The direction and the extent to which beta-blockers 'directly' affect total peripheral resistance (TPR), is determined by the resultant of the degree of decrease in TPR by blockade of renin release and the extent of the increase in TPR by blockade of the beta 2-receptors in the arteriolar wall. 5 The clinical relevance of these differences could be that--especially in the low doses range--non-selective beta-blockers may be more 'safe' in patients with compromised cardiac function and may be more appropriate for the therapy of high renin hypertension than cardioselective blockers, whereas the latter may be more appropriate for the majority of hypertensive patients who have low to normal renin hypertension.", 
    "36": "1 The effect of single oral doses of six beta-receptor antagonists on exercise-induced changes in double product (systolic blood pressure x heart rate) were studied in 25 human volunteers. 2 Three doses of propranolol, nadolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, timolol and atenolol were selected for study on the basis of in vivo beta-blocking potency. 3 Although all beta-blockers studied reduced the double product response to exercise, the pharmacodynamics of this effect differed markedly. 4 Pharmacodynamic half-lives, estimated for the drug tested, were 39 h for nadolol, atenolol 21 h, timolol 15 h, oxprenolol 13 h, propranolol 11 and pindolol 8 h. 5 These results suggest that the clinical choice of a beta-blocker with the least problems of compliance can be made on the basis of pharmacodynamics as well as pharmacological profile.", 
    "37": "1 Improvement in physical performance, based on exercise tolerance, self-assessed work and physician-rated functional capacities, is proposed as a measure of efficacy of anti-anginal therapy in the rehabilitation of the cardiac patient. 2 Improved physical performance parallels changes in frequency of anginal attacks and a nitroglycerin requirements following beta-blocker therapy. 3 Nadolol (a beta-blocker), given once daily is as effective as propranolol, given four times daily as an anti-anginal agent.", 
    "38": "An increase in serum uric acid levels has been observed both during treatment with diuretics and beta-blockers. The increase during treatment with beta-blockers seems in most cases to be of no clinical importance and is not a reason for serum uric acid determinations of subjects who have no symptoms indicating hyperuricaemia. During treatment with diuretics in those doses which have been commonly used previously, e.g. hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone greater than or equal to 50 mg/d, an increase on an average of about 90 mumol/l is to be expected. When low-dose diuretics are used (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone less than or equal to 25 mg/d) about half of this increase might be anticipated. It is recommended that serum uric acid levels should be studied after starting antihypertensive treatment with diuretics.", 
    "39": "A reversible deterioration of the oral glucose tolerance has been reported in subjects with initially impaired glucose tolerance when starting to take oral diuretics. This does not seem to be the case in subjects with an initially unimpaired glucose tolerance. A deterioration in the diabetic state is commonly seen when diuretics are given to subjects with clinical diabetes. Our knowledge about the effect of beta-blockers on the glucose tolerance is limited. As for diuretics there seems to be an overrepresentation of diabetics among subjects taking beta-blockers. This overrepresentation can probably be explained by an association between diabetes and disturbances in which diuretics and beta-blockers are commonly used such as arterial hypertension and ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "40": "Twenty-one patients developed Raynaud's phenomenon during treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. The vasospastic symptoms were obviously related to the treatment, but their pathogenesis is still controversial. A decrease in cardiac output might explain the phenomenon. According to our very preliminary data an alpha-adrenergic dominance caused by a direct effect on the peripheral circulation seems more probable. Vasospastic symptoms may arise after treatment with both cardioselective and non-selective beta blocking agents. Cautious prescription of beta blocking drugs to patients with preexisting peripheral vascular disease is recommended.", 
    "41": "Following the recovery of intestinal peristaltic movements in medium and advanced age patients in whom major surgery had been performed, after an adequate preparation with and blocking agents, as compared with the control group, a shortening was noted, of the intestinal paresis period in both age groups. The early recovery of intestinal transit had positive effects on the postoperative evolution of the patients, especially in the aged ones, and allowed for an early resumption of oral alimentation, reducing abdominal meteorization, as well as the number and the severity of local and general complications."
