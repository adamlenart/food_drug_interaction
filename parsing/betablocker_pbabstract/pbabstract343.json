In this study, we investigated the effect of thrombin on interleukin-6 (IL-6) synthesis in these cells. Thrombin stimulated IL-6 synthesis dose-dependently in the range between 0.01 and 1 U/ml. The depletion of extracellular Ca2+ by EGTA suppressed the thrombin-induced IL-6 synthesis. TMB-8, an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, also inhibited the IL-6 synthesis by thrombin. Propranolol, a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase inhibitor, enhanced the IL-6 synthesis by thrombin. Calphostin C, a highly potent and specific inhibitor for protein kinase C, significantly amplified the IL-6 synthesis by thrombin. The thrombin-induced IL-6 synthesis was enhanced in PKC down-regulated MC3T3-E1 cells. These results strongly suggest that thrombin stimulates IL-6 synthesis, which depends on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization mainly from extracellular space in osteoblasts, and that the IL-6 synthesis by thrombin is regulated due to thrombin-activated protein kinase C through phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D.", 
    "1": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a commonly used treatment modality for patients with major affective disorders that are unresponsive to pharmacological therapy. While ECT has been shown to be a very safe treatment, it is associated with transient hemodynamic alterations, including hypertension, which are associated with an increased risk of rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. We describe our use of the ultrashort acting beta-blocker, esmolol, for blood-pressure control in a woman with known cerebral aneurysmal disease who required ECT for treatment of recurrent major depression.", 
    "2": "Contact with unfamiliar conspecifics (social stress) caused hens to delay oviposition. These delays were prevented by propranolol (10 mg/kg), suggesting that beta-adrenergic receptors are involved in their physiological causation.", 
    "3": "The central action of human adrenomedullin (AM) to influence gastric emptying and the peripheral mechanisms involved were studied in conscious rats. The 20-min rate of gastric emptying of a methylcellulose solution was assessed after intracisternal (i.c.) injection of AM or rat alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide (alphaCGRP). AM and alphaCGRP dose-dependently inhibited gastric emptying with i.c. ED50 values of 120 and 100 pmol, respectively. Human proadrenomedullin N-terminal 20 peptide (150-600 pmol, i.c.) and AM (150 pmol, i.v.) had no effect. The inhibitory actions of AM and alphaCGRP (150 pmol, i.c.) were completely blocked by the CGRP antagonist, human CGRP-(8-37) injected i.c. at 30 microg, but not at 15 microg. The CRF antagonist, [D-Phe12,Nle(21,38),C(alpha)MeLeu37]CRF-(12-41) (10 microg/rat) injected i.c. prevented i.c. rat/human CRF (150 pmol)-induced 53% inhibition of gastric emptying while not modifying the effect of AM. The action of AM (150 pmol, i.c.) was abolished by bilateral adrenalectomy or the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.p.), but was not altered by indomethacin (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. These results indicate that i.c. AM and alphaCGRP equipotently inhibit gastric emptying through mechanisms similarly antagonized by a high dose of CGRP-(8-37). The central AM action is mediated through adrenal-dependent, beta-adrenergic pathways independently from activation of central CRF receptors.", 
    "4": "The present study addresses the function of T-type voltage-gated calcium channels in insulin-secreting cells. We used whole-cell voltage and current recordings, capacitance measurements, and RIA techniques to determine the contribution of T-type calcium channels in modulation of electrical activity and in stimulus-secretion coupling in a rat insulin secreting cell line, INS-1. By employing a double pulse protocol in the current-clamp mode, we found that activation of T-type calcium channels provided a low threshold depolarizing potential that decreased the latency of onset of action potentials and furthermore increased the frequency of action potentials, both of which are abolished by administration of nickel chloride (NiCl2), a selective T-type calcium channel blocker. Moreover application of high frequency stimulation, as compared with low frequency stimulation, caused a greater change in membrane capacitance (deltaCm), suggesting higher insulin secretion. We demonstrated that glucose stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1 is reduced dose dependently by NiCl2. We conclude that T-type calcium channels facilitate insulin secretion by enhancing the general excitability of these cells. In light of the pathological effects of both hypo and hyperinsulinemia, the T-type calcium channel may be a therapeutic target.", 
    "5": "In mammals and birds the characteristics of alpha1 adrenergic receptors and their biological role in liver metabolism have been clearly described, although the predominance of receptor subtypes varies with species. In contrast, the actual presence of hepatic alpha1 adrenergic receptors in fish, amphibians, and reptiles has been questioned. Only recently has their existence been demonstrated in some fish species and also in the wood frog Rana sylvatica. The present study assessed the presence of alpha1 adrenergic binding sites on hepatic membranes of frogs, toads, lizards, and turtles using the specific alpha1 adrenergic receptor antagonist [3H]prazosin; for comparison, the binding of the specific beta adrenergic receptor antagonist [3H]CGP-12177A was evaluated in the same preparations. alpha1 Adrenergic receptors are indeed present in the liver of the ectotherms examined. Specific binding is saturable, reversible, and linear as a function of tissue concentration. The binding data indicated the presence of two classes of binding sites displaying high and low affinities with Kds in the nanomolar and micromolar ranges, respectively. The present study provides the first evidence for the presence of alpha1 adrenergic receptors in the liver of toad, lizard, and turtle while confirming their existence in another species of frog, Rana esculenta.", 
    "6": "Betaxolol ophthalmic solution has been associated with periocular skin hyperpigmentation. We report a case of a woman with hyperpigmentation of the fingers associated with oral betaxolol. Based on case reports associated with the topical ophthalmic product, we believe the hyperpigmentation was likely caused by oral betaxolol.", 
    "7": "The effects of thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones on the expression of the Kv1.5 potassium channel gene were studied in the rat left ventricle. Rats were rendered hypothyroid by oral administration of methimazole (MMI). Hyperthyroidism was induced in the MMI-treated rats by administration of L-thyroxine (T4). Kv1.5 mRNA levels decreased markedly in the hypothyroid rats, whereas they increased in the hyperthyroid rats. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, did not inhibit the T4-dependent increase in Kv1.5 mRNA, indicating that the increase is not due to the increased beta-adrenergic stimuli under hyperthyroidism. Accordingly, treatment of the MMI-treated hypothyroid rats with isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, did not increase the mRNA. The Kv1.5 mRNA levels positively correlated with the thyroid hormone levels in sera. When rats were adrenalectomized and rendered hypothyroid, Kv1.5 mRNA become undetectable. Administration of 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) at a dose to induce hyperthyroidism did not restore the mRNA level. However, T3 significantly increased the mRNA level when dexamethasone was co-administered at a physiological dose. These results for the first time demonstrate that thyroid hormone up-regulates Kv1.5 mRNA levels in the rat left ventricle and they demonstrate that glucocorticoid is required for this induction.", 
    "8": "Pigeons were trained to discriminate 0.64 mg/kg (high dose) of 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-(2-di-n-propylamino)tetralin) from saline or were retrained to discriminate 0.16 mg/kg (low dose) of 8-OH-DPAT from saline. This resulted in a decrease of the ED50 for recognition of the 8-OH-DPAT cue from 0.14 to 0.04 mg/kg. Partial agonists for the 5-HT1A receptor (e.g., buspirone) were generalized fully in the low dose condition, but only partially in the high dose condition. Full antagonists, such as N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY-100635), antagonized the 8-OH-DPAT cue in both groups without producing generalization in either group. (-)-Pindolol produced full generalization in the low dose group, but antagonized the high dose stimulus cue. The behavioral effects of other compounds with 5-HT1A receptor activities (4-iodo-N-[2-[4-(methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-pyridinyl-benz ami de hydrochloride (p-MPPI): (-)-1-(1H-indol-4-yloxy)-3-(cyclohexylamino)-2-propanol maleate ((-)-LY206130); racemic pindolol and idazoxan) also differed between groups. Comparing results obtained using differing training doses in the drug discrimination paradigm simplifies determination of the full agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist properties of compounds.", 
    "9": "The central nervous system has high-affinity uptake systems for the clearance of amino acid transmitters. These systems are found in both neurons and astrocytes. Previous studies have shown that the uptake of amino acid transmitters by astrocytes in culture can be modulated by adrenergic agents. The objectives of this study were to develop a methodology that evaluates the brain's reuptake capacity for glutamate in awake, behaving animals and to determine whether glutamate reuptake is under alpha-adrenergic regulation in the intact central nervous system. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-450 g were used in this study. The extraction fraction of L-[3H]glutamate with [14C]mannitol as a reference was measured. The cortical extraction fraction of L-[3H]glutamate corrected for [14C]mannitol (EL-glu) reaches steady state rapidly and is both stable and repeatable. EL-glu is a measure of L-glutamate reuptake and not metabolism. EL-glu is decreased in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of the glutamate reuptake blocker D,L-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartic acid or unlabeled L- glutamate. In addition, EL-glu is increased in a dose-dependent manner by the alpha1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine, and this increase is blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine.", 
    "10": "Studies under blockade of alpha-, beta1-, and beta2-adrenoreceptors revealed a good correlation between the responses of rat colon relaxation of depolarized tonus and of rat adipocyte lipolysis elicited by catecholamines or BRL-37344, a selective beta3-adrenoreceptor agonist, suggesting beta3-adrenoreceptor stimulation. In contrast, SM-11044, a nonselective beta-adrenoreceptor agonist, stimulated colon relaxation more efficiently than lipolysis; its effects were differently antagonized by cyanopindolol with pA2 values of 8.31 in colon and of 7.32 in adipocytes. Binding studies in rat colon smooth muscle membranes using [125I]iodocyanopindolol under blockade of adrenaline and serotonin receptors revealed the existence of a single class of sites (Kd = 11.0 nM, Bmax = 716.7 fmol/mg protein). The specific binding was saturable and reversible and was displaced by SM-11044 but not by BRL-37344, isoproterenol, noradrenaline, adrenaline, serotonin, nor dopamine. This binding site was photoaffinity labeled using [125I]iodocyanopindolol-diazirine. The labeling was prevented by SM-11044 but not by BRL-37344. The amino-terminal amino acid sequences of the high performance liquid chromatography-purified peptides generated by enzymatic and chemical cleavages of the affinity labeled 34-kDa protein confirmed that the novel iodocyanopindolol or SM-11044 binding protein of rat colon smooth muscle membranes is different from known adrenaline, serotonin, or dopamine receptors. Its functional role might include the relaxation of depolarized colon.", 
    "11": "Five placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-design studies were performed to evaluate the antianginal and anti-ischemic characteristics of the novel T-channel-selective calcium antagonist, mibefradil, in the treatment of patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. Of the 5 studies, 2 were monotherapy dose-finding trials and 3 were conducted in patients receiving background antianginal therapy: either beta blockers (2 studies) or long-acting nitrates (1 study). A total of 865 patients were randomized to 1 of 4 mibefradil dose groups (25, 50, 100, and 150 mg; n = 565) and placebo (n = 300). The antianginal and anti-ischemic effects of mibefradil were assessed across all 5 studies by evaluating exercise tolerance test variables, weekly number of anginal attacks and short-acting nitroglycerin consumption, and in both dose-finding studies, the number and total duration of silent ischemic episodes (48-hour Holter monitoring). A statistically significant increase in exercise duration was achieved in 3 of 5 studies with the 50-mg dose of mibefradil and in 3 of 3 studies with the 100-mg dose of the compound over the effects observed in the placebo groups. A significant delay in time to onset of ischemia during exercise was induced in all studies with the 50- and 100-mg doses of mibefradil. The 25-mg dose of mibefradil was not significantly better than placebo, and the effects of the 150-mg dose of the compound were similar to those observed with the 100-mg dose. Across all studies, a dose-related decrease was observed in the number of weekly anginal attacks and in weekly nitroglycerin consumption. Similarly, a significant dose-related decrease in the number and duration of silent ischemic episodes was observed during Holter monitoring for 48 hours in the 2 dose-finding studies. The antianginal and anti-ischemic effects were associated with a dose-related decrease in heart rate and double product both at rest and at exercise termination. Treatment with the 50- and 100-mg doses of mibefradil was found to be well tolerated and safe compared with placebo, a finding that held true for patients on chronic beta-blocker or long-acting nitrate therapy. Taken together, these studies indicate that mibefradil is an effective and well-tolerated once-daily treatment for chronic stable angina pectoris at doses of 50 and 100 mg, which are the lowest and highest effective doses of the compound, respectively.", 
    "12": "Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has thus far not been applied in patients with atrial fibrillation, probably because of the presumed absence of any form of patterning of the ventricular rhythm, particularly vagally mediated respiratory arrhythmia. However, such patterning is theoretically conceivable given the function of the atrioventricular node in atrial fibrillation and its susceptibility to autonomic influences.", 
    "13": "Sixteen patients (mean age, 56+/-4 years) with long-term atrial fibrillation on fixed doses of digoxin or verapamil were studied; 12 healthy men in sinus rhythm were used as control subjects. HRV (standard deviation of RR intervals [SD], coefficient of variance [CV], the root-mean-square of successive difference [RMSSD], and low-frequency [LF] and high-frequency power [HF]) was analyzed during 500 RR intervals at baseline, after administration of propranolol (0.2 mg/kg I.V.), and after subsequent administration of methylatropine (0.02 mg/kg I.V.). HRV at baseline and changes in HRV after methylatropine were then related to vagal tone (vagal cardiac control), quantified as the decrease in mean RR after methylatropine. Baseline HRV was higher in the atrial fibrillation group than in the control group; after propranolol, HRV increased in both groups; after methylatropine, HRV neared zero in the control group, whereas it returned to baseline values in the atrial fibrillation group. SD, RMSSD, LF, and HF at baseline were significantly (P<.05) correlated with vagal tone in the control group but also in the atrial fibrillation group (correlation coefficients of .60, .61, .57, and .64, respectively). Even stronger correlations were observed between changes in these parameters after methylatropine and vagal tone, particularly in the atrial fibrillation group (correlation coefficients of .89, .87, .72, and .90, respectively).",

    "18": "The role of protein kinase C (PKC) in histamine (HA)-stimulated cyclic AMP formation in intact chick pineal glands was investigated. In the pineal gland of chick HA, 2-methylHA, 4-methylHA, and N alpha, N alpha-dimethylHA potently increased cyclic AMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment of intact glands with PKC inhibitors, i.e. chelerythrine and stautosporine, reduced the stimulatory effect of the HA-ergic compounds on cyclic AMP formation. HA, 2-methylHA, 4-methylHA, and N alpha, N alpha-dimethylHA significantly increased inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) levels in intact chick pineal glands, indicating their activities on phospholipase C and 1,2-diacylglycerol formation. The stimulatory effect of HA on IP3 levels was antagonized by aminopotentidine, a potent blocker of H2-like HA receptors in avian pineal gland. Preincubation of chick pineal glands with a PKC activator, 4 beta-phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate (4 beta-PDB), enhanced the accumulation of cyclic AMP elicited by HA, 2-methylHA, 4-methylHA, and N alpha, N alpha-dimethylHA. On the other hand, 4 beta-phorbol, inactive on the PKC, was ineffective. Our results point to the possibility that PKC is involved in the regulation by HA of cyclic AMP synthesis in the pineal gland of chick. Furthermore, the cyclic AMP response to pineal HA receptor stimulation can be positively modulated by a concomitant activation of the PKC pathway.", 
    "19": "We have shown previously that the stem cell factor (SCF) receptor undergoes phosphorylation on serine residues following ligand stimulation, and that this phopshorylation is dependent mainly on the activity of protein kinase C (PKC). In the present study, we have further investigated the molecular mechanisms behind SCF-stimulated activation of PKC, and found that SCF does not activate phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. In contrast, phospholipase D (PLD) is activated in response to SCF in a dose-dependent manner. Activation of PLD was not inhibited by calphostin C, an inhibitor of PKC. On the other hand, inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol PtdIns 3'-kinase (PtdIns 3'-kinase), i.e. wortmannin and LY294002, inhibited SCF-induced PLD activation. Moreover, a mutant SCF receptor in which Tyr721, which is responsible for activation of PtdIns 3'-kinase, is mutated to a phenylalanine residue was unable to mediate activation of PLD. Thus, PtdIns 3'-kinase appears to be essential for SCF-induced PLD activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phosphatidic acid (PtdH), generated through the action of PLD in response to SCF, is metabolized to diacylglycerol by dephosphorylation. Diacylglycerol can then activate PKC, and, moreover, after deacylation by a diacylglycerol lipase, yield arachidonic acid, an important second messenger in cell signaling.", 
    "20": "An improved, more efficient method for the determination of metoprolol and its two metabolites in human urine is reported. The simultaneous analysis of the zwitterionic metoprolol acidic metabolite (III, H117/04) with the basic metabolites alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (II, H119/66), metoprolol (I) and guanoxan (IV, internal standard) was achieved employing solid-phase extraction and isocratic reversed-phase HPLC. The analytes were extracted from urine (100 microliters) using C18 solid-phase extraction cartridges (100 mg), and eluted with aqueous acetic acid (0.1%, v/v)-methanol mixture (40:60, v/v, 1.2 ml). The eluents were concentrated (250 microliters) under vacuum, and aliquots (100 microliters) were analysed by HPLC with fluorescence detection at 229 nm (excitation) and 309 nm (emission) using simple isocratic reversed-phase HPLC (Novapak C18 radial compression cartridge, 4 microns, 100 x 5 mm I.D.). Acetonitrile-methanol-TEA/phosphate buffer pH 3.0 (9:1:90, v/v) was employed as the eluent (1.4 ml/min). All components were fully resolved within 18 min, and the calibration curves for the individual analytes were linear (r2 > or = 0.996) within the concentration range of 0.25-40.0 mg/ml. Recoveries for all four analytes were greater than 76% (n = 4). The assay method was validated with intra-day and inter-day variations less than 2.5%.",

Pharmacologic stress imaging with thallium or echocardiography probably improves risk stratification for intermediate-risk patients having vascular surgery. These tests have not been shown to be effective prognostic indicators for patients having nonvascular surgery. No studies of angiography for risk prediction have been reported. Decision analyses and retrospective series suggest that the risks incurred by doing coronary angiography and revascularization before elective surgery outweigh the benefits. Prospective, controlled studies of coronary revascularization are lacking. Evidence from a randomized, controlled trial has shown a survival benefit with the perioperative use of beta-blockers in patients at risk for coronary artery disease.", 
    "25": "Evaluation of all surgical patients by use of clinical indices is recommended. Low-risk patients need no further evaluation before surgery. High-risk patients need optimal management of their high-risk problems, including (if appropriate) beta-blocker use, and may need to have their elective procedures canceled. Intermediate-risk patients probably benefit from further noninvasive stress testing, especially if they are having vascular surgery. Further clinical trials are needed for most areas of concern.", 
    "26": "It has been shown that adrenal progesterone plays an important role in regulating the negative feedback of oestrogen on luteinizing hormone (LH) release in ovariectomized and oestrogen-treated rats. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether adrenal progesterone modulation of LH secretion is mediated by adrenergic and opioidergic systems in ovariectomized and oestrogen-treated rats. Oestradiol benzoate (20 micrograms/rat) was given s.c. to ovariectomized rats on day 0. Control animals were injected with the vehicle alone. The specific adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin (10 mg/kg), idazoxan (100 micrograms/kg), metoprolol (10 mg/kg) or ICI 118,551 (200 micrograms/kg) were injected at 12.00 and 20.00 h on day 2 and at 08.00 h on day 3 to oestrogen-primed rats treated or not with RU486. Control animals were injected with saline. RU486 (10 mg/kg) was administered s.c. at 08.00 h on day 3 to oestradiol-treated animals receiving adrenoceptor antagonists or saline. Naloxone (2 mg/kg) was administered i.p. 30 min before blood-sampling to oestrogen-primed rats treated or not with RU486. All groups were blood-sampled at 13.00 and 18.00 h on day 3, and LH concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay. The administration of oestradiol to ovariectomized rats decreased serum LH levels at 13.00 and 18.00 h on day 3. Prazosin or idazoxan partially prevented the effect of oestradiol at 13.00 h, while metoprolol, ICI 118,551 or naloxone totally blocked the inhibitory effect of oestradiol on LH secretion; both adrenoceptor and opioid receptor antagonists also prevented the effect of oestrogen on LH concentration at 18.00 h. RU486 increased serum LH concentration at 18.00 h in oestrogen-primed rats to values higher than in ovariectomized control rats, with no effect at noon. The administration of prazosin to ovariectomized and oestrogen-primed rats treated with RU486 prevented this increase while the other adrenoceptor antagonists or naloxone increased serum LH concentrations at 18.00 h. The present study shows that RU486 switches the feedback of oestradiol on LH secretion from negative to positive in ovariectomized and oestradiol-primed rats, activating a stimulatory alpha 1-adrenergic pathway during the afternoon, and gives strong evidence about the participation of adrenal progesterone modulating neurotransmitter systems involved in the secretion of LH. It also supports the participation of endogenous opioid peptides in the negative feedback of oestradiol, suggesting that the inhibitory tone of endogenous opioid peptide is active regardless the action of adrenal progesterone.", 
    "27": "Pathogen-triggered generation of reactive oxidants, termed the oxidative burst, contributes to disease resistance in both plant and animal kingdoms. Since phospholipase D plays a key role in the neutrophil oxidative burst signaling cascade and is highly abundant in plants, we investigated its participation in the plant oxidative burst. Thin layer chromatography of extracted phospholipids revealed no changes in phosphatidic acid levels in soybean cells undergoing oxidant production, and no changes in phosphatidyl-ethanol biosynthesis could be detected when ethanol was present during elicitation. An inhibitor of phosphatidic acid hydrolase, propranolol, did not modify burst parameters or phosphatidic acid levels during the burst, suggesting our inability to detect phosphatidic acid accumulation was not due to rapid elimination. Furthermore, exogenous phosphatidic acid did not elicit a burst or enhance elicitor-stimulated bursts. Finally, ethanol, a substitute nucleophile, did not abrogate the burst. With data showing the presence of phospholipase D in soybean cells, these data argue that soybean phospholipase D does not participate in signaling the oxidative burst. This constitutes the first major difference between the plant and animal oxidative burst signal transduction pathways.", 
    "28": "Previous studies have shown that propranolol, an effective mainstay for angina pectoris and unstable angina, can induce coronary arterial spasm in patients with variant angina. However, no report has yet associated it with painless Prinzmetal's ST elevation in patients without a history of variant angina. The present communication describes such an unusual and negligible case after propranolol overdose. Coronary arterial spasm can be induced by beta-blocker, not only in patients with variant angina but also in normal persons.", 
    "29": "This study compares the antihypertensive and lipid modifying effects of treatment of mild to moderate hypertension with celiprolol or atenolol. It also models the 5-year cardiovascular risk reduction and the cost effectiveness of monotherapy from a partial societal perspective. The effects of celiprolol and atenolol on systolic blood pressure (SBP), total serum cholesterol (TC) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were obtained from a pooled analysis of published studies. Although celiprolol and atenolol had similar effects on SBP, celiprolol reduced the ratio of TC to HDL-C by 10.2% [95% confidence intervals (95% CI) -16.4%, -4.0%) but atenolol increased the ratio by 7.7% (95% CI of 3.4%, 12.0%). The 5-year absolute risks of an initial coronary or cerebrovascular event or cardiovascular death were computed for cohorts of patients treated with either agent or remaining untreated, using an accelerated failure time (AFT) model, based on Framingham Heart Study data. Inputs to the model were age, gender, smoking status, SBP, TC and HDL-C. The change in absolute risk was estimated using the changes in SBP and TC: HDL-C obtained from the pooled analysis. Average life-months gained by therapy were computed as differences between the Kaplan-Meier survival curves estimated from the model plus differences in 5-year cardiovascular death rates multiplied by average life expectancy obtained from life tables. Direct medical costs included drug treatment, and the costs of acute care for initial coronary and cerebrovascular events deferred by therapy over the 5-year treatment period. The model shows that in the lowest-risk base case (60-year-old men who are nondiabetic and nonsmokers with SBP of 160 mm Hg and a 5-year absolute cardiovascular risk of 12%), celiprolol (271 mg/day) is 2-fold more effective than atenolol (77.4 mg/day) in reducing coronary event risk, and equally effective in reducing cerebrovascular event risk. The number of individuals that would have to be treated for 5 years to avoid 1 coronary event is about 30 for celiprolol versus 70 for atenolol. Therapy with celiprolol yields more life-months and at current prices, the cost per life-year gained by therapy is significantly lower. Both drugs are cost effective by international standards in the treatment of patients with 5-year absolute cardiovascular risk greater than 10%, and are more cost effective in those patients at higher levels of absolute cardiovascular risk. The direct medical costs of treatment for 5 years with celiprolol are the same or slightly less than treatment with atenolol at the dosages used in the clinical trials, despite a 19% higher tablet price. Both drugs are more cost effective in patients at higher levels of absolute cardiovascular risk. These findings are sensitive to the drug dosages, tablet prices and the discount rate. Based on epidemiological and clinical data, replacing atenolol with celiprolol in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, but without overt cardiovascular disease, is predicted to have similar effects on stroke risk, but to be substantially more effective in reducing the risk of coronary events at no additional direct medical cost over a 5-year treatment period.", 
    "30": "Angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors attenuate cardiac hypertrophy and prolong survival in animal models and patients after myocardial infarction (MI). Considering the dual function of the ACE, the therapeutic efficacy of ACE inhibitors after MI implicates the renin-angiotensin system and/or the kallikrein-kinin system in the pathophysiology of postinfarction cardiac remodeling. We evaluated the role of kinins, and their potential contribution to the antiremodeling effects of ACE inhibition in this setting. Rats underwent coronary artery ligation followed by chronic B2 kinin receptor blockade with icatibant (HOE 140). Additional groups of MI rats were treated with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, alone or in combination with icatibant. B2 kinin receptor blockade enhanced the deposition of collagen (morphometric analysis) in the left ventricular interstitial space after MI, whereas markers of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (left ventricular weights and prepro-atrial natriuretic factor [ANF] expression) were not affected. Chronic ACE inhibition reduced collagen deposition and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy after MI. The inhibitory action of ACE inhibition on interstitial collagen was partially reversed by B2 kinin receptor blockade. However, B2 kinin receptor blockade did not attenuate the effects of ACE inhibition on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In conclusion, kinins inhibit the interstitial accumulation of collagen, but do not modulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy after MI. Kinins contribute to the reduction of myocardial collagen accumulation by ACE inhibition; however, the effects of ACE inhibition on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy are related to reduced generation of angiotensin II.", 
    "31": "Cardiac dysrhythmias are common during anesthesia and surgery. An important precipitating factor of clinically relevant arrhythmias is the introoperative use of epinephrine. Bradykinin acts as an endogenous cardioprotective substance because it suppresses ventricular dysrhythmias induced by ischemia. In this study, we investigated whether bradykinin has a protective effect, preventing the development of dysrhythmias after epinephrine infusion in rats. Because kinins are potent stimulators of the release of nitric oxide and prostaglandins from the endothelium, we investigated whether the protective effect of bradykinin is mediated by these 2 autacoids. Male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital had catheters placed into a carotid artery and both jugular veins. Arterial blood pressure and lead II of the electrocardiogram (ECG) were continuously monitored and recorded. After a steady state was achieved, 1 mg/kg enalapril, an inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme/kininase II, was given intravenously to all groups except the one treated with losartan. Bradykinin was infused at the initial rate of 0.5 microg/kg per min. Cardiac arrhythmia was induced with 7.5 microg/kg epinephrine intravenously. Dysrhythmia was assessed by counting the number of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), runs of ventricular tachycardia (V Tach), and missing beats during the first minute after epinephrine. In untreated, control rats, epinephrine caused 10.8 +/- 2.7 PVCs, 0.8 +/- 0.2 runs of V tach, and 11.6 +/- 7.4 missing beats/min. In rats pretreated with bradykinin, the same dose of epinephrine elicited 1.2 +/- 0.5 PVCs, no runs of V tach, and 0.4 +/- 0.4 missing beats/min. This beneficial effect of bradykinin was partially reversed by N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or indomethacin, and completely by L-NAME plus indomethacin or icatibant, but it was not affected by des-Arg9[Leu8]-bradykinin. We conclude that bradykinin, acting on the B2 receptor, attenuates epinephrine-induced dysrhythmia via a mechanism that involves the release of NO and prostaglandins. Although the mechanism is not clear, NO and prostaglandins may prevent epinephrine-induced dysrhythmia and protect the myocardium via a direct action on cardiac neurons.",

Eighty-seven patients were enrolled, 27 patients were not included because of the exclusion criteria, 30 patients were treated with verapamil and 30 patients with bisoprolol. During the 540 days of follow up period treadmill ergometry and dobutamine stress-test with SPECT investigation were performed two times.

All patients were instructed in a 1200 kcal (= 5040 kj) diet.", 
    "36": "Of a total of 136 patients aged 20-74 y, 112 completed the study protocol. Fluctuations in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were seen in all groups. The systolic blood pressure was reduced significantly (5.5 mmHg) in the patients treated with antihypertensive agents other than betablockers, plus E + C. In the other hypertensive groups the reduction in blood pressure was not significant. In normotensive patients treated with E + C, the systolic and the diastolic blood pressure declined significantly (4.4/3.9 mmHg). At the end of the treatment period heart rate had increased significantly (4.9 beats/min) in the group of normotensive patients treated with E + C. Blood pressure and heart rate measured by the patient at home showed similar fluctuations from baseline prior to and during treatment with E + C or placebo. A mean loss of weight of approximately 4 kg in 6 weeks was significant for all the groups. There was no significant difference between the groups during this short period of treatment. In 56% of the patients treated with E + C complaints/side-effects related to the medical treatment were found at questioning. Corresponding complaints occurred in 21% of the placebo treated patients. In the E + C treated group 7% dropped out due to side-effects. In the placebo group there were no drop-outs.",

At various times after training (0, 1.5, 3, 6 or 9 h for animals implanted in the hippocampus; 0 or 3 h for those implanted in the amygdala), they received infusions of 8-Br-cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) (1.25 micrograms/side), SKF38393 (7.5 micrograms/side), SCH23390 (0.5 microgram/side), norepinephrine ClH (0.3 microgram/side), timolol ClH (0.3 microgram/side), 8-HO-DPAT (2.5 micrograms/side), NAN-190 (2.5 micrograms/side), forskolin (0.5 microgram/side) or KT5720 (0.5 microgram/side). Rats were tested for retention 24 h after training. SKF38393 is an agonist and SCH23390 an antagonist at dopamine D1 receptors, timolol is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, 8-HO-DPAT is an agonist and NAN-190 an antagonist at 5HT1A receptors, forskolin enhances adenylyl cyclase, and KT5720 inhibits protein kinase A. When given into the hippocampus 0 h post-training, norepinephrine enhanced memory and KT5720 was amnestic. When given 1.5 h after training, all treatments were ineffective. When given 3 or 6 h post-training, 8-Br-cAMP, forskolin, SKF 38393, noradrenaline and NAN-190 caused memory facilitation, and KT5720, SCH23390, timolol and 8-HO-DPAT caused retrograde amnesia. At 9 h from training, all treatments were again ineffective. When given into the amygdala 0 or 3 h post-training all treatments were ineffective, except for noradrenaline at 0 h, which caused retrograde facilitation. The data agree with the suggestion that in the hippocampus, but not the amygdala, a cAMP/protein kinase A pathway is involved in memory consolidation at 3 and 6 h from training, and that this is regulated by D1, beta, and 5HT1A receptors. This correlates with a previous report of increased cAMP levels, protein kinase A activity and P-CREB levels at 3-6 h from training in rat hippocampus in this task. This may be taken to suggest that the hippocampus, but not the amygdala, is involved in the long-term storage of step-down inhibitory avoidance in the rat.",

Drugs for investigation were administered 2-4 weeks after the onset of AMI, and the subjects were followed up for a median period of 19 months. All patients were given aspirin 50 mg/day. The end points of observation were cardiac events and non-cardiac events. Cardiac events included sudden cardiac death (SCD), heart failure death, total cardiac deaths, and myocardial re-infarction.", 
    "41": "The clinical conditions of the three groups were compatible. Sixty-six cardiac events (6.0%) occurred. Comparing with group C, the rate of SCD decreased significantly by 68% in group A after atenolol treatment for 28 months. Both atenolol and enalapril significantly increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), whereas in group C the LVEF did not change during the follow-up period. There was obvious decreasing tendency of the survival curve in group C, compared with the other two groups. Totally drugs decrease one cardiac death 0/00/month. But the rate of myocardial re-infarction was the same in the three groups. No serious side effects on blood pressure or heart rate were observed.", 
    "42": "Both atenolol and enalapril (domestic products) are beneficial to the secondary prevention of SCD and heart failure death after AMI, but not to re-infarction. Both drugs should be continued for a prolonged period to be effective. Drugs given 2-4 weeks after acute stage are also effective, with no serious side effects.", 
    "43": "Salmeterol, a long-acting beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, also possesses some anti-inflammatory properties, but whether eosinophils are the target of such action has been equivocal. To clarify the direct effect of salmeterol on eosinophil functions, we have studied the effect of the drug on the various responses of purified human eosinophils. Superoxide anions (O2-) release and adherence to fibronectin-coated plastic plates induced by platelet-activating factor (PAF), interleukin-5 (IL-5), leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), as well as degranulation induced by C5a and formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (FMLP), in the presence of cytochalasin B (CB) were studied. In the concentration range 10(-8)-10(-5) M, the drug inhibited PAF- and IL-5-induced O2- release, with an IC50 values of 3.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(-7) M and 2.2 +/- 0.4 x 10(-6) M, respectively, Superoxide anion release by LTB4 was only modestly inhibited while that due to PMA was completely unaffected. On the other hand, eosinophil adherence induced by all the 4 stimuli were significantly inhibited within the same concentration range. On eosinophil degranulation, the drug failed to significantly inhibit the release of eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) induced by either C5a or FMLP. In contrast, beta-hexoseaminidase (beta-HA) release by the same agents was significantly inhibited, the inhibition being more pronounced for FMLP-induced, than C5a-induced release. None of the effects of the drug was reversed by the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551 at a concentration of 10(-7) M. These results show that salmeterol may have some direct inhibitory effects on human eosinophil functions but that these effects are both stimulus- and response-dependent, and are unlikely to be mediated via beta 2 adrenoceptors.",

    "45": "One hundred and fifty seven patients with recent myocardial infarction were routinely submitted to delayed (second week) catheterization. They also underwent systematic angioplasty of a significantly narrowed infarct-related artery with a suitable anatomy, or reopening of a totally occluded infarct-related artery, and repeat follow-up catheterization after 4 months. Changes in left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular volumes, and percent of regional hypokinesia were assessed over the study period.", 
    "46": "One hundred and thirty-two patients had two interpretable left ventriculograms and two interpretable coronary angiograms. At initial angiography, 56 out of 96 patients with a patent infarct-related artery were successfully submitted to percutaneous coronary angioplasty, of whom 25 had restenosis and eight had total reocclusion at follow-up angiography. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was not attempted in the remaining 40 patients due to unsuitable anatomy in 18 or a nonsignificant lesion in 22. The infarct-related artery was totally occluded in 36 patients at initial angiography, and successfully reopened by means of angioplasty in 19, of whom seven showed a reocclusion at follow-up angiography. The independent predictors of left ventricular enlargement, identified by means of multivariate regression analysis, were initial stroke volume index < 40 ml.m-2 (odds ratio = 6.3, 95% confidence interval = [2.5; 16.6]), initial end-systolic volume index > 50 ml.m-2 (odds ratio = 7.1, 95% confidence interval = [1.5; 25.8]), anterior infarct location (odds ratio = 4.1, 95% confidence interval = [1.4; 11.5]) and reocclusion of the infarct-related artery (odds ratio = 7.3, 95% confidence interval = [1.3; 27.3]). Angioplasty of a patent but significantly narrowed infarct-related artery was not found predictive.", 
    "47": "This study demonstrates that reocclusion of a previously open infarct-related artery, as well as the initial low stroke volume index, enlarged end-systolic volume index and anterior infarct location are independent predictors of long-term left ventricular enlargement. These results emphasize the impact of long-term sustained patency of the infarct-related artery on the prevention of left ventricular dysfunction. The need for a larger randomized trial is recognised.", 
    "48": "The outlook in heart failure patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy has improved dramatically over the past ten years. The availability of many excellent drugs apart from angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) has contributed to this. The best current survival rates reported are, however, in association with deliberate optimisation of haemodynamic parameters and incorporation of functional testing to monitor disease progression. These practises could well be adopted more widely in Australia and New Zealand. Surgical options for heart failure continue to expand, but apart from heart transplantation, remain somewhat experimental.", 
    "49": "Kinins, by an autocrine or paracrine hormonal action, are potent modulators of regional vasomotricity. Their effects on the renal circulation are not well defined. The aim of this study was to analyse the renal vascular response induced by bradykinin, to precise the type(s) of receptor involved and to evaluate the contribution of various peptidases in the local catabolism of the kinin. Experiments were performed on the isolated rat kidney, perfused in an open circuit, at a constant flow of 8 mL/min, with a Tyrode's solution. Vasodilator responses were evaluated after renal vascular tone had been restored by a continuous perfusion with prostaglandin F2 alpha. Infusion of bradykinin (0.1-30 nM) induced a concentration-dependent renal vasorelaxation. A maximal response of 39.5 +/- 2.8% (n = 32) reversion of the tone induced by prostaglandin F2 alpha (about 50% of the maximal response induced by acetylcholine on the same kidneys) was obtained at 30 nM. Bradykinin-induced vasodilatation was completely inhibited by HOE 140 (10 nM), a selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. At a supramaximal concentration of 300 nM, bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation was modulated by a concomitant vasoconstriction. A concentration-dependent vasoconstriction was also obtained with desArg9 bradykinin (1-8 microM), a selective agonist of the bradykinin B1 receptor. The inhibition of neutral endopeptidase by phosphoramidon (10 microM) or the inhibition of carboxypeptidase M by MGTPA (10 microM) did not modify the bradykinin-induced renal vasorelaxation. On the other hand, the inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme by lisinopril (1 microM) potentiated by about 32% the vasorelaxant response induced by 30 nM bradykinin (52.3 +/- 11.8% relaxation, n = 5, p < 0.05). Present results demonstrate that 1) bradykinin primarily evokes B2 receptor-linked renal vasodilatation, 2) bradykinin B1 receptors appear also to be present on the rat renal vasculature and 3) angiotensin 1 converting enzyme contributes to the local vascular catabolism of the kinin.", 
    "50": "Heart failure syndrome is initiated as the body's metabolic needs temporarily exceed the pumping capacity of the heart. In most cases, this phenomenon tends to occur during physical exercise. Although not always subjectively recognized, limited exercise capacity remains the clinical hallmark of congestive heart failure. It can be measured objectively as reduced skeletal muscle performance and maximal whole-body oxygen uptake, which are not necessarily explained by central haemodynamic abnormalities. In fact, the initial cardiac condition sets forth a series of peripheral adaptations that are potentially life-saving during acute decompensation but become disadvantageous and symptom-generating in stable heart failure. Inodilator drugs were theoretically ideal to revert the adverse haemodynamic crosstalk between the heart and periphery. However, these drugs failed to improve prognosis in congestive heart failure, whereas drugs that did so showed typically unimpressive haemodynamic effects. Exercise therapy has recently emerged as a safe and effective way to enhance physical performance and subjective well-being in congestive heart failure. A dual therapeutic approach is suggested, consisting of exercise training to improve the periphery and the use of cardioprotective drugs to limit cardiac cellular damage from neurohormonal activation.", 
    "51": "The effects of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist (beta 2 agonist) and cAMP on cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) and cell volume were studied in fetal distal lung epithelial cells. Both terbutaline (a specific beta 2 agonist, 10 microM) and dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP, 1 mM) increased [Ca2+]c in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the terbutaline-induced increase in [Ca2+]c was still observed, although the increase was transient. However, DBcAMP caused no significant change in [Ca2+]c. In the presence of 1 mM extracellular Ca2+, terbutaline and DBcAMP induced quinine (a blocker of K+ channel) sensitive cell shrinkage. However, in a Ca2(+)-free solution, terbutaline induced rapid cell shrinkage, followed by benzamil (a specific blocker of Na+ channel, an analogue of amiloride) sensitive transient cell swelling. In a Ca2(+)-free solution, DBcAMP induced benzamil-sensitive transient cell swelling without cell shrinkage. Taken together, our observations indicate that the beta 2 agonist induced an elevation of [Ca2+]c by increasing both a Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space and a Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores, whereas DBcAMP only stimulated Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space. Furthermore, it is suggested that terbutaline and DBcAMP activated benzamil-sensitive channels independently of an increase in [Ca2+]c.", 
    "52": "CP-80,633, a selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitor, potently reverses histamine bronchoconstriction in anesthetized guinea pigs (ED50 10 micrograms/kg) but only weakly relaxes histamine-constricted guinea pig trachea (EC50 137 microM). Using CP-80,633 as a prototype PDE4 inhibitor, we evaluated the hypothesis that bronchodilation induced by PDE4 inhibitors is not mediated by direct relaxation of airway smooth muscle. In anesthetized guinea pigs, a bronchodilatory dose of CP-80,633 did not increase plasma catecholamines, nor did propranolol pretreatment significantly alter the ability of CP-80,633 to reverse histamine bronchoconstriction. In an isolated organ system, the activity of bronchorelaxants may be attenuated by the lack of endogenous activators of adenylyl cyclase or by decreased levels of intracellular cyclic nucleotides. Pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, salbutamol, or the PDE3 inhibitor imazodan did not potentiate the bronchorelaxant ability of CP-80,633. Milrinone pretreatment increased the potency of CP-80,633 to relax carbachol-constricted tracheal rings, but only at concentrations where nonspecific effects have been reported. By comparing the bronchorelaxant abilities of PDE inhibitors in tracheal rings with or without epithelium, we determined that the epithelium did not serve as a barrier to drug penetration. In conclusion, CP-80,633 is a potent bronchodilator in vivo, whose activity is neither mediated by direct airway smooth muscle relaxation nor dependent upon endogenous catecholamines.", 
    "53": "Our previous study revealed that anaphylactic shock can be produced in WBB6F1-W/Wv (abbreviated as W/Wv) mice. Because they are congenitally deficient in mast cells, we are certain that some other cell types are involved as mediator sources. In the present study, with the aim of examining the role of circulatory granulocytes, the effect of monoclonal antibody to a mouse granulocyte antigen, Gr-1, upon active and passive anaphylactic shock was tested in W/Wv mice using several mast cell-bearing strains as references. An intravenous injection of 40 micrograms of anti-granulocyte antibody one day before the antigen challenge produced a marked decrease in neutrophils and nearly complete abolition of lethal shock in W/Wv mice regardless of the sensitizing method. Both prevention of shock and reduction of neutrophils lasted for three days after the treatment with the antibody but not for six days. From these results, a reasonable conclusion would be that circulating Gr-1+ cells (predominantly composed of neutrophils) are the major mediator source. Reference experiments using mast cell-bearing strains revealed that the suppressive effect of anti-granulocyte antibody was also observed against active anaphylactic shock in C3H/HeN mice but not against active and passive anaphylactic shock in the other mice.", 
    "54": "The effects of some noradrenergic agents, phenobarbitone, diazepam and phenytoin on seizures produced by propranolol were investigated in mice. Isoprenaline and DL-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS) effectively antagonized the seizures elicited by propranolol. Pargyline and imipramine significantly attenuated propranolol-induced seizures and also significantly potentiated the protecting effect of DOPS against the seizures. alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine, disulfiram and reserpine significantly potentiated propranolol-elicited seizures. However, DOPS significantly antagonized the seizure-potentiating effects of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, disulfiram and reserpine. Phenylephrine, clonidine, prazosin, idazoxan, phenobarbitone, diazepam and phenytoin did not significantly alter propranolol-induced seizures. These results suggest that propranolol-induced seizures in mice may involve a noradrenergic mechanism mediated via central beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "55": "The purpose of this study was to develop the surgical technique for internal mammary artery grafting on the beating heart. In 10 pigs, heart rate was reduced with esmolol (n = 5) or verapamil (n = 5). In addition, the anti-ischaemic and anti-arrhythmic potencies of these drugs were investigated. Haemodynamics, mechanical function and ischaemia-sensitive laboratory measurements were assessed perioperatively. There were no differences in pre-ischaemic data including ischaemic clamping time of the left anterior descending artery. At the end of ischaemia haemodynamic parameters were significantly lower in the esmolol-group (P < 0.05). In the verapamil-group, one pig died from ventricular fibrillation during ischaemia, and one showed fibrillation during reperfusion (P < 0.01). There were no differences in cardiac function or enzymes between the groups. Reduction of heart rate was provided by both drugs, but no conclusive evidence was provided with regard to additional anti-ischaemic and anti-arrhythmic protection.",

The Z isomers were kinetically favored and thermodynamically more stable. Isomerization to reach an equilibrium mixture of Z/E was observed for all pure isomers in buffers. Equilibration is much faster, however in biological fluids. Ocular administration of any of the oxime derivatives, delivers betaxolol specifically to the eye tissues, with the highest concentration in the iris ciliary body. Both BMO and BO, when applied topically, showed marked reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in normotensive rabbits. No effect on isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in rabbits and rats were observed, even after iv. administration. Very mild eye irritation, which was less than that of betaxolol hydrochloride, was observed particularly with BMO maleate, which is an excellent candidate for safe treatment of glaucoma.",

    "59": "The presence of atrial fibrillation in 20 members is demonstrated, although one of them was on sinus rhythm at the time of the study; 3 patients had left ventricular enlargement on the ECHO study; the clinical situation was good in all patients except two who died because of complications related to the arrythmia and a third patient that had a brain stroke. The patients received different treatments because they where controlled by different physicians; the possible lethal proarrythmic effect in such cases must be taken into account.", 
    "60": "Familiar atrial fibrillation is a very infrequent arrythmia, usually well tolerated, that follows a dominant autosomic hereditary pattern. The use of antiagregants is advised because of the risk of embolism, or the use of anticoagulants in the presence of associated risk factors. Electric cardioversion has been show not be useful. The possible proarrythmic effect of some antiarrythmic agents, used in the control of cardiac frequency, must be taken into account.", 
    "61": "The increased mortality among patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome has been explained in part by the increased incidence of pulmonary hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD). A decreased heart rate variability has been shown to be associated with an increased mortality as well. We therefore screened 53 patients for sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) and heart rate variability (HRV) during the sleeping period. Standard time domain parameters were compared in a univariate multifactorial model for patients with an oxygen desaturation index (ODI) of more or less than 5 including the factors CAD, diabetes and beta-blocker use. The percentage of differences between RR-intervals that differ more than 50 ms (pNN > 50: 9.0 +/- 11.1% vs 19.2 +/- 22.2%; p < 0.05) as well as the root mean square of these differences (rMSSD: 38.0 +/- 29.0 msec vs 59.2 +/- 51.5 msec; p < 0.05) were significantly decreased in patients with SRBD. These results favour HRV for inclusion in future risk stratification models in patients with sleep-related breathing disorders.", 
    "62": "We have recently shown that in vivo natural cytotoxicity is enhanced after chronic exercise in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In the present report, we have studied the duration of this augmentation and some possible mechanisms involved. Exercise consisted of voluntary running for 4-5 weeks, with the running distance ranging from 2.7-15.6 km day(-1) during the last week of running. In vivo cytotoxicity was measured as clearance of injected 51Cr-labelled YAC-1 lymphoma cells from the lungs. The in vivo natural cytotoxicity was increased in running SHRs, and also in SHRs that had their running wheel locked for 24 and 48 h prior to the experiment, and was still present after 96 h. The enhancement of in vivo cytotoxicity after 5 weeks of exercise was abolished after an acute injection of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist timolol (0.5 mg kg(-1) i.v.), indicating that catecholamines are involved in this augmentation. Interestingly, 24 h after the last exercise bout, the increased natural cytotoxicity could be blocked by timolol. The opioid receptor antagonist naloxone given subcutaneously for 7 days by osmotic pumps (6 mg kg(-1) h(-1)) could not reverse the increased in vivo cytotoxicity seen in the running SHRs, suggesting that opioid receptor mechanisms are not involved, or at least not the naloxone-sensitive mu-receptor. Natural immunity was not influenced by the histamine H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine, either in controls or in runners, indicating that the natural killer cell-regulatory effect of histamine is not present in SHRs and does not seem to be involved in the exercise-induced changes in natural immune function. We conclude that the augmentation of in vivo natural cytotoxicity after voluntary chronic exercise in rats is long-lasting and that the augmentation is partly mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors.",

    "64": "Sotalol's usefulness in treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter is unproven. This study evaluated (1) the efficacy of sotalol in preventing recurrences of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and controlling ventricular rate (in chronic atrial fibrillation or relapse of paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias), (2) the safety of sotalol, and (3) predictors of sotalol efficacy. Thirty-three patients, 28 with paroxysmal and five with chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, received an average dose of 265 +/- 119 mg of oral sotalol per day. During a 10 +/- 12 month follow-up, recurrence rate for paroxysmal arrhythmia was 64%, with a 50% recurrence at 4.6 months. For patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, ventricular rates were well controlled with sotalol administration (136 +/- 33 beats/min versus 88 +/- 23 beats/min; p = 0.04). No patient with chronic atrial fibrillation converted to sinus rhythm during the study. Side effects necessitated sotalol discontinuation in three patients. By multivariate analysis, younger age, higher ejection fraction, and absence of hypertension independently predicted sotalol efficacy.",

Cellular glucose uptake directly affects the pumping efficiency in corneal endothelial cells. Following the cells' treatment with various antiglaucoma eyedrops for 100 min, the 3H-2-deoxyglucose uptake in cultured porcine corneal endothelial cells was affected by betaxolol from 3.1% (1.6 mM), 181% (0.16 mM) to 158% (0.016 mM), by timolol from 93% (0.79 mM), 227% (0.079 mM) to 151% (0.0079 mM), by carteolol from 141% (3.4 mM), 180% (0.34 mM) to 97% (0.034 mM), by levobunolol from 80% (1.5 mM), 98% (0.15 mM) to 90% (0.015 mM), by dipivefrin from 116% (0.2 mM), 176% (0.02 mM) to 108% (0.002 mM) and by pilocarpine from 115% (9.6 mM), 210% (0.96 mM) to 210% (0.096 mM) when the cells were compared with a control medium. In the presence of various corticosteroids, the glucose uptake in corneal endothelial cells was affected by fluorometholone from 160% (0.26 mM), 139% (0.026 mM) to 107% (0.0026 mM), by dexamethasone from 85% (0.25 mM), 117% (0.025 mM) to 109% (0.0025 mM) and by betamethasone from 95% (0.25 mM), 96% (0.025 mM) to 99% (0.0025 mM). These results show that the commercial eyedrops of antiglaucoma drugs and corticosteroids will not decrease the cellular glucose uptake in cultured porcine corneal endothelial cells except when incubated with high concentrations of betaxolol, levobunolol and dexamethasone.", 
    "66": "The aim of this study was to investigate short-term effects of propranolol (a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist), octreotide (a long-acting somatostatin analogue), or a combination of these substances on splanchnic and systemic haemodynamics and arterial blood gases in rats with portal vein stenosis.", 
    "67": "Splanchnic and systemic haemodynamics were measured using the radioactive microspheres method. Eight rats first received an i.v. infusion of isotonic saline (10 microL/min for 15 min) and then an i.v. infusion of octreotide (8 micrograms.h/kg for 15 min). Eight other rats first received a bolus i.v. injection of propranolol (2 mg) and an i.v. infusion of octreotide 15 min later.", 
    "68": "Propranolol or octreotide alone significantly decreased portal pressure (both by 23%), portal tributary blood flow (35 and 10%, respectively) and cardiac index (36 and 26%, respectively). Octreotide administration in rats pretreated with propranolol significantly decreased cardiac index but did not change portal and arterial pressures or portal tributary blood flow. Propranolol significantly increased arterial oxygen tension. Octreotide alone or combined with propranolol significantly decreased oxyhaemoglobin saturation and pH and increased carbon dioxide tension.", 
    "69": "In rats with portal vein stenosis, the somatostatin analogue, octreotide, accentuates the short-term decrease in cardiac index due to propranolol. In addition, octreotide altered arterial blood gases and acid-base status. In contrast, octreotide does not further decrease portal pressure in animals receiving propranolol.", 
    "70": "The effect of chronic treatment with the non-selective beta-blocker oxprenolol (CAS 6452-71-7) administered orally in two different doses (15 or 30 mg/kg/day for 6, 10 and 12 weeks) on plasma cholinesterase (PChE) activity and on the plasma level of triglyceride and total cholesterol were studied in normal rats. In all treated groups a significant increase (approximately 27-51%) of PChE activity was obtained (p < 0.05 vs. control group). The plasma concentration of total cholesterol was significantly increased as well (21-48%, p < 0.05 vs. control) but oxprenolol exerted no significant effect on plasma triglyceride levels. The increase of enzyme activity and total cholesterol were not time- or dose-dependent. According to these results which showed a direct relationship between PChE activity and total cholesterol it is supposed that the increase of enzyme activity is initially due to the action of oxprenolol on total cholesterol metabolism but that it does not have a direct effect on the enzyme. The results contribute to the hypothesis that PChE plays a role in lipoprotein metabolism although this has not yet been proven.", 
    "71": "The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist as well as serotonin 5-HT1 receptor antagonist, (-)alprenolol, was found to potentiate the disrupting effect of the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, dizocilpine, on prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR) in the rat. The facilitating effect of dizocilpine on ASR amplitude was also potentiated by (-)alprenolol. (-)Alprenolol by itself did not affect either of these measures. These effects did not seem to be related to the unselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist property of (-)alprenolol, since combined pretreatment with the beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonists, metoprolol and ICI 118551, did not alter the effects of dizocilpine on startle behaviour. However, a serotonergic influence was suggested by the fact that a facilitating effect of dizocilpine on ASR amplitude was also obtained by pretreatment with the 5-HT precursor, L-5-HTP, in benserazide-pretreated rats. Furthermore, pretreatment with the 5-HT2 selective receptor antagonist, MDL 100907, significantly reduced the (-)alprenolol-induced potentiation of the effects of dizocilpine on startle behaviour, while the 5-HT3 selective receptor antagonist, ondansetron, failed to do that. Finally, the (-)alprenolol-induced potentiation of the effects of dizocilpine was significantly reduced by pretreatment with the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, and by the potential antipsychotic and selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, raclopride. This study suggests that altered 5-HT activity may influence the effects of psychotomimetic drugs such as dizocilpine on sensorimotor function, and this observation may have implications for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia in humans.", 
    "72": "The blood pressure waveform is modified on distal propagation by phenomena such as dispersion, reflection and the state of the arterial compliance. The consequent effects are amplification and narrowing of the wave, with an increased systolic, reduced diastolic and essentially unaltered mean blood pressure. The Finapres measures the peripheral pressure using the volume clamp principle; it has not been validated under altered physiological conditions and during pharmacodynamic interventions. We studied simultaneous Finapres and brachial blood pressures (using a conventional oscillometric sphygmomanometer-Vitalmap) in ten normal volunteers at rest, and during dynamic exercise and a cold pressor test. The effects of pharmacodynamic intervention were examined following beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol (160 mg) or beta-adrenoceptor modulation with the beta-adrenoceptor partial agonist celiprolol (400 mg). The Finapres systolic pressure was significantly higher than the brachial value during all three test states. The difference between the systolic pressures measured by the two devices was shown to increase significantly during the cold pressor test, but not during dynamic (supine bicycle) exercise. The Finapres diastolic pressure was significantly higher than the Vitalmap value during exercise and the cold pressor test. The differences between the two methods increased significantly over time. Beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol or modulation with celiprolol had no significant interaction with the pressure differences between the Finapres and Vitalmap techniques. The results would support the view that the Finapres can provide blood pressure information which is robust under most circumstances. Although this pharmacodynamic intervention did not alter the relationship between the peripheral and central blood pressure, it is important to note that this dynamic relationship is sensitive to circulatory loading conditions and wave transmission characteristics; it is possible that the Finapres could be less reliable in clinical settings where potent vasoactive agents were being administered.", 
    "73": "The cardiovascular responses to double lumen endobronchial intubation and the effect of esmolol were examined in two groups of 10 ASA 2 & 3 patients undergoing pulmonary surgery in a double blind, placebo-controlled study. Endobronchial intubation was associated with a significant increase in arterial pressure and heart rate (p = 0.004), and a significant increase in plasma noradrenaline concentrations (p < 0.01) in the control group. The haemodynamic changes were smaller (p < 0.001) in the patients who received esmolol compared with the changes in the the control group. The increase in plasma noradrenaline concentrations was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the esmolol group. The pressor response to endobronchial intubation in this study was of a similar magnitude to that known to occur in response to tracheal intubation.", 
    "74": "A Trp-->Arg mutation at amino acid position 64 in the human beta3-adrenoceptor is reportedly associated with morbid obesity; carriers suffer from increased gain in mass, early-onset diabetes, insulin resistance, and an increased waist-to-hip ratio [Cl\u00e9ment, K., Vaisse, C., Manning, B. S., Basdevant, A., Guy-Grand, B., Ruiz, J., Silver, K. D., Shuldiner, A. R., Froguel, P. & Strosberg, A. D. (1995) N. Engl. J. Med. 333, 352-354]. Here, we report the stable expression of the genes encoding the wild-type or the [Arg64]beta3-adrenoceptor in two different cell types: hamster CHO-K1 and human HEK293. The mutated receptor displayed unchanged pharmacological values compared to the wild type for the binding inhibition (Ki) and adenylyl cyclase activation constants (K(act)) in two independent clones of both cell lines. However, maximal cAMP accumulation was significantly reduced in response to various beta3-adrenergic agonists, including endogenous catecholamines, (-)-epinephrine and (-)-norepinephrine, the non-selective agonist (-)-isoproterenol, and the beta3-adrenergic selective agonist CGP 12177A. Treatment with Pertussis toxin did not restore the adenylyl cyclase activity to that of the wild type, suggesting that the reduction in cAMP accumulation observed in cells expressing [Arg64]beta3-adrenoceptor is not due to enhanced interaction of the beta3-adrenoceptor with the inhibitory Gi protein.",

    "76": "Eight young men (age range, 22 to 33 years) and seven elderly men (age range, 62 to 79 years) were given 10 mg pindolol twice daily, pindolol with 200 mg trimethoprim once daily (a known inhibitor of organic base secretion) and pindolol with 1.5 gm ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) four times daily for 3 days on three occasions. On day 4, urine and plasma were collected over 24 hours to determine renal clearance (CLR) values of pindolol isomers.", 
    "77": "R(+)-Pindolol CLR values in young versus elderly men were 203 +/- 82 versus 150 +/- 87 ml/min, 128 +/- 51 versus 113 +/- 35 ml/min, and 480 +/- 248 versus 247 +/- 59 ml/min during the control, trimethoprim, and NH4Cl study phases, respectively. S(-)-Pindolol CLR values in young versus elderly were 279 +/- 81 versus 207 +/- 105 ml/min, 178 +/- 70 versus 136 +/- 42 ml/min, and 593 +/- 294 versus 276 +/- 49 ml/min during control, trimethoprim, and NH4Cl phases, respectively. NH4Cl increased R(+)-pindolol CLR by 138% (p < 0.05 versus pindolol alone) in young men, which was significantly greater than that observed in elderly subjects (66%; p < 0.05 versus pindolol alone; p = 0.016 young versus old). NH4Cl affected S(-)-pindolol CLR in a similar manner. Trimethoprim decreased R(+)-pindolol CLR in the young subjects by 37% (p < 0.05 versus pindolol alone), which was similar to that observed in the elderly subjects (26%; p < 0.05 versus pindolol alone; p = 0.94 young versus elderly). Trimethoprim affected S(-)-pindolol CLR in a similar manner. Stereoselective renal excretion of pindolol was unaffected by NH4Cl and trimethoprim, where the R(+)/S(-)-pindolol CLR ratio was unchanged (p = NS) from control in the young and elderly subjects. Comparison of the pindolol CLR isomer ratio between young and elderly groups showed no significant differences. Changes in pindolol clearance values resulted in significant changes in beta-blocking activity, assessed by isoproterenol (INN, isoprenaline) testing.",

    "79": "The one of the most important goal of antihypertensive therapy is to prevent and improve the hypertensive heart disease including cardiac hypertrophy and ischemic heart disease. The regression of cardiac hypertrophy by treatment reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. ACE inhibitor (ACEI) may be the most powerful among antihypertensive agents to regress hypertrophy. Ca-antagonist and ACEI can improve the impaired coronary flow reserve by microvascular circulation. Recently, the evidences have been accumulated that the release of nitric oxide (NO) from the coronary artery of hypertension is reduced. \"TREND\" study proved that ACEI can improve this decreases in the clinical study. For the heart failure, ACEI is a effective drugs, and Ca-antagonist and beta-blocker also have been getting good results.", 
    "80": "Over the past few decades, numerous randomized controlled studies of the treatment of hypertension have been conducted in Western countries to determine whether blood pressure reduction reduces the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. Diuretics and beta blockers, because they have been shown in clinical trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, are the preferred drugs of first choice. No direct evidence yet supports the theoretical advantages of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors over diuretics and beta blockers. Because East Asian nations differ culturally from Western countries, it is very difficult to conduct a randomized trials, thus, there were no reports of large, long-term, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hypertension.", 
    "81": "The beta-blockers are either nonselective and affect both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors, are relatively selective for the alpha 1 subclass, or are able to have activity against alpha-receptors. The ability to reduce blood pressure is very common among all beta-blockers, and beta-blockers are recommended for one of the first-line drugs in hypertension treatment by JNCV. beta-blockers should be used considering their pharmacological properties and potential side effects, according to the pathophysiological conditions involved. The superiority of beta-blocker to other types of antihypertensive drug has not yet been evidenced by larger scale clinical trials which have been carried out so far. To verify more precisely the usefulness of beta-blocker in hypertension treatment, more large scale clinical trials are required to be carried out. The fixed-dose combination of beta-blockers and calcium blockers appears to be more effective rather than that of beta-blockers and diuretics.", 
    "82": "1. This study was aimed at characterizing ATP-induced rises in cytosolic free calcium ion, [Ca2+]i, in a population of rat striatal astrocytes loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ probe Fura2, by means of fluorescence spectrometry. 2. ATP triggered a fast and transient elevation of [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner. The responses of the purine analogues 2-methylthio-ATP (2-meSATP), adenosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (ADP beta S), as well as uridine-5'-triphosphate (UTP) resembled that of ATP, while alpha, beta-methylene-ATP (alpha, beta-meATP) and beta, gamma-methylene-ATP (beta, gamma-meATP) were totally ineffective. 3. Suramin (50 microM) had only a minor effect on the ATP response, whereas pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) (5 microM) significantly depressed the maximum response. 4. Extracellular Ca2+ did not contribute to the observed [Ca2+]i rise: removing calcium from the extracellular medium (with 1 mM EGTA) or blocking its influx by means of either Ni2+ (1 mM) or Mn2+ (1 mM) did not modify the nucleotide responses. 5. Furthermore, after preincubation with 10 microM thapsigargin, the nucleotide-evoked [Ca2+]i increments were completely abolished. In contrast, 10 mM caffeine did not affect the responses, suggesting that thapsigargin-, but not caffeine/ryanodine-sensitive stores are involved. 6. Both application of the G-protein blocker guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) (1 mM) and preincubation with pertussis toxin (PTx) (350 ng ml-1) partially inhibited the nucleotide-mediated responses. Moreover, the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122, but not its inactive stereoisomer U-73343 (5 microM), significantly reduced the ATP-evoked [Ca2+]i rise. 7. In conclusion, our results suggest that, in rat striatal astrocytes, ATP-elicited elevation of [Ca2+]i is due solely to release from intracellular stores and is mediated by a G-protein-linked P2Y receptor, partially sensitive to PTx and coupled to PLC.", 
    "83": "1. Sibutramine is a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, SNRI) which is currently being developed as a treatment for obesity. Sibutramine has been shown to decrease food intake in the rat. In this study we have used a variety of monoamine receptor antagonists to examine the pharmacological mechanisms underlying sibutramine-induced hypophagia. 2. Individually-housed male Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on reversed phase lighting with free access to food and water. Drugs were administered at 09 h 00 min and food intake was monitored over the following 8 h dark period. 3. Sibutramine (10 mg kg-1, p.o.) produced a significant decrease in food intake during the 8 h following drug administration. This hypophagic response was fully antagonized by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (0.3 and 1 mg kg-1, i.p.), and partially antagonized by the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, metoprolol (3 and 10 mg kg-1, i.p.) and the 5-HT receptor antagonists, metergoline (non-selective; 0.3 mg kg-1, i.p.); ritanserin (5-HT2A/2C; 0.1 and 0.5 mg kg-1, i.p.) and SB200646 (5-HT2B/2C; 20 and 40 mg kg-1, p.o.). 4. By contrast, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, RX821002 (0.3 and 1 mg kg-1, i.p.) and the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551 (3 and 10 mg kg-1, i.p.) did not reduce the decrease in food intake induced by sibutramine. 5. These results demonstrate that beta 1-adrenoceptors, 5-HT2A/2C-receptors and particularly alpha 1-adrenoceptors, are involved in the effects of sibutramine on food intake and are consistent with the hypothesis that sibutramine-induced hypophagia is related to its ability to inhibit the reuptake of both noradrenaline and 5-HT, with the subsequent activation of a variety of noradrenaline and 5-HT receptor systems.", 
    "84": "1. To investigate further the release, localization and identity of a non-nitrergic mediator of smooth muscle relaxation in the female pig urethra, we studied the effects of drugs acting at alpha 2-adrenoceptors or K+ channels, the effects of capsaicin and chemical sympathectomy, and the actions of several transmitter candidates. 2. Electrical field stimulation (EFS; frequencies above 12 Hz) of spontaneously contracted smooth muscle strips from the female pig urethra evoked long-lasting, frequency-dependent relaxations in the presence of prazosin, scopolamine, and NG-nitro-L-arginine. Treatment with the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist UK-14 304 markedly reduced the relaxations evoked by EFS at all frequencies tested (16-30 Hz). The inhibitory effect of UK-14 304 was completely antagonized by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine. The muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist, pirenzepine, or exogenously administered carbachol, did not have any effects on the electrically evoked relaxations. 3. Inhibition of high conductance Ca2+ activated K+ channels by iberiotoxin or charybdotoxin significantly enhanced the relaxations evoked by EFS at all frequencies. However, inhibition of voltage-sensitive K+ channels with 4-aminopyridine or dendrotoxin-1, treatment with the ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker, glibenclamide, or treatment with the high and low conductance Ca2+ activated K+ channel blockers, tetraethylammonium chloride and apamin, had no effect on the relaxations evoked by EFS. 4. Electrically evoked relaxations were not affected by adrenergic denervation with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) at any frequency. However, treatment with 6-OHDA abolished prazosin-sensitive electrically induced contractions, and a long-lasting relaxation was revealed. Treatment with capsaicin, believed to damage selectively a subpopulation of primary afferent fibres, did not affect basal tone or relaxations evoked by EFS. 5. Exogenously applied vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP)-27, PACAP-38, adenosine, ATP and 5-hydroxy-tryptamine caused relaxations of the urethral preparations, whereas prostaglandin E2 and calcitonin gene-related peptide had no effects. VIP 10-28, alpha, beta-methylene-ATP, reactive blue-2, suramin or indomethacin did not reduce the electrically-evoked relaxations at any frequency. However, the relaxations were slightly reduced by trypsin or alpha-chymotrypsin. 6. The present results suggest that the release of the unknown mediator in the female pig urethra can be modulated via alpha 2-adrenoceptors and high conductance Ca2+ activated K+ channels. Furthermore, the mediator does not appear to be localized to or released from adrenergic or capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerve-endings. The identity of the transmitter remains to be established.", 
    "85": "In patients with chronic glomerular nephropathy associated arterial hypertension and proteinuria are considered to be cardinal risk factors in the progressive deterioration of renal function.

Four drugs were given for 4 weeks, doubly blinded and randomized according to a \"Latin-square design\": Celiprolol (beta-1-antagonist, beta-2-agonist, 200 mg/d), Atenolol (selective beta-1-antagonist, 50 mg/d), Ramipril (ACE-inhibitor, 2.5 mg/d) and placebo. There was a two-week wash-out phase between each of the four treatment phases. At the end of each treatment phase glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by inulin and para-amino-hippuric acid (PAH) clearance. Proteinuria was determined in the course of a three-day collection period at the end of each treatment phase. During this period blood pressures were measured with a continuous 24-hour blood pressure monitor.",

Celiprolol produced a significant rise In ERPF (322 +/- 109 ml/min with placebo, 391 +/- 110 ml/min with celiprolol: P < 0.05). GFR was slightly, but not significantly, reduced by celiprolol and atenolol. Filtration fraction remained unchanged with atenolol and celiprolol, while it was slightly, but not significantly, reduced with ramipril.

    "89": "Both the R(+) and the S(-) enantiomers of carvedilol were metabolized in human liver microsomes primarily to 4'- (4OHC) and 5'-(5OHC) hydroxyphenyl, 8-hydroxy carbazolyl (8OHC) and O-desmethyl (ODMC) derivatives. The S(-) enantiomer was metabolized faster than the R(+) enantiomer although the same P450 enzymes seemed to be involved in each case. A combination of multivariate correlation analysis, the use of selective inhibitors of P450, and microsomes from human lymphoblastoid cells expressing various human P450s enabled phenotyping of the enzymes involved in the oxidative metabolism of carvedilol. CYP2D6 was primarily responsible for 4OHC and 5OHC production, although considerable activity was observed in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer liver and the variability of these activities across a human liver bank was not high. There was some evidence that CYP2E1, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 were also involved in the production of these metabolites. CYP1A2 was primarily responsible for the 8OHC pathway with additional contributions from CYP3A4. The ODMC was clearly associated with CYP2C9 with some evidence for the partial involvement of CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1. With its complex P450 phenotype pattern and the known contribution of non-oxidative pathways of elimination, the activity (or lack of activity) of any particular P450 would have a limited influence on the disposition of carvedilol in an individual.", 
    "90": "Endothelial dysfunction is a prevalent phenomenon in non-insulin dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients with hypertension and albuminuria, and may contribute to the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, which is the main cause of the high morbidity and mortality observed in these patients. Therefore the aim of our study was to evaluate whether inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (with lisinopril 10-20 mg day-1) could ameliorate endothelial dysfunction more than reducing blood pressure with conventional antihypertensive treatment (atenolol 50-100 mg day-1), usually in combination with a diuretic. We performed a 12-month prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel study in 43 hypertensive NIDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy (21 treated with lisinopril and 22 with atenolol). The following variables were measured: 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP); transcapillary escape rate of albumin (TERalb; i.e. initial disappearance of intravenously injected 125I-labelled human serum albumin); serum concentrations of von Willebrand factor (vWF), using ELISA, and urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE). Data are presented for 32 patients (16 lisinopril and 16 atenolol; age 60 years, SD 8; 25 males) out of 35 who completed the study and had valid measurements of TERalb. At baseline the two groups were comparable; TERalb (8.5 (SEM 0.6) vs. 7.2 (0.4)%); vWF (2.09 (range 0.82-4.34) vs. 1.97 (0.95-3.86) IU ml-1; UAE 916 (x/divided by antilog SEM 1.3) vs. 1444 (1.2), and mean ABP 110 (SEM 3) vs. 113 (2) mmHg, in the lisinopril and atenolol group, respectively. During follow up, the mean ABP was equally reduced in the lisinopril and atenolol group, by 12 (SEM 2) vs. 10 (2) mmHg, respectively, TERalb decreased in the lisinopril group by 0.6 (SEM 0.7)%, whereas it increased in the atenolol group 1.5 (0.5)%; the mean difference was 2.2% (95% CI, 0.5 to 3.9; p = 0.015). UAE was reduced by 45% (95% CI, 25 to 60) in the lisinopril group vs. 10% (-15 to 30) in the atenolol group (p = 0.014). Serum vWF was not changed during follow up in either group.

    "91": "Phospholipase-A2 has been suggested as having a role in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis. The inhibition of phospholipase-A2 was studied in vitro using 17 pharmacological agents in the search for a specific therapy for acute pancreatitis. The inhibitory effect was tested using an isotopic assay system with 2-palmitoyl-(1-14C)-labelled dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine as a substrate and 10 microliters of serum from patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis as an enzyme source. Among all agents tested, anti-inflammatory drugs inhibited enzyme activity most significantly: indomethacin (9.0 x 10(-3) mol l-1) decreased the phospholipase-A2 activity to one- tenth. The weak inhibitory effect could also be demonstrated using a lower concentration of 2 x 10(-5) mol l-1, which can be achieved after intravenous administration of 50 mg of this drug. The other drugs inhibited the enzyme activity at concentrations higher than those achieved after intravenous injections in clinical use. Diclofenac (3.1 x 10(-2) mol l-1) reduced the phospholipase-A2 activity by 93%, ketoprofen (2.0 x 10(-2) mol l-1) or chlorpromazine (1.4 x 10(-2) mol l-1) by 90%, tobramycin (1.7 x 10(-2) mol l-1) by 84%, doxycycline (9.0 x 10(-3) mol l-1) by 61%, dexamethasone (1.7 x 10(-3) mol l-1) by 62%, methylprednisolone (3.8 x 10(-2) mol l-1) by 50%, and pindolol (1.0 x 10(-4) mol l-1) by 59%. A weak inhibition of phospholipase-A2 activity was demonstrated by betamethasone, bupivacaine, digoxin, hydrocortisone, lidocaine, metoprolol, propranolol, and vancomycin. Indomethacin proved the most potent of the tested agents in inhibiting phospholipase-A2 activity in serum from patients with acute pancreatitis and should be further studied in vivo.", 
    "92": "There is good evidence that the cardiopulmonary and arterial baroreflexes are blunted in chronic heart failure (HF). Other evidence, however, suggests that the cardiac chemoreflex is enhanced during HF. In the present study, we sought to determine whether HF alters the sensitivity of cardiac vagal chemosensitive endings to bradykinin (BK), an endogenous mediator that activates ventricular C fiber afferents. We measured the activity of cardiac vagal single fibers and compared the afferent responses to left atrial injections of BK and capsaicin in sham-operated and pacing-induced HF dogs. The capsaicin-sensitive endings did not respond to changes in cardiac pressures evoked by vascular snares and were C fiber endings (0.8-2.1 m/s). Most were located in the left heart. There was no difference in rate or pattern of resting discharge of the cardiac vagal fibers between HF and sham groups (1.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.3 impulses/s, respectively). The afferent response to BK (0.001-1 microgram/kg), but not capsaicin (1-10 micrograms/kg), was greater in HF compared with sham dogs. Captopril (2 mg/kg i.v.) significantly enhanced resting discharge (P < 0.05) from cardiac chemosensitive vagal afferents in HF but not sham dogs. The afferent response to BK in both groups was significantly (P < 0.05) and similarly enhanced. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v.) significantly inhibited resting discharge (P < 0.05) and nearly abolished the afferent responses to lower doses of BK in HF, but did not affect resting discharge and less effectively attenuated responses to BK in sham dogs. Responses to capsaicin did not differ between HF and sham animals. From these results, we conclude that 1) resting discharge from cardiac vagal chemosensitive endings is not altered in HF, 2) these vagal endings exhibit an enhanced sensitivity to exogenous BK but not to capsaicin in the HF state, 3) angiotensin-converting enzyme activity inhibits resting discharge from these afferents in HF, and 4) the cyclooxygenase system contributes to the enhanced BK responsiveness of cardiac chemosensitive endings in HF.", 
    "93": "To validate power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) as an autonomic indicator during exercise, ten males performed four identical progressive cycling tests during infusions of saline, esmolol (beta 1-blocker), glycopyrrolate (muscarinic blocker), or both drugs. Power spectra were constructed from the recorded electrocardiogram by Fourier algorithm and integrated for low-frequency power (LF) and high-frequency power (HF). Four different LF bands (0.004-0.1, 0.004-0.15, 0.05-0.1, and 0.05-0.15 Hz) and two different HF bands (0.1-1.0 and 0.15-1.0 Hz) were evaluated. The parasympathetic index, HF, decreased exponentially with workload and was attenuated by glycopyrrolate and combined treatments with both HF frequency bands measured. Whereas some sympathetic indexes (LF/total power and LF/HF) did reflect expected increases in sympathetic nerve activity associated with progressive increases in work intensity, none of the measured increases responded appropriately to autonomic blockade. It is concluded that HRV is a valid technique for noninvasive measurement of parasympathetic tone during exercise, but its validity as a measure of sympathetic tone during exercise is equivocal.", 
    "94": "During a hyperthermic challenge, skin blood flow (SkBF) increases primarily through activation of the cutaneous active vasodilator system. However, mechanisms through which activation of this system elevates SkBF remain unknown. In this project, we sought to identify whether functional beta-adrenoceptors exist on cutaneous vessels and, if present, whether these receptors play an important role in elevating SkBF during a hyperthermic challenge. In protocol 1, SkBF was assessed over two intradermal microdialysis probes. Initially, both probes were perfused with lactated Ringer solution. Probe A was then perfused with a 200 microM solution of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol while probe B was perfused with a 1.7 mM solution of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Isoproterenol perfusion significantly increased SkBF from 17.7 +/- 2.4 to 70.8 +/- 13.2 perfusion units (PU; P < 0.05), whereas propranolol perfusion did not significantly affect SkBF (23.4 +/- 6.5 to 27.0 +/- 6.8 PU; P > 0.05). After this period, the solutions perfusing the probes were switched. Isoproterenol did not significantly change SkBF at the propranolol-treated site (27.0 +/- 6.8 to 26.4 +/- 7.5 PU; P < 0.05). In protocol 2, SkBF was assessed over two microdialysis probes during indirect whole body heating. One probe was perfused with Ringer solution while the other probe was perfused with 1.7 mM propranolol. The degree of elevation in SkBF during heat stress at the propranolol-treated site (10.4 +/- 1.5 to 35.8 +/- 3.1 PU) was similar to the elevation in SkBF at the Ringer solution site (11.6 +/- 1.0 to 35.0 +/- 1.2 PU). These data demonstrate the presence of functional beta-adrenoceptors in the skin; however, these receptors play no significant role in mediating cutaneous vasodilation during indirect whole body heating.", 
    "95": "Although sympathetic activation is believed to promote atrial fibrillation (AF), the effects of sympathetic stimulation on AF have not been systematically studied. In seven morphine-chloralose-anesthetized dogs, autonomic decentralization increased atrial effective refractory period (ERP) and reentrant wavelength (WL) and decreased the duration of AF induced by burst atrial pacing. Graded bilateral stellate ansa stimulation decreased ERP and WL to values similar to those before decentralization but did not return AF duration to predecentralization values. Sympathetic and bilateral vagal stimulation were adjusted in six additional dogs to produce similar effects on ERP and WL. Despite comparable effects on mean WL, the duration of AF was increased by vagal stimulation from 14 +/- 5 (control) to 372 +/- 96 s (P < 0.001) but was not altered significantly (26 +/- 10 s) by sympathetic stimulation. Vagal stimulation increased the variability in atrial refractoriness, as indicated by the standard deviation of ERP at seven atrial sites and of activation frequency during AF at 112 recording sites, whereas sympathetic stimulation had no significant effect on these indexes of ERP heterogeneity. We conclude that sympathetic stimulation is much less effective than vagal stimulation in promoting AF and that heterogeneity in atrial ERP may be important in determining the ability to sustain AF.", 
    "96": "To determine whether the formation and maintenance of focal adhesions and costameres in cardiac myocytes are influenced by the mechanical forces that they transmit, we mechanically unloaded these cells by inhibiting their spontaneous contractile activity with the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine (12 microM). Interference-reflection and fluorescence microscopy revealed that within 24 h of arrest, beta 1-integrin- and vinculin-positive focal adhesions and costameres were disrupted. Loss of mature beta 1-integrin from the cell surface was observed in cell surface-labeling experiments and in Western blots. Subjecting nonbeating cells to a 5% static stretch for 24 h resulted in an increase of 21% for beta 1-integrin and 39% for vinculin. Stretching beating cells resulted in 71 and 9% increases, respectively. Intracellular concentrations of pre-beta 1 were not affected by contractile activity or by stretch. Our results indicate that mechanical forces stabilize the cellular levels of beta 1-integrin and vinculin by possibly regulating their association with the formation and maintenance of focal adhesions and costameres.", 
    "97": "The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that a catecholamine-dependent mechanism would upregulate alveolar liquid clearance after fluid resuscitation from 15 min of hemorrhagic shock. Anesthetized rats were hemorrhaged to a mean arterial pressure of 35 mmHg for 15 min and were resuscitated with a 4% albumin solution. Alveolar liquid clearance was measured 5 h later by the concentration of protein in the distal airspaces over 1 h after instillation of a 5% albumin solution into one lung. Hemorrhaged rats developed a severe metabolic acidosis that was associated with a significant rise-in plasma epinephrine levels throughout the study. There was a 60% increase in alveolar liquid clearance in hemorrhaged and resuscitated rats compared with control rats. Amiloride (10(-4) or 10(-6) M), propranolol (10(-4) M), or bilateral adrenalectomy inhibited the increase in alveolar liquid clearance. This effect was reproduced by the intravenous administration of epinephrine in adrenalectomized and hemorrhaged rats. Thus these data provide evidence for a catecholamine-dependent regulation of sodium transport that protects the airspaces against flooding several hours after fluid resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock.", 
    "98": "This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of triiodothyronine (T3) administration to euthyroid rats on beta 3-adrenoceptor (beta 3-AR) expression and on the different components of the adenylyl cyclase (AC) system in brown adipose tissue (BAT). In rats treated with T3, the beta 3-AR density (assessed by the binding of [3H]CGP-12177) showed a decrease of 50%, as did their mRNA, as analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. In hyperthyroid rats, compared with control rats, there was a 40% increase in G alpha s activity (stimulated by NaF or GTP gamma S) and a fourfold increase in the protein concentration (Western blotting). In contrast, the level of the pertussis toxin substrate Gi declined by 35% in response to T3. Analysis of dose-response curves for isoproterenol and CGP-12177 revealed that neither basal nor stimulated AC activities nor 50% stimulatory concentration for these agonists was changed by T3 administration. In conclusion, these results suggest that downregulation of the beta 3-AR by T3 was counter-balanced by changes in other components of the AC cascade (i.e., Gs and Gi), so no change occurred in the capacity of BAT to generate adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate.", 
    "99": "Atrial tachycardias, in particular atrial flutter after surgery for congenital heart disease, is associated with a high mortality. Treatment with various antiarrhythmic drugs and/or antitachycardia pacemakers is not very successful. Sotalol, a Class III drug, has shown to be a promising drug in adults with atrial tachycardias. However, the experience with sotalol in children after surgery for congenital heart disease is limited. Therefore, we describe our results here. Between December 1990 and February 1997, 26 children with atrial tachycardias, most of them with atrial flutter or fibrillation (n = 20), after surgery for congenital heart disease were treated with sotalol orally. The age of the children at the start of treatment was 7.5 +/- 5.8 years (mean +/- SD). The time interval between surgery and the start of atrial tachycardia ranged from 1 day to 14.3 years (3.8 +/- 3.8 years). Conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in 16 out of 22 hemodynamically stable children with a dosage of 4.0 +/- 1.6 mg/kg per day. The six children without sinus rhythm on sotalol and four hemodynamically unstable patients were treated prophylactically with sotalol after DC cardioversion for their tachycardias. Two children complained of mild transient fatigue. Heart rate decreased during therapy (95 +/- 33 vs 81 +/- 21 beats/min; P = 0.01). QTc-intervals did not change. Proarrhythmias such as torsades de pointes were not encountered. Two children with a preexistent sick sinus syndrome showed aggravation of bradycardia and needed pacemaker implantation. The percentage of children with a recurrence-free interval of 1 and 2 years was 96% and 81%, respectively, for all atrial tachycardias, and 92% and 66% for atrial flutter. The recurrences of atrial tachycardias during the follow-up period, which ranged from 0.1-6.1 years (2.5 +/- 1.8 years) could be treated with only an increase of the dosage of sotalol in all but one patient. We conclude that sotalol is an effective drug for the treatment and prevention of atrial tachycardia in children after surgery for congenital heart disease.", 
    "100": "The familial long QT syndrome (LQTS) is now recognized as a genetic channelopathy with a propensity to arrhythmogenic syncope and sudden death. Three genetic mutations have been identified that involve the slow and fast delayed potassium rectifier currents and the sodium current. Distinctive ECG-T wave phenotypes are associated with each of the three genotypes. Current day therapy includes: beta-adrenergic blocking drugs; pacemakers; left cervicothoracic sympathetic ganglionectomy; implanted cardioverter defibrillators; and possibly, drugs that improve mutant ionic channel dysfunction. LQTS has provided unique insight into the complex relationship between ionic channel dysfunction and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.", 
    "101": "The management of unexplained syncope begins with the patient's history and physical examination, which are oriented to help separate benign from serious causes. Malignant etiologies are more likely to occur with exertional syncope. Cardiac causes should be considered, particularly cardiomyopathy, postoperative congenital heart disease, right ventricular dysplasia, anomalous coronary artery, pulmonary artery hypertension, myocarditis, long QT syndrome, and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Neurological and metabolic disorders may underlie a syncope episode. After malignant causes of syncope have been excluded and the diagnosis of neurocardiac syncope has been established, treatment strategies include behavior modification, salt and increased fluids, and pharmacological agents. Efficacious agents include beta-blockers, dysopyramide, fludrocortisones, and alpha agents. Yet, behavior modification alone may be as effective as salt or pharmacological therapy. Because the natural history of neurocardiac syncope in children is spontaneous resolution, it is appropriate to try the simple measures before introducing drug therapy.", 
    "102": "In previous studies, it was shown that the overexpression of beta2-adrenoceptor (beta2AR) in the hearts of transgenic mice (Tg) leads to agonist-independent activation of adenylate cyclase and enhanced myocardial function. Here, we measured the physical coupling of beta2AR and Gs by evaluating the coimmunoprecipitation of beta2AR and Gs and the ligand binding properties of beta2AR in the hearts of Tg mice to investigate the details of the interaction among ligand, receptor, and G protein. The following results were obtained: (i) coimmunoprecipitation of beta2AR and Gs was increased in the absence of agonist in Tg mice compared with the control animals. This demonstrates directly the increased interaction between unliganded beta2AR and Gs, which is consistent with increased background cAMP production and cardiac function in the hearts of Tg mice. (ii) Guanosine-5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate abolished the association of beta2AR/Gs in the immunoprecipitate. (iii) The affinities for ligands that show agonist (isoproterenol, clenbuterol, and dobutamine), neutral antagonist (alprenolol and timolol), and negative antagonist (propranolol and ICI 118551) activities in this experimental system were increased, not changed and decreased, respectively, in Tg mice compared with the controls. (iv) This efficacy-dependent alteration in ligand affinities was still observed in the presence of a guanosine-5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate concentration that abolishes beta2AR/Gs coupling. This suggests that the altered beta2AR binding affinities in Tg mice are not due to the increased interaction between beta2AR and Gs. These data cannot be explained by using ternary, quinternary, two-state extended ternary, or cubic ternary complex models. We therefore discuss the results using a \"two-state polymerization model\" that includes an isomerization step for the conversion of receptor between an inactive and an active form (denoted as R and R*, respectively) and a polymerization of the active state (R*n). The simplest form of this model (i.e., noncooperative dimerization of the receptor) is found to be consistent with the experimental data.", 
    "103": "Atenolol is a beta-blocker commonly used for treating hypertension. It can induce various kinds of adverse side effects, including psoriasiform skin eruptions, skin necrosis, vasculitis, and (rarely) drug-induced connective tissue disease. We encountered a patient receiving atenolol for his hypertension for 3 years who subsequently acquired connective tissue disease and antihistone antibodies. The initial serologic antinuclear antibody test was negative at a dilution of 1/20 but was positive after further serial dilutions, indicating the prozone phenomenon as the cause of the false-negative result. Six months after discontinuation of atenolol, the skin rash disappeared and antihistone antibody subsided. His skin rash reappeared on rechallenge with atenolol for 3 days, confirming that atenolol was responsible for his lupus erythematosus.", 
    "104": "High sodium diet (HS, 8% NaCl) induces left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in normotensive rats without an increase in pressure or volume load or in resting cardiac sympathetic activity. HS may affect LV adrenoceptors density or affinity or their postreceptor pathways, thereby causing LVH. We therefore assessed the effects of HS with and without blockade of alpha1- or beta-adrenoceptors by terazosin or nadolol, alone or in combination, on resting hemodynamics, LV and right ventricular (RV) weights, and LV dimensions of male WKY rats. HS increased LV weight by 14% to 17%, and the ratio of LV wall thickness to radius by 18% to 23%. Singly or in combination, the adrenoceptor antagonists did not prevent HS-induced LVH, but instead aggravated it. The increased ratio of LV wall thickness to radius and of LV to RV were attenuated by terazosin or nadolol alone. Neither the resting LV peak-systolic or end-diastolic pressures nor the right atrial pressure was changed by HS, either alone or in combination with the blockers. The failure of chronic alpha1- or beta-blockade to prevent HS-induced LVH suggests that adrenoceptor activation is not important in evoking the LVH. However, the blockers shifted the LVH from a concentric to an eccentric form, suggesting an involvement of additional trophic factors during adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "105": "The blood pressure lowering effect and tolerability of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril combined with a very low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were compared with the selective betareceptor blocker atenolol in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Three hundred seventy-four patients were randomized into a triple-blind, parallel, active-controlled 12-week study period comparing enalapril/HCTZ (20/6 mg) with atenolol (50 mg) after a 4-week placebo baseline period. Blood pressure (BP), clinical and laboratory safety, and metabolic laboratory variables were assessed. Enalapril/HCTZ as well as atenolol reduced both sitting and standing diastolic and systolic BP (P < .001), but enalapril/HCTZ had a more pronounced effect than atenolol on sitting systolic BP (P = .019); there was a trend toward more patients achieving target diastolic BP (<90 mm Hg, P = .053). No clinically important differences in safety and tolerability were observed.", 
    "106": "Diabetes mellitus leads to micro- and macroangiopathy with endothelial dysfunction. To investigate the direct influence of high glucose on endothelial cell structure and possible pharmacologic effects, seven different experimental protocols were carried out on endothelial cells in culture. There were four control groups with either 5 mM D-glucose alone, 5 mM D-glucose plus 15 mM L-glucose (for osmotic control), 5 mM D-glucose plus 500 nM celiprolol, or 5 mM D-glucose plus 57 nM nitrendipine. Three experimental groups had either 20 mM D-glucose alone, 20 mM D-glucose plus 500 nM celiprolol or 20 mM D-glucose plus 57 nM nitrendipine. Treatment of all groups started at the third passage of the cells and lasted until confluence was reached (5-8 days). The endothelial cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde and stained either with hematoxylin-eosin solution, with nitro blue tetrazolium for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)- diaphorase staining, or actin staining with phalloidin was carried out. For quantitative analysis of the histologic specimens, the slides were viewed via a microscope and a videocamera. The pictures were converted digitally and could be analyzed with the videopicture-analyzing system, JAVA. In the four control groups, neither treatment with 15 mM L-glucose nor administration of celiprolol or nitrendipine had an effect on cell, cytoplasm, and nuclear area. The number of giant or polynuclear cells and the histochemical NADPH-diaphorase activity were not altered. Incubation of endothelial cells with 20 mM D-glucose for 5-8 days resulted in a significant increase in total and cytoplasmic area, as well as in the number of giant and polynuclear cells, whereas the nuclear area and the NADPH-diaphorase activity were significantly reduced. Concomitant treatment with celiprolol was able to reverse these alterations in endothelial structure significantly but had only a weak effect on the NADPH-diaphorase. Nitrendipine had no beneficial effect on the high D-glucose-induced cell alterations. The actin staining of the control cells showed the typical actin pattern with most of the actin filaments arranged at the periphery of the cells. Administration of 20 mM D-glucose resulted in a disturbance of the actin pattern, with most of the actin filaments now arranged in the middle of the cells. However, neither celiprolol nor nitrendipine exhibited a significant influence on this altered actin structure. High D-glucose treatment over several days thus leads to severe changes in endothelial cell structure, and celiprolol may have a beneficial effect on these hyperglycemia-induced cell alterations.", 
    "107": "Acebutolol (AC) is a chiral beta-blocker which is extensively metabolized to an active, chiral metabolite, diacetolol (DC). Similar to some other beta-adrenoceptors, AC exhibits multiple peaks in plasma concentration-time curves after oral doses to humans. We examined the suitability of the rat as an animal model and studied the effect of various factors including the route of administration, food, and bile on the pharmacokinetics of AC enantiomers. Pharmacokinetics of AC were delineated after oral (fed and fasted), i.v., and i.p. doses, and after oral and i.v. doses, to intact and bile-duct-ligated female Sprague-Dawley rats, respectively. The possibility of intestinal metabolism or saturable absorption was studied in vitro using everted rat gut. Multiple peaks were present but only after oral doses independent of food intake, suggestive of gastrointestinal tract involvement. Oral absorption of AC enantiomers was incomplete as bioavailability was lower after oral (R, 0.59; S, 0.63) as compared to i.p. off(R, 0.86; S, 0.84) doses. Food reduced bioavailability by 60%. A 250-fold increase in the dose did not alter the absorption kinetics of AC through the everted gut, ruling out the possibility of saturable absorption. No intestinal metabolism was detected in vitro. Enterohepatic recirculation cannot be responsible as ligation of the bile duct did not alter the pattern or route dependence of the multiple peaking. The rat appears to be a suitable animal model; a bile- and food-independent erratic absorption is probably responsible for the observed multiple peaking of AC.", 
    "108": "In order to determine the absolute bioavailability, both oral and intravenous administrations of a drug are often used. Recently a new method has been proposed to determine absolute bioavailability in the absence of intravenous dose. Following a single oral dose, this method requires oral and renal clearance data from normal subjects and renal failure patients. The bioavailability is calculated from a plot of oral against renal clearance following an oral dose, where the inverse of the slope is equal to absolute bioavailability. This study examines the prediction of absolute bioavailability from the proposed method for eight drugs which have a wide range of oral and renal clearance. From this study, it appears that the proposed method may not be reliable for the prediction of absolute bioavailability and further investigation is needed to test the validity of this method.", 
    "109": "In this study, the effects of dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, on ethanol withdrawal symptoms, were compared with those of diazepam and propranolol. The rats were given highly intoxicating doses of ethanol for 4 days. After the intoxication period, rats were divided into four equal groups: a dexmedetomidine-treated group (30 micrograms/kg, sc), a diazepam-treated group (2 mg/kg, sc), a propranolol-treated group (5 mg/kg, sc), and a control group with no medication. Medication was given in the withdrawal phase-2, 8, 14, and 20 hr after the onset of the withdrawal symptoms. The severity of the ethanol withdrawal symptoms (rigidity, tremor, irritability, and hypoactivity) was observed up to 33 hr after the onset of the ethanol withdrawal symptoms. Both dexmedetomidine and diazepam significantly relieved tremor compared with the control group. Diazepam reduced irritability significantly, compared with the control group. When measured as the sum score of the three most specific withdrawal signs (rigidity, tremor, and irritability), dexmedetomidine and diazepam significantly relieved the ethanol withdrawal reaction. Propranolol attenuated tremor, but was inefficient against other withdrawal symptoms. Dexmedetomidine may thus represent a new effective drug in the treatment of the ethanol withdrawal syndrome.",

The study was conducted following an open randomized 2-period crossover design with a 14-day washout interval between doses. Plasma samples were obtained over a 24-hour interval and atenolol concentrations were determined by HPLC with fluorimetric detection. From the plasma atenolol concentration vs time curves the following pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained: AUC(zero-24) (area under the concentration vs time curves from 0-24 h), ke (terminal elimination constant), t1/2 (terminal first order elimination half-life), AUC (area under the concentration vs time curves extrapolated to infinity), Cmax (maximum achieved concentration), Tmax (time to achieve Cmax) and Cmax/AUC. All these variables were analyzed using both parametric and nonparametric statistics. Geometric mean Angipress/Atenol individual percent ratios were 99.6% for AUC(zero-24), 99.7% for AUC, 98.0% for Cmax, 102.8% for t1/2, 97.2% for ke and 97.8% for Cmax/AUC, with all their 90% confidence intervals within the bioequivalence range 80-125%, thus showing similar patterns of absorption and disposition. Arithmetic mean for individual Tmax differences was 0.8 h, and the 90% confidence interval did not include the zero value. Based on these results and in accordance with the European Union and the US Food and Drug Administration bioequivalence requirements we conclude that both atenolol formulations are bioequivalent for both the extent and the rate of absorption.",

However, the impact of beta-blocker therapy on these end points during dobutamine stress testing has not been well established. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of propranolol on dobutamine stress testing with ST-segment monitoring, technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, and echocardiography. In 17 patients with known reversible perfusion defects, dobutamine stress tests with and without propranolol were performed in randomized order and on separate days, following discontinuation of oral beta blockers and calcium antagonists. Propronolol was administered intravenously to a cumulative dose of 8 mg or to a maximum heart rate reduction of 25% and dobutamine was infused in graded doses in 3 minute stages until a standard clinical end point or the maximum dose of 40 microg/kg/min was achieved. The dobutamine stress test after propranolol was associated with a lower maximum heart rate (83 +/- 18 vs 125 +/- 17, p <0.001) and rate pressure product (14,169 +/- 4,248 vs 19,894 +/- 3,985, p <0.001) despite a higher infusion dose.

The percentage unbound in serum for diazepam, phenytoin, digitoxin, and propranolol was not significantly different between the untreated and heat-treated samples. Therefore, heat treatment of serum does not appear to alter the binding characteristics at these four binding sites and would not be expected to lead to erroneous unbound concentration estimates and inappropriate adjustments in drug therapy.", 
    "128": "To determine whether the nitric oxide (NO) system in the central nervous system (CNS) is involved in the peripheral metabolism of carbohydrate we injected NG-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMA), an inhibitor of NO synthase, into the third cerebral ventricle of unanesthetized, unrestrained rats and determined the plasma level of glucose. This intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of the drug increased the plasma level of glucose dose-dependently, whereas an intravenous (i.v.) injection had no effect. The hyperglycemia thus induced was suppressed by concomitant i.c.v. or prior i.v. administration of L-arginine. Concomitant administration of D-arginine did not affect hyperglycemia by L-NMA. The i.c.v. injection of 5 x 10(-6) mol L-NMA increased plasma levels of glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine, and serum levels of glucagon. However, plasma levels of insulin were unchanged, despite the presence of hyperglycemia. The hyperglycemia produced by L-NMA was completely inhibited by bilateral adrenalectomy. It was also inhibited by prior intraperitoneal injection of phentolamine, but not of propranolol or naloxone. Results suggest that L-NMA acts on the CNS to stimulate adrenal secretion of epinephrine and, subsequently, to elevate glucose levels in the peripheral blood. The NO system thus seems to be involved in the neural regulation of the adrenal by the GNS, which in turn regulates peripheral blood glucose levels.", 
    "129": "1. Stress in known to affect the functioning of the central noradrenergic system in a region-specific manner. The aim of the present investigation was to understand better the consequences of recurrent stressful experiences on central beta-adrenoceptors. 2. Alterations in the central nervous beta-adrenoceptor system resulting from different periods of psychosocial stress (PSS) were analyzed in male tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) which were submitted to subordination stress for varying time periods. 3. In the first experiment, the whole number of beta-adrenoceptors was analyzed in the forebrains of subordinate animals and controls by in vitro autoradiography using 125I-iodocyanopindolol (125ICYP), while nonspecific binding of the radioligand to serotonin receptors was blocked with 100 microM 5HT. 4. PSS affects beta-adrenoceptors in a time-dependent manner. A decrease in receptor affinity occurred after just 21 days of PSS in cortical areas and in the hippocampus, indicating stress effects on the conformation of beta-adrenoceptors. After 30 days of PSS, the numbers of beta-adrenoceptors were significantly decreased in several cortical regions and in the olfactory area. 5. In the second experiment, we investigated the influence of PSS on both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors separately. 125ICYP binding was quantified in the presence of either ICI188.551 to block beta 2-adrenoceptors or in the presence of CGP20712A to block beta 1-adrenoceptors. 6. After 2, 10, 21, and 28 days of PSS, it become apparent that the two beta-adrenoceptor subtypes are regulated independently. Beta 1-adrenoceptors were transiently down-regulated after 2 days of PSS in the prefrontal cortex and in the olfactory area and were decreased after 28 days of PSS in the parietal cortex and the hippocampus. A transient up-regulation of beta 1-adrenoceptors occurred in the pulvinar nucleus after 10 days of PSS. Beta 2-adrenoceptors were transiently down-regulated after 2 days of PSS in the prefrontal cortex and up-regulated in the pulvinar nucleus after 28 days of PSS. 7. These data demonstrate that chronic psychosocial stress in subordinate tree shrews leads to time-dependent changes in the central nervous beta-adrenoceptors system. 8. The high regional variability in stress-induced beta-adrenoceptor regulation is supposed to be due to the complex mechanisms of intracellular beta-adrenoceptor sequestration, which includes down-regulation and/or reinsertion of receptors into the plasma membrane. These mechanisms may be important components of the regulatory apparatus which enables the individual to adapt to situations of recurrent stressful experiences by balancing the central nervous adrenoceptor number.", 
    "130": "1. The number and distribution pattern of beta-adrenergic receptors in the brain have been reported to be species specific. The aim of the present study was to describe binding of the beta-adrenoceptor ligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol in the brain of the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri), a species which provides an appropriate model for studies of psychosocial stress and its consequences on central nervous processes. 2. 125I-Iodocyanopindolol (125ICYP) labeling revealed a high degree of nonspecific binding, which was due mainly to interactions of this ligand with serotonin binding sites. For a quantitative evaluation of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, serotonin binding sites had to be blocked by 100 microM 5HT. 3. Binding of the radioligand to beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors was characterized using the beta 1-specific antagonist CGP20712A and the beta 2-specific antagonist ICI118.551. beta 1-adrenoceptor binding is present in the whole brain, revealing low receptor numbers in most brain regions (up to 1.5 to 2.7 fmol/mg). A slight enrichment was observed in cortical areas (lateral orbital cortex: 4.0 +/- 0.7 fmol/mg) and in the cerebellar molecular layer (8.7 +/- 1.0 fmol/mg). 4. Competition experiments demonstrated high- and low-affinity binding sites with considerable variations in Ki values for CGP20712A, showing that various affinity states of beta 1-adrenoceptors are present in the brain (Ki: 0.61 nM to 67.1 microM). In the hippocampus, only low-affinity beta 1-adrenoceptors were detected (Ki: 1.3 +/- 0.2 microM). Since it is known that 125ICYP labels not only membrane bound but also internalized beta-adrenoceptors, it can be assumed that the large population of the low-affinity sites represents internalized receptors which may be abundant due to a high sequestration rate. 5. High numbers of beta 2-adrenoceptors are present in only a few brain structures of tree shrews (external layer of the olfactory bulb, 15.8 +/- 2.0 fmol/mg; claustrum, 19.3 +/- 1.5 fmol/mg; anteroventral thalamic nucleus, 19.4 +/- 1.5 fmol/mg; cerebellar molecular layer, 55.0 +/- 4.3 fmol/mg). Also for this class of beta-adrenoceptors, high- and low-affinity binding sites for the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI118.551 were observed, indicating that 125ICYP labels membrane bound and internalized beta 2-adrenoceptors. Only in the cerebellar molecular layer was a high percentage of high-affinity beta 2-adrenoceptors detected (Ki for ICI118.551 was 1.8 +/- 0.3 nM for 90% of the receptors). 6. In conclusion, beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor binding can be localized and quantified by in vitro receptor autoradiography in the brains of tree shrews when serotonergic binding sites are blocked. Modulatory effects of long-term psychosocial conflict on the central nervous beta-adrenoceptor system in male tree shrews are described in the following paper.", 
    "131": "Antidepressants can cause a variety of withdrawal reactions, starting within a few days to a few weeks of ceasing the drug and persisting for days to weeks. Both tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors cause similar syndromes, most commonly characterized by gastrointestinal or somatic distress, sleep disturbances, mood fluctuations and movement disorders. Most symptoms related to tricyclic antidepressant withdrawal are believed to be caused by rebound excess of cholinergic activity after prolonged anticholinergic effect on cholinergic receptors. (This situation is analogous to the adrenergic rebound that occurs after beta-blocker withdrawal.) Treatment involves restarting the antidepressant and tapering it more slowly. Alternatively, tricyclic antidepressant withdrawal symptoms often respond to anticholinergics, such as atropine or benztropine mesylate. Three case reports of antidepressant withdrawal are presented, including one featuring akathisia (motor restlessness) related to withdrawal of venlafaxine."
