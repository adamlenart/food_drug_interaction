    "0": "Effects of acebutolol on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in rats and on adenylate cyclase of heart and liver in dogs were investigated to determine the beta receptor blocking properties of the compound. Acebutolol exhibited the beta blocking activity and inhibited the increase of serum lactate concentration induced by adrenaline. This inhibition was about one-sixth as potent as that of propranolol. In hyperglycemic and free fatty acid effects of adrenaline, acebutolol inhibited the adrenaline-induced free fatty acid increase more effectively than hyperglycemia induced by adrenaline. In the inhibition of stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the heart and liver, acebutolol was more active on the heart than on liver. Relative beta1 specificity of acebutolol was 93.2. Inhibition of propranolol on adenylate cyclase activity was more potent than that of acebutolol on both tissues, but showed no specificity. These results suggest that acebutolol is beta1 selective, although its beta blocking potency is less than that of propranolol.", 
    "1": "The effect of four adrenoceptor antagonists, chosen because of reported differences in their selectivities, were compared using the positive chronotropic response to isoprenaline on isolated rabbit atria. Oxprenolol was the most potent antagonist of the isoprenaline induced cardiac arrhythmias. Alprenolol, practolol and propranolol also blocked the positive chronotropic responses to isoprenaline effectively. All the antagonists lowered the resting heart rate. The effects of all four selected antagonists on heart rate probably result from cardiac beta adrenoceptor blockade. Atria isolated from reserpine treated rabbits, showed a reduced percentage of increase in the heart rate in response to addition of isoprenaline. This decreased response has been related in some cases to direct myocardial inhibition.", 
    "2": "In the Parkinsonian syndrome tremor is the symptom which still eludes pharmacological therapy. The authors report the results of nine cases of Parkinsonian tremor in which agonist and antagonist drugs acting on the receptors were employed. These were dopaminergics, acetylcholinergics, serotoninergics, histaminics, and alpha- and beta-adrenergics. The data obtained demonstrate the involvement of all the neurotransmitters studied, some directly through quantitative modifications, others indirectly through their involvement in reciprocal functional equilibria. A sytem of equilibria is hypothesized in which the histamine: serotonin ratio is given greater emphasis. (Acta neurol belg., 1977, 77, 213-229).", 
    "3": "Noradrenaline (NA), 100 microgram intraventricularly (ivtr), produces an evident hypertension, lasting for up to 15 min. A previous ivtr administration of propranolol (100 and 500 microgram), alprenolol (100 microgram), sotalol (100 microgram), (-)INPEA (100 microgram), (+)INPEA (100 microgram), Ko 1366 (100 and 200 microgram), or practolol (20 microgram) abolishes the hypertensive action of NA. The results indicate that the central nervous system of the rat contains structures similar to the peripheral beta-adrenoceptor, and that they are involved in the central regulation of circulation.", 
    "4": "1. 2-Ethyl-3-(4-gamma-di-n-butylaminopropoxy-benzoyl)-indolizine hydrochloride (L 9394) induced in the ananesthetized dog a marked and long-lasting decrease in heart rate together with a transient reduction in blood pressure. 2. L 9394 decreased Robinson's index, an effect which suggests that the substance reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart. 3. L 9394 markedly increased coronary arterial blood flow. 4. L 9394 is endowed with non-competitive antiadrenergic properties. 5. L 9394 did not impair cardiac function since cardiac output and stroke volume increased appreciably during the initial phase of action and did not fall below the control values at any time thereafter. 6. The overall haemodynamic properties of L 9394, which were similar to those of amiodarone, are considered to be potentially valuable for the long-term treatment of angina pectoris.", 
    "5": "1-(7-Ethylbenzofuran-2-yl)-2-tert.-butylamino-1-hydroxyethane hydrochloride (bufuralol) is a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent which closely resembles propranolol in its properties, including potency. Bufuralol is devoid of alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity but possesses beta-adrenoceptor agonist activity. beta-Adrenoceptor blocking activity resides mainly in the (-)-isomer though membrane stabilising properties are associated with both optical isomers.", 
    "6": "Histamine, 2-methylhistamine (a specific H1-receptor agonist), 4-methylhistamine (a specific H2-receptor agonist), isoprenaline, bradykinin, prostaglandin E1, E2, and F 2alpha induce relaxation of carbachol-contracted isolated cat bronchial strips and tracheal chains. Bovine SRS-A contracts bronchus but not trachea. Histamine-induced relaxation of cat bronchus is not blocked by mepyramine (a specific H1-receptor antagonist); metiamide or burimamide (specific H2-receptor antagonists); propranolol ( a beta-adrenoceptor blocker) and indomethacin (a PG-synthetase inhibitor) suggesting non-participation of H1,H2-histamine receptors, beta-adrenoceptors (catecholamine release) and prostaglandin release in histamine-induced broncho-relaxations in the cat. The existence of an atypical histamine response, resistant to both H1- and H2-receptor antagonists is thus established in cat bronchus.", 
    "7": "Saralasin, an angiotensin II inhibitor was infused in 10 hypertensive patients. A blood pressure reduction was achieved after stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-system by salt depletion. Heart rate and cardiac output failed to compensate for reduction of blood pressure. Thus circulatory reflex-mechanisms are inhibited by saralasin. A direct influence on baroreceptor mechanism and/or catecholamines is probable. Failure of the hypotensive effect of saralasin in salt-depleted patients after administration of beta-blockers supports this hypothesis.", 
    "8": "The ability of several beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with partial agonist activity (dl-oxprenolol, dl-acebutolol and dl-practolol) to attenuate the release of CPK that occurs during hypoxia (pO2 less than 0.8 kPa [6 MMHg]) has been studied and compared with the protection provided by dl-propranolol. dl-propranolol attenuated the hypoxic-induced release of CPK. The activity resided in the l isomer. dl-oxprenolol, acebutolol, and practolol were either less effective than propranolol in preventing CPK release, or they exacerbated the release. The protective effect of dl-propranolol extended to the hypoxic hyperthyroid heart but not to hearts that were perfused under aerobic (pO2 greater than 80 kPa [600 mmHg]) Ca2+-free conditions.", 
    "9": "(-)-[3H]-Dihydroalprenolol((-)[3H]DHA) binding in the rat hypothalamus appears to possess all the characteristics expected of physiologically relevant beta-adrenergic receptors. Binding of (-)-[3H]DHA to the hypothalamic sites was rapid (k1 = 1.3 X 10(-7) min-1) and also rapidly reversible. Binding was saturable at low concentrations of ligand (approximately 50-100 nM). The dissociation constant (KD) of (-)-[3H]DHA binding determined by equilibrium analysis was 19 nM. Binding displayed beta-adrenergic specificity. beta-Adrenergic agonists inhibited binding in the following order of potency: (-)-isoproterenol congruent to (-)-epinephrine greater than (-)-norepinephrine. Specific beta-adrenergic antagonists (-)-propranol and (-)-alprenolol inhibited binding at low concentrations (KD = 25-50nM) whereas the alpha-antagonist phentolamine inhibited binding at very high concentration (KD = 42 micron). Interactions of both agonists and antagonists with the sites showed stereoselectivity. The (-)-isomers of all beta-adrenergic agents tested were more potent than their respective (+)-isomers. These results suggest that specific receptor sites for beta-adrenergic catecholamines are present in rat hypothalamus.", 
    "10": "1 A hypotensive response to orally administered pindolol in conscious normotensive and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)/saline hypertensive rats (DS-rats) is described. In DS-rats, pindolol (10-50 mug/kg) produced a dose-dependent fall in blood pressure and elevation of resting heart rate.2 The hypotensive response and tachycardia produced by oral pindolol (50 mug/kg) in DS-rats were prevented by propranolol (5 mg/kg), suggesting that pindolol's effects are mediated by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.3 After mecamylamine (10 mg/kg), oral pindolol (50 mug/kg) produced a further fall in blood pressure in DS-rats, suggesting that its hypotensive effects are probably mediated in the peripheral vasculature.4 Pretreatment with oral pindolol (10 or 50 mug/kg) resulted in a reduction of neuronally-induced tachycardia in pithed DS-rats; neuronally-evoked pressor effects were also antagonized by pindolol (50 mug/kg, orally).5 Whereas pindolol, 50 mug/kg orally or intraperitoneally, produced a marked and progressive hypotensive response of rapid onset (20 min) in DS-rats the same dose intravenously produced a smaller response of delayed onset (80 minutes).6 In anaesthetized DS-rats, an equivalent degree of cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade was produced by pretreatment with pindolol, 50 mug/kg orally (2 h previously) or intravenously (1 h previously).7 After administration of pindolol, 2 mg/kg intravenously, to conscious DS-rats, the tachycardia produced by intravenous isoprenaline, 3 mug/kg, was almost abolished for the first 60 min of the study, whereas a hypotensive response to pindolol was delayed in onset (100 minutes).8 The hypotensive response and tachycardia produced by oral pindolol 50 mug/kg, in DS-rats were prevented by inhibition of metabolic enzyme activity by pretreatment with Proadifen (SKF 525-A), 80 mg/kg.9 The results suggest that pindolol's effects on blood pressure and heart rate in the conscious DS-rat are mediated by a metabolite(s) acting by stimulation of peripheral beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "11": "1 (t-Butyl-amino-3-ol-2-propyl) oximino-9 fluorene is a new beta2-adrenoceptor blocking agent with a pA2 of 9.23+/-0.25 on isolated trachea. 2 It provokes hypertension in normotensive rats and does not prevent arterial hypertension in SHR rats, although it does prevent the renin secretion normally induced by isoprenaline infusion.", 
    "12": "A wide variety of drugs may be associated with serious cardiovascular toxicity. Toxicity due to drugs primarily used for treating cardiovascular toxicity. Toxicity due to drugs primarily used for treating cardiac disorders is the most extensively documented, especially the arrhythmias due to digitalis glycosides. Various arrhythmias are also caused by toxic levels of many antiarrhythmic agents including quinidine, procainamide and phenytotin. Myocardial depression and heart failure are serious side-effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents and myocardial ischaemia due to sympathominetic amines may result from both direct and indirect mechanisms. The many toxic reactions in the cardiovascular system due to non-cardiac drugs are less widely known and for the most part less clearly understood. Many remain controversial at the current time; for example, the diathesis toward thromboembolism in women taking oral contraceptives. Potential cardiac toxicity due to drugs used in the rapidly expanding sphere of anti-neoplastic chemotherapy is exemplified by the cardiomyopathy-like toxicities of doxorubicin and daunorubicin. Many of the psychotherapeutic drugs including phenothiazine antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants have arrhythmogenic potential.", 
    "13": "The synthesis of a number of ring-halogenated N-isopropyl- and N-tert-butyl-2-amino-1-(2-thienyl)ethanols has been carried out in order to ascertain the influence of chloro or bromo substitution at the thiophene moiety on their blocking beta-adrenoceptor activity. It was found that chloro- and bromo-substituted compounds exhibited a similar activity. Monohalo substitution at positions C4 or C5 of the thiophene ring resulted in comparable blocking potency, whereas C3 halo-substituted compounds were practically devoid of activity. The highest activity in these series was observed with compounds dihalogenated at C4 and C5, their effect on myocardial beta-receptors being comparable to that of propranolol.", 
    "14": "This study has determined the propranolol content of Purkinje fibers associated with antiarrhythmic and electrophysiological actions of the drug both in vivo and in vitro. The minimum effective tissue content of propranolol that consistently reversed a sustained ouabain-induced ventrivular tachycardia in vivo after i.v. propranolol was between 6.7 and 11.1 micron g/g of tissue. Propranolol doses producing Purkinje fiber contents of less than 6.7 micron g/g failed to revert the arrhythmia but did ponotropic responses to 0.5 micron g/kg of isoproterenol. The in vivo minimum effective tissue content was produced in isolated Purkinje fibers perfused with Tyrode's solution containing 1.7 X 10(-6) M propranolol. In Purkinje fibers this concentration of propranolol depressed the rate of phase 4 depolarization previously enhanced by ouabain 2.1 X 10(-7) M. Propranolol, 1.7 X 10(-6) M, did not alter membrane responsiveness and only slightly accelerated repolarization at 5 minutes. Propranolol, 0.85 X 10(-6) M, did not significantly depress the ouabain-enhanced rate of phase 4 depolarization but did attenuate the response to epinephrine through beta blockade. This study indicated that the initial direct action of propranolol in reverting a ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia to a sinus rhythm in the dog is depression of automaticity.", 
    "15": "A 12-year-old boy with a norepinephrine-secreting pheochromocytoma that caused hypertension resistant to oral alpha adrenergic blockade is reported. Resistance to alpha adrenergic blocking agents developed when the patient's daily propranolol dosage was lowered from 10 to 1 mg/kg. Subsequently, alpha methyl tyrosine, an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, controlled the patient's blood pressure and was associated with reduction in total urinary catecholamine excretion. Norepinephrine content of the tumor and uninvolved adrenal gland removal at surgery was reduced. These findings confirm that alpha methyl tyrosine inhibited in vivo synthesis of catecholamines.", 
    "16": "Canine marrow erythroid colony growth is enhanced by agents linked to the adenyl cyclase/cyclic AMP (cAMP) system, including cAMP, a phosphodieterase inhibitor (RO-20-1724), cholera enterotoxin, and beta-adrenergic agonists. The adrenergic effect is mediated by receptors having beta2-subspecificity. These receptors are distinct from putative receptors for erythropoietin and those acted upon by cholera enterotoxin. In addition, the population of cells most responsive to beta-agonists is distinct from the majority of erythropoientin-responsive cells, perhaps representing a subpopulation of this class of cell. This demonstration of an adenyl cyclase-linked mechanism regulating mammalian erythroid colony growth provides a model for the modulation by other hormones or small molecules of in vitro and, perhaps, in vivo erythropoiesis.", 
    "17": "Blood flow in the spinal cord was measured in a group of monkeys over a wide range of artificially varied blood pressures after the administration of propranolol, a beta adrenergic blocker. Spinal cord blood flow was found to be constant and in the normal range between a mean system arterial blood pressure of 50 to 150 mm Hg. From 150 to 180 mm Hg spinal cord blood flow decreased. There was no breakthrough of autoregulation, previously seen in the untreated animal. It is suggested, therefore, that the previously observed breakthrough of autoregulation is a beta adrenergic-mediated phenomenon.", 
    "18": "To examine the direct effects of dopamine on renin release, the in vitro rat kidney slice system, devoid of hemodynamic and humoral effects, was chosen. In the presence of an antioxidant, ascorbic acid (6 X 10(-4)M), a significant dose-related stimulation of renin release was observed with addition of 10(-5)M and higher concentrations of dopamine. When the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, pheniprazine (1 X 10(-5)M) was added, significant, dose-related stimulation of renin release was observed with 10(-8)M and higher concentrations of dopamine. Dopamine-induced renin release was not inhibited by the presence of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine (9 X 10(-4)M), the dopaminergic antagonist, haloperidol (5 X 10(-5)M) or the neural uptake inhibitor, cocaine (1 X 10(-5)M). However, the presence of the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (2 X 10(-4)M) completely inhibited dopamine-induced renin release. These studies indicate that dopamine can directly stimulate renin release in the absence of effects of hemodynamic factors, alterations in sodium metabolism or release of endogenous adrenergic agents. Further, this direct effect of dopamine on renin release appears to be mediated by an agonistic effect on the juxtaglomerular beta receptor rather than by the presence of a specific dopaminergic receptor for renin release.", 
    "19": "Epinephrine, known to potentiate and elicit aggregation of human platelets, was shown to inhibit thrombin-induced aggregation of rat platelets, delaying the onset of aggregation from 2 to 12 times. Incubation of rat platelet suspensions with propranolol (1.25--30 micrometer), inactive by itself, totally prevented the inhibitory effect of epinephrine and also permitted a potentiation effect to show up. On the contrary, phentolamine (1.25--30 micrometer) potentiated the inhibitory effect of epinephrine on rat platelets and unmasked an inhibitory effect on human platelets. Finally, isoproterenol (0.25--9 micrometer) produced a marked inhibition of aggregation induced by thrombin, ADP and collagen in the three species studied, but most particularly in the rat. From these results, we conclude that stimulation of the platelet adrenergic receptors may either result in promotion (alpha-stimulation) or inhibition (beta-stimulation) of platelet aggregation. Furthermore, differences in the ratios or responses of alpha/beta receptors may account for species variations in the platelet aggregation response to catecholamine challenge.", 
    "20": "Beta-receptor blocking agents (practolol, propranolol) and alpha-receptor blocking agents (phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine), when applied intracochlearly do not eliminate the afferetn discharges or compound action potential of the cochlear nerve. Under the assumption that the drugs used reach the synaptic site, it is therefore concluded that these drugs do not interfere with afferent synaptic transmission. Phentolamine,, however, has a toxic effect upon the cochlea independent from the synaptic process. Local application of catecholamines does not increase spontaneous activity of single fibres of the cochlear nerve. These findings show that catecholamines are not likely to be the afferent transmitter.", 
    "21": "The effects of chemical sympathectomy and of the injection of amines or amine-receptor blocking drugs on cell proliferation in colonic crypts and in dimethylhydrazine-induced colonic carcinomata is examined in rats using a stathmokinetic technique. In animals which had been chemically sympathectomized by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine cell proliferation essentially ceased in the colonic crypts but continued at a normal rate in the tumours. Stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors by metaraminol, a drug with properties similar to noradrenaline, caused acceleration of cell proliferation in colonic crypts but not in tumours. Conversely, blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors by phentolamine inhibited cell proliferation in crypts but not in tumours. Injection of adrenaline, predominantly a beta-adrenergic agonist, inhibited cell proliferation in the tumours but not in colonic crypts whereas blockade of beta-adrenoceptors by propranolol accelerated cell proliferation in tumours but not in colonic crypts. It is postulated that cell proliferation in the crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn in rat colon resembles that in rat jejunum in being controlled by the autonomic nervous system. However, tumour cell proliferation does not appear to be subject to such regulation.", 
    "22": "The prophylactic effectiveness of propranolol (80 to 120 mg per day) in 18 migraine patients was compared with a placebo group of 19 migraine patients in a double blind study without cross over for a treatment period of six and twelve weeks. A statistically significant difference in effect could not be ascertained. The results and methodological assumptions of the double blind studies with cross over already under consideration in the literature are discussed.", 
    "23": "In conscious rabbits, the intravenous administration of pindolol (0.125 mg/kg) and propranolol (1 mg/kg) induced a highly significant (p less than 0.001) decrease of mean arterial blood pressure and with propranolol, a significant (p less than 0.01) bradycardia. In the same model the intravenous administrtion of saline (1 ml/kg) and of indomethacin (1 mg/kg) did not affect mean arterial blood pressure or heart rate (p greater than 0.3). Pretreatment of the animals with indomethacin (1 mg/kg) abolished the effect of both beta-blockers on mean arterial blood pressure (p greater than 0.05) and had no significant effect on heart rate.", 
    "24": "D,L-Propranolol given in single doses by gavage or s.c. injection to awake rats, always slowed the heart without affecting blood pressure. Doses of 0.2 mg/100 g injected twice daily lowered systolic pressure after 3 days in DOCA hypertensive but not in normotensive or spontaneously hypertensive rats. When chronic treatment with propranolol preceded the induction of DOCA hypertension, the pressure elevation attained 14 weeks later was less in treated than in untreated rats. Pressor responses to injected norepinephrine and to posterior hypothalamic stimulation were significantly larger in DOCA hypertensive rats that had been treated chronically with propranolol than in those that had not. These results suggest that propranolol's antihypertensive effects are unimpressive because they are simultaneously opposed by an enhanced cardiovascular responsiveness to pressor stimuli.", 
    "25": "Plasma nor-epinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) levels at rest and immediately after exercise were estimated in 8 patients with asymptomatic extrinsic allergic bronchial asthma. The patients had a normal airway resistance at rest and developed a marked bronchoconstriction (EIB) during exercise, which could be prevented by previous alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine. In 7 control persons NE and E levels were measured also after beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. The following results were obtained: 1. At rest NE levels showed no significant differences between the groups. After exercise an increase of NE was observed in all groups, but in patients, even after phentolamine, and in normals after propranolol the increase was significantly higher than in the normal group within the control test. 2. No significant differences between the groups were found in E levels at rest and after exercise. Exercise caused no significant increase of E levels, except in the normals after propranolol application. 3. No significant correlation existed between NE levels and the increase of airway resistance after exercise. It is concluded that during exercise in asthmatics the sympathetic activity is enhanced, but the provocation of an EIB does not seem to be mediated by enhanced plasma NE levels.", 
    "26": "Haemodynamic studies were performed in 10 patients with uncomplicated thyrotoxicosis and seven with thyrotoxic cardiac failure. The cardiac output of those with uncomplicated hyperthyroidism was higher than normal at rest. After 2 mg of intravenous propranolol there was a 13% fall but the level was still higher than normal. In patients with thyrotoxic cardiac failure the resting cardiac output was normal, but it fell after propranolol by 30% to subnormal levels. In both groups there was an increase in right heart pressures and fall in the rate of increase in arterial pressure, which indicated a decrease in myocardial contractility. These results indicate that increased autonomic activity is a compensatory phenomenon in hyperthyroid heart failure and that its abolition by beta-blocking drugs has a deleterious effect on cardiac function. They are therefore contraindicated in patients with thyrotoxic heart failure.", 
    "27": "Rat parotid acinar cells dispersed by a combination of enzymatic treatments remain sensitive to adrenergic and cholinergic agonists. Previous studies have implicated Ca2+ in both adrenergic and cholinergic responses. This paper describes the effects of adrenergic and cholinergic stimulation upon 45Ca2+ fluxes in isolated parotid acinar cells. Suspensions of dispersed cells took up 45Ca2+ from the medium. The net rate of isotope influx was increased by the adrenergic agonists epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol, and phenylephrine, and by the cholinergic agonists acetylcholine and carbamylcholine. In 1 mM Ca2+, epinephrine was capable of increasing the 45Ca2+ influx in 40 min to three times that of resting cells. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, was only half as effective as epinephrine in stimulating maximal calcium uptake although it was equally effective in stimulating maximal amylase release in the same cells. Experiments with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine, the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, and the cholinergic antagonist atropine confirmed that alpha- and beta-adrenergic and cholinergic stimulation each had a direct stimulatory effect on 45Ca2+ uptake. N6,O2'-Dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate also caused some stimulation of net calcium uptake. Direct measurement of Ca2+ efflux indicated that the increased calcium uptake in the presence of epinephrine was not the indirect result of a decrease in efflux. The rates of both basal and epinephrine-stimulated calcium uptake increased with increasing calcium concentration in the medium. Epinephrine had little effect on the rate of calcium uptake at 0.15 mM Ca2+. Although the energy poison NaCN had little effect on the basal rate of calcium uptake, the stimulable component of calcium uptake was inhibited by NaCN at all calcium concentrations tested (0.2 to 4.1 mM).", 
    "28": "A multicentre pilot trial to assess the feasibility of undertaking a full-scale national trial of treatment for mild to moderate hypertension has been performed and is being continued. By February 1977 over 1800 patients had entered the trial and some have been under observation for three years. The results so far show that the definitive trial is administratively and scientifically feasible and ethically justified.", 
    "29": "Clonidine at doses of 0.5-1.0 mg/kg i.p. produced an initial rise followed by a sustained fall in blood pressure. The initial pressor response became more marked and the onset of hypotensive effect was delayed as the dose was increased to large doses such as 10-50 mg/kg given intraperitoneally. The heart rate was markedly reduced soon after clonidine administration and the bradycardia lasted for more than 2 hours. Both the initial pressor and subsequent hypotensive effects of clonidine were reduced by pretreatment with phentolamine, the initial pressor effects were suppressed by propranolol which did not affect the hypotensive effects. This initial pressor effect was potentiated while the hypotensive effect was reduced after bilateral vagotomy and pretreatment with either 6-hydroxydopamine or atropine. The bradycardia was significantly reduced by propranolol, atropine and bilateral vagotomy. Central sympathetic as well as parasympathetic mechanisms may be involved in cardiovascular changes after large doses of clonidine in urethanized mice.", 
    "30": "It has been shown that the human fat cell adenylate cyclase is activated by prostaglandins. Of the prostaglandins tested the E-type by causing about a 3-fold increase of enzyme activity, was more effective than the F-prostaglandins. Prostaglandin A2 had no stimulatory effect. Activation by prostaglandin E1 was not influenced by beta-adrenergic blockade in contrast to stimulation by epinephrine. Pretreatment of fat cells with trypsin resulted in an abolishment of PTH-sensitivity, but had no effect on prostaglandin responsiveness. These results suggest that the human fat cell adenylate cyclase is coupled to at least three distinct types of hormone receptors.", 
    "31": "1 Four hundred and eighty-three hypertensive patients being treated with propranolol or other hypotensive drugs were questioned about symptoms of gritty feelings, sore or red eyes, photophobia and use of eye drops. 2 Between 11.6% and 29.8% gave positive answers but there was no difference between the different drug regimes. The complaint of 'red eyes' was more common in smokers.", 
    "32": "1 In a double-blind crossover study, six volunteers performed sustained handgrip at 50% of maximal voluntary contraction before and 90 min following oral administration of 0.25 and 100 mg metoprolol tartrate, a beta1 selective adrenoceptor blocking agent. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured with the Auto-Manometer, an electronic semi-automatic device based on the principles of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine sphygmomanometer. It eliminates observer and digital bias completely, and also records heart rate at the same time as blood pressure is recorded. 2 Resting heart rate fell 15% after 25 mg, 21% after 100 mg and was unchanged after placebo. Systolic blood pressure fell 6% on both doses and was unchanged on placebo. Diastolic pressure did not change with any of the doses. 3 At 1 min of handgrip, heart rate was significantly lower after 25 and 100 mg than before drug or after placebo. There was no difference between the blood pressure levels attained before or after any of the dose levels. The rise of heart rate tended to be somewhat dampened after 100 mg only. The rise in blood pressure was unchanged after any dose compared with before.", 
    "33": "Oxprenolol is a new beta-adrenergic blocking drug, whose effectiveness in the treatment of various forms of glaucoma has been evaluated. The drug was administered topically as 0.5% -1%-2% solution. The results of the investigation may be summarized as follows: The instillation of the drug produces a transient and slight conjunctival hyperaemia and a not significant miosis. A significnat ocular hypotensive action has been observed in the treatment of chronic open-angle, hemorrhagic and congenital glaumiosis. A significnat ocular hypotensive action has been observed in the treatment of chronic open-angle, hemorrhagic and congenital glaucoma. The concentration of 0.5% Oxprenolol seems to be as effective as topical 1% Propranolol. At the same concentration (0.5%), Oxprenolol produces no significnat change of the systemic blood pressure or of the heart rate. Topical pre-treatment with 1% Oxprenolol inhibits the systemic side-effects (tachycardia) produced by topical Isoproterenol, a wellknown ocular hypotensive drug. The authors conclude the investigation affirming that Oxprenolol may represent a new effective means for the medical treatment of glaucoma.", 
    "34": "The possibility of differential diagnosis of ischemic heart disease and cardialgia at a polyclinic is analyzed. A total of 1110 patients with a preliminary diagnosis of ischemic heart disease were examined. In 214 of them the data gathered during many years of observations have cast doubt on the validity of this diagnosis. The patients of this group were made to undergo tests with potassium chloride and obsidan. Subject to appraisal were the ECG reaction and an analysis of angular variations of the vectors in the terminal portion of the ventricular complex. The described tests were shown to help determine the significance of \"functional\" or \"organic\" changes of the myocardium in the genesis of repolarizational ECG perturbances.", 
    "35": "Pharmacological blockade of autonomic control of the heart was studied in dogs performing mild, moderate, and severe running exercise on a level treadmill. The dogs were studied without drugs, after atropine, after propranolol, and after both atropine and propranolol. As compared with results without drugs, cardiac denervation resulted in elevated resting heart rate (+45 beats/min) but reduced heart rate during moderate (-17 beats/min) and severe exercise (-47 beats/min); no change in cardiac output at rest or during mild exercise but decreases (-23% and -25%) during moderate and severe exercise; and reduced first derivatives of left ventricular pressure at rest (-24%) and during exercise (-35, -41, and -52% for mild, moderate, and severe loads, respectively). Cardiac denervation did not alter end-diastolic left ventricular diameter but significantly increased end-systolic diameter during exercise. It is concluded that blockade of autonomic control of the heart diminishes cardiac output during exercise by reducing heart rate and myocardial contractile force but does not alter cardiac output at rest.", 
    "36": "Sotalol was given intravenously at doses of 20 to 60 mg to 20 selected patients with various cardiac arrhythmias. Ten of these patients subsequently received oral sotalol at doses of 80 to 160 mg twice a day. The drug was beneficial in 2 out of 2 patients with sinus tachycardia and in 4 out of 7 patients with other supraventricular tachycardias. The drug was particularly effective in lidocaineresistant ventricular arrhythmias since it was effective in 9 out of 11 patients. The blood pressure of the 4 patients who were hypertensive was significantly lowered while that of the normotensive patients was not affected. Three patients who suffered from severe myocardial disease developed sinus bradycardia, which was life-threatening in 2 of them.", 
    "37": "1. The effects of three inhibitory stimuli, sympathetic nerve stimulation, noradrenaline (NA) and isoprenaline have been examined on three forms of motor activity in the rabbit colon, the response to pelvic (parasympathetic) nerve stimulation, acetylcholine (ACh) and spontaneous tone.2. The response to pelvic nerve stimulation is most effectively inhibited by sympathetic nerve stimulation, much less effectively by NA and hardly at all by isoprenaline. The sympathetic nerves can inhibit the pelvic response at frequencies of stimulation which do not affect spontaneous tone. The inhibitory effect of sympathetic stimulation, and of NA, on the pelvic response is reduced by phentolamine 5 x 10(-6)M and unaffected by propranolol 5 x 10(-6)M suggesting the effect is mediated via alpha receptors.3. The response to ACh is inhibited by all three stimuli equally. The inhibitory effect of sympathetic nerve stimulation and of isoprenaline is reduced by propranolol 5 x 10(-6)M. The inhibitory effect of NA is also reduced by propranolol but to a lesser extent. Phentolamine 5 x 10(-6)M has a small effect in reducing the inhibitory effect of sympathetic nerve stimulation or of NA. This effect of phentolamine is lost if the participation of motor nerves in the response to ACh is excluded by either tetrodotoxin 10(-7) g/ml. or cold storage for 10-14 days. These results suggest that inhibition of the ACh response takes place mainly at the muscle by activation of beta receptors but that ACh may have a small indirect stimulant action through motor nerves and this is susceptible to inhibition through alpha receptors.4. All three stimuli are equally effective in lowering smooth muscle tone. This inhibitory effect of sympathetic nerve stimulation and of isoprenaline is reduced by propranolol 5 x 10(-6)M and unaffected by phentolamine 5 x 10(-6)M. The inhibitory effect of NA is reduced by propranolol but again is less sensitive to block than the other two inhibitory stimuli. Phentolamine is without effect on the inhibitory action of NA and the combination of phentolamine with propranolol is no more effective than propranolol alone. These results suggest that NA liberated by sympathetic nerves and isoprenaline inhibit myogenic tone in the smooth muscle by an action on beta receptors but the action of NA added to the bath cannot be fully explained in this way.", 
    "38": "The beta-adrenergic activity of 1-(4'-methylphenyl)-2-isopropylaminopropanol (H 35/25) was studied on isolated preparations (guinea pig atria, guinea pig and calf tracheal muscle, mouse cecum). H 35/25 shows variations in both affinity and intrinsic activity at the various levels tested. The discussion shows that this cannot be used as a means of characterizing beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "39": "Because of intractable ventricualr arrhythmias after a near-fatal episode of ventricular fibrillation, a patient with idiopathic mitral valve prolapse was subjected to mitral valve replacement. Vector analysis and intraoperative epicardial mapping localized the ectopic focus to the region of the posterior papillary muscle. The patient is alive and well two years after surgery; chronically inverted T waves have become upright. But propranolol and diphenylhydantoin are needed to prevent arrhythmias and T wave abnormalities during standing and exercise. Preoperatively, with the onset of mitral regurgitation and a second rapid phase of prolapse, the ventriculogram was deformed by abnormal midsystolic hyperkinesis at both sites of papillary muscle insertion. Postoperatively, focal hypokinesis appeared in the same areas, implying that they had been retracted by the prolapsing valve. Preoperatively, a papillary tip could be seen entering the mitral ring while coronary arteriography showed late systolic elongation of a small vessel feeding the anterior papillary muscle, suggesting that the papillary apparatus was indeed subject to damaging stress during the abnormal basal movement. Three other persons with severe mitral prolapse (but intact chordae) have had valve repacement and developed qualitatively similar changes in the ventriculogram. Papillary speciments in two showed significant fibrosis. Indication for operation in one of these was edpisodic ventricular fibrillation, which has not recurred. A spectrum of ventriculographic abnormality associated with mitral prolapse could be partly explained by hypokinesis of the papillary loops, variably disguised by retraction stress tansmitted from the billowing leaflets, translocation of blood into the expanding valve sail, and various degrees of unloading into the left atrium. Abnormal intraventicular flow may probably result from associated prolapse of the anterior leaflet and from buckling of the papillary sties toward the mitral annulus. Unusual physical findings in the operated cases and in eight other patients define a clinically recognizable syndrome in which severe prolapse abbreviates left ventricular ejection. Liability to symptoms and to progression of disease seems high in this group.", 
    "40": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether propranolol, which has been shown to reduce the extent of myocardial infarction, reduces microvascular injury which may play a role in exacerbating ischemia. Saline (10 dogs) or propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v., 7 dogs) was injected prior to a one hour occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Carbon black (1 ml/kg), which labels damaged and leaky vessels, was injected 5 min after release of the occlusion and allowed to circulate for two hours. By morphometric analysis of 1 micron thick sections, 75 +/- 12% of vessels and 84 +/- 7% of myocardial cells showed damage in untreated dogs; only 2 +/- 1% of vessels and 9 +/- 8% of myocardial cells showed damage in the propranolol-treated dogs (P less than 0.001). The number of carbon black-labeled vessels/10 fields/biopsy from comparable areas of ischemic tissue was 55 +/- 7 in untreated dogs and 27 +/- 3 in propranolol-treated dogs (P less than 0.001). The results suggest that propranolol not only protects the ischemic myocardial cell, but also significantly decreases the ischemic microvascular changes.", 
    "41": "We measured the characteristics of the decline in tension during isometric relaxation of canine papillary muscle. In the intact heart, relaxation begins with the isovolumic phase, but in experiments on papillary muscle previously reported the isotonic phase preceded the isometric phase during the course of relaxation. In our experiments, however, the isotonic bar was locked at the instant the muscle reached the end-systolic fiber length in order to hold the fiber at the length during the succeeding relaxation process. Therefore, we obtained a relaxation process similar to that occurring in the intact heart. The major results of these experiments are: (1) Maximum rate of the decline in tension (-dT/dtmax) is linearly related to the magnitude of total load. (2) -dT/dtmax is augmented by positive inotropic interventions and diminished by negative inotropic interventions. (3) An increase in preload results in only a slight increase in -dT/dtmax. (4) End-systolic fiber length itself is not a principal determinant of -dT/dtmax. (5) -dT/dtmax divided by total load is independent of the amount of muscle shortening. We, therefore, suggest that -dT/dtmax divided by total load cand be a useful index of the relaxation characteristics of cardiac muscle.", 
    "42": "Although plasma norepinephrine concentration often is elevated in patients with essential hypertension, the relevance of this to the pathogenesis of the blood pressure elevation remains uncertain. If the high concentration of plasma norepinephrine truly indicates sympathetic nervous system overactivity, it should be accompanied by hemodynamic features suggestive of sympathetic cardiovascular stimulation. This proposition was tested, and in part confirmed, in a study performed on 21 patients who had mild essential hypertension and on 11 normal subjects. Among hypertensive patients, plasma norepinephrine concentration was related to cardiac function but not to the level of the blood pressure or to total peripheral vascular resistance. Plasma norepinephrine concentration correlated significantly with heart rate and cardiac preejection period index at rest and with changes in cardiac output, heart rate, and preejection period after cardiac beta-adrenergic blockade produced by propranolol, 0.2 mg/kg intravenously. Patients with an elevated plasma norepinephrine concentrations (9 of 21) showed features of sympathetic cardiac stimulation, manifested by an elevated mean cardiac index and heart rate at rest and by normalization of both after treatment with propranolol. Thus, substantial agreement existed among three commonly used indices of sympathetic nervous system activity--plasma norepinephrine concentration, general hemodynamics at rest, and the hemodynamic response to pharmacologic autonomic blockade.", 
    "43": "Norepinephrine (8 mM) produced a rapid and readily reversible rounding and vacuolation in mouse peritoneal macrophages. The rapid onset and offset of these changes suggested something other than classical pinocytosis as a mechanism. The morphological changes were inhibited by cytochalasin B but not by propranolol. Norepinephrine lowered the contact angle between a macrophage monolayer and a sessile drop of saline. This indication of increased membrane hydrophilicity is consistent with an increase in membrane surface pressure. Norepinephrine had no effect on neutral phospholipid (phosphatidylcholine) monolayers but expanded acidic phospholipid (phosphatidylserine) monolayers over a wide range of surface pressures (15-40 dynes/cm). Based on these observations, it is suggested that norepinephrine may produce the morphological changes by expanding the macrophage membrane to the point of membrane buckling and/or by a viscotropic stimulation of membrane enzymes which, in turn, activate microfilaments.", 
    "44": "The intrinsic sinoatrial (SA) rate at rest and during exercise was measured in 5 normal male subjects after prolonged oral and acute intravenous administration of propranolol and atropine. At rest, the intrinsic SA rate was similar after both oral and intravenous propranolol. At the higher levels of power output on a cycle ergometer, cardiac rate was slower after oral than after intravenous propranolol. When the intravenous study was repeated with the use of an additional dose of propranolol, cardiac rate was lower at comparable levels of power output, but not as low as that after oral propanolol. Differences in responses were interpreted as reflecting varying degrees of beta blockade, the most complete being that after prolonged oral propranolol administration of 320 mg daily. The intravenous dose of propranolol usually used to obtain the \"pharmacologically isolated heart\" at rest is too small to induce full beta blockade in exercise.", 
    "45": "A study of a new beta-adrenergic blocking drug TIMOLOL (Blocadren) in the treatment of essential hypertension has been undertaken. Twelve hypertensive patients previously undiagnosed and untreated were studied. Results with a twice a day dose of the drug showed a satisfactory fall in systolic and diastolic pressures in all but one patient, who was withdrawn from the trial because of excessive bradycardia. Apart from bradycardia, no serious side effects were observed in the patients. Observation over longer period is advocated to determine the place of Timolol in our antihypertensive armamentorium.", 
    "46": "Stimulation of cutaneous or muscle nerve as well as activation of ventral roots L6--S1 led to inhibition of vagal bradycardia evoked by noradrenaline, in unanesthetized decerebrated cats. Unnociceptive stimulation of m. gastrocnemius in unrestrained cats evoked contraction of the muscle and was followed by depression of the cardiac component of baroreceptive reflex. Propranolol had no effect on this response, while methylatropin abolished it completely.", 
    "47": "The effect of propranolol on plasma triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine uptake by Sephadex G-25 (RT3U%) was studied in fourteen thyrotoxic patients and eight normal volunteers. 40 mg of propranolol as a single oral dose caused significant reduction in total serum T3 which began 60 min after administration. No significant changes were observed in T4 and RT3U% values. Plasma T3 levels remained suppressed during a 5 day course of treatment with propranolol. These results suggest that propranolol has a direct effect on peripheral metabolism of T3 rather than on thyroid hormone secretion.", 
    "48": "Previous studies have suggested that there is an overproduction of triiodothyronine (T(3)) relative to thyroxine (T(4)) in patients with thyrotoxicosis associated with Graves' disease. To evaluate whether or not an increased ratio of T(3) to T(4) in thyroidal secretion could be contributing to this relative T(3) hyperproduction, T(3), T(4), and iodine were measured in thyroglobulin (Tg) from controls and patients with Graves' disease who had been treated either with propranolol only or with antithyroid drugs plus iodide before surgery. To avoid possible artifacts associated with pulse labeling and chromatography, T(3) and T(4) were determined by radioimmunoassay of Pronase hydrolysates of purified Tg. Results of analyses of Tg from six control patients and seven with Graves' disease, not receiving thiourea drugs or iodide, showed that the iodine content of Graves' disease Tg was not different from normal. Both contained 3.4 residues of T(4)/molecule Tg, but there was 0.39+/-0.08 (mean+/-SD) residue of T(3)/molecule Tg in Graves' Tg as opposed to 0.23+/-0.07 residue T(3) molecule Tg in controls matched for iodine content (P < 0.01). This difference resulted in a significantly lower T(4)/T(3) molar ratio (9+/-2) in Graves' Tg as opposed to control (15+/-2, P < 0.001). In Tg from patients with treated Graves' disease, iodine, T(3), and T(4) were reduced, but the reduction in the latter was more substantial, resulting in a T(4)/T(3) molar ratio of 3.4+/-1. Fractionation of Tg from all groups by RbCl density gradient ultracentrifugation indicated that at physiological levels of Tg iodination, the molar ratio of T(3)/Tg was consistently higher in Graves' disease. The specific mechanism for this difference is not known, but it is not due to iodine deficiency. If T(3) and T(4) are secreted in this altered ratio in patients with Graves' disease, the magnitude of the difference could explain the relative T(3) hyperproduction which is characteristic of this state.", 
    "49": "A new familial case of the Romano-Ward syndrome in a young girl of 21 years is reported. A progressive worsening of the condition with multiple syncopal attacks, together with difficulty in controlling the patient, lead us to carry out a left stellate ganglionectomy. The operation did not lead to any shortening of the QT interval. It appeared in the end that propranolol was the most effective way of preventing the syncopal attacks.", 
    "50": "Thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) tests were performed at 4 or 8 weeks intervals, after the initiation of anti-thyroid treatment in 15 patients with Graves' disease. All TRH test were negative as long as the serum levels of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) were elevated, and normalization of the serum levels of these hormones always occurred before the response to iv TRH was restored. In 13 patients the time from the patients for the first time were registered as biochemically euthyroid varied from 0-9 months (mean 3.1 months), before TRH response was restored. Two patients were still TRH non-responsive at the end of the study, even though they had been biochemically euthyroid for as long as 17 and 18.5 months. The TRH test, therefore, is not helpful in the evaluation of the effect of anti-thyroid treatment in patients with Graves' disease. There was an increase in the serum level of (TSH) from 3.4 +/- 0.3 (SEM) to 4.3 +/- 0.5 (SEM) ng/ml (P less than 0.05), and a decrease in the serum level of total T4 from 19.4 +/- 1.1 (SEM) to 5.8 +/- 0.8 (SEM) microng/100 ml in 13 patients from the first examination until the last time they were examined before restored TRH response. This finding shows that the pituitary gland has retained its ability to synthesize and secrete TSH even though no TSH could be released by iv TRH. In 6 TRH non-responsive patients with Graves' disease, serum TSH levels were suppressed from 2.5 +/- 1.2 (SEM) ng/ml before the administration of a single dose of 3 mg T4 orally, to 0.9 +/- 0.2 (SEM) ng/ml, 7 days after the T4 administration. Thus, the negative feed-back effect on the pituitary gland of the thyroid hormones is operating in these patients. This finding indicates that the TRH non-responsiveness in euthyroid patients with Graves' disease is not due to pituitary depletion of TSH, since the negative feed-back effect of the thyroid hormones is operating normally."
