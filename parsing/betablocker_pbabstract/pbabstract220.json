Recordings with intracellular sharp microelectrodes and patch-clamp pipettes were used to investigate these interactions in layer V pyramidal cells of brain slices obtained from the rat PFC. Dopamine (100 microM) potentiated N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA; 10mM)-evoked depolarizations, but did not change those elicited by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA; 1mM). Dopamine (100 microM) increased the amplitude of the NMDA (30 microM)-induced currents as well, and 1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-(1H)-3-benzazepine-7,8-diol (SKF 38393; 1, 10 microM), a D(1) receptor agonist, concentration-dependently reproduced this effect. Furthermore, 7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-(1H)-3-benzapine hydrochloride (SCH 23390; 10 microM), a D(1) receptor antagonist, reversed both the dopamine- and the SKF 38393-evoked potentiation. The D(2) receptor agonists lisuride and quinpirole (10 microM both), as well as noradrenaline (100 microM) failed to mimic the stimulatory effect of dopamine. Isoproterenol (1, 10 microM) concentration-dependently facilitated NMDA responses. However, neither this effect at 10 microM nor that of dopamine at 100 microM could be antagonized by propranolol (10 microM), a non-selective beta adrenoceptor blocker. The isoproterenol-induced facilitation of NMDA currents was abolished by SCH 23390 (10 microM). The results indicate that dopamine potentiates NMDA responses in layer V pyramidal cells of the PFC solely by activating D(1) receptors. D(2) receptors and alpha or beta adrenoceptors are not involved in the dopamine-NMDA interaction.",

The risk of stroke, however, tended to be lower in the atenolol than in the placebo group (0.85 [0.72-1.01]). When atenolol was compared with other antihypertensives, there were no major differences in blood pressure lowering between the treatment arms. Our meta-analysis showed a significantly higher mortality (1.13 [1.02-1.25]) with atenolol treatment than with other active treatment, in the five studies comprising 17671 patients who were followed up for a mean of 4.6 years. Moreover, cardiovascular mortality also tended to be higher with atenolol treatment than with other antihypertensive treatment. Stroke was also more frequent with atenolol treatment.",

The purpose of this article is to provide the HF practitioner with practical information about how to make these distinctions and how to develop a treatment plan for the HF patient that incorporates important information about OLD. The pathophysiology of OLD and HF is reviewed first, followed by details on the assessment of dyspnea and the management of acute exacerbations of OLD.

    "16": "Left-ventricular systolic dysfunction, or heart failure (HF), is a chronic, progressive condition with a poor prognosis. Approximately 50% of deaths, especially in mild to moderate cases, are sudden. Most sudden deaths are thought to be due to ventricular tachycardia; however, premature ventricular contractions and couplets parallel severity of HF and have been associated with increased mortality risk as opposed to dysrhythmic death. Ventricular arrhythmogenesis results from many mechanisms (afterdepolarizations, reentry, and enhanced automaticity) and preconditions (electrophysiologic abnormalities, neuroendocrine activation, electrolyte imbalances, scar from an ischemic event in ischemic cardiomyopathy, fibrosis in dilated cardiomyopathy, hemodynamic abnormalities, and HF medical management). Nurses are key caregivers in optimally managing HF, either by direct actions or by using advocacy, communication, and collaboration skills to promote positive outcomes. Ventricular dysrhythmia management consists of facilitating core HF pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic medical therapies, using amiodarone to improve symptoms, as needed, and utilizing implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death.",

    "21": "In the tunica muscularis of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, gap junctions form low-resistance pathways between pacemaker cells known as interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and between ICC and smooth muscle cells. Coupling via these junctions facilitates electrical slow-wave propagation and responses of smooth muscle to enteric motor nerves. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) has been shown to uncouple gap junctions, but previous studies have shown apparent nonspecific effects of GA in a variety of tissues. We tested the effects of GA using isometric force measurements, intracellular microelectrode recordings, the patch-clamp technique, and the spread of Lucifer yellow within cultured ICC networks. In murine small intestinal muscles, beta-GA (10 muM) decreased phasic contractions and depolarized resting membrane potential. Preincubation of GA inhibited the spread of Lucifer yellow, increased input resistance, and decreased cell capacitance in ICC networks, suggesting that GA uncoupled ICCs. In patch-clamp experiments of isolated jejunal myocytes, GA significantly decreased L-type Ca(2+) current in a dose-dependent manner without affecting the voltage dependence of this current. The IC(50) for Ca(2+) currents was 1.9 muM, which is lower than the concentrations used to block gap junctions. GA also significantly increased large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents but decreased net delayed rectifier K(+) currents, including 4-aminopyridine and tetraethylammonium-resistant currents. In conclusion, the reduction of phasic contractile activity of GI muscles by GA is likely a consequence of its inhibitory effects on gap junctions and voltage-dependent Ca(2+) currents. Membrane depolarization may be a consequence of uncoupling effects of GA on gap junctions between ICCs and smooth muscles and inhibition of K(+) conductances in smooth muscle cells.", 
    "22": "Decreased beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) number occurs both in animal models of cardiac hypertrophy and failure and in patients. beta-AR recycling is an important mechanism for the beta-AR resensitization that maintains a normal complement of cell surface beta-ARs. We have shown that 1) in severe pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy, there is extensive microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4) decoration of a dense microtubule network; and 2) MAP4 microtubule decoration inhibits muscarinic acetylcholine receptor recycling in neuroblastoma cells. We asked here whether MAP4 microtubule decoration inhibits beta-AR recycling in adult cardiocytes. [(3)H]CGP-12177 was used as a beta-AR ligand, and feline cardiocytes were isolated and infected with adenovirus containing MAP4 (AdMAP4) or beta-galactosidase (Adbeta-gal) cDNA. MAP4 decorated the microtubules extensively only in AdMAP4 cardiocytes. beta-AR agonist exposure reduced cell surface beta-AR number comparably in AdMAP4 and Adbeta-gal cardiocytes; however, after agonist withdrawal, the cell surface beta-AR number recovered to 78.4 +/- 2.9% of the pretreatment value in Adbeta-gal cardiocytes but only to 56.8 +/- 1.4% in AdMAP4 cardiocytes (P < 0.01). This result was confirmed in cardiocytes isolated from transgenic mice having cardiac-restricted MAP4 overexpression. In functional terms of cAMP generation, beta-AR agonist responsiveness of AdMAP4 cells was 47% less than that of Adbeta-gal cells. We conclude that MAP4 microtubule decoration interferes with beta-AR recycling and that this may be one mechanism for beta-AR downregulation in heart failure.",

All the patients had hemodynamic, endocrine and renal measurements before and after administration of Carvedilol or placebo. They underwent creatinine clearance, lithium clearance, plasma renin activity, concentration of plasma aldosteron and urinary sodium excretion. Hemodynamic effects were assessed by portal flow volume and velocity, cardiac output and medium blood pressure.",

    "28": "The functional roles of phenylalanine at position 120 in drug oxidation by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) were examined using a yeast cell expression system and bufuralol (BF) enantiomers as a chiral substrate. Two mutated cDNAs, one encoding a CYP2D6 mutant having alanine instead of Phe-120 (F120A) and another encoding a mutant having alanine instead of Glu-222 (E222A), were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and transformed into yeast cells via pGYRI vectors. The enantiomeric BF 1''-hydroxylase activities of the mutants were compared with those of the wild type. When enantiomeric BF 1''-hydroxylase activities at a substrate concentration of 100 microM were compared, the CYP2D6 wild type showed substrate enantioselectivity of (R-BF > S-BF) and the F120A mutant exhibited substrate enantioselectivity of (R-BF < or = S-BF), whereas the product diastereoselectivity of (1''R-OH-BF < 1''-S-OH-BF) was similar between the wild type and the mutant. The activities of the other mutant (E222A) were much lower than those of the wild type and the F120A mutant, while its substrate enantioselectivity and product diastereoselectivity were the same as those of the wild type. The kinetics demonstrated that apparent K(m) values were similar among the recombinant enzymes, and V(max) values clearly reflected the selectivity described above. These results indicate that Phe-120 has a key role in the enantioselective BF 1''-hydroxylation by CYP2D6.", 
    "29": "Activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is increased in heart failure. Agents which act on the RAAS can be expected to benefit these patients. Recent trials which have furthered our understanding of drugs which are of benefit in heart failure--angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists--are discussed. It is desirable to use multiple agents for best results in patients with heart failure. New European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of heart failure are expected later this year.", 
    "30": "Significant progress has been made in the last few years in the management of heart failure. In particular, several trials have given significant results. It has become apparent that heart failure may be prevented in some patients by treatment of risk factors such as coronary artery disease. Experience with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has shown that the survival and symptomatic benefits do last in the long term, and confirm that they are the first-line treatment in heart failure. The results of a number of trials using the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) candesartan, valsartan and losartan are presented and discussed. There is also some experience now in the use of candesartan for patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular systolic function. The COMET trial compared the beta-blockers carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate, and suggests that there may be differences in clinical effect between beta-blockers. The selective aldosterone receptor blocker eplerenone was evaluated in the EPHESUS trial in post-MI patients with signs of heart failure. Based on these clinical trials, heart failure guidelines are now being updated.", 
    "31": "Survival in patients with heart failure remains very poor, and is worse than that for most common cancers, including bowel cancer in men and breast cancer in women. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is not completely blocked by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Blockade of the RAAS at the AT1-receptor has the theoretical benefit of more effective blockade of the actions of angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) prevent the breakdown of bradykinin: this has been blamed for some of the unwanted effects of ACE-Is although bradykinin may have advantageous effects in heart failure. Consequently, ACE-Is and ARBs might be complementary or even additive treatments; recent trials have tested these hypotheses. The Candesartan in Heart failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM) programme compared the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) candesartan (target dose 32 mg once daily) to placebo in three distinct but complementary populations of patients with symptomatic heart failure. These were: patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) who were ACE-I-intolerant (CHARM-Alternative); patients with reduced LVEF who were being treated with ACE-Is (CHARM-Added); and patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function (CHARM-Preserved). There were substantial and statistically significant reductions in the primary composite end point (risk of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for heart failure) in CHARM-Alternative. This was also the case in CHARM-Added, supporting and extending the findings of Val-HeFT. In CHARM-Preserved, the effect of candesartan on the primary end point did not reach conventional statistical significance though hospital admission for heart failure was reduced significantly with candesartan. In the CHARM-Overall programme there was a statistically borderline reduction in all-cause mortality with a clear reduction in cardiovascular mortality. All-cause mortality was reduced by 12% in the two CHARM trials in patients with low LVEF. CHARM succeeded in answering a number of questions about the safety and efficacy of ARB use in heart failure. It showed evidence for a clinical benefit of candesartan both additive to and independent of ACE-I use. The benefits in terms of clinical outcomes were seen irrespective of beta-blocker usage. Benefits in patients with preserved LVEF were shown in the proportion of patients hospitalised with worsening heart failure and in overall number of admissions for heart failure. Candesartan had expected effects on blood pressure and renal function, emphasising the need for careful patient monitoring.", 
    "32": "Treatment of heart failure has undergone major changes in the last two decades. European and US guidelines have absorbed these major changes and set the new standards. It is therefore mandatory that treatment of heart failure is based on this knowledge. According to these guidelines, patients with chronic symptomatic heart failure should be treated with a diuretic and sometimes digoxin and vasodilators, to relieve symptoms, in addition to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and/or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a beta-blocker to improve prognosis. An aldosterone antagonist should be added in patients with more advanced heart failure. Prevention of heart failure has also become a major goal. We summarise here the major issues regarding the pharmacological treatment of chronic heart failure as indicated by the European and US guidelines.", 
    "33": "The intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) of a beta-adrenoceptor blocker can be mediated by beta(1)- or beta(2)-adrenoceptors. The aim of this study was to characterize the ISA of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker carteolol in healthy volunteers. Two approaches were employed. First, we assessed the effects of carteolol (20, 40 or 80 mg p.o.) on blood pressure, heart rate and heart-rate corrected duration of electromechanical systole (QS(2)c, a measure of cardiac contractility) in the volunteers. Carteolol dose-dependently increased systolic blood pressure, heart rate and contractility and decreased diastolic blood pressure. The beta(1)-adrenoceptor blocker bisoprolol did not attenuate these carteolol effects, but rather enhanced the effects on heart rate and systolic blood pressure. Second, we treated volunteers for 7 days with 1 x 20 mg/day carteolol and assessed lymphocyte beta(2)-adrenoceptor density (by (-)-[(125)I]-iodocyanopindolol binding) and functional responsiveness (by 10 muM isoprenaline-induced increase in lymphocyte cyclic AMP content). Carteolol significantly reduced lymphocyte beta(2)-adrenoceptor density and function. After withdrawal of carteolol lymphocyte beta(2)-adrenoceptor density and function recovered only very slowly and had not returned to control levels 11 days after carteolol withdrawal. In conclusion, the fact that, on the one hand, the cardiovascular effects of carteolol were not attenuated by the beta(1)-adrenoceptor blocker bisoprolol and, on the other, carteolol significantly decreased lymphocyte beta(2)-adrenoceptor density and function is in favour of the idea that the ISA of carteolol is mediated by beta(2)-adrenoceptors. Involvement of an additional receptor site (e.g. the propranolol-resistant state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor), however, cannot be excluded.", 
    "34": "The implementation of guidelines for medical therapy of heart failure may be problematic for the following reasons: 1. Elderly patients and women were underrepresented in large clinical trials which may limit their therapeutic impact in these patients. 2. Therapeutic decisions are influenced by co-morbidities like renal failure, obstructive airway disease (COLD, Asthma), stroke, and diabetes mellitus. We therefore discuss the differential therapy of heart failure in view of particular patient subgroups.", 
    "35": "The mechanism of phospholipase (PLC)-delta activation by G protein-coupled receptor agonists was examined in rabbit gastric smooth muscle. Ca(2+) stimulated an eightfold increase in PLC-delta1 activity in permeabilized muscle cells. Treatment of dispersed or cultured muscle cells with three G(i/o)-coupled receptor agonists (somatostatin, delta-opioid agonist [D-Pen(2),D-Pen(5)]enkephalin, and A(1) agonist cyclopentyl adenosine) caused delayed increase in phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis (8- to 10-fold) that was strongly inhibited by overexpression of dominant-negative PLC-delta1(E341R/D343R; 65-76%) or constitutively active RhoA(G14V). The response coincided with capacitative Ca(2+) influx and was not observed in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+), but was partly inhibited by nifedipine (16-30%) and strongly inhibited by SKF-96365, a blocker of store-operated Ca(2+) channels. Treatment of the cells with a G(q/13)-coupled receptor agonist, CCK-8, caused only transient, PLC-beta1-mediated PI hydrolysis. Unlike G(i/o)-coupled receptor agonists, CCK-8 activated RhoA and stimulated RhoA:PLC-delta1 association. Inhibition of RhoA activity with C3 exoenzyme or by overexpression of dominant-negative RhoA(T19N) or Galpha(13) minigene unmasked a delayed increase in PI hydrolysis that was strongly inhibited by coexpression of PLC-delta1(E341R/D343R) or by SKF-96365. Agonist-independent capacitative Ca(2+) influx induced by thapsigargin stimulated PI hydrolysis (8-fold), which was partly inhibited by nifedipine ( approximately 25%) and strongly inhibited by SKF-96365 ( approximately 75%) and in cells expressing PLC-delta1(E341R/D343R). Agonist-independent Ca(2+) release or Ca(2+) influx via voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels stimulated only moderate PI hydrolysis (2- to 3-fold), which was abolished by PLC-delta1 antibody or nifedipine. We conclude that PLC-delta1 is activated by G(i/o)-coupled receptor agonists that do not activate RhoA. The activation is preferentially mediated by Ca(2+) influx via store-operated Ca(2+) channels.",

Myocytes were isolated from subendocardial, midmyocardial, and subepicardial regions of the noninfarcted left ventricular wall. Action potentials and calcium current were recorded using whole-cell patch clamp technique.", 
    "38": "The action potential duration of repolarization 90 % (APD90) was more prolonged in midmyocardium rather than in subepicardium and subendocardium with healed myocardial infarction. The transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) was increased in the three ventricular regions. The amplitude of I(Ca-L) [was enhanced but its density was decreased in noninfarcted ventricular myocytes due to increased cell membrane capacitance. The increased differences of calcium currents among subepicardium, midmyocardium, and subendocardium were also discovered. Normalization of heterogeneous changes in repolarization after treatment with imidapril was observed and decrease of TDR in noninfarcted area was measured. Early after depolarization (EAD) events of noninfarcted midmyocardium were markedly decreased by imidapril.",

    "40": "A reliable method is presented for the chiral separation of three basic drugs (mexiletine, chlorpheniramine and propranolol) with serum albumins (human and porcine, HSA and PSA) as chiral selectors by capillary electrophoresis in combination with the partial filling technique. Based on the systematic optimization of operation variables, the chiral separation of mexiletine, chlorpheniramine and propranolol was achieved in the pH 7.4 phosphate buffer by using HSA, PSA and PSA as selectors, respectively. The chiral recognition ability of HSA and PSA was compared. HSA and PSA show a different chiral recognition ability for each of the three drugs. In addition, the association constants between enantiomeric drugs and proteins were determined to be 2.00 and 3.80 x 10(2) M(-1) for mexiletine and HSA, 0.59 and 1.12 x 10(3) M(-1) for chlorpheniramine and PSA, and 0.87 and 1.42 x 10(3) M(-1) for propranolol and PSA. The method for the chiral separation and determination of association constants possesses the advantages of simple performance, effective avoiding of the interference of the UV detection from protein, and lowering of the reagent consumption.",

In malignant and potential malignant ventricular arrhythmias Darob has been efficient on long term (1 year) in 77.67% cases, while in curative treatment of non-malignant ventricular arrhythmias Darob has been efficient in 68.31% cases. 2. Only minor proarrhythmogenic effects have been noticed for the doses of Darob used in this study. 3. long-term administration of Darob seems to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular deaths (35.30% cardiac deaths and 64.70% non-cardiac deaths have been recorded; p < 0.05). 4.

However, evaluation of maximal voluntary effort during exercise testing is often in question because current equations to predict maximum heart rate (HR(max); eg, 220 - age) are based on subjects without heart disease or BB therapy. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an age-specific equation to predict HR(max) in patients with CHD who are receiving BB therapy.", 
    "44": "We queried the Henry Ford Preventive Cardiology Outcomes database for patients with a history of myocardial infarction or revascularization procedure; preserved left ventricular function; age, 40 to 80 years; sinus rhythm; and a graded treadmill test with a respiratory exchange ratio > or =1.10. Data were split, based on date, such that tests performed between November 1996 and April 2001 were used as the BB prediction equation development group (n = 334; 73% men) and those performed between May 2001 and April 2002 were used as the BB cross-validation group (n = 94; 84% men). Linear regression was used to develop the equation to predict HR(max), based on age, and to calculate the correlation coefficient of the prediction equation among the cross-validation group.", 
    "45": "The resultant prediction equation was HR(max) = 164 - 0.7 x age (r2 = 0.13), with a standard error of the estimate of 18 per minute. Among the cross-validation group, mean predicted HR(max) was not significantly different from mean measured HR(max) (P = .7). The mean error of prediction was -0.4 +/- 2.0 per minute (mean +/- SEM), and the correlation was r = 0.38.", 
    "46": "This new equation provides a better estimate of HR(max) for patients with CHD receiving BB therapy than previously reported equations. Additional variables may improve the equation but may not be as convenient to use.", 
    "47": "Previous studies have documented an underuse of evidence-based therapies in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, many of these studies failed to consider contraindications to therapy, the effect of age (ie, elderly vs non-elderly patients) on use, or both. The objective of this study was to determine whether elderly patients are less likely than non-elderly patients to receive evidence-based AMI treatments, both before and after the consideration of contraindications to therapy.", 
    "48": "A retrospective chart review of a random sample of 5131 patients with AMI who were admitted to 1 of 44 hospitals in Ontario was conducted for the fiscal years 1994 to 1996. Using the Canadian Cardiovascular Research Team (CCORT)/Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Quality Indicators for AMI Care, we classified patients as being eligible or ideal (ie, no contraindications to treatment) candidates to receive aspirin, beta-blockers, thrombolysis, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), or statins or to undergo lipid profiling. The proportions of eligible and ideal patients who received treatment were calculated, and the latter were compared with benchmarks.", 
    "49": "The median age of the cohort was 69 years; 63% were of the patients were aged > or =65 years. There was underperformance of prescribing treatments in ideal candidates relative to benchmarks (eg, aspirin at discharge: 78.6% vs 90% benchmark). The odds of ideal (ie, no contraindications) elderly candidates receiving various evidence-based AMI treatments were consistently less than that of non-elderly patients with AMI, with the exception of ACEIs at discharge (odds ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.22-1.74).", 
    "50": "Despite adjustments for contraindications to therapy, the underuse of AMI treatments, particularly in elderly patients, was found.", 
    "51": "FOUR THERAPEUTIC CLASSES FOR SECONDARY PREVENTION: These are statins (benefit comparable to that obtained following myocardial infarction or stroke), antiplatelet drugs, basically aspirin, clopidogrel that currently has no place in first-line treatment, converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. There is currently insufficient data to recommend the routine use of vasoactive agents in patients presenting with claudication. IN THE CASE OF CRITICAL ISCHAEMIA: When faced with this serious situation, one must control the pain and the infection and, all cases, revascularisation should be attempted. Amputation should be proposed in the case of trophic disorders and gangrene. ANGIOGENESIS, A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE: This is defined by the budding, from existing vessels, of new vessels under the impact of growth and stabilising factors. It is possible to distinguish arteriogenesis with development of pre-existing collateral vessels, angiogenesis itself that corresponds to the development of small vessels from the large vessels and vasculogenesis, which is the formation of new vessels mediated by circulating endothelial progenitors.", 
    "52": "PHARMACOLOGICAL MODIFICATIONS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT: In elderly patients, there is a modification in the distribution columns of drugs, an alteration in glomerular filtration (doses require adaptation) and tubular function (greater sensitivity to low salt diet and diuretics), and a reduction in the hepatic elimination capacity. FOR SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: The choice of drugs is in practice the same as that for younger patients: diuretics, antialdosterone agents, converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta-blockers and digitalics. FOR DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: The therapeutic approach combines an etiologic treatment (blood pressure, myocardial ischaemia), prevention and the rapid treatment of the decompensation factors (atrial arrhythmia), a pharmacological treatment (converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and bradycardia lowering agents). Non-pharmacological measures include dietary restrictions, regular physical exercise, and education for the patient and the family.", 
    "53": "A relatively high-throughput high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method using a chiral derivatization reagent was developed for the quantitative determination of carvedilol enantiomers in human plasma. S-carvedilol and R-carvedilol are extracted from human plasma by protein precipitation using acetonitrile containing racemic [(2)H(5)]-carvedilol as an internal standard. Extracts are then derivatized with 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate (GITC) and analysed using HPLC-MS/MS with a TurboIonspray (TIS) interface and selected reaction monitoring. Using 150microL of plasma, the method was validated over a concentration range of 0.2-200ng/mL. The maximum within-run precision observed in a three run quality control was 8.2% for S-carvedilol and 6.7% for R-carvedilol, respectively. The maximum percentage bias observed at all quality control sample concentrations was 9.4% for S-carvedilol and 11.6% for R-carvedilol, respectively. The HPLC-MS/MS method was also compared with a previously developed high-performance LC/fluorescence method by analysing 25 samples containing racemic carvedilol. Based on results obtained, these two methods were found to be equivalent. However, compared with LC/fluorescence method, HPLC-MS/MS method is more sensitive, uses less plasma, and also employs a less time-consuming sample preparation process.", 
    "54": "In response to pressure-overload, cardiac function deteriorates and may even progress to fulminant heart failure and death. Here we questioned if genetic enhancement of left ventricular (LV) contractility protects against pressure-overload. Transgenic (TG) mice with cardiac-restricted overexpression (66-fold) of the alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(1A)-AR) and their non-TG (NTG) littermates, were subjected to transverse aorta constriction (TAC)-induced pressure-overload for 12 weeks. TAC-induced hypertrophy was similar in the NTG and TG mice but the TG mice were less likely to die of heart failure compared to the non-TG animals (P <0.05). The hypercontractile phenotype of the TG mice was maintained over the 12-week period following TAC with LV fractional shortening being significantly greater than in the NTG mice (42+/-2 vs 29+/-1%, P <0.01). In the TG animals, 11-week beta-AR-blockade with atenolol neither induced hypertrophy nor suppressed the hypercontractile phenotype. The hypertrophic response to pressure-overload was not altered by cardiac alpha(1A)-AR overexpression. Moreover, the inotropic phenotype of alpha(1A)-AR overexpression was well maintained under conditions of pressure overload. Although the functional decline in contractility with pressure overload was similar in the TG and NTG animals, given that contractility was higher before TAC in the TG mice, their LV function was better preserved and heart failure deaths were fewer after induction of pressure overload.", 
    "55": "Myocardial infarction (MI), peripheral vascular disease and ischaemic cerebral vascular accident (CVA) are three manifestations of the same disease, atherothrombosis, and they share the same pathophysiology and prognosis.", 
    "56": "The aim of this work was to describe the clinical characteristics and the medical management of polyvascular patients in cardiology.", 
    "57": "Cardiologists from all over the country participated in a consultation register for 3 weeks. The clinical characteristics and medical management for the first 3 patients on the register for each cardiologist were studied in a national multicentre study and then compared according to whether the atherothrombotic disease was isolated or polyvascular.", 
    "58": "In total, 100,429 patients were examined during the period of the register and 2,780 were included in the study. Polyvascular patients represented 7% of the register and 22% of the vascular patients. These patients with multiple manifestations were frequently diabetics. A lipid profile was available less often in the cardiac patients when they had another disorder (72.4%) than in the case of an isolated disorder (78.9%). Whatever the initial disorder, dyslipidaemia was less often controlled in the case of polyvascular disease (63% of LDL-C > or = 1.3g/l in polyvascular cardiac patients vs 52% in cardiac patients with isolated disease). In cardiac patients, the presence of peripheral vascular disease was associated with less prescription of beta blockers (OR=0.4 [0.3-0.6]), the presence of CVA was associated with less prescription of statins (OR=0.7 [0.5-0.9]). Eight out of 10 polyvascular patients received anti-platelet aggregation treatment. The presence of multiple atherothrombotic manifestations was associated with greater prescription of ACEI, except in cardiac patients.", 
    "59": "These results improve our understanding of the specific management of polyvascular patients, for whom secondary prevention is paramount due to the higher risk of recurrence. They should prompt the reinforcement of measures which have been shown to be effective, such as managing major risk factors, and in particular the dislipidaemias.", 
    "60": "The PRINCEPS study (Prise en charge des Insuffisants Cardiaques: Enqu\u00eate chez les Patients Symptomatiques) was carried out by 1,717 general practitioners who reported their experience with 3,782 patients with cardiac failure treated by an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. This is the largest observational study carried out in general practice in France to date. The average age of the patients with cardiac failure was 71 years, with a majority of men (62%), many of whom were hypertensive (76%) and had other cardiovascular risk factors. The diagnosis of cardiac failure was made by the presence of effort dyspnoea (92%) and confirmed by a cardiologist in 81% of cases. Heart failure was rarely chronic (17%>5 years), usually related to hypertension (58%) and had required hospital admission in only 39% of patients. Finally, the patients were not very symptomatic (63% Class II of the NYHA Classification). Treatment included the obligatory ACE inhibitor at a high dosage (maximal dosage according the European Recommendations) in half the patients. The dosage prescribed was considered optimal in 3 out of 4 patients, and usually treated by the consulting cardiologist (81% of patients). It was higher in the young patients, less symptomatic, and in patients with heart failure due to hypertension. A treatment with betablockers (20%), diuretics (74%), digitalis (21%), was often associated with the ACE inhibitor. These results suggest that heart failure patients treated by general practitioners have hypertension as the main cause. The ACE inhibitors seem to be prescribed initially at high dosage for treating the hypertension, and the dosage is progressively decreased with time and aggravation of the cardiac failure.", 
    "61": "Life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias can occur in young patients without structural heart disease (idiopathic forms). In many patients, these are typically triggered by an increased sympathetic tone, eg, by physical or mental stress. In contrast, in Brugada syndrome, ventricular tachyarrhythmias more often occur during rest or sleep when the vagal tone is predominant. Furthermore, adrenergic agonists can reduce the level of ST-segment elevation, whereas it is increased by parasympathetic agonists or adrenergic antagonists. The aim of this study was to investigate presynaptic and postsynaptic myocardial sympathetic function in patients with Brugada syndrome.", 
    "62": "Nine patients with Brugada syndrome (6 male, 3 female; age, 41+/-13 years) were enrolled in this study. The cardiac autonomic nervous system was assessed noninvasively, quantifying myocardial presynaptic and postsynaptic sympathetic function by means of positron emission tomography with the norepinephrine analogue 11C-Hydroxyephedrine (11C-HED) and the nonselective beta-blocker 11C-CGP 12177 (11C-CGP). Presynaptic sympathetic norepinephrine recycling, assessed by 11C-HED, was globally increased in patients with Brugada syndrome compared with a group of age-matched healthy control subjects (92.9+/-16.2 mL/g versus 69.1+/-14.2 mL/g; P<0.05), whereas postsynaptic beta-adrenoceptor density, assessed by 11C-CGP, was similar in patients and control subjects (10.4+/-6.7 pmol/g versus 10.2+/-2.9 pmol/g; P=NS).", 
    "63": "The present study on autonomic innervation in Brugada syndrome describes an enhanced presynaptic norepinephrine recycling with preserved beta-adrenoceptor density, further supporting the hypothesis of an autonomic dysfunction in Brugada syndrome. This is a further step toward the understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease with potential future impact on therapeutic strategies.", 
    "64": "Beta-blocking therapy is the standard therapy in non-operated Marfan patients, however its efficacy after entire aortic replacement is unknown. The aim of this study was to describe the influence of (nearly) entire aortic replacement and beta-blocking therapy on blood pressure and wave reflections in Marfan patients.", 
    "65": "Four Marfan patients (mean age 31+/-3 years) and 8 age matched control subjects were studied. Blood pressure and wave reflections (reflection coefficient and augmentation index) were studied by means of magnetic resonance imaging, continuous non-invasive blood pressure measurements and applanation tonometry. Patients were studied with atenolol, labetalol and without beta-blocking therapy.", 
    "66": "In Marfan patients, aortic systolic pressure (129+/-13 vs 114+/-10 mmHg), pulse pressure (58+/-13 vs 40+/-5 mmHg), wave speed (11+/-3 vs 4+/-0.4 m s(-1)) and reflection coefficient (65+/-22 vs 41+/-5%) were significantly increased compared to controls. There was no difference in aortic pressure between various medications in Marfan patients (atenolol 129/76 mmHg, labetalol 121/75 mmHg and without beta-blocking therapy 129/71 mmHg). Higher reflection coefficients were seen in patients with atenolol compared to discontinued medication (73+/-18 vs 65+/-22%), and also the augmentation index was higher with atenolol compared to labetalol and discontinued medication (24+/-22 vs 17+/-17 vs 22+/-22%, respectively).", 
    "67": "Our results describe increased pulse pressure, systolic pressure, wave speed and wave reflections in four Marfan patients after entire aortic replacement. The use of atenolol or labetalol did not decrease aortic pressure and with atenolol increased wave reflections were observed. Therefore, the beneficial effect of atenolol in these patients is doubtful.",

    "69": "Although ACEI and carvedilol produce benefits in heart failure, whether the order of initiation of therapy determines the impact on left ventricular (LV) function and New York Heart Association functional class (NYHA FC) has not been determined.", 
    "70": "A single-center, prospective, randomized, open-label study was performed. We evaluated whether initiation of therapy with carvedilol either before (n = 38) or after (n = 40) perindopril therapy in newly diagnosed patients in NYHA FC II to III heart failure with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, with the addition of the alternative agent after six months, determined subsequent changes in NYHA FC and LV function (echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography). Study drugs were titrated to maximum tolerable doses.", 
    "71": "There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the study groups. After 12 months 11 patients died (6 in the group where the ACEI was initiated). At 12 months the group receiving carvedilol as initial therapy achieved a higher tolerable dose of carvedilol (43 +/- 17 mg vs. 33 +/- 18 mg, p = 0.03); a lower dose of furosemide (p < 0.05); and better improvements in symptoms (NYHA FC, p < 0.002), LV ejection fraction (radionuclide: 15 +/- 16% vs. 6 +/- 13%, p < 0.05; echocardiographic, p < 0.01), and plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide concentrations (p < 0.02).",

    "73": "This study evaluated the efficacy of pindolol, a noncardioselective beta blocker with intrinsic sympathetic activity, on neurocardiogenic syncope using a head-up tilt-table test in 66 patients. Pindolol was equally effective in men and women and the 2 age groups (>60 and <60 years) of the study cohort. The earliest benefit was seen </=3 days after initiating treatment. Side effects were better tolerated in younger patients (age <60 years).", 
    "74": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors differ in their affinity for tissue-bound ACE. It has been hypothesized that tissue ACE affinity might be responsible for some of the beneficial cardiovascular properties of ACE inhibitors. The present study examined this question and found no correlation between tissue ACE affinity and risk of first nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients who have hypertension.", 
    "75": "The clinical benefits of statins in acute coronary syndromes are well established, but the optimal time for administration in this setting has not been well studied. In this study, patients who had acute coronary syndrome and received statins <24 hours of presentation had lower incidences of death, stroke, reinfarction, heart failure, and pulmonary edema compared with delayed administration. Prompt administration of statins appears to be significantly beneficial in patients who present with an acute coronary syndrome.", 
    "76": "Patients who have had heart failure (HF) face very high risks of hospitalization and mortality. Despite the compelling scientific evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, and beta blockers decrease rates of hospitalization and mortality in patients who have had HF, these life-prolonging therapies continue to be underused. Many studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that important numbers of patients who have had HF are not receiving treatment with these evidence-based therapies, which are recommended by national guidelines, when guided by conventional care. This HF treatment gap results from a variety of complex issues, including lack of systems and disease management programs. This gap in beta-blocker therapy may be due in part to persisting perceptions, despite recent evidence to the contrary, that it should be delayed until patients who developed HF have been stable for 2 to 4 weeks after hospital discharge and that its initiation results in a substantial risk of worsening HF. Conversely, recent clinical trial evidence has substantiated that beta blockers can be safely initiated for patients with HF in the hospital and that there are early benefits, including decreased risks of mortality and hospitalization for worsening HF. It has become increasingly evident that in-hospital initiation of evidence-based cardiovascular therapies and patient education have a positive effect on long-term patient compliance and clinical outcomes. Adopting in-hospital initiation of these therapies as the standard of care (in the absence of contraindications or intolerance) in patients who have HF and stabilized systolic dysfunction could substantially improve treatment rates, decrease the risk of future hospitalizations, and prolong life in the large number of patients who are hospitalized each year for HF.", 
    "77": "Primary percutaneous coronary intervention proved to be superior to thrombolysis in reducing ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEAMI) mortality. However, whether such benefit is similar in women and men remains unclear. The aim of the present analysis was to assess the independent effect of female gender on management and on early and 1-year mortality in Florence, Italy, where primary percutaneous coronary intervention is the preferred reperfusion strategy for STEAMI. The study included a cohort of 920 unselected patients with STEAMI (men = 627, women = 293) prospectively enrolled in the AMI-Florence, population-based registry over 12 months. Women were older (76 vs 68 years, p <0.001) and more frequently had Killip class >I heart failure than men. The median delay to hospital admission was marginally longer in women (160 vs 130 minutes, p = 0.09). Coronary reperfusion treatment was performed less often in women (49% vs 58%, p <0.013); primary percutaneous coronary intervention was performed more often in both genders (90% vs 91%) and with similar median door-to-balloon time (50 vs 45 minutes, p = 0.44). Both in-hospital (16% vs 8%, p <0.001) and 1-year mortality (25% vs 18%, p = 0.016) were higher in women. However, after adjusting for age and other baseline characteristics, reperfusion treatment (odds ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78 to 2.08) and 1-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.24) were independent of female gender. Compared with conservative therapy, reperfusion treatment was associated with a similar reduction in 1-year mortality in women (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.02) and men (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.92). Our data suggest that older age and several age-related factors may largely account for the higher mortality of women after STEAMI. Even in the general population,improvement in prognosis associated with reperfusion treatment is independent of gender.", 
    "78": "Cardiovascular diseases and strokes are the main reasons of premature deaths in 70% patients with non insulin-dependent and also insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Hypertension is 2 to 3 times more frequent in diabetic patients than in the rest of population. In the guidelines for management of hypertension in diabetes published this year beta-blockers are proposed together with the ACE-inhibitors as the first-choice drugs. The latest studies did not confirm the risk of higher and prolonged hypoglycemia during cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocade, but the insulin-treated diabetics with hypoglycemia episodes in the past should be watched very carefully when given beta-blockers. It is emphasized, that beta-blockers are very useful especially in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and coronary artery disease. In patients after myocardial infarction the advantages with treatment with beta-blockers dominate over the potential risk of adverse drug reactions.", 
    "79": "Chronic heart failure affects between 1-5% of the population and rise steeply with age. Most patients with chronic heart failure should be routinely managed with a combination of 4 types of drugs: a diuretic, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), beta-blocker and usually digitalis. Diuretics are essential for symptomatic treatment when fluid overload is present, and should always be administrated in combination with ACE-I if possible. ACE-I improves survival and symptoms and reduces hospitalization in patients with moderate to severe ventricular systolic dysfunction, and in the absence of fluid retention should be given first. Angiotensin II receptor antagonist could be considered in patients who not tolerate ACE-I. beta-blocking agents are recommended for treatment of patients with stable, mild, moderate and severe heart failure unless there is a contraindication. Bisoprolol, metoprolol and carvedilol have been associated with reduction in total mortality, cardiovascular mortality and sudden death. Cardiac glycosides are indicated in atrial fibrillation and any degree of symptomatic heart failure in order slow ventricular rate. Indications for antiarrhythmic drug therapy include atrial fibrillation, non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia. Oral anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, and there is a lack of evidence to support the use of antithrombotic therapy in patients in sinus rhythm.", 
    "80": "Beta-adrenergic blockers are one of the most frequently prescribed cardiovascular drugs. Numerous beta-blockers are available for clinical use. Although these agents differ substantially, it is not clear whether (and which) differences are clinically relevant. Most of the important differences among agents reflect the relative specificity for beta1-, beta2-, and alpha-adrenergic receptors. Selection of a particular agent and target dose is probably best guided by available trial data, even though data are limited. Nonselective agents (with or without alpha-blocking properties) devoid of intrinsic sympathetic activity (ISA) are most appropriate postinfarction. Evidence exists demonstrating a mortality benefit postinfarction for propranolol, timolol, metoprolol, and, in the presence of left ventricular dysfunction, carvedilol. In the setting of heart failure, the selective agents metoprolol and bisoprolol as well as the nonselective agent carvedilol (which possesses alpha-blocking properties) have a demonstrated mortality benefit. Not all tolerated beta-blockers are associated with a survival benefit and it is probably not advisable to extrapolate benefits to all drugs with similar (although probably not identical) properties. Carvedilol may possess advantages over other beta-blockers and a possible survival advantage, suggested by the recent Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET), although these findings are not universally accepted. Ultimately, selection of a specific agent avoids obvious contraindications and uses trial data to guide selection and dose as long as side effects are absent or tolerable.", 
    "81": "Data from a number of clinical trials of beta blocker therapy in heart failure, although limited in the size of African American patients included, suggest that they achieve a similar benefit as Caucasians. African Americans were usually at higher risk when enrolled in all of these studies with a higher incidence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The only exception is the Beta Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) that studied the efficacy of Bucindolol in heart failure. In that study there appeared to be a unique differential effect in African Americans compared to Caucasians which may have been in part related to the severity of the disease.", 
    "82": "Under-representation of women in heart failure trials has limited our knowledge of heart failure in women to extrapolation of findings from men. Significant sex related differences in clinical and laboratory characteristics exist in systolic heart failure including better survival in women. The value of various therapeutic interventions should be based on proven effect in women and not on an assumption based on proven benefit in men. Among the medications currently recommended for patients with systolic heart failure, beta-blockers have the strongest data supporting their efficacy in women.", 
    "83": "Although beta-adrenergic blocking agents are not always considered anti-arrhythmic drugs, the results of several recent trials have suggested an anti-arrhythmic mechanism for at least part of their mortality benefit in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. We review background experimental and clinical evidence for the anti-arrhythmic actions of beta-blockers and then review the results of published beta-blocker heart failure trials. A majority of trials showed improvement in overall survival as well as reduction in sudden death and ventricular arrhythmias with beta-blocker treatment. Although different effects were seen with different specific agents, these trials overall support a clinically significant anti-arrhythmic effect of several beta-blockers.", 
    "84": "Although beta-blockers have been used for nearly three decades in the management of heart failure, only recent randomized clinical trials have demonstrated substantial benefit in reducing morbidity and mortality. Carvedilol, metoprolol succinate and bisprolol have evidence supporting their use in heart failure while other beta blockers either lack evidence supporting their use or have not been shown to be useful in heart failure. The only currently approved beta-blockers in the U.S. for heart failure are metoprolol succinate and carvedilol.Beta-blockers differ in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. It should not be assumed that potential benefit in heart failure is a class effect since differences in the half-life, volume of distribution, protein binding, and route of elimination may give rise to differences in duration of beta blockade and potential drug interactions. Furthermore, pharmacodynamic differences exist because of selectivity for beta(1), beta(2) or alpha(1) adrenoreceptor blockade among the beta-blockers. Receptor kinetics also differ among the beta-blockers and this may influence the extent and duration of beta and alpha blockade across the category. Carvedilol is an inherently long-acting beta-blocker while the duration of beta blockade for metoprolol is dependent on the salt and formulation, which is used. Metoprolol tartrate is a short-acting form of metoprolol while metoprolol succinate is a longer acting salt and the commercially available product is designed as a once daily formulation. A recently published trial, the Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) tested carvedilol given twice daily versus metoprolol tartrate given twice daily in patients with chronic heart failure. Although carvedilol reduced all cause mortality when compared with metoprolol tartrate, extrapolation to similar findings with metoprolol succinate are not possible since the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of these two formulations are different. Furthermore, the dosing of metoprolol tartrate in COMET may have been inadequate based on prior studies. Additional studies are needed to compare carvedilol directly to metoprolol succinate before concluding inequivalency exists for these two beta-blockers in heart failure.", 
    "85": "Beta-blockers are not an homogeneous group of agents. Only three beta-blockers, carvedilol, bisoprolol and metoprolol succinate, have had favorable effects on prognosis in controlled clinical trials in the patients with chronic heart failure. However, pharmacological differences exist between them. Metoprolol and bisoprolol are selective for beta(1)-adrenergic receptors while carvedilol blocks also beta(2)-, and alpha(1)- adrenergic receptors, and has associated antioxidant, anti-endothelin and antiproliferative properties. In COMET carvedilol was associated with a significant reduction in mortality compared to metoprolol tartrate further showing that different beta-blockers may have different effects on the outcome. These differences may be related to the ancillary properties of carvedilol or to its broader antiadrenergic profile. However, also more effective and prolonged blockade of beta1 adrenergic receptors may occur with carvedilol compared to metoprolol.", 
    "86": "Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers are effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in heart failure. These drugs slow the progression of heart failure by modifying the remodeling process, prevent or delay need for hospital admission for heart failure. They reduce both pump failure and sudden arrhythmic death. There are many patients that do not receive beta blocker therapy in the heart failure population. Patients are often treated with beta blockers not tested in clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy in this patient population. Results from the recently published trials are summarized to emphasize the proper selection and dosage of beta blocker therapy to optimize the care of this high risk population.", 
    "87": "The benefit of beta blockade has been well established in acute myocardial infarction for several decades, and its benefit in chronic heart failure has been proven since the early 1990's. Several large retrospective analyses suggested the benefit of beta blockers in post-MI systolic dysfunction. Only recently has the benefit of beta blockers been proven in addition to ACE inhibitors, antiplatelet agents, and reperfusion therapy. In the year 2000, CAPRICORN became the first randomized trial to directly address beta blockade in patients with post-infarction systolic dysfunction. The trial showed a 23% reduction in all-cause mortality with carvedilol, in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors, antiplatelet agents, and reperfusion therapy. This is a review of the literature on the administration of beta blockade in patients after acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, as well as a comment on other current treatment modalities for this subset of patients.", 
    "88": "Enhanced and sustained cardiac adrenergic drive occurs in heart failure and contributes, in part, to the progression of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and remodeling that are characteristic features of this disease state. Enhanced sympathetic drive in heart failure can lead to down-regulation and desensitization of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors with a consequent impairment of myocardial reserve and exercise tolerance. This sympathoadrenergic maladaptation can also lead to cellular abnormalities in the failing heart manifested by defects in calcium cycling within the sarcoplasmic reticulum, by defects in myocardial energetics and by ongoing loss of cardiomyocytes through necrosis or apoptosis. Sympathoadrenergic overdrive in heart failure can also trigger the induction of the fetal gene program, a maladaptation that can lead to further compromise of the contractile state. Chronic treatment with beta-blockers in patients with heart failure and in animals with experimentally-induced heart failure has been shown to reverse, prevent, or at the very least, arrest many, if not all, of these adverse processes. Beta-blockers improve function of the failing LV, prevent or reverse progressive LV dilation, chamber sphericity and hypertrophy, and consequently positively impact cardiac remodeling. Beta-blockers also reduce heart rate and LV wall stress leading to reduced myocardial oxygen consumption, a clear benefit to the failing heart. Beta-blockers can also improve the intrinsic contractile function of cardiomyocytes and have also been shown to improve myocardial energetics in heart failure possibly through a desirable shift in substrate utilization. Recent studies from our laboratories have also shown that chronic therapy with beta-blockers in heart failure can attenuate cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Finally, chronic therapy with beta-blockers has been shown to abrogate induction of the fetal gene program. These benefits provide strong reinforcement to the clinical findings that beta-blockers are highly beneficial in the management of patients with chronic heart failure and, when properly used, afford unequivocal reductions in mortality and morbidity in this patient population.", 
    "89": "To clarify contradictions in past reports and the package inserts for beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta-blockers) for patients with intermittent claudication (IC), we investigated the effects of beta-blockers in patients with IC using the systematic review technique. Data sources were randomized, controlled trials that investigated the effects of beta-blockers compared with the placebo or untreated group (controls) in patients with IC. Primary endpoints were walking distance and walking time, and secondary endpoints were ankle-brachial index (ABI) and calf blood flow. Nine trials were included in the analysis. Meta-analysis showed that there was a significant worsening in maximal walking distance and initial claudication distance in patients receiving beta-blockers, with standardized mean differences of -0.31 and -0.39 (95% confidence interval -0.58 to -0.04 and -0.73 to -0.06, P=0.03 and 0.02, respectively) compared with controls. There were no significant differences in maximal walking time (0.07, -0.24 to 0.37), time to onset of claudication (0.12, -0.23 to 0.47), ABI at rest (0.24, -0.30 to 0.78), calf blood flow at rest (0.00, -0.26 to 0.25), and calf blood flow after exercise (-0.23, -0.69 to 0.22). However, only one trial evaluated ABI, and the number of cases is increasing, suggesting that beta-blockers do not worsen ABI. There was no evidence that beta-blockers prescribed for patients with IC have unsuitable \"precautions\" in the package inserts. However, reluctance to administer beta-blockers to patients because they have IC is not appropriate.",

Propranolol, a nonspecific beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, and H-8, a selective inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), suppressed the inhibition of the PAF-induced platelet aggregation by vanadate. Vanadate increased the cAMP content in platelets accompanied by the activation of PKA. The beta-adrenergic receptors of platelets have been reported to be abundant in the beta(2) isoform, coupled to adenylyl cyclases (R. Kerry and M. C. Scrutton, Br. J. Pharmacol., 79, 681-691 (1983)). When the washed platelets were preincubated with vanadate, salbutamol, a selective beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist, or 8-Br-cAMP, the latter two mimicked the vanadate-induced anti-platelet aggregation and prolongation of clotting time of plasma, suggesting involvement of the increased intracellular cAMP content in both actions of vanadate. Butoxamine, a selective beta(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonist, suppressed both actions of vanadate. The vanadate-induced increase in cAMP content was inhibited in part by butoxamine or genistein. These results suggest that vanadate inhibits the PAF-induced platelet aggregation by the stimulation of a cAMP/PKA-dependent process via the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor and receptor tyrosine kinases, and that the anti-platelet aggregation is involved in part in mechanisms of the anticoagulant action of vanadate.",

    "94": "An 86-year-old woman suffered sudden onset chest discomfort and dyspnea during sleep in the early morning of August 1, 2003. On admission, electrocardiography demonstrated complete atrioventricular block. Echocardiography showed severe hypokinesis in the left ventricular apex and hyperkinesis at the base. Serum cardiac deviant enzymes were slightly elevated. Based on these findings, acute myocardial infarction accompanied by complete atrioventricular block was suspected. Emergency coronary angiography performed under temporary pacing showed no significant stenosis in the coronary arteries. However, ventriculography demonstrated the presence of a foxhole-shaped left ventricular abnormality. A VDD type permanent pacemaker was implanted 5 days after the onset of the symptoms because the atrioventricular block had not improved. Following the implantation, pleural effusion and a temporary elevation of the body temperature occurred. The myocardial scintigraphy using 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) in the acute phase demonstrated extensive cardiac sympathetic nerve damage in the left ventricular apex. This condition was managed by medication including diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blocker and beta-blocker. Three months later, echocardiography and 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy showed slight recovery of wall motion and sympathetic activity. However, mild pleural effusion persisted. A complete atrioventricular block was also present at this stage. In view of these findings, this case suggested that the foxhole-shaped left ventricular abnormality induced complete atrioventricular block with delayed recovery of wall motion.",

Despite the wide use of the RPE scale, there is an inconsistency regarding the accuracy of that scale for chronic heart failure (CHF) patients treated with beta-blockers. The study examined the correlation between RPE and heart rate (HR), percentage of maximal HR (%MHR), ventilation (VE) and oxygen consumption (VO2) during graded treadmill testing and examined the RPE scale as a guideline for training intensity for CHF patients treated with beta-blockers. Fourteen men age 57.7 \u00b1 10.2 yrs diagnosed with CHF and treated with beta-blockers participated in the study. During a Balke treadmill test the subjects RPE, HR, VE and VO2 ml\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) were monitored. Low to moderate significant correlations were found between RPE and HR, %MHR, VE and VO2 ml\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) (r = 0.44, 0.43, 0.55 and 0.69 respectively, all p < 0.001). Some subjects exhibited clinical symptoms (e.g. fall of systolic blood pressure, ST depression/elevation) despite relatively low RPE. The RPE may be used to indicate the level of exercise intensity; however it may not represent the HR responses in CHF patients on beta-blocker medication. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the HR in combination with RPE when prescribing exercise intensity for CHF patients on beta blocker medication. Key PointsRPE correlated with HR, VE and VO2 in CHF patients on beta blockers.There was a large RPE inter-individual variability during graded treadmill tests.RPE can be used as an exercise intensity indicator for patients on beta-blockers, however, it must be taken with caution.",

Many ophthalmologists believe this objective is best achieved by methods that improve ocular blood flow to the optic nerve head. Beta-blockers are effective ocular hypotensive agents, but they can reduce choroidal blood flow. Bimatoprost, a new prostamide analogue, has been shown to have a better IOP-lowering effect compared with the nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker timolol maleate, but little is known about its effects on the vascular bed of the eye.",

One group continued monotherapy with timolol, 2 drops per affected eye BID. The other group was switched (without washout) to bimatoprost 0.3% ophthalmic solution (2 drops per affected eye QD [9 pm]). Treatment was given for 180 days.

In the bimatoprost group the IOP remained unchanged and the pOBF was decreased by 38.9% compared with baseline (P < 0.01). All AEs were mild to moderate and included conjunctival hyperemia and ocular itching (5 patients [26.3%] in the bimatoprost group) and pigmentation of periorbital skin (2 patients [40.0%] in the bimatoprost group). The incidence of each AE was higher in the bimatoprost group than in the timolol group (P = 0.008).", 
    "101": "In this population of patients with POAG, bimatoprost was associated with increased pOBF, and the reduction in pOBF associated with timolol was corrected after patients were switched to bimatoprost. Bimatoprost was associated with increased choroidal blood flow, beyond the levels recorded before timolol treatment. The decreased IOP level achieved in the timolol group seemed to be improved further by bimatoprost. Considering the potential efficacy of bimatoprost on IOP and pOBF, we suggest that this new drug may represent a clinical advance in the medical treatment of POAG.",

The beta2-adrenoceptor may also have a low-affinity state or site, while the beta3-adrenoceptor--the original low-affinity beta-adrenoceptor--can display more than one pharmacology. In this issue, Mallem et al. show that CGP-12177 relaxes thoracic aorta rings from normal rats by stimulating vascular smooth muscle low-affinity beta1-adrenoceptors, apparently linked in part to Gi protein. By contrast, in rings from hypertensive rats, CGP-12177 acts mainly via endothelial beta3-adrenoceptors. This work raises the possibility that low-affinity states of beta-adrenoceptors have physiological roles, and suggests that they might be drug targets.", 
    "105": "5-Hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) blocks pharmacological and ischaemic preconditioning, and has been postulated to be a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels. However, recent work has shown that 5-HD is activated to 5-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA (5-HD-CoA), which is a substrate for the first step of beta-oxidation. We have now analysed the complete beta-oxidation of 5-HD-CoA using specially synthesised (and purified) substrates and enzymes, as well as isolated rat liver and heart mitochondria, and compared it with the metabolism of the physiological substrate decanoyl-CoA. At the second step of beta-oxidation, catalysed by enoyl-CoA hydratase, enzyme kinetics were similar using either decenoyl-CoA or 5-hydroxydecenoyl-CoA as substrate. The last two steps were investigated using l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD) coupled to 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. V(max) for the metabolite of 5-HD (3,5-dihydroxydecanoyl-CoA) was fivefold slower than for the corresponding metabolite of decanoate (l-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA). The slower kinetics were not due to accumulation of d-3-hydroxyoctanoyl-CoA since this enantiomer did not inhibit HAD. Molecular modelling of HAD complexed with 3,5-dihydroxydecanoyl-CoA suggested that the 5-hydroxyl group could decrease HAD turnover rate by interacting with critical side chains. Consistent with the kinetic data, 5-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA alone acted as a weak substrate in isolated mitochondria, whereas addition of 100 mum 5-HD-CoA inhibited the metabolism of decanoyl-CoA or lauryl-carnitine. In conclusion, 5-HD is activated, transported into mitochondria and metabolised via beta-oxidation, albeit with rate-limiting kinetics at the penultimate step. This creates a bottleneck for beta-oxidation of fatty acids. The complex metabolic effects of 5-HD invalidate the use of 5-HD as a blocker of mitochondrial K(ATP) channels in studies of preconditioning.",

This study investigated the in vitro and ex vivo effects of labetalol on respiratory burst in rabbit neutrophils. The production of superoxide anions was examined in activated purified rabbit neutrophils after intravenous administration of labetalol (4.0 mg/kg of body weight). At a concentration up to 200 mg/L, labetalol did not demonstrate any cytotoxic effects on neutrophils, as determined by enzyme lactate dehydrogenase activity. In the cell-free system, labetalol demonstrated no significant activity, but in formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-stimulated rabbit neutrophils, labetalol demonstrated concentration-dependent antioxidant activity. The in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) with the fMLP stimulus was 16.5+/-0.21 mg/L in the rabbit neutrophils and 13.2+/-0.16 mg/L in the human neutrophils. In the fMLP-stimulated rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes, labetalol demonstrated its peak inhibitory activity (47%) 3 hours after administration. The mechanism by which labetalol acts in the treatment of hypertension may occur from an interaction in the signaling pathway of protein kinase C activation. The antioxidant properties demonstrated in this mechanism contribute to the drug's antihypertensive action and thus, may reduce the risk of injuries inflicted by reactive oxygen species involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension.",

HGO was measured with a microdialysis probe implanted into the left lateral lobe of the liver. Stainless steel needles with a diameter of 0.25 mm were inserted into the right tibialis anterior muscle and connected to an electrical stimulator. The EA stimulation was delivered for 10 min at 10 mA, 20 Hz. Atropine was injected in order to block the action of the parasympathetic nerves, whereas phentolamine and propranolol were injected in order to block the action of the sympathetic nerves. Furthermore, adrenal sympathetic nerves were crushed bilaterally to block the reflex secretion of adrenal medullary hormones. The EA stimulation significantly increased HGO for 20 min after the onset of stimulation. The increases of HGO were abolished by severing the femoral and sciatic nerves, demonstrating that the responses are elicited via activation of somatic afferent nerves. Furthermore, the increases were diminished after severance of the adrenal sympathetic nerves, which regulate catecholamine secretion from the adrenal medulla. The increases were totally abolished after pretreatment with phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, and propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker. On the other hand, the increases of HGO in response to the EA stimulation were augmented after pretreatment with atropine, a muscarinic cholinergic blocker. The present results demonstrate that EA stimulation to a hindlimb can reflexly increase HGO via activation of somatic afferents and, thereby, sympathetic efferents, including sympathetic efferents to the adrenal medulla.

In the rat Freund's complete adjuvant model of inflammatory pain, s.c. administration of A-317491 dose-dependently reversed mechanical hyperalgesia. Maximum percent reversal (72%) was seen 3 h after administration at 10 mg/kg. Substantial plasma concentrations were measured for A-317491 after s.c. dosing 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg. However, the brain-to-plasma concentration ratio, determined 1 h after a 10 mg/kg s.c. dose, indicated limited penetration of A-317491 into the central nervous system.

Latanoprost treatment reduced the intraocular pressure (1OP)(p < 0.001) when compared to previous monotherapies including: beta-blockers (-4.0 +/- 3.7 mmHg, 42%), alpha-antagonists (-3.9 +/- 3.0 mmHg, 14%), miotics (-3.8 +/- 3.5 mmHg, 2%), or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI) (-3.8 +/- 3.6 mmHg, n = 16%), and adjunctive therapy including: beta-blocker and CAI (-3.7 +/- 3.1 mmHg, n = 12%), alpha-agonist (-3.7 +/- 3.4 mmHg, n = 5%), or pilocarpine (-3.4 +/- 3.7 mmHg, n = 6%), or CAI and alpha-agonist (-4.6 +/- 6.4 mm Hg, n = 2%)(p < 0.0017). The most common adverse event with latanoprost was ocular allergy (1.5% incidence).

    "147": "Patients with primary open angle glaucoma or normal tension glaucoma treated with 0.12% isopropyl unoprostone as monotherapy or in combination with a beta-blocker were eligible for this single-center clinical study. Of the 51 patients (51 eyes) enrolled, 18 were men and 33 were women aged 62.1 +/- 12.3 years (mean +/- SD). Twenty-two patients had primary open angle glaucoma, and 29 patients had normal tension glaucoma. Intraocular pressure was measured twice within 3 months prior to the switch, and the mean value was taken as the baseline. The patients were then switched to latanoprost (0.005%) monotherapy (once-daily administration), and changes in intraocular pressure were monitored. One physician measured intraocular pressure after 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks of administration in this 24-week study.",

    "150": "The need for new treatment strategies for cardiac arrhythmias has motivated our continuing development of gene therapeutic options. Previously, we reported a decreased heart rate in an acute model of atrial fibrillation after atrioventricular nodal gene transfer. Here, we expand those observations to persistent atrial fibrillation and severe heart failure.", 
    "151": "After 3 weeks of atrial fibrillation, domestic swine received atrioventricular nodal gene transfer with adenoviruses encoding beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), wild-type Galpha(i2) (wtGi), or constitutively active mutant (cGi). Heart rates in awake, alert animals were not altered by beta-gal or wtGi. cGi caused a sustained 15% to 25% decrease in heart rate. The wtGi effect became evident with sedation. A tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy was present before gene transfer. In the beta-gal group, cardiomyopathy worsened over time. In the wtGi group, the condition improved slightly, and in the cGi group, ejection fraction was near normal at the end of the study. TUNEL staining results corroborated this finding.",

    "153": "The possible mechanisms by which beta-adrenergic antagonists may act on the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system are still elusive. Recent studies reported a marked increase of postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) after acute beta-blockade associated with unchanged values of arterial blood pressure and baroreflex sensitivity. We tested the hypothesis that acute beta-blockade might also alter the oscillatory characteristics of MSNA, thus decreasing its effectiveness on peripheral vasoconstriction.", 
    "154": "In 11 healthy volunteers, ECG, MSNA, arterial pressure, and respiration were recorded before and after atenolol (0.05 mg/kg IV bolus) administration. The frequency distribution of RR interval, MSNA, systolic arterial pressure (SAP), and respiratory variability was assessed by spectrum and cross-spectrum analysis. Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (alpha-index) and plasma catecholamines (high-performance liquid chromatography) were measured. Atenolol induced a significant increase in RR interval (14.3+/-1.6%) with no changes in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure. MSNA increased (42+/-13% from 18+/-2 bursts per minute). The low-frequency (LF) component of RR and MSNA variability decreased (-44+/-7% and -24+/-5%, respectively), whereas the high-frequency (HF) component increased (163+/-55% and 34+/-11%, respectively), expressed in normalized units. Spectral coherence, an index of oscillatory coupling, decreased between LF(RR) and LF(MSNA), whereas it increased between HF(MSNA) and HF(Resp). SAP variability, alpha-index, and plasma catecholamines remained unchanged.", 
    "155": "Atenolol induced a change in MSNA frequency distribution reflecting a stronger respiratory coupling. This shift toward high frequency, despite an increase in MSNA, may lead to a less efficient sympathetic vasomotor modulation.", 
    "156": "Insight into the natural course and the clinical features of diabetic retinopathy as well as advances in understanding the pathogenesis and new developments for beneficial treatments of diabetic retinopathy have broadly enlarged during recent years. It is now well accepted that chronic hyperglycemia and arterial hypertension are the most important factors for microvascular damage in diabetes. Although established treatment modalities have not yet yielded prevention of blindness due to diabetes, there is a trend toward a broader therapeutic concept for patients with diabetes including general vasoprotection. In this context, the retina plays a major role as early retinopathy earmarks the vascular high-risk patient with diabetes. Accordingly, every proven measure should be taken to avoid what still happens in evidence-based medicine: \"lost in translation.\"", 
    "157": "To understanding the reversible or irreversible harm to the beta-adrenergic system in the brain of lead-exposed rats, this study sets up an animal model to estimate the change in the sympathetic nervous system of brain after lead exposure was withdrawn. We address the following topics in this study: (a) the relationship between withdrawal time of lead exposure and brain beta-adrenergic receptor, blood lead level, and brain lead level in lead-exposed rats after lead exposure was stopped; and (b) the relationship between lead level and beta-adrenergic receptor and cyclic AMP (c-AMP) in brain. Wistar rats were chronically fed with 2% lead acetate and water for 2 months. Radioligand binding was assayed by a method that fulfilled strict criteria of beta-adrenergic receptor using the ligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol. The levels of lead were determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. The c-AMP level was determined by radioimmunoassay. The results showed a close relationship between decreasing lead levels and increasing numbers of brain beta-adrenergic receptors and brain adenylate cyclase activity after lead exposure was withdrawn. The effect of lead exposure on the beta-adrenergic system of the brain is a partly reversible condition.", 
    "158": "Right ventricular (RV) outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO) is an uncommon complication of lung transplantation in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and both medical management and surgical intervention are required. A 28-year-old female with primary PH was referred and because she did not respond to medical treatment, living-donor lobar lung transplantation was performed. The operation was successful, but dyspnea and exercise intolerance developed during rehabilitation and transthoracic echocardiography revealed RVOTO. Intravenous disopyramide during cardiac catheterization reduced the pressure gradient from 35 mmHg to 16 mmHg without decreasing RV systolic pressure. However, electrical and hemodynamic parameters were adversely affected by disopyramide and thus, after cardiac catheterization, administration of fluid and a low dose of atenolol was started, and her symptoms improved. Transthoracic echocardiography showed improvement in the RVOTO. This case suggests that disopyramide should be avoided for patients with RVOTO following lung transplantation and that other negative inotropic agents, such as beta-blockers, are more effective for relief of RVOTO."
