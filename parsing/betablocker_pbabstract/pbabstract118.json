A 52-year-old woman who had acute heart failure with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and left bundle branch block was admitted to a university medical center. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images of the heart did not show any evidence of myocardial infarction or myocarditis. Rate-related left bundle branch block and subsequent left ventricular dyssynchrony resulted in acute systolic dysfunction that resolved with beta-blockade therapy that allowed heart rate control and narrowing of the QRS complex. Of note, the use of inotropic agents would have dramatically worsened the cardiac condition.", 
    "2": "A wealth of basic science data supports the hypothesis that the surgical stress response increases the likelihood of cancer dissemination and metastasis during and after cancer surgery. Anesthetic management of the cancer patient, therefore, could potentially influence long-term outcome. Preclinical data suggest that beneficial approaches might include selection of induction drugs such as propofol, minimizing the use of volatile anesthetics, and coadministration of cyclooxygenase antagonists with systemic opioids. Retrospective clinical trials suggest that the addition of regional anesthesia might decrease recurrence after cancer surgery. Other factors such as blood transfusion, temperature regulation, and statin administration may also affect long-term outcome.", 
    "3": "The overall incidence of perioperative death is relatively low. However, patients with coronary artery disease are at higher than average risk of perioperative cardiac complications. Thus, preoperative testing for cardiac disease should be done in certain patients in an effort to reduce postoperative mortality and morbidity. Patients who require emergent orthopaedic surgery are at greater risk of perioperative cardiac events than are those who undergo elective procedures. Certain modalities, such as beta blockers, statins, and alpha-2 agonists, may be started or continued in the postoperative period to further enhance cardiac function. We review the current recommendations for preoperative cardiac testing in orthopaedic patients and for perioperative management of orthopaedic patients with known cardiac disease.", 
    "4": "Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a rare but important complication of pulmonary arterial hypertension. beta-Adrenoceptor blocking agents are commonly used to treat SVT, but they are potentially dangerous in the context of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Their negative inotropic and chronotropic effects are poorly tolerated in this condition, where cardiac reserve is compromised by a reduced and fixed stroke volume, and their administration can result in significant cardiorespiratory compromise. This is not a new discovery, but it is nonetheless poorly recognised in day-to-day clinical practice.", 
    "5": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a brain area crucial for memory, attention, and decision making. Specifically, the noradrenergic system in this cortex is involved in aversive learning, as well as in the retrieval of these memories. Some evidence suggests that this area has an important role during taste memory, particularly during conditioned taste aversion (CTA), a model of aversive memory. Despite some previous evidence, there is scarce information about the role of adrenergic receptors in the mPFC during formation of aversive taste memory and appetitive/incidental taste memory. The goal of this research was to evaluate the role of mPFC beta-adrenergic receptors during CTA acquisition/consolidation or CTA retrieval, as well as during incidental taste memory formation using the model of latent inhibition of CTA. The results showed that infusions in the mPFC of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol before CTA acquisition impaired both short- and long-term aversive taste memory formation, and also that propranolol infusions before the memory test impaired CTA retrieval. However, propranolol infusions before pre-exposure to the taste during the latent inhibition procedure had no effect on incidental taste memory acquisition or consolidation. These data indicate that beta-adrenergic receptors in the mPFC have different functions during taste memory formation: they have an important role during aversive taste association as well as during aversive retrieval but not during incidental taste memory formation.",

    "13": "A simple multidimensional system for direct injection of large volumes has been developed for the determination of five beta-blockers (atenolol, nadolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol and betaxolol) in wastewater using fluorescence detection. A C18 50 mm x 4.6 mm i.d. column coupled to a RP Amide C16 150 mm x 4.6 mm i.d. column for analyte clean-up and determination were used, respectively. The capability of a first column for eliminating large, interfering molecules, combined with an optimised, coupled-column liquid chromatography separation procedure (LC-LC), large volume injection (LVI) and fluorescence detection (FD), gave excellent sensitivity and selectivity for the target analytes. The LVI-LC-LC-FD method combines analyte isolation, preconcentration and determination into a single step. Detection limits obtained in wastewater were lower than, or equal to, 0.0020 microg L(-1). Limits of quantification (LOQs) obtained in the matrix according to IUPAC, ranged between 0.0052 and 0.0089 microg L(-1), whereas LOQs calculated according to EURACHEM Guidance, varied between 0.4 and 0.6 microg L(-1). Accuracy values ranged from 82 to 107% (n=3) and relative standard deviation (RSD) values ranged from 0.8 to 9%.

To address this issue, the authors examined patterns of antihypertensive medication prescribing among 5668 hypertensive inpatients. Outcomes were treatment with any antihypertensive medication and treatment with first-line therapy, defined as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, or calcium channel blockers. Logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, race, length of stay, service line, and comorbidity were used for all comparisons. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for treatment were higher for men (1.4, P<.001), older patients (2.5 for age older than 80 vs 1.0 for age younger than 40; P<.001), non-white race (1.2 vs 1.0 for white race; P<.004), and generalist service line (1.4 vs 1.0 for all other services; P<.001). Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for receiving first-line agents were higher for older patients and generalist service line. Among surgical patients, receipt of medical consultation was only marginally associated with higher odds of antihypertensive or first-line treatment after adjustment for relevant clinical variables. Demographic factors and service line appear to play a major role in determining the likelihood of inpatient hypertension treatment. Understanding and addressing these disparities has the potential to incrementally improve hypertension control rates in the population.", 
    "15": "Hypertension, diabetes, and obesity frequently coexist and significantly contribute to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Weight loss in obese individuals has been associated with improved blood pressure control and regression in left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. The authors investigated the impact of comorbidity and medication on clinical and echocardiographic parameters after weight loss in obese patients. Serial echocardiography and clinical data were collected in 62 patients before bariatric surgery and after 6 months or 10% weight loss. Obese patients with diabetes or hypertension had higher baseline LV mass (LVM) (334 + or - 73 g in hypertension and diabetes vs 252 + or - 97 g in hypertension and 219 + or - 75 g in disease-free patients, P = .003; P = .089 for differences in LVM indexed by height), despite the lack of significant differences in body mass index or systolic blood pressure. There were no significant differences in baseline LVM or LVM index related to the medication used to treat hypertension. After weight loss, patients on beta-blocker therapy experienced the most significant LV hypertrophy regression (-76.5 + or - 79.1 g with beta-blockers, -17.8 + or - 43.7 g with diuretics, -4.5 + or - 46.6 g with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and -23.1 + or - 50.9 g in not treated patients, overall P = .538; beta-blockers vs no therapy P < .005; P = .145 for differences in LVM index).

    "16": "In the last decade, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been considered a syndrome with multiple phenotypical facets and systemic components. Chronic diseases are associated, in time, with several comorbidities. Cardiovascular disease represents the most common comorbidity in COPD, increases its handicap and mortality indices. Most entities associated with cardiovascular disease require treatment with beta-blockers. However, beta-blockers are a \"two-edged sword\" when administered in obstructive pulmonary disorder. The use of beta-blockers should be assessed by their action on three areas: their effect on FEV1, their effect on bronchial hyperreactivity, the result obtained when additionally administering beta-agonists. The result of beta-blocker administration is influenced by the involvement of several other factors: the cardioselectivity of the beta-blocker, the dosage, the concomitant administration of beta-agonists, the stage of the disease (stable or exacerbation of COPD), smoker status etc. Their administration under strict monitoring results in a decreased morbidity and mortality, including in patients who had undergone cardiovascular surgery. The overall conclusion is that beta-blockers may be administered in COPD associated with cardiac comorbidity, but this administration requires utmost care.", 
    "17": "External (but not internal) application of beta-estradiol (E2) increased the current amplitude of voltage-gated Na(+) channels (VGSCs) in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer (BCa) cells. The G-protein activator GTP-gamma-S, by itself, also increased the VGSC current whilst the G-protein inhibitor GDP-beta-S decreased the effect of E2. Expression of GPR30 (a G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor) in MDA-MB-231 cells was confirmed by PCR, Western blot and immunocytochemistry. Importantly, G-1, a specific agonist for GPR30, also increased the VGSC current amplitude in a dose-dependent manner. Transfection and siRNA-silencing of GPR30 expression resulted in corresponding changes in GPR30 protein expression but only internally, and the response to E2 was not affected. The protein kinase A inhibitor, PKI, abolished the effect of E2, whilst forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, by itself, increased VGSC activity. On the other hand, pre-incubation of the MDA-MB-231 cells with brefeldin A (a trans-Golgi protein trafficking inhibitor) had no effect on the E2-induced increase in VGSC amplitude, indicating that such trafficking ('externalisation') of VGSC was not involved. Finally, acute application of E2 decreased cell adhesion whilst the specific VGSC blocker tetrodotoxin increased it. Co-application of E2 and tetrodotoxin inhibited the effect of E2 on cell adhesion, suggesting that the effect of E2 was mainly through VGSC activity. Pre-treatment of the cells with PKI abolished the effect of E2 on adhesion, consistent with the proposed role of PKA. Potential implications of the E2-induced non-genomic upregulation of VGSC activity for BCa progression are discussed.",

ATP serves as a pain mediator; however, NA-regulated ATP mobilizations in the DRG is far from understanding. In the present study, we analyzed ATP mobilizations in acutely dissociated rat DRG neurons by recording single-channel currents through P2X receptor channels as an ATP biosensor in an outside-out patch-clamp configuration and by monitoring real-time enzymatic NADPH fluorescent imaging, and examined the role for beta(3) adrenoceptors in allodynia using an in vivo rat model. We show here that NA stimulates ATP release from DRG neurons as mediated via beta(3) adrenoceptors linked to G(s) protein involving PKA activation, to cause allodynia. This represents a fresh regulatory pathway for neuropathic pain relevant to noradrenergic transmission in the DRG.",

During one occasion in May 2008, water samples were collected at different locations and depths in the recipient lake. All analytes except of acebutolol were present in both the river and the lake at quantifiable amounts at all sampling occasions. Carbamazepine was found in similar concentrations (about 90 ng L(-1)) at all sampling sites and all studied depths (0.5-40 m) in the lake, indicating high environmental persistence of this compound. A clear seasonal pattern was observed for the natural attenuation of the beta-blockers in the river, with the highest attenuation occurring in summer and the lowest in winter. The loss of beta-blockers on a distance of 1320 m reached up to 75% during summer time but was insignificant during winter. The seasonal variations in the loss followed the seasonal variations in water temperature and chlorophyll a mass flow suggesting that biotransformation and adsorption are the main processes responsible for the loss of the studied pharmaceuticals in River Fyris downstream the WWTP.",

Spironolactone only prevented the increase in beta-ENaC immunoreactivity in the choroid plexus and ependyma. In the supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, and subfornical organ, Na(+)-rich aCSF did not affect mRNA expression levels of the studied genes. Benzamil significantly increased CSF [Na(+)] in the control, but not Na(+)-rich, aCSF group. In contrast, benzamil prevented the increase in hypothalamic tissue [Na(+)] by Na(+)-rich aCSF. These results suggest that CSF Na(+) upregulates ENaC expression in the brain epithelia, but not in the neurons of hypothalamic nuclei. ENaC in the choroid plexus and ependyma appear to contribute to regulation of Na(+) homeostasis in the brain.",

    "69": "The key message of this paper is that atenolol should not be used as an antihypertensive drug and that the degree of reduction of mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke and congestive heart failure by antihypertensive therapy is dependent on the degree of lowering of aortic blood pressure. Newer vasodilator beta-blockers such as carvedilol and nebivolol may be more effective in reducing cardiovascular events than traditional beta-blockers, but this needs to be investigated by controlled clinical trials.", 
    "70": "Regardless of the mechanisms that initiate the rise of blood pressure, the development of structural changes in the systemic vasculature is the end result of established hypertension. Indices of small resistance artery structure, such as the ratio of tunica media to internal lumen, may have a strong prognostic significance in hypertensive patients, over and above all other known cardiovascular risk factors. Hence, the regression of vascular alterations seems to be an appealing goal for antihypertensive treatment. Different antihypertensive drugs may have different effects on vascular structure. Complete normalization of small resistance artery structure was demonstrated in hypertensive patients after long-term and effective antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and calcium antagonists. Little or no improvement was observed with beta-blockers or diuretics. Evidence from several studies suggests that some antihypertensive drugs are more effective than others in reversing microvascular structural alterations in hypertension.", 
    "71": "Infection due to protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is highly prevalent among humans throughout the world. Acquired primary infection is seldom severe in immunocompetent people while it can be life-threatening in immunodeficient ones. We report a case of acquired toxoplasmosis in an immunocompetent healty 32-year-old man, presenting as acute pericarditis and myocarditis. The patient complained of intense chest pain, asthenia, arthralgia, low-grade fever, neck lymphadenopathy. Increased seric cardiac enzymes, electrocardiografic anomalies of repolarization and the presence of pericardic effusion on echocardiogram needed anti-inflammatory and anti-arrhythmic drugs and a close monitoring. The aetiological diagnosis, supported by serological tests positive for toxoplasmosis, recommended an antibiotic therapy as additional treatment (spiramycin 9MU/day for one month). Full symptoms remission and normalization of serological values suggested, however, that no more effective anti-protozoan treatment was needed. Thus, the infection by Toxoplasma gondii should be taken into account in the aetiology of either acute pericarditis or myocarditis, because a specific treatment is available, which can improve on the prognosis of the disease.", 
    "72": "Smoking and chronic stress are well-documented risk factors that are associated with \u03b2-adrenoceptors in the development of pancreatic cancer. Stimulation of \u03b2-adrenoceptors can activate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/ protein kinase A (PKA) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in pancreatic cancer cells. Many recent studies have focused on the function of \u03b2-adrenoceptors in cancer invasion. Thus, we hypothesized that \u03b2-adrenoceptors may play a role in pancreatic cancer invasion, and \u03b2-blockers may suppress the pancreatic cancer invasion and proliferation. MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cell lines express mRNA and protein of both \u03b21 and \u03b22-adrenoceptors. \u03b22-adrenergic antagonist ICI118,551 and \u03b21/2-adrenergic antagonist propranolol significantly suppressed cell invasion and proliferation in comparison to \u03b21-adrenergic antagonist metoprolol and control in a Matrigel invasion assay and subrenal capsular assay. Treatment with \u03b22-adrenoceptor antagonists inhibited activation of transcription factors nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), activator protein 1 (AP-1) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Western blotting. \u03b22-adrenoceptor antagonists also significantly altered vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 expression. The \u03b22-adrenergic antagonists suppressed invasion and proliferation by inhibiting both cAMP/PKA and Ras, which regulate activation of the MAPK pathway and transcription factors, such as NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and CREB, as well as expression of its target genes, MMP-9, MMP-2 and VEGF. However, \u03b21-adrenergic antagonists suppressed invasion by inhibiting only the cAMP/PKA pathway, suggesting that they may be useful as novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer.", 
    "73": "Glutamate transporters located in the brain maintain low synaptic concentrations of the neurotransmitter by coupling its flux to that of sodium and other cations. In the binding pocket of the archeal homologue Glt(Ph), a conserved methionine residue has been implicated in the binding of the benzyl moiety of the nontransportable substrate analogue threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate. To determine whether the corresponding methionine residue of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1, Met-367, fulfills a similar role, M367L, M367C, and M367S mutants were expressed in HeLa cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes to monitor radioactive transport and transport currents, respectively. The apparent affinity of the Met-367 mutants for D-aspartate and L-glutamate, but not for L-aspartate, was 10-20-fold reduced as compared with wild type. Unlike wild type, the magnitude of I(max) was different for each of the three substrates. D-glutamate, which is also a transportable substrate of EAAC1, did not elicit any detectable response with M367C and M367S but acted as a nontransportable substrate analogue in M367L. In the mutants, substrates inhibited the anion conductance as opposed to the stimulation observed with wild type. Remarkably, the apparent affinity of the blocker D,L-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate in the mutants was similar to that of wild type EAAC1. Our results are consistent with the idea that the side chain of Met-367 fulfills a steric role in the positioning of the substrate in the binding pocket in a step subsequent to its initial binding.", 
    "74": "Recent studies in animal and human models have revealed that free fatty acid (FFA) release from adipose tissue is oscillatory. We have shown in our laboratory that these oscillations are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Although FFAs have been shown to directly stimulate glucose production [endogenous glucose production (EGP)] by the liver and to reduce peripheral glucose utilization, whether the specific pattern of FFA release affects glucose metabolism is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of pulsatile vs. constant infusion of FFA on glucose homeostasis in the canine model. Euglycemic clamps with basal insulin replacement (0.1 mU.kg(-1).min(-1) insulin) were performed in dogs (n = 8) during infusion of saline (SAL) or the medium-chain fatty acid octanoate, which was given by either pulsatile infusion (PUL: 10 mmol over 2 min every 10 min) or continuous infusion (C-INF: 1 mmol/min) designed to achieve equivalent total FFA mass. Endogenous lipolytic pulses were suppressed with the beta(3)-specific adrenergic receptor antagonist bupranolol. PUL infusion elicited a pulsatile pattern of FFA in circulation with average maximum pulse height of 0.82 +/- 0.04 mM, whereas C-INF FFA levels reached 0.47 +/- 0.03 mM (fasting levels) and were maintained throughout. Glucose uptake was not affected by PUL; however, C-INF significantly reduced glucose uptake compared with both SAL and PUL. Steady-state EGP increased by >90% from basal steady state during PUL but did not change during either SAL or C-INF. Thus, pulsatile FFA infusion led to an increase in EGP while preserving glucose disposal. These data suggest that the pattern of FFA may have a role in regulation of glucose homeostasis, which may have consequences in the obese or insulin-resistant state where the SNS is known to be altered.", 
    "75": "ATPgammaS, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, was found to dose-dependently generate an inward current at a holding potential of -70 mV (EC(50)=43 microM) in lamina IX neurons of rat spinal cord slices using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. This inward current had an extrapolated reversal potential of -9 mV and was resistant to the Na(+)-channel blocker tetrodotoxin, glutamate-receptor antagonists or nominally Ca(2+)-free medium. ATP gamma S also increased the frequency and amplitude of glutamatergic spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC); this action was dose-dependent and sensitive to tetrodotoxin. Unlike ATP gamma S, the P2X-receptor agonist, BzATP or alpha,beta-methylene ATP, did not change holding currents, but the current response produced by ATP gamma S disappeared in the presence of the P2-receptor antagonist PPADS. The sEPSC frequency and amplitude increase was observed with alpha,beta-methylene ATP, but not with the P2Y-receptor agonist, 2-methylthio ADP, UTP or UDP. The current response by ATP gamma S was suppressed by the addition of GDP beta S into the patch-pipette solution. As for ATP gamma S, 2-methylthio ADP produced an inward current, while UTP and UDP had no effect on holding currents. The P2Y(1)-receptor antagonist MRS2179 inhibited the ATP gamma S-induced inward current, but did not affect the sEPSC frequency and amplitude increase produced by ATP gamma S. These data indicate that extracellular ATP increases the excitability of lamina IX neurons by membrane depolarization (probably through non-selective cation-channel activation) and spontaneous excitatory transmission enhancement, which may be mediated by P2Y(1) and P2X receptors, respectively. This finding supports the idea that purinergic receptor antagonists provide a therapy for spinal cord injury.", 
    "76": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the cardiovascular effect of three extracts from the root bark of Anthocleista schweinfurthii Gilg.: an aqueous extract (AE), a dichloromethane extract (DCMR) and a fraction enriched in cardiac glycoside type compounds (CARDAN). In isolated perfused frog heart, bolus injection of the extracts produced a positive inotropic effect. The responses to AE and DCMR, but not to CARDAN, were depressed by propranolol. In isolated rat aorta, DCMR produced a transient increase in contractile tension while AE and CARDAN induced a sustained constriction. AE vasoconstrictor effect was abolished by phentolamine, while contraction evoked by CARDAN was antagonized by verapamil. In aortic rings contracted in low K+ media, the addition of K+ evoked a relaxation, which was abolished by ouabain, depressed by DCMR but not affected by either A(E) or CARDAN. These observations indicate that Anthocleista schweinfurthii contains substances that promote vasoconstriction and increase cardiac contraction. The effect of DCMR was only partially mediated by inhibition of the Na+ pump while the mechanism of action of A(E) and CARDAN was distinct from the inhibition of the Na+, K+ - ATPase pump, but could involve adrenergic receptors, or either direct or indirect activation of L-type calcium channels.", 
    "77": "Effects ofverapamil, a slow calcium channel blocker, on the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-beta) by peritoneal mononuclears were studied using a rat model of aseptic intra-abdominal inflammation. Autohemoperitoneum was simulated by intraperitoneal administration of autoblood (group 1). The similarly treated animals of group 2 were additionally given verapamil. A statistically significant rise in the TNF-alpha and IL-beta levels was documented in the former case. In group 2, verapamil substantially modified functional activity of peritoneal macrophages in that TNF-alpha content in peritoneal exudate was twice lower than in group 1 while the IL-beta level remained unaltered. These findings suggest that slow calcium channels are involved in regulation of cytokine-producing function of mononuclear cells during intra-abdominal inflammation.", 
    "78": "Initial research supports the use of propranolol to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); research has not examined pharmacological prevention for children. Twenty-nine injury patients (ages 10-18 years old) at risk for PTSD were randomized to a double-blind 10-day trial of propranolol or placebo initiated within 12 hours postadmission. Six-week PTSD symptoms and heart rate were assessed. Although intent-to-treat analyses revealed no group differences, findings supported a significant interaction between gender and treatment in medication-adherent participants, Delta R(2) = .21. Whereas girls receiving propranolol reported more PTSD symptoms relative to girls receiving placebo, Delta R(2) = .44, boys receiving propranolol showed a nonsignificant trend toward fewer PTSD symptoms than boys receiving placebo, Delta R(2) = .32. Findings inform gender differences regarding pharmacological PTSD prevention in youth.", 
    "79": "Ivabradine (IVA) is a novel, specific, heart rate (HR)-lowering agent that acts in sinoatrial node (SAN) cells by selectively inhibiting the pacemaker If current in a dose-dependent manner by slowing the diastolic depolarization slope of SAN cells, and reducing HR at rest and during exercise with minimal effect on myocardial contractility, blood pressure, and intracardiac conduction. Many published studies have demonstrated that HR reduction with IVA is beneficial in patients with chronic stable angina. IVA has been shown to be noninferior to beta-blocker and calcium antagonist drugs in HR reduction. The specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of IVA make it an important agent in the management of patients with coronary artery disease, particularly in those patients with an elevated HR. The aim of this short review is to describe the regulation of HR and If current with IVA, and some beneficial effects of this medication in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "80": "Betaxolol is a selective beta(1) receptor blocker used in the treatment of hypertension and glaucoma. A study of the betaxolol structure based on infrared spectroscopy and natural bond orbital (NBO) theory is the main aim of the present research. FTIR spectra of the solid betaxolol were recorded in the region from 4000 to 400cm(-1), in the temperature range between 25 and -170 degrees C. For spectral interpretation, spectrum of the deuterated betaxolol and the theoretical vibrational spectra of the conformer present in the solid obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory, were used. Further insight into the structure was provided by natural bond orbital theory. NBO analysis of the conformer, before and after optimization, was carried out at the same level of theory referred above. Vibrational modes involved in hydrogen bond in the stretching and bending region were used in the estimation of the enthalpy using empirical correlations between enthalpy and the frequency shift that occurs as a result of the establishment of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. A detailed study of the structure of betaxolol and of its intermolecular interactions was obtained from the combination spectroscopy and NBO theory.",

    "85": "To determine the role of the phospholipase D (PLD) pathway in injury and survival of alveolar epithelial cells, A549 cells were exposed to H(2)O(2) (500 microM) which resulted in time-dependent injury and bi-phasic increase of PLD activity at 5 min and at 3 h, respectively. n-Butanol (0.5%) inhibited PLD activation, attenuated cell injury at 5 min of H(2)O(2) exposure, but enhanced injury at 3h of exposure. This activation was inhibited by treatment with catalase (500 units/ml). Exogenous phosphatidic acid mimicked the effects of PLD activation, and diphenyliodonium (NADPH oxidase inhibitor) reversed the decline in cell viability induced by H(2)O(2) exposure. Propranolol (phosphatidic acid phospholydrolase inhibitor) and quinacrine (phospholipase A2 inhibitor) had weak effects on H(2)O(2)-induced PLD activation but reversed H(2)O(2)-induced injury. We speculate that PLD activation at the initiation of H(2)O(2) exposure predominantly results in NAPDH oxidase activation, which mediates A549 cell injury, but turns to mediating cell survival as the H(2)O(2) attack continues, which might be mainly due to the accumulation of intracellular phosphatidic acid.", 
    "86": "An increase in cytosolic calcium concentration triggers intracellular signal transduction in vascular cells, which then regulates the vascular contraction. In the present study, the regulatory mechanism of carteolol on the intracellular free Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) mobilization was investigated in cultured A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells. The A7r5 cells were cultured and loaded with fura-2-AM, which was used as a Ca(2+) sensitive fluorescent probe. In both the presence and absence of external Ca(2+), carteolol increased [Ca(2+)](i) with a dose-dependent manner in A7r5 cells at concentrations between 608 microM and 6.08 microM. In a Ca(2+)-containing buffer, carteolol-induced [Ca(2+)](i) showed an initial peak followed by a secondary and persistent plateau. Pretreatment of the cells with La(3+), the plasma membrane Ca(2+) pump inhibitor, and nifedipine, a L-type Ca(2+) channel inhibitor, both partially restrained the carteolol-induced initial peak in [Ca(2+)](i) by 92% and 86%, respectively. Pretreatment of the cells with adrenoceptor antagonists, prazosin inhibited the [Ca(2+)](i) response by 80%, and propranolol enhanced the response by 61%. In the Ca(2+-)-free buffer, pretreatment of the cells with carteolol inhibited the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor of thapsigargin-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase by 97%. Pretreatment of the cells with thapsigargin also inhibited the carteolol-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rise by 98%. The internal Ca(2+) release induced by the carteolol was partially inhibited by U73122 (phospholipase C inhibitor) and aristolochic acid, quinacrine (phospholipase A(2) inhibitors). After incubation of carteolol in the Ca(2+)-free buffer, the addition of CaCl(2) increased the Ca(2+) influx, implying that the release of Ca(2+) from internal stores further induced capacitative Ca(2+) entry. These results suggest that carteolol-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase is mediated by the initial influx via the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor, L-type Ca(2+) channel, nonselective calcium entry channels and release of Ca(2+) from an intracellular store, which is mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum followed by capacitative Ca(2+) entry but decrease via the beta(2)-adrenoceptor. The intracellular Ca(2+) release was also modulated by phospholipase A(2), C-coupled events.", 
    "87": "Divalent dipeptides have been introduced as counter ions in aqueous CZE. The dipeptides form ion pairs with amino alcohols in the BGE and facilitate the separation of amino alcohols. High concentrations of dipeptide caused reversed effective mobility for the analytes. The net charge of the dipeptide can be controlled using a buffer or a strong base, and regulates the interaction between the dipeptide and the amino alcohol. A stronger interaction and higher selectivity of amino alcohols was observed when the dipeptides were used as divalent counter ions, than in monovalent or uncharged form. Association constants for ion pairs between divalent dipeptides and amino alcohols can be used to enhance selectivity for amino alcohols in CZE. No chiral separation of amino alcohols was observed when using the dipeptides as ion-pairing chiral selectors in aqueous BGE, but addition of methanol to the BGE promoted enantioselectivity.", 
    "88": "Adrenergic stimulation of isolated guinea pig distal colonic mucosa produced transient Cl(-) and sustained K(+) secretion. Transient short-circuit current (I(sc)) depended on beta(2)-adrenergic receptors (beta(2)-AdrR), and sustained I(sc) relies on a beta(1)-AdrR/beta(2)-AdrR complex. Epinephrine (epi) increased cAMP content with a biphasic time course similar to changes in epi-activated I(sc) ((epi)I(sc)). Inhibition of transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs) reduced peak (epi)I(sc) and cAMP to near zero without decreasing sustained (epi)I(sc), consistent with cAMP from tmAC signaling for only Cl(-) secretion. Inhibition of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) reduced sustained (epi)I(sc) and cAMP to near zero without decreasing peak (epi)I(sc) or cAMP, consistent with cAMP from sAC signaling for K(+) secretion. Sensitivity to phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors and peptide YY (PYY) stimulation further supported separate signaling for the two components. PDE3 or PDE4 inhibitors enhanced peak (epi)I(sc) but not sustained (epi)I(sc), consistent with these PDEs as part of the beta(2)-AdrR signaling domain. PYY suppressed peak (epi)I(sc) in a pertussis toxin (PTx)-sensitive manner, supporting Galpha(i)-dependent inhibition of tmACs producing cAMP for Cl(-) secretion. Since PYY or PTx did not alter sustained (epi)I(sc), signaling for K(+) secretion occurred via a Galpha(i)-independent mechanism. Presence of multiple sAC variants in colonic epithelial cells was supported by domain-specific antibodies. Responses to specific activators and inhibitors suggested that protein kinase A was not involved in activating peak or sustained components of (epi)I(sc), but the cAMP-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Epac, may contribute. Thus beta-adrenergic activation of electrogenic Cl(-) and K(+) secretion, respectively, required tmAC- and sAC-dependent signaling pathways.", 
    "89": "In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the exercise-induced increase in stroke volume (SV) is limited by the increase in pulmonary artery pressure. In left heart failure (LHF), systemic arterial pressure increases little during exercise, and the SV increase is limited by the left ventricle itself. These differences might be reflected by a dissimilar SV and heart rate (HR) response to exercise, which could have important therapeutic implications, for example in beta-blocker therapy. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that SV and HR responses during exercise are different between PAH and LHF patients.", 
    "90": "We included 28 PAH and 18 LHF patients (recruited from the heart failure unit) matched on a maximal oxygen uptake of <15 mL/kg/min, who were referred to our Pulmonary Function Department between 2000 and 2008 for a maximal cardio-pulmonary exercise test. Only patients who had not been exposed to beta-blockers were included. Pulmonary arterial hypertension and LHF patient groups had equally impaired exercise tolerance (about 42% of predicted) with a maximal oxygen uptake of 0.80 +/- 0.29 and 0.86 +/- 0.19 L/min. The peak SV response to exercise was significantly lower in PAH patients (-14 mL, P = 0.01); this was compensated by a steeper slope of HR relating to oxygen uptake (0.03 beats/mL, P = 0.001).",

The authors reviewed 563 patients with HF and an ejection fraction <or=35% for adherence to the 2005 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF guidelines for the use of ICDs, CRT, and medications. There were 324 HFC and 239 GC patients. CRT guidelines were appropriately followed in 86% of HFC and 81% of GC patients ( P=NS). For primary arrhythmia prevention, an ICD was implanted in 107 (42%) HFC and 50 (25%) GC patients ( P<.004). Guidelines were appropriately followed in 77% of HFC and 74% of GC patients ( P=NS). For medications, dose intensity of diuretics, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was significantly greater in HFC than GC patients.

    "105": "Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a potent blocker of angiogenesis in vivo, and of endothelial cell migration and tubule formation, binds with high affinity to an as yet unknown protein on the surfaces of endothelial cells. Given that protein fingerprinting suggested a match of a approximately 60 kDa PEDF-binding protein in bovine retina with Bos taurus F(1)-ATP synthase beta-subunit, and that F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase components have been identified recently as cell-surface receptors, we examined the direct binding of PEDF to F(1). Size-exclusion ultrafiltration assays showed that recombinant human PEDF formed a complex with recombinant yeast F(1). Real-time binding as determined by surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that yeast F(1) interacted specifically and reversibly with human PEDF. Kinetic evaluations revealed high binding affinity for PEDF, in agreement with PEDF affinities for endothelial cell surfaces. PEDF blocked interactions between F(1) and angiostatin, another antiangiogenic factor, suggesting overlapping PEDF-binding and angiostatin-binding sites on F(1). Surfaces of endothelial cells exhibited affinity for PEDF-binding proteins of approximately 60 kDa. Antibodies to F(1)beta-subunit specifically captured PEDF-binding components in endothelial plasma membranes. The extracellular ATP synthesis activity of endothelial cells was examined in the presence of PEDF. PEDF significantly reduced the amount of extracellular ATP produced by endothelial cells, in agreement with direct interactions between cell-surface ATP synthase and PEDF. In addition to demonstrating that PEDF binds to cell-surface F(1), these results show that PEDF is a ligand for endothelial cell-surface F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase. They suggest that PEDF-mediated inhibition of ATP synthase may form part of the biochemical mechanisms by which PEDF exerts its antiangiogenic activity.",

There was no difference between women and men in systolic blood pressure (SBP) before or after treatment. Women however had a lower diastolic blood pressure (DBP) before and after intervention and as a result a higher pulse pressure (PP).

    "112": "Norepinephrine (NE) is known to play an integral role in the neurobiological response to stress. Exposure to stressful stimuli increases NE levels in brain regions that regulate stress and anxiety, like the basolateral amygdala (BLA). NE is thought to increase excitability in these areas through alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors (ARs), leading to increased anxiety. Surprisingly, recent studies have shown that systemic beta 3-AR agonist administration decreases anxiety-like behaviors, suggesting that beta 3-ARs may inhibit excitability in anxiety-related brain regions. Therefore, in this study we integrated electrophysiological and behavioral approaches to test the hypothesis that the anxiolytic effects of beta 3-AR agonists may be mediated by an increase in BLA GABAergic inhibition. We examined the effect of a selective beta 3-AR agonist, BRL37344 (BRL), on GABAergic synapses arising from local circuit interneurons and inhibitory synapses originating from a recently described population of cells called lateral paracapsular (LPCS) interneurons. Surprisingly, BRL selectively enhanced LPCS-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) with no effect on local GABAergic inhibition. BRL also had no effect on glutamatergic synaptic excitation within the BLA. BRL potentiation of LPCS eIPSCs was blocked by the selective beta 3-AR antagonist, SR59230A, or by intracellular dialysis of Rp-CAMPS (cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor), and this enhancement was not associated with any changes in spontaneous IPSCs or LPCS paired-pulse ratio. BRL also increased the amplitude of unitary LPCS IPSCs (uIPSCs) with no effect on uIPSC failure rate. Finally, bilateral BLA microinjection of BRL reduced anxiety-like behaviors in an open-field assay and the elevated plus-maze. Collectively, these data suggest that beta 3-AR activation selectively enhances LPCS, but not local, BLA GABAergic synapses, and that increases in LPCS-mediated inhibition may contribute to the anxiolytic profile of beta 3-AR agonists.", 
    "113": "It was reported that coadministration of amiodarone with carvedilol increased the serum concentration to dose (C/D) ratio of S-carvedilol in patients with heart failure, but not of R-carvedilol. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of amiodarone and its metabolite on the metabolism of R- and S-carvedilol in human liver microsomes (HLM). Oxidation of carvedilol in HLM was evaluated in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), whereas glucuronidation was evaluated in the presence of uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronic acid. The oxidation and glucuronidation activities of HLM for S-carvedilol were approximately 2- and 4-fold greater, respectively, than those for R-carvedilol. In the presence of amiodarone (50 microM) and/or desethylamiodarone (25 microM), the oxidation activity for R- and S-carvedilol decreased significantly. In contrast, the glucuronidation activity for R-carvedilol was increased 1.6- and 1.4-fold by amiodarone and desethylamiodarone, respectively, whereas the glucuronidation of S-carvedilol was only slightly changed by amiodarone and desethylamiodarone. These results suggested that inhibition of S-carvedilol oxidation by amiodarone and/or desethylamiodarone is implicated in the increased C/D ratio of S-carvedilol associated with coadministration of amiodarone. On the other hand, the stimulative effect of amiodarone and/or desethylamiodarone on the glucuronidation of R-carvedilol may compensate for the inhibitory effect of those on R-carvedilol oxidation.",

    "118": "The treatment of moderate or severe hypertension in most cases requires the contemporaneous use of multiple antihypertensive agents. The most available two-drug combinations have an agent that addresses renin secretion and another one that is statistically more effective in renin-independent hypertension. The practice of combining agents that counteract different mechanisms is the most likely explanation for the fact that most available two-drug combinations have an agent that addresses renin secretion (beta-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker or direct renin inhibitor) and another one that is more effective in renin-independent hypertension (diuretic, dihydropyridine or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker). Based on these considerations, addition of hydrochlorothiazide to the combination of an antagonist of the renin-angiotensin system with a calcium channel blocker would constitute a logical approach. Inclusion of a diuretic in the triple combination is based on the evidence that these agents are effective and cheap, enhance the effect of other antihypertensive agents, and add a specific effect to individuals with salt-sensitivity of blood pressure. The benefit of triple combination therapy with amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide over its dual component therapies has been demonstrated, and the use of a single pill will simplify therapy resulting in better blood pressure control.",

We investigated the function of porcine beta(2)-adrenoceptors in 3 cardiac regions, sinoatrial node, left atrium and right ventricle of newborn piglets. Both (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline caused sinoatrial tachycardia: 60+/-10% and 62+/-7% of the maximum response (E(max)) to (-)-noradrenaline (-logEC(50)=9.0) and (-)-adrenaline (-logEC(50)=7.5) respectively, were resistant to antagonism by the beta(1)-selective CGP20712A (2-hydroxy-5-[2-[[2-hydroxy-3-[4-[1-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]phenoxy]propyl]amino]ethoxy]-benzamide) (300 nM) but antagonized by beta(2)-selective ICI118551 (erythro(+/-)-[1-(2,3-dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol) (50 nM), consistent with mediation through beta(2)-adrenoceptors. The phosphodiesterase3-selective inhibitor cilostamide and phosphodiesterase4-selective inhibitor rolipram did not affect catecholamine chronotropic potencies. Only small CGP20712A-resistant positive inotropic effects of (-)-adrenaline were detected in the left atria (13+/-2% of E(max)) and ventricular trabeculae (14+/-5% of E(max)). The atrial inotropic responses to (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline faded; fades were prevented by rolipram but not cilostamide or concurrent cilostamide+rolipram respectively. (-)-Noradrenaline (ICI118551 present) increased left atrial cAMP levels through beta(1)-adrenoceptors that were markedly enhanced by rolipram but unaffected by cilostamide. Concurrent cilostamide+rolipram uncovered inotropic and cAMP responses to (-)-adrenaline (CGP20712A present). We conclude that sinoatrial beta(2)-adrenoceptors are more important than beta(1)-adrenoceptors in the mediation of tachycardia caused by both (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline in the newborn piglet. beta(2)-adrenoceptors have only a minor role in the mediation of left atrial and ventricular inotropic effects of (-)-adrenaline. Catecholamine-evoked tachycardia is not controlled by PDE3 or PDE4. PDE4, but not PDE3, controls the atrial inotropic and cAMP beta(1)-adrenoceptor-mediated responses to (-)-noradrenaline. Both PDE3 and PDE4 blunt left atrial inotropic and cAMP responses to (-)-adrenaline through beta(2)-adrenoceptors.",

Next, the effects of PRO at 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg on bone status were examined in more detail. Compared with the SHR control, not only bone mass but also biomechanical parameters of strength and toughness of the lumbar vertebrae were increased in SHR treated with PRO at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg, suggesting antiosteoporotic action. PRO at 1 mg/kg statistically increased histomorphometry indices of bone formation, whereas PRO at doses of 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg decreased those of bone resorption. Antiosteoporotic effect of PRO is attenuated at 10 mg/kg compared with 0.1 and 1 mg/kg. In addition, treatment with timolol, a nonselective beta-AR antagonist without membrane-stabilizing action, or butoxamine, a selective beta2-AR antagonist, at 1 mg/kg increased bone mass in SHR. These results suggested that treatment of SHR with beta-blockers at low dose improved bone loss and bone fragility.

However, the cellular effects of individual enantiomer are not well understood. To gain insights into how each enantiomer affects cells, we analysed differential protein expression levels in vascular smooth muscle cells (A7r5) incubated separately with S- and R-Carvedilol by iTRAQ-coupled 2-D LC-MS/MS approach. Thirteen proteins were identified with statistically significant changes in cells incubated with S-Carvedilol, while the changes of most proteins incubated with R-Carvedilol were less significant.

Antibiotics have possessed specific role in COPD over years. Non-invasive ventilation is considered during acute severe exacerbations. Rehabilitation/training should be more widely used both at the specialist level and primary care.", 
    "140": "The application of chemical-modified gold nanoparticles (GNPs) as chiral selector for the enantioseparation based on pseudostationary phase-CEC (PSP-CEC) is presented. GNPs modified by thiolated beta-CD were characterized by NMR and FT-IR. The nanoparticle size was determined to be of 9.5 nm (+2.5 nm) by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and UV spectra. Four pairs of dinitrophenyl-labeled amino acid enantiomers (DL-Val, Leu, Glu and Asp) and three pairs of drug enantiomers (RS-chlorpheniramine, zopiclone and carvedilol) were analyzed by using modified GNPs as the chiral selector in PSP-CEC. Good theoretical plate number (up to 2.4x10(5) per meter) and separation resolution (up to 4.7) were obtained even with low concentration of modified GNPs (0.8-1.4 mg/mL). The corresponding concentration of beta-CD in the buffer was only 0.30-0.53 mM, which was much lower than the optimum concentration of 15 mM if pure beta-CD was used as chiral selector. Our results showed that thiolated beta-CD modified GNPs have more sufficient interaction with the analytes, resulting in significant enhancement of enantioseparation. The study shed light on potential usage of chemical modified GNPs as chiral selector for enantioseparation based on PSP-CEC.",

    "145": "There is evidence that the major mediators of stress, i.e., catecholamines and glucocorticoids, play an important role in modulating thymopoiesis and consequently immune responses. Furthermore, there are data suggesting that glucocorticoids influence catecholamine action. Therefore, to assess the putative relevance of glucocorticoid-catecholamine interplay in the modulation of thymopoiesis we analyzed thymocyte differentiation/maturation in non-adrenalectomized and andrenalectomized rats subjected to treatment with propranolol (0.4 mg.100 g body weight-1.day-1) for 4 days. The effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on thymopoiesis in non-adrenalectomized rats differed not only quantitatively but also qualitatively from those in adrenalectomized rats. In adrenalectomized rats, besides a more efficient thymopoiesis [judged by a more pronounced increase in the relative proportion of the most mature single-positive TCRalphabetahigh thymocytes as revealed by two-way ANOVA; for CD4+CD8- F (1,20) = 10.92, P < 0.01; for CD4-CD8+ F (1,20) = 7.47, P < 0.05], a skewed thymocyte maturation towards the CD4-CD8+ phenotype, and consequently a diminished CD4+CD8-/CD4-CD8+ mature TCRalphabetahigh thymocyte ratio (3.41 +/- 0.21 in non-adrenalectomized rats vs 2.90 +/- 0.31 in adrenalectomized rats, P < 0.05) were found. Therefore, we assumed that catecholaminergic modulation of thymopoiesis exhibits a substantial degree of glucocorticoid-dependent plasticity. Given that glucocorticoids, apart from catecholamine synthesis, influence adrenoceptor expression, we also hypothesized that the lack of adrenal glucocorticoids affected not only beta-adrenoceptor- but also alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated modulation of thymopoiesis.", 
    "146": "Studies have demonstrated an influence of dosage release formulations on drug interactions and enantiomeric plasma concentrations. Metoprolol is a commonly used beta-adrenergic antagonist metabolized by CYP2D6. The CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine has previously been shown to interact with metoprolol tartrate. This open-label, randomized, 4-phase crossover study assessed the potential differential effects of paroxetine on stereoselective pharmacokinetics of immediate-release (IR) tartrate and extended-release (ER) succinate metoprolol formulations. Ten healthy participants received metoprolol IR (50 mg) and ER (100 mg) with and without paroxetine coadministration. Blood samples were collected over 24 hours for determination of metoprolol plasma enantiomer concentrations. Paroxetine coadministration significantly increased S and R metoprolol area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the 24-hour blood draw (AUC(0-24h)) by 4- and 5-fold, respectively for IR, and 3- and 4-fold, respectively, for ER. S/R AUC ratios significantly decreased. These results demonstrate a pharmacokinetic interaction between paroxetine and both formulations of metoprolol. The interaction is greater with R metoprolol, and stereoselective metabolism is lost. This could theoretically result in greater beta-blockade and lost cardioselectivity. The magnitude of the interaction was similar between metoprolol formulations, which may be attributable to low doses/drug input rates employed.", 
    "147": "The beneficial effects of beta blocking drugs in hypertension and heart failure are well known. However, this class of drugs is pharmacologically heterogeneous. In contrast to the non vasodilator betablockers like propranolol, atenolol or metoprolol which, in hypertension do not decrease intima media thinckness both in arterioles and large arteries, do not decrease arterial rigidity and can induce diabetes mellitus, the betablockers with vasodilating properties are beneficial on these parameters. Moreover, in heart failure, they more markedly decrease left ventricular workload than betablockers without any vascular relaxing effect and the results of SENIOR with nebivolol could suggest the beneficial role of NO on left ventricular dysfunction. Finally, the third generation betablockers, represented by celiprolol, carvedilol and nebivolol, have antioxidant properties which are probably implicated in their endothelial protective effects and in their absence of deleterious metabolic effects, effects which are probably of interest in term of protection of target organs during chronic treatment of hypertensive patients.", 
    "148": "Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a regulator of energy homeostasis, has a central role in mediating the appetite-modulating and metabolic effects of many hormones and antidiabetic drugs metformin and glitazones. The objective of this study was to determine if AMPK can be activated in osteoblasts by known AMPK modulators and if AMPK activity is involved in osteoblast function in vitro and regulation of bone mass in vivo. ROS 17/2.8 rat osteoblast-like cells were cultured in the presence of AMPK activators (AICAR and metformin), AMPK inhibitor (compound C), the gastric peptide hormone ghrelin and the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. AMPK activity was measured in cell lysates by a functional kinase assay and AMPK protein phosphorylation was studied by Western Blotting using an antibody recognizing AMPK Thr-172 residue. We demonstrated that treatment of ROS 17/2.8 cells with AICAR and metformin stimulates Thr-172 phosphorylation of AMPK and dose-dependently increases its activity. In contrast, treatment of ROS 17/2.8 cells with compound C inhibited AMPK phosphorylation. Ghrelin and propranolol dose-dependently increased AMPK phosphorylation and activity. Cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity were not affected by metformin treatment while AICAR significantly inhibited ROS 17/2.8 cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity at high concentrations. To study the effect of AMPK activation on bone formation in vitro, primary osteoblasts obtained from rat calvaria were cultured for 14-17days in the presence of AICAR, metformin and compound C. Formation of 'trabecular-shaped' bone nodules was evaluated following alizarin red staining. We demonstrated that both AICAR and metformin dose-dependently increase trabecular bone nodule formation, while compound C inhibits bone formation. When primary osteoblasts were co-treated with AICAR and compound C, compound C suppressed the stimulatory effect of AICAR on bone nodule formation. AMPK is a alphabetagamma heterotrimer, where alpha is the catalytic subunit. RT-PCR analysis of AMPK subunits in ROS17/2.8 osteoblastic cells and in mouse tibia showed that the AMPKalpha1 subunit is the dominant isoform expressed in bone. We analysed the bone phenotype of 4month-old male wild type (WT) and AMPKalpha1-/- KO mice using micro-CT. Both cortical and trabecular bone compartments were smaller in the AMPK alpha1-deficient mice compared to the WT mice. Altogether, our data support a role for AMPK signalling in skeletal physiology.", 
    "149": "The aim of this study was to assess age differences in the utilization of class-I treatment guidelines and its effect on mortality in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The study included 1026 consecutive patients from the prospective nationwide Acute Coronary Syndrome Israeli Survey (ACSIS). Primary reperfusion was used less often among elderly (age>75 years) patients than among those aged 65-74 and <65 years (46%, 63%, 64%, respectively, p (for trend)=0.004). Class-I evidence-based medications (EBM) at discharge (aspirin, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors=ACEI, angiotensin receptor-blockers=ARBs and statins) were less frequently prescribed to elderly compared to younger age-subgroup (44%, 61%, 57%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.62; 0.40-0.97 for age \u2265 75 vs. age<65 years). Early and 1-year mortality rates were 3-5-fold higher among the elderly compared to patients <65 years. In the entire cohort use of primary reperfusion was associated with lower 1-year mortality (OR=0.69; 0.47-1.01), as was the use of EBM (OR=0.26; 0.17-0.41). These effects were similar across all age-subgroups but with a greater impact among the elderly, as the number of patients needed to treat (NNT) was significantly lower with advancing age. Better adherence to treatment guidelines may improve the prognosis of elderly patients with STEMI.",

The thermodynamic parameters of enthalpy, entropy, the Gibbs energy and the binding constant were determined using the one site model. Furthermore, the binding constants corrected for the electrostatic contribution were used to assess the partition coefficients for the drugs. Also, the effect of the concentration, ionic strength, temperature and membrane curvature on the interaction was included in the evaluation.", 
    "151": "Chitosan-magnesium aluminum silicate (CS-MAS) films were prepared and the effects of MAS content and heat treatment of the CS-MAS dispersion before film casting on the physicochemical and drug permeability properties of the films were investigated. CS could interact with MAS via electrostatic interaction and intermolecular hydrogen bonding mechanisms, resulting in nanocomposite formation, for which it was not necessary to apply the heat treatment on the composite dispersions. The nature of the exfoliated and intercalated nanocomposite films formed was depended on the MAS content added. The heat treatment on the composite dispersions caused an increase in tensile strength, but reduced %elongation of the CS-MAS nanocomposite films. The exfoliated nanocomposite films showed higher flexibility, water uptake, and drug permeability compared to the CS and intercalated CS-MAS nanocomposite films. At higher MAS content, the CS-MAS films prepared using heat treatment had a lower water uptake, resulting in lower drug permeability when compared with those prepared using non-heated dispersions. The permeation mechanism of non-electrolyte and negatively charged drugs across the CS-MAS nanocomposite films was predominantly controlled by diffusion in water-filled microchannels, whereas both adsorption onto MAS and diffusion processes occurred concurrently for the film permeation of positively charged drugs. The findings of this study suggest that CS-MAS nanocomposite films can be formed without heating of the composite dispersion before casting. CS-MAS nanocomposites showed strong potential to be used as a film former for coated tablets intended for modulating drug release.", 
    "152": "Exercise could play a beneficial role in stress, but its underlying mechanism especially about heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in brain has not been fully clarified. Moreover, few studies have investigated swimming exercise and its effects on the combined stress of both chronic and acute stress. In this study we tried to investigate the role of swimming exercise in combined stress and whether its biological mechanism was related to the HSP70 and iNOS in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. 32 Wistar rats were enrolled and divided into four groups: control, CUMS, labetalol and exercise. After the animal model of chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) was built in the latter three groups, all the rats were given the novel acute stress of inescapable footshock. The behavioral changes were measured by open field test. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) was adopted to test the change of serum corticosterone (CORT). The expression of HSP70 and iNOS in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was analyzed by Western blot. The results demonstrated that swimming exercise could not only improve the behavior changes and protect the function of HPA axis stable in CUMS animals exposed to novel acute stress, but also increase the HSP70 expression and decrease the iNOS expression in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, swimming exercise could play a beneficial role in combined stress by up-regulating HSP70 level and down-regulating iNOS level in brain.", 
    "153": "Beta-blockers (BBs) are mandatory therapy for patients with systolic chronic heart failure (CHF). However, it is uncertain whether target dose of these agents is more important than the achievement of target heart rate (HR) in maximizing the benefits of these agents. To test this, we obtained ECG absolute HR from patients with systolic CHF, together with consecutive left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) measures at least 3 months apart. Patients were divided into those who achieved target dose for beta-blocker and/or target absolute HR of < or = 60 beats per minute (bpm) and target change in HR (>10 bpm reduction) with increasing dose. Baseline ejection fraction (EF) was similar across all groups. Patients with absolute or change in HR at target achieved a greater change in EF than those not at target (P= 0.027 and P= 0.012, respectively). In contrast, those who achieved target dose did not achieve a significantly greater improvement in EF than those not at target dose (P= 0.81). Similarly for absolute EF, patients at target HR or target change in HR achieved a greater EF increase than those achieving target dose. Based on these data, target HR or change in HR appears to be more critical to improvement in EF than target dose in CHF patients. Therefore, achieving an absolute HR or change in HR with BBs may be more important than target dose in maximizing benefits of BBs in this setting.",

To compare the exercise training's sympathetic blockade in healthy subjects (athletes) and the carvedilol's sympathetic blockade in sedentary heart failure patients by the evaluation of the heart rate dynamic during an exercise test. A total of 26 optimized and 49 nonoptimized heart failure patients in a stable condition (for, at least, 3 months), 15 healthy athletes and 17 sedentary healthy subjects were recruited to perform a cardiopulmonary exercise test. The heart rate dynamic (rest, reserve, peak and the peak heart rate in relation to the maximum predicted for age) was analyzed and compared between the four groups. The heart rate reserve was the same between optimized (48 +/- 15) and nonoptimized (49 +/- 18) heart failure patients (P < 0.0001). The athletes (188 +/- 9) showed a larger heart rate reserve compared to sedentary healthy subjects (92 +/- 10, P < 0.0001). Athletes and healthy sedentary reached the maximum age-predicted heart ratefor their age, but none of the heart failure patients did. The carvedilol's sympathetic blockade occurred during the rest and during the peak effort in the same proportion, but the exercise training's sympathetic blockade in healthy subjects occurred mainly in the rest.",

The disappearance of the compounds followed pseudo-first-order kinetics according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model and the rate constants were 0.075, 0.072 and 0.182 min(-1) for atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol, respectively. After 240 min irradiation, the reaction intermediates were completely mineralized to CO(2) and the nitrogen was predominantly as NH(4)(+). The influence of initial pH and beta-blocker concentration on the kinetics was also studied. From adsorption studies it appears that the photocatalytic degradation occurred mainly on the surface of TiO(2). Further studies indicated that surface reaction with OH radical was principally responsible for the degradation of these three beta-blockers. The major degradation intermediates were identified by HPLC/MS analysis. Cleavage of the side chain and the addition of the hydroxyl group to the parent compounds were found to be the two main degradation pathways for all three beta-blockers.",

A lower SES of immigrants, communication problems between doctor and patient and doctors' attitudes towards immigrants may explain ethnic differences in medical treatment after AMI.", 
    "169": "Mice lacking Kv1.1 Shaker-like potassium channels encoded by the Kcna1 gene exhibit severe seizures and die prematurely. The channel is widely expressed in brain but only minimally, if at all, in mouse myocardium. To test whether Kv1.1-potassium deficiency could underlie primary neurogenic cardiac dysfunction, we performed simultaneous video EEG-ECG recordings and found that Kcna1-null mice display potentially malignant interictal cardiac abnormalities, including a fivefold increase in atrioventricular (AV) conduction blocks, as well as bradycardia and premature ventricular contractions. During seizures the occurrence of AV conduction blocks increased, predisposing Kv1.1-deficient mice to sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which we recorded fortuitously in one animal. To determine whether the interictal AV conduction blocks were of cardiac or neural origin, we examined their response to selective pharmacological blockade of the autonomic nervous system. Simultaneous administration of atropine and propranolol to block parasympathetic and sympathetic branches, respectively, eliminated conduction blocks. When administered separately, only atropine ameliorated AV conduction blocks, indicating that excessive parasympathetic tone contributes to the neurocardiac defect. We found no changes in Kv1.1-deficient cardiac structure, but extensive Kv1.1 expression in juxtaparanodes of the wild-type vagus nerve, the primary source of parasympathetic input to the heart, suggesting a novel site of action leading to Kv1.1-associated cardiac bradyarrhythmias. Together, our data suggest that Kv1.1 deficiency leads to impaired neural control of cardiac rhythmicity due in part to aberrant parasympathetic neurotransmission, making Kcna1 a strong candidate gene for human SUDEP.",

HO was enhanced with heme arginate (HA) or blocked with chromium mesoporphyrin (CrMP). Histological, morphological/morphometrical, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, enzyme immunoassay, and spectrophotometric analysis were used. Our experimental design included the following groups of rats: A, controls [surgery-free Sprague-Dawley, UnX-sham, UnX-salt (0.9% NaCl + 0.2% KCl), and UnX-DOCA]; B, UnX-DOCA-salt hypertensive; C, UnX-DOCA-salt + HA; D, UnX-DOCA-salt + HA + CrMP; E, UnX-DOCA-salt + CrMP; F, UnX-DOCA-salt + captopril; G, UnX-DOCA-salt + L-arginine; H, UnX-DOCA-salt + spironolactone; and I, UnX-DOCA-salt + vehicle. HA lowered blood pressure and abated kidney hypertrophy and renal lesions, including glomerulosclerosis, tubular dilation, tubular cast formation, interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration, glomerular hypertrophy, and renal-arteriolar thickening in UnX-DOCA hypertension. Correspondingly, HO activity, adiponectin, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), ANP, cGMP, antioxidants such as bilirubin, ferritin, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, and total antioxidant capacity were increased, whereas ET-1, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), fibronectin, and 8-isoprostane were abated. These were accompanied by reduced proteinuria/albuminuria, but increased creatinine clearance. Interestingly, HA was more renoprotective than sipronolactone, L-arginine, and captopril, whereas the HO blocker CrMP exacerbated oxidative injury, aggravating renal lesions and function. Because 8-isoprostane stimulates ET-1 to potentiate oxidative stress and fibrosis, up-regulating HO-1 enhanced tissue antioxidant status alongside cellular targets such as adiponectin, AMPK, ANP, and cGMP to suppress ET-1, TGF-beta, and fibronectin with a corresponding decline of renal lesions, proteinuria/albuminuria, and thus improved renal function. The potent renoprotection of HA could be explored to combat renal hypertrophy and histopathological lesions characteristic of ESRD.",

    "177": "Although it has been repeatedly suggested that low bone mineral density (BMD) is disproportionately prevalent among patients with depressive disorders, so far depression has not been officially acknowledged as a risk factor for osteoporosis. In a recent meta-analysis comparing depressed with nondepressed individuals we report that BMD is lower in depressed than nondepressed subjects. The association between depression and BMD is stronger in women than men, and in premenopausal than postmenopausal women. Only women psychiatrically diagnosed for major depression display significantly low BMD; women diagnosed by self-rating questionnaires do not. Using a mouse model for depression, we demonstrate a causal relationship between depressive-like behavior and bone loss. The depression-induced bone loss is associated with increases in skeletal norepinephrine and serum corticosterone levels. Bone loss, but not the depressive behavior, could be prevented by a beta-blocker. Hence, depression appears as a significant risk factor for low BMD, causing bone loss through stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system."
