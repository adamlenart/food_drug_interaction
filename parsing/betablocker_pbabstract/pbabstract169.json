Treatment approximately halved progression risk (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.39-0.72); results were similar for patients with higher and lower baseline IOP (HRs, 0.41 and 0.55). Baseline progression factors (HRs, 1.51-2.12; P<0.01) were higher IOP, exfoliation, bilateral disease, and older age, as previously reported. New baseline predictors were lower ocular systolic perfusion pressure in all patients (< or =160 mmHg; HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04-1.94), cardiovascular disease history (HR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.44-5.26) in patients with higher baseline IOP, and lower systolic blood pressure (BP) (< or =125 mmHg; HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.21-1.02) in patients with lower baseline IOP. Postbaseline progression factors were IOP levels at follow-up, with 12% to 13% average increase per millimeter of mercury in all patients (HRs, 1.12-1.13 per mmHg higher) and similar results in patients with higher and lower baseline IOP (HRs, 1.15 and 1.13 per mmHg higher). Disc hemorrhages (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03 per percent higher frequency) also predicted progression. Thinner central corneal thickness (CCT) (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.55 per 40 microm lower) was a new significant factor, a result observed in patients with higher baseline IOP (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.05-1.92 per 40 microm lower) but not lower baseline IOP, with significant IOP-CCT interaction.",

Another new factor was thinner CCT, with results possibly indicating a preferential CCT effect with higher IOP.", 
    "7": "Recently, tissue segment binding method with a hydrophilic radioligand [(3)H]-CGP12177 was developed to detect plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors in rat heart (Horinouchi et al., 2006). In the present study, propranolol (40 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), atenolol (40 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) and bevantolol (200 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) were administered to rats for 6 weeks, and the changes of plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors and their mRNA expression in rat ventricle were examined. Chronic administration of propranolol increased the beta(1)-adrenoceptors but decreased the beta(2)-adrenoceptors without changing total amount of plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors. Atenolol increased both plasma membrane beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors, whereas bevantolol had no effect on the beta-adrenoceptor density and their subtype proportions. In contrast, the density of beta-adrenoceptors detected in conventional homogenate binding study was extremely low (approximately 60% of plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors detected with the tissue segment binding method) and the effects of chronic administration of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were not necessarily in accord with those at the plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors. The mRNA levels of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors were not altered by propranolol treatment, while beta(1)-adrenoceptor mRNA significantly decreased after administration of atenolol or bevantolol without changing the level of beta(2)-adrenoceptor mRNA. The present binding study with intact tissue segments clearly shows that the plasma membrane beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors of rat heart, in contrast to the homogenate binding sites and the mRNA levels, are differently affected by chronic treatment with three beta-adrenoceptor antagonists; up- and down-regulations of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors, respectively, by propranolol, and up-regulation of both the subtypes by atenolol, but no significant change in both the subtypes by bevantolol.", 
    "8": "Sympatho-excitatory manoeuvres are used to study vascular responsiveness in humans, but it is unclear if circulating adrenaline attenuates peripheral vasoconstriction during these manoeuvres. We hypothesized that vasoconstrictor responses to three manoeuvres (neck pressure, unilateral thigh-cuff release and isometric handgrip) would be greater after the administration of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. Seven men and six women underwent these manoeuvres while beat-by-beat arterial pressure (finger photoplethysmography), femoral mean blood velocity (Doppler ultrasound) and femoral artery diameter (edge-detection software) were measured. Femoral vascular conductance was calculated as flow/pressure. Propranolol had no effect on baseline femoral vascular conductance (P > 0.05). As a result of neck pressure, femoral vascular conductance was reduced 23.9 +/- 3.5% before vs. 33.2 +/- 3.2% after infusion of propranolol (P = 0.033). After thigh-cuff release, femoral vascular conductance declined 50.2 +/- 5.8% before vs. 57.4 +/- 9.6% after propranolol infusion (P = 0.496). During handgrip, femoral vascular conductance was reduced 47.2 +/- 9.6% before vs. 55.2 +/- 9.2% after propranolol administration (P = 0.447). After handgrip, women had a greater rise in conductance than men (women: 153 +/- 16.2%; men: 36.4 +/- 10.6%; P < 0.001), which was blunted by 54.8% by propranolol (P < 0.001 vs. control), but unaffected by propranolol in men (P = 0.355 vs. control). The finding that beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasodilatation minimally affects vascular responses to these sympatho-excitatory manoeuvres reinforces their utility in the investigation of sympathetic vascular regulation in humans. Interestingly, post-handgrip hyperaemia is greater in women than men and is, in part, beta-adrenergic receptor mediated.", 
    "9": "The long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetically transmitted cardiac arrhythmia due to ion channel protein abnormalities, which affects the transport of potassium and sodium ions across the cell membrane. Patients with LQTS may present with syncope, seizures or aborted cardiac arrest. LQTS is also an important cause of unexplained sudden cardiac death in the young. The diagnosis of LQTS is generally made on an ECG showing the prolonged QT interval. The establishment of LQTS registry and the discovery of genetic mutations causing LQTS have contributed greatly to the understanding of this condition and have also provided an impetus in understanding of other inherited cardiac arrhythmias. Genotype-phenotype correlation studies have allowed risk stratification of LQTS patients. Life style modification to avoid triggers for malignant cardiac arrhythmias, and the use of beta-blockers, pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, help to treat symptoms and reduce mortality in these patients.", 
    "10": "The aim of the study was to characterize the effects of induced moderate hypothermia on splanchnic blood flow, with particular reference to that of the pancreas and the islets of Langerhans. We also investigated how interference with the autonomic nervous system at different levels influenced the blood perfusion during hypothermia. For this purpose, hypothermia (body temperature of 28 degrees C) was induced by external cooling, whereas normothermic (37.5 degrees C) anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were used as controls. Some rats were pretreated with either propranolol, yohimbine, atropine, hexamethonium, or a bilateral abdominal vagotomy. Our findings suggest that moderate hypothermia elicits complex, organ-specific circulatory changes, with increased perfusion noted in the pylorus, as well as the whole pancreas and the pancreatic islets. The pancreatic islets maintain their high blood perfusion through mechanisms involving both sympathetic and parasympathetic mediators, whereas the increased pyloric blood flow is mediated through parasympathetic mechanisms. Renal blood flow was decreased, and this can be prevented by ganglionic blockade and is also influenced by beta-adrenoceptors.",

Using a mixed-methods (qualitative and quantitative) design, participants were interviewed about HF self-care, surveyed to measure factors anticipated to influence self-care, and tested for cognitive functioning. Audiotaped interviews were analyzed using content analysis. Qualitative and quantitative data were combined to produce a multidimensional typology of patients poor, good, or expert in HF self-care.",

    "16": "Lowering plasma low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), blood pressure, homocysteine, and preventing platelet aggregation using a combination of a statin, three blood pressure lowering drugs such as a thiazide, a beta blocker, and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor each at half standard dose; folic acid; and aspirin - called as polypill - was estimated to reduce cardiovascular events by approximately 80%. Essential fatty acids (EFAs) and their long-chain metabolites and other products prevent platelet aggregation, lower blood pressure, reduce LDL-C, and ameliorate the adverse actions of homocysteine. Thus, EFAs and their metabolites show all the actions expected of the \"polypill\". Unlike the proposed \"polypill\", EFAs are endogenous molecules, have no significant side effects, can be taken orally for long periods of time even by pregnant women, lactating mothers, and children; and have been shown to reduce the incidence cardiovascular diseases. I propose that a rational combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids is as beneficial as that of the \"polypill\"; and may even show additional benefit in the prevention of depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and enhance cognitive function.", 
    "17": "In this study, we report the effects of adding ionic liquids (ILs), as compared to adding conventional molecular organic solvents (MOSs), to aqueous buffer solutions containing molecular micelles in the separation of chiral analyte mixtures in micellar EKC (MEKC). The molecular micelle used in this study was polysodium oleyl-L-leucylvalinate (poly-L-SOLV). The ILs were 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, where the alkyl group was ethyl, butyl, hexyl, or octyl. These ILs were chosen due to their hydrophobicity, good solvating, and electrolyte properties. Thus, it was expected that these ILs would have favorable interactions with chiral analytes and not adversely affect the background current. Common CE buffers, mixed with a molecular micelle, and an IL or a MOS, were used for these chiral separations. The buffers containing an IL in the concentration range of 0.02-0.1 v/v were found to support a reasonable current when an electric field strength of 500 V/cm was applied across the capillary. However, a current break down was observed for the buffers containing more than 60% v/v MOS on application of the above-mentioned electric field. The chiral resolution and selectivity of the analytes were dependent on the concentration and type of IL or MOS used.", 
    "18": "Our first aim was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the hypotensive response elicited by 5-HT(2) receptor activation in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). In pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rats, intra-NTS administration of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), a wide spectrum 5-HT(2) receptor agonist, but not an antagonist of selective 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C) receptors, produced a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. The maximal cardiovascular changes obtained by DOI (0.5 pmol) could be almost completely abolished by prior intra-NTS microinjection (10 pmol) of MDL-100907, a selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist, but not by 5-HT(2B) or 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonists. In addition, using extracellular recordings we found that the large majority of identified cardiovascular rostroventrolateral medulla (RVLM) neurons were almost totally inhibited by NTS 5-HT(2A) receptor stimulation. We then investigated whether intra-NTS administration of a subthreshold dose (0.05 pmol) of DOI, known to facilitate the cardiovagal component of the baroreflex, could also modulate the sympathoinhibitory component of this reflex. These experiments showed that neither the decrease in the activity of the cardiovascular RVLM neurons and lumbar sympathetic nerve activities produced by aortic occlusion (gain of the baroreflex), nor the hypotensive response elicited by aortic nerve stimulation, were potentiated by the microinjection of DOI under such conditions. These data show that activation of 5-HT(2A), but not 5-HT(2B) or 5-HT(2C), receptors, located on NTS neurons, elicits depressor and bradycardic responses, and that this 5-HT(2A)-mediated hypotension is produced via the inhibition of RVLM cardiovascular neurons. In addition, NTS 5-HT(2A) receptor activation facilitates the cardiac but not the sympathetic baroreflex response.", 
    "19": "Successful fluid resuscitation after severe hemorrhage may be limited by activation of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. We postulated that pharmacologic inhibition of this reflex would restore cardiovascular hemodynamics more effectively than would volume repletion alone during resuscitation for hemorrhagic shock.", 
    "20": "We measured mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (CO) during fluid resuscitation after hemorrhaging laboratory rats until their CO had decreased by 90% to 95%. To block distinct components of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex, animals received capsazepine, yohimbine, or propranolol before iso-osmotic volume repletion.", 
    "21": "Hemorrhage decreased MAP and CO; despite an initial tachycardia, HR fell significantly in response to this large volume blood loss. The degree of hemorrhage-induced bradycardia mediated by the Bezold-Jarisch reflex predicted resuscitation MAP. Capsazepine-treated animals had greater resuscitation-induced increases in MAP (values in mm Hg +/- SEM), 130 +/- 12, when compared with the saline-only animals, 90 +/- 7 (p = 0.004). The capsazepine group also had a greater increase in systemic vascular resistance over baseline values during resuscitation (86% +/- 19%) compared with vehicle-treated animals (26% +/- 14%, p = 0.02). Capsazepine had no effect on cardiac dynamics. On the other hand, yohimbine increased HR and diminished CO, and propranolol dramatically increased stroke volume by 30%.",

    "23": "The contribution of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes to the catecholamine-mediated relaxations in gastric fundus from control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were investigated. Isolated organ bath studies and molecular techniques were used to characterize the beta-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating relaxation of rat gastric fundus. Isoprenaline-mediated relaxation was not significantly changed by nadolol (beta(1)-/beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist; 1 micromol/l) but only shifted to the right by SR59230A (3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-[[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-yl]amino]-(2S)-2-propanol oxalate salt, 0.1-1 micromol/l), a selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist, in a competitive manner. Relaxant responses to noradrenaline were antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner by SR59230A (0.1-1 micromol/l), but not by metoprolol (selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist; 0.1-1 micromol/l) and ICI-118551 (1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1Hinden- 4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol hydrochloride, selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist; 0.1-1 micromol/l). SR59230A (1 micromol/l) also caused a significant rightward shift in fenoterol-induced relaxation while ICI-118551 (1 micromol/l) did not have any effect. Selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist, BRL37344 ([4-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]phenoxy]acetic acid), caused biphasic relaxation which was not affected by nadolol (1 micromol/l). SR59230A (1 micromol/l) abolished only the first phase of BRL37344 response. beta(1)-, beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor mRNA expressions have been detected in a similar intensity in gastric fundus from control rats. Experimental diabetes caused a significant decrease in E(max) and pD(2) values of isoprenaline and noradrenaline. Diabetes also reduced E(max) but not pD(2) value of the first component of BRL37344-induced relaxation response. The band intensity of mRNA transcript of beta(3)-adrenoceptor was reduced in diabetics while no alteration has been found for beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptor mRNA transcripts between groups. These results show that functional beta-adrenoceptor subtype involved in catecholamine-mediated relaxations is beta(3)-adrenoceptor, and its function and mRNA expression are decreased in diabetes.", 
    "24": "Pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricle is a rare complication of acute myocardial infarction. The present report describes the unusual case of a 75-year-old woman who survived six years with an unrepaired left ventricular pseudoaneurysm. The diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm was made after two-dimensional echocardiography showed an extra large chamber next to the posterolateral region of the left ventricle with a massive thrombus; the diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging four years later. The patient refused surgical repair and continued with acetylsalicylic acid, a beta-blocker and an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. The patient was essentially asymptomatic and followed at six-month intervals until she died of carcinoma of the urinary bladder in the sixth year. The present case indicates that surgery is not the only therapeutic option in patients with a ventricular pseudoaneurysm.", 
    "25": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a beta-blocker (atenolol and metoprolol) on exercise heart rate (HR) and rate pressure product (RPP) during a morning and afternoon maximal exercise test (maxET) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Twenty-one CHD patients (59.9 +/- 8.9 years of age) treated with either atenolol or metoprolol participated in this study. All subjects underwent a morning and afternoon symptom-limited maximal exercise test (maxET) 2-3 h and 8-10 h after medication intake. No significant differences in exercise capacity (atenolol: 8.3 +/- 1.9 vs. 8.3 +/- 2.1 metabolic equivalents (METs); metoprolol: 8.8 +/- 2.0 vs. 8.7 +/- 2.0 METs) or rate of perceived exertion (atenolol: 7.4 +/- 1.9 vs. 7.4 +/- 1.7 METs; metoprolol: 7.2 +/- 1.5 vs. 6.8 +/- 0.9 METs) were observed between the 2 maxETs in either group. However, there was a discrepancy in cardiovascular and ischemic responses between morning and afternoon maxET. Subjects treated with atenolol demonstrated better overall control of HR and RPP during the afternoon maxET. The difference between morning and afternoon HRmax (11 +/- 8 vs. 19 +/- 9 beats.min-1; p = 0.05) was significantly higher in the metoprolol group, but did not attain significance for RPP (31 +/- 30 vs. 54 +/- 28 mmHg.beats.min-1.10-2; p = 0.09). Also, nearly one quarter of our subjects who had a normal morning maxET demonstrated an abnormal electrocardiogram response and (or) ischemia when exercise testing was done in the late afternoon. These changes were more prevalent in subjects taking metoprolol. The results of this study suggest that there is considerable time-of-day variation in the cardiovascular response to a maxET in CHD patients treated with a beta-blocker.", 
    "26": "The purpose of this study was to develop formulations and systematically evaluate in vitro performances of buccoadhesive patches of propranolol hydrochloride using the hydrophobic polymer Eudragit L-100 as the base matrix. The hydrophilic polymers Carbopol 934 and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) K30 were incorporated into the Eudragit patches, to provide the patches with bioadhesive properties and to modify the rate of drug release. The patches, which were prepared by the solvent casting method, were smooth and elegant in appearance; were uniform in thickness, weight, and drug content; showed no visible cracks; and showed good folding endurance. A 3(2) full factorial design was employed to study the effect of independent variables like hydrophilic polymers Carbopol 934 and PVP K30, which significantly influenced characteristics like swelling index, ex vivo mucoadhesive strength, in vitro drug release, and ex vivo residence time. A stability study of optimized Eudragit patches was done in natural human saliva; it was found that both drug and buccal patches were stable in human saliva. It can be concluded that the present buccal formulation can be an ideal system to improve the bioavailability of the drug by avoiding hepatic first-pass metabolism.",

    "28": "Systemic mastocytosis and elevated baseline serum tryptase are associated with severe and fatal anaphylaxis to hymenoptera stings. This is due to an increased number of cardiac mast cells resulting in high concentrations of cardiotoxic mast cell mediators in cardiac tissue during anaphylaxis. Severe anaphylaxis in coronary heart disease, in particular, is explained by an increased load of cardiac mast cells together with coronary stenosis favouring myocardial hypoxia. Contraindications for the use of medications for cardiac disease in patients with anaphylaxis, especially beta-blockers, have been questioned by epidemiologic studies considering the positive effects of these drugs on much more prevalent cardiac diseases.", 
    "29": "Preexisting cardiovascular disease, mastocytosis and elevated baseline serum tryptase are risk factors for fatal anaphylactic reactions or lasting morbidity due to myocardial or cerebrovascular infarction induced by anaphylaxis. Life-saving cardiac medications like beta-blockers may increase the severity of anaphylaxis. Since life-threatening cardiovascular diseases are much more frequent than anaphylaxis, the relative risk of either disease with and without these drugs must be analyzed carefully together with the cardiologist.", 
    "30": "Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates a number of biological responses including chemotaxis, cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis of cells. Even though temporal and spatial expression of TGF-beta3 suggests its role in chick limb development, it is not well characterized how TGF-beta3 regulates chondrogenic differentiation of limb bud mesenchymal cells. In this study, differential display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) screening and reverse transcription PCR analysis revealed that the mRNA expression of the gap junction protein, connexin 43 (Cx43), was significantly decreased during the first treatment of TGF-beta3 for 24 h in cultured chick leg bud mesenchymal cells. Treatment of these cells with lindane, a general gap junction blocker, or expression of dominant negative Cx43 increased apoptotic cell death and decreased the level of integrin beta4 protein, in a manner similar to that observed when these cells were exposed to TGF-beta3. Similarly, exposure of cultured leg chondroblasts to a functional blocking antibody against integrin-beta4 induced an increase in apoptosis. Treatment of cells with TGF-beta3 decreased the membrane translocation of PKC-alpha, leading to activation of ERK. The increase in apoptotic cell death triggered by TGF-beta3 and dominant negative Cx43 was blocked by inhibition of ERK but increased by inhibition of PKC. Collectively, these data indicate that, in cultured chick leg bud mesenchyme cells, TGF-beta3 treatment downregulates Cx43 and induces apoptotic cell death via downregulation of integrin beta4, activation of ERK and suppression of PKC-alpha activation.",

This study examines the effects of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation upon phenylephrine-induced elevations of intracellular Ca(2+)([Ca(2+)](i)) in human cultured prostatic stromal cells, and contractility of human prostatic tissue. Human cultured prostatic stromal cells were used for [(3)H]-cAMP accumulation studies or were loaded with 5-oxazolecarboxylic acid, 2-(6-(bis(2-((acetyloxy)methoxy)-2-oxoethyl)amino)-5-(2-(2-(bis(2-((acetyloxy)methoxy)-2-oxoethyl)amino)-5-methylphenoxy)ethoxy)-2-benzofuranyl)-, (acetyloxy)methyl ester (FURA-2AM, 10 microM) for Ca(2+) imaging studies. The beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline increased the accumulation of [(3)H]-cAMP (pEC(50)+/-S.E.M. 6.58+/-0.11) in human cultured prostatic stromal cells, an effect antagonized by the beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist (+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol (ICI 118,551), but not by the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol. Isoprenaline (3 microM), the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin (20 microM) and the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, rolipram (10 microM) inhibited the elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) elicited by phenylephrine (20 microM). The effect of isoprenaline could be blocked by ICI 118,551 (100 nM), the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor cis-N-(2-phenylcyclopentyl)-azacyclotridec-1-en-2-amine (MDL 12,330A, 20 microM) and the K(Ca) channel blocker, iberiotoxin (100 nM), but not by atenolol (1 microM) or the K(ATP) channel blocker, glibenclamide (3 microM).

    "52": "Snake venoms have provided a number of novel ligands with therapeutic potential. We have constructed a partial cDNA library from the mRNA of Ophiophagus hannah (king cobra) venom gland tissue and identified five new genes encoding proteins belonging to the three-finger toxin family of snake venom proteins. We have isolated and characterized one of these beta-sheet containing proteins with a mass of 7012.43 +/- 0.91 Da from the venom. The protein was nonlethal up to a dose of 10 mg/kg when injected intraperitoneally into Swiss albino mice. However, it induces labored breathing and death at a dose of 100 mg/kg. It does not show any hemolytic or anticoagulant activity. It caused a dose-dependent decrease of heart rate in vivo (anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats) and also ex vivo (Langendorff isolated rat heart). This is in contrast to classical cardiotoxins from snake venom that increase the heart rate in animals. Radioligand displacement studies showed that this protein targets beta-adrenergic receptors with a binding affinity (Ki) of 5.3 and 2.3 microM toward beta1 and beta2 subtypes, respectively, to bring about its effect, and hence, it was named as beta-cardiotoxin.

The presence of a proinhibitor for intracellular cathepsin B, and an inhibitor for thiol protease (cathepsin B/H/L, calpain), was also assessed to verify necrotic cell death event in oxidative conditions. Next, RGC cultures under oxidative stress were incubated with timolol, betaxolol, carteolol, and nipradilol added, respectively, for 24 h culture.

The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a single population model that describes S(-)-carvedilol pharmacokinetics from both the immediate-release (IR) and the new controlled-release dosage forms of the racemate. Carvedilol IR data (1270 measurements) were obtained from 2 open-label studies (50 mg/25 mg Q12 hours for 2 doses). Carvedilol CR data (2058 measurements) were obtained from an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-rising (10, 20, 40, and 80 mg), 4-period balanced crossover study. All data were simultaneously analyzed using NONMEM V. Leverage analysis and internal evaluations were conducted for the final model. A 2-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination provided the best fit. The model included different absorption rates (KAs) for the CR and IR morning (IR(AM)) and evening (IR(PM)) doses; incorporating change-points at certain times. Estimates of KAs indicated that the absorption was slower at equivalent times and extended for CR relative to IR carvedilol. Oral clearance of S(-)-carvedilol was 149 L/h. The IR(PM) and the CR doses had bioavailability (F(rel)) of 0.80 and 0.76, respectively, relative to the IR(AM) dose. The inter-subject variability in KAs was lower for the CR dosage form than the original IR dosage form. Estimation of interoccasion variability on KAs and F(rel) for the CR dosage form improved the fit. The model performed well in simulation and leverage analysis indicated its robustness. The model will be a useful tool for future simulation studies.", 
    "62": "Sustained-release tablets of propranolol HCl were prepared by direct compression using chitosan and xanthan gum as matrix materials. The effective prolongation of drug release in acidic environment was achieved for matrix containing chitosan together with xanthan gum which prolonged the drug release more extensive than that containing single polymer. Increasing lactose into matrix could adjust the drug release characteristic by enhancing the drug released. Component containing chitosan and xanthan gum at ratio 1:1 and lactose 75% w/w was selected for preparing the layered matrix by tabletting. Increasing the amount of matrix in barrier or in middle layer resulted in prolongation of drug release. From the investigation of drug release from one planar surface, the lag time for drug release through barrier layer was apparently longer as the amount of barrier was enhanced. Least square fitting the experimental dissolution data to the mathematical expressions (power law, first order, Higuchi's and zero order) was performed to study the drug release mechanism. Layering with polymeric matrix could prolong the drug release and could shift the release pattern approach to zero order. The drug release from chitosan-xanthan gum three-layer tablet was pH dependent due to the difference in charge density in different environmental pH. FT-IR and DSC studies exhibited the charge interaction between of NH3+ of chitosan molecule and COO- of acetate or pyruvate groups of xanthan gum molecule. The SEM images revealed the formation of the loose membranous but porous film that was due to the gel layer formed by the polymer relaxation upon absorption of dissolution medium. The decreased rate of polymer dissolution resulting from the decreased rate of solvent penetration was accompanied by a decrease in drug diffusion due to ionic interaction between chitosan and xanthan gum. This was suggested that the utilization of chitosan and xanthan gum could give rise to layered matrix tablet exhibiting sustained drug release.", 
    "63": "Hypertension has been associated with changes in endothelial function in both large muscular arteries and small resistance arteries. We evaluated the relationship between blood flow velocity and dilatation of the brachial artery following transient forearm ischemia and acetylcholine-induced relaxation in subcutaneous small arteries and the influence of antihypertensive therapy on both in patients with essential hypertension. Thirty-one previously untreated hypertensive patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to treatment with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril or the beta-blocker atenolol and compared with 17 healthy normotensive controls. Before and after 1 year of treatment, while still on active medication, flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was measured in the brachial artery using ultrasound while relaxation to acetylcholine in small arteries was tested in vitro in a myograph. FMD correlated inversely to resting brachial artery diameter (r = -0.38, p<0.05). FMD corrected for resting diameter (FMD(corr)) was lower in patients (3.0+/-0.2%) compared with controls (4.2+/-0.3%, p<0.01). In both patients and controls, FMD(corr) was related to flow velocity in a non-linear way with FMD(corr) reaching a maximum despite increasing flow velocities, and in the patients, FMD(corr) was only reduced at high flow velocities. Furthermore, patients had a reduced acetylcholine-induced relaxation in small arteries (p = 0.04). Perindopril and atenolol reduced blood pressure to similar levels and both drugs improved FMD(corr) to a similar degree without any effects on relaxation to acetylcholine in small arteries. The present study demonstrates the role of correcting for differences in baseline diameter during measurements of FMD and a non-linear relationship between flow velocity and FMD in the brachial artery. Furthermore, the results suggest different effects of antihypertensive treatment on endothelial function in large and small arteries.", 
    "64": "The aim of this study was to characterise the P2 receptors involved in purinergic relaxant responses in rat distal colon circular muscle. Concentration-response curves for purinergic agonists were constructed on methacholine-precontracted circular muscle strips of rat distal colon in the absence and presence of the nerve blocker TTX and the ecto-nucleotidase inhibitor ARL67156. The effects of the P2 receptor antagonists RB2, PPADS, suramin, MRS2179 and NF279, the NO-synthase inhibitor L-NAME and the small conductance K(+) channel blocker apamin were investigated. The localisation of the different P2 receptors was examined immunocytochemically. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated the expression of P2Y(1), P2Y(6) and P2X(1) receptors on smooth muscle cells and P2Y(2), P2Y(12), P2X(2) and P2X(3) receptors in the myenteric plexus; almost a quarter of the P2Y(2)-immunopositive neurons co-expressed nNOS. The P2X-selective agonist alphabetameATP and the P2Y-selective agonist ADPbetaS were the most potent relaxants; their effects were abolished by apamin. The effect of ADPbetaS was antagonised by the P2Y(1)-selective antagonist MRS2179 pointing to interaction with the muscular P2Y(1)-receptors. The relaxant effect of alphabetameATP was partially reduced by TTX and concentration-dependently antagonised by PPADS, suramin, RB2 and the P2X(1)-selective antagonist NF279; this correlates with an interaction with neuronal P2X(3) and muscular P2X(1) receptors. UTP was the least potent agonist; its effect was markedly increased by ARL67156, nearly abolished by TTX and reduced by L-NAME. This points to interaction with the neuronal P2Y(2)-receptors inducing relaxation, at least partially, by NO release.", 
    "65": "A systematic study was made to explain the large improvements in separation performance and capacity of basic compounds at alkaline conditions. The adsorption of three probe components was investigated on four alkaline-stable silica-based C18 columns at three different pH-levels: 3, 7 and 11. The probes were 3-phenyl-1-propanol (neutral), 2-phenylbutyric acid (acidic) and metoprolol (basic). Adsorption isotherms were acquired over a broad concentration range, in order to detect both high and low energy sites. Before the choice of the proper adsorption isotherm model, the adsorption energy distribution (AED) was calculated yielding the number of different kinds of interaction sites between the solute and the stationary phase. The neutral probe was entirely unaffected by pH and its AED was unimodal (one site) indicating homogenous adsorption. For the acidic probe the interactions were unimodal at pH 3 where the probe is uncharged and at least bimodal (two sites) at pH 7 and 11 where the probe is charged. For the basic probe, the interactions were heterogeneous at both pH 3 and 11. The equilibrium constants of the high and low energy sites were different by a factor of 55-100 at pH 3 and only 6-7 at pH 11. The difference in saturation capacities between the two sites was much smaller at pH 11 where 20% of the total capacity is from the high energy site, as compared to pH 3 where the high energy site was only 2-5% of the total capacity. This explains why peaks of amines (basic solutes) tail at low pH while their peaks are symmetrical at alkaline pH. The Langmuir model fit the unimodal data and the bi-Langmuir model fit the bimodal AED data. The calculated band profiles based on these parameters agreed excellently with the experimental data. The electrostatic-modified Langmuir, on the other hand, did not describe this adsorption process well.", 
    "66": "Chronic heart failure may be caused by systolic pump failure and/or impairment of diastolic filling of the ventricles. The standard pharmacotherapy for systolic heart failure includes an ACE inhibitor, betablocker, diuretics and, in patients with severe symptoms, a low dose aldosterone antagonist. An AT1 receptor blocker is indicated for those patients who do not tolerate ACE inhibitors. If patients remain in the functional class NYHA III-IV despite optimal medication and have cardiac dyssynchrony, biventricular pacing may improve the symptoms and prognosis. While evidence-based treatment significantly reduces morbidity and mortality in systolic heart failure, hardly any results from clinical trials are available for diastolic heart failure. Therefore, therapy in patients with diastolic heart failure remains in most cases empirical.", 
    "67": "The different film thicknesses of the sodium alginate-magnesium aluminum silicate (SA-MAS) microcomposite films were prepared by varying volumes of the composite dispersion for casting. Effect of film thickness on thermal behavior, solid-state crystallinity, mechanical properties, water uptake and erosion, and water vapor and drug permeability of the microcomposite films were investigated. The film thickness caused a small change in thermal behavior of the films when tested using DSC and TGA. The crystallinity of the thin films seemed to increase when compared with the thick films. The thin films gave higher tensile strength than the thick films, whereas % elongation of the films was on the contrary resulted in the lower Young's modulus of the films when the film thickness was increased. This was due to the weaker of the film bulk, suggesting that the microscopic matrix structure of the thick films was looser than that of the thin films. Consequently, water uptake and erosion, water vapor permeation and drug diffusion coefficient of the thick films were higher than those of the thin films. The different types of drug on permeability of the films also showed that a positive charge and large molecule of drug, propranolol HCl, had higher lag time and lower diffusion coefficient that acetaminophen, a non-electrolyte and small molecule. This was because of a higher affinity of positive charge drug on MAS in the films. The findings suggest that the evaporation rate of solvent in different volumes of the composite dispersion used in the preparation method could affect crystallinity and strength of the film surface and film bulk of the microcomposite films. This led to a change in water vapor and drug permeability of the films.", 
    "68": "Long-term propranolol treatment reduces arterial blood pressure in hypertensive individuals mainly by reducing peripheral vascular resistance, but mechanisms underlying their vasodilatory effect remain poorly investigated. This study aimed to investigate whether long-term propranolol administration ameliorates the impairment of relaxing responses of aorta and mesenteric artery from rats made hypertensive by chronic nitric oxide (NO) deficiency, and underlying mechanisms mediating this phenomenon. Male Wistar rats were treated with N(omega)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 20 mg/rat/day) for four weeks. DL-Propranolol (30 mg/rat/day) was given concomitantly to L-NAME in the drinking water. Treatment with L-NAME markedly increased blood pressure, an effect largely attenuated by DL-propranolol. In phenylephrine-precontracted aortic rings, the reduction of relaxing responses for acetylcholine (0.001-10 microM) in L-NAME group was not modified by DL-propranolol, whereas in mesenteric rings the impairment of acetylcholine-induced relaxation by L-NAME was significantly attenuated by DL-propranolol. In mesenteric rings precontracted with KCl (80 mM), DL-propranolol failed to attenuate the impairment of acetylcholine-induced relaxation by L-NAME. The contractile responses to extracellular CaCl2 (1-10 mM) were increased in L-NAME group, and co-treatment with DL-propranolol reduced this response in both preparations in most Ca2+ concentrations used. The NO2/NO3 plasma levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were reduced in L-NAME-treated rats, both of which were significantly prevented by DL-propranolol. In conclusion, propranolol-induced amplification of the relaxation to acetylcholine in mesenteric arteries from L-NAME-treated rats is sensitive to depolarization. Additional mechanisms involving blockade of Ca2+ entry in the vascular smooth muscle and increase in NO bioavailability contributes to beneficial effects of long-term propranolol treatment.",

The PA1b is a single chain peptide consisting of 37 amino acid residues with 6 cysteines which constitutes the cystine-knot structure. Using microfluorometry and patch clamp techniques, we found that PA1b significantly elevated the intracellular calcium level ([Ca2+]i) and elicited membrane capacitance increase in the primary rat pancreatic beta cells. The PA1b effect on [Ca2+]i elevation was abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ or in the presence of L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nimodipine. Interestingly, we found that PA1b significantly depolarized membrane potential, which could lead to the opening of voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels and influx of extracellular Ca2+, and then evoke robust secretion. In this study we identified the plant peptide PA1b which is capable of affecting the excitability and function of mammalian pancreatic beta cell.", 
    "71": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) hampers delivery of several drugs including chemotherapeutics to the brain. The drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp), expressed on brain capillary endothelial cells, is part of the BBB. P-gp expression on capillary endothelium decreases 5 days after brain irradiation, which may reduce P-gp function and increase brain levels of P-gp substrates. To elucidate whether radiation therapy reduces P-gp expression and function in the brain, right hemispheres of rats were irradiated with single doses of 2-25 Gy followed by 10 mg kg(-1) of the P-gp substrate cyclosporine A (CsA) intravenously (i.v.), with once 15 Gy followed by CsA (10, 15 or 20 mg kg(-1)), or with fractionated irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) followed by CsA (10 mg kg(-1)) 5 days later. Additionally, four groups of three rats received 25 Gy once and were killed 10, 15, 20 or 25 days later. The brains were removed and P-gp detected immunohistochemically. P-gp function was assessed by [(11)C]carvedilol uptake using quantitative autoradiography. Irradiation increased [(11)C]carvedilol uptake dose-dependently, to a maximum of 20% above non irradiated hemisphere. CsA increased [(11)C]carvedilol uptake dose-dependently in both hemispheres, but more (P<0.001) in the irradiated hemisphere. Fractionated irradiation resulted in a lost P-gp expression 10 days after start irradiation, which coincided with increased [(11)C]carvedilol uptake. P-gp expression decreased between day 15 and 20 after single dose irradiation, and increased again thereafter. Rat brain irradiation results in a temporary decreased P-gp function.",

Electronic spin resonance spectroscopy studies were carried out, at 25 degrees C and at an ionic strength of 0.10 M in NaCl, using 5-, 12- and 16-doxylstearic acid probes (AS). The immobilization degree of solubilized stearic acid spin probes was found to vary with the position of the nitroxide group in the sequence 5-doxylstearic acid>12-doxylstearic acid>16-doxylstearic acid for SDS and 12-doxylstearic acid>5-doxylstearic acid>16-doxylstearic acid for both bile salts investigated. Therefore, from the rotational correlational time values obtained, it can be inferred that the structure of bile salt micelles is markedly different from that of SDS micelles and the results suggest that the bile salt micelles studied have similar structure independently of differences in the molecular structure of the respective bile salts. Drug location studies were performed at pH 4.0 (SDS solutions) or 7.0 (bile salt solutions) and 10.8 in order to study the effect of the drug ionisation on its relative position on micelles. The results have shown that drug location is controlled by the (i) drug hydrophilicity and acid/base properties, with the more soluble compound in water (atenolol) exhibiting smaller variation of rotational correlational time (in SDS and bile salts solutions), and with both beta-blockers exhibiting smaller deviations in the protonated forms and (ii) the bile salt monomers, with the dihydroxylic bile salt (deoxycholate) producing larger differences. The work described herein allow us to conclude that the (protonated) beta-blockers are probably located on the surface of the detergent micelles, and linked to them by means of essentially electrostatic forces, while the (neutral) benzodiazepines are probably located deeper in the interior of the micelles.",

In our experiments noradrenaline, applied in the bath, enhanced excitability of layer 5 pyramidal neurons. The number of evoked action potentials following current injection to the soma increased by 44.7% on average. In the basal dendrites and spines the evoked Ca2+ responses were also markedly enhanced. Noradrenaline-induced effects could be blocked by the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol.

The adopted strategy combined the use of PARAFAC, for extraction of the pure analyte signal, with the standard addition method, for a determination in the presence of an individual matrix effect caused by the quenching action of the proteins present in the urine. The urine samples were previously 100 times diluted. For each sample, four standard additions were performed, in triplicates. A specific PARAFAC model was built for each triplicate of each sample, from three-way arrays formed by 231 emission wavelengths, 8 excitation wavelengths and 5 measurements (sample plus 4 additions). The models were built with three factors and always explained more than 99.87% of the total variance. The obtained loadings were related to PRO and two background interferences. The scores related to PRO were used for a linear regression in the standard addition method. The obtained determinations in the PRO concentration range from 5.0 to 20.0 microg ml(-1) provided recoveries between 91.1 and 108.4%.",

The efficacy of existing drugs, such as carvedilol, for rate control and, possibly, suppression of AF, is more appreciated. Efforts are being made to modify existing agents, such as amiodarone, in an attempt to ameliorate safety and adverse effect concerns. This has resulted in promising data from the deiodinated amiodarone analog, dronedarone, and further work with celivarone and ATI-2042. In an attempt to minimize ventricular proarrhythmia, atrial selective drugs, such as intravenous vernakalant, have demonstrated efficacy in terminating AF in addition to promising data in suppression recurrences when used orally. Several other atrial selective drugs are being developed by multiple manufacturers. Other novel therapeutic mechanisms, such as drugs that enhance GAP junction conduction, are being developed to achieve more effective drug therapy than is offered by existing compounds. Finally, nonantiarrhythmic drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, high-mobility group coenzyme A enzyme inhibitors and omega-3 fatty acids/fish oil, appear to have a role in suppressing AF in certain patient subtypes.

They also have some central effects because of central inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system that also lowers blood pressure. In addition, evidence suggests that beta-blockers work at the vascular biology level to produce nitric oxide release. Beta-blockers differ in terms of their betareceptor selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and benefit/risk in diabetes and insulin sensitivity. Nebivolol, the newest of the beta-blockers, is long acting and the most cardioselective beta1-blocker currently available.

Bisoprolol has anti-arrhythmic effects, but its direct effect on I(Na) in cardiac cells remains unclear. Accordingly, in the present study we investigated the effects of bisoprolol on ventricular I(Na) in diastolic heart failure (DHF) and normal rats. 2. The DHF model was produced by abdominal aortic coarctation for 4 weeks and single ventricular myocytes were isolated by enzymatic dissociation. The electrophysiological actions of bisoprolol on I(Na) currents were investigated using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique. 3. The membrane capacitance of rats in the DHF group was significantly greater than that of the control group and the current-voltage curve was simultaneously shifted downward. Bisoprolol concentration-dependently decreased I(Na) in ventricular myocytes of both groups (at -45 mV), with IC(50) values of 19.53 +/- 0.06 and 40.78 +/- 0.03 micromol/L in the control and DHF groups, respectively. 4. In both groups, the current-voltage curves were shifted upwards, whereas activation potentials, peak currents and reversal potentials showed no significant changes. At -45 mV, the descent ratio of current densities in the DHF group was lower than that of the control group. In both groups, inactivation curves were shifted to more negative potentials, but activation curves and recovery curves were not altered. Changes in the half-inactivation voltage, V(0.5), and the slope of the inactivation curve, S, were similar for both groups. 5.

    "138": "The contribution of Na(+)/H(+) exchange (achieved by NHE proteins) to the regulation of beta-cell cytosolic pH(c), and the role of pH(c) changes in glucose-induced insulin secretion are disputed and were examined here. Using real-time PCR, we identified plasmalemmal NHE1 and intracellular NHE7 as the two most abundant NHE isoforms in mouse islets. We, therefore, compared insulin secretion, cytosolic free Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](c)) and pH(c) in islets from normal mice and mice bearing an inactivating mutation of NHE1 (Slc9A1-swe/swe). The experiments were performed in HCO(-)(3)/CO(2) or HEPES/NaOH buffers. PCR and functional approaches showed that NHE1 mutant islets do not express compensatory pH-regulating mechanisms. NHE1 played a greater role than HCO(-)(3)-dependent mechanisms in the correction of an acidification imposed by a pulse of NH(4)Cl. In contrast, basal pH(c) (in low glucose) and the alkalinization produced by high glucose were independent of NHE1. Dimethylamiloride, a classic blocker of Na(+)/H(+) exchange, did not affect pH(c) but increased insulin secretion in NHE1 mutant islets, indicating unspecific effects. In control islets, glucose similarly increased [Ca(2+)](c) and insulin secretion in HCO(-)(3) and HEPES buffer, although pH(c) changed in opposite directions. The amplification of insulin secretion that glucose produces when [Ca(2+)](c) is clamped at an elevated level by KCl was also unrelated to pH(c) and pH(c) changes. All effects of glucose on [Ca(2+)](c) and insulin secretion proved independent of NHE1. In conclusion, NHE1 protects beta-cells against strong acidification, but has no role in stimulus-secretion coupling. The changes in pH(c) produced by glucose involve HCO(-)(3)-dependent mechanisms. Variations in beta-cell pH(c) are not causally related to changes in insulin secretion.",

The only statistically significant difference between the groups was higher postoperative Ca-antagonist use in the HCS group. Rates of postoperative AF, however, were significantly lower in the IACC group (21.52%) than that in the HCS group (11.05%; P < .01). Postoperative Ca-antagonist use in the HCS group and smoking in the IACC group were independent predictors of AF after CABG.

In-hospital mortality for the 4 groups (neither, PAD, stroke, PAD and stroke) was 4.5% versus 7.2% versus 8.9% versus 9.4% (p <0.001) and that for 6-month mortality was 3.9% versus 8.8% versus 9.3% versus 12%, and these differences persisted after accounting for differences in baseline characteristics. Use of evidence-based therapies was associated with significantly less morbidity and mortality in all ACS subgroups. In conclusion, outcomes after ACS are worse in patients with PAD or stroke, with the highest risk in patients with the 2 conditions and the use of evidence-based therapies are associated with improved outcomes in all ACS subgroups.", 
    "141": "High glucose inhibits endothelial cell proliferation. Thus, we studied cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p15(INK4b) in high glucose-induced effects in human umbilical endothelial cells at 24h. High glucose decreased cell proliferation while arresting cells in G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle. High glucose increased phospho-extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, p15(INK4b) protein and mRNA expression. High glucose-inhibited cell proliferation was attenuated by antisense p15(INK4b) oligonucleotide. Moreover, PD98059 attenuated high glucose-induced p15(INK4b) protein expression. High glucose increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) gene transcriptional activity and mRNA expression. However, neither SB431542 (type I TGF-beta receptor blocker) nor TGF-beta1 antibody affected high glucose-induced p15(INK4b) protein expression. Additionally, N-acetylcysteine (an antioxidant) attenuated high glucose-induced growth arrest and p15(INK4b) protein expression. Thus, high glucose-induced growth arrest is dependent on p15(INK4b) and oxidative stress in endothelial cells. Moreover, high glucose-induced p15(INK4b) protein expression is dependent on ERK1/2 and oxidative stress.",

The objective of this study was to compare the effects of compounds on cardiac action potentials recorded from guinea-pig ventricular myocytes and dog Purkinje fibres.", 
    "144": "Effects of dofetilide, sotalol, cisapride, terfenadine, haloperidol and sparfloxacin, compounds known to cause QT prolongation (positive controls), and nifedipine and verapamil, not associated with QT prolongation (negative controls) were studied on intracellular action potentials recorded from guinea-pig isolated ventricular myocytes (VM) and dog isolated Purkinje fibres (PF). Prolongation of action potential duration (APD) by sotalol, dofetilide and sparfloxacin was concentration-dependent and of greater magnitude in dog PF compared to guinea-pig VM. The maximum prolongation of APD in guinea-pig VM at 0.5 and 1 Hz was approximately 25% and this was associated with complete inhibition of I(Kr) by dofetilide. Effects on APD of cisapride and haloperidol in both preparations, and terfenadine in guinea-pig VM, were biphasic, consistent with inhibition of multiple ion channels. There was no effect of terfenadine on APD in dog PF. Haloperidol increased APD by more than 25% in guinea-pig VM, consistent with effects on additional repolarizing currents. The negative controls shortened APD to a greater extent in guinea-pig VM compared to dog PF. In general, the positive control drugs increased action potential triangulation (APD(40-90)) to a greater extent than APD(90).",

    "146": "The use of sub-2-microm particle columns for fast high throughput metabolite ID applications was investigated. Three LC-MS methods based on different sub-2-microm particle size columns using the same analytical 3 min gradient were developed (Methods A, B, and C). Method A was comprised of a 1.8 microm particle column coupled to an MS, methods B and C utilized a 1.7 microm particle column (BEH 50 x 2.1 mm2 id) and 1.8 microm particle column coupled to a Q-TOF MS. The precision and the separation efficiency of the methods was compared with repeated standard injections (N=10) of reference compounds verapamil (VP), propranolol, and fluoxetine. Separation efficiency and MS/MS spectral quality were also evaluated for separation and detection of VP and its two major metabolites norverapamil (NVP) and O-demethylverapamil (ODMVP) in human-liver microsomal incubates. Results show that 1.8 microm particle columns show similar performance for separation of VP and its major metabolites and comparable spectral quality in MS(E) mode of the Q-TOF instrument compared to 1.7 microm particle columns. Additionally, the study also confirmed that sub-2-microm particle size columns can be operated with standard analytical HPLC but that performance is maximized by integrating column in UPLC method with reduced void volumes. All the methods are suitable for the determination of major metabolites for compounds with high metabolic turnover. The high throughput metabolite profile analysis using 384-well plate format of up to 48 compounds in incubates of human-liver microsomes was discussed.", 
    "147": "Variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis is a medical emergency with a high mortality. The therapeutic options in patients with portal hypertension are: treatment of acute bleeding from varices, prevention of the first bleeding episode and prevention of rebleeding. Treatment of acute bleeding from varices includes: blood volume restitution, use of antibiotics for preventing bacterial infections, vasoactive drug therapy (terlipressin, somatostatin, vapreotide, octreotide), endoscopic band ligation for acute esophageal bleeding and endoscopic therapy with tissue adhesive (cyanoacrylate) for acute gastric variceal bleeding. Endoscopic treatments are best used in association with pharmacological therapy. In primary prophylaxis non-selective beta- blocker therapy and endoscopic band ligation are useful. Beta blockers, band ligation or both should be used for prevention of recurrent bleeding. In patients who fail endoscopic and pharmacological treatment for prevention of rebleeding TIPS and transplantation should be considered.",

(2) In three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), ranolazine, in combination with standard anti-anginal medications, led to modest but statistically significant improvements in exercise duration, and reductions in the frequency of angina episodes and nitroglycerin consumption, when compared to standard anti-anginal medications only. The clinical significance of these improvements is unknown. Most of the participants in studies were male and Caucasian. Thus, there are questions about the drug's efficacy in other populations. (3) One RCT suggests that the addition of ranolazine to standard treatment is ineffective in reducing major cardiovascular events that are associated with acute coronary syndromes. (4) The adverse effects reported with ranolazine include dizziness, nausea, asthenia (weakness), constipation, and headache. Long-term data from one trial indicate that there is no significant increase in the incidence of death or arrhythmia among those taking ranolazine. More clinical trials of ranolazine are needed to confirm its long-term safety, its optimal dosing, its efficacy in combination with full dose beta-blockers with or without calcium channel blockers, and its potential role in the treatment of other cardiovascular conditions.",

The mean systolic blood pressure [BP] was 160 mmHg (range 150 mmHg to 165 mmHg) and the mean diastolic BP was 100 mmHg (range 90 mmHg to 100 mmHg). Plasma tissue plasminogen activator antigen (tPA-Ag), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 antigen (PAI-1-Ag), PAI-1 activity, tPA-Ag/PAI-1-Ag index, fibrinogen and euglobulin lysis time were determined before and after two months of therapy. tPA-Ag and PAI-Ag levels were measured by ELISA. After this period, treatment with nebivolol (5 mg/day) in all patients was associated with a significant decrease in systolic BP and diastolic BP (P<0.001 for each), heart rate (P<0.01), fibrinogen (P<0.005) and euglobulin lysis time (P<0.01). The tPA-Ag and tPA-Ag/PAI-1-Ag index levels were increased significantly (P<0.001 for each) in all patients, but the PAI-1-Ag (P>0.05) and PAI-1 activity (P>0.05) did not show significant change. In the present study, there was no correlation between decreases in arterial BP and decreases in fibrinolytic parameters (P>0.05), but there was a positive, statistically significant correlation between fibrinogen and body mass index (P<0.001).",

In diabetic subjects with cardiac autonomic neuropathy, vagal activity during the night is often reduced. The reduction results in relative or absolute sympathetic activation, which could increase cardiovascular risk. Pathophysiological and clinical data suggests that antihypertensive treatment should reduce rather than induce sympathetic activity in this setting. Beta blocking agents, ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists of verapamil or diltiazem type and selective imidazoline receptor agonists reduce sympathetic activity and, therefore, may have a beneficial effect in diabetic patients with disturbed sympathovagal balance.",

The echocardiography did not demonstrate structural cardiac abnormalities but the magnetic resonance recently showed thinning of the right ventricular wall.

The monolithic silica capillary columns were prepared by a sol-gel process in fused-silica capillaries with an inner diameter of 50 mum and subsequently in situ immobilization of vancomycin as a chiral selector by reductive amination. Enantioselectivity was obtained for eight pairs of enantiomers in nonaqueous polar organic or aqueous mobile phases and most of them were baseline-separated with high column efficiencies. It was observed that the organic modifier ratio (MeOH/ACN) in the polar organic mobile phase played a significant role in controlling the resolution and efficiency of the enantiomers. In enantiomeric separation of propranolol, repeatability for column efficiency and resolution in the nonaqueous mobile phase was given in terms of RSD values at 1.1 and 2.3% (n = 5) for run-to-run injections and 7.2 and 9.6% (n = 5) for column-to-column testing while repeatability for the separation of thalidomide in the aqueous mobile phase was given in terms of RSD values at 1.5, 2.8% and 6.1, 10.5%, respectively.",

    "161": "In TAC mice, the left ventricular weight-to-body weight (LVW/BW) ratio increased by 35% after 2 weeks. Levels of ANP, beta-MHC and skACT mRNA in the left ventricles increased 2.2-fold, 2.0-fold and 12.1-fold, respectively, whereas alpha-MHC and SERCA mRNA levels decreased by approximately 50%. Although propranolol blunted cardiomyocyte growth, with approximately an 11% increase in the LVW/BW ratio, it enhanced the expression of ANP, beta-MHC and skACT genes (10.5-fold, 27.7-fold and 22.7-fold, respectively). Propranolol also enhanced phenylephrine-stimulated ANP and beta-MHC gene expression in cultured cardiomyocytes. Similar results were obtained with metoprolol, a selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, but not with ICI 118551, a beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist.",

The role of beta-adrenergic signalling in the development of hypertrophy is incompletely understood. The finding of an upregulated expression of hypertrophy-related genes but a suppressed hypertrophy following beta-blockade reveals previously unrecognized sympatho-adrenergic mechanisms of hypertrophic growth.",

We believe that the use of topical steroids in this case probably led to increased fungal penetration, with the formation of a lens-iris fungal mass and subsequent malignant glaucoma. Nonresponse to medical therapy warrants urgent surgical intervention. To the best of our knowledge, Aspergillus-induced keratomycotic glaucoma has never been reported previously. This report also highlights that therapeutic keratoplasty with cataract extraction alone may not be sufficient for management of such cases, and a limited pars plana vitrectomy may be needed.", 
    "168": "The electrophysiological effects of carvedilol, a beta-blocking agent with vasodilating actions, have been studied on rabbit pacemaker cells using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Nystatin-perforated patch recordings from the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes demonstrated that 1-3 microM of carvedilol caused a decrease in the spontaneous firing frequency, depolarization of the maximal diastolic potential, and prolongation of the action potential duration in both species. Voltage clamp experiments were performed using SA and AV node myocytes to identify and define the carvedilol-induced changes in the Ca(2+) current, I(Ca), delayed rectifier K(+) current, I(K), and hyperpolarization-activated inward current, I(f). In the SA node cells, 1 microM of carvedilol blocked I(K), I(Ca), and I(f) by 72%, 47%, and 22%, respectively. In the AV node cells, the corresponding reductions were 64% (I(K)) and 46% (I(Ca)), respectively. In both the SA and AV nodes the decrease in I(K) appeared to be mainly due to the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier, I(Kr), since the high dose of carvedilol blocked I(K) in the SA and AV nodes to a submaximal degree. In conclusion, effective doses of carvedilol have classical class III antiarrhythmic actions and a negative chronotropic effect resulting from the inhibition of I(K) and I(Ca). Both actions may be efficacious for treating supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.",

Part of their inhibitory effect is attributed to the osmolality of extracellular solutions, because hERG IC(20) and extrapolated osmolality at the hERG IC(20) strongly correlate. Water-soluble non-ionic solubilizers/surfactants are potent inhibitors of hERG K(+) current with IC(20) concentrations of 0.07% (Cremophor EL) or lower (Tween 20, Tween 80: approximately 0.001%).

    "200": "To investigate the biotransformation of metoprolol, a beta1-cardioselective adrenoceptor antagonist, by filamentous fungus, and to compare the parallels between microbial transformation and mammalian metabolism.", 
    "201": "Five strains of Cunninghamella (C elegans AS 3.156, C elegans AS 3.2028, C echinulata AS 3.2004, C blakesleeana AS 3.153 and AS 3.910) were screened for the ability to transform metoprolol. The metabolites of metoprolol produced by C blakesleeana AS 3.153 were separated and assayed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS(n)). The major metabolites were isolated by semipreparative HPLC and the structures were identified by a combination of LC/MS(n) and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis.", 
    "202": "Metoprolol was transformed to 7 metabolites; 2 were identified as new metabolites and 5 were known metabolites in mammals.", 
    "203": "The microbial transformation of metoprolol was similar to the metabolism in mammals. The fungi belonging to Cunninghamella species could be used as complementary models for predicting in vivo metabolism and producing quantities of metabolite references for drugs like metoprolol.", 
    "204": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays an important role in the structural and functional abnormalities of the diabetic heart. We investigated whether or not Ang II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) could attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodeling in male mice with diabetes mellitus (DM) induced by the injection of streptozotocin (200 mg/kg, i.p.). Diabetic mice were treated with candesartan (1 mg/kg/day; DM+Candesartan, n=7) or vehicle (DM+Vehicle, n=7) for 8 weeks. Heart rate and aortic blood pressure were comparable between the groups. Normal systolic function was preserved in diabetic mice. In contrast, diastolic function was impaired in DM+Vehicle and was improved in DM+Candesartan, as assessed by the deceleration time of the peak velocity of transmitral diastolic flow (40.3+/-0.3 vs. 37.3+/-0.5 ms, p<0.01) and the time needed for relaxation of 50% maximal LV pressure to baseline value (tau; 10.6+/-0.7 vs. 8.7+/-0.6 ms, p<0.05) without significant changes in heart rate and aortic blood pressure. Improvement of LV diastolic function was accompanied by the attenuation of myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis and apoptosis in association with the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and myocardial oxidative stress. Moreover, candesartan directly inhibited Ang II-mediated induction of CTGF in cultured cardiac fibroblasts. ARB might be beneficial to prevent cardiac abnormalities in DM.", 
    "205": "This project addresses the validation study design of a test system using a telemetered non-human primate model for cardiovascular safety pharmacology evaluation.", 
    "206": "In addition to non-pharmacological validation including installation and operation qualifications, performance qualification (locomotor activity and cardiovascular evaluations) was completed on free-moving cynomolgus monkeys by quantifying the degree of cardiovascular response measured by the telemetric device to various positive control drugs following their intravenous administration. Remifentanil (0.0005, 0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.008 and 0.016 mg/kg) was given to induce bradycardia and hypotension. Medetomidine (0.04 mg/kg) was used to induce an initial phase of hypertension followed by hypotension and bradycardia. Esmolol (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) was used to induce bradycardia. Dopamine (0.002, 0.008, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03 and 0.05 mg/kg/min) was infused over 30 min to induce an increase in arterial and pulse pressures and tachycardia. Amiodarone (0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg/kg/min) was infused over 10 min to induce QT interval prolongation. Potassium chloride (0.08 mEq/kg/min) was infused for periods of less than 30 min to induce electrocardiographic (EKG) changes characteristic of hyperkalemia. Reliability was evaluated over 60 days.", 
    "207": "Monitoring with a reference methodology and the telemetry system was important in order to evaluate precision and accuracy of the test system. Positive control drugs produced a wide range of cardiovascular effects with different amplitudes, which were useful in identification of the limits of the test system.", 
    "208": "Reference monitoring methods and selection of a battery of positive control drugs are important to ensure proper test system validation. Drugs inducing not only QT prolongation but also positive and negative chronotropic effects, positive and negative systemic arterial pressure changes and ECG morphology alterations were useful to identify test system limitations during performance qualification. ECG data processing at significantly elevated heart rates revealed that a trained observer should review all cardiac cycles evaluated by computer."
