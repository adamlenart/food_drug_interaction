Single injections of 10, 20 or 30 micrograms TsTX induced positive inotropic and chronotropic effects in the majority of the experiments. The inotropic effects were dose-dependent. Simultaneous recording of the electrical activity of the heart showed sinus tachycardia, T wave inversion and ST segment deviations. Sinus bradycardia and/or A-V block were recorded in some experiments, simultaneously with the positive inotropic effects. After these initial events, the larger dose of TsTX elicited periodic changes of heart rate (in 70% of the experiments) which were explained by wandering pacemakers. During these periodic changes in heart rate, the electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, idioventricular rhythm, complete or partial A-V block, sinus tachycardia, sinus arrest and junctional rhythm. The coronary flow varied inversely with the inotropism and the cardiac rate, but the changes in flow were related mainly to the inotropism. The effects of TsTX on the electrocardiogram, inotropism and coronary flow spontaneously disappeared 15-20 min after toxin injection. The arrhythmias induced by TsTX were blocked either by propranolol or by atropine and are assumed to be due to the release of catecholamines and acetylcholine from postganglionic nerve fibers in the heart.", 
    "1": "The effect of electrical stimulation of the cut cervical vagal nerves in dogs on airway resistance and circulating catecholamine concentrations was determined before and after propranolol. Airway resistance increased after 1 min of stimulation and decreased after 9 min of stimulation. The circulating catecholamine levels increased significantly in the pulmonary artery after 1 min of stimulation. After 9 min of stimulation the increase in the femoral artery was relatively more than in the pulmonary artery. This late increase most probably represents catecholamine supply from lung structures.", 
    "2": "The effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) ouabain alone and after pretreatment with i.c.v. (+/-)-propranolol, (+)-propranolol, UM-272 (a quaternary analogue of propranolol) and lignocaine, on arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and cardiac rhythm was investigated in chloralose anesthetized, vagotomized cats. Ouabain elicited an increase in BP and HR followed by cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular origin. Pretreatment with (+/-)-propranolol, (+)-propranolol or UM-272 attenuated/prevented the cardiovascular effects of ouabain whereas lignocaine did not modify the response appreciably. Since UM-272, which lacks local anesthetic activity and beta-blocking activity also shared the antagonism with (+/-)-and (+)-propranolol, it is deduced that neither beta-blocking nor local anesthetic activity of propranolol could be responsible for this antagonism. This is supported by the fact that lignocaine which has a comparable local anesthetic effect of propranolol failed to modify significantly the cardiovascular response to ouabain. The antagonism appears to be a direct neural depressant effect independent of local anesthetic action. The neural depressant effect may be due to an interference in depolarization process and/or a neurone-blocking effect.", 
    "3": "We compared ionized serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) responses to the beta-adrenergic agents, isoproterenol and propranolol, in 14 patients with hyperparathyroidism following renal transplantation and 8 normal volunteers. Following isoproterenol, PTH rose in normal subjects concurrent with a significant (p less than 0.01) fall in ionized but not total, calcium. In the hyperparathyroid patients the PTH concentration decreased (p less than 0.001) coincident with a significant (p less than 0.01) increase in ionized, but not total, calcium. Changes in both PTH (p less than 0.05) and ionized calcium (p less than 0.05) were significantly different in hyperparathyroid patients compared to normal subjects. Propranolol did not affect PTH, ionized or total calcium in either group. We conclude that beta-adrenergic stimulation of PTH secretion may be mediated, in part, by antecedent changes in ionized calcium and not solely a direct effect of the agonist. Concurrent assessment of changes in ionized calcium is necessary for proper interpretation of investigations involving the sympathetic nervous system's regulation of PTH secretion.", 
    "4": "To assess the effect of long-term propranolol therapy on uremic osteodystrophy, we evaluated retrospectively the biochemical, X-ray, and bone histological changes in 9 dialysed hypertensives who had been on propranolol treatment for periods ranging from 1 to 8 years. The control group included 9 well-matched dialysed uremics never treated with beta-blockers. The two groups did not differ in serum ionized calcium or iPTH levels. The incidence of bone resorption evaluated on X-ray findings and on bone biopsy specimens was of a comparable degree in the two groups. Our data show that propranolol even if started early in the course of renal failure, is of no benefit in preventing uremic bone disease.", 
    "5": "Cat adrenal glands were retrogradely perfused in vitro with modified Locke's medium and the mechanism of catecholamine (CA) secretion induced by choline was investigated. Choline-induced secretion of CA was accompanied by release of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, but not by that of phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase, indicating that an exocytotic mechanism is involved in the secretion. Choline failed to induce the secretion of CA when Ca was absent from the perfusion solution. On the other hand, secretion increased when the concentration of Ca2+ in the perfusion medium was raised to 10 mM. Stimulation of secretion by choline was observed from a concentration of 1 mM, and half-maximal secretion occurred at about 10 mM. The stimulatory action was weaker than that of acetylcholine(ACh); the effect of 100 mM choline was approximately equal to that of 0.02 mM ACh. Secretion induced by a low concentration of choline was abolished by a nicotinic blocker, hexamethonium, while the response to choline at a concentration higher than 130 mM was only partially inhibited by cholinergic antagonists. The effects of choline and a low concentration of ACh were additive. On the other hand, 100 mM choline inhibited the response to a supramaximal concentration of ACh(0.5 mM), suggesting that ACh and choline stimulate the same nicotinic receptor. It is concluded that choline acts partially as a nicotinic agonist and that a concentration higher than 130 mM causes secretion by a mechanism additional to nicotinic receptor activation.", 
    "6": "A negative correlation was found in 54 hypertensive overweight patients between the excess body weight and the level of serum inorganic phosphorus. The effect of propranolol upon the serum concentration of phosphorus, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium in 20 of the above mentioned patients as well as in five normal weight, normotensive subjects was studied. After 10 d of treatment with propranolol (160-240 mg/24 h) the concentration of serum phosphate rose from 0.76 +/- 0.02 mmol/l to 0.98 +/- 0.06 mmol/l (P less than 0.02) in the 20 overweight hypertensive patients and remained unchanged in the five control subjects with initial normal phosphate levels. No propranolol induced changes of other serum electrolytes was noted. There is no obvious explanation of the above mentioned findings. An increased uptake of glucose and inorganic phosphate by the enlarged adipose tissue and an impairment of this mechanisms by propranolol might be however suggested.", 
    "7": "The disposition of orally administered propranolol has been studied in twelve patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Each patient received single doses of 40, 80, and 160 mg. Serial blood samples were obtained and quantitated using a sensitive gas chromatographic analytical technique. Ten of the twelve patients received 40 mg doses of propranolol every 6 hours for 5 doses. Blood samples were obtained after administration of the first, second, third, and fifth doses. Substantial intersubject variability in the areas under the bloodconcentration-time profiles (AUC) was observed. Evidence for a nonlinear first-pass effect was not obtained in all patients. The patients displaying a nonlinear relationship between dose and AUC for single propranolol doses consistently showed a similar relationship during multiple dosing. Blood levels obtained following the evening dose (08h00 to 14h00) appeared to be lower than expected based on multiple-dosing pharmacokinetic principles. These findings suggest that monitoring propranolol blood levels is the most viable way to ascertain therapeutic concentrations of this drug.", 
    "8": "Isolated epidermal cells were incubated with a variety of compounds known to interfere with or alter the ultrastructure of cell surface receptors, and the ability of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to bind to these cells and induce epidermal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity was investigated. The alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists, phentolamine and propranolol, and the cholinergic antagonist, atropine, which competed effectively for the binding receptors of [3H]dihydro-alpha-ergocryptine, [3H]dihydroalprenolol, and [14C]acetylcholine, did not inhibit the induction of ODC activity by TPA or the specific binding of [3H]TPA to the cells. Neuraminidase treatments caused a time- and dose-related release of sialic acid from the cells and enhanced the stimulatory effect of cholera toxin on basal and TPA-induced ODC activities as much as the monosialoganglioside GM1. Neuraminidase and the other membrane-altering agents, fucosidase, galactosidase, galactose oxidase, phospholipases A2 and C, and NaIO4, were used alone and/or in various combinations in our studies. All treatments tested inhibited the specific binding of several 125I-labeled hormones and epidermal growth factor to the cells. In contrast, none of these treatments was able, in the same cell system, to affect either the binding or the biological activity of TPA. Therefore, these results suggest that the primary interaction of TPA at the plasma membrane level as well as its biological effect in the intact cell do not proceed through adrenergic or cholinergic receptors and do not require the integrity of the cell surface glycoconjugates and phospholipids. In addition, the inhibitory effect of retinoic acid on TPA-induced ODC activity remained unaffected by some of the above treatments, suggesting that retinoic acid is unlikely to interfere with TPA interactions at the plasma membrane level.", 
    "9": "The aqueous humor formation rate was determined in the anesthetized rabbit with a tracer dilution technique. The anterior chamber was cannulated with two 25-gauge needles: one was inserted into the posterior chamber through the pupil and the other was placed in the anterior chamber near the iridocorneal angle. Fluorescein-dextran solution was infused into the posterior chamber at a constant rate and the aqueous humor was collected through the anterior chamber needle. The aqueous humor formation rate and the volume of dye distribution were calculated simultaneously from the dye dilution curve. Utilizing this technique, the effects of the following substances on aqueous humor formation were studied following topical administration to the conjunctival reservoir: cholinomimetic drugs, pilocarpine and physostigmine; the parasympatholytic drug, atropine; adrenoceptor agonists, norepinephrine, epinephrine, isoproterenol and salbutamol; and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, timolol and propranolol. Cholinomimetic drugs, i.e., pilocarpine 0.1 mg ml-1 to 10 mg ml-1 and physostigmine 1 mg ml-1, increased the aqueous humor formation rate, while atropine 1 mg ml-1 decreased the rate. The increase in aqueous humor formation by the cholinomimetics was completely antagonized with simultaneous administration of atropine. Norepinephrine 5 mg ml-1 and epinephrine 5 mg ml-1 reduced significantly both the aqueous humor formation rate and intraocular pressure (IOP). Isoproterenol 5 mg ml-1 caused a significant lowering of the blood pressure and IOP and tended to lower aqueous humor formation, although the decrease was not statistically significant. No significant effect on the blood pressure, IOP or aqueous humor formation was observed with isoproterenol 2 mg ml-1. Salbutamol 5 mg ml-1 raised the IOP while timolol 1 mg ml-1 lowered the IOP without any significant change in aqueous humor formation or blood pressure. Timolol 0.5 mg ml-1 or propranolol 5 mg ml-1 did not cause a significant effect on the blood pressure, IOP or aqueous humor formation rate.", 
    "10": "Norepinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase enzyme (EC 4.6.1.1.) was histochemically demonstrated by electron microscope in the plasmalemmas of the newborn rat adipocytes. The precipitating agent in the histochemical reaction was cobalt salt. Metoprolol, a selective beta 1-blocker given in vivo abolished almost totally the reaction products from the outer surfaces of the plasmalemmas. In vitro treatment did not yield constantly reproducible results. Prenalterol (H 133/22-CGP 7760/B H\u00e4ssle) a selective beta-agonist given in vivo stimulated enzyme activity in the plasmalemmas. The reaction, however, showed different localization patterns and enhanced amounts of reaction products in the membranes. It is proposed that the histochemical demonstration of amine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the adipocyte plasmalemmas corresponds to the hormonal receptor sites. The question of the sensitivity of the receptors is discussed.", 
    "11": "The involvement of central and peripheral cholinergic structures in the mediation of a centrally induced hyperactive urinary bladder response to L-2,3-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), after peripheral decarboxylase inhibition, registered by a cystometric procedure, has been analysed pharmacologically in anaesthetised rats. The urinary bladder response to L-DOPA was unchanged after blockade of cholinergic receptors with methylscopolamine, diminished after atropine and totally inhibited after hexamethonium. In addition, activation of muscarinic receptors in the pontine-mesencephalic brain region with oxotremorine after methylscopolamine pretreatment generates a hyperactive urinary bladder response, mediation of which seems to be independent of endogenous catecholamine stores. It is suggested that cholinergic receptors in the pontine-mesencephalic brain region are of importance for regulation of urinary bladder function in the rat. Furthermore, the bladder hyperactivity induced by L-DOPA might be propagated via muscarinic receptors in this brain area, and mediated peripherally via cholinergic receptors in the autonomic ganglia, but in the bladder detrusor via non-cholinergic receptors.", 
    "12": "In intact cultured rabbit corneal epithelial cells we have identified [3H]dihydroalprenolol ( [3H]DHA) and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ( [3H]QNB) binding activities which meet criteria for beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. For saturable, propranolol-sensitive [3H]DHA binding, Bmax = 0.374 +/- 0.063 fmol/microgram protein; KDHA = 12.5 +/- 2.4 nM from Scatchard analysis. For saturable, atropine-sensitive [3H]QNB binding, Bmax = 0.403 +/- 0.053 fmol/microgram protein; KQNB = 15.4 +/- 0.7 nM. The order of potency of unlabeled adrenergic agonists in competition for [3H]DHA sites was isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. For unlabeled cholinergic agonists competing for [3H]QNB sites, the order was oxotremorine greater than acetylcholine greater than or equal to carbamylcholine. Acetylcholine did not inhibit [3H]DHA binding, nor did isoproterenol or choline inhibit [3H]QNB binding. Effectiveness of drugs in stimulating cAMP or cGMP accumulation closely paralleled efficacy in competition for [3H]DHA or [3H]QNB sites. Results confirm the presence in intact cultured corneal epithelial cells of beta-adrenergic receptors (demonstrated by others in corneal membrane suspensions), identify in intact cells muscarinic cholinergic receptors (not previously detected in broken cell preparations), and supply evidence for receptor-mediated regulation of cyclic nucleotide levels in these cells, further supporting our hypothesis of bidirectional influence by cAMP-mediated beta-adrenergic and cGMP-mediated cholinergic \"first messengers\" on proliferation during healing of corneal epithelial defects.", 
    "13": "The efficacy and side effects of the new vasodilator carprazidil and the established vasodilator minoxidil were compared in 18 hypertensive patients inadequately controlled by 2 to 4 conventional drugs; the latter included diuretics, beta-blockers and/or sympatholytics and, in half the cases, vasodilators, such as hydralazine, diazoxide or the postsynaptic alpha-blocker prazosin. The vasodilators were withdrawn and, using a crossover design all patients received carprazidil (mean final dose 88 mg) and minoxidil (20 mg) for an average period of 5 to 6 months. The effects of the 2 agents appeared to be qualitatively and quantitatively similar. Both tended to cause sodium retention and an increase in heart rate, which required an increased dose of diuretic in one third of the cases or of a beta-blocker in a quarter. With this approach mean body weight and blood volume were not altered in the established phase of carprazidil or minoxidil treatment; heart rate and plasma norepinephrine tended to be only minimally increased, plasma renin was slightly increased, and plasma aldosterone and epinephrine were largely unchanged. Supine and upright blood pressure were reduced from initial values of 189/113 and 167/ 113 mm Hg, to 149/95 and 138/95 mm Hg (-18 and - 17%), respectively, during carprazidil, and to 154/95 and 141/96 mm Hg (-17 and - 15%) during minoxidil therapy. Hypertrichosis occurred with both agents in almost all patients, and limits their more prolonged use in females. No adverse side effects on haematological parameters, liver or renal function were observed, nor was antinuclear antibody detected. It is concluded that carprazidil and minoxidil are equivalent vasodilator agents in the treatment of severe hypertension, particularly in males.", 
    "14": "The present experiments were designed to elucidate the pharmacological mechanism of the relaxing action of the ovarian hormone, relaxin, upon KCl-contracted rat uteri in vitro. Rat uterine segments were made to contract by superfusion with a physiological solution, in which 15% of the normal NaCl content had been replaced by an equimolar amount of KCl. The effect of relaxin, in reversing this contraction, was achieved in part by a direct action upon the tissue and in part (about 45% at the concentration of relaxin used) by the liberation of endogenous catecholamines which relax the uterus via beta-adrenergic activity. The effect of relaxin was reduced by propranolol, and it was not blocked by indomethacin, cimetidine or diphenhydramine. The effect of the ovarian peptide on uterine segments was potentiated in the presence of theophylline and indomethacin in the superfusing fluid. This effect of theophylline was shown to be insensitive to beta-adrenergic blockade. The results suggest that relaxin relaxes the KCl-contracted rat uterus in part by a direct inhibitory action upon the uterine muscle and in part by facilitating the release of intramural catecholamines. It is also suggested that relaxin may act via the production of cyclic AMP.", 
    "15": "Labetalol, a combined alpha and beta adrenoceptor blocking drug, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of hypertensive crises when given intravenously. It also offers the advantage that treatment can be continued with the oral preparation. The purpose of our study was to evaluate if the administration of an intravenous bolus followed by an iv infusion and subsequently by the oral preparation might increase the efficacy of the drug without reducing its tolerance. Thirteen patients with severe essential hypertension and one with pheochromocytoma were treated during one or more hypertensive crises with Labetalol, 100 mg bolus i.v. injection in two minutes, followed by an intravenous infusion (2-4 mg/min for 60-90 minutes) and, one hour after the end of the infusion, by the oral preparation (200 mg t.i.d.). In 11 subjects with essential hypertension and in the patient with pheochromocytoma a 30% fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure [from 240 +/- 10/155 +/- 6 mmHg (mean +/- 1 s.e.m.), to 162 +/- 8/111 +/- 6, p less than 0.01] was achieved within five minutes from the beginning of the treatment. Blood pressure remained well controlled thereafter, throughout the infusion period and during the first 24 hours of the oral administration. Heart rate fell simultaneously with the fall in blood pressure. Only in one patient blood pressure was not adequately controlled despite of the bolus and of an infusion at the rate of 4 mg/min for 20 minutes. In another case the fall in pressure caused near-fainting and the infusion was therefore not started. No other side effects were encountered except for transient orthostatic hypotension. We conclude that the administration of a bolus plus infusion of Labetalol is more effective than single or repeated boluses or graded infusions and it is equally well tolerated.", 
    "16": "Beta adrenergic blocking agents are widely used in the treatment of hypertension. Recent findings indicate that long-term physical training also could reduce elevated blood pressure and many physicians therefore recommend their patients to include physical training in their everyday program. However, it is not known whether a combination of beta blockade and physical training influences the responses of an organism to physical training. This problem was investigated using laboratory rats as an experimental animal model. Both swimming and running training were used, and a group of animals was trained without any medication while the other group performed their daily training session under the influence of 10 mg/kg of propranolol. Some of the effects produced by swimming training, such as hypertrophy of brown adipose tissue and heart muscle, resting bradycardia, increased tachycardic and tail skin temperature responses to isoprenaline, increased calorigenic response to noradrenaline and delayed cooling rate in cold water were similar to those produced by cold acclimation or repeated noradrenaline injections. It is thus tempting to conclude that the training-induced release of noradrenaline was responsible for the changes mentioned. Propranolol, when associated with the training, effectively hampered these changes. Running training increased the activity of oxidative enzymes in the skeletal muscle much more than did swimming training or repeated noradrenaline injections. Furthermore, running training neither induced hypertrophy of the brown fat nor enhanced calorigenic response to noradrenaline; it even led to enhanced rate of body cooling in cold water. Therefore the adaptive changes caused by running training most probably are not due to cold acclimation effects in spite of that propranolol, when associated with the running sessions, antagonized the development of running-induced changes, too. Some of these changes, such as cardiomegaly, training bradycardia and elevated aerobic capacity, are often used as measures of physical fitness. Assuming that the purpose of physical training is to increase physical fitness, then a combination of beta blockade with training does not serve the purpose.", 
    "17": "Arteria coronaris sinistra of female rats, Wistar strain, was ligated for 10 min. All successfully operated animals were decapitated at 96th h after the intervention. The serial histological heart slices to full coverage of the myocardial lesion revealed intramural infarctions in both the control and experimental rats, the former having been subjected to only a 10 min occlusion of the coronary artery and the latter having been treated with Propranolol or Dipyridamole. The myocardial lesions were invisible to the naked eye. They consisted of a necrotic center and a large reactive zone of mononuclear cells. The severity of the experimental disease was expressed by indices of myocardial lesions, based on the objective estimation of the infarct dimension. Propranolol (20 mg/kg, ip) or Dipyridamol (20 mg/kg, ip) applied to rats with induced myocardial infarction minished significantly the indice, of myocardial lesion. The high correlation coefficients of this indication, calculated at intervals between the slices of 0.1 to 0.4 mm, allowed the indices to be determined by a smaller number of slices-thus the work is being simplified. Graphic illustration of the transversal infarct areas along the longitudinal axis of the heart permitted to trace the topography of the drug's pharmacological action.", 
    "18": "In an open multi-centre study, 51 patients with mild to moderate hypertension were treated with either a single dose of 40 mg penbutolol per day for 8 weeks or changed over at 4 weeks due to inadequate response with penbutolol alone to a single dose (1 tablet) of a fixed combination of 40 mg penbutolol and 20 mg furosemide per day for a further 4 weeks. Thirty-six (70%) of the patients showed an adequate reduction in diastolic blood pressure to 95 mmHg or less on penbutolol alone. Of the 15 patients who did not show the desired response to penbutolol alone, 13 (86.7%) showed a satisfactory reduction in blood pressure after 4 weeks on the combination product; 2 of these patients had received 1 tablet twice daily from Week 6 of treatment. Two other patients received 1 tablet of the combination twice daily from Week 8 onwards for 2 weeks. Only 1 of them did not respond to this therapy. Blood pressure reduction and weight loss were significantly greater on the combination product than on penbutolol alone. No clinically significant changes were noted in serum potassium, glucose, creatinine or uric acid levels, and mild gastric side-effects at the beginning of treatment were reported in only 3 patients, 1 of whom was also receiving indomethacin.", 
    "19": "Maintenance effect of topical timolol was investigated for 2 years in a group of 125 glaucomatous and ocular hypertensive patients (231 eyes) who had been successfully treated with timolol alone during a 6-month period preceding this trial. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was controlled with timolol alone in 135 of 183 eyes (74%) that completed the study. At the end of the trial 142 eyes (78%) showed an IOP of less than 22 mmHg. Other glaucoma medication had to be added to timolol treatment in 18% of ocular hypertensive and 35% of glaucomatous eyes because of IOP elevation. Elevation of IOP seemed to be due to worsening of glaucoma rather than to decreased efficacy of timolol. None of the ocular hypertensive patients developed visual field defects but in ten glaucomatous patients progression of existing visual field defects was observed in association with elevated IOP. Transient adverse effects were observed in 13% of cases, but timolol treatment had to be stopped in only five cases (4%) because of side effects.", 
    "20": "The effect of intravenous infusion of labetalol and of dihydralazine in increasing doses was compared in 12 women with severe hypertension in pregnancy. In 5 our of 6 women labetalol produced a smooth, progressive fall in blood pressure to normal levels with minimal side effects. In 2 our of 6 women on dihydralazine the blood pressure control was satisfactory but in the remaining 4 patients treatment had to by discontinued because of unpredictable, sudden falls in blood pressure. One of the 6 infants of mothers treated with labetalol manifested signs of adrenergic blockade. Continuous infusion of labetalol appears to offer significant advantages in the management of severe hypertension in pregnancy and merits further trial.", 
    "21": "The aim of the present paper is to verify the diagnostic potentialities of frequent atrial stimulations during functional autonomous block. 31 patients (15 males and 16 females) aged 36-65 years were examined. The diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) was made according to history data, clinical manifestations of the disease, and ECG data of SSS. All the patients underwent the electrophysiologic study (EPS) in which sinus nodal recovery time and corrected sinus nodal recovery time were determined before and after the functional autonomous block. All the patients were divided into 6 groups according to the findings. This trial was found to increase the diagnostic potential of EPS in the diagnosis of SSS.", 
    "22": "Effect of propranolol on perceived exertion soon after myocardial revascularization surgery. Med. Sci. Sports Exercise. Vol. 14, No. 4, pp. 276-280, 1982. This study evaluated the effects of propranolol on ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate (HR), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) during graded exercise testing of myocardial revascularization surgery patients before hospital discharge. Eighty-six men performed a symptom-limited, graded exercise test on a treadmill an average of 11 d after surgery. Patients were assigned to three groups: those not taking propranolol (no-propranolol group, N = 54), those taking propranolol (propranolol group, N = 22), and those exhibiting exertional hypotension during testing (hypotensive group, N = 10). Test results showed that estimated METs during peak exercise were similar for the three groups. The propranolol group demonstrated a lower HR for submaximal and peak exercise when compared with the no-propranolol group, but RPE was the same for matched exercise intensities. The hypotensive group failed to increase SBP during exercise, but perceived the matched exercise intensities to be the same as the other two groups. The HR response of the hypotensive group was similar to that of the no-propranolol group. Thus, an abnormal SBP response during exercise was not reflected in a changed RPE when compared with patients who increased SBP appropriately. It was concluded that propranolol does not affect RPE during graded exercise testing soon after cardiac surgery.", 
    "23": "Disappearance pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and general tolerance of i.v. timolol were compared in 12 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with a definite or proven acute myocardial infarction. The drug was administered to the patients immediately on arrival at the hospital after a median delay time of 4 h. Tolerance to the injections was good in both volunteers and patients. The study revealed disappearance pharmacokinetics that were similar in volunteers and patients.", 
    "24": "An open, observer-blind, therapeutic titration trial was carried out in 28 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension to determine the effective dose range of nadolol given once a day. 11 patients became normotensive (supine diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or below) with 80 mg, 4 with 120 mg and 1 with 160 mg. The largest step in the reduction of blood pressure was achieved with the first dose step of 80 mg, and only a small, nonsignificant further decrease was obtained with higher dose levels. Thus, nadolol, unlike propranolol, has a narrow effective dose range, and this should permit a brief dose adjustment period, which would be important in improving patient compliance.", 
    "25": "Oxygen consumption was measured in 500 patients (151 F, 349 M, ages 12-84 yr.) undergoing routine cardiac catheterization. Sex, age, and heart rate were found to be the strongest predictors of oxygen consumption index (OCI). Males had higher OCI values than females at any age. Older patients of both sexes had lower OCI values than younger patients. Heart rate correlated directly with OCI. Treatment with propranolol correlated inversely with OCI. However, after correction for heart rate, there were no significant differences in OCI values between propranolol treated and nontreated patients. A linear regression equation was developed using combinations of variables to predict OCI, and tables are presented for predicting OCI in those patients in whom this variable cannot be directly measured.", 
    "26": "Contractile responses were analyzed in the rat paced left atrium. Positive inotropic effects were papaverine dose-dependent with an increase in rate of tension development (dT/dt) and time to peak tension, with prolongation in the total duration of contraction. Reserpinized preparations did not modify papaverine response but several treatments inhibited it, i.e., either doubling or halving [Ca2+]0, as well as the addition of D-propranolol. Incubation of tissues with papaverine (1 hr) changed the usual dose-response curve to isoproterenol into a low, monotonous effect, independent of the agonist dose. Neither high nor low [Ca2+]0 could correct this action. D-propranolol restored the isoproterenol response but significantly blocked it. Under the same conditions, phenylephrine showed similar qualitative effects as above, though no significant differences were found in control vs. the various procedures tested. These results strongly suggest that papaverine provokes an initial calcium release followed by a sustained inhibition. In addition its site of action is the same as that of D-propranolol.", 
    "27": "A subspecialty clinic was established in a large city hospital in order to evaluate and treat patients with chest pain syndromes and to assess the relative efficiency of isosorbide dinitrate and propranolol in the treatment of angina pectoris. The intensive subspecialty approach proved superior to the standard evaluation and treatment that these patients received in the general medicine clinics. Almost 50 percent of referred patients with the diagnosis of longstanding angina pectoris did not have this disease. Of the patients with chest pain due to coronary artery disease, the clinic provided an expedient, efficient, and effective means of evaluation and treatment. Isosorbide dinitrate was shown to be as effective an antianginal drug as propranolol.", 
    "28": "The present study examines the hypothesis that vagal activity can accelerate the onset of cardiac arrest produced by administering a beta-adrenergic blocking dose of propranolol to digitoxin-intoxicated dogs. In 11 experiments, intravenous injection of 0.75 mg/kg propranolol into digitoxin intoxicated dogs induced a sustained ventricular asystole (early-phase cardiac arrest). In six of these eleven experiments, intermittent pacing of the ventricles for as long as 150 min to maintain blood pressure after the onset of asystole, led to the resumption of spontaneous heart beats in only one dog. In five other experiments, injection of atropine (1 mg/kg) three min after the onset of early-phase cardiac arrest elicited sustained spontaneous junctional rhythms. In another four experiments the injection of atropine prior to or simultaneously with propranolol prevented the occurrence of asystole and caused the emergence of a junctional pacemaker. In eight experiments in which the cardiac arrest was reversed or prevented, injection of maintenance doses of atropine and propranolol caused eventual failure of the junctional pacemaker (late-phase cardiac arrest). This failure could not be prevented or reversed by atropine. The results suggest that early-phase cardiac arrest is due to vagal suppression of cardiac pacemakers and therefore supports the above hypothesis.", 
    "29": "Twenty-nine dogs having undergone aseptic excision of the sinoatrial node were kept under observation, in most cases, for more than a year. Observation confirmed the instability of the new rhythm or rhythms taking over the automaticity after excision of the physiological pacemaker. This instability was particularly marked during the first ten days following surgery. The new pacemaking sites were mainly junctional. Spontaneous pauses occurred. Later on, in more than 50% of the cases, pacemaker sites became localized in the high zone of the atrium, and the rhythm was of sinus node origin. Through the evolution, rhythm disorders were observed as sequences of bradycardia, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and flutter. Unexcised nodal cells were found in three animals, through their presence did not make any significant difference to their ECGs as compared with animals in which removal of nodal cells was complete. Surgical implantation of electrodes enabled a study to be made of recovery time, which was always well within physiological limits, but was particularly long during the ten days following surgery. The values varied greatly from one examination to another. Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) aggravated the disorders and lengthened corrected recovery time; atropine had varying effects. An analogy is apparent between the disorders described here and those observed in man in the sick sinus syndrome.", 
    "30": "Increased metabolism of pindolol in renal impairment has previously been suggested by pharmacokinetic calculations. The present study was a pharmacokinetic and metabolic investigation in 7 patients with severe renal impairment (endogeneous creatinine clearance below 5 ml/min). All the patients received pindolol 5 mg t.d.s. 5 days. On the sixth day, after an overnight fast, 14C-pindolol 5 mg was given orally as a solution to drink. Blood samples were taken for up to 72 h and urine was collected at intervals up to 96 h for measurement of unchanged pindolol by a fluorimetric method and total radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Metabolites in blood and urine were analysed after separation by HPLC. It was found that the plasma levels following a single dose of 14C-pindolol were similar to those observed in healthy volunteers, but the elimination half-life was slightly increased u tp 11.5 h. The observed steady state plasma concentrations of pindolol were twice as high but they are still in the therapeutic range of 10 to 100 ng/ml. Therefore, the dose of pindolol could have been reduced by a factor 2, but the reduction was not essential. No active metabolite of pindolol was found in plasma or urine, but elimination of the metabolites was decreased. The elimination half-life following multiple doses was prolonged compared to normal and it was quite comparable to that found fort pharmacodynamic half-life in renal patients. The discrepancy between the present findings and the previous results for metabolism and pharmacodynamic half-life was probably due to the sensitivity of the fluorimetric assay of pindolol.", 
    "31": "Fifteen elderly patients whose hypertension was controlled by conventional propranolol 80 mg twice a day had their medication changed to one capsule of 'Inderal' LA (160 mg) daily. The blood pressure, heart rate and propranolol concentrations were measured at various time points when the patients were receiving the conventional preparation and these assessments were repeated when the long-acting preparation was administered. Although the heart rate was lower with conventional propranolol than with 'Inderal' LA there was no significant difference in the blood pressure levels. The mean peak blood level of propranolol was, however, significantly lower with 'Inderal' LA compared with conventional propranolol and occurred later. At 12 h the plasma propranolol levels were higher after 'Inderal' LA then following the intake of conventional propranolol (p less than 0.01); there was no difference in the plasma levels at 24 h. The area under the concentration time curve was significantly higher on conventional propranolol. Compared with published data, the plasma levels were higher than those in younger patients. 'Inderal' LA was well tolerated and side effects were minimal.", 
    "32": "Factors determining vascular resistance were examined in 6 normotensive subjects (NT), 5 with established hypertension (EH) and diastolic pressures greater than 90 mmHg and 7 with borderline hypertension (BH) having pressures intermittently greater than 140/90 mmHg. Using plethysmography, we measured forearm blood flow (FBF), arterial resistance (FAR) and venous compliance (FVC) before and after autonomic blockade with propranolol 0.2 mg/kh, atropine 0.04 mg/kg and phentolamine 15 mg I.V. Subjects with EH had the highest baseline FBF. MAP was increased 18-22% after atropine and propranolol in all 3 groups. Phentolamine decreased MAP -8.9 +/- 2.1% in NT, -6.9 +/-1.2% in BH and -16.5 +/- 1.9% in EH (p less than 0.05). After total blockade, FAR in EH (32.4 +/- 4.8 units) was similar to FAR in TN (31.0 +/- 3.6 units) whereas that in BH remained high (50.2 +/- 3.8 units; p less than 0.01). Baseline FVC was highest in NT, intermediate in BH and lowest in EH and was not altered by autonomic blockade. Non-gravitational exercise for 6 min during upper arm arterial occlusion after autonomic blockade resulted in a residual FAR of 2.3 +/- 0.1 units in NT, 3.8 +/- 0.3 units in BH and 4.2 +/- 1.7 units in EH (p less than 0.01) during reactive hyperemia. Increased FAR in our subjects with BH and EH was probably due to structural vascular alterations. The greater increase in FAR and MAP in EH over that observed in BH has a sympathetic nervous system component.", 
    "33": "Basal hemodynamics and plasma catecholamines were measured in 10 patients with systolic hypertension, 7 males and 3 females, aged 38-69 years (Group 1), and in 10 patients with systolic and diastolic hypertension, 7 males and 3 females, aged 40-65 years (Group 2); the same measurements were repeated after acute pharmacological alpha and beta-blockade with Labetalol, 100 mg iv, or Propranolol, 10 mg iv, plus Phentolamine, 10 mg iv. In patients of Group 1 plasma noradrenaline was inversely related to systolic arterial pressure and to stroke index and was directly related to heart rate. In patients of Group 2 plasma noradrenaline was directly related to systolic arterial pressure. After acute alpha and beta-blockade the degree of reduction of systolic arterial pressure was directly related to basal plasma noradrenaline in both groups; systolic arterial pressure was reduced to normotensive levels in 5 patients of Group 1 who had high basal plasma noradrenaline values. These results confirm some of our previous findings and suggest that in some patients with systolic hypertension adrenergic activity is increased and may have a significant role in maintaining high blood pressure values.", 
    "34": "Aortic rigidity, plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline, and hemodynamic parameters were measured in 48 essential hypertensive patients, 25 younger than 45 (Group I) and 23 of 45 years and over (Group II). Aortic rigidity was determined by the ratio of pulse pressure over stroke volume. Aortic rigidity and hemodynamic parameters were also determined after combined alpha-beta receptor blockade induced by Labetalol (mg 100 IV) or by Propranolol (mg 10 IV) plus Phentolamine (mg 10 IV). The aortic rigidity index was significantly higher in Group II, systolic arterial pressure being significantly higher. All other data, including plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline, were not significantly different in the two groups. In Group II a significant correlation (r = 0.62) was noted between aortic rigidity indexes and plasma noradrenaline values. The alpha-beta receptor blockade induced a decrease of aortic rigidity particularly in Group II, owing to a more marked decrease of systolic arterial pressure. A highly significant correlation was noted in Group II between the changes in aortic rigidity index and the basal plasma noradrenaline levels (r = 0.81). Therefore, the aortic rigidity in essential hypertensive patients older than 45 is influenced by the sympathetic nervous system activity, as judged by plasma noradrenaline levels. This influence seems related to an increase with age of aortic responsiveness to sympathetic stimulation.", 
    "35": "A patient with glaucoma simplex and chronic pulmonary obstruction was treated with the non-selective beta-adrenergic blocking agent timolol in ophthalmic solution of 0.25% for 11/2 years, when he had daily asthma attacks. In a provocation test, forced expiratory volume in the first second was reduced by 56% and bradycardia was induced after application of two drops of timolol eyedrops 0.25%. The severe systemic side-effects of timolol, when used as eyedrops, are related to the liver bypass and perhaps to the fast absorption from the cornea. It is suggested that when timolol ophthalmic solution is given for the first time to glaucoma patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, they should be observed for one hour with special reference to difficulty in breathing.", 
    "36": "The effectiveness of metoprolol in achieving blood pressure control was studied in 16 hypertensive adolescents. The hypertensive included two insulin dependent diabetics, four patients with renal disease, and ten adolescents with essential hypertension. Dose range was 100-200 mg/day for 3-12 months. Significant reductions on metoprolol therapy were achieved for systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P less than 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (P less than 0.001), and heart rate (HR) (P less than 0.001). Side effects that had been present in previous therapy were absent. On metoprolol therapy the hyperkinetic cardiovascular response to mental stress was improved for SBP and HR. Exercise stress testing also resulted in a reduced SBP and HR, while endurance capacity was unimpaired. Metoprolol is effective in adolescent hypertension with negligible side effects.", 
    "37": "Positive inotropic responses, measured as increases in the maximum derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt), were induced by carotid artery occlusion (CAR), intravenous norepinephrine (NOR), or intravenous isoproterenol (ISO) in the canine heart in vivo. NOR and ISO also increased peak ascending flow velocity (V max). ISO increased heart rat (HR), while NOR and CAR produced comparatively little chronotropic response. Phentolamine (1 mg/kg) considerably reduced induced increases in dP/dt, Vmax and HR, while the same dose of propranolol almost completely abolished such increases. The results indicate that phentolamine, and alpha-adrenergic blocking drug, does have and ability to partially block induced positive inotropic responses in the canine heart, and perhaps chronotropic responses as well, although propranolol, a beta-blocker, is more effective. the results are in accord with the view that the principal cardiac adrenergic receptors are not adequately described either as classical beta- or alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "38": "The elimination of pindolol was studied in 32 patients suffering from various liver diseases, mainly acute hepatitis and hepatic cirrhosis. The total body clearance of antipyrine was measured simultaneously as a parameter of liver microsomal enzyme activity. The doses given were antipyrine 1000 mg orally and pindolol 3 mg i.v. Plasma samples were taken and urine was collected for up to 72 h for the measurement of drug concentrations. In addition, conventional biochemical laboratory tests were done. The total body clearance of antipyrine was compared with the pharmacokinetic parameters calculated for pindolol, and the results of the biochemical tests. No correlation was found between antipyrine clearance and the routine biochemical parameters in liver disease or with the total body clearance of pindolol. A significant correlation was seen with the nonrenal clearance of pindolol taken as representing its major metabolic degradation. Higher correlation coefficients were observed when two subgroups of patients with acute hepatitis and hepatic cirrhosis were separated. In some patients suffering from hepatic cirrhosis a higher urinary excretion of unchanged pindolol was observed as liver function become decompensated, a finding due to an unknown mechanism but based on intact renal function. In patients with acute hepatitis a much higher nonrenal clearance was found than in many other patients, which might be based on increased liver blood flow.", 
    "39": "A double-blind randomized Norwegian multi-centre study was carried out to compare the effect of timolol (10 mg twice daily) with that of placebo in patients, age between 20 and 75 years, surviving acute myocardial infarction. The patients were followed for 12 to 33 months (mean 17 months). There was a significant reduction in mortality and re-infarction in the patients treated with timolol. Results from the age group 65 to 75 years are analyzed in more detail in this study. Of the 1884 patients included in the main trial, 732 were between 65 and 75 years of age (348 taking timolol and 384 placebo). When analyzing all randomized patients in this elderly group, there were 83 deaths in the placebo group and 52 deaths in the timolol group (p = 0.03). During treatment or within 28 days of withdrawal, there were 62 deaths in the placebo group and 36 in the timolol group (p = 0.07). There were 69 first re-infarctions in the placebo group and 33 in the timolol group (p = 0.004). It is concluded that long-term treatment with timolol in patients aged 65 to 75 years surviving acute myocardial infarction reduces mortality and the rate of re-infarction.", 
    "40": "1 The effect on plasma lipids of pindolol given orally over a 6 month period to 20 patients with essential hypertension was studied. 2 During therapy an adipose tissue biopsy was taken from nine patients for the determination of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and serum samples were taken for lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) assays. An additional biopsy and serum samples were taken after a 3 weeks' break in pindolol treatment. 3 Plasma free fatty acid and triglyceride concentrations remained similar during treatment. 4 Plasma total cholesterol was slightly lower (P less than 0.05) at 6 months than at 1 month. 5 HDL cholesterol concentration and the ratio of HDL to total cholesterol increased slightly, and the increase of HDL-cholesterol was significant (P less than 0.05) at 1 month. 6 LCAT activity was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) during pindolol treatment than after the break in it. No significant changes in adipose tissue LPL activities were found before and after the break of treatment.", 
    "41": "1 The effects of two beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, pindolol and metoprolol, on plasma lipids and lipoproteins were studied in sixteen hypertensive patients (WHO I-I) by a cross-over design, with two active treatment periods of 12 weeks each. 2 Neither pindolol nor metoprolol had any effect on total plasma cholesterol (total-C), triglycerides (TG) or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). 3 Pindolol significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). After metoprolol, HDL-C levels remained similar to those in the placebo period. 4 The ratio of total-C to HDL-C was significantly reduced by pindolol only. 5 Compared with the placebo period, both pindolol and metoprolol significantly reduced heart rate (HR) and systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure. The decreases in HR were significantly greater after metoprolol. No differences between the effects of the two drugs on SBP and/or DBP were observed.", 
    "42": "1 The influence of equipotent cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blocking doses of pindolol (10 mg daily) and metoprolol (200 mg daily) was studied in ten healthy male subjects. 2 The subjects were studied at rest and during exercise before and after 3 days' treatment with pindolol or metoprolol. 3 At rest and during exercise, there were no significant differences in the blood glucose levels between the metoprolol and pindolol treatments when compared with control values.", 
    "43": "1 In an open controlled study a group of 18 healthy volunteers received either pindolol 10 mg three times daily or metoprolol 100 mg three times daily for 4 weeks. Before treatment, and after abrupt withdrawal the resting heart rate, the blood pressure, the exercise heart rate and the isoprenaline CD25 (dose of isoprenaline to increase the heart rate of 25 beats/min) were determined. Heart rates were continuously monitored by an ECG-coupled computer. The CD25 values were calculated by an off line computer procedure from the on line recorded data. 2 After metoprolol we found 6 out of 12 patients with a CD25 below baseline, in one case with a corresponding increase in heart rate during exercise. After pindolol we observed a CD25 below baseline only in one case with no corresponding reaction in the exercise test. In both groups we observed a reactive increase in resting heart rate and systolic blood pressure around day 5 after withdrawal. 3 We conclude that abrupt withdrawal of metoprolol in contrast to pindolol is associated with a higher risk of developing beta-adrenergic receptor hypersensitivity.", 
    "44": "1 The study was designed to elucidate further the mechanism by which beta-adrenoceptor antagonism with pindolol relieves the symptoms of angina pectoris in patients with coronary heart disease. 2 Pindolol administration was associated with an elevated threshold for angina pectoris and improved myocardial lactate metabolism during supraventricular pacing. 3 This beneficial effect of pindolol was independent of changes in myocardial blood flow and was not mediated by haemodynamic effects. 4 The results suggest that in angina pectoris, in addition to the recognized beneficial effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockade, the actions of pindolol also result from, as yet, poorly described phenomena such as redistribution of myocardial blood flow or metabolic effects.", 
    "45": "1 In a double-blind study, 36 patients with essential hypertension were randomly allocated to treatment with either metoprolol, 100--300 mg/day, or pindolol, 5--15 mg/day for 6 months. Haemodynamic investigations were made on three separate occasions. Blood flow in the calves and in the forearm was determined by venous occlusion plethysmography after 6 weeks of placebo, after 6 weeks and again after 6 months of active therapy. 2 Both drugs reduced blood pressure significantly, by 17.1/11.8 mm Hg with metoprolol and 21.9/10.9 mm Hg with pindolol after 6 weeks (P less than 0.005). No further changes were seen after 6 months. 3 Heart rate after 6 weeks was significantly reduced by metoprolol (10.7 +/- 2.4 beats/min, P less than 0.001) but not by pindolol (4.4 +/- 2.3 beats/min, NS). After 6 months a significant reduction was seen also in the pindolol group (5.2 +/- 2.1 beats/min, P less than 0.05). 4 The vascular resistance in the calves at rest was reduced by pindolol (P less than 0.05), whereas resistance tended to increase with metoprolol. 5 Resting vascular resistance in the forearm after 6 months was significantly reduced in the metoprolol group (P less than 0.001) as well as in the pindolol group (P less than 0.02). The increase in forearm vascular resistance seen during leg exercise was not influenced by either drug. 6 Vascular resistance at maximal vasodilatation was unchanged in the calves, but a significant reduction (-17.4 +/- 5.7%, P less than 0.01) in the forearm vascular bed was seen after 6 months of pindolol. No change was observed with metoprolol. 7 It is concluded that pindolol reduces elevated blood pressure partly through peripheral vascular mechanism. Metoprolol, on the other hand, probably acts mainly via central cardiac mechanisms.", 
    "46": "1 Pindolol and propranolol were administered orally in equipotent antihypertensive doses to 14 subjects with mild to moderate hypertension in an open cross-over study. 2 Pindolol caused a smaller decrease in plasma renin activity and heart rate than propranolol. 3 Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow remained unchanged during therapy with either agent.", 
    "47": "1 In an acute study in hypertensive patients with normal and decreased renal function the i.v. administration of pindolol (0.1 mg/kg) caused a decrease in inulin clearance and a concomitant but not significant decrease in PAH clearance with a constant filtration fraction. 2 The long-term administration of pindolol (5--20 mg/day) to hypertensive patients with normal renal function was not associated with changes in renal function but in patients with a decreased renal function, pindolol caused an increase in PAH clearance but no change in inulin clearance.", 
    "48": "1 Steady state concentrations and clearance of lignocaine were determine in eight healthy volunteers during 360 min continuous lignocaine infusion (2 mg/min). Before the infusion propranolol (0.18 mg/kg i.v.), pindolol (0.023 mg/kg i.v.) or placebo were administered in a random double-blind, cross over design. 2 During the infusion of lignocaine heart rate, cardiac output and arterial blood pressure were measured every 60 min. 3 Propranolol decreased heart rate and cardiac output significantly by 10--20%, while pindolol or lignocaine did not change cardiac output or heart rate significantly. None of the drugs changed the arterial blood pressure. 4 Propranolol pretreatment decreased lignocaine significantly by 14.7% and the steady state concentration was increased by 22.5%. Pindolol produced no significant change in steady state concentration or clearance of lignocaine.", 
    "49": "1 Pharmacokinetic investigations were carried out in a group of 32 ambulant normal male volunteers in order to determine the effect of age and smoking on steady-state plasma levels of pindolol and propranolol. There were four groups of 8: young non-smokers (YNS), young smokers (YS), old non-smokers (ONS) and old smokers (OS). Each subject received, in a randomized cross-over sequence, 5 mg pindolol and 80 mg propranolol three times daily for 2 days with an interval of at least 14 days between the two treatment periods. 2 Neither age nor smoking was shown to have any influence on the time to reach a peak plasma level after pindolol or propranolol. Age, on the other hand, significantly increased the peak plasma levels and the areas under the plasma concentration time curves, and decreased the elimination rate constants, the differences between the age groups being more pronounced for propranolol than for pindolol. No effect of smoking on these parameters was observed. 3 Differences were found between pindolol and propranolol in respect of time to reach a peak plasma level, peak plasma levels and area under the plasma concentration time curves in the groups ONS and YS when related to the YNS control group. Changes observed (with the exception of the time to reach a peak level) tended to be less for pindolol and were considered to be of little clinical relevance.", 
    "50": "This report concerns two pheochromocytomas of renal vasculary pedicle. Diagnosis is made on clinical features and urinary vanylmandelic acid excretion rate. Localisation is made by arteriography. In one case, there is a renal artery compression, and in the other the tumor is vascularised by lombar artery with hypoplasic ipsilateral kidney. These two cases stress the problem of the respective responsibility of both pheochromocytoma and renovascular disease in hypertension genesis. Beside the clinical and biological context pre-operatively, the sulpiride and propranolol tests may have a discrimination value. Excision of the tumor afforded complete relief of symptoms, the two patients remained normotensive three years later.", 
    "51": "Systolic time intervals, the pre-ejection period (PEP), left ventricular ejection time (LVET) and PEP/LVET ratio were studied in ten thyrotoxic and ten hypothyroid patients. LVET and PEP intervals were corrected for heart rate (LVETc and PEPc). The measurements were repeated after 1-28 months when the patients were euthyroid following appropriate therapy. Compared with the euthyroid values, the PEPc intervals and PEP/LVET ratios were significantly decreased (p less than 0.01) in the thyrotoxic and increased (p less than 0.001) in the hypothyroid patients. In both groups the LVETc intervals were significantly prolonged (p less than 0.001). In four of the hypothyroid patients the PEP/LVET ratios were markedly increased (above 0.60, mean 0.66), and above 0.41 in the euthyroid state (reference value 0.35 +/- 0.05). In the other hypothyroid patients and in thyrotoxic patients the euthyroid PEP/LVET ratios were within the reference values. The systolic time intervals were not influenced by propranolol therapy in the thyrotoxic patients. Our results suggest increased myocardial contractility unaffected by adrenergic blockade in thyrotoxicosis, and reduced contractility in hypothyroidism.", 
    "52": "Viskaldix, a combination of Pindolol (Visken)--10 mg with Clopamide--5 mg, was administered to 15 patients with arterial hypertension. The follow up of the patients was according to a previous plan, the preparation administered according, to a schedule. In the determination of the stage of the disease, consideration was mainly given to the values of the diastolic pressure, measured in a lying position. The patients examined were of the following age: to 40--I patient; to 50-7 patients; to 60--7 patients. Seven patients were at the stage I, 4 patients--stage OII and 4 patients--stage III. Reduction of systolic and diastolic pressure with more than 1.33 kPa (10 mm Hg column) both in a lying and standing position were recorded in 2/3 of the patients with the treatment carried out. The effect on the blood pressure, was noticed to develop in 1/3 of the patients with the administration of 2 tablets daily. The blood pressure of only one patient failed to respond to the treatment.", 
    "53": "The effect of atenolol on serum thyroid hormones levels is controversial. To get more information on this problem we studied the effect of propranolol and atenolol on plasma thyroid hormone concentrations in 20 thyrotoxic patients. Propranolol but not atenolol caused a significant decrease in T3 levels whereas no significant changes wee observed in T4 levels after both propranolol and atenolol administration.", 
    "54": "The efficacity of installations of 0,5 p. cent timolol maleate unilaterally was statistically evaluated in 15 subjects: 5 with open-angle glaucoma, 5 with secondary glaucoma, and 5 normal subjects. A reduction in intraocular pressure was observed in all cases, not only in treated eyes, but also, though to a lesser degree, in untreated eyes. Effects were almost totally lacking on lacrimal secretion, corneal sensitivity, and pupil size in both eyes. The hypothesis is raised of possible unilateral treatment in selected patients with ocular hypertension and/or trabecular glaucoma.", 
    "55": "For drugs with a high hepatic clearance, bioavailability is low due to the so-called \"first pass effect\". Prediction of the bioavailability for these drugs has been only loosely tested. It is proposed that by plotting the reciprocal of bioavailability versus the oral clearance, a straight line with intercept of unity and slope of reciprocal of hepatic blood flow should ensue. For lignocaine and verapamil, this relationship was found to be strong and gave good predictability, whereas for propranolol this relationship was weak and gave poor predictability. The proposed method may be of value in determining whether the low bioavailability of a drug is due to hepatic first pass metabolism.", 
    "56": "The concentrations of mepindolol in plasma and milk of five breastfeeding mothers were determined after 1 and 5 daily doses of mepindolol sulphate 20 mg. In the newborns plasma levels were measured once on the first and fifth days of the study. The mean maternal plasma concentration of mepindolol 2 h after administration was 52 ng/ml both after 1 and 5 doses; in the milk 18 and 22 ng/ml the corresponding concentrations were. The average plasma/milk drug concentration ratio was 2.6 +/- 1.6. Plasma levels in the newborn were below the detection limit of 1 ng/ml, except for one baby in whom 2 and 5 ng/ml, respectively, were found 4 h after one and five maternal doses.", 
    "57": "The use of effective and safe hypotensive agents in neuroanesthesia is a difficult and unanswered question. Most hypotensive agents produce an increase in intracranial pressure and as a result can not be used until the dura is opened. In experiments in dogs, Labetalol, a combined alpha and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, showed no increase in intracranial pressure and no change in intracranial compliance by producing hypotension.", 
    "58": "Experiments have been carried out in dogs and man to determine the effect of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) on the pharmacokinetics of propranolol and to evaluate the bioavailability of two dosage forms containing both propranolol and HCT (40/25 and 80/25 mg, respectively). In adult male beagles, 50 mg of HCT had no apparent effect on AUC, Cmax, Tmax, and T1/2 of propranolol administered concurrently. In man, INDERIDE (40/25 mg) and INDERIDE (80/25 mg) were shown to be similar in bioavailability to the reference formulations, i.e. the same amount of drugs administered as the separate tablets of INDERAL plus HYDRODIURIL.", 
    "59": "The effects of ciguatoxin, scaritoxin and maitotoxin, the main toxins involved in ciguatera fish poisoning, has been studied in pentobarbital anaesthetized cats. Intravenous injections of increasing doses of these toxins (5 to 160 microgram/kg of partially purified samples) evoked respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances: hyperventilation at low doses and respiratory depression leading to respiratory arrest at high doses; bradycardia and troubles of the atrioventricular conduction at low doses, arrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia with transient hypertension at sublethal doses, and falling arterial pressure leading to complete heart failure at high doses. The mode of action of ciguatoxin has been studied by testing the preventive effects of pharmacological compounds such as hexamethonium, atropine, propranolol and phentolamine and by proceeding to bilateral adrenalectomy. The results have indicated both central and peripheral effects. Cholinergic and also alpha-adrenergic actions were pointed out.", 
    "60": "The effect of bradykinin (BK) on renal function was examined in anesthetized dogs with or without treatment with either indomethacin or propranolol. Renal arterial infusion of BK (3 micrograms/min) in control dogs produced a sustained increase in urine flow rate (V), sodium excretion (UNaV), potassium excretion (UKV), and renal plasma flow (RPF) without a consistent change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or renin secretion rate (RSR). This increase in salt and water excretion and in RPF could not be blocked with indomethacin (5 mg/kg, followed by 2.1-3.2 mg/kg/h, i.v.). UNaV was 20.8 +/- 7.4 and 123.3 +/- 22.3 muEq/min (mean +/- SEM values) before and after 140 min of infusion of BK (p less than 0.005), respectively. Beta-receptor blockade with propranolol (5 mg/kg, followed by 2.8-3.4 mg/kg/h, i.v.) did not prevent the BK-induced rise in salt and water excretion, or in RPF. UNaV was 26.0 +/- 9.7 and 96.4 +/- 21.5 muEq/min before and after 140 min of infusion of BK (p less than 0.005), respectively. The data suggest that the effects of BK on renal handling of salt and water and on RPF are not mediated by either prostaglandins or beta receptors.", 
    "61": "In four ocular hypertensive patients (seven eyes) the lowering of intraocular pressure to a normal level persisted over a period of several months after gradual cessation of topical Timolol therapy. This remanent efficiency (\"after-effect\") could be used in treating ocular hypertension in order to prevent glaucoma damage.", 
    "62": "Acute hypoxia (9.5% O2) increased the heart rate (HR) in hypoxia (12% O2 for 2 months)-acclimated (HX) rats, while it decreased HR in unacclimated (CT) rats. After treatment with propranolol, acute hypoxia decreased HR to the same extent in CT and HX rats. After treatment with atropine, acute hypoxia increased HR in HX rats but not in CT rats. The hypoxia-induced tachycardia in HX rats may be mainly due to an enhanced sympatho-adrenal activity.", 
    "63": "The long-term effect of timolol maleate on lacrimal secretion was tested by investigating the concentration of lysozyme and albumin in tears before the start of treatment and after different follow-up periods. A total of 25 patients (45 eyes) were treated with 0.25% or 0.5% timolol as the only antiglaucomatous therapy over a 7.6 month mean observation period (2-13 months). No significant change was found either in the lysozyme or in the albumin concentration."
