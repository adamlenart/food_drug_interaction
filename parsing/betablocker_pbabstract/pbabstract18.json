Minimization of renal toxicity is essential, but the interference of nephroprotective agents, particularly antioxidants, with the antitumor activity of cisplatin is a general concern. We have recently demonstrated that the anti-hypertensive and antioxidant drug carvedilol (CV) protects against the renal damage and increases the survival of tumor-bearing mice without impairing the tumor reduction by cisplatin. So far, reports on the antioxidant mechanism of CV are controversial and there are no data on the impact of CV on the antitumor mechanisms of cisplatin. Therefore, this study addresses the effect of CV on mechanisms underlying the tumor control by cisplatin. CV did not interfere with the biodistribution or the genotoxicity of cisplatin. We also addressed the antioxidant mechanisms of CV and demonstrated that it does not neutralize free radicals, but is an efficient chelator of ferrous ions that are relevant catalyzers in cisplatin nephrotoxicity. The present data suggest that oxidative damage and genotoxicity play different roles in the toxicity of cisplatin on kidneys and tumors and therefore, some antioxidants might be safe as chemoprotectors. Altogether, our studies provide consistent evidence of the beneficial effect of CV on animals treated with cisplatin and might encourage clinical trials.",

In order to further understand the role of IC on cardiovascular control, the present study compared the CV responses evoked by stimulation of N-metil-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the right and left posterior IC at different rostrocaudal levels. Intracortical microinjections of NMDA were performed into the IC of male Wistar rats anaesthetized with urethane (1.4\u00a0g/kg) prepared for blood pressure, heart rate and renal sympathetic nerve activity. Gene expression of NMDA receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B in the IC was confirmed by RT-PCR. Immunofluorescence for the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit was demonstrated in the IC (coordinates anteroposterior (AP)\u00a0+1.5, 0.0 and -1.5\u00a0mm). A cardiac sympathoinhibitory site was identified, more rostrally located than identified in previous studies. A site of sympathoexcitatory cardiac control was identified more caudal to this region in agreement with earlier work. Under the experimental conditions, no lateralization of cardiovascular function was identified with chemical stimulation eliciting the same responses from either left or right insular cortices. No tonic role of the insula on cardiovascular control was identified with the use of the NMDA antagonist, AP-5. Peri-insular microinjection of NMDA was without cardiovascular effect indicating the specificity of the insula as a cardiovascular regulatory site. The current study reveals a functional topography for autonomic cardiovascular control along the rostrocaudal axis of the posterior IC.", 
    "9": "Published data on nebivolol reveal selective \u03b21 adrenergic selectively along with novel nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasodilatory properties. However, the exact molecular mechanism is unknown. Protein S-nitrosylation constitutes a large part of the ubiquitous influence of NO on cellular signal transduction and is involved in a number of human diseases. More recently, protein denitrosylation has been shown to play a major role in controlling cellular S-nitrosylation (SNO). Several enzymes have been reported to catalyze the reduction of SNOs and are viewed as candidate denitrosylases. One of the first described is known as S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR). Importantly, GSNOR has been shown to play a role in regulating SNO signaling downstream of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor and is therefore operative in cellular signal transduction. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of GSNOR leads to enhanced vasodilation and characteristic of known effects of nebivolol. Structurally, nebivolol is similar to known inhibitors of GSNOR. Therefore, we hypothesize that some of the known effects of nebivolol may occur through this mechanism.",

The aim of this work was to improve carvedilol bioavailability through developing carvedilol-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) for nasal administration. SLNs were prepared by emulsion/solvent evaporation method. A 2(3) factorial design was employed with lipid type (Compritol or Precirol), surfactant (1 or 2% w/v poloxamer 188), and co-surfactant (0.25 or 0.5% w/v lecithin) concentrations as independent variables, while entrapment efficiency (EE%), particle size, and amount of carvedilol permeated/unit area in 24\u00a0h (Q 24) were the dependent variables. Regression analysis was performed to identify the optimum formulation conditions. The in vivo behavior was evaluated in rabbits comparing the bioavailability of carvedilol after intravenous, nasal, and oral administration. The results revealed high drug EE% ranging from 68 to 87.62%. Carvedilol-loaded SLNs showed a spherical shape with an enriched core drug loading pattern having a particle size in the range of 66 to 352\u00a0nm. The developed SLNs exhibited significant high amounts of carvedilol permeated through the nasal mucosa as confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The in vivo pharmacokinetic study revealed that the absolute bioavailability of the optimized intranasal SLNs (50.63%) was significantly higher than oral carvedilol formulation (24.11%). Hence, we conclude that our developed SLNs represent a promising carrier for the nasal delivery of carvedilol.", 
    "18": "Ethylcellulose is one of the most commonly used polymers to develop reservoir type extended release multiparticulate dosage forms. For multiparticulate extended release dosage forms, the drug release is typically governed by the properties of the barrier membrane coating. The ICH Pharmaceutical Development Guideline (ICH Q8) requires an understanding of the influence of critical material attributes and critical process parameters on the drug release of a pharmaceutical product. Using this understanding, it is possible to develop robust formulations with consistent drug release characteristics. Critical material attributes for ethylcellulose were evaluated, and polymer molecular weight variation (viscosity) was considered to be the most critical attribute that can impact drug release. To investigate the effect of viscosity variation within the manufacturer's specifications of ethylcellulose, extended release multiparticulate formulations of two model drugs, metoprolol tartrate and acetaminophen, were developed using ETHOCEL\u2122 as the rate controlling polymer. Quality by Design (QbD) samples of ETHOCEL Std. 10, 20, and 100 Premium grades representing the low, medium, and high molecular weight (viscosity) material were organically coated onto drug layered multiparticulates to a 15% weight gain (WG). The drug release was found to be similar (f 2\u2009>\u200950) for both metoprolol tartrate and acetaminophen multiparticulates at different coating weight gains of ethylcellulose, highlighting consistent and robust drug release performance. The use of ETHOCEL QbD samples also serves as a means to develop multiparticulate dosage formulations according to regulatory guidelines.",

There are no established treatments for AI, and preoperative prediction and prevention of AI is needed. The opening of a native aortic valve (AV) is a sufficient condition for prevention of AI, and improvement of LV ejection fraction due to LV reverse remodeling (LVRR) is essential to open a native AV. Preoperative insufficient \u03b2-blocker treatment and pulsatile flow LVAD usage are keys for LVRR, opening of an AV, and prevention of AI. The second mechanism that leads to AI is remodeling of the aortic root and degeneration of a native AV, which results from reduced pulse pressure during LVAD support. Centrifugal or pulsatile flow LVAD usage has an advantage in terms of preserving pulsatility, and may prevent AI compared with an axial pump. There is less probability of avoiding AI with sufficient \u03b2-blocker treatment, and these patients may be good candidates for concomitant surgical intervention to a native AV at the time of LVAD implantation.",

Preoperative assessment is imperative for every vascular procedure since it has been associated with major postoperative cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction being the most common. After excluding active disease, functional capacity and clinical risk predictors must be determined via METs and the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), respectively. If a patient is considered to have a high cardiac risk, then noninvasive studies should be performed. Aspirin and a statin should be administrated preoperatively and postoperatively. Clopidogrel can be utilized as an alternative if a contraindication to aspirin exists.

FPS-ZM1 is not toxic to mice and can easily cross the blood-brain barrier. In this study, an AGEs-RAGE-activated rat model were established by intrahippocampal injection of AGEs, then these rats were treated with intraperitoneal administration of FPS-ZM1 and the possible neuroprotective effects were investigated. We found that AGEs administration induced an-regulation of Abeta production, inflammation, and oxidative stress, and an increased escape latency of rats in the Morris water maze test, all of these are significantly reduced by FPS-ZM1 treatment. Our results suggest that the AGEs-RAGE pathway is responsible for cognitive deficits, and therefore may be a potential treatment target. FPS-ZM1 might be a novel therapeutic agent to treat AD patients.",

In the present study, we examined whether the EE enhancing activity of FL is mediated by adrenergic effect using several adrenalin receptor (AR) blockers. In the first study, mice were butoxamine, as \u03b22AR blocker, with vehicle or 10mg/kg FL orally. We found that pretreatment with butoxamine prevented the increases of EE, the mRNA expression of UCP-3, and phosphorylated AMPK\u03b1 that were induced in the gastrocnemius muscle of mice by 10mg/kg FL. Secondly, mice were given SR52930, as \u03b23AR blocker. Pretreatment with SR52930 prevented the increases of EE, the mRNA expression of UCP-3, and phosphorylated AMPK\u03b1 that were induced in the gastrocnemius muscle of mice by 10mg/kg FL. Pretreatment with a combination of both blockers also reduced the increments in mRNA expression levels of UCPs and PGC-1\u03b1, however, phosphorylated AMPK\u03b1 in skeletal muscle was rather increased. These results suggest that the ability of a single oral dose of FL to enhance metabolic activity is mediated by sympathetic nerve system (SNS).",

However, medications like beta blockers which are prescribed to treat several cardiac conditions have a direct influence on the cardiovascular system and may impact the relationship between HR and energy expenditure during physical activity (AEE). This study proposes to estimate AEE from HR using mixed models (MIX-REG) by introducing a novel method to personalize the prediction equation. We selected as features to represent the individual random effect in the MIX-REG model those subject characteristics which minimized both estimation error (RMSE) and between-subjects error bias variability. Data from 17 patients post-myocardial infarction were collected during a laboratory protocol. AEE was measured using indirect calorimetry and HR using an innovative wrist worn activity monitor equipped with the Philips Cardio and Motion Monitoring Module (CM3-Generation-1), which is an integrated module including a photo-plethysmographic and accelerometer sensor. The presented method showed large AEE estimation accuracy (RMSE = 1.35 kcal/min) which was comparable to that of models personalized using data from laboratory calibration protocols (HR-FLEX) and was superior to multi-linear regression and MIX-REG models trained using a stepwise features selection procedure.", 
    "38": "The aim of our study was to estimate clearance of bisoprolol and reveal the factors that could influence its pharmacokinetic (PK) variability in hypertensive patients on hemodialysis, using the population PK analysis. Parameters associated with plasma concentration of bisoprolol at steady state were analyzed in 63 patients (mean age 62.12 years, mean total weight 69.63 kg) who were hypertensive and on hemodialysis due to severe renal failure using non-linear mixed-effect modeling with ADVAN1 subroutine. The final regression model for the clearance of the drug included only creatinine clearance (CLcr) out of 12 tested covariates. The equation that describes CL of bisoprolol is the following: CL (l/h) = 0.12 + 6.33 * CLcr. These findings suggest that the routine measuring of serum creatinine level may be used to facilitate administration of bisoprolol in patients on hemodialysis.", 
    "39": "Guidelines on perioperative cardiovascular evaluation and management of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery recommend initiation of beta-blocker therapy in at-risk patients who are undergoing intermediate- to high-risk surgery. Continuation of therapy in patients already receiving beta-blockers is also recommended. Recent literature, however, reported an increased risk of perioperative cardiovascular mortality among patients who continued with existing beta-blockade; most patients in this study were using metoprolol. There are important pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences between various beta-blockers, and these differences may explain the differences in clinical effects. Metoprolol has less beta1 receptor affinity compared with atenolol and bisoprolol, and beta1 receptor polymorphisms affect the clinical effects of metoprolol. Furthermore, metoprolol is dependent on activity of the CYP2D6 liver enzyme, which results in clinically important differences in plasma concentration. It is, therefore, wise to follow the European guidelines and to initiate beta-blocker therapy in the perioperative period with either atenolol or bisoprolol.",

    "45": "Metformin can induce breast cancer (BC) cell apoptosis and reduce BC local and metastatic growth in preclinical models. Since Metformin is frequently used along with Aspirin or beta-blockers, we investigated the effect of Metformin, Aspirin and the beta-blocker Atenolol in several BC models. In vitro, Aspirin synergized with Metformin in inducing apoptosis of triple negative and endocrine-sensitive BC cells, and in activating AMPK in BC and in white adipose tissue (WAT) progenitors known to cooperate to BC progression. Both Aspirin and Atenolol added to the inhibitory effect of Metformin against complex I of the respiratory chain. In both immune-deficient and immune-competent preclinical models, Atenolol increased Metformin activity against angiogenesis, local and metastatic growth of HER2+ and triple negative BC. Aspirin increased the activity of Metformin only in immune-competent HER2+ BC models. Both Aspirin and Atenolol, when added to Metformin, significantly reduced the endothelial cell component of tumor vessels, whereas pericytes were reduced by the addition of Atenolol but not by the addition of Aspirin. Our data indicate that the addition of Aspirin or of Atenolol to Metformin might be beneficial for BC control, and that this activity is likely due to effects on both BC and microenvironment cells.",

The primary aims of this report were to examine the evidence related to medical therapy for Marfan syndrome, including recently completed randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of \u03b2-blockers and angiotensin II receptor blockers for the prophylactic treatment of aortic enlargement in Marfan syndrome, and to provide recommendations for medical therapy on the basis of available evidence. Medical therapy for Marfan syndrome should be individualized according to patient tolerance and risk factors such as age, aortic size, and family history of aortic dissection. The Pediatric Heart Network trial showed that atenolol and losartan each reduced the rate of aortic dilation. All patients with known or suspected Marfan syndrome and aortic root dilation should receive medical therapy with adequate doses of either \u03b2-blocker or angiotensin receptor blocker. The Pediatric Heart Network trial also showed that atenolol and losartan are more effective at reduction of aortic root z score in younger subjects, which suggests that medical therapy should be prescribed even in the youngest children with aortic dilation. For patients with Marfan syndrome without aortic dilation, the available evidence is less clear. If aortic dilation is severe and/or progressive, therapy with a combination of \u03b2-blocker and angiotensin receptor blocker should be considered, although trial results are mixed with respect to the efficacy of combination therapy vs monotherapy.", 
    "47": "A sensitive, rapid and simple flow-injection chemiluminescence (CL) system based on the light emitted from KMnO4-cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS QDs) reaction in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in acidic medium was developed as a CL probe for the sensitive determination of atenolol. Optical and structural features of CdS QDs capped with l-cysteine, which synthesized via hydrothermal approach, were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), photoluminescence (PL), and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The CL intensity of KMnO4-CdS QDs-CTAB was remarkably enhanced in the presence of trace level of atenolol. Under optimum experimental conditions, there is a linear relationship between the increase in CL intensity of KMnO4-CdS QDs-CTAB system and atenolol concentration in a range of 0.001 to 4.0 mg L(-1) and 4.0 to 18.0 mg L(-1), with a detection limit (3\u03c3) of 0.0010 mg L(-1). A possible mechanism for KMnO4-CdS QDs-CTAB-atenolol CL reaction is proposed. To prove the practical application of the KMnO4-CdS QDs-CTAB CL method, the method was applied for the determination of atenolol in spiked environmental water samples and commercial pharmaceutical formulation. Furthermore, corona discharge ionization ion mobility spectrometry (CD-IMS) technique was utilized for determination of atenolol.", 
    "48": "Glutathione (GSH) plays a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative damage. Since neurons rely on the supply of GSH from astrocytes to maintain optimal intracellular GSH concentrations, the GSH concentration of astrocytes is important for the survival of neighboring neurons against oxidative stress. The neurotransmitter noradrenaline is known to modulate the functions of astrocytes and has been suggested to have neuroprotective properties in neurodegenerative diseases. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective properties of noradrenaline, in this study, we investigated the effect of noradrenaline on the concentrations of intracellular GSH in human U-251 malignant glioma (MG; astrocytoma) cells. Treatment of the cells with noradrenaline for 24h concentration-dependently increased their intracellular GSH concentration. This increase was inhibited by a non-selective \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and by a selective \u03b23-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A, but not by a non-selective \u03b1-adrenoceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine, or by a selective \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol or by a selective \u03b22-adrenoceptor antagonist butoxamine. In addition, the selective \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonist CL316243 increased the intracellular GSH in U-251 MG cells. Treatment of the cells with noradrenaline (10\u03bcM) for 24h increased the protein level of the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLc), the rate-limiting enzyme of GSH synthesis; and this increase was inhibited by SR59230A. These results thus suggest that noradrenaline increased the GSH concentration in astrocytes by inducing GCLc protein in them via \u03b23-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "49": "Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) is a distinct and heterogeneous entity that can lead to progressive cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. LVNC with dilation and/or dysfunction is associated with a greater mortality risk. We hypothesized that initiation of heart failure medications in patients with LVNC and ventricular dysfunction or dilation would improve systolic function and result in favorable left ventricular remodeling. The study was a retrospective chart review. Inclusion criteria included: presence of LVNC, reduced systolic function or ventricular dilation, therapy with at least one medication (beta blocker, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker), imaging pre- and post-initiation of therapy. Fifty-one patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age at initiation of medication was 11.5 \u00b1 11.8 years. Follow-up was 2.4 \u00b1 2.3 years. Three patients (6 %) were solely on a beta blocker, 15 (29 %) on ACE/ARB monotherapy, and 33 (65 %) on dual therapy. At follow-up 45/51 patients (88 %) had improvement in ejection fraction/shortening and 6/51 (12 %) had no change. Ejection fraction, shortening fraction, and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension in the cohort before and after therapeutic intervention demonstrated a 16 \u00b1 12 % improvement in ejection fraction (p < 0.0001), an 8 \u00b1 9 % improvement in shortening fraction (p < 0.0001), and a 0.83 \u00b1 1.93 (p < 0.05) decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic z-score. Early diagnosis and medical treatment of LVNC with reduced systolic function and/or dilation leads to favorable remodeling evident by an improvement in ventricular systolic function and reduction of ventricular end-diastolic dimensions.", 
    "50": "The objective of the present study was to investigate the uptake, depuration, and bioconcentration of two pharmaceuticals, roxithromycin (ROX) and propranolol (PRP), in Daphnia magna via aqueous exposure. Additionally, dietary and pH effects on the bioconcentration of two pharmaceuticals in daphnia were studied. During the 24-h uptake phase followed by the 24-h depuration phase, the uptake rate constants (k(u)) of ROX for daphnia were 9.21 and 2.77 L kg(-1) h(-1), corresponding to the exposure concentrations of 5 and 100 \u03bcg L(-1), respectively; For PRP at the nominal concentrations of 5 and 100 \u03bcg L(-1), k(u) were 2.29 and 0.99 L kg(-1) h(-1), respectively. The depuration rate constants (k(d)) of ROX in daphnia, at the exposure concentrations of 5 and 100 \u03bcg L(-1), were 0.0985 and 0.207 h(-1), respectively; while those of PRP were 0.0276 and 0.0539 h(-1) for the nominal concentrations of 5 and 100 \u03bcg L(-1), respectively. With the decreasing exposure concentrations, the bioconcentration factors (BCFs) in daphnia ranged from 13.4 to 93.5 L kg(-1) for ROX, and 18.4 to 83.0 L kg(-1) for PRP, revealing the considerable accumulation potential of these two pharmaceuticals. Moreover, after 6h exposure, the body burdens of ROX and PRP in dead daphnia were 4.98-6.14 and 7.42-12.9 times higher than those in living daphnia, respectively, implying that body surface sorption dominates the bioconcentration of the two pharmaceuticals in daphnia. In addition, the presence of algal food in the media could significantly elevate the kd values for both ROX and PRP, thereby restraining their bioconcentration in daphnia. A pH-dependent bioconcentration study revealed that the bioconcentration of the two pharmaceuticals in daphnia increased with increasing pH levels, which ranged from 7 to 9. Finally, a model was developed to estimate the relationships between pH and the BCFs of the two pharmaceuticals in zooplankton. The predicted values based on this model were highly consistent with wildlife monitoring data, implying that this model will be useful in identifying the bioaccumulation risks that pharmaceuticals pose to zooplankton.",

Ivabradine was only recently approved by Food and Drug administration after the results of Systolic Heart Failure Treatment with the If Inhibitor Ivabradine (SHIFT) trial, for a reduction in rehospitalizations from chronic heart failure. This trial assessed patients with stable heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and a heart rate of at least 70 beats per minute at rest on maximally tolerated beta-blocker therapy and demonstrated statistically significant reduction in heart failure hospitalization and deaths. Additionally, ivabradine has been associated with reduced cardiac remodeling, reduced heart rate variability, improvement in exercise tolerance, improved heart failure class of New York Heart Association, and better quality of life. It has also been tried in other conditions, such as inappropriate sinus tachycardia and cardiogenic shock, and is currently in phase II trial for patients with newly diagnosed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.",

Approved drugs merely act symptomatically and delay the progression of the disease for a relatively short period of time. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of MH84 in a cellular HEK293APPwt model of AD, characterized by elevated beta amyloid protein levels (A\u03b21-42) and mitochondrial dysfunction. MH84 is a derivate of pirinixic acid belonging to a novel class of \u03b3-secretase modulators, which combines \u03b3-secretase modulation with activation of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3). The mitochondria modifying Dimebon, the \u03b3-secretase blocker DAPT, and the PPAR\u03b3 agonist pioglitazone were used as controls. MH84 protects against nitrosative stress, increased mitochondrial respiration, citrate synthase (CS) activity and protein levels of PGC1\u03b1 indicating enhanced mitochondrial content at nano-molar concentrations. Concurrently, MH84 decreased protein levels of APP, A\u03b21-42, and C-terminal fragments at micro-molar concentrations. Both Dimebon and DAPT reduced cellular A\u03b21-42 levels. Dimebon improved mitochondrial functions and DAPT decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Pioglitazone had no effects on APP processing and mitochondrial function. Our data emphasizes MH84 as possible novel therapeutic agent with mitochondria-based mode of action.",

We provide examples of memory interventions that are currently available for medical purposes, but that in the future could be used in the forensic setting to modify criminal offenders' memories. In this section we contrast the cases of (1) dampening and (2) enhancing memories of criminal offenders.

Lasers varied across studies in type, pulse width, or cooling materials. Most comparative studies (n\u2009=\u20099) assessed variations of pulsed dye laser (PDL) and examined heterogeneous endpoints. Most studies reported on treatment of cutaneous lesions. Overall, longer pulse PDL with epidermal cooling was the most commonly used laser for cutaneous lesions; Nd:YAG was the most commonly used intralesionally. Most studies reported a higher success rate with longer pulse PDL compared with observation in managing the size of IH, although the magnitude of effect differed substantially. CO2 laser was used for subglottic IH in a single study, and was noted to have a higher success rate and lower complication rate than both Nd:YAG and observation. Studies comparing laser with \u03b2-blockers or in combination with \u03b2-blockers reported greater improvements in lesion size in combination arms versus \u03b2-blockers alone and greater effects of lasers on mixed superficial and deep IH. Strength of the evidence for outcomes after laser treatments ranged from insufficient to low for effectiveness outcomes. Strength of the evidence was insufficient for the effects of laser compared with \u03b2-blockers or in combination with \u03b2-blockers as studies evaluated different agents and laser types.

Firstly, operating factors influencing EF process were assessed. MTPL solutions were completely mineralized after 4h-electrolysis under optimal operating conditions and BDD anode demonstrated its oxidation superiority. The absolute rate constant of MTPL oxidation byOH (kMTPL) was determined by the competition kinetics method and found to be (1.72\u00b10.04)\u00d710(9)M(-1)s(-1).

    "126": "Heart failure (HF) is predominantly a disease of older adults and characterized by extensive sympatho-vagal imbalance leading to impaired reflex control of heart rate (HR). However, whether aging influences the development or extent of the autonomic imbalance in HF remains unclear. To address this, we used an ovine model of aging with tachypacing-induced HF to determine whether aging affects the chronotropic and inotropic responses to autonomic stimulation and reduction in heart rate variability (HRV) in HF. We find that aging is associated with increased cardiac dimensions and reduced contractility before the onset of tachypacing, and these differences persist in HF. Additionally, the chronotropic response to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation was markedly attenuated in HF, and this occurred more rapidly in aged animals. By measuring HR during sequential autonomic blockade, our data are consistent with a reduced parasympathetic control of resting HR in aging, with young HF animals having an attenuated sympathetic influence on HR. Time-domain analyses of HR show a reduction in HRV in both young and aged failing animals, although HRV is lowest in aged HF. In conclusion, aging is associated with altered autonomic control and \u03b2-adrenergic responsiveness of HR, and these are exacerbated with the development of HF.",

    "132": "Ginseng has a long history of use as a tonic for restoration of vigor. One example of ginseng-derived tonic effect is that it can improve physical stamina under conditions of stress. However, the active ingredient and the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for the ergogenic effect are unknown. Recent studies show that ginseng contains a novel ingredient, gintonin, which consists of a unique class of herbal-medicine lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs). Gintonin activates G protein-coupled LPA receptors to produce a transient [Ca(2+)]i signal, which is coupled to diverse intra- and inter-cellular signal transduction pathways that stimulate hormone or neurotransmitter release. However, relatively little is known about how gintonin-mediated cellular modulation is linked to physical endurance. In the present study, systemic administration of gintonin, but not ginsenosides, in fasted mice increased blood glucose concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Gintonin treatment elevated blood glucose to a maximum level after 30min. This elevation in blood glucose level could be abrogated by the LPA1/3 receptor antagonist, Ki16425, or the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol. Furthermore, gintonin-dependent enhanced performance of fasted mice in rotarod test was likewise abrogated by Ki16425. Gintonin also elevated plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations. The present study shows that gintonin mediates catecholamine release through activation of the LPA receptor and that activation of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor is coupled to liver glycogenolysis, thereby increasing the supply of glucose and enhancing performance in the rotarod test. Thus, gintonin acts via the LPA-catecholamine-glycogenolysis axis, representing a candidate mechanism that can explain how ginseng treatment enhances physical stamina.",

We therefore investigated nadolol as a potential substrate of the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1 and of the renal transporters OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K expressed in HEK cells. Moreover, the importance of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) for nadolol transport was studied using double transfected MDCK-OCT1-P-gp cells. Nadolol was not transported by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. In contrast, a significantly higher nadolol accumulation (at 1 and 10 \u03bcM) was found in OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K cells compared to control cells (P < 0.01). Km values for OCT2-, MATE1-, and MATE2-K-mediated nadolol uptake were 122, 531, and 372 \u03bcM, respectively. Cimetidine (100 \u03bcM, P < 0.01) and trimethoprim (100 \u03bcM, P < 0.001) significantly inhibited OCT1-, OCT2-, MATE1-, and MATE2-K-mediated nadolol transport. The P-gp inhibitor zosuquidar significantly reduced basal to apical nadolol transport in monolayers of MDCK-OCT1-P-gp cells. In summary, nadolol is a substrate of the cation transporters OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, and of P-gp. These data will aid future in vivo studies on potential transporter-mediated drug-drug or drug-food interactions with involvement of nadolol.",

The three agents under consideration were: ACS67, a hybrid of latanoprost and a H2S-donating moiety; L-cysteine, a substrate for endogenous production of H2S and GYY 4137, a slow donor of H2S. We also examined the contribution of prostaglandins to the pharmacological actions of the H2S donors on release of [(3)H]-norepinephrine ([(3)H]NE) triggered by electrical field stimulation. ACS67, L-cysteine and GYY 4137 caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of electrically-evoked [(3)H]NE release from isolated bovine iris-ciliary bodies without affecting basal [(3)H]NE efflux. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor, flurbiprofen enhanced the inhibitory action of ACS67 and L-cysteine on stimulated [(3)H]NE release. Both aminooxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase and glibenclamide, a KATP channel blocker reversed the inhibition of evoked NE release induced by the H2S donors. We conclude that H2S donors can inhibit sympathetic neurotransmission from isolated bovine iris-ciliary bodies, an effect partially dependent on the in situ production of H2S and prostanoids, and is mediated by an action on KATP channels.",

Landiolol is an ultra-short-acting \u03b21-selective blocker whose effect on tachyarrhythmia after TCPC is unclear. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of landiolol for tachyarrhythmia after TCPC. Consecutive patients undergoing TCPC were enrolled from January 2007 to December 2011. Of 435 pediatric open heart surgeries, 28 patients underwent TCPC. Of the 28 patients, 13 were treated with landiolol for critical tachyarrhythmia. Excluding three patients who received landiolol during surgery, we investigated the remaining 10 patients and statistical analysis was performed without a 10-year-old patient as outlier. The median age was 4.08 years. The subjects comprised five patients with sinus tachycardia, four with junctional ectopic tachycardia and one with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The initial dose was 4.7 \u00b1 2.3 \u03bcg/kg/min, without a loading dose. Landiolol reduced the heart rate from 151.8 \u00b1 23.2 at the start to 132.9 \u00b1 20.0 at 1 h and 126.1 \u00b1 24.9 at 2 h (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively), without blood pressure decrease (P = 0.235).

The tablet containing shellac wax as the outer tablet and lutrol as the inner tablet showed more appropriate drug release and the size of the inner layer influenced the rate of drug release. In addition, the aqueous solubility of the drug and the components of the inner tablet or outer layer affected the drug release behavior.

Biphasic drug release pattern was found in the tablet of which the outer layer rapidly eroded. The drug dissolution data from drug-loaded-outer layer could predict the dissolution time for the outer layer of drug-loaded inner part of double-layered matrix tablet.

Here we show that, while the microinjection of the beta-noradrenergic receptor blocker timolol into CA1 impairs OR memory consolidation, the microinjection of norepinephrine (NE) promotes the persistence of this type of memory.

Treatment with nebivolol, carvedilol, metoprolol and atenolol suppressed Cell Index (CI) of serum-starved HL-1 cells (\u226417%, \u22648%, \u226415% and \u226415% respectively) as measured by the Xcelligence Real-Time Cell Analyzer (RTCA). Conversely, CI was increased by Ang II (\u22659.6%), CGP42112A (\u226514%), and NP-6A4 (\u226525%) respectively and this effect was blocked by AT2R antagonist PD123319, but not by AT1R antagonist losartan. Thus, the CI signature for each drug could be unique. MTS cell proliferation assay showed that NP-6A4, but not other drugs, increased viability (\u226520%) of HL-1 and hCAVSMCs. Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) staining showed that nebivolol was most effective in reducing cell sizes of HL-1 and hCAVSMCs. Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 (MCL-1) is a protein critical for cardiovascular cell survival and implicated in cell adhesion. \u03b2-blockers significantly suppressed and NP-6A4 increased MCL-1 expression in HL-1 and hCAVSMCs as determined by immunofluorescence. Thus, reduction in cell size and/or MCL-1 expression might underlie \u03b2-blocker-induced reduction in CI of HL-1. Conversely, increase in cell viability and MCL-1 expression by NP-6A4 through AT2R could have resulted in NP-6A4 mediated increase in CI of HL-1. These data show for the first time that activation of the AT2R-MCL-1 axis by NP-6A4 in nutrient-stressed mouse and human cardiovascular cells (mouse HL-1 cells and primary cultures of hCAVSMCs) might underlie improved survival of cells treated by NP-6A4 compared to other drugs tested in this study.",

There have been a variety of interventions used in CSC, including, but not limited to, laser treatment, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. However, it is not known whether these or other treatments offer significant advantages over observation or other interventions. At present there is no evidence-based consensus on the management of CSC.

The trials were small (most trials enrolled fewer than 50 participants) and poorly reported; often it was unclear whether key aspects of the trial, such as allocation concealment, had been done. A substantial proportion of the trials were not masked.The studies considered a variety of treatments: anti-VEGF (ranibizumab, bevacizumab), PDT (full-dose, half-dose, 30%, low-fluence), laser treatment (argon, krypton and micropulse laser), beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, Helicobactor pylori treatment, and nutritional supplements (Icaps, lutein); there were only one or two trials contributing data for each comparison. We downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision for most analyses, reflecting study limitations and imprecise estimates. Network meta-analysis (as planned in our protocol) did not help to resolve this uncertainty due to a lack of trials, and problems with intransitivity, particularly with respect to acute or chronic CSC.Low quality evidence from two trials suggested little difference in the effect of anti-VEGF (ranibizumab or bevacizumab) or observation on change in visual acuity at six months in acute CSC (mean difference (MD) 0.01 LogMAR (logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution), 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.02 to 0.03; 64 participants). CSC had resolved in all participants by six months. There were no significant adverse effects noted.Low quality evidence from one study (58 participants) suggested that half-dose PDT treatment of acute CSC probably results in a small improvement in vision (MD -0.10 logMAR, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02), less recurrence (risk ratio (RR) 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.81) and less persistent CSC (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.02) at 12 months compared to sham treatment. There were no significant adverse events noted.Low quality evidence from two trials (56 participants) comparing anti-VEGF to low-fluence PDT in chronic CSC found little evidence for any difference in visual acuity at 12 months (MD 0.03 logMAR, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.15). There was some evidence that more people in the anti-VEGF group had recurrent CSC compared to people treated with PDT but, due to inconsistency between trials, it was difficult to estimate an effect. More people in the anti-VEGF group had persistent CSC at 12 months (RR 6.19, 95% CI 1.61 to 23.81; 34 participants).Two small trials of micropulse laser, one in people with acute CSC and one in people with chronic CSC, provided low quality evidence that laser treatment may lead to better visual acuity (MD -0.20 logMAR, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.11; 45 participants). There were no significant adverse effects noted.Other comparisons were largely inconclusive.We identified 12 ongoing trials covering the following interventions: aflibercept and eplerenone in acute CSC; spironolactone, eplerenone, lutein, PDT, and micropulse laser in chronic CSC; and micropulse laser and oral mifepristone in two trials where type of CSC not clearly specified.",

It is not clear whether there is a clinically important benefit to treating acute CSC which often resolves spontaneously as part of its natural history. RCTs comparing individual treatments to the natural history would be valuable in identifying potential treatment groups for head-to-head comparison.

This was also higher in the NLT group compared to usual care (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.47, low-quality evidence). However, there was a substantial degree of heterogeneity in this pooled analysis. We rated the risk of bias in these studies as high mainly due to a lack of clarity regarding incomplete outcome data, lack of reporting on adverse events associated with the intervention, and the inability to blind participants and personnel. Participants in the NLT group reached maximal dose of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in half the time compared with participants in usual care.

For patients in this subpopulation, the therapy is expected to have a desirable overall risk-benefit profile. To develop and validate such a \"therapy-diagnostic co-development\" strategy, a three-step procedure may be conducted with three independent data sets from a series of similar studies or a single trial. At the first stage, we create various candidate scoring systems based on the baseline information of the patients via, for example, parametric models using the first data set. Each individual score reflects an anticipated average treatment difference for future patients who share similar baseline profiles. A large score indicates that these patients tend to benefit from the new therapy. At the second step, a potentially promising, enrichable subgroup is identified using the totality of evidence from these scoring systems. At the final stage, we validate such a selection via two-sample inference procedures for assessing the treatment effectiveness statistically and clinically with the third data set, the so-called holdout sample. When the study size is not large, one may combine the first two steps using a \"cross-training-evaluation\" process.

Therefore, effective interference with the memory reconsolidation process is expected to be an important treatment for drug addiction. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been well recognized as a pathway component that can prevent drug relapse, although the mechanism underlying this function is poorly understood. We aimed to clarify the regulatory role of the NAc in the cocaine memory reconsolidation process, by examining the effect of applying different pharmacological interventions to the NAc on Zif 268 and Fos B expression in the entire reward circuit after cocaine memory reactivation. Through the cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) model, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining for Zif 268 and Fos B were used to explore the functional activated brain nuclei after cocaine memory reactivation. Our results showed that the expression of Zif 268 and Fos B was commonly increased in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the infralimbic cortex (IL), the NAc-core, the NAc-shell, the hippocampus (CA1, CA2, and CA3 subregions), the amygdala, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) following memory reconsolidation, and Zif 268/Fos B co-expression was commonly observed (for Zif 268: 51-68%; for Fos B: 52-66%). Further, bilateral NAc-shell infusion of MK 801 and SCH 23390, but not raclopride or propranolol, prior to addictive memory reconsolidation, decreased Zif 268 and Fos B expression in the entire reward circuit, except for the amygdala, and effectively disturbed subsequent CPP-related behavior. In summary, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and dopamine D1 receptors, but not dopamine D2 or \u03b2 adrenergic receptors, within the NAc-shell, may regulate Zif 268 and Fos B expression in most brain nuclei of the reward circuit after cocaine memory reactivation.

This study has assessed the possibility that the local angiotensin system promotes endothelial senescence in coronary artery endothelial cells and also the protective effect of the Crataegus extract WS1442, a quantified hawthorn extract. Serial passaging from P1 to P4 (replicative senescence) and treatment of P1 endothelial cells with the eNOS inhibitor L-NAME (premature senescence) promoted acquisition of markers of senescence, enhanced ROS formation, decreased eNOS expression, and upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and AT1 receptors. Increased SA-\u03b2-gal activity and the upregulation of ACE and AT1R in senescent cells were prevented by antioxidants, an ACE inhibitor, and by an AT1 receptor blocker. WS1442 prevented SA-\u03b2-gal activity, the downregulation of eNOS, and oxidative stress in P3 cells. These findings indicate that the impairment of eNOS-derived nitric oxide formation favors a pro-oxidant response triggering the local angiotensin system, which, in turn, promotes endothelial senescence. Such a sequence of events can be effectively inhibited by a standardized polyphenol-rich extract mainly by targeting the oxidative stress.",

The maintenance dose of dexmedetomidine was higher in patients who did not experience changes [median and range for patients with and without tremor alteration 0.75 (0.2-1.0) and 1.0 \u00b5g \u00d7 kg(-1) \u00d7 h(-1) (0.7-1.4), respectively; p = 0.021].", 
    "254": "Dexmedetomidine provides adequate sedation during surgery for PD, but it might affect motor signs making intraoperative testing difficult or even impossible. Dosage appears not to be the determining factor in motor changes, whose cause remains unclear.", 
    "255": "Graves disease is the most common cause of persistent hyperthyroidism in adults. Approximately 3% of women and 0.5% of men will develop Graves disease during their lifetime.", 
    "256": "We searched PubMed and the Cochrane database for English-language studies published from June 2000 through October 5, 2015. Thirteen randomized clinical trials, 5 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and 52 observational studies were included in this review. Patients with Graves disease may be treated with antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine (RAI), or surgery (near-total thyroidectomy). The optimal approach depends on patient preference, geography, and clinical factors. A 12- to 18-month course of antithyroid drugs may lead to a remission in approximately 50% of patients but can cause potentially significant (albeit rare) adverse reactions, including agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity. Adverse reactions typically occur within the first 90 days of therapy. Treating Graves disease with RAI and surgery result in gland destruction or removal, necessitating life-long levothyroxine replacement. Use of RAI has also been associated with the development or worsening of thyroid eye disease in approximately 15% to 20% of patients. Surgery is favored in patients with concomitant suspicious or malignant thyroid nodules, coexisting hyperparathyroidism, and in patients with large goiters or moderate to severe thyroid eye disease who cannot be treated using antithyroid drugs. However, surgery is associated with potential complications such as hypoparathyroidism and vocal cord paralysis in a small proportion of patients. In pregnancy, antithyroid drugs are the primary therapy, but some women with Graves disease opt to receive definitive therapy with RAI or surgery prior to becoming pregnant to avoid potential teratogenic effects of antithyroid drugs during pregnancy.", 
    "257": "Management of Graves disease includes treatment with antithyroid drugs, RAI, or thyroidectomy. The optimal approach depends on patient preference and specific patient clinical features such as age, history of arrhythmia or ischemic heart disease, size of goiter, and severity of thyrotoxicosis. Physicians should be familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of each therapy to best counsel their patients."
