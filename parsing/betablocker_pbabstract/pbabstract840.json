    "0": "1. Removal of noradrenaline by isolated lungs of the rat, perfused via the pulmonary artery with Krebs bicarbonate solution has been studied.2. A constant removal (40.2%) was observed over a concentration range of 2-50 ng noradrenaline/ml (12-300 nM). At 100 ng/ml (600 nM), the removal is significantly reduced to 33.5%.3. The removal of noradrenaline was inhibited by cocaine (1 muM), but not by normetanephrine (5 muM), metaraminol (10 muM), phenoxybenzamine (10 muM) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (110 and 560 nM).4. We conclude that the removal of noradrenaline in the lungs does not involve an uptake process comparable with those previously described for this amine. The uptake process for noradrenaline in the lung is similar to that for 5-hydroxytryptamine and may be unique to this tissue.", 
    "1": "1. The effects of noradrenaline and isoprenaline on the repolarization phase of the action potential have been studied in the Purkinje fibres of sheep heart, electrically driven at constant rates.2. Isoprenaline (2, 5 and 8 x 10(-8) g/ml.) increases the slope of phase 2 of repolarization and decreases the plateau length; the resulting decrease in action potential duration is concentration dependent, but not rate dependent.3. The effect of isoprenaline on the action potential duration is entirely blocked by propranolol (10(-7) g/ml.) and unaffected by phentolamine (5 x 10(-7) g/ml.).4. In phentolamine (5 x 10(-7) g/ml.) pretreated preparations the response induced by noradrenaline (5 x 10(-8), 1 and 5 x 10(-7) g/ml.) is very similar to that induced by isoprenaline.5. In propranolol (2.5 x 10(-7) g/ml.) pretreated preparations noradrenaline causes a lengthening of the plateau phase and an increase in action potential duration.6. The relationship of these results to the presence of both alpha- and beta-receptors in cardiac Purkinje fibres is discussed.", 
    "2": "1. The effect of adenosine on left ventricular contractility and developed tension was studied in the anaesthetized intact dog. Normal and propranolol-treated animals were used. Adenosine was infused through a catheter into one of the two main branches of the left coronary artery, usually the circumflex branch. The rate of infusion was 150 x 10(-9)M/min. The infusion was maintained during 50 min.2. In both series of animals, no change was observed in the heart rate, aortic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, time from onset of left ventricular contraction to peak dP/dt, peak dP/dt and left ventricular tension-time index. It is concluded that a regional increase in adenosine concentration in the left ventricular wall has no inotropic effect when the adrenergic mechanisms are normal or depressed.3. The myocardial blood flow response to adenosine was determined at the 10th, 30th and 50th min of the infusion by the radioactive inert gas method. At the 10th min of the infusion, the myocardial blood flow averaged three times the control value in both series of dogs. Thereafter, the flow response remained stable in the normal dogs but declined at the 50th min of the infusion in the propranolol-treated animals. It is suggested that autoregulation of the coronary circulation in response to overperfusion of the myocardium at constant cardiac work may be enhanced at the lower myocardial oxygen requirements of the propranolol-treated dogs while, in the normal animals, it was insufficient to overcome the potent coronary dilator action of adenosine.", 
    "3": "The intravenous injection of prostaglandin E(1) (PGE(1)) causes a dose-dependent relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in the intact, lightly anesthetized opossum. The action of PGE(1) is not inhibited by the drugs that produce muscarinic or nicotinic cholinergic antagonism or alpha and beta adrenergic antagonism in the doses that inhibited the action of respective agonists. Moreover, this action is not affected by exogenous gastrin pentapeptide. The action of PGE(1) on the LES is mimicked by isoproterenol, theophylline ethylenediamine, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Both theophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and isoproterenol, an adenyl cyclase stimulator, added to the action of PGE(1). On the other hand, adenyl cyclase inhibitor nicotinic acid, as well as phosphodiesterase stimulator, imidazole inhibited its action. Further, both nicotinic acid and imidazole inhibited the degree of LES relaxation produced by esophageal distension. These studies suggest that intracellular cyclic AMP may act as the \"second messenger\" in the regulation of the lower esophageal sphincter relaxation.", 
    "4": "1. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties of 1-(p-allylphenoxy)-3-isopropylamino-2-propanol hydrochloride (H 64/52) on the cardiovascular and bronchomotor responses to isoprenaline have been determined in the anaesthetized dog.2. H 64/52 selectively blocked the isoprenaline-induced increase in heart rate, contractile force and reduction in airway pressure in the same dose range.3. H 64/52 produced a minimal blockade of vascular beta-adrenoceptors which was apparent only when the isoprenaline-induced fall in diastolic pressure was considered. No significant vascular beta-adrenoceptor blockade with H 64/52 could be shown with the femoral arterial flow or hind-limb perfusion studies.4. These results further support the hypothesis that several different beta-adrenoceptor subtypes exist in the dog. The beta-adrenoceptors subserving cardiac stimulation and bronchodilation appear to be similar and both differ from the beta-adrenoceptor subserving vasodilatation.", 
    "5": "The symptomatic, electrocardiographic, and circulatory effects of intravenous and oral preparations of propranolol, oxprenolol, and practolol were compared in 16 patients with uncomplicated angina pectoris precipitated by exertion. The method of study included treadmill exercise, double-blind assessment, single-blind analysis, with placebo control and randomized serial comparison of each drug in each patient. The doses used were selected to give the same near-maximum suppression of the heart rate response to exercise. The symptomatic, electrocardiographic, and circulatory response of each patient to both preparations of each of the three drugs was similar. Exercise tolerance was increased in two-thirds, unchanged in one-sixth, and significantly worsened in one-sixth of the studies. Electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischaemia was conspicuously reduced by all three drugs in most studies irrespective of their symptomatic effects. Though the exclusive choice of patients, the single dose design of the trial, and the treadmill method of assessment limit the general application of these results, they do clearly indicate that in doses that induce equal suppression of the exercise heart rate these three drugs have similar distinct anti-anginal activity. Their ancillary pharmacological properties are probably of little importance in this respect. Equally, the similarity in the symptomatic, circulatory, and electrocardiographic response to the intravenous and oral preparations suggests that metabolic breakdown products are probably of therapeutic importance only in so far as they antagonize beta-receptor activity."
