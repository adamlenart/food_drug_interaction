Consequently, the trial was stopped after two years. Ninety-five percent of the measurements of the AAA were measured within 2 mm variation.

    "9": "It is unknown whether there are regional differences in the change of atrial effective refractory period (ERP) after a short duration of rapid atrial pacing. Furthermore, the effects of calcium channel and potassium channel on this phenomenon have not been extensively investigated. In opened-chest dogs, the endocardial monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) from the right atrial appendage, and ERP from seven atrial sites were measured before and after rapid atrial pacing at 800 beats/min for 30 minutes. Both atrial ERP and APD90 significantly shortened after rapid atrial pacing. The postpacing atrial ERP and APD90 shortening persisted for 119 +/- 3 and 123 +/- 4 seconds after cessation of pacing, respectively. There was no significant difference in the magnitude or recovery course of atrial ERP shortening after pacing among the seven atrial sites. Pretreatment with nicorandil and d-sotalol had no effects on the magnitude or recovery course of atrial ERP shortening after pacing. However, the degree of ERP and APD90 shortening after pacing was significantly attenuated in the verapamil and ryanodine groups; furthermore, the recovery of ERP and APD90 after cessation of pacing was faster in the two groups. In conclusion, shortening of atrial ERP induced by short-duration rapid atrial pacing was uniform in both atria. Both the adenosine triphosphatase (ATP) dependent potassium current and rapid component of the delayed rectifier did not significantly influence this phenomenon, but both the verapamil and ryanodine could significantly attenuate the degree of atrial ERP and APD90 shortening.", 
    "10": "The combination of calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers is more effective for the treatment of exercise-induced angina pectoris than beta-blocker monotherapy. As ischemia in exercise-induced angina is essentially preceded by an increase in heart rate, calcium channel blockers with a negative chronotropic property may perform better for this purpose than nonchronotropic compounds. A 335-patient, 10-week, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of amlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg, diltiazem 200 mg and 300 mg, and mibefradil 50 mg and 100 mg treatment added to baseline beta-blocker treatment was performed. Exercise testing (ETT) was performed by bicycle ergometry. All of the calcium channels blockers significantly delayed the onset of 1 mm ST-segment depression on ETT (p < 0.001 for any treatment vs. baseline). In addition, mibefradil, in both low- and high-dose treatments, produced the largest delays (low dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 24.1 and 29.8 seconds, respectively, p < 0.003 and < 0.001; high dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 33.7 and 37.0 seconds, respectively, p < 0.001 and < 0.001). A stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that this beneficial effect of calcium channel blockers was largely dependent on their effect on heart rate. Serious symptoms of dizziness likewise occurred significantly more frequently on mibefradil (p < 0.05 vs. diltiazem) and urged no fewer than 19 patients on mibefradil to withdraw from the trial. The authors conclude that calcium channel blockers with a negative chronotropic property provide a better delay of ischemia in patients with exercise-induced angina, but the concomitant risk of intolerable dizziness may reduce this benefit.",

    "15": "Exposure to long-term simulated microgravity exhibits reduced sympathetic nervous system activity. This study tested the hypothesis that the hypersensitivity of adrenoreceptors would explain partly many other features of the hemodynamic consequences of return from space. The biochemical properties of the beta adrenoreceptors (betaAR) were determined using 125I-cyanopindolol (125I-CYP) binding in three rat groups: (1) The first experimental group consisted of 24 h-restrained orthostatic rats in the horizontal position, to test the early effect of the attachment to the suspension device; (2) the second experimental group consisted of 24 h-restrained antiorthostatic rats, to test the early effect of the suspension; (3) the third experimental group consisted of 14 day-restrained antiorthostatic rats, to test the long term effect of the suspension. The study was performed in two organs involved in blood pressure regulation, i.e. the heart (atria and ventricles were separated) and kidneys. The Scatchard analysis of 125I-cyanopindolol binding in both organs indicated no significant alterations in the dissociation constant (Kd) and the maximum binding capacity (Bmax) in the three experimental groups. These results do not allow the conclusion about the SNS adaptation pattern to simulated microgravity. Thus, the hypothesis that betaAR are involved in the cardiovascular adaptation to simulated microgravity is not verified in this model where, as a matter of fact, cardiovascular deconditioning is not verified even if this model is widely used.", 
    "16": "Airway epithelium and vascular endothelium modulate the tension of the underlying smooth muscle by releasing relaxing factors such as prostanoids and nitric oxide (NO). We investigated whether the relaxant effect of propofol on airway smooth muscle is dependent on airway epithelial function. Tracheal spirals of female guinea pigs were mounted in water-jacketed organ baths filled with Krebs-bicarbonate buffer aerated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 degrees C. Changes in isometric tension of the specimens were measured with a force-displacement transducer and recorded with a polygraph. Propofol (10(-4) to 10(-3) M) inhibited carbachol (CCh)-, histamine (HA)-, or endothelin-1-induced contractions of the muscles in a dose-dependent manner. Neither mechanical removal of the epithelial layer, chemical inhibition of epithelial synthesis of prostanoids, nor NO affected the relaxant effect of propofol on CCh- or HA-induced tracheal contraction. Furthermore, the blockade of beta-adrenoceptors did not change the relaxant effect of propofol. These results indicate that the relaxant effect of propofol on the airway smooth muscle is independent of the epithelial function or beta-adrenoceptor activity. Propofol is an excellent anesthetic for patients with hyperreactive airways in which the epithelial layer is damaged.", 
    "17": "Airway epithelium, as well as vascular endothelium, plays an important role in modulating the baseline tone and reactivity of underlying smooth muscle.

    "18": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus often develop micro- and macrovascular complications. In 25% of them, complications are already present at the time of diagnosis. The principal objective of the United Kingdom prospective diabetes study was to determine if good blood glucose control and adequate treatment of hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can prevent development of diabetes-related complications. The question was also studied if they way in which this blood glucose control was achieved and the way of treating the blood pressure affected the prognosis. Blood glucose control was found to reduce the incidence of--especially--microvascular complications. Oral hypoglycaemic agents and insulin both play an important part in achieving good control. Treatment with metformin reduced mortality due to cardiovascular disease in obese patients. Strict control of the blood pressure reduced development of micro- and macrovascular complications; the mortality from diabetes-related disorders and the numbers of patients suffering a stroke or heart failure. Non of the antihypertensive drugs used (an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocking agent) offered any advantages over the other.",

Moreover, there was no difference between the two groups in the kind of positive response to tilting test, in heart rate at tilting (minimum, maximum, delta and slope of increase), and in the minimum, maximum and slope of heart rate increase before syncope. Delta heart rate before syncope was 15 b/min in Group 1, and 28 b/min in Group 2 (p = 0.011). Taking a discriminant value of 20 b/min, 100% sensitivity and 68% specificity were found.",

Diurnal ambulatory BP measurements with an automatic cuff-inflation device and polysomnography with simultaneous Finapres BP recording were performed separately on consecutive days at the end of two 21-day treatment periods involving placebo followed by celiprolol (200 mg/day). Age was 59 +/- 2.5 yr (m +/- sem) and body mass index 33.2 +/- 2.3 kg. m-2. Diurnal ambulatory BP was significantly lower with celiprolol than with placebo (systolic 139 +/- 4 vs 152 +/- 5 mmHg, diastolic 86 +/- 2 vs 96 +/- 2 mmHg). The apnea-hypopnea index was similar under celiprolol and placebo (48 +/- 7.4 vs 53 +/- 7.8, respectively), as were the total sleep time and percent of duration of the different sleep stages. Individual average BP values were significantly lower during REM sleep under celiprolol but remained similar under celiprolol and placebo in the other sleep stages. Variability of nocturnal BP (assessed by the SD of distribution of BP variations) was not affected by celiprolol. In conclusion, celiprolol which decreased daytime BP, did not affect sleep pattern or respiratory disturbances, or nocturnal BP variability related to apnea.", 
    "24": "Tremendous strides have been made in recent years in the treatment and prevention of sudden cardiac death. Large scale trials have now established several interventions that may improve survival in patients susceptible to sudden cardiac death. In patients who have had a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia, the current therapy of choice is an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. For prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death in patients without a previous event, several approaches should be considered. Beta-Adrenergic blocking agents are an effective pharmacologic therapy in patients following myocardial infarction, and their efficacy has also most recently been demonstrated in patients with congestive heart failure. There is no Vaughan Williams class I or III antiarrhythmic drug that has demonstrated efficacy as a prophylactic agent to reduce mortality in these populations, with the possible exception of amiodarone. The best therapeutic approach for prophylactic therapy to prevent sudden cardiac death appears to be the implantable cardioverter defibrillator; however, its use can be justified only in patients at high risk for developing sudden cardiac death. Further work is needed to identify the high risk populations in which this therapy is warranted.", 
    "25": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurs in 20% to 40% of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and contributes to delayed recovery, increased length of stay, and increased hospital cost. Measures at preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation have had mixed results. We report a double-blind trial comparing oral amiodarone with placebo for the prevention of atrial fibrillation after CABG.", 
    "26": "All patients undergoing CABG were considered eligible. Exclusion criteria included bradycardia (<50 beats/min), prior Atrial fibrillation, concurrent therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs, or concomitant valve surgery. Patients were given 2 g of amiodarone (73 patients) or placebo (70 patients) in divided doses 1 to 4 days before surgery and 400 mg daily for 7 days postoperatively. Atrial fibrillation occurred in 24.7% (18 of 43) of patients receiving amiodarone and 32. 8% (23 of 70) of patients receiving placebo (P =.30). Heart rate at onset of atrial fibrillation was 133.4 +/- 26.6 beats/min for amiodarone compared with 152.9 +/- 31.6 beats/min for placebo (P =. 04). Duration of atrial fibrillation was 10.2 +/- 8.1 hours for amiodarone compared with 16.2 +/- 27.5 hours for placebo (P =.67). Patients receiving both beta-blockade and amiodarone had a 16.7% incidence of atrial fibrillation compared with 31.9% in the remaining patients (P =.10). Atrial fibrillation was associated with an increased cost of $7011 compared with those who remained in sinus rhythm ($23,869 +/- $20,894 vs $16,857 +/- $5401 in sinus rhythm). Hospital cost of those taking amiodarone was $18,895 +/- $13,267 compared with $18,839 +/- $11,537.18 for placebo (P =.42).",

    "28": "Only some patients show a substantial hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) reduction after propranolol, which makes it desirable to investigate drugs with greater portal hypotensive effect. The aim of this study was to investigate whether carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker with anti-alpha1-adrenergic activity, may cause a greater HVPG reduction than propranolol. Thirty-five cirrhotic patients had hemodynamic measurements before and after the random administration of carvedilol (n = 14), propranolol (n = 14), or placebo (n = 7). Carvedilol markedly reduced HVPG, from 19.5 +/- 1.3 to 15.4 +/- 1 mm Hg (P <.0001). This HVPG reduction was greater than after propranolol (-20.4 +/- 2 vs. -12.7 +/- 2%, P <.05). Moreover, carvedilol decreased HVPG greater than 20% of baseline values or to </=12 mm Hg in a greater proportion of patients (64% vs. 14%, P <.05). Both drugs caused similar reductions in hepatic and azygos blood flows, suggesting that the greater HVPG decrease by carvedilol was because of reduced hepatic and portocollateral resistance. Propranolol caused greater reductions in heart rate and cardiac output than carvedilol, whereas carvedilol caused a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure (-23.1 vs. -11%, P <.05). Thus, carvedilol has a greater portal hypotensive effect than propranolol in patients with cirrhosis, suggesting a greater therapeutic potential. However, it causes arterial hypotension, which calls for careful evaluation before its long-term use.", 
    "29": "The effects of concomitant P1-receptor stimulation on peak intracellular Ca2+ release by extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were investigated in cultured airway smooth-muscle (ASM) cells. The results show that peak Ca2+ release to ATP is enhanced by preincubation with adenosine (ADO) and with the specific A3 receptor agonist 1-Deoxy-1-(6-([(3-iodophenyl)methyl] amino)-9H-purin-9-yl)-N-methyl-beta-D-ribofuranuronamide (1B-MECA). The response to 5-HT, a smooth-muscle contractile agonist, was also enhanced after preincubation with ADO. Further measurements showed that this enhancement of the response to ATP was dependent on extracellular calcium because it was abolished by the removal of Ca2+ from the extracellular fluid and by incubation with the calcium channel blocker nifedipine. In addition, there was no difference between the levels of total inositol phosphates measured in the presence of ATP alone or of ADO + ATP. AACOCF3, a specific blocker of phospholipase A2, decreased the peak Ca2+ response to ATP and abolished the enhanced response to ATP and 5-HT produced by ADO. We conclude that stimulation of P1 and P2 receptors in ASM cells activates not only phospholipase C but also phospholipase A2. The enhancement of ATP-induced and 5-HT-induced Ca2+ release is due to Ca2+ influx from the extracellular fluid through a Ca2+ channel presumably modulated by arachidonic acid. These data show that endogenous ADO may modulate airway hyperresponsiveness by enhancing the ASM response to contractile agonists.", 
    "30": "1. The NANC neuronal mechanisms for relaxations of the rat internal anal sphincter in response to electrical field stimulation (EFS) were studied in isolated preparations in the presence of atropine (1 microM), propranolol (3 microM) and phentolamine (3 microM). 2. EFS-induced relaxations were abolished by tetrodotoxin (1 microM) and reduced to 64% of control by the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1 microM), but were not significantly reduced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (100 microM) or oxyhaemoglobin (10 microM). However, in the presence of tubocurarine (10 microM) or apamin (0.1 microM), L-NAME or oxyhaemoglobin greatly reduced or abolished EFS-induced relaxations. 3. The EFS-induced relaxations were mimicked by NO (10-100 microM) and by ATP (3-10 mM). The relaxations elicited by these agents were not affected by tetrodotoxin, L-NAME, tubocurarine or apamin. However, ATP-induced relaxations were reduced by the combination of L-NAME with tubocurarine or apamin. 4. Nicotine (10-100 microM) produced concentration-dependent relaxations that were abolished by tubocurarine (10 microM) or hexamethonium (200 microM). After desensitisation to nicotine (100 microM) and in its continued presence, the addition of L-NAME (100 microM) resulted in almost complete abolition of EFS-induced relaxations. 5. It is suggested that tubocurarine, hexamethonium and desensitisation to nicotine have an apamin-like action in the rat internal anal sphincter, the main effect being blockade of a purinergic component of the relaxant transmission process. 6. The findings suggest that both nitrergic and purinergic transmissions are involved in EFS-induced NANC relaxations of the rat internal anal sphincter, and there appears to be a complex interaction between these two pathways of transmission.", 
    "31": "1. The effects of NPY and related peptides were examined on basal contractile force and nerve-mediated inotropic responses to electrical field stimulation of the guinea-pig isolated left atrium. 2. Electrical field stimulus (EFS)-inotropic response curves were constructed by applying 1-64 trains of four field pulses (200 Hz, 0.1 ms duration, 100 V) across isolated left atria (paced at 4 Hz, 2 ms, 1-4 V) within the atrial refractory period. Curves were constructed in presence of vehicle, propranolol (1 microM) or atropine (1 microM) to determine appropriate stimulus conditions. 3. The effects of PYY (1-10,000 nM), NPY (0.01-10 microM), N-Ac-[Leu28,31]NPY(24-36) (N-A[L]NPY(24-36); 0.01-10 microM) and clonidine (0.1-1000 nM) were examined on the positive and negative inotropic responses to EFS (eight trains, four pulses per refractory period). 4. NPY-related peptides had no effect on basal force of contraction nor on the inotropic concentration-response curves to bethanechol or isoprenaline. All three peptides inhibited vagally-mediated negative inotropic responses; rank order of potency PYY>NPY> or =N-A[L]NPY(24-36) was consistent with an action at prejunctional Y2-receptors. Clonidine concentration-dependently inhibited sympathetic inotropic responses. However, PYY, NPY and N-A[L]NPY(24-36) failed to mediate any significant inhibition of the positive inotropic response to EFS. 5. These data demonstrate that NPY is an effective inhibitor of vagal but not sympathetically-mediated inotropic responses in the guinea-pig isolated left atria. This may suggest that endogenously co-released NPY is important in mediating cross talk between efferent components of the autonomic nervous system modulating cardiac contractility, acting overall to sustain positive inotropic responses.", 
    "32": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of timolol hemihydrate 0.5% (Betimol [THH], Ciba Vision Ophthalmics) and timolol maleate gel forming solution 0.5% (Timoptic-XE , [TXE], Merck, Inc.), when both are dosed once daily on the exercise performance. Maximum exercise heart rate reflects systemic beta-blockade activity. Fourteen healthy subjects were randomized to receive either placebo (HypoTears , Ciba Vision Ophthalmics), THH, or TXE by a Latin square technique in a three period crossover design. Subjects were dosed one drop every morning beginning three days before exercise testing. The interval between each test was one week. Exercise testing was performed two hours after dosing. Maximum exercise heart rate showed no statistical difference between TXE and THH (174 +/- 13.1 vs. 172 +/- 14.9 beats/min, respectively, P = 0.72). Both active treatments, however, decreased heart rate compared to placebo (185 +/- 7.3 beats/min, P = 0.017). Time to exhaustion showed no difference between groups (P > 0.10). The double product (product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure) did not show a difference between TXE and THH (P = 0.38) but was reduced compared to placebo (P = 0.0053). One subject on TXE was discontinued from the study after the first exercise test because of secondary heart block during the recovery period. It was concluded that TXE and timolol hemihydrate solution show similar systemic beta-blockade activity when both are dosed once a day.", 
    "33": "The effect of topical 0.1% amosulalol on tissue circulation in the albino rabbit optic nerve head (ONH) was investigated using a laser speckle tissue circulation analyzer. Amosulalol was administered into one eye twice daily for 20 days, and vehicle was administered into the other eye in a masked, randomized manner. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured every 5 days. The normalized blur value (NB), a quantitative index of tissue blood flow velocity in the ONH, was measured before treatment and 2 hours after the last instillation on day 20. The IOP was also measured at 5-day intervals. Amosulalol decreased IOP by approximately 2 mmHg in the treated eyes (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in NB between eyes before the first instillation, whereas NB was significantly greater (by approximately 16%) in the amosulalol-treated eye than in the control eye after completion of instillations (P < 0.01). The difference between NB after completion of instillations and that before the first instillation was significantly greater in the ONH of the amosulalol-treated eye than in the contralateral control eye (P < 0.01). Twice-daily instillation of 0.1% amosulalol for 20 days induced a significant increase in tissue blood velocity in the ipsilateral ONH in albino rabbits.", 
    "34": "Unstable angina comprises a heterogeneous population of patients who present with a wide spectrum of underlying pathophysiology. The traditional treatment of these patients is based on both evidenced-based medicine as well as clinical experience. Despite the large population of patients admitted with this diagnosis, the scientific literature regarding its treatment is scarce. Therefore, the management of patients with unstable angina relies heavily on the clinical skills of the physician. One of the most important steps in this process involves risk stratification, especially in the current environment of cost containment. Those patients who are at low risk for adverse outcomes can be treated and evaluated safely as outpatients. Patients at high or moderate risk, however, should be treated intensively as inpatients. Although there appear to be many new promising therapies for unstable angina on the horizon, the traditional therapies still have a place. The use of aspirin in this population is well supported by the literature and appears to have a positive effect on mortality and cardiovascular events. The other traditional therapies, however, are not as well supported by the literature. They do appear to benefit the patient in terms of reducing symptoms, but their effects on reducing mortality and cardiovascular events are not clear. Therefore, the goal of medical therapy in this patient population should be to stabilize them so that they can proceed with an appropriate risk stratification procedure as soon as possible. This is especially true with performing coronary angiography or interventions because the risk of procedural complications is higher in patients with unstable angina and ongoing symptoms.", 
    "35": "The possible existence of atypical beta-adrenoceptors in vascular smooth muscle of rat isolated thoracic aorta was investigated. Isoprenaline (10(-8)-10(-4) M) produced concentration-dependent relaxation of phenylephrine (10(-5) M) precontracted rings of endothelium-denuded rat aorta in vitro. Isoprenaline-induced relaxation was resistant to blockade by atenolol (10(-6) M). But, propranolol (2 x 10(-7) M) caused a non-competitive inhibition and SR 59230A (6.6 x 10(-6) M), a beta3-adrenoceptor selective antagonist, failed to produce additional antagonism in presence of propranolol. BRL 37344 (10(-8)-10(-4) M), a beta3-selective agonist, did not relax ring segments precontracted with phenylephrine (10(-5) M) in the absence of endothelium. The non-conventional partial agonist (-)-cyanopindolol (5 x 10(-6)-10(-4) M) induced a marked relaxation in phenylephrine (10(-5)M) precontracted aortic rings without endothelium. This vasodilation was resistant to blockade by propranolol (2 x 10(-7) M) and SR 59230A (10(-5) M). Salbutamol (10(-8)-10(-4) M) produced concentration-dependent relaxation in isolated endothelium-denuded aortic rings precontracted with phenylephrine (10(-5) M). Propranolol (2 x 10(-7) M), but not atenolol (10(-6) M), inhibited this relaxant response. It is concluded that in endothelium-denuded thoracic aorta, salbutamol acts through beta2-adrenoceptors whereas isoprenaline seems to activate both beta2-adrenoceptors and an atypical beta-adrenergic receptor. This atypical beta-adrenoceptor is distinct from putative beta3-adrenoceptor and maybe resembles the reported fourth cardiac beta-adrenoceptor.", 
    "36": "The intracellular signaling mechanism of the ischemia-stimulated glucose transporter (GLUT) translocation in the heart is not yet characterized. It has been suggested that catecholamines released during ischemia may be involved in this pathway. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the contribution of alpha-adrenoceptors and beta-adrenoceptors to ischemia-mediated GLUT4 and GLUT1 translocation in the isolated, Langendorff-perfused rat heart. Additionally, GLUT translocation was studied in response to catecholamine stimulation with phenylephrine (Phy) and isoproterenol (Iso). The results were compared with myocardial uptake of glucose analogue [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Subcellular analysis of GLUT4 and GLUT1 protein on plasma membrane vesicles (PM) and intracellular membrane vesicles (IM) using membrane preparation and immunoblotting revealed that alpha- and beta-receptor agonists stimulated GLUT4 translocation from IM to PM (2.5-fold for Phy and 2.1-fold for Iso, P<0.05 versus control), which was completely inhibited by phentolamine (Phe) and propranolol (Pro), respectively. Plasmalemmal GLUT1 moderately rose after Iso exposure, and this was prevented by Pro. In contrast, ischemia-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (2.2-fold, P<0.05 versus control) was only inhibited by alpha-adrenergic antagonist Phe but not by beta-adrenergic antagonist Pro. Similarly, Phe but not Pro inhibited ischemia-stimulated GLUT1 translocation. GLUT data were confirmed by FDG uptake monitored using bismuth germanate detectors. The catecholamine-stimulated FDG uptake (6.9-fold for Phy and 8.9-fold for Iso) was significantly inhibited by Phe and Pro; however, only Phe but not Pro significantly reduced the ischemia-induced 2.5-fold increase in FDG uptake (P<0.05 versus ischemia). This study suggests that alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation may play a role in the ischemia-mediated increase in glucose transporter trafficking leading to the stimulation of FDG uptake in the isolated, perfused rat heart, whereas beta-adrenergic activation does not participate in this signaling pathway.",

We identified a 23% reduction in the odds of death in long term trials (95% confidence interval 15% to 31%), but only a 4% reduction in the odds of death in short term trials (-8% to 15%). Meta regression in long term trials did not identify a significant reduction in effectiveness in drugs with cardioselectivity but did identify a near significant trend towards decreased benefit in drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Most evidence is available for propranolol, timolol, and metoprolol. In long term trials, the number needed to treat for 2 years to avoid a death is 42, which compares favourably with other treatments for patients with acute or past myocardial infarction.",

    "45": "We previously demonstrated that increased dietary salt markedly decreases plasma quinidine concentrations shortly after p.o. dosing, without an effect on the drug's terminal elimination half-life or concentrations after i.v. administration. These findings suggest an effect of dietary salt on intestinal metabolism or transport of the drug. Because one effect of salt loading is sympathetic inhibition, we examined the effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on salt-related changes in quinidine disposition. Furthermore, we examined whether the action of salt is local or systemic by determining the effect of salt loading by the i.v. route. To assess the effect of beta-blockade, quinidine disposition was studied in eight normal volunteers after a single p.o. dose of quinidine; data were obtained after 1 week on a high-salt diet (400 mEq/day) and 1 week on a low-salt diet (10 mEq/day) during chronic nadolol and compared with those previously obtained in the same subjects without the beta-blocker. beta-Blockade had no effect on oral clearance during the high-salt diet [0.28 +/- 0.1 (quinidine + nadolol) versus 0.30 +/- 0.2 liters/h/kg (quinidine alone)] but increased clearance on the low-salt diet from 0.23 +/- 0.1 to 0.29 +/- 0.1 liters/h/kg (p <. 05). For the i.v. salt study, the disposition of single p.o. and single i.v. doses of quinidine was determined on two occasions in eight subjects: once during a low-salt diet (10 mEq/day) and once during the same diet, supplemented by 400 mEq/day NaCl i.v. for 8 days. In contrast to our findings after p.o. salt loading, i.v. salt loading did not alter the pharmacokinetics of p.o. quinidine. Taken together, these data implicate a local alteration of drug-metabolizing activity and/or drug transport in the intestinal mucosa as the major effect of dietary salt on the disposition of p.o. quinidine and further suggest that beta-adrenergic activation by a low-salt diet is one component of a signaling pathway whereby intestinal drug disposition is suppressed, resulting in increased oral bioavailability.", 
    "46": "1. The effect of serotonin (5-HT) on the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (IH) was studied in small-, medium- and large-diameter acutely isolated rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells, including cells categorized as type 1, 2, 3 and 4 based on membrane properties. 5-HT increased IH in 91 % of medium-diameter DRG cells (including type 4) and in 67 % of large-diameter DRG cells, but not other DRG cell types. 2. The increase of IH by 5-HT was antagonized by spiperone but not cyanopindolol, and was mimicked by 5-carboxyamidotryptamine, but not (+)-8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) or cyanopindolol. These data suggested the involvement of 5-HT7 receptors, which were shown to be expressed by medium-diameter DRG cells using RT-PCR analysis. 3. 5-HT shifted the conductance-voltage relationship of IH by +6 mV without changing peak conductance. The effects of 5-HT on IH were mimicked and occluded by forskolin, but not by inactive 1,9-dideoxy forskolin. 4. At holding potentials negative to -50 mV, 5-HT increased steady-state inward current and instantaneous membrane conductance (fast current). The 5-HT-induced inward current and fast current were blocked by Cs+ but not Ba2+ and reversed at -23 mV, consistent with the properties of tonically activated IH. 5. In medium-diameter neurons recorded from in the current clamp mode, 5-HT depolarized the resting membrane potential, decreased input resistance and facilitated action potential generation by anode-break excitation. 6. The above data suggest that in distinct subpopulations of DRG neurons, 5-HT increases cAMP levels via activation of 5-HT7 receptors, which shifts the voltage dependence of IH to more depolarized potentials and increases neuronal excitability.", 
    "47": "The low-frequency to high-frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio) is an index of cardiac sympathovagal balance. We hypothesized that insulin might also stimulate the LF/HF ratio. Thus, 15 lean and 15 obese subjects were studied. Each subject underwent sequential hyperinsulinemic clamps (insulin infusion rate 0.50, 1, and 2 mU/kg x min) while the heart rate was recorded by the Holter technique continuously. Indirect calorimetry allowed determination of the respiratory quotient (Rq) and substrate oxidation. The leg blood flow (LBF), leg vascular resistance (LVR), and plasma norepinephrine concentration were also measured. In seven lean subjects, hyperinsulinemic clamps were repeated along with propranolol infusion (0.1 mg x kg(-1) as an intravenous bolus dose followed by continuous intravenous infusion of 0.5 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) throughout the study). Lean subjects had better insulin action than obese subjects. Insulin infusion was associated with an increase of the deltaLF/HF ratio in both lean (P < .001 for time-dependent changes) and obese (P < .02 for time-dependent changes) subjects; however, the extent of insulin-mediated stimulation of the LF/HF ratio was greater in lean versus obese subjects. Insulin infusion did not significantly affect HF values in both groups. Independently of gender, body fat, changes in the plasma norepinephrine concentration, LBF, and LVR, the deltaLF/HF ratio at the end of the fastest insulin infusion (0.8 +/- 0.2 v 0.3 +/- 0.2, P < .04) was still greater in lean versus obese subjects. The deltaLF/HF ratio was also more stimulated during insulin versus insulin + propranolol infusion in lean subjects. In conclusion, insulin stimulates the LF/HF ratio in both lean and obese subjects and thus produces a shift in the cardiac autonomic nervous system activity toward sympathetic predominance.", 
    "48": "The roles of nitric oxide (NO) in the spinal cord in regulation of blood pressure were examined in anesthetized rats. Intrathecal (i.t.) injection of an inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME), caused marked dose-dependent increase in the blood pressure. The pressor response to L-NAME was attenuated by pretreatment with L-arginine (10 micromol, i.t.). Pretreatment with the ganglionic blocker pentolinium (10 mg/kg, i.v.) and alpha1- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists significantly inhibited the pressor response induced by L-NAME. The pressor responses to L-NAME was blocked by pretreatment with the selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP-5) (50 nmol, i.t.), but not by pretreatment with a non-NMDA receptor antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). In addition, the pressor response to L-NAME was reduced by spinal cord transection. These results suggest that L-NAME causes activation of the sympathetic nervous system by reduction of NO in the spinal cord, and that this reduction of NO by L-NAME may activate glutamatergic neurons in the medulla oblongata.", 
    "49": "Although both blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular (LV) mass at initial evaluation predict future cardiovascular risk, the actual BP and LV mass achieved over years of treatment more clearly relate to cardiovascular event rates. Intermittent compliance or noncompliance is the major reason for uncontrolled hypertension and presumably persistent LV hypertrophy. In general, drugs with rapid onset and short duration of action are not desirable because this profile may lead to large variations in BP lowering effect during actual drug intake and rapid disappearance of the antihypertensive effect with missed doses. In addition, intermittent compliance per se introduces the potential for adverse events. For drugs requiring several dose-titrations (e.g., alpha1-blockers), restarting at full doses may lead to excessive drug action and symptomatic hypotension. For other drugs (e.g., short acting beta-blockers or clonidine-like drugs), sudden discontinuation with intermittent compliance may lead to rebound-enhanced sympathetic responsiveness after one to two days, resulting not only in side effects, but also in adverse events, particularly in patients with (silent) coronary artery disease. The rapid onset, short acting dihydropyridines cause intermittent BP control at each dosing, particularly at higher doses. This intermittent control of BP is even more apparent at dosing intervals that are long relative to the duration of action. Thus, sympathetic activation and potential for adverse events can be anticipated at each dosing unless these drugs are being taken frequently at relatively low doses. For diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin I receptor blockers, no adverse effects have been identified with intermittent compliance. Intermittent BP control is, in general, not an appropriate approach to the management of hypertension and introduces additional risks depending on the type of antihypertensive drug. In contrast, drugs with slow onset and long duration of action provide a more consistent effect during actual drug intake and a more persistent effect during short periods of noncompliance.", 
    "50": "In the present study, we tried to determine which beta-adrenoceptor subtypes are involved in the inhibitory regulation of bladder motility in the guinea pig by using in vitro functional analysis. Isoprenaline, norepinephrine and epinephrine decreased spontaneous contractile activity of the bladder concentration-dependently, the rank order of their potency being isoprenaline (pD2 = 7.38)>norepinephrine (6.71)>epinephrine (6.31). Dobutamine was also effective in inhibiting the spontaneous contraction (5.81). However, CGP-12177, BRL37344, salbutamol, and clenbuterol were not effective at the concentration of 30 microM. The concentration response curves of catecholamines (isoprenaline, norepinephrine and epinephrine) were rightward shifted by the presence of atenolol. Schild regression analyses carried out for atenolol against isoprenaline, norepinephrine and epinephrine gave pA2 values of 6.93, 6.78 and 6.69, respectively. The concentration-response curve for isoprenaline was unaffected by 10 microM butoxamine. In the presence of 1 microM propranolol, bupranolol produced shifts of the concentration-response curve for isoprenaline, and the apparent pA2 value for bupranolol against isoprenaline was 5.50. These results suggest that the inhibition of spontaneous contraction of the guinea pig bladder by beta-adrenoceptor agonists is mediated mainly via beta1-adrenoceptor and the effect of isoprenaline is mediated partly via atypical beta-adrenoceptor subtype.",

Inulin (Cin) and para-aminohippurate [PAH (CPAH)] clearance (infusion clearance technique), endogenous (C(Cr)) and calculated (Cockroft-Gault) creatinine clearance, analysis of drugs and their metabolites (HPLC), were performed. Renal haemodynamics and the pharmacokinetics of beta-adrenergic blocking agent, diuretics and the nootropic agent piracetam, respectively, were measured on separate days.", 
    "53": "Cin was significantly (P < 0.01) lower in the healthy elderly subjects [104 (12) vs 120 (14) ml x min(-2) x 1.73 m(-2) in the young], but remained within the normal range (> 90 ml x min(-2) x 1.73 m(-2)). In contrast, C(Cr) was even lower in healthy elderly subjects [95 (24) vs 121 (20) ml x min(-1) in the young], and the Cockroft-Gault clearance underestimated true glomerular filtration rate (GFR) even more seriously [74 (17) vs 122 (16) ml min(-1)]. For atenolol the mean area under the curve (AUC) was similar in both groups [3.16 (0.48) microg x h(-1) x ml(-1) in the elderly vs 3.01 (0.30) in the young], as was the mean maximal plasma concentration [0.42 (0.07) vs 0.44 (0.06) microg x ml(-1)], but the proportion of the drug excreted in urine was marginally (P < 0.025) lower in the elderly. Similar results were obtained for hydrochlorothiazide, whereas no marked differences between the groups were found for triamterene and its metabolite. Furthermore, the pharmacodynamic action of diuretics was not significantly altered in the elderly.",

    "59": "The membrane potential (Um), the main factor of the excitation-contraction coupling, of human allantochorial placental vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) has been previously shown to depend on voltage-sensitive K+ channels. These channels were blocked by high external K+. To characterize other channels which regulated Um, various constrictor or/and vasodilators and channel blockers were used. Serotonin depolarized VSMCs, in normal medium, but induced a more marked depolarization in VSMCs predepolarized by high external K+. This depolarization was inhibited by nifedipine, a blocker of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside (without effect on Um in normal medium), hyperpolarized the predepolarized-high K+ medium VSMCs. This hyperpolarization was inhibited after addition of charybotoxin (a blocker of Ca2+-activated K+ channels) or/and glibenclamide (a blocker of ATP-sensitive K+ channels). A similar effect was obtained with isoproterenol. These results indicated that membrane potential of human placental allantochorial VSMCs was regulated by voltage-gated, Ca2+- and ATP-sensitive K+ channels and by voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.",

No significant differences between study groups were observed in binding to alpha-2 adrenoceptors in any of the six layers of prefrontal cortex or in any of the hippocampal fields. Likewise, there were no significant differences in beta-1 or beta-2 adrenoceptor binding in any of the hippocampal fields between control and major depressive subjects. In contrast, binding to beta-1 adrenoceptors, but not beta-2 adrenoceptors, was significantly lower (-13 to -27%) in most hippocampal fields of schizophrenic subjects as compared to control subjects or to major depressives. Alterations in beta-1 adrenoceptor binding in the hippocampus of schizophrenics provide further evidence for a role of central noradrenergic neurons in the neurochemical pathology of schizophrenia.", 
    "61": "The results of this investigation provides evidence that catecholamine hormones interact with macrophages that are infected with Mycobacterium avium resulting in the induction of IL-10 mRNA and protein. The effect of catecholamine hormones was prevented by treating the cells with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol but not by alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine. The effect of catecholamine stimulation was mimicked by the addition of beta-2 adrenergic agonists and by the addition of cAMP to the infected macrophage cultures. These observations suggest that sympathetic nervous system activation together with microbial infection results in a synergistic interaction that could result in the control of inflammatory processes.",

Xinafoate alone had no significant effect on the specific binding of 125I-cyanopindolol to lung membranes and did not affect the affinity of salmeterol for the beta-adrenoceptor in the absence or presence of xinafoate, respectively (-log concentration that inhibits 50% [IC50] of the high-affinity site, 7.7+/-0.15 and 7.9+/-0.27; -log IC50 of the low-affinity site = 5.6+/-0.44 and 5.3+/-0.28 [n = 4]).",

    "66": "The combination of calcium channel blockers and beta blockers is more effective for the treatment of exercise-induced angina pectoris than beta blocker monotherapy. Since ischemia in exercise-induced angina is essentially preceded by an increase in heart rate, calcium channel blockers with negative chronotropic property may perform better for this purpose than nonchronotropic compounds. A 335-patient, 10-week, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of amlodipine 5 and 10 mg, diltiazem XR 200 and 300 mg, and mibefradil 50 and 100 mg treatment added to baseline beta blocker treatment was performed. Exercise testing (ETT) was performed by bicycle ergometry. Although none of the calcium channel blockers improved duration of exercise or amount of workload, all of them significantly delayed onset of 1 mm ST segment depression on ETT (p<0.001 for any treatment versus baseline). In addition, mibefradil, both low- and high-dose treatment, produced the largest delays (low dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 24.1 and 29.8 s, p<0.003 and <0.001, respectively; high dose: different from diltiazem and amlodipine by 33.7 and 37.0 s, p<0.001 and <0.001, respectively). These effects were linearly correlated to the amount of rate pressure product (RPP) reduction. Serious symptoms of dizziness likewise occurred significantly more frequently with mibefradil (p<0.05) and led 19 patients taking mibefradil to withdraw from the trial. The authors conclude that calcium channel blockers with negative chronotropic property provide better delay of ischemia in patients with exercise-induced angina but that the concomitant risk of intolerable dizziness largely reduces this benefit.", 
    "67": "Large-conductance Ca2+- and voltage-dependent potassium (BK) channels exhibit functional diversity not explained by known splice variants of the single Slo alpha-subunit. Here we describe an accessory subunit (beta3) with homology to other beta-subunits of BK channels that confers inactivation when it is coexpressed with Slo. Message encoding the beta3 subunit is found in rat insulinoma tumor (RINm5f) cells and adrenal chromaffin cells, both of which express inactivating BK channels. Channels resulting from coexpression of Slo alpha and beta3 subunits exhibit properties characteristic of native inactivating BK channels. Inactivation involves multiple cytosolic, trypsin-sensitive domains. The time constant of inactivation reaches a limiting value approximately 25-30 msec at Ca2+ of 10 microM and positive activation potentials. Unlike Shaker N-terminal inactivation, but like native inactivating BK channels, a cytosolic channel blocker does not compete with the native inactivation process. Finally, the beta3 subunit confers a reduced sensitivity to charybdotoxin, as seen with native inactivating BK channels. Inactivation arises from the N terminal of the beta3 subunit. Removal of the beta3 N terminal (33 amino acids) abolishes inactivation, whereas the addition of the beta3 N terminal onto the beta1 subunit confers inactivation. The beta3 subunit shares with the beta1 subunit an ability to shift the range of voltages over which channels are activated at a given Ca2+. Thus, the beta-subunit family of BK channels regulates a number of critical aspects of BK channel phenotype, including inactivation and apparent Ca2+ sensitivity.", 
    "68": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid mediator of inflammation with a wide range of biological activities, including the alteration of barrier function of endothelium. A biological assay combined with high pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry showed that plasma and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) PAF levels in 20 patients with relapsing/remitting or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were significantly higher than in healthy controls (plasma: 3.29+/-4.52 vs. 0.48+/-0.36 ng/ml, p < 0.002; CSF: 4.95+/-6.22 ng/ml vs. 0.01+/-0.04 ng/ml, p < 0.0001). Values were also significantly higher in relapsing/remitting than in secondary progressive (plasma: 5.10+/-4.97 vs. 0.52+/-0.85 ng/ml, p < 0.005; CSF: 8.59+/-6.39 vs. 0.55+/-0.68 ng/ml, p < 0.002). It was also found that both plasma (R2: 0.65) and CSF (R2:0.72) levels were correlated with the MRI number of gadolinium enhancing lesions, which are markers of blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury, whereas their peaks were not correlated with the MRI number of white matter lesions, nor with the expanded disability status score (EDSS) according to Kurtze [Kurtze, J.F., 1983. Rating neurological impairment in multiple sclerosis: an expanded disability scale (EDSS). Neurology 33, 1444-1452]. Both plasma and CSF in patients with relapsing/remitting MS and marked gadolinium enhancement contained the two major molecular species of PAF: 1-0-hexadecyl- (C16:O) and 1-0-octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C18:O). The ratio of the two molecular species was different in the two biological fluids, being PAF C18:0 more abundant in CSF and PAF C16:0 in plasma, indicating a different cellular origin of PAF or different enzymatic processing. These findings suggest that PAF is a significant mediator of BBB injury in the early stages of MS, rather than a marker of its progression and severity.", 
    "69": "The primary goal of the study was to identify the types of catecholamines and the associated receptors which might be involved in the recall of the conditioned NK cell response. Specific catecholamine receptor antagonists were selected to block the conditioned NK cell response at the recall step. The regional contents of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine were determined in the brain of the conditioned animals by using the high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC/ED). Results showed that pre-disruption of the central alpha1-, alpha2-, beta1-, beta2-, D1-, or D2-receptors at the conditioned recall stage, interrupted the conditioned enhancement in NK cell activity. The NE contents at the cerebellum, and DA contents at the striatum and hippocampus, were significantly higher in the brain of the conditioned animals when compared to that of the control animals. These information indicated the possible roles of the central noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in regulating the recall of the conditioned NK cell response.",

This is the predominant isozyme in the human placenta, where it is proposed to protect the fetus from high levels of maternal cortisol. In the present study, we examined the effects of eicosanoids on the activity of 11beta-HSD2 in human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells, a well-established model for placental trophoblasts. Treatment of JEG-3 cells for 24 h with either prostaglandin (PG) E2 or F2alpha attenuated 11beta-HSD2 activity ( approximately 40%). Paradoxically, indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenases, inhibited (approximately 40%) rather than stimulated the activity of this enzyme. This indicated that the arachidonic acid metabolism may be diverted to other pathway(s), the products of which may inhibit 11beta-HSD2 activity. To determine whether the lipoxygenase pathways were involved, the cells were treated with nordihydroguaretic acid (NDGA), a blocker of all three (5-, 12-, and 15-) lipoxygenases. NDGA caused a 3-fold increase in 11beta-HSD2 activity. To further delineate which specific lipoxygenase pathway was involved, the cells were incubated with zileuton, a selective inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase. This resulted in a similar increase in 11beta-HSD2 activity, suggesting that the products of this pathway (e.g., leukotrienes) may be involved. Given that leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is the most biologically active product of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, we treated the cells with LTB4, which inhibited 11beta-HSD2 activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner with a maximal effect (60% reduction) at 10 nM for 9 h. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that 11beta-HSD2 mRNA levels were not altered by the addition of LTB4, PGE2, or PGF2alpha, indicating an effect at the posttranscriptional level. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that prostaglandins and LTB4 are potent inhibitors of 11beta-HSD2 activity in JEG-3 cells, suggesting that placental 11beta-HSD2 activity is modulated by these locally produced eicosanoids. This is the first time that the products of arachidonic acid metabolism have been found to regulate the activity of 11beta-HSD2.",

Administration of additional doses of sotalol did not result in any additional change in tau, but maximum dP/dt increased, and maximum dP/dt after administration of the final dose of sotalol was significantly higher than maximum dP/dt after administration of the first dose. There were no significant changes in mean systolic aortic pressure.", 
    "80": "In healthy dogs, sotalol did not have any negative effect on myocardial relaxation beyond those attributable to its beta-blocking properties, despite an increase in intracellular ionized calcium concentration, as suggested by an increase in maximum dP/dt after an initial decrease.", 
    "81": "The putative role of voltage-dependent Na+ channels for glucose induction of rhythmic Ca2+ signalling was studied in mouse pancreatic beta-cells with the use of the Ca2+ indicator fura-2. A rise in glucose from 3 to 11 mM resulted in slow oscillations of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). These oscillations, as well as superimposed transients seen during forskolin-induced elevation of cAMP, remained unaffected in the presence of the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin. During exposure to 1-10 microM veratridine, which facilitates the opening of voltage-dependent Na+ channels, the slow oscillations were replaced by repetitive and pronounced [Ca2+]i transients arising from the basal level. The effects of veratridine were reversed by tetrodotoxin. The veratridine-induced [Ca2+]i transients were critically dependent on the influx of Ca2+ and persisted after thapsigargin inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. Both tolbutamide and ketoisocaproate mimicked the action of glucose in promoting [Ca2+]i transients in the presence of veratridine. It is suggested that activation of voltage-dependent Na+ channels is a useful approach for amplifying Ca2+ signals for insulin release.",

    "83": "56 patients, mean blood pressure 161/98 mm Hg, entered the rotation, of whom 36 received all four monthly cycles of treatment with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (A), beta-blocker (B), calcium-channel blocker (C), and diuretic (D). Each patient's best drug was then repeated to assess repeatability. Two measures of individual variability in response were used. First, the value of rotation was measured by the increased proportion of patients reaching target blood pressure on their best drug versus their first drug. Second, we assessed whether the responses to each drug were correlated with each other.", 
    "84": "Significant variability in response was found. 20 of the 41 patients reaching target blood pressure (< or =140/90 mm Hg) failed to achieve this target on their first drug. Rotation increased from 22/56 (39%) to 41/56 (73%) the success of monotherapy (p=0.0001); in half the patients, blood-pressure on the best treatment was 135/85 mm Hg or less. There were significant correlations between the blood pressure responses to A and B (r=0.5, p<0.01), and C and D (r=0.6, p<0.001), but not between the other four pairings of treatments. The responses to the AB pair were, on average, at least 50% higher than those to the CD pair; this difference was highly significant by multivariate repeated-measures ANOVA.", 
    "85": "There is a marked variability in hypertensive patients' response to different antihypertensive drugs. The basis may be underlying variability in types of essential hypertension. Optimisation of treatment requires systematic rotation through several therapies; however, an \"AB/CD\" rule is proposed in which one of each of the two pairs of treatments is initially selected to abbreviate the rotation in routine practice.",

Systemic blood pressure and pulse rate did not differ significantly after treatment with topical timolol from values after placebo. The mean change from baseline in Doppler broadening was 10.6% greater after treatment with timolol than after placebo. There was no significant change in mean Doppler broadening from baseline after treatment with either timolol or placebo. However, optic nerve head capillary blood speed increased in six patients, and was within the range of placebo response in six patients after treatment with timolol. Spearman correlation analysis of the baseline with Doppler broadening measurements after treatment showed a correlation for placebo but not for timolol. The percent change in Doppler broadening after timolol treatment was correlated with iris color.", 
    "89": "These results indicate that administration of timolol for 4 weeks reduces IOP in patients with ocular hypertension and generally does not change the blood circulation in the optic nerve head. Individual patients, however, showed variable changes in optic nerve head circulation after topical administration of timolol.

The present study determined if celiprolol, an antihypertensive agent with selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist and additional beta2-agonistic properties, administered by gavage either acutely (3 hr) or chronically (14 d), had a direct effect on improving glucose tolerance and insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity (using 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake) in isolated epitrochlearis muscles of the insulin-resistant obese Zucker rat. The effects of a selective beta1-blocker, metoprolol, were also assessed. Acute administration of celiprolol, but not metoprolol, increased insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake in muscle by 22% (p<0.05). Chronic celiprolol treatment significantly lowered fasting plasma insulin (22%) and free fatty acids (40%) in comparison to obese control values. Moreover, chronic celiprolol administration decreased the glucose-insulin index (calculated as the product of the glucose and insulin areas under the curve during an oral glucose tolerance test), by 32% (p<0.05) compared to obese controls, indicating that peripheral insulin action was increased. Indeed, insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle 2-DG uptake was enhanced by 49% (p<0.05) in these celiprolol-treated obese animals. Metoprolol was without significant effect on any of these variables following chronic administration. These findings indicate that, in this animal model of insulin resistance, the beta1-antagonist/beta2-agonist celiprolol has a specific effect of improving insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose transport that is independent of any hemodynamic alterations.",

The effects of venlafaxine on brain 5-HT levels in vivo have not yet been examined. Acute administration of venlafaxine to rats by i.p. injection resulted in dose-dependent increases in cortical and hippocampal 5-HT levels, as measured by in vivo microdialysis, over the range 5-20 mg/kg. The effect of venlafaxine (10 mg/kg i.p.) was potentiated by prior administration of pindolol (10 mg/kg s.c.) in hippocampus but not in frontal cortex. Daily administration of venlafaxine (5 mg/kg i.p.) for 4 weeks did not change basal 5-HT levels in either brain area. The effect of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.2 mg/kg s.c.) to reduce 5-HT levels was unaffected by chronic venlafaxine at this dose, indicating that there was no change in sensitivity of presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors.", 
    "101": "These experiments examined the involvement of alpha1-adrenoceptors in the basolateral amygdala and their interaction with beta-adrenoceptors in modulating memory storage. In Experiment 1, male Sprague-Dawley rats, implanted with bilateral cannulae in the basolateral amygdala, were trained in a one-trial inhibitory avoidance task and immediately after training, were given microinfusions (0.2 microl/side) of the selective alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (0.1-1.0 microg). Retention was tested 48 h later. Prazosin induced a dose-dependent impairment in retention performance. In Experiment 2, animals received post-training intra-basolateral amygdala infusions of phenylephrine (a non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonist; 1.0-10.0 microg) alone or in combination with yohimbine (a selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist; 0.2 microg) to examine the effects, on memory storage, of selective alpha1-adrenoceptor activation. Low doses of phenylephrine alone tended to impair retention performance, whereas the highest dose was non-effective. In contrast, phenylephrine infused together with yohimbine induced a dose-dependent enhancement of retention performance, suggesting that a selective activation of alpha1-adrenoceptors enhances memory formation. In Experiment 3, animals received intra-basolateral amygdala infusions of phenylephrine (1.0-10.0 microg) and yohimbine (0.2 microg) in combination with atenolol (a beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist; 1.0 microg). Atenolol blocked the memory-enhancing effects induced by infusions of phenylephrine together with yohimbine. Considered together, these findings suggest that alpha1-adrenoceptors in the basolateral amygdala are implicated in mediating the effects of norepinephrine on memory storage and that their action depends on concurrent beta-adrenoceptor activation.",

    "107": "Metabolic events during ischaemia are probably important in determining post-ischaemic myocardial recovery. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the beta-blocker atenolol and the high energy demand in an ischaemia-reperfusion model free of neurohormonal and vascular factors. We exposed Langendorff-perfused isolated rat hearts to low-flow ischaemia (30 min) and reflow (20 min). Three groups of hearts were used: control hearts (n =11), hearts that were perfused with 2.5 micrograms l-1atenolol (n =9), and hearts electrically paced during ischaemia to distinguish the effect of heart rate from that of the drug (n =9). The hearts were freeze-clamped at the end of reflow to determine high-energy phosphates and their metabolites. During ischaemia, the pressure-rate product was 2.3+/-0.2, 5.2+/-1.1, and 3.3+/-0.3 mmHg 10(3)min in the control, atenolol and paced hearts, respectively. In addition, the ATP turnover rate, calculated from venous (lactate), oxygen uptake and flow, was higher in atenolol (11.2+/-1.7 micromol min-1) and paced (8.1+/-0.8 micromol min-1) hearts than in control (6.2+/-0.8 micromol min-1). At the end of reflow, the pressurexrate product recovered 75.1+/-6.4% of baseline in control vs 54.1+/-9.1 and 48.8+/-4.4% in atenolol and paced hearts (P<0.05). In addition, the tissue content of ATP was higher in the control hearts (15.8+/-1. 0 micromol g(dw)(-1)) than in atenolol (10.5+/-2.6 micromol g(dw)(-1)) and paced (10.9+/-1.3 micromol g(dw)(-1)) hearts. Thus, by suppressing the protective effects of down-regulation, both atenolol and pacing apparently depress myocardial recovery in this model.",

IOP in the treated eyes significantly reduced (P = 0.0005). Bilateral reductions of tissue vascular resistance in the iris were found after carteolol instillation (P = 0.0183 approximately 0.0322). After timolol instillation, serial changes in NB(iris) and NB(cho) in the treated eyes were significantly different from those in control eyes (P = 0.0129, 0.0031), while there were no significant differences at any of time points (Mann-Whitney test); IOP in both eyes was significantly reduced (P = 0.0096 approximately 0.0005); tissue vascular resistance in the iris and posterior choroid showed no significant changes.

    "112": "1. We evaluated if the brain bradykinin (BK) B1 receptor is involved in the regulation of blood pressure (BP) in conscious rats. 2. Basal mean BP and HR were 115 +/- 2 and 165 +/- 3 mmHg and 345 +/- 10 and 410 +/- 14 beats min in Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), respectively. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 1 nmol B1 receptor agonist Lys-desArg9-BK significantly increased the BP of WKY and SHR by 7+/-1 and 19+/-2 mmHg, respectively. One nmol Sar[D-Phe8]-desArg9-BK, a kininase-resistant B1 agonist, increased the BP of WKY and SHR by 19+/-2 and 17+/-2 mmHg, respectively and reduced HR in both strains. 3. I.c.v. injection of 0.01 nmol B1 antagonists, LysLeu8-desArg9-BK or AcLys[D-betaNal7,Ile8]-desArg9-BK (R715), significantly decreased mean BP in SHR (by 9+/-2 mmHg the former and 14+/-3 mmHg the latter compound), but not in WKY. In SHR, the BP response to R715 was associated to tachycardia. 4. I.c.v. Captopril, a kininase inhibitor, increased the BP of SHR, this response being partially prevented by i.c.v. R715 and reversed into a vasodepressor effect by R715 in combination with the B2 antagonist Icatibant. 5. I.c.v. antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) targeted to the B1 receptor mRNA decreased BP in SHR, but not in WKY. HR was not altered in either strain. Distribution of fluorescein-conjugated ODNs was detected in brain areas surrounding cerebral ventricles. 6. Our results indicate that the brain B1 receptor participates in the regulation of BP. Activation of the B1 receptor by kinin metabolites could participate in the pathogenesis of hypertension in SHR.", 
    "113": "1. The effect of the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, terbutaline, was investigated on simultaneously measured force and intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) in intact rat soleus muscle fibres, and on contractile protein function and Ca2+ content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in skinned fibres. 2. Terbutaline (10 microM) had no significant effect on either resting force or [Ca2+]i. Exposure to terbutaline increased both the integral of the indo-1 ratio transient and peak twitch force by 37%. 3. At sub-maximal (10 Hz) stimulation frequencies, terbutaline accelerated force relaxation but had highly variable effects on tetanic force amplitude. The corresponding indo-1 ratio transients were significantly larger, and faster to decay than the controls. 4. Terbutaline increased tetanic force at near maximal stimulation frequencies (50 Hz) by increasing tetanic [Ca2+]i. Force relaxation was accelerated at this frequency with no significant change in the indo-1 ratio transient decay rate. 5. All of terbutaline's effects on force and indo-1 ratio transients in intact fibres were completely blocked and reversed by ICI 118551 (1 microM). 6. Mechanically skinned fibres isolated from intact muscles pre-treated with terbutaline showed no significant changes in SR Ca2+ content, myofilament [Ca2+]i-sensitivity or maximum force generating capacity. 7. The results suggest that terbutaline primarily modulates force by altering the amplitude and decay rate of the [Ca2+]i transient via phosphorylation of both the ryanodine receptor (RR) and the SR pump regulatory protein, phospholamban (PLB). The high variability of responses of slow-twitch muscles to beta2-agonists probably reflects individual differences in basal phosphorylation levels of PLB relative to that of RR.",

All five studies used immediate-release metoprolol twice daily. An extended-release formulation of metoprolol for once-daily use has since been developed. The aim of the present study was to compare the two different forms of metoprolol with regard to the risk reduction of death for 5 years postinfarction and to analyze whether treatment with the beta-blocker metoprolol is associated with a reduced mortality after the introduction of modern therapies such as thrombolysis, aspirin, and ACE inhibitors. All patients discharged after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) from Sahlgrenska University Hospital (SU) during 1986-1987 (n = 740, Period I) and during 1990-1991 (n = 1446, Period II) from both SU and Ostra Hospital, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden, were included in the study. During Period I, 56% were prescribed immediate-release metoprolol compared with 61% prescribed extended-release metoprolol during Period II. Immediate-release metoprolol was not available for outpatient use during Period II. In a multivariate analysis, all variables significantly associated with either increased or decreased postinfarction mortality during Periods I and II (univariate analysis of patient characteristics, medical history, complications during the AMI medication at discharge) studied were with Cox's proportional hazards model. Treatment with immediate-release metoprolol was significantly associated with reduced mortality over 5 years during Period I (relative risk reduction for total mortality, -34%, P = 0.003; 95% CI for RR, 0.51-0.87), and treatment with extended-release metoprolol was significantly associated with reduced mortality during Period II (-34%, P < 0.0001; 95% CI for RR, 0.53-0.82). Thrombolysis and the use of aspirin and ACE inhibitors were more frequently used during Period II. The results showed that postinfarction treatment with extended-release metoprolol given once daily was associated with a similar risk reduction of death over 5 years as immediate-release metoprolol given twice daily. The data, furthermore, indicate that the beta-blocker metoprolol is associated with a reduced risk of death after the introduction of modern therapy such as thrombolysis, aspirin, and ACE inhibitors.", 
    "119": "The ratio between the affinities of beta-blockers for the beta2- and beta1-receptors is often used to predict the cardioselectivity and the potential consequences of blocking beta2-receptor-mediated effects of adrenergic receptor blockers. These ratios have been traditionally determined using various in vitro models of beta2 and beta1-receptor antagonist activity, including isolated organ preparations and radioligand binding in tissues from various species. The data from these studies, while useful, are complicated by the use of different preparations, techniques, and nonhuman models. Recombinant cell lines expressing human beta2 and beta1 receptors have been developed, allowing for the direct comparison of the affinities of the beta-blockers for the beta2 and beta1 receptors under identical conditions, and allowing a precise determination of the beta1-receptor selectivity of the beta-blockers. Bisoprolol, atenolol, propranolol, betaxolol, metoprolol, carvedilol, and ICI 118, 551 were compared for their beta-receptor selectivity using membranes prepared from recombinant cells selectively expressing human beta2 and beta1 receptors. Bisoprolol was found to have the highest selectivity for the beta1 receptor, displaying a beta2/beta1 ratio of 19 (a 19-fold higher affinity for the beta3 receptor than for the beta2 receptor). Atenolol, metoprolol, and betaxolol displayed lower, selectivity for the beta1 receptor, whereas propranolol and carvedilol displayed no significant beta-adrenergic selectivity. ICI 118,55 was selective for the beta2 receptor. The equilibrium dissociation constants of the beta-blockers for the beta1 and beta2 receptors were generally similar to previously reported values.

The etiology of heart failure is different nowadays, with about 60% of the patients suffering from coronary artery disease. Modern treatment of heart failure involves general measures common to all patients, regardless of etiology, phase and NYHA class--etiological treatment, correction of precipitating factors, prevention, diet, programmed exercise and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.

Involvement of the VDCC in ethanol-stimulated beta-endorphin (beta-EP) release from hypothalamic neurons has not been studied. In the present study, the role of VDCC on basal and ethanol-induced beta-EP release was determined by using rat fetal hypothalamic cells in primary cultures. Treatments with a 50 mM dose of ethanol for 3 hr increased immunoreactive beta-EP (IR-beta-EP) release from hypothalamic cells maintained in cultures for 9 days. Ethanol-induced IR-beta-EP release was inhibited by a P/Q-type channel blocker omega-agatoxin TK (0.1-1 microM), an N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin (0.1-1 microM), an L-type blocker nifedipine (1-10 microM), and a T-type blocker flunarizine (1-10 microM). The minimal effective doses of these blockers that blocked the ethanol response produced no significant effects on basal release of IR-beta-EP; neither did these doses of the blockers produce any significant effects on cell viability. These results suggest that ethanol-stimulated IR-beta-EP release is regulated by extracellular calcium involving P-, N-, L- and T-type channels.", 
    "127": "Atenolol use may be associated with growth retardation when given in pregnancy, although the relationship to trimester of initiation, duration of treatment, and its use as monotherapy is still uncertain. To compare the obstetric and fetal outcome between women receiving atenolol (as monotherapy) and other antihypertensive drug monotherapies, and also to investigate the effect of duration of treatment on fetal growth, we performed a retrospective cohort study of 312 pregnancies in 223 women attending an Antenatal Hypertension Clinic. Atenolol (as monotherapy) was given in 78 pregnancies (25.0%), other types of antihypertensive drugs as monotherapy were given in 53 pregnancies (17.0%), and multiple drug combinations were given in 90 pregnancies (28.8%). In 91 pregnancies (29.2%) no antihypertensive drugs were given. Atenolol was found to be associated with lower birth weight and ponderal index values, with a trend toward a higher prevalence of preterm (<37 weeks) delivery and small-for-gestational-age babies when compared to other antihypertensive drugs as monotherapy, or to no treatment. The adverse effect of atenolol was more pronounced in women receiving the drug earlier in their pregnancy, and continuing the drug for a longer duration. In conclusion, atenolol should be avoided in the early stages of pregnancy and given with caution at the later stages, as it is associated with fetal growth retardation, which is related to duration of treatment.",

    "131": "The presence of cholinergic innervation of small coronary arteries in the lamb was investigated by measuring choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities and by performing in vitro experiments in a microvascular myograph to establish whether or not there is a cholinergic component in the response to electrical field stimulation (EFS). ChAT-specific activity was present in proximal coronary segments, but was significantly higher in small coronary arteries. AChE-positive ganglia and fibres were distributed within the adventitia and outer third of the media in proximal coronary segments, and dense perivascular nerve plexuses were observed in small coronary arteries. Acetylcholine induced contractions in all preparations examined and relaxations in 20% of the segments contracted with the thromboxane analogue U46619. EFS did not induce neurogenic contractions in lamb small coronary arteries. In the presence of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine, EFS caused frequency-dependent reproducible relaxations that were enhanced by the blocker of cholinergic transmission, botulinum neurotoxin. An inhibitor of AChE, physostigmine, had no significant effect on the relaxations caused by EFS, while both the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine, and the muscarinic M2-receptor antagonist, AFDX 116, enhanced these responses. Blockade of sympathetic neurotransmission with guanethidine or incubation with the P2-receptor antagonist, suramin, abolished the relaxations induced by EFS, whereas propranolol was without effect. Low-frequency EFS caused less relaxation in preparations activated by acetylcholine than in those contracted with U46619, while sensitivity and maximal relaxation induced by adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) were not different in U46619- and acetylcholine-contracted arteries. The presence of the enzymes necessary for both biosynthesis and degradation of acetylcholine and the finding that blockers of cholinergic neurotransmission enhance EFS-induced relaxations suggest that small coronary arteries are cholinergically innervated.",

Kaplan-Meier analyses of the time to an event were performed.

Fasted measurements at 0900, 1200, 1600, and 2200 were similar. There was a negative correlation between blood flow and body size but not age. Follicular phase mucosal flow was less and more reproducible than luteal. Mucosal blood flow was highest in men and lowest in postmenopausal women.

    "141": "Alpha1-adrenoceptor agonists may potentiate relaxation to beta-adrenoceptor agonists, although the mechanisms are unclear. We compared relaxations induced by beta-adrenoceptor agonists and cyclic AMP-dependent vasodilators in rat pulmonary arteries constricted with prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha) or the alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE). In addition, we examined whether differences were related to cyclic AMP- or nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic GMP-dependent pathways. Isoprenaline-induced relaxation was substantially potentiated in arteries constricted with PE compared with PGF2alpha. Methoxamine was similar to PE, whereas there was no difference between PGF2alpha and 30 mM KCl. The potentiation was primarily due to a marked increase in the NO-independent component of relaxation, from 9.1+/-1.7% for PGF2alpha to 55.1+/-4.4% for PE. NO-dependent relaxation was also enhanced, but to a lesser extent (50%). Relaxation to salbutamol was almost entirely NO-dependent in both groups, and was potentiated approximately 50% by PE. Relaxation to forskolin (activator of adenylate cyclase) was also enhanced in PE constricted arteries. Part of this relaxation was NO-dependent, but the major effect of PE was to increase the NO-independent component. Propranolol diminished but did not abolish the potentiation. There was no difference in response to CPT cyclic AMP (membrane permeant analogue) between PE and PGF2alpha, suggesting that mechanisms distal to the production of cyclic AMP were unchanged. Relaxation to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was the same for PE and PGF2alpha, although relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh) was slightly depressed. This implies that potentiation by PE does not involve the cyclic GMP pathway directly. Mesenteric arteries constricted with PE did not show potentiation of isoprenaline-induced relaxation compared to those constricted with PGF2alpha, suggesting that this effect may be specific to the pulmonary circulation. These results clearly show that PE potentiates both the NO-independent and -dependent components of cyclic AMP-mediated relaxation in pulmonary arteries of the rat, although the effect on the former is more profound. We suggest that potentiation of both components is largely due to direct activation of adenylate cyclase via alpha1-adrenoceptors, within the smooth muscle and endothelial cells respectively.", 
    "142": "Pindolol-insensitive [3H]-5-hydroxytryptamine ([3H]-5-HT) binding to rat hypothalamic membranes was pharmacologically and functionally characterized to resolve whether this procedure selectively labels 5-HT7 receptors. Consistent with a previous report, 3 microM and not 100 nM pindolol was required to occupy fully 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors. Remaining [3H]-5-HT binding was saturable (KD, 1.59+/-0.21 nM; Bmax, 53.8+/-3.1 fmol x mg protein(-1)). Displacement of [3H]-5-HT with metergoline and 5-CT revealed shallow Hill slopes (<0.5) but seven other compounds had slopes >0.8 and pKi values and the rank order of affinity were significantly correlated (r = 0.81 and 0.93, respectively) with published [3H]-5-HT binding to rat recombinant 5-HT7 receptors. In the presence of pindolol, 5-HT-enhanced accumulation of [32P]-cyclic AMP was unaffected by the 5-HT4 antagonist RS39604 (0.1 microM) or the 5-ht6 antagonist Ro 04-6790 (1 microM) but significantly attenuated by mesulergine (250 nM), ritanserin (450 nM) or methiothepin (200 nM) which have high affinity for the 5-HT7 receptor. Intracerebroventricular pretreatment with the serotonergic neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, 5,7-DHT, elevated the [3H]-5-HT Bmax 2 fold, indicating that the hypothalamic 5-HT7 receptor is post-synaptic to 5-HT nerve terminals and regulated by synaptic 5-HT levels. These results suggest that, in the presence of 3 microM pindolol, [3H]-5-HT selectively labels hypothalamic binding sites consistent with functional 5-HT7 receptors.", 
    "143": "The antidepressant efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) might be enhanced by co-administration of 5-HT1A receptor antagonists. Thus, we have recently shown that the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100635, blocks the inhibitory effect of an SSRI on 5-HT cell firing, and enhances its ability to elevate extracellular 5-HT in the forebrain. Here we determined whether the beta-adrenoceptor/5-HT1A receptor ligands (+/-)-pindolol, (-)-tertatolol and (-)-penbutolol, interact with paroxetine in a similar manner. Both (-)-tertatolol (2.4 mg kg(-1) i.v.) and (-)-penbutolol (2.4 mg kg(-1) i.v.) enhanced the effect of paroxetine (0.8 mg kg(-1) i.v.) on extracellular 5-HT in the frontal cortex, whilst (+/-)-pindolol (4 mg kg(-1) i.v.) did not. (-)-Tertatolol (2.4 mg kg(-1) i.v.) alone caused a slight increase in 5-HT however, (-)-penbutolol (2.4 mg kg(-1) i.v.) alone had no effect. In electrophysiological studies (-)-tertatolol (2.4 mg kg(-1) i.v.) alone had no effect on 5-HT cell firing but blocked the inhibitory effect of paroxetine. In contrast, (-)-penbutolol (0.1-0.8 mg kg(-1) i.v.) itself inhibited 5-HT cell firing, and this effect was reversed by WAY 100635 (0.1 mg kg(-1) i.v.). We have recently shown that (+/-)-pindolol inhibits 5-HT cell firing via a WAY 100635-sensitive mechanism. Our data suggest that (-)-tertatolol enhances the effect of paroxetine on forebrain 5-HT via blockade of 5-HT1A autoreceptors which mediate paroxetine-induced inhibition of 5-HT cell firing. In comparison, the mechanisms by which (-)-penbutolol enhances the effect of paroxetine on extracellular 5-HT is unclear, since (-)-penbutolol itself appears to have agonist properties at the 5-HT1A autoreceptor. Indeed, the agonist action of (+/-)-pindolol at 5-HT1A autoreceptors probably explains its inability to enhance the effect of paroxetine on 5-HT in the frontal cortex. Overall, our data suggest that both (-)-tertatolol and (-)-penbutolol are superior to (+/-)-pindolol in terms of enhancing the effect of an SSRI on extracellular 5-HT. Both (-)-tertatolol and (-)-penbutolol are worthy of investigation for use as adjuncts to SSRIs in the treatment of major depression.",

Nonspecific renoprotective interventions that have been studied include blood pressure control, antihypertensive medications, and protein-restricted diets. To prepare this article, a MEDLINE search was conducted, followed by secondary and tertiary searches. Research papers were assessed for level of evidence, and graded recommendations were formulated. Protein-restricted diets (to 0.4 to 0.6 g/kg/day) are not recommended for all patients with reduced renal function (grade A). Very low-protein diets of 0.4 g/kg/day should be considered for patients with severe renal dysfunction (serum creatinine of more than 350 micromol/liter; grade A). However, there are concerns about recommending these diets for all patients because of the potential for long-term negative outcomes such as nutritional deficiencies. Target blood pressure for persons with proteinuria of more than 1 g/day should be less than 125/75 mm Hg [mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 92 mm Hg; grade C]. For persons with proteinuria of less than 1 g/day, the target blood pressure should be approximately MAP 98 mm Hg (less than 130/80; grade C). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy is recommended in preference to placebo, conventional, or beta-blocker therapy for renoprotection (grade A). ACEI therapy cannot be recommended above calcium channel blockers in patients with nondiabetic renal disease (grade A).", 
    "145": "The partition coefficient, surface activity and membrane fluidizing/disordering effects of CH-103, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, were compared to those of propranolol and practolol as reference compounds. Changes in membrane fluidity were followed by measuring the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of bull sperm cells with 1-[4-(trimethylammonium)-phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH) as a fluorescence probe. The octanol/buffer (pH 7.0) partition coefficients for CH-103, propranolol and practolol were 32.9, 5.08 and 0.013, respectively; the surface activity of the compounds decreased in the same order. CH-103 and propranolol significantly increased the fluidity of the membrane in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas practolol reduced fluidity. These physicochemical parameters correlated with the effects of these drugs on rat sarcolemmal Ca2+, Mg(2+)-ATPase, a manifestation of their nonspecific membrane activity. Our results suggest that the physicochemical properties of CH-103, similarly to those of propranolol, are the main determinants of its nonspecific membrane activity.",

The cycles that normal hair follicles go through are the metabolically active anagen phase, the catagen transitional phase and the resting telogen phase. Loss of more than 120 hairs daily is called alopecia. Drugs typically cause a diffuse, reversible alopecia by influencing one of the cycles that hair follicles go through. Because hair loss can have many causes, a causal relationship between a suspected drug and hair loss may be hard to prove. The principal categories of drugs that may cause alopecia listed in the literature are cytostatics, anticoagulants, interferons, tretinoid derivatives and lithium carbonate. The Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Foundation LAREB has received reports of alopecia as side effect of antimalarials, beta-receptor blocking agents, sex hormones, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists and anticoagulants.",

The responses of 10 human subjects to four 8-h protocols were compared: 1) isocapnic hypoxia (end-tidal PO2 = 50 Torr) plus 80-mg doses of oral propranolol; 2) isocapnic hypoxia, as in protocol 1, with oral placebo; 3) air breathing with propranolol; and 4) air breathing with placebo. Exposures were conducted in a chamber designed to maintain end-tidal gases constant by computer control. Ventilation (VE) was measured at regular intervals throughout. Additionally, the subjects' ventilatory hypoxic sensitivity and their residual VE during hyperoxia (5 min) were assessed at 0, 4, and 8 h by using a dynamic end-tidal forcing technique. beta-Blockade did not significantly alter either the rise in VE seen during 8 h of isocapnic hypoxia or the changes observed in the acute hypoxic ventilatory response and residual VE in hyperoxia over that period. The results do not provide evidence that changes in sympathetic activity acting via beta-receptors play a role in the mediation of ventilatory changes observed during 8 h of isocapnic hypoxia.",

SCH00013 exerted a positive inotropic effect (PIE) on isolated right ventricular papillary muscles in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 9.2 mumol/l): the relative potency was milrinone > SCH00013 > vesnarinone. The PIE of SCH00013 was not influenced by propranolol, a beta-blocker, and SCH00013 did not affect the activity of cardiac Na+, K(+)-ATPase. The PIE of SCH00013 was partially inhibited by carbachol, a muscarinic receptor agonist, which implies a partial contribution of the cAMP-dependent mechanism to the PIE. SCH00013 inhibited the activity of PDE III selectively, but the potency was weak: the IC50 value was 64.9 mumol/l, which was 46 and 3.9 times less potent than those of milrinone and vesnarinone, respectively. SCH00013 and vesnarinone elicited a moderate decrease in the rate of beating of isolated right atria, while milrinone increased it. SCH00013 markedly prolonged the action potential duration and the effective refractory period with no change in the resting membrane potential and dV/dtmax, an indication that SCH00013 may suppress the activity of delayed rectifying K+ channels. These results indicate that SCH00013, that primarily acts as a Ca++ sensitizer, possesses a weak selective PDE III inhibitory effect. The potential positive chronotropic effect of SCH00013 due to PDE III inhibition may be offset by its effect on K+ channels.",

Immediate direct-current cardioversion should be performed in persons with AF associated with an acute myocardial infarction, chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia, hypotension, severe heart failure, or syncope. Intravenous verapamil, diltiazem, or beta-blockers should be used to slow a very rapid ventricular rate associated with AF immediately. Oral verapamil, diltiazem, or a beta-blocker should be given if a rapid ventricular rate occurs at rest or during exercise despite digoxin. Amiodarone may be used in selected persons with symptomatic life-threatening AF refractory to other drug therapy. Nondrug therapies should be performed in persons with symptomatic AF in whom a rapid ventricular rate cannot be slowed by drug therapy. Paroxysmal AF associated with the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome should be treated with a permanent pacemaker in combination with drugs. A permanent pacemaker should be implanted in persons with AF who develop cerebral symptoms such as dizziness or syncope associated with ventricular pauses greater than 3 seconds that are not drug-induced. Elective cardioversion of AF should not be performed in asymptomatic older persons with chronic AF. Unless transesophageal echocardiography has shown no thrombus in the left atrial appendage before cardioversion, oral warfarin should be given for 3 weeks before elective direct-current or drug cardioversion of AF and continued for at least 4 weeks after maintenance of sinus rhythm. Many cardiologists prefer the treatment strategy, especially in older persons, of ventricular rate control plus warfarin rather than maintaining sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs. Digoxin should be avoided in persons with sinus rhythm who have a history of paroxysmal AF. Older persons with chronic or paroxysmal AF who are at high risk for stroke or who have a history of hypertension and no contraindications to warfarin should receive long-term warfarin to achieve an International Normalized Ratio of 2.0 to 3.0. Older persons with AF who are at low risk for stroke or who have contraindications to warfarin should receive 325 mg of aspirin daily.",

During last years numerous clinical trial have been conduced evaluating the effect of various treatment procedures on clinical endpoints in patients with CHF. The major risk factor for CHF are hipertension and atherosclerotic vascular diseases, and now it is clear that aggressive treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia can be effective in preventing CHF. Treatment strategies for CHF are aimed at preventing and delaying progression of the disease and improving survival. In the treatment of CHF diuretics are at present the first drugs line for patients with fluid retention and are necessary to relieve symptoms but cannot halt progression or improve the prognosis of CHF. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) therapy has been shown to decrease mortality and progression of CHF and should be used early in patients with left ventricular dysfunction whether they have symptomatic or asymptomatic CHF. Digoxin therapy is associated with decrease in the risk of worsening CHF irrespective of rhythm, systolic function, severity of CHF or therapy with ACE inhibitors. In patients with symptomatic CHF due to systolic dysfunction the addition of diuretics and digoxin appears to reducing worsening CHF without improving survival. Other than digoxin oral inotropic agents (amrinone, pimobendan, vesnarinone, ibopamine) increase mortality in patients with CHF and have not improved symptom status and other clinical endpoints during long-term therapy. Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate administrated in combination are less effective alternative to ACE inhibitors. Beta-blockers and particular carvedilol may prolong survival and decrease worsening CHF when used in combination with digoxine, diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Beta-blockers therapy improve hemodynamics, LVEF and functional status patients with CHF and the ideal candidate for this therapy is stable patients with NYHA II-III CHF due to nonischemic cause. Calcium antagonists do not appear to be useful in patients with CHF, although amlodipine and mibefradil appears to be safe for treatment of angina or hypertension in this group. On the basis of current data, antiarrhythmic agents should not be given to patients with CHF free from arrhythmia but those with sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation amiodaron appears to be safe.", 
    "157": "The aim of this study was to investigate abnormalities in lymphocyte membrane sodium fluxes in patients with essential hypertension with and without familial history of hypertension and the influence of selected hypotensive drugs on these fluxes. 121 patients (pts) with positive family histories of primary hypertension (PFH) and 73 pts with negative family histories of primary hypertension (NFH) were examined. The total sodium efflux rate constant (wswc), ouabaine-sensitive (wswou) and furosemide-sensitive (wswf) were measured by the method of Heagerty et al. To examine the influence of selected hypotensive drugs on sodium fluxes wswc, wswou and wswf were measured before and after 7 days of treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (H) or propranolol (P). Wswou was decreased in 61% pts with PFH and in 19% pts with NFH, wswf was decreased in 38% pts with PFH and in 22% pts with NFH. Both, wswou and wswf, were decreased in 49% pts with PFH and only in 2.7% pts with NFH. Wswou and wswf rose significantly after 7 days of treatment with H or P only in pts with PFH and in pts with decreased wswou and wswf before treatment. These data suggest that abnormal lymphocytes membrane sodium transport often occurs in pts with PFH and has familial component. Changes in transport systems observed after 7 days treatment with H or P may contribute, at least in part, to its antihypertensive action in familial hypertension.",

Spontaneously beating guinea-pig isolated atria and the heart rate and blood pressure of anaesthetized cat were employed in the study to compare the beta-blocking efficacy of the two formulations of esmolol using isoprenaline as an agonist. In guinea-pig isolated atria the standard esmolol formulation (Brevibloc) reduced basal atrial rate more significantly than the indigenously formulated esmolol (test formulation). Both the formulations produced similar parallel rightward shift of cumulative concentration response curves of isoprenaline with closely comparable pA2 values. In anaesthetized cats, only indigenous esmolol formulation significantly decreased basal heart rate. Both the formulations did not modify the basal blood pressure and isoprenaline-induced fall in blood pressure, despite significantly blocking isoprenaline-induced tachycardia. It is suggested that both the formulations produced similar degree of beta-1 adrenoceptor blocking activity.",

Two hundred patients with chronic or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter or both, who had failed one to six previous antiarrhythmic drug trials were treated with d,l sotalol 80 to 440 mg/day orally. Fifty four percent was female, age 47 +/- 16 years (range 7-79), follow up period 7 +/- 7 months (range 1 to 14 months), 79% of patients had the arrhythmia for more than one year. The atrial fibrillation in 37.5% of patients was chronic and paroxysmal in 23.5. The atrial flutter was chronic in 31% of patients and paroxysmal in 8%. Eighty two percent of patients was in functional class I (NYHA) and 82% had cardiac heart disease: left atrial (LA) size 44 +/- 10 mm, right atrial (RA) size 37 +/- 7 mm and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 58 +/- 8%. Total success was achieved in 58% of patients (atrial fibrillation 40% and 18% in atrial flutter), partial success in 38% (atrial fibrillation in 18% and 20% in atrial flutter) and 4% of patients failure. It was p < 0.07 when compared total success vs partial success among atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter groups. Patients with cardiac heart disease responded worst (p = 0.10) to the drug than those without it, specially if the heart was dilated.

    "161": "The effects of reproterol, orciprenaline and theophylline (10(-9)-10(-5) M) on spontaneous cAMP (5 x 10(4) cells/30 min)- and on LPS (10 microg/ml)-stimulated LTB4 production (10(5) cells/4 h) were determined in normal monocytes in vitro.", 
    "162": "Production of cAMP (n = 9) was significantly augmented in a dose-dependent manner by orciprenaline (30 +/- 8%) and theophylline (28 +/- 10%), but mostly by reproterol (127 +/- 8%) at 10(-5) M. Despite incubation with propranolol, significant stimulation of cAMP production was notable following reproterol therapy. Production of LTB4 was significantly inhibited by reproterol (-48 +/- 14%) and less by theophylline (-28 +/- 10%), but was stimulated by orciprenaline (+20 +/- 8%) at 10(-5) M.", 
    "163": "We conclude that reproterol exerts a strong stimulatory effect on monocyte cAMP production and a suppressive effect on LTB4 production possibly due to a synergistic mode of action on adenylate cyclase activity and inhibition of phosphodiesterases. More clinical studies in bronchial asthma will be needed to determine whether these results may translate into clinically relevant effects.", 
    "164": "Long-term facilitation of neurotransmission by monoaminergic systems is implicated in the cellular mechanism of memory and learning-related processes at invertebrate synapses. Using whole-cell recording and rat cerebellar slices, we have examined whether mammalian monoamine-containing neurons play analogous roles in synaptic plasticity, and our results suggest that serotonin and noradrenaline are critically involved in short- and long-term modulation of GABAergic transmission in the cerebellar cortex. Exogenously applied serotonin and noradrenaline selectively induced a short-term enhancement of GABAergic transmission between cerebellar interneurons and Purkinje cells, their effect subsiding in 30 min. Successive amine applications converted this effect to long-term facilitation lasting more than 2 h. During the monoamine-induced short- and long-term facilitation, spontaneously occurring miniature inhibitory synaptic responses increased in frequency, without significant changes in their mean amplitude and amplitude distribution, as well as the GABA receptor sensitivity of Purkinje cells. The actions of the two amines on the inhibitory transmission were mimicked by forskolin and blocked by kinase inhibitors, H-7, H-89 and Rp-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate. Thus, serotonin and noradrenaline are likely to activate cyclic-AMP- and protein kinase-dependent pathways in GABAergic interneurons, thereby reinforcing the inhibitory transmission on to Purkinje cells. Repetitive electrical stimulation within the molecular layer mimicked the facilitatory effect induced by exogenous monoamines: namely, neural stimulation selectively elicited long-lasting enhancement of GABAergic transmission in a manner sensitive to the monoamine receptor antagonists, methiothepin and propranolol, and an uptake inhibitor, imipramine. Synaptically released monoamines thus appear to induce cyclic-AMP- and protein kinase-dependent long-term facilitation of cerebellar GABAergic transmission, thereby providing a likely mechanism of synaptic plasticity associated with motor coordination within the mammalian cerebellar system.", 
    "165": "To investigate the effects of beta-blocker (metoprolol) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) treatment on neurohormonal function in a randomized prospective study on patients with heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "166": "Fifty-four patients (42 men and 12 women, mean age 50 years) were studied. There were three patients in NYHA (New York Heart Association) functional class I, 32 patients in class II and 19 patients in class III.", 
    "167": "Measurements of plasma renin activity (PRA). plasma angiotensin II (A II) concentration and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration were made at rest and also in a subgroup (n = 32) during exercise. The urinary excretion of aldosterone was also determined. Investigations were performed at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months. Therapy was then stopped and the patients were re-investigated 1 month thereafter.", 
    "168": "The mean level of PRA was normal at baseline, reduced during therapy with metoprolol, and increased during therapy with captopril. The mean plasma concentration of A II was reduced during exercise and there was a trend towards a reduction even at rest in the metoprolol group, but not in the captopril group. The urinary excretion of aldosterone decreased in both groups. The mean plasma concentration of ANP was elevated at baseline and declined during exercise in the metoprolol group.", 
    "169": "In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and only a partly activated renin-angiotensin system, both metoprolol and captopril reduced urinary excretion of aldosterone. Furthermore, metoprolol suppressed the exercise-induced increase in ANP, suggesting a favourable effect on ventricular performance."
