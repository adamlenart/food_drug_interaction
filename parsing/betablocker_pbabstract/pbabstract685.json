    "0": "Beta adrenergic receptors have been previously characterized in human neutrophil sonicates. In the present study the intact neutrophil has been assessed for the number and affinity of beta adrenergic binding sites by using the antagonist DNA. Agonist and antagonist potencies, characterized by their effect on DHA binding and cyclic AMP accumulation, are compared with agonist inhibition of lysosomal enzyme (beta glucuronidase) release. Criteria for beta adrenergic receptor identification were successfully demonstrated. At 30 degrees C, beta adrenergic binding was rapid (t 1/2 2 min) and reversible (t 1/2 9 min). Receptor binding was saturable, revealing approximately 900 high-affinity receptors per neutrophil with DHA concentrations of 0.1 to 10 nM. By utilizing both equilibrium and kinetic techniques, the KD was determined to be approximately 0.6 nM. Agonists and antagonists competed for DHA binding in a manner consistent with their effect on cyclic AMP generation. Rank order potency was suggestive of a beta-2 receptor: isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. Stereoselectivity was shown by the greater potency of L-propranolol compared to the D isomer. A high degree of receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling efficiency was suggested by the observation that with only 1% receptor occupancy isoproterenol stimulated 50% maximal cyclic AMP generation. Finally, there was an excellent correlation between the isoproterenol concentration which resulted in 50% of maximal inhibition of beta glucuronidase release (Ki) and that causing 50% maximal cyclic AMP stimulation (Kact), suggestive of a close relationship between beta adrenergic-induced adenylate cyclase activation and beta adrenergic regulation of neutrophil lysosomal enzyme release. The data presented suggest that the use of the intact neutrophil for study of the beta adrenergic receptor is feasible and may provide information which is considerably more closely related to modulation of physiological function by neurohormones than is possible with disrupted cell preparations.", 
    "1": "We studied in vitro the presence of histamine and the effect of histamine and its antagonists on cAMP accumulation in parathyroid tissue (parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia) from patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid adenomatous tissue contained 11.2 +/- 2.9 ng histamine/g wet weight (approximately 2 X 10(-5) M), as determined by a specific radioenzyme assay. Histamine caused a prominent increase in cAMP accumulation in parathyroid tissue slices in a dose-dependent manner, with half-maximal stimulation being achieved at 5 X 10(-6) M and maximal stimulation occurring at 10(-4) M histamine. The histamine H2 receptor antagonists, cimetidine and metiamide, caused profound inhibition of histamine-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the parathyroid tissue. Pyrilamine, an H1 antagonist, also inhibited histamine-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, elicited marked elevation of cAMP, and its stimulatory effect was blocked by propranolol, but the effects of histamine on cAMP levels in parathyroid tissue were not blocked by propranolol. Histamine significantly stimulated (an increase of 50%) the release of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone. The present observations demonstrate that parathyroid adenomatous tissue has a relatively high content of histamine, and the release of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone from this tissue. The effects of antagonists suggest that histamine stimulates cAMP accumulation in the parathyroid adenomatous tissue by an action on both H2 and H1 histamine receptors.", 
    "2": "A pharmacological approach was used to investigate serotonergic control of the secretion of pituitary beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-END-LI) in the rat. The administration of 75 or 200 mg/kg L-tryptophan (ip, over 30 min) increased brain serotonin by 17% and 19%, respectively, and increased circulating beta-END-LI from 0.30 +/- .06 to 0.56 +/- 0.7 and 0.64 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, respectively. D,L,5-Hydroxytryptophan (30 mg/kg, ip, over 30 min) produced a 4.9-fold increase in brain serotonin content and a 3.4-fold rise in plasma beta-END-LI. The administration of a serotonin reuptake blocker, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, ip, over 15 min), elevated basal levels of plasma beta-END-LI from a control value of 0.38 +/- 0.02 to 1.21 +/- 0.32 ng/ml. Exposure to ether increased circulating beta-END-LI to 1.08 +/- 0.18 ng/ml, and fluoxetine treatment further increased this rise to 1.69 +/- 0.09 ng/ml (P less than 0.05). Quipazine, a serotonin receptor agonist, evoked a dose-related (2.5-5.0 mg/kg, ip) increase in circulating beta-END-LI levels by 15-45 min post injection. By contrast, intraventricular injection of the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (75 microgram free base, for 10 days) caused a 77% depletion of brain serotonin and attenuated the rise in beta-END-LI levels in response to immobilization (3.28 +/- 0.20 vs. 1.83 +/- 0.25 ng/ml). A higher dose of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (200 microgram free base, for 10 days) significantly decreased resting levels of beta-END-LI from 0.65 +/- 0.14 to 0.36 +/- 0.08 ng/ml. We conclude that brain serotonin neurons exert a stimulatory influence over the basal secretion of pituitary beta-END-LI and mediate, in part, the stress-induced release of this hormone.", 
    "3": "From the trachea, main bronchi and hilus bronchi of guinea pigs, preparations were isolated for registration of mechanical tension on electrical field stimulation and drugs. The trachea contracted on short trains of electrical stimulation. Usually these contractions were followed by a relaxant response. The contractions were abolished while the relaxations were potentiated by atropine. In the main bronchi field stimulation induced a contractile response which was abolished by atropine. In the latter preparation relaxant responses were never observed, even not after atropine. In the trachea and main bronchi neither the alpha 1 blocker prazosin nor the alpha2 blocker yohimbine affected the contractile or relaxant responses when used in alpha-blocking concentrations. The relaxant response in trachea was neither affected by the \"P1 blocker\" theophylline nor by the \"P2 blocker\" quinidine but it was partially inhibited by guanethidine or beta-blocking agents. The hilus bronchi contracted on field stimulation as well as histamine. The contractile response on electrical stimulation was only slightly inhibited by atropine or guanethidine. In all three preparations responses on field stimulation were abolished by tetrodotoxin. It is suggested that in both trachea and main bronchi excitatory cholinergic innervation is present. Further, the trachea but not the main bronchi is innervated by both adrenergic and nonadrenergic inhibitory nerves. The hilus bronchi contains a non-adrenergic non-cholinergic excitatory nervous system.", 
    "4": "Peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with atopy were studied for IgE production in vitro. Addition of a beta-receptor blocking agent (propranolol) to lymphocytes from 9 of 10 patients with low spontaneous IgE production in vitro caused increased IgE production. In 10 tests with lymphocytes from patients, who were undergoing hyposensitization treatment for cat epithelium and/or birch pollen allergy, no spontaneous in vitro production of the relevant antigen-specific IgE antibodies was detected. However, when propranolol was added to the lymphocyte cultures in vitro, production of antigen-specific IgE antibodies was found. No such production was found when lymphocytes from patients who were not allergic to either of these antigens were studied. Szentivanyi's theory of a partial blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors in atopy and a possible linkage between this theory and the hypotheses of disturbed regulatory functions in the immune system of patients with atopy is discussed.", 
    "5": "Dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulators are all able to elicit inotropic effects. alpha- and beta-Adrenoceptor stimulation are known to change each myocardial contraction-relaxation cycle differently. In order to elucidate the myocardial function of cyclic AMP the effects of dibutyryl cyclic AMP on the contraction-relaxation cycle of isolated rat heart papillary muscle were examined and compared to the effects of alpha-and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, respectively. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (in the presence of propranolol) increased developed tension (Tmax) by 18%, rate of tension rise (T'max) by 46%, rate of tension fall (T'min) by 62% and onset-rate of relaxation (T\"min) by 136%. These changes in the contraction-relaxation cycle were strikingly similar to those produced by isoprenaline (beta-adrenoceptor stimulation). The response to dibutyryl cyclic AMP, however, developed much more slowly than did the response to isoprenaline. The latter effect was associated with cyclic AMP elevation in a way indicating a trigger function for cyclic AMP. The alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation (by phenylephrine combined with propranolol), however, increased measures both for contraction and for relaxation by about the same degree, and the effects occurred without changes of cyclic AMP contents. Phenylephrine alone (combined alpha-and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation) elicited a substantial cyclic AMP elevation but gave mechanical effects only slightly different from the pure alpha-adrenergic response. Thus cyclic AMP effects did not seem to be fully expressed in this case. As a whole, the results indicate that the effects of both dibutyryl cyclic AMP and of isoprenaline are mediated by the cyclic AMP-system while alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation involves other mechanisms.", 
    "6": "Various 2-benzodioxinylaminoethanol derivatives were synthetized and investigated for beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Most compounds demonstrated a beta-blocking activity of a competitive type when evaluated in guinea pig atrial and tracheal preparations. Three compounds were more potent than practolol and propranolol. All compounds demonstrated antihypertensive properties in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The most active compound was 1-(1,4-benzodioxin-2-yl)-2-[N4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazino]ethanol (11), which at 2.5 mg/kg iv lowered blood pressure by 41%.", 
    "7": "Metoprolol-treated and untreated rats were subjected to the same treadmill running program for 12 weeks. After training and withdrawal of metoprolol, the treated rats had a more pronounced bradycardia during submaximal exercise than non-treated rats, although they had a lower heart weight/body weight ratio. The intrinsic heart rate (IHR) was slightly but not significantly lower in trained than in untrained untreated animals. The IHR was not altered by a period of metoprolol treatment neither alone nor in combination with training. It is concluded that chronic cardioselective beta-blockade during training augments the training-induced bradycardia but may impair the development of cardiac hypertrophy. The training-induced bradycardia is thus not related to the degree of heart rate increase during exercise for its development.", 
    "8": "1 The ambulant intra-arterial blood pressure of eighteen hypertensive subjects was monitored before and again after 3 months treatment with thrice daily sotalol (six patients), twice daily pindolol (six patients) and once daily pindolol (six patients). 2 Three patients in the sotalol group underwent a third study having changed to a once daily regimen; similarly six patients in the pindolol groups were restudied having crossed over to the alternative pindolol dosing regimen, total daily dosage being maintained in all cases. 3 Comparison of 24 h blood pressure curves before and after treatment showed effective daytime reduction but less consistent effects at night. 4 In the crossover experiments once daily and multiple daily dosing regimens produced identical patterns of reduction over 24 h in both blood pressure and heart rate. 5 It is inferred that in the treatment of hypertension, once daily dosing with standard preparations of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents is probable adequate.", 
    "9": "1 The effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists given intravenously in single doses were examined in a double-blind, placebo controlled study performed in six healthy volunteers. Heart rate and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were measured at rest and during standardised exercise. 2 Atenolol 0.2 mg/kg, betaxolol 0.15 mg/kg, practolol 1 mg/kg and propranolol 0.2 mg/kg all reduced heart rate to a similar extent during exercise at 2 and 4 h after administration; betaxolol 0.6 mg/kg had a significantly greater effect than the other treatments at all times. Only betaxolol 0.15 and 0.6 mg/kg significantly inhibited exercise tachycardia at 24 h. 3 None of the treatments studied had any effect on PEFR at rest or during exercise. 4 A second study was performed to determine whether this lack of effect of propranolol on exercise PEFR could have been due to the warm and humid conditions prevailing during the experiment. Eight healthy men underwent a standardised exercise test under alternately 'warm and humid' and 'cool and dry' conditions before and after propranolol 0.2 mg/kg or saline placebo intravenously. 5 Propranolol treatment did not influence resting or exercise PEFR in either environment, but did reduce FEV1 immediately after exercise under the cool and dry conditions but not under the warm and humid conditions. 6 Comparison of the effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on exercise heart rate and PEFR is not a reliable or sensitive method of measuring the cardioselectivity of these drugs. 7 Environmental temperature and humidity should ideally be controlled when the action of any drug on airflow resistance is being studied.", 
    "10": "The negative inotropic actions of 12 beta-adrenergic blocking agents, all of which are aryloxyisopropylaminopropanols were studied in isolated left atria from reserpinized guinea-pig hearts. At concentrations between 10 and 1000 microM, all these drugs, with the exception of atenolol, reduced the contractile force by more than 40%. The following order of potency, as measured as ED40, was thus derived:propranolol, alprenolol, D-25, Ko 707, pindolol, oxprenolol, K\u00f6 592, befunolol, metoprolol, K\u00f6 1313, acebutolol and atenolol. On the other hand, the order of the octanol/water partition coefficient (P) was as follows: propranolol, alprenolol, D-25, K\u00f6 707, K\u00f6 592, oxprenolol, befunolol, acebutolol, metoprolol, pindolol, K\u00f6 1313 and atenolol. A significant correlation was found between log l/ED40 and log P. The results indicate that hydrophobicity is a major determinant for the negative inotropic effects of these beta-adrenergic agents.", 
    "11": "Yohimbine in doses of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg induced a prolonged graded elevation in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and pulse pressure (PP) in chloralose-anesthetized cats. However, an increased dose of yohimbine of 1.0 mg/kg resulted in a fall in blood pressure which lasted 30 min. All 3 dose levels produced an increase in heart rate (HR) but the response was maximal at 0.5 mg/kg. Therefore, further cardiovascular effects were investigated at this dose level. Propranolol pretreatment abolished yohimbine-induced tachycardia, but had little effect on the pressor response. Guanethidine pretreatment antagonized the tachycardia and converted the pressor response to yohimbine into a depressor one. Both tachycardia and rise in MABP obtained in response to yohimbine were abolished by hexamethonium pretreatment. In C-1 cord sectioned cats, only a transient tachycardia and rise in blood pressure were obtained. Yohimbine also augmented positive chronotropic response to the right cardioaccelerator nerve stimulation. Furthermore, yohimbine completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of clonidine on the positive chronotropic response induced by cardioaccelerator nerve stimulation. Therefore, a major fraction of the observed cardiovascular effects of yohimbine seems to be mediated indirectly via the released catecholamines secondary to the blockade by the drug, of presynaptic alpha adrenoceptors at sympathetic nerve terminals.", 
    "12": "Acute i.v. administration of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist dl-propranolol given in incremental doses (less than 40 mg/kg) did not affect the firing rate of locus coeruleus (LC) neurones in the rat, as revealed by single cell recording techniques. Furthermore, no effect was seen 4 h after a single i.p. dose of this beta-blocker (10 mg/kg). However, repeated treatment with dl-propranolol (1, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg i.p., twice daily for 4 days) produced a significant, dose-dependent decrease of the average LC neuronal firing rate in comparison to controls. The dextro isomer of propranolol, which has negligible beta-blocking activity but the same local anaesthetic potency as the racemate, had no corresponding effect. The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist sotalol, which is one of the most hydrophilic beta-blockers, had much less inhibitory effect on LC neurones than dl-propranolol. The beta 1-selective antagonist metoprolol did not change the firing of noradrenergic neurones in the LC after similar treatment for 4 days. However, when the rats were subjected to oral treatment for 28 days, metoprolol was found to produce a slight inhibitory effect although much less than dl-propranolol. In view of these findings we propose a stimulatory and mainly beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated control mechanism for the noradrenergic neurones in the LC. This mechanism seems to be characterized by a delayed responsiveness.", 
    "13": "Myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) is influenced by the substrate supply to the heart. Utilization of free fatty acids increases MVO2, and catecholamines sensitize the heart to the oxygen-wasting effect of free fatty acids. Alteration of myocardial metabolism from mainly free fatty acid to carbohydrate oxidation reduces the extent of myocardial ischemic injury. Within the ischemic myocardium, lipolysis is stimulated with breakdown of endogenous triglycerides to fatty free acids and glycerol. Antilipolytic agents seem to have a combined effect on myocardial metabolism partly through inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue with reduction of free fatty acid mobilization to plasma, and partly through a local inhibition of lipolysis in the ischemic myocardium. In patients with high sympathoadrenal activity, for example, patients with acute myocardial ischemia in unstable ischemic heart disease, elevation of free fatty acids might effect a critical increase in both myocardial oxygen requirement and infarct size.", 
    "14": "The fetal sheep heart responds to beta-adrenergic stimuli; however, in vivo studies show the response of the fetal heart is less than that of the adult heart. We used [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) to study directly beta-adrenergic receptors in heart particulates of fetal sheep at term and adult sheep. [3H]DHA binding to fetal heart particulates was rapid, reversible (t 1/2 = 2.9 +/- 0.3 min), stereoselective, saturable (101.2 +/- 7.4 fmoles/mg protein), and of high affinity (4.8 +/- 0.4 nM). The rank order of agonists competing for [3H]DHA binding was isoproterenol (0.32 +/- 0.10 microM) greater than epinephrine (1.19 +/- 0.23 muM) approximately equal to norepinephrine (2.67 +/- 0.69 muM), which is compatible with beta 1-adrenergic potencies. [3H]DHA also bound to the adult sheep heart in a manner expected for beta 1-receptors. No difference in the binding affinity of [3H]DHA or agonists' competition was demonstrated between the fetal and adult sheep heart. Comparison of the concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors in fetal and adult hearts was confounded by the choice of the denominator for unit expression. The concentration was higher in the adult when expressed as a function of protein content or 5'-nucleotidase activity (0.52 +/- 0.07 versus 1.12 +/- 0.06). However, there was no difference when tissue weight, Na+ - K+-ATPase, or NaF-stimulated adenylate cyclase was used. Furthermore, isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase and cardiac contractile response to a threshold dose of isoproterenol were identical in the fetal and adult sheep heart. We conclude that beta-receptors can be studied with [3H]DHA in the fetal sheep heart, this receptor is qualitatively similar to the beta-receptor in the adult sheep heart, and it is unlikely that there is a difference in the concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors in fetal and adult sheep heart.", 
    "15": "The response of canine tracheal muscle to autonomic stimulation with 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP) was studied isometrically in 39 dogs in vivo. Intra-arterial (ia) DMPP (2.5 X 10(-4) to 2.5 X 10(-2) mg/kg) caused selective dose related contraction [maximum 30.1 +/- 6.5 gram-force (gf)/cm] due to regional stimulation of parasympathetic ganglia. This contraction was blocked by regional administration of atropine 10(-3) mg/kg ia and hexamethonium 5 X 10(-2) mg/kg ia. Nonselective intravenous (iv) administration of DMPP 2.5 X 10(-2) mg/kg caused parasympathetic tracheal contraction [+13.4 +/- 1.64 gf/cm] followed by later sympathetic relaxation [-11.8 +/- 2.3 gf/cm]; 0.5 mg/kg iv atropine abolished contraction but did not affect relaxation. The role of the adrenal gland vs. direct sympathetic innervation in producing tracheal relaxation after sympathetic stimulation was also studied. Tracheal relaxation to 2.5 X 10(-2) mg/kg iv DMPP was -18.2 +/- 4.0 gf/cm before adrenalectomy (ADX) and -4.3 +/- 0.9 gf/cm afterward (P less than 0.001). In contrast, tracheal contraction resulting from alpha-adrenergic stimulation after 2.5 X 10(-2) mg/kg iv DMPP in beta-blocked (BB) dogs was not significantly altered by ADX. At 2.5 X 10(-1) mg/kg iv DMPP, the alpha-adrenergic contractile response was still 70% of the response prior to ADX. We conclude that sympathetic tracheal relaxation in dogs is predominantly mediated by circulating catecholamine from the adrenal gland, but that alpha-adrenergic contraction after BB results predominantly from direct sympathetic innervation and is not greatly augmented by adrenal secretion. We also report a new method for selective stimulation of airway cholinergic nerves in vivo without systemic effects.", 
    "16": "A review of the available literature concerning sudden withdrawal of antihypertensive drugs shows that withdrawal syndromes after cessation of such agents have occurred with beta-blockers, methyldopa, clonidine hydrochloride, guanabenz, and bethanidine sulfate. Most commonly, these syndromes are limited to nervousness, tachycardia, headache, and nausea 36 to 72 hours after cessation of the drug. In rare cases, serious exacerbation of myocardial ischemia (beta-blockers) or hypertension (clonidine, methyldopa) may occur in the posttreatment period. The withdrawal syndromes generally respond promptly to reinstitution of antihypertensive therapy. The infrequent occurrence of withdrawal syndromes should not discourage use of these efficacious agents.", 
    "17": "Labetalol is a mixture of four isomers. Its alpha and beta adrenergic blocking properties were compared to those of the R,R-isomer, SCH 19927. In anesthetized dogs, i.v. administration of both compounds produced competitive beta and alpha blockade as judged by inhibition of the tachycardia and vasopressor responses to i.v. injections of isoproterenol and phenylpherine, respectively. SCH 19927 was 3 to 4 times as potent as beta blocker, but only one-third as potent an alpha blocker as labetalol. Therefore, the separation of beta and alpha blocking activity of SCH 19927 clearly exceeded that of labetalol. SCH 19927 also demonstrated greater beta blocking potency than labetalol after oral administration to conscious dogs or rats that were subsequently pithed. SCH 19927 did not affect, whereas labetalol slightly reduced, pressor responses to sympathetic stimulation in the pithed rat. Both drugs were relatively devoid of intrinsic beta-1 sympathomimetic activity in the ganglion-blocked dog. It is concluded that SCH 19927 is a more potent beta adrenoceptor blocker and less potent alpha blocker than labetalol. The separation of adrenergic blocker activities indicates that steric requirements for alpha and beta blockade differ in the labetalol molecule.", 
    "18": "Anaphylaxis to known allergens occurred in two patients under treatment for hypertension with propranolol. The clinical course of both cases was similar. Bradycardia associated with an undetectable blood pressure, unusual severity, and sluggish response to treatment were major common factors in which blockade of the beta-adrenergic system may have had a role. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist that acts competitively by blocking the adenylate cyclase receptor on efferent cells, is well recognized to cause increased airways resistance in some asthmatic and normal subjects. It is postulated that propranolol potentiated anaphylaxis in these patients by inhibition of adenylate cyclase, resulting in lowered intracellular cyclic AMP and a lowered threshold of mediator release. The bradycardia during profound hypotension is attributed to an unopposed cholinergic action caused by blunting of the normal endogenous beta-adrenergic response by propranolol.", 
    "19": "[3H](+/-)Carazolol, a newly available beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, can be used to characterize beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes present in membrane vesicles derived from canine ventricular myocardium and canine lung. [3H](+/-)Carazolol binding is saturable, of high affinity, and is displaceable by beta-adrenergic agents in accordance with their known pharmacological potencies. The interaction of carazolol with beta-adrenergic receptors is stereospecific; the (-) stereoisomer demonstrates greater potency than the (+) stereoisomer. Kinetic analysis of [3H](+/-)carazolol interaction with beta-adrenergic receptors suggests that presence of two phases of interaction, consistent with initial rapidly reversible \"low\" affinity association of ligand with receptor, followed by isomerization to form a high affinity, slowly reversible complex. Through use of a [3H](+/-)carazolol binding assay based on the high affinity complex, pharmacological specificities of beta-adrenergic receptor populations of canine myocardium and lung were quantified. Analysis using computer-assisted techniques suggests a beta 1/beta 2 receptor ratio of approximately 85%/15% for canine myocardium and 5%/95% for canine lung. In the absence of added guanine nucleotides, comparison of potencies of beta-adrenergic agonists in the two membrane systems suggests significant beta 2 selectivity of l-isoproterenol and l-epinephrine, and non-selectivity of norepinephrine. In the presence of saturating levels of guanine nucleotides, comparison of agonist potencies confirms the non-selectivity of l-isoproterenol and l-epinephrine, and beta 1 selectivity of norepinephrine. These results demonstrate that the state of guanine nucleotide regulation of receptors should be defined when examining agonist selectivities for beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in vitro.", 
    "20": "The effect of the new diuretic antihypertensive drug, indapamide (2.5 mg a day), was compared with the effect of thiazide diuretics in 24 patients with hypertension (seven of whom were receiving a diuretic alone, six were taking a beta-blocker plus a diuretic, and 11 received other combinations of drugs, including a diuretic in all cases). The randomized crossover study with two six-week phases indicated that indapamide is an effective hypotensive agent with potency similar to that of the thiazide diuretics in lowering the blood pressure and in increasing the excretion of potassium.", 
    "21": "The nature of the propranolol binding site of the beta-adrenergic receptor has been examined by utilizing the intrinsic fluorescence of propranolol as a probe. Additionally, the spatial relationship between the propranolol binding site and membrane tryptophan has been examined by utilizing I-quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, chemical modification of membrane tryptophan, and singlet-singlet energy transfer between membrane-bound propranolol and tryptophan. Propranolol, at concentrations consistent with specific beta-receptor binding, protected approximately 42% of the membrane tryptophan fluorescence from I-quenching. Further, in the presence of propranolol, the apparent quenching constant (kq) was altered from 3.6 to 21.8 M-1. Reaction of the membrane fragments with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide (Koshland's reagent I) in the presence and absence of propranolol indicated that low concentrations of propranolol protected approximately 45% of the membrane tryptophan from the reagent. The singlet-singlet energy transfer from tryptophan to propranolol was determined by sensitized emission. The distance between these two species was found to be less than 20 A. These results have been interpreted to indicate that propranolol, when bound to the beta-adrenergic receptor, is situated such that its naphthyl moiety is inserted into a tryptophan-rich hydrophobic pocket of the receptor.", 
    "22": "Kinetics of propranolol after oral administration were investigated in 9 children aged 5--11 years with intact liver function who had undergone porto-systemic anastomosis surgery for pylethrombosis and in a 16-year-old boy with a Warren shunt. Bioavailability of the drug had increased by twice the values measured in physiologic liver blood flow; elimination half-life had doubled. These alterations must be taken into consideration in medication, e.g. extreme care must be exercised in the oral administration of \"first pass\" drugs in porto-systemic shunt patients and it is recommended that the initial dose should be at the level of intravenous administration. The reduced rate of elimination should be taken into account in the case of drugs whose elimination depends on liver blood flow.", 
    "23": "Tissue injury (laparotomy) produces an increase in plasma fibrinogen. This increase is inhibited by the removal of the adrenal medulla, but injection of epinephrine in laparotomized-medullectomized rats returns fibrinogen levels to values similar to those observed in only laparotomized rats. Epinephrine administration to laparotomized rats increases the fibrinogen compared with the group of laparotomized rats without treatment, but epinephrine by itself does not modify plasma fibrinogen levels in uninjured rats. Epinephrine is apparently responsible for the increase of plasma fibrinogen in rats subjected to tissue injury, probably through beta adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "24": "The effect of 60 minutes' intravenous infusions, before morning feeding, of ammonium acetate (18.6 micromole/min/kg of body weight) and ammonium acetate with propranolol (11 microgram/min/kg of body weight) on the ruminal motility of sheep was examined. Ammonia has a adrenaline-like action therefore propranolol, a beta-receptor blocking agent, was administered in order to eliminate the possible effect of adrenaline on ruminal motility. The contractions of the dorsal sack of the rumen were registered by means of the balloon method, with the gauge inserted through the rumen fistula. The infusion of ammonium acetate caused an increase of the ammonia concentration in the blood to 0.6 mmol/1 at the end of 60 minutes' infusion. Already during the first 5 minutes of the intravenous infusion of ammonium acetate there was a decreased frequency of ruminal contractions, which was observed throughout the infusion. After the infusion there was a radical decrease of the concentration of ammonia in the blood, and at the same time an increase in the frequency of rumen contraction was observed. Blocking of the beta-adrenergic receptors by propranolol did not eliminate the inhibiting action of ammonium ion on rumen motility. The infusion of the ammonium acetate caused an increase of adrenaline and glucose concentration. This response was eliminated by propranolol in the case of adrenaline but not glucose. It is assumed that the action of ammonium ion on the rumen motility is derived primarily by the central nervous system.", 
    "25": "Low voltage myocardial automaticity (LVA) was investigated by pharmacological modulations of the presynaptic and postsynaptic processes. The sensitivity of LVA both to inhibitor and stimulator of neurotransmitter release suggests its involvement in LVA genesis. Moreover, LVA is blocked by the inhibition of the cyclic AMP system, supporting the participation of the c-AMP-dependent membrane phosphorylation in calcium-mediated cardiac electrogenesis.", 
    "26": "A double-blind within-patient study was carried out on Zimbabwean Blacks to investigate the effect of once-daily atenolol on hypertension in doses of 100 and 200 mg/d. Atenolol 200 mg produced significant changes in diastolic pressure readings taken in the supine and standing positions and after exercise; with atenolol 100 mg modest but non-significant changes occurred. These findings are less impressive than those previously reported in White subjects. We conclude that beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents should not be used as drugs of first choice for hypertension in our Black population.", 
    "27": "The effects of clonidine and dl-propranolol on negative pressure breathing-induced diuresis in chloralose-anaesthetized dog were studied. Clonidine (10 microgram/kg i.v.) suppressed the diuretic response, whereas dl-propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) was inactive.", 
    "28": "Epinephrine produced a dose-dependent stimulation of ureogenesis. Epinephrine action was unaffected by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol but was blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonists prazosin and yohimbine. Prazosin was approximately 3 orders of magnitude more potent than yohimbine, indicating that the adrenoceptor involved in this action is of the alpha 1-subtype.", 
    "29": "Power spectrum analysis of heart rate fluctuations provides a quantitative noninvasive means of assessing the functioning of the short-term cardiovascular control systems. We show that sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity make frequency-specific contributions to the heart rate power spectrum, and that renin-angiotensin system activity strongly modulates the amplitude of the spectral peak located at 0.04 hertz. Our data therefore provide evidence that the renin-angiotensin system plays a significant role in short-term cardiovascular control in the time scale of seconds to minutes.", 
    "30": "Thirty patients with essential hypertension (WHO Stage I or II) completed a double blind crossover trial in which they received metoprolol as monotherapy as either a slow release formulation of 200 mg once daily or a conventional formulation of 100 mg bd. Duration of treatment was six weeks on each preparation, given in randomised order. Mean values of resting blood pressure and heart rate, measured 22 to 24 hours after the daily dose of the SR formulation or 12-14 hours after the second dose of the conventional form were significantly lower than pretreatment levels. The two treatments were equally effective and equally well tolerated.", 
    "31": "The author reports on the results of an investigation of 100 randomly sampled hypertensives treated with beta blockers and presenting an unexpected incidence (32%) of increased airway resistance. Remarkable occurrences of bronchitis in infancy, recurrent bronchitis and chronic bronchitis are indicative of a substantially higher risk of bronchial side effects by high-dosed beta blocker therapy (e. g. antihypertensive treatment). Hints are given for the practical approach.", 
    "32": "A hypertensive women was treated throughout pregnancy with propranolol 40 mg daily without complication. At delivery the umbilical cord plasma concentration was similar to that in the maternal venous plasma. Milk:plasma ratios were less than 1, although a higher ratio would be predicted. Estimated daily intake of propranolol in breast milk by the infant was about 3 micrograms. There appears to be no reason to advise women receiving propranolol to avoid breast feeding.", 
    "33": "The ability of propranolol to limit myocardial infarct size (IS) following coronary artery occlusion with and without reperfusion into a critical stenosis was assessed in the dog. IS was determined by the nitrobluetetrazolium staining method and expressed as percent of the left ventricle (free wall plus septum). In Series 1 dogs the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) was ligated at its origin. IS at 6 h was similar in groups pretreated with saline (36.0 +/- 1.3%) or propranolol (0.2 mg . kg-1, 34.7 +/- 1.7%; 1.0 mg . kg-1, 36.7 +/- 1.5%; 4.4 mg . kg-1, 34.8 +/- 0.3%). In Series 2 dogs a relatively small infarction was produced by ligating the largest branch of the LCX between the left anterior descending and posterior descending arteries. IS at 6 h was not significantly different in dogs pretreated with saline (8.1 +/- 1.7%) or propranolol (0.2 mg . kg-1, 7.1 +/- 2.5%; 1.0 mg . kg-1, 4.6 +/- 1.2%). In Series 3 dogs the LCX was ligated approximately 10 mm from its origin for 60 min followed by reperfusion into a critical stenosis. IS determined at 24 h was significantly less in dogs treated with propranolol (1.0 mg . kg-1) before LCX occlusion (4.6 +/- 0.6%) or 5 min after LCX reperfusion (9.5 +/- 1.8%) than in dogs treated with saline (22.6 +/- 2.8%). In Series 4 dogs treatment was exactly as in Series 3 except that reperfusion was not instituted. IS was similar in dogs pretreated with saline (29.0 +/- 1.5%) or propranolol (31.1 +/- 3.0%). Thus, in the present study, propranolol limited IS in the presence but not in the absence of reperfusion. In the reperfusion model propranolol was effective when administered before coronary occlusion or after initiation of reperfusion.", 
    "34": "The effect of epinephrine on potassium metabolism was examined in six subjects. Each subject participated in four studies as follows: (1) potassium chloride infusion (0.75 mEq/kg, i.v.) given over 2 hours, (2) epinephrine (0.05 micrograms/kg.min) plus potassium chloride, (3) propranolol (1.43 micrograms/kg.min) plus epinephrine plus potassium chloride, and (4) propranolol plus potassium chloride. The epinephrine infusion with potassium chloride led to a marked improvement in potassium tolerance, which was due to a greater than twofold increase in the extrarenal disposal of potassium (P less than 0.001). The enhancing effect of epinephrine on extrarenal potassium uptake was completely reversed with the beta-blocking agent propranolol. When propranolol alone was infused with potassium chloride, a significant decrease in the extrarenal disposal of potassium was observed. When potassium chloride was infused alone, 47% of the administered potassium load was excreted in the urine. Epinephrine infusion with potassium chloride markedly inhibited the urinary excretion of potassium (UkV) to rates that were actually below the basal potassium excretion rate (P less than 0.001). Propranolol almost completely reversed this effect of epinephrine on UkV, and when propranolol was infused alone, an enhancement in UkV (P less than 0.005) was observed. Insulin adds only a minor contribution to the enhancing effect of epinephrine on extrarenal potassium disposal and dose not contribute at all to the inhibitory effect of epinephrine on renal potassium excretion. These results demonstrate that epinephrine ameliorates the rise in plasma potassium concentration following potassium chloride infusion. Because none of the infused potassium was excreted during the 4-hour study period, the improvement in potassium tolerance must result from an enhancement in extrarenal potassium disposal. The ability of propranolol to reverse both the extrarenal and renal effects indicates that the action of epinephrine is mediated via stimulation of the beta receptor.", 
    "35": "The hypotensive effect of nifedipine (a Ca2+-antagonist) was studied in acute tests and during the long-term administration of the drug together with propranolol. Nifedipine (10 mg, sublingually) decreased blood pressure from 174/102 to 136/82 mmHg with increase in heart rate and plasma renin activity. The combination of nifedipine (10 mg, sublingually) and propranolol (0.2 mg/Kg body weight, intravenously) decreased blood pressure from 168/104 to 131/86 mmHg with decrease in heart rate and plasma renin activity. Twenty-five hypertensive patients were treated with nifedipine and propranolol (10 mg x 3 to 4/day) together with or without diuretic for long-term. With the combination therapy, blood pressure of Group I (11 hypertensive patients with coronary heart disease) fell from 211/129 to 140/85 mmHg, blood pressure of Group II (9 severe hypertensive patients without coronary heart disease) from 230/137 to 139/84 mmHg, and blood pressure of Group III (5 established hypertension) from 182/107 to 134/83 mmHg. With this treatment regimen, heart rate and plasma renin activity decreased, and abnormal electrocardiographic findings, hypertensive retinopathy, and renal dysfunction were improved. Nifedipine, in combination with propranolol and a diuretic, is considered an effective treatment of hypertension either with or without coronary heart disease.", 
    "36": "The hemodynamic effects of intravenous administration of acetaldehyde were determined in anesthetized control (group I), propranolol pretreated (group II) and phentolamine pretreated (group III) guinea pigs. Acetaldehyde produced an immediate and significant increase in mean arterial pressure followed by its progressive decrease resulting in hypotension. Heart rate increased significantly. In propranolol treated animals, acetaldehyde-induced tachycardia was not produced whereas in phentolamine treated animals, the initial pressor response was converted into a depressor one. Hence the increase in mean arterial pressure and heart rate produced by acetaldehyde are likely to be due to catecholamine release from adrenergic nerve endings.", 
    "37": "One drop of 0.5% timolol maleate instilled into the normal eyes of four subjects produced a marked reduction of intraocular pressure that was maximal at 3 hours but not significant after 12 hours. Instillation of one drop a day for 30 days produced a reliable, maintained reduction of intraocular pressure in the treated eye. The pupil cycle time in both eyes was measured at least twice daily for 1 week before timolol treatment to assess the reproducibility of the test and then twice daily for the 30 days of treatment with timolol. The drug had no significant effect on the pupil cycle time. Measuring the pupil cycle time should afford the ophthalmologist a useful method of assessing the progress of glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve while the patient is undergoing treatment with timolol, an assessment that was not possible when patients were treated with pilocarpine.", 
    "38": "Previous work has shown that after a single oral dose, plasma propranolol concentrations in patients with active inflammatory disease are significantly higher than those in healthy subjects. After oral administration of propranolol (2 mg) to arthritic rats, the area under the mean drug concentration-time curve in plasma was approximately 10 times greater than that in control animals. After intravenous administration (0.25 mg) the area in arthritic rats was approximately doubled compared with that in controls. The mechanisms causing these changes are not known, but it is probable that increased drug binding to an acute phase reactant in plasma, together with decreased first-pass hepatic clearance in arthritic rats after oral dosing, are involved.", 
    "39": "The plasma concentrations and bioavailability of sustained-release isosorbide dinitrate and standard-release pindolol have been compared after administration of these drugs in combination and alone. Bioavailability parameters of isosorbide dinitrate and pindolol obtained after administration of the drugs in combination were not significantly different (P greater than 0.05) to those obtained after administration of either drug alone. Two peaks of mean concentrations of isosorbide dinitrate occurred in plasma after administration of 30 mg of this drug in combination with 7.5 mg pindolol (4.4 ng ml-1 at 1 h and 4.5 ng ml-1 at 5 h), or alone (5.9 ng ml-1 at 2 h and 5.7 ng ml-1 at 5 h). In each case, plasma concentrations of isosorbide dinitrate were maintained during at least 8 h, whereas the drug was not detected in plasma at 2.5 h after administration of a standard-release formulation. The peaks of mean concentrations of pindolol were 39.7 ng ml-1 at 1.5 h after administration of 7.5 mg drug in combination with isosorbide dinitrate and 38.0 ng ml-1 at 1 h administration of the drug alone. Concentrations of pindolol in plasma declined with a half-life of 3 h.", 
    "40": "1. The effect of chronic hyperthermia (35 degree C for 1 month) on the kinetics of propranolol, theophylline, diphenylhydantoin and digoxin was studied in groups of male Wistar rats. 2. Each compound was administered by intravenous injection, dosage being 2 mg/kg for propranolol, 3 mg/kg for theophylline, 10 mg/kg for phenytoin, and 0.01 mg/Kg for digoxin. 3. Total body clearance was diminished, mainly by an increase in the elimination half-life, for propranolol, theophylline, and digoxin. That of phenytoin remained unchanged. 4. Distribution volume increased slightly with propranolol, theophylline, digoxin.", 
    "41": "Ligation of the left coronary artery of the rabbit for 2 hours induced an increase in free activity of lysosomal acid phosphatase and a decrease in its bound activity, thus indicating an elevation of the permeability of lysosomal membranes and egress of lysosomes into cell cytoplasm. Intravenous injection of isadrin (2 mg/kg) and anaprilin (25 mg/kg) favoured a significant lowering of free activity of acid phosphatase in ischemic cardiac tissue. Bound activity of acid phosphatase in the area of the ischemized myocardium was potentiated by isadrin and anaprilin. The diminished permeability of lysosomal membranes induced by isadrin and anaprilin is regarded as a nonspecific effect of the drugs.", 
    "42": "A highly sensitive and specific quantitative assay for metoprolol and two of its metabolites, containing an unchanged 2-hydroxy-4-isopropylaminopropoxy sidechain, has been developed. The compounds are isolated from the alkalized sample (plasma or urine) by extraction with dichloromethane, and converted to trifluoroacetyl derivatives by reaction with methyl-bis-(trifluoroacetamide). The reaction mixture is gas chromatographed on an OV-17 column and each substance is assayed by electron impact mass spectrometry using selected ion monitoring, and quantified by comparing the intensity of fragment ion m/z 266 with the intensities of corresponding fragment ions from the deuterated internal standards (m/z 270 and 271). It is possible to determine concentrations as low as 1 nmol l-1 (0.3 ng ml-1) in 1 ml of sample with relative standard deviation of less than 10%.", 
    "43": "The effects of histamine and its analogs 2-(2-pyridyl) ethylamine (PEA) and 4-methylhistamine (4 MH) have been studied on uterine preparations obtained from estrogen-primed guinea pigs and rats. (1) Histamine and 4 MH, a specific H2-receptor agonist produced relaxation in estrogen-primed rat uterus, whereas these agonists produced contraction in the estrogen-primed guinea pig uterus. (2) PEA, a specific H1-receptor agonist produced contraction in the guinea pig uterus but had no effect on the rat uterus. (3) Metiamide blocked responses to histamine and 4 MH in the rat uterus, whereas mepyramine blocked responses to histamine and PEA in the guinea pig uterus. (4) Propranolol produced competitive antagonism with histamine in the rat uterus, whereas it had no significant effect on the histamine or PEA responses in the guinea pig uterus. (5) Reserpine pretreatment completely abolished the responses to histamine and 4 MH in the rat uterus but did not alter the response in the guinea pig uterus. (6) Our data suggest that in rat uterus only H2-receptors are present and they are indirectly through the release of noradrenaline. In the guinea pig uterus both H1- and H2-receptors are present and are excitatory and directly acting.", 
    "44": "A gradual circulation transition from the hyperkinetic type at the early stage of the disease to the eukinetic and hypokinetic types at the steady stage was observed in rats with progressing renal hypertension. The elevation of arterial pressure on the 3-7th day of renal hypertension in the majority of cases was caused by the increased cardiac output, and at the steady hypertension stage by the increase of specific peripheral resistance. The hypotensive effect of inderal was demonstrated only in the hyperkinetic type of circulation, that gives evidence of the activation of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "45": "Significant and persistent arterial-venous (A-V) plasma concentration differences of propranolol in unanesthetized rabbits and dogs following intravenous bolus injection or intravenous infusion were found. Both arterial and venous data were then subjected to extensive pharmacokinetic analyses utilizing standard procedures. Marked differences in calculated noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters such as the steady-state volume of distribution, absolute amount present in the body, and relative contribution of the terminal phase were obtained. The appropriateness of using venous propranolol plasma data for multicompartmental mammillary pharmacokinetic modeling analysis was discussed. The significance of the present study in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic investigations of propranolol in humans remains to be explored.", 
    "46": "Nifedipine, the Ca++ antagonistic coronary vasodilator, was administered by oral, sublingual and enema routes. 1) In 6 severe hypertensive patients (systolic pressure greater than or equal to 200 mmHg, diastolic greater than or equal to 120 mmHg), nifedipine, administered orally, induced prompt and reliable fall of arterial pressure (systolic pressure: -28% of control level, diastolic: -27%). 2) In 10 patients with hypertensive emergencies, including malignant hypertension, intracranial bleeding, hypertensive encephalopathy and acute hypertensive heart failure, sublingual and enema administration of nifedipine were performed with excellent hypotensive efficacy. 3) Pressure began to fall within 5--15 min, 30 min and 30--60 min after sublingual (or dissolved), enema and oral (capsule), respectively, and reached its lowest levels in the next 10--20 min. The fall of pressure lasts for 2--4 hours. 4) In the combination of nifedipine with alpha-methyldopa, antihypertensive response in short-term was increased about +11% over nifedipine alone and lasted for 8 hours. In combination with beta-blocker (propranolol), hypotensive efficacy increased +39% over nifedipine alone, but the effective duration of this combination was the same as nifedipine alone. 5) Side effects, including dryness of the mouth and burning sensation in face and legs, were observed in few patients.", 
    "47": "The aim of this paper is to report the effect of variations in stimulus frequency (SF) and intensity (SI) of right ventricular pacing on the left ventricular mechanical alternans (MA) amplitude, (MAA) which is defined as 100 (S-W)/S, where S is the ventricular pressure of the strong beat and W that of the weak beat. In 30 dogs the right ventricle was paced at SF ranging from the sinus frequency up to 400/min and at SI ranging from threshold up to 270 mA, while the left ventricular pressure was recorded. Increasing SF at near threshold values of SI resulted in an increase of MAA up to a maximal value. Further increase in SF might cause a diminution of MAA. A slight raise in SI than could increase abruptly MAA. Further increase in SI while keeping a constant SF caused a reduction in MAA which was an approximate logarithmic function of SI. Digoxin, adrenaline or calcium reduced or abolished MA, even in experiments which left atrial and mean aortic pressure were kept constant by suitably placed open-air reservoirs. Pindolol increased MAA. Raising the height of the atrial constant pressure reservoir induced the MAA, while lowering its height increased the MAA. Changing the height of the aortic constant pressure reservoir did not produce consistent changes in MAA. The effects of SF and SI on the MAA could possibly be explained on the basis of the hypothesis that the MA is a complex oscillatory phenomenon. A different number of myocardial fibers contracting at each systole depending on SF and SI may play a role in the genesis of MA and may explain the present findings. It is concluded that, in addition to hemodynamic and inotropic factors, stimulating the ventricles at a high SI may ameliorate the MA at a given heart rate."
