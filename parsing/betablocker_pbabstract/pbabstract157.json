For functional analysis, the disposition of intravenously (30 mg) and orally administered talinolol (100 mg) was measured among 31 individuals. Moreover, the effects of rifampicin-type induction (600 mg, 8 days) of duodenal ABCC2 were quantified in 22 participants with regard to genetic polymorphisms.",

    "12": "Benidipine, a long-lasting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, is used for treatment of hypertension and angina. Benidipine exerts pleiotropic pharmacological features, such as renoprotective and cardioprotective effects. In pathophysiological conditions, the antidiuretic hormone aldosterone causes development of renal and cardiovascular diseases. In adrenal glomerulosa cells, aldosterone is produced in response to extracellular potassium, which is mainly mediated by T-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. More recently, it has been demonstrated that benidipine inhibits T-type Ca2+ channels in addition to L-type Ca2+ channels. Therefore, effect of calcium channel blockers, including benidipine, on aldosterone production and T-type Ca2+ channels using human adrenocortical cell line NCI-H295R was investigated. Benidipine efficiently inhibited KCl-induced aldosterone production at low concentration (3 and 10 nM), with inhibitory activity more potent than other calcium channel blockers. Patch clamp analysis indicated that benidipine concentration-dependently inhibited T-type Ca2+ currents at 10, 100 and 1000 nM. As for examined calcium channel blockers, inhibitory activity for T-type Ca2+ currents was well correlated with aldosterone production. L-type specific calcium channel blockers calciseptine and nifedipine showed no effect in both assays. These results indicate that inhibition of T-type Ca2+ channels is responsible for inhibition of aldosterone production in NCI-H295R cells. Benidipine efficiently inhibited KCl-induced upregulation of 11-beta-hydroxylase mRNA and aldosterone synthase mRNA as well as KCl-induced Ca2+ influx, indicating it as the most likely inhibition mechanism. Benidipine partially inhibited angiotensin II-induced aldosterone production, plus showed additive effects when used in combination with the angiotensin II type I receptor blocker valsartan. Benidipine also partially inhibited angiotensin II-induced upregulation of the above mRNAs and Ca2+ influx inhibitory activities of benidipine for aldosterone production. T-type Ca2+ channels may contribute to additional benefits of this drug for treating renal and cardiovascular diseases, beyond its primary anti-hypertensive effects from blocking L-type Ca2+ channels.",

    "21": "Beta-adrenoceptor is over-stimulated during myocardial ischemia, in which hydrogen sulphide (H2S) concentration was found to be lowered. The present study attempted to investigate if H2S modulates beta-adrenoceptor function and the underlying mechanism. We examined the effect of NaHS (a H2S donor) on myocyte contraction and electrically-induced (EI) intracellular calcium ([Ca2+](i)) transients upon beta-adrenergic stimulation in rat ventricular myocytes with a video edge tracker method and a spectrofluorometric method using fura-2/AM as a calcium indicator, respectively. We found that isoproterenol (ISO, 10(-9)-10(-6) M), a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, concentration-dependently increased the twitch amplitude of ventricular myocytes, which was attenuated by NaHS (10(-5)-10(-3) M) in a dose-dependent manner. The amplitudes and maximal velocities (+/-dl/dt) of myocyte twitch and EI-[Ca2+](i) transient amplitudes were enhanced by ISO, forskolin (an adenylyl cyclase activator), 8-bromoadenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (an activator of protein kinase A) and Bay K-8644 (a selective L-type Ca2+ channel agonist). Administration of NaHS (100 microM) only significantly attenuated the effects of ISO and forskolin. Moreover, NaHS reversed ISO-induced cAMP elevation and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. In addition, stimulation of beta-adrenoceptor by ISO significantly decreased endogenous H2S production in rat ventricular myocytes. In conclusion, H2S may negatively modulate beta-adrenoceptor function via inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity. Impairment of this negative modulation during ischemia may induce cardiac arrhythmias. Our study may provide a novel mechanism for ischemia-induced cardiac injury.", 
    "22": "Beta blockers improve cardiac function and prolong survival in patients with systolic chronic heart failure (CHF). However, the exact mechanisms underlying these benefits are uncertain. Specifically, it is unclear whether a close relation exists between heart rate (HR) reduction and clinical outcomes with these agents. This hypothesis was therefore tested within randomized controlled trials of beta blockers in systolic CHF. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and HR values at baseline and study end were obtained from available beta-blocker randomized clinical trials. The relation between change in HR and all-cause mortality as well as the LVEF was determined using regression analysis. Thirty-five trials, which included 22,926 patients with a mean follow-up duration of 9.6 months, were analyzed for all-cause mortality, the LVEF, and HR. There was a close relation between all-cause annualized mortality rate and HR (adjusted R2 = 0.51, p = 0.004). A strong correlation between change in HR and change in LVEF (adjusted R2 = 0.48, p = 0.000) was also observed. When only trials with >100 patients were included, an even tighter correlation was seen (adjusted R2 = 0.60, p = 0.0004). In conclusion, these analyses indicate that a major contributor to the clinical benefits of beta-blocker therapy in systolic CHF may be the HR-lowering effect of these agents. Therefore, the magnitude of HR reduction may be more important than the achievement of target dose in beta-blocker treatment of systolic CHF.",

Blood contact with the artificial surface and shear stress of ECC activates platelets and leukocytes resulting in a coagulopathy and proinflammatory events. Blockers of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa (CD41/CD61) can protect platelet function during ECC, a phenomenon called \"platelet anaesthesia\", but may be involved in post-ECC bleeding. We hypothesized that the new selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110beta inhibitor TGX-221 that inhibits shear-induced platelet activation without prolonging the bleeding time in vivo may also protect platelet function during ECC. Heparinized blood of healthy volunteers (n = 6) was treated in vitro with either the GP IIb/IIIa blocker tirofiban, TGX-221 or as control and circulated in an ECC model. Before and after 30 minutes circulation CD41 expression on the ECC-tubing as measure for platelet-ECC binding and generation of the platelet activation marker beta-thromboglobulin were determined using ELISA. Platelet aggregation and platelet-granulocyte binding were analysed in flow cytometry. After log-transforming the data statistical evaluation was performed using multifactor ANOVA in combination with Tukey's HSD test (global alpha = 5%). Tirofiban and TGX-221 inhibited platelet-ECC interaction, platelet aggregation and platelet-granulocyte binding. Tirofiban also inhibited ECC-induced beta-thromboglobulin release. The observed inhibition of platelet-ECC interaction and platelet activation by tirofiban contributes to explain the mechanism of \"platelet anaesthesia\". TGX-221 represents a promising alternative to GP IIb/IIIa blockade and should be further investigated for use during ECC in vivo.",

    "37": "It is well known that ethanol preexposure sensitizes the liver to LPS hepatotoxicity. The mechanisms by which ethanol enhances LPS-induced liver injury are not completely elucidated but are known to involve an enhanced inflammatory response. Ethanol exposure also increases the metabolic rate of the liver, and this effect of ethanol on liver is mediated, at least in part, by the sympathetic hormone, epinephrine. However, whether or not the sympathetic nervous system also contributes to the sensitizing effect of ethanol preexposure on LPS-induced liver damage has not been determined. The purpose of this study was therefore to test the hypotheses that 1) epinephrine preexposure enhances LPS-induced liver damage (comparable to that of ethanol preexposure) and that 2) the sympathetic nervous system contributes to the sensitizing effect of ethanol. Accordingly, male C57BL/6J mice were administered epinephrine for 5 days (2 mg/kg per day) via osmotic pumps or bolus ethanol for 3 days (6 g/kg per day) by gavage. Twenty-four hours later, mice were injected with LPS (10 mg/kg ip). Both epinephrine and ethanol preexposure exacerbated LPS-induced liver damage and inflammation. Concomitant administration of propranolol with ethanol significantly attenuated the sensitizing effect of ethanol on LPS-induced liver damage. These data support the hypothesis that the sympathetic nervous system contributes, at least in part, to the mechanism of the sensitizing effect of ethanol. These results also suggest that sympathetic tone may contribute to the initiation and progression of alcoholic liver disease.",

For series 1, continuous infusion of 50 to 100 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) esmolol (n = 6) or control (no drug; n = 6) was begun 30 min before administration of a 24-mL kg(-1) 20-min bolus of 0.9% NaCl.

Fluid resuscitation (0.9% NaCl) was begun 30 min after hemorrhage. The 24-mL kg(-1) 20-min bolus was followed by titrated fluid therapy. Hemoglobin, fluid in, and urinary output were used to calculate changes in plasma volume (DeltaPV), extravascular volume (DeltaEVV = fluid in - urinary output - DeltaPV), volume expansion efficiency (VEE = fluid in / DeltaPV), and fluid distribution ratio (DeltaPV/DeltaEVV). Hemodynamics for both series were similar with the exception of heart rate. In series 1, peak DeltaPV was 9.1 +/- 1.0 mL kg(-1) in control and 3.7 +/- 1.0 mL kg(-1) at study end. Esmolol resulted in a lower peak DeltaPV (6.4 +/- 2.0 mL kg(-1)) and a negative DeltaPV (-0.4 +/- 0.6 mL kg(-1)) at study's end. Urinary output was lower, and EVV was greater with esmolol. In series 2, esmolol increased fluid requirements (67 +/- 7 mL kg(-1)) compared with control (54 +/- 5 mL kg(-1)). Esmolol reduced DeltaPV/DeltaEVV. These data suggest that esmolol impairs the vascular retention of fluid and may increase the amount of volume support during fluid resuscitation.",

It is not entirely clear how long-term application of negative inotropic compounds improves cardiac performance, slows remodeling processes, and decreases mortality. All beta-blockers, which produce a beneficial effect in heart failure, have in common a high degree of lipophilicity and, therefore, have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Here, we show that blockade of beta-adrenoceptors directly in the brain (chronic intracerebroventricular administration of metoprolol) attenuates the progression of left ventricular remodeling in a rat model of myocardial infarction-induced heart failure.

Standard curves for S- and R-metoprolol fitted quadratic functions (r(2)>or=0.9995) over the range 0.5-50 microg/L in plasma, with 0.5 microg/L representing the limit of quantification. In this range, relative standard deviations were <6% for intra-day precision and <10% for inter-day precision. The accuracy was within the range of 92-105%.",

In oocytes expressing wild-type NMDA (NR1a/NR2A) receptors, timolol and betaxolol significantly inhibited glutamate-evoked currents, whereas less inhibition was obtained with pilocarpine, and latanoprost had few effects. Moreover, the effect of timolol and betaxolol was noncompetitive with respect to glutamate. Mutations that changed Asn616 of the NR1a subunit, a critical residue for Mg(2+) blocking of NMDA receptors, to Arg (N616R) or Gln (N616Q) almost eliminated the inhibitory effects of timolol and betaxolol, as well as the blocking effect of Mg(2+). Experiments were also carried out to examine the protective effects of timolol and betaxolol against death of oocytes expressing NMDA receptors. During incubation of oocytes, especially in Mg(2+)-free medium, cell death was induced by addition of glutamate because of the continuous activation of the NMDA receptors expressed. Timolol and betaxolol significantly improved oocyte viability when they were added during the incubation period. These results suggest that timolol and betaxolol may have an additional role that they directly inhibit NMDA-receptor function, possibly via N616 of the NR1a subunit.",

We found that unlike the beta2-AR expressed on antigen loaded DCs, beta2-ARs expressed in the site of DCs inoculation may influence the efficacy of the antitumor response. Intradermal injection of Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan along with the beta2-AR-specific antagonist ICI 118,551 increased the local innate cytokine response in tumor-bearing mice. When the adoptive transfer of immature DCs loaded with OVA followed this skin preconditioning, the antitumor response was increased and tumor growth was significantly reduced. Surprisingly, when OVA-loaded mature DCs were used, the effect of the skin preconditioning was the opposite and tumor growth was similar to that observed in control, nonimmunized mice. The extent of the antitumor response on transfer of immature or mature DCs was mediated by a different migration in the draining lymph nodes and by a distinct recruitment of endogenous DCs that resulted in a modulation of the OVA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response. The unexpected tolerogenic effect exerted by mature DCs on skin preconditioning was apparently mediated by the expression of a distinctive pattern of cytokines and of the suppressive enzyme indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase in draining lymph nodes. In conclusion, we found that beta2-ARs inhibition along with toll-like receptor2 activation at the site of cancer vaccination may either enhance the resulting antitumor response or be tolerogenic in dependence of the maturation state of the transferred DCs.",

    "83": "Although A-type potassium currents are found in type II hair cells in the inner ear of most species, the molecular mechanisms for activation and inactivation of the A-type potassium current (I(A)) remain unknown. In frog semicircular canal hair cells, for example, there appear to be two classes of currents having either fast or slow inactivation [Norris CH, Ricci AJ, Housley GD, Guth PS (1992) The inactivating potassium currents of hair cells isolated from the crista ampullaris of the frog. J Neurophysiol 68:1642-1653; Russo G, Calzi D, Martini M, Rossi ML, Fesce R, Prigioni I (2007) Potassium currents in the hair cells of vestibular epithelium: position-dependent expression of two types of A channels. Eur J Neurosci 25:695-704]. It has been suggested that somehow the \"ball and chain\" mechanism (NH(3) (N) terminus motif) is modified by alternative splicing to account for the two classes of inactivation. To examine other possibilities, we cloned alpha and beta subunits that comprise the A-type potassium channel complex in adult and embryonic pigeon brain, cochlea and labyrinth. By sequence homology, we concluded that the subunits present were Kvalpha1.4 and Kvbeta1.1. The sequence of the open reading frame for Kvalpha1.4 contained the N-terminus, pore and COOH (C) terminus motifs for N-and C-type inactivation. The sequence for Kvbeta1.1 displayed amino acids consistent with assembly and association with Kvalpha1.4 alpha subunits. Kvalpha1.4 and Kvbeta1.1 were transfected either singly or in combination into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. These cells and native hair cells from the pigeon utricle were patch clamped and the inactivation properties of the A-type current were studied. In the native hair cells, the A-type current was identified by its pharmacological (4-aminopyridine (4-AP); IC(50)=11 microM) and voltage dependent inactivation properties. A comparison of the mean time constants from best-fitted single exponential and sum of two exponential equations to the ionic current inactivation revealed the following. In CHO cells when Kvalpha1.4 was expressed alone, the mean time constant (tau(1)=107 ms+/-19, N=32) was significantly (P<0.001) longer and the mean peak amplitude (2.28 nA+/-0.39, N=32) was smaller than when Kvalpha1.4 and Kvbeta1.1 were expressed in CHO cells. Moreover, the co-transfection of Kvalpha1.4 and Kvbeta1.1 into CHO cells caused a shift in the steady state inactivation curve parameter Vo 30 mV in the hyperpolarized direction relative to CHO cells expressing only Kvalpha1.4. Similarly, Kvalpha1.4-transfected CHO cells produced longer time constants and smaller amplitudes than those found for native utricular hair cells. These data lead us to conclude that while the amino acid motifs are present in Kvalpha1.4 and Kvbeta1.1 to suggest N-and C-type inactivation, co-assembly and association of Kvalpha1.4 and Kvbeta1.1 may also produce changes in the time dependent inactivation properties of vestibular hair cells.",

One patient, an asymptomatic 21-year-old male college student, was prophylactically implanted with a cardioverter-defibrillator. This decision was based largely on the presence of apparent extensive myocardial fibrosis identified by contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, currently not considered a risk factor in this disease. Fifteen months later, ventricular fibrillation was interrupted by an appropriate defibrillator shock. The other patient, an asymptomatic 15-year-old male subject without any apparent high-risk markers, died suddenly at home. Necropsy examination of the heart identified scarring confined to portions of both left ventricular papillary muscles, possibly representing a substrate for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In conclusion, these 2 cases demonstrate that present strategies for assessing high-risk status in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are inadequate to identify all such patients. However, while the anecdotal nature of these observations cannot yet justify altering the general guidelines for implantation of defibrillators for the primary prevention of sudden death related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 1 of our 2 cases suggests a future role for contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance in the risk stratification of this complex disease.",

Although Doppler echocardiography has become the diagnostic modality to assess LVOT obstruction, it may not identify all patients with labile obstruction. This study assessed the diagnostic value of cardiac catheterization using isoproterenol challenge in 25 patients with HC in whom an LVOT obstruction (gradient >or=50 mm Hg) was clinically suspected, but not diagnosed using Doppler echocardiography. These patients underwent cardiac catheterization using a transseptal approach with isoproterenol challenge. During isoproterenol infusion, the gradient increased to >or=50 mm Hg in 14 patients and remained <50 mm Hg in 11 patients. Ten patients subsequently underwent surgical myectomy, 6 patients underwent alcohol septal ablation, and 9 patients were managed medically. Median follow-up was 26 months. Of patients who had a provoked gradient >50 mm Hg during isoproterenol infusion, 8 patients who underwent septal myectomy and 5 of 6 patients who underwent alcohol septal ablation had sustained alleviation of symptoms at follow-up. In conclusion, cardiac catheterization with isoproterenol challenge may identify patients with HC who may benefit from septal reduction therapy for whom the initial noninvasive evaluation does not show severe obstruction.",

Our goal was to determine the association between ED and findings at stress MPI testing in men without previous coronary artery disease. Five hundred seventy-five men without previous coronary artery disease referred for stress MPI were prospectively screened for ED with the validated International Index of Erectile Function. ED was present in 46% of subjects, and ED was associated with more mild (summed stress score >or=4) and severe (summed stress score >8) coronary artery disease and with more composite high-risk stress MPI findings (summed stress score >8, left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, transient ischemic dilation). In patients referred for exercise, ED was associated with a lower Duke treadmill score. On multivariate analysis, ED was found to be an independent predictor of a summed stress score >or=4, a summed stress score >8, and composite high-risk MPI findings. In conclusion, in men without known coronary artery disease referred for stress MPI testing, ED is associated with adverse prognostic indicators at MPI testing including coronary artery disease and high-risk MPI findings.",

However, metoprolol partially prevented LV dilation, whereas ivabradine potentiated LV hypertrophy. Metoprolol, but not ivabradine, partially prevented post-MI chronotropic incompetence. Metoprolol markedly, whereas ivabradine mildly, increased the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient in post-MI cardiomyocytes. Ivabradine, but not metoprolol, partially prevented the MI-induced depression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) activity, while metoprolol, but not ivabradine, suppressed Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) overactivity and normalized Ca2+ sensitivity of ryanodine receptors.",

    "109": "The neurotransmitter(s) underlying nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-independent neural inhibition in the internal anal sphincter (IAS) is still uncertain. The present study investigated the role of purinergic transmission. Contractile and electrical responses to electrical field stimulation of nerves (0.1-5 Hz for 10-60 s) were recorded in strips of mouse IAS. A single stimulus generated a 28-mV fast inhibitory junction potential (IJP) and relaxation. The NOS inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA) reduced the fast IJP duration by 20%. Repetitive stimulation at 2.5-5 Hz caused a more sustained IJP and sustained relaxation. l-NNA reduced relaxation at 1 Hz and the sustained IJP at 2.5-5 Hz. All other experiments were carried out in the presence of NOS blockade. IJPs and relaxation were significantly reduced by the P2 receptor antagonists 4-[[4-formyl-5-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-[(phosphonooxy)methyl]-2-pyridinyl]azo]-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid (PPADS) (100 microM), by desensitization of P2Y receptors with adenosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate (ADP-betaS) (10 microM), and by the selective P2Y1 receptor blocker 2'-deoxy-N(6)-methyl adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate (MRS2179) (10 microM). Relaxation and IJPs were also significantly reduced by the K(+) channel blocker apamin (1 microM). Removal of extracellular potassium (K(o)) increased IJP amplitude to 205% of control, whereas return of K(o) 30 min later hyperpolarized cells by 19 mV and reduced IJP amplitude to 50% of control. Exogenous ATP (3 mM) relaxed muscles in the presence of TTX (1 microM) and hyperpolarized cells by 15 mV. In conclusion, these data suggest that purinergic transmission significantly contributes to NOS-independent neural inhibition in the mouse IAS. P2Y1 receptors, as well as at least one other P2 receptor subtype, contribute to this pathway. Purinergic receptors activate apamin-sensitive K(+) channels as well as other apamin-insensitive conductances leading to hyperpolarization and relaxation.",

Data from 97 patients who underwent complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot were reviewed. The patients were divided into 2 groups: those receiving preoperative propranolol therapy (n = 32) and those not receiving therapy (n = 65). Preoperative and intraoperative variables did not differ between groups. There were no differences in postoperative inotrope scores on arrival to the intensive care unit and through the first 12 hours postoperatively. There was a trend toward increased inotrope scores at 24 hours (median 8 vs 5, p = 0.05) and 48 hours (median 8 vs 3, p = 0.05) postoperatively in the patients treated with propranolol. Temporary pacing in the early postoperative period occurred more often in the propranolol group (16% vs 3%, p = 0.04). There was no difference between groups in length of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, or total hospital postoperative stay. In conclusion, propranolol therapy can be used in patients with tetralogy of Fallot until the time of surgery, without important effects on their postoperative courses. Any blunting of inotropic or chronotropic activity in propranolol-treated patients appears to be easily overcome with increased inotropic medications or temporary pacing, without increased morbidity or mortality.",

Loading and release of model drugs into/from the hydrogel particles were evaluated. Thermosensitive particles were stabilized by cross-linkers, the most feasible of which was salicylic acid (SA). At 23 degrees C, below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the thermosensitive polymers, stability of the hydrogels was poor, whereas at 37 degrees C stable hydrogel particles were formed. All the drugs and also the cross-linker (SA) were released more efficiently from the PVCL particles compared to the PVCL-graft-C(11)EO(42) particles. Drug concentration and pH affected clearly the rate and extent of drug release in physiological buffer. The higher drug release from the PVCL was based on the more open gel-like structure as opposed to PVCL-graft-C(11)EO(42) particles. Complex formation between the cross-linker and the polymers was due to the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of SA and H-bond acceptors of the PVCL. In the case of PVCL-graft-C(11)EO(42), the ethylene oxide chain provided more opportunities for H-bonding in comparison to the pure PVCL, creating more stable complexes (more tightly packed particles) leading to sustained drug release.",

The records of 80 patients (58 post-surgical patients; group S and 22 internal medicine patients; group IM) were reviewed. Thirty-seven (64%) of the group S patients were post-coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and the IM group consisted mostly of patients with acute myocardial infarction. The most common indication for landiolol in group S was the prevention of myocardial ischemia (50%), and in group IM, it was atrial fibrillation (45%). The median infusion rate of landiolol was 5 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) and the median infusion time was 2 days. Twenty-six patients were continued on oral beta-adrenergic receptor blockers. Landiolol reduced heart rate significantly without reducing blood pressure, and stabilized hemodynamics.

    "158": "Recent work has shown that adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) plays an important role in modulating the activity of parasympathetic cardiac vagal neurons that dominate the neural control of heart rate. This study examined the mechanisms by which activation of ATP receptors modulates excitatory neurotransmission to cardiac vagal neurons. Glutamatergic activity to cardiac vagal neurons was isolated and examined using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in an in vitro brain slice preparation in rats. ATP (100 microM) evoked increases in the frequency of glutamatergic miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in cardiac vagal neurons which were blocked by the broad P2 receptor antagonist pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS, 100 microM). Application of the selective P2X receptor agonist, alpha, beta-methylene ATP (100 microM), also increased glutamatergic mEPSCs neurotransmission to cardiac vagal neurons indicating P2X receptors enhance glutamatergic release to cardiac vagal neurons. The evoked increase in glutamatergic mEPSC was unaltered by the voltage-gated calcium channel blocker cadmium, and was abolished by the selective P2X receptor antagonist 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-Trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate, TNP-ATP (100 microM). This work demonstrates that the ATP evoked facilitation of excitatory neurotransmission to cardiac vagal neurons is dependent upon activation of P2X receptors on glutamatergic presynaptic terminals.", 
    "159": "We describe an interesting case of a woman with decompensated cirrhosis, ischaemic heart disease and prolonged QT interval, who developed a new-onset atrial fibrillation. During amiodarone infusion a torsade de pointes occurred, which was immediately converted to sinus rhythm by synchronized cardioversion. A new episode of atrial fibrillation was treated with infusion of a beta-blocker (metoprolol) that restored sinus rhythm and normalized the QT interval. Delayed repolarization, frequently observed in ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis and pro-arrhythmic drugs administration, represents the background for the development of torsade de pointes. Our report underlines that the potential harmfulness of a prolonged QT interval in cirrhotic patients is currently not perceived in its entirety, so that various categories of drugs affecting ventricular repolarization are rather thoughtlessly used in clinical practice without monitoring the QT interval. Thus, amiodarone should be avoided, if possible, or used with extreme care in arrhythmic patients with advanced liver disease. Moreover, beta-blockers may be considered the first-line treatment for rate-control during supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in cirrhotic patients with delayed repolarization.", 
    "160": "Post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a frequent complication occurring in 30% to 50% of patients after cardiac surgery. It is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity, predisposes patients to a higher risk of stroke, requires additional treatment, and increases the costs of the post-operative care. The aim of this review is to present the current state of knowledge about the risk factors, mechanisms, prevention, and treatment of this complication. In addition to the well known risk factors for the development of POAF such as age, left atrial enlargement, and valvular surgery, new metabolic risk factors related to visceral obesity have been identified. With regard to the prevention of POAF, beta-blocker drugs are effective and safe and can be used in most patients, whereas amiodarone can be added in high-risk patients. Biatrial pacing was shown to be effective; however, its complexity might limit its application. Although there are only few data regarding the usefulness of magnesium, statins, N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and corticosteroids, their addition to beta-blocker drugs might be of benefit for further reducing POAF. Treatment includes the use of an AV nodal blocking agent to achieve the rate control. If AF does not spontaneously convert to sinus rhythm within 24 h, anticoagulation should be initiated and a rhythm control strategy should be attempted. More investigations are warranted to explore mechanisms by which POAF occurs. This new knowledge would undoubtedly translate into a more efficient prevention and treatment of this common post-operative complication that is associated with a major health and economic burden.",

    "174": "Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated beta-blockers improving survival after myocardial infarction (MI). Patients with \"bradycardia-related\" contraindications to beta-blockers, such as those with asymptomatic bradycardia or AV conduction abnormalities, have been excluded from clinical trials of beta-blockers and continue to be excluded from post-MI beta-blocker therapy in routine clinical practice. These patients tend to be elderly and have a high 1-year mortality. If beta-blockers provide benefit to the post-MI patient independent of their heart rate-lowering effect, then these patients could benefit substantially from initiation of beta-blocker therapy. However, in this particular group of patients, beta-blockers can be safely initiated only if more severe or significant bradycardia can be prevented by pacemaker implantation. It is unclear whether adverse effects related to pacemaker implantation could also negate some or all of the hypothesized benefit of beta-blocker therapy. Although beta-blockers are particularly effective in the elderly, the benefit of beta-blocker therapy in patients with bradycardia-related contraindications to beta-blockers has not been established. The PACE-MI trial is a randomized controlled trial that will address whether beta-blocker therapy enabled by pacemaker implantation is superior to no beta-blocker and no pacemaker therapy after MI in patients with rhythm contraindications to beta-blockers or in those who have developed symptomatic bradycardia due to beta-blockers. The trial will randomize 1124 patients to standard therapy (not to include beta-blockers as patients must have a contraindication to be enrolled) or standard therapy plus pacemaker implantation and beta-blocker. The primary end point is the composite end point of total mortality plus nonfatal reinfarction.",

Part of this earlier work used self-competition zonal elution studies to measure association equilibrium constants between immobilized AGP and R- or S-propranolol. It was later found that analysis of these data by a common equation derived for linear elution conditions gave erroneous values for experiments actually conducted under nonlinear conditions. This report discusses the nature of this error and uses frontal analysis to estimate the true binding strength between R- and S-propranolol and HPLC columns containing immobilized AGP.", 
    "176": "The aim of our present study was to evaluate the in vitro percutaneous absorption of atenolol, a well-known antihypertensive, from a series of formulations containing various penetration enhancers. Particularly the promoting effect of EPA and DHA, two polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has been studied, and drug permeation data have been compared with those obtained with the other formulations containing \"classic\" penetration enhancers such as transcutol, d-limonene, and PG. Not all the penetration enhancers tested were effective in increasing atenolol percutaneous flux and the best permeation profile for atenolol was obtained with the formulation containing transcutol (B) and PUFA (E). To explain the enhancer mechanism, the atenolol diffusion and partitioning coefficients from the different formulations were calculated. The results indicated that PUFAs increased the apparent diffusion coefficient of the drugs but did not affect their apparent stratum corneum (SC)/vehicle partition coefficient (K(m)). At this same time transcutol exerted its enhancer effect increasing significantly the apparent SC/vehicle partition coefficient (K(m)) and in a minor amount the apparent diffusion coefficient of skin permeation process (D(m)). The potential application of formulations B and E in atenolol percutaneous absorption was determined from the calculation of the steady-state plasma concentrations (C(ss)). These values resulted within the drug therapeutic range and suggest that atenolol transdermal delivery could be feasible.",
