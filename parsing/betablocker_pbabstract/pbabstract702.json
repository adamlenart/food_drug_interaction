The increased susceptibility to strophanthine that occurs during 10 days of sensitization with HCA and depends on dissociation of the mechanisms of specific and nonspecific immunity can be prevented by simultaneous administration of diphenhydramine, methyluracil, hydrocortisone and the beta-adrenoblocker, alpheprol. This increase can be also abolished by premedication with alpheprol and trimecain.", 
    "1": "This study has examined the relationship between the Purkinje fiber content of propranolol and effects on membrane repolarization time during prolonged exposure to low concentrations of propranolol in vitro. Canine Purkinje fibers were exposed to both dl-propranolol, 3.4 X 10(-7) M (0.1 microgram/ml) and 1.7 X 10(-6) M (0.5 micrograms/ml), and to d-propranolol, 3.4 X 10(-7) M (0.1 micrograms/ml), in Tyrode's solution for 90 to 180 min. Purkinje fibers exhibited continuous decreases in repolarization time throughout the exposure periods and fibers analyzed for propranolol content demonstrated continuous cumulation of the drug with time. A maximum 8% decrease in repolarization time was observed after 3.4 X 10(-7) M and a 30% decrease after 1.7 X 10(-6) M propranolol. A 40-fold cumulation of propranolol by the Purkinje fibers was found after both concentrations at or near equilibrium. A high degree of correlation (r = 0.98; P < .001) existed between changes in electrical activity and tissue content of propranolol. Extrapolation to zero effect showed a threshold tissue content of propranolol of approximately 1.0 microgram/g, which corresponds to a bath concentration of 25 ng/ml (8 X 10(-8) M). Changes in membrane potentials were the result of direct membrane effects of propranolol, based on the fact that d-propranolol produced membrane alterations and tissue cumulation identical to those produced by the racemic drug.", 
    "2": "Propranolol kinetics was studied in six hyperthyroid and six hypothyroid patients who received single oral and intravenous doses of propranolol when they had thyroid dysfunction and again when they had become euthyroid. Change in thyroid status from hyperthyroid to euthyroid produced no change in the elimination half-life (t 1/2) of oral propranolol (3.2 +/- 0.5 to 4.1 +/- 0.7 hr), the oral clearance (38.4 +/- 7.3 to 27.4 +/- 2.4 ml/min/kg), the elimination t 1/2 of intravenous propranolol (2.5 +/- 0.3 to 3.5 +/- 0.7 hr), and the apparent volume of distribution (4.8 +/- 0.4 to 3.8 +/- 0.5 l/kg). The systemic clearance of propranolol, however, was greater when the patients were hyperthyroid (20.8 +/- 2.5 ml/min/kg) than when they had become euthyroid (11.7 +/- 1.7 ml/min/kg). The elimination t 1/2 after oral propranolol was longer in the hypothyroid (3.7 +/- 0.5 hr) than in the euthyroid state (2.0 +/- 0.1 hr). No other changes were observed in the kinetic parameters measured when these hypothyroid patients had become euthyroid. Adequate beta-adrenoceptor blockade in hyperthyroid patients may require higher propranolol dosage than expected.", 
    "3": "1 The technique of continuous recording of intra-arterial blood pressure in ambulant hypertensives has been used to investigate the effects of a long-acting formulation of propranolol (propranolol LA). 2 Seven subjects with untreated essential hypertension were studied before and 2 months after commencing treatment with propranolol LA once daily in the morning, results showing that smooth control of blood pressure and heart rate occurred throughout 24 h. 3 Bicycle ergometry tests performed by these subjects during both studies showed significant blood pressure reduction by propranolol LA during the mild and moderate grades of dynamic exercise. 4 In a parallel study where six treated hypertensives were monitored before and after substitution of standard propranolol by the 'LA' form, close correspondence of blood pressure throughout the 24 h occurred with each regimen.", 
    "4": "1 A double-blind-crossover randomised trial was performed to compare the effects of oxyfedrine (maximum dose 32 mg three times daily), propranolol (maximum dose 120 mg three times daily) and placebo in 30 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. Assessment was by means of symptom level, ECG responses to graded exercise and haematological and biochemical investigation. 2 Oxyfedrine and propranolol resulted in similar significant improvements in symptom level (P < 0.05 in both cases), and ST index (propranolol P < 0.02; oxyfedrine P < 0.05). Neither drug produced any significant changes in haematologaical or biochemical investigations and only infrequent minor side effects were noted. 3 These results indicate that oxyfedrine is a safe and well-tolerated drug with an efficacy comparable with that of propranolol in the treatment of patients with angina pectoris.", 
    "5": "Autonomic mechanisms underlying the initial heart rate response to standing were analyzed in nine normal subjects. The normal pattern of response was altered by atropine to a small and gradual R-R interval shortening over 30 beats, with no rebound R-R interval lengthening. With additional propranolol, R-R interval shortening was even less and confined to the first 15-20 beats, whereas propranolol alone did not affect the normal response pattern, showing that this is under vagal control with increased cardiac sympathetic activity occurring only if the vagus is blocked. The response was reproducible in 23 normal subjects. Heart rate variation during quiet standing was almost completely abolished by atropine, but unaffected by propranolol, confirming that it is also under vagal control. In four normal subjects no rebound R-R interval lengthening occurred during either \"fast\" or \"slow\" tilt, whereas it was present during both \"slow\" and \"fast\" standing. The rebound R-R interval lengthening is determined by the muscular activity involved in standing up, rather than by the speed of the maneuver.", 
    "6": "Patients who undergo cardiac catheterization are frequently taking propranolol and are often premedicated with diazepam. Because the intensity of a drug's action is determined by free, or non-protein-bound, levels in plasma, changes in the degree of protein binding may profoundly alter the pharmacologic effect. We examined the effects of heparin on the free levels of propranolol and diazepam in six patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. After heparinization, the free fraction of diazepam increased more than fourfold, from 1.8 +/- 0.1% to 7.9 +/- 1.2% (p < 0.002) and the free levels increased from 2.0 +/- 0.5 to 8.4 +/- 2.2 ng/ml (p < 0.025); the free fraction of propranolol increased from 7.4 +/- 0.9% to 12.5 +/- 1.4% (p < 0.001). The increase in free drug concentration was associated with elevated free fatty acid levels, which rose from 181 +/- 7 micrograms/ml to 596 +/- 119 micrograms/ml (p < 0.02). Increases in the free levels of propranolol and diazepam produced by heparinization during cardiac catheterization may result in increased pharmacolaogic effect, such as excessive sedation or respiratory depression.", 
    "7": "No information is available about the effects of oral atenolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent with no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, on left ventricular function. Atenolol, 100 mg/day, was given to 12 hypertensive patients for 8 weeks, and its effects on mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac index (CI) and ejection indexes of myocardial performance were examined by echocardiography. Echocardiographic studies were performed before treatment, after 4 weeks of placebo, and repeated after 4 and 8 weeks of atenolol therapy. MAP fell by 14% and 21% after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. CI fell by 22% and 20% and stroke index (SI) fell by 11% and 7%. Calculated peripheral resistance did not change significantly. Fractional shortening, ejection fraction and normalized mean rate of circumferential fiber shortening did not change. The normalized mean posterior wall velocity decreased after 4 weeks but returned to pretreatment levels after 8 weeks. The septal velocity increased after 8 weeks. End-diastolic volume index (EDVI) did not change, and there was no relationship between changes in heart rate and EDVI. The study shows that atenolol in the resting state has no effect on certain echocardiographic indexes of left ventricular (LV) function when given orally to hypertensive patients with normal LV size and function. The reduction in CI and SI were presumably secondary to a decrease in cardiac venous filling.", 
    "8": "We studied the effects of the local anesthetics, procaine and benzocaine, on the action potential and force of canine ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibers. In ventricular muscle, procaine often shifted the plateau to a more positive value and increased the force of contraction, whereas benzocaine shortened the action potential and decreased contractile force. In Purkinje fibers, both local anesthetics reduced contractile force and decreased the duration of the action potential markedly. In ventricular muscle fibers norepinephrine potentiated the positive inotropic effect of procaine and changed the effects of benzocaine from a negative to a positive inotropic effect. The potentiating effect of procaine on contraction was eliminated by propranolol. In the presence of norepinephrine (and the absence of propranolol), in Purkinje fibers both anesthetics decreased force but less than in the absence of norepinephrine. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and norepinephrine, procaine and benzocaine increased contractile force of muscle fibers. Under the same conditions in Purkinje fibers, procaine increased contractile force and benzocaine decreased it (but less than in the absence of TTX). Administration of veratridine increased contractile force in both ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibers: under these conditions, both local anesthetics decreased contractile force in both tissues. We conclude that: (1) the positive inotropic effects of procaine and benzocaine are mediated through an adrenergic mechanism; (2) the negative inotropic effect is at least in part mediated through a reduction of sodium influx; and (3) the negative inotropic effect is more pronounced in Purkinje fibers because of a larger steady state sodium influx during the plateau.", 
    "9": "In this study we report on the effect of Bupranolol eye drops on 10 patients who, prior to treatment, experienced decompensation of their glaucoma in spite of the use of miotics or who were not given biotics treatment because of their occupation or because of severe subjective complaints. Treatment with Bupranolol is given for six months and results in clear reduction of intraocular pressure in all patients, so that satisfactory control can be achieved with Bupranolol eye drops either alone or in combination with a miotic agent. As a rule, Bupranolol is tolerated well by all patients.", 
    "10": "Craviten, a newly synthesized ester of optically active 2-aminobutanol-1, produced in cats hypotension and inhibited excitability of sinus node and atrio-ventricular and intraventricular conduction. It acts as a spasmolytic on the isolated rabbit ileum, being approx. 100 times as potent as papaverine. Studies with drugs affecting the vegetative system indicate that the hypotensive and spasmolytic action of Craviten consists in a direct depressing action on smooth musculature.", 
    "11": "The mean hepatic extraction ratio (ER) of propranolol was estimated directly by simultaneous measurements of arterial and hepatic venous blood concentrations of the drug following systemic venous and portal venous administration in the rat. The ER was greater than 0.9 in the dose range of 2.5 to 12.5 mg/kg following rapid infusion of propranolol into the femoral vein and was not dependent on infusion rate. On the other hand, the ER following intraportal constant-rate infusion decreased progressively with increasing dose, although the ER at an intraportal dose of 2.5 mg/kg was as high as that found after administration into the femoral vein. In addition, it was found that the ER at an intraportal dose of 12.5 mg/kg of propranolol was significantly influenced by infusion rate. The unusual AUC-dose relationship of propranolol previously reported in the rat could be explained on the basis of the present nonlinear hepatic extraction depending on the route and rate of administration which was clarified in vivo. The nonlinear hepatic extraction was further confirmed by determining the remarkably decreased ER of (14)C-propranolol given intravenously after pretreatment or during portal venous administration of unlabelled propranolol.", 
    "12": "Subacute toxicity and recovery tests of labetalol hydrochloride, alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, were carried out using male and female Wistar strain rats. The drug was orally administered at 50, 150, 450 or 1000 mg/kg/day for 1 month. In all the drug-treated groups, increase in salivation was observed from immediately to 15 minutes after dosing through the treatment period. Eight of the 10 males and 9 of the 10 females in the group treated with 1000 mg/kg/day died of intoxication. Suppression of body weight gain was observed in male rats in the 450 and 1000 mg/kg/day groups and in female rats in the 1000 mg/kg/day group. In the 150 mg/kg/day and higher dose groups, water consumption showed a tendency to increase as compared with that of control group. Increase in urine volume was observed in female rats in the 450 mg/kg/day group. In the serum biochemical examination, slight elevation in potassium levels was noted in the 150 and 450 mg/kg/day groups. In histopathological findings, some abnormalities were found in the groups treated at 150 mg/kg/day and higher. Major abnormalities found in organs were; congestion and hypremia of various organs due to vasodilation, swelling of parenchymatous cells in liver and kidneys, and loose arrangement and change in the thickness of muscle fibers in cardiac and skeletal muscles. None of these abnormal findings was found in any examination in recovery tests.", 
    "13": "Radionuclide imaging of the left ventricular blood pool provides a convenient non-invasive method of monitoring left ventricular function. Left ventricular function is characterised by the left ventricular curve which represents all phases of the cardiac cycle and is obtained by a multiple gated equilibrium method (MUGA). Volume curves were obtained over a minimum 1 1/2 h period in 15 normal subjects and in 20 thyrotoxic patients. Changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), maximum ejection fraction rate and total electromechanical time interval were recorded from volume curve data. To assess the effect of pharmacological intervention, serial measurements of LVEF were made before and after 40 mg oral propranolol. In thyrotoxic patients, LVEF decreased by 17% of the initial value and in normal subjects by less than 10% following propranolol. This method can be extended to assess the effects of physiological or pharmacological intervention on left ventricular function in other disease states.", 
    "14": "Ulcerous impairments of gastric mucosa and an increase in activity of some enzymes in blood plasma were observed in rats after severe emotional-pain stress (EPS). The activity of cytoplasmic enzymes in blood plasma reached maximal values immediately after EPS and then returned to the initial level within the first day. At the same time, activity of lysosomal enzymes reached the highest values only at the end of the first day after EPS and their increased activity was maintained within 5 days. Ulcerous impairments of stomach as well as destruction of cellular membranes, responsible for an increase in the enzymatic activity in blood plasma, might be prevented by beta-adrenoblocking agent inderal. These data suggested that the impairments were due to the effect of excessive amount of catecholamines. Antioxidants dibunol and OP-6, administered prior to EPS, prevented the impairments caused by stress more effectively as compared with inderal; other antioxidants--alpha-tocopherol acetate and sodium selenite were less effective. The data obtained support the assumption on the leading role of lipid peroxidation in pathogenesis of the stress impairments; these data established that the impairments caused by stress might be prevented using the combination of antioxidants and beta-adrenoblocking agents.", 
    "15": "Myocardial substrate extraction, coronary sinus flow, cardiac output, and left ventricular pressure were measured at increasing pacing rates before and after propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) in 13 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) during diagnostic cardiac catheterisation. At the lowest pacing rate myocardial oxygen consumption varied considerably between patients and very high values were found in several individuals (range 10.1 to 57.5 ml/min). These large differences between patients were not explicable by differences in cardiac work; consequently, cardiac efficiency, estimated from the oxygen cost of external work, varied between patients and was lower than normal in all but two. The pattern of substrate extraction at the lowest pacing rate was similar to results reported for the normal heart, and measured oxygen consumption could be accounted for by complete oxidation of the substrates extracted; thus there was no evidence of a gross abnormality of oxidative metabolism, suggesting that low efficiency lay in the utilisation rather than in the production of energy. Each of the four patients with the highest myocardial oxygen consumption and lowest values of efficiency sustained progressive reductions in lactate and pyruvate extraction as heart rate increased, and at the highest pacing rate had low (< 3%) or negative lactate extraction ratios. In three of these four, coronary sinus flow did not increase progressively with each increment in heart rate. One patient with low oxygen consumption and normal efficiency also failed to increase coronary flow with the final increment in heart rate, and produced lactate at the highest pacing rate. Thus the five patients in whom pacing provoked biochemical evidence of ischaemia all had excessive myocardial oxygen demand and/or limited capacity to increase coronary flow. Propranolol did not change lactate extraction significantly at any pacing rate in either the ischaemic or non-ischaemic groups. In only one patient was ischaemia at the highest pacing rate abolished after propranolol, and this was associated with a 30 per cent reduction in oxygen consumption. These results do not demonstrate a direct effect of propranolol upon myocardial metabolism in patients with HOCM, but emphasise the potential value of beta-blockade in protecting these patients from excessive increases in heart rate.", 
    "16": "A previous double-blind study carried out for 17 weeks on 50 patients with open-angle glaucoma reported on the results of treatment with Timolol and Pilocarpine eye drops. On completion of a long-term study with Timolol over a two-year period, the remaining findings can now be given. Of the 25 patients treated twice a day with 0.1% to 0.5% Timolol eye drops, intraocular pressure was not adequately controlled in six patients with the use of Timolol alone, and treatment had to be discontinued after three to five weeks. In the remaining 19 patients, intraocular pressure was controlled well over the entire two-year period, but in some cases it was necessary after a while to increase the dosage to a higher concentration. The following checks were carried out regularly in accordance with a fixed schedule: intraocular pressure, tonographic examination, visual acuity, pupil size, visual field, pulse and blood pressure, tear production (Schirmer test), slit-lamp biomicroscopy and fundaloscopy. Evaluation of the results shows that in the long term Timolol reduced intraocular pressure by 31%. There were no changes in visual acuity, visual field, excavation and degeneration of the optic disc, or slit lamp examination findings. During treatment with Timolol the mean pulse rate decreased by 12%, and there was a drop in blood pressure of 3.8% systolic and 2.8% diastolic. Moreover, tear production decreased by 10.2%. During the entire observation period there were no local or systemic side-effects, nor any adverse reaction. The six patients whose intraocular pressure was not reduced satisfactorily by Timolol alone were treated successfully with a combination of Timolol and miotics. A dosage without additional Timolol would not have sufficed for any of the patients.", 
    "17": "No benefit attributable to propranolol (1000 mg/day) could be detected in a trial lasting at least 22 weeks, 6 weeks of which was double-blind placebo-controlled, in 5 chronic schizophrenic patients. The mean propranolol CSF/plasma ration was 0.08, and there was good agreement between CSF and free plasma propranolol levels. Basal plasma prolactin was slightly but insignificantly reduced by propranolol, and metoclopramide-stimulated prolactin release was unaffected. Propranolol was associated with a significant temporary increase in HVA, a non-significant rise in 5-HIAA and a significant decrease in MHPG, in the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid of 4 patients.", 
    "18": "Drug withdrawal syndromes reportedly have been caused by numerous pharmacological agents, but only a few drugs have been adequately studied in this regard. Criteria for evaluating drug withdrawal syndromes have been proposed. Sedative-hypnotic agents, opiates, corticosteroids, clonidine, tricyclic antidepressant medications and beta-adrenergic blocking agents meet the criteria for such syndromes. Gradual tapering of the dose of these drugs is recommended when therapy must be discontinued. Whether or not other drugs cause rebound reactions is questionable, but caution should be used when discontinuing drugs for which numerous reports of withdrawal syndromes exist.", 
    "19": "Should patients with ocular hypertension be treated to prevent glaucomatous visual field loss? Three considerations suggest that for most patients the answer is no. First, the average risk of visual field loss in untreated ocular hypertension is small. Population surveys and prospective studies indicate that no more than about one of every nine persons with intraocular pressures higher than 20 mm Hg will develop a visual field defect. Secondly, treatment of ocular hypertension to lower intraocular pressure is unproven efficacy in preventing visual field defects. Thirdly, adverse reactions to glaucoma therapy occur frequently and are sometimes serious. Although pressure reduction may be indicated for some patients who possess certain risk factors which make them especially susceptible to glaucomatous damage, for most patients \"no treatment\" is the best management. Untreated patients must be observed carefully with periodic visual field and optic disc examinations.", 
    "20": "To show whether repeated administration of atenolol for several days would influence its pharmacokinetic parameters and the extent and duration of the pharmacologic responses, the plasma level of atenolol and changes in heart rate, blood pressure and plasma renin activity were measured in 12 hypertensive patients at various times of day (9 a. m., 12 noon, 3 p. m. and 7 p. m.) after oral administration of the first dose of atenolol 100 mg, again during the 7th and 14th days of continued once-daily administration of the same dose, and finally during the three days following withdrawal of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of atenolol (about 600 ng/ml) was found 3 h after administration of the first dose, and measurable amounts (50-70 ng/ml) were found after 24 h. None of the pharmacokinetic characteristics were changed by administration of a single daily dose for two weeks. After withdrawal of the drug, detectable amounts of atenolol were found in plasma for at least 48 h. The first dose of atenolol caused prompt (3 h) and prolonged (up to 24 h) lowering of supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressures, slowing of supine and standing heart rate, reduction of the blood pressure and heart rate responses to dynamic exercise, and a decrease in plasma renin activity. The extent and time-course of all these responses were not influenced by repeated once-daily administration of the 100 mg dose for two weeks. Most of the effects continued during the withdrawal days, the lowering of blood pressure being somewhat more prolonged than the slowing of heart rate. It is concluded that a once-daily dose of atenolol 100 mg decreases blood pressure and heart rate throughout the following 24 h, without excessive daily fluctuation in its effects, and without signs of tolerance or accumulation.", 
    "21": "Because beta blockers have been shown to reduce glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the renal effect of intravenous and prolonged oral administration of pindolol was examined in 10 patients with essential hypertension. Intravenous pindolol decreased inulin clearance from 99 to 94 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.005), and pulse rate from 75 to 69/min (p < 0.005). Blood pressure and filtration fraction were not changed. Oral pindolol (10 to 20 mg/day) for a mean of 6 mo resulted in a decrease in mean blood pressure from 124 to 111 mm Hg (p < 0.001), in mean pulse rate from 76 to 69/min (p < 0.005), and in mean plasma renin activity (PRA) from 0.9 to 0.29 ng/ml/hr (p < 0.05). Inulin clearance and filtration fraction did not change. At the end of oral therapy, intravenous pindolol induced a greater reduction in inulin clearance than in the first study. These observations indicate that intravenous pindolol induces a decrease in GFR probably secondary to hemodynamic effects. On the other hand, prolonged oral pindolol has no effect on GFR despite decreases in blood pressure, pulse rate, and PRA.",

    "23": "In 1972--1973, 785 symptom-free men, aged 40 to 49 years, without target organ damage, with systolic blood pressures between 150 and 179 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 110 mm Hg, were assigned at random to one of two groups: (406 to a drug treatment group and 379 to a control group) for a five-year controlled drug treatment trial to evaluate the effect of therapy on cardiovascular complications. Drug treatment started with hydrochlorothiazide. If systolic blood pressure remained above 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure above 90 mm Hg, alphamethyldopa was added. If there were side effects, methyldopa was replaced with propranolol. The control group was not given a placebo. The mean observation time was 66 months (range 60 to 78 months). A difference in blood pressure between groups of about 17 mm Hg systolic and 10 mm Hg diastolic was maintained throughout the study. The study protocol had a rather low \"ethical\" blood pressure roof, 180 mm Hg systolic and/or 110 mm Hg diastolic. Seventeen percent of the control group had an increase in blood pressure above this level during the trial, and drug treatment was started. There was no effect on major cardiovascular morbidity comparing groups as established by randomization, with 18 events in the treatment group and 20 events in the control group. There was no difference between the groups in total mortality and mortality from cardiovascular events. However, in the subgroups with diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg before randomization, there was a probable reduction in total morbidity from cardiovascular events in favor or the group receiving drug therapy, 7.6 and 16.4 percent events in the treated and control groups, respectively. Cerebrovascular events occurred only in the control group, 7 versus 0. Two cases of fatal aortic aneurysms also occurred in the control group. Other \"pressure\" complications, such as marked left ventricular hypertrophy in the electrocardiogram and left ventricular failure, occurred only in the control group. However, regarding coronary heart disease, including sudden death, the incidence tended to be higher in the treated group, although it was not statistically significant. Only 13 men (1.7 percent) failed to meet for regular examinations. At the end of the study these men were also followed up with regard to possible cardiovascular events.", 
    "24": "To assess the adrenergic mechanisms responsible for the effect of epinephrine on glucose production and glucose clearance in man, epinephrine (50 ng/kg/min) was infused in the presence and absence of alpha adrenergic (phentolamine) and beta adrenergic (propranolol) antagonists under conditions when plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon levels were allowed to vary and when they were clamped by a concurrent infusion of glucose, somatostatin, and insulin. When plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon were permitted to vary during beta adrenergic blockade, plasma glucose and glucose production increased, respectively, 32% and 42% less and plasma epinephrine concentrations were threefold greater than those during infusion of epinephrine alone; plasma insulin decreased during beta blockade but increased during infusion of epinephrine alone; glucose clearance was comparably suppressed in both instances. When alpha adrenergic blockade was superimposed on beta blockade, the increase in glucose production and the decrease in both plasma insulin and glucose clearance observed during infusion of epinephrine alone was virtually abolished. In contrast, when plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon were clamped, beta adrenergic blockade completely prevented the suppression of glucose clearance by epinephrine and inhibited the stimulation of glucose production by epinephrine by 80% whereas alpha adrenergic blockade had no effect on either of these parameters. These results indicate that in man, epinephrine increases glucose production and decreases glucose clearance by both alpha and beta adrenergic actions. The alpha adrenergic effects could be accounted for by inhibition of insulin secretion. The mechanism for the beta adrenergic effects remains to be defined but may reflect a direct action of epinephrine on hepatic and peripheral tissues.", 
    "25": "To evaluate the effect of epinephrine on the circulating amino acids, we infused epinephrine into normal human subjects and juvenile-onset diabetic patients given a constant basal infusion of insulin. Epinephrine infusion produced an identical 350--400 pg/ml rise in plasma epinephrine in both groups. In normal subjects, epinephrine caused a progressive 26% reduction in total circulating amino acids, despite unchanged levels of plasma insulin. This effect was most pronounced for the branched amino acids, which fell by 40% (P < 0.001). Plasma alanine was the only amino acid which failed to decline. Similarly, infusion of epinephrine in the insulin-infused diabetics produced a 23% fall in total amino acids, a 37% decline in branched chain amino acids, but no change in plasma alanine. Saline infusion in the insulin-infused diabetics had no effect on plasma amino acid concentrations. In addition, when epinephrine was infused into two insulin-withdrawn diabetics, a comparable hypoaminoacidemic response was observed. The infusion of propranolol in both normal and diabetic subjects totally prevented the epinephrine-induced fall in plasma amino acids. It is concluded that (1) increments in epinephrine similar to those observed in stress cause a decline in circulating amino acids (except alanine) which is greatest for the branched chain amino acids; (2) this hypoaminoacidemic effect occurs in the absence of a rise in plasma insulin and diabetic subjects, as well; and (3) epinephrine-induced changes in amino acid regulation are prevented by beta-adrenergic blockade. Our findings suggest that, in contrast with glucose and fat metabolism, epinephrine and insulin may have similar, rather than antagonistic, effects on plasma amino acid metabolism.", 
    "26": "Adrenaline (A) causes gross lesions of the ventricular wall in frogs living both at 12 degrees and 25 degrees. At 12 degrees the sensitivity of the heart to A is higher than at 25 degrees. Single or multiple ventricular aneurysm, provided by A could not be prevented by propranolol. The resistance of the myocardium towards cyanide anoxia is lowered after A especially at 25 degrees. In preliminary experiments with noradrenaline the same cardiotoxic effects are observed.", 
    "27": "We have investigated the hormonal responsiveness of K562 cells using a serum-substituted in vitro clonogenic assay. Dexamethasone inhibited colony formation by the K562 cells, and the inhibitory effect could be reversed by progesterone (10(-6) M). Fluoxymesterone caused a prominent enhancement of K562 colony growth, whereas estriol had no effect. Stimulation by triiodothyronine was maximal at 10(-7) M, and the thyroid effect could be abrogated by the beta 2-adrenergic antagonist butoxamine in equimolar concentrations. Using standard tissue culture conditions, the beta-adrenergic agent isoproterenol, but not the alpha catecholamine phenylephrine, enhanced the proliferation of K562 cells. When K562 cells were grown under hormone-depleted conditions, they developed responsiveness to phenylephrine and were no longer stimulated by isoproterenol. DbcAMP and prostaglandins of the E series also caused K562 colony enhancement. Prostaglandin F2 alpha had no effect on cell proliferation. Insulin was an effective stimulant of colony formation of K562 cells, as were human growth hormone and ovine prolacin. Bovine growth hormone had no effect. Our results are consistent with the identificaiton of K562 as an erythroid line, and they indicate that K562 cells respond to endocrine hormones in a manner analogous to normal erythroid progenitors.", 
    "28": "The effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on the respiratory response to carbon dioxide rebreathing was studied in eight normal subjects. Propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol, and placebo were given in random, double-blind fashion. Subjects were studied before each treatment period, after one dose, and after eight days of treatment with each drug. A rebreathing method was used to produce progressive hypercapnia and the respiratory response was assessed by measuring minute ventilation and maximum rate of change of inspiratory mouth pressure. Beta-blockade was assessed by the reduction in heart rate during steady state exercise on a cycle ergometer. There was no change in the respiratory response to carbon dioxide after a single dose or eight days treatment of any drug. All three active drugs produced a significant reduction in exercise heart rate. The forced expiratory volume in one second was not altered by any of the drugs.", 
    "29": "In 1969 within pilot studies in an Erfurt district altogether 254 patients with definitive hypertension as well as 208 patients with borderline hypertension of the male age groups from 1914 to 1923 were recognized. 135 test persons with definitive hypertension (RR--160/95 Torr) were treated antihypertensively within a clinical and ambulatory preventive programme for 8 years and compared with a control group of the same age (119 males of 45-54 years) concerning the presence of possible complications of hypertension, which was treated with unsatisfactory results. By a strict, permanently normotensive decrease of blood pressure--as pharmacotherapy above all the beta-receptor blocker propranolol alone or in the approved combination therapy with dihydralazine and/or hydrochlorothiazide was used--in connection with suitable measures for the intervention of other individual factors with effect on heart and circulation the risk of complications in definitive hypertension could be reduced. Taking into consideration the own long-term observations the necessity of a possibly early beginning medicamentous, antihypertensive permanent therapy of hypertension is without doubt, in borderline hypertension, however, it still remains actual subject of the discussion.", 
    "30": "Two groups of patients with hypertension ( n = 16 and 20) with comparable average age and degree of severity of clinical hypertension were controlled in an ambulatory long-term investigation for 18 months. While one group was treated with an antihypertensive standard therapy, the other group got a fixed combination of dihydralazin and propranolol. In both groups a significant decrease of the systolic and diastolic initial blood pressure was seen, which was more pronounced in the second group. Side-effects of drugs more frequently appeared in the first group. On the other hand, the total cost were higher in the second group. Nevertheless, the stronger effect, the smaller number of tablets as well as the lower rates of side-effects pleads for the combination dihydralazin-propranolol.", 
    "31": "The short-term efficacy of oral acebutolol was evaluated in 20 patients with coronary artery disease and frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) by serial 24-hour Holter monitoring before and while the patients were receiving an average daily dose of 1,100 mg. of acebutolol for four weeks. Fifty-five percent of the 20 patients showed a greater than 70% PVC reduction from baseline values. The only serious side effect during short-term therapy was mild, reversible cardiac decompensation in one patient. The long-term safety and continued efficacy of acebutolol was then evaluated over the next 11 months in nine of the 11 patients showing greater than 70% PVC reduction at four weeks. Two-thirds of these nine patients continued to show greater than 80% PVC reduction from baseline values at 12 months. One patient developed alopecia during long-term therapy. The majority of patients not responding well to acebutolol at four weeks had an actual increase in PVCs on acebutolol therapy. We conclude that acebutolol produces long-term, effective reduction in PVCs without serious toxicity in the majority of patients with ventricular ectopy. However, this drug appears to either produce an excellent response or no response with regard to PVC control in most instances.", 
    "32": "Sustak and obsidan were given separately and in combination to 99 patients with acute myocardial infarction and frequent attacks of angina pectoris. With the use of these agents the attacks of angina pectoris were very rare. The course of the disease and the prognosis were more favourable in the group of patients treated with anti-anginal agents than in the control group (100 patients).", 
    "33": "The electrophysiologic effects of calcium channel blocking agents, diltiazem, verapamil and nifedipine, on the sinus node function were examined in 43 anesthetized closed-chest dogs in comparison with the effects of propranolol. The parameters of sinus node function, i.e. sinus cycle length (SCL), sinus node recovery time determined by overdrive suppression (SRT), both of which are thought to reflect sinus node automaticity, and sinoatrial conduction time estimated by Strauss method (SACT), were evaluated. Intravenously administered diltiazem (0.2 mg/kg), verapamil (0.1 mg/kg) and propranolol (0.1 approximately 0.2 mg/kg) increased SCL and SRT significantly although the increase of these parameters induced by nifedipine (0.03 mg/kg) was not statistically significant. The calcium channel blocking agents did not significantly affect SACT in contrast with propranolol which showed a prolonging effect. Thus calcium channel blocking agents suppressed sinus node automaticity yet had little effect on sinoatrial conduction.", 
    "34": "Noradrenaline (NA) sensitizes rat brain (Na+ + K+)-ATPase to inhibition by ethanol (EtOH). This effect of NA increases with the degree of enrichment of the enzyme: 0.1 mM NA + 0.05 M EtOH produced 27% inhibition in whole brain homogenates, 40% in 2.5-fold purified P2 fractions, and 45% in 5-fold purified microsomal fractions. The sensitization by NA was prevented by 0.1 microM phentolamine but not by 100 microM propranolol. Adrenaline and phenylephrine also sensitized the enzyme to EtOH inhibition in all of the fractions but isoproterenol did not. For all three alpha agonists the degree of sensitization was concentration dependent and the degree of reversal of this effect varied with the concentration of phentolamine added. These findings suggest that the NA + EtOH interaction is a direct effect on the membrane, probably mediated by an alpha receptor modified perturbation of the membrane microenvironment of the enzyme.", 
    "35": "The part of noradrenergic mechanisms in self-stimulation (SS) operant behaviour was studied in rats. In all experiments systolic blood pressure (BP) in the tail artery was measured by means of photocells. It was found, that small doses of noradrenaline facilitate the SS, while high doses depress or stop it. The depressive effect is accompanied by a marked increase of BP. Effective blockade of beta-adrenoceptive structures by inderal suppresses SS, and the inhibitory effect is accompanied by a small decrease of BP. Suppressing effect of alpha-adrenoblocking agent, phentolamine, is even more pronounced, but is accompanied by a marked decrease of BP. Beta-agonist isadrin causes a marked facilitation of SS without changes of BP. It is suggested that positive reward in the lateral hypothalamus is due to a direct stimulation of beta-adrenoceptive noradrenergic neuronal elements. Chronic neurogenic hypertension is developed by an overloading of the higher nervous activity. In chronic hypertensive rats there is a pronounced suppression of SS. A transient fail of BP caused by injection of catapresan (hemiton) results in a temporary recovery of normal SS behaviour. It may be concluded that reduction of lever-pressing rate during acute and chronic neurogenic hypertensions is related to baroreceptor mechanisms. The role of the autonomic nervous system in SS behaviour is discussed.", 
    "36": "The enzyme of prolyl hydroxylase was prepared from the rat aorta. The prolyl hydroxylase activity was measured by the tritium release assay in vitro. Propranolol at concentrations of 3 X 10(-6)M, 10(-5)M inhibited the prolyl hydroxylase activity by 20.6%, 69.8% and 93.7% of control activity, respectively, when the reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min. It is suggested that propranolol may exert some influence on the collagen biosynthesis of the blood vessels.", 
    "37": "We studied plasma levels of cyclic nucleotides and their responses to submaximal exercise as an endogenous adrenergic stimulation in normal subjects, untreated and treated patients with essential hypertension to assess the roles of various hormones and the autonomic nervous system in essential hypertension. Plasma c-AMP level was significantly higher in untreated, diuretic-treated patients and those treated with propranolol than in normal subjects, but plasma c-GMP level was comparable in normal subjects and untreated patients. Plasma c-AMP decreased significantly, whereas plasma c-GMP increase significantly, after chronic propranolol therapy. Plasma c-AMP increased significantly after submaximal exercise in normal subjects, untreated patients and those treated with propranolol, but plasma c-GMP increased significantly only in normal subjects. The increase in plasma c-AMP was significantly higher in untreated patients than in normal subjects and patients treated with propranolol. Moreover, the percent increase in plasma c-AMP was significantly higher in untreated patients than in those treated with propranolol. Therefore, it is suggested that the sympathetic nervous system may be hyperactive, and that a hyperreactivity of the beta-adrenergic receptors may play an important role in essential hypertension.", 
    "38": "A fluorescence receptor binding assay, based upon the high-affinity beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, is utilized to probe the microenvironment of the antagonist-receptor complex in the frog (Rana catesbeiana) erythrocyte membrane. The technique of steady-state fluorescence depolarization is applied to the propranolol-receptor complex, allowing quantitation of the rotational relaxation time of the complex. It is found that the complex is dynamically constrained at 20 degrees C. However, in the temperature range 6-10 degrees C a sharp reversible release of constraint is observed. It is further demonstrated that the addition of drugs that are known to specifically disrupt the cytoskeleton (colchicine, vincristine, and vinblastine) causes a similar but irreversible release of constraint at 20 degrees C. Cytochalasin B has a much smaller influence on the rotational mobility of the propranolol-receptor complex than do the other drugs that disrupt the cytoskeleton. Amphotericin B is without effect on the rotational constraint of the complex. Binding of the antagonist [3H]dihydroalprenolol is not influenced by colchicine. A model is proposed which postulates that cytoskeletal elements are linked to the antagonist-receptor complex. Antagonist binding does not result in cytoskeletal release, whereas agonist binding is postulated to lead to dissociation of the agonist-receptor complex from the cytoskeleton, thereby activating adenylate cyclase.", 
    "39": "In pithed dogs pressor responses to phenylephrine were completely inhibited 1 h after phenoxybenzamine 20 mg/kg i.v., but those to norepinephrine were only partially inhibited. The pressor effects of norepinephrine in phenoxybenzamine-treated animals were inhibited by yohimbine, 2.0 mg/kg i.v., but not by prazosin, 0.5 mg/kg i.v. In animals treated with phenoxybenzamine, 20 mg/kg i.v., plus propranolol, 5.0 mg/kg i.v., the partially restored pressor response to epinephrine, and the responses to norepinephrine, were completely inhibited by yohimbine, 2.0 mg/kg i.v., partially inhibited by corynanthine, 5.0 mg/kg i.v., but not affected by prazosin, 0.5 mg/kg i.v. In additional animals treated with phenoxybenzamine plus propranolol, yohimbine, 10, 50, 200 and 500 microgram/kg i.v., caused dose-related inhibition of both the partially restored pressor response to epinephrine, and the pressor responses to norepinephrine. It is concluded that: 1) phenoxybenzamine completely blocks alpha 1, but not alpha 2 vascular receptors; 2) the pressor effect of norepinephrine in phenoxybenzamine-treated animals, and the partially restored pressor effect of epinephrine in phenoxybenzamine-propranolol-treated animals, are both mediated by alpha 2 vascular receptors which are resistant to blockade by phenoxybenzamine.", 
    "40": "The hippocampus is well suited for studies of the interrelationships of various neurotransmitter systems in the CNS by reason of its simple laminated organization, defined connections, and variety of identified neurotransmitters. We have studied the biochemical and pharmacological properties of five radiolabeled ligand binding sites in a membrane fraction prepared from rat hippocampal formation. These binding sites are thought to identify recognition sites for neurotransmitter receptors. The rank order of ligand binding sites is [3H]muscimol > [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate > [3H]dihydroergocryptine > [3H]dihydroalprenolol > 125I-labeled alpha-bungarotoxin. All ligands have a single, saturable, high-affinity binding site. Pharmacological characterization of the ligand binding sites indicates properties consistent with the identification of these sites as neurotransmitter receptors.", 
    "41": "The positive inotropic effects of the alpha-adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine were compared in isolated rabbit papillary muscles. Phenylephrine in the presence of 10(-7)M propranolol produced a greater response than methoxamine. Antagonism by phentolamine was competitive for phenylephrine and apparently, noncompetitive for methoxamine. Based upon observed maximum following frequencies, 10(-4)M methoxamine had a greater cardiac depressant effect than 10(-4) phenylephrine. It was suggested that phenylephrine with a beta-adrenergic antagonist possessed advantages over methoxamine as an agonist for studying cardiac alpha-adrenergic receptors in rabbit papillary muscles.", 
    "42": "We have previously reported that in hypothyroid turkeys the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in intact erythrocytes is reduced by approximately 50% without any changes in the affinity of the receptor for the agonist, isoproterenol. In view of the physiological action of the catecholamines to stimulate bidirectional ion fluxes in these cells, we have now examined the possibility that the decrease in beta receptor number might be associated with concomitant changes in catecholamine-dependent potassium ion transport. Hypothyroid turkey erythrocytes display decreased sensitivity to isoproterenol-stimulated potassium influx. Half-maximal stimulation of potassium influx occurs at 9.2+/-1.7 nM in hypothyroid cells as opposed to only 3.8+/-0.4 nM in normal cells (P < 0.005). A maximal stimulatory concentration of isoproterenol (100 nM) leads to the same increment in ion flux in erythrocytes from hypothyroid and normal turkeys. Analysis of the quantitative relationship between isoproterenol concentration, receptor occupancy, and associated effects upon potassium influx shows that at low levels of isoproterenol, where occupancy is linear with agonist concentration, occupation of a given number of beta receptors leads to a stimulation of potassium transport that is identical in erythrocytes from normal and hypothyroid turkeys. Thus, decreased sensitivity to catecholamine-stimulated potassium transport in hypothyroidism can be attributed to the decrease in receptor number and the resulting two- to threefold higher isoproterenol concentration required for occupancy of the same number of beta receptors. Once a single receptor is occupied, however, the more distal components of the sequence of events mediating the physiological response to beta-adrenergic agonists in the hypothyroid cell function as they do under normal circumstances. It would appear, therefore, that the decrease in sensitivity to isoproterenol-dependent ion flux in the hypothyroid turkey erythrocyte can be accounted for solely by the decrease in receptor number. These changes are shown to occur in the absence of any modifications in the number of Na(+)-K(+) ATPase effector units per cell.", 
    "43": "beta-Adrenergic agonists stimulate surfactant release and decrease fluid in lung alveoli of fetuses. Both effects are most evident toward the end of gestation. We used [3H] dihydroalprenolol (DHA) to investigate the development of pulmonary beta-adrenergic receptors in rabbit fetuses and to study the effect of glucocorticoid treatment on the beta-receptor number. In the lung particulate preparation, DHA binding was rapid, reversible, stereoselective, and of high affinity. The order of potency for adrenergic agonists in competing for DHA binding was isoproterenol > epinephrine = norepinephrine, which is typical of interactions at a beta 1-adrenergic receptor. Using DHA, we demonstrated that the concentration of pulmonary beta-receptors increased significantly between 28 and 31 days of gestation; however, there was no change in the dissociation constant during gestation. After injecting betamethasone (0.17 mg/kg, 24 hours) into rabbits at 25 days of pregnancy, we found that the concentration of pulmonary beta-receptors increased from 44.2 +/- 6.6 fmol/mg protein in untreated fetuses to 77.9 +/- 5.6 fmol/mg protein in treated fetuses. However, this treatment did not affect the DHA binding sites in the fetal rabbit heart. Maternal treatment with the T3 analogue 3,5-dimethyl-3'-isopropyl-L-thyronine (0.5-1 mg/kg) at a dosage which increased both surfactant synthesis and release did not alter pulmonary receptor concentration. Our results indicate that the concentration of pulmonary beta-adrenergic receptors increases in the fetus at term and suggest that this increase is stimulated by endogenous glucocorticoid in fetal circulation.", 
    "44": "A follow-up of at least 4 years after withdrawal of a medical treatment of 77 patients with Graves' disease is presented. The treatment consisted in Carbimazole (15-30 mg/d), LT3 (75 ug/d), Propranolol (30-60 mg/d), Hydroxyzine (75 mg/d). A normal thyroid suppressibility (20 mm 99m Tc uptake test) is obtained in patients without goiter faster than in those with goiter. A normal early uptake at the sixth month therapy is a good index for cure. Despite this result the authors recommend a treatment of 12 to 18 months duration because of the probable immunodepressive effect of the antithyroid drugs.", 
    "45": "The present study was undertaken in order to examine the possible involvement of protein phosphorylation during beta-adrenergic stimulation in the rat parotid gland. Isolated parotid gland slices were stimulated by either isoproterenol or dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (Bt2cAMP) in the presence or absence of propranolol. Amylase output was measured as a parameter for the degree of stimulation of secretion. Stimulation of secretion by either isoproterenol or Bt2AMP was associated with phosphorylation of three protein bands as revealed by sodium dodecylsulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The apparent molecular weights of the three proteins were 35,100 (protein I), 25,700 (protein II) and 20,400 (protein III). After cell fractionation by differential and gradient centrifugation, protein I was enriched in a light membrane fraction most likely corresponding to the plasma membrane as revealed by marker enzyme analysis. Proteins II and III were recovered in a denser fraction containing mainly mitochondria and rough microsomes. The effect of isoproterenol but not that of Bt2cAMP on phosphorylation of all three protein bands was completely abolished by propranolol. The different time course in the stimulation of amylase secretion by isoproterenol and Bt2cAMP respectively was reflected by corresponding differences in the time course of protein phosphorylation.", 
    "46": "The influence of chronic administration of desmethylimipramine (DMI) on the actions of thyroxine (T4) on rat heart was studied. Administration od DMI (10 mg/kg, i.p., twice daily) for 7 days did not alter the cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor density or the affinity for (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) but diminished the activation of myocardial phosphorylase produced by isoproterenol. Chronic injections of T4 (500 microgram/rat) for 5 days caused an increase in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart and potentiated the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol on cardiac phosphorylase alpha activity. When DMI was administered concomitantly with T4, there was no increase in the density of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors and the T4-induced potentiation of the activation of heart phosphorylase by isoproterenol was abolished. However, simultaneous treatment of the rats with DMI and TR4 did not diminish the positive chronotropic effect of T4. It was concluded that DMI, while not affecting the population of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors by itself, prevents the increase in these receptors produced by T4 and obviates the T4-induced potentiation of phosphorylase activation by isoproterenol. That the tachycardia caused by T4 persists in hearts in which DMI has impeded the increase in myocardial beta-receptors suggests that the increase in heart rate is not dependent on cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor density.", 
    "47": "The effects of catecholamines (CAs) on cardiac chronotropism were investigated in the spinal dog. The CAs were administered through the right subclavian artery (i.a.) to reach the cardiac sympathetic ganglia. Without preganglionic stimulation. CAs administered intra-arterially induced a slight negative chronotropic effect, which was reversed to a positive chronotropic effect after neostigmine (200 microgram, i.a.) in many cases. With preganglionic stimulation, intra-arterial injection of norepinephrine (0.5-25 microgram), epinephrine (0.1-10 microgram), or dopamine (0.1-500 microgram) caused dose-dependent bradycardia. The negative chronotropic effect of dopamine was significantly inhibited intra-arterial phentolamine (2 mg), dihydroergotamine (0.4 mg), apomorphine (0.5 mg), haloperidol (0.5 mg), or chlorpromazine (5 mg) but not by propranolol (0.1 mg) or bulbocapnine (1 mg), whereas the same effect of epinephrine was significantly reduced by alpha-blockade but not by propranolol or the dopamine antagonists. These results suggest that CAs exert a negative chronotropic action by inhibiting cardiac ganglionic transmission and that the receptors for dopamine are alpha-adrenergic and dopamine-specific and those for epinephrine are alpha-adrenergic specific.", 
    "48": "Labetalol is an orally active adrenoreceptor-blocking drug which is a competitive antagonist of both alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor sites. Thirty patients with essential hypertension were admitted to the study. The mean of initial systolic and diastolic blood pressures of these patients was 160/101 +/- 3/1 supine and 155/104 +/- 3/1 mm Hg standing, and the mean blood pressures at the end of the 16 week trial was 142/90 +/- 4/2 supine and 131/91 +/- 3/2 mm Hg standing. The average dose of labetalol was 546 mg: eight patients received a dose of 300 mg, seven a dose of 600 mg, six a dose f 900 mg, and two a dose of 1,200 mg. The patients who needed the highest doses of labetalol had an initial lowering of their blood pressures followed by a gradual increase despite the higher doses of labetalol. There was no significant change in the mean peripheral renin activity value. Side effects were reported by 18 of the 30 patients, but only 1 patient withdrew for this reason. Two patients were considered to be treatment failures. Overall, labetalol was found to be an effective antihypertensive agent in 15 patients.", 
    "49": "The effects of intravenous (0.4 mg) and oral pindolol (5 mg, t.i.d.) on exercise tolerance and electrocardiographic ST-segment changes were investigated in 20 patients with documented coronary artery disease (16 males and 4 females; mean age, 56.7 years). A randomized double-blind crossover design was used, and graded submaximal exercise was performed on a bicycle ergometer. Pindolol significantly decreased heart rate at rest, and during and after exercise. The time intervals before the appearance of ST depression, before anginal pain, and before the cessation of work were significantly increased after beta-adrenergic blockade, and work tolerance was enhanced, both indicating that pindolol is an effective antianginal agent. Angina appeared at a lower heart rate after pindolol. Anginal pain and cessation of work were associated with significantly less ST-segment depression after pindolol, suggesting that the relation between ST depression and myocardial ischemia is altered by beta-adrenergic blockade. The appearance and disappearance of ST-segment changes correlated closely with heart rate during placebo and pindolol treatment. Heart rate thus seems to be a major determinant of ST-segment depression during and after exercise in coronary artery disease.", 
    "50": "Plasma catecholamines were measured before and after treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in 17 hypertensive patients. Chronic treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists caused substantial reductions in heart rate and intra-arterial blood pressure recorded continuously during ambulation. Before treatment, a quantitative relationship was observed between plasma norepinephrine and blood pressure and heart rate during a variety of activities; a similar relationship was also observed after chronic treatment five of six patients, suggesting that plasma norepinephrine remains an index of sympathetic activity despite the influence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonism. After treatment, plasma norepinephrine tended to be higher at any level of blood pressure, although not significantly so. Chronic treatment caused no significant change in mean resting plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine. During exercise, plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were significantly elevated above control after acute but not after chronic treatment. These observations do not support the hypothesis that beta-adrenoceptor antagonist drugs lower blood pressure in hypertensive man through a sympatholytic mechanism in he central nervous system or at peripheral presynaptic receptors.", 
    "51": "The pharmacokinetics of metoprolol and propranolol in 6 healthy volunteers were compared after an intravenous dose of 10 mg of each drug. The mean t1/2, beta was 3.6 hr for both drugs, but due to a larger volume of distribution, the total body clearance was significantly higher for metoprolol (1.20 liters/min) than for propranolol (0.81 liters/min). The individual pharmacokinetic data were used to calculate the doses required to increase the amount of each drug in the body to 10 and 20 mg at 90 and 180 min respectively after an initial intravenous dose of 5.0 mg. The effect on exercise heart rate was determined 30 min after each dose. After identical doses, the two drugs had similar beta-blocking effects in terms of reducing exercise-induced tachycardia. These effects increased with the dose administered. The plasma levels of propranolol were twice as high as those of metoprolol for identical degrees of beta-blockade. The slope of the regression line for the relationship between the beta-blocking effect and log plasma concentrations was the same for the two drugs.", 
    "52": "We studied the time course of three electrophysiologic effects of propranolol after intravenous and oral administration and their relationship with plasma levels within the same subjects. Ten patients who had undergone cardiac catheterization for diagnostic purposes received 0.1 mg/kg of propranolol intravenously. Blood was drawn at intervals for 12 hr and heart rate and the effective refractory periods of the atrium (ERPA) and the atrioventricular node (ERPAVN) were determined at the same time. Eight patients continued treatment with propranolol by the oral route for up to 4 days (40 mg every 12 hr). Blood was sampled after each morning dose. Plasma concentrations of propranolol were measured by gas chromatography. Maximal lengthening of ERPA after propranolol (15.1% i.v. and 9.4% oral) was much less marked than that of ERPAVN (23.2% i.v. and 19.4% oral). Heart rate decreased 23.5% (i.v.) and 13.1% (oral). Effects were seen much sooner after intravenous (5-8 min) than after oral administration (86-146 min), but they lasted about twice as long after oral as after intravenous treatment.", 
    "53": "1 Positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to guinea-pig isolated left and right atria respectively to the sympathomimetic amine orciprenaline were recorded. 2 Pretreatment of animals with reserpine for 3 days produced supersensitivity of both the inotropic and chronotropic responses. Lowering the bath temperature from 38 degrees to 30 degrees C produced supersensitivity of untreated atria to the inotropic responses only. 3 Irreversible beta-adrenoreceptor antagonism of orciprenaline by Ro 03-7894 was demonstrated by a persistent depression of the maximum inotropic and chronotropic responses after a prolonged washout from the bath (3 h). 4 The depression of the maximum rate and tension responses by Ro 03-7894 was less in atria from reserpine-pretreated animals. 5 The maxima were also depressed less at the lower bath temperature of 30 degrees C. However, when atria were cooled during the incubation with Ro 30-7894, the maxima were still depressed to the 38 degrees C level. 6 That these results suggest either a receptor proliferation or change in efficacy as possible mechanisms for reserpine- and hypothermia-induced supersensitivity is discussed.", 
    "54": "The reversal of reserpine-induced hypothermia in mice be three beta-adrenoceptor agonists, terbutaline, salbutamol and clenbuterol, was examined. Terbutaline, 5 and 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally, caused a slight reversal of the hypothermia. Salbutamol, 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally, produced a pronounced and 1 mg/kg a slight reversal. Clenbuterol was very potent in reversing the hypothermic effect of reserpine with significant effect at 0.02 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Propranolol, 2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally, and the selective beta 2-receptor antagonist IPS 339, 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally, almost completely antagonized the effect of clenbuterol, 1 mg/kg intraperitoneally. The beta-receptor antagonist metoprolol at 5 and 25 mg/kg intraperitoneally only partially antagonized the effect of clenbuterol. Since clenbuterol is much more lipophilic than salbutamol and terbutaline, it is suggested that the reserpine reversal produced by clenbuterol is at least partially of central origin and possibly mediated by stimulation of noradrenergic beta 2-receptors.", 
    "55": "H1-blocking antihistamines were administered topically to rabbits to determine their effects on intraocular pressure. Chlorcyclizine which is in the piperazine class of H1-inhibitors was found to elevate intraocular pressure. This effect was prevented by the systemic administration of indomethacin and is probably a prostaglandin induced change. Of the other agents tested, antazoline which is in the ethylenediamine class, was the only drug found to lower intraocular pressure. The antazoline-induced lowering of intraocular pressure was associated with no changes in outflow facility, episcleral venous pressure, systemic blood pressure, or ocular blood flow. Tonographic and aqueous humor ascorbate humor ascorbate data suggested a decreased (41% and 33% respectively) rate of aqueous flow as the mechanism for the decrease in intraocular pressure. The systemic administration of the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine prevented the decrease in intraocular pressure but systemically administered blockers of cholinergic (atropine) or beta-adrenergic (propranolol) activity had no effect.", 
    "56": "Studies were made to determine the effect of various contraction-inhibitors against spontaneous uterine contraction in rats during late pregnancy. 1) The duration and rate of inhibitory activity differed from inhibitor to inhibitor, showing dose-response relationship. As a result of this investigation of the changes in the intensity and frequency for 17 inhibitors, Ca-blocker, beta 2-stimulants and dibutyryl c-AMP had the strongest effects, PG-antagonist, and the anti-inflammatory drugs such as aminophylline were much weaker in their inhibitory activity. 2) When the progress of uterine inhibition was investigated on the basis of quantitative changes of PG and c-AMP in bath medium, it was found that both PGE1 and PGF2 alpha were significantly reduced after administration of terbutaline and indomethacin, c-AMP decreased significantly after administration of PGE1 analogue, oxytocin and PGF2 alpha. The c-AMP levels increased significantly after administration of terbutaline and verapamil. These were no significant changes in c-AMP levels when indomethacin and aminophylline were used. During the administration of the uterine inhibitors, c-AMP increased significantly both in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, c-AMP may be regarded as an important parameter indicating the degree of inhibition of contraction.", 
    "57": "The metabolic changes in blood, red (m. soleus) and white (m. vastus lateralis) skeletal muscle fibres were investigated after short-term (3 min) infusion of adrenaline with or without prior treatment with propranolol or metoprolol. The adrenaline-induced increase in plasma lactate levels was totally prevented by prior treatment with metoprolol or propranolol, whilst the beta-blockers had no effect on blood glucose levels. Similar effects on lactate levels were found in the m. soleus, while metoprolol was less effective than propranolol in m. vastus lateralis. Adrenaline decreased the level of muscle creatinine phosphate and ADP, causing the equilibrium of the creatinine kinase reaction to change in the direction of ATP synthesis, although the level of ATP usually decreased. This effect was more pronounced in m. vastus lateralis compared with m. soleus. The [ATP]/[ADP] [Pi]-ratio tended to increase during infusion of adrenaline. This effect was counteracted by metroprolol but not by propranolol. The effects on the \"phosphate potential\" ([ATP]/[ADP] [Pi]) and the equilibrium within the creatine kinase were more pronounced in m. vastus lateralis than in m. soleus. The results demonstrate the possible role of receptors other than beta-receptors, i.e. alpha-receptors, in mediating changes in plasma glucose levels, while plasma lactate levels are regulated by the beta-adrenergic system. The role of beta-receptors in mediating changes in muscle lactate levels may differ in m. soleus and m. vastus lateralis, with a relative predominance of beta 2-receptors in m. vastus lateralis. Quantitative and qualitative differences in the adrenergic control of the energy state in the two types of muscle fibre were obvious, although it was not possible to distinguish clearly between the relative importance of alpha, beta 1 and beta 2-receptors.", 
    "58": "Timolol has been shown to be at least as effective as pilocarpine and epinephrine in the therapy of open angle glaucoma. To date there appear to have been few serious side effects from timolol when it has been used in patients without cardiac or pulmonary disease. The decision whether and when to treat a patient with elevated intraocular pressure depends upon a weighing of risk of glaucoma damage versus the side effects of the drugs used in therapy. The use of the beta blocking agents, particularly timolol, in the therapy of ocular hypertension is considered. Reports on the efficacy and safety of timolol are cited, and the author's reevaluation of their own series of patients treated with timolol for 17-36 months is discussed.", 
    "59": "Hypertensive patients are particularly endangered by disproportionately large increases in blood pressure during daily physical activity. It is of clinical importance to know how antihypertensive drugs influence these pressure changes and therefore the blood pressure lowering effect of the fixed combination of a beta-receptor antagonist and diuretics on exercise-induced blood pressure increases during and after standardized ergometric work was investigated in 32 outpatients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. This combination was shown to be an effective therapeutic regimen lowering blood pressure into the normotensive range at rest and particularly during and after ergometry. Side effects were minimal. In two-thirds of the patients a sufficient blood pressure reduction under all conditions could be achieved by a single morning dose of one tablet (10 mg timolol, 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide, and 2.5 mg amiloridehydrochloride).", 
    "60": "Syntheses are reported for three metabolites (2-4) of timolol (1) formed by oxidative metabolism of the morpholine ring. GLC-MS comparisons are presented which establish that the two metabolites whose structures were previously in question are identical with their synthetic counterparts 2 and 3. In 2, metabolic oxidation of the 4-morpholinyl group of 1 had occurred at the carbon next to oxygen to give the 2-hydroxy-4-morpholinyl moiety, whereas in 3, the morpholine of 1 has been oxidized one step further and then ring opened to produce the N-(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine substituent. Biological testing of synthetic samples of the three major metabolites from human urine (3, 4, and 6) indicated that only 4, in which the morpholine moiety has been degraded to a 2-hydroxyethylamino group, had significant beta-adrenergic blocking activity (one-seventh that of timolol in anesthetized dogs).", 
    "61": "The intracarotidal injection of some bet-adrenergic blocking agents (dl-acebutolol, dl-, l-, d-alprenolol, dl-bunitrolol, dl-buthoxamine, dl-, l-, d-INPEA, dl-Ko 592, dl-metoprolol, dl-oxprenolol, dl-propranolol, dl-tolamolol) in anesthetized and bivagotomized dogs reduced the arterial blood pressure and the baro- and chemoreceptor activity. These effects seem to be mediated by an interaction with central nervous, cardiovascular and respiratory structures dependent on the carotid arteries and by a direct interference of these drugs with the carotid sinus baro- and chemoreceptor structures. Moreover, these effects were not a result of the beta-adrenolytic properties of the drugs.", 
    "62": "The pathogenesis of damage to the heart muscle caused by exposure to the effect of cobalt compounds is demonstrated. Agents with various mechanisms of action were tested in the experiment. The most effective pharmacological agents (beta-adrenergic blocking agents, anabolic steroids) are recommended for testing in the clinic. A positive effect was registered in the treatment of cobalt cardiomyopathy in the clinic. The mechanisms of the favourable effect of beta-adrenergic blocking agents and anabolic steroids are discussed.", 
    "63": "The authors examined 40 patients with the hyperkinetic syndrome (HS) who underwent thorough clinical and instrumental examination including ECG, PCG, bicycle ergometry, hyperventilation and orthostatic tests, and determination of the central hemodynamic indices by echocardiography and the rate heart indices in dopplercardiography. The great diagnostic possibilities of doppler-cardiography are demonstrated. The diagnostic criteria of HS are suggested and general recommendations for treatment are given.", 
    "64": "The effects of acebutolol (13-134 microM), pindolol (10-50 microM), oxprenolol (16-66 microM) and (+) and (-)-K\u00f6592 (39-193 microM) on action potentials were investigated in isolated guinea-pig papillary muscles. All the drugs reduced Vmax at 1 Hz, dose-dependently. The reduction was less prominent with prolongation of the interstimulus interval until there was virtually no reduction. The time course of recovery of Vmax during diastole was studied by assessing Vmax in premature responses at 0.1 Hz or in responses after interrupting driving stimuli at 1 Hz. Time constants of recovery thus estimated were 12 to 14 sec for acebutolol and pindolol, 3 to 6 sec for oxprenolol and 0.7 to 1 sec for (-)-K\u00f6592. The reduction of Vmax was rate dependent for all the drugs, and at 5 Hz, the order of potency was oxprenolol > pindolol > acebutolol congruent to (-)- and (+)-K\u00f6592. The most potent was alprenolol (3.5-17.5 microM), which we have already studied in detail. At 1 Hz or lower, the action potential duration was shortened by application of all the compounds mentioned except acebutolol, but tended to be longer than in control, at higher rates for all the drugs. We conclude that molecular bulkiness and dimension may be associated with the time constant of recovery, whereas the potency at high driving rates may be correlated roughly linearly with the lipid solubility of the agents.", 
    "65": "The effects of catecholamines and other sympathomimetic amines with alpha adrenergic activity on vasoconstriction were studied. Short ring segments were prepared from five rabbit blood vessels including the mesoduodenal, brachial, central ear and pulmonary lobar arteries and the saphenous vein. Constriction was elicited by electrical field stimulation of adrenergic neurons. This response was markedly potentiated in the mesenteric preparation by low concentrations of norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, methoxamine, naphazoline and oxymetazoline. The potentiation occurred with amine concentrations not sufficient to elevate the spontaneous transmitter release or basal smooth muscle tone. Propranolol, cocaine and metanephrine did not prevent the potentiation. Isoproterenol and dopamine potentiated the response only in high concentrations and tyrosine was without an effect. An unidentified extraneuronal action was probably responsible for the potentiation. The mesenteric artery was unique for its marked potentiation as the brachial artery was potentiated only slightly and the other three vessels were inhibited by the alpha adrenergic agents in the constrictor response to stimulation.", 
    "66": "The pharmacokinetics of propranolol in 16 hypertensive patients was compared after the first oral dose of 80 mg and during chronic treatment with 80 mg bd. The degree of beta-adrenergic blockade was estimated by the reduction in maximal exercise heart rate. No significant change in plasma half-life occurred and there was no correlation between the mean steady-state propranolol concentration and beta-adrenergic blockade or antihypertensive effect. A linear relationship was observed between the decrease in blood pressure and the reduction in heart rate during maximal exercise. Therefore, the antihypertensive effect of propranolol can be explained by it peripheral beta-adrenergic blocking properties."
