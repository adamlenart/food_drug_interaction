    "0": "The effects of two beta-blockers, one non-selective, propranolol, the other beta 1 selective, metoprolol, were studied in 8 asthmatic patients. Practolol and a placebo were used as reference products. Heart rate, blood pressure, MEV, and muscle tremor were measured at rest and after isoprenaline infusions at different concentrations. In patients receiving placebo, isoprenaline caused an increase in heart rate, MEV, systolic BP, and muscle tremor, and a reduction in diastolic BP. After propranolol, the effects of isoprenaline on heart rate, MEV, and muscle tremor were almost completely blocked, and modifications in systolic and diastolic BP were only slightly affected. Metoprolol and practolol did not inhibit the increase in MEV induced by isoprenaline, but they reduced the increase noted in the heart rate. These results demonstrate the beta 1 selectivity of these two beta-blockers. Contrary to propranolol, metoprolol and practolol did not block the increased muscle tremor provoked by isoprenaline: muscle tremor must be dependent on beta 2-receptor activity. As the effect of isoprenaline on the MEV was not inhibited by beta 1-selective beta-blockers, these can be prescribed for asthmatic patients in association with beta 2 stimulants.", 
    "1": "We assessed the efficacy of the combination of propranolol and potassium iodide in the preparation of patients with Graves' disease for thyroid surgery. Potassium iodide was given orally in a dose of 60 mg three times a day for 10 days before operation in 10 patients who were already receiving propranolol. In contrast to previous experience with either drug used singly, the combined regimen caused a significant fall in mean serum total thyroxine and triiodothyronine to levels in the euthyroid range before operation (P less than 0.001). There was also a significant fall (P less than 0.05) before operation and transient rise after operation in serum reverse triiodothyronine. These preliminary results suggest that the combination of potassium iodide and propranolol may prove to be the optimum preoperative preparation for patients with Graves' disease.", 
    "2": "The single-dose response to local administration of atenolol 4% is compared in normal eyes and 3 groups of eyes with glaucoma simplex. The reduction in intraocular pressure is seen to be greater in eyes with glaucoma than in normal eyes. The usefulness of atenolol 4%, whether or not combined with other local therapy, seems to be limited by tachyphylaxis.", 
    "3": "26 eyes of 14 patients--8 with primary open angle glaucoma, 6 glaucoma suspects--were treated for at least 6 months with either twice daily timolol 0.25% in both eyes or twice daily timolol 0.50% in one eye. None of the patients received concomitant local or oral drugs. Special attention was paid to tachyphylaxis and to blood pressure and pulse rate. We could detect a slight although not significant tendency to tachyphylaxis (1-2 mm Hg) after 1 week of timolol treatment. It takes at least 1-2 weeks to reach the initial I.O.P. level after withdrawal of timolol therapy. Blood pressure did not change significantly. The pulse rate showed a slight although not significant tendency to decrease (a few beats/minute), but we detected a reflex tachycardia (10 beats/minute) after withdrawal of timolol therapy which was very significant. This rebound phenomenon has not been referred to in the literature. It seems reasonable to conclude that one should take care in treating glaucoma patients with concomitant arrhythmias with timolol eye drops.", 
    "4": "This study examines the effect of different substrates on mechanical performance of excised papillary muscles from rhesus monkeys which had been divided into a control group and an experimental group fed a high fat diet for 5 months prior to sacrifice. The results show that performance is affected by availabel substrate for both groups. The performance of the experimental group was depressed relative to control with the short chain fatty acid, butyrate (C4), producing a monotonically decreasing force-frequency response. Relative to the other mammals, isolated rhesus papillary muscles exhibited a protracted treppe which was sensitive to beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol.", 
    "5": "A comparison was made between the ocular penetration of topically applied 14C-atenolol, 14C-timolol, 14C-propranolol and 3H-metoprolol by means of liquid scintillation counting. Only one eye was treated, the fellow eye served as a control. Blood plasma levels were measured as well. We could detect a relationship between the ocular penetration and the degree of lipophilicity of the drugs used, as was to be expected. Drugs with a higher degree of lipophilicity penetrated more readily into the eye, whereas they also achieved higher blood plasma levels. Relatively high concentrations of atenolol were found in the nicitating membrane, thus reflecting its poor ocular penetration. The concentrations detected in the untreated eye were low and probably cannot explain the marked reduction in intraocular pressure observed after unilateral instillation of active beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, as for instance timolol. Our findings suggest that the ocular penetration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on topical application only plays a minor part in their ocular hypotensive effect.", 
    "6": "In cats anesthetized with chloralose-pentobarbital and artificially ventilated, electrical stimulation of the caudal end of the cut cervical vagus nerve has a biphasic effect on the bronchoconstriction induced by an intravenous infusion of serotonin. The response consists of a brief augmentation of bronchoconstriction followed by relatively prolonged bronchodilation. After muscarinic receptor blockade with atropine, vagal stimulation causes only bronchodilation. Vagally mediated bronchodilation is not affected by beta adrenergic blockade with propranolol, alpha adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine, or adrenergic neuronal blockade with guanethidine, but is abolished by autonomic ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium. These findings support the conclusion that a nonadrenergic inhibitory nervous system is present in the pulmonary airways of the cat and that the system is supplied by preganglionic fibers in the cervical vagus nerves.", 
    "7": "The use of beta blocking drugs as a preparation to the sub-total thyroidectomy in Graves's disease allows to shorten the pre-operation time. However, besides the observance of classical contraindications, it requires that patient who remain hyperthyroid are closely looked after. Within these limits, it seems to be quite useful for patients who need to quickly come back to euthyroid status.", 
    "8": "Pineal glands were prelabeled in organ culture with [14C]taurine, and then treated with biogenic amines. The rate of release of [14C]taurine was rapidly elevated by low concentrations of norepinephrine, apparently acting through a beta-adrenergic mechanism. The release was probably not due to a nonspecific change in membrane permeability, as a comparable release was not seen with [14C]glycine and [14C]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. These findings suggest that the release of taurine may be related to or a reflection of the early events in adrenergic activation of the pineal gland, such as hyperpolarization of pinealocytes. The released taurine might also have an extracellular role as it has been recently shown that extracellular taurine can interact with pineal beta-adrenergic receptors to stimulate melatonin production. Thus, the released taurine could possibly act as an extracellular feedback messenger.", 
    "9": "Bilateral lesion of the ascending noradrenergic fibers in the dorsal bundle of adult Wistar rats with 4 micrograms 6-hydroxydopamine caused extensive depletion of norepinephrine in all forebrain areas, but led to a 54% increase in norepinephrine levels in the cerebellum. beta-Adrenergic receptor binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol was significantly increased in all forebrain areas depleted of norepinephrine except hypothalamus. The increase in [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding was due to 62% and 34% increases in the number of beta-receptor sites in the frontal cerebral cortex and hippocampus respectively. Binding of [3H]WB-4101 to alpha 1-adrenergic receptors after dorsal bundle lesion was augmented generally to a lesser extent than beta-receptor binding, with significantly increased numbers of sites only in the frontal cortex (74%), thalamus (20%) and septum. Both alpha 1- and beta-receptor binding sites were reduced in number by 25-28% in the cerebellum of dorsal bundle-lesioned rats, whereas intraventricular administration of 6-hydroxydopamine to adult rats, which depletes norepinephrine in the cerebellum by 96%, increased cerebellar alpha 1- and beta-receptor binding by 33-40%. Binding of [3H]clonidine to forebrain alpha 2-adrenergic receptors was significantly elevated in the frontal cortex, but reduced in the amygdala and septum, after dorsal bundle lesion.", 
    "10": "An open study was undertaken in 31 patients with moderate to severe hypertension to compare labetalol (a competitive antagonist of both alpha-adrenoreceptors and beta-adrenoreceptors) alone and in combination with a thiazide diuretic, with a combination of thiazide, beta-adrenergic blocking agent and the alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker prazosin. After introduction of labetalol, six patients withdrew because of intolerable side effects. All 25 remaining patients were controlled on diuretic and labetalol. On labetalol alone, 14 patients were controlled, two withdrew because of side effects and nine had inadequate blood pressure control. Labetalol is an effective antihypertensive agent, but side effects are common and it has few advantages over drugs presently available.", 
    "11": "Lack of awareness of hypoglycaemia leading to loss of consciousness is a serious problem in some insulin-treated diabetics, and beta-blocking drugs may increase this hazard. A prospective study was therefore carried out over eight months to determine the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes in 50 insulin-treated diabetics taking beta-blockers, as compared with 100 diabetic controls matched for age, sex, and duration of diabetes. The incidence of loss of consciousness from hypoglycaemia was the same in both groups and was unrelated to the dose of beta-blocking drug used. Five patients taking beta-blockers and 10 controls had episodes of unconsciousness, but four of these patients taking beta-blockers had had similar episodes in the two years preceding treatment. It is concluded that beta-blocking drugs are generally safe in insulin-treated diabetics and that hypoglycaemic unconsciousness resulting from their use is rare.", 
    "12": "When small doses of pindolol and propranolol (0.1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively) were administered intraperitoneally to conscious normotensive Kyoto Wistar rats, acute hypotension occurred. However, these hypotensive effects diminished when the doses were increased to 5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively. Unilateral adrenalectomy had no effect on these hypotensive effects but they were suppressed by bilateral adrenalectomy. Subsequently, marked and lasting hypotensive effects (20-35 mm Hg) were observed. In urethane-anaesthetized rats, intravenous infusions of the blocking agents produced a rise in blood pressure and an increase in the content of epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine in adrenal venous blood. These hypertensive actions were not seen in adrenalectomized rats. When rats were given 6-hydroxydopamine (2 micrograms/microliters) bilaterally at the C4 level of the spinal cord 7 days before or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (2 micrograms/microliters, after desmethylimipramine, 25 mg/kg i.p.), the catecholamine content of adrenal venous blood and the catecholamine releasing actions of these blocking agents decreased, but were not completely abolished. These results suggest that the lack of hypotensive effects with higher doses of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents may have been due partly to the direct release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and partly to central noradrenergic or serotonergic nerve action.", 
    "13": "The pharmacokinetics and relative systemic availability or oral propranolol were studied in three healthy volunteers following administration of 10, 40, and 80 mg of propranolol hydrochloride. Plasma concentrations of propranolol were determined using a sensitive and specific fluorometric high pressure liquid chromatographic technique. In the dosage range studied, the amount of propranolol reaching the systemic circulation increased with dose, while half-lives remained unchanged. The apparent 'threshold dose' for propranolol was much smaller than previously reported, and its contribution to the observed dose-dependent availability is doubtful. Apparent intrinsic clearance values were shown to decrease with increase in dose, with a true maximal intrinsic clearance of 5.4 l kg-1 h-1. These data suggest the saturation of a low capacity enzyme system in the liver and are consistent with theoretical characteristics of a drug that is extensively metabolized during its first pass through the liver.", 
    "14": "Chronic treatment with oxprenolol or propranolol in active hypertensive patients was associated with elevation of serum growth hormone (GH). Propranolol, 80 mg orally, caused a marked rise in GH in 3 of 4 acromegalic patients.", 
    "15": "Eighteen volunteers with a mean age of 63.3 years, who were asymptomatic and without significant heart disease, were investigated with standard electrophysiological tests, performed before and after inhibition of autonomous neural tone with propranolol (0.1 mg . kg-1) and atropine (0.02 mg . kg-1). In addition heart rate responses to maximal exercise, carotid sinus pressure and bolus injection of isoprenaline (0.01 microgram . kg-1) were studied to evaluate the relation between different functional qualities of the cardiac conduction system. Autonomous tone inhibition (ATI) caused significant reductions in the mean PP-interval, sinus code recovery time (SNRT) and corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT). Furthermore, the precision of CSNRT determinations increased after ATI. In contrast, the AV-node effective refractory period and conduction time (AH-interval) did not change after ATI. A significant correlation existed between CSNRT and heart rate after ATI, both variables reflecting sinus node automaticity, while no covariation was found between CSNRT and the response to isoprenaline stimulation. AV-node refractoriness and conduction time showed covariation after, but not before, autonomous inhibition. As elderly asymptomatic non-patients were examined the use of the presented group characteristics as reference values for diagnostic investigations is suggested. For example pre-drug CSNRT above 545 ms (mean + 2 SD) or above 505 ms after ATI, indicates impaired sinus node automaticity.", 
    "16": "Juvenile Xanthogranuloma of the iris is a rare but benign disease of infants. The iris is swollen and of yellowish color, there are exsudates in the anterior chamber and occasionally spontaneous hyphema may occur. Secondary glaucoma with edema of the corneal epithelium and hydrophthalmus are often seen. Treatment consists in topical application of steroids, sometimes combined with pressure-lowering medication.", 
    "17": "In a double-blind study, a significant blockade of the beta-adrenergic system was verified on 20 healthy volunteers after instillation of 4 drops of Timolol maleate 0.5% daily. The systemic blocking effect is obvious after stimulation of the sympathetic system by physical activity. Under these conditions the blood pressure and the heart rate of volunteers treated with Timolol rise less than those of volunteers given a placebo. A theoretical explanation is given and possible clinical implications are discussed.", 
    "18": "After intracapsular lens extraction with alpha-chymotrypsin three groups of 14 patients were formed. The first group was given Timolol 0.25% 2 x 1 drops, the second acetazolamide in sustained release form 1 x 500 mg and the third served as control. In all three groups the postoperatively elevated pressure diminished significantly in the first five postoperative days. The pressure diminution on the fourth and fifth postoperative day was accelerated by Timolol but not by acetazolamide.", 
    "19": "The effect of propranolol on ST depression in the praecordial 16 lead electrocardiogram was observed in 52 patients before and after treatment, both at rest and after exercise. In a further 20 patients exercise tests repeated on separate days two months apart showed that the technique gave reproducible results. A variable relation between symptomatic relief and praecordial exercise-induced ST segment depression was noted. Use of a single fixed-position chest lead (V5) was shown to be less accurate. The relief of symptoms alone is probably an inadequate guide to the success of medical treatment, which should control not only angina but also the manifestations of ischaemia on the praecordial electrocardiogram.", 
    "20": "A radioimmunoassay for chicken calcitonin (CT) was used to study changes in the normal levels of CT in the circulation of chick embryos during incubation and in hatched chicks. The hormone was detectable in embryos whenever the plasma concentration of calcium was greater than 2.5 mmol/l. The level of CT at the time of 'pipping' was exceptionally high but when pipping was artificially advanced or retarded the peak of CT was dissociated from the physiological event of pipping. When embryos were injected with calcium, CT secretion was stimulated but the maximum level induced was substantially less than the normal peak level observed at pipping although an extreme degree of hypercalcaemia developed. When CT was removed from the embryonic circulation by injecting anti-CT plasma, a mild but statistically significant hypercalcaemia developed and in another experiment exogenous CT significantly decreased an artificially induced hypercalcaemia. The beta-antagonist, propranolol, decreased and the beta-agonist, isoprenaline, increased concentrations of CT in the circulation. We suggest that the role of CT in the chick embryo may be to restrict the hypercalcaemia resulting from the large movement of calcium from the eggshell to the developing embryo and its yolk-sac and that one of the natural stimuli for the release of CT in the late stages of incubation could be beta-adrenergic.", 
    "21": "Tonometry in 9 eyes (7 patients) provides some evidence that timolol eye drops are useful in improving control of pressure in eyes operated for closed-angle glaucoma. In cases 1 and 2 (Figs, 1 and 2) this beta 1 and 2 blocker reduced pressure consistently. Case 3 (Fig. 3) showed that timolol 0.5% twice daily was as effective as pilocarpine 2% or 4% with adrenaline 1%. The effect of timolol 0.5% in case 4 (Fig. 4) and case 6 (Fig. 6) was additive to pilocarpine and adrenaline; in case 5 (Fig. 5) it probably improved the effect of adrenaline, but in cases 4 and 5 there may have been some loss of effect with time. Case 7 (Fig. 7) showed a good effect of timolol, reversed on withdrawal, but pressure fell again in spite of continued withholding of timolol. Timolol will be especially valuable in the control of pressure if an operation involving iridectomy has not been completely successful in open-angle glaucoma or more especially in closed-angle glaucoma because it has no effect on the pupil. Miotics will tend to produce posterior pupillary synechiae because aqueous humour will go through the iridectomy, not under the edge of the pupil. The danger will be greater in eyes with closed-angle glaucoma because the pupil is closely applied to the anterior lens surface, which will also tend to produce irritative iridocyclitis.", 
    "22": "The adrenergic aspects of the mechanism(s) of the vasodilating action of phenoxybenzamine and massive doses of hydrocortisone were studied in anesthetized dogs subjected to controlled hemorrhagic shock. During the predrug hypotension period with decreased cardiac output and heart rate, the plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline levels were both increased. Phenoxybenzamine injected alone augmented the cardiac output and heart rate and reduced the plasma adrenaline without changing the plasma noradrenaline concentration. However, if the adrenergic alpha-receptor blocker was administered in combination with massive doses of hydrocortisone, the degree of vasodilation increased further with a concomitant increase in the concentrations of the two plasma catecholamines. Thus there seems to be no clear-cut relationship between hemodynamic changes and plasma catecholamines. The present findings illustrate the extreme complexity of plasma catecholamine kinetics during hypovolemic shock.", 
    "23": "Effects of H2-receptor antagonism on the response to histamine was studied in the guinea pig in vivo and in vitro. The H2-receptor antagonist, metiamide (100 micro M), resulted in an enhanced histamine response in eight of eight parenchymal strips and in four of eight tracheal spirals. On the average the parenchymal strips were 20-fold more sensitive to histamine (P less than 0.001), whereas the tracheal spirals demonstrated an insignificant, 20%, increase in sensitivity after metiamide treatment. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that there are inhibitory H2-receptors in guinea pig airways and they predominate in the periphery. When we determined the effects of H2-antagonism on the histamine response in vivo we found that the histamine response was enhanced only in animals that had been treated with the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol. In these animals there was a mean 2.2-fold increase in histamine sensitivity. These results suggest that although there are inhibitory H2-receptors in the guinea pig lung, their role in modulating the in vivo response is much less than beta-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "24": "1 Inferior cardiac nerve activity in 9 cats was in inverse relationship to the pressure maintained in the systemically isolated and perfused carotid sinus. 2 Perfusion with propranolol produced no change in this relationship at a concentration of 5.0 microgram/ml, but abolished it at 50.0 microgram/ml. 3 The results suggest that concentrations of propranolol which have been reported to enhance the sensitivity of the carotid sinus to pressure do not enhance one neurophysiological component of the reflex depressor response.", 
    "25": "1 The roles of the hepatic blood flow and the drug oxidizing enzyme system in eliminating oral propranolol and sotalol were studied in twelve subjects with biopsy proven liver parenchymal disease. 2 The apparent plasma clearance of propranolol was closely related both to the in vivo (antipyrine test) and in vitro (cytochrome P-450) indices of the activity of the hepatic mixed function oxidase system. 3 Propranolol clearance had also a clear relationship to the estimated liver blood flow. Altered flow was, however, suggested to be a minor factor when compared with changes in the enzyme system. 4 The elimination rate of sotalol had no correlation to the indices of hepatic drug metabolism or to the estimated liver blood flow. 5 It is concluded that both the deteriorated sinusoidal perfusion and the decreased mass of drug metabolizing enzymes may be responsible for the impaired elimination of oral propranolol in subjects with parenchymal liver disease.", 
    "26": "1 Acebutolol or diacetolol were added to fresh human plasma in varying concentrations and their extent of binding at 25 degrees C measureed by an equilibrium dialysis technique. 2 The extent of binding for both compounds was shown to be very low, being 11-19% for acebutolol and 6-9% for diacetolol. 3 Partition coefficients were measured in an n- octanol/phosphate buffer (0.05M, pH 7.4) solvent system. For a cebutolol, P = 0.62 and for diacetol, P = 0.08. 4 The very low plasma binding is in accord with the hydrophilic partition coefficients of these compounds.", 
    "27": "1 The pharmacokinetics of atenolol, after 200 mg orally, were studied in 18 patients with terminal renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 5 ml/min), of whom twelve were being treated by chronic dialysis. 2 The peak plasma level, 1.59 +/- 0.43 mg/l, was reached in 4.7 +/- 2.1 h. 3 Without dialysis treatment, the apparent plasma half-life of atenolol was greatly increased (73.4 +/- 28.8 /). During dialysis, it dropped to 7.5 +/- 3.7 h but returned to 51.2 +/- 17.3 h after dialysis. The plasma atenolol plot was a rising slope for a few hours after the end of dialysis. 4 Renal clearance of atenolol was very low (4.6 +/- 1.5 ml/min). 5 Plasma clearance during dialysis was 42.6 +/- 21.3 ml/min for a mean blood flow-rate of 236 +/- 25 ml/min through a cuprophane membrane dialyser. 6 These results suggest that dosage should be modified for these patients.", 
    "28": "It was demonstrated in 12 dog experiments with the use of electromagnetic flowmetry and an automatic system of heart function analysis that a single intravenous injection of propranolol in a dose of 0.1 +/- 0.017 mg/kg causes a negative chrono- and inotropic effect and a moderate hypotensive effect in negligible change in the cardiac output. Repeated injections of propranolol in doses of 0.05 mg/kg to a final dose of 0.2 mg/kg at intervals of 5 min (total dose of 0.4 mg/kg) are not attended by increasing inhibition of cardiac function. In systolic and volume load after intravenous injection of propranolol in a dose of up to 0.4 mg/kg it was found that the heart was capable of providing quite adequate hemodynamics. The features of the regulation of cardiac function under these conditions were determined.", 
    "29": "A patient with recurrent, life-threatening water intoxication secondary to compulsive water drinking is described. This patient responded well to nearly 1 g of propranolol daily with a decrease in her drinking behavior, reduced sensation of thirst, and a reduction in her delusional thinking. The rationale for the choice of propranolol with this patient is reviewed.", 
    "30": "Potassium chloride infusion into the left anterior descending coronary artery induces a sequence of events analogous to those occurring during acute transmural ischemia. These include ST elevation, intramural conduction delay, ventricular techyarrhythmias and fibrillation. The influence of antiarrhythmic agents in an intact anesthetized canine model have not previously been tested. We have evaluated the efficacy of lidocaine, procaine amide and practolol in animals during regional hyperkalemia. In the untreated, only 9% survided a 20 minute observation period. All three treatment groups exhibited a reduced incidence of tachycardia and 74% survived the test period. In each treatment group this was associated with a further prolongation of intramural conduction time in the affected wall. This antiarrhythmic efficacy, thought possibly to be due to transformation of unidirectional to bidirectional block, supports the view that modulation of transcellular potassium activity contributes to the control of ischemic arrhythmias.", 
    "31": "An organic mental syndrome developed in a patient soon after he underwent repair of a dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm. The operation was accomplished with cardiopulmonary bypass. Initially, the mental changes were thought to be related to the operation. However, they subsequently were shown to be associated with propranolol. The potential role of propranolol in inducing central nervous system disturbances is emphasized, and the literature on the subject is reviewed.", 
    "32": "The current trend in cardiac rehabilitation is toward the empirical and systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of general and specific components. Clearly, resumption of sexual activity is important to the rehabilitation of patients and their partners. In fact, resumption of sexual behavior may be therapeutic in solidfying the marital relationship during stressful readjustment periods. A satisfying sexual relationship can be valuable as a step towards fostering self-confidence and a feeling of returning health. The cardiac rehabilitation program should strive for a multidisciplinary team approach and to initiate intervention and counseling as early as medically possible during the hospitalization. Counseling programs should always include the exploration of the possible concerns of patients and their partners about resumption of sexual activity. Patients should be advised as to the realities of their fears and provided with guidelines for facilitating a satisfying sexual relationship.", 
    "33": "The effects of propranolol on myocardial perfusion and metabolism during acute myocardial infarction were studied in 18 mongrel dogs. A reversible snare was placed on the left anterior descending coronary artery; regional myocardial perfusion was continuously measured using the short-lived isotope krypton-81m, and myocardial metabolism was assessed using the epicardial electrocardiogram and measurement of release of creatine kinase activity from the affected segment of myocardium. Six dogs with no arterial occlusion acted as \"sham operated\" dogs; six others in which the snare was occluded acted as a control group and a third group of six were given propranolol, 0.5 mg/kg, 30 minutes after coronary occlusion. All variables were recorded before and for 5 hours after coronary occlusion. Dogs treated with propranolol showed a significant improvement in regional myocardial perfusion to the affected segment, decreased loss of electrically active myocardium at the end of each experiment for any given degree of early S-T segment elevation and a delay in the local release of creatine kinase activity compared with that in the control dogs. These results suggest that propranolol exerts a beneficial effect on the progress of ischemic myocardial damage when given shortly after the onset of infarction.", 
    "34": "Minoxidil, a potent peripheral vasodilator, was used concomitantly with other antihypertensive drugs for severe hypertension in three children for 47 to 158 weeks at the dosage of 40 to 50 mg/day. Two patients had three and two courses of minoxidil, respectively. Attempts were made to withdraw minoxidil in all children because of severe hypertrichosis. Minoxidil was withdrawn over periods varying from four to 12 weeks. Rebound hypertension manifesting as hypertensive encephalopathy occurred in all when minoxidil was withdrawn rapidly. The occurrence of rebound hypertension correlated with the total cumulative dose of minoxidil in mg/kg/week given prior to the withdrawal (P less than 0.05) and the rapidity (four to eight weeks) with which minoxidil was withdrawn (P less than 0.05), but not with the total duration of therapy, duration at maximal dosage, or the amount of minoxidil in mg/kg on the day prior to withdrawal. Rebound hypertension also did not occur when minoxidil was withdrawn gradually (12 weeks) or if the patient was receiving a small dose (2.5 to 5 mg/day). Pretreatment with an alpha-blocking agent (prazosin) or the discontinuation of the concomitantly administered beta-blocker (propranolol) prior to the withdrawal seemed to prevent rebound hypertension. We suggest that the dosage of minoxidil should be decreased very gradually.", 
    "35": "A double-blind, randomized, placebo-control study of the effect of epinephrine on the rate of aqueous formation in eyes pretreated with a beta-adenergic blocking drug was carried out in 25 normal subjects with the use of fluorophotometry. All eyes were pretreated with timolol maleate before epinephrine or placebo was given. The effect of timolol maleate alone was to lower intraocular pressure and to reduce the rate of formation of aqueous humor. In the presence of timolol, aqueous formation was decreased further, approximately 7% more, in the epinephrine treated-eye as compared to the placebo-treated eye. This additional decrease in aqueous formation was statistically significant. No statistically significant difference was found in intraocular pressure or in tonographic C value between the epinephrine-treated and the placebo-treated eye. However, intraocular pressure was so low in both eyes that differences in intraocular pressure were not expected and tonographic tracings were difficult to interpret.", 
    "36": "Timolol is a beta adrenergic antagonist in 0.25% or 0.5% eyedrop solution for glaucoma. In a double-blind crossover study in healthy males we measured systemic beta blockade, intraocular pressure, and timolol kinetics after the first and ninth 12-hourly dose of a 0.5% ophthalmic solution. Timolol ophthalmic and placebo were each given as 2 drops to each eye with precautions to prevent the normal loss of drug in tears and overflow (high dose) and as 1 drop to each eye with no special precautions (standard therapeutic dose). Exercise tachycardia, measured at 70 and 255 min after administration of drug, was lower at both levels. Postexercise 1-sec forced expiratory volume (FEV1) was not affected. Intraocular pressure measured at 3 and 8 hr after drug was lower at both dose levels. Timolol was consistently present in urine but was not detectable in most plasma samples. Dynamic effects were not greater after the ninth than after the first dose, and the urinary excretion data provided no evidence of drug cumulation.", 
    "37": "To assess the effects of acebutolol and propranolol on resting left ventricular function, 21 patients with coronary artery disease were studied. A baseline echocardiogram was obtained on day 1, and in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study the patients received 40 mg propranolo every 8 hr for 1 wk, 300 mg acebutolol every 8 hr for 1 wk, and 1 capsule placebo every 8 hr for 1 wk. On days 8, 15, and 22, after an echocardiogram at 7:30 A.M. (i.e., 7.5 hr after the midnight dose), they received double-blind randomized, crossover medications (acebutolol 300 mg, propranolol 40 mg, or placebo). The echocardiogram was repeated at 1.2, and 4 hr after placebo or propranolol and at 2, 3, and 5 hr after acebutolol. The left ventricular end diastolic dimension, left ventricular end systolic dimension, percent systolic shortening of the left ventricular minor axis, and ejection fraction were determined. We found that there was no significant difference between control values for any of the above parameters and those obtained at 1, 2, 4, or 7.5 hr after propranolol or placebo and at 2, 3, 5, or 7.5 hr after acebutolol. We conclude that in the doses used, acebutolol and propranolol do not induce depression of resting left ventricular function in patients with coronary artery disease who have normal or near normal left ventricular function at rest.", 
    "38": "Organ selectivity of beta sympathetic blockade with propranolol was studied in 6 normal men by comparing the cardiovascular and respiration responses during isoproterenol infusions before and after propranolol. Beta sympathetic blockade was achieved with propranolol and was considered present when there was no heart rate (HR) response to isoproterenol during an infusion tenfold greater than that which raised HR 25% during a control period. During blockade there was no change in HR or systolic or diastolic blood pressure during isoproterenol infusions. There was a consistent (p less than 0.05) rise in resting ventilation (+17%), oxygen consumption (+9%), and carbon dioxide production (+15%) with low-dose (raised HR 10% before blockade) isoproterenol infusion during blockade. These respiratory effects of low-dose isoproterenol during cardiovascular blockade were quantitatively similar to that before blockade. With infusion that raised HR 25%, there was a further increase in VE, VO2, and VCO2 before blockade but no further increase during beta blockade. Changes in acid-base status did not explain the increase in VE during blockade. We conclude that there are differences between effectiveness of propranolol blockade of the cardiovascular system and of the respiratory system.", 
    "39": "The kinetics of quinidine and propranolol, administered singly and in combination, were evaluated in 5 healthy subjects. The orally administered doses resulted in plasma concentrations within the therapeutic range. For each drug the average steady-state plasma concentration, maximal plasma concentration, and time of maximum plasma concentration were not altered by the presence of the other drugs. This study shows no kinetic interaction between quinidine and propranolol in normal subjects.", 
    "40": "Many different experimental models for the induction of gastric ulcers have been reported in rats. Most of these experimental designs are often not reproducible and the interpretation of the results obtained is sometimes difficult. In the present study, three different models were found to give reliable and reproducible results, which could be repeated at any time of the year with different experimenters performing the procedure. To date, these methods are in our opinion, the best in designing gastric ulcer experiments and assessing the effect of pharmacological active substances. Two pharmacological active substances were investigated in the present study, pindolol, a beta-blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and salmon calcitonin, a hormone influencing calcium homeostasis in blood. Using all three different models no effect was seen after pindolol administration, while a strong inhibitory effect on the formation of gastric ulcers was observed after salmon calcitonin. Following ligation of the pylorus, the ulcer formation rate was significantly decreased from 80 to 33% with a significant fall in ulcer index from 2 to 0.42 and reduction of the ulcer areas from 6.6 to 0.58 mm2 (p less than 0.05). In addition, following phenylbutazone administration the appearance of gastric ulcers was diminished after salmon calcitonin from 1.4 to 0.43 and in ulcer area from 4.5 to 0.95 mm2 (p less than 0.01). These three ulcer models used in the present study were found to be very reliable as compared with other models reported in the literature and tested in our laboratory.", 
    "41": "The effects of prostaglandin F2 alpha (0,004--0,4 mg per 100 g) on the activity of NADP-dependent dehydrogenases from rat liver and uterus were studied. After 4 hrs following F2 alpha injection the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase was found to increase 4,3- and 1,2-fold in the liver and 5- and 1,6-fold in the uterus, respectively. The content of glucose in the blood remained practically unchanged. No correlation between the amount of F2 alpha and the activities of the pentose phosphate pathway dehydrogenases was observed. The effect of F2 alpha on the dehydrogenases from rat uterus (but not liver) depended on the phase of the sexual cycle and reached its maximum in the period of the secretory activity (estrus). The administration of F2 alpha in combination with alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers (phentolamine or propranolol) did not only enhance but also potentiated their stimulating effects on the activities of the dehydrogenases. F2 alpha shifted the ratio of reduced and oxidized forms of pyridine nucleotides in the liver, increasing it by 11,2 and 33,3% for NADPH/NADP+ and NADH/NADP+, respectively. The NADP-dependent isocitrate, malate and glutamate dehydrogenases from rat liver and uterus as well as the non-oxidizing enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway of carbohydrate metabolism were insensitive to F2 alpha.", 
    "42": "Propranolol when administered acutely causes little change in blood pressure and a decrease in cardiac output. Blood pressure is maintained due to increased vascular resistance. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if increased vascular resistance after propranolol occurs uniformly among various tissues and if increased resistance is due to reflex vasoconstriction. Total and regional vascular resistance were determined with the radioactive microsphere technique in dogs anesthetized with chloralose. Intravenous propranolol, 1 mg/kg, caused little change in blood pressure, cardiac rate, cardiac output and total and regional vascular resistance 30 min after administration. These changes were not different than changes after saline injection. In dogs pretreated with the alpha adrenergic receptor antagonist, dibozane, i.v. propranolol did not affect cardiac rate or blood pressure but reduced cardiac output and increased total peripheral resistance. Vascular resistance in brain, heart, lung, duodenum and skin was increased whereas kidney, spleen and muscle vascular resistance was not significantly changed. It is concluded that increased vascular resistance produced by propranolol does not occur uniformly among tissues. Increased vascular resistance after propranolol is not due to reflex activation of alpha adrenergic receptors but may involve alterations in unidentified vasoconstrictor or vasodilator influences in certain vascular beds.", 
    "43": "The results of an 18-month study with Timolol in 36 patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension are presented. Patients with ocular hypertension were well controlled with Timolol alone, while in the glaucoma group most patients needed combined treatment with a parasympathomimetic drug. Some trends suggest a continuous diminution of the hypotensive effect to Timolol, especially in the glaucoma group. No severe reactions were observed, although slight bradycardia could represent a risk for patients with severe heart conditions. Minor local and systemic side effects are mentioned.", 
    "44": "Nine previously untreated patients with mild-moderate hypertension were included in a dose-ranging double-blind trial to determine the effectiveness of daily versus thrice daily timolol administration. In 8 patients control of blood pressure was equally effective though with significantly lower heart rate achieved in the once daily group. One patient was not satisfactorily controlled on the daily regimen demostrating that many but not all hypertensives can be controlled with daily administration of timolol.", 
    "45": "Five patients with moderate hypertension were given placebo and at least 3 single oral doses (25, 50, 75, 100, or 150 mg) of metoprolol as well as multiple doses at at least 2 dose levels (25, 50, or 100 mg thrice daily). Blood pressure, pulse rate at rest, plasma renin activity, and drug plasma concentration were intensively monitored during 7.5 hr after each dose. Pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, and plasma renin activity decreased after the single oral doses, but diastolic blood pressure did not decrease consistently. The correlation coefficients between percentage decrease in systolic blood pressure and pulse rate and total plasma concentrations were higher individually than in the group. The corresponding regression equations were different between individuals and for systolic blood pressure there was a 700% difference in regression coefficients. The acute changes in diastolic blood pressure and plasma renin activity were not related to metoprolol plasma concentrations. The decrease in systolic blood pressure and pulse rate on multiple doses could not be predicted from the response after single doses.", 
    "46": "Comprehension and recall of the information contained in the informed consent statement was tested in clinically hypertensive patients entering a controlled trial comparing hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol. The consent statement was the primary vehicle for conveying the information to the patient. The average of correct answers to a multiple-choice quiz was 71.6% at 2 hr and 61.2% at 3 mo after the consent procedure. The effectiveness of recall did not correlate with level of education. Patients exhibited greater comprehension of the action of the drugs than of their side effects. Nearly all patients indicated their belief that they would receive the best possible care. While 95% wanted to be informed about the trial, 75% stated they would have given their consent even without this information.", 
    "47": "Labetalol administered in a small to moderate dose (first month 400 mg/day, second month average 585 mg/day) was effective in lowering blood pressure (BP) (-21/-18 mmHg, recumbent) in 11 of 13 mild essential hypertensives over an eight-week period, despite a significant (+294 ml) increase in plasma volume. The effect of propranolol (first month 160 mg/day, second month average 234 mg/day) was significantly less on both blood pressure (-9/-9 mmHg) and plasma volume (+98 ml), although the pre-propranolol BP was lower and the final BP achieved on the two medications was comparable (labetalol 147/89 mmHg, propranolol 145/89). Six patients who continued labetalol for periods of up to 14 months had persistent plasma volume expansion. Three of these, taking a higher dose of labetalol, developed resistance to the drug's antihypertensive effect. Addition of a diuretic restored antihypertensive efficacy and led to a fall in plasma volume. No such plasma volume expansion was seen in six patients who were followed on long term propranolol therapy. Some plasma volume expansion with the combined alpha- beta-adrenoceptor blocker labetalol may be appropriate to its vasodilator action. Provided this effect is not excessive, it appears not to lead to resistance to its antihypertensive action. Small to moderate doses of labetalol would, therefore, seem effective without concomitant diuretic. Such sole use of labetalol could help minimise orthostatic symptoms which can be a major side effect of combination therapy.", 
    "48": "A subpressor dose of adrenalin (0.5 mg/h) infused intravenously into nine conscious trained dogs increased urine kinin excretion from 41 +/- 9 ng/h to 191 +/- 29 ng/h. The effect was abolished by phenoxybenzamin pretreatment (1 mg/kg). In alpha-blocked condition adrenalin increased urine TAMe-esterase activity from 12.7 +/0 2.3 mEU/h to 15.7 +/- 2.8 mEU/h whilst in beta-blocked condition the catecholamine decreased urine enzyme activity from 12.7 +/- 1.0 mEU/h to 11.7 +/- 1.1 mEU/h. Adrenalin invariably decreased urine sodium excretion. In comparable experiments with dopamin (1.0 mg/h) a slight natriuresis was observed, yet urine kallikrein and urine kinin excretions remained unmodified.", 
    "49": "Using the 133Xe clearance method it is shown that NH4Cl infusion into the anterior mesenteric vein decreased capillary blood flow in the liver. Phentolamine completely and propranolol partially prevented the depressive action of NH4Cl on hepatic blood flow. NH5Cl infused into the jugular vein provoked a slight increase in the hepatic blood flow. The adrenaline-like action of ammonium ion on the blood circulation in the liver region is discussed.", 
    "50": "To obviate the myocardial depressant action of propranolol, the use of this drug in combination with a positive inotropic agent, mannitol, was studied in the ischemic heart of the dog. Mannitol (25%) administered prior to propranolol augmented myocardial contractility, as shown by an upward shift of the relationship between the pressure change with time and the mean left atrial pressure. Subsequent administration of propranolol did not offset the positive inotropic response to mannitol whereas it markedly reduced the heart rate from a control ischemic value of 127.8 +/- 3.4 to 109 +/- 4.0 beats/min. The myocardial oxygen requirement, as determined by the tension-time index per minute, decreased 26.3 +/- 1.2% below the control ischemic value. These findings suggest that hypertonic mannitol augments contractility in the ischemic failing heart while sustaining the desirable negative chronotropic action of propranolol. This procedure may potentiate the beneficial effects of propranolol on the myocardial oxygen balance and serve as an effective therapeutic modality in the control of acute irreversible ischemia.", 
    "51": "1. Post-ganglionic neurones of the rat superior cervical ganglion were studied in vitro (21-26 degrees C) using single intracellular micro-electrode methods. 2. Three Ca2+-dependent potentials were studied: the shoulder on the normal action potential, the hyperpolarizing afterpotential (h.a.p.), and th Ca2+ spike. 3. Bath-applied noradrenaline reversibly inhibited these Ca2+-dependent potentials. The EC50 for inhibition of peak h.a.p. amplitude was about 1 microM. The order of catetholamine potency was: L-adrenaline > L-noradrenaline > D-noradrenaline congruent to dopamine > DL-isoprenaline. Phentolamine (10 microM), an alpha-blocker, but not MJ-1999 (10 microM), a beta-blocker, antagonized the action of noradrenaline. 4. Noradrenaline (10 microM) hyperpolarized most neurones (1-6 mV) studied, with no detectable change in resting membrane conductance. 5. Superfusion with low external Ca2+ and high Mg2+ mimicked the effect of noradrenaline. Either procedure alone antagonized the h.a.p. conductance increase but did not alter the h.a.p. reversal potential. However, in the presence of low Ca2+, high Mg2+, the remaining action potential and h.a.p. were not further reduced by noradrenaline. 6. The Ca2+-dependent shoulder of the action potential did not appear dependent upon GK. Noradrenaline and low Ca2+ antagonized the shoulder when enhanced by TEA+ or Ba2+. 7. Both the rate of rise and amplitude of the Ca2+ spike were antagonized by noradrenaline. 8. We propose that activation of an alpha-adrenoceptor inhibits a voltage-sensitive Ca2+ conductance (GCa(V)), thereby reducing the inward Ca2+ current which may generate the noraml action potential shoulder and the rising phase of the Ca2+ spike. Reduction of Ca2+ current would also reduce the Ca2+-dependent portion of outward K+ current underlying the h.a.p.", 
    "52": "The positive inotropic response of guinea-pig isolated atria to isoprenaline was antagonized to a greater extent than the positive chronotropic response, when measured at 38 degrees C as the reduction of the responses to a single concentration of isoprenaline. This method avoided increasing the the concentration of agonist in the presence of practolol and any difference in the proportion metabolized affecting the blockade. This observation was substantiated from the vertical displacement of dose-response curves from four concentrations of isoprenaline added sequentially. No difference between the antagonism of rate and tension was obtained when the antagonism was measured as the horizontal displacement of complete dose-response curves constructed sequentially or cumulatively. The resultant pA2 values from cumulative dose-response curves were identical, indicating that the beta-adrenoceptors subserving these responses are the same. The rate and tension curves were not, however, superimposable; rate lay to the left. By lowering the bath temperature to 30 degrees C they were brought together and the selective antagonism was no longer observed. This phenomenon was therefore attributed to the separation of rate and tension curves at 38 degrees C, the selected concentration of isoprenaline occupying different positions on these curves."
