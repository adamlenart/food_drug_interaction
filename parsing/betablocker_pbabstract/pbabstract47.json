Formulations containing secondary amines and reducing carbohydrates are prone to the condensation of amine and carbonyl functional groups and formation of glycosylamines in pharmaceutically relevant conditions. Further rearrangement occurs in the presence of a nucleophile and leads to the formation of 1-deoxy-1-amino-2-ketose also known as the Amadori Rearrangement Product (ARP). The influence of water content, carbohydrate, and lubricant types on the reaction rate was tested. The reaction progress was monitored by HPLC and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The structures of intermediates were confirmed by the LC/MS(2) analysis. N-formylbisoprolol - the final reaction product - was synthesised and characterised by LC/MS(2), H(1) and C(13) NMR.", 
    "6": "The purpose of this work was to develop hollow calcium pectinate beads for floating pulsatile release of metoprolol tartrate intended for chronopharmacotherapy. Floating pulsatile concept was applied to increase the gastric residence of the dosage form having lag phase followed by a burst release. To overcome limitations of various approaches for imparting buoyancy, hollow/porous beads were prepared by simple process of acid-base reaction during ionotropic cross-linking using low methoxy pectin, xanthan gum, sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, guar gum, locust bean, gellan gum and calcium chloride as a cross-linking agent. Based on the preliminary studies optimized polymers were selected for formulation design with different polymers ratio concentrations. The obtained floating beads were studied for entrapment efficiency, buoyancy study, swelling index, surface morphology, in vitro release, stability studies and in vivo floating study. The floating beads obtained were porous, float up to 12-24\u00a0h. The radiological studies (X-rays) pointed out the capability of the system to release drug in lower parts of GIT after a programmed lag time for hypertension. The floating beads provided expected two-phase release pattern with initial lag time during floating in acidic medium followed by rapid pulse release in phosphate buffer. From the accelerated stability studies, it was observed that the formulations are quite stable. All formulations followed first-order release kinetics by diffusion mechanism. This approach suggested the use of hollow calcium pectinate microparticles as promising floating pulsatile drug delivery system for site- and time-specific release of drugs acting as per chronotherapy of diseases.", 
    "7": "Beta blockers are indicated for management of acute coronary syndromes, but they generally are withheld in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain because of concerns for adverse outcomes related to the unique physiological effects of cocaine. Because few clinical studies have evaluated this interaction, we identified patients with toxicology screen results positive for cocaine treated for chest pain at 2 academic hospitals. Clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were compared between patients with and without \u03b2-blocker therapy. We then constructed propensity scores to evaluate the independent relation between \u03b2-blocker use and the composite primary end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, ventricular arrhythmia, or all-cause mortality after adjusting for clinical characteristics. Of 376 consecutive patients with cocaine-related chest pain, \u03b2 blockers were used in 164 (44%). Compared with no \u03b2 blockers, patients treated with \u03b2 blockers were more likely to describe anginal chest pain, to have known cardiovascular risk factors, and to receive other antiatherosclerotic therapies. Despite these higher risk clinical characteristics, patients treated with \u03b2 blockers experienced similar peak troponin levels, individual adverse events, and rates of the composite primary end point (15.9% vs 12.3%, p = 0.32). The primary end point also was similar after propensity score analysis (odds ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 2.93, p = 0.42), including specific comparisons of beta-1 selective (odds ratio 1.83, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 4.24) and nonselective (odds ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 2.42) \u03b2 blockers, when compared with patients not receiving \u03b2 blockers. In conclusion, no differences in outcomes were observed between patients treated versus not treated with \u03b2-blocker therapy in the setting of cocaine-related chest pain.",

Three needles were inserted in rabbit left ventricle to record unipolar electrograms from endocardium to epicardium and base to apex. Total repolarization interval (TRI) and peak-to-end repolarization interval (Tp) were assessed after quinidine (n\u00a0=\u00a06) and D,L-sotalol (n\u00a0=\u00a06) perfusion in combination with the IKs inhibitor chromanol 293B. About 30\u00a0\u00b5M D,L-sotalol increased TRI and Tp more at the base (TRI +\u00a040\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0%; Tp +89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0%) relative to the apex (TRI +\u00a028\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0%, Tp +\u00a030\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0%). Similar results were obtained with quinidine: TRI and Tp increased more at the base compared to the apex. No significant differences were recorded from the endocardium to the epicardium. Our results show that combined IKr\u00a0+\u00a0IKs block prolonged TRI and Tp significantly more at the ventricular base than at the apex, in the absence of transmural dispersion of refractoriness. Regional changes in TRI and Tp indicate the contribution of apicobasal dispersion to arrhythmogenicity compared to TDR in a rabbit heart model.",

    "30": "Based on previous studies we hypothesize that under stress conditions catecholamine-induced hyperglycemia contributes to enhance cortisol production in head kidney of rainbow trout. Therefore, treatment with propranolol (\u03b2-adrenoceptor blocker) should reduce the hyperglycemia elicited by stress and, therefore, we expected reduced glucosensing response and cortisol production in head kidney. Propranolol treatment was effective in blocking most of the effects of catecholamines in liver energy metabolism resulting in a lower glycemia in stressed fish. The decreased glycemia of stressed fish treated with propranolol was observed along with reduced transcription of genes involved in the cortisol synthetic pathway, which supports our hypothesis. However, changes in putative glucosensing parameters assessed in head kidney were scarce and in general did not follow changes noted in glucose levels in plasma. Furthermore, circulating cortisol levels did not change in parallel with changes in glycemia. As a whole, the present results suggest that glycemia could participate in the regulation of cortisol synthetic pathways but other factors are also likely involved. Propranolol effects on trout stress response were different depending on time passed after stress onset; the direct or indirect involvement of catecholaminergic response in the regulation of cortisol production and release deserves further investigation.", 
    "31": "We reviewed the natural history of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The effect of medical treatments on natural history, left ventricular (LV) functions and LV remodeling was also evaluated. Sudden cardiac death and end-stage heart failure are the most serious complications of HCM. Age <30 years and a family history of sudden premature death are risk factors for sudden cardiac death in HCM patients. End-stage heart failure is not a specific additional phenomenon observed in patients with HCM, but is the natural course of the disease in most of those patients. After the occurrence of heart failure, the progression to cardiac death is very rapid. Young age at diagnosis, a family history of HCM, and greater wall thickness are associated with a greater likelihood of developing end-stage heart failure. Neither beta-blockers nor calcium antagonists can prevent this transition. The class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs, disopyramide and cibenzoline are useful for the reduction of LV pressure gradient. Unlike disopyramide, cibenzoline has little anticholinergic activity; therefore, this drug can be easily adapted to long-term use. In addition to the reduction in LV pressure gradient, cibenzoline can improve LV diastolic dysfunction, and induce regression of LV hypertrophy in patients with HCM. A decrease in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration through the activation of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger associated with cibenzoline therapy is likely to be closely related with the improvement in HCM-related disorders. It is possible that cibenzoline can prevent the progression from typical HCM to end-stage heart failure.",

    "40": "Although recognized as overly conservative, metoprolol is currently the common low/high BCS permeability class boundary reference compound, while labetalol was suggested as a potential alternative. The purpose of this study was to identify the various characteristics that the optimal marker should exhibit, and to investigate the suitability of labetalol as the permeability class reference drug. Labetalol's BCS solubility class was determined, and its physicochemical properties and intestinal permeability were thoroughly investigated, both in vitro and in vivo in rats, considering the complexity of the whole of the small intestine. Labetalol was found to be unequivocally a high-solubility compound. In the pH range throughout the small intestine (6.5-7.5), labetalol exhibited pH-dependent permeability, with higher permeability at higher pH values. While in vitro octanol-buffer partitioning (Log D) values of labetalol were significantly higher than those of metoprolol, the opposite was evident in the in vitro PAMPA permeability assay. The results of the in vivo perfusion studies in rats lay between the two contradictory in vitro studies; metoprolol was shown to have moderately higher rat intestinal permeability than labetalol. Theoretical distribution of the ionic species of the drugs was in corroboration with the experimental in vitro and the in vivo data. We propose three characteristics that the optimal permeability class reference drug should exhibit: (1) fraction dose absorbed in the range of 90%; (2) the optimal marker drug should be absorbed largely via passive transcellular permeability, with no/negligible carrier-mediated active intestinal transport (influx or efflux); and (3) the optimal marker drug should preferably be nonionizable. The data presented in this paper demonstrate that neither metoprolol nor labetalol can be regarded as optimal low/high-permeability class boundary standard. While metoprolol is too conservative due to its complete absorption, labetalol has been shown to be a substrate for P-gp-mediated efflux transport, and both drugs exhibit significant segmental-dependent permeability along the gastrointestinal tract. Nevertheless, the use of metoprolol as the marker compound does not carry a risk of bioinequivalence: Peff value similar to or higher than metoprolol safely indicates high-permeability classification. On the other hand, a more careful data analysis is needed if labetalol is used as the reference compound.", 
    "41": "Purpose. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of glaucoma patients to investigate how switching medications may affect intraocular pressure (IOP) management. Three concomitant medications were changed to two medications: one combination drop and one single-action drop. Associated adverse effects were also examined. Subjects and Methods. A total of 112 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were examined. All patients were concomitantly using a prostaglandin (PG) analog, a \u03b2 -blocker, and a carbonic anhydrate inhibitor (CAI). Fifty-five patients began using latanoprost (PG analog)/timolol ( \u03b2 -blocker) fixed-combination (LTFC) drops and a CAI (group 1), and 57 patients began using dorzolamide (CAI)/timolol fixed-combination (DTFC) drops and a PG analog (group 2). The IOP was measured every 6 months for 2 years following medication changes. Changes in visual field mean deviation (MD) and medication discontinuations were also examined. Results. There were no significant differences in IOP or MD values before and after medication changes in either group. The proportion of medication discontinuations, uncontrolled IOP, and adverse reactions was similar in both groups. Conclusion. Switching patients from multiple single-action medications to combination medications was not associated with changes in IOP, visual field testing results, or adverse event frequency.",

    "46": "The clinical relevance of the anti-inflammatory properties of beta-2 agonists remains contentious possibly due to differences in their molecular structures and agonist activities. The current study has compared the effects of 3 different categories of \u03b2 2-agonists, namely, salbutamol (short-acting), formoterol (long-acting) and indacaterol (ultra-long-acting), at concentrations of 1-1000\u2009nM, with human blood neutrophils in vitro. Neutrophils were activated with either N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP, 1\u2009\u00b5M) or platelet-activating factor (PAF, 200\u2009nM) in the absence and presence of the \u03b2 2-agonists followed by measurement of the generation of reactive oxygen species and leukotriene B4, release of elastase, and expression of the \u03b2 2-integrin, CR3, using a combination of chemiluminescence, ELISA, colorimetric, and flow cytometric procedures respectively. These were correlated with alterations in the concentrations of intracellular cyclic-AMP and cytosolic Ca(2+). At the concentrations tested, formoterol and indacaterol caused equivalent, significant (P < 0.05 at 1-10\u2009nM) dose-related inhibition of all of the pro-inflammatory activities tested, while salbutamol was much less effective (P < 0.05 at 100\u2009nM and higher). Suppression of neutrophil reactivity was accompanied by elevations in intracellular cAMP and accelerated clearance of Ca(2+) from the cytosol of activated neutrophils. These findings demonstrate that \u03b2 2-agonists vary with respect to their suppressive effects on activated neutrophils.", 
    "47": "Chronic visceral pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been difficult to treat effectively partially because its pathophysiology is not fully understood. Recent studies show that norepinephrine (NE) plays an important role in the development of visceral hypersensitivity. In this study, we designed to investigate the role of adrenergic signaling in visceral hypersensitivity induced by heterotypical intermittent stress (HIS). Abdominal withdrawal reflex scores (AWRs) used as visceral sensitivity were determined by measuring the visceromoter responses to colorectal distension. Colon-specific dorsal root ganglia neurons (DRGs) were labeled by injection of DiI into the colon wall and were acutely dissociated for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Blood plasma level of NE was measured using radioimmunoassay kits. The expression of \u03b22-adrenoceptors was measured by western blotting. We showed that HIS-induced visceral hypersensitivity was attenuated by systemic administration of a \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, in a dose-dependent manner, but not by a \u03b1-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine. Using specific \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists, HIS-induced visceral hypersensitivity was alleviated by \u03b22 adrenoceptor antagonist but not by \u03b21- or \u03b23-adrenoceptor antagonist. Administration of a selective \u03b22-adrenoceptor antagonist also normalized hyperexcitability of colon-innervating DRG neurons of HIS rats. Furthermore, administration of \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist suppressed sustained potassium current density (IK) without any alteration of fast-inactivating potassium current density (IA). Conversely, administration of NE enhanced the neuronal excitability and produced visceral hypersensitivity in healthy control rats, and blocked by \u03b22-adrenoceptor antagonists. In addition, HIS significantly enhanced the NE concentration in the blood plasma but did not change the expression of \u03b22-adrenoceptor in DRGs and the muscularis externa of the colon. The present study might provide a potential molecular target for therapy of visceral hypersensitivity in patents with IBS.",

In a previous study we investigated the influence of the maternal use of labetalol on the cerebral autoregulation (CA) mechanism of neonates. In that study, we found that labetalol induces impaired CA during the first day of life, with CA returning to a normal status by the third day after birth. This effect was hypothesized to be caused by labetalol-induced vasodilation. However, no strong evidence for this claim was found. In this study we aim to find stronger evidence for the vasodilation effect caused by labetalol, by investigating its effect on the neurogenic mechanism (NM) involved in CA. The status of the NM was assessed by means of transfer function analysis between the low frequency content of the autonomic control activity (LFA), obtained by processing of the heart rate (HR), and the regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO\u2082). We found that neonates from mothers treated with labetalol presented a lower LFA and an impaired NM response during the first day of life, with values returning to normal by the end of the third day. These results reflect a vasodilation effect caused by labetalol, and indicate that the impaired CA observed in the previous study is caused by vasodilation.",

International guidelines recommend an annual assessment of cardiac function and initiation of appropriate pharmacological treatment. We conducted an audit of the cardiac management in patients with DMD requiring ventilatory support and reported a case series of the collated cardiac investigations. Patients with DMD requiring ventilatory support were included in the study. The date of the last electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), cardiology review and pharmacological management were retrieved from the medical records. If an annual cardiac assessment had not been performed this was requested and the latest ECGs and ECHO reports were collated. A total of 30 patients with DMD (29 males, mean (SD) age of 30 (7) years) met the inclusion criteria. Although there was ECG and ECHO documentation in 24 and 21 individuals, respectively, it was only recent in 10 and 6 individuals. In all, 60% of patients had been assessed by a cardiologist, but only 10% within the last year. Over half of the patients failed to attend their new appointments. From the available results, 18 of the 19 patients had an abnormal ECG, 11 of the 16 patients had left ventricular (LV) impairment and 55% of patients had a change in prescription following cardiac investigations. There is a need for a coordinated cardiorespiratory approach towards adult patients with DMD.

    "80": "Decreased activity of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that metabolizes catecholamines, contributes to pain in humans and animals. Previously, we demonstrated that development of COMT-dependent pain is mediated by both \u03b22- and \u03b23-adrenergic receptors (\u03b22ARs and \u03b23ARs). Here we investigated molecules downstream of \u03b22- and \u03b23ARs driving pain in animals with decreased COMT activity. Based on evidence linking their role in pain and synthesis downstream of \u03b22- and \u03b23AR stimulation, we hypothesized that nitric oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokines drive COMT-dependent pain. To test this, we measured plasma NO derivatives and cytokines in rats receiving the COMT inhibitor OR486 in the presence or absence of the \u03b22AR antagonist ICI118,551+\u03b23AR antagonist SR59320A. We also assessed whether the NO synthase inhibitor L-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and cytokine-neutralizing antibodies block the development of COMT-dependent pain. Results showed that animals receiving OR486 exhibited higher levels of NO derivatives, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) in a \u03b22- and \u03b23AR-dependent manner. Additionally, inhibition of NO synthases and neutralization of the innate immunity cytokines TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 blocked the development of COMT-dependent pain. Finally, we found that NO influences TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and CCL2 levels, whereas TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 influence NO levels. Altogether, these results demonstrate that \u03b22- and \u03b23ARs contribute to COMT-dependent pain, at least partly, by increasing NO and cytokines. Furthermore, they identify \u03b22- and \u03b23ARs, NO, and proinflammatory cytokines as potential therapeutic targets for pain patients with abnormalities in COMT physiology.",

Multiple linear regression (MLR) using least square estimation was performed on the data set with logkpas dependent variable and the descriptors as predictor variables. The potential systemic capacity after a buccal administration was predicted by estimating the plasma concentrations at steady-stated (Css). Considering the entire process of permeation ex vivo, propranolol and oxprenolol would seem to be the best candidates for administration through the buccal mucosa.",

Surgical resection, the only curative treatment, carries a high risk of hypertensive crises due to massive catecholamine release. Alpha 1 blocker therapy, alone or in combination with beta blockers, calcium antagonists, and plasma volume expansion, is the most commonly used preoperative treatment protocol. Minimally invasive adrenalectomy (laparoscopic and retro-peritoneoscopic) allows earlier mobilization and recovery, reducing the risk of pulmonary infections and thromb-oembolic complications, and is associated with lower morbidity and mortality rates than traditional surgery; it is currently considered the gold standard for the treatment of adrenal tumors \u22646 cm in diameter and weighing < 100 g.

It is a basic peptide consisting of 37 amino acids with an amidated C-terminal residue. Urotoxin contains eight cysteines forming four disulfide bridges with sequence similarities resembling the \u03b1-potassium channel toxin 6 (\u03b1-KTx-6) subfamily of peptides; it was assigned the systematic number of \u03b1-KTx-6.21. Urotoxin is a potent blocker of human voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv)1.2 channels, with an IC50 of 160 pM, whereas its affinity for other channels tested was in the nanomolar range (hKv1.1, IC50 = 253 nM; hKv1.3, IC50 = 91 nM; and hKCa3.1, IC50 = 70 nM). The toxin had no effect on hKv1.4, hKv1.5, human ether-\u00e0-go-go-related gene type 1 (hERG1), or human ether-\u00e0-go-go-like (hELK2) channels. Multiple sequence alignments from the venom gland transcriptome showed the existence of four other new peptides similar to urotoxin. Computer modeling of urotoxin's three-dimensional structure suggests the presence of the \u03b1/\u03b2-scaffold characteristic of other scorpion toxins, although very likely forming an uncommon disulfide pairing pattern. Using molecular dynamics, a model for the binding of this peptide to human Kv1.2 and hKv1.1 channels is presented, along with the binding of an in silico mutant urotoxin (Lys25Ala) to both channels. Urotoxin enriches our knowledge of K(+) channel toxins and, due to its high affinity for hKv1.2 channels, it may be a good candidate for the development of pharmacologic tools to study the physiologic functions of K(+) channels or related channelopathies and for restoring axonal conduction in demyelinated axons.",

The two monomers were synthesized and reacted with acryloyl chloride to get the corresponding acryloylamino acid, which were further grafted onto starch using the microwave-assisted grafting technique. All factors affecting the efficiency of the grafting reaction were studied and the prepared graft copolymers were fully characterized. Atenolol, as a model drug in the form of salt was immobilized onto the graft copolymers by ionic bonds and the loading was confirmed by use of FT-IR, TGA and NMR. The drug release was studied in both acidic and alkaline media and it was found that the release takes place in alkaline medium rather than in acidic medium and this indicates that these polymers can be used as carriers for drugs whose target is the colon.", 
    "106": "The low-molecular-weight succinoglycans isolated from Sinorhizobium meliloti are repeating octasaccharide units consisting of monomers, dimers, and trimers. Pindolol is a beta-blocker used to treat cardiovascular disorders. We investigated the formation of complexes between pindolol and low-molecular-weight succinoglycan monomers (SGs). Even though SGs have a linear structure, the solubility of pindolol in the presence of SGs was increased up to 7-fold compared with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin reported as the best solubilizer of pindolol. Complexation of SGs with pindolol was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and scanning electron microscopy. Formation constants of complexes were determined from phase solubility diagrams. Conformation of complex was suggested based on a molecular docking study. The present study indicated that formation of pindolol/SGs complexes not only resulted in increased pindolol solubility but also could be useful for improving its clinical application as it did not affect cell viability.",

The authors aimed to analyze the frequency of adverse events experienced by children treated with oral beta-blockers in a cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU) and sought out independent risk factors for these adverse events in a tertiary care hospital. The primary end point in this retrospective descriptive study was the incidence of adverse events associated with enteral beta-blocker administration, and the secondary end point was the incidence of readmission to the CVICU after transfer of patients to an acute care floor. At least one clinical adverse event occurred for 38% of the patients. Specifically, the profile of the clinical adverse events included bradycardia in 27 patients (11%), hypoglycemia in 46 patients (19%), and the initiation or escalation of inotropes in 36 patients (15%) after oral beta-blocker administration. Additionally, 41 patients (17%) were readmitted to the CVICU after transfer during the same hospital admission. The patients receiving propranolol were predisposed to have at least one adverse event (p = 0.045). No other patient-specific characteristics significantly predisposed patients to adverse events. The patients admitted after a cardiac procedure had fewer readmissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) during the same hospital admission (p = 0.002). The results demonstrated that adverse events are relatively common among patients receiving oral beta-blockers in a CVICU population. Because these children have less physiologic reserve, more must be done to ensure that the correct beta-blocker is prescribed to avoid clinically significant adverse events that may hamper the recovery of these patients and lead to increased ICU time.",

    "119": "Mice treated with sorafenib or vehicle for 3 weeks underwent induced myocardial infarction (MI) after 1 week of treatment. Sorafenib markedly decreased 2-week survival relative to vehicle-treated controls, but echocardiography at 1 and 2 weeks post MI detected no differences in cardiac function. Sorafenib-treated hearts had significantly smaller diastolic and systolic volumes and reduced heart weights. High doses of sorafenib induced necrotic death of isolated myocytes in vitro, but lower doses did not induce myocyte death or affect inotropy. Histological analysis documented increased myocyte cross-sectional area despite smaller heart sizes after sorafenib treatment, further suggesting myocyte loss. Sorafenib caused apoptotic cell death of cardiac- and bone-derived c-kit+ stem cells in vitro and decreased the number of BrdU+ (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine+) myocytes detected at the infarct border zone in fixed tissues. Sorafenib had no effect on infarct size, fibrosis, or post-MI neovascularization. When sorafenib-treated animals received metoprolol treatment post MI, the sorafenib-induced increase in post-MI mortality was eliminated, cardiac function was improved, and myocyte loss was ameliorated.", 
    "120": "Sorafenib cardiotoxicity results from myocyte necrosis rather than from any direct effect on myocyte function. Surviving myocytes undergo pathological hypertrophy. Inhibition of c-kit+ stem cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis exacerbates damage by decreasing endogenous cardiac repair. In the setting of MI, which also causes large-scale cell loss, sorafenib cardiotoxicity dramatically increases mortality.", 
    "121": "Chronic immunosuppressive therapy is often complicated by the development of both arterial hypertension and renal dysfunction. The principal aim of this study was to assess the effects of dual inhibition of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and other antihypertensive treatment on blood pressure and renal function in normotensive and hypertensive Fawn-Hooded (FH) strains during chronic calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) administration. Combinations of perindopril (5\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day) and losartan (50\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day) or amlodipine (6\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day) and metoprolol (80\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day) were administered to normotensive (FHL) and hypertensive (FHH) rats, fed with diet containing tacrolimus (Tac; 12\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day). Tac-induced arterial hypertension in both animal strains (FHL: 151\u00b14; FHH: 198\u00b16\u2009mm\u2009Hg) was prevented by dual RAS inhibition (FHL: 132\u00b13\u2009mm\u2009Hg, P<0.05; FHH: 153\u00b13\u2009mm\u2009Hg, P<0.05) as well as by a combination of amlodipine and metoprolol (FHL: 136\u00b13\u2009mm\u2009Hg, P<0.05; FHH: 166\u00b14\u2009mm\u2009Hg, P<0.05). However, significant nephroprotection was observed only in animals on dual RAS inhibition where albuminuria was reduced in both FHL (51.1\u00b13.9 vs. 68.3\u00b14.5\u2009\u03bcg per day; P<0.05) and FHH rats (13.1\u00b10.3 vs. 18.8\u00b10.7\u2009mg per day; P<0.05). We also found Tac-induced enhancement in renal angiotensin II activity that was significantly reduced by dual RAS inhibition in both FHL (63.5\u00b13.2 vs. 23.1\u00b13.0\u2009fmol\u2009g(-1)) and FHH (79.8\u00b18.5 vs. 32.2\u00b15.8\u2009fmol\u2009g(-1)). In addition, histological analysis revealed that RAS inhibition noticeably diminished glomerulosclerosis and tubulo-interstitial injury. This study indicates that dual blockade of RAS significantly attenuates Tac-induced arterial hypertension and nephrotoxicity in FH rats and further supports the notion that RAS inhibitors display efficient renoprotective properties during CNI treatment.",

The most sensitive species, the mussel, was affected to the same extent as in previous single species studies, while the effects on the amphipod and alga were smaller or even positive compared to experiments performed in less complex test systems. The observed cascade of beneficial effects was a result of inter-specific species interactions that buffered for more severe effects. The poor condition of the mussel led to a feeding shift from alga to mussel by the amphipods. The better food quality, due to the dietary shift, counteracted the effects of the exposure. Less amphipod grazing, together with increased levels of nutrients in the water was favourable for the alga, despite the negative effects of propranolol. This microcosm study showed effects on organisms on different organizational levels as well as interactions among the different components resulting in indirect exposure effects of both functional and structural nature. The combination of both direct and indirect effects would not have been detected using simpler single- or even two-species study designs. The observed structural changes would in the natural environment have a long-term influence on ecosystem function, especially in a low-biodiversity ecosystem like the Baltic Sea.",

Conventional therapies, including fluid resuscitation, atropine, cardiac pacing, calcium, glucagon, and vasopressors often fail to improve hemodynamic status. High-dose insulin (HDI) is an emerging therapeutic modality for PICS. In this article, we discuss the existing literature and highlight the therapeutic success and potential of HDI. Based on the current literature, which is limited primarily to case series and animal models, the authors conclude that HDI can be effective in restoring hemodynamic stability, and recommend considering its use in patients with PICS that is not responsive to traditional therapies. Future studies should be undertaken to determine the optimal dose and duration of therapy for HDI in PICS.", 
    "131": "Treatment of hypertension in the elderly is expected to become more complex in the coming decades. Based on the current landscape of clinical trials, guideline recommendations remain inconclusive. The present review discusses the latest evidence derived from studies available in 2013 and investigates optimal blood pressure (BP) and preferred treatment substances. Three common archetypes are discussed that hamper the treatment of hypertension in the very elderly. In addition, this paper presents the current recommendations of the NICE 2011, JNC7 2013-update, ESH/ESC 2013, CHEP 2013, JNC8 and ASH/ISH guidelines for elderly patients. Advantages of the six main substance classes, namely diuretics, beta-blockers (BBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) are discussed. Medical and economic implications of drug administration in the very elderly are presented. Avoidance of treatment-related adverse effects has become increasingly relevant. Current substance classes are equally effective, with similar effects on cardiovascular outcomes. Selection of substances should therefore also be based on collateral advantages of drugs that extend beyond BP reduction. The combination of ACEIs and diuretics appears to be favorable in managing systolic/diastolic hypertension. Diuretics are a preferred and cheap combination drug, and the combination with CCBs is recommended for patients with isolated systolic hypertension. ACEIs and CCBs are favorable for patients with dementia, while CCBs and ARBs imply substantial cost savings due to high adherence.", 
    "132": "Ivabradine is a drug used for the treatment of angina and chronic heart failure in cases of intolerance or insufficiency of response to beta-blocker treatment. A 47-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department of the hospital for a voluntary intoxication with 280 mg of ivabradine: he presented drowsiness and a mild sinusal bradycardia (50 bpm) associated with a well-tolerated low blood pressure at 100/50 mmHg. No complication was noted and he was discharged from the hospital on Day 3. A method for ivabradine assay in serum was obtained using liquid chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometry detection method. After a deproteinization step using QuECHERS salts and acetonitrile, a chromatographic separation was performed using a 5-\u00b5m 50 \u00d7 2.1 mm Xterra\u00ae column (Waters, France). Detection was performed using an LTQ linear ion-trap mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source used in a positive ionization mode (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose CA, USA) and a detection in full MS(2) scan. The limit of quantification of ivabradine was 10 \u00b5g/L, and the method was linear up to 1000 \u00b5g/L. The ivabradine concentration in the patient's serum was 375 \u00b5g/L. This concentration value was >30 times those measured after therapeutic doses intakes. Nevertheless, the bradycardia was no more severe than the one observed with therapeutic dosage. In conclusion, this case tends to show an absence of correlation between blood concentration and severity of the troubles in cases of overdosage.", 
    "133": "The field of extracranial vascular anomalies is considered as special focus of pediatric otolaryngology and it has shown a rapid development during the last years. The reason for this interest is finally also due to the global acceptance of the classification introduced by the ISSVA (International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies). Hemangiomas are the most frequently observed vascular tumors. Today the systemic propranolol therapy is mostly used for therapy of hemangiomas requiring treatment. Increasingly, the topical application of beta blocker is discussed while the benefit in the head and neck seems to be limited. Vascular malformations are classified according to the morphology of the affected part of the vascular system in arterial, venous, arterio-venous, lymphatic, capillary, and combined vascular malformations. Conventional surgery, sclerosing therapy, and laser treatment are invasive options for the treatment of lymphatic malformations. The options for the treatment of venous malformations could be significantly improved during the last years. In this context, the use of Nd:YAG laser, the conservative treatment of the localized disseminated intravascular coagulation with low-molecular weight heparin, the re-discovery of bleomycin as effective sclerosing agent, and the improvement of alcohol-based embolization agents must be mentioned. Today the treatment with dye laser is the preferred therapy for capillary malformations and it is superior to other therapeutic options as for example photodynamic therapy. Arterio-venous malformations as representatives for high-flow lesions are the high-risk lesions. Frequently they are compared to malignant head and neck tumors, in particular when a curative treatment can no longer be assured because of diffuse or multifocal extent and when the disease shows a progressive course. The combined treatment of embolization and surgical resection and if necessary consecutive defect reconstruction have turned out to be appropriate for arterio-venous malformations. Incurable findings are still a major challenge. Despite the introduction of antiangiogenetic drugs in oncology, the medicamentous therapeutic approach could not be established for arterio-venous malformations up to now.",

In this study, we examined if a low dose of propranolol, previously shown to be preventive against bone loss in rats, improves bone repair. Female Wistar rats were injected with saline or propranolol (0.1\u2009mg/kg/day) (n\u2009=\u200920/group), 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Three weeks after the beginning of treatment, all rats underwent a mid-diaphyseal transverse osteotomy in the left femur. Radiographic analysis of ostetomy healing was performed 2 and 5 weeks after osteotomy. Rats were sacrificed at 5 weeks and femora collected for measurements of fracture strength by torsional testing, callus volume, and mineral content by micro-CT analysis and histology of fracture callus. Eighty nine percent of osteotomies achieved apparent radiological union by 5 weeks in both groups. Propranolol treatment did not significantly alter the torsional strength of the fractured femur compared with controls. The volume and mineralization of fracture callus at 5 weeks were not significantly different in both groups. Histology showed that endochondral ossification was not affected by propranolol. Altogether, our results demonstrate that propranolol using the regimen described does not significantly improve or inhibit rat osteotomy healing and mechanical strength.",

    "150": "Thrombin effect increasing swelling-induced glutamate efflux was examined in cultured cortical astrocytes, cerebellar granule neurons (CGN), hippocampal and cortical neurons. Hypotonic glutamate efflux (monitored by D-[(3)H]aspartate) from cortical astrocytes was increased by thrombin (5 U/mL) to reach 16% of the cell pool in 5 min. Thrombin had lower effects in CGN, and marginal effects in hippocampal and cortical neurons. These differences were related to the magnitude of thrombin-evoked cytosolic calcium rise. The protease-activated receptor 1 is expressed in astrocytes and neurons. In astrocytes exposed to chemical ischemia (sodium iodoacetate plus sodium azide) D-[(3)H]aspartate release showed a first phase (20-40 min) of initial low efflux which progressively increases; and a second phase (40-60 min) of larger efflux coincident with cell swelling. Efflux at the first phase was 52% inhibited by the glutamate transporter blocker DL-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartic-acid (TBOA) and 11% by the volume-sensitive pathway blocker phloretin. At the second phase, efflux was reduced 52 and 38% respectively, by these blockers. In CGN D-[(3)H]aspartate efflux increased sharply and then decreased. This efflux was 32% reduced by calcium omission, 46% by TBOA and 32% by 4-[(2-butyl-6,7dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-2,3-dihydro-1oxo-1H-inden-5-yl)oxy] butanoic-acid. Thrombin enhanced this release by 32%. Ischemic treatment increased astrocyte mortality from 4% in controls to 39 and 61% in ischemia and ischemia plus thrombin, respectively. Cell death was prevented by phloretin. CGN viability was unaffected by the treatment. These results suggest that coincidence of swelling and thrombin during ischemia elevates extracellular glutamate prominently from astrocyte efflux, which may endanger neurons in vivo.",

Confirmation of those results in clinical trials may lead to development of a new anti-glaucoma treatment. Further clinical studies of long-term nebivolol and carvedilol are recommended. They are necessary for evaluation of usefulness of those drugs for selected groups of patients, for example those with glaucoma and arterial hypertension.", 
    "160": "Aim of the present work is to enhance aqueous solubility of carvedilol (CV) by solid dispersion technique using wide variety of carriers such as: \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2CD), hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP\u03b2CD), tartaric acid (TA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone K-30 (PVP K-30) and poloxamer-407 (PLX-407). Various products of 'CV-solid dispersion' had been studied extensively in various pH conditions to check enhancement of solubility and dissolution characteristics of carvedilol. Any physical change upon interaction between CV and carriers was confirmed by instrumental analysis: XRD, DSC, FTIR and SEM. Negative change of Gibb's free energy and complexation constants (Kc, 75-240M(-1), for cyclodextrins and 1111-20,365M(-1), for PVP K-30 and PLX-407) were the evidence of stable nature of the binding between CV and carriers. 'Solubility enhancement factor' of ionized-CV was found high enough (340 times) with HP\u03b2CD in presence of TA. TA increases the binding efficiency of cyclodextrin and changing the pH of microenvironment in dissolution medium. In addition, ionization process was used to increase the apparent intrinsic solubility of drug. In vitro, dissolution time of CV was remarkably reduced in the solid dispersion system compared to that of pure drug. This may be attributed to increased wettability, dispersing ability and transformation of crystalline state of drug to amorphous one.", 
    "161": "Relative risks (RRs) are often considered the preferred measures of association in prospective studies, especially when the binary outcome of interest is common. In particular, many researchers regard RRs to be more intuitively interpretable than odds ratios. Although RR regression is a special case of generalized linear models, specifically with a log link function for the binomial (or Bernoulli) outcome, the resulting log-binomial regression does not respect the natural parameter constraints. Because log-binomial regression does not ensure that predicted probabilities are mapped to the [0,1] range, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is often subject to numerical instability that leads to convergence problems. To circumvent these problems, a number of alternative approaches for estimating RR regression parameters have been proposed. One approach that has been widely studied is the use of Poisson regression estimating equations. The estimating equations for Poisson regression yield consistent, albeit inefficient, estimators of the RR regression parameters. We consider the relative efficiency of the Poisson regression estimator and develop an alternative, almost efficient estimator for the RR regression parameters. The proposed method uses near-optimal weights based on a Maclaurin series (Taylor series expanded around zero) approximation to the true Bernoulli or binomial weight function. This yields an almost efficient estimator while avoiding convergence problems. We examine the asymptotic relative efficiency of the proposed estimator for an increase in the number of terms in the series. Using simulations, we demonstrate the potential for convergence problems with standard ML estimation of the log-binomial regression model and illustrate how this is overcome using the proposed estimator. We apply the proposed estimator to a study of predictors of pre-operative use of beta blockers among patients undergoing colorectal surgery after diagnosis of colon cancer.",

Evidence from prospective epidemiologic studies has confirmed dietary factors (animal purines, alcohol, and fructose), obesity, the metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diuretic use, and chronic kidney disease as clinically relevant risk factors for hyperuricemia and gout.

The Evaluation of Methods and Management of Acute Coronary Events registry enrolled patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome. There were 1,602 patients who had cardiac catheterization that were used for this analysis. The main outcome measures were evidence-based therapies prescribed at discharge and 6-month incidence of all-cause mortality. The cohort consisted of 1,252 patients with obstructive CAD (>50% luminal diameter obstructed) and 350 patients with nonobstructive CAD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for further medications and other clinical factors was performed. Patients with nonobstructive CAD had significantly (p <0.001) higher rates of \u03b2-blocker (77.8% vs 63.3%) and lower rates of ACE-inhibitor (57.7% vs 66.4%) prescriptions. In patients with nonobstructive CAD, ACE-inhibitor therapy was clearly associated with a lower 6-month mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03 to 0.78, p = 0.004). No significant association between \u03b2-blocker use and death was found. In patients with obstructive CAD, both \u03b2 blockers (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.67, p <0.001) and ACE inhibitors (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.87, p = 0.01) were significantly associated with a reduced risk of 6-month mortality. In conclusion, ACE-inhibitor therapy seems to be an effective first-line treatment for preventing the occurrence of mortality in patients with nonobstructive CAD.",

    "194": "The mechanisms underlying drug induced QT prolongation and the immediate treatment of torsade de pointes have been extensively studied but the post-acute management of the Acquired Long QT Syndrome (ALQTS) remains to be addressed. We aimed to review the state of the art data regarding risk stratification, arrhythmic prevention and treatment of patients with ALQTS. A comprehensive review of the scientific data collectable from MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE (from inception to April 2013) was performed, and descriptive and qualitative information was extracted from the most relevant manuscripts. QT prolonging drugs are widely used in hospital clinical practice, and several studies have shown a high prevalence of QT interval prolongation in patients admitted to hospital and a high rate of prescription of QT interval prolonging drugs to patients presenting with QT interval prolongation. Therefore, the acute and post-acute management of ALQTS is of the utmost importance. Avoidance of offending triggers, electrocardiographic screening, pacing at a relatively fast lower rate limit and using pause prevention programming (preferably with concomitant \u03b2 blocker treatment), implantable defibrillators in the highest risk patients, genetic testing and counselling in selected cases, and family screening are among the potentially applicable strategies. The latter is justifiable by the fact that some studies unveiled a surprisingly similar positive mutation rate in drug induced LQTS compared with congenital LQTS, supporting the hypothesis that the former can be regarded as a latent form of the latter. Drug challenge with D,L-sotalol in suspected LQTS and treatment with a carvedilol analogue, verapamil or an Ikr activating drug are still in need of further investigation. The post-acute management of patients with ALQTS has received scarce attention in the past, probably due to the fact that it is considered a reversible phenomenon in most cases. Considering the relatively high risk of arrhythmic recurrence in the highest risk ALQTS patients, effective preventive and treatment strategies are warranted, and further research is needed.",

Monophasic action potentials and a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed a significant QT prolongation after application of VER as compared with baseline (10 \u00b5M: +25 ms, 30 \u00b5M: +50 ms, P < 0.05) accompanied by an increase of action potential duration (APD). The increase in APD90 was accompanied by a more marked increase in effective refractory period (ERP) leading to a significant increase in post-repolarization refractoriness (PRR, 10 \u00b5M: +30 ms, 30 \u00b5M: +36 ms, P < 0.05). Vernakalant did not affect the dispersion of repolarization. Lowered potassium concentration in bradycardic hearts did not provoke early afterdepolarizations (EADs) or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (pVT). Comparable results were obtained with RAN. Hundred micromolars of SOT led to an increase in QT interval (+49 ms) and APD90 combined with an increased ERP and PRR (+23 ms). In contrast to VER, 100 \u00b5M SOT led to a significant increase in dispersion of repolarization and to the occurrence of EAD in 10 of 12 and pVT in 8 of 12 hearts.",

Sequential metabolic reactions by Phase I and then Phase II enzymes were found in diclofenac [CYP2C9 and UDP-glucuronyltransferases (UGTs)], midazolam (CYP3A4 and UGTs) and propranolol (CYP1A2/2D6 and UGTs). Moreover, lamotrigine and salbutamol were metabolized to lamotrigine-N-glucuronide and salbutamol 4-O-sulfate, respectively. These metabolites, which are human specific, could be observed in clinical studies, but not in conventional hepatic culture systems as in previous reports. Acetaminophen was metabolized to glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, and N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinoneimine (NAPQI) and its metabolites were not observed. In addition, mRNA of drug-metabolism enzymes [CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, UGT1A1, UGT2B7, sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1) and glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1)], which were measured by qRT-PCR, were expressed in the human hepatocyte spheroids.

The results showed that higher entrapment efficiency (80.7%\u00b11.2) was obtained from niosomes prepared using Span 60/cholesterol at a 2 : 1 molar ratio. Stability study revealed that a fairly high retention of atenolol inside vesicles (83.1%\u00b12.35) up to a period of 3 months at 4\u00b0C. It was found that niosomal hydrogel formulation using carbopol 934P significantly exhibited sustained in vitro release of the drug compared with free drug solution and other polymeric hydrogels. The intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering activity of selected atenolol formulations was determined and compared with that of atenolol solution. It is worth noting that niosomal hydrogel formulation was found to show the most significant prolonged decrease in IOP, suggesting that niosomal hydrogel could be a promising delivery system for atenolol.",

    "206": "We selected adults (\u2265 18\u00a0years old) who were diagnosed with T2D (defined by ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes or use of anti-diabetic medications) between January 2004 and October 2011 (\"cases\") from an electronic health records database provided by an integrated health system in the Middle Atlantic region. Twice as many individuals enrolled in the health system without a T2D diagnosis during the study period (\"controls\") were selected based on age, sex, history of cardiac comorbidities or hyperinflammatory state (defined by C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and use of psychiatric or beta blocker medications. BMI was measured during one year prior to the first observed T2D diagnosis (for cases) or a randomly assigned date (for controls); individuals with no BMI measure or BMI\u2009<\u200918.5\u00a0kg/m2 were excluded. We assessed the impact of increased BMI (overweight: 25-29.9\u00a0kg/m2; Obesity Class I: 30-34.9\u00a0kg/m2; Obesity Class II: 35-39.9\u00a0kg/m2; Obesity Class III: \u226540\u00a0kg/m2), relative to normal BMI (18.5-24.9\u00a0kg/m2), on a T2D diagnosis using odds ratios (OR) and relative risks (RR) estimated from multiple logistic regression results.", 
    "207": "We included 12,179 cases (mean age: 55, 43% male) and 25,177 controls (mean age: 56, 45% male). We found a positive association between BMI and the risk of a T2D diagnosis. The strength of this association increased with BMI category (RR [95% confidence interval]: overweight, 1.5 [1.4-1.6]; Obesity Class I, 2.5 [2.3-2.6]; Obesity Class II, 3.6 [3.4-3.8]; Obesity Class III, 5.1 [4.7-5.5]).",

This article reviews clinical trials that inform current standards of practice regarding reperfusion, aggressive vs conservative initial approaches, and the appropriate use of aspirin, dual antiplatelet therapy, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists, anticoagulants, and statins.", 
    "210": "The aim was to investigate the use of cardioprotective drug therapies (aspirin or other antiplatelet agents, \u03b2-blockade, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system-blockade (RAAS-blockade) and statins) and treatment targets achieved in a large cohort of patients with established coronary artery disease and diabetes across Europe.", 
    "211": "EUROASPIRE III is an observational cross-sectional study of stable coronary artery disease patients aged 18-80 years from 76 centres in 22 European countries conducted in 2006-2007. The glycaemic status (prevalent, incident or no diabetes), the guideline treatment targets achieved and the use of pharmacotherapies were assessed at one visit 6-36 months after the index event. Of all 6588 patients investigated (women 25%), 4295 (65%) had no diabetes, 752 (11%) had incident diabetes and 1541 (23%) had prevalent diabetes. All four drugs were used in 44% of the patients with no diabetes, 51% with incident diabetes and 50% with prevalent diabetes respectively. Individual prescriptions for patients with no, incident and prevalent diabetes were respectively: aspirin or other antiplatelet agents 91, 93, and 91%; \u03b2-blockers: 81, 84, and 79%; RAAS-blockers: 77, 76, and 68%; statins: 80, 80, and 79%. The proportion of patients with coronary artery disease and prevalent diabetes reaching the treatment targets were 20% for blood pressure, 53% for low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) and 22% for haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).", 
    "212": "This European study demonstrates a low use of cardioprotective drug therapies among patients with a combination of coronary artery disease and diabetes, which will be contributing to the poor achievement of risk factor treatment targets for cardiovascular prevention.", 
    "213": "Cardiac microvascular rarefaction appears to be involved in hyperthyroidism-induced left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction. We investigated the effects of losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist; diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker; and propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, on cardiac function and structural microcirculatory cardiac alterations in an experimental model of l-thyroxin-induced hyperthyroidism in rats. Hyperthyroidism (HYPER) was induced by intraperitoneal injections of l-thyroxin for 35\u00a0days (600\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/day; n\u00a0=\u00a032). The euthyroid group was treated with distilled water (EUT\u00a0+\u00a0VEH; n\u00a0=\u00a08). On the 14th day, the HYPER group was divided into four groups that received an oral treatment for 21 days with saline (HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0VEH; n\u00a0=\u00a08), losartan (10\u00a0mg/kg/day; HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0LOS, n\u00a0=\u00a08), diltiazem (10\u00a0mg/kg/day; HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0DILT, n\u00a0=\u00a08), or propranolol (10\u00a0mg/kg/day; HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0PROP, n\u00a0=\u00a08). An echocardiographic study was performed at baseline, at the beginning and at the end of the pharmacological treatment protocol (35th day). The structural capillary density in the left ventricle (LV) was analyzed using histochemical analysis with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Griffonia simplicifolia lectin. HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0VEH (182\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0mmHg; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) presented higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared with EUT\u00a0+\u00a0VEH (132\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mmHg). HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0LOS (144\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mmHg), HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0DILT (147\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mmHg) and HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0PROP (153\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0mmHg) presented lower SBP compared with HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0VEH (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Chronic treatment with losartan, diltiazem, and propranolol reversed cardiac structural microvascular rarefaction (HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0VEH 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01; EUT\u00a0+\u00a0VEH 0.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02; HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0LOS 0.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03; HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0DILT 0.49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02; HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0PROP 0.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04 (Vv[cap]/Vv[fib]); P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and enhanced the LV ejection fraction of hyperthyroid rats (HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0VEH 71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03; EUT\u00a0+\u00a0VEH 85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02; HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0LOS 90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03; HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0DILT 85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03; HYPER\u00a0+\u00a0PROP 86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In conclusion, chronic treatment with losartan, diltiazem, and propranolol improved the cardiac microcirculation and function in an experimental model of hyperthyroidism in rats.", 
    "214": "The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classification divides vascular lesions into two major entities: neoplasms originating from the vascular endothelium and vascular malformations. Although this concept has been widely accepted, little has been established regarding vascular lesions in deep organs, such as infantile hepatic hemangioma (IHH). The current nationwide survey identified 19 critical infantile hemangiomas during the most recent 5 years. On histopathology all the lesions examined were neoplastic, but portovenos shunt was found histologically or clinically in some cases. High-output cardiac failure, consumption coagulopathy, and respiratory distress were the major symptoms, and treatment-resistant coagulopathy seemed to be the most reliable predictor of fatal outcome. Although steroid has been the gold standard treatment for these lesions, 25% of the patients were totally insensitive to steroids, whereas propranolol had a prompt effect in one case. For critical IHH with steroid-insensitive thrombocytopenia and prothrombin time prolongation, novel therapeutic options including beta-blocker therapy, surgery, and liver transplantation should be urgently considered as alterative treatment. The present review summarizes the results of the survey.", 
    "215": "This clinical study reports upon the efficacy of gabapentin (Neurontin) for treating severe akathisia (3 on the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale) in two patients receiving quetiapine (Seroquel), one of whom also received olanzapine (Zyprexa) for a short period. The first patient participated in an open-label experiment in which the bedtime dose of gabapentin was discontinued three times at intervals 1 week apart, resulting in severe akathisia which was quickly terminated by taking his usual 1200 mg gabapentin dose. This patient was also taking high doses of two benzodiazepines and a beta blocker, without therapeutic effect upon his akathisia; only gabapentin was efficacious. The second case is a report of a woman taking a high dose of quetiapine for anxiety who experienced severe akathisia which was relieved by taking 1200 mg of gabapentin. Possible mechanisms of action of gabapentin are discussed. Particular attention is drawn to the difference between neuroleptic-induced akathisia and the neurological condition of restless legs syndrome."
