    "0": "Plasma levels of practolol were measured in advanced chronic renal failure. The plasma half life was found to be markedly prolonged. During haemodialysis considerable shortening of the half life occurred. Therapeutic blood levels of practolol can be achieved in maintenance haemodialysis patients by the administration of 200 mg of the drug by mouth at the beginning and end of each dialysis.", 
    "1": "The magnitude and duration of effect of a single 40-mg oral tablet of oxprenolol on the tachycardias associated with motor-car driving, isoprenaline infusion, and walking were compared against placebo in six normal people by a double-blind study. The tachycardias due to driving and isoprenaline were both conspicuousy reduced for over eight hours; the magnitude and duration of the reduction in exercise tachycardia was substantially less. Thus relatively small doses of beta-receptor antagonists will suppress the increase in heart rate induced by mental stress or catecholamines with relatively little effect on the response to everyday exercise. Possibly smaller doses of these drugs would relieve emotionally-induced anginal pain and tachycardia.", 
    "2": "1. The relaxant effect of histamine in the isolated rat uterus remained after the preparation was depolarized in a potassium Ringer.2. The effect was abolished by the calcium-chelating agent, ethyleneglycol bis-aminoethyl ether-tetraacetic acid (EGTA).3. Histamine caused relaxation during calcium-induced contractures in a depolarized uterus treated with EGTA, but did not produce relaxation during barium-induced contractures.4. While responses of a normally polarized rat uterus to acetylcholine were inhibited by histamine, those of a depolarized uterus were enhanced by histamine. The inhibitory effects of isoprenaline and papaverine on acetylcholine responses were maintained in depolarized preparations.5. Both the enhancing effect of histamine on responses to acetylcholine and the relaxation of calcium-induced contractures were abolished by burimamide, indicating that H(2)-receptors mediate the effects of histamine in the depolarized tissue.6. A reduction in the rate of exchange of calcium across the depolarized cell membrane was demonstrated with high concentrations of histamine.7. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that in the rat uterus, the stimulation of H(2)-receptors by histamine is accompanied by a reduction in calcium exchange across the membrane which may result in a decrease in the concentration of free intracellular calcium available to stimulate contraction of the myofilaments. Histamine may act by increasing the binding of calcium within the cell.", 
    "3": "1. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties of alpha-methyl propranolol and alpha-methyl practolol were determined in anaesthetized dogs according to their abilities to modify the isoprenaline-induced effects on diastolic pressure, heart rate, myocardial contractile force, femoral arterial blood flow and pulmonary airway resistance.2. alpha-Methyl propranolol shifted the isoprenaline dose-response curves for the fall in diastolic pressure and the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to the right in a parallel manner yielding pA(2) and slope values of 6.66 (0.92), 6.34 (0.77) and 6.59 (0.61) respectively. The slopes of the graphs for determining pA(2) values for the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties of alpha-methyl propranolol were significantly less than 1 and indicated a mechanism other than simple, competitive, reversible antagonism.3. alpha-Methyl propranolol exerted a much weaker blockade of respiratory smooth muscle beta-adrenoceptors than has been reported for propranolol.4. alpha-Methyl practolol exerted a weaker blocking effect on myocardial beta-adrenoceptors than has been reported for practolol. No significant blockade of vascular or respiratory smooth muscle beta-adrenoceptors occurred after a total cumulative dose of 10 mug/kg of alpha-methyl practolol.5. alpha-Methyl substitution of propranolol and practolol reduces the potency but increases the selectivity of their beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties.6. The beta-adrenoceptors subserving cardiac stimulation, vasodilatation and bronchodilatation are representative of three different beta-adrenoceptor sub-types in the dog.", 
    "4": "A rapid and flexible method has been developed for measuring cell-associated, probably intracellular, nonesterified fatty acids (CAFA) in isolated mouse adipose cells. A variety of lipolytic agents as well as various concentrations of epinephrine elevate CAFA levels in rough proportion to their stimulation of glycerol and fatty acid release. Insulin reduces epinephrine-elevated CAFA levels. A detailed, quantitative study of the relationship among lipolytic activity, CAFA levels, and the extracellular molar ratio of fatty acids to albumin has been carried out. Epinephrine-elevated CAFA levels rise linearly with, while epinephrine-stimulated lipolytic activity is independent of, fatty acid to albumin ratios below 2-3. As the ratio increases from 3 to 5, CAFA levels continue to increase, whereas lipolytic activity decreases. Above ratios of 5, fatty acid release almost completely ceases; CAFA levels increase dramatically with residual glycerol release. A temperature-dependent efflux of epinephrine-elevated CAFA can be elicited through blockade of stimulated lipolysis with propranolol, but only in the presence of extracellular fatty acid to albumin ratios below 3. These observations suggest that during stimulated lipolysis, a fatty acid gradient exists between the cell and extracellular serum albumin and that CAFA represent the intracellular component of this gradient. In addition, these observations support the concept that intracellular fatty acids play a role in the feedback regulation of adipose cell function as extracellular fatty acids accumulate during the lipolytic response.", 
    "5": "The effects of tolamolol, propranolol and practolol on both isoprenaline- and exercise-induced tachycardia have been studied in conscious dogs. Tolamolol was approximately equipotent to propranolol and 50 times more potent than practolol in antagonizing exercise-induced tachycardias, but was approximately 12 times less potent than propranolol and 8 times more potent than practolol in blocking isoprenaline-induced tachycardia. It is suggested that antagonism of the tachycardia induced by exercise affords a more meaningful assessment of the possible therapeutic potential of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs than does that induced by isoprenaline."
