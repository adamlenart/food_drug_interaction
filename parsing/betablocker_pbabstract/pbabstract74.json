There is paucity of studies evaluating the role of \u03b2-blockers in the outcome of ICH. This study reports the role of atenolol in reducing mortality, pneumonia, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and 3 months outcome in the patients with hypertensive ICH. 138 consecutive patients with hypertensive ICH were included and their stroke risk factors and clinical details were recorded. Consciousness was assessed by Glasgow Coma Scale and severity of stroke by Canadian Neurological Scale. Volume of hematoma was measures on CT scan and occurrence of SIRS and pneumonia were noted. 3 months outcome was categorized into good (Barthel index >12) and poor (BI < 12). The patients were categorized into those receiving atenolol and nonatenolol. The effects of atenolol on stroke outcome parameters were evaluated. Seventy-nine patients received atenolol and 59 did not and they mainly received amlodipine. There was no difference in the base line clinical characteristics between the two groups except smoking (P = 0.01) and baseline blood pressure (P = 0.007). Atenolol significantly reduced the mortality (11.4 vs 37.3 %, P < 0.0001), SIRS (16.4 vs 40.9 %, P = 0.007), and pneumonia (8.9 vs 30.5 %, P = 0.002) compared to those not receiving atenolol. At 3 months, patients with atenolol had insignificantly better outcome compared to nonatenolol group (49.1 vs 31.9 %, P = 0.11). Use of atenolol in hypertensive ICH results in reduction in mortality, SIRS, and pneumonia which may be due to its \u03b2-adrenergic blocking effect.", 
    "1": "Data from randomized clinical trials and epidemiological evidence identify systemic hypertension as the second most common modifiable risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression after diabetes mellitus. CKD may progress silently over the years and early diagnosis and control of hypertension is of major importance in delaying renal function decline. Recent guidelines for the treatment of hypertension suggest the use of a variety of antihypertensive drugs in order to achieve the desired blood pressure levels. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors have been undoubtedly studied the most and are suggested by guidelines and experts as first choice in patients with hypertension and renal injury, particularly in those with diabetes, as they have repeatedly shown to significantly reduce proteinuria. Other classes of antihypertensive drugs have been studied to a lesser extent and they have their own unique properties and effects. However, it is now common knowledge that adequate blood pressure control is the most important factor for the preservation of renal function, so every drug that effectively lowers hypertension is believed to be renoprotective. The present article will review the latest data on the role and properties of each class of antihypertensive drugs on CKD.", 
    "2": "The purpose of this study was to formulate a 25-mg atenolol capsule starting from a commercial 100-mg atenolol tablet, given the fact that this strength is not available in Palestine and also because 50-mg atenolol tablets failed the splitting uniformity test of the European Pharmacopoeia, and to evaluate the chemical stability and dissolution behavior of the obtained capsules so as to ensure a high-quality product. A high-performance liquid chromatographic system was used for the analysis and quantification of atenolol in the samples studied. Samples of atenoIol for analysis were prepared as reported by the United States Pharmacopeia monograph. Disintegration and dissolution tests were performed according to the United States Pharmacopeia. The high-performance liquid chromatography assay indicated that the 25-mg atenolol capsules were stable for four months when stored at ambient temperature conditions. The disintegration time for all atenolol capsules was within the United States Pharmacopeia limits of 15 minutes. Atenolol release profile showed that approximately 90% of atenolol dissolved after 10 minutes. This study is important for patients who need to take one half of a 50-mg tablet, but for whom the splitting process doesn't give equal halves, and also for modifying the dose for patients with renal or hepatic problems. Therefore, it is possible for the community pharmacist to crush atenolol 100-mg tablets and refill them in new capsules with each containing a precise amount of atenolol, calculated according to body surface area and kidney and liver functions without affecting the chemical stability of the active ingredient nor its dissolution profile and also have a cost effective dosage form.",

The study was performed on rats divided into groups: 1) saline, 2) saline + LPS (15 mg/kg), 3) BQ123 (1 mg/kg b.w.) + LPS, 4) BQ123 (0.5 mg/kg b.w.) + LPS, 5) BQ788 (3 mg/kg b.w.) + LPS. The ETA-R and ETB-R antagonists were injected i.v. 30 min before LPS administration. In rats, BQ123 caused a significant decrease in TBARS (p < 0.05) but not in H2O2 concentration. It also decreased tissue protein level and improved tissue redox status (p < 0.01). Only a dose of 1 mg/kg decreased TNF-\u03b1 concentration (p < 0.05). BQ788 lowered TBARS, H2O2 and protein concentration (p < 0.05; p < 0.02; p < 0.001, respectively), however, it did not affect TNF-\u03b1 concentration. Neither ETA-R nor ETB-R blockers influenced LPS-induced increase in p65 subunit level and activation of NF-\u03baB pathway. Our results demonstrated that ETA-R blockage is more effective in inhibiting free radical generation and improving heart antioxidant properties than ETB-R blockage under oxidative stress. NF-\u03baB pathway is not incorporated in ETA-R and ETB-R influence on ROS production.", 
    "16": "The incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma is continuously increasing worldwide, but only minimal changes in mortality have been observed. This phenomenon has brought into question whether this increased incidence reflects a true or apparent melanoma epidemic. The most recent data suggest that this epidemiological trend may be explained by the existence of a certain degree of melanoma overdiagnosis, especially of thin lesions, which probably would never progress to advanced disease if left untreated. However, acute sun exposure and widespread use of sunbeds may also justify the increase in melanoma incidence. Recently, both vitamin D and beta-blocker use seem to play a beneficial role in melanoma progression.",

We report the case of a full-term 2-month-old infant girl admitted to our institution with stridor, dyspnoea and oxygen desaturation caused by a SGH and treated with propranolol. Neck-chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a contrast-enhancing, 10-mm, subglottic elliptic lesion, referable to SGH. Pre-treatment fibrobronchoscopy showed a sub-occlusive SGH closing more than 75% of the laryngotracheal airway. In agreement with our neonatologists and ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists, we decided to begin oral propranolol therapy, which rapidly and dramatically improved respiratory symptoms. Fibrobronchoscopy six days after treatment confirmed a reduction of subglottic narrowing. Six months later the patient is doing well and without respiratory symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of the successful treatment with propranolol of an SGH obstructing more than 75% of the airway. The case is evidence of the effectiveness of oral propranolol as first-line treatment in the management of severely-obstructive paediatric SGH and the importance of CT and fibrobronchoscopy in the diagnosis; it also demonstrates the importance of multidisciplinary cooperation between thoracic surgeons, anaesthesiologists, neonatologists and ENT specialists in the treatment of these patients.",

Single oral administrations of up to 500 \u03bcg of vilanterol were shown to be safe and well tolerated in two clinical studies in healthy men. In a human radiolabel study, six healthy men received a single oral dose of 200 \u03bcg of [(14)C]vilanterol (74 kBq). Plasma, urine, and feces were collected up to 168 hours after the dose and were analyzed for vilanterol, metabolites, and radioactivity. At least 50% of the radioactive dose was orally absorbed. The primary route of excretion of drug-related material was via O-dealkylation to metabolites, which were mainly excreted in urine. Vilanterol represented a very small percentage (<0.5%) of the total drug-related material in plasma, indicative of extensive first-pass metabolism. Circulating metabolites resulted mainly from O-dealkylation and exhibited negligible pharmacologic activity. The therapeutic dose level for vilanterol is 25 \u03bcg by the inhalation route. At this low-dose level, the likelihood of pharmacologically inactive metabolites causing unexpected toxicity is negligible. In addition to providing an assessment of the disposition of vilanterol in human, this work highlights a number of complexities associated with determining human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) for inhaled molecules--mainly related to the low chemical doses and complications associated with the inhalation route of administration.",

We have previously demonstrated that amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) assemblies bind to \u03b17 nAChRs and form complexes in AD brain, suggesting that this cooperative process may contribute to disruption of synaptic function in AD. In the current study, we further characterized the interaction between different nAChR subtypes and fibrillar A\u03b2 by binding assays in postmortem brain from AD and control cases using a wide range of drugs with different molecular targets, including selective nAChR subtype agonists, and the amyloid ligand Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) that binds with high (nanomolar) affinity to fibrillar A\u03b2. The \u03b17 nAChR agonists varenicline and JN403, but not the \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR agonist cytisine, increased the 3H-PIB binding in autopsy tissue homogenates from AD and control frontal cortex. This effect was blocked in the presence of the \u03b17 nAChR antagonists methyllycaconitine, \u03b1-bungarotoxin, and mecamylamine, but not by the \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR antagonist dihydro-\u03b2-erythroidine. Increases in (3)H-PIB binding evoked by varenicline and JN403 were also prevented by pre-incubation with another amyloid ligand, BF-227. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and allosteric nAChR modulator galantamine as well as the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor blocker memantine did not significantly alter (3)H-PIB binding levels in AD brain. The present findings further support a specific interaction between fibrillar A\u03b2 and \u03b17 nAChRs in the brain, suggesting that treatment with \u03b17 nAChR stimulatory drugs can modulate A\u03b2/\u03b17 nAChR pathogenic signaling mechanisms in AD brain.",

    "40": "Expression of a cytosolic cyan fluorescent fusion protein of angiotensin II (ECFP/ANG II) in proximal tubules increases blood pressure in rodents. To determine cellular signaling pathways responsible for this response, we expressed ECFP/ANG II in transport-competent mouse proximal convoluted tubule cells (mPCT) from wild-type (WT) and type 1a ANG II receptor-deficient (AT(1a)-KO) mice and measured its effects on intracellular ANG II levels, surrogates of Na/H exchanger 3 (NHE3)-dependent Na(+) absorption, as well as MAP kinases and NF-\u03baB signaling. In WT mPCT cells, ECFP/ANG II expression doubled ANG II levels, increased NHE3 expression and membrane phospho-NHE3 proteins threefold and intracellular Na(+) concentration by 65%. These responses were associated with threefold increases in phospho-ERK 1/2 and phospho-p38 MAPK, fivefold increases in p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB, and threefold increases in phospho-IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 (Ser 176/180) proteins. These signaling responses to ECFP/ANG II were inhibited by losartan (AT(1) blocker), PD123319 (AT(2) blocker), U0126 (MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor), and RO 106-9920 (NF-\u03baB inhibitor). In mPCT cells of AT(1a)-KO mice, ECFP/ANG II also increased the levels of NHE3, p-ERK1/2, and p65 proteins above their controls, but considerably less so than in WT cells. In WT mice, selective expression of ECFP/ANG II in vivo in proximal tubules significantly increased blood pressure and indices of sodium reabsorption, in particular levels of phosphorylated NHE3 protein in the membrane fraction and proton gradient-stimulated (22)Na(+) uptake by proximal tubules. We conclude that intracellular ANG II may induce NHE3 expression and activation in mPCTs via AT(1a)- and AT(2) receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinases ERK 1/2 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways.", 
    "41": "OCT2 is the entry step for organic cation (OC) secretion by renal proximal tubules. Although many drugs inhibit OCT2 activity, neither the mechanistic basis of their inhibition nor their transport status is generally known. Using representatives of several structural classes of OCT2-inhibitory ligands described recently (Kido Y, Matsson P, Giacomini KM. J Med Chem 54: 4548-4558, 2011), we determined the kinetic basis of their inhibition of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP) transport into Chinese hamster ovary cells that stably expressed hOCT2. The \"cluster II\" inhibitors (which contain known OCT2 substrates) metformin and cimetidine interacted competitively with MPP. However, other cluster II compounds, including tetraethylammonium (TEA), diphenidol and phenyltoloxamine, were mixed-type inhibitors of MPP transport (i.e., decreasing J(max) and increasing K(t)). A cluster III (neutral steroid) representative, adrenosterone, and a cluster I (large, flexible cation) representative, carvedilol, displayed noncompetitive inhibitory profiles. Competitive counterflow (CCF) was used to determine whether the inhibitory ligands served as substrates of hOCT2. Carvedilol (cluster I) and adrenosterone (cluster III) did not support CCF, consistent with the prediction that members of these structural classes are likely to be nontransported inhibitors of OCT2. The cluster II representatives MPP, metformin, cimetidine, and TEA all supported CCF, consistent with independent assessments of their OCT2-mediated transport. However, the other cluster II representatives, diphenidol and phenyltoloxamine, failed to support CCF, suggesting that neither compound is transported by OCT2. An independent assessment of diphenidol transport (using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy) confirmed this observation. The results underscore the caution required for development of predictive models of ligand interaction with multidrug transporters.",

Women were assigned to either an exercise group (n = 20) or a control group (n = 20), matched for \u03b2-blockade treatment. They underwent testing at the beginning and at the end of the 12-week study period in three conditions: supine rest, standing, and low-intensity steady state exercise. The exercise group participated in a 12-week, low-intensity walking program, while the control group continued with usual sedentary activity. Compared with the control group, women in the exercise group showed reductions in systolic and diastolic BP and RPP (i.e., the estimated cardiac workload). \u03b2-Blockers increased baroreflex sensitivity and lowered BP and HR in all participants; however, those in the exercise group showed the effects of both treatments: a greater reduction in HR and RPP. The combination of exercise training and \u03b2-blockade produces cardiac and autonomic adaptations that are not observed with either treatment alone, suggesting that \u03b2-blockade enhances the conditioning effects of low-intensity exercise in women with hypertension.",

Despite ongoing research, the clinically most relevant mechanisms causing acute MDMA-induced adverse effects remain largely unclear. This complicates the triage and treatment of MDMA users needing medical care. The user's genetic profile and interactions resulting from polydrug use are key factors that modulate the individual response to MDMA and influence MDMA pharmacokinetics and dynamics, and thus clinical outcome. Polymorphisms in CYP2D6, resulting in poor metabolism status, as well as co-exposure of MDMA with specific substances (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)) can increase MDMA plasma levels, but can also decrease the formation of toxic metabolites and subsequent cellular damage. While pre-exposure to e.g. SSRIs can increase MDMA plasma levels, clinical effects (e.g. blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) can be reduced, possibly due to a pharmacodynamic interaction at the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT). Pretreatment with inhibitors of the dopamine or norepinephrine reuptake transporter (DAT or NET), 5-HT(2A) or \u03b1-\u03b2 adrenergic receptor antagonists or antipsychotics prior to MDMA exposure can also decrease one or more MDMA-induced physiological and/or subjective effects. Carvedilol, ketanserin and haloperidol can reduce multiple MDMA-induced clinical and neurotoxic effects. Thus besides supportive care, i.e. sedation using benzodiazepines, intravenous hydration, aggressive cooling and correction of electrolytes, it is worthwhile to investigate the usefulness of carvedilol, ketanserin and haloperidol in the treatment of MDMA-intoxicated patients.",

Trends towards a greater benefit for women and/or female animals have been observed in some studies for endothelin receptor antagonists, the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the ACE-inhibitor ramipril and the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone. However, reproduction of these results in independent studies and solid statistical evidence is still lacking. Some drugs require a particularly careful dose adaptation in women: the beta-blocker metoprolol, the calcium channel blocker verapamil, loop-, and thiazide diuretics. In conclusion, sex differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have to be taken into account for cardiovascular drug therapy in women.",

    "68": "In the present study, we investigated the involvement of \u03b2-adrenoceptors in the medial amygdaloid nucleus (MeA) in cardiovascular responses evoked in rats submitted to an acute restraint stress. We first pretreated Wistar rats with the nonselective \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol microinjected bilaterally into the MeA (10, 15, and 20 nmol/100 nL) 10 min before exposure to acute restraint. The pretreatment with propranolol did not affect the blood pressure (BP) increase evoked by restraint. However, it increased the tachycardiac response caused by acute restraint when animals were pretreated with a dose of 15 nmol, without a significant effect on the BP response. This result indicates that \u03b2-adrenoceptors in the MeA have an inhibitory influence on restraint-evoked heart rate (HR) changes. Pretreatment with the selective \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (10, 15, and 20 nmol/100 nL) significantly increased the restraint-evoked tachycardiac response after doses of 15 and 20 nmol, an effect that was similar to that observed after the pretreatment with propranolol at a dose of 15 nmol, without a significant effect on the BP response. Pretreatment of the MeA with the selective \u03b2(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712 (10, 15, and 20 nmol/100 nL) caused an opposite effect on the HR response, and a significant decrease in the restraint-evoked tachycardia was observed only after the dose of 20 nmol, without a significant effect on the BP response. Because propranolol is an equipotent antagonist of both \u03b2(1) and \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors, and opposite effects were observed after the treatment with the higher doses of the selective antagonists ICI 118,551 and CGP 20712, the narrow window in the dose-response to propranolol could be explained by a functional antagonism resulting from the simultaneous inhibition of \u03b2(1) and \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors by the treatment with propranolol. The present results suggest that \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors have an inhibitory influence on the restraint-evoked tachycardiac response, whereas \u03b2(1)-adrenoceptors have a facilitatory influence on the restraint-evoked tachycardiac response.",

In this study we investigated the interactions between stress by immobilization and its effect on the persistence of memory, and also a possible effect mediated by \u03b2-adrenergic modulation of stress on memory persistence. An enhancement of long-term memory (LTM) persistence caused by stress through immobilization applied 12 hr after IA training was observed when the animals were submitted to 15 min or 1 hr of IS, but not to 3 hr. The reversal of this memory enhancement caused by IS was observed when the \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist propranolol was infused intraperitoneally prior to stress, which implies that \u03b2-adrenergic receptors are involved in stress enhancement of LTM persistence.", 
    "70": "Neuromodulatory systems such as noradrenaline (NE), acetylcholine (ACh), and serotonin (5HT) serve important functions in sensory perception. We use the olfactory bulb (OB) as a model system to study the roles of individual neuromodulators in sensory perception. Using a spontaneous, nonreward motivated detection task, as well as a reward-motivated task, we show that rats can easily respond to odorants at very low concentrations when motivated to do so in a food-rewarded task, despite not showing spontaneous responses to these low concentration odorants. Using the same tasks paired with local bulbar infusions of noradrenergic and cholinergic drugs, we then show that rats engage their noradrenergic, but not their cholinergic system, to better respond to near threshold odorants. These results suggest that while cholinergic modulation of OB function is mostly important for odor decorrelation and discrimination, noradrenergic modulation is important for signal-to-noise modulation.",

The role of BDNF in proliferation and differentiation of NSCs through Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling was studied via cell culture of cortical NSCs, Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and TOPgal (Wnt reporter) analysis in mice. First, BDNF stimulated NSC proliferation dose dependently in cultured neurospheres that exhibited BrdU incorporation and neuronal and glial differentiation abilities. Second, BDNF effectively enhanced cell commitment to neuronal and oligodendrocytic fates, as indicated by increased differentiation marker Tuj-1 (neuronal marker), CNPase (oligodendrocyte marker), and neuronal process extension. Third, BDNF upregulated expression of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling (Wnt1 and free \u03b2-catenin) molecules. Moreover, these promoting effects were significantly inhibited by application of IWR1, a Wnt signaling-specific blocker in culture. The TOPgal mouse experiment further confirmed BDNF-triggered Wnt signaling activation by \u03b2-gal labeling. Finally, an MEK inhibition experiment showed a mediating role of the microtubule-associated protein kinase pathway in BDNF-triggered Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling cascades.

From 2004 to 2007, 9260 patients received PCI and 692 underwent CABG for this indication. Measures evaluated included prescription of aspirin, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, or lipid-lowering medications; cardiac rehabilitation referral; and smoking-cessation counseling. Composite adherence was lower for CABG than for PCI patients during the period studied (79.6% versus 89.7%, P<0.01). Compared to patients who underwent CABG, patients who underwent PCI were more likely to receive each of the pharmacological therapies. There was no statistical difference in smoking-cessation counseling (91.7% versus 90.3%, P=0.63), and CABG patients were more likely to receive referral for cardiac rehabilitation (70.9% versus 48.3%, P<0.01).

    "99": "The potential role of adrenergic systems in regulating Na(+) uptake in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae was investigated. Treatment with isoproterenol (a generic \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist) stimulated Na(+) uptake, whereas treatment with phenylephrine (an \u03b1(1)-adrenergic receptor agonist) as well as clonidine (an \u03b1(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist) significantly reduced Na(+) uptake, suggesting opposing roles of \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in Na(+) uptake regulation. The increase in Na(+) uptake associated with exposure to acidic water (pH = 4.0) was attenuated in the presence of the nonselective \u03b2-receptor antagonist propranolol or the \u03b2(1)-receptor blocker atenolol; the \u03b2(2)-receptor antagonist ICI-118551 was without effect. The stimulation of Na(+) uptake associated with ion-poor water (32-fold dilution of Ottawa tapwater) was unaffected by \u03b2-receptor blockade. Translational gene knockdown of \u03b2-receptors using antisense oligonucleotide morpholinos was used as a second method to assess the role of adrenergic systems in the regulation of Na(+) uptake. Whereas \u03b2(1)- or \u03b2(2B)-receptor knockdown led to significant decreases in Na(+) uptake during exposure to acidic water, only \u03b2(2A)-receptor morphants failed to increase Na(+) uptake in response to ion-poor water. In support of the pharmacology and knockdown experiments that demonstrated an involvement of \u03b2-adrenergic systems in the control of Na(+) uptake, we showed that the H(+)-ATPase-rich (HR) cell, a subtype of ionocyte known to be a site of Na(+) uptake, is innervated and appears to express \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (propranolol binding sites) at 4 days postfertilization. These data indicate an important role of adrenergic systems in regulating Na(+) uptake in developing zebrafish.", 
    "100": "Despite groundbreaking advances in health care, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, making it one of the most pressing global health issues to face the modern world. In 2002, Wald and Law proposed the concept of the polypill as a potential solution to this global health epidemic. The polypill represents a powerhouse pill that would consist of a combination of several key medications commonly prescribed for CVD prevention, such as a statin, diuretic, beta blocker, or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, in one pill. It was suggested that it could be a novel, tactical measure in the approach to CVD prevention in that it greatly simplifies the healthcare delivery system. Not only does it increase medication compliance for those currently receiving health care, but it also has the potential to access those in underserved healthcare sectors of the world, primarily low- and middle-income countries, which have been identified as areas of highest CVD risk. A major drawback of the polypill is that there are limited data demonstrating its safety and efficacy in the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus far, research shows that the polypill has promise but needs to be approached with a few considerations, such as desired target patient population and formulation. This article will examine the published and ongoing studies associated with the polypill, outline the advantages and disadvantages of using the polypill as a global CVD prevention strategy, and discuss the design and availability of the polypill in the United States.",

    "105": "The aim of the present work was to evaluate drug release and quality of EVA/drug matrices at different PEO 7M concentrations (5 and 15%), manufactured using two different hot-melt extruders: a lab-scale mini extruder and a pilot-scale extruder. The process parameters used on both extruders (temperature and screw speed) and drug release from the matrices were compared. On the lab-scale extruder all formulations were extruded at 90 \u00b0C, whereas on the pilot-scale extruder the temperature of the die was adjusted to 100 \u00b0C in order to achieve a constant pressure at the extrusion die, hence constant material flow through the die to yield smooth extrudates. Screw speed was also adjusted from 60 rpm (lab-scale extruder) to 90 rpm (pilot-scale extruder) in order to obtain a balance between feeding rate and screw speed. Drug release from the obtained matrices on both extruders was also assessed. Despite the differences in diameter (diameter of 2 and 3mm for the lab-scale extruder and pilot-scale extruder, respectively), temperature and screw speed, drug release per surface area was similar. DSC analysis of a formulation [EVA40/MPT (50/50, w/w) with 5% PEO] indicated small changes in its solid state after extrusion on both extruders: drug crystallinity was reduced by max. 20%, PEO recrystallized after cooling and EVA remained semi-crystalline. Extrusion experiments on the pilot-scale extruder of EVA/MPT, 50/50 (w/w) formulations were also monitored in-line using Raman and NIR spectroscopy in order to evaluate the material behavior at a molecular level in the extrusion barrel as function of the process settings (extrusion temperature: 90, 110 and 140 \u00b0C; screw speed: 90 and 110 rpm). At 90 and 110 \u00b0C the crystallinity of the drug was reduced, but the majority of MPT remained in its crystalline state as specific peaks in the Raman spectra of the drug became broader. These differences were accentuated when extrusion was performed at 140 \u00b0C as the drug completely melted. Peak shifts to lower frequencies [(CO) groups of the drug and (CH(3)COO) groups of EVA] were registered at all extrusion temperatures, with maximum effect at 140 \u00b0C indicating molecular interactions. Increasing the screw speed did not result in peak shifts of Raman spectra. NIR confirmed these observations and showed an additional peak in the spectra characteristic of (OH) bounds.", 
    "106": "Atenolol (ATL) is a photostable and hydrolysis resistant beta-blocker and has been frequently detected in natural water. In this study, mechanism on aquatic photodegradation of ATL was investigated with an emphasis on the role of dissolved organic matters (DOMs) as well as other natural water compositions (nitrate, bicarbonate and ferric ions). Significant acceleration of photodegradtion of ATL was observed in the presence of each DOMs added, namely Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA), Suwannee River Humic Acid (SRHA), Nordic Lake Fulvic Acid (NOFA) and Nordic Lake Humic Acid (NOHA). Hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) was determined as the main reactive species in this process, instead of singlet oxygen or excited triplet of DOM. Addition of these four DOMs all inhibited photodegradation of ATL in nitrate solutions through reducing nitrated-derived \u2022OH and screening photons absorbed by nitrate. No loss of ATL was detected in bicarbonate solution with or without DOMs. Bicarbonate exhibited a scavenger of \u2022OH derived from DOMs. However, in the presence of iron species, photodegradation of ATL was significantly enhanced by the addition of each DOM, due to the high yield of \u2022OH in the photoprocess of Fe(III)-DOM complex. The photoproducts distribution of ATL demonstrated that SRFA promote the hydroxylation on aromatic ring in the presence of nitrate and reduce the ketone moiety to alcohol in the system of ferric ions. Our findings indicate that DOMs should be considered in aquatic photoprocesses of organic pollutants induced by themselves as well as other coexisting photoactive water compositions.",

Compression coated tablet was prepared by direct compression method which consisted of metoprolol succinate extended release core tablet and hydrochlorothiazide immediate release coat layer. Barrier coating of Hydroxy Propyl Methyl Cellulose (HPMC) E15LV was applied onto the core tablets to prevent burst release of metoprolol succinate in acidic medium. A 32 full factorial design was employed for optimization of the amount of polymers required to achieve extended release of drug. The percentage drug release at given time Q3, Q6, Q10, Q22; were selected as dependent variables. Core and compression coated tablets were evaluated for pharmaco-technical parameters. In vitro drug release of optimized batch was found to comply with Pharmacopoeial specifications. Desired release of metoprolol succinate was obtained by suitable combination of HPMC having high gelling capacity and polyethylene oxide having quick gelling capacity. The mechanism of release of metoprolol succinate from all batches was anomalous diffusion. Optimised batch was stable at accelerated conditions up to 3 months. Thus, compression coated tablet of metoprolol succinate and hydrochlorothiazide was successfully formulated.",

The biodegradation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the slow sand filter was enhanced from 22% without pre-treatment to 34% by pre-ozonation. In addition, realistic surface water concentrations of most investigated trace organic compounds (TrOCs) including carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, phenazone and metoprolol were reduced below the limits of quantification. Only a few TrOCs, e.g. primidone and benzotriazole, were not efficiently removed in both treatment steps and could be detected regularly in the filter effluent. For these compounds, enhanced treatment, such as advanced oxidation processes, needs to be considered. Testing for genotoxicity and cytotoxicity did not reveal any systematic adverse effects for human health. The formation of the by-product bromate from bromide was below the limit of the German drinking water directive of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L. No removal of bromate was observed in the aerobic slow sand filter. Additional experiments with sand columns showed that operating a preceding bank filtration step to reduce DOC can reduce oxidant demand by approximately 20%.",

Delineating the nanoemulsion regions, the amounts of Capmul MCM (i.e., lipid) and Nikkol HCO 50 (i.e., emulgent) were selected as the critical factors for systematically formulating the optimized S-SNEDDS employing face centered cube design. The optimized formulation (mean globule size: 40.8 nm) indicated marked improvement in drug release profile vis-\u00e0-vis pure drug and marketed formulation. Augmentation in the values of C(max) (134.2%) and AUC (85.2%) indicated significant enhancement in the rate and extent of bioavailability by the S-SNEDDS formulation compared to pure drug. In situ SPIP studies ascribed the significant enhancement in absorptivity parameters of SNEDDS formulations to transport through the lymphatic system and reduced P-gp efflux. Successful establishment of various levels of in vitro/in vivo correlations (IVIVC's) substantiated the judicious choice of the in vitro dissolution milieu for simulating the in vivo conditions. The optimized formulation was found to be quite stable during six months of study period. The current investigations, therefore, report the successful development of systematically optimized S-SNEDDS with enhanced bioavailability potential of carvedilol.",

In 1783 patients, heart rate was controlled by propranolol injection to patients with heart rates of 61 bpm or more. As a result, the scan heart rate (58.8\u00b16.5 bpm) decreased significantly compared with the initial heart rate (72.7\u00b19.4 bpm). Prospective gating method was used by 61.9% including 64.3% of the intravenous \u03b2-blocker injection group.

When we evaluated the image quality of CCTA by the score, the improvement of the score was obviously admitted by 65 bpm or less of the scan heart rate. The ratio of scan heart rate that was controlled by 65 bpm or less was decreased in the initial heart rate groups that were 81 bpm or more. The incidence of adverse reactions by the propranolol injection was few, and these instances only involved slight symptoms. Therefore, heart rate control with the use of \u03b2-blocker is useful for the image quality improvement of CCTA. This form of treatment can be safely enforced.", 
    "153": "Akt/protein kinase B is a well-known cell survival factor and activated by many stimuli including mechanical stretching. Therefore, we evaluated the cardioprotective effect of a brief mechanical stretching of rat hearts and determined whether activation of Akt through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K) is involved in stretch-induced cardioprotection (SIC). Stretch preconditioning reduced infarct size and improved postischemic cardiac function compared to the control group. Phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream substrate, GSK-3\u03b2, was increased by mechanical stretching and completely blocked by wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor. Treatment with lithium or SB216763 (GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors) before ischemia induction mimicked the protective effects of SIC on rat heart. Gadolinium (Gd3(+)), a blocker of stretch-activated ion channels (SACs), inhibited the stretch-induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3\u03b2. Furthermore, SIC was abrogated by wortmannin and Gd3(+). In vivo stretching induced by an aorto-caval shunt increased Akt phosphorylation and reduced myocardial infarction; these effects were diminished by wortmannin and Gd3(+) pretreatment. Our results showed that mechanical stretching can provide cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury. Additionally, the activation of Akt, which might be regulated by SACs and the PI3K pathway, plays an important role in SIC.",

    "155": "The sodium channel blocker mexiletine is considered the first-line drug in myotonic syndromes, a group of muscle disorders characterized by membrane over-excitability. We previously showed that the \u03b2-adrenoceptor modulators, clenbuterol and propranolol, block voltage-gated sodium channels in a manner reminiscent to mexiletine, whereas salbutamol and nadolol do not. We now developed a pharmacological rat model of myotonia congenita to perform in vivo preclinical test of antimyotonic drugs. Myotonia was induced by i.p. injection of 30 mg/kg of anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (9-AC), a muscle chloride channel blocker, and evaluated by measuring the time of righting reflex (TRR). The TRR was prolonged from <0.5 s in control conditions to a maximum of \u223c4 s, thirty minutes after 9-AC injection, then gradually recovered in a few hours. Oral administration of mexiletine twenty minutes after 9-AC injection significantly hampered the TRR prolongation, with an half-maximum efficient dose (ED(50)) of 12 mg/kg. Both propranolol and clenbuterol produced a dose-dependent antimyotonic effect similar to mexiletine, with ED(50) values close to 20 mg/kg. Antimyotonic effects of 40 mg/kg mexiletine and propranolol lasted for 2 h. We also demonstrated, using patch-clamp methods, that both propranolol enantiomers exerted a similar block of skeletal muscle hNav1.4 channels expressed in HEK293 cells. The two enantiomers (15 mg/kg) also showed a similar antimyotonic activity in vivo in the myotonic rat. Among the drugs tested, the R(+)-enantiomer of propranolol may merit further investigation in humans, because it exerts antimyotonic effect in the rat model, while lacking of significant activity on the \u03b2-adrenergic pathway. This study provides a new and useful in vivo preclinical model of myotonia congenita in order to individuate the most promising antimyotonic drugs to be tested in humans.",

The following variables were measured: blood flow rate, peripheral vascular resistance indices at the extra- and intracranial levels, metabolic indices of cerebrovascular responsiveness, and coefficient of variability as an indicator of the cerebrovascular reserve capacity under conditions of antihypertensive treatment. Three antihypertensive therapeutic regimens were employed, viz. lisinopril plus indapamide, bisoprolol plus indapamide, and amlodipine plus indapamide. It was shown that all the three regimen resulted in positive changes in the parameters of blood flow and peripheral vascular resistance. At the same time, the use of amlodipine plus indapamide ensured a more gradual reduction of peripheral vascular resistance and the most pronounced increase of cerebrovascular reserve capacity compared with the two remaining regimens.

It has been reported that BMP levels increase under phospholipidosis induced by cationic amphiphilic drugs. In the present study, the effect of BMP on the binding of propranolol (PRO) to phospholipid liposomes under acidic conditions was investigated. Binding experiments were conducted by high-performance frontal analysis/capillary electrophoresis. PRO showed nonspecific binding to BMP-containing liposomes (BMP:phosphatidylcholine = 1:4), when numbers of bound drug molecules per lipid molecule (r) ranged 0.01-0.06. Total binding affinity increased depending on the BMP content. Binding affinity was decreased by low ionic strength, or by substitution of BMP with diacylglycerol, suggesting that electrostatic interactions were involved. The binding-enhancement effect of BMP was almost equivalent to that of phosphatidylglycerol, and slightly larger than that of phosphatidylserine. An acidic environment (pH 5.0) decreased total binding affinity to BMP-containing liposomes. This could be explained by the pH-partition theory (i.e., the loss in affinity was caused by a decrease in the neutral form of the drug accessible to the membrane core). These results suggest that PRO binding is enhanced by BMP in late endosomes or lysosomes, whereas an acidic environment weakens such binding.", 
    "169": "Granular corneal dystrophy type 2 (GCD2) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by a progressive age-dependent extracellular accumulation of transforming growth factor \u03b2-induced protein (TGFBI). Corneal fibroblasts from GCD2 patients also have progressive degenerative features, but the mechanism underlying this degeneration remains unknown. Here we observed that TGFBI was degraded by autophagy, but not by the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent pathway. We also found that GCD2 homozygous corneal fibroblasts displayed a greater number of fragmented mitochondria. Most notably, mutant TGFBI (mut-TGFBI) extensively colocalized with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3\u03b2 (MAP1LC3B, hereafter referred to as LC3)-enriched cytosolic vesicles and CTSD in primary cultured GCD2 corneal fibroblasts. Levels of LC3-II, a marker of autophagy activation, were significantly increased in GCD2 corneal fibroblasts. Nevertheless, levels of SQSTM1/p62 and of polyubiquitinated protein were also significantly increased in GCD2 corneal fibroblasts compared with wild-type (WT) cells. However, LC3-II levels did not differ significantly between WT and GCD2 cells, as assessed by the presence of bafilomycin A 1, the fusion blocker of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Likewise, bafilomycin A 1 caused a similar change in levels of SQSTM1. Thus, the increase in autophagosomes containing mut-TGFBI may be due to inefficient fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. Rapamycin, an autophagy activator, decreased mut-TGFBI, whereas inhibition of autophagy increased active caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and reduced the viability of GCD2 corneal fibroblasts compared with WT controls. These data suggest that defective autophagy may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of GCD2.",

    "173": "Nipradilol (Nip), which has \u03b11- and \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist and nitric oxide (NO)-donating properties, has clinically been used as an anti-glaucomatous agent in Japan. NO mediates cellular signaling pathways that regulate physiological functions. The major signaling mechanisms mediated by NO are cGMP-dependent signaling and protein S-nitrosylation-dependent signalings. Nip has been described as having neuroprotective effects through cGMP-dependent pathway in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). However, the effect seems to be partial. On the other hand, whether Nip can prevent cell death through S-nitrosylation is not yet clarified. In this study, we therefore focused on the neuroprotective mechanism of Nip through S-nitrosylation. Nip showed a dramatic neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress-induced death of RGC-5 cells. However, denitro-nipradilol, which does not have NO-donating properties, was not protective against oxidative stress. Furthermore, an NO scavenger significantly reversed the protective action of Nip against oxidative stress. In addition, we demonstrated that \u03b11- or \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists (prazosin or timolol) did not show any neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress in RGC-5 cells. We also demonstrated that Nip induced the expression of the NO-dependent antioxidant enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). S-nitrosylation of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein by Nip was shown to contribute to the translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 to the nucleus, and triggered transcriptional activation of HO-1. Furthermore, RGC death and levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE) were increased after optic nerve injury in vivo. Pretreatment with Nip significantly suppressed RGC death and accumulation of 4HNE after injury through an HO-1 activity-dependent mechanism. These data demonstrate a novel neuroprotective action of Nip against oxidative stress-induced RGC death in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "174": "Cationic \u03b2-cyclodextrin derivatives were recently introduced as highly effective, potentially universal blockers of three binary bacterial toxins: anthrax toxin of Bacillus anthracis, C2 toxin of Clostridium botulinum, and iota toxin of Clostridium perfringens. The binary toxins are made of two separate components: the enzymatic A component, which acts on certain intracellular targets, and the binding/translocation B component, which forms oligomeric channels in the target cell membrane. Here we studied the voltage and salt dependence of the rate constants of binding and dissociation reactions of two structurally different \u03b2-cyclodextrins (AmPr\u03b2CD and AMBnT\u03b2CD) in the PA(63), C2IIa, and Ib channels (B components of anthrax, C2, and iota toxins, respectively). With all three channels, the blocker carrying extra hydrophobic aromatic groups on the thio-alkyl linkers of positively charged amino groups, AMBnT\u03b2CD, demonstrated significantly stronger binding compared with AmPr\u03b2CD. This effect is seen as an increased residence time of the blocker in the channels, whereas the time between blockages characterizing the binding reaction on-rate stays practically unchanged. Surprisingly, the voltage sensitivity, expressed as a slope of the logarithm of the blocker residence time as a function of voltage, turned out to be practically the same for all six cases studied, suggesting structural similarities among the three channels. Also, the more-effective AMBnT\u03b2CD blocker shows weaker salt dependence of the binding and dissociation rate constants compared with AmPr\u03b2CD. By estimating the relative contributions of the applied transmembrane field, long-range Coulomb, and salt-concentration-independent, short-range forces, we found that the latter represent the leading interaction, which accounts for the high efficiency of blockage. In a search for the putative groups in the channel lumen that are responsible for the short-range forces, we performed measurements with the F427A mutant of PA(63), which lacks the functionally important phenylalanine clamp. We found that the on-rates of the blockage were virtually conserved, but the residence times and, correspondingly, the binding constants dropped by more than an order of magnitude, which also reduced the difference between the efficiencies of the two blockers.", 
    "175": "We tested whether \u03b2-adrenergic blockade attenuates bone loss and increased marrow adiposity during energy restriction (ER) and whether such an effect is associated with changes in serum leptin and leptin expression in bone and marrow tissues. Female 4-mo-old Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into four groups (n = 10 each): two groups of 40% ER treated with vehicle (ERVEH; saline) or \u03b2-blocker (ERBB; DL-propranolol; 250 \u03bcg \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 h(-1)) during 12 wk, and two groups of ad libitum-fed controls treated with the same two agents (CONVEH, CONBB, respectively). Over 84 days, CONVEH and CONBB rats gained but ERVEH and ERBB rats lost body fat mass; lean mass did not change in any group. Reduction in serum leptin in ERVEH rats was mitigated in ERBB rats (-5.32 vs. -1.15 ng/ml, respectively). The decline in proximal tibia cancellous vBMD observed in ERVEH rats was attenuated in ERBB rats (-85.24 vs. -53.94 mg/cm(3), respectively). Adipocyte number in ERVEH rats was dramatically higher vs. CON rats at week 12, but this increment was abolished by \u03b2-blockade in ERBB animals. The number of osteoblastic cells and marrow adipocytes staining positively for leptin in ERVEH rats tended to be lower vs. that of both CON groups, but \u03b2-blockade appears to reverse this effect in ERBB rats. In summary, \u03b2-adrenergic blockade mitigated metaphyseal bone loss and bone marrow adiposity during energy restriction and attenuated reductions in serum leptin. These data suggest an important role for \u03b2-adrenoreceptor signaling pathway in the cancellous bone and marrow fat response to energy restriction.", 
    "176": "Acetylcholine, and to a lesser extent ATP, mediates neurogenic contractions of bladder smooth muscle. Recently, the urothelium and lamina propria have also been shown to have contractile properties, but the neurotransmitters involved in mediating responses to nerve stimulation have not been investigated. Isolated strips of porcine urothelium with lamina propria were electrically field stimulated and contractions recorded. Drugs interfering with neurotransmission were then employed to identify which neurotransmitters mediated responses. Strips of urothelium/lamina propria developed spontaneous contractions with a frequency of 3.5\u00b10.1 cycles min\u207b\u00b9 and amplitude of 0.84\u00b10.06 g. Electrical field stimulation at 5, 10, and 20 Hz resulted in frequency-related contractions (1.13\u00b10.36 g, 1.59\u00b10.46 g and 2.20\u00b10.53 g, respectively, n=13), and these were reduced in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 \u03bcm) by 77\u00b120% at 5 Hz, 79\u00b17% at 10 Hz and 74\u00b112% at 20 Hz (all P<0.01), indicating they were predominantly neurogenic in nature. Neither the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 \u03bcm), the adrenergic neurone blocker guanethidine (10 \u03bcm) nor desensitization of the purinergic receptors with \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene ATP (10 \u03bcm) affected the contractile amplitude. Similarly, responses were not affected by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NNA (100 \u03bcm) or drugs that interfere with peptide neurotransmission (capsaicin, NK2 antagonist GR159897, protease inhibitors). In conclusion, electrical depolarization of the nerves present in the porcine urothelium/lamina propria results in frequency-dependent contractions, which are predominantly neurogenic in nature. These contractions are resistant to drugs that inhibit the adrenergic, cholinergic and purinergic systems. The neurotransmitter involved in the responses of this tissue is therefore unknown but does not appear to be a peptide.", 
    "177": "The prevalence of heart failure (HF) in the population is increasing, concomitant with high incidence of rehospitalizations and mortality. The aim of this study was to characterize a prognostic risk score model for patients with chronic HF. A total of 500 patients followed at the HF clinic were evaluated by clinical, functional, laboratory, imaging, and therapeutic variables that were correlated to mortality during a follow-up period of 25 months. Risk stratification was carried out by applying a risk score model based on multivariate analysis. Predictors correlated with mortality during follow-up were systolic blood pressure <110 mm Hg, male sex, age older than 70 years, 6-minute walk distance <300 m, lack of \u03b2-blocker therapy, hyperuricemia (>7.5 mg/dL), hyponatremia, and prolonged QTc interval (>450 ms). Based on these variables, a risk score model (score 0-55) was established and included low risk, score <21 (9% mortality during 2-year follow-up); moderate risk, 21 to 29 (22%); high risk, 30 to 35 (35%), and very high risk: \u226536 points (62% 2-year mortality). The risk model had good discrimination ability (concordance index 0.75), which was better than the performance of the Seattle Heart Failure Model on our cohort (0.69). Simple noninvasive characteristics examined during the initial admission to the HF clinic can serve as prognostic markers for mortality and may help in the process of therapeutic decision-making in patients with HF.", 
    "178": "The objective of this retrospective study of patients evaluated between July 2008 and October 2011 in seven pediatric dermatology centers was to combine collective clinical experience using oral propranolol therapy in 32 infants with PHACE syndrome (Posterior fossa [brain malformations present at birth], Hemangioma [usually covering a large area of the skin of the head or neck >5 cm]; Arterial lesions [abnormalities of the blood vessels in the neck or head]; Cardiac abnormalities or aortic coarctation [abnormalities of the heart or blood vessels that are attached to the heart]; Eye abnormalities) with cervical or intracranial arterial anomalies. Patients were given an average daily dose of oral propranolol of 1.8 mg/kg divided two or three times per day for an average duration of 12.3 months. The main outcome measure was adverse neurologic events. Seven (22%) patients were categorized as being at higher risk for stroke, defined on magnetic resonance imaging as severe, long-segment narrowing or nonvisualization of major cerebral or cervical vessels without anatomic evidence of collateral circulation, often in the presence of concomitant cardiovascular comorbidities. Only one patient developed a change in neurologic status during propranolol treatment: mild right hemiparesis that remained static and improved while propranolol was continued. An additional three patients had worsening hemangioma ulceration or tissue necrosis during therapy. This is the largest report thus far of patients with PHACE syndrome treated with propranolol. Although no catastrophic neurologic events occurred, serious complications, particularly severe ulcerations, were seen in a minority of patients, and given the sample size, we cannot exclude the possibility that propranolol could augment the risk of stroke in this population. We propose radiologic criteria that may prove useful in defining PHACE patients as being at high or standard risk for stroke. We continue to advise caution in using systemic beta-blockers, particularly for children with vascular anomalies at higher risk for stroke. Use of the lowest possible dosage, slow dosage titration, three times per day dosing to minimize abrupt changes in blood pressure, and close follow-up, including neurologic consultation as needed, are recommended.", 
    "179": "We previously reported that chronic heart failure (CHF) treatments reduce the duration of hospitalisation, even in elderly patients. The present study aimed to determine whether CHF treatment also provides long-term benefits in terms of reduced mortality at 8 years.", 
    "180": "A cohort of 281 patients who were admitted to a French teaching hospital with a main diagnosis of CHF were followed through the health insurance databases for 1 year and through the national mortality database for 8 years.", 
    "181": "Diuretics (236 patients, 84 %) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (193 patients, 69 %) were the most-frequently prescribed medications. The median duration of survival was 46 months. Mortality rates were significantly lower for patients administered beta-blockers (59 %) and statins (56 %) than for patients not exposed to these drugs (82 %, p\u2009<\u20090.001 and 78 %, p\u2009=\u20090.001 respectively). No significant differences in mortality were observed for spironolactone, diuretics or ACE inhibitors. After adjustment, beta-blocker treatment remained associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality (hazard ratio, HR\u2009=\u20090.54 [0.34-0.84]). After adjustment, the use of two or three CHF drugs was associated with longer survival (HR\u2009=\u20090.53 [0.36-0.77]) than the use of zero or one CHF drug. Statins were also associated with longer survival after adjustment (HR\u2009=\u20090.53 [0.31-0.89]). In patients 75 years of age or older (n\u2009=\u200973), only beta-blocker treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality (HR\u2009=\u20090.31 [0.16-0.63]) in multivariate analysis.", 
    "182": "The use of beta-blockers was associated with better survival rates. The use of statins was also associated with better survival at 8 years. Randomised controlled trials are required to confirm these observations.", 
    "183": "To examine whether self-rated disease-specific and generic quality of life predicts long-term mortality, independent of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, and to explore factors related to low quality of life in a well-defined heart failure (HF) population.", 
    "184": "A cohort of 661 patients (62% male; age 71 years; left ventricular ejection fraction 34%) was followed prospectively for 3 years. Quality of life questionnaires (Ladder of Life, RAND36, and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) and BNP levels were assessed at discharge after a hospital admission for HF. Three-year mortality was 42%. After adjustment for demographic variables, clinical variables, and BNP levels, poor quality of life scores predicted higher mortality; per 10 units on the physical functioning [hazard ratio (HR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.14] and general health (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.16) dimensions of the RAND36. Patients with low scores on these dimensions were more likely to be in New York Heart Association class III-IV, diagnosed with co-morbidities, have suffered longer from HF, have lower estimated glomerular filtration rates, and have fewer beta-blocker prescriptions.",

    "187": "The Jikei Optimal Antihypertensive Treatment (JOINT) study originally evaluated the effect of a fixed-dose formulation of losartan (LOS) (50 mg) plus 12.5 hydrochrolthiazide (HCTZ) for achieving better blood pressure (BP) control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. This study is a sub-analysis of the JOINT study, focusing on the effect of LOS/HCTZ on the uric acid (UA) metabolism.", 
    "188": "Among 228 participants in the JOINT study, a total of 164 patients whose blood and urinary UA specimens were available were included in the present analyses.", 
    "189": "Six months after switching from the prior antihypertensive agent(s) to a single tablet formulation of LOS/HCTZ, the overall serum UA concentration (sUA) increased from 6.0 \u00b1 1.6 mg/dL to 6.2 \u00b1 1.6 mg/dL (p=0.029). The urinary UA/creatinine (Cr) ratio increased from 0.45 +/- 0.21 to 0.50 +/- 0.25 (p=0.014), and the fractional excretion of UA (FEUA) also increased, from 7.1 +/- 3.6 to 7.0 +/- 4.3, p=0.04). Multivariate regression analyses of the basal parameters showed the change in sUA (\u0394UA) to correlate with the basal sUA (\u03b2=-0.483, p<0.001), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (\u03b2=-0.202, p=0.007) and systolic BP (\u03b2=0.147, p=0.038). In addition, the \u0394UA also correlated with the changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (\u0394eGFR) (\u03b2=-0.332, p<0.001). When the patients were classified into two groups depending on their basal sUA, those with a basal sUA \u2265 7 mg/dL exhibited a decrease in their sUA, whereas the rest of those with a sUA <7 mg/dL experienced an increase. Furthermore, patients who had previously been treated with LOS alone had a greater increase in the sUA than those treated with an angiotensin II blocker (ARB) other than LOS alone.", 
    "190": "Antihypertensive therapy with a single tablet formulation of LOS/HCTZ is considered to be a useful option for controlling both BP and sUA, especially in uncontrolled hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia.", 
    "191": "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PCVT) is a rare, congenital ventricular tachyarrhythmia which occurs in the setting of adrenergic activation. It potentially leads to syncope and/or sudden cardiac death (SCD). PCVT represents one of the most dangerous congenital ion channel diseases. Mutations of the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2), the calsequestrin gene (CASQ2), and the triadin gene (TRDN) have been identified as an underlying correlate. \u03b2-Blockers are employed as therapy and are sometimes combined with class IC antiarrhythmic drugs, or calcium antagonists of the verapamil type. ICD implantation is recommended in case of persisting syncope in the presence of \u03b2-blocker therapy or survived SCD. Left thoracic sympathectomy represents a subsidiary interventional therapy for individual cases. In addition, modifications of the patient's lifestyle including avoidance of physical stress and heart rates>\u2009120/min are recommended."
