    "0": "The effect of acutely induced hypoxia, hypercapnic acidosis, and the combination of the two on the amount of acetylstrophanthidin (AS) required to produce cardiac arrhythmias was determined in anesthetized dogs. Each animal was studied during ventilation with room air and again during ventilation with gas mixtures of appropriate concentrations; 24 hr separated the study periods. AS was infused intravenously at a rate of 5 mug/kg per min. Significantly less AS was required to produce arrhythmias during hypoxia and hypercapnic acidosis together than during the period with normal arterial Po(2), Pco(2), and pH (10 animals). Included in this group were two animals which had undergone previous bilateral adrenalectomy and four animals in which heart rate was maintained at the same frequency during both study periods. A significant reduction in the toxic dose of AS also was demonstrated in eight animals, two with constant heart rate, during hypoxia with normal arterial Pco(2) and pH. Hypercapnic acidosis alone (eight animals) did not significantly alter the toxic dose of AS. After the administration of propranolol (six animals) or hexamethionium (six animals), no significant difference was observed between the toxic dose of AS during hypoxia and that during ventilation with room air. Thus although hypoxia and hypercapnic acidosis together do reduce the amount of AS required to produce arrhythmias, it is the hypoxia which exerts the predominant effect on the development of this increased sensitivity to AS. Furthermore, this effect of hypoxia occurs primarily as a result of reflexly augmented sympathetic stimulation of the heart.", 
    "1": "A controlled double-blind study of verapamil in 16 anginal patients used two dose levels-40 mg. t.d.s. and 120 mg. t.d.s.-and was compared with propranolol 100 mg. t.d.s. At the higher dosage verapamil produced a significant improvement in frequency of angina, trinitrin consumption, and exercise tolerance, and had a favourable and significant effect on the amount and duration of ischaemic S-T depression occurring in the electrocardiogram during exercise. In the lower dose verapamil produced significant subjective improvement but no objective benefit in the electrocardiogram. No significant differences were found between the favourable results with the higher dosage of verapamil and propranolol.The action of verapamil is not fully understood, but its favourable effects in angina may be due to a direct action on the myocardium, possibly with accompanying coronary vasodilatation.", 
    "2": "All 757 patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted to the three public hospitals in Auckland during one year were studied. About 7% died from cardiac arrhythmia four days or more after the onset of infarction. These patients had severe infarcts with circulatory failure on or shortly after admission to hospital. Late death from arrhythmia in patients recovering from circulatory failure may in many cases be preventable with anti-arrhythmic drugs."
