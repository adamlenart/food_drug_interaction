    "0": "Of 145 patients with borderline hypertension, 30% had increased resting cardiac index (QI), whereas the remainder had normal values. The specific aim of this study was to investigate cardiac regulation in patients who had normal resting QI. Eighty-five control subjects were used for comparison. At rest, patients with normal QI showed evidence of decreased parasympathetic inhibition; the QI after injection of atropine increased less than in control subjects. After complete cardiac autonomic blockade with propranolol and atropine, QI and stroke volume were significantly lower in patients than in control subjects. The mechanism of this low QI was further analyzed. Central blood volume, which strongly correlates with stroke volume, was used as an estimate of the cardiac venous filling. After blockade, stroke volume was decreased in patients, but central blood volume was normal. Patients also showed a decreased heart rate and QI response to infusion of isoproterenol. It is therefore postulated that two components may be responsible for the low QI in the \"denervated\" heart: patients exhibit a decreased responsiveness to sympathetic stimulation, and they may also be less responsive to venous filling. Behind the facade of cardiac normality in these borderline hypertensive patients with normal cardiac output, there is evidence of altered autonomic control of the heart (decreased vagal inhibition) and of changed cardiac response to sympathetic stimulation and possibly to venous filling.", 
    "1": "The influence of vagal stimulation and/or beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on the heart rate, blood pressure, contractile force, and cardiac rhythm was evaluated in chloralose-anesthetized cats subjected to occlusion of the anterior descending coronary artery. Occlusion performed in 25 control animals produced significant decreases in heart rate (minus 22.9 plus or minus 4.4 beats per minute), blood pressure (minus 19.2 plus or minus 2.4 mm. Hg), and contractile force (minus 21.6 plus or minus 6.3 per cent). Death due to ventricular fibrillation occurred in five out of 25 animals. Coronary occlusion performed in the presence of vagal nerve stimulation resulted in similar decreases in blood pressure, whereas the decreases in contractile force were significantly greater than in control animals. In addition, the time to onset of the arrhythmias occurring in the vagus-stimulated group was increased. Death due to ventricular fibrillation was similar to control animals (i.e., two of seven, or 28 per cent). Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors with propranol (0.75 mg. per kilogram) resulted in the usual decreases in rate, pressure, and force with occlusion but the duration of arrhythmias was shortened. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation was not different from that of the control animals. The combination of propranolol and vagal stimulation also failed to confer protection against ventricular fibrillation. Propranolol was observed to prevent the large decrease in contractile force seen with vagal stimulation. These results suggest that: (1) increasing vagal tone above the level existing after acute myocardial infarction does not decrease mortality, (2) propranolol pretreatment does not affect the incidence of ventricular fibrillation induced by coronary occlusion, (3) the duration of the arrhythmia after coronary occlusion is effectively shortened with propranolol, and (4) cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors do not appear to be involved in the decreases in heart rate, blood pressure, and contractile force seen with coronary occlusion.", 
    "2": "Ten members of one family had hemiplegic migraine. The typical attack was sterotyped from member to member. Three of the 10 members had hemiplegic migraine attacks associated with minor head trauma. One patient suffered premanent neurologic deficit. Therapy of hemiplegic mirgaine is briefly discussed.", 
    "3": "Catecholamine stimulation of adenyl cyclase activity associated with bovine subcellular fractions enriched in plasma membranes is described. The relative potencies of isoproterenol (IPNA), epinephrine (E), and norepinephrine (NE) were 4.7:1.0:0.02, which is characteristic for a beta-adrenergic receptor system. Stimulation with IPNA (5 times 10- minus 6 M) was inhibited by propranolol. The inhibition was stereospecific for the L-isomer of propranolol and a concentration as low as 2 times 10- minus 8 M was required to effect 50% inhibition. Both these observations, and the competitive kinetics of inhibition which applied to the system, confirmed the classification of a beta-adrenergic receptor system. Phentolamine, an alpha-antagonist, also inhibited IPNA stimulation, although high doses (5 times 10- minus M) were required to cause total inhibition. Inhibition was also observed with quinidine (1 mM) and lignocaine (10- minus 2 M).", 
    "4": "Pindolol, a strong beta-adrenergic blocking agent, instilled into the conjunctival sac of normal and glaucomatous eyes, produced a significant drop in intraocular pressure. This was not, at first, accompanied by any variation in outflow facility; only after prolonged treatment did an increase in facility appear, which accounted only for one-third of the tension-lowering effect. The drug was well tolerated, and did not affect either pupil motility or corneal sensitivity. It seems suitable for a trial use in the treatment of glaucoma.", 
    "5": "The antihypertensive effect of practolol, a beta-1-blocker, alone and in combination with a beta-2-stimulating drug, salbutamol, has been studied in a double-blind cross-over trial on 19 patients. Practolol treatment induced a significant BP reduction, while the addition of salbutamol failed to give any further decrease.", 
    "6": "In a clinical study comparing the cardiocirculatroy effects of intravenous tolamolol to those of propranolol, tolamolol, 16 mg, induced similar reduction in resting heart rate as 8 mg propranolol in 16 coronary patients. Tolamolol did not disturb cardiac pump performance and exerted less negative inotropic action than propranolol as assessed by mechanical contractility indices. Myocardial beta-one chronotropic and inotropic stimulation by exogenous epinephrine was blocked equally by tolamolol and propranolol. Tolamolol exerted less systemic vascular beta-two blockade than propranolol as assessed by the peripheral resistance and vasopressor responses to epinephrine infusion. Tolamolction than propranolol and is thereby suitable for careful extension of beta blockade therapy to certain patients with pulmonary and ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "7": "The effect of propranolol therapy on the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and plasma renin activity (PRA) was studied in three groups of hypertensive patients who were also treated with saliuretics. Group A: In 14 patients with essential hypertension on chlorthalidone treatment, an additional daily dose of 640 mg propranolol for two months led to a significant reduction of the MAP (from 124 to 105 mm Hg) and PRA (from 5.3 to 2.0 ng AI/ml/hr standing). There was no correlation between MAP reduction and either the original levels or change in PRA. Group B: In 14 patients with essential hypertension and 5 with renal artery stenosis studied on a fixed salt intake, the plasma and extracellular volumes, PRA, and blood pressures were recorded before and after three days of diuretic induced salt depletion and, with maintenance of the depleted state, after three days of propranolol. Salt depletion resulted in a decrease in MAP from 132 to 128 mm Hg (NS), and PRA increased from 3.4 to 22.3 ng AI/ml/hr (P less than 0.01). There was no correlation between change in MAP and PRA control values, PRA change, or any of the volume parameters. Addition of propranolol was followed by a rapid MAP decrease to 111 mm Hg (P less than 0.01), and the PRA dropped to a mean of 8.5 (P less than 0.01). No correlation was found between change in MAP and change in PRA. The patients with renal artery stenosis did not differ in their reactions from those with essential hypertension. Group C: In five patients with moderate renal failure and normal to expanded 82-Br distribution volume, propranolol lowered MAP by 10% and lowered the PRA in all five. Salt depletion by furosemide to 82-Br volumes below normal resulted in a 10% decrease of MAP and a marked rise in PRA. In this state propranolol was followed by a further MAP reduction of 18% and a decrease in PRA. There was no quantitative relationship between MAP and PRA change during either of the treatment regimes. It is concluded that in various forms of hypertension, the blood pressure can be effectively lowered by combining diuretics and propranolol regardless of the pretreatment PRA level.", 
    "8": "1. The role of adrenergic neuronal mechanisms in the development of early hypertension in man and the spontaneously hypertensive rat has been explored. 2. In both, a hyperkinetic circulatory state is associated with reduced parasympathetic and increased adrenergic cardiac influences. 3. Spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive control rats were treated with propranolol from conception until 12 weeks. Although heart rate and output remained reduced, there was no difference in growth or elaboration of pressure with respect to their untreated controls. 4. After another series of spontaneously hypertensive and control rats received cardiac autonomic blockade (atropine and timolol), they sequentially received alpha-adrenergic blockade (phenoxybenzamine), ganglionic blockade (trimethaphan) and smooth-muscle vasodilatation (hydralazine). These studies revealed only a small pressure differential between the two groups before hydralazine and still less thereafter; unlike the control rats, pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats fell markedly after ganglionic blockade as a result of reduced output, indicating greater adrenergic control mediated through venoconstriction. 5. These findings indicate: increased cardiovascular adrenergic control in young spontaneously hypertensive rats, the hyperkinetic circulation merely reflecting one aspect of increased total cardiovascular input. Structural alterations seem to participate minimally. 6. These experimental observations closely, resemble findings in early hypertensive man, and it is suggested that altered total cardiovascular adrenergic input is responsible for the elaboration, development, and maintenance of essential hypertension in man.", 
    "9": "1. The effect of propranolol and sotalol on renin secretion was studied in the anaesthetized dog. 2. beta-adrenergic blockade did not modify basal renin secretion and did not affect the rise of renin secretion induced by haemorrhage or aortic constriction. 3. beta-adrenergic blockade diminished the rise in renin secretion induced by stimulation of the renal nerves.", 
    "10": "1. The effect of propranolol on total and regional renal blood flow was measured in conscious rabbits after 6 days on normal or low sodium diets. 2. Propranolol inhibited the fall in total superficial cortical renal blood flow which occurred in response to the low sodium diet but did not influence renal blood flow in rabbits on a normal sodium diet. 3. Reduction and redistribution of renal blood flow in response to a low sodium diet appears to be mediated by a beta-receptor mechanism and may be a consequence of intrarenal release of renin.", 
    "11": "1. In patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension, oral propranolol, given in incremental doses, produced a moderate but significant lowering of blood pressure which was correlated with the concentration of propranolol in plasma. 2. Propranolol also reduced plasma renin activity (PRA) in the supine posture, on standing and after intravenous frusemide. However, 'supine' and 'frusemide' PRA values were markedly reduced at a plasma concentration of propranolol that had little effect on blood pressure. 3. On administration of propranolol there was little correlation between blood pressure decrease and PRA suppression, and even less between pretreatment PRA values and hypotensive response. 4. It is concluded that in patients with mild and moderate hypertension and low or normal plasma renin activity, suppression of PRA is not an important determinant of the hypotensive response to propranolol.", 
    "12": "The inhalation of textile dusts causes bronchoconstriction in textile workers and in healthy experimental subjects. The airway responses to these dusts are potentiated by propranolol and inhibited by an antihistamine drug and by ascorbic acid. Administration of 20 mg disodium cromoglycate by spinhaler 30 minutes prior to challenge with hemp dust or hemp dust extract protected a small number of subjects against the airway constrictor effect, mostly those with a large acute reduction in flow rates. Textile dust extracts contain a histamine-releasing agent, which explains their airway constrictor effect. This agent is a highly water-soluble, heat-stable, low-molecular-weight compound which has not yet been chemically identified. In the prevention and control of byssinosis, the administration of drugs such as ascorbic acid or disodium cromoglycate should be considered in addition to engineering methods.", 
    "13": "Seventeen patients received placebo medication during a 12-week run-in period, followed by four double-blind study periods of six weeks each, during which time placebo, 80 mg, 160 mg and 320 mg propranolol dosages were administered. Examination of the frequency of angina episodes and nonprophylactic nitroglycerin consumption revealed significant beneficial clinical responses for both the 160 and 320 mg dosages. Exercise testing also demonstrated increased exercise tolerance (320 mg dose) with a shift of the exercise end point from pain to fatigue in seven of 17 patients. The interrelationships between propranolol daily dosage, clinical response assessed by percent reduction in anginal episodes, beta-adrenergic blockade measured by percent reduction in exercise heart rate and serum levels were examined. In general, serum levels of 30 ng/ml, when drawn 90 to 180 minutes following the last oral dose, were required to achieve a 25% or greater reduction in angina frequency. Serum levels above 30 ng/ml were similarly correlated with a 20% or greater reduction in exercise heart rate at equivalent levels of exercise. Detailed examination of different patterns of clinical response with respect to beta-blockade, serum levels and oral doses are presented.", 
    "14": "1. Intravenous administration of compound AH 5158, which possesses alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking properties, produces haemodynamic effects similar to those seen from the combined effects of propranolol and hydrallazine. 2. Chronic oral administration has demonstrated that compound AH 5158 is an effective hypotensive agent capable of controlling the blood pressure in patients previously requiring large doses of drugs such as methyldopa. Some postural and exercise hypotension may be seen with larger doses.", 
    "15": "1. Catecholamine plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were measured together with plasma renin activity in ten patients with essential hypertension and in five normal control subjects before and after a frusemide challenge. 2. The same procedure was repeated in the same subjects 3--4 days later after pretreatment with oxprenolol. 3. Noradrenaline plasma concentrations and urinary excretion increased significantly after frusemide in all cases, returning to normal values at 30 and 60 min. Adrenaline plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were unchanged. 4. Plasma renin activity increased significantly in seven patients with hypertension and normal renin basal values, remaining unchanged in three hypertensive patients with low-renin basal values. 5. Oxprenolol suppressed the response of noradrenaline and plasma renin activity to frusemide in all cases.", 
    "16": "1. Prindolol and propranolol chronically cause a fall in mean blood pressure and mean plasma renin activity, but no correlation was observed between the two variables. 2. The response of blood pressure to prindolol and propranolol was not predicted by the basal plasma renin activity. 3. Propranolol administered acutely caused the plasma renin activity to fall with no acute change in blood pressure, whereas prindolol caused the blood pressure to fall with no change in plasma renin activity. 4. The effects of beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs on plasma renin activity and blood pressure can be dissociated and it is unlikely that their hypotensive action is mediated through the renin-angiotensin system. 5. Basal plasma renin activity does not identify the patients who will respond to beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs.", 
    "17": "1. Propranolol was given to eight haemodialysed patients with resistant arterial hypertension for periods ranging from 6 to 16 months. 2. The treatment brought about an excellent control of blood pressure in all cases. 3. After withdrawal of propranolol plasma renin activity rose on average 40% compared with the value obtained during treatment. However, no significant relationship was found between the change in plasma renin activity and the change in the diastolic blood pressure. 4. Stopping propranolol resulted in a prompt rebound of arterial pressure toward pretreatment values. However, hypertension was always controlled on resuming drug treatment. 5. The results show that this form of hypertension can be controlled on a long-term basis with propranolol. However, the effect on blood pressure seems not to be mediated by suppression of renin secretion.", 
    "18": "1. The effects of propranolol and RO3-4787, a new beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with a partial agonist activity, have been studied in a blind, cross-over comparison with placebo. 2. In ten patients who completed the study, the two drugs produced a similar reduction in blood pressure; the reduction in heart rate with propranolol was significantly (P less than 0.001) greater than that produced by RO3-4787. 3. Plasma renin activity averaged 4.13 +/- 1.37 ng h-1 ml-1 on placebo, fell to 3.64 +/- 1.47 ng h-1 ml-1 on propranolol and to 2.50 +/- 1.39 ng h-1 ml-1 on RO3-4787. 4. No correlation was demonstrable between the log plasma concentration of either propranolol or RO3-4787 and change in blood pressure.", 
    "19": "1. Postural changes of plasma renin activity (PRA) before and after the administration of a beta-blocking agent (oxprenolol) were studied in nine patients with renal homotransplantation and in ten normal subjects. 2. In normal subjects PRA always increased during upright posture without any correlation with postural changes in mean arterial pressure. Oxprenolol reduced the postural increase of PRA. 3. A postural increase of PRA could be detected as early as 20--25 days after renal transplantation, and appeared with increasing frequency as time elapsed. 4. There was a significant inverse correlation (r = -0.794, P less than 0.001) between the postural changes of PRA and those of mean arterial pressure. 5. These results suggest that in patients with renal homotransplantation the postural increase of PRA can only partly be due to circulating catecholamines or the sympathetic nervous system and may be explained by inverse changes in the mean arterial pressure.", 
    "20": "The clinical course of the ischaemic heart disease was studied and compared with the ECG indices at rest, and under exercises, and with the data of selective coronary angiography in 189 patients. Three stages of decompensation of the coronary reserve were revealed. The efficiency of drug therapy and the indications for surgical management were studied with reference to the state of the coronary reserve.", 
    "21": "Atenolol (Tenormin or I.C.I. 66082) is a new beta-adrenergic blocking drug, unique in being cardio-selective and in having no intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane activity. In a controlled double-blind study, a single 50 mg oral dose produced a significant fall in ocular tension for about 7 hours in five patients with definite or suspected glaucoma. The average maximum fall was 35 per cent of the initial pressure; it occurred at 5 hours after oral ingestion. Accordingly neither intrinsic sympathomimetic nor membrane activity can account for all the ocular hypotensive effect of beta blockers in humans. The practical implications for treatment of glaucoma require longer-term investigations some of which are in progress.", 
    "22": "Injection of dogs with 50 mg/kg of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) caused large increases in blood pressure and heart rate, followed after 1 or 2 hr by severe hypotension. Prior administration of the adrenergic receptor blocking agents phentolamine and propranolol attenuated both the hyper- and hypotensive phases of 6-OHDA. Phentolamine and propranolol did not prevent depletionof norepinephrine or development of the characteristic morphological changes induced in adrenergic fibers by 6-OHDA.", 
    "23": "Hydrochlorothiazide, administered at 1, 3 and 9 mg/kg/day p.o. for 4 days, produced a dose-dependent lowering of plasma potassium and an elevation in plasma renin activity in unanesthetized dogs. When plasma renin activity was suppressed in diuretic-treated dogs by the potent beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking drug, timolol (0.5, 2 mg/kg/day p.o. for 4 days), the hypokalemia and hyperreninemia were significantly less pronounced. The data suggest that beta-adrenergic blocking drugs can be used to antagonize these side effects of diuretics.", 
    "24": "The effects of racemic propranolol and its constituent isomers were studied on ganglionic stimulation produced in situ by close arterial injection of 5-HT and DMPP to the superior cervical ganglion. Ganglion stimulation was recorded in terms of the resultant contraction of the nictitating membrane. d,l-Propranolol caused a biphasic antagonism of the ganglion stimulant effect of 5-HT. At low doses, 0.5-10 mug, the antagonism was surmountable by increasing the amount of 5-HT. The l-isomer (0.2-4 mug) but not d-propranolol also caused antagonism. At higher doses, 0.1-5 mg, both d,l- and d-propranolol caused a second type of blockade of 5-HT which was not surmountable and resembled that seen with procaine. The ganglion stimulant effects of DMPP and acetylcholine were only antagonised by the higher doses of d- and d,l-propranolol. d,l-Propranolol did not reduce the direct stimulation by 5-HT on the muscle of the nictitating membrane.", 
    "25": "Treatment of angina pectoris falls within two spheres: (1) increasing myocardial blood flow (direct bypass, vasodilators), or (2) reducing oxygen demand (beta blockade, propranolol). If the latter depresses the stimulus for collateralization without improving input, its use in certain forms of coronary disease may require reconsideration. To examine this hypothesis, 25 dogs (four groups) were evaluated by surface mapping, angiographic collateral mapping, and hemodynamic studies including cardiac output, systemic and coronary pressures, coronary flow, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, pressure to time (LVdp/dt). Collateralization was induced with ameroid constrictor placement in Groups I, III, and IV. Groups II and III received immediate propranolol treatment (3 to 5 mg. per kilogram per day for 6 weeks); Group IV received delayed treatment (4 weeks after constriction); and Group I received no propranolol (constrictor alone). Collateral formation was depressed significantly in the acutely beta-blockaded dogs (Group III) by surface and angiographic mapping and by hemodynamic evidence of depressed coronary flow and altered coronary retrograde pressures. Alterations in established collaterals (Group IV) were not consistent. These data suggest that pharmacological reduction of myocardial oxygen demand reduces coronary collateralization experimentally, requiring further evaluation of its usage in multivessel coronary disease to the exclusion of direct bypass.", 
    "26": "Methods are described for the gas chromatographic determination of the B-adrenoceptor blocking agent atenolol (ICI 66,082 Tenormin) in whole blood, serum, tissue and urine. The method involves the extraction of the free base from the prepared biological sample into an organic solvent mixture. Further purification is done by backextracting the base into dilute acid from which, after basification it is extracted again into organic solvent. Any atenolol in the residue remaining after solvent evaporation is converted into a heptafluorobutyrate derivative ready for gas chromatography. Use of an electron-capture detector enables concentrations as low as 0.01 mug ml-minus 1 body fluid and 0.04 mug ml-minus 1 tissue to be measured.", 
    "27": "Beta-Adrenoceptor activity of rabbit oviductal isthmus has been determined quantitatively in vitro in tissues isolated 24 and 72 hours after human chorionic gonadotropin injection and after two hormonal treatments known to accelerate (progesterone) and retard (estrogen) ovum transport. Under conditions in which ova are located at the ampullary-isthmic junction and distal isthmus, the isthmus demonstrates a low incidence of spontaneous activity in vitro, poor response to acetylcholine, low affinity of beta-adrenoceptors for isoproterenol, and low efficacy of isoproterenol to inhibit acetylcholine-induced contractions. Under conditions in which ova are passing into the uterus, the isthmus shows the converse of these parameters. These data support the hypotheses that the oviductal isthmus functions as an adrenergic sphincter and that the actions of progesterone and estrogen in altering ovum transport rates are at least partially mediated through changes in adrenoceptors.", 
    "28": "The purpose of this investigation was to develop a system for studying the effects of dopamine on isolated blood vessels. Canine renal, mesenteric, and small femoral arteries (less than 1 mm outside diameter) were exposed to phenoxybenzamine 10-5 M for one hour and contracted with prostaglandin F2-alpha. Cumulative concentrations of dopamine ranging from 10-6 to 10-4 M caused dose-related relaxation of the arteries. Propranolol 10-6 M did not affect the relaxation in concentrations which markedly antagonized the effects of isoproterenol. Large femoral arteries (greater than 1 mm outside diameter) did not relax with similar concentrations of dopamine. N-methyldopamine (epinine) produced similar relaxation; 3-methoxytyramine was inactive. Specific antagonism could not be demonstrated by the postulated dopamine antagonists-haloperidol, chlorpromazine, apomorphine, or bulbocapnine-in concentrations up to 10-5 M. Higher concentration of these agents could not be used because they caused the arteries to relax. This study demonstrated that PGF2-alpha-contracted arteries pretreated with phenoxybenzamine are suitable for further investigations of putative dopamine agonists and antagonists.", 
    "29": "Studies were carried out in 69 patients with essential hypertension to examine the relationship between changes in plasma renin activity (PRA) and arterial pressure (BP) in response to a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol. PRA had no consistent relationship with BP during treatment, either in patients receiving propranolol alone (r = 0.12) or in those receiving a combination of diuretics and propranolol (r = 0.18). Furthermore, long-term beta-adrenergic blockade failed to inhibit increases of PRA induced by diuretics or rapid sodium depletion. These results indicate that (1) beta-adrenergic blockade can reduce BP by mechanisms other than PRA suppression; and (2) the beta-adrenergic nervous system is important, but not essential, for renin release.", 
    "30": "Extensive clinical experience indicates that cardioversion is the most effective method now available for terminating cardiac tachyarrhythmias. This procedure is not accompanied by depression of myocardial contractility, conductivity, or excitability, a common sequel to the use of antiarrhythmic drugs. Furthermore, the incidence of complications with cardioversion is low. These features of effectiveness, safety, and simplicity permit cardioversion to be used by the noncardiologist physician, who may be less experienced than a cardiologist in recognizing arrrhythmias. Cardioversion has not reduced the need for antiarrhythmic agents; on the contrary, more such drugs are required to maintain normal sinus rhythm. The problem at present is not the terminating a tachyarrhythmia but in preventing its recurrence.", 
    "31": "When epidermis from the uninvolved skin of psoriatic patients was incubated for 5 min in Hank's medium containing adrenaline and theophylline, the cyclic AMP level consistently increased 20-30 times over the level observed when adrenaline was not added to the medium. On the other hand, when epidermis from the involved skin of psoriatic patients was incubated under the same experimental conditions, the cyclic AMP level increased only 2-5 times. Even when theophylline, and inhibitor of specific cyclic AMP-phosphodiesterase, was omitted from the medium, a clearly demonstrable difference in sensitivity to adrenaline was evident in normal appearing and lesional psoriatic epidermis. These results indicate a faulty adenyl cyclase system in the involved epidermis of psoriatic lesions rather than a defective degradation process by the specific phosphodiesterase. Since the Km for adrenaline activation of adenyl cyclase was approximately the same in both the uninvolved and the involved epidermis and since the cyclic AMP increase by adrenaline was abolished by the addition of propranolol, the basic nature of the beta-receptor (specifically the binding affinity to adrenaline) in the involved epidermis does not appear to be defective. On the other hand, the finding that the Vmax for adrenaline activation is 10-20 times higher in the uninvolved than in the involved epidermis suggests that the poor response in the involved epidermis may be due to fewer available binding sites for adrenaline in the psoriatic lesion.", 
    "32": "The effect of intravenous epinephrine on heart glycogen synthase and phosphorylase systems in control and insulin-pretreated rats was studied. The percent of synthase in the I form decreased rapidly after epinephrine treatment but the change was small and sometimes not significant. In insulin-pretreated rats in which the percent synthase I was increased, epinephrine produced a definate and highly significant decrease. There was a simultaneous increase in percent phosphorylase a in both groups. The synthase and phosphorylase responses were statiscally significant at 2.5 mug epinephrine/kgor more. These data are compatible with a mechanism in which protein kinase is activated by an increased cAMP concentration and affects both the synthase and phosphorylasesystems simultaneously. Propranolol blocked the epinephrine effects on cAMP, synthase I, and phosphorylase a. Although insulin had little effect on the response ofthe synthase and phosphorylase systems to epinephrine, it nealry completely blocked glycogen degradation. The mechanism is unknown, but it appears to be due to an inhibition of phosphorylase a catalytic activity in vivo. Acetylcholine had no effect on synthase I, phosphorylase a, or cAMP in control or in insulin-pretreated animals.", 
    "33": "When isolated superfused cat mesentric arterial rings were exposed to norepinephrine(NE) 10'-6 g/ml, force initially increased but subsequently declined despite continuedadministration of NE. Phasic contractions occurred in 48% of the vessels. Norepinephrine concentrations just above threshold induced tonic contractions without escape. When NE was administered after brief exposure of the arterial rings to low-calcium solutions, peak force development and escape were both reduced and phasic contractions were abolished. Escape did not occur in potassium-depolarized vessels. The peak response was increased and escape was reduced by substituting sodium in the Krebs solution by lithium and by substituting chloride with iodide or perchlorate. Substitution of chloride by isethionate reduced the peak NE resonse and abolished escape. Propanolol was without effect. It is suggested that escape from NE vasoconstriction in mesenteric arteries is due to fading of propagated activity.", 
    "34": "An insulinoma was diagnosed in a fifty-seven-year-old woman suffering from frequent hypoglycemic attacks. Propranolol--a beta-adrenergic blocker--in a dose of 80 mg. per day effectively prevented recurrent hypoglycemic attacks. It also corrected the basal hyperinsulinemia as well as the increased insulin secretion which results from stimulation with glucose or arginine.", 
    "35": "Lergotrile mesylate (2-chloro-6-methylergoline-8beta-acetonitrile, methane-sulphate salt) was shown to be a potent inhibitor of prolactin secretion in vivo and in vitro. The dopamine receptor blocker, pimozide, was able to reverse the inhibitory effect of lergotrile mesylate (LM) on prolactin release from rat pituitaries in vitro. Alpha-adrenergic or beta-adrenergic receptor blockers were unable to antogonize the action of LM on prolactin release. These findings indicate that ergolines such as LM inhibit prolactin release from pituitaries by activating an adenohypophyseal dopamine receptor. LM is currently undergoing clinical trial as a prolactin inhibitor and a dopamine agonist.", 
    "36": "The effect of sodium depletion on plasma renin activity (PRA), urinary cyclic AMP and urinary aldosterone excretion was studied in hypoparathyroid patients whose basal urinary cylic AMP excretion (urinary cAMP) was less than 50% of that observed in normal subjects. During 7 days of sodium depletion, PRA, urinary aldosterone and urinary cAMP each rose significantly. Administration of the beta-blocker propranolol, 160 mg/day, during 5 further days of sodium depletion produced a fall in PRA and urinary cAMP, but no change in urinary aldosterone excretion. The dissociation in these effects suggests that the increase in aldosterone secretion during sodium depletion may be mediated by pathways other than the renin-angiotensin and adenyl cyclase systems. There was a high degree of correlation between PRA and urinary cAMP (P less than 0.001) during the period of sodium depletion, but not significant relationship between these parameters was found during control and propranolol phases, or in control studies in normal subjects. These findings suggest that beta-adrenergic receptors have a role in mediating the effects of sodium depletion upon renin secretion and adenyl cyclase activity.", 
    "37": "Propranolol (1 mM) was found to inhibit TSH stimulation of adenyl cyclase activity in a subcellular fraction from bovine thyroid enriched in plasma membranes. However, stimulation due to PGE1 or NaF was not similarly inhibited. Since (i) and inhibition was observed at concentrations of propranolol between 10-minus 4 and 10- minus 3M, and appeared to be noncompetitive (ii) the optical isomers of propranolol were equipotent, (iii) inhibition was specific for propranolol since it was not observed with the closely related drug practolol (1 mM), and (iv) quinidine (1 mM) and the local anaesthetics lignocaine and aptocaine also proved inhibitory, we concluded that propranolol inhibition of TSH stimulation was due to its \"quinidine-like\" properties (i.e., relatively specific and characteristic membrane-active properties) and not to its action as a beta-adrenergic antagonist.", 
    "38": "Insulin has been shown to lower cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in hormonally sensitive tissue. The mechanism by which this lowering occurs has not yet been fully defined. We studied the effects of insulin on rat adipose tissue cyclic nucleotide phosphodiestrase (PDE) in an incubation system. The adipose tissue used was from both normal animals and animals rendered diabetic by intravenous injections of streptozotocin. Rat epididymal fat pads were incubated in a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate-4% albumin system with O, 100, 1,000 or 10,000 PU/ml insulin (INS); epinephrine (EPI) or glucagon (GLU) at several different concentrations. After 15 min of incubation, each tissue was homogenized, centrifugated, and the supernatant assayed for cAMP PDE activity using the breakdown of (3-H)cAMP. The data was used to characterize cAMP PDE into apparent high and low K-m PDE components. In the normal animals, INS increased Vmax of the low Km PDE components; 100 pU/ml INS, 30%, 1000 p1/ML INS, 40; and 10,000 pU/ml INS, 20%. In contrast, streptoxotocin diabetes lowered this Vmax by 30%. In the diabetic animals, INS also increased Vmax by 30%. In the diabetic animals, INS also increased Vmax of the low Km PDE component; 100 pU/ml INS, 30%; 1000 pU/ml INS, 50% and 10,000 pU/ml INS, 100%. Epinephrine at 1, 10, and 100 pg/ml stimulated low Km cAMP PDE activity by 67%, 73% and 44% respectively. The stimulatory effect of EPI on both the low and high Km cAMP PDE activity was neutralized by propranolol or adenosine. In comparison to EPI, GLU at very low concentrations, 10-9M, stimulated low Km cAMP PDE. These studies suggest that some of the biologic actions of insulin, an antilipolytic substance, are mediated through activation of low Km PDE. Furthermore, this enzymatic activity is lower in experimental diabetes. The stimulation of low Km PDE by lipolytic hormones may reflect a long-range protective action of these agents.", 
    "39": "Twelve patients with PVC's were studied to assess the possible role of the vagus nerves in suppressing PVC's. All were without significant heart disease and under forty years of age. A series of five autonomically active drugs, including vagotonic and vagolytic agents, was administered intravenously, each drug being given after the effects of the previous one had abated. Two of the patients did not have PVC's at the time of study. Of the remaining ten patients, five showed vagally mediated suppression of PVC's. Phenylephrine (40 to 60 mug per minute) reduced HR, from an average of 63.2 bpm to 48.5 bpm by a vagally mediated reflex, and decreased PVC incidence in all five patients. The per cent of ventricular heart beats which were PVC's (per cent PVC) decreased from an average of 18.2 per cent to 3.2 per cent in these patients (p smaller than 0.005 in each case). Edrophonium (10 mg.) produced less bradycardia and less reliable PVC suppression. In two of these five patients, atropine (1.5 mg.) increased PVC incidence markedly, although the per cent PVC did not change significantly because of the concomitant tachycardia. These data suggest that strongly increased vagal tone can suppress PVC's in a significant percentage of such patients. This finding in man extends previous animal work which has shown a protective role of the vagus against ventricular arrhythmias under certain conditions.", 
    "40": "1. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and mean blood pressure were studied in conscious rabbits infused with beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists. 2. Oxprenolol and DL-propranolol each significantly reduced PRA and blood pressure, but prindolol, which had a strong blood pressure-lowering effect, increased PRA. 3. When prindolol was given to animals in which PRA and blood pressure had been reduced by DL-propranolol, PRA returned to control values but blood pressure remained low. Thus the increase in PRA caused by prindolol is not mediated by hypotension. These findings, together with the observation that compound H35/25 reduced PRA without altering blood pressure, suggest that the effects of the beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs on blood pressure are unrelated to their effects on renin release. 4. Studies with D-propranolol and with blocking agents with either beta-1 or beta-2 specificity indicated that the effects of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade on renin are directly dependent upon their action on beta-adrenergic receptors, probably of the beta-2 type.", 
    "41": "1. DL-Propranolol, L-propranolol, DL-alprenolol, pindolol (LB46), practolol, ICI 66082, sotalol and oxprenolol all produced prolonged falls in blood pressure and heart rate after intracerebroventricular administration in conscious normotensive cats. 2. Transient initial pressor responses and tachycardias were observed after intracerebroventricular infusions of all the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists used, except ICI 66082. 3. D-Propranolol, D-alphrenolol, procaine and lignocaine all produced initial increases in blood pressure and heart rate but did not subsequently cause any reduction in either blood pressure or heart rate. 4. The time of maximum hypotension and bradycardia after intracerebroventricular infusion of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists coincided with the maximum inhibition of the centrally mediated tachycardia observed after intracerebroventricular isoprenaline.", 
    "42": "1. In seventeen patients with untreated essential hypertension the sodium and water contents of leucocytes were significantly increased, whereas the rate constant for ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux was significantly reduced. 2. These abnormalities were not found in fourteen other patients with well-controlled hypertension. 3. Preliminary observations in accelerated hypertension suggest a different pattern of abnormality in leucocyte sodium metabolism.", 
    "43": "Anxiety is an unpleasant, diffuse emotion, directed towards the future and associated with feelings of threat to the individual. Clinical anxiety occurs when a patient suffers from anxiety which is more frequent, more severe or more persistent than he is used to and can tolerate. Almost a third of the adult population will admit to some symptoms of anxiety. Drug therapy, in particular the benzodiazepines, is the mainstay of treatment, but care must be taken to avoid overprescription.", 
    "44": "The cardiovascular effects of hypoglycaemia, with and without beta-blockade, were compared in fourteen healthy men. Eight received insulin alone, and eight, including two of the original insulin-only group, were given propranolol and insulin. In the insulin-group the period of hypoglycaemia was associated with an increase in heart-rate and a fall in diastolic blood-pressure. In the propranolol-insulin group there was a significant fall in heart-rate in most subjects and an increase in diastolic pressure. Typical S-T/T changes occurred in the insulin-group but in none of the propranolol-insulin group. Hypertension in diabetics prone to hypoglycaemia attacks should not be treated with beta-blockers because these drugs may cause a sharp rise in blood-pressure in such patients.", 
    "45": "After rats were trained to differentiate between the effects of d-amphetamine and saline in a state-dependent task, pretreatment with the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, significantly decreased amphetamine discrimination. Pretreatment with the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor, disulfiram, or with the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, p-chloro-phenylalanine, was observed to have no effect on the rats' ability to discriminate d-amphetamine. Administration of haloperidol, a selective dopamine receptor blocker, completely abolished the amphetamine discrimination, whereas alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade had no effect. Apomorphine, a dopamine receptor stimulant, produced amphetamine-like responses and this was, likewise, abolished by pretreatment with haloperidol. These data suggest that dopaminergic systems mediate the interoceptive cue produced by d-amphetamine in rats, and these results are discussed in relation to possible dopamine mediation of amphetamine psychosis and paranoid schizophrenia.", 
    "46": "Verapamil is a novel antiarrhythmic agent which appears to act as a calcium-ion antagonist, blocking calcium transport across the myocardial cell membrane. It was given intravenously, in a dose of 10 mg, to thirty-two patients suffering from paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and sinus rhythm was achieved promptly in all. Identical results were obtained in a further ten patients with supraventricular tachycardias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White or other pre-excitation syndromes. In a separate group of eighteen patients in whom A-V junctional tachycardias were induced during intracardiac electrography, conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in fifteen patients, with prolongation of the cycle length in the others. Circus-movement tachycardias were induced in eight patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in seven. The results were less consistent in patients with other supraventricular arrhythmias including ectopic atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter, and, in the single patient with supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias, only the former was controlled. In the single patient with atrial fibrillation complicating the wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who received Verapamil, sinus rhythm was restored. Side effects were few and mild, with rare exceptions of profound hypotension, bradycardia and asystole; their management is discussed, and reasons are advanced why their occurrence is likely to be related either to the concomitant administration of beta-adrenergic blockers or to the presence of sinoatrial disease. It appears that Verapamil is particularly suitable for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias due to a circus movement as calcium antagonism is likely to be most effective in the N region of the atrioventricular node.", 
    "47": "Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs have become a recognized addition to the hypotensive agents. This article reviews the current beta-blocking agents, with regard to their usage, side-effects and role in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "48": "The antihypertensive effect of atenolol, a new beta-1-receptor blocking agent, was studied in a double-blind trial in which 45 patients with essential hypertension were randomly assigned to placebo or atenolol treatment. Atenolol caused a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction of blood pressure. The optimum daily dose for moderately severe hypertension was considered to be 200 mg. Several irrelevant side effects were collected by the use of a check list, but there was no difference in the number of complaints during placebo and active treatment. Atenolol has a useful antihypertensive effect and, at least theoretically, has advantages over other beta-adrenergic blocking agents.", 
    "49": "The lymphocyte guanyl cyclase response to alpha-agonists was studied in 10 normal people and 12 patients with bronchial asthma. In the normal subjects alpha-adrenergic stimulation with noradrenaline plus propranolol and cholinergic stimulation with acetylcholine evoked significant increases in cyclic guanosine monophosphate formation. In addition the alpha-receptor blocking drug thymoxamine produced a significant stimulation of this enzyme system, and the effects of thymoxamine and acetylcholine were additive. This suggests that receptors for cholinergic and alpha-adrenergic agents are independent. In contrast, lymphocyte guanyl cyclase activity did not show a significant response to these agents in patients with acute asthma. In asthmatic patients in remission the responses were partially restored. The significance of these results for control of bronchomotor tone and the relation of guanyl cyclase activity to cyclic adenosine monophosphate in normal subjects and patients with asthma is discussed.", 
    "50": "The treatment and prevention of arterial thrombosis have been improved in recent years by the use of drugs acting on certain platelet characteristics, such as clumping capacity, adhesivity, release of factors 3 & 4, and survival. Many substances have been proposed for clinical employment. Mechanisms of action are discussed on the basis of personal experience, particularly with dipyrimadol and beta-blocking drugs. It would seem that the best results are obtainable with drugs whose effect on platelet clumping comes from stablisation of the membrane, such as the non-steroid anti-inflammatory preparations, in association with drugs than enhance intraplatelet cyclic AMP.", 
    "51": "A long-term study of established hypertension helped identify a well defined group of 10 patients who differed both clinically and hemodynamically from 59 patients with the more frequent form of this disease. Their cardiac output was significantly increased (P less than 0.001) despite a severe elevation of arterial pressure (average 212/125 mm Hg plus or minus 13.5/7.3[standard error[). All had labile hypertension of long standing (16.2 years average) that was difficult to control and always symptomatic; in all, the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma had to be specifically excluded. Increased myocardial contractility was suggested by (1) significant elevation of the rate of rise of isovolumic pressure (P less than 0.001), and (2) high ratio of cardiac output to cardiopulmonary volume (P less than 0.005). Beta adrenergic blockade with propranolol helped to alleviate symptoms and to control tachycardia but failed by itself to reduce arterial pressure.", 
    "52": "Despite much investigation, the usefulness of various indexes employed clinically for detecting alterations in ventricular contractility in the intact circulation remains controversial. The effects of acute preload, afterload and contractility changes on both ejection and isovolumic phase measures of left ventricular function were analyzed in normal, trained conscious dogs instrumented with micromanometers and endocardial ultrasonic diameter gauges. Rapid volume overload increased the excursion of the left ventricular diameter (delta LVD) by 7 percent above the control level, but mean velocity of circumferential shortening (VCF) did not change significantly; peak rate of left ventricular pressure rise (dP/dt) increased by 11 percent and (dP/dt)/DP40 (DP = developed pressure) was augmented by 10 percent, but maximal [(dP/dt)/LVP], or \"Vpm,\" decreased by 20 percent. Pressure overload by phenylephrine infusion decreased delta LVD by 15 percent and mean VCF fell by 26 percent; peak dP/dt and (dP/dt)/DP40 remained unaltered, but VPM was reduced by 37 percent. Isoproterenol augmented peak dP/dt by 55 percent, and (dP/dt)/DP40, Vpm and mean VCF were increased comparably. Propranolol decreased these measures equally by about 16 percent. Therefore, in the conscious animal in the steady state, isovolumic phase indexes were mildly influenced by acute volume loading, wheras ejection phase indexes were not. Acute increases in aortic pressure markedly reduced ejection phase measures, whereas the isovolumic indexes were unaffected. All of the indexes studied were comparably sensitive to acute alterations in contractility, but we conclude that no single measure can always be used for defining an acute contractility change in the intact circulation.", 
    "53": "The role of cyclic AMP in stimulus-secretion coupling with investigated in rat parotid tissue slices in vitro. Isoproterenol and norepinephrine stimulated a rapid intracellular accumulation of cyclic AMP, which reached a maximum level of 20-30 times the control value by 5 to 10 min after addition of the drug. Isoproterenol was approximately ten times more potent in stimulating both alpha-amylase release and cyclic AMP accumulation than were norepinephrine and epinephrine, which had nearly equal effects on these two parameters. Salbutamol and phenylephrine were less effectivema parallel order of potency and sensitivity was observed for the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in a washed particulate fractionmthe results suggest that these drugs are acting on a parotid acinar cell through a beta1-adrenergic mechanismmat the lowest concentrations tested, each of the adrenergic agonists stimulated significant alpha-anylase release with no detectable stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulationmeven in the presence of theophylline, phenylephrine at several concentrations increased alpha-amylase release without a detectable increase in cyclic AMP levels. However, phenylephrine did stimulate adenylate cyclase. These data suggest that, under certain conditions, large increases in the intra-cellular concentration of cyclic AMP may not be necessary for stimulation of alpha-amylase release by adrenergic agonists. Also consistent with this idea was the observation that stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation by isoproterenol was much more sensitive to inhibition by propranolol than was the stimulation of alpha-amylase release by isoproterenol. Stimulation of alpha-amylase release by phenylephrine was only partially blocked by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, whereas stimulation of adenylate cyclase by phenylephrine was blocked by propranolol and not by phentolaminemphenoxybenzamine and phentolamine potentiated the effects of norepinephrine and isoproterenol on both cyclic AMP accumulation and alpha-amylase release by N-6,O-2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate; These observations may indicate a non-specific action of phenoxybenzamine, and demonstrate the need for caution in interpreting evidence obtained using alpha-adrenergic blocking agents as tools for investigation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonism.", 
    "54": "Injection of heparin i.v. into rats increased significantly free fatty acids (FFAs) plasma levels. When 20 min before the heparin injection 1-(o-allyloxy-phenoxy)-3-isopropylamino-propane-2-ol-hydrochloride (oxprenolol, Trasicor) was administered i.p., FFAs increment was prevented. Isoproterenol-induced plasma FFAs rise was also inhibited by the administration of this beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent. Treatment by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade for prevention of heparine-induced FFAs increase, which possibly contributes to the appearance of heart arrhythmias, must be considered.", 
    "55": "Results of investigation of the affinity between teranol (practalol), alpheprol (alprenolol), propranolol to beta-adrenoreceptors of various organs confirmed the division of these receptors into two subtypes. The action of isadrin on beta1-adrenoreceptors of the myocardium and smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract was accompanied by changes in Ca2+ entrance into the cells. With the action of isadrin on beta2-adrenoreceptors of the trachea and the vessels there was seen an intensification of the Ca2+ ions from the cells and a reduction of the smooth muscle tone."
