    "0": "To evaluate the humoral and hemodynamic (both systemic and renal) effects of celiprolol and to assess whether these effects are at least partially due to the activation of dopamine (DA) receptors, 9 out-patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension, without any therapy for at least 3 weeks, received celiprolol (400 mg once daily) and placebo, each for 1 month, according to a double-blind randomized trial pattern. At the end of each treatment period, blood pressure, heart rate, renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and plasma norepinephrine were measured after administration of saline solution and intravenous metoclopramide. Compared with placebo, celiprolol significantly reduced mean blood pressure, heart rate and plasma norepinephrine. Plasma renin activity showed a tendency toward a reduction during celiprolol treatment, which was not associated with changes in plasma aldosterone. Despite the decrease in mean blood pressure, renal plasma flow did not change, so that renovascular resistances were significantly reduced. Glomerular filtration rate was unchanged and the filtration fraction showed a trend toward a reduction during celiprolol treatment. Percent decrements of renovascular resistances and of mean blood pressure induced by celiprolol tended to correlate with changes in plasma norepinephrine. Metoclopramide did not influence the hemodynamic (systemic and renal) effects of celiprolol nor plasma renin activity and plasma norepinephrine, and it increased aldosterone levels to a similar extent before and after administration of celiprolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "Antihypertensive therapy with celiprolol lowers blood pressure by selectively blocking beta 1 adrenoceptors. It also exhibits vasodilatory and bronchosparing effects and is not cardiodepressive. Because many beta blockers are often suspected of adversely raising serum lipid levels, especially triglycerides, a special investigation of lipids in hypertensive subjects was performed. The preliminary findings in a series of 14 patients (average age 39.7 years) with essential hypertension (World Health Organization stages I to II) who were treated with celiprolol for a period of 6 months are presented. Serum levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein remained virtually unchanged during treatment. There was, however, a tendency for triglyceride levels to fall with celiprolol treatment, a trend that became significant after 4 weeks. Moreover, high-density lipoproteins tended to increase with treatment and were significantly increased after 2 weeks. In contrast to findings obtained with other beta-blocking agents, no increases in total serum lipids were observed during celiprolol treatment. Blood pressure values of the subjects treated decreased significantly from a mean value (measured in the upright position) of 151/99 to 131/87 mm Hg. Blood pressure values taken in the supine position were also significantly reduced. No significant changes were noted in a variety of laboratory parameters, including blood count, blood coagulation time, blood sugar concentration, liver and kidney tests, electrolyte levels and urinalysis. The significance of these results, which suggest that celiprolol is not associated with adverse changes of lipids and may even positively influence blood chemistry, is discussed.", 
    "2": "The use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has gained popularity because it is not subject to those limitations associated with traditional sphygmomanometry (inaccuracy of blood pressure readings, low number of readings, and failure to represent daytime blood pressure readings). In the present study, we provide evidence that the 24-hour mean blood pressure obtained through intraarterial blood pressure measurements in ambulatory patients provides a more accurate diagnosis (and perhaps a prognosis) of hypertension than that provided by cuff-obtained casual blood pressure measurement. Furthermore, despite a reduction in the amount and in the accuracy of the information obtained, blood pressure data provided by noninvasive blood pressure monitoring are also more accurate diagnostically than cuff-obtained casual blood pressure measurements. In 15 essential hypertensive patients in whom celiprolol, 400 mg once daily, was compared with placebo in a randomized double-blind crossover study, the use of noninvasive 24-hour automatic blood pressure monitoring showed that in responsive patients, celiprolol induced a sustained reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout the 24 hours. The blood pressure reduction was also apparent during the night, despite the concomitant occurrence of a slight tachycardia. These findings demonstrate that once-daily administration of celiprolol provides an effective lowering of the 24-hour blood pressure profile. This dosing schedule can therefore be regarded as appropriate for antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "3": "Celiprolol was compared with chlorthalidone in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study of 30 hypertensive or anginal patients with reversible bronchial obstruction. The study consisted of a 4-week placebo run-in period and a 12-week titration period during which the dose of both drugs was increased at 4-week intervals if blood pressure was not reduced adequately. The doses of celiprolol were 200, 400 or 600 mg once daily, whereas those for chlorthalidone were 12.5, 25 or 37.5 mg once daily. Entry criteria were a diastolic blood pressure between 90 to 115 mm Hg, forced expiratory volume in 1 second between 40 and 80% of predicted value, increasing by 15% or more after salbutamol inhalation and the need for occasional bronchodilator therapy. Prophylactic medication for asthma was given at a constant dosage for 1 month before the study and throughout the study. Clinical variables were not significantly changed by either drug, and neither celiprolol nor chlorthalidone had any significant effect on forced expiratory volume in 1 second.", 
    "4": "Beta-adrenoceptor blockade is established therapy for cardiovascular conditions including hypertension and angina pectoris. The important qualities of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist relate to cardioselectivity, hydrophilicity, peripheral vasodilation, ideal pharmacokinetics and maintenance of the quality of life. Celiprolol, with its known cardioselectivity, hydrophilicity and peripheral vasodilator capacity, measures well by several of these criteria; more data on pharmacokinetics are required. Further testing is indicated, particularly in relation to effects on epinephrine-induced hypokalemia, blood lipid profiles, clinical vasodilatory properties and effects on the quality of life, especially in geriatric patients.", 
    "5": "In 10 patients with bronchial asthma but normal ventilatory function, celiprolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, did not significantly affect forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) or airways resistance (Raw). In contrast, metoprolol substantially reduced FEV1 and increased Raw. In addition, compared with metoprolol, celiprolol induced a greater recovery of FEV1 and Raw after methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction.", 
    "6": "Once-daily atenolol and celiprolol were compared in a placebo-controlled crossover study of 16 patients with stable angina pectoris. Atenolol and celiprolol equally and significantly reduced frequency of angina and electrocardiographic evidence of cardiac ischemia. Celiprolol, however, produced less suppression of the double product at 1 mm of ST-segment depression than atenolol, suggesting that actions other than reduction of heart rate may contribute to its antianginal efficacy.", 
    "7": "The introduction of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was a major advance in the treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease. However, nonselective beta blockade carries distinct circulatory disadvantages, which accounts for the search for an \"ideal\" beta-blocking drug for use in this extensive therapeutic field. It is possible to define the desirable cardiodynamic profile of a beta-blocking drug. How far does celiprolol meet this function? What questions should we address in attempting to evaluate the effects of celiprolol on the heart? In contrast to propranolol, in the normal heart, celiprolol does not depress left ventricular pumping function. There is little information on the effects of celiprolol on left ventricular function in the hypertensive patient. However, we now know that most patients with hypertension already have advancing coronary artery disease. It is reasonable, therefore, to examine the effects of celiprolol on left ventricular function in patients with coronary disease because these can not only be used to evaluate the possible efficacy of the drug in patients with angina pectoris, but also to extrapolate to their clinical effectiveness in most patients with hypertension. Celiprolol does not depress left ventricular pumping function at rest or during exercise, in contrast to other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists that reduce both heart rate and left ventricular activity. Moreover, celiprolol possesses anti-ischemic properties equivalent to those of atenolol. It does not appear to aggravate the atherogenic profile of the lipids as much as some other cardioselective beta-blocking drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Celiprolol is a new generation beta blocker with a novel profile of activity that includes a high degree of cardioselectivity, partial beta 2-agonist activity, and possibly a degree of direct peripheral vasodilation. The drug is hydrophilic, with fewer cardiodepressant effects than other beta antagonists. These ancillary properties may make celiprolol a more suitable beta blocker for use in a broader range of hypertensive patients than conventional agents, and additional work is ongoing in patients with obstructive airways disease, peripheral vascular disorders and those with impaired cardiac function to substantiate and extend current findings.", 
    "9": "Lesions of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRn) were shown to block the proestrous surge of LH and the shed of ova normally found the following morning. The possibility that this effect could be mediated by the locus coeruleus (LC) was studied in the present work in view of the fact that stimulation of the LC produced similar responses on LH release and that systemic injection of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, partially prevented the effect of DRn lesions. The blocking effect of DRn lesions on proestrous LH surge and ovulation was reproduced by the injection of either methysergide (1 microgram on the day of proestrus), a serotonin (5-HT) blocking agent, or p-chlorophenylalanine (0.5 microgram on diestrus 1 and diestrus 2), an inhibitor of 5-HT synthesis, into the LC of normal cycling rats. On the contrary, the injection of 5-HT (1 microgram on the day of proestrus) into the LC of rats bearing DRn lesions restored the normal LH surge and ovulation. It is concluded that serotonergic afferents into the LC from the DRn tonically inhibit the activity of LC neurons and that the interference of this inflow results in an activation of neurons and thereby in inhibition of LH release.", 
    "10": "Effects of the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine on insulin release, membrane potential, and cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were investigated using pancreatic beta-cells isolated from obese hyperglycemic mice. Addition of 2 microM clonidine promptly inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release, an effect accompanied by a lowering in both membrane potential and [Ca2+]i. Within minutes, the effect on Ca2+ was partly reversed, [Ca2+]i attaining a new level, although still significantly lower than in the absence of agonist. This late increase in [Ca2+]i was inhibited by 50 microM D-600, a blocker of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. The inhibitory effects of clonidine on membrane potential, [Ca2+]i, and insulin release were abolished by 5 microM of the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine. Depolarization with high K+ increased [Ca2+]i also in the presence of clonidine, conditions accompanied by only a minute release of insulin. Secretion was, however, partly restored by subsequent addition of 20 mM glucose. Addition of 5 mM Ca2+ transiently reversed the effects of clonidine on both membrane potential and [Ca2+]i. Although the clonidine-induced repolarization should be enough for closing the voltage-activated Ca2+ channels with a resulting decrease in [Ca2+]i, a direct interaction of the agonist with these channels cannot be excluded. The fact that it was possible to increase [Ca2+]i with only a minor effect on insulin release suggests that the inhibitory effect of clonidine not only is due to a reduction in [Ca2+]i, but also involves interference with some more distal step in the insulin secretory machinery.", 
    "11": "Hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion method from adult male rats, cultured and then prelabeled with [14C]glucose. The [14C]glycogen-labeled cells were used in experiments for effect of prostaglandins on hormone-stimulated glycogenolysis. Prostaglandin E1, prostaglandin E2 and 16,16-dimethylprostaglandin E2, but not prostaglandin D2 or prostaglandin F2 alpha, inhibited glycogenolysis stimulated by glucagon, epinephrine, isoproterenol (beta-adrenergic agonist) or epinephrine in the presence of propranolol (beta-antagonist) in primary cultured hepatocytes. The inhibitory effects on day 2 of cultures were approx. twice those on day 1. Dimethylprostaglandin E2 (10(-6)M) caused 60-70% inhibitions of the stimulations by these substances. In the case of the stimulation by glucagon, the inhibition further increased by 80-100% on day 3 of culture. Prostaglandin E1 and prostaglandin E2 caused less inhibition than dimethylprostaglandin E2 of all these stimulations. Dinorprostaglandin E1 (9 alpha,13-dihydroxy-7-ketodinorprost-11-enoic acid), which is a hepatocyte-metabolite of prostaglandin E1 and prostaglandin E2, and arachidonic acid did not have any inhibitory effects. These data indicate that the E series of prostaglandins may function as the regulation of hepatic glycogenolysis stimulated by epinephrine and glucagon, and that their rapid degradation system may contribute to the modulation of the action in liver.", 
    "12": "Lithium is a unique drug with therapeutic as well as prophylactic value for both manic and depressive phases of manic-depressive illness. The precise mechanisms of its clinical efficacy remain unknown, but there are two main theories of its biochemical action. One proposes that lithium inhibits adrenergically activated adenylate cyclase function whereas the other suggests that it inhibits phosphatidyl inositol turnover, which is known to be activated by cholinergic agonists. Neither mechanism alone, however, can explain both the antimanic and antidepressant effects of lithium. Because of the pivotal role of G proteins in post-receptor information transduction, we have investigated the interaction of lithium with G protein function. Lithium at therapeutically efficacious concentrations completely blocked both adrenergic and cholinergic agonist-induced increases in [3H]GTP binding to membranes from rat cerebral cortex, in both in vitro and ex vivo experiments. The same lithium treatments also abolished guanine nucleotide modulation of agonist binding. Our findings suggest G proteins (Gs and Gi or Go) as the molecular site of action for both the antimanic and antidepressant effects of lithium.", 
    "13": "1. Adult human hepatocytes were obtained from a normal donor and a barbiturate-overdose fatality and maintained either in pure culture or in co-culture with rat liver epithelial cells. At varying times of culture, metabolic pathways of pindolol and fluperlapine, two drugs which are transformed at different rates and routes in man and rat, were determined after a 24 h incubation. 2. In both culture conditions, human hepatocytes remained able to form the major urinary metabolites of pindolol and fluperlapine, including oxidized products, glucuronide and sulphate conjugates over the whole period studied (i.e. 5 and 21 days in pure and co-culture respectively). 3. Fluperlapine which has the higher first pass in man and animals was found to be metabolized in vitro more quickly than pindolol. 4. Some qualitative and quantitative differences were found between normal and drug-altered human hepatocytes, indicating that in vivo environmental factors may greatly influence metabolic properties of these cells even after several days in culture.", 
    "14": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on the drift in O2 consumption (VO2 drift) typically observed during prolonged constant-rate exercise was studied in 14 healthy males in moderate heat at 40% of maximal O2 consumption (VO2max). After an initial maximum cycle ergometer test to determine the subjects' control VO2max, subjects were administered each of three medications: placebo, atenolol (100 mg once daily), and propranolol (80 mg twice daily), in a randomized double-blind fashion. Each medication period was 5 days in length and was followed by a 4-day washout period. On the 3rd day of each medication period, subjects performed a maximal cycle ergometer test. On the final day of each medication period, subjects exercised at 40% of their control VO2max for 90 min on a cycle ergometer in a warm (31.7 +/- 0.3 degrees C) moderately humid (44.7 +/- 4.7%) environment. beta-Blockade caused significant (P less than 0.05) reductions in VO2max, maximal minute ventilation (VEmax), maximal heart rate (HRmax), and maximal exercise time. Significantly greater decreases in VO2max, VEmax, and HRmax were associated with the propranolol compared with the atenolol treatment. During the 90-min submaximal rides, beta-blockade significantly reduced heart rate. Substantially lower values for O2 consumption (VO2) and minute ventilation (VE) were observed with propranolol compared with atenolol or placebo. Furthermore, VO2 drift and HR drift were observed under atenolol and placebo conditions but not with propranolol. Respiratory exchange ratio decreased significantly over time during the placebo and atenolol trials but did not change during the propranolol trial.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "15": "1. Sotalol (Sotalex) and both its optical isomers were studied in electrophysiological experiments with respect to their class III activity of antiarrhythmic drugs. The three substances prolonged action potentials (AP) of guinea-pig papillary muscle and left atrium in concentrations greater than or equal to 3 mumol/l, whereas other AP parameters (resting potential, amplitude and upstroke velocity) remained unchanged. Similar results were observed if papillary muscles were partially depolarized by elevating the extracellular potassium concentration from 4.7 mmol/l to 10-12 mmol/l. 2. The effects of sotalol showed marked frequency dependence (0.017-2 Hz): At slow driving rates sotalol brought about an enhanced AP prolongation as measured by APD30 and APD90. 3. The results were compatible with numerical AP simulation studies on the basis of the assumption that sotalol inhibits time-dependent K-outward current. This leads to the consequence that longer control APs (at low driving rates) are prolonged more effectively by sotalol than shorter ones (at high driving rates). 4. Sotalol effects dynamically followed APD changes due to alterations of driving rate: If APD was decreased under increasing driving frequencies, AP prolongation was diminished. 5. Paired pulse experiments showed that class III activity of sotalol was preserved in premature or delayed single action potentials.", 
    "16": "1. Ambulatory electrocardiography was used to compare the effects of propranolol and pindolol on symptoms, heart rate, arrhythmias and ST segments. Seventeen males (mean age 54 years) with a diagnosis of chronic stable angina pectoris (New York Heart Association Class II-III) were studied. Patients were treated on a double-blind cross-over basis with propranolol 80 mg three times daily or pindolol 5 mg three times daily for 14 days each. During the last 48 h of each treatment period ambulatory electrocardiography was performed. 2. Propranolol resulted in a significantly lower mean hourly, mean 24 h and minimum heart rate. Likewise propranolol caused a lower mean daytime and nocturnal heart rate. There was no significant difference in the frequency of angina between the treatments. The number of episodes of ST segment depression was not significantly different between the two drugs, although there was a trend in favour of propranolol. 3. Both the mean 24 h ST level and the maximum ST segment depression were lower during treatment with pindolol. Propranolol was associated with a total of 117 nocturnal pauses or episodes of asystole ranging in length from 1.5 to 2.8 s. During treatment with pindolol only one such period occurred. The number of premature ventricular contractions occurring during treatment with pindolol (1316 beats) was less than on propranolol (2010) and the mean hourly frequency of premature ventricular contractions was significantly lower during pindolol administration. 4. Pindolol is not significantly different from propranolol in the control of symptomatic and asymptomatic myocardial ischaemia and is associated with fewer premature ventricular contractions. However, there is no advantage in using pindolol in chronic stable angina.", 
    "17": "The effects of section and stimulation of the sympathetic nerve trunk on gastric motility were investigated in conscious and decorticate rabbits. In conscious animals after section of the abdominal splanchnic nerve, rhythm of antral and pyloric bursts was enhanced, becoming more regular, and the period of arrest of the rhythmic bursts, which was usually observed at the end of inflation of the antrum in intact rabbits, was shortened to 33.6 +/- 4.0 s from 112.2 +/- 14.6 s observed before the sympathetic nerve transection. Adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine (100 micrograms/kg), clonidine (5 micrograms/kg) and salbutamol (1 mg/kg) inhibited antral and pyloric activity. In decorticate rabbits the major effect of stimulation of the peripheral or the central end of the thoracic sympathetic trunk was inhibition; this was seen both with the spontaneous and vagally induced e.m.g. activity of the antrum and pylorus. Inhibition induced by stimulation of sympathetic efferents was abolished by beta-blocking agents and that induced by stimulation of the sympathetic afferents disappeared after alpha-adrenergic block. Significance of a dual control of the gastric motility by the sympathetic nerve was discussed.", 
    "18": "The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) Pilot Study was conducted to determine the feasibility of conducting a long-term placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in elderly subjects. Enrolled in the study were 551 men and women between the ages of 60 and 90 years with isolated systolic hypertension (SBP greater than or equal to 160 mmHg and DBP less than 90 mmHg). The study showed that it is possible to recruit old and very old subjects into a clinical trial; the elderly are good compliers (drugs and follow-up visits), with some decline after the age of 80; control of blood pressure was accomplished in the large majority of patients; evaluation of side effects represents a potential problem as varied complaints increase with age thus creating difficulties in distinguishing those attributed to the study drug; and finally, cause-specific mortality is probably preferable to all-cause mortality as an end-point in prevention trials of antihypertensive regimens.", 
    "19": "Physical exercise, beta-adrenergic stimulation and calcium channel blockade can affect calcium homeostasis. The present study investigated, in eight healthy males, the effects of orally administered propranolol or verapamil during a 2-min maximal, isokinetic, leg exercise. Immediately after exercise the plasma ionized calcium concentrations were increased, in control and drug tests, by 5-6%, and within 5 min of recovery they were almost returned to baseline. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations were unchanged at termination of exercise, but they increased during the first 5 min of recovery, coincident with the decline in calcium concentrations, which, however, were still elevated. Neither verapamil nor propranolol selectively changed basal or exercise plasma ionized calcium or serum PTH concentrations. Muscle strength, blood pH, lactate concentrations and plasma volume changes were not affected by any drug. Verapamil did not have any specific effect on the concentrations of plasma magnesium, phosphate, potassium or sodium while propranolol increased the concentrations of plasma potassium and decreased those of phosphate during exercise as well as recovery.", 
    "20": "Ocular and cardiovascular effects of carteolol 2%, timolol 0.5%, and dummy eyedrops have been measured in a single dose double-blind crossover study in six healthy volunteers. Both drugs lowered intraocular pressure and reduced exercise-induced tachycardia. Neither produced a significant change in resting heart rate or blood pressure. The two agents appear comparable as regards ocular hypotensive and cardiovascular effects.", 
    "21": "The effect of beta 1-adrenergic blockade on body temperature was studied during general anaesthesia by means of a thermistor in an indwelling pulmonary arterial catheter. Metoprolol (200 mg daily) or placebo was given double-blind preoperatively for at least 2 weeks to 27 hypertensive patients undergoing abdominal surgery. A significantly greater temperature fall was observed in the metoprolol group compared with the placebo group. Heat production in the rectus abdominis muscle, measured by direct microcalorimetry, was significantly lower after metoprolol. The hypothermic effect of beta-adrenergic blockade during anaesthesia deserves special attention.", 
    "22": "We previously used the Doppler transmitral flow velocity ratio A/E (A = late ventricular filling peak velocity; E = early ventricular filling peak velocity) and the age-adjusted ratio A/E/Age to detect left ventricular filling abnormalities in untreated mild hypertension. This study is a double-blind assessment of the effect of combined alpha- and beta-blockade (labetalol) and beta-blockade alone (atenolol) on left ventricular filling in mild hypertension. Twenty-seven patients blindly randomized to labetalol (12 patients) and atenolol (15 patients) treatment completed the echocardiographic and Doppler studies. Clinical and echo-Doppler data obtained at baseline and 6 weeks after initiation of therapy showed no difference between the two groups for age (49 +/- 10 vs 46 +/- 10 years), mean blood pressure (before therapy, 118 +/- 9 vs 117 +/- 8 mm Hg; after therapy, 108 +/- 12 mm Hg), left ventricular dimensions, wall thickness, systolic function, and mean late filling velocity A. There was no significant change in left ventricular mass and mass index with labetalol (left ventricular mass, 211 +/- 36 vs 216 +/- 38; mass index, 110 +/- 17 vs 112 +/- 16) or atenolol (245 +/- 41 vs 271 +/- 65; 120 +/- 18 vs 130 +/- 35). The mean velocity E, A/E, and A/E/Age ratios significantly improved with labetalol (p less than 0.05) but did not change significantly with atenolol. The improvement in A/E and A/E/Age ratios was primarily due to an increase in early filling velocity E.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "Twenty-eight patients with resistant hypertension were found to have primary aldosteronism; 25 had solitary adenoma and 3 had adrenal hyperplasia. All were severely hypertensive despite receiving three or more antihypertensive agents, including conventional doses of diuretics, sympatholytics, and vasodilators. Hypervolemia (24 patients) or normovolemia (2 patients) despite severe diastolic hypertension was the hallmark in 26 patients. Adequate salt and water depletion alone with spironolactone (200 mg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide (50-100 ng/day) reduced arterial pressure in all. Twenty-two patients had surgical removal of a solitary adenoma. Over 1 to 2 years of follow-up, 13 were normotensive without medication, and six required hydrochlorothiazide and three hydrochlorothiazide plus a beta-blocker to normalize blood pressure. Blood pressure response to surgery had no relation to either duration or severity of hypertension. Six patients (three with hyperplasia, three with adenoma) have continued diuretic therapy and are normokalemic and normotensive. These results indicate that primary aldosteronism can be associated with sever and drug-resistant hypertension, that maintained hypervolemia is the reason for resistance to therapy, that sustained volume depletion is the most important therapeutic goal for these patients, and that cure can be achieved despite prolonged and severe hypertension.", 
    "24": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were treated with a combination of a beta 1-blocker (metoprolol) and a calcium antagonist (felodipine) from 1 to 4 or from 4 to 6 months of age. Basal cerebral arteries were fixed by immersion and embedded in plastic. The ratio between media thickness and luminal radius was determined in cross-sectioned arteries for a standardized condition, assuming a smooth and circular internal elastic membrane. The treatment caused a significant decrease in blood pressure and a normalization of m/r ratios in basal cerebral arteries when initiated in young as well as in adult SHR and SHRSP, i.e. the therapy efficiently prevents as well as reverses hypertensive arterial changes. Even though 4-month-old treated rats were still significantly hypertensive, their m/r ratios did not differ from those of normotensive controls. The latter results may indicate that the treatment affects the vessel walls also through other mechanisms than by decreasing the pressure load.", 
    "25": "We compared the effects of decreased coronary perfusion pressure (CP) and propranolol on the relation between left ventricular O2 consumption (VO2) and systolic pressure-volume area (PVA). PVA represents total mechanical energy generated by contraction and is the area under the end-systolic pressure-volume (PV) line and systolic PV trajectory. In excised cross-circulated dog hearts, a decrease in CP from 82 (mean) to 51 mmHg decreased ventricular contractility index Emax (slope of end-systolic PV relation) by 17% (P less than 0.05) and slightly (P less than 0.05 in 3 of 11 hearts) lowered the VO2-PVA relation in a parallel fashion. A further decrease in CP to 32 mmHg decreased Emax by 56% (P less than 0.05) and considerably (P less than 0.05) lowered the VO2-PVA relation by decreasing both the VO2-axis intercept by 26% (P less than 0.05) and the slope by 24% (P less than 0.05) from control. Propranolol decreased Emax by 48% (P less than 0.05) and the VO2-axis intercept by 25% (P less than 0.05) without changing the slope (P greater than 0.05). We attributed the different response of the VO2-PVA relation to the difference of the coronary O2 supply-demand balance between decreased CP and propranolol.", 
    "26": "Exercise training can improve angina. A patient whose exercise tolerance test became normal after a year on an exercise programme nevertheless had a positive exercise test when he was taking a beta blocker. These results suggest that it may be undesirable to use beta blockers in patients with angina who are on exercise programmes.", 
    "27": "Ten normal subjects performed the Valsalva maneuver before and after the administration of propranolol (1 mg/kg). Changes in left ventricular (LV) size and function were assessed with noninvasive techniques (echocardiography and sphygmomanometer). Data were obtained at baseline, at 20 seconds of the strain phase (phase II) and 10 seconds after the release of strain (phase IV). In the control state (before propranolol), blood pressure decreased during phase II and exceeded baseline after the release of strain (\"overshoot\") in phase IV; after the administration of propranolol, the pressure overshoot characteristic of phase IV was no longer present. End-diastolic dimension decreased during the strain phase, but returned to baseline values during recovery in both control and propranolol states. LV stress-dimension and stress-shortening relations before and after propranolol indicate that an increase in LV contractility beginning during phase II and extending into phase IV was attenuated after propranolol. Although the absence of phase IV blood pressure overshoot may be clinically useful in identifying patients with impaired left ventricular function, beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents can also produce this hemodynamic response in the presence of normal ventricular function.", 
    "28": "Age-related changes of the sinus node (SN) function and the autonomic influence on the SN function were evaluated in 65 patients with sick sinus syndrome (range 14 to 84 years). Heart rate (HR), corrected SN recovery time and sinoatrial conduction time were measured before (basic) and after (intrinsic) autonomic blockade (propranolol 0.2 mg/kg plus atropine 0.04 mg/kg intravenously). Percent of autonomic chronotropies of the SN function were calculated by the following formulas: (1)--(intrinsic HR--basic HR/intrinsic HR) X 100; (2) (intrinsic corrected SN recovery time--basic corrected SN recovery time/intrinsic corrected SN recovery time) X 100; (3) (intrinsic sinoatrial conduction time--basic sinoatrial conduction time/intrinsic sinoatrial conduction time) X 100. Basic HR, basic corrected SN recovery time and basic sinoatrial conduction time did not vary with age. Intrinsic HR decreased with age, but this correlation was weak (r = -0.54, p less than 0.001). Intrinsic corrected SN recovery time and intrinsic sinoatrial conduction time tended to increase with age (r = 0.26, p less than 0.05; r = 0.29, p less than 0.05, respectively). Percent chronotropies of HR, corrected SN recovery time and sinoatrial conduction time were negative values in younger patients and positive values in elderly patients; they correlated positively with age (r = 0.59, p less than 0.001; r = 0.60, p less than 0.001; r = 0.43, p less than 0.001, respectively). Thus, the basic SN function did not change with age, while the intrinsic SN function deteriorated with age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "Sixteen patients underwent electrophysiologic studies before and after intravenous infusion of propranolol, 0.1 mg/kg. All of them had intraventricular conduction disturbances. A significant (p less than 0.01) increase occurred after propranolol in the mean spontaneous cycle length (mean change 122 ms) and the AH interval (mean 28 ms). The HV interval did not change significantly. The effective refractory period of the His-Purkinje system increased in 4 of 5 patients (mean net change 44 ms, p greater than 0.10). In 7 patients with phase 3 infranodal block, the longest cycle length for producing block increased after propranolol in 5 and remained unchanged in 2 (mean increase 40 ms, p less than 0.02). Two patients showed phase 4 atrioventricular block. Propranolol increased the critical cycle length by an average of 120 ms. Propranolol-induced bradycardia restored stable atrioventricular conduction in 2 patients with intermittent 2:1 block but facilitated the occurrence of high grade infranodal block in 1 patient. Thus, propranolol can impair His-Purkinje conduction in patients with preexisting infranodal abnormalities.", 
    "30": "The mechanisms controlling vagally induced release of serotonin-like immunoreactivity (5-HTLI) into portal circulation and jejunal lumen were studied in individual cats. In control animals, electrical vagal nerve stimulation significantly enhanced both the endoluminal secretion rate of 5-HTLI and the release of 5-HTLI into the portal vein. The vagally induced release of 5-HTLI into portal circulation was blocked by pretreatment with propranolol or phenoxybenzamine, or by previous removal of the superior cervical ganglia, but was not blocked by atropine or hexamethonium. On the contrary, the luminal secretion of 5-HTLI after vagal stimulation was not blocked by adrenoceptor blocking agents or ganglionectomy, but instead was inhibited by cholinoceptor antagonists. Thus, in the same experimental animals it was shown that vagally induced release of 5-HTLI into portal circulation was mediated by adrenoceptor mechanisms, while endoluminal release of 5-HTLI was regulated via cholinoceptors. Based on indirect estimations, the apical release of 5-HT seems to be quantitatively small in comparison with the release into portal circulation.", 
    "31": "Studies were performed to elucidate the role of the locus coeruleus, which is rich in norepinephrine-containing cell bodies, in vesical function using alpha-chloralose anesthetized cats. Stimulation of the locus coeruleus caused contraction of the urinary bladder, which was not affected by transection of the bilateral hypogastric nerves, but blocked by intravenous administration of hexamethonium, a ganglion blocking agent. In animals with transected hypogastric nerves, the locus coeruleus-induced contraction was inhibited by intrathecal administration of phentolamine (alpha-blocker) and prazosin (alpha 1-blocker), but not affected by intrathecal sotalol (beta-blocker) or yohimbine (alpha 2-blocker). In animals treated with reserpine, the locus coeruleus-induced contraction was enhanced by intravenous application of L-dopa, a precursor of norepinephrine. These results suggest that norepinephrine derived from the locus coeruleus activated preganglionic neurons in the sacral intermediolateral nuclei via alpha 1-receptors, thereby producing urinary bladder contraction.", 
    "32": "We describe 3 men with moderate to severe essential hypertension in whom ejaculatory failure developed after therapy with labetalol, an antihypertensive drug with alpha-1 and beta-adrenergic blocking properties. No decrease in libido or erectile dysfunction was reported by any of the patients. Previous and subsequent antihypertensive therapy with either alpha or beta-adrenergic blocking agents failed to cause similar symptoms. These findings reveal a unique spectrum of genitourinary dysfunction associated with the multireceptor blocking properties of labetalol.", 
    "33": "This study examined the effects of changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic tone on the cycle length at which Mobitz type II second degree atrioventricular (AV) block occurred. Four patients who had electrocardiographic evidence of type II AV block and confirmation of block in the His-Purkinje system during electrophysiologic study were evaluated. These patients received intravenous atropine (1.0 to 2.4 mg), propranolol (0.15 mg/kg body weight) or isoproterenol (1 and 2 micrograms/min) alone or in combination. In two of three patients receiving propranolol, the atrial pacing cycle length at which 1:1 His-Purkinje conduction occurred was prolonged relative to control (from 360 to 470 ms and 440 to 590 ms, respectively). In contrast, atropine in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade shortened the cycle length at which 1:1 His-Purkinje conduction occurred in three of four patients receiving the drug (470 to 390, 630 to 570 and 590 to 560 ms, respectively). Isoproterenol also improved His-Purkinje conduction in the one patient receiving this drug. No agent affected the duration of the HV interval during spontaneous sinus rhythm or right atrial pacing. Thus, drugs that alter autonomic tone influence abnormal His-Purkinje conduction minimally during sinus rhythm but, importantly, may modulate the atrial pacing cycle length at which type II AV block occurs.", 
    "34": "Ultrasonic backscatter is substantially modified by pathologic changes in myocardium. Influence of physiologic changes in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, preload, and inotropic state were studied in 17 anesthetized open-chest dogs. Heart rate was changed with atrial pacing/ULFS'49 (a selective bradycardiac agent). Mean arterial pressure was varied with aortic constriction/nitroprusside, preload was altered with nitroglycerin/volume infusion, and inotropic states were altered with dobutamine (10 microns/kg)/esmolol (100 microns/kg). IBR5, an optimum weighted frequency average (4 to 6.8 MHz) of the squared envelope of diffraction corrected for absolute backscatter, and the Fourier coefficient of amplitude modulation (FAM), an index of cardiac cycle-dependent variation, were measured from six sequential electrocardiographically gated intervals throughout the cardiac cycle. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, preload, and inotropic state did not significantly affect IBR5. FAM increased from 3.5 +/- 0.3 dB (mean +/- SEM) to 7.0 +/- 0.4 dB (p less than .01) at a heart rate of 120 beats/min, and decreased to 3.9 +/- 0.4 at a heart rate of 160 beats/min. No change in FAM was noted with a rise (70 +/- 12 to 45 +/- 10 mmHg) in mean arterial pressure or preload (an increase or decrease in diastolic segment length of +/- 10% from the baseline). Dobutamine produced a significant increase in left ventricular dP/dt (2600 +/- 200 to 3475 +/- 275 mm Hg) and FAM (3.4 +/- 0.1 to 6.4; p less than .01). Esmolol significantly reduced left ventricular dP/dt (2600 +/- 200 to 2000 +/- 175 mm Hg, p less than .05) and FAM (3.4 +/- 0.01 to 6.4 +/- 0.1; p less than .01). We conclude that IBR5 is independent of heart rate, mean arterial pressure, preload, and inotropic state. Cardiac cycle-dependent amplitude modulation follows changes in cardiac contraction.", 
    "35": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is accentuated antagonism between sympathetic and vagal effects on ventricular refractory periods (VRPs) in humans. The effects of 0.04 mg/kg of atropine on the right ventricular effective and functional refractory periods were determined in the setting of beta-adrenergic blockade by propranolol (0.15 mg/kg loading dose, then 0.1 mg/min continuous infusion, group 1) and in the setting of beta-adrenergic stimulation by 25 or 50 ng/kg/min isoproterenol (groups 2 and 3, respectively). Groups 4 to 6 served as control groups. In group 4, VRPs were determined on three occasions separated by 10 min each in the absence of drug. VRPs also were determined on two occasions after infusion of propranolol (group 5) or 25 ng/kg/min of isoproterenol (group 6). Groups 1 to 4 consisted of 10 subjects each, and groups 5 and 6 consisted of five subjects each. VRPs were determined with the use of basic drive cycle lengths of 600, 500, 400, and 350 msec. Because of sinus tachycardia, sufficient data for comparison of groups 1 to 3 were available only at drive cycle lengths of 400 and 350 msec. Atropine significantly shortened the VRPs in groups 1 to 3, but the magnitude of atropine's effects in group 3 (5.3% to 5.8% shortening at drive cycle length of 350 msec) was significantly greater than in group 1 (2.6% to 3.0% shortening, p less than .05) Data from the control groups demonstrated that there was no effect of time on measurement of VRPs either in the drug-free state or in the presence of propranolol or isoproterenol. The results of this study indicate that cholinergic tone lengthens VRPs in the absence of background sympathetic activity and that this lengthening of VRPs may become accentuated during beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "36": "We calculated the wavelength of the atrial impulse in chronically instrumented conscious dogs by measuring both conduction velocity and refractory period: wavelength = refractory period X conduction velocity. Implantation of multiple stimulating and recording electrodes allowed wavelength determination at four different areas: the right and left parts of Bachmann's bundle and the free walls of the right and left atria. During programmed electrical stimulation, three types of arrhythmias were observed: rapid repetitive responses, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation. During normal rhythm, the wavelength of the atrial impulse varied between 14 and 18 cm. Premature beats had a shorter wavelength, depending on the degree of prematurity. Premature beats that evoked rapid repetitive responses showed a critical shortening of the wavelength below 12.3 cm. Episodes of atrial flutter were induced at a wavelength below 9.7 cm, while fibrillation occurred at wavelengths shorter than 7.8 cm. We correlated the induction of these arrhythmias with the values of refractory period, conduction velocity, and wavelength during control and during administration of several drugs. Intravenous administration of acetylcholine shortened the wavelength by 30-40%, mainly because of refractory period shortening. Both propafenone and lidocaine had strong but opposite effects on refractoriness and conduction and, consequently, little effect on the wavelength. Quinidine markedly prolonged the refractory period, but prolongation of wavelength was less because of a simultaneous decrease in conduction velocity. d-Sotalol also increased refractory period, but because it had no appreciable effect on conduction velocity, this drug was the most effective in prolongation of wavelength. Linear discriminant analysis of the data showed that the refractory period and the conduction velocity each were poor parameters to predict the occurrence of the different arrhythmias (predictive value 48% and 38%, respectively). The combination of both properties, however, as expressed in the wavelength, was a more reliable index that predicted the induction of the different arrhythmias correctly in 75% of the cases. We conclude that the wavelength is a useful parameter for evaluating antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "37": "A 58-year-old man presented stating that he had voluntarily ingested eight 80-mg propranolol tablets in approximately 24 hours. He was asymptomatic at the time of presentation. Subsequently, the patient developed only mild bradycardia. The ECG showed sinus bradycardia with striking early repolarization, ST segment elevation, and peaked T waves. These ECG abnormalities represent an unusual pattern for beta-adrenergic blocking agent toxicity.", 
    "38": "Peptide YY (PYY) is released by perfusion of an ileocolonic segment with oleate and inhibits exocrine pancreatic secretion. This study was designed to determine the role of the adrenergic pathway in the PYY-induced inhibition of pancreatic secretion. After intravenous administration of PYY, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of pancreatic HCO3 and protein responses to secretin, cholecystokinin, and feeding in conscious dogs and a reduction in pancreatic blood flow in anesthetized animals. These inhibitory effects of PYY on pancreatic secretion and blood flow were abolished in the presence of combined phentolamine and propranolol. Ileal perfusion with oleate caused a rise in plasma PYY levels similar to that observed after intravenous infusion of exogenous PYY. Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade also antagonized the effects of ileal perfusion with oleate on hormonal and postprandial pancreatic secretion. We conclude that exogenous PYY or endogenous PYY released by ileal oleate inhibits pancreatic secretory responses to exogenous secretin, cholecystokinin, or a meal and causes pancreatic vasoconstriction. Both these effects are mediated, at least in part, by the adrenergic pathway.", 
    "39": "To determine whether opioid peptides have direct effects on myocardium we compared the effects of enkephalin analogs DAGO and DADL on both an innervated heart and a denervated heterotopically transplanted heart in the same animal. DAGO and DADL injected intravenously into anesthetized rats with two hearts produced hypotension, fall in end-systolic left ventricular pressure of both recipient's and donor's heart, bradycardia and decreasing of contractility in recipient's heart. Opioid peptides exerted no chronotropic effect and a slight positive inotropic effect on denervated transplanted heart. Both bradycardia and decreasing of contractility in recipient's heart have the neurogenic origin.", 
    "40": "Skin vessel reactivity was studied by means of an iontophoretic technique in 19 adult patients with atopic dermatitis. Fifteen patients were available for reinvestigation some 6 months later in winter. Compared with a control group, we found a significantly increased sensitivity in summer of dermal skin vessels toward the alpha 1-agonist phenylephrine. Patients with elevated serum IgE levels seemed to be more sensitive to phenylephrine. However, the difference was not significant. Isoproterenol, the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, induced blanching (as opposed to erythema) in 7 of 19 (37%) atopic dermatitis patients in summer and in 9 of 15 (60%) in winter compared with 1 of 36 in the control groups. This blanching was antagonized by the alpha-blocker phentolamine. From the results we concluded that there may be an increased alpha-adrenoceptor reactivity and/or a decreased beta-adrenoceptor reactivity in atopic dermatitis patients, which might be a primary defect.", 
    "41": "Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure, including the acceleration phase, and left ventricular mass were evaluated in 16 patients with isolated systolic hypertension (standing blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 95 mm Hg diastolic). After a 4-week, single-blind, placebo period, each patient underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and echocardiography. Labetalol therapy was then initiated at 100 mg twice a day in a single-blind manner and increased weekly by 100 mg twice a day until blood pressure control was obtained or a maximum dosage of 400 mg twice a day was reached. Blood pressure control was achieved at a mean daily dose of 363 +/- 46 mg of labetalol. Measurements were repeated at the end of an 8-week maintenance phase. Labetalol therapy significantly reduced the mean 24-hour systolic ambulatory blood pressure from 154 +/- 8 (mean +/- SEM) mm Hg at baseline to 142 +/- 6 mm Hg (p greater than 0.01) and controlled the early morning surge in systolic ambulatory blood pressure. Minor reductions in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were statistically but not clinically significant. Left ventricular mass was not changed. Labetalol monotherapy provides effective 24-hour control of systolic blood pressure, including the acceleration phase, in patients with isolated systolic hypertension.", 
    "42": "In two patient series including 809 and 327 patients, respectively, with acute myocardial infarction we have compared those who died in myocardial rupture (verified at autopsy, Group A) with those who died without rupture (autopsied, Group B), and those who survived hospitalization (Group C) with regard to previous history and clinical course in hospital. Rupture among autopsied patients was observed in 45% and 40% of the cases in the respective studies. Previous infarction was observed in each study as 0% and 0% in Group A compared with 25% and 31% in Group B, and 20% and 34% in Group C. Previous angina pectoris was observed in 26% and 22% in Group A compared with 50% and 54% in Group B and 52% and 54% in Group C. Maximum serum enzyme activity in Group A did not differ from Group B, but was higher than in Group C (p less than 0.001). Group A patients tended to have a higher initial pain score and a higher requirement of analgesics compared with other groups, whereas initial heart rate or systolic blood pressure did not differ in these patients compared to others. We thus conclude that patients with myocardial rupture have a very low occurrence of previous myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, and that their pain course appears to be particularly severe in the acute phase.", 
    "43": "Studies employing direct electrical stimulation of the renal nerves have shown that, depending on the frequency used, selective effects on renal function can be evoked. With low frequencies, an increase in renin secretion can be elicited without affecting glomerular filtration rate, sodium excretion, or renal blood flow. In the present investigation the possibility was addressed that the central nervous system (CNS) is also organized to evoke selective changes in renal function. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus was electrically stimulated in conscious rats with 150 microA and frequencies of 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 Hz. Blood samples for determination of plasma renin activity (PRA) were collected before and at the end of each 5-min stimulation period. The lower frequencies had no effect on PRA, but stimulation with 10 and 15 Hz produced a significant increase. This effect on PRA was not accompanied by changes in arterial pressure or renal blood flow. In a separate group of animals, stimulation of the PVN with 15 Hz produced a marked decrease in urine volume, but sodium excretion did not change. These data raise the possibility that the CNS is organized to evoke selective increases in sympathetic outflow to the kidney and to produce separate changes in renal functions.", 
    "44": "In a double-blind, within-patient study, blood pressure was measured at regular intervals at the clinic by the physician and each day at home by the patient. Both methods of blood pressure measurement demonstrated an antihypertensive effect of the diuretics chlorthalidone (25 mg) and triamterene (50 mg) and the beta-blocker oxprenolol (160 mg) and the greater efficacy of the combination of the two therapies. During placebo, as well as during active treatment, blood pressure values were higher at the clinic than at home, except when the patients were taking the beta-blocker, which minimized the arousal response during blood pressure measurements in the clinic. With 2-week treatment periods, separated by 2 weeks of placebo administration, blood pressure returned toward its initial level after each of the three treatments and none of the carryover effects was significant at the 5% level. This methodology was intended to make it possible to demonstrate in 27 patients at the clinic and in 20 patients with measurements made at home, at the usual statistical risks (alpha = 5%, beta = 10%), a fall of 5 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure in comparison with a placebo. Moreover, at the end of this 3-month follow-up, each patient could continue to receive the treatment that was the most effective and the best tolerated. In conclusion, the use of a within-patient trial design, with a 15-day washout period between active treatments and careful recording of blood pressure values, can minimize the number of patients included in hypertension trials and offer to each patient the possibility of individualization of treatment.", 
    "45": "In this paper it was examined whether it could reproduce \"in vitro\", some of the myocardial dysfunction see \"in vivo\" in autoimmune myocarditis. The isolated atria from mice hyperimmunized with heart exhibited a lymphomononuclear cell infiltration and alteration in contractility: dysrhythmia and decrease in tension. These alterations highly resembled that triggered by spleen lymphocytes from autoimmune myocarditis mice, when they reacted with normal atria. This effect appears to be specific since cells sensitized to an irrelevant antigen were inactive, and was not secondary to allogenic interaction. The free-cell supernatant of autoimmune cells was inactive, point out the requirement of lymphocyte-heart contact. The most likely effectors of lymphocytes-induced alteration of atria contractility were T-lymphocytes. Beta-lymphocyte subset had no effect. Inhibitors of lipoxygenase(s) pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, inhibited induced alterations of contractility and the SRS-A receptor blocker, FPL-55712 improved cardiac function. In addition LTC4 release was increased either in autoimmune myocarditis hearts and in normal hearts challenged with autoimmune cells; the hearts proving to be responsible of leukotriene synthesis. Normal or immune cells alone failed to release LTC4. Lipoxygenase(s) inhibitors diminished LTC4 release while indomethacin could not reverse the effect. It is concluded that mononuclear cells infiltrates occurring in hearts with autoimmune myocarditis mice are related to cardiac impairment, being critical in the myocardial dysfunction etiology. The way suggested for these phenomena to take place is, at least in part, the harmful effect of SRS-A released by hearts when specific antigens of myocardial tissue are recognized by autoimmune cells.",

Since then several cases have been reported which have illustrated different aspects of the disease but the exact aetiology, pathogenesis and prognosis remain uncertain.

    "47": "A hyperthyroid symptom scale (HSS) was designed and administered to ten subjects with untreated Graves' disease. All subjects had clinical and chemical evidence of hyperthyroidism and reproducible HSS scores of 20 or more points. During sequential treatments with propranolol hydrochloride (phase 2) followed by propylthiouracil (phase 3) there was a significant decline in the HSS scores at each phase. Accompanying the decrease in HSS scores was a decrease in heart rate, but there was no change in thyroid function test results at phase 2 and a decrease in heart rate, thyroid function test results, and goiter size at phase 3. This new scale includes ten categories of symptoms, it is sensitive to changes in both the adrenergic and metabolic components of hyperthyroidism, and it is useful in the clinical assessment and management of patients with thyrotoxicosis.", 
    "48": "The authors evaluated the efficacy of once-daily treatment with levobunolol in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in an open-labeled, two-phase titration clinical trial. All patients started the study using 0.25% levobunolol administered once daily for 3 months (phase I). If a patient's intraocular pressure (IOP) was not controlled with this concentration of levobunolol, the concentration was increased to 0.5% administered once daily for 3 months (phase II). During phase I, a significant reduction in IOP was observed in 21 of the 29 patients (72%), with an average IOP reduction of 24%. During phase II, in six patients whose IOP was reduced inadequately with 0.25% levobunolol, one had a significant reduction in IOP with 0.5% levobunolol. The authors concluded that levobunolol, instilled once daily at a concentration of 0.25%, was effective in significantly reducing IOP in the majority of the patients evaluated.", 
    "49": "Forty-seven patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma who required therapy but who had never been treated previously were enrolled in a prospective randomized, long-term clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of 0.5% timolol maleate and 1% epinephrine. Patients were followed for an average of 33 months. There were 20 failures, 18 of which were because of inadequate intraocular pressure (IOP) control (required 20% reduction in outflow pressure). Twelve failures were in the epinephrine group and eight were in the timolol group. During the first year of therapy, 35% compared with 0% of patients failed in the epinephrine and timolol groups, respectively (P less than 0.01). During the later years of the study, the failure rates in the two groups were similar. The results suggest that timolol is superior to epinephrine during the first year of therapy, and likely as effective as epinephrine in the long-term treatment of glaucoma.", 
    "50": "Reversal of cardiac hypertrophy has been obtained by treatment with some antihypertensive drugs but has not been achieved consistently with beta blockers. To investigate whether this difference might be explained by the distinct hemodynamic actions of the drugs, we studied the effects of propranolol and pindolol, beta blockers with distinct modes of action, on cardiac hypertrophy of hypertensive male Wistar rats, two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) Goldblatt model (n = 33) and sham-operated control rats (n = 34). We also assessed the effects of such therapies on the ventricular pumping ability during open-chest, transient aortic occlusion. Four weeks after surgery, propranolol (5 mg/kg/day p.o.) was given to hypertensive (n = 8) and control rats (n = 11); pindolol was also given orally (1 mg/kg/day) to similar groups (n = 7 and n = 5, respectively). Untreated animals served as controls for both groups. Cardiac hypertrophy developed with hypertension in the untreated rats of the propranolol (3.38 +/- 0.18 vs 2.60 +/- 0.08 mg/g; p less than 0.01) and pindolol groups (3.93 +/- 0.21 vs 2.40 +/- 0.03 mg/g; p less than 0.001). Treatment reversed cardiac hypertrophy in the pindolol-treated (3.01 +/- 0.19 vs 3.93 +/- 0.21 mg/g; p less than 0.001, NS) but not in the propranolol-treated rats (3.24 +/- 0.18 vs 3.38 +/- 0.21 mg/g, NS). The maximal pressure that developed during aortic occlusion in the propranolol group was similar to that observed in the pindolol group. These results indicate that cardiac hypertrophy is reversed by pindolol but not by propranolol, and that this reversal does not interfere with left ventricular pumping ability.",

    "53": "Plasma levels of propranolol after 2.5 mg kg-1 given i.v. and i.a. have been compared in 3- to 4-week-old rats to evaluate the effect of age on pulmonary first-pass elimination of the drug. In 5- to 52-week-old rats, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) after an intra-arterial dose was always larger than that after the i.v. dose. The plasma elimination half-lives after both routes of administration were almost identical, but tended to increase with age between weeks 7 and 104. First-pass pulmonary clearance and extraction ratio tended to decrease with age between weeks 7 and 52.", 
    "54": "For 11 commonly used drugs, the n-octanol/water partition coefficient (pH 7.4 temperature 37 degrees C) and solubility in n-octanol were determined. The drugs tested were chlorpromazine, amitriptyline, trazodone, dextropropoxyphene, diltiazem, dibucaine, amethocaine, procaine, quinidine, acetylsalicylic acid and paracetamol. For eight of the drugs, the relative lipid saturation corresponding to a fatal plasma concentration was estimated from the two parameters determined above and the median fatal blood concentrations reported in the literature. For five of those eight drugs, the estimated relative saturation in the lipid phase fell within the range 0.001-0.004 which is close to relative saturation figures in aqueous and vapour phases already published for chemicals possessing a non-specific or physical mechanism of toxicity. Since this is determined largely by their lipid solubility, it is probable that accumulation in the lipid phase is an important determinant of the lethal toxicity of drugs and chemicals with a non-specific mechanism of toxicity.", 
    "55": "Recent reports in the literature indicate that beta-blockade may improve survival in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). This goal can obviously not be attained if the beta-blocker employed effects deleterious actions on the left ventricular function or hemodynamics. Accordingly, to assess the suitability of the new beta-blocker ridazolol for use in this regard, in nine patients with DCMP NYHA class II/III, studies were performed (by means of balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter and radionuclide ventriculography) at rest and during exercise prior to and one hour after oral administration of a 40 mg-dose of the agent. At rest, there was a decreasing tendency in systolic blood pressure from 123 +/- 18.5 mm Hg to 113 +/- 15.2 mm Hg and heart rate from 94 +/- 19 beats/min to 83 +/- 17 beats/min. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was not significantly altered at 16.2 +/- 7.9 mm Hg and 17.1 +/- 8.4 mm Hg, respectively. Ejection fraction remained unchanged with 29 +/- 14%. The slight decrease in cardiac output from 5.1 +/- 1.3 l/min to 4.5 +/- 1.3 l/min was not significant. During exercise, there were also decreasing tendencies in the heart rate from 128 +/- 21 beats/min to 102 +/- 22 beats/min and the systolic blood pressure from 148 +/- 20.5 mm Hg to 141 +/- 18.4 mm Hg. Essentially unchanged were the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (26.1 +/- 7.2 mm Hg/27.8 +/- 5.0 mm Hg) and ejection fraction (30 +/- 10%/27 +/- 8%) during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was used to examine the hypothesis that phosphoinositide turnover is involved in the regulation of myocardial contractility mediated by stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors in the mammalian cardiac muscle. Exposure of the isolated rabbit papillary muscle electrically driven at a rate of 1 Hz at a temperature of 37 degrees C to TPA in concentrations of 10-1000 nmol/l for 30 min did not affect the basal force of contraction. The concentration-response curve for the positive inotropic effect of (-)-phenylephrine mediated by stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors in the presence of (+/-)-bupranolol (100 nmol/l) was shifted to the right and downward by TPA in concentrations of 30-1000 nmol/l, while the effect of (-)-phenylephrine mediated by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors in the presence of prazosin (100 nmol/l) was not decreased, but slightly enhanced by exposure of the muscle to relatively low concentrations of TPA (10-100 nmol/l). Incubation of the membrane fraction isolated from the rabbit ventricular muscle with TPA in vitro under the same condition as employed in the physiological experiments decreased the specific binding of [3H]prazosin but not that of [3H]CGP-12177, while the non-tumor promoting phorbol ester, alpha PDD, was ineffective. These results indicate that activation of protein kinase C by TPA does not mimic the positive inotropic effect of catecholamines mediated by activation of myocardial alpha-adrenoceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "The compatibility and stability of esmolol hydrochloride in admixtures during simulated Y-site injection of morphine sulfate or fentanyl citrate was studied. One milliliter of either morphine sulfate (15 mg/mL) or fentanyl citrate (0.05 mg/mL) was injected into a running infusion of esmolol hydrochloride (10 mg/mL) in 5% dextrose and 0.9% sodium chloride injection, and the solution was visually observed for changes. To determine the stability of the drugs during Y-site injection, esmolol hydrochloride 4 mL (1000 mg) in 5% dextrose and 0.9% sodium chloride injection was combined with 100 mL of either morphine sulfate 15 mg/mL or fentanyl citrate 0.05 mg/mL to simulate concentrations of the drugs that might be expected during Y-site injection. The admixtures were stored at ambient room temperature under normal light, and drug concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography at time zero and at two, four, and eight hours. Admixtures were also tested for pH and observed for visual changes. No immediate changes were observed in any of the admixtures, and the concentrations of the drugs varied by less than 4% throughout the study period. No precipitate or color changes were noted during Y-site injection of either drug into the running esmolol infusion. Under all of the conditions studied, esmolol hydrochloride in 5% dextrose and 0.9% sodium chloride injection is compatible with morphine sulfate or fentanyl citrate.",

Determinations were made before and 40 min after topical instillations of 3 X 10 microliters 10% phenylephrine, 0.5% thymoxamine, 1% adrenaline, 3% isoproterenol, 0.5% timolol and 0.5% betaxolol. Combinations of 3 X 10 microliters 0.5% thymoxamine + 10% phenylephrine, 0.5% timolol + 1% adrenaline and 0.5% betaxolol + 3% isoproterenol were also administered. The near point of accommodation decreased 0.8 +/- 0.3 diopter after instillations of the alpha 1 adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine, while an increase of 0.6 +/- 0.2 diopter was determined after administration of the alpha adrenoceptor antagonist thymoxamine. Thymoxamine plus phenylephrine did not alter the pretreatment values. Beta adrenoceptor stimulation by isoproterenol or beta adrenoceptor inhibition by timolol or betaxolol had no effect on the near point accommodation. The difference between distant refraction in daylight and darkness, that is low-luminance myopia, amounted to -1.25 +/- 0.1 diopter. Phenylephrine caused a myopic shift in distant refraction in daylight and darkness of 0.32 +/- 0.1 and 0.9 +/- 0.2 diopter, respectively. This effect was due to the mydriatic action of phenylephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "In an open multi-center study involving 768 patients the efficacy and tolerability of Carteolol eye drops as compared to other beta blockers were investigated. The patients started to use the new medication without a prior washout period. In patients who were well stabilized (57%), IOP either did not change when the medication was switched to Carteolol (73%) or it actually decreased. In 78% of the patients who had not responded altogether satisfactorily to the pretreatment, Carteolol eye drops lowered IOP to a tolerable level of 21 mm Hg or less without using any comedication. IOP remained hypertonic under Carteolol in only 19% of the cases. Fewer systemic and local side effects were observed under Carteolol therapy. Patients had fewer problems going upstairs. Burning after installation decreased by 25% to 2%. Even fluorescein-positive corneal findings almost completely disappeared under Carteolol.", 
    "60": "In order to clarify the pathological involvement of the sympathetic nervous system in the development of cardiomyopathy, a receptor-binding study was carried out on cardiomyopathic Syrian hamsters of strain BIO 14.6 (BIO) at 21 days (prenecrotic stage); 35-42 days (onset of cardiomyopathy); and 70-84 days of life (early cardiac hypertrophy). The newly developed alpha 1-blocker (bunazosin hydrochloride) was initially administered at doses of 100 micrograms/kg or 10 mg/kg to BIO hamsters at 21 days of life and continued for 70 days. At the onset of cardiomyopathy and early cardiac hypertrophy, there was an increase in the number of alpha 1-receptors in the BIO hamsters compared to controls, but there were no significant changes at the prenecrotic stage. On histopathological examination, 10 mg/kg bunazosin had a significant beneficial effect on cardiomyopathy [area of necrosis 1.38% in untreated vs 0.33% in treated animals; area of calcification 2.70% (untreated) vs 0.60% (treated); area of all myocardial injuries 6.97% (untreated) vs 3.19% (treated)]. However, 100 micrograms/kg bunazosin had no effect. It was concluded that the increase in the number of alpha 1-receptors may not be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy but that alpha 1-receptors could be implicated in the later progression of the condition.", 
    "61": "1. The effects of atenolol administration on maximal exercise capacity and exercise haemodynamics have been compared in eight normotensive and eight mildly hypertensive subjects, matched for sex, age, body weight, and maximal oxygen uptake, and familiar with maximal exercise testing. 2. Supine and exercise blood pressure, and exercise total peripheral resistance were significantly higher, and exercise cardiac output was significantly lower in the hypertensive than in the normotensive subjects. 3. Administration of atenolol (1 X 100 mg day-1) for 3 days reduced supine and exercise systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output, and increased exercise stroke volume. Supine and exercise diastolic blood pressure and exercise total peripheral resistance were unaffected by atenolol. The effects of atenolol did not differ in the normotensive and the hypertensive subjects. 4. Maximal work load, maximal oxygen uptake, and maximal heart rate were reduced to a similar extent in normotensive and hypertensive subjects during atenolol treatment. 5. It is concluded that there is no difference in the effects of short-term atenolol administration on exercise haemodynamics and maximal exercise capacity in normotensive and mildly hypertensive subjects.", 
    "62": "1. The populations of alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of genetically obese Zucker rats (fa/fa) were studied with [3H]prazosin and [3H]CGP-12177 respectively. 2. The density of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in BAT was significantly lower in obese than in lean Zucker rats, both at 2-4 months of age and at 6 weeks of age. The density of beta-adrenergic receptors was identical in BAT of lean and obese 6-week-old Zucker rats. 3. Cold-acclimation increased the alpha 1-receptor density significantly in BAT of both lean and obese Zucker rats, and the number of beta-receptors was also somewhat increased. 4. Sucrose feeding did not affect the density of alpha 1-receptors in BAT of lean or obese Zucker rats, but it increased beta-receptor density. 5. Adrenalectomy restored the density of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in BAT of obese Zucker rats to the value observed in lean rats. 6. It is concluded that there is a direct correlation between alpha 1-receptor density and tissue recruitment, and that alpha 1-receptor density is thus positively correlated with sympathetic activity. beta-Receptor density is apparently better correlated with feeding conditions.", 
    "63": "We studied the effects of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on general circulatory and metabolic responses to moderate (FIO2 = 0.09) acute hypoxemia in newborn (protocol 1) and 3-wk-old (protocol 2) lambs, and on regional blood flow distribution in newborn lambs (protocol 1). Via a left thoracotomy we placed an electromagnetic flow transducer around the ascending aorta and inserted various vascular catheters. After 2 days of recovery, the lambs were studied. In protocol 1, we measured cardiovascular variables and regional blood flow distribution during control conditions, after 45 min of acute hypoxemia, and after 0.5 mg/kg of propranolol during acute hypoxemia. In protocol 2, we measured cardiovascular variables during control conditions and after 45 min of acute hypoxemia with and without propranolol pretreatment. In both groups, propranolol limited the increase in cardiac output and heart rate caused by hypoxemia, and thus decreased oxygen delivery. However, propranolol also decreased oxygen consumption so that pulmonary arterial pO2 was either higher (protocol 1) or the same (protocol 2) as during acute hypoxemia alone. Neither metabolic acidosis nor hypothermia ensued. In protocol 1, propranolol decreased renal, carcass, and most importantly, myocardial blood flows. However, myocardial O2 consumption also fell, coronary sinus pO2 increased, and blood was redistributed toward the subendocardium, suggesting that myocardial perfusion improved. Thus, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade during acute moderate hypoxemia may have a beneficial effect by reducing total body and myocardial oxygen demand in excess of the reduction in oxygen delivery.", 
    "64": "The changes in cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration and density of beta-adrenoceptors caused by electrical stimulation of the sympathetic innervation to parotid and submandibular glands of rat did not occur when the alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists, phentolamine, and propranolol were administered 20 min prior to initiation of stimulation. They also did not occur when phentolamine, the beta-adrenergic antagonist, was administered alone prior to nerve stimulation, indicating that beta-adrenoceptors mediate these effects. Simultaneous administration of the alpha- and beta-antagonists also prevented the changes in densities of muscarinic receptors and cGMP concentrations usually induced by sympathetic nerve stimulation. Also, the changes in muscarinic receptors and cGMP did not occur when atropine was administered prior to nerve stimulation, nor did they occur with simultaneous administration of atropine, phentolamine + propranolol; with phentolamine alone, or propranolol alone, the effects were blocked to a large extent. Secretion was inhibited completely when both adrenergic antagonists were present during nerve stimulation, but flow rate was unchanged when atropine was present. The changes in both beta-adrenoceptors and muscarinic receptors reflect a desensitization caused by prolonged exposure to neurotransmitters released when the sympathetic nerve is stimulated. The changes are prevented when either atropine or adrenergic antagonists are present during nerve stimulation.", 
    "65": "The ontogeny of functional sympathetic neural, adrenal medullary, and extra-adrenal components of adrenergic control of heart rate was compared in neonatal Spontaneously hypertensive (SHR), Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Borderline hypertensive (BHR) rats using combined sequential pharmacological blockade and surgical intervention. Baseline heart rate recorded from awake and unrestrained pups was lower in BHR than in WKY or SHR at 5 days of age. Tonic sympathetic neural control of heart rate was inferred from bradycardia after treatment with the adrenergic neuron-blocking agent, bretylium tosylate. Bradycardia after bretylium treatment was observed at 2, 5 and 8 days of age in all strains, suggesting tonic sympathetic neural control of heart rate during the first postnatal week. Parasympathetic control of heart rate was inferred from heart rate increase after treatment with the muscarinic receptor blocker, atropine methyl nitrate, in pups pretreated with bretylium. Tachycardia following atropine methyl nitrate was substantial in all 24-day-old pups. Control of heart rate by neurally mediated release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla was inferred from bradycardia following administration of the ganglionic blocking agent, hexamethonium, to pups pretreated with bretylium and atropine methyl nitrate. Heart rate decreases after hexamethonium were found in 2-day-old WKY and BHR pups, and at 5 and 8 days in all strains. Adrenalectomy was performed in additional animals to confirm the adrenal catecholamine influence on heart rate. The influence of residual circulating catecholamines on neonatal heart rate was inferred from bradycardia following administration of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, atenolol, in pups pretreated with bretylium, methylatropine, and hexamethonium. Bradycardia was observed in pups of each strain and at all ages after atenolol treatment. Strain differences in autonomic controls of heart rate were most pronounced at 24 days of age. At 24 days of age both SHR and BHR pups showed increased adrenal catecholamine and parasympathetic influences on heart rate compared to WKY. Thus, prior to weaning, rats differing in their genetic predisposition to hypertension showed a unique pattern of autonomic control over heart rate which may be related to adult cardiovascular regulation.", 
    "66": "The risks of complications like death, myocardial infarction and stroke increase continuously with increasing age. Therefore, the chances of detecting effects of treatment in trials also increase when patients get older. The relationships between different end-points change with age, e.g. the ratio between stroke and MI increases with age. However, interventions not related to the interventions under study may also increase, causing dilution of effects. The older subject may also be more vulnerable to the side-effects of treatment. Side-effects, and quality-of-life measures, which indeed may vary with age, must be properly balanced against effects on 'hard' end-points. A review of trials in patients with hypertension and myocardial infarction shows that effects of various interventions have been at least as great in older as in younger patients. However, metabolic side effects such as impaired glucose metabolism, increased serum creatinine, and increased uric acid levels have not been negligible, and such effects may turn out to be more hazardous in the elderly than in younger patients. The balance between positive and negative effects must be properly assessed in relation to the prognosis of the untreated condition. Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction have, in general, a more serious prognosis than most hypertensives, and more side-effects of treatment may therefore be accepted in patients with myocardial infarction.", 
    "67": "The European Myocardial Infarction Project (E.M.I.P.) participants have evaluated out-of-hospital coronary care services in different cities within the E.E.C. and concluded that these facilities would support a study within these European centres on pre-hospital intervention in myocardial infarction. Based on a pilot study of 2443 patients with suspected myocardial infarction, simple criteria based on chest pain and first ECG finding have been defined to allow selection of out-of-hospital patients for a trial of pre-hospital drug evaluation. Pre-hospital treatment should reduce delay to intervention by about 1 h.", 
    "68": "A study on the development of biphasic insulin release and sensitivity to inhibitors has been performed using perifused rat pancreas at 19.5 days of gestation (3 days before birth) and at 3 days after birth. In the fetal pancreas, 16.7 mM glucose caused a marked stimulation of insulin release that did not, however, manifest a biphasic response and was not inhibited by verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker. This suggested that the immature response was due to either a lack of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels or their failure to open in response to glucose. Depolarizing concentrations of KCl stimulated insulin release, which was inhibited by verapamil, demonstrating that functional Ca2+ channels were present. In the presence of 16.7 mM glucose, quinine, which blocks glucose-sensitive k+ channels, potentiated the response of the fetal pancreas that now became sensitive to verapamil, demonstrating that functional K+ channels were also present in the fetal pancreatic beta-cell. The immaturity of the response is not due specifically to a defect in glucose metabolism; rather the metabolism of nutrient secretagogues fails to couple with the K+ channel in the fetal islet and thus fails to depolarize the beta-cell membrane. Three days after birth the pattern of response to high glucose is biphasic. Insulin release in fetal pancreas was inhibited by epinephrine and somatostatin.", 
    "69": "The pathophysiology of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) seems to be based on a cybernetic imbalance of the central nervous system (CNS), with activation of secondary peripheral effectors (PE). Lung vascular hyperpermeability is a crucial feature of PE actions in ARDS. Kinins (Bk), as PE, are important vascular hyperpermeability-inducing factors, with potential participation in ARDS induction. To test this hypothesis, we produced experimental ARDS in male Wistar rats using the anterior hypothalamic nuclei lesion model. Adrenalectomy, adrenal demedullation and denervation, alpha-adrenergic blockade, and catecholamine (CA) depletion reduced ARDS severity whereas beta-adrenergic blocking and CA uptake I inhibition resulted in a potentiated aspect. The Bk depletion or inhibition of the generation of these peptides resulted in attenuation of the pathologic features of ARDS. Bk half-life prolongation produced intense potentiation of the respiratory syndrome. This work suggests that Bk and CA systems are interactive and interdependent in their pathogenic actions on lungs in ARDS, involving, probably, a reciprocally-activating mechanism.", 
    "70": "We evaluated the response to salt restriction in hypertensive patients receiving drugs. By restricting their salt intake to less than 80 mmol of sodium per day for 3 months, 50% of patients reaching goal compliance were able to discontinue diuretics. The literature also reveals responses to a low salt diet. Salt restriction augmented the hypotensive effect of chlorthalidone in two investigations, but not in another, and the hypotensive effect of beta-blockers in three trials. Sodium intake of 10 mmol/day caused a much greater decrease in blood pressure in response to a single dose of captopril than did a sodium diet of 200 mmol/day. In patients receiving various fixed regimens for 2 months, salt restriction decreased blood pressure in all but those receiving calcium blockers. A single dose of nifedipine lowered blood pressure more in patients receiving 350 mmol of sodium per day than in the same patients given 150 or 10 mmol/day. Verapamil for 3 days was more effective in patients receiving 212 mmol of sodium per day than in the same subjects receiving 9 mmol/day. Nitrendipine caused a greater decrease in diastolic blood pressure in patients who did not reduce salt intake compared to those who did. Salt restriction appears useful in salt-sensitive patients who receive beta-blockers, diuretics, converting enzyme inhibitors, or centrally acting drugs. Calcium channel entry blockers may not require salt restriction to maximize their effect.", 
    "71": "We report the results of a multicenter trial in which nitrendipine, alone or in combination with a diuretic, a beta-blocker, or both, was administered to 114 patients with severe hypertension (greater than or equal to 115 mm Hg). Nitrendipine was titrated in doses of 5 to 30 mg b.i.d. If blood pressure was not controlled with nitrendipine alone, hydrochlorothiazide or propranolol or both were added. After a mean of 29 days in the study, 96 (90%) of 107 patients reached the initial goal of therapy; in 44 (41%) given nitrendipine alone the mean decrease in supine blood pressure was 38/25 mm Hg. After a mean of 91 days, 69 (72%) of 96 patients achieved the final goal of therapy; in 24 (25%) patients given nitrendipine alone the mean supine blood pressure decrease from baseline was 49/33 mm Hg. Falls in blood pressure were comparable in the patients given drug combinations. Seventy-two of 114 patients given study drug(s) had adverse experiences; headache and edema were the most frequent complaints. Only four patients dropped out of the study because of adverse effects. Most abnormal laboratory values occurred when nitrendipine was given with hydrochlorothiazide or propranolol or both. Analysis of severely hypertensive patients followed up in our Virginia center revealed continued control of blood pressure after long-term follow-up (43 +/- 3 [SD] months). Average supine blood pressure was reduced from 180/121 +/- 21/5 to 140/90 +/- 16/9 (SD) mm Hg (p less than 0.001). It was concluded that the calcium antagonist nitrendipine, alone or in combination with a diuretic or beta-blocker or both, is effective in the treatment of severe hypertension.", 
    "72": "We evaluated 74 peripheral vascular disease (PVD) patients (54 men, age 61 +/- 7 years and 17 women, age 63 +/- 7 years) for potential coronary heart disease (CAD) using an arm exercise test (AET) protocol. All patients performed upright two-arm cranking using discontinuous stages of 2 minutes of exercise separated by 2 minutes of rest. Exercise intensity was increased by +100 or 200 kpm (kilopond meters) with each stage. ECG was monitored continuously and blood pressure and 12-lead ECG tracings were obtained at the end of each exercise stage. All patients reached an endpoint of subjective exhaustion. Men achieved 91 +/- 14% of age-predicted heart rate at 597 +/- 167 kpm, while women achieved 86 +/- 14% of age-predicted heart rate at 335 +/- 117 kpm. Ischemic ECG responses (+AET) defined as new or additional ST depression greater than 1.0 mm X 80 ms, occurred in 35 men (65%) and 7 women (42%). Coronary angiography was performed in a subset of 22 patients (15 males and 7 females). CAD (greater than 70% stenosis) was found in 11 of 12 men and 4 of 5 women who showed positive or strongly positive AET responses (overall predictive value for AET = 88%). We conclude that arm exercise stress testing is safely performed in PVD patients who cannot complete treadmill exercise. In this limited series of PVD patients, the predictive value of a +AET response for diagnosis of CAD is similar to established values for treadmill exercise.", 
    "73": "Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias frequently complicate myocardial revascularization. Intravenous administration of verapamil has been effective in terminating these arrhythmias. To determine the effects of verapamil on left ventricular systolic function, we implanted ultrasonic dimension transducers in dogs and, after they had recovered from the operation, studied them while they were awake and unsedated. Intravenous administration of verapamil (0.2 mg/kg) resulted in an elevation of cardiac output above baseline because of reflex-induced tachycardia. Contractility, as measured by the load-independent end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, remained unchanged. When the animals were pretreated with atropine and propranolol, verapamil resulted in a fall in cardiac output and contractility. The intact animal responded to the vasodilatory effect of verapamil by releasing catecholamines to maintain cardiac output and hemodynamic stability. Only when this compensatory mechanism was blocked by a beta-adrenergic blocker do the inherently negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of verapamil become apparent. The clinical ramifications of this finding are of greater importance to the surgeon as more patients receive beta-adrenergic blocking agents up to the time of the immediate preoperative period. We conclude that verapamil should be administered with caution to patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias who have been receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents.", 
    "74": "6-[4-[3-[[2-Hydroxy-3-[4-[2- (cyclopropylmethoxy)ethyl]phenoxy]propyl]amino]propionamido] phenyl]- 5-methyl-4,5-dihydro-3(2H)-pyridazinone (3) consists of a mixture of four stereoisomers, i.e., two racemates, as a consequence of the two asymmetric centers contained in the structure. An approximately equimolar mixture of these two racemates exhibits a novel combination of vasodilation and beta-adrenergic antagonist activity. This paper describes the synthesis of each of the four possible stereoisomers of 3 and provides clear evidence for the different pharmacological profile of each of the stereoisomers. The RA,SB isomer 3a has an overall profile slightly better than the complete mixture; the other three isomers all show reduced activity as vasodilators and/or beta-adrenergic antagonists.", 
    "75": "A series of new 6-[4-[[(aryloxy)acyl]amino]phenyl]-4,5-dihydropyridazinones have been synthesized and evaluated as combined vasodilator/beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and potential antihypertensive agents. Many of the early compounds displayed an unacceptably high level of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) and a relatively short duration of action. Disubstitution in the 2,3-positions or in the 4-position of the aryloxy ring gave compounds with low ISA levels and, in some instances, improved duration of action. All of the compounds were vasodilators, but the 5-methylpyridazinone derivatives showed consistently greater antihypertensive activity than their 5-H lower homologues. Further detailed pharmacological investigations led to the selection of 6-[4-[3-[[2-hydroxy-3-[4-[2- (cyclopropylmethoxy)ethyl]phenoxy]propyl]amino]propionamido] phenyl]- 5-methyl-4,5-dihydro-3(2H)-pyridazinone (4t) (SK&F 95018) as a development candidate.", 
    "76": "(Acyloxy)alkyl carbamates of the type R1R2N-CO-O-CHR3-OCO-R4 are described as novel bioreversible prodrugs for primary and secondary amines. These were prepared either by a one-step reaction involving nucleophilic attack on p-nitrophenyl alpha-(acyloxy)alkyl carbonates with displacement of p-nitrophenol or by reaction of alpha-haloalkyl carbamates with silver or mercury salts of carboxylic acids. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the ester bond in these ester carbamates leads to a cascade reaction resulting in rapid regeneration of the parent amine. Permeability measurements of such nonionic derivatives of atenolol, betaxolol, pindolol, propranolol, and timolol through fuzzy rat skin and rabbit cornea mounted on diffusion cells show that derivatization of the hydrophilic beta-blockers results in several-fold increase in permeation through these biological membranes. However, prodrug modification of the lipophilic beta-blockers leads to little advantage in permeability characteristics.", 
    "77": "Esmolol is a new intravenous beta-adrenergic blocker with an ultrashort (nine-minute) elimination half-life, which has been studied predominantly for control of supraventricular tachycardia and management of certain types of hypertension. Clinical studies indicate that the efficacy of esmolol is equivalent to that of propranolol and verapamil for control of supraventricular tachycardia and to sodium nitroferricyanide (sodium nitroprusside) for control of postoperative hypertension. Esmolol also has been shown to control heart rate and blood pressure during episodes of acute myocardial ischemia. Cardioselectivity is similar to that of metoprolol, and the ability to titrate the effect of esmolol may provide additional assurance that beta-adrenergic blockade will remain within the cardioselective range. The most commonly observed adverse effect seen in clinical trials was asymptomatic hypotension. Hypotension may be minimized by titrating to the minimum effective dose and is readily reversed within 10 to 30 minutes of discontinuing the infusion of esmolol. These unique features represent advantages of great potential merit in critical care medicine.", 
    "78": "Autonomic neurohormones affect the secretory activity of neutrophils by modulating release of lysosomal enzymes in response to immunologic stimuli. Autonomic agents are also weak bases which might modify cell function by accumulating in the acidic interior of the lysosome, in addition to their receptor-mediated activity. We examined the association of the beta-adrenergic antagonist [3H]dihydroalprenolol with human neutrophils and lysosome and membrane fractions derived from neutrophils, and the subcellular distribution of the photoaffinity-labeled beta-adrenergic ligand [3H]azidobenzylcarazolol after incubation with intact cells. Isolated neutrophil lysosomes accumulated significantly more [3H]dihydroalprenolol than isolated membrane preparations. Decreasing the transmembrane pH gradient markedly reduced [3H]dihydroalprenolol accumulation by intact cells or lysosomes but not by membranes. Since [3H]dihydroalprenolol accumulated by intact cells remained rapidly exchangeable, the photoaffinity ligand [3H]azidobenzylcarazolol was used to assess ligand distribution after association with whole cells. After cell disruption, 18.5 +/- 1.3% of this ligand appeared in the lysosome fraction as compared to 2.2 +/- 0.6% in the membrane fraction. The secretagogue phorbol myristate acetate caused release of the ligand as well as lysosomal enzymes from cells. These findings suggest that there is significant pH-dependent lysosomal accumulation of beta-antagonists. This lysosomotropic interaction may be important both as it affects the sequestration and redistribution of the drugs, and as it might in some circumstances affect host defense functions of the neutrophil.", 
    "79": "1. Calcium antagonists, including verapamil, are now used widely in the management of patients with hypertension. 2. Six weeks of chronic therapy with verapamil (50 mg/kg per day, orally) to produce a plasma level of 80-100 ng/ml in Sprague-Dawley rats depletes cardiac noradrenaline (NA) without apparently causing beta 1 adrenoceptor 'up' regulation. 3. The effect of verapamil on cardiac NA is rapidly reversed upon verapamil withdrawal. 4. Chronic therapy with nisoldipine (100 mg/kg per day, orally) had no effect on cardiac NA. 5. Verapamil (50 mg/kg per day, orally) and nisoldipine (100 mg/kg per day, orally) therapy for 6 weeks prevented the time-dependent increase in systolic blood pressure in SHR rats. 6. Binding studies with (-)[3H]-D888 (desmethoxyverapamil) indicated that the affinity of the phenylalkylamine binding sites is higher in hearts of SHR relative to hearts from age-matched (25 weeks) WKY and SD, without any change in density."
