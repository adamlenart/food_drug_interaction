Bilateral ovariectomy or a sham operation in female C57BL/6 mice and BALB/c nude mice was performed when they were seven weeks of age. The C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with phosphate-buffered serum (PBS), 5 \u03bcg/kg \u03b2-estradiol five times per week for three weeks, or 10 mg/kg TNF-\u03b1 blocker three times per week for three weeks. Bony sclerostin expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry staining in their femurs. The activity and expression of myocyte enhancer factors 2 (MEF2), which is essential for the transcriptional activation of sclerostin, in rat UMR-106 osteosarcoma cells were determined by luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis, respectively. Bony sclerostin expression was stimulated by estrogen deficiency and it was reversed by estradiol supplementation. When the UMR-106 cells were treated with well-known, estrogen-regulated cytokines, only TNF-\u03b1, but not IL-1 and IL-6, increased the MEF2 activity. Consistently, TNF-\u03b1 also increased the nuclear MEF2 expression. Furthermore, the TNF-\u03b1 blocker prevented the stimulation of bony sclerostin expression by ovariectomy. We also found that there was no difference in sclerostin expression between ovariectomized nude mice and sham-operated nude mice. In conclusion, these results suggest that TNF-\u03b1 originating from T cells may be at least in part responsible for stimulating the sclerostin expression observed in an estrogen-deficient condition.", 
    "1": "The main characteristic of infantile hemangioma is that it grows rapidly after birth and mostly regresses spontaneously. It is a common practice for only a small part of the hemangioma to be treated, as they can be extremely disfiguring and destructive to normal tissue as well as possibly being life-threatening. Recent studies have discovered that the use of topical 0.5% timolol maleate gel is a new therapy option for infantile hemangioma. We have treated two children with hemangioma in our pediatric day center with topical timolol gel (Nyogel). We examined the children before the therapy and took photographs of the hemangioma. After a period of two weeks, pictures were re-taken and compared. A significant change in color from dark red to a lighter shade of red and partially even to skin color could be detected. The treatment outcome of our cases indicates that timolol gel is well-tolerated and effective for the therapy for infantile hemangioma. We further want to highlight the necessity to treat even small hemangiomas, as a reliable prediction of the possible extent of the expansion and involution does not exist.",

    "3": "Among 305 patients from the European Registry of LF/LGAS, the outcomes of the 107 patients followed under conservative treatment were analysed. Based on the results of dobutamine echocardiography, patients were divided into group IA [left ventricular (LV) contractile reserve present with true-severe AS, n = 43], group IB [pseudo-severe AS (n = 29) defined as LV contractile reserve with a final aortic valve area \u22651.2 cm(2) and a mean transaortic pressure gradient <40 mmHg at peak dobutamine infusion], or group II (exhausted LV contractile reserve, n = 35). The rate of death within 5 years was significantly lower in the group IB (43 \u00b1 11%, n = 10), when compared with the group IA (91 \u00b1 6%, n = 33; P = 0.001) and the group II (100%, n = 23; P < 0.001). The Cox proportional hazard model analysis demonstrated that the hazard ratio for death in the group IB remained significantly lower than in the other groups, even after adjustment for currently established risk factors. Furthermore, the 5-year survival of pseudo-severe AS patients was comparable with that of propensity-matched patients with systolic heart failure and no evidence of valve disease.", 
    "4": "In patients with pseudo-severe AS, the 5-year survival under conservative treatment is better than in true-severe AS and comparable with that of propensity-matched patients with LV systolic dysfunction and no evidence of valve disease.

Initial efficacy of ILE was shown in the setting of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST), but recent case reports suggest its consideration in a variety of other drug toxicities. In this review, we will summarize the experimental evidence as well as the clinical experience in using ILE as an antidote. Specifically, we will look at the evidence for using ILE in LAST as well as toxicity due to beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and tricyclic antidepressants. We will also review the current dosing recommendations as well as potential side effects of ILE as an antidote.", 
    "6": "Human atrial transient outward K(+) current (I(TO)) is decreased in a variety of cardiac pathologies, but how I(TO) reduction alters action potentials (APs) and arrhythmia mechanisms is poorly understood, owing to non-selectivity of I(TO) blockers. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of selective I(TO) changes on AP shape and duration (APD), and on afterdepolarisations or abnormal automaticity with \u03b2-adrenergic-stimulation, using the dynamic-clamp technique in atrial cells. Human and rabbit atrial cells were isolated by enzymatic dissociation, and electrical activity recorded by whole-cell-patch clamp (35-37\u00b0C). Dynamic-clamp-simulated I(TO) reduction or block slowed AP phase 1 and elevated the plateau, significantly prolonging APD, in both species. In human atrial cells, I(TO) block (100% I(TO) subtraction) increased APD(50) by 31%, APD(90) by 17%, and APD(-61 mV) (reflecting cellular effective refractory period) by 22% (P < 0.05 for each). Interrupting I(TO) block at various time points during repolarisation revealed that the APD(90) increase resulted mainly from plateau-elevation, rather than from phase 1-slowing or any residual I(TO). In rabbit atrial cells, partial I(TO) block (\u223c40% I(TO) subtraction) reversibly increased the incidence of cellular arrhythmic depolarisations (CADs; afterdepolarisations and/or abnormal automaticity) in the presence of the \u03b2-agonist isoproterenol (0.1 \u03bcm; ISO), from 0% to 64% (P < 0.05). ISO-induced CADs were significantly suppressed by dynamic-clamp increase in I(TO) (\u223c40% I(TO) addition). ISO+I(TO) decrease-induced CADs were abolished by \u03b2(1)-antagonism with atenolol at therapeutic concentration (1 \u03bcm). Atrial cell action potential changes from selective I(TO) modulation, shown for the first time using dynamic-clamp, have the potential to influence reentrant and non-reentrant arrhythmia mechanisms, with implications for both the development and treatment of atrial fibrillation.", 
    "7": "Patients with resistant hypertension are at risk for poor outcomes. Medication adherence and intensification improve blood pressure (BP) control; however, little is known about these processes or their association with outcomes in resistant hypertension. This retrospective study included patients from 2002 to 2006 with incident hypertension from 2 health systems who developed resistant hypertension or uncontrolled BP despite adherence to \u22653 antihypertensive medications. Patterns of hypertension treatment, medication adherence (percentage of days covered), and treatment intensification (increase in medication class or dose) were described in the year after resistant hypertension identification. Then, the association between medication adherence and intensification with 1-year BP control was assessed controlling for patient characteristics. Of the 3550 patients with resistant hypertension, 49% were male, and mean age was 60 years. One year after resistance hypertension determination, fewer patients were taking diuretics (77.7% versus 92.2%; P<0.01), \u03b2-blockers (71.2% versus 79.4%; P<0.01), and angiotensinogen-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (64.8% versus 70.1%; P<0.01) compared with baseline. Rates of BP control improved over 1 year (22% versus 55%; P<0.01). During this year, adherence was not associated with 1-year BP control (adjusted odds ratio, 1.18 [95% CI: 0.94-1.47]). Treatment was intensified in 21.6% of visits with elevated BP. Increasing treatment intensity was associated with 1-year BP control (adjusted odds ratio, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.58-1.71]). In this cohort of patients with resistant hypertension, treatment intensification but not medication adherence was significantly associated with 1-year BP control. These findings highlight the need to investigate why patients with uncontrolled BP do not receive treatment intensification.",

    "17": "An infantile haemangioma (IH) is a benign tumour of infancy. The standard approach to uncomplicated lesions is 'wait and see', but active intervention is sometimes preferred to avoid the unpredictable risk of cosmetic disfigurement. Topical beta-blockers were recently introduced as an effective alternative in such cases, but data are still lacking. We report the initial phase of a prospective study evaluating the efficacy and safety of topical timolol gel for IH, and present the interim analysis of the first 25 patients who completed a 6-month course of treatment. These 25 patients, with 39 localized, superficial haemangiomas, were treated with timolol 0.1% gel for 6 months and evaluated at 4-week intervals using the Physician's Global Assessment Score; the mean change was an 85% improvement from baseline, and complete clearance was achieved in four children. The treatment was more effective for plaque than for nodular lesions, and for proliferating than for involuting lesions. No side-effects were seen or reported. These early data confirm that timolol is a very effective and relatively safe treatment for small, localized, superficial IHs.", 
    "18": "Preventing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could have a significant positive impact on military readiness and quality of life. Few studies have examined whether pharmacological agents may prevent PTSD, and there has not been a systematic and critical review of these studies in order to guide future research efforts. We performed a literature review of articles examining the use of pharmacological agents for the prevention of PTSD. A total of 27 articles met inclusion criteria for the review and their results are summarized. The review points to corticosteroids and propranolol as the most promising agents for future research. Gamma-Amino butyric acid mimetic drugs received the least support. Complementary approaches using psychotherapy and pharmacological agents could also yield good results. Research aimed at determining the potential efficacy of these agents could start being carried out in the field with smaller numbers of personnel that has not been personally injured but have witnessed traumatic events. In addition, psychological interventions immediately after postdeployment could be used in large numbers of soldiers. Preliminary studies regarding the use of pharmacologic agents for the secondary prevention of PTSD are promising.

    "19": "Cirrhosis is a major health problem, being the 5th cause of death in the U.K. and 12th in the U.S., but 4th in the 45 to 54 age group. Until recently cirrhosis was considered a single and terminal disease stage, with an inevitably poor prognosis. However, it is now clear that 1-year mortality can range from 1% in early cirrhosis to 57% in decompensated disease. As the only treatment for advanced cirrhosis is liver transplantation, what is urgently needed is strategies to prevent transition to decompensated stages. The evidence we present in this review clearly demonstrates that management of patients with cirrhosis should change from an expectant algorithm that treats complications as they occur, to preventing the advent of all complications while in the compensated phase. This requires maintaining patients in an asymptomatic phase and not significantly affecting their quality of life with minimal impairment due to the therapies themselves. This could be achieved with lifestyle changes and combinations of already licensed and low-cost drugs, similar to the paradigm of treating risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The drugs are propranolol, simvastatin, norfloxacin, and warfarin, which in combination would cost \u00a3128/patient annually-equivalent to U.S. $196/year. This treatment strategy requires randomized controlled trials to establish improvements in outcomes. In the 21st century, cirrhosis should be regarded as a potentially treatable disease with currently available and inexpensive therapies.",

We found that pain-related behavior was inhibited by intrathecal landiolol administration. Moreover, the increase in c-fos mRNA expression on the formalin-injected side was less pronounced in rats administered landiolol than in saline administered controls.

A two-phase, randomized, single-blind, crossover study was carried out in 18 healthy male volunteers with different genotypes of ABCB1, including C3435C (CC, n = 6), C3435T (CT, n = 6) and T3435T (TT, n = 6). The pharmacokinetics of talinolol were measured after co-administration of placebo or 1000\u2009mg curcumin capsules once daily for 14 days. The AUC(0-48 h) and AUC(0-\u221e) of talinolol were increased by 67.0% (95% CI: 1.09~2.25; p = 0.002) and 80.8% (95% CI: 0.92~2.69; p = 0.005) respectively with curcumin co-administration. The C(max) of talinolol was significantly higher after curcumin administration as compared with placebo (p = 0.029).The CL/F of talinolol was decreased by 25.9% (p = 0.005) during the curcumin-treated phase. No significant change in t(max) and t(1/2) of talinolol were observed between the placebo- and curcumin-treated phases. AUC(0-48), AUC(0-\u221e), C(max) of talinolol were extensively increased and CL(oral)/F decreased in TT subjects. Co-administration of curcumin significantly increased the plasma concentration of talinolol in healthy volunteers. The effect of curcumin on talinolol was associated with ABCB1 genotypes (C3435T).",

The reaction recurred with drug rechallenge and resolved when the drug was ceased.", 
    "49": "Midthoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with enhanced sympathetic support of heart rate as well as myocardial damage related to calcium overload. The myocardial damage may elicit an enhanced sympathetic support of contractility to maintain ventricular function. In contrast, the level of inotropic drive may be reduced to match the lower afterload that results from the injury-induced reduction in arterial pressure. Accordingly, the inotropic response to midthoracic SCI may be increased or decreased but has not been investigated and therefore remains unknown. Furthermore, the altered ventricular function may be associated with anatomical changes in cardiac sympathetic innervation. To determine the inotropic drive following midthoracic SCI, a telemetry device was used for repeated measurements of left ventricular (LV) function, with and without beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, in rats before and after midthoracic SCI or sham SCI. In addition, NGF content (ELISA) and dendritic arborization (cholera toxin B immunohistochemistry and Sholl analysis) of cardiac-projecting sympathetic postganglionic neurons in the stellate ganglia were determined. Midthoracic SCI was associated with an enhanced sympathetic support of heart rate, dP/dt(+), and dP/dt(-). Importantly, cardiac function was lower following blockade of the sympathetic nervous system in rats with midthoracic SCI compared with sham-operated rats. Finally, these functional neuroplastic changes were associated with an increased NGF content and structural neuroplasticity within the stellate ganglia. Results document impaired LV function with codirectional changes in chronotropic and inotropic responses following midthoracic SCI. These functional changes were associated with a dynamic interaction between the heart and its sympathetic innervation.",

Alkyl-phosphate adsorbents were obtained by modification of aminopropyl silica gel. The structures of the synthesized materials were confirmed by use of instrumental techniques--elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and (13)C and (29)Si CP/MAS NMR. Analysis revealed that the adsorbents mimic the phospholipids present in natural cell membranes. The new synthesized alkyl-phosphate stationary phases may be used for liquid chromatographic separation of biologically active compounds of different polarity.", 
    "51": "We combine laboratory-based timolol release studies and in vivo pharmacodynamics studies in beagle dogs to evaluate the efficacy of glaucoma therapy through extended wear contact lenses. Commercial contact lenses cannot provide extended delivery of ophthalmic drugs and so the studies here focused on increasing the release duration of timolol from ACUVUE TruEye contact lenses by incorporating vitamin E diffusion barriers. The efficacy of timolol delivered via extended wear contact lenses was then compared to eye drops in beagle dogs that suffer from spontaneous glaucoma. The lenses were either replaced every 24h or continuously worn for 4 days, and the pharmacodynamics effect of changes in the intraocular pressure (IOP) of timolol from the ACUVUE TruEye contact lenses can be significantly increased by incorporation of vitamin E. The in vivo studies showed that IOP reduction from baseline by pure contact lens on daily basis was comparable with that by eye drops but with only 20% of drug dose, which suggested higher drug bioavailability for contact lenses. In addition, by inclusion of vitamin E into the lenses, the IOP was reduced significantly during the 4-day treatment with continuous wear of lens.",

Atenolol and the internal standard, metoprolol, were extracted from plasma by using a liquid-liquid extraction method. The method was developed on an Ace C18 reverse-phase column using a mobile phase of methanol-water (50:50, v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The calibration curve was linear within the concentration range of 5-150 ng/mL. Intra-day and inter-day precision values for atenolol in plasma were less than 6.1, and accuracy (relative error) was better than 5.5%. The mean recovery of atenolol was 98.4% for plasma. The limits of detection and quantification of atenolol were 1.5 and 5 ng/mL, respectively. Also, this assay was successfully applied to six patients with hypertension who had been given an oral tablet of 50 mg atenolol.", 
    "53": "Multiple lines of evidence indicate that regional brain eicosanoid signaling is important in initiation and progression of neurodegenerative conditions that have neuroinflammatory pathologic component, such as AD. We hypothesized that PGE(2) receptor subtype 1 (EP1) signaling (linked to intracellular Ca(2+) release) regulates A\u03b2 peptide neurotoxicity and tested this in two complementary in vitro models: a human neuroblastoma cell line (MC65) producing A\u03b2(1-40) through conditional expression of the APP C-terminal portion, and murine primary cortical neuron cultures exposed to A\u03b2(1-42). In MC65 cells, EP1 receptor antagonist SC-51089 reduced A\u03b2 neurotoxicity ~50 % without altering high molecular weight A\u03b2 immunoreactive species formation. Inositol-3-phosphate receptor antagonist 2-aminoethoxy-diphenyl borate offered similar protection. SC-51089 largely protected the neuron cultures from synthetic A\u03b2(1-42) neurotoxicity. Nimodipine, a Ca(2+) channel blocker, was completely neuroprotective in both models. Based on these data, we conclude that suppressing neuronal EP1 signaling may represent a promising therapeutic approach to ameliorate A\u03b2 peptide neurotoxicity.", 
    "54": "Increased intestinal permeability of macromolecules is a common feature of oxidative stress-induced gastrointestinal diseases; how it affects the absorption of drugs is not investigated. Hence, it was proposed to study the influence of hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress on permeability of atenolol and metoprolol using a modified everted rat intestine technique. Atenolol was chosen as a marker of paracellular drug transport and metoprolol was selected to represent transcellular drug transport. Wistar rats were used as a source of intestine, which was everted using a glass rod, mounted on permeability apparatus, having test drug (100 \u03bcg/ml in Krebs) in donor compartment. Samples were taken from receiver compartment every 5 min for 60 min, and analyzed by HPLC. For induction of oxidative stress isolated ileum was incubated in H\u2082O\u2082 (200 \u03bcM) containing Krebs for 15 min and then again permeability was estimated. Extent of oxidative stress was determined by estimating lipid peroxidation using thiobarbituric acid assay, which was found to be increased by 42 % in hydrogen peroxide treated rat intestine as compared to control group. The mean apparent permeability of atenolol and metoprolol was found to be 0.054 \u00b1 0.024 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 and 0.84 \u00b1 0.14 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 cm/s, respectively, in control group rat intestinal segments. After exposure to hydrogen peroxide, there was a significant increase in the mean permeability of atenolol (0.11 \u00b1 0.01 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 cm/s), however, metoprolol permeability was unaltered (0.94 \u00b1 0.047 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 cm/s). The marked increase in the apparent permeability of atenolol may be attributed to rupture of intestinal barrier. In conclusion, the present study reports the differential effect of oxidative stress-induced damage on drug transport across rat intestine.",

In order to obtain a better enantioseparation, the influences of concentrations of di-n-butyl L-tartrate and boric acid, the type, concentration and pH of the buffer, methanol content as well as the molecular structure of analytes were extensively investigated. The separation of the analytes was performed on a Venusil MP-C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm).

    "60": "Interindividual variation of blood pressure (BP) responses to antihypertensive drugs is extensive. Several clinical, laboratory, and genetic predictors of BP responses to blood pressure-lowering agents have been suggested. We describe here the principal findings from the GENRES Study which is primarily a pharmacogenetic study of antihypertensive drug responses but also includes analysis of certain clinical and laboratory predictors. In this placebo-controlled, double-blinded, and randomized study, more than 200 male subjects with essential hypertension were treated with four antihypertensive drug monotherapies (amlodipine, bisoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and losartan) in a cross-over fashion, resulting in more than 800 treatment periods. Generally, placebo BP level was the best predictor of BP responses. In addition, higher baseline plasma renin activity predicted better BP response to losartan and bisoprolol, and weaker response to hydrochlorothiazide. A number of candidate gene polymorphisms analysed so far have given negative results in relation to BP responses, with the exception of an STK39 variant associating with losartan responsiveness. In future, genome-wide association studies on antihypertensive pharmacogenetics may identify novel pathways of BP regulation and provide new tools for both basic research and clinical use.",

Brachial blood pressure, plasma oxidized LDL (oxLDL), interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fibrinogen, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and urine 8-isoprostane levels were measured before and after 1 year of treatment. Nebivolol and metoprolol reduced equally significantly brachial blood pressure. The oxLDL was significantly reduced in both groups (p < 0.01 and for both drugs), but only nebivolol reduced 8-isoprostanes (p = 0.01). In the metoprolol group, change in oxLDL levels correlated with change in systolic blood pressure (r = 0.45; p < 0.01) and pulse pressure (r = 0.47; p < 0.01). Both metoprolol and nebivolol reduced ICAM-1 (p < 0.01). There was no change in IL-6, hsCRP, fibrinogen, or ADMA levels in either group. These data suggest that in long-term antihypertensive treatment both the cardioselective beta blocker metoprolol succinate and the vasodilating beta blocker nebivolol have inflammation-related effects but only nebivolol has a favourable blood pressure-independent effect on oxidative stress.",

The following types of mice were inoculated with T. cruzi (CHG): wild-type (WT) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter knockdown (KDVAChT) C57BL/6j mice; wild-type non-treated (NT) FVB mice; FVB mice treated with pyridostigmine bromide (PYR) or salbutamol (SALB); and \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor knockout (KO\u03b22) FVB mice. During infection and at 18-21\u00a0days after infection (acute phase), the survival curves, parasitaemia, electrocardiograms, heart rate variability, autonomic tonus and histopathology of the animals were evaluated. Negative control groups were matched for age, genetic background and treatment. The KDVAChT-CHG mice exhibited a significant shift in the electrocardiographic, autonomic and histopathological profiles towards a greater inflammatory immune response that was associated with a reduction in blood and tissue parasitism. In contrast, the CHG-PYR mice manifested reduced myocardial inflammation and lower blood and tissue parasitism. Similar results were observed in CHG-SALB animals. Unexpectedly, the KO\u03b22-CHG mice exhibited less myocardial inflammation and higher blood and tissue parasitism, which were associated with reduced mortality. These findings could have been due to the increase in vagal tone observed in the KO\u03b22 mice, which rendered them more similar to the CHG-PYR animals. In conclusion, our results indicate a marked immunomodulatory role for the parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic nervous systems, which inhibit both the inflammatory immune response and parasite clearance during the acute phase of experimental Chagas heart disease in mice.",

PDT has been used in a number of pathological indications, including tumor. A key desirable feature of the photosensitizer is the high phototoxicity on tumor cells but not on normal cells. In this study, we conjugate a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to a photosensitizer, Zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc), in order to enhance its specificity to breast cancer, which over-expresses GnRH receptor. ZnPc has unique advantages over other photosensitizers, but is difficult to derivatize and purify as a single isomer. We previously developed a straight-forward way to synthesize mono-substituted \u03b2-carboxy-phthalocyanine zinc (ZnPc-COOH). Photophysical and photochemical parameters of this ZnPc-GnRH conjugate including fluorescence quantum yield (\u0424(f)), fluorescence decay time (\u03c4(s)) and singlet oxygen quantum yield (\u0424(\u0394)) were evaluated and found comparable with that of ZnPc, indicating that addition of a GnRH peptide does not significantly alter the generation of singlet oxygen from ZnPc. Cellular uptakes and phototoxicities of this conjugate were tested and found significantly enhanced on human breast cancer cell lines overexpressing GnRH receptors (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells) compared to cells with low levels of GnRH receptors, such as human embryonic lung fibroblast (HELF) and human liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells. In addition, the cellular uptake of this conjugate toward MCF-7 cells were found clearly alleviated by a GnRH receptor blocker Cetrorelix, suggesting that the cellular uptake of this conjugate was GnRH receptor-mediated. Put together, these findings revealed that coupling ZnPc with GnRH analogue was an effective way to improve the selectivity of ZnPc towards tumors with over-expressed GnRH receptors.",

    "184": "One major determinant of the efficacy of antibiotics on gram-negative bacteria is the passage through the outer membrane. During transport of the fluoroquinolone enrofloxacin through the trimeric outer membrane protein OmpF of Escherichia coli, the antibiotic interacts with two binding sites within the pore, thus partially blocking the ionic current. The modulation of one affinity site by Mg(2+) reveals further details of binding sites and binding kinetics. At positive membrane potentials, the slow blocking events induced by enrofloxacin in Mg(2+)-free media are converted to flickery sojourns at the highest apparent current level (all three pores flickering). This indicates weaker binding in the presence of Mg(2+). Analysis of the resulting amplitude histograms with \u03b2 distributions revealed the rate constants of blocking (k(OB)) and unblocking (k(BO)) in the range of 1,000 to 120,000 s(-1). As expected for a bimolecular reaction, k(OB) was proportional to blocker concentration and k(BO) independent of it. k(OB) was approximately three times lower for enrofloxacin coming from the cis side than from the trans side. The block was not complete, leading to a residual conductivity of the blocked state being \u223c25% of that of the open state. Interpretation of the results has led to the following model: fast flickering as caused by interaction of Mg(2+) and enrofloxacin is related to the binding site at the trans side, whereas the cis site mediates slow blocking events which are also found without Mg(2+). The difference in the accessibility of the binding sites also explains the dependency of k(OB) on the side of enrofloxacin addition and yields a means of determining the most plausible orientation of OmpF in the bilayer. The voltage dependence suggests that the dipole of the antibiotic has to be adequately oriented to facilitate binding.",

The nasal septum was excised from rats anesthetized with urethane and the movement of fluorescent microspheres (FMS) applied on the nasal septum was observed with a fluorescence microscope. FMS were transported at a constant velocity in the same direction for a few minutes, but addition of 4% mucin solution on the nasal septum maintained MC for at least 90 min after excision. With our evaluation system established by modifying the method of Saldiva, MC was determined to be around 1 mm/min. Furthermore, the ciliostatic effect of benzalkonium chloride was observed, and it was confirmed that \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists and a cholinergic antagonist decreased MC, and that \u03b2-adrenergic agonists and a cholinergic agonist tended to increase MC, indicating that our system is valid and useful for evaluating MC function and the effect of drugs and pharmaceutical additives for nasal application on MC.",

    "193": "Intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction is currently the only therapeutic approach demonstrated to preserve visual function in patients with glaucoma. The first line of glaucoma treatment consists of topical IOP-lowering medications, usually initiated as monotherapy. A significant proportion of patients require more than one medication to reach a target IOP at which optic nerve damage will not progress. As prostaglandin analogues (PGAs) are the most effective class for reducing IOP, one of the other commonly used classes (\u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist [\u03b2-blocker], carbonic anhydrase inhibitor or \u03b1(2)-adrenoceptor agonist) is frequently combined with a PGA. In the last decade, the use of fixed combinations containing two medications in a single bottle has steadily increased. Fixed combinations have the potential to simplify the dosing regimen, increase patient adherence, avoid the washout effect of the second drop on the first medication instilled, decrease exposure to preservatives and, sometimes, reduce the cost of treatment. Clinical trials have evaluated PGA-based fixed combinations versus unfixed combinations (individual components administered concomitantly) or versus individual monotherapies; however, any advantage that the fixed combinations may have in terms of IOP-lowering efficacy is still debated. For these reasons, the PGA-based fixed combinations are not approved by regulatory authorities in some countries, such as the US. We review the published studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of the IOP-lowering unfixed and fixed combination therapies with PGAs. Regarding unfixed combinations, the review shows that \u03b1(2)-adrenergic agonists-PGA and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor-PGA combinations seem to be at least as effective at reducing IOP as the \u03b2-blocker-PGA combinations. As for the fixed combinations, the review shows that the three PGA-timolol fixed combinations are more effective than their component medications used separately as monotherapy and are better tolerated than the three respective prostaglandins. The three PGA-timolol fixed combinations are less effective at reducing IOP than the unfixed combinations but are better tolerated. The advantage of the fixed combinations in terms of patient adherence and persistence is supported by a very small number of studies and remains to be more accurately determined. Most studies, but not all, seem to show that PGA-timolol fixed combinations are more effective than other available \u03b2-blocker fixed combinations (dorzolamide-timolol fixed combinations) at reducing IOP and are similarly tolerated.", 
    "194": "Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a signalling phospholipid with multiple biological functions, mainly mediated through specific G protein-coupled receptors. Aberrant LPA signalling is being increasingly implicated in the pathology of common human diseases, such as arteriosclerosis and cancer. The lifetime of the signalling pool of LPA is controlled by the equilibrium between synthesizing and degradative enzymatic activity. In the current study, we have characterized these enzymatic pathways in rat brain by pharmacologically manipulating the enzymatic machinery required for LPA degradation.", 
    "195": "In rat brain cryosections, the lifetime of bioactive LPA was found to be controlled by Mg2+-independent, N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive phosphatase activity, attributed to lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs). Pharmacological inhibition of this LPP activity amplified LPA1 receptor signalling, as revealed using functional autoradiography. Although two LPP inhibitors, sodium orthovanadate and propranolol, locally amplified receptor responses, they did not affect global brain LPA phosphatase activity (also attributed to Mg2+-independent, N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive phosphatases), as confirmed by Pi determination and by LC/MS/MS. Interestingly, the phosphate analog, aluminium fluoride (AlFx-) not only irreversibly inhibited LPP activity thereby potentiating LPA1 receptor responses, but also totally prevented LPA degradation, however this latter effect was not essential in order to observe AlFx--dependent potentiation of receptor signalling.", 
    "196": "We conclude that vanadate- and propranolol-sensitive LPP activity locally guards the signalling pool of LPA whereas the majority of brain LPA phosphatase activity is attributed to LPP-like enzymatic activity which, like LPP activity, is sensitive to AlFx- but resistant to the LPP inhibitors, vanadate and propranolol.", 
    "197": "Subgroup analyses are important to medical research because they shed light on the heterogeneity of treatment effectts. A treatment-covariate interaction in an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis is the most reliable means to estimate how a subgroup factor modifies a treatment's effectiveness. However, owing to the challenges in collecting participant data, an approach based on aggregate data might be the only option. In these circumstances, it would be useful to assess the relative efficiency and power loss of a subgroup analysis without patient-level data. We present methods that use aggregate data to estimate the standard error of an IPD meta-analysis' treatment-covariate interaction for regression models of a continuous or dichotomous patient outcome. Numerical studies indicate that the estimators have good accuracy. An application to a previously published meta-regression illustrates the practical utility of the methodology.",

Models of adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy were established by intravenously injecting adriamycin hydrochloride (1 mg/kg) to rabbits via the auri-edge vein twice a week for 8 weeks in the adriamycin, metoprolol and carvedilol groups. Rabbits in the control group were given equal volume of saline through the auri-edge vein. Rabbits in the metoprolol and carvedilol groups were then intragastrically administrated metoprolol (5 mg/kg/d) and carvedilol (5 mg/kg/d) respectively for 2 months, while those in the adriamycin and control groups were treated with equal volume of saline in the same manner as in the metroprolol and carvedilol groups. Left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDd) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured by echocardiography. Plasma levels of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), malondialdehyde (MAD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were detected. The left ventricular wedge preparations were perfused with Tyrode's solution. The transmural electrocardiogram, transmural action potentials from epicardium (Epi) and endocardium (Endo), transmural repolarization dispersion (TDR) were recorded, and the incidences of triggered activity and ventricular arrhythmias were obtained at rapid cycle lengths. The results showed that TDR and the serum MDA and NT-proBNP levels were increased, and LVEF and the serum SOD level decreased in the adriamycin group compared with the control group. The incidences of triggered activity and ventricular arrhythmia were significantly higher in the adriamycin group than those in the control group (P<0.05). In the carvedilol group as compared with the adriamycin group, the serum SOD level and the LVEF were substantially increased; the TDR, and the serum MDA and NT-proBNP levels were significantly decreased; the incidences of triggered activity and ventricular arrhythmia were obviously reduced (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the levels of MDA and SOD, LVEF, TDR and the incidences of triggered activity and ventricular arrhythmia between the adriamycin group and the metoprolol group. It was concluded that carvedilol may inhibit triggered activity and ventricular arrhythmias in rabbit with adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy, which is related to the decrease in oxygen free radials.",

    "201": "Data were obtained from primary health care records that contained individual clinical data. In total, 371,036 patients were included in the sample from 2002, and 424,329 patients were included in the sample from 2007. The study population consisted of individuals aged 45+ years who were diagnosed with AF in 2002 (1,330 men and 1,096 women) and 2007 (2,748 men and 2,234 women). The pharmacotherapies prescribed in 2002 and 2007 were analyzed separately in men and women. Logistic regression was used to calculate the association between the CHADS2 score and prescribed warfarin treatment.", 
    "202": "Selective beta-blockers, anti-coagulant therapy and lipid-lowering drugs were prescribed more frequently in 2007 than in 2002. In 2007, antithrombotic and RAS-blocking agents were prescribed more frequently to men, whereas beta-1 selective beta-blockers were prescribed more frequently to women. There was no consistent association between the CHADS2 score and prescribed warfarin treatment.", 
    "203": "Pharmacotherapy of AF has improved over time, though CHADS2 guidelines need to be implemented systematically in primary health care in Sweden to decrease the risk of stroke and improve quality of life in patients with AF.", 
    "204": "Surface-eroding biodegradable polymers can provide many advantages in drug delivery, such as controllable and zero-order drug release. Photocrosslinkable poly(ester anhydride)s are a recently developed family of surface-eroding polymers with readily modifiable oligomer chemistry allowing tailoring of polymer properties. For example, in vivo release rate of peptide from photocrosslinked poly(ester anhydride)s can be controlled by oligomer hydrophobicity. In this study, X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) was used to gain a deeper understanding on internal structure, polymer erosion and drug release mechanisms of photocrosslinked poly(ester anhydride)s. Micro-CT is non-destructive and able to provide quantitative and qualitative information on the 3D structure of the sample in micrometer resolution. Photocrosslinked poly(ester anhydride) samples with varying drug loading degrees (propranolol HCl 0%, 10% and 60% w/w) and hydrophobicity (with and without 12-carbon alkenyl chain) were prepared. The samples, both freshly prepared and exposed to buffer solution for varying durations were characterized by micro-CT. The results showed that drug release from photocrosslinked poly(ester anhydride)s was primarily controlled by the surface erosion. However, drug diffusion had also a significant role in drug release from less hydrophobic samples with very high (60% w/w) drug loading degrees. In conclusion, micro-CT is a valuable tool in the characterization of surface-eroding polymers."
