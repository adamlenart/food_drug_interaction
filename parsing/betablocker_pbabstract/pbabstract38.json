In this article, the potential benefits, risks and details for implementing BNP testing in perioperative medicine are discussed. Review of four related lines of research including the use of BNP test for preoperative prognosis, BNP test for screening asymptomatic heart failure, BNP as prognostic test in asymptomatic, non-heart failure patients and using BNP for detecting silent myocardial ischaemia showed converging cut-off levels of BNP for risk stratification. BNP has better OR and relative risk in comparison with Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) in predicting perioperative cardiac risk. BNP-guided therapy can be low risk based on current evidence on non-surgical patients, including treating asymptomatic patients without heart failure to prevent cardiovascular complications. At present, there is lack of direct evidence supporting perioperative BNP testing. Further research with randomised controlled trials is needed to confirm the benefit of BNP-guided management. Preoperative BNP testing may be considered in patients with RCRI above 0 undergoing intermediate or high-risk surgery. BNP-guided therapy is likely a beneficial addition to perioperative medicine. Its combination with \u03b2-blocker titration, RCRI and perioperative cardiovascular monitoring can be a major advance in reducing cardiac risk resulting in a dynamic, individualised optimisation process.", 
    "1": "Optically pure epoxides are essential chiral precursors for the production of (S)-propranolol, (S)-alprenolol, and other \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs. Although the enzymatic production of these bulky epoxides has proven difficult, here we report a method to effectively improve the activity of BmEH, an epoxide hydrolase from Bacillus megaterium ECU1001 toward \u03b1-naphthyl glycidyl ether, the precursor of (S)-propranolol, by eliminating the steric hindrance near the potential product-release site. Using X-ray crystallography, mass spectrum, and molecular dynamics calculations, we have identified an active tunnel for substrate access and product release of this enzyme. The crystal structures revealed that there is an independent product-release site in BmEH that was not included in other reported epoxide hydrolase structures. By alanine scanning, two mutants, F128A and M145A, targeted to expand the potential product-release site displayed 42 and 25 times higher activities toward \u03b1-naphthyl glycidyl ether than the wild-type enzyme, respectively. These results show great promise for structure-based rational design in improving the catalytic efficiency of industrial enzymes for bulky substrates.", 
    "2": "Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a cardiomyopathy with hypertrabeculation of the LV, often complicated by heart failure, arrhythmia and thromboembolic events. The features of LVNC are still incompletely characterized due to its late recognition as clinically relevant condition. The aims of this study were to describe echocardiographic and electrophysiologic characteristics of LVNC patients and to assess the effects of chronic \u03b2-blocker treatment. Study patients (n\u00a0=\u00a020; 42.5 [36.3; 52.5]\u00a0years; 12 men) exhibited reduced LV ejection fraction (median LVEF\u00a0=\u00a032\u00a0%) and an increased LV mass of 210\u00a0g. Sinus rhythm was present in 19 patients, whereas one patient was in atrial fibrillation. Baseline heart rate was 77.5 beats per minute. Left bundle branch block was detected in five cases. In a subgroup of patients receiving \u03b2-blocker therapy (n\u00a0=\u00a017), LV mass was reduced from 226 [178; 306] g to 220 [169; 254] g (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) at 13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0months follow-up. By contrast, a subgroup of three patients that were not treated with an anti-\u03b2-adrenergic agent showed LV mass increase from 180 [169; 197]\u00a0g to 199 [185; 213]\u00a0g (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023). LVEF and electrocardiographic parameters were not significantly modulated during chronic \u03b2-blocker treatment. There was no sustained symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmia, thromboembolic event or death in either group. In conclusion, this study reveals reduction of LV mass among LVNC patients during \u03b2-blocker therapy. Effects of \u03b2-blocker treatment in LVNC require validation in prospective controlled studies.", 
    "3": "Glucose is the main energy substrate for neurons, and ketone bodies are known to be alternative substrates. However, the capacity of ketone bodies to support different neuronal functions is still unknown. Thus, a change in energy substrate from glucose alone to a combination of glucose and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate might change neuronal function as there is a known coupling between metabolism and neurotransmission. The purpose of this study was to shed light on the effects of the ketone body \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate on glycolysis and neurotransmission in cultured murine glutamatergic neurons. Previous studies have shown an effect of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate on glucose metabolism, and the present study further specified this by showing attenuation of glycolysis when \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate was present in these neurons. In addition, the NMDA receptor-induced calcium responses in the neurons were diminished in the presence of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, whereas a direct effect of the ketone body on transmitter release was absent. However, the presence of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate augmented transmitter release induced by the KATP channel blocker glibenclamide, thus giving an indirect indication of the involvement of KATP channels in the effects of ketone bodies on transmitter release. Energy metabolism and neurotransmission are linked and involve ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP ) channels. However, it is still unclear how and to what degree available energy substrate affects this link. We investigated the effect of changing energy substrate from only glucose to a combination of glucose and R-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate in cultured neurons. Using the latter combination, glycolysis was diminished, NMDA receptor-induced calcium responses were lower, and the KATP channel blocker glibenclamide caused a higher transmitter release.",

    "5": "Fifty unselected participants were recruited from a randomized, controlled trial comparing coronary artery bypass grafting procedures performed with versus without cardiopulmonary bypass for the risk of neurocognitive decline. Depressive symptom severity was measured at baseline, discharge, and six-month follow-up using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II).

Blood biomarker levels were determined at baseline and 2 days postoperative.", 
    "6": "Changes in S-100B levels correlated positively with acute changes in depressive symptom severity (Spearman \u03c1, 0.62; P = 0.0004) and accounted for about one-fourth of their observed variance (R2, 0.23; P = 0.0105). This association remained statistically significant after adjusting for baseline S-100B levels, age, weight, body-mass index, or \u03b2-blocker use, but not baseline BDI-II scores (P = 0.064). There was no statistically significant association between the primary outcome and baseline S-100B levels, baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or interleukin-6 levels, or changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or interleukin-6 levels. Among most participants, levels of all three biomarkers were normal at baseline and markedly elevated at 2 days postoperative.", 
    "7": "Acute changes in depressive symptom severity were specifically associated with incremental changes in S-100B blood levels, largely independent of covariates associated with either. These findings support the hypothesis that glial activation and injury and blood-brain barrier disruption can be mechanistically linked to acute exacerbation of depressive symptoms in some individuals.", 
    "8": "Diabetes mellitus as comorbidity is present in 20-25% of patients suffering from high blood pressure. Because simultaneous presence of these two diseases results in a significant increase of cardiovascular risk, various guidelines chiefly focus on the antihypertensive treatment of patients with diabetes. Combined drug therapy is usually required to achieve the blood pressure target value of <140/85 mmHg defined for patients with diabetes, which must be based on angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. These can be/must be combined with low dose, primarily thiazide-like diuretics, calcium channel blockers with neutral metabolic effect, and further options include the addition of beta blockers, imidazoline-l-receptor antagonists, or alpha-1-adrenoreceptor blockers. Evidence-based guidelines are obviously present in local practice. Although most of the patients receive angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor+indapamide or angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor+calcium channel blocker combined therapy with favorable metabolic effects, yet the use of angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors containing hydrochlorothiazide having diabetogenic potential, and angiotensin receptor blocker fixed combinations is still widespread. Similarly, interesting therapeutic practice can be observed with the use of less differentiated beta blockers, where the 3rd generation carvedilol and nebivolol are still in minority.",

    "10": "We concluded in 2004 that the first-choice treatment for hypertension in adults was single-agent therapy with the thiazide diuretic chlortalidone or, when this drug is not available, the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. As of early 2014, does evidence challenge this choice in adults without diabetes or cardiovascular or renal disease? To answer this question, we reviewed the available evidence, using the standard Prescrire methodology. The current treatment threshold for hypertensive adults without diabetes or cardiovascular or renal disease is blood pressure above 160/100 mmHg or 160/90 mmHg, with some uncertainty over which diastolic threshold should be used. Apart from certain diuretic-based combinations, the use of combinations of antihypertensive drugs as first-line therapy has not been evaluated in terms of the complications of hypertension. A number of systematic reviews with meta-analyses of data on tens of thousands of patients have compared the main classes of antihypertensive drugs against each other and against placebo. Compared with placebo, only low-dose thiazide diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in hypertensive patients. They prevented about 2 to 3 deaths and 2 strokes per 100 patients treated for 4 to 5 years. Several systematic reviews concluded that neither calcium-channel blockers, ACE inhibitors nor beta-blockers are more effective than thiazide diuretics in reducing mortality or the incidence of stroke. The efficacy of the thiazide diuretic chlortalidone is supported by the highest-level evidence, from three comparative clinical trials versus placebo, an ACE inhibitor, or a calcium-channel blocker, in more than 50 000 patients. In one of these trials, chlortalidone was superior to the ACE inhibitor lisinoprilin preventing stroke. It was also superior to the calcium-channel blocker amlodipine in preventing heart failure. The effect of hydrochlorothiazide, combined with amiloride or triamterene, on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has been demonstrated in three comparative clinical trials versus placebo, a beta-blocker, or a calcium-channel blocker. Hydrochlorothiazide appeared more effective than the beta-blocker atenolol in reducing the incidence of coronary events. The addition of a potassium-sparing diuretic (amiloride or triamterene) to first-line hydrochlorothiazide therapy has not been demonstrated to provide clinical benefit. The evaluation of indapamide, another thiazide diuretic, is less convincing. Since no head-to-head trials have been conducted, there is no evidence that it is more effective than chlortalidone or hydrochlorothiazide. None of the antihypertensive drugs appears to have a better overall adverse effect profile than the others. Thiazide diuretics can provoke hyperglycaemia and diabetes, although this does not reduce their efficacy in the prevention of cardiovascular events. As of early 2014, the first-choice treatment for hypertension in nondiabetic adults without cardiovascular or renal disease should be chlortalidone. If chlortalidone is not available, it appears reasonable to choose another thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide, possibly combined with amiloride or triamterene. When a diuretic cannot be used, it is better to choose an ACE inhibitor: captopril, lisinopril or ramipril.",

    "17": "The positive rates of autoantibodies against the \u03b21 and AT1 receptors (43.0 and 44.1%, respectively) in T2DM patients with hypertension were significantly higher than those in normotensive patients (16.0 and 10.4%, respectively; all p < 0.01). Furthermore, among T2DM patients with hypertension, the positive rates (61.4 and 64.9%, respectively) in patients with left ventricular dilatation were remarkably higher than those with normal left ventricular dimensions (34.4 and 36.1%, respectively; all p < 0.01). The presence of \u03b21 receptor antibody and AT1 receptor antibody were risk factors for left ventricular dilatation (p < 0.05). The curative effect of metoprolol tartrate and valsartan in reversing left ventricular hypertrophy in the group positive for autoantibodies was much better than in the negative group.",

    "19": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in the control of blood pressure (BP) and water balance by coordinating brain, heart and kidney functions, connected with each other by hormonal and neural mechanisms through the autonomic nervous system (ANS). RAS function may be monitored by the study of the enzymes (angiotensinases) involved in the metabolism of its active peptides. In order to study the relationship between the brain-heart-kidney axis and the control of BP and water balance, we analyzed the correlation of angiotensinase activities, assayed as arylamidase activities, between hypothalamus, left ventricle, renal cortex and renal medulla, collected from Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats, treated or not treated with L-NAME [N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester]. This compound not only inhibits the formation of nitric oxide but also disrupts the normal function of the ANS activating the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) to increase BP. In addition, to assess the influence of the SNS, we studied the effect of its blockade by treatment of both strains with propranolol. The present results support the notion that RAS function of the brain-heart-kidney axis, as reflected by the activities of angiotensinases, is reciprocally connected by afferent and efferent mechanisms between these locations, presumably through the ANS. These results reveal new aspects of neuroendocrine regulation possibly involving the ANS.",

Depending on the site of thrombosis, patients are at risk of developing liver insufficiency, portal hypertension, or bowel infarction and may experience recurrence in both the splanchnic veins and other vein segments. To prevent recurrence, anticoagulant therapy should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis and is often continued for an indefinite period of time. However, active bleeding is not infrequent at the time of SVT diagnosis, and major risk factors for bleeding, such as esophageal varices or a low platelet count, are frequently present in these patients. In real-world clinical practice, a proportion of SVT patients are left untreated because the risks associated with anticoagulant therapy are felt to exceed its benefits. However, the majority of patients receive anticoagulant drugs, with heterogeneous timing of initiation, drug choice, and dosages. Evidence to drive treatment decisions is limited because no randomized controlled trials have been carried out in these patients. This review provides practical guidance for the use of anticoagulant drugs in patients presenting with SVT, including symptomatic as well as incidentally detected events.",

The loss of this balance can cause excessive ROS production and damage to the cardiovascular tissues. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and \u03b2-blockers with antioxidant effects may inhibit ROS in the cardiovascular system. In this study, we directly compared the effects of ARBs and \u03b2-blockers with antioxidant properties on cardiovascular protection and the regulation of endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) numbers in the setting of oxidative stress in hypertensive rats. To compare the effects of the drugs, animals were divided into the following groups: Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and SHR treated with tempol (TEMP, 5\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day), trichlorothiazide (TCTZ, 1.6\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day), atenolol (25\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day), nebivolol (NEBL, 5\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day), carvedilol (CVDL, 30\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day) or telmisartan (TERT, 5\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day). Following 2 weeks of treatment, blood pressures (BPs) and aortic wall thicknesses were similarly reduced in each antihypertensive drug-treated group. Superoxide anion and malondialdehyde levels were significantly reduced following treatment with NEBL, CVDL and TERT. Additionally, the expression levels of NADPH oxidase subunits were also reduced in the TERT-, CVDL- and NEBL-treated groups. Furthermore, these drugs improved both EPC numbers and the expression levels of peroxiredoxin 2 (Prdx2), an antioxidant enzyme, in the heart and kidneys but not the aorta. Cardiac Prdx2 expression, in particular, was markedly improved by TERT, NEBL and CVDL treatment, and renal Prdx2 expression was enhanced by TEMP. Our data indicate that short-term treatment with TERT may have more beneficial effects on cardiovascular protection, EPC number improvements and Prdx2 expression compared with CVDL and NEBL. In conclusion, TERT may positively modulate the balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant properties and demonstrate capabilities beyond its BP-lowering effects.",

Whole-cell patch-\u0441lamp recording and fast application system was used in the electrophysiological experiments. PNG block developed after channel activation and increased with membrane depolarization suggesting that the ligand binds within the open channel pore. PNG blocked stationary component of GABA-activated currents in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 value of 1.12mM at -70mV. The termination of GABA and PNG co-application was followed by a transient tail current. Protection of the tail current from bicuculline block and dependence of its kinetic parameters on agonist affinity suggest that PNG acts as a sequential open channel blocker that prevents agonist dissociation while the channel remains blocked. We built the GABA(A)R models based on nAChR and GLIC structures and performed an unbiased systematic search of the PNG binding site. Monte-Carlo energy minimization was used to find the lowest energy binding modes. We have shown that PNG binds close to the intracellular vestibule. In both models the maximum contribution to the energy of ligand-receptor interactions revealed residues located on the level of 2', 6' and 9' rings formed by a bundle of M2 transmembrane segments, indicating that these residues most likely participate in PNG binding.

The goal was to find out whether individual dUGT1As and individual human UGT1As have similar substrate specificities. The results revealed similarities but also many differences. For example, similarly to the human UGT1A10, dUGT1A11 exhibited high glucuronidation activity toward the 3-OH of 17-\u03b2-estradiol, 17-\u03b1-estradiol, and ethinylestradiol, and also conjugated the drug entacapone. Unlike the human UGT1A10, however, it failed to catalyze considerable rates of R-propranolol, diclofenac, and indomethacin glucuronidation. The estrogen glucuronidation assays revealed that dUGT1A8 and dUGT1A10 have a capacity to catalyze the formation of (linked) diglucuronides, an activity no human UGT1A exhibited. dUGT1A2-dUGT1A4 are homologs of the human UGT1A4, but none of them catalyzed N-glucuronidation of dexmedetomidine. Contrary to the human UGT1A4, however, dUGT1A2-dUGT1A4 catalyzed indomethacin and diclofenac glucuronidation. It may be concluded that, perhaps with the exception of UGT1A6, high similarities in substrate specificity between individual dog and human UGTs of subfamily 1A are rare or partial.

The objective of this paper is to propose and evaluate a lab-scale experimental strategy for the determination of partition coefficient and biodegradation constant for micropollutant with an objective of modelling their removal. Four pharmaceutical compounds (ibuprofen, atenolol, diclofenac and fluoxetine) covering a wide hydrophobicity range (log Kow from 0.16 to 4.51) were chosen. Dissolved and particulate concentrations were monitored for 4\u00a0days, inside two reactors working under aerobic and anoxic conditions, and under different substrate feed conditions (biodegradable carbon and nitrogen). We determined the mechanisms responsible for the removal of the target compounds: (i) ibuprofen was biodegraded, mainly under aerobic conditions by cometabolism with biodegradable carbon, whereas anoxic conditions suppressed biodegradation; (ii) atenolol was biodegraded under both aerobic and anoxic conditions (with a higher biodegradation rate under aerobic conditions), and cometabolism with biodegradable carbon was the main mechanism; (iii) diclofenac and fluoxetine were removed by sorption only. Finally, the abilities of our strategy were evaluated by testing the suitability of the parameters for simulating effluent concentrations and removal efficiency at a full-scale plant.",

Afterwards, each group was analyzed for C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) expression, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) release into medium and cell migration ability. In the isoprenaline group, CCR2 protein level was increased, as well as the secretion of MCP-1, and cell motility was enhanced, in a concentration-dependent manner.

    "112": "The body is constantly faced with a dynamic requirement for blood flow. The heart is able to respond to these changing needs by adjusting cardiac output based on cues emitted by circulating catecholamine levels. Cardiac \u03b2-adrenoceptors transduce the signal produced by catecholamine stimulation via Gs proteins to their downstream effectors to increase heart contractility. During heart failure, cardiac output is insufficient to meet the needs of the body; catecholamine levels are high and \u03b2-adrenoceptors become hyperstimulated. The hyperstimulated \u03b21-adrenoceptors induce a cardiotoxic effect, which could be counteracted by the cardioprotective effect of \u03b22-adrenoceptor-mediated Gi signalling. However, \u03b22-adrenoceptor-Gi signalling negates the stimulatory effect of the Gs signalling on cardiomyocyte contraction and further exacerbates cardiodepression. Here, further to the localization of \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenoceptors and \u03b22-adrenoceptor-mediated \u03b2-arrestin signalling in cardiomyocytes, we discuss features of the dysregulation of \u03b2-adrenoceptor subtype signalling in the failing heart, and conclude that Gi-biased \u03b22-adrenoceptor signalling is a pathogenic pathway in heart failure that plays a crucial role in cardiac remodelling. In contrast, \u03b22-adrenoceptor-Gs signalling increases cardiomyocyte contractility without causing cardiotoxicity. Finally, we discuss a novel therapeutic approach for heart failure using a Gs-biased \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonist and a \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonist in combination. This combination treatment normalizes the \u03b2-adrenoceptor subtype signalling in the failing heart and produces therapeutic effects that outperform traditional heart failure therapies in animal models. The present review illustrates how the concept of biased signalling can be applied to increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of diseases and in the development of novel therapies.",

Most clinicians attribute this phenomenon to an acute and transient increase in catecholamine release, but other mechanisms such as neurogenic hypertension or activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have also been proposed. In this open-label study, we compared the monotherapeutic antihypertensive efficacy of the 2 most titratable drugs used to treat postcraniotomy emergence hypertension: nicardipine and esmolol.

The presence of preoperative hypertension or the approach to surgery (open craniotomy versus endonasal transsphenoidal) had no significant effect on the incidence of failure of the antihypertensive regimen used. We did not observe a difference in the need for opioid therapy for postcraniotomy pain between drug groups (99% CI difference -39.2%-30.2%).

Texture analyzer, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were applied to better understand drug release mechanisms. In vitro release experiments were conducted in a pH-changing medium to simulate the physiological condition of the gastrointestinal tract. Interestingly, a common phenomenon was observed in all the CS-anionic polymers-based matrix tablets investigated here, that is, the inner layer of the swollen tablets was coated by CS-anionic polymer polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC)-based film formed by self-assembly. Formation of the in situ self-assembled film was further confirmed by texture analysis, DSC, and FTIR. It was further identified that properties of the film were influenced by the characteristics of anionic polymers and the physiological conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, this novel structure could alter swelling and erosion-based release mechanisms of the tablets. In addition, drug release characteristics from CS-anionic polymer systems depended on the properties of anionic polymers and the drug solubility.

This genotype-phenotype relationship can lead to improved management of LQTS. However, development of genotype-specific or mutation-specific management strategies is very challenging. This review describes the pathophysiology of LQTS, genotype-phenotype correlations, and focuses on the management of LQTS. In general, the treatment of LQTS consists of lifestyle modifications, medical therapy with beta-blockers, device and surgical therapy.

This hypertrophy is not compensatory but rather reflects activation of maladaptive cellular processes that promote disease progression. Myocardial hypertrophy serves as a diagnostic and prognostic marker of cardiac remodeling, and underlying regulatory processes have provided effective therapeutic targets to slow disease progression and improve outcome. We review hypertrophic signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes and discuss established and novel targets for pharmacological intervention. New drugs in the pipeline include the third generation aldosterone antagonists (PF-03882845 and BAY94-8862) and biased angiotensin II receptor agonists. Furthermore, different approaches to stimulate cGMP-dependent protective signaling are currently evaluated in clinical trials, including the combination of the vasopeptidase neprilysin inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARNi). In an overview on cardiomyocyte hypertrophic signaling, we also highlight emerging experimental treatment concepts such as inhibition of Ca-mediated transcriptional regulation, adeno-associated viruses for sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2a), PI3 kinase gene transfer and microRNA-based therapy.

Patients with medium- or large-sized varices can be treated for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding using two strategies: non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) or endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). Both treatments are equally effective. Patients with acute variceal bleeding are critically ill patients. The available data suggest that vasoactive drugs, combined with endoscopic therapy and antibiotics, are the best treatment strategy with EVL being the endoscopic procedure of choice. In cases of uncontrolled bleeding, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-covered stents are recommended. Approximately 60% of the patients experience rebleeding, with a mortality rate of 30%. Secondary prophylaxis should start on day six following the initial bleeding episode. The combination of NSBBs and EVL is the recommended management, whereas TIPS with PTFE-covered stents are the preferred option in patients who fail endoscopic and pharmacologic treatment. Apart from injection sclerotherapy and EVL, other endoscopic procedures, including tissue adhesives, endoloops, endoscopic clipping and argon plasma coagulation, have been used in the management of esophageal varices. However, their efficacy and safety, compared to standard endoscopic treatment, remain to be further elucidated.

The effect of adrenaline and phenylephrine is blocked by nicergoline (10(-6) g/mL), increased obzidan (10(-6) g/mL) and does not change under the action ofyohimbine (10(-6) g/mL) and atenolol (10(-6) g/mL). These data indicate that the speed of agglutination increases with activation alpha1-adrenergic receptor (AR) and decreases in the activation of beta2-AR, while the activation of alpha2- and beta1-AR does not affect it. Trifluoperazine (10(-6) g/mL) as the calmodulin antagonist, barium chloride (10(-6) g/mL) as a blocked of Ca(2+)-dependent K(+)-channels and indomethacine (10(-6) g/mL) as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and phospholipase A2 inhibit the ability of adrenaline to increases the speed of agglutination of red blood cells. This suggests that the effect of adrenaline caused an increase in erythrocyte entry of Ca2+, activation of calmodulin, cyclooxygenase, phospholipase A2 and the release of K+ from red blood cell through the Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels, which is regarded as a manifestation of eryptosis.

The optimized ion transitions were mployed in the mixed-mode of scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM) -information dependent acquisition (IDA)-enhanced product ion (EPI) scan. Qualification analysis was performed through spectra-matching with on-line lab-built MS/MS library. For quantification stable isotope-labelled analogues of the analytes were used as internal standards. As a result, in porcine liver, kidney and muscle, the nine BBs showed good linearity with all the correlation coefficients (r) more than 0.995 in the range of 0.1-20 microg/L. The limits of quantification (LOQ, S/N > or = 10) were 0.5 kg/kg for all the analytes. The developed method gave average recoveries of 87.5%-111.8% spiked at 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 microg/kg with the relative standard deviations of 4.0%-12. 5%. The proposed method can be used to screen and confirm the nine BBs in a single run, which makes it effective in surveillance and detection of the BBs residues in porcine tissues.",

It is characterized by neurological symptoms and brain pathology that is associated with nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates and with transcriptional deregulation. Despite the fact that HD has been recognized principally as a neurological disease, there are multiple epidemiological studies showing that HD patients exhibit a high rate of cardiovascular events leading to heart failure. To unravel the mechanistic basis of cardiac dysfunction in HD, we employed a wide range of molecular techniques using the well-established genetic R6/2 mouse model that develop a considerable degree of the cardiac atrophy at end stage disease. We found that chronic treatment with isoproterenol, a potent beta-adrenoreceptor agonist, did not change the overall gross morphology of the HD murine hearts. However, there was a partial response to the beta-adrenergenic stimulation by the further re-expression of foetal genes. In addition we have profiled the expression level of Hdacs in the R6/2 murine hearts and found that the isoproterenol stimulation of Hdac expression was partially blocked. For the first time we established the Hdac transcriptional profile under hypertrophic conditions and found 10 out of 18 Hdacs to be markedly deregulated. Therefore, we conclude that R6/2 murine hearts are not able to respond to the chronic isoproterenol treatment to the same degree as wild type hearts and some of the hypertrophic signals are likely attenuated in the symptomatic HD animals.",

However, the specific effects of combined Cl+\u03b21 blockade during MU are unknown.", 
    "200": "We studied the chronic effects (4 weeks) of \u03b22-adrenoceptor (AR) stimulation via Cl (2 mg/kg/day) alone, and in combination with \u03b21-AR blockade using metoprolol ((Met), 250 mg/kg/day), on whole heart/cell structure, function and excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in failing (induced by left coronary artery (LCA) ligation), and unloaded (induced by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation (HATx)) failing rat hearts. Combined Cl+Met therapy displayed favourable effects in HF: Met enhanced Cl's improvement in ejection fraction (EF) whilst preventing Cl-induced hypertrophy and tachycardia. During MU combined therapy was less beneficial than either mono-therapy. Met, not Cl, prevented MU-induced myocardial atrophy, with increased atrophy occurring during combined therapy. MU-induced recovery of Ca2+ transient amplitude, speed of Ca2+ release and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content was enhanced equally by Cl or Met mono-therapy, but these benefits, together with Cl's enhancement of sarcomeric contraction speed, and MU-induced recovery of Ca2+ spark frequency, disappeared during combined therapy.", 
    "201": "Combined Cl+Met therapy shows superior functional effects to mono-therapy in rodent HF, but appears inferior to either mono-therapy in enhancing MU-induced recovery of EC coupling. These results suggest that combined \u03b22-AR simulation +\u03b21-AR blockade therapy is likely to be a safe and beneficial therapeutic HF strategy, but is not as effective as mono-therapy in enhancing myocardial recovery during LVAD support.", 
    "202": "1. Recently, we demonstrated that sarpogrelate is a potent and selective CYP2D6 inhibitor in vitro. Here, we evaluated the effect of sarpogrelate on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metoprolol in healthy subjects. 2. Nine healthy male subjects genotyped for CYP2D6*1/*1 or *1/*2 were included in an open-label, randomized, three treatment-period and crossover study. A single oral dose of metoprolol (100\u2009mg) was administered with water (treatment A) and sarpogrelate (100\u2009mg bid.; a total dose of 200\u2009mg and treatment B), or after pretreatment of sarpogrelate for three days (100\u2009mg tid.; treatment C). Plasma levels of metoprolol and \u03b1-hydroxymetoprolol were determined using a validated LC-MS/MS method. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure were monitored as pharmacodynamic responses to metoprolol. 3. Metoprolol was well tolerated in the three treatment groups. In treatment B and C groups, the AUCt of metoprolol increased by 53% (GMR, 1.53; 90% CI, 1.17-2.31) and by 51% (1.51; 1.17-2.31), respectively. Similar patterns were observed for the increase in Cmax of metoprolol by sarpogrelate. However, the pharmacodynamics of metoprolol did not differ significantly among the three treatment groups. 4. Greater systemic exposure to metoprolol after co-administration or pretreatment with sarpogrelate did not result in clinically relevant effects. Co-administration of both agents is well tolerated and can be employed without the need for dose adjustments.", 
    "203": "Taste recognition is a robust procedure to study learning and memory processes, as well as the different stages involved in them, i.e. encoding, storage and recall. Considerable evidence indicates that adrenal hormones and the noradrenergic system play an important role in aversive and appetitive memory formation in rats and humans. The present experiments were designed to characterize the effects of immediate post training corticosterone (Experiment 1) and propranolol administration (Experiment 2 and 3) on taste recognition memory. Administration of a high dose of corticosterone (5mg/kg, sc) impairs consolidation of taste memory, but the low and moderate doses (1 and 3mg/kg, sc) didn't affect it. On the other hand, immediate post-training administration of propranolol (1 and 2mg/kg, ip) impaired taste recognition memory. These effects were time-dependent since no effects were seen when drug administration was delayed 3h after training. These findings support the importance of stress hormones and noradrenergic system on the modulation of taste memory consolidation.",

Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were continuously recorded (10 min) in supine position, immediately before and during mudpack treatment (40\u00b0C). Heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were assessed.",

The decrease in blood pressure was faster in the metoprolol group than in the amlodipine group, while the average standard deviation was significantly greater and the smoothness index was less.",

    "213": "Nebivolol, unlike other selective \u03b21-receptor blockers, induces vasodilation attributable to increased NO bioavailability. The relative contribution of this mechanism to the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of nebivolol is unclear because it is normally masked by baroreflex buffering. Autonomic failure provides a unique model of hypertension devoid of autonomic modulation but sensitive to the hypotensive effects of NO potentiation. We tested the hypothesis that nebivolol would decrease BP in these patients through a mechanism independent of \u03b2-blockade. We randomized 20 autonomic failure patients with supine hypertension (14 men; 69\u00b12 years) to receive a single oral dose of placebo, nebivolol 5 mg, metoprolol 50 mg (negative control), and sildenafil 25 mg (positive control) on separate nights in a double-blind, crossover study. Supine BP was monitored every 2 hours from 8:00 pm to 8:00 am. Compared with placebo, sildenafil and nebivolol decreased systolic BP during the night (P<0.001 and P=0.036, by mixed-effects model, maximal systolic BP reduction 8-hour postdrug of -20\u00b16 and -24\u00b19 mm Hg, respectively), whereas metoprolol had no effect. In a subanalysis, we divided patients into sildenafil responders (BP fall>20 mm Hg at 4:00 am) and nonresponders. Nebivolol significantly lowered systolic BP in sildenafil responders (-44\u00b113 mm Hg) but not in nonresponders (1\u00b111 mm Hg). Despite lowering nighttime BP, nebivolol did not worsen morning orthostatic tolerance compared with placebo. In conclusion, nebivolol effectively lowered supine hypertension in autonomic failure, independent of \u03b21-blockade. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NO potentiation contributes significantly to the antihypertensive effect of nebivolol.", 
    "214": "Glaucoma is a common sight-threatening condition that is primarily treated by lowering intraocular pressure (IOP). Today the mainstay of treatment is topical ocular hypotensive medications; many patients require more than one agent to achieve target IOP. For such patients, fixed combination formulations have several advantages including simplicity of treatment regimen, adherence to the treatment regimen, efficacy, improved ocular surface comfort and reduced cost. All currently available fixed combinations contain a \u03b2-blocker, which is contraindicated in some patients. Hence there is a clinical need for fixed-combination preparations without a \u03b2-blocker. This paper reviews the current literature on a new fixed-combination drug containing brinzolamide 1% and brimonidine 0.2% (BBFC).", 
    "215": "A PubMed, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov registry search was performed to identify all relevant studies. Four published clinical papers pertaining to three randomized controlled trials were identified for review. All studies demonstrated a significant reduction (p < 0.01) in mean IOP in patients administered with BBFC compared with its individual components, brinzolamide 1% or brimonidine 0.2%. Adverse effects from BBFC were no different from each of the individual components, the most common being blurred vision, eye irritation and dysgeusia (abnormal taste sensation). Although BBFC use was associated with more adverse effects compared with the individual components used as monotherapy (p < 0.001), the cumulative adverse effect profile from BBFC did not appear greater than one would expect from the simultaneous use of the two components.",

    "221": "The autonomic nervous system (ANS) conveys neuronal input from the brain to the stomach. We investigated mechanisms through which urocortin 1 (UCN1) injected intracerebroventricularly (ICV, 300 pmol/rat) inhibits circulating ghrelin in rats. This was achieved by assessing (1) the induction of c-fos gene expression as a marker of neuronal activation in specific hypothalamic and caudal brainstem regulating ANS; (2) the influence of vagotomy and pharmacological blockade of central and peripheral \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (AR) on ICV UCN1-induced reduction of plasma ghrelin levels (determined by ELISA); and (3) the relevance of this pathway in the feeding response to a fast in rats. UCN1 increased c-fos mRNA expression in key brain sites influencing sympathetic activity namely the hypothalamic paraventricular and ventromedial nuclei, locus coeruleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, and rostral ventrolateral medulla, by 16-, 29-, 6-, 37-, and 13-fold, respectively. In contrast, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus had little c-fos mRNA expression and ICV UCN1 induced a similar reduction in acylated ghrelin in the sham-operated (31%) and vagotomized (41%) rats. An intraperitoneal (IP) injection of either a non-selective \u03b1- or selective \u03b12-AR antagonist reduced, while a selective \u03b12-AR agonist enhanced ICV UCN1-induced suppression of plasma acylated ghrelin levels. In addition, IP injection of a non-selective \u03b2- or selective \u03b21-AR agonist blocked, and selective \u03b21-AR antagonist augmented, the ghrelin response to ICV UCN1. The IP injections of a selective \u03b11- or non-selective \u03b2 or \u03b22-AR antagonists, or any of the pretreatments given ICV had no effect. ICV UCN1 reduced the 2-h food intake in response to a fast by 80%, and this effect was partially prevented by a selective \u03b12-AR antagonist. These data suggest that ICV UCN1 reduces plasma ghrelin mainly through the brain sympathetic component of the ANS and peripheral AR specifically \u03b12-AR activation and inactivation of \u03b21-AR. The \u03b12-AR pathway contributes to the associated reduction in food intake.",

In 2011, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons of the United States published guidelines for the prophylaxis and treatment of postoperative AF. High evidence levels are provided for continuing \u03b2-blocker treatment despite its known negative inotropic effects. Alternatively, the calcium channel blocker diltiazem, or amiodarone for patients without pneumonectomy are recommended for prophylactic therapy. For rate control of AF occurring post surgery, not only selective \u03b21-blockers, calcium channel blockers, but also magnesium or digoxin are suitable in haemodynamically stable patients. Amiodarone, \u03b21-blockers and flecainide are preferred for rhythm control in case of haemodynamic stability in regard to possible side effects and contraindications. In contrast, electrical cardioversion is indicated in those patients with haemodynamic instability. Persistent AF of >\u200948 hours is a target for anticoagulation treatment depending on the individual aspects of the patient and in accordance to the CHADS2 score. The present review article further discusses the evidence for the recommended medical therapy and treatment strategies.",

In fact, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons uses the administration of preoperative BBs as a quality metric. Recent reports, however, have questioned the benefit and safety of preoperative BB administration. The aim of our study was to investigate whether preoperative BBs lead to improved surgical outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A review of our prospectively maintained institutional database was done to identify adults undergoing cardiac operations at our institution from 2008 to 2013. Survival to discharge was the primary outcome with several additional secondary measures of morbidity included. A total of 2120 patients were included in the analysis and a multivariate logistic regression model was developed to adjust for differences between patient groups. After adjustment, BB administration was associated with lower odds of both prolonged ventilation (odds ratio [OR], 0.73; P = 0.032) and prolonged length of stay (OR, 0.79; P = 0.044). BB use was not associated with significant differences in other outcomes such as mortality or postoperative atrial fibrillation. Our study found that preoperative BBs may not be associated with sufficiently improved outcomes to justify their use as a quality metric in this population. Thus, prospective studies are warranted."
