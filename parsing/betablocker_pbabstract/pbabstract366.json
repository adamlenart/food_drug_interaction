In 0.1 M hydrochloric acid, HPMC K4M predominantly controlled release since carbopol has a low solubility at this pH. As the pH increased, the carbopol became increasingly ionized and interacted with propranolol hydrochloride to form an insoluble complex which retarded the release of the drug. In addition, the nature of the interaction between carbopol 974 and HPMC K4M altered. DSC and viscometric studies indicated that the two polymers contributed synergistically to the gel network at pH 7.5. Thus at pH 7.5 polymers contributed to matrix integrity and to the control of drug release.",

In an open-label, randomized, four-period crossover study, the pharmacokinetics of nadolol and its stereoisomers and the bioequivalence of two formulations of nadolol were assessed in 20 healthy male subjects following a single dose (80 mg) and multiple doses (80 mg; once daily for 7 days). A standard granulated tablet and direct compressed tablet formulations, each containing 80 mg of nadolol, with different in vitro dissolution profiles that met current USP requirements were used. The four treatments were single and multiple doses of granulated tablet, and single and multiple doses of compressed tablet. There was a 7 day washout period between successive treatments. All doses of nadolol were administered after an overnight fast. Serial blood samples were collected up to 72 h following the single dose and during multiple dose treatments, following day 6 and 7 doses. Validated high-performance liquid chromatographic assays were applied to measure nadolol and its stereoisomers in the study samples. Plasma concentration data were subjected to noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. Both C(max) and AUC values were significantly greater for SQ-12150 when compared to other nadolol stereoisomers obtained after a single dose or at steady state. However, T(max) and T1/2 values were similar among the four isomers. The observed steady state AUC tau values for nadolol (2278-2331 ng h/ML) or its stereoisomers (550-874 ng h/ML) were significantly greater than those predicted from the single dose AUCinf values (nadolol, 1840-1845 ng h/ML; isomers, 450-713 ng h/ML). The intrasubject variability, computed from multiple dose data, was generally greater for the stereoisomers (17-40%) than for nadolol (10-32%). The two formulations were bioequivalent for nadolol (C(max) = 0.98 [84%, 117%]; AUCinf = 1.03 [93%, 116%]) and SQ-12150 (C(max) = 1.12 [89%, 122%]; AUCinf = 0.98 [82%, 119%]) after a single dose, and only for nadolol (C(max) = 1.07 [84%, 118%]; AUCinf = 1.02 [91%, 113%]) at steady state.", 
    "2": "We have investigated the role of bradykinin in allergen-induced airway microvascular leakage and bronchoconstriction in sensitized guinea pigs. We used a selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, HOE140, which has been shown to prevent the airway effects induced by bradykinin. Lung resistance (RL) was measured for 6 min after challenge with allergen. Extravasation of Evans blue dye into airway tissues was used as an index of the airway microvascular leakage. Aerosolized ovalbumin (5 mg/ml, 30 breaths) induced a significant increase in RL and leakage of dye in the trachea, main bronchi and intrapulmonary airways in the ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs. HOE140 given by inhalation (200 microM, 60 breaths) had no effect on the airway microvascular leakage and bronchoconstriction induced by the allergen. I.v. HOE140 (200 nmol/kg) did not significantly inhibit these airway responses. We conclude that bradykinin-mediated mechanism may not play a significant role in airway microvascular leakage or bronchoconstriction induced by allergen.",

    "5": "Patients with the Romano-Ward long QT interval syndrome run a high risk of sudden cardiac death. Beta-blockers of the sympathetic nerve are effective treatment. Some patients die suddenly despite this treatment. The treatment of choice is a combination of beta-blockers of the sympathetic nerve and cardiostimulation. The authors describe a group of their own five patients from three families with the Romano-Ward syndrome. The course was favourable. The stimulation rate needed for normalization of the QT interval and a favourable clinical development was 78 +/- 6 imp./min. Based on data in the literature and their own experience the authors recommended combined treatment with beta-blockers and cardiostimulation in patients with the Romano-Ward syndrome, if monotherapy with beta-blockers is not effective.", 
    "6": "A significant improvement in late survival of post-myocardial infarction patients has been observed during the last few years, even before the beginning of the thrombolytic era. However, about half of the fatality rate in these patients is related to arrhythmic sudden death. So, a discussion of the value of different diagnostic and therapeutic tools available for reducing arrhythmic risk seems pertinent. Several features are considered risk markers for sudden arrhythmic death: symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, left ventricular disfunction, myocardial ischemia, frequent or complex premature ventricular contractions, late ventricular potentials in high-resolution ECG and autonomous nervous system disturbances. It seems reasonable to state that the risk markers whose value was established before the thrombolytic era maintain most of their clinical applicability to the present, but none of them has specificity enough as a sudden death predictor to warrant a general systematic strategy to trace such risk arrhythmic factors. Prophylactic administration of Type I antiarrhythmic drugs to patients with frequent or complex premature ventricular contractions can no longer be justified. There is probably a place for betablockers, mainly in patients with mild to moderate depression in left ventricular function. The final results of several trials currently in progress should contribute to establish the potential role of low dose amiodarone. There is not enough evidence to determine which post-myocardial infarction patients will be candidates for an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Device. Patients with risk factors for sudden death, in particular those who have a severe impairment of left ventricular function and/or severe ischemia in the stress test, would be able to take advantage of a revascularization procedure when the culprit vessel remains occluded. In the intermediate risk patients (20-40% of the total population), tests attempting to more precisely evaluate the arrhythmic risk would be warranted, always in an individualized, sequential schedule. In some cases, like the high-resolution ECG or the heart rate variability indices, more clinical investigation is necessary to adequately establish their value in routine clinical practice.", 
    "7": "Only the simultaneous analysis of periodic and nonlinear properties of heart rate fluctuations (HRF) can describe completely this complex physiological process. Up to now there is, apart from a study of our own, no systematic and correlative investigation using both parameter groups, also not in early development. Thus, we tried to describe in this manner these properties of HRF, the corresponding mean arterial pressure fluctuations (MAPF) and respiratory movements (RM) and their mutual relations in neonatal pig.", 
    "8": "In 6 term newborn piglets, periodic properties of HRF, RM, and MAPF were analyzed by spectral and coherence analysis, and deterministic-chaotic properties by calculation of correlation dimension (CD), Lyapunov exponent (LE), and construction of phase space plots. The assumption of deterministic chaotic components was supported by Theiler's test for nonlinearity, by always positive leading LEs, and by the results of a nonlinear deterministic model. These analyses were done in sleep states, general anaesthesia, hypoxic hypoxia, in ventilated state, and during cholinergic and additional beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "9": "In all experimental states, HRF and MAPF have periodic and nonlinear, very probably deterministic-chaotic properties, but in different relations. In anaesthetized piglets, periodic properties of HRF and MAPF dominate. In hypoxia the decreasing LE and CD of HRF and CD of MAPF were connected with increasing MAPF power density. Cholinergic blockade caused a decreased overall HRF and MAPF power and a decreasing LE and CD, but beta-adrenergic blockade decreased a small part of power density of both in 0.02-0.08 Hz only. The results of CD, LE, Theiler's test and the low dimensional deterministic model data suggested mainly deterministic-chaotic properties in the nonlinear part of HRF and MAPF.", 
    "10": "Already in neonatal piglets, both periodic and nonlinear, very probably deterministic chaotic properties of HRF and MAPF exist which change both during hypoxia and cholinergic blockade. They are partly cholinergically and--to a small extent--also beta-adrenergically mediated. The decrease of nonlinear complexity of HRF and MAPF during hypoxia suggests characteristic pathological change even in early development.",

    "12": "Ten healthy individuals (5 men, mean age 44 years) were investigated at rest, after intravenous injections of propranolol (0.15 mg/kg), followed by atropine (0.03 mg/kg). On another occasion, investigation was made during exercise on a bicycle ergometer at 40% and at 70% of maximal working capacity. Heart rate variability was assessed by: local sensitive dependence on initial conditions as quantitated by the dominant Lyapunov exponent, coefficient of variation of heart rate, power spectral analysis of high- and low-frequency bands and the 1/f-slope of the very-low-frequency band and time domain analysis.", 
    "13": "The approximate dominant Lyapunov exponent was positive at rest and remained positive during autonomic blockade and during exercise. The exponent decreased significantly with propranolol+atropine and even more so during exercise but did not attain zero. At baseline approximate predictability was lost after about 30 s whereas after autonomic blockade or exercise it was lost after about 60 s. The 1/f-slope remained unaltered around -1. As expected, power in high- and low-frequency bands as well as time domain index decreased significantly with autonomic blockade. The low-frequency band and time domain index were affected by exercise.", 
    "14": "Heart rate variability of sinus rhythm in healthy individuals has characteristics suggestive of low-dimensional chaos-like determinism which is modulated but not eliminated by inhibition of autonomic tone or by exercise.

VF was successfully prevented by the combination of pilsicainide, propranolol, and verapamil. In particular, the effects of pilsicainide are assumed to exert an important effect in controlling this arrhythmia. Class Ic drugs may be effective for preventing VF initiated by short-coupled VPBs.", 
    "16": "Even though therapeutic advances have occurred, heart failure is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have proven effective, but in many patients still do not prevent progressive and debilitating heart failure. Many hormonal factors are involved, but two, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) axis and the autonomic nervous system, apparently are critical in the pathophysiology of progressive ventricular dysfunction. Pharmacologic suppression of the RAA system is associated with significant clinical benefit, suggesting that antagonism of sympathetic nervous activity with beta-receptor-blocking agents might also be efficacious. Major alterations of the autonomic nervous system are characteristic of heart failure, with excessive sympathetic activity one of the earliest adaptations to the condition, and important in promoting the heart failure state and the progression of ventricular dysfunction. Certain beta-antagonists administered by careful and slow up-titration from small starting dosages proved effective in small trials. Large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled studies continue to document that beta-blockers improve ventricular function and symptoms, and preliminary results suggests mortality and morbidity reductions as well. Although intolerance to beta-antagonism does occur, the majority of patients can be successfully treated with these agents.",

Walking distance and the resistance index in the femoral artery were measured before and after 3 months medication and compared with the findings in controls (30 patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and stage IIb peripheral arterial occlusive disease) who received placebo. Patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease who were treated with atenolol 50 mg/day demonstrated significant decreases in both pain-free and maximal walking distance. In contrast, the walking distances in those given celiprolol 200 mg/day and those who received isosorbide dinitrate 80 mg/day did not differ from the distances in control subjects. The Doppler flow through the femoral artery, as measured by color duplex sonography, showed a significant decrease in resistance index, both in patients given celiprolol and in those given isosorbide dinitrate. In patients treated with atenolol the resistance index rose significantly. The results of this study confirm that the beta-adrenoceptor blocker celiprolol exerts a supplementary vasodilatory action resembling that of nitrates and hence can be used in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and impaired peripheral arterial perfusion.",

    "26": "Acute stress evokes immediate responses in the cardiovascular endocrine, and immune systems. In particular, the number and activity of natural killer (NK) lymphocytes increase after stress. Here, we investigate the possibility to pharmacologically interfere with these stress-induced immunologic changes. Twenty-five healthy males were subjected to an acute stressor, a first-time tandem parachute jump. Subjects were randomly assigned to a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (propranolol), a benzodiazepine (alprazolam), or placebo group. To analyze the role of the spleen in lymphocyte redistribution, splenectomized subjects performed a parachute jump. Propranolol, but no alprazolam, inhibited the heart rate increase during jumping. Increases in epinephrine and cortisol in the propranolol group were comparable to placebo, but were attenuated by alprazolam. The number and activity of NK cells significantly increased in the placebo group but not in the propranolol group immediately after stress. Alprazolam treatment did not alter the increase in NK cell numbers but did inhibit the increase in NK activity. In splenectomized subjects, NK cell numbers, but not NK activity, increased as in placebo subjects. We conclude that stress-induced changes in the immune system are controlled by beta-adrenergic mechanisms and only partly depend on the spleen; central interference with alprazolam differentially affects stress-induced changes in the NK cell compartment.", 
    "27": "We assayed [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine ([3H]5-HT) binding in rat hypothalamic membranes to confirm the possible of measuring 5-HT7 receptors. Binding was tested in the presence of 3 microM (+/-)-pindolol, a concentration higher than previously suggested for the same purpose (0.1 micron). This higher concentration was, however, needed to fully saturate 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors without interaction with 5-HT7 receptors. Under these conditions, [3H]5-HT binding could be further inhibited with methiothepin (used to determine nonspecific binding) and with 5-HT, with an IC50 of 1.4 nM and a slope of 1. The inhibition curves of (+/-)-8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin, ritanserin, and mianserin were shallow (slopes, 0.35-0.58) and could be better analyzed with the two-site model, indicating that the pindolol-insensitive [3H]5-HT binding sites in rat hypothalamic membranes are heterogeneous. Although the IC50 of the compounds tested suggests that one population of sites is actually associated with 5-HT7 receptors, our data clearly indicate that this binding assay does not selectively label 5-HT7 receptors in native tissues. These results challenge a previous report and suggest that the proposed down-regulation of 5-HT7 receptors after fluoxetine treatment should be considered with caution. The development of more selective and sensitive binding assays will probably offer significant advantage.", 
    "28": "We recently cloned a CYP2D subfamily member (CYP2D16) from a guinea pig adrenal cDNA library and investigated the expression of CYP2D16 in the guinea pig adrenal cortex and its relationship to adrenal xenobiotic metabolism. A modified sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis technique revealed three major bands in the molecular mass range of cytochromes P450 in guinea pig adrenal microsomes. Two of the bands were immunoreactive with anti-CYP17 (54 kDa) or anti-CYP21 (52 kDa) antibody. The third band (50 kDa) was immunoreactive with antibody raised against CYP2D1 and with anti-CYP1A1/1A2 antibody. Microsequencing of the 50-kDa band yielded an amino-terminal sequence of 38 amino acids identical to that deducted from the CYP2D16 cDNA. In addition, Northern blot analyses indicated the CYP1A1 was not expressed in the adrenal gland, suggesting that only CYP2D16 composed the microsomal 50-kDa band. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses demonstrated greater expression of CYP2D16 in microsomes from the inner zone (zona reticularis) of the adrenal cortex than from the outer zones, coinciding with the major site of adrenal xenobiotic metabolism. Bufuralol-1'-hydroxylase activity, a marker for CYP2D isozymes, was also greater in inner- than in outer-zone microsomal preparations and was highly correlated with CYP2D16concentrations. Northern blot analysis with a full-length CYP2D16 cDNA as the probe gave strong bands with adrenal inner zone RNA preparations and relatively weak bands with outer zone RNA. CYP2D16 mRNA was also detectable in liver and kidney RNA preparations, but at lower levels than in the adrenal inner zone, and it was not detectable in testes, lung, intestines, or heart. Overall, the results demonstrate that CYP2D16 is expressed at highest levels in the inner zone of the guinea pig adrenal cortex and suggest a major role for this isozyme in adrenal xenobiotic metabolism.",

    "33": "Bradykinin, applied locally to the airways, is a weak bronchoconstrictor agent in guinea pigs in vivo and it may cause constriction or dilatation of guinea pig airways smooth muscle in vitro. We examined the motor effect of bradykinin perfused through the lumen of isolated guinea pig tracheal tubes with or without nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors. In the presence of NG-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester (D-NAME) or NG-monomethyl-D-arginine (D-NMMA) intraluminal bradykinin caused a moderate concentration-dependent relaxation. In contrast, in the presence of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) tracheas developed a sustained increase in tone, and bradykinin caused a marked, concentration-dependent contraction, both effects being reversible by pretreatment with L-arginine, but not with D-arginine. The ability of bradykinin to relax (in the presence of D-NAME) or contract (in the presence of L-NAME) guinea pig tracheal tubes was not affected by indomethacin. Bradykinin contracted epithelium-denuded tracheas in the presence of either L-NAME or D-NAME. Both contraction and relaxation by bradykinin were blocked by the kinin B2 receptor antagonist, HOE 140. Baseline production of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in strips of guinea pig trachealis in vitro was markedly reduced by L-NAME, but not by D-NAME. Bradykinin increased baseline cyclic GMP concentration. These results indicate that bradykinin releases NO or a NO-related molecule, which, possibly by increasing cyclic GMP concentrations, mediates relaxation and opposes contraction induced by bradykinin itself, and further, that bradykinin releases NO from the tracheal epithelium.", 
    "34": "We report an uncommon mechanism of severe hypoxemia in two cirrhotic patients under long-term beta-blocker therapy. Our patients presented with profound hypoxemia refractory to oxygen therapy, normal lung radiography and pulmonary function tests, and evidence of right-to-left anatomic shunt. Although these features are highly suggestive of hepatopulmonary syndrome, pulmonary hypertension was present, and a right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale was demonstrated by contrast-enhanced echocardiography. No cause of pulmonary hypertension other than portal hypertension was identified. Pulmonary hypertension and intracardiac right-to-left shunt eventually regressed after discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy. We conclude that \"primary\" pulmonary hypertension associated with portal hypertension may because of severe hypoxemia during liver cirrhosis. Differential diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome relies upon contrast-enhanced echocardiography and may be of critical importance because of possible therapeutic implications.", 
    "35": "Previous study of adrenergic control of the tracheal vasculature in rats (1) demonstrated that beta-adrenergic blockade heightened arteriolar and large venular contractile responses to norepinephrine, a nonselective alpha-adrenergic agonist. The present study was undertaken to confirm the presence of functional beta-adrenergic receptors and to determine which beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes mediate vasodilation in this tissue. Tracheal adventitial arterioles (12.0 to 47.0 micro m initial diameter, n=39) and venules (48.0 to 98.5 micrometers initial diameter, n=44) were observed through a video microscope, and vessel diameters were measured. Vessels were preconstricted with 10(-4) M phenylephrine (PHE), a selective alpha 1-adrenergic agonist, to achieve sufficient tone for measurement of dilation responses. When vessels were treated only with PHE, arterioles and venules constricted to 55.9% and 67.6% of their initial diameter, respectively, after 15 min of suffusion. When preconstricted vessels were treated with the nonselective beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10(-5) M), both arterioles and venules significantly dilated from 63.4% to 82.9% and from 71.5% to 81.3% of their initial diameters. At high concentration (10(-5) M), the putative beta 2-adrenergic agonist terbutaline also caused preconstricted arterioles and venules to significantly dilate from 70.8% to 79.8% and from 71.5% to 83.4% of their initial diameters. The selective beta 1-adrenergic antagonist atenolol (10(-6) M) did not affect terbutaline-induced dilation in preconstricted arterioles, but greatly attenuated dilation in preconstricted venules. From these data, we conclude that beta 2-adrenergic receptors are present in and mediate dilation of tracheal arterioles, and also, that the dilation in large tracheal venules is mediated in large part through beta 1-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "36": "There has been growing evidence for the benefits of beta blockers, but alpha blockers have not shown sustained benefits in chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Thirty patients with moderate to severe CHF (New York Heart Association class II to IV) were sequentially assigned to receive metoprolol 6.25 mg with the alpha-1 antagonist doxazosin 4 mg/day or metoprolol alone. The dose of metoprolol was gradually increased to a target dose of 50 mg orally twice daily. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained before drug therapy, 2 hours after the first dose of combined alpha-beta therapy or metoprolol alone, and after 3 months of continuous treatment. Nuclear ejection fraction, plasma norepinephrine, and submaximal and maximal exercise capacity were also measured before and after chronic therapy. With initial combined drug administration, mean arterial pressure, left ventricular filling pressure, and systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly compared with results after metoprolol alone. However, after 3 months of continuous therapy, both treatment groups showed similar and significant reductions in systemic vascular resistance and heart rate, with significant increases in cardiac index, stroke volume index, stroke work index, ejection fraction, and exercise capacity. Furthermore, the next dose of chronic combined medication no longer showed vasodilating effects. Chronic therapy with fixed-dose doxazosin and increasing doses of metoprolol produced identical effects as those seen in patients receiving metoprolol alone.", 
    "37": "The aim of the present study was to analyze the increased airway reactivity to antigen induced by beta-adrenoceptor blockade, adrenalectomy or medullectomy and to assess the contribution of circulating catecholamines to the increased reactivity. In anesthetized guinea pigs sensitized to ovalbumin (OA), administration of OA produced a dose-related bronchoconstriction characterized by threshold increases in airway insufflation pressure at 0.1 mg/kg i.v. and a near-maximal increase by 0.3 mg/kg i.v. Pretreatment with R(+) propranolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) 5 min prior to antigen did not significantly alter airway responses to antigen when compared to vehicle-treated animals. However, pretreatment with 0.5 mg/kg i.v. S(-) propranolol, racemic propranolol or nadolol markedly enhanced (10- to 15-fold) the airway response to the low-dose antigen. In addition, in guinea pigs which had been adrenalectomized, the reactivity to low-dose antigen was enhanced to a similar extent as that of beta-antagonist-treated animals when compared to sham-operated animals. Baseline plasma concentrations of epinephrine were significantly higher in sham-operate guinea pigs (1,494 +/- 223 ng/ml) when compared to adrenalectomized animals (412 +/- 44 ng/ml). Upon antigen exposure, epinephrine levels rose 5-fold (6,859 +/- 1,308 ng/ml) from baseline in sham-operated guinea pigs and were not significantly changed in adrenalectomized animals (848 +/- 208 ng/ml). Specific airway conductance measurements in conscious guinea pigs revealed that animals which had been medullectomized 2 weeks previously responded to lower provocative concentrations of aerosol OA (0.05-0.5%) than corresponding sham-operated animals. Airway reactivity to inhaled acetylcholine (0.1-1%) was similar in medullectomized and sham guinea pigs. Plasma concentrations of epinephrine were significantly lower in medullectomized guinea pigs (327 +/- 88 ng/ml) when compared to sham-operated animals (832 +/- 162 ng/ml). The results of the present study indicate that beta-adrenoceptor antagonism or changes in circulating epinephrine levels markedly alter the response to antigen in sensitized guinea pigs.", 
    "38": "The mechanism of beta-blocker induced cardiotoxicity is poorly understood. One possible explanation is that beta-blockers induce ion dyshomeostasis, resulting in cardiac hyperpolarization. The intent of this study was to determine if modifying extracellular ions would reverse cardiotoxicity from two beta-blockers: propranolol (PROP) and atenolol (ATEN). Two treatments were studied: low extracellular K+ and high extracellular Na+. Isolated rat hearts were perfused on a Langendorff apparatus with Krebs-Henseleit- Bicarbonate buffer (KHB) solution. Toxicity (Tox) was induced by perfusing hearts for 30 min with KHB + PROP [5 microgram/ml] or KHB + ATEN [2.5 mg/ml]. Subsequently, hearts were perfused with KHB containing either PROP or ATEN, but modified by lowering K+ [2.3 mM] or raising Na+ [160 mM] for a 30-min treatment (Tx) period. Hearts were paced near the end of treatment. Cardiodynamics were monitored via a balloon-tipped catheter in the left ventricle. The first derivative of LV pressure (dP/dt) with respect to time served as our index of myocardial performance. Tx groups were as follows: (1) KHB only, (2) PROP only, (3) PROP + K, (4) PROP + Na, (5) ATEN only, (6) ATEN 4 K, and (7) ATEN + Na. PROP induced negative chronotropic effects and rendered the hearts refractory to pacing. ATEN demonstrated similar chronotropic toxicity plus decreased myocardial contractility. Tx with low extracellular K+ and high extracellular Na+ increased HR and restored the ability to pace, thereby reversing toxicity.

    "39": "To evaluate whether the identification of the different types of relations between premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and the preceding sinus cycle length is capable of predicting the effect of beta-blockers on the PVCs themselves, 55 patients (43 men, 12 women, mean age 52.6 +/- 15.6 years) with different cardiac diseases, and >30 PVCs/hr characterized by stability and the same relation at two Holter monitoring periods were studied. The relation was tachycardia enhanced (the shorter the preceding cycle length, the higher the incidence of PVCs) in 23 patients (group 1); indifferent (no correlation between the preceding cycle length and PVC incidence) in 21 (group 2); and bradycardia enhanced (the longer the preceding cycle length, the higher the incidence of PVCs) in 11 (group 3). A third Holter monitoring was performed 6 days after nadolol administration (80 mg/day) to evaluate its effect on the three types of PVCs. Incidence in all patients (-88;p<0.001). In group 2, it caused a reduction in the majority of patients (-60%;p<0.05) but an increase in five. In group 3, it caused a reduction in only half of the patients (-45%) and a 91% increase in the remainder. The difference in the effect of nadolol in the three groups was highly significant (X2=27.5;p<0.0001). The relation between the incidence of PVCs and the preceding cycle length is a useful means of identifying subsets of patients with PVCs who will benefit from beta-blockers.", 
    "40": "Physicians must now consider the likely cost of management decisions as well as the expected effects on patient outcome. Cost-ascertainment studies identify and contrast the cost of therapies, and cost-effectiveness analysis compares the additional cost of a therapy with its additional effect on survival and quality of life. This article reviews the principles of cost-ascertainment and cost-effectiveness analysis and then presents the cost of initial and follow-up care in Electrophysiologic Study Versus Electrocardiographic Monitoring (ESVEM) trial. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of therapy guided by electrophysiologic study or Holter monitoring and of sotalol versus other drugs is reviewed, and implications for future studies are discussed.", 
    "41": "Because not all laboratories use the monitoring and stimulation protocols used in the Electrophysiologic Study Versus Electrocardiographic Monitoring (ESVEM) trial, we reanalyzed the ESVEM patients' data using alternative, commonly used Holter monitor (HM) and programmed stimulation efficacy criteria to determine if different criteria would have changed the trial's conclusions. Also, because beta-blocker use and coronary artery disease frequency were not equally distributed between the two limbs in ESVEM, we reanalyzed the ESVEM data adjusting for the possible effect of these variables. In the HM limb, drug efficacy in the original ESVEM analysis was declared by reduction of total premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) by 70%, pairs by 80%, runs of 3 to 15 beats by 90%, and all ventricular tachycardia (VT) more than 15 beats by 100%. In this analysis, we examine outcome in subjects meeting two more stringent sets of criteria, (1) reduction of total PVCs by 70%, of pairs by 80%, and of all VT by 100% (new criteria set 1) and (2) reduction of total PVCs by 80%, of pairs by 90%, and of all VT by 100% (new criteria set 2). In electrophysiology (EPS) limb patients, we compared arrhythmia recurrence when efficacy was declared with triple extrastimuli as compared with maximally testing with double extrastimuli, and arrhythmia recurrence was compared in patients tested with identical versus any more aggressive protocol on drug than was used before drug. We also compared the predictive accuracy of zero versus 3 to 15, and 0 to 5, 6 to 10, and more than 10 induced beats on drug. Additionally, we compared predictive accuracy of the HM- and EP-guided limbs excluding patients on beta blockers and those with noncoronary disease. Lastly, to determine whether concordant results on HM and EPS testing would provide more accurate efficacy predictions than EP testing alone, HM recordings obtained in EPS-limb patients but not processed or used during the course of the EVSEM study were analyzed. The original ESVEM HM criteria, new set 1, and new set 2 yielded predicted drug efficacy rates of 77%, 68%, and 58%, respectively; however, arrhythmia recurrence rates were unchanged. Similarly, arrhythmia recurrence rates for patients tested with triple versus less than triple extrastimuli (p=.238), more aggressive versus identical protocols (p=.955), and 0 to 5 v 6 to 10 v more than 10 induced beats (p=.263) or 0 v 3 to 15 induced beats (p=.106) were unchanged. in the 215 (of 286) patients with coronary disease and not receiving beta blockers, there was still no difference in arrhythmia recurrence or mortality between the noninvasive and invasive limbs in ESVEM. Lastly, in patients with drug efficacy predictions by EPS testing, there was no difference in outcome in patients who had concordant versus discordant efficacy prediction by simultaneously obtained HMs. The use of more stringent testing methods and efficacy criteria would not have significantly improved the predictive accuracy of drug assessment by HM or EPS in the ESVEM trial. Additionally, excess noncoronary disease in EP-guided patients and excess beta-blocker used in HM-guided patients did not influence the results in the ESVEM trial.", 
    "42": "The Electrophysiologic Study Versus Electrocardiographic Monitoring (ESVEM) trial was completed in 1992 and the primary results were reported in 1993. Since then, considerable discussion about this trial has taken place and new trial results have been reported. Trial analysis has yielded seven principal findings to date concerning treatment of patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias, ie: (1) similar accuracy of electrophysiologic study (EPS), Holter monitoring (HM), and EPS combined with HM for predicting antiarrhythmic drug efficacy; (2) greater efficiency and lower cost of HM; (3) improved survival associated with predicted drug efficacy; (4) predictors of response to EPS and HM; (5) greater efficacy and lower cost of therapy with sotalol compared with drugs with class-l effects; (6) lack of a relationship between presenting and recurring arrhythmia; and (7) preponderance of nonarrhythmic deaths in trial participants. A number of additional specific findings of the trial are reviewed in this symposium. Several criticisms of the trial's enrollment, methods, and efficacy criteria are reviewed and discussed. Some criticisms are valid. Many are related to misunderstandings of ESVEM trial methodology and to bias of the individual critics. Some are simply incorrect. The importance of the ESVEM trial in the present day may be limited by the growing use of implanted devices rather than drugs for treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. If clinical trials ultimately prove devices to be no more effective than drugs, the findings of the ESVEM investigators will grow in importance.",

    "61": "The intact ciliary epithelial bilayer of the rabbit eye isolated by perfusion was mounted in a specially constructed Ussing-type chamber. The transepithelial potential difference and short-circuit current were monitored for effects induced by agents that stimulated or blocked (some did both) caMP production.

Maximal stimulation of cAMP with forskolin in this pure isolated epithelial preparation yields a response that is 60% of the value found in whole processes, indicating that the latter tissue contains responsive sites that are nonepithelial, probably vascular, or perhaps stromal. The degree of inhibition of the beta adrenergic receptor by alpha-2 agonists was not very different in the two preparations. On the other hand, inhibition of the epithelial vasointestinal peptide receptor by neuropeptide Y or alpha-2 agonism was considerably heightened in the pure bilayered epithelial preparation.",

The results obtained in the isolated intact purely epithelial ciliary bilayer confirm that the ciliary epithelium is the source of adrenergic receptor activation and interaction and support the hypothesis that aqueous humor production is regulated by interactions between epithelial alpha-2 and beta adrenergic receptors.", 
    "64": "cAMP and the insulinotropic peptides that raise cAMP glucose-dependently increase the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in pancreatic beta-cells, which is tightly linked to the potentiation of glucose-induced insulin release. We examined whether cAMP increases [Ca2+]i in specific cooperation only with glucose or also with other insulin secretagogues that act through different mechanisms. [Ca2+]i in single rat pancreatic beta-cells was measured by dual-wavelength fura-2 microfluorometry. In the presence of a stimulatory concentration of glucose (8.3 mmol/l) and the moderate elevation in [Ca2+]i induced by it, forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, or dibutyryl cAMP produced a marked additional increase in [Ca2+]i but was ineffective at the basal 2.8 mmol/l glucose. These cAMP-elevating agents also potentiated the effect of tolbutamide on [Ca2+]i. The cAMP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was completely and selectively inhibited by a blocker of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and by nitrendipine, a blocker of the L-type Ca2+ channel. However, in the presence of high KCl and the [Ca2+]i elevation induced by it, a rise in cAMP failed to further increase [Ca2+]i, whereas BAY K8644, an agonist of L-type Ca2+ channels, evoked an additional increase in [Ca2+]i. Under low Na+ conditions, the [Ca2+]i response to cAMP was observed in the majority of the cells. In the cells in which glucose at 4.5-5 mmol/l was inadequate to increase [Ca2+]i, the glucose together with a rise in cAMP often increased [Ca2+]i. Likewise, tolbutamide and a rise in cAMP acted in concert to increase [Ca2+]i. Thus, cAMP left-shifted the concentration-[Ca2+]i response relationship for glucose and tolbutamide. In conclusion, the cAMP-PKA pathway acts in selective synergism with glucose and tolbutamide to initiate [Ca2+]i signals in pancreatic beta- cells. cAMP appears to regulate beta-cell sensitivity to glucose and tolbutamide. In contrast, cAMP fails to cooperate with high KCl to increase [Ca2+]i. It is suggested that cAMP acts mainly on a site that is more proximal but functionally linked to the L-type Ca2+ channel, thereby finally increasing Ca2+ influx through this channel.", 
    "65": "In the present study the effect of nicotine on naloxone-induced jumping behaviour in morphine-dependent mice was examined. In addition, the modulatory role of dopaminergic, adrenergic and cholinergic mechanisms upon the effect of nicotine were investigated. Animals were rendered dependent on morphine by subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of morphine sulfate 3 times a day for 3 days, and jumping behaviour was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of naloxone 2 h after the tenth injection of morphine sulfate on day 4. Nicotine (0.001-2 mg/kg s.c.) caused a significant decrease in withdrawal jumping behaviour in morphine-dependent mice. The effect of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (0.01-0.1 mg/kg i.p.) but not by the peripheral nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p.) nor the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (2.5-10 mg/kg i.p.). The dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (R-(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5- phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine-7-ol maleate) (0.01-0.5 mg/kg s.c.) reduced the response induced by nicotine. The dopamine receptor antagonist sulpiride (25 and 50 mg/kg s.c.) and the adrenoceptor antagonists phenoxybenzamine (5 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) and propranolol (5 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) were without an effect. The results indicate that the effect of nicotine on naloxone-induced jumping is mediated by central nicotinic receptors.",

    "70": "1. The electrophysiological properties and beta-adrenergic regulation of a non-inactivating K+ current were studied using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique (22 +/- 2 degrees C) in adult rat ventricular cells. 2. In the presence of 4-aminopyridine, an inhibitor of the rapidly inactivating current, the depolarization-activated current consisted only of a slowly decaying outward current (IK). The presence of a non-inactivating current (ISS) was revealed when analysing inactivation curves. 3. IK and ISS were both sensitive to 50 mM tetraethylammonium and 10 mM 4-aminopyridine inhibition. IK was totally blocked by 100 microM clofilium, while ISS was not inhibited but rather enhanced by this class III anti-arrhythmic agent. 4. Unlike IK, ISS was only slightly decreased by depolarizing prepulses and it did not show time-dependent inactivation when measured during 500 ms depolarizations. 5. ISS was decreased by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (1 microM). Forskolin (10 microM) mimicked the effects of isoprenaline. The non-specific beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (3 microM), and a specific beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, CGP 20712A (0.3 microM), both prevented the effects of isoprenaline. Cell perfusion with 100 microM PKI6-22, a peptide inhibitor of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, reduced or abolished the effects of isoprenaline. 6. The dose-response curve for the inhibition of ISS by isoprenaline was positioned to the left of that for the calcium current. The threshold dose and the dose giving 50% of the maximal effect were, respectively, 0.1 and 0.21 nM for ISS and 1 and 4.3 nM for ICa. 7. In view of the high sensitivity of ISS to isoprenaline, its possible physiological effect was evaluated on action potential duration during beta-adrenergic stimulation. At 1 nM, a concentration that did not increase ICa, isoprenaline induced a significant prolongation of action potential duration as a consequence of ISS inhibition. With 1 microM isoprenaline, the action potential was further prolonged, due largely to an evoked increase in ICa. 8. In conclusion, a K+ current displaying a weak voltage-dependent inactivation is present in rat ventricular cells. It is inhibited by stimulation of beta 1-adrenergic receptors and is highly sensitive to phosphorylation by protein kinase A. This current may play an important role in the neuromodulation of excitation-contraction coupling.", 
    "71": "Beta 1- and beta 3-adrenoceptor mRNA and protein expression, and contribution of each subtype to the catecholamine-sensitive adenylyl cyclase system were studied during the adipose conversion of the murine 3T3-F442A cell line. Northern and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that emergence of beta 3-adrenoceptor transcripts was concomittant with that of the gene encoding adipsin, a very late marker of adipose differentiation. Conversely, the induction of the beta 1-adrenoceptor mRNA occurred early after cell commitment towards adipose conversion. Changes in beta-subtype gene expression were accompanied by parallel modifications in receptor expression and function. 125I-cyanopindolol saturation and competition binding experiments showed a 3-fold increase in beta 1-adrenoceptor density in day 3 post-confluent cells. The beta 3-subtype population became detectable later and represented approximately 95% of total beta-adrenoceptors in day 8 and day 12 post-confluent cells. Adenylyl cyclase activity in response to the beta 3-adrenoceptor-selective agonists CGP12177 (4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazol-2-one), ICI201651 ([(R)-4-(2 hydroxy-3-phenoxypropylamino-ethoxy)-N-(2- methoxyethyl)phenoxy-acetamide]) and cyanopindolol was virtually absent in young adipocytes, but dramatically increased in mature cells. The respective contributions of the beta 1- and the beta 3-subtypes to the production of cAMP were resolved by an Eadie-Hofstee computer analysis of isoproterenol and norepinephrine concentration-response curve of adenylyl cyclase activity. Agonist response curves in the presence of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist indicated that the beta 1-subtype accounted for the totality of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation in young adipocytes. In mature adipose cells approximately 90% of this response was due to an activation of the beta 3-adrenoceptor. In addition, approximately 84% of the maximal norepinephrine-stimulated lipolysis was mediated by the beta 3-adrenoceptor in fully differentiated adipocytes. The differentiation-dependent expression of beta-subtypes in adipocytes is a biphasic process involving an initial and moderate induction of beta 1-adrenoceptors followed by the emergence of a prominent beta 3-adrenoceptor population. Compared analysis of both receptor occupancy and cAMP production shows that the beta 3-subtype is more efficiently coupled to the adenylyl cyclase system than the beta 1-adrenoceptor. Thus in mature adipose cells this receptor subtype represents the core of cAMP-dependent regulation of the lipolytic, antilipogenic and thermogenic effects of catecholamines.", 
    "72": "Spectral analysis was recently chosen to characterize the fast oscillations, depending on the autonomic nervous system, in heart rate and blood pressure variabilities. Humoral stimuli could impinge on the low-frequency domain of blood pressure variability since the time lag to humoral system activation is greater. This study was designed to analyse low-frequency components of short-term variability of blood pressure of conscious rats in conditions where humoral systems were activated. We studied rats with two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertension in which the blood pressure level was dependent upon the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems. Spectral powers of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were computed in the high (respiratory)-, mid (0.2-0.6 Hz)- and low (0.02-0.2 Hz)-frequency bands, as detected by the fast Fourier transform technique in consecutive 102-s stationary periods. Hypertensive rats exhibited a marked low-frequency component of systolic (+261%) and diastolic (+169%) blood pressure variabilities when compared to sham-operated animals. First, losartan, a selective non-peptide angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist, reduced this low-frequency component (-44% and -25% for systolic and diastolic blood pressure). In a second series of hypertensive rats, HOE 140, D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]bradykinin, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, decreased the low-frequency component of systolic (-28%) and diastolic (-40%) blood pressure. Losartan, added after HOE 140, induced a supplementary decrease of the low-frequency component (-60% and -42% for systolic and diastolic blood pressure). After the combined blockade, the low-frequency components of systolic and diastolic blood pressure variabilities of the hypertensive rats were equivalent to those of the control rats. Two-kidney, one-clip hypertension was also associated with an elevation of the mid-frequency component of the systolic blood pressure (+55%). The administration of HOE 140 did not change this component while losartan, alone or added after HOE 140, led to an increase (around +100%) in mid-frequency oscillations of systolic blood pressure. The high-frequency oscillations of systolic blood pressure were increased by losartan in the two series of hypertensive rats. Losartan increased the mid-frequency component of heart rate variability in sham-operated rats while the heart rate variability was not modified during any of the treatment periods in two-kidney, one-clip rats. In conclusion, an increase in the low-frequency component of blood pressure variability was observed in a model of hypertension where the blood pressure is dependent upon humoral activities. The reduction of the slow fluctuations following the combined blockade of the kallikrein-kinin and the renin-angiotensin systems suggested the contribution of these humoral systems to this low-frequency component of blood pressure variability.", 
    "73": "The relative importance of 5-HT1A and beta-adrenergic activities in the antiaggressive effects of (-)-penbutolol was studied in male mice. (-)-Penbutolol had high affinity for 5-HT1A receptors and beta-adrenoceptors, and antagonized the 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT)-induced 5-HT syndrome and the 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamin)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT)-induced discriminatory stimulus in rats. (-)-Penbutolol abolished aggressive behaviour (ED50 = 56 mumol/kg), and reversed the antiaggressive effects of 8-OH-DPAT and 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP) (ED50 = 8.1 and 2.1 mumol/kg, respectively). (N-[2-[4-(2-Methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY 100635) reversed the antiaggressive effects of 8-OH-DPAT (ED50 = 0.012 mumol/kg), but did not affect the antiaggressive effects of TFMPP. The antiaggressive effect of a submaximal dose of 8-OH-DPAT was markedly potentiated by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists without 5-HT1A receptor affinity, whereas (-)-penbutolol was effective at only one dose (4.5 mumol/kg). In conclusion, the 5-HT1A receptor antagonistic potency of (-)-penbutolol in aggressive mice is attenuated by beta-adrenoceptor-induced facilitation of serotonergic neurotransmission.", 
    "74": "The levels of mRNA coding for the uncoupling protein (UCP) and for lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were monitored in the brown adipose tissue of newborn rat pups. At 5 h after birth, the mRNA levels of UCP and LPL were high in pups exposed singly to 28 degrees C and low in pups kept singly at thermoneutrality (36 degrees C); in pups staying with the dam, the UCP mRNA levels were intermediate. However, the LPL mRNA levels were lower in pups staying with the dam than in pups at 36 degrees C, implying that factors additional to environmental temperature influenced LPL gene expression. Injection of noradrenaline into pups at thermoneutrality (36 degrees C) led to increases in UCP and LPL gene expression, but noradrenaline injections had no further effect in cold-exposed pups. The adrenergic effects were mediated via beta-adrenergic receptors. The cold-induced increases in both UCP and LPL gene expression were abolished by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Thus differences in adrenergic responsiveness could not explain the differential expression of the UCP and LPL genes observed in pups staying with the dam. The presence of a physiological suppressor was examined by feeding single pups at 28 degrees C with different foods: nothing, water, Intralipid, cow's milk, rat milk and rat colostrum. None of these agents led to suppression of UCP gene expression, but colostrum led to a selective suppression of LPL gene expression. It was concluded that the genes for UCP and LPL were responsive to adrenergic stimuli immediately after birth, and it is suggested that a component of rat colostrum can selectively suppress LPL gene expression.", 
    "75": "We consider clinical trials in which information is available about subjects' treatment changes after randomization. To understand whether any difference between randomized groups in the intention-to-treat analysis can be explained by such treatment changes, we need analysis strategies which take account of treatment actually received. Selection bias is then a potentially serious problem. We relate risk in a time-dependent proportional hazards model to current treatment, with treatment combinations coded in two alternative ways. To reduce selection bias, treatment history (number of treatments dropped) and baseline covariates can be added to the model. Including current risk markers would also reduce selection bias but makes interpretation difficult. The methods are illustrated using data from the British Medical Research Council (MRC) elderly hypertension trial, with time to cardiovascular death as an outcome. Results for the comparison of diuretic and beta-blocker treatment are similar in all analyses, suggesting that selection bias is small and adding support to the hypothesis that the observed treatment differences are due to the randomized treatments themselves.", 
    "76": "The quinolinone compounds OPC-8212 (vesnarinone), OPC-18790, and OPC-8490 are members of a family of unique positive inotropic compounds that have no positive chronotropic effects. In subjects with heart failure, the prototypic compound OPC-8212 may reduce morbidity and mortality at low doses but increase mortality at high doses.", 
    "77": "To further characterize the inotropic mechanism(s) of action of these compounds, we investigated the effects of OPC-8490, a water-soluble quinolinone, on the inotropic response, inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE), and action potential in human ventricular myocardial preparations. In isolated right ventricular trabeculae and membranes prepared from left ventricular myocardium, OPC-8490 produced dose-related positive inotropic effects, inhibited type III PDE activity, and prolonged action potential. Comparative experiments with other PDE inhibitors, sodium channel agonists, and potassium channel antagonists indicated that the positive inotropic effects are due to PDE inhibition, whereas the action potential effects of OPC-8490 are due to effects on ion channels.", 
    "78": "We conclude that OPC-8490 produces selective positive inotropic effects because of type III PDE inhibition combined with ion channel effects, with the latter property inhibiting the positive chronotropic response usually associated with agents that increase intracellular cAMP concentrations.", 
    "79": "In the evaluation of patients with ventricular arrhythmias, those patients with asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, who usually comprise a low-risk population, have to be differentiated from patients with symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias (presyncopal symptoms, syncope, cardiac arrest). In general, patients with asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias should not be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs; however, patients with recent myocardial infarction and asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, which may indicate an increased risk of sudden death, should undergo further risk stratification, since some of them might benefit from preventive antiarrhythmic therapy with a beta-blocking agent of amiodarone. In contrast to asymptomatic patients, patients with symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias are at high risk for sudden death, and, if functional status does not mandate against active therapy, these patients should undergo coronary angiography and electrophysiologic evaluation. Revascularization procedures and specific antiarrhythmic measures such as antiarrhythmic drug therapy, ablative therapy (surgical resection or transcatheter radiofrequency ablation of the arrhythmogenic focus) or the implantation of a cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) are frequently needed in such patients. Consequently, in this high-risk population, early referral to a cardiac center with an electrophysiologic laboratory is recommended, whereas it should be strongly mandated against empirical antiarrhythmic drug therapy.", 
    "80": "The most convenient way to perform supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of liquid sample matrices is to combine it with solid-phase extraction (SPE). beta-Blockers from urine were collected on an Empore disc, which was then placed into an extraction cell for derivatization and SFE. SPE recovery was best at pH 10. Effects of temperature, pressure and volume of pyridine on the acetylation and SFE processes were studied. Without acetylation the beta-blockers were not significantly soluble in CO2. SFE temperatures of 70 degree C and 150 degree C together with 200 microliters of acetic anhydride and 400 microliters pyridine gave the best results. With the SPE-SFE-GC-MS method developed here, beta-blockers like oxprenolol, metoprolol and propranolol could easily be detected in urine samples, and the limit of detection (LOD) for these compounds was found to be 20 ng/ml, 30 ng/ml and 40 ng/ml, respectively.", 
    "81": "Heart failure is at the same time a muscular and a neurohormonal disease. This explains the current therapeutic choices: in particular digitalis, ACE inhibitors, spironolactone and in certain patients even beta-blocking agents. Two different types of heart failure are distinguished today: systolic failure with pump failure and diastolic failure with deranged ventricular filling. In the elderly, the two entities occur either together or individually. A precise and early diagnosis is important for an appropriate treatment to be instituted as early as possible, even in the case of asymptomatic or subclinical heart failure.", 
    "82": "The effect of neuropeptide Y on the number of perivascular carbon deposits, assessed as a measure of lung vascular permeability, was examined in isolated perfused lung preparations of rats. The number of carbon particle deposits after bronchial application of neuropeptide Y was increased in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, norepinephrine augmented the effects of neuropeptide Y. Peptide YY, an analog of neuropeptide Y, demonstrated a much lower potency for increasing the number of carbon deposits, and neuropeptide Y-(18-36), which elicits a weak antagonist action on the neuropeptide Y Y3 receptor, significantly decreased the neuropeptide Y-induced increase. Furthermore, examination of the influence of neuropeptide Y-(18-36) pretreatment on fibrin-induced neurogenic pulmonary edema, in rats, revealed a reduction of the protein concentration ratio of tracheal fluid to serum. Therefore, we conclude that neuropeptide Y may elevate vascular permeability in the pulmonary circulation, conceivably through the neuropeptide Y Y3 receptor, and that neuropeptide Y may in fact play a physiological role even in the in-situ pulmonary circulation.", 
    "83": "Myocardial infarction represents a crossroads in the natural history of coronary artery disease. The prognosis is determined by the severity of coronary artery disease, infarct size (and hence ejection fraction), and age of the patient. After infarction, patients may remain symptomless, or suffer angina, silent ischemia, reinfarction, heart failure or sudden death. Hence patient management after infarction includes (1) estimation of risk, (2) the use of stress tests to detect ischemia and rhythm disorders, (3) PTCA or bypass if required and (4) medical therapy. Cardiac catheterization is indicated in patients with angina or silent ischemia, non-Q wave infarction or large infarctus; its use is less well established in patients without ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction, but this indication is nevertheless increasingly accepted. PTCA is primarily utilized in patients with single or two vessel disease, while coronary bypass surgery is indicated in patients with left main or three vessel disease. All these measures are designed to improve symptoms and prognosis. For secondary prevention medical therapy should be used to treat cardiovascular risk factors (antihypertensive drugs, lipid-lowering drugs etc.), to inhibit platelets (aspirin, ticlopidine) or coagulation (coumarins), to block neurohumoral activation (betablocker, ACE-inhibitors), for vasoconstriction (calcium channel blockers, nitrates) and to suppress arrhythmias. The large number of drugs requires reasoned use depending on the risk profile of the individual patient. Cardiovascular risk factors should be treated appropriately. Platelet inhibitors should be given to all patients except those with atrial fibrillation or large ventricles (coumarins). Betablockers reduce mortality, reinfarction and sudden death after infarction and hence should be used if no contraindications exist. ACE-inhibitors are particularly effective in improving symptoms and prognosis in patients with impaired left ventricular function. Calcium antagonists should be used with caution and only in patients with normal left ventricular function. Nitrates are primarily effective in improving symptoms in patients with angina or heart failure. Antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone) are only useful in patients with complex arrhythmias. Digitalis has been shown to improve symptoms in patients with heart failure, while other inotropic drugs are virtually no longer used. These guidelines allow reasoned differential therapy after myocardial infarction to the maximum benefit of the patient and at minimum cost.", 
    "84": "Intracellular recording techniques were used to study neurotransmitter release in the guinea-pig isolated vas deferens. Low concentrations of the irreversible and selective N-type calcium channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA have previously been shown to block excitatory junction potentials evoked by low frequencies (< or = 1 Hz) of nerve stimulation. Here we report a component of action potential-evoked release which is insensitive to high concentrations of omega-conotoxin GVIA. We have termed this component \"residual release\" and show (i) it is positively frequency-dependent, (ii) its magnitude is dependent on both the train length and interval between trains, (iii) \"residual release\" can be modulated through prejunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors and (iv) \"residual release\" is insensitive to many calcium entry blockers but abolished by omega-grammotoxin SIA and cadmium ions. Although noradrenaline is released by nerve action potentials, residual excitatory junction potentials were abolished by alpha,beta-methylene-ATP and therefore resulted entirely from the actions of neuronally released ATP acting through postjunctional P2x-purinoceptors. The results suggest that calcium entry through a novel, pharmacologically uncharacterized voltage-dependent calcium channel is responsible for \"residual release\" in sympathetic nerve terminals. It seems that in response to single or short trains of nerve action potentials, N-type calcium channels dominate the release process. However, at higher frequencies other voltage-dependent calcium channels are recruited and these may have an important role to play in triggering the mechanisms underlying frequency-dependent facilitation.", 
    "85": "The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is part of a family of proteins that mediate the uptake of lipoproteins into cells. In this paper we have demonstrated the over-expression in E. coli of a rat LDL receptor fusion protein that contains the region of the receptor sharing homology with the EGF precursor. The fusion protein was utilized to immunize rabbits and successfully generate antibodies that recognize the intact LDL receptor. These anti-LDL receptor/fusion protein antibodies were used to examine the effects of cyclic AMP on the expression of LDL receptors in isolated rat adipocytes. Incubation of adipocytes with isoproterenol caused a dose-dependent diminution in intact LDL receptors in the plasma membrane with the concomitant appearance of smaller immunoreactive proteins. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that isoproterenol rapidly shortened the initial half-life of intact, immunoprecipitable LDL receptors in the plasma membrane. The effects of isoproterenol on LDL receptor expression were mimicked by forskolin, by an analog of cyclic AMP, and by ACTH. In contrast, incubation with propranolol blocked the effects of isoproterenol on LDL receptor expression. While antioxidants and several different protease inhibitors had no effects, N-acetyl-leucine-leucine-methionine (ALLM) was able to prevent the isoproterenol-induced effects on LDL receptors. Thus, it appears that agents acting via cyclic AMP cause a rapid decrease in LDL receptors in the plasma membranes of isolated adipose cells due to the apparent stimulation of an ALLM-sensitive protease that degrades the LDL receptor. These results suggest a novel mechanism for the posttranscriptional regulation of LDL receptor expression in adipocytes.", 
    "86": "The present study was designed to compare the in vitro vasorelaxant responses to the bipyridine compound amrinone of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) precontracted aortic strips isolated from newborn (2 to 3 days old) and nonpregnant adult rabbits. Changes in forces were recorded isometrically. The effects of isoproterenol (beta-adrenergic receptor stimulator), forskolin (direct activator of adenylate cyclase) and theophylline (non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor) were also studied simultaneously. The vasodilator responses to amrinone, forskolin and theophylline in aortic strips from neonates were comparable to those of strips from adults. In contrast, the maximum relaxations to isoproterenol were significantly reduced in those from neonates as compared with those from adults, suggesting that beta-adrenergic receptor mediated responses are not fully developed in the neonate. The mean value for the ED50 concentration (half the maximum response) for amrinone, isoproterenol and theophylline was 1.10 +/- 0.10 x 10(-4) M, 3.47 +/- 1.31 x 10(-8) M and 1.53 +/- 0.10 x 10(-4) M, respectively, in the neonatal group and 1.17 +/- 0.19 x 10(-4) M, 3.75 +/- 1.11 x 10(-8) M and 1.75 +/- 0.06 x 10(-4) M, respectively, in the adult group; there were no significant differences between the neonatal and adult preparations. We concluded that the vasorelaxation produced by phosphodiesterase inhibitors demonstrated no maturation-related changes probably due to a stable cyclic AMP turnover through an unaltered phosphodiesterase activity in newborn and adult arteries.", 
    "87": "To compare the permeability characteristics of HT29-18-C1 colonic epithelial cell line with Caco-2, an established model of intestinal drug transport.", 
    "88": "Cell lines were grown as epithelial monolayers. Permeability was measured over a range of transepithelial electrical resistance (Rt) using a group of drug compounds.", 
    "89": "HT29-18-C1 develop Rt slowly when grown in culture, allowing permeability to be measured over a wide range (80-600 Omega x cm2). In contrast, Caco-2 monolayers rapidly develop Rt of approximately equal 300 Omega x cm2 and require Ca2+ -chelation to generate Rt equivalent to human intestine (60-120 Omega x cm2). Permeability of atenolol, ranitidine, cimetidine, hydrochlorothiazide and mannitol across HT29-18-C1 decreased 4-5 fold as Rt developed from 100-300 Omega x cm2 indicating they permeate via the paracellular route. In contrast, ondansetron showed no difference in permeability with changing Rt consistent with transcellular permeation. Permeability profiles across low Rt HT29-18C1 and pulse EGTA-treated Caco-2 monolayers were the same for all 5 paracellular drugs suggesting that transient Ca2+ removal does not alter selectivity of the tight junctions. Permeabilities of cimetidine, hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol across 100 Omega x cm2 HT29-18-C1 monolayers reflect more closely those reported for the human ileum in vivo than did mature Caco-2 monolayers.", 
    "90": "HT29-18-C1 monolayers can be used to study drug permeability at Rt values similar to human intestine without the need for Ca2+ chelation. As such, they offer a useful alternative to Caco-2 for modelling intestinal drug absorption.", 
    "91": "The bioavailability patterns of a 100 mg metoprolol controlled release tablet and a 10 mg bisoprolol normal release tablet were compared in a single dose crossover study in 12 healthy subjects. The plasma drug concentration levels were measured for 36 h post-dose, using HPLC with fluorimetric detection. The 2 formulations were equally well tolerated, headache being the most frequently reported adverse event. Episodes of bradycardia (heart rate < 50 bpm) occurred at a similar rate with both formulations. The plasma metoprolol profile differed significantly (p < 0.05) from the bisoprolol profile regarding time to maximum concentration, mean residence time, the ratio of peak concentration (Cmax) to the area under the curve (AUC) and the plateau time as estimated from the half-value duration. The average drug plasma concentration observed 24 h after administration still accounted for 54% of the Cmax value for the metoprolol controlled release tablet, but only 23% with the bisoprolol normal release tablet. A large inter-individual variability was seen in the bioavailability of metoprolol, with 3 subjects (characterised as CYP2D6 deficient) exhibiting AUC values 8 - 10 times larger than in the other subjects. The controlled release pattern of the formulation was similar in slow and fast metabolizers. No such variability pattern was apparent for bisoprolol. The findings allow to conclude that, after administration of the metoprolol controlled release tablet, the rate of absorption of the active principle is significantly slower, therefore yielding more constant plasma concentration levels over the 24 h post-dose period, than after administration of the bisoprolol normal release tablet.", 
    "92": "To test the hypothesis that altitude exposure increases glucose utilization and that this increment is mediated by a beta-adrenergic mechanism, the effects of hypobaric hypoxia and beta-blockade on glucose rates of appearance (Ra), disappearance (Rd), oxidation (Rox), and leg uptake [G = 2(arteriovenous glucose difference)(1 - leg blood flow)] were measured during rest and a given submaximal exercise task. We studied six healthy beta-blocked (beta) men [26.7 +/- 1.2 (SE) yr, 74.0 +/- 6.6 kg] and five matched controls (C; 26 +/- 1.2 yr, 69.3 +/- 2.6 kg) in energy and nitrogen balance during rest and leg cycle-ergometer exercise at sea level, on acute altitude exposure to 4,300 m (barometric pressure = 463 Torr), and after 3 wk of habituation. Subjects received a primed continuous infusion of [6,6-2H]- and [1-13C]glucose, rested for > or = 90 min, and then immediately exercised for 45 min at 89 W, which elicited 49% of sea-level peak O2 consumption (VO2peak; 65% of altitude VO2peak). At sea level, resting Ra was 1.47 +/- 0.19 and 1.66 +/- 0.16 mg x kg-1 x min-1 for C and beta, respectively, and increased to 3.04 +/- 0.25 and 3.56 +/- 0.27 mg x kg-1 x min-1, respectively, during exercise. Thus glucose Ra was significantly increased by beta-blockade during rest and exercise at sea level. At sea level, beta-blockade increased leg G, which accounted for 49 and 69% of glucose disposal during exercise in C and beta, respectively. On acute altitude exposure, glucose Ra rose significantly during rest and exercise relative to sea level, whereas blockade continued to augment this increment. During exercise on acute exposure, G increased more than at sea level and accounted for a greater percentage (80 and 97%, respectively) of Rd in C and beta during exercise. Similarly, Rox values, particularly during exercise, were increased significantly at altitude relative to sea level, and beta-blockade potentiated this effect. During a given submaximal exercise task after acclimatization, glucose Ra, Rox, and G were increased relative to sea level, but these increments were less than those in response to exercise measured on acute exposure. We conclude that altitude exposure increases glucose use during rest and a given submaximal exercise bout and beta-blockade exaggerates the response.", 
    "93": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, on the nocturnal masseter muscle activity of a heavy sleep bruxist. Three all-night polysomnographic registrations were performed with bilateral masseter muscle EMG recordings. The first night study served as the baseline night, the second night registration was performed after total sleep deprivation and the third night registration was made with propranolol. Sleep deprivation decreased the masseter contraction (MC) index by 61% and propranolol by 72% when compared to the level of the baseline night. This preliminary observation is in line with our hypothesis suggesting a link between autonomic regulation of circulation and rhythmic activation of masticatory muscles, especially when associated with body movements during sleep.", 
    "94": "The presence of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in the forehead microcirculation was investigated in 49 healthy subjects. Local vascular responses to noradrenaline, isoprenaline and adrenergic antagonists, administered transcutaneously by iontophoresis, were monitored via laser Doppler flowmetry. Iontophoresis of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine induced a persistent increase in skin blood flow, whereas iontophoresis of saline induced a minor increase in skin blood flow which subsided rapidly. Skin blood flow increased moderately after the iontophoresis of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Pretreatment of the experimental site with phentolamine blocked the normal vasoconstrictor response to noradrenaline, and unmasked a minor vasodilator component of response in some subjects. Iontophoresis of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline induced dose-dependent vasodilatation which was antagonised by propranolol. These findings indicate that alpha-adrenoceptors in the forehead microcirculation normally mediate a vasoconstrictor response to iontophoretically-applied noradrenaline. In addition, beta-adrenoceptors appear to mediate a minor vasodilator component of response.", 
    "95": "Effect of different doses of centrally administered brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) were examined in rats with respect to anxiolytic properties in an elevated plus-maze model. BNP in doses of 100, 200 and 400 ng, and CNP in doses of 100 and 200 ng abolished the normal preference for the closed arms of the maze, and increased the percentage time spent in the open arms; this is consistent with an 'anxiolytic-like' effect. Doses of 50 and 1000 ng BNP, and of 25, 50, 400 and 1000 ng CNP produced no behavioural effects in the elevated plus-maze model. Pretreatment with an alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist or a muscarinergic cholinergic blocker, antagonized the effect of 200 ng BNP in the elevated plus-maze test. The 'anxiolytic-like' effects of a BNP were not modulated by a dopaminergic blocker, an alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist, a GABA receptor antagonist, a 5-HT receptor antagonist or an opiate antagonist. The 'anxiolytic-like' effect of CNP was prevented by a dopamine receptor antagonist, or an alpha- or beta-adrenoreceptor blocker but not by a muscarinergic cholinergic blocker, a GABA receptor, a 5-HT receptor antagonist or an opiate receptor antagonist. These results suggest that multiple neurotransmitter system activation might be responsible for the BNP and CNP-induced 'anxiolytic-like' activity.", 
    "96": "In vivo pharmacokinetic and brain binding characteristics of [18F]RP 62203, a selective high-affinity serotonergic 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, were assessed in the rat following intravenous injection of trace amount of the radioligand. The radioactive distribution profile observed in the brain 60 min after injection was characterized by greater than fourfold higher uptake in neocortex as compared to cerebellum (0.38 +/- 0.07% injected dose/g, % ID/g and 0.08 +/- 0.01 ID/g, respectively), consistent with in vivo specific binding to the 5-HT2A receptor. Furthermore, specific [18F]RP 62203 binding significantly correlated with the reported in vitro distribution of 5-HT2A receptors, but not with known concentration profiles of dopaminergic D2 or adrenergic alpha 1 receptors. Finally, detectable specific binding was abolished by pretreatment with large doses of ritanserin, a selective 5-HT2A antagonist, which resulted in uniform uptakes across cortical, striatal and cerebellar tissues. Thus, [18F]RP 62203 appears to be a promising selective tool to visualize and quantify 5-HT2A brain receptors in vivo with positron emission tomography.", 
    "97": "The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist carazolol has been labelled with fluorine-18 in the isopropyl group via a reductive alkylation by [18F]-fluoroacetone of the corresponding (S)-desisopropyl compound according to a known procedure. The introduction of fluorine in the isopropyl group creates a new stereogenic centre resulting in the formation of (S,S)- and (S,R)-1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol, which were separated by HPLC. Tissue distribution studies were performed in male Wistar rats. Both the (S,S)- and (S,R)-diastereomers (S.A. 500-2000 Ci/mmol; 18.5-74 TBq/mmol) showed high uptake in lung and heart, which could be blocked by pretreatment of the animals with (+/-)-propranolol. No significant differences were observed between the biodistribution of the two diastereomers. Metabolite analysis showed a rapid appearance of polar metabolites in plasma, while at 60 min postinjection 92% and 82% of the total radioactivity in lung and heart was unmetabolized 1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol. In a PET-study with male Wistar rats, the lungs were clearly visualized and the pulmonary uptake was decreased after pretreatment of the animals with (+/-)-propranolol. The heart could not be visualized. Similar results were obtained in PET-studies with lambs.", 
    "98": "Results of an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of hypertension treatment in Sweden are presented. The cost per life-year gained decreases with age for both men and women and is relatively low for middle-aged and older men and women even in the blood pressure range 90-94 mmHg. The results indicate that it is in general cost-effective to treat middle-aged and older men and women in Sweden with a diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mmHg, but that it is questionable whether it is in general cost-effective to treat younger men and women with mild hypertension. It is furthermore shown that ACE-inhibitors and calcium-antagonists may be cost-effective in some patient groups at a high risk of coronary heart disease, if they achieve the epidemiologically expected risk reduction for coronary heart disease. Since an improved risk reduction has not been demonstrated in clinical trials ACE-inhibitors and calcium-antagonists cannot, however, at present be recommended for hypertension treatment in any patient groups unless treatment with diuretics and beta-blockers is contraindicated.", 
    "99": "Intraperitoneal administration of m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) to Wistar rats produced hyperthermia with a peak effect at 30 min. Pretreatment with low doses of metergoline (5-HT1/5-HT2 antagonist), mesulergine and mianserin (5-HT2C/5-HT2A antagonists) blocked m-CPP-induced hyperthermia. Pretreatment with propranolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that also has binding affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2B sites), yohimbine (alpha 2-noradrenergic antagonist that also has binding affinity for 5-HT2B sites), MDL-72222 or ondansetron (5-HT3 antagonists) did not attenuate m-CPP-induced hyperthermia. Only high doses of ketanserin, LY-53857 and ritanserin (5-HT2A/5-HT2C antagonists) as well as spiperone (5-HT1A/5-HT2A/D2 antagonist) attenuated m-CPP-induced hyperthermia. Daily administration of m-CPP produced complete tolerance to its hyperthermic effect by day 5. However, there was no cross-tolerance to 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI, a 5-HT2A agonist that also has high affinity for 5-HT2C receptors)-induced hyperthermia. m-CPP-induced increases in temperature were found to be significantly less in the Fawn-Hooded (FH) rat strain as compared to the Wistar rat strain; in prior studies, FH rats have been found to be subsensitive to other 5-HT2C-mediated pharmacologic responses. Altogether, these findings suggest that m-CPP-induced hyperthermia in rats is mediated by selective stimulation of 5-HT2C receptors.", 
    "100": "The effects of betaxolol on Ca(2+)-induced contractions in saponin-treated skinned canine renal arteries were examined. Betaxolol decreased the pCa (-log[Ca2+] M) 5.8-induced contraction at the same concentrations at which the drug relaxed the high K(+)-induced contraction in intact smooth muscles. The pCa-tension relation was shifted to the right and downward by betaxolol. Betaxolol inhibited the increase in Ca(2+)-induced contraction by calmodulin, and this effect of betaxolol was observed even at the concentration that had no effect when given alone. These results suggest that betaxolol decreases the Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile system in skinned canine renal arteries, presumably by inhibiting calmodulin-mediated contractions.", 
    "101": "Sleep-related painful erections (SRPE) are characterized by penile pain that occurs during erections, typically during REM sleep. Afflicted individuals usually have normal erections during wakefulness. The disorder could be related to an altered autonomic function only during sleep. The aim of this study was to evaluate tonic and phasic heart rate (HR) modifications during sleep in 10 SRPE patients compared to 25 age-matched controls. A reduced cardiac vagal activity during sleep, as well as a trend towards a higher HR acceleration in relation to spontaneous body movements, have been found in SRPE patients. The possible beta-adrenergic hyperactivity during sleep in these patients could explain the reported efficacy of a beta-blocker, such as propranolol, in this disorder.",

Ibutilide significantly increased atrial flutter cycle length (AFL CL) 11 +/- 2 msec and atrial effective refractory period (AERP) 13 +/- 2 msec, and terminated atrial flutter in all cases (n = 12) following a mean dose of 6 +/- 2 micrograms/kg. Plasma concentrations of ibutilide were 53 +/- 13 ng/mL. Ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) was not significantly affected (4 +/- 2 msec). Following termination with ibutilide, atrial flutter could be reinitiated in 1 of 12 trials, and was nonsustained (40-sec duration). Sotalol significantly increased AFL CL 23 +/- 3 msec and terminated atrial flutter in 8 of 12 trials following a mean dose of 1.5 +/- 0.4 mg/kg. AERP and VERP were significantly increased 20 +/- 6 and 12 +/- 2 msec, respectively. The incidence of reinduced atrial flutter was 9 of 12 trials (P < or = 0.05 vs ibutilide) (7 nonsustained 57 +/- 7 sec duration, and 2 sustained). Sotalol failed to terminate atrial flutter in two dogs on days 1 and 5, despite increases in AFL CL (21 +/- 8 msec) and AERP (16 +/- 9 msec), whereas on day 3, ibutilide (20 +/- 7 micrograms/kg) terminated atrial flutter in those two dogs while increasing AFL CL and AERP 18 +/- 6 and 15 +/- 0 msec, respectively.",

The monophasic APD90 and RVERP were prolonged 12% to 17% (P < 0.001) during pharmacologic therapy, and frequency-dependent effects were only observed for the RVERP during sotalol. In both drug groups, isoproterenol significantly reduced the sinus cycle length and reduced the RVERP to a greater extent at longer than at shorter paced cycle lengths. While isoproterenol fully reversed quinidine's effects on the APD90 and RVERP, sotalol-induced APD90 prolongation was reduced by only 2% to 4%, and the RVERP was unaffected. Isoproterenol attenuated the frequency-dependent effects of quinidine on QRS duration by a relatively fixed amount of 7% to 10%.

(2) Isoproterenol fully reversed quinidine's effects on refractoriness, repolarization, and prolongation of VT cycle length, whereas d,l-sotalol's effects were largely preserved, despite significant reductions in sinus cycle length. (3) These results suggest that beta-blockade is important in preventing reversal of antiarrhythmic drug effects by augmented sympathetic nervous system tone.", 
    "108": "Sinus node recovery time assessment is used to diagnose clinically significant sinus node dysfunction (SND) when Holter has failed to prove a relationship between sinus bradyarrhythmias and symptoms, but consensus has not been reached as to the value of including assessment after pharmacologic blockade of the autonomic nervous system. This issue was addressed in the present study performed on 52 patients with syncope or presyncope/dizziness (n = 48), sinus bradyarrhythmias (n = 45), or both (n = 41). Group 1 consisted of 13 patients with a proven relationship between symptoms and sinus bradyarrhythmias. Group 2 consisted of 39 patients with suspected SND. The protocol included three pacing periods at two pacing rates and was performed at baseline (n = 52), after single doses of atropine and propranolol (0.02 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively) (n = 41), and again after a second dose (n = 29). The sensitivity of prolonged recovery times was 77% in group 1. Among group 2 patients, 56% had prolonged recovery times at baseline (79% when including the results after the first dose of drugs). The second dose did not contribute diagnostic information, but it caused significant adverse reactions in 7 of 29 patients (P < 0.001). These 7 patients were all older than 60 years. Assessment of sinus node recovery time after pharmacologic blockade of the autonomic nervous system thus increases the sensitivity of the method in patients with suspected SND and normal baseline results. However, only 50% of the initially suggested doses of atropine and propranolol is sufficient and eliminates the risk for significant adverse reactions.", 
    "109": "Administration of L-5-hydroxytryptophan (25 micrograms/kg, s.c.), the immediate precursor of serotonin, to rats induces drinking and increases tail skin temperature. Decreases in both the metabolic rate (rate of oxygen consumption) and colonic temperature also occur. These responses are similar to those observed following acute administration of angiotensin II. However, both drinking and the increase in tail skin temperature are unaffected by prior administration of the non-peptide angiotensin II, AT-1 receptor antagonist, losartan potassium, but are partially attenuated by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol. This suggests that the responses are independent of the angiotensin AT-1 receptor but may be mediated, in part at least, by the beta-adrenoceptor. The hypothesis is presented that when either L-5-hydroxytryptophan or angiotensin II is administered to rats, they act centrally to reduce the set-point for body temperature regulation, thus resulting in the reflex activation of mechanisms that reduce body temperature, including an increase in tail skin temperature and a decrease in metabolic rate.", 
    "110": "Are the anti-sexual effects of propranolol and pindolol due to actions within the brain? To answer this, these agents were administered directly into the brain ventricular system (ICV). Additionally, atenolol and metoprolol were evaluated to see whether differential delivery to the brain contributed to the observed lack of effect of systemically administered beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists. ICV administration of pindolol (45 or 90 micrograms) was followed by a suppression of copulation. At 45 micrograms, inhibition was limited to performance aspects of copulation, whereas at 90 micrograms, decrements in motivational and performance aspects of copulation were evident. ICV administration of propranolol also suppressed copulatory behavior. At 45 micrograms, no significant effects were observed, whereas at 90 micrograms decrements in motivational and performance aspects of copulation were evident. In contrast, ICV administration of the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, atenolol and metoprolol, was not associated with any major modifications in copulatory behavior. We suggest that the inhibitory effects of propranolol and pindolol may involve interactions with 5-HT1A receptors in the CNS. Alternatively, it may be that the adverse effects of pindolol and propranolol are due to the simultaneous blockade of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "111": "1. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the acute antihypoxidotic properties of the calcium-channel blocking and antiglutamatergic caroverine were investigated utilizing blood gas analysis, EEG mapping and psychometry under a transient, reversible, hypoxic hypoxidosis. 2. The latter was induced by a fixed gas combination of 9.8% oxygen (O2) and 90.2% nitrogen (N2) (found in 6000 m altitude), which was inhaled for 23 min under normobaric conditions by 16 healthy, young volunteers. They received randomized after an adaptation session, single oral doses of placebo, 40, 80 and 120 mg caroverine. Evaluation of blood gases, EEG mapping and psychometry were carried out 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h post-drug, during hypoxia. 3. Blood gas analysis demonstrated a drop in PO2 from 95 to 33 and 30 mmHg, in PCO2 from 38 to 30 and 30 mmHg in the 14th and 23rd minute of inhalation, respectively, while pH increased from 7.41 to 7.50 and 7.51. Base excess and standard bicarbonate remained stable. 4. EEG mapping under hypoxia exhibited a marked increase of delta/theta, decrease of alpha and an increase of superimposed beta activity, which reflects deterioration of vigilance. 5. Caroverine attenuated this hypoxia-induced vigilance decrement in a dose- and time-dependent manner 6-8 h after 80 mg and 2-8 h after 120 mg. 6. Hypoxic hypoxidosis induced a deterioration of memory and attention variability, which was mitigated by 80 and 120 mg caroverine. However, there was an augmentation of the hypoxia-induced decrement in psychomotor performance after 120 mg. 7. The drug was well tolerated, and there were no significant differences compared with placebo with regard to pulse and blood pressure.",

    "113": "Collateral coronary circulation was induced in 15 three-week-old piglets by banding of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). After 8-10 wk, the distal LAD was ligated and the open-chest pigs were randomized to receive infusions of either saline, nifedipine (5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) or metoprolol (10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) for 30 min during isoflurane anaesthesia (2%). Transient ischaemia was induced by 30 sec occlusion of the left circumflex artery. Arterial blood pressures, heart rate and regional myocardial blood flow (radiolabelled microspheres technique) were measured at the end of drug infusion (baseline) and one minute after transient ischaemia.",

Following transient ischaemia, in the nifedipine but not in the metoprolol group, blood flow to the CD myocardium was reduced by 28 +/- 24% in the epicardium (P < 0.05) and 56 +/- 20% in the endocardium (P < 0.01), resulting from intercoronary and transmural steal. This was associated with a moderate increase (10%, P < 0.05) in the heart rate in the nifedipine group.",

    "116": "1. We have assessed the relative abilities of compounds belonging to the new aryloxypropanolaminotetralin (APAT) class and of the reference beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent, alprenolol, to antagonize functional responses in vitro and in vivo involving atypical (beta 3) or conventional (beta 1 and beta 2) beta-adrenoceptors. 2. The range of pA2 values for three representative APATs against inhibition of spontaneous motility in the rat isolated colon by the selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, SR 58611A (8.1-8.8), was well above similarly calculated values for non-competitive antagonism of guinea-pig trachea relaxation by salbutamol (beta 2, 6.5-6.9) and the atrial chronotropic response by isoprenaline (beta 1, 6.7-7.3). Alprenolol, however, was substantially more potent in antagonizing atrial (pA2, 8.2) and tracheal (pA2, 8.9) responses than SR 58611A mediated inhibition of colonic motility (pA2, 6.8). 3. Several APAT isomers with different configurations at the chiral carbons, when tested on isolated organs, presented stringent stereochemical requirements for beta 3-selectivity, including high antagonist potency-ratios between active and inactive enantiomers. 4. In vivo, the inhibition of colonic motility and the thermogenic response of brown adipose tissue elicited in rats by the selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists SR 58611A and BRL 37344 respectively were substantially diminished by the representative APAT, SR 59230A, at oral doses (< or = 5 mg kg-1) well below those half maximally effective (ID50) for preventing beta 1-(isoprenaline tachycardia > or = 80 mg kg-1) or beta 2-(salbutamol bronchodilatation, 44 mg kg-1) mediated responses. Alprenolol, as expected, was a less potent and nonselective antagonist of the putative beta 3-responses. 5. These findings support APATs as the first potent, orally effective selective antagonists at beta 3-adrenoceptors, and provide final unambiguous evidence that beta 3-adrenoceptors underlie inhibition of colonic motility and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in rats.", 
    "117": "When human divers and experimental animals are exposed to increasing environmental pressure, they develop the high-pressure neurologic syndrome (HPNS) that has been recently demonstrated to include an increase in striatal dopamine (DA) release. This increase has been correlated with enhanced locomotor and motor activity (LMA). In the present study, we investigated the effect of the 5-HT1b receptor antagonist (+/-)cyanopindolol, which has been shown to block at normal pressure the increase in striatal DA release induced by the administration of the 5-HT1b receptor agonist CGS 12066B. Our data clearly showed that the administration of (+/-)cyanopindolol partially blocked both the pressure-induced increase in striatal DA release and the development of LMA. These results suggest the contribution of the 5-HT neurotransmission in the DA-related neurochemical and behavioral disorders that occur in rats exposed to high pressure.", 
    "118": "The effects of stressor application on the splenic plaque-forming cell (PFC) response was assessed in two strains of mice: the BALB/cByJ strain, which is highly responsive to stressors; and the more hardy DBA/2J strain. Both strains exhibited a peak PFC response 120 h following administration of sheep red blood cells (SRBC; 5 x 106 cells). Stressor exposure reduced the immune response; however, the appearance of such an outcome was dependent upon the time at which the stressor was applied relative to SRBC inoculation. In DBA/2J mice, foot-shock applied either immediately after SRBC inoculation or at the time of the peak immune response (120 h) resulted in suppression of the PFC response. In BALB/cByJ mice, both stressor severities provoked an immunosuppression when applied 120 h after inoculation, but when applied 96 h after immunization only foot-shock reduced the PFC response. At other intervals, the stressors were without effect. Pretreatment with the beta-norepinephrine antagonist propranolol precluded the immunosuppression elicited by a stressor applied 96 h after inoculation, but did not affect the reduction of the PFC response elicited by a stressor applied 120 h after inoculation. It is suggested that several factors may contribute to stressor-provoked alterations of the immune response, and that the contribution of these factors vary over the course of an immune response being mounted.", 
    "119": "Clinical and experimental studies indicate that nonimmunologic factors may modulate the alloreactivity of a renal transplant. Nitric oxide (NO) is an essential modulator of endothelial function. It was postulated that, in renal allografts, inhibition of constitutive NO synthase may lead to an aggravation of immunologic damage to endothelia and therefore may enhance dysfunction of the graft. Male Lewis (RT1l) rats received syngeneic or allogeneic Brown Norway (RT1n) renal grafts and were treated with cyclosporin A (CyA) or with CyA and an NO synthase blocker (NOS-B): N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) or NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). CyA was given at a dose of 3.5 mg/kg body weight for 14 days and the NOS-B at a dose of 66 mg/L drinking water for up to 28 days postoperatively. Animals (N = 6/group) were studied at 4 to 7, 14, and 28 days posttransplantation. Four to 5 days posttransplantation, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate of allogeneic grafts did not differ between animals treated only with CyA and those treated with CyA and NOS-B. Mean arterial pressure was significantly elevated by NOS-B (CyA+L-NNA: 115 +/- 13 versus CyA: 78 +/- 16 mm Hg). Combined NOS-B and CyA administration led to a pronounced increase in vascular and tubulointerstitial damage. The number of mononuclear cells in vessels, glomeruli, and tubulointerstitium increased significantly in allografts upon treatment with NOS-B. During NOS-B administration, adhesion molecules (intracellular adhesion molecule-1; leukocyte-function-associated molecules-1 alpha and-beta) were strongly expressed in endothelial and leukocytic cells of the allograft. A pronounced positivity for mRNA and protein of cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and transforming growth factor-beta could be demonstrated in the inflammatory infiltrate. With L-NNA treatment, the total vascular injury index was 10-fold higher (14 days posttransplantation, CyA+L-NNA: 59.8 +/- 11.7 versus CyA: 6.0 +/- 1.8; p < 0.05). The tubulointerstitial damage score rose more than 2.5-fold after CyA and L-NNA therapy (28 days posttransplantation: CyA+L-NNA: 83 +/- 1 versus CyA:29 +/- 1). L-NNA was more potent than L-NMMA at the dosages used. Thus, pronounced vascular leukostasis, vasculitis, and T-cell and monocyte infiltration of the tubulointerstitium led to a severe damage of the allograft under therapy with CyA and NOS-B. Inhibition of NO synthesis may aggravate alloreactive immunemediated injury in kidney transplants acting primarily by a disturbance of endothelial function.", 
    "120": "Previously, it has been shown that an increase in adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels stimulates intestinal secretion of cholecystokinin (CCK); however, the mechanisms for increasing intracellular cAMP levels are not known. Using the CCK-secreting intestinal cell line, STC-1, we evaluated whether beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) might be present on STC-1 cells and whether they stimulated CCK release through increases in cAMP. Photoaffinity labeling of beta-ARs from solubilized STC-1 cell membranes revealed photoincorporation of the agonist [125I]iodocyanopindolol into an approximately 75-kDa band. Addition of the beta-AR agonist, isoproterenol, in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, produced a concentration-dependent increase in both cAMP levels and CCK release. Blockade of beta 1- and/or beta 2-ARs significantly inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated increases in cAMP production and CCK release. With the use of fura 2-loaded cells to measure changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), isoproterenol stimulation was found to increase cytosolic Ca2+ levels. To evaluate whether this increase in [Ca2+]i was due to release of Ca2+ or influx of Ca2+, cells were treated with the L-type calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, which inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated CCK secretion. Furthermore, in patch-clamp studies with inside-out membrane patches, addition of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A activated diltiazem-sensitive Ca2+ channels. It is concluded that beta-ARs are present on STC-1 cells and are coupled to the production of cAMP, which may increase CCK release through a calcium-dependent process.",

    "125": "We evaluated the neuropsychological status of 13 adults patients with Marfan syndrome. All subjects were administered the same neuropsychological test battery that included nine measures covering a broad range of cognitive abilities such as attention and concentration, learning and memory, and verbal and non-verbal abilities. Compared to a control group of 13 healthy subjects matched for sex, age and verbal intelligence, Marfan patients only performed significantly worse on tests measuring sustained visual attention and visuoconstruction. Although these tests use visual material and depend on visual perception and processing, the visual acuity problems associated with the syndrome could not explain these differences, nor could the use of beta-blocking medication or the presence of joint hypermobility. The findings suggest that problems with sustained visual attention and visuoconstruction may be present in Marfan syndrome over and above visual acuity problems and other phenomena associated with the disease. Further research on the neuropsychological aspects of Marfan syndrome is needed, using larger patient groups and more adequate control groups such as non-affected siblings and matched controls with similar visual impairment.", 
    "126": "1. The cardiac chronotropic effects of rilmenidine (10-100 micrograms kg-1) and clonidine (1-10 micrograms kg-1) were studied in conscious dogs with chronic atrioventricular block. 2. Rilmenidine and clonidine initially (< 3 min) decreased atrial rate, although the effect was not related to dose. More lastingly, ventricular rate was decreased in a dose-related manner (ratio, 1:21). Rilmenidine lowered mean blood pressure only at 100 micrograms kg-1, while clonidine had the same effect at doses of 5 micrograms kg-1 upward (ratio, 1:15). 3. When administered after atropine and pindolol, rilmenidine (50 micrograms kg-1) produced a decrease in atrial rate, with an identical intensity but longer duration than under basal conditions. When clonidine (2.5 micrograms kg-1) was given after atropine, no chronotropic atrial effect was observed. However, when clonidine (2.5 micrograms kg-1) was given after pindolol, it produced a decrease in atrial rate that was more marked, both in intensity and duration, than under basal conditions. After phenoxybenzamine, rilmenidine decreased atrial rate with a more marked and lasting effect than observed under basal conditions. Clonidine produced a bradycardic atrial effect identical to the basal effect. After yohimbine, rilmenidine and clonidine decreased atrial rate with an intensity similar to that under basal conditions, although the time course was totally different. 4. When given after atropine, rilmenidine (50 micrograms kg-1) and clonidine (2.5 micrograms kg-1) decreased ventricular rate as under basal conditions, whereas after pindolol and phenoxybenzamine, both drugs decreased ventricular rate less markedly than under basal conditions, both in intensity and duration. After yohimbine, rilmenidine and clonidine produced no chronotropic ventricular effect. 5. These results show that (a) the initial atrial bradycardia caused by rilmenidine results from both a decrease in sympathetic tone and an increase in cholinergic activity; while the effect of clonidine is caused mainly by the enhancement of cholinergic activity. For both drugs, alpha 2-adrenoceptors are involved at least in the initiation of the effect; (b) the very short duration of atrial bradycardia may result from reflex buffering in response to ventricular bradycardia. This buffering is less effective when heart rate was high; and (c) the ventricular bradycardia caused by both drugs is mainly the result of a decrease in sympathetic tone in response to the stimulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The results also suggest that negative chronotropic postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors could be involved in the ventricular bradycardia.", 
    "127": "The present work examined, using in vivo microdialysis, the effects of 0.16-10 mg/kg of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, (-)-pindolol and (+/-)-tertatolol, which have additional 5-HT1A receptor antagonist properties, on extracellular 5-HT levels in the ventral hippocampus of chloral hydrate-anaesthetized rats. These effects were compared with those observed when (-)-pindolol and (+/-)-tertatolol were given together with the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.31 mg/kg i.p.). When given alone, (-)-pindolol and (+/-)-tertatolol increased 5-HT levels not only after systemic administration (at 2.5 and 10 mg/kg s.c.), but also when perfused locally through the dialysis probe (at a concentration of 10 microM). At doses equal to or lower than those that increased 5-HT when given alone, (-)-pindolol and (+/-)-tertatolol inhibited the decrease of extracellular 5-HT levels induced by 8-OH-DPAT. At higher doses, however, (-)-pindolol and (+/-)-tertatolol were less able to reverse these effects of 8-OD-DPAT. The selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, (+/-)-betaxolol, did not alter 5-HT levels, either when given alone or when given together with 8-OD-DPAT. Although the antagonism of the 8-OH-DPAT-induced decrease of 5-HT levels by (-)-pindolol and (+/-)-tertatolol is likely to be related to their 5-HT1A antagonist properties, their ability to increase extracellular 5-HT levels when given alone may involve interactions with 5-HT1B receptors at hippocampal 5-HT terminals.", 
    "128": "The long QT syndromes can be divided into congenital and acquired forms. Early afterdepolarizations have been identified as triggering mechanisms for both congenital and acquired QT syndromes but reentry may play a role in the perpetuation of the ventricular tachycardia, torsade de pointes. Studies of the ionic mechanisms of early afterdepolarizations have implicated L-type Ca2+ current, persisting Na+ current, and Na+:Ca2+ exchange current related to Ca2+ loading. Different ionic mechanisms may be operative in early afterdepolarizations occuring at different levels of membrane potential in the setting of prolonged repolarization by blocking K+ currents or maintaining non-inactivating Ca2+ or Na+ currents or in early afterdepolarizations due to adrenergic stimulation. In the congenital long QT syndromes, two mutations have recently been discovered in the genes SCN5A and HERG which encode respectively the Na+ channel and a K+ channel conducting the current IKr. It is postulated that the SCN5A mutation leads to a problem with inactivation of Na+ current. In the case of the HERG mutation, the K+ current appears to be diminished. In the case of the acquired long QT syndromes, the therapeutic challenge is to maintain the prolonged repolarization but to interrupt the arrhythmogenic cascade. Current therapies for torsades de pointes include speeding of the heart rate, which enhances K+ current, and Ca2+ blockers or Mg, also a Ca2+ blocker. In the congenital long QT syndromes, therapy in the past has been directed toward reducting adrenergic influence either by betablockade or left cardiac sympathectomy. Recent discoveries open other possibilities such as Na+ channel blockers and methods to increase IKr such as elevation of extracellular K+.", 
    "129": "Currently available antiarrhythmic drugs were developed at a time when the basic mechanisms underlying most arrhythmias were conjectural at best. Indeed, the molecular targets upon which drugs act to prevent (or to exacerbate) arrhythmias are only now being defined. Thus, recent advances in the treatment of patients with arrhythmias have emphasized non-pharmacologic approaches, which use new information on the pathophysiology of specific arrhythmias to deliver targeted therapies. For some arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, it seems likely that drug therapy will remain an important part of treatment. With increasing cellular and molecular understanding of the determinants of normal and abnormal cardiac electrogenesis, it should be possible to develop effective and safer drugs for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.", 
    "130": "The effect of Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV) on the gastric emptying of liquids was studied in 240 young adult Wistar rats (2-3 months of age) divided into subgroups of 8 animals each. The study was performed in 3 stages. Initially, PNV was injected into rats at doses of 0.19, 0.38 or 0.76 mg/kg and the effect on gastric emptying was assessed 30 min later. In the second stage, a time-course study was performed by injecting 0.76 mg PNV/kg and measuring the effect on gastric emptying 15, 60 and 120 min post-venom. In the last stage, in order to investigate the possible mechanisms of PNV influence on gastric emptying, one group of rats underwent subdiaphragmatic vagotomy and then received 0.76 mg PNV/kg while three other groups were pretreated iv with either prazosin (0.4 mg/kg), domperidone (1.0 mg/kg) or propranolol (0.6 mg/kg) and then given 0.38 or 0.76 mg PNV/kg. In this last stage, gastric retention was measured 30 min post-venom. Each animal received a saline test meal solution containing phenol red as a marker (60 micrograms/ml). Ten min after administering the test meal by gavage, gastric retention was determined by measuring the residual test meal marker concentration and the animals were sacrified. PNV (0.76 mg/kg) provoked a significant delay in gastric emptying of liquids 15, 30 and 60 min after its administration. Propranolol partially interfered with gastric emptying in rats that had received 0.38 and 0.76 mg PNV/kg. Vagotomy and pretreatment of the rats with prazosin and domperidone had no effect. We conclude that the delay in the liquid gastric emptying observed in severely envenomed rats was probably due, at least in part, to a venom-stimulated release of catecholamines which inhibited gastric motility by activating smooth muscle beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "131": "An isocratic high performance liquid chromatographic method is described for the determination of the beta-adrenergic blocking drug, propranolol, and the diuretic, furosemide, in human plasma. The two compounds and the internal standard were extracted from plasma using a two-step extraction technique. Propranolol and pindolol (internal standard) were first extracted from alkaline plasma into diethyl ether; this was followed by extraction of furosemide into acidified ether: hexane (65:35). The two extracts were then combined and evaporated under nitrogen, and the reconstituted residues were analysed on a C18/SCX reversed-phase/cation exchange column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile: 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4 (33:67). The drugs and the internal standard were detected by UV absorption at 230 nm. The drugs were also extracted from plasma by a column-switching technique utilizing a ten-port valve. The drug compounds were retained on a C18 pre-column. A comparison of RSD for within-batch (intra-assay) and between-batch (inter-assay) runs for both methods was carried out, the liquid/liquid extraction method giving better recovery values. The calibration graphs were linear from 25-300 ng ml-1 for furosemide and 50-400 ng ml-1 for propranolol. Recovery values were > 90.0% by liquid/liquid extraction and > 76.0% by column switching.", 
    "132": "The extraction properties of Hisep, a novel bonded phase for solid phase extraction, have been investigated using a number of acidic and basic analytes and compared with those of a conventional ODS bonded material. Marked differences in extraction properties for the test analytes propranolol, anisic acid and ICI 128436 from aqueous buffer were noted between the two materials. Thus, extraction onto the ODS material was by both ionic and reversed-phase mechanisms whilst retention on the Hisep phase appeared to be mediated predominantly by reversed-phase hydrophobic interactions. The presence of dog plasma had no effect on the extraction of propranolol but did reduce the extraction efficiencies observed for anisic acid and ICI 128436 in a pH dependent manner.", 
    "133": "Three analytical methods have been developed and validated for the quantification of beta-blockers (celiprolol, bisoprolol and oxprenolol) using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection. The methods were determined to be linear, precise and accurate (RSDs were lower than 5%), which allowed the quantitation of beta-blockers assayed at concentrations in the range 25-0.78 micrograms ml-1. After validation of reversed-phase HPLC methods, their analytical error functions were established by a rapid, simple and economical procedure. The discrimination of the best function for each active principle was performed by an appropriate polynomial statistical analysis, yielding SD (microgram ml-1) = 0.0295 + 0.0124C - 3.88 x 10(-4)C2 for celiprolol, 0.0199 + 0.011C - 1.27 x 10(-5)C3 for bisoprolol; and 0.0183 + 0.0089C - 9.68 x 10(-6)C3 for oxprenolol.

    "134": "A comparative study has been performed in isolated organs and in anesthetized animals, rabbits, and guinea pigs, to evaluated the myotropic responses (in the organs) and the blood pressure changes (in the animals) induced by bradykinin (BK) and related peptides. Antagonist affinities have also been estimated in vitro in terms of PA2 and in vivo in terms of ID50, to characterize the kinin B2 receptors in the two species. Differences have been found both in the order of potency of agonists and in the affinity of antagonists: in fact, in the rabbit, [Hyp3]BK > [Aib7]BK, is the opposite order of what is found in the guinea pig, namely, [Aib7]BK < [Hyp3]BK, both in vitro and in vivo. Results obtained with antagonists also show important differences between the two species, since DArg[Hyp3, DPhe7, Leu8]BK is more active in the rabbit than in the guinea pig, while WIN-64338 is fairly active in the guinea pig and almost inactive in the rabbit. HOE-140, the long-acting antagonist of the B2 receptor, shows similar affinities in vitro in the two species. In another series of experiments, peptide degradation by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) has been investigated to see whether the differences of potency observed between certain peptides interacting with the B2 receptor were due to metabolic degradation. When incubated in the presence of pure ACE from rabbit lung, BK,[Hyp3]BK, and des Arg9BK are readily degraded, while [Aib7]BK, HOE-140, and DArg[Hyp3, DPhe7, Leu8]BK are not. When applied intravenously (i.v.), to obtain degradation by the lung, and intraarterially (i.a.), to avoid such degradation, the effect of BK (i.v.) is markedly reduced (compared with the effect i.a.), while no difference is observed for [Aib7]BK. Thus, despite its resistance to degradation by ACE, [Aib7]BK shows very little activity in the rabbit, suggesting that the major cause in the variation of affinities observed between kinin analogs is related to their pharmacodynamic properties. Taken together, the results speak strongly in favor of the existence of B2 receptor subtypes in the peripheral circulation of the rabbit and the guinea pig. Results obtained in vivo, both in pharmacological and biochemical experiments, are in accord with the findings obtained in isolated organs and with purified ACE enzyme.", 
    "135": "In isolated canine right ventricular muscles, we investigated the differences in antagonisms by beta-blockers against the positive inotropic effects (PIEs) of isoproterenol, a nonselective agonist, and T-0509, a beta1-selective agonist. The selective beta1-blockers atenolol and bisoprolol antagonized the PIE of T-0509 monophasically in Schild analysis, showing pA2 values of 7.05 and 7.63, respectively. On the other hand, both blockers produced biphasic antagonism against the PIE of isoproterenol (ISO); therefore, two pKB values were obtained (7.75 and 4.25 and 7.82 and 5.76, respectively). Nadolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, also antagonized the PIE of T-0509 monophasically (pA2 value 7.58), but antagonized the PIE of ISO biphasically (pKB values 7.42 and 4.39). Because the different mode of antagonism by three beta-blockers between T-0509 and ISO could not be explained by the selectivities of beta-agonists and blockers for beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors in the heart, two subtypes of beta1-adrenoceptors may exist together in canine ventricular muscles, and atenolol, bisoprolol, and nadolol may act as antagonists for the two subtypes with two different affinities.", 
    "136": "6.7-Dimethoxy-3-cyano-3.4-dihydrocarbostyril (7A61, 1), a 2-quinolinone derivative, showed interesting cardiotonic properties in vitro. It exerted potent positive inotropic effects, without any change in heart rate, in guinea pig atrial preparations, and its effects were not dependent upon inhibition of phosphodiesterases, opening of Na+ channels, or inhibition of adenosine receptors. Notwithstanding its structural relationships with milrinone, vesnarinone, and other quinolinones endowed with cardiotonic activity, it appeared that 7A61 does not share any of the main mechanisms of action involved in the pharmacological activity of these compounds. Other experiments also excluded the involvement of other well known mechanisms of cardiac stimulation, such as adrenergic receptor activation or opening of Ca++ channels, the mode of action of 7A61 remaining unexplained. However, contrary to milrinone, 7A61 did not exert cardiotonic effects in human ventricular muscle preparations, thus discouraging further investigation. Although the lack of effect on human heart could not be predicted from the results obtained in several cardiac preparations commonly used in laboratory investigations, the scarce efficacy of 7A61 in comparison with milrinone in dog and cat papillary muscle and in guinea pig ventricular muscle suggests the utility of the latter preparations in laboratory experiments aimed at selecting new potential cardiotonic agents."
