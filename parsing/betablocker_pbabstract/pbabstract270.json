The peak of PPL was only observed in samples taken a few hours after ingestion of the drug due to its extensive conjugation and metabolisation. The detection of several unconjugated PPL metabolites was therefore considered: desisopropylpropranolol (DIP), propranolol glycol (PPG), alpha-naphthoxylactic acid (NLT) and alpha-naphthoxyacetic acid (NAC). NLT showed the best characteristics: it eluted at a much shorter retention time than PPL, its concentration in urine samples was greater and it did not present any interference from endogeneous compounds in urine, common drugs or drugs administered in combination with PPL. The limit of quantification, measured as the concentration of analyte providing a relative standard deviation of 20%, was 24 ng/ml, and the day-to-day imprecision was below 4% for concentrations above 200 ng/ml. The procedure allows the routine control of PPL at therapeutic urine levels. Urinary excretion studies showed that the detection of NLT is possible at least up to 20-30 h after oral administration.", 
    "8": "(+/-)-Terbutaline and (+/-)-fenoterol are both arylethanolamine analogs that have tertbutyl and aryliso-propyl substituents respectively at the a position on the nitrogen of the ethanolamine side chain. In the present study, we have investigated the structure-activity relationships of (+/-)-terbutaline and (+/-)-fenoterol as beta3-adrenoceptor agonists in the guinea pig gastric fundus. (+/-)-Terbutaline and (+/-)-fenoterol induced concentration-dependent relaxation of the precontracted gastric fundus with pD2 values of 4.45+/-0.10 and 5.90+/-0.09, and intrinsic activities of 1.00+/-0.03 and 0.99+/-0.01 respectively. The combination of the selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist (+/-)-atenolol (100 microM), and the selective beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist (+/-)-butoxamine (100 microM), produced a 2 and 6 fold rightward shift of the concentration-response curves for (+/-)-terbutaline and (+/-)-fenoterol respectively, without depressing the maximal responses. The order of potency of these agonists was (pD2 value): (+/-)-fenoterol (5.09+/-0.10) > (+/-)-terbutaline (4.13+/-0.08). In the presence of (+/-)-atenolol and (+/-)-butoxamine, however, the non-selective beta1, beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptor antagonist (+/-)-bupranolol caused a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the concentration-response curves for (+/-)-terbutaline and (+/-)-fenoterol. Schild plot analyses of the effects of (+/-)-bupranolol against these agonists gave pA2 values of 6.21+/-0.07 ((+/-)-terbutaline) and 6.37+/-0.06 ((+/-)-fenoterol) respectively, and the slopes of the Schild plot were not significantly different from unity (p>0.05). These results suggest that the relaxant responses to (+/-)-terbutaline and (+/-)-fenoterol are mainly mediated through beta3-adrenoceptors in the guinea pig gastric fundus. The beta3-adrenoceptor agonist potencies of arylethanolamine analogs depend on the size of the end of the alkylamine side chain.",

    "11": "Among the 1067 participants to a population-based survey for cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension was discovered in 50 (previously unaware of having hypertension and having blood pressure > or = 160/95 mmHg over 3 visits). These 50 patients were placed on a daily one-pill regimen of medication (bendrofluazide, atenolol, or a combination of hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol) and compliance to the regimen was assessed over 12 months using electronic pill containers. Satisfactory compliance was defined as taking the medication on 6 or 7 days a week on average (which corresponds to a mean compliance level of > or = 86%).", 
    "12": "In the first month, fewer than half (46%) of the new hypertension patients achieved satisfactory compliance, and only about one-quarter (26%) achieved this level by the twelfth month. Compliance was better among the 23 participants who regularly attended medical follow-up, with nearly three-quarters of these patients (74%) achieving satisfactory compliance during the first month and over one-half (55%) by the twelfth month. There was a direct association between mean 12-month compliance level and having a highly skilled occupation; having good health awareness; and regularly attending medical appointments. In contrast, there was an inverse relationship between mean compliance level and heavy drinking.",

Cardiac and extracardiac distribution was assessed, and metabolite formation was determined by thin-layer chromatography. The in vivo experiments were repeated with no-carrier-added (123)I-MIBG. By means of autoradiography, the beta-receptor affinity of 4-FM was compared with that of MIBG and propranolol (10 micromol/L) through displacement of (125)I-iodocyanopindolol (1.5 pmol/L) in slices of heart and spleen.", 
    "16": "Cardiomyopathic hearts showed heterogeneous 4-(18)F-FM uptake with gradients up to 3.6 in vivo and in vitro between different regions of the heart. Control hearts showed such gradients in 4-(18)F-FM uptake only in vitro. (123)I-MIBG exhibited a less heterogeneous in vivo distribution in SHR hearts. Extracardiac differences between WKY and SHR were found for uptake of 4-(18)F-FM in the spleen (63.3% plus minus 4% vs. 38.8% plus minus 5.7% of cardiac activity) and for renal uptake of (123)I-MIBG (373% plus minus 27% vs. 81.4% plus minus 17% of cardiac activity). Metabolites of 4-(18)F-FM were found only in the liver and those of (123)I-MIBG were found in the liver and kidney with a nearly equal relative fraction in both types of animals of about 20%, 60%, and 30%, respectively. 4-FM suppressed cardiac-specific beta-receptor binding of (125)I-iodocyanopindolol in heart and spleen of both types of animals significantly, whereas MIBG had almost no effect.", 
    "17": "The more heterogeneous cardiac distribution of 4-(18)F-FM suggests that it reflects alterations in uptake-1 better than (123)I-MIBG in addition to the possibility of quantification and higher spatial resolution by PET compared with SPECT. Altered biotransformation in cardiomyopathic diseases may also impair the evaluation of (123)I-MIBG-SPECT data. The beta-receptor binding of 4-(18)F-FM must be further elucidated.", 
    "18": "Contractile failure of myocardial cells is a common cause of mortality in ischemic heart disease. In response to hypoxic conditions, cells upregulate the activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and express a number of genes encoding proteins that either enhance O (2)delivery or increase cellular ATP levels. HIF-1 is a heterodimer of bHLH-PAS proteins, HIF-1 alpha and HIF-1 beta. Both subunits are constitutively expressed under normoxic conditions, but HIF-1 alpha levels are kept low by proteolytic degradation, then stabilized under conditions of low O (2)by a mechanism that is poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that expression of HIF-1 alpha in cardiac cells may be affected by two known cardioprotective agents. We tested l-carnosine, a naturally occurring dipeptide which has been shown to improve myocardial contractility during hypoxia, and verapamil, a calcium channel blocker frequently prescribed for the treatment of heart disease. The levels of HIF-1 alphamRNA remained relatively stable during time course hypoxia (1% O (2)) in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, then increased slightly after 24 h. In cells pretreated with 1 microM carnosine, the levels of mRNA were transiently reduced, but then increased after 24 h similar to the controls. The levels of HIF-1 alpha protein increased rapidly in H9c2 cells within 30 min of hypoxia, but this induction was significantly reduced in cells treated with either carnosine or verapamil. In addition, treatment of cells with these agents further reduced the low levels of HIF-1 under normoxic conditions. These results suggest that l-carnosine and verapamil may affect the regulated proteolytic degradation of HIF-1 alpha in heart cells during hypoxia.",

Prescriptions were collected during May and June 2000 to comprise a study population of 1266 diabetic-hypertensive patients.", 
    "21": "As monotherapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (37.9%) and beta-blockers (38.3%) were the most commonly prescribed classes of antihypertensives by FPs and GPs, respectively. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were ranked third by both categories of physicians. For two-drug combinations, a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor was the combination of choice for both physician categories. Patients managed by the FPs were more likely to receive a beta-blocker-CCB combination (17.4 vs. 14.9%) or a diuretic-ACE inhibitor combination (16.7 vs. 11.4%) and less likely to receive a beta-blocker-diuretic combination (11.8 vs. 16.7%) than those managed by the GPs. The proportion of patients receiving antihypertensive combinations was 40.6 and 38.5% for FPs and GPs, respectively. While the GPs prescribed CCB as a monotherapy to the elderly most often, the FPs choice was a beta-blocker. Diuretics were less preferred by both FPs and GPs. Beta-blocker-ACE inhibitor was again the most preferred combination of both FPs and GPs. FPs prescribed CCB-beta-blocker combinations more often than GPs (P = 0.01), whereas CCB-ACE inhibitor combinations were less preferred (P = 0.09). A trend towards excessive use of short-acting nifedipine as monotherapy for elderly patients, both by FPs and by GPs, was noticed. Glibenclamide, alone or in combination with metformin, was the foremost antidiabetic drug prescribed by FPs and GPs. Middle-aged (45-64 years) patients seen by GPs were more likely to receive glibenclamide than those treated by FPs (P = 0.001) and less likely to receive gliclazide (P = 0.01). Combinations of a beta-blocker with either glibenclamide or insulin were prescribed considerably more often by GPs.", 
    "22": "Within the same practice setting, a substantial difference was observed between FPs and GPs in terms of preference for different classes of drugs in the management of diabetic hypertension. The compliance of both FPs and GPs was suboptimal; overall, the compliance of the FPs was closer to the recommended guidelines, however. Educational programmes should specifically address these inadequacies in order to improve the quality of health care.", 
    "23": "The present study examined and compared the spasmolytic effects of 3 harmala alkaloids, harmine, harman, and harmaline, on carbachol-, histamine-, and KCl-induced contractions of guinea-pig isolated tracheal preparations. All 3 compounds relaxed the tracheal preparations contracted by these spasmogens with similar or different EC50 values, harmine being the most potent one. The cumulative concentration-response curves of all 3 compounds for carbachol-induced contraction were shifted to the right by propranolol (1 microM) pretreatment, indicating the involvement of the activation on the beta-adrenoceptors. All 3 compounds shifted the concentration-response curves of carbachol to the right in a parallel manner with the pA2 values comparable with their relaxation EC50 values, indicating a competitive antagonism at the muscarinic receptors. Receptor binding assays indicated that all 3 compounds interacted with lung muscarinic receptors (Ki = 11-13 microM), histamine H1 receptors (Ki = 27-107 microM), and beta2-adrenoceptors (Ki = 20-51 microM). Therefore, in addition to their actions on receptor-linked and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels as reported in other types of smooth muscle, the present study suggests that the actions on muscarinic receptors, histamine H1 receptors, and beta2-adrenoceptors are also involved in their spasmolytic effects on airway smooth muscles.", 
    "24": "This review focuses on the mechanisms and sites of action underlying beta-adrenergic antagonism in perioperative medicine. A large body of knowledge has recently emerged from basic and clinical research concerning the mechanisms of the life-saving effects of beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta-AAs) in high-risk cardiac patients. This article re-emphasizes the mechanisms underlying beta-adrenergic antagonism and also illuminates novel rationales behind the use of perioperative beta-AAs from a biological point of view. Particularly, it delineates new concepts of beta-adrenergic signal transduction emerging from transgenic animal models. The role of the different characteristics of various beta-AAs is discussed, and evidence will be presented for the selection of one specific agent over another on the basis of individual drug profiles in defined clinical situations. The salutary effects of beta-AAs on the cardiovascular system will be described at the cellular and molecular levels. Beta-AAs exhibit many effects beyond a reduction in heart rate, which are less known by perioperative physicians but equally desirable in the perioperative care of high-risk cardiac patients. These include effects on core components of an anaesthetic regimen, such as analgesia, hypnosis, and memory function. Despite overwhelming evidence of benefit, beta-AAs are currently under-utilized in the perioperative period because of concerns of potential adverse effects and toxicity. The effects of acute administration of beta-AAs on cardiac function in the compromised patient and strategies to counteract potential adverse effects will be discussed in detail. This may help to overcome barriers to the initiation of perioperative treatment with beta-AAs in a larger number of high-risk cardiac patients undergoing surgery.", 
    "25": "In men and women with moderately severe essential hypertension (EH), efficiency has been analyzed of different schemes of combined hypotensive drug therapy depending on the hemodynamic type of circulation with taking account of basic indices for the 24-hour profile of arterial pressure (AP). It is shown that the baseline indices for a long-term AP monitoring (1-3 days) determine the choice of individualized differentiated therapy consisting of a combination of two (atenolol and enalapril maleate) or three (atenolol, enalapril maleate, hydrochlorothiazide) hypotensive drug preparations. Individual schemes of the above drug therapy permitted not only the correction of identified disturbances in the 24-hour AP profile but also contributed to the improvement of hemodynamic maintenance of graded physical loads, favouring positive changes in the structural-and-functional status of the myocardium, which facts suggest indirectly an improvement of prognosis in EH patients.",

Similar treatment in SON-transected rats did not modify the P concentrations in ovarian vein blood between 1 and 25 min after injection. After 5 microg propranolol (beta-adrenergic antagonist) i.c.v. injection in SON-intact rats, the P levels in ovarian vein blood increased from 2 to 4 min (p<0.05).

Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between training characteristics and beta-blocker dispensation and clustering of patients within physicians was accounted for using Generalized Estimating Equations.",

After adjusting for patients' demographic characteristics, comorbid medical conditions, and markers of MI severity, physicians who were more likely to prescribe a beta-blocker included cardiologists and the most recent graduates (graduating after 1989). Systematic differences were also observed between graduates of different medical schools.",

We also show that AMPA-mediated neuron survival was abolished both by ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 and AMPA-Rs blocker CNQX, and that chemokine-mediated survival was blocked by the PI3-K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin. We conclude that the neurotrophic effects of AMPA need the contemporary activation of ERKs and stimulation of AMPA-Rs, and that PI3-K/Akt activation is a determinant pathway for the IL-8/GRObeta anti-apoptotic activity.", 
    "41": "Despite convincing results of studies in vitro, less is known about the effects of antioxidants on in vivo redox balance in humans. We developed a novel parameter of in vivo redox balance, and studied it and its relation to dental infections in 51 patients on medication for coronary heart disease (CHD) and 39 random controls matched for age group, sex, social class and locality. In vivo redox balance was the ratio of plasma antioxidant capacity, as measured with radical-trapping assay, to neutrophil respiratory burst capacity, as measured with whole blood chemiluminescence assay. Dental infections were quantitated with four rating scales. CHD patients had higher values than controls. Patients on acetosalicylic acid (ASA), diuretics or beta blockers, but not the ones on calcium channel blocker, had significantly higher redox balance than non-users. Combination of calcium channel blockers and ASA was associated with redox balance similar to taking beta blockers or diuretics. Diuretics and ASA were independent determinants of redox balance in multivariate analyses. Redox balance did not correlate with severity of dental infections (Spearman's r 0.06 to 0.11). The results contrast experimental data indicating that calcium channel blockers are as antioxidants superior to other cardiovascular drugs. Total antioxidant capacity in parallel with oxygen species production capacity should be considered in attempts to solve the antioxidant paradox.", 
    "42": "beta-Blockers have regained interest in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases after a period of decreasing importance due to the introduction of other cardiovascular treatment principles. beta-blockers expose the longest list of indications in cardiovascular therapy available and present positive mortality results for the treatment of arterial hypertension, the postinfarction situation and heart failure. There are three indications for the treatment of atrial fibrillation alone: slowing of AV-conductance, sinus rhythm restoration and atrial stabilization. Among the most recent developments there is the clear establishment of evidence for their life prolonging activity in heart failure treatment which has been proven for carvedilol, bisoprolol and metoprolol in NYHA (New York Heart Association) stages 2 and 3 and so far for carvedilol only in NYHA stage 4. Differences between beta-blocking agents are clinically most relevant for the presence of an intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) which should no longer be present in clinically used compounds. The ISA of bucindolol is the most likely reason for its failure in an outcome study for heart failure treatment. Other pharmacological distinctions relate to the selectivity in the beta-adrenergic system, activity in the alpha-adrenergic system and differences in metabolism and elimination.",

    "48": "Progression of renal failure, despite renoprotection with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with proteinuric nephropathies, may be caused by persistent renal production of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) through the angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptors. We tested the hypothesis that AT1-receptor blocker therapy added to a background of chronic maximal ACE inhibitor therapy will result in a reduction in urinary TGF-beta1 levels in such patients. Sixteen patients completed a two-period, crossover, randomized, controlled trial, details of which have been previously reported. All patients were administered lisinopril, 40 mg/d, with either losartan, 50 mg/d, or placebo. Blood pressure (BP) was measured using a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitor. Overnight specimens of urine were analyzed for urine TGF-beta1, protein, and creatinine concentrations. Mean age of the study population was 53 +/- 9 (SD) years; body mass index, 38 +/- 5.7 kg/m2; seated BP, 156 +/- 18/88 +/- 12 mm Hg; and urine protein excretion, 3.6 +/- 0.71 g/g of creatinine. Twelve patients had diabetic nephropathy, and the remainder had chronic glomerulonephritis. At baseline, urinary TGF-beta1 levels were significantly increased in the study population compared with healthy controls (13.2 +/- 1.2 versus 1.7 +/- 1.1 ng/g creatinine; P < 0.001). There was a strong correlation between baseline urine protein excretion and urinary TGF-beta1 level (r2 = 0.53; P = 0.001), as well as systolic BP and urinary TGF-beta1 level (r2 = 0.57; P < 0.001). After 4 weeks of add-on losartan therapy, there was a 38% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16% to 55%) decline in urinary TGF-beta1 levels (13.3 [95% CI, 11.4 to 15.5] to 8.2 pg/mg creatinine [95% CI, 6.2 to 10.7]). The reduction in urinary TGF-beta1 levels occurred independent of changes in mean urinary protein excretion or BP. Thus, proteinuric patients with renal failure, despite maximal ACE inhibition, had increased urinary levels of TGF-beta1 that improved over 1 month of add-on therapy with losartan. We speculate that dual blockade with losartan and an ACE inhibitor may provide additional renoprotection by decreasing renal production of TGF-beta1.", 
    "49": "It is well established that hypertensive patients with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy have impaired diastolic filling. However, the impact of antihypertensive treatment and LV mass reduction on LV diastolic filling remains unclear.", 
    "50": "Echocardiograms were recorded in 728 hypertensive patients with ECG-verified LV hypertrophy (Cornell voltage-duration or Sokolow-Lyon) at baseline and after 1 year of blinded treatment with either losartan or atenolol-based regimen. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) were reduced on average 23/11 mm Hg; isovolumic relaxation time and E/A ratio became more normal, and LV inflow deceleration time prolonged (all P<0.001). Directionally opposite changes in isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and deceleration time indicate improvement in active LV relaxation and passive chamber stiffness during early diastole. Prevalences of normal LV filling increased, abnormal relaxation and pseudonormalization decreased, and restrictive filling pattern remained unchanged (P<0.05). Patients with reduction in LV mass had smaller left atrial diameter, shortened IVRT, increased E/A ratio, and prolonged LV inflow deceleration time (all P<0.001). Patients without LV mass reduction had no change in diastolic filling parameters (P=NS). IVRT shortening was independently associated with reduction in LV mass. Increase in E/A ratio was independently associated with reduction in diastolic BP, and increase in the deceleration time was independently associated with reduced end-systolic relative wall thickness.",

The effects of intrathecal (i.t.) administration of N-, P/Q- or L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+)-channel blockers were tested in two pain models involving bradykinin (BK)- and alpha,beta-methylene ATP (alpha,beta meATP)-induced activation of primary afferent neurons in mice. 2. The nociceptive response (amount of time spent licking and biting the hindpaw) induced by intraplantar injection of BK (500 pmol mouse(-1)) was significantly attenuated by both omega-conotoxin GVIA (N-type blocker) and calciseptine (L-type) but not by omega-agatoxin IVA (P/Q-type). 3. The nociceptive response induced in a similar way by alpha,beta meATP (100 nmol) was significantly inhibited by both the above N- and P/Q-type Ca(2+)-channel blockers but not by the L-type blocker. 4. The nociceptive responses elicited by BK and alpha,beta meATP were dose-dependently inhibited by a tachykinin-NK1-receptor antagonist (L-703,606) and an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonist (D-AP5), respectively. 5. Intrathecal administration of substance P (SP) (1.8 nmol) or NMDA (350 pmol) elicited algesic responses, such as licking, biting and scratching of the hindquarters. The SP-induced algesic behaviour was significantly inhibited by the L-type blocker but not by the N-type. The NMDA-induced response was not affected by either the N- or the P/Q-type blocker. 6. These findings suggest that BK and ATP most likely excite different types of sensory neurons in the periphery and that within the spinal cord the former stimulates peptidergic transmission regulated by presynaptic N- and postsynaptic L-type Ca(2+) channels, while the latter stimulates glutamatergic transmission regulated by presynaptic N- and P/Q-type channels.", 
    "53": "1. The present study examines the role of migrating leukocytes in the ability of IL-1 beta to induce the functional up-regulation of B(1) receptors, as assessed by kinin B(1) agonist-induced oedema in the rat paw. 2. Pre-treatment with the PAF receptor antagonist WEB 2086 inhibited des-Arg(9)-BK-induced oedema in IL-1 beta-treated paws, while the LTB(4) receptor antagonist CP105696 had no effect. Des-Arg(9)-BK-induced paw oedema was also inhibited by pre-treatment with the selectin blocker fucoidin or by an anti-CD-18 monoclonal antibody. 3. I.d. injection of IL-1 beta produced a 5 - 10-fold increase of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the rat paw. The increase in MPO activity was significantly inhibited by WEB 2086 (46 +/- 9%), fucoidin (68 +/- 5%) or the CD-18 antibody (84 +/- 3%). In contrast, i.d. injection of TNF alpha a dose known to upregulate the B(1) receptor functionally did not induce any significant increase in MPO activity. 4. Des-Arg(9)-BK alone had no effect in MPO activity but enhanced (by about 40%) the response induced by IL-1 beta, an effect prevented by the B(1) receptor antagonist des-Arg(9)-[Leu(8)]-BK. 5. The concentration of TNF-alpha was increased in the paws after i.d. injection of IL-1 beta. Pre-treatment with fucoidin, WEB 2086, anti-CD-18 or CP 105695, significantly reversed the local increases in TNF-alpha concentrations (80 +/- 2; 75 +/- 4, 73 +/- 3 and 40 +/- 2%), respectively. 6. Finally, IL-1 beta induced an increase of B(1) receptor mRNA levels in the rat paw, an effect which was prevented by fucoidin treatment. 7. Taken together, these results indicate that up-regulation of B(1) receptors in the rat paw following IL-1 beta seems to involve the local recruitment of neutrophils and subsequent local TNF-alpha production. The cross-talk between kinins, cytokines and leukocytes implicate B(1) receptors in chronic inflammatory diseases.",

    "58": "Infusion of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist into the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) blocks memory enhancement induced by systemic or intra-BLA administration of a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist. As there is evidence that glucocorticoids interact with the noradrenergic signalling pathway in activating adenosine 3prime prime or minute,5prime prime or minute-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), the present experiments examined whether glucocorticoids influence the beta-adrenoceptor--cAMP system in the BLA in modulating memory consolidation. Male, Sprague--Dawley rats received bilateral infusions of atenolol (a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), prazosin (an alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist) or Rp-cAMPS (a protein kinase A inhibitor) into the BLA 10 min before inhibitory avoidance training and immediate post-training intra-BLA infusions of the GR agonist, RU 28362. Atenolol and Rp-cAMPS, but not prazosin, blocked 48-h retention enhancement induced by RU 28362. A second series of experiments investigated whether a GR antagonist alters the effect of noradrenergic activation in the BLA on memory consolidation. Bilateral intra-BLA infusions of the GR antagonist, RU 38486, administered 10 min before inhibitory avoidance training completely blocked retention enhancement induced by alpha1-adrenoceptor activation and attenuated the dose--response effects of post-training intra-BLA infusions of clenbuterol (a beta-adrenoceptor agonist). However, the GR antagonist did not alter retention enhancement induced by post-training intra-BLA infusions of 8-Br-cAMP (a synthetic cAMP analogue). These findings suggest that glucocorticoids influence the efficacy of noradrenergic stimulation in the BLA on memory consolidation via an interaction with the beta-adrenoceptor--cAMP cascade, at a locus between the membrane-bound beta-adrenoceptor and the intracellular cAMP formation site.",

Lipid mobilizing factor (250 nM) produced comparable increases in intracellular cyclic AMP in CHOK1 cells transfected with the human beta3-adrenoceptor to that obtained with isoprenaline (1 nM). In both cases cyclic AMP production was attenuated by SR59230A confirming that the effect is mediated through a beta3-adrenoceptor. A non-linear regression analysis of binding of lipid mobilizing factor to the beta3-adrenoceptor showed a high affinity binding site with a Kd value 78 +/- 45 nM and a B(max) value (282 +/- 1 fmole mg protein(-1)) comparable with that of other beta3-adrenoceptor agonists.

    "71": "Glucose homeostasis in blood is mainly maintained by insulin released from beta-cells and glucagon released from alpha-cells, both integrated within the pancreatic islet of Langerhans. The secretory processes in both types of cells are triggered by a rise in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+](i)). In this study, rapid effects of the natural hormone E2 on [Ca2+](i) were studied in both types of cells within intact islets using laser scanning confocal microscopy. alpha- And beta-cells showed opposite [Ca2+](i) responses when stimulated with physiological concentrations of 17beta-E2. Although the estrogen produced an increase in the frequency of glucose-induced [Ca2+](i) oscillations in insulin-releasing beta-cells, it prevented the low glucose-induced [Ca2+](i) oscillations in glucagon-releasing alpha-cells. The effects of 17beta-E2 on alpha-cells were mimicked by the cGMP permeable analog 8bromo-cGMP and blocked by the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) inhibitor KT5823. Evidence indicated that these were membrane actions mediated by a nonclassical ER. Both effects were rapid in onset and were reproduced by 17beta-E2 linked to horseradish peroxidase, a cell-impermeable molecule. Furthermore, these actions were not blocked by the specific ER blocker ICI 182,780. Competition studies performed with 17beta-E2 linked to horseradish peroxidase binding in alpha-cells supported the idea that the membrane receptor involved is neither ERalpha nor ERbeta. Additionally, the binding site was shared by the neurotransmitters epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine and had the same pharmacological profile as the receptor previously described for beta-cells. Therefore, rapid estrogen actions in islet cells are initiated by a nonclassical estrogen membrane receptor.",

METHODS OR LITERATURE REVIEWED: English and non-English language articles published from 1968 to 2000 were retrieved using a keyword search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Science Citation Index databases. Randomized controlled trials with comparisons of the effectiveness of interventions to decrease myopia progression in myopic children were reviewed.",

    "76": "Mast cells are involved in the pathogenesis of both allergies to food and inflammatory bowel disorders. In addition, there are several lines of evidence suggesting that mucosal mast cells also respond to intraluminal stimuli. Our aim was to identify neuroendocrine stimuli that could modify mucosal mast cell activity in the rat. Anaesthetized rats were prepared for duodenal perfusion and mast cell activation was measured by analysis of RMCP II concentration in the duodenal perfusate. Either buffered saline solution or a 5% ovalbumin hydrolysate (OVH) solution was infused into the duodenum. Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or afferent ablation by intraluminal treatment with capsaicin diminished RMCP II concentration in basal conditions and significantly reduced the response to OVH, which in control animals induced a three-fold increase of the protease. The noradrenergic blockers phentholamine and propranolol significantly diminished RMCP II concentration in basal conditions and completely blocked the response to OVH. Intravenous infusion of cholecystokinin-related peptides also induced a response of mast cells. However, the response was different depending on the peptide. CCK-8 induced a slight increase of RMCP II, whereas both CCK-33 and gastrin induced a significant decrease in mast cell activity. These results show that intraluminal content modulates mucosal mast cell activity by complex mechanisms involving both nervous and endocrine pathway.",

    "85": "Adrenergic responses are crucial for hypoglycemic recovery. Epinephrine increases glucose production, lipolysis, and peripheral insulin resistance as well as blood flow and glucose delivery. Sympathetic activation causes vasoconstriction and reduces glucose delivery. To determine the effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic activity on muscle glucose uptake during hypoglycemia, we studied forearm blood flow (FBF) (plethysmography), arteriovenous glucose difference (AV-diff), and forearm glucose uptake (FGU) during insulin infusion with 60 min of euglycemia followed by 60 min of hypoglycemia. Twelve healthy subjects (27 plus minus 5 years of age) were randomized to intravenous propranolol (IV PROP, 80 microg/min), intravenous phentolamine (IV PHEN, 500 microg/min), intra-arterial propranolol (IA PROP, 25 microg/min), intra-arterial phentolamine (IA PHEN, 12 microg/min per 100 ml forearm tissue), and saline (SAL). FBF increased during hypoglycemia with SAL (P < 0.001) but not with IA or IV PROP. FGU (P = 0.015) and AV-diff (P = 0.099) fell during hypoglycemia with IA PROP but not with IV PROP. FBF increased during hypoglycemia with IA and IV PHEN (P < 0.005). AV-diff fell during hypoglycemia with IA and IV PHEN (P < 0.01), but FGU was unchanged. Blood pressure fell (P < 0.001), and adrenergic and neuroglycopenic symptoms increased with IV PHEN (P < 0.01). Thus, systemic but not local propranolol prevents a decrease in forearm glucose extraction during hypoglycemia, suggesting that epinephrine increases peripheral muscular insulin resistance through systemic effects. alpha-Adrenergic activation inhibits vasodilation and helps maintain brain glucose delivery.",

    "93": "We established characteristics of power spectral analysis of heart rate variability, and assessed the diurnal variations of autonomic nervous function in guinea pigs. For this purpose, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded for 24 hr from conscious and unrestrained guinea pigs using a telemetry system. There were two major spectral components, at low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) bands, in the power spectrum of HR variability. On the basis of these data, we defined two frequency bands of interest: LF (0.07-0.7 Hz) and HF (0.7-3.0 Hz). The power of LF was higher than that of HF in the normal guinea pigs. Atropine significantly reduced power at HF. Propranolol also significantly reduced power at LF. Furthermore, the decrease in the parasympathetic mechanism produced by atropine was reflected in a slight increase in the LF/HF ratio. The LF/HF ratio appeared to follow the reductions of sympathetic activity produced by propranolol. Autonomic blockade studies indicated that the HF component reflected parasympathetic activity and the LF/HF ratio seemed to be a convenient index of autonomic balance. Nocturnal patterns, in which the values of heart rate in the dark phase (20:00-06:00) were higher than those in the light phase (06:00-20:00), were observed. However, the HF, LF and the LF/HF ratio showed no daily pattern. These results suggest that the autonomic nervous function in guinea pigs has no clear circadian rhythmicity. Therefore, this information may be useful for future studies concerning the autonomic nervous function in this species.",

In the current study, a combinatorial approach was taken to investigate the mechanism of CCE in corneal endothelial cells. Induction of cytochrome P-450s by beta-naphthoflavone (BN) enhanced CCE measured by Sr(2+) entry after store depletion. 5,6-Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (5,6-EET), a proposed CIF generated by cytochrome P-450s (Rzigalinski, B. A., Willoughby, K. A., Hoffman, S. W., Falck, J. R., and Ellis, E. F. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 175-182), induced Ca(2+) entry. Both BN-enhanced CCE and the 5,6-EET-induced Ca(2+) entry were inhibited by the CCE blocker 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, indicating a role for cytochrome P-450s in CCE. Treatment with calyculin A (CalyA), which causes condensation of cortical cytoskeleton, inhibited CCE. The actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D partially reversed the inhibition of CCE by CalyA, suggesting a secretion-like coupling mechanism for CCE. However, CalyA could not inhibit CCE in BN-treated cells, and 5,6-EET caused a partial activation of CCE in CalyA-treated cells. These results further support the notion that cytochrome P-450 metabolites may be CIFs. The vesicular transport inhibitor brefeldin A inhibited CCE in both vehicle- and BN-treated cells. Surprisingly, Sr(2+) entry in the absence of store depletion was enhanced in BN-treated cells, which was also inhibited by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate. An integrative model suggests that both CIF from cytochrome P-450 metabolism and secretion-like coupling mechanisms play roles in CCE in corneal endothelial cells.",

Contact dermatoconjunctivitis was noted in 19 patients (52.8%) and follicular conjunctivitis in 18 (50.0%). The rate of development of those two manifestations was linear and almost parallel throughout the study period. In logistic regression analysis previous allergy to a topically given antiglaucoma medication (t = -5.13) and concurrent use of levobunolol (t = 3.46) were retained as the most probable predictor variables of allergy to brimonidine.

    "118": "School refusal anxiety is a pathopsychological disorder which touches the young child, between 8 and 13 years. Even if the school refusal is studied for a long time, there is not still consensus as for the specific definition of this disorder or on the best way of treating it. Nevertheless, accountable of long-lasting difficulties in school integration, its short and medium term consequences are serious and well known: school desertion, mood disorder and behavioral problems. Speed and quality of the medico-psychological and educational interventions represent a important factor for evolution and prognosis. Although, psychological interventions remain essential, sometimes the interest of an associated psychotropic medication should be discussed. This one can indeed either improve their results or supporting their installations. Despite more than twenty controlled trials in the pediatric population, no definitive psychopharmacological treatment data exist for anxiety disorder in childhood and especially for school refusal disorder. The majority of the studies stress as well the interest of benzodiazepines as tricyclic antidepressants but without being able to specify the possible superiority of a chemical on the other. On the other hand, the side effects of each one are well-documented, in particular for the benzodiazepines (potential abuse, sedation, potential desinhibition, mnemonic disorder), limiting thus their uses in child. In this work, we would like to emphasize the interest of propranolol in the treatment of somatic symptoms usually met in school refusal anxiety. Although beta-blockers have been used in the treatment of neurovegetative symptoms associated with situational anxiety disorders, there is no controlled data and only some open data to guide pediatric use for anxiety disorders in children. Nevertheless, prescribed with low posology and in substitution of benzodiazepine, this medication enabled us in three severe clinical cases to shorter notably the time of school rehabilitation. Well tolerated on the clinical level, with a greater efficiency on the somatic signs related to anxiety than benzodiazepines and with not having their side effects, this therapeutic can constitute a significant support in the psychological treatment of these children. However, these present results require to be confirm by other observations, which will be lead perhaps to a controlled study.",

However, the precise mechanism by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce vascular damage are insufficiently known.

    "120": "The activation of human venous VSMC was measured as cytosolic free calcium mobilization, shape change and protein phosphorylation, focusing on the role of tyrosine phosphorylation-activated PLCgamma.", 
    "121": "The exposure of VSMC to exogenous H2O2 caused a rapid increase in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), and induced a significant VSMC shape change. Both effects were dependent on a tyrosine kinase-mediated mechanism, as determined by the blockade of short-term treatment of VSMC with the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. Giving further support to the putative role of phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent pathways, the [Ca2+]i and VSMC shape change response were equally inhibited by the specific PLC blocker, 1-(6-((17-beta-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U73122). In addition, U73122 had a protective effect against the deleterious action (24 h) of H2O2 on non-confluent VSMC. As a further clarification of the specific pathway involved, the exposure to H2O2 significantly stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCgamma with a concentration- and time-profile similar to that of [Ca(2+)](i) mobilization.", 
    "122": "The present study reveals that H(2)O(2) activates PLCgamma on VSMC through tyrosine phosphorylation and that this activation has a major role in rapid [Ca(2+)](i) mobilization, shape-changing actions and damage by H(2)O(2) in this type of cells. These findings have direct implications for understanding the mechanisms of the vascular actions of H(2)O(2) and may help to design pharmacologically protective strategies.", 
    "123": "Apoptosis is an important mechanism for the preservation of a healthy and balanced immune system in vertebrates. Little is known, however, about how apoptotic processes regulate invertebrate immune defenses. In the present study, we show that noradrenaline, a catecholamine produced by the neuroendocrine system and by immune cells in molluscs, is able to induce apoptosis of oyster Crassostrea gigas hemocytes. The apoptosis-inducing effect of noradrenaline was mimicked by isoproterenol and blocked by propranolol, which indicates that noradrenaline triggers apoptosis via a beta-adrenergic signaling pathway. Exposure to the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK or expression of the caspase inhibitor P35 under the transcriptional control of a mollusc hsp70 gene promoter reduced the number of apoptotic cells among noradrenaline-treated hemocytes. These results suggest that P35-sensitive caspases are involved in the apoptotic process triggered by beta-adrenergic signaling. Complementary experiments suggest that mitogen-activated protein kinases and Rho, a member of the Ras GTPase family, may be involved in antiapoptotic mechanisms that modulate the apoptotic effect of noradrenaline. Taken together, these results provide a first insight into apoptotic processes in mollusc immune cells.",

In these groups and the sham (n=40), we assessed LV function by echocardiography, CS severity, myocardial blood flow and coronary flow reserve, serum ascorbyl free radical, and vitamin C. Both CS and CO increased LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters and decreased ejection fraction. The 4 agents failed to attenuate LV remodeling caused by CO. In contrast, the 3 beta-blockers attenuated (P<0.01) or tended to attenuate the increase in LV end-diastolic diameters caused by CS. With similar blood pressure and heart rate lowering by 3 beta-blockers, carvedilol additionally attenuated the increase in end-systolic diameters and improved ejection fraction. The CS reduced myocardial blood flow and coronary flow reserve, which was reversed by carvedilol without modifying the CS severity. Among the 4 agents, only carvedilol decreased ascorbyl free radical and increased vitamin C.",

Silymarin significantly decreased the bronchoconstriction due to antigen administration in the early phase of the response. In contrast, the dose-response curve for substance P recorded 1 h after antigen challenge was not modified by pretreatment with silymarin. The influence of the flavonoid on hyperresponsiveness to histamine in propranolol- and PAF (platelet-activating factor)-treated animals was also assessed. Silymarin did not affect hyperresponsiveness to histamine induced by either propranolol or PAF although it had inhibitory activity on the bronchial contractile response to the autacoid. These results suggest that silymarin has a protective effect in the early phase of allergic asthma, an effect, which may be related to a negative influence of the flavonoid on bronchial responsiveness to histamine.",

The beta2-adrenoceptor-selective antagonist, ICI118551 (erythro-(+/- )-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloyl)-3-isopropylaminobutan-2-ol HCl), antagonised the isoprenaline inhibition of histamine release from human lung mast cells with high affinity (apparent pK(B); 9.5 +/- 0.2), whereas high concentrations of the beta1-adrenoceptor-selective antagonist, CGP20712A (2-hydroxy-5-(2-(hydroxy-3-(4((1-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl)-1-H-imidazol-2-yl)-phenoxy)-propyl)-aminoethoxyl)-benzamide), were required to reverse the isoprenaline inhibition (apparent pK(B); 6.5 +/- 0.3). Radioligand binding studies using [125I]-iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) were performed on membranes derived from purified mast cells (>90% purity). Binding of [125I]CYP to mast cell membranes was displaced from a single binding site with a high affinity for ICI118551 (pK(i); 8.9 +/- 0.1) and low affinity for CGP20712A (pK(i); 6.0 +/- 0.03), indicative of a homogeneous population of beta2-adrenoceptors. In contrast, in human lung membranes, these antagonists displaced [125I]CYP from two sites indicative of a heterogeneous population of beta1-adrenoceptors (20%) and beta2-adrenoceptors (80%). These data indicate that the beta-adrenoceptor expressed by human lung mast cells and mediating inhibition of mediator release from these cells is the beta2-adrenoceptor.", 
    "129": "Many of the estimated 50 million Americans with high blood pressure receive medications for hypertension and for other conditions, placing them at risk for adverse drug interactions. The risk for hypertension and for adverse drug reactions is highest in the elderly, who have the greatest need for pharmacologic therapy. The most important class of drug interactions involves the cytochrome P450 microsomal enzyme system, which handles a variety of xenobiotic substances. A potential for interactions with these enzymes exists with calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers but not with diuretic antihypertensives, which are renally eliminated and more vulnerable to drug interactions that occur in the kidney. This article reviews the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, identifies drugs and foods that have been implicated in metabolic interactions with antihypertensive agents, and suggests measures for reducing the risk of adverse events when drugs are coadministered.",

It is more commonly seen in younger age groups and has a predilection for postpartum women. The clinical spectrum of its presentation includes angina, myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and death. No specific cardiac risk factors have been associated with its occurrence. In postpartum patients, it is presumed that dissection results from pregnancy-induced degeneration of collagen and the additional stresses of parturition. The sporadic nature of spontaneous coronary artery dissection has precluded the development of any consensus for a medical approach, and treatment is usually tailored to individual patient needs. A case of postpartum spiral dissection of the left anterior descending coronary artery with successful medical management is reported.", 
    "131": "In this study we evaluated a liquid-liquid extraction procedure and a solid-phase extraction procedure for sample preparation for the enantioselective analysis of atenolol in plasma and urine by high-performance liquid chromatography. A Chiralcel OD-H column was used for the resolution of atenolol enantiomers with hexane-ethanol (85:15, v/v) plus 0.1% diethylamine as the mobile phase. In the liquid-liquid extraction procedure, atenolol was extracted from alkalinized body fluids with 5 ml chloroform-2-propanol (4:1, v/v). In the solid-phase extraction procedure, atenolol was isolated from plasma using a C8 column and methanol. Both extraction procedures were efficient in recovering atenolol and removing endogenous interferents. The RSDs and deviation from nominal values were lower than 10% for both within-day and between-day assays. The results show that there were no statistically significant differences in between-day variation. The t-test showed that there were no significant differences between the real concentrations and the determined concentrations. The limit of quantitation was 10 ng/ml and the linear range was 10-5,000 ng/ml for both methods. These methods can be used in pharmacokinetic studies.", 
    "132": "In a previous retrospective study, long-term treatment of essential hypertensive patients with a slow-release calcium channel blocker resulted in normal resistance artery structure and endothelial function, which did not occur with a beta-blocker. In the present prospective study, 19 previously untreated essential hypertensive patients (aged 47 +/- 2 years, 75% male) were treated for 1 year in a double-blind randomized study with the long-acting calcium channel blocker amlodipine or the beta-blocker atenolol. Resistance arteries (lumen diameter, 150 to 350 microm) dissected from gluteal subcutaneous biopsies were studied on a pressurized myograph. Blood pressure (BP) control (129 +/- 2/85 +/- 2 mm Hg) was identical in both groups for the last 6 months of the study. After 1 year of treatment with amlodipine, the media-to-lumen ratio (M/L) of resistance arteries decreased from 7.89% +/- 0.40% to 6.81% +/- 0.41% (P < .05). Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation tended to improve from 84.3% +/- 5.5% to 90.5% +/- 4.8% (P = .06), whereas sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation was unchanged in the patients treated with amlodipine. In the beta-blocker-treated group there was no significant change in M/L or acetylcholine-induced relaxation. In conclusion, treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine corrected altered resistance artery structure and tended to improve endothelial function in essential hypertensive patients, whereas similar good control of BP with the beta-blocker atenolol did not. Whether the vascular protective effect of amlodipine will result in improved outcomes in hypertension remains to be demonstrated.",

A total of 1,747 patients (44%) had a history of hypertension; 871 were randomized to receive metoprolol CR/XL and 876 to receive placebo. Treatment with metoprolol CR/XL compared with placebo resulted in a significant reduction in total mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.84; P =.0022), mainly because of reductions in sudden death (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33-0.79; P =.0022) and mortality from worsening heart failure (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.99; P =.042). Total number of hospitalizations for worsening heart failure was reduced by 30% in the metoprolol CR/XL group compared with placebo (P =.015).

The phenomenon is disrupted by the 5HT1A partial agonist and the D2 receptor antagonist buspirone, a compound that also blocks the effect on startle of conditioned fear, and it was suggested that light-enhanced startle reflects an anxious state produced by bright light. It was also suggested that pre-test handling may be necessary for light-enhanced startle. To characterize this phenomenon further, we evaluate here the sensitivity of light-enhanced startle to the anxiolytic compound chlordiazepoxide, to the noradrenergic beta-receptor antagonist propranolol, and to pre-test handling.",

    "141": "In congestive heart failure patients, treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists improves symptoms and decreases mortality. However, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists might be disadvantageous in chronic heart failure. The nonselective beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist bucindolol has failed to decrease mortality in clinical trials. A putative beta4-adrenoceptor, which mediates positive inotropic effects by activation of the adenylate cyclase has been described. Recently, this putative beta4-adrenoceptor has been identified to be a propranolol-insensitive state of the beta1-adrenoceptor. The present study aimed to characterize whether bucindolol exhibits agonistic activity on this atypical beta1-adrenoceptor state as one possible reason for clinical inefficiency. For comparison (S)-4-(3'-t-butylamino-1'-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidozole-2 (CGP 12177), metoprolol, and nebivolol were investigated. Bucindolol did not reveal intrinsic sympathomimetic activity in electrically driven (1 Hz, 37 degrees C), forskolin-stimulated, left ventricular papillary muscle strips (donor hearts, nonfailing; n = 5) and in right auricular trabeculae (bypass operation; n = 4). Functional studies on the propranolol-insensitive state of beta1-adrenoceptors were performed in isolated muscle preparations after beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonism (propranolol, 1 microM), inhibition of beta3-mediated inotropic effects (N-nitro-L-arginine, 100 microM) and forskolin treatment (0.3 microM). Positive inotropic response to stimulation of atypical state beta1-adrenoceptors could be demonstrated in right auricular as well as left ventricular human myocardium (CGP 12177 treatment, 10 microM). Under these conditions, also bucindolol, but not metoprolol and nebivolol, significantly increased contractility (all 10 microM). In conclusion, bucindolol but not metoprolol or nebivolol mediate positive inotropic effects in human myocardium due to activation of atypical state beta1-adrenoceptors. Thus, the agonistic activity of bucindolol may influence outcome in heart failure patients.", 
    "142": "1. This study deals with phosphorylation and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) via beta(3)-adrenoceptor (AR) and the signal transduction pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 2. beta(3)-AR agonist BRL37344A (10 nM) caused phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAPK in 3T3-L1 adipocytes but not in fibroblasts. BRL37344A and also the other beta(3)-AR agonists, CGP12177A and SR58611A, caused p38 MAPK phosphorylation in dose-dependent manners. 3. The p38 MAPK phosphorylations by BRL37344A (10 nM), CGP12177A (100 nM), and SR58611A (10 nM) were not antagonized by beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs antagonist 1-propranolol (100 nM) but blocked by beta(3)-AR antagonist SR59230A (10 microM), suggesting the phosphorylation was caused via beta(3)-AR. 4. The phosphorylations of p38 MAPK were completely abolished by treatment with cholera toxin (CTX) but not pertussis toxin (100 ng ml(-1), 24 h). Activation of Gs by CTX (100 ng ml(-1)) and adenylyl cyclase by forskolin mimicked p38 MAPK phosphorylation. 5. p38 MAPK phosphorylation by BRL37344A was reduced to almost 50% by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitors such as H89 (10 microM) and PKI (10 microM). A src-family tyrosine kinases inhibitor PP2 (1 microM) also halved the p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Combined use of H89 (10 microM) and PP2 (10 microM) did not bring about further inhibition. 6. These results suggest that beta(3)-AR caused phosphorylation of p38 MAPK via Gs protein and partly through a pathway involving PKA and src-family kinase(s), although the contribution of the unidentified pathway remains to be clarified.",

Rp-cAMPS triethylamine (3 x 10(-6) M) abolished the effect of isoproterenol. Besides, exposure to 3 x 10(-9) M forskolin for 1 h also potentiated the relaxant response to 17 beta-estradiol.",

    "152": "Smoking is a major cause of coronary heart disease for both men and women and a positive correlation between tobacco use and cerebrovascular disease has been also described. In addition, cigarette smoking is the most powerful risk factor predisposing to atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease. More recently, passive smoking has been also shown to represent an important risk factor for coronary artery disease. Moreover, the incidence of coronary artery and cerebrovascular diseases in ex-smokers consistently decreases after cessation, further underlying the relevance of smoking as a risk factor for these pathological conditions. The effects of cigarette smoking on atherosclerosis initiation and progression as well on its complications are mostly responsible for the enhanced cardio- and cerebrovascular risk observed in smoking compared to non-smoking subjects. Since hormonal status may also play a role in the development and stability of the atherosclerotic plaque, smoking habits could influence the clinical complications of atheroclerosis in a gender dependent manner. Up to now, however, few studies have investigated the relative importance of smoking as a risk factor for fatal and non-fatal diseases in the two sexes within the same study population. On the basis of available clinical data, this review will discuss the risk of fatal and non-fatal diseases among smoking men and women with special emphasis on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease which also represents the most common cause of death among smokers. A description of the mechanisms involved in the tobacco-induced atherosclerotic damage will be also given in order to underline possible gender-related differences.",

GYKI 16638 (5 microM), at stimulation cycle length of 1000 ms, lengthened action potential duration (APD(90)) from 338.9 +/- 28.6 ms to 385.4 +/- 24 ms (n = 9, p > 0.05). This APD lengthening effect, unlike that of sotalol (30 microM), was rate-independent. GYKI 16638, contrary to sotalol and like mexiletine (10 microM), exerted a use-dependent depression of the maximal rate of depolarization (V(max)) which amounted to 36.4 +/- 11.7% at cycle length of 400 ms (n = 5, p < 0.05) and was characterised with an offset kinetical time constant of 298.6 +/- 70.2 ms.

    "163": "A pulsed ultrafiltration-mass spectrometric screening method has been developed to evaluate the metabolic stability of drugs. Pooled human liver microsomes containing cytochrome P450 enzymes were trapped by an ultrafiltration membrane in a stirred flow-through chamber, and eight beta-blocker drugs including acebutolol, alprenolol, atenolol, metoprolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, propranolol, and timolol were flow-injected through the chamber along with the cofactor NADPH. The ultrafiltrate was collected, concentrated and analyzed by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) in order to quantitate the unmetabolized fraction of each drug. The metabolic stability of each beta-blocker was determined based on the difference between the corresponding LC-MS-MS peak areas of an experimental incubation and a control without NADPH. A flow-through incubation method, pulsed ultrafiltration metabolic screening minimizes the potential for product feed back inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes. The importance of this phenomenon was illustrated by the observation that the metabolic stability of the set of beta-blocker drugs measured using pulsed ultrafiltration more closely resembled the in vivo stability than that determined using a conventional batch incubation with microsomes or an incubation with human hepatocytes. Since a mixture of compounds was analyzed, the relative metabolic stability of each compound could be assessed by comparison to the other compounds in the incubation. This approach might be particularly useful for the ranking of a directed library of drug leads with respect to metabolic stability and then the selection of lead compounds for further drug development.",

The binding affinities of all the compounds were determined for human beta(1)-ARs expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and the antagonist potency for rat atrial beta(1)-ARs was determined for 32 of these compounds for comparative purposes. The compounds, based upon a phenoxypropanolamine core structure with various meta-, ortho-, para- and amine-substituents, displayed binding affinities (pK(i)) for the human beta(1)-AR ranging from 5.49 to 9.35. Antagonist potencies (pA(2)) in the rat ranged from 5.52 to 9.56 and correlated with the human binding affinities (r(2)=0.86). Twenty-six compounds were used as the training set for comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) of antagonist binding affinity at the human beta(1)-AR and also of antagonist potency for rat atrial beta(1)-ARs. The CoMFA models were derived using both the CoMFA electrostatic and steric field parameters. The initial human beta(1)-AR model (n=26, q(2)=0.59, ONC=6, SE(CV)=0.70, r(2)=0.98, SE(non-CV)=0.16, F(6,19)=148) predicted the binding affinities of seven out of ten test compounds, not included in the training set, with residual pK(i) values less-than-or-equal0.50.

    "171": "Postinfarction left ventricular remodeling begins early after acute myocardial infarction and may continue for months to years afterward. Early re-establishment of flow in the occluded artery is associated with smaller left ventricular cavity volumes and reduced remodeling. Acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolytic therapy (for patients more than 1 hour away from a catheterization facility) as early as possible after symptoms is critical. Late reperfusion (PCI more than 12 hours after infarction) may prove useful, and this will be determined by the results of ongoing clinical trials. Recurrent MI is reduced by antiplatelet agents (aspirin in most patients) and by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. Intravenous nitroglycerin may limit early (initial 24 hours) dilatation following infarction, but long-term use in asymptomatic patients is not efficacious. Beta- adrenergic receptor antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have independent efficacy in attenuating the early and late phases of remodeling. The combined use of a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor has greater efficacy than either agent alone, provided they are tolerated hemodynamically. Although angiotensin II receptor antagonists have similar efficacy to ACE inhibitors and have fewer side effects, the angiotensin II receptor blockers should be reserved for patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors. In patients requiring diuretic therapy, spironolactone is preferred because of its salutary properties regarding extracellular matrix remodeling, specifically in reducing fibrosis. Surgical revascularization with or without associated mitral valve repair is useful in selected patients with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation or hibernating myocardium. New therapies directed at modulating the remodeling process may focus on manipulating the components of the extracellular matrix to reduce the deleterious impact of this process.", 
    "172": "The effect of alginic acid addition to 1% or 2% carteolol solutions on the ocular penetration of the drug has been evaluated in the pigmented rabbit. During single dose studies, an increase in bioavailability ranging from 40% to 60% was observed in the aqueous humor and in the iris-ciliary body. During repeated dose studies, this increased ocular bioavailability of carteolol in the presence of alginic acid led to an equivalent concentration in the target tissue, although the dosage was only once a day compared with twice a day for the usual carteolol eyedrops. 14C-carteolol distribution studies demonstrated the binding of carteolol in pigmented ocular tissues. Thus, the presence of alginic acid as a new excipient supports a possible decrease in dosage regimen, while retaining sufficient ocular bioavailability to lower intraocular pressure.",

A bolus infusion of L-histamine at doses of 10--10(3) nmol/rat into the third cerebral ventricle (i3vt) dose-dependently increased glycerol concentration in the perfusate from the epididymal adipose tissue. I3vt infusion of 10(2) nmol/rat thioperamide, an autoinhibitory H(3) receptor antagonist that activates histamine neurons to increase synthesis and release of neuronal histamine, convincingly mimicked histamine action in the augmented lipolysis. Intraperitoneal pretreatment with propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, abolished the thioperamide-induced lipolytic action. An electrophysiological study demonstrated that efferent sympathetic nerves innervating the epididymal fat were activated after the i3vt infusion of thioperamide. Hypothalamic histamine neurons thus regulate peripheral lipid metabolism through the accelerating lipolytic action by activation of sympathetic beta-adrenoceptor.", 
    "178": "We first investigated the relaxations of the urinary bladder induced by beta-adrenoceptor agonists in anesthetized cynomolgus monkeys and then employed a variety of beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists in vitro to identify the beta-adrenoceptor subtype responsible for the relaxation (using isolated monkey detrusors). Isoprenaline reduced bladder pressure in a dose-dependent manner. Isoprenaline, noradrenaline and adrenaline each produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of isolated detrusor strips, the rank order of relaxing potencies being isoprenaline > noradrenaline > adrenaline. Subtype-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonists also relaxed isolated detrusor strips, the rank order of potencies being CGP-12177 > BRL 37344 > dobutamine, salbutamol, procaterol > xamoterol. In the antagonist experiment, bupranolol (beta-antagonist, 10(-6) to 10(-5) M) and SR 58894A (beta3-antagonist, 10(-7) to 10(-5) M) caused a rightward shift of the concentration-relaxation curve for isoprenaline, but CGP-20712A (beta1-antagonist, 10(-9) to 10(-7) M) and ICI-118551 (beta2-antagonist, 10(-9) to 10(-7) M) did not.

    "179": "We aimed to investigate whether the improvement of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function by cibenzoline, a class Ia antiarrhythmic drug, in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is due to LV afterload reduction or a primary lusitropic effect on LV. Twenty-three patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (11; HOCM, 12; non-obstructive HCM; HNCM) were examined. Pulsed-wave Doppler, color M-mode and tissue Doppler echocardiography were performed before and 90 minutes after oral administration of cibenzoline (300 mg), and were compared with a treatment of bisoprolol (5 mg/day, 10 days). Early (E) and late diastolic LV inflow velocity, E flow propagation velocity (FPV) and early diastolic mitral annulus velocity (Ea) were measured. E/FPV and E/Ea were calculated as indices of LV filling pressure. LV outflow pressure gradients estimated using continuous-wave Doppler in HOCM markedly decreased after cibenzoline (83 +/- 42 to 40 +/- 33 mmHg, p < 0.005) and bisoprolol (44 +/- 40 mmHg, p < 0.005). Following cibenzoline, E/FPV and E/Ea were significantly decreased in both HOCM (1.75 +/- 0.53 to 1.32 +/- 0.28, p < 0.05, 18.9 +/- 6.2 to 14.8 +/- 5.0, p < 0.05, respectively) and HNCM (1.75 +/- 0.58 to 1.41 +/- 0.73, p< 0.05, 13.0 +/- 4.3 to 9.7 +/- 3.6, p< 0.01, respectively). Those in HNCM did not change by bisoprolol. Cibenzoline improved LV diastolic function in HCM, whereas bisoprolol did not affect it. Thus, the primary lusitropic effect of cibenzoline rather than LV after load reduction might have contributed to the improvement of diastolic function in HOCM.", 
    "180": "This study investigated adrenoreceptor-mediated responses of muscularis mucosae from the fundic and antral ends of the rabbit gastric corpus. Norepinephrine-induced fundic muscularis mucosae contractions were enhanced by propranolol and converted to relaxations by phentolamine. Methoxamine, but not clonidine, elicited large fundic contractions. Fundic muscle responded to low isoproterenol concentrations with atenolol- and butoxamine-resistant relaxations, and to high concentrations with atenolol-sensitive contractions. Norepinephrine evoked propranolol-resistant relaxations of antral muscularis mucosae that were enhanced by phentolamine. Methoxamine and clonidine elicited small antral contractions. Lower concentrations of isoproterenol caused atenolol-resistant antral relaxations that were enhanced by butoxamine; higher concentrations produced weak excitation. Fundic and antral relaxations to isoproterenol were abolished by cyanopindolol. Fundic muscularis mucosae possesses excitatory alpha1-, beta1- and inhibitory beta3-adrenoreceptors. Excitatory beta2- and inhibitory beta3-adrenoreceptors predominate in the antral region. The heterogeneous adrenoreceptor-mediated responses of the gastric muscularis mucosae suggest that adrenergic modulation of its motor activity is unlikely to be linked to acid secretion.",

These changes were comparable to the effects observed after the intravitreal administration of 20 mM NMDA. Co-administration of nipradilol, an alpha- and beta-blocker, with anti-NSE antibody or 20 mM NMDA caused marked recovery of the affected ERG responses within 2 weeks. In contrast, administration of timolol or betaxolol showed no recovery effect on the ERG responses. Among these drugs, only betaxolol showed a recovery effect on NMDA-induced decrease of rhodopsin phosphorylation. Nilvadipine functioned beneficially on both impaired ERG and rhodopsin phosphorylation reactions observed in rat eyes injected intravitreously with anti-NSE antibody or NMDA.
