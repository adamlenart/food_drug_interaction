    "0": "Superfused segments of mouse ileum exhibited spontaneous movement which Mwere inhibited by sympathomimetic amines. Isoprenaline and adrenaline were approximately equipotent and about 15 times more potent than either noradrenaline or phenylephrine. Supersensitivity developed to all these agents when mice had been 'sympathectomized' with NGF-antiserum or 6-hydroxydopamine and it was more pronounced with the latter treatment. Responses to the amines were reduced by phentolamine and propranolol, alone or in combination, with the exception of phenylephrine, the responses to which were simply shortened in duration after,beta-adrenoceptor blockade. No qualitative changes were evident in the effects of the blocking agents after 'sympathectomy'.", 
    "1": "When tissue metabolic changes like those of hypoxia were induced by intra-aortic infusion of cyanide in dogs, cardiac output began to increase after 3 to 5 min, reached a peak (220% of the control value) at 15 min, and returned to control in 40 min. This pattern of cardiac output rise was not altered by vagotomy with or without atropine pretreatment. However, this cardiac output response could be differentiated into three phases by pretreating the animals with agents that block specific activities of the sympatho-adrenal system. First, ganglionic blockade produced by mecamylamine or sympathetic nerve blockade by bretylium abolished the middle phase of the cardiac output seen in the untreated animal, but early and late phases still could be discerned. Second, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade produced by propranolol shortened the total duration of the cardiac output rise by abolishing the late phase. Third, when given together, propranolol and mecamylamine (or bretylium) prevented most of the cardiac output rise that follows the early phase. When cyanide was given to splenectomized dogs, the duration of the cardiac output response was not shortened, but the response became biphasic, resembling that seen after chemical sympathectomy. A similar biphasic response of the cardiac output also resulted from splenic denervation; sham operation or nephrectomy had no effect on the monophasic pattern of the normal response. Splenic venous blood obtained from cyanide-treated dogs, when infused intraportally, caused an increase in cardiac output in recipient dogs; similar infusion of arterial blood had no effects. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE CARDIAC OUTPUT RESPONSE TO CYANIDE INFUSION CONSISTS OF THREE COMPONENTS: an early phase, related neither to the autonomic nervous system nor to circulating catecholamines; a middle phase, caused by a nonadrenergic humoral substance released from the spleen by sympathetic stimulation; and a late phase, dependent upon adrenergic receptors but not upon sympathetic transmission.", 
    "2": "1. Cold storage (2 degrees C) treatment progressively reduced noradrenaline uptake by the taenia caecum of the guinea-pig. After 15 days of cold treatment, [(3)H]-noradrenaline uptake by tissue was reduced to about 10% of control. On the other hand, prolonged cold storage failed to decrease [(3)H]-adenosine uptake by the taenia caecum.2. Cocaine (10 muM) inhibited noradrenaline uptake by about 82% but nucleoside uptake was inhibited by 20%. Cocaine treatment failed to decrease the residual noradrenaline uptake in the cold stored strips (more than 10 days). Phenoxybenzamine (1 muM) or oligomycin (1 mug/ml) treatment decreased the tissue adenosine uptake to about 34% and 28% of the respective controls.3. Based on thin layer chromatography, it was estimated that approximately 68% of [(3)H]-adenosine was converted into and retained as [(3)H]-ATP in the fresh tissues, a small fraction was accountable as [(3)H]-adenosine (18%) but virtually no [(3)H]-AMP, [(3)H]-cyclic AMP or [(3)H]-ADP was detected. Similar distribution of radioactivity of nucleotides was observed in tissues cold stored for 8 days.4. The inhibition of the mechanical activity of taenia by noradrenaline (10 muM), papaverine (100 muM) and nitroglycerine (100 muM) was accompanied by [(3)H]-adenine nucleotide but not [(3)H]-noradrenaline release. Treatment with phentolamine and propranolol (both 1 muM) had no effect on the adenine nucleotide release elicited by nicotine and electrical field stimulation, whereas such treatment reduced the inhibitory action of both stimuli.5. These results suggest that the nucleotide release after application of electrical and chemical stimulation may be from an extraneurogenic source. Thus, we conclude that ATP or a related nucleotide is not the chemical transmitter of the non-adrenergic inhibition in the taenia caecum of the guinea-pig.", 
    "3": "Labile hypertension is often associated with elevated cardiac output, increased plasma renin activity (PRA) and urinary cyclic AMP excretion in response to upright posture and to isoproterenol. The beta-blocking agent propranolol was demonstrated to be an effective therapeutic agent in this condition. The effect of posture on cyclic AMP, PRA, pulse rate and blood pressure was therefore studied during the administration of propranolol and a placebo in patients with labile hypertension. With the patient on placebo, upright posture induced an increase in pulse rate, cyclic AMP excretion and PRA. Propranolol administration decreased the recumbent and upright blood pressures, pulse rate and PRA. Cyclic AMP excretion remained unchanged in the recumbent position but the postural increase was abolished. No appreciable changes in catecholamine excretion occurred during propranolol administration. Propranolol normalizes some humoral as well as hemodynamic abnormalities of labile hypertension and therefore may be of benefit in long-term treatment and possibly also in the prevention of stable hypertension.", 
    "4": "Acute hypoxemia produced by the inhalation of 8% and 5% oxygen increased cardiac output in intact anesthetized dogs by 38% and 62%, respectively. Although practolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, reduced the increase in cardiac output in dogs subjected to severe hypoxemia (5% O(2) breathing) from 62% to 43%, it only slightly reduced the cardiac output rise in dogs subjected to moderate hypoxemia (8% O(2) breathing). Splenectomy, on the other hand, abolished the increase in cardiac output produced by moderate hypoxemia except for a small initial rise, but it reduced the increase in cardiac output during severe hypoxemia only to 37%. The entire increase, except for a small initial rise, disappeared only when splenectomized dogs were pretreated with practolol. Sham operation did not affect the cardiac output response to hypoxemia. It is concluded that an intact spleen is required for a significant portion of the increased cardiac output that occurs during both moderate and severe hypoxemia and that catecholamines do not participate in the regulation of cardiac output unless severe hypoxemia occurs."
