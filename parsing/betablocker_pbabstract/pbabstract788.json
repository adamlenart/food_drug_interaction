    "0": "To obtain further information on the mechanism by which catecholamines produce myocardial ischemia, the effects of propranolol on metabolic and mechanical responses to adrenaline or noradrenaline were investigated in coronary-constricted dogs. Propranolol suppressed the myocardial ischemia produced by noradrenaline and adrenaline in dogs with moderate coronary constriction.", 
    "1": "The ability of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, with and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and of verapamil to protect the heart against hypoxia-induced damage was investigated. Damage was quantitated in terms of a raised end-diastolic resting tension and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) release. The results indicate that both the d and the l isomers act differently, the isomers preventing CPK release and the d isomers preventing the increase in resting tension.", 
    "2": "Ligation of one of the small branches of the canine left anterior descending coronary artery produced a typical anaerobic response in the region of myocardium that had been perfused by the ligated artery; the myocardial glycogen and phosphocreatine levels decreased, and the myocardial phosphorylase activity increased after coronary artery ligation. Pretreatment of the dogs with nitroglycerin or propranolol prevented or diminished the typical anaerobic response of the myocardium to coronary artery ligation, but the pretreatment with dipyridamole did not.", 
    "3": "(-)-Adrenaline caused concentration-dependent increases in cAMP levels and the rate of beating in eight-day-old heart cell cultures of newborn rats. Half-maximal increases in both parameters (5- and 0.2 -fold, respectively) occurred at about 10(-6)M. Following the addition of 3 X 10(-7) M adrenaline, the cellular cAMP level rose to a max imum in 30 sec. The rise was abolished by 5 X 10(-8) M (-)-propranolol and was greatly magnified by 10(-4) M 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. In the presence of the latter compound, the average rate of accumulation of cAMP in thecultures during the first 10 seconds of exposure to 3 X 10(-7) M adrenaline was 8.78 pmol/mg of protein-sec, which is 230 times more rapid than the basal accumulation rate. These findings may be taken as evidence in support of the view that cAMP is involved in the positive chronotropic action of adrenaline on cardiac pacemaker cells.", 
    "4": "Isoproterenol-induced myocardial necrosis (ISO-MN) was obviated by the cardioselective beta-blocker, practolol, suggesting that ISO-MN is caused by specific activation of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors. Because cAMP is the \"second messenger\" in such activation, enhanced activity of cAMP should aggravate ISO-MN. Pretreatment of rats with bretylium in various amounts, elicited no ill effects but enhanced the effects of ISO on the cAMP activity and also intensified the ISO-induced structural changes in the myocardium.", 
    "5": "With the use of an organ redoximeter, the effects of noradrenaline, adrenaline, isoproterenol, and phenylephrine on the oxidation-reduction state of the myocardial pyridine nucleotides were studied in the canine heart-lung preparation supported by a donor. Noradrenaline and adrenaline produced an initial, transient improvement, and phenylephrine a sustained improvement, of the redox state, while isoproterenol produced a depression. Pretreatment of the preparation with adrenergic alpha-blockers resulted in an abolishment of the improvement by noradrenaline, adrenaline, and phenylephrine, while the depression by isoproterenol remained unchanged. Whereas noradrenaline and adrenaline produced a sustained improvement after an adrenergic beta-blocker, propranolol, the effect of isoproterenol was abolished. These findings suggest that sympathomimetic amines can produce an improvement of the myocardial energy metabolism through activation of the adrenergic alpha-receptor. The depression of the myocardial oxidation-reduction state was taken to represent an acceleration of glycolysis.", 
    "6": "A sensitive and specific thin-layer chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of acebutolol [DL-1-(2-acetyl-4-n-butyramidophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropane] and its major metabolite [DL-1-(2-acetyl-4-acetamidophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropane] is described. A 2-ml volume of serum with 350 ng of quinidine as internal standard was extracted at pH 10, the solvent was evaporated off and the residue was dissolved in 50 mul of methanol. A 10-mul volume of the solution was spotted on a thin-layer plate and after elution (ethyl acetate-methanol-ammonia, 75:20:5) the plate was dried at 90 for 15 min and, after cooling, dipped in a 10% paraffin wax solution. The fluorescence was measured using a spectrofluorimeter with a thin-layer scanning attachment. The peak-height ratios of acebutolol to internal standard and metabolite to internal standard were used to quantitate acebutolol and the metabolite, respectively.", 
    "7": "(--)-[3H]Dihydroalprenolol, a potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, was used to identify binding sites which have the characteristics of beta-adrenergic receptors in membranes from rat adipocytes. The subcellular distribution of the (--)-[3H]Dihydroalprenolol binding sites was examined. The binding sites were predominantly in the plasma membrane fraction, consistent with the proposal that the physiologically significant beta-adrenergic receptors are localized in the adipocyte plasma membrane. Binding of (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol to unfractionated adipose membranes was saturable with 0.24 pmol bound/mg of protein at saturation. Half-maximal saturation occurred at 15 nM providing an estimate of the equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, for the interaction of (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol with its adipocyte receptor. Kinetic analysis of (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding provided a value of 2.4 X 10(7) M-1 min-1 for the forward bimolecular rate constant, k1. Dissociation of (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol was a first order reaction with a rate constant, k2, of 2.94 X 10(-1) min-1. The ratio k2/k1 = 12 nM provides an independent measurement of the KD for the interaction of (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol with its receptor which is in good agreement with the values obtained by steady state analysis (12 to 15 nM). Beta-Adrenergic agonists and antagonists competed for the binding sites in unfractionated adipocyte membranes with a typical beta1-adrenergic specificity. The order of potency of agonists was (--)-isoproterenol greater than (--)-norepinephrine congruent to (--)-epinephrine. The beta-adrenergic antagonist, (--)-propranolol, potently competed for the binding sites with a KD of 17 nM. Compounds such as dihydroxyphenylaline, dihydroxymandelic acid, normetanephrine, pyrocatechol, and phentolamine which are structurally related to beta-adrenergic agents, but are devoid of beta-adrenergic physiologicl effects in adipocytes, did not compete for the binding sites. Binding was highly stereospecific, the (+) isomers of adrenergic agonists and antagonists requiring 23- to 330-fold higher concentrations to half-maximally inhibit binding than the corresponding (--) stereoisomers. (--)-[3H]Dihydroalprenolol binding was examined highly enriched plasma membrane, mitochondrial, and microsomal (endoplasmic reticulum) fractions of adipocytes. In the presence of 12 nM (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol, the specific activity of binding in the plasma membrane fraction was 5-fold higher than that of the mitochondrial fraction and 8-fold higher than that of the microsomal (endoplasmic reticulum) fraction. The specificity and affinity characteristics of the plasma membrane binding sites were found to be virtually identical with those of the unfractionated adipocyte membranes. The observation that (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites are predominantly localized in the plasma membrane fraction suggests the potential usefulness of this ligand as a marker for adipocyte plasma membranes.", 
    "8": "Catecholamines increased guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) accumulation by isolated rat liver cells. The increases in cyclic GMP due to 1.5 muM epinephrine, isoproterenol, or phenylephrine were blocked by phenoxybenzamine but not by propranolol. The possibility that cyclic GMP is involved in the glycogenolytic action of catecholamines seems unlikely since cyclic GMP accumulation is also elevated by carbachol, insulin, A23187, and to a lesser extent by glucagon. Furthermore, carbachol had little effect on glycogenolysis while insulin actually inhibited hepatic glycogenolysis. The rise in cyclic GMP due to carbachol was abolished by atropine and that due to all agents was markedly reduced by the omission of extracellular calcium. However, the glycogenolytic action of glucagon and catecholamines was only slightly inhibited by the omission of calcium. The only agent which was unable to stimulate glycogenolysis in calcium-free buffer was the divalent cation ionophore A23187. There was a drop in ATP content of liver cells during incubation in calcium-free buffer which was accompanied by an inhibition of glucagon-activated adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation. The presence of calcium inhibited the rise in adenylate cyclase activity of lysed rat liver cells due to glucagon or isoproterenol but not that due to fluoride. These results suggest that the stimulation by catecholamines and glucagon of glycogenolysis is not mediated through cyclic GMP nor does it depend on the presence of extracellular calcium. Cyclic GMP accumulation was increased in liver cells by agents which either inhibit, have little affect, or accelerate glycogenolysis. The significance of elevations of cyclic GMP in rat liver cells remains to be established.", 
    "9": "Addition of choleragen to rat pineal organ cultures caused a long-lasting stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity, and this was followed by increases in seroton N-acetyltransferase and cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase activities. These effects of choleragen were not blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, but the increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase and serotonin N-acetyltransferase activities could be prevented by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The results indicate that cholera toxin can mimic the induction of pineal enzymes that normally follows beta-adrenoceptor activation and suggest that increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate is a necessary and sufficient signal for such changes in enzyme activity.", 
    "10": "A radioactively labeled alpha-adrenergic antagonist, [3H]dihydroergocryptine, binds specifically to a site on rabbit uterine membranes. Binding is rapid, reaching equilibrium in less than 17 minutes at 25 degrees C. Adrenergic agonists compete for this binding site with an order of affinities identical to the pharmacological potency order of these agents as alpha-adrenergic agonists (epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than isoprotereonl). The (-) stereoisomers of epinephrine and norepinephrine are 30 times more potent in competing for the site than the corresponding (+) stereoisomers. alpha-Adrenergic antagonists, such as phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine, potently compete for the binding sites while the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol does not. Structural analogs of catecholamines that are devoid of alpha-adrenergic physiological activity do not compete for [3H]dihydroergocryptine binding sites. These data suggest that alpha-adrenergic receptors can be directly identified and studied by [3H]dihydroergocryptine binding.", 
    "11": "We compared methods of classifying hypertension according to plasma renin activity in 54 patients with essential hypertension and examined the validity of using these classifications to choose between two hypotensive drugs. A prospective, double-blind crossover study was used. Normal values for plasma renin activity were established from 111 control subjects. Plasma renin activity was related to race and inversely to age in hypertensive patients (P less than 0.05) but not in normal subjects. Three methods of classification correlated well but did not identify exactly the same renin-suppressed patients. Chlorthalidone produced a greater reduction in blood pressure and restored blood pressure to normal in a larger percentage of patients in both low-renin (59 per cent) and normal-renin (32 per cent) subgroups than propranolol (12 and 16 per cent). Renin determinations are of limited benefit in the choice of therapy for most patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "12": "The maturation of Xenopus laevis ovocytes was performed after 15 hrs. exposure to progesterone (1 mug/ml). Similar results were obtained following a treatment of ovocytes with pharmacological agents such as propranolol and related drugs, at 5 X 10(-4) to 10(-2) M concentrations. Sotalol was totally ineffective at the same concentrations. The former drugs, and not sotalol, are supposed to interact within the membrane with some calcium sites, translocation of the ion inside being then produced. These results suggest a first interaction of the steroid hormone with membrane calcium sites and possible role of this ion in the maturational events.", 
    "13": "In morphinized rabbits blood lactate levels are elevated. Hyperlactacidemia persists after cessation of morphine injections. This morphine-induced lactate accumulation is completely abolished by simultaneous propranolol treatment. Phentolamine does not modify the action of morphine.", 
    "14": "The effect of infusion of the angiotensin II antagonist P113 on blood-pressure (B.P.) has been studied in 10 patients with various forms of hypertension under four different conditions: before and after salt depletion and with or without propranolol treatment. The fall in B.P. after P113 infusion significantly correlated with log P.R.A. (plasma-renin activity), irrespective of diagnosis or treatment. P113 infusion caused a consistent fall in B.P. only after sodium depletion. The changes in B.P. after P113 infusion and those induced by propranolol correlated only during sodium depletion, when P.R.A. values rose. It is concluded that sodium depletion induced \"renin dependency\" of B.P. in all patients. The decrease in B.P. renin dependency after propranolol therapy suggests that suppression of P.R.A. is one of the antihypertensive mechanisms underlying the action of this drug.", 
    "15": "The prescribing of anxiolytics is often a hit-and-miss process. Current knowledge is examined to encourage a more rational use of such drugs. Because the common symptoms occur in a great array of illnesses, diagnosis is of first importance. For the transient situational disturbance drugs may be unnecessary or may be used merely for a day or two. If the anxiety state persists for a month or so the illness might be termed an anxiety neurosis and if there is no accompanying depression, a short course of benzodiazepine may be of value. With depression present to more than a mild degree as part of the neurosis the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin usually achieves better results than a benzodiazepine. Imipramine can be helpful for the phobic anxiety syndrome and monoamine-oxidase inhibitors can be of separate utility. If the anxiety and depression occur in the context of alcoholism, thioridazine and amitriptyline have certain advantages. There is very little place for phenothiazines or other antipsychotic agents in low doses in the therapy of anxiety except for thioridazine in the above indication.", 
    "16": "The effects of quinidine and propranolol, singly and in combination, on certain electrophysiological responses were studied in open-chest dogs. Parameters measured were the diastolic threshold, conduction time, excitability and functional refractory period of canine right ventricular muscle. Potentiation was judged to have occurred if the combination of a half-dose of quinidine plus a half-dose of propranolol produced a significantly greater response than the full dose of either quinidine or propranolol. Two combinations were employed in this study: combination I contained 2.5 mg/kg of quinidine plus 0.1 mg/kg of propranolol while combination II contained 5.0 mg/kg of quinidine plus 0.2 mg/kg of propranolol. Results of the study indicated that combination II potentiated the activity of quinidine and propranolol to depress excitability, increase conduction time and prolong refractoriness. However, combination I only potentiated the change in refractory state. Neither combination potentiated the individual drug action to increase the diastolic threshold. From the results of this study, it may be concluded that the combination was especially effective in prolonging ventricular refractoriness which may account to a significant degree for the enhanced therapeutic effectiveness of the combination in resistant ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "17": "Fine structural alterations were investigated in cells of the pars intermedia of the pituitary of mice treated for four weeks with (a) a sodium deficient diet, (b) a sodium deficient diet mixed with propranolol (renin-inhibitor), (c) a sodium deficient diet combined with propranolol and amino-glutethimide (corticosterone 18-hydroxylase inhibitor), and (d) a sodium deficient diet combined with propranolol, aminoglutethimide and dexamethasone. The number of secretory granules decreased from 5.0/mum2 in the normal control of 2.4/mum2 in all four experimental groups suggesting that the cells in treated groups had reached an equilibrium in the production and release of secretory granules during the chronic treatments. The number of immature Golgi granules per unit Golgi area was 0.91 in the control, while this value rose to 3.29 (3.62 fold of the control), 4.37 (4.8 fold), 4.94 (5.43 fold) and 5.16 (5.67 fold) respectively in the four experimental groups. In these groups a good correlation was observed between the number of immature granules and the percent volume of rough endoplasmic reticulum (r=0.985, p less than 0.01). The present study suggests that the pars intermedia contains an unidentified pituitary factor (or factors) essential for aldosterone biosynthesis.", 
    "18": "The dog kidney blood flow and filtrative and reabsorptive functions were studied with the aid of electromagnetic flowmeter and endogenic creatinine. Beta-adrenostimulation with izadrine caused dilatation of the kidney vessels. Beta-adrenoblockade led to the opposite though insignificant effect. Beta-adrenostimulation in intact animals entailed systemic hypotension, activation of the kidney blood flow and reabsorption, decrease of filtration and diuresis. Following stabilization of arterial pressure or central inhibition of vasopressin, the beta-adrenostimulation led to the decrease in reabsorption. The data obtained seem to indicate that the direct effect of beta-adrenostimulation of the kidney channels is manifested by the inhibition of reabsorption.", 
    "19": "1 The metabolism and the accumulation of (+/-)-propranolol have been studied in isolated lungs of the rat, perfused with an artificial medium. 2 Little or no metabolism took place during the perfusion periods (up to 10 minutes). 3 Accumulation was observed with high tissue/medium ratios for substrate concentrations of 0.2 muM to 1 mM; there was evidence for saturability, but no real plateau could be seen. The presence of two binding sites with different affinities was established. 4 Cold greatly inhibited the accumulation process at low substrate concentrations, but had no effect at 1 mM propranolol. 5 Inhibition of accumulation was measured in the presence of imipramine, desmethylimipramine, nortryptiline, chlorpromazine and of Na+-free medium. Cocaine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and noradrenaline had no effect. Lidocaine enhanced the accumulation process. Release of previously bound propranolol was accelerated in the presence of propranolol and imipramine, unaffected by a Na+-free medium and decreased by cold and by lidocaine. 6 Experiments on lung tissue slices yielded qualitatively similar results to those obtained with perfused lungs. Ouabain and KCN had no or little effect on propranolol accumulation.", 
    "20": "1 Adenosine, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), adenine, inosine and guanosine all caused concentration-dependent relaxations of guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle in vitro. The relative potencies in descending order were: adenine greater than or equal to guanosine greater than inosine greater than or equal to adenosine greater than or equal to ATP. 2 Responses to the purine compounds were unaffected by propranolol (1 mug/ml). 3 The spasmolytic potencies of adenosine and ATP were greatly enhanced in the presence of the adenosine uptake blocking drugs dipyridamole, hexobendine or Dilazep, whereas responses to adenine were unaffected and those to inosine and guanosine were reduced. 4 The spasmolytic potencies of noradrenaline, aminophylline, prostaglandin E2 and glyceryl trinitrate were unaffected by dipyridamole, hexobendine and Dilazep. 5 It is suggested that an adenosine uptake process may exist in the trachea of the guinea-pig and that this process is inhibited by dipyridamole, hexobendine and Dilazep.", 
    "21": "We have examined the haemodynamic effects of 0.8% trichloroethylene and 1% halothane anaesthesia in a control group of five dogs, chronically implanted with cardiovascular flow- and pressure-measuring apparatus and compared them with a similar group of six dogs pretreated for 3 weeks with oral propranolol (20 mg/kg/day). The effects of graded haemorrhage of 25% of the estimated blood volume and re-transfusion were studied. Cardiovascular function was satisfactory at all stages of the study except during trichloroethylene anaesthesia in the beta-blocked dogs when the response to blood loss was impaired severely. Therefore the use of trichloroethylene in the presence of propranolol may not be advisable in clinical practice.", 
    "22": "Beta-adrenergic blockade may impair the normal cardiovascular response to hypoxia occurring during general anaesthesia. The haemodynamic effects of acute hypoxia, induced by a 90-s period of ventilation with nitrogen, were studied during increasing depths of halothane anaesthesia up to a maximum of 2.5% inspired halothane in dogs chronically implanted with intracardiac catheters, a left-ventricular pressure transducer and an aortic blood flow transducer. An untreated group of dogs and a group which had been treated for 3 weeks with propranolol 20 mg/kg/day were compared. The beta-blocked group had lesser cardiac output values, left-ventricular contractility indices, external left-ventricular work and peak left-ventricular power at all depths of anaesthesia except 2.5% halothane, but both groups responded to hypoxia similarly at each depth of anaesthesia. Cardiac performance was enhanced in both groups during acute hypoxia. No adverse haemodynamic effect of the combination of propranolol, halothane and hypoxia was demonstrated.", 
    "23": "The effects of propranolol, given by direct intraarterial injection, on the reflex vasodilatation induced in the atropinized isolated gracilis muscle by rapid intravenous administration of norepinephrine, were studied in dogs. In these studies, both atropine and atropine plus propranolol did not significantly alter the maximum fall in vascular resistance in the perfused gracilis muscle following intravenous norepinephrine; however, if the reflex responses were evaluated as integrated areas of vasodilatation, atropine attenuated the vasodilatation and the administration of propranolol further attenuated the reflex. In fact, the value of the integrated areas of vasodilatation was 52.8 +/- 9 mmHg/min in the basal state, 39 +/- 6 mmHg/min after administration of atropine, and 24 +/- 7 mmHg/min after propranolol, whereas the integrated areas of the systemic hypertension did not show any modification. These results prompt us to conclude that the adrenergic beta receptors participate in the reflex vasodilatation, although the mechanism of their action needs further elucidation.", 
    "24": "In children with reflux nephropathy renin-dependent hypertension may develop. Two girls with reflux nephropathy, hypertension, elevated plasma renin activity, but normal (Case I) and near normal (Case 2) serum creatinines are described. These cases suggest that reflux nephropathy can activate the renin-angiotensin system and that the renin inhibitors, methyldopa and propranolol, an useful in managing this type of hypertension.", 
    "25": "Arteriolar responses were measured on the cerebral surface of the mouse using an image splitter and TV monitor. The response to locally applied norepinephrine (NOR) was significantly more frequent for vessels greater than 30 mu I.D. than for smaller vessels. However, even the smaller vessels were frequently constricted by NOR in doses of 5 mug per milliliter. Reserpine (5 mg per kilogram) failed to alter the response to NOR at either 24 or 72 hours after reserpinization. At 48 hours the threshold dose of NOR was reduced, but the effect was slight (two-tailed, P = 0.08). Both propranolol (10(-6) M3 and phentolamine (10(-5M) blocked responses to 5 mug per milliliter of NOR, but neither agent altered resting arteriolar diameter. Isoproterenol, tyramine, and histamine had no effect. Serotonin (5HT) constricted the arterioles but did not potentiate the response to NOR. Additive or potentiated effects were not observed with NOR 5HT or histamine in any combination. These data indicate the presence of alpha-adrenergic receptors in murine cerebral surface arterioles, but do not establish a significant tonic effect of norepinephrine. The existence or role of a beta-receptor in these murine cerebral surface arterioles remains an unsettled question.", 
    "26": "Based on determinations of plasma (T-1824)(PV) and extracellular fluid volumes (82Br- distribution space) (ECFV), the PV/IF ratio (IF=ECFV.PV) was calculated three times with a 1-week interval between determinations in untreated patients with essential hypertension. During treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (13 males and 8 females), hydrochlorothiazide-triamterne (5 males and 5 females), hydrochlorothiazide-alpha-methyldopa (7 males and 4 females), and propranolol (6 males and 4 females), PV/IF was determined after 2 to 6 months of treatment. PV/IF was significantly reduced during hydrochlorothiazide treatment (delta PV/IF:--0.011, S.D.: 0.011, p is less than 0.001) and propranolol treatment (delta PV/IF:--0.017, S.D.: 0.022, p is less than 0.05), remained unchanged during hydrochlorothiazide-triamterene treatment and increased significantly during hydrochlorothiazide-alpha-methyldopa treatment (deltaPV/IF: .013, S.D.: 0.015, p is less than 0.05). There was a negative correlation between PV/IF and mean blood pressure during hydrochlorothiazide treatment (r:--0.49, n: 21, p is less than 0.05 (and hydrochlorothiazide-triamterene treatment (r:--0.79, n: 10, p is less than 0.01), whereas no correlation was found during treatment with hydrochlorothiazide-alpha-methyldopa or propranolol. Correlation between mean blood pressure and the individual volumes was not observed nor was there any correlation between changes in the parameters investigated. It is concluded that PV/IF is more accurately correlated to mean blood pressure than are the individual volumes and that, during long-term antihypertensive treatment, PV/IF will reflect changes in the tone of the capacitance vessels and the venous resistance vessels, resulting in a changed equilibrium between the intravascular and the interstitial volumes. It is suggested that the reduction in PV/IF during thiazide and propranolol therapy is related to a relative increase in venoconstrictor sympathetic activity whereas the increase in PV/IF by alpha-methyldopa is caused by decreased sympathetic tone and venodilation.", 
    "27": "A study has been made of the alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors in the guinea pig colon and the mouse caecum using noradrenalina as agonist and alpha- and beta-adrenolytics separately or together. In the guinea pig colon alpha-adrenolytics used alone did not alter the action of noradrenalin: one beta-lytic (propranolol) used alone has slight non dose-dependent action. The alpha-lytics used together with beta-lytic strongly potential their effect. These results are interpreted as indicating that the preparation contains alpha-receptors as well as beta-receptors; activation of the alpha-receptors is observed only when the beta-mimetic effect of noradrenalin is inhibited. In the mouse caecum alpha-lytics prove devoid of effect either alone or when associated with beta-lytics; it is deduced therefore that this preparation contains only beta-receptors.", 
    "28": "The activity of type A right atrial vagal receptors was recorded from the right cervical vagus in cats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, immobilized with gallamine, and with their chests open. Nerve impulses initiated by receptor activation were recorded simultaneously with instantaneous right atrial pressure and dimensional changes under various hemodynamic conditions. Atrial volume changes induced by infusion of saline, bleeding, and occlusion of the inferior vena cava did not alter consistently the systolic activity of the receptors. Electrical stimulation of the right stellate ganglion significantly increased the frequency of discharge during systole, whereas electrical stimulation of the left thoracic vagus significantly reduced the frequency of discharge. These inotropic interventions produced similar effects when the heart was paced at a fixed rate. Pacing the right atrial appendage increased the systolic discharge of the receptors only when at high rates the atrium contracted against closed atrioventricular valves. To investigate the influence of tonic efferent sympathetic activity on spontaneous receptor discharge, three receptors were studied before and after bilateral surgical stellectomy, and in cats with their chest closed three receptors were studied before and after infusion of propranolol. Both of these interventions markedly reduced the systolic activity. In addition to having effects on systolic activity, injection of saline, vagal stimulation, and sympathetic \"denervation\" always activated the receptors during filling. Our results indicate that: (1) the systolic discharge of type A receptors is a function of the active tension developed by atrial muscle during contraction; and (2) the pattern of discharge of the receptors during the atrial cycle depends on both the degree of atrial distention and the state and extent of contraction.", 
    "29": "Thirty-eight starved cats, anesthetized with pentobarbital (Nembutal) sodium, received enteral administration of oxygen and other gases; the effect on intestinal motility as expressed by electrical activity was measured. Oxygen caused a notable increase in amplitude and frequency of slow electrical waves, while carbon dioxide and nitrogen caused no visible alterations. Phentolamine hydrochloride and propranolol hydrochloride together with atropine sulfate decreased the amplitude and frequency of oscillations to near zero; subsequent administration of enteral oxygen caused a notable increase in electrical activity, while enteral carbon dioxide produced no alterations. On the basis of our previous observations that enteral oxygen enhances oxygen and blood delivery to the gut wall, we suggest that the rise in stomach and intestinal electrical activity during enteral oxygen administration in conditions of surgical stress may be associated with an increase in oxygen and blood delivery to the gut wall.", 
    "30": "In a patient with a normal electrocardiogram, normal treadmill exercise test, normal coronary arteriogram and no symptoms to suggest angina pectoris, continuous monitoring during several days exhibited repetitive (one to two per hour) S-T segment elevations in the precordial electrocardiographic leads and hemodynamic changes typical of Prinzmetal's angina (reduction in arterial pressure and cardiac index and increase in systemic peripheral resistance and pulmonary wedge pressure). This case demonstrates that electrical and dynamic cardiac alterations of Prinzmetal's angina can occur even in the absence of angina pectoris.", 
    "31": "Propranolol administered i.v. to spastic patients was found to be capable of depressing clonus. The drug exerts its action on the spinal cord but does not influence dynamic spindle activity or alpha-motoneurone activity as tested by the T (Achilles tendon) and H reflexes. It may disinhibit the tonic stretch reflex. Thus, clonus is dependent not only on dynamic spindle activity but also on another, probably inhibitory, mechanism.", 
    "32": "The presence of a dopamine-specific receptor that can influence intraocular pressure in the rabbit eye is suggested by these experiments: intravitreal, systemic, or topically administered dopamine solutions can produce a decrease in intraocular pressure that is dose-dependent. In high doses the decrease in intraocular pressure is accompanied by mydriasis, and alpha-adrenergic pupillary response. This alpha-response may be caused by dopamine as a direct, but weak alpha-stimulator or by displacement of norepinephrine onto the receptor from its storage site. At lower doses the decrease in intraocular pressure occurs in the absence of mydriasis and in spite of blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors. Further, a specific dopaminergic blocker, haloperidol, prevents this decrease in intraocular pressure. The decreases are small, but reproducible and suggest that dopamine can influence the adrenergic regulation of intraocular pressure.", 
    "33": "The data from this study document that dobutamine is a powerful inotropic agent in anesthetized dogs with acute myocardial ischemia and in awake, unsedated ones with chronic myocardial infarction. Dobutamine significantly increases heart rate at relatively small doses in anesthetized dogs with acute myocardial ischemia but considerably larger amounts of dobutamine are required to significantly increase heart rate in awake, unsedated dogs with myocardial infarction. Dobutamine also significantly increases regional myocardial blood flow to all areas of the heart at 20mug/kg/min in both anesthetized dogs with acute myocardial ischemia and awake, unsedated ones with myocardial infarction. However, in anesthetized dogs 20mug/kg/min of dobutamine significantly increases epicardial ST-segment elevation during acute myocardial ischemia. Propranolol prevents the inotropic and chronotropic effects of dobutamine in both anesthetized and awake, unsedated dogs. This study suggests that during experimental acute myocardial ischemia dobutamine given at doses that significantly increase heart rate and contractility may increase the extent of myocardial damage. The data also suggest that this agent should be of value in the setting of severe myocardial depression without associated severe coronary artery disease to increase cardiac contractility at doses that do not markedly alter heart rate. The hemodynamic and coronary blood flow effects of dobutamine in patients with and without severe coronary artery disease should be evaluated.", 
    "34": "The effect of i.v. infusion of a beta-adrenergic stimulant, salbutamol on blood insulin, glucose, lactate, phosphates, potassium and NEFA was studied in 9 normal subjects. The effect of the drug on the blood sugar and insulin response to i.v. glucose was also examined in 4 subjects. Salbutamol was followed by increases in insulin, glucose and lactate, and a fall in blood phosphorus and potassium. NEFA values did not change significantly. These effects of salbutamol were abolished by propranolol and may thus be attributed to its beta-adrenergic stimulating action. Salbutamol also induced a reduction in glucose tolerance, in spite of the presence of enhanced blood insulin levels.", 
    "35": "1. The effects of the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitors bupicamide, fusaric acid, FLA-63 and U-14,624 on blood pressure and heart rate of spontaneously hypertensive rats were examined. 2. Bupicamide and fusaric acid caused marked tachycardia whereas FLA-63 and U-14,624 caused modest bradycardia; all drugs decreased blood pressure. 3. In normotensive rats, fusaric acid caused the same degree of tachycardia as in spontaneously hypertensive rats, but blood pressure was only slightly reduced. 4. Tachycardia after fusaric acid was not due to increased sympathetic activity or decreased parasympathetic activity but required intact catecholamine stores. 5. It is concluded that fusaric acid causes tachycardia by releasing catecholamines indirectly and that a metabolite of fusaric acid is also involved.", 
    "36": "Two tests of stimulation: insulin + arginine and propranolol + glucagon were successively performed in 62 children who were either normal or had essential growth retardation. Average peak value was 10.6 +/- 1.1 ng/ml in the first test and 22.8 +/- 1.4 ng/ml in the second. In 56 cases the response obtained with propranolol + glucagon was higher than that obtained with insulin + arginine. Twenty-four false negative results were obtained employing insulin + arginine, stimulation by propranolol + glucagon resulting in normal values. The determination of the confidence interval at 95% and of the 3rd percentile did not allow to establish the lower threshold for the insulin + arginine test. For the propranolol + glucagon test 7.6 ng/ml for the interval at 95% and 8 ng/ml for 3rd percentile were found as minimal threshold. Therefore, a response below 8 ng/ml should be considered as pathological with the latter test.", 
    "37": "In the cat anterior tibialis muscle preparation dopamine produces a decrease on indirectly evoked twitch contraction when it is administered intraarterially but not on intravenous injection. Edrophonium (0.3 mg/kg) exerts only a brief antagonism to the dopamine-induced inhibition. The phenothiazine derivative, chlorpromazine (CPZ, 400 mug/kg) which possesses both alpha and dopaminergic blocking properties significantly reduces the action of dopamine on skeletal muscle. However, phentolamine (1 mg/kg), an alpha adrenergic blocker is without effect, possibly indicating that the dopaminergic blocking characteristic of CPZ is responsible for decreasing the action of dopamine. A more selective dopaminergic blocking agent, pimozide (100 and 200 mug/kg) is an effective antagonist to the paralysis caused by dopamine on the anterior tibialis muscle. The results of this investigation suggests the possibility that a dopaminergic receptor may be present in or on skeletal muscle.", 
    "38": "The chronotropic effects of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) were studied in spontaneously beating rabbit atria. Low concentrations of DMSO (0.14, 0.42 M) produced slight positive chronotropic (+C) responses; 0.84 and 1.41 M DMSO caused significant negative chronotropic (--C) responses. All concentrations decreased contractile strength. Atropine sulphate (10)-7) to 10(-5) M) antagonized the chronotropic effects, but not the inotropic effects. In the presence of atropine all DMSO concentrations produced significant +C responses. Reserpine pretreatment or propranolol did not affect contractile responses to DMSO in the absence or presence of atropine. DMSO produced concentration-dependent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of atrial homogenates. The results indicate that the --C responses are due specifically to AChE inhibition by DMSO and resulting cholinergic influences on the atrial pacemaker. Adrenergic mechanisms do not appear to mediate the +C responses. Data presented here provide evidence that a cardioactive effect of DMSO is mediated by a well-defined receptor-linked mechanism, and that this effect can be modified by a specific receptor blocking agent.", 
    "39": "The stimulation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic processes by epinephrine, phenylephrine and isoproterenol increases the hydrochloric acid and gastric juice secretion (as well as the secretion of gastric juice components is decreased under the influence of the alpha-adrenergic blocking agents dehydrobenzperidol and beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol. However, propranolol essentially reduces the acid components secretion not affecting greatly the alkaline components secretion of the patients with a high basal secretion. As a result the P/NP-ration is decreased.", 
    "40": "The ocular side-effects of prolonged practolol administration concern the cornea and conjunctiva and are related to deficient tear secretion and the formation of an autoantibody which has an affinity for the intercellular zones of squanmous epithelium. Histopathological study of six cases, including a review of the necropsy findings in two, showed destruction of lacrimal gland tissue, epidermalization of the conjunctival epithelium, with epitheliolysis and stromal ulceration of the cornea leading to perforation in two patients. Immunoperoxidase studies showed fixation of specific antibody in the corneal and conjunctival epithelium but, in the one case in which the tissue could be adequately studied, complement fixation could not be demonstrated. Possibly, therefore, the immune response in patients with practolol-induced ocular damage is secondary to the epithelial disturbance rather than its cause.", 
    "41": "Prolonged isolation of rats resulted in hyperactivity in the open field and a significant increase in 24 hr urinary excretion of MHPG (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol). Exploratory activity of group-housed rats in open field was not associated with raised MHPG excretion, compared with that of rats remaining in home cages. Exposure of group-housed rats to 4 degrees C for 2 hr also increased urinary excretion of MHPG. Pretreatment of isolated rats with dl-, d-propranolol or practolol abolished hyperactivity of isolated rats and reduced MHPG output in these rats and in rats exposed to cold. dl-Propranolol did not reduce activity of group-housed rats in open field or their urinary excretion of MHPG. It is suggested that propranolol may have a selective inhibitory effect on stress-induced increases in noradrenaline turnover.", 
    "42": "In 20 patients with essential hypertension the urinary albumin execretion, glomerular filtration rate (GFR),and renal plasma flow (RPF) were examined before and after antihypertensive treatment. Albumin excretion measured by radioimmunoassay was increased before treatment, and there was a significant fall during treatment. In patients responding well to therapy (diastolic pressure below 100 mm Hg), albumin excretion was significantly lower than in patients responding poorly to therapy. There was a positive correlation between albumin excretion before treatment and diastolic pressure during treatment, indicating that the albumin excretion rate may be used to predict the result of antihypertensive treatment. Patients with excretion rates below 25 mug/min generally respond well to the treatment used. No definite changes in GFR and RPF were found during treatment, and there was no correlation between albumin excretion and GFR and RPF. It is suggested that the increased albumin excretion in essential hypertension is due both to functional and morphological alterations in the glomerulus, namely increased glomerular filtration pressure and vascular damage.", 
    "43": "To evaluate the effect of propranolol on anesthetic requirement, changes in minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of halothane accompanying acute (2 and 10 mg/kg IV) and chronic (200 mg/day orally for 10 days) propranolol administration were determined in dogs. MAC did not change significantly in either case. Beta-adrenergic blockade was achieved with the 2 mg/kg propranolol dose, as indicated by abolition of the pulse rate increase in response to isoproterenol infusion. Isoproterenol itself did not alter MAC. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) at any given level of alveolar halothane were the same before and after chronic propranolol administration. Acute IV administration of propranolol, especially at the 10 mg/kg dose, reduced MAP and increased HR only transiently.", 
    "44": "Bilateral electrolytic lesions of the solitary tract nucleus in control Wistar albino rats as well as in Okamoto rats with spontaneous arterial hypertension caused a considerable rise in the arterial blood pressure. Quantitative comparison of blood pressure rise in normotensive and hypertensive rats demonstrated that the rise in the systolic and mean blood pressure was not significantly different in both groups of animals. However, the rats with spontaneous hypertension reacted, with a greater rise in the diastolic pressure. A characteristic feature observed in the normotensive rats was a high rise in pulse pressure following lesion of the solitary tract nucleus while in the rats with spontaneous hypertension this change was not found. The authors conclude that increased peripheral vascular resistance in the rats with spontaneous hypertension is not due to inhibition or resetting of the baroreceptor reflex.", 
    "45": "There is a need for a safe, inexpensive, and reliable screening test for growth hormone (GH) reserve. Exercise has been utilized for this purpose but false-negative responses (inadequate GH release in non-GH-deficient patients) has limited the effectiveness of this stimulus as a screening test. Beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol) was used to enhance the effect of exercise on GH release. Thirty-two non-GH-deficient children and five GH-deficient children were evaluated. All of the non-GH-deficient children responded to propranolol and exercise with serum GH levels exceeding 7 ng/ml. The peak serum GH levels in the five GH-deficient patients did not exceed 4 ng/ml. Propranolol and exercise appears to be an effective screening test for GH function.", 
    "46": "Acupuncture by electrocautery, moxibustion, at Jen Chung (Go-26) acupoint produces a sympathomimetic effect on the cardiovascular system of dogs under halothane anaesthesia (MAC I). This effect is manifest by significant increase in cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate, mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure while total peripheral resistance is significantly decreased during a two-hour period of observation. Pretreatment with the beta blocker, propranolol, caused a significant decrease in cardiac output, heart rate, mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure while total peripheral resistance is significantly increased. Similar responses were observed when propranolol was administered without moxibustion at Jen Chung (Go-26).", 
    "47": "The management of a patient with Pheochromocytoma is reported. Consideration of pre-operative preparation, hazards of beta-blocking agents in the absence of alpha blockade, potential hazards of butyrophenones, control of arterial blood pressure with sodium nitroprusside and the usefulness of continous pulmonary artery wedge pressure monitoring are discussed.", 
    "48": "Rat and human myometria contract is response to substitution of external Na+ with Li+. This contraction was accompanied by elevation of 45Ca uptake in rat but not human uterus. The lanthanum technique failed to demonstrate elevation of cellular 45Ca in human myometrium by Li+ substitution. It also failed to demonstrate reduction of Li-elevated 45Ca uptake by isoproterenol or drugs considered to inhibit calcium influx, in rat myometrium although these drugs prevented Li-induced contraction. In human myometrium, isoproterenol increased 45Ca uptake. This probably represents increased extracellular calcium binding. Isoproterenol relaxed depolarized human myometrium provided that the external calcium had been removed for 15 minutes.", 
    "49": "Five laboratory dogs were trained to press a response panel to postpone shocks during 1-hr free-operant avoidance conditioning sessions. In addition, each dog was confined in the experimental environment for 1 hr immediately prior to each avoidance session. During these 2-hr sessions, blood pressure and heart rate were monitored continuously from indwelling catheters. After repeated exposure to the schedule, the onset of the avoidance contingency elicited acute increases in systolic and diastolic pressure and heart rate, which were maintained throughout the session. During the preavoidance interval, systolic and diastolic pressure increased gradually while heart rate decreased. Blockade of beta adrenergic receptor activity in these behaviorally-trained dogs by infusions of propranolol was associated with a significant attenuation of the tachycardia normally maintained during avoidance. Beta blockade did not prevent the rise in blood pressure or fall in heart rate during preavoidance. The results are consistent with the view that the cardiovascular pattern sustained during avoidance is mediated by activation of the sympathetic nervous system, but that the progressive change in cardiovascular activity during preavoidance intervals is mediated by other than sympathetic influences.", 
    "50": "The thyroids of primary thyrotoxicosis patients prepared for partial thyroidectomy with propranolol contained much more lymphoid infiltrate than those prepared with carbimazole. No relation was found between the extent of lymphoid infiltrate in the thyroid and the development of postoperative hypothyroidism either between or within the two drug treatment groups. This study has shown that the extent of thyroid infiltrate should not be used as the major factor in predicting hypothyroidism after subtotal thyroidectomy for primary thyrotoxicosis.", 
    "51": "Infusion of catecholamines and pharmacologic blockade were used to demonstrate the presence of an adrenergic receptor system with both alpha and beta components inthe feline cerebral vasculature. For this purpose, the anatomically isolated brain preparation was perfused under controlled constant-pressure conditions to eliminate active autoregulatory changes and passive fluctuations in calculated cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) secondary to alterations of perfusion pressure. Alpha adrenergic activity was demonstrated as substantial cerebral vasoconstriction in response to infusions of l-norepinephrine and epinephrine; cerebral blood flow (CBF) was decreased by mean values of 25% and 29%, respectively, with calculated increases in CVR of 82% and 62%, respectively. Marked reductions in the vasoconstriction produced by these two catecholamines followed the use of the alpha receptor blocking drug, phenoxybenzamine. Isoproterenol consistently produced cerebral vasodilation (mean CVR decrease of 22%), and this vasodilation was blocked during infusion of a specific beta adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol. Histamine vasodilation (mean CBF increase 49%) appeared to be independent of the classic adrenergic mechanisma. The observed responses are explained on the basis of a functionally significant cerebrovascular adrenergic system having high specificity and demonstrating considerable potency. The data also indicate a predominance of alpha over beta adrenergic cerebrovascular reception.", 
    "52": "Maximum exercise heart rate decreases with maturation in the rat as well as in man. The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism(s) which might be responsible for this reduction in max exercise heart rate in the rat. Maximum exercise heart rates were 618 +/- 7 vs. 580 +/- 9 beats/min for the young (5 wk) and mature (19 wk) rats, respectively. Atropine had no effect on max exercise heart rate. Propranolol reduced max heart rate in both groups with the older rats having the lowest value. Resting heart rates were recorded following injections of atropine propranolol, and propranolol plus atropine. Under all conditions, including control, heart rates were lower in the mature rats. Electrical stimulation in situ showed a significant difference in the threshold voltage for stimulation at 600 beats/min: 1.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.1 V for the young and mature rats, respectively. These data suggest that intrinsic changes occur in the myocardium with maturation and the reduction in max exercise heart rate is due to these intrinsic changes as opposed to changes in neural influences.", 
    "53": "The time courses of the heart rate (HR) changes were studied in six healthy male subjects who performed step changes from rest to light dynamic leg exercise (50 W) in the sitting position during a) control, b) parasympathetic blockade (atropine, 2-2.5 mg iv), c) beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 10 mg iv), and d) during combined blockade with both drugs. During the control and beta-blockade experiments all subjects showed an immediate, rapid increase in HR, reaching a peak value after about 10 s, whereafter an equally rapid transient drop by 10-20 beats/min took place reaching the lowest values about 17 s after the onset of work. HR then again increased to reach a steady-state level within 60-90 s. In the atropine experiments this response pattern was not evident at all, whereas in the experiments with combined blockade it could be distinguished to a small, but significant degree. It is concluded that the observed fluctuations of HR at the onset of light dynamic exercise can be explained by a rapid vagal withdrawal, followed by a transient increase in vagal tone.", 
    "54": "Cerebral autoregulation and vasomotor responsiveness to carbon dioxide were measured quantitatively in normal baboons and after intravertebral or intravenous of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol hydrochloride (Inderal). Continuous measurements were made of cerebral blood flow (CBF: measured as bilateral internal jugular venous outflow using an electromagnetic flowmeter), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), arterial Po2 and Pco2 and venous Po2, cerebral arteriovenous oxygen difference and endotracheal Pco2. The autoregulation index (A.I. = deltaCBF/deltaCPP) and the chemical index (C.I.= deltaCBF/deltaPaco2), were used as quantitative measures.", 
    "55": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (japanese strain) have been treated with furosemide, potassium canrenoate or d-l-propranolol. Present results indicate that: 1)furosemide admiinistration, from the 3rd to the 15th week of life, does not prevent the development of hypertension but the blood pressure rises more slowly in treated rats. In the established phase of hypertension furosemide administration produces a decrease in blood pressure; the blood pressure increases rapidly after cessation of the treatment. 2) potassium canrenoate, injected from the 3rd to the 14th week of life, does not prevent the rise in blood pressure.3) d-l-propranolol, administered from the 5th to the 34th week of life, is without effect on the development of hypertension, though it significantly decreases heart rate.", 
    "56": "The antihypertensive actions of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent, prindolol, and of the diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide, were analysed in a double-blind randomized 2 X 2 factorial trial in 16 patients. There were four eight-week phases in which patients received prindolol alone, hydrochlorothiazide alone, prindolol plus hydrochlorothiazide in combination, and no treatment. Both drugs were given in fixed doses: prindolol, 10 mg three times per day; hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg per day. Blood pressure was measured weekly, alternately at the outpatient clinic and at home. Supine mean arterial pressure (MAP) in resting patients fell from 127 mm Hg in the placebo phase to 117 mm Hg with hydrochlorothiazide alone, 116 mm Hg with prindolol alone, and 111 mm Hg with the combination of prindolol and hydrochlorothiazide. (The standard error of difference between treatments was +/-3-58). A mean factorial effect of -7 mm Hg for hydrochlorothiazide (P less than 0-01) and -8 mm Hg for prindolol (P less than 0-01) was obtained, and the two drugs acted in an additive manner. The effects on standing blood pressure in resting patients were similar. No serious side effects were noted.", 
    "57": "The effect of atenolol, a beta adrenoceptor autogonist, on arterial pressure in patients with benign essential hypertension has been investigated. Eighteen patients were started on atenolol, 75 mg/day; the dose was increased at 2-wk intervals to a maximum of 900 mg if tolerated. When the maximum effective dose was determined, each patient was randomly allocated into a double-blind crossover study comparing atenolol and placebo treatments. The mean supine and erect arterial pressures of the 16 patients completing the run-in period were markedly reduced by atenolol therapy. The pretreatment mean (+/-SEM) supine and erect arterial pressures of the 16 patients completing the run-in period (187 +/-4.7/114 +/-2.6 and 182 +/-4.5/115 +/-3.0 mm Hg, respectively) were reduced (150 +/-5.3/97 +/-2.9 and 151 +/-5.9/100 +/-2.7 mm Hg) with atenolol therapy (p less than 0.01). In the crossover study, the mean (+/-SEM) supine arterial pressure after 8 wk of atenolol therapy in 14 patients (144 +/-5.2/89 +/-1.7 mm Hg) was lower (p less than 0.01) than at the end of placebo therapy (163 +/-4.4/105 +/-2.8 mm Hg). Similar reductions in pressure were recorded in the erect position and after exercise. No severe side effects were observed.", 
    "58": "The antihypertensive effect of labetalol, a new alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor inhibiting agent, was studied in 20 patients in a double-blind crossover trial. A dose of 300 mg daily reduced blood pressure only moderately in the supine position, though in the sitting and standing positions the effect was more pronounced. A dose of 600 mg daily produced statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions in blood pressure in all positions studied. The effect on heart rate was small and of significance only in reducing the heart rate increment due to a change in posture. Side effects were mild: only one patient complained of postural dizziness with the higher dose. We conclude that labetalol is useful in the treatment of mild and moderately severe hypertension.", 
    "59": "The mechanism of the hypotensive effect during beta-adrenergic blockade in hypertension was studied in 38 patients with renal or essential hypertension using the new cardioselective beta blocker, Tenormin. During 5 weeks hospitalization the patients received first a placebo for 5 to 12 days, then a 75 mg. dose of Tenormin was given daily for 1 week, and thereafter the dose was doubled weekly as necessary up to 600 mg. daily. The blood pressure decreased from 180 +/- 26.2/118. \"/- 13.6 mm. Hg on placebo to 151 +/-25.5/96 +/-13.8 mm. Hg during the final hospitalization period on Tenormin (600 mg. daily). Six patients developed fluid retention and as this occurred blood pressure control was lost. A subsequent follow-up on an outpatient basis of 15 of the patients showed that when the active drug was replaced by a placebo blood pressure rose again, confirming that the initial fall in blood pressure was a genuine effect. Multistage bicycle ergometer exercise tests were performed at weekly intervals to test the degree of beta blockade and indicated that this was nearly complete when a dose of 600 mg. per day was used. A significant correlation between the hypotensive effect and the degree of beta blockade, assessed by exercise tachycardia, was observed. A slight but statistically significant decrease (26 per cent) was observed in the plasma renin concentration, measured recumbent in the morning. This decrease was, however, not correlated with the hypotensive effect of the drug. Although the cardiac output decreased significantly (from 5.5 +/-1.7 to 4.3 +/- 1.1 L per minute, p less than 0.001), no correlation was found in individual patients between the cardiac output and the blood pressure decrease. On the other hand, for the total group of catheterized patients (n = 28) the calculated total peripheral resistance did not change significantly. Yet a significant correlation was found between the changes in total resistance and the hypotensive effect. This suggests that the reaction of the peripheral vessels rather than the cardiac output decrease determines whether the drug will produce a major decrease of blood pressure in patients with hypertension.", 
    "60": "Studies were carried out with rat epididymal fat pads first to compare the effects of the synthetic N-terminal 1-34 peptide of bovine parathyroid hormone and of the native hormone to determine whether this portion of the molecule is responsible for the lipolytic action of the hormone and second to determine whether this biologic action of parathyroid hormone is mediated by cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. The N-terminal polypeptide was as effective as the native hormone in stimulating lipolysis in the concentration range between 10(-8) M and 10(-6) M. Parathyroid hormone stimulated lipolysis by isolated fat cells. The concentration of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in the fat pads was significantly increased by the hormone (10(-6)M). Lipolytic stimulation by parathyroid hormone (10(-6)M) was diminished by insulin (100 muU/ml) and prostaglandin E1 (1 mug/ml), both of which are known inhibitors of lipolysis. The findings indicate that the amino-terminal 1-34 peptide portion of parathyroid hormone is responsible for the lipolytic action and that this effect is mediated through cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate.", 
    "61": "The sympathetic adrenergic ground plexus of the rat iris is able to innervate whole embryonic hearts transplanted to the anterior eye chamber. The transplants beat continuously from the time of transplantation and for at least five months, initially at 150-200 beats/min, and later approximately 250 beats/min. From seven days postoperatively onwards increased light to the eye produced deceleration while decreased light produced acceleration of the transplants. The rate changes coincided with changes in pupil diameter. Topical atropine reduced the light dependent rate variations of the transplants, especically the dramatic decrease in rate at white light. Waking stress caused a large rate increase. The \"waking-effect\" was strongly reduced by sympathetic decentralization and completely abolished by propranolol. The high rate seen in red light was decreased to the low rate of white light by decentralization. Isoprenaline restored red light rate levels in the decentralized transplant. The intraocular heart thus receives a dual functional autonomic input from the host iris and becomes a sensitive monitor of an autonomic nervous activity that can easily be varied at will in a physiological way by changing the light influx to the eye.", 
    "62": "Eight mongrel dogs exercised for 8 weeks by treadmill running at 20 per cent incline 20 to 25 minutes twice daily, 4-5 days/week. Another eight dogs which were kept in the cages for a similar period served as controls. The exercise program was effective in inducing myocardial hypertrophy since the ratio left ventricular weight/body weight was significantly (P less than 0.001) higher in the trained dogs (5.04 g/kg) than in the sedentary animals (3.83 g/kg). In morphine-chloralose anesthesia the dogs were studied by left heart catherization and cineangiography at spontaneous heart rate (run I), at paced heart rate (run II), at paced heart rate following cardiac autonomic nervous blockade by bilateral vagotomy and the administration of propranolol (run III) and during acute pressure loading with methoxzmine at constant heart rate (run IV). Intergroup comparison yielded no significant difference in any hemodynamic or volumetric parameter throughout the entire study. However, with intragroup comparisons between run III and run IV a less significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (from 5 to 15 mm Hg; P less than 0.05) was observed in the trained animals than in the control dogs (from 6 to 25 mm Hg; P less than 0.001). Left ventricular end-diastolic volume increased significantly only in the control dogs during acute pressure loading. Mean aortic pressure and left ventricular peak dP/dt increased to a similar extent in both groups. Since in the trained dogs the left ventricle encroaches less on the Frank-Starling mechanism than in normal animals for overcoming an acute pressure burden it is concluded that the development of hypertrophy concomitant with chronic exercise represents an adaptive mechanism with evidence of beneficial consequences for the intrinsic contractile function of the myocardium.", 
    "63": "Techniques are described for the rapid loading of intact human red cells with radioactive isotopes of alkali cations or Ca2+ by using ionophorous compounds (nigericin, gramicidin D and A 23187). Loading was rapid and efficient if the membrane potential of the cells was rendered more negative inside. After cation loading the ionophores could be bound to albumin and removed by repeated washings. The ATP and 2,3-DPG contents of the cells were practically unaltered by this treatment. Passive membrane permeability to Na+ and Ca2+ returned to normal. Loaded erythrocytes pumped out Na+ in a ouabain-sensitive and Ca2+ in a lanthanum-sensitive way. Ca2+ -loaded red cells were microspherocytes and exhibited a rapid K+ -efflux. Parallel with the extrusion of Ca2+ cells regained their biconcave shape and normal passive permeability to K+.", 
    "64": "In order to evaluate the clinical efficacy on penbutolol (Hoe 893 d), a new adrenergic blocking agent, two groups of 10 patients (A & B) with ischemic heart disease were chosen. These were submitted to exercise testing for 3 minutes, and placebos, nitroglycerin, and propranolol were used as reference preparations. As an index of indirect consumption of oxygen we determined the maximum cardiac frequency (MCF), maximum systolic arterial pressure (MAP) and the maximum double product (MDP). An electrocardiographic control of the patients was also included to observe ST segment changes. The patients from group A received 0.8 mg. of nitroglycerin sublingual as the first treatment and 40 mg. of propranolol as the second. The patients from group B received initially a placebo P.O. and then 25 mg. of penbutolol P.O. In both groups the exercise testing was repeated 10 minutes after the administration of the first substance and 10 minutes after the second. The results showed that 25 mg. of penbutolol and 40 mg. of propranolol have similar therapeutic effects over the degree, intensity, and duration of the differences in elevation of the ST segment, MCF, MAP, and MDP when you compare the results of their own controls with those obtained with the active principle. There is no significant difference observed in the results obtained in each parameter studied between penbutolol and propranolol. During the period of this clinical study there were no undesirable collateral effects caused by the oral administration of the investigated drugs.", 
    "65": "Increases in plasma noradrenaline were found in a group of 12 subjects smoking cigarettes. The associated rises in pulse rate, blood pressure and plasma free fatty acids could be prevented by beta-blockade with oxprenolol. This inhibition of the peripheral effects of catecholamines did not affect subjective satisfaction, indicating that central effects or other rewards are more important reinforcers. It is suggested that noradrenaline release in the hypothalamus is the final common pathway to pleasure in many situations, including smoking.", 
    "66": "1. An in vivo stathmokinetic technique was used to determine the immediate effect of various adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on the mitotic rate in the stratified squamous epithelium of the rat buccal mucosa. 2. The mitotic rate increased significantly in rats treated with propranolol and with practolol, whereas the mitotic rate decreased significantly in rats treated with metaraminol. In animals treated with isoprenaline and phentolamine the mitotic rate did not differ significantly from the control value. 3. The nature of the involvement of adrenergic mechanisms with cell proliferation is still uncertain but both alpha- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms appear to be associated with the control of cell proliferation."
