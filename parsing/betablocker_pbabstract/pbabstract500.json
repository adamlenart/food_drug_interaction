    "0": "Sixty-five patients with symptomatic, drug-refractory, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation were treated with oral sotalol (80 to 480 mg twice daily). Sotalol was withdrawn in 11 patients because of continued inducibility of ventricular tachycardia at the time of follow-up electrophysiologic study. Therefore, the clinical effectiveness of sotalol could be evaluated in 54 patients followed up for 11.5 +/- 6 months (range 0.2 to 25). The actuarial incidence of successful sotalol therapy was 54 +/- 13% at 6 months and 47 +/- 13% at 12 months. In 39 patients who underwent electrophysiologic testing while receiving oral sotalol, the drug prevented the reinduction of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation in 8 (20%). During follow-up study, arrhythmia recurred in 1 (17%) of 6 patients whose ventricular tachycardia was noninducible with oral sotalol and in 8 (44%) of 18 with inducible tachycardia but who were continued on oral sotalol therapy. Adverse effects were noted in 28 patients (42%), requiring drug withdrawal in 13 (22%) and dose reduction after hospital discharge in 10 (15%). Exacerbation of ventricular arrhythmia occurred in six patients (9%), one of whom had associated hypokalemia. Sotalol is frequently useful in the control of intractable, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and its efficacy appears to be predicted by programmed stimulation. However, there is a high rate of limiting side effects, which precludes its use in a large number of patients, and a substantial risk of arrhythmia exacerbation.", 
    "1": "Drugs reported to reduce portal pressure through different mechanisms were combined in the hope of either additive portal hypotensive effects in \"responders,\" or inducing a portal hypotensive effect in \"nonresponders\" to the initial drug. Seven patients with alcoholic cirrhosis received verapamil, 10 mg i.v., and, 60 min later, ketanserin, 5 mg i.v. Verapamil decreased heart rate and increased free hepatic venous pressure but had no effect on hepatic venous pressure gradient or azygos blood flow. When combined with verapamil, ketanserin significantly diminished wedged hepatic venous pressure and hepatic venous pressure gradient. Ten other patients with alcoholic cirrhosis received propranolol, 15 mg i.v., and 45 min later, ketanserin, 5 mg i.v. In all patients, heart rate, cardiac index and azygos blood flow significantly decreased after propranolol. After propranolol alone, however, wedged hepatic venous pressure decreased in only five patients, responders. In five other patients, defined as nonresponders, propranolol did not decrease this pressure. The addition of ketanserin to propranolol induced further significant reduction in wedged hepatic venous pressure, hepatic venous pressure gradient and azygos blood flow. Among the five nonresponders, three had a reduced wedged hepatic venous pressure after ketanserin was combined. We conclude that verapamil does not reduce portal pressure or collateral blood flow in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The splanchnic hemodynamic effects of propranolol and ketanserin appear to be independent and additive, without significant systemic alteration.", 
    "2": "The case is reported of a 42 year old female patient with Graves disease who presented with an atypical thyroid storm after subtotal thyroidectomy. Surgery was indicated because of poor patient compliance with the medical treatment, and its partial failure. High doses of propranolol (240 mg a day) were given for 5 days preoperatively. Anaesthesia and surgery were uneventful however, towards the end of the first postoperative day, a severe myopathic syndrome started, with neither fever nor tachycardia. Respiratory failure and pneumonia occurred 24 h later. This was deemed to be due to an atypical thyroid storm. The patient was intubated and ventilated, and treated with high doses of propranolol (320 mg a day). Muscle strength began returning to normal on the 4th postoperative day, being completely normal 2 months later. Even though a particularly severe form of thyrotoxic myopathy appeared to be the most likely cause of this temporary muscle disorder, beta-blockers may have been involved. Their potential role is discussed.", 
    "3": "In this study we evaluated the possibility of initiating long-lasting ventricular tachycardias acutely, using isolated porcine hearts and thus avoiding an open-chest operation model. This set-up was designed especially to investigate defibrillating or antitachycardiac pacing devices, which terminate these malignant arrhythmias if medical treatment fails. The experiments were performed on 42 pigs, weighing 20-25 kg. After thoracotomy their hearts were removed and adapted to a Langendorff perfusion system. Supplied with their own blood, beating hearts were manipulated in three different ways: direct current impulses (4.5 V, 750 ms) or programmed ventricular stimulation, creation of a small myocardial infarction, and application of antiarrhythmic drugs (ajmalin, lidocaine, sotalol). Out of all possibilities the combination of ajmalin (mean concentration 0.041 micrograms/ml) and a small anteroapical myocardial infarction (3-6 cm2) along with direct current impulses (4.5 V), led to sustained ventricular tachycardias in the highest proportion (93%) of trials (P less than 0.001). The heart rate was 251 beats per minute on average. Lidocaine trials were less successful (53%), while programmed ventricular stimulation and sotalol failed to induce ventricular tachycardias. This study supports the evidence that the combination of ajmalin and a small myocardial infarction with direct current impulses is a reliable model for sustained ventricular tachycardias in isolated pig hearts. Although it is a rather artificial organ model, tachycardias can be induced acutely without any long-term pretreatment. Animal models based on chronic myocardial infarctions will therefore be unnecessary for the investigation of defibrillating systems and antitachycardiac pacing devices.", 
    "4": "The effect of agonists and antagonists of alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors on mechanical properties of the smooth muscle was studied in the isolated muscle strips of the human umbilical artery and vein. Noradrenaline was shown to cause the contraction of smooth muscles of the umbilical vein. Tonic and phase components in the contraction process were observed. Isoprenaline caused tonic contraction of the muscle strip. Phentolamine, and alpha-adrenoblocker did not inhibit the stimulating activity of noradrenaline. In presence of obsidane (beta-adrenoblocker) noradrenaline triggered the contraction with lesser tonic component as compared to the initial one. So the selective stimulation of beta-adrenoreceptors of smooth muscles of the umbilical vein by isoprenaline and blocking of the same receptors by obsidane have proved that activation of alpha-adrenoreceptors is responsible for the phasic component of contraction, while that of beta-adrenoreceptors--for the tonic component of contraction. As both alpha- and beta-adrenoblockers in smooth muscles of the umbilical artery inhibit the noradrenaline-induced contraction, it was concluded that the differentiation of adrenoreceptors of the vessel is rather low.", 
    "5": "Forty-six orthopedic patients were studied to determine the incidence, natural history, and risk factors associated with post-operative delirium. Pre-operatively, patients were given a neuropsychological screening evaluation, the Mood Adjective Checklist (MACL), the Zung Depression Scale, the Anxiety Inventory Scale, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). A psychiatrist interviewed each patient on post-op day four for evidence of delirium as defined by DSM III criteria. Of the patients studied, thirteen (26%) were possibly or definitely delirious following surgery. Treatment with propranolol, scopolamine, or flurazepam (Dalmane) conferred a relative risk for delirium of 11.7 (p = 0.0028). Delirium was associated with increased post-operative complications (p = 0.01), poorer post-operative mood (p = 0.06), and an increase of about 1.5 days in length of stay (not significant). Delirious patients were significantly less likely than matched controls to improve in function at six months compared with a pre-operative baseline HAQ (t = 6.43, p less than 0.001).", 
    "6": "Selected patients with variceal bleeding were randomly assigned to either weekly injection sclerotherapy (n = 56) or to oral propranolol (n = 52). During follow-up, 28 (54%) of the propranolol group and 25 (45%) of the sclerotherapy group had an episode of rebleeding. The long term risks of bleeding in the propranolol and sclerotherapy groups were 0.05 and 0.037 bleeds/patient-month, respectively, and the corresponding death rates during follow-up were 42 and 38%. There were no statistically significant differences between propranolol and the established therapy, but it was concluded that if propranolol is used in the prevention of rebleeding, it must be part of an overall approach that provides for the management of active variceal haemorrhage by other means if this condition continues.", 
    "7": "The fine structure of the parathyroid glands of propranolol-treated hamsters subjected to 5 x gravity environment was studied. In the parathyroid glands of the propranolol-treated hamsters exposed to hypergravity environment, the volume density occupied by the Golgi complexes and cisternae of the granular endoplasmic reticulum was increased as compared to that of propranolol-treated hamsters and was decreased as compared to that of hamsters exposed to a hypergravity environment but was almost similar to that of control hamsters. In addition, many chief cells contained rich free ribosomes, abundant mitochondria and some secretory granules located in the peripheral cytoplasm. These findings suggest that the parathyroid gland which may be suppressed by treatment of propranolol and stimulated in response to a hypergravity environment indicates the secretory activity of the control parathyroid gland.", 
    "8": "The present study examined the interaction of opioidergic systems in the hypotensive action of atenolol. Anesthetized, adult spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were instrumented to monitor blood pressure and heart rate. Atenolol (100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) produced a decrease in blood pressure of similar magnitude in both SHR and WKY rats. However, the bradycardia was greater in SHR. Pretreatment with naloxone (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) 15 min prior to the administration of atenolol completely prevented the hypotensive response in SHR and decreased the maximum hypotensive response by approximately 50% in WKY rats. The atenolol-induced bradycardia was unaffected in both groups of animals. Additionally, pretreatment with yohimbine, an alpha 2-receptor antagonist, inhibited the hypotensive response of atenolol in SHR. Collectively, these results suggest an interaction between opioidergic and catecholaminergic systems as a possible site of action of antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "9": "Penicillamine thiyl radicals, PenS., are shown to abstract hydrogen atoms from 2-propanol and to establish an equilibrium PenS. + (CH3)2 CHOH in equilibrium PenSH + (CH3)2 COH. The rate constants for the forward and back reaction have been determined to (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10(4) and (1.2 +/- 0.3) x 10(8) M-1 s-1, respectively, by means of pulse radiolysis. The data have been obtained from various independent methods which include direct measurements and competitive schemes involving irreversible interception of the alcohol radical by electron acceptors (e.g. CCl4, PNAP) and/or the thiyl radical by antioxidants (e.g. alpha-tocopherol). The results demonstrate that the reaction of carbon-centered radicals with thiols, in radiation biology commonly known as \"repair\" reaction, may be reversed and thus imply the possibility of thiyl radical induced biological damage.", 
    "10": "1. Daily injection of T3 during three consecutive days dose-dependently enhanced L-5-HTP (4 mg/kg)-induced head-twitches in mice. 2. Pretreatment with a sub-effective dose of T3 (0.06 mg/kg) markedly enhanced the ability of drugs acting mainly on noradrenergic systems (clenbuterol, desipramine, maprotiline and nomifensine) to increase the response to L-5-HTP. 3. In contrast the potentiating effects of T3 were moderate on drugs with mixed action on serotonergic and noradrenergic systems (amitriptyline, clomipramine and imipramine) and minimal on drugs acting mainly on serotonergic systems (citalopram, fluvoxamine and indalpine). 4. These data suggest that the increased responsiveness to L-5-HTP caused by T3 involves an indirect (norepinephrine-mediated) rather than a direct effect on serotonergic processes.", 
    "11": "The plasma concentration of metoprolol was measured hourly following an oral dose on two consecutive days--the day before, and the day of, coronary surgery. No significant difference was found between the two sampling days, though there was a tendency to lower concentrations during and after extracorporeal circulation. After a median dose of 50 mg the peak concentration (reached on average after 1.5 h) was 545 +/- 70 nmol/l on the first day and 388 +/- 57 on the day of surgery. The respective elimination rates from plasma, expressed as half-life, were 3.4 +/- 0.21 and 3.5 +/- 0.19 hours (NS). On the day of surgery the heart rate rose during the second half of the observation period, peaking above 130 beats/min. Heart rate was inversely correlated to metoprolol concentration in plasma with coefficient -0.68 before induction of anesthesia and -0.77 two hours after termination of extracorporeal circulation. The perioperative efficacy of beta-blockade following a late preoperative oral dose of the agent thus appeared to be reduced and inadequate.", 
    "12": "The oxidation of debrisoquine, a sympatholytic antihypertensive agent, exhibits genetic polymorphism. The debrisoquine/4-OH-debrisoquine metabolic ratio (MR) separates the population to poor (PM, MR greater than 12.6) and extensive (EM, MR less than 12.6) metabolizers. 5-10% of the caucasians belong to the PM phenotype. The oxidation of many other drugs, like timolol, correlates with the debrisoquine phenotype. We determined the debrisoquine phenotype in 102 glaucoma patients. The majority of the patients was treated with ophthalmic timolol. Five patients were classified as PMs. However, two of them were on quinidine, a well known inhibitor of debrisoquine oxidation. The prevalence of debrisoquine PM phenotype in glaucoma patients was 2.9% (excluding patients on quinidine) or 4.9% (with patients on quinidine). The figures are slightly lower than the mean value reported for the normal Finnish population. However, both figures lay within the 95% confidence limits of the prevalence of PM phenotype in the normal Finnish population. The beta-blocking activity of oral timolol is increased in PMs. The significance of timolol oxidation phenotype during ocular timolol therapy warrants further investigation.", 
    "13": "The antidiuretic and vasopressor effects of arginine vasotocin (AVT) in bullfrogs have been well documented. However, the direct cardiac stimulatory effects of AVT have not been previously reported. We found that AVT stimulates significant increases in heart rate, pulse pressure, and the maximal time derivative of ventricular pressure in anesthetized bullfrogs after the beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors in the heart were blocked by atropine and propranolol. In spontaneously beating isolated frog atria, AVT increased the beating rate by 20% and the contractile force by 100%. The inotropic effect of AVT was also demonstrated in electrically driven atria and ventricles. Propranolol was ineffective in blocking these cardiac responses in vitro. The Hill coefficients of the concentration-response curves did not differ from unity. In conclusion, AVT possesses both positive chronotropic and inotropic effects in bullfrogs, Rana catesbeiana, probably by direct stimulation of its specific receptors in the heart.", 
    "14": "a./Great regional differences were observed in the vasospastic effect of hemoglobin. Namely, hemoglobin was far more potent in the middle cerebral artery than in the mesenteric artery. b./The role of potassium ions as well as activation of calcium mobilizing adrenergic, serotoninergic and PGF2 alpha smooth muscle receptors were excluded in the mechanism of cerebral vasospasm induced by hemoglobin. c./First in the literature we showed that atropine significantly attenuates the vasospastic effect of hemoglobin, and hemoglobin releases peptidergic neurotransmitters and modulators from nerve terminals that are located in the adventitia of the middle cerebral artery.", 
    "15": "Timolol base was prepared from its maleate salt and checked for purity, pKa (9.03) and n-octanol/phosphate buffer pH 6.6 partition coefficient (1.72). The rate of swelling of sodium carboxymethylcellulose, Carbopol 934 (CP) and hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) was examined prior to use in bioadhesive compacts with the model drug methylene blue to study their influence on device integrity and drug diffusion. A final compact containing a core of timolol base and Precirol, a bioadhesive layer of CP and HPC, and a cap of magnesium stearate gave sustained release of the drug in simulated saliva pH 6.6. After preliminary evaluation in dogs, the compact was evaluated in a panel of humans in whom it was shown that the flux of drug could be increased from 70 to 127 micrograms mm-2 h-1 by inclusion of the penetration enhancer sodium lauryl-sulphate into the core formulation.", 
    "16": "1. To determine whether stimulation of atrial receptors reflexly affects coronary blood flow, experiments were performed in seven dogs anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose. The left upper and middle pulmonary vein-atrial junctions and atrial appendage were stretched by distension of small balloons. Coronary blood flow was measured using an electromagnetic flowmeter positioned around the origin of the left anterior descending or circumflex coronary artery. 2. Following prevention of the reflex increase in heart rate by atrial pacing or propranolol, distension of the small balloons was shown to result in a decrease in mean coronary blood flow. 3. Cooling of the cervical vagosympathetic nerve trunks to 9 degrees C abolished the response of a decrease in mean coronary blood flow to distension of the balloons. 4. The response of a decrease in mean coronary blood flow was abolished by bretylium tosylate. 5. It was shown that a decrease in mean coronary blood flow occurred in response to stimulation of left atrial receptors, and that this decrease was reflex in nature. This reflex response is likely to involve atrial receptors discharging into afferent myelinated vagal fibres, and the efferent limb involves cardiac sympathetic pathways.", 
    "17": "1. The electrical and mechanical activities of different regions of the canine lower oesophageal sphincter were measured using the single sucrose gap technique. 2. Spontaneous electrical activity was found in the region 0-6 mm oral to the squamocolumnar border. 3. The electrical activity consisted of bursts of spikes superimposed on slow waves. The slow-wave frequency ranged from 0.6 to 5 min-1 in different muscle strips. 4. The slow wave-spike complex and associated contraction were insensitive to tetrodotoxin and atropine. 5. In the pacemaker region, electrical stimulation of intrinsic nerves evoked excitatory junction potentials (atropine sensitive), inhibitory junction potentials (non-adrenergic) and post-stimulus excitation. 6. Increase in the frequency of the slow waves was obtained by muscarinic receptor stimulation (carbachol 10(-7) M) and 10 mM-KCl. 7. The distal lower oesophageal sphincter exhibited a high basal tension but did not show spontaneous electrical activity and stimulation of intrinsic nerves revealed only non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic inhibition. 8. The electrical slow-wave activity observed in the proximal sphincter may constitute the control mechanism for the phasic nature of the contractile activity seen during both the postprandial period and phase III of the interdigestive migrating myoelectric complex. 9. The neural cholinergic activity present in the proximal lower oesophageal sphincter suggests the possibility of neural modulation of the myogenic control activity.", 
    "18": "The effects of ethanol, although well studied in the adult myocardium, have been little studied in fetal tissue. Experiments in pregnant animals suggest that ethanol compromises fetal myocardial performance, in utero; however, the physiological mechanism(s) remains obscure. The present report examines, in vitro, the effects of a moderate concentration of ethanol (20 mM) directly on cell membrane potentials and contractility of human fetal left ventricle as determined using intracellular microelectrodes and microforce transducers. We observed significant decreases in action potential amplitude, upstroke velocity, duration of repolarization, and the force of contractions. These effects were reversible. As ethanol crosses the placenta, our findings suggest that moderate concentrations of ethanol, as occur during 'social drinking', may temporarily compromise fetal myocardial performance in utero.", 
    "19": "The M2-cholinoceptor subtype selective antagonist AF-DX 116 was compared with atropine with respect to effects on heart rate and salivary flow in healthy volunteers. These effects were related with in vitro occupancy of M-cholinoceptor subtypes in radioreceptor assays of plasma samples. Radioreceptor assays comprised M1-cholinoceptors in bovine cerebral cortex and M2-cholinoceptors in pig heart and rat salivary gland membranes. 3H-pirenzepine served as a label in the cerebral cortex 3H-N-methyl-scopolamine in the heart and gland preparations. Oral administration of 240 mg AF-DX 116 led to a time dependent increase in heart rate with a maximum effect comparable to atropine 40 micrograms/kg i.v. The effects of both drugs on heart rate were matched by a greater than 80% occupancy of heart M2-cholinoceptors in the radioreceptor assay of plasma samples. In contrast to the complete inhibition of salivary flow after atropine, AF-DX 116 induced an increase of salivation. The effects on salivary flow coincided with a greater than 80% occupancy of glandular M2-cholinoceptors after atropine but no detectable occupancy after AF-DX 116. Occupancy of the M1-subtype amounted to 61.7% after AF-DX 116 and a blockade of inhibitory, presynaptic M1-autoreceptors at missing postsynaptic blockade of glandular M2-cholinoceptors might explain the hypersalivation induced by AF-DX 116.", 
    "20": "Chronic sinoaortic denervation (SAD) performed by section of both carotid and aortic nerves induced a significant and sustained increase in blood pressure and heart rate in conscious dogs; under our experimental conditions, the values of systolic blood pressure and heart rate were never lower than 190 mmHg and 120 beats/min, respectively. The present long-term study (8 mo) investigated the time-course of plasma catecholamine levels and circulating blood cell adrenoceptor (leukocyte beta 2 and platelet alpha 2) number. Catecholamine plasma levels were highly correlated with the variations of leukocyte beta adrenoceptors (measured by [125I]cyanopindolol binding and characterized as a beta 2 receptor in dogs). These two parameters followed a biphasic pattern after SAD: during the first 2 mo, significant increases in noradrenaline and adrenaline levels were associated with a decrease in leukocyte beta 2 adrenoceptor number; from the 4th month, they slowly returned to normal values, although blood pressure remained elevated. By contrast, platelet alpha 2 adrenoceptor number (measured by [3H]yohimbine binding) did not follow this pattern since it remained lower than before SAD during the whole experiment. Finally, the development (but not the maintenance) of SAD-induced hypertension is associated with an increase in sympathetic tone. Only leukocyte beta 2 (and not platelet alpha 2) adrenoceptors are directly regulated by the endogenous levels of catecholamines.", 
    "21": "The cardiac adrenergic system is known to have practically no influence on conduction velocity in the ventricles under normal conditions. The effects of isoproterenol and propranolol were investigated on depression of intraventricular conduction induced by a class IC antiarrhythmic drug, cibenzoline, in anaesthetized, closed-chest dogs. In addition to electrocardiogram for measurement of QRS duration in sinus rhythm, conduction time was measured in the ventricular contractile tissue between an electrode advanced to the apex and a pacing electrode near the base, at 400- and 200-ms pacing periods. Effective refractory period (ERP) was measured concurrently according to the extrastimulus method. After intraventricular conduction had been slowed down by cibenzoline IV administered (loading dose of 3 mg/kg plus infusion of 0.2 mg/kg/min over 15 min), isoproterenol was infused or propranolol injected by the intravenous route also (0.5 mn/micrograms/kg/min over 5 min and 0.4 mg/kg, respectively). When conduction time has been raised by 75/150% (depending on the pacing rate), isoproterenol appears to attenuate and propranolol to aggravate substantially the impairment of conduction, whereas the reduction undergone by ERP does not differ from usual. Thus, reentrant arrhythmias might be prevented by isoproterenol and triggered by propranolol. Intraventricular conduction, when depressed, therefore, is sensitive to adrenergic drugs, probably because of the enhanced influence of polarization of the fibres in the presence of a sodium conductance impairment.", 
    "22": "The therapeutic effects of carteolol hydrochloride were evaluated in the treatment of 44 uveitis patients (51 eyes) with intraocular pressure elevation or secondary glaucoma. Carteolol ophthalmic solutions, either 1% or 2%, were given twice day for more than 4 weeks in glaucomatocyclitic crisis and for more than 8 weeks in other forms of uveitis. Intraocular pressure significantly decreased from week 1 of treatment and persisted within normal limits until week 8 in glaucomatocyclitic crisis. Similarly, intraocular pressure decreased significantly from week 2 in other forms of uveitis. Intraocular pressure was well controlled in patients with open-angle glaucoma, but the control was insufficient in patients with angle-closure glaucoma. No adverse reactions such as systemic hemodynamic effects or exacerbations of intraocular inflammation were observed during this study. Carteolol therefore seems to be effective for the treatment of intraocular pressure elevation and secondary glaucoma associated with endogenous uveitis.", 
    "23": "Lymph flow and lymphatic pressure fluctuations were measured in cannulated popliteal efferent lymphatics of the sheep. Five-minute intra-arterial infusions of norepinephrine (0.4 microgram/kg/min) produced up to fivefold increases in lymph flow and lymphatic contraction frequency. This effect was blocked by the alpha-antagonist phentolamine but not by the beta-antagonist propranolol. Isoproterenol (0.4 microgram/kg/min i.a.) inhibited flow. This effect was antagonized by propranolol. Acetylcholine (0.4 microgram/kg/min) had little effect on lymph flow. Since norepinephrine and isoproterenol respectively stimulate and inhibit lymphatic pumping activity in vitro, it is proposed that the effects of these agents on lymph flow and lymphatic contraction frequency in vivo are best explained by direct modulatory actions on the lymphatic smooth muscle pump.", 
    "24": "A comparative study of the visual functions dynamics has been conducted in 81 glaucomatous patients (105 eyes) with normalized intraocular tension, treated by hypotensive preparations of various mechanisms of action. The groups of the patients were maximum identical by their characteristics. The follow-up period was 2 years. It was found that visual functions remain stable in patients treated by beta-blockers and their combination with pilocarpine, while, in patients treated by pilocarpine and alpha-stimulators the results were worse. The less effective were anticholinesterase preparations and combinations of pilocarpine with adrenaline.", 
    "25": "Ocularly applied timolol eyedrops may cause serious systemic side-effects in some patients. In this study we evaluated the effects of pretreatment with epinephrine and pilocarpine eyedrops on systemic absorption of ophthalmic timolol. Epinephrine decreased the systemic absorption of timolol, while pilocarpine increased the peak concentrations of timolol in plasma. When applied in the same solution with timolol, pilocarpine had no effect and phenylephrine decreased the systemic absorption of timolol. The observed effects were due to the conjunctival and nasal vasoconstricting effects of epinephrine and phenylephrine and to the vasodilating effects of pilocarpine. These pharmacokinetic interactions demonstrate the importance of the conjunctival and nasal blood flow in the systemic absorption of timolol.", 
    "26": "Six healthy volunteers were given single oral doses of 8 mg salbutamol, 40 mg propranolol, 100 mg atenolol, 8 mg salbutamol plus 40 mg propranolol and 8 mg salbutamol plus 100 mg atenolol, in a placebo controlled study. Plasma potassium fell following salbutamol and rose following atenolol or propranolol, and the hypokalaemic effect of salbutamol was reversed more effectively by propranolol than by atenolol. Although blood glucose rose after salbutamol, it was unaffected by any of the other treatments. Lying and standing pulse rate rose after salbutamol and fell equally after either beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, and fell more after salbutamol plus propranolol than after salbutamol plus atenolol. Blood pressure rose after salbutamol and fell after each of the other treatments. Forty milligrams propranolol was thus more effective than 100 mg atenolol in reversing the metabolic effects of 8 mg salbutamol, and was as effective in reversing the cardiovascular effects. In cases of symptomatic salbutamol overdose, propranolol should be considered as an antidote provided the patient is not asthmatic.", 
    "27": "The influence of the local anesthetics procaine and lidocaine on the anticonvulsant action of propranolol was investigated using the maximal electroshock seizure test in mice. Combined application markedly reduced ED50 values either of the local anesthetics or of propranolol. Selected anticonvulsants and antiarrhythmics were tested by comparison. Similar results could be obtained with phenytoin and isatin when administered together with propranolol, whereas procainamide and quinidine failed to exert synergism in a higher degree or in general. Na-Ca-exchange on the membrane level may be a link for the interpretation of the reported findings, since most of the drugs tested are involved in these processes.", 
    "28": "8-hydroxycarteolol hydrochloride (8-OH carteolol) is a main metabolite of carteolol hydrochloride (carteolol). We conducted a randomized double-masked single-drop study in an attempt to compare the effects of the ophthalmic solution of 8-OH carteolol and carteolol on intraocular pressure (IOP) in rabbits with water-load and monkeys. Both 8-OH carteolol (0.01 and 0.1%) and carteolol (1 and 2%) suppressed the water-load induced IOP rise in rabbits. 8-OH carteolol was more effective in suppressing the water-load induced IOP rise in rabbits compared with carteolol on equimolar basis. Both 8-OH carteolol (0.1%) and carteolol (2%) caused a statistically significant decrease in IOP in monkeys. 8-OH carteolol was estimated to be more potent than carteolol in lowering IOP on equimolar basis in monkeys.", 
    "29": "To determine the effect of long-term topical application of commercial beta-blockers on the corneal endothelium, normal rats were randomly assigned to receive a drop of 0.5% timolol, 1% befunolol, or 2% carteolol four times daily for 8 months. Specular microscopy showed marked pleomorphism in the endothelium after three months of treatment with 1% befunolol. In contrast, the eyes treated with either 0.5% timolol or 2% carteolol demonstrated no significant change in endothelial morphology. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy at eight months after treatment revealed marked degeneration of the endothelium of the eyes treated with 1% befunolol. Similar endothelial changes were also noted in the 0.5% timolol-treated group, but to a significantly lesser extent. The eyes treated with 2% carteolol, however, showed only mild alteration of the endothelial ultrastructure. These results indicate that the corneal endothelium can be affected by long-term topical administration of commercial beta-blockers.", 
    "30": "The traditional opinion that increased intraocular pressure is the cause of glaucoma is controversial, probably mainly because of the fact that firm evidence for the value of pressure reduction is largely lacking. The present article reviews results from short term studies of visual fields before and after pressure reduction. It also reviews published and unpublished preliminary results from studies addressing the problem of whether the long term visual field prognosis, in glaucoma and in ocular hypertension, is affected by pressure lowering therapy. There is no convincing agreement among results from modern studies using computerized perimetry indicating that acute lowering of the ocular tension results in an improvement of the glaucomatous visual field. Long-term result are equally conflicting, and often negative. We have noted from a preliminary analysis of our own masked, prospective study of patients with 'high risk' ocular hypertension, that the same results may be interpreted in quite different ways. The results of available studies certainly indicate that pressure reduction does not automatically lead to clear and positive effects on the visual field. The studies have often been small, however, and have usually not had the power of detecting small effects of treatment. Also, pressure reduction has usually not been dramatic and many treated patients have maintained 'elevated' pressure levels. Patients with very high pressures have not been included, and the effect of pressure reduction in this situation has therefore not been investigated at all. More controlled, prospective therapeutic studies are necessary and ethical. It seems particularly important to study the long-term effects of non-pharmacologically induced pressure reduction in patients with manifest field loss.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "1. Normal, atrophied and denervated submaxillary glands were incubated with [3H]adenine for 1 h.

The radioactivity retained in both control and denervated tissues was also similar. 2. In atrophied glands 3H-accumulation as well as 3H-retention were 2-fold higher than these obtained in controls per unit weight, but 30% lower when expressed per gland. 3. The spontaneous efflux of radioactivity, expressed as fractional release, from normal, atrophied and denervated glands prelabelled with [3H]adenine was similar. 4. The outflow of radioactivity was enhanced by exposure of the tissues to 60 mM K+ during 2.5 min. 5. In all three groups, the purine release induced by K+ was the same. 6. Phentolamine 3.1 microM enhanced the K+-induced release of [3H]purine compounds in control and atrophied glands but not in denervated glands. 7. Propranolol 0.3 microM produced no changes among the three experimental groups. 8. Atropine 1 microM and phentolamine 3.1 microM plus atropine 1 microM did not modify the release of tritiated purine compounds in control and denervated glands. 9. Our results cannot discriminate between neuronal or non-neuronal elements as the source of purines released by depolarization but suggest that classical pharmacological tools such as phentolamine and atropine may affect purine metabolism in a complex fashion.", 
    "32": "Twenty patients of isolated mitral stenosis in normal sinus rhythm (age 22 +/- 4 yrs) in whom symptoms of systemic and pulmonary congestion were controlled on diuretics were the subjects of the present study. The effects of addition of Metoprolol 50 mg po bid for 4 weeks on subjective and objective indices of exercise tolerance were evaluated. Metoprolol produced greater than 50% subjective improvement in 80% of these patients. The increase in time to dyspnoea and total work done on treadmill after 90-120 mins, and after 12 hrs of a dose of metoprolol, were both significant (p less than 0.01). In none of the patients, resting heart rate less than 50/mt, resting and exercise systolic BP less than 90 and less than 105 mmHg, respectively, or any important untoward effects were observed. Metoprolol's beneficial effects and safety can be judged in these patients at two hours after first dose in out patients clinic.", 
    "33": "Antihypertensive drugs have been incriminated for altering the lipid profile of hypertensives, obscuring the beneficial effect of blood pressure reduction on coronary artery disease. The effects of Propranolol, Nifedipine and Hydrochlorothiazide on plasma lipid fractions in recently diagnosed mild hypertensives, randomly allocated to PROP, NIF, HCT groups were studied at 0, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. Target DBP of less than or equal to 90 mmHg was achieved in all the groups of patients. At 24 weeks, skewed distribution of lipid components was observed in PROP and NIF groups without significant alteration in various lipid fractions. In HCT group, TG increased and HDL-C and HDL-C/CH decreased significantly. Long-term significance of these changes, which make the lipid profile more atherogenic, needs to be considered while treating hypertensives.", 
    "34": "This is the first long-term study of pindolol in a population-based sample of men with newly diagnosed hypertension. Eighty-two patients, with a diastolic pressure of 100 mm Hg or more, were identified after screening 6000 men. Many patients were overweight. 82 population controls, matched by sex, age and body mass index, were also recruited. Fourty-eight per cent of the patients and 25% of the controls had a family history of hypertension. Serum triglyceride and urate values were higher in patients than controls at the baseline investigation. Seventy-four patients were followed for 1 year. The dose of pindolol averaged 7.7 mg once daily after 1 year. The diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 13.4 mm Hg. The target pressure of 95 mm Hg or less was achieved in 89% of the patients. The HDL-cholesterol concentration was normal and did not change, whereas the LDL-cholesterol concentration decreased by 0.15 mmol.l-1 during treatment. The total triglyceride values increased transiently up to 6 months, but no significant increase was seen after one year. It is concluded that pindolol had no adverse effect on serum cholesterol and its HDL- and LDL-fractions during 1 year of treatment.", 
    "35": "New analogic-digital technology contributions to standard electrocardiography may allow to record the his bundle potential from the body surface. The aim of this work has been to study the validity of this method by its application to estimate the dromotropic effect of propranolol in healthy volunteers. His bundle potential from body surface was recorded in 19 out of 26 enrolled subjects. The negative dromotropic effect of propranolol (40 mg orally) was observed in only 10 volunteers. The direction of the PR and PH interval changes was used to estimate sensibility (0.9) and specificity (0.89) of this method. There was also a significant correlation (0.89 less than p 0.05) between PR and PH interval changes. This new non-invasive method could be used in clinical pharmacology but the subjects must be preselected.", 
    "36": "Experiments were carried out to test whether the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is the site of a pathway that stimulates thermoregulatory heat production in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Adult Sprague-Dawley rats received bilateral 50 nl microinjections of colchicine solution into the VMH (0.1, 0.32, 1.0 or 3.2 micrograms per side). Beginning a day later, hyperphagia developed consistently with 0.32 microgram colchicine; and with higher doses there appeared the additional effect that for several days rats developed hypothermia when placed temporarily at 6 degrees C. The degree of hypothermia was limited by activation of nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) in BAT, as evidenced by increased shivering after propranolol injection to block NST, and by increased GDP binding measured in IBAT mitochondria after cold exposure. The findings suggest that chemical lesioning to induce the VMH hyperphagia syndrome does not produce an obligatory impairment of thermoregulation against cold unless the dose of neurotoxin and lesion area extends beyond that which underlies the overeating response. Furthermore, when tolerance to cold is thus compromised, the effect is not readily explained in terms of simply disconnecting a proposed stimulatory pathway from the VMH to BAT.", 
    "37": "Hemodynamic data were analyzed from 25 courses of intravenous pulse labetalol therapy for postoperative hypertension in 12 patients after major vascular surgeries. The hemodynamic determinations were obtained an average of 15 minutes after a therapeutic total dose of 10-120 mg of labetalol (mean, 37.5 mg). The mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased an average of 27 mmHg or 20% after intravenous labetalol. This normalization of the postoperative hypertension was associated with a 19% increase in cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI) (CO mean increase of 0.58 L/min and CI increase of 0.31 L/min/m2). Commensurate with this decrease in MAP and increase in CO was an average decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of 625 dyne/sec/cm-5 or 25%. The pulmonary vascular resistance decreased 15 dyne/sec/cm-5 or 4%. The heart rate decreased 9 beats per minute or 10% and the left ventricular stroke work improved by 9% or 1.6 g/m2/beat while the right ventricular stroke work increased by 33% or 2.8 g/m2/beat. The hemodynamic responses to intravenous labetalol in these patients were all beneficial, and there were no adverse effects secondary to the pulse doses of labetalol. Labetalol appears to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of postoperative hypertension in patients undergoing major vascular surgery.", 
    "38": "Propranolol binding to human albumin (HSA) and to mixtures of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and HSA was examined in the presence of a perfluorochemical (PFC) blood substitute. The per cent free propranolol was determined using a dialysis exchange method at 37 degrees C. In 4% HSA solutions the per cent free propranolol was 51.9% and 53.6% at propranolol concentrations of 100 and 500 ng/ml, respectively. Buffer dilutions of 4% HSA solutions resulted in an increase in free propranolol. However, dilution of the HSA solutions with the PFC emulsion resulted in a significant decrease in free propranolol. In solutions containing 4% HSA with 0.067% AGP, the per cent free propranolol was 22.6% and 23.5% for 100 and 500 ng/ml propranolol, respectively. Again, the per cent free propranolol increased upon plasma protein dilution with buffer solution and decreased upon dilution with the blood substitute. A centrifugation method was utilized to determine the per cent bound propranolol associated with the PFC emulsion droplets in the presence of the proteins. Propranolol was significantly bound by the PFC emulsion even in the presence of a mixture of AGP and HSA. These results indicate that the overall affinity of the PFC blood substitute for propranolol is very substantial. Thus, administration of this PFC blood substitute may not result in the significant increase in per cent free propranolol normally associated with plasma protein dilution.", 
    "39": "Oxygen consumption, colonic and interscapular brown adipose tissue temperature were evaluated in four groups of male and four groups of female rats both before and after lesions in different brain regions, and following beta-blocker propranolol administration. Recovery of body weight with varying difficulties in reaching food was also recorded in the injured animals. Groups consisted of rats with bilateral lesions in the entopeduncular nucleus (group EN), rats with bilateral lesions in the globus pallidus (group GP), rats with lateral hypothalamic lesions in the left side and entopeduncular lesion in the right side (group EN-LH), and rats with bilateral lesions in the lateral hypothalamus (group LH). Colonic and brown adipose tissue temperature and oxygen consumption were significantly increased after lesions in rats of groups EN, LH and EN-LH, but not in animals of the GP groups. Similarly, propranolol administration blocked the rise in heat production only in EN, LH and EN-LH animals. No differences were found between sexes. The survival rate was the same in all groups. GP rats recovered body weight earlier than animals injured in the other regions. The difficulty in reaching food was an important factor only in rats damaged in the EN. The results suggest that lateral hypothalamus and entopeduncular nucleus share a common regulatory function of the energy metabolism, while EN lesions induce a motor deficit in addition.", 
    "40": "The specificity of nicotinic receptors in the neocortex has been questioned previously because: (i) electrophysiological responses to nicotine could not be blocked by nicotinic antagonists, and (ii) the effect of nicotine was not mimicked by acetylcholine. In the present study, the presence of functional nicotinic receptors in rat neocortex has been assessed in a slice preparation of prefrontal cortex, using evoked field potential and unit recordings. Nicotine and the nicotinic agonists, dimethylphenylpiperazinium, cytisine, acetylthiocholine, applied by iontophoresis, produced an increase in the negative wave of field potentials, reflecting an increased excitability of cortical neurons. This effect was blocked by the selective probe for neuronal nicotinic receptors Toxin F (1.4 microM in the perfusion medium) and by dihydro-beta-erythroidine (100 microM). Alpha-bungarotoxin, the blocker of skeletal muscle acetylcholine receptor had no effect. Iontophoretically applied acetylcholine, muscarine and pilocarpine, on the other hand, produced a decrease in the field potential amplitude, which was blocked by atropine and scopolamine (1-10 microM). In the presence of eserine (10 microM), the muscarinic effect of acetylcholine was dramatically altered, leading to the development of a nicotinic response sensitive to Toxin F. Thus, the physiological activation of nicotinic receptors in rat prefrontal cortex appears to require higher concentrations of acetylcholine than do muscarinic receptors. Our results show that: (i) the rat prefrontal cortex possesses functional nicotinic receptors with a pharmacological profile clearly distinct from muscle receptors, and (ii) a nicotinic effect of acetylcholine can be revealed when its degradation by acetylcholinesterase is inhibited.", 
    "41": "The membrane potential and conductance alterations of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons evoked by serotonin applied in bath or from a micropipette under pressure have been studied by intracellular technique. Serotonin application evoked depolarization with a decrease in membrane conductance and hyperpolarization with an increase in its conductance. A part of depolarization responses mediated by 5-HT2 receptor activation were independent of intracellular AMP concentration and associated with blockade of M-current channels. The other part of depolarizing and all hyperpolarizing responses mediated by 5-HT1A receptor activation were depressed by pertussis toxin and considerably modulated by intracellular AMP alterations. These responses were shown to be associated with disturbances in the function of AMP-dependent potassium ionic channels.", 
    "42": "Evoked potentials (field responses) were recorded in all cerebellar central nuclei after the locus coeruleus stimulation. Most pronounced responses were recorded in the dentate and fastigial nuclei. Study of the spontaneous neuronal activity of the cerebellar nuclei revealed mainly inhibitory responses to the locus coeruleus stimulation. Most significant inhibitory effects were observed in dentate and fastigial nuclei.", 
    "43": "Effects of propranolol and atenolol on isoproterenol-induced responses of isolated atrial and papillary muscles from experimentally diabetic rats were examined. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the diabetic group (DM) which received streptozotocin 60 mg/kg, i.v. and the control group (C) which received vehicle i.v. At 6 weeks after, the right atrial or right ventricular papillary muscle was isolated, and the beating rate (R) in the atrium or isometric force development (F) and its first derivatives (+/- dF/dt) in the papillary muscle under pacing were recorded. Basal R was less frequent in DM than in C, but ED50 values for isoproterenol-induced chronotropy were not different between the two groups. Basal F and basal +/- dF/dt were not different between the two groups, but isoproterenol-induced increases in F and +/- dF/dt were less in DM than in C. ED50 values in F and +dF/dt were not different between the two groups. Propranolol and atenolol shifted the concentration-response curves in R, F and +/- dF/dt for isoproterenol to the right in both groups. pA2 values of propranolol and atenolol for each parameter were not different between the two groups. Results indicate that propranolol and atenolol exert the same beta-adrenoceptor blocking potency in both diabetic and non-diabetic hearts of rats.", 
    "44": "Time-dependent changes in the blocking effect of diltiazem on norepinephrine (NE)-induced vasoconstrictions were investigated in isolated canine pulmonary veins. Within 2-3 hr of the perfusion period, pretreatment with diltiazem did not affect the vasoconstrictor responses to NE. However, in the 8-11 hr perfused preparations, diltiazem suppressed the NE-induced vasoconstriction significantly. It may participate in the mechanisms for the appearance of the blocking effect in the following manner: 1) a proportion of alpha adrenoceptors which are sensitive to calcium entry are increased and/or 2) spare alpha adrenoceptors are decreased time-dependently.", 
    "45": "Plasma concentrations after oral administration of the high extraction drug propranolol are increased in patients and animals with inflammation. This could be due to increased serum propranolol binding, but also to decreased first-pass metabolism. We studied the pharmacokinetics of 3 drugs in control rats and in rats with turpentine-induced inflammation: propranolol, which is bound extensively to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP); metoprolol, another high extraction drug, but which is negligibly bound to alpha 1-AGP; and antipyrine, a low extraction drug, not bound to serum proteins. After IV administration of propranolol in rats with inflammation, systemic clearance, volume of distribution, and free fraction decreased, and the area under the curve (AUC) increased, whereas the half-life did not change. As the systemic clearance of a high extraction drug such as propranolol depends on hepatic blood flow only, a fall in hepatic blood flow or transition to a low extraction situation should be postulated. After oral administration of propranolol, the AUC was increased 20-fold in rats with inflammation; as the decrease in free fraction was only 4-fold, it can be concluded that a considerable decrease in hepatic intrinsic clearance was present. For metoprolol, in contrast to propranolol, after IV administration, no changes in pharmacokinetic parameters as a result of inflammation were observed. After oral administration, the AUC was increased about 4 times in rats with inflammation; as metoprolol is only negligibly bound to serum proteins, the increase in AUC can be attributed to a decrease in hepatic intrinsic clearance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "The role of various second messengers in the learning and retention of a passive or active avoidance has been investigated in mice. Scopolamine at 3 mg/kg i.p. inhibits muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors and thus acetylcholine activation of the phosphoinositide cycle. This results in amnesia of passive avoidance but has no effect on active avoidance learning. Oxotremorine at 0.05 mg/kg i.p., whose preferential M2 muscarinic action limits acetylcholine release and also inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, causes amnesia of the retention of a passive avoidance and antagonizes the learning of an active avoidance. DL-propranolol at 40 mg/kg i.p., which inhibits cAMP formation, does not affect retention of a passive avoidance but antagonizes that of an active avoidance. Similarly, phorbol myristate acetate a 0.1 mg/kg i.p., which activates protein kinase C, has no effect on the retention of a passive avoidance but antagonizes that of an active avoidance. The results tend to show a distinct role for cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which would participate in memorization processes of an active avoidance, and for protein kinase C, which would participate in that of a passive avoidance. The authors discuss the involvement of different neurophysiological mechanisms as a function of the type of behavior, depending on whether or not it is related to the control of environmental situations.", 
    "47": "The effect of parasympathetic and sympathetic pharmacologic blockade (atropine and propranolol) on QT duration was studied in 26 patients. Of this number 17 had a normal QT time, while in 9 patients the QT interval was prolonged (greater than 460 ms). QT time was determined before and after the pharmacologic blockade with sinus rhythm (under a non fixed cycle length) and with atrial pacing (with a fixed cycle length). Atropine administration did not change QT duration significantly. On the effect of beta receptor blockade in normal patients only the corrected QT time shortened, while in long QT syndrome a very pronounced shortening in QT time, independent of the changes in the cycle length, could be observed. In QT prolongation an overactivity in the sympathetic tone can be supposed.", 
    "48": "Nanoparticles with pilocarpine and timolol were produced by micelle polymerization. The influence of manufacturing temperature, type of monomer, drug concentration and ethylcyanoacrylate concentration on the particle size were investigated with a Coulter Nano Sizer. The nanoencapsulation succeeded only with the pilocarpine or timolol base, not with the salts of these drugs. Different micelle formation in aqueous medium compared with organic solvents was evidently responsible for this phenomenon. The particle formation was affected both by the manufacturing temperature and the type of monomer. The smallest particles were produced at lower temperatures and with the most lipophilic monomers. The monomer and drug concentration had very little influence on the particle size. The nanoparticles made with pilocarpine were, in general, much bigger than those made with timolol.", 
    "49": "Befunolol was tested in an animal experiment with 2 cataract models of the Sprague-Dawley-rat. The treatment scheme was designed with 8 different treatment groups, such that befunolol could be tested single and in combination with one or two cataract models. Over the 6 weeks experimental period, slit lamp microscopy and Scheimpflug photography were employed as observation and documentation methods, extensive post-mortem biochemistry was carried out after sacrifice of the animals. Neither the in-vivo observation and documentation nor the biochemistry showed pronounced effects pointing to a cocataractogenic potential of the drug. Slit density enhancing effects were found in combining UV-B irradiation and befunolol treatment. This effect has also been found in other experiments with timolol.", 
    "50": "The concentration of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent metoprolol was determined in the blood plasma and aqueous humor after oral administration of the compound. One group (10 cases) was receiving their prescribed continuous therapy and the other group (20 cases) received a single dose of metoprolol. The concentration of metoprolol was usually higher in aqueous than in plasma after continuous administration. This differs significantly from administration of a single dose where the concentration of metoprolol was higher in plasma. The result indicates an ocular accumulation of the drug in chronic systemic treatment.", 
    "51": "1. The metabolic oxidation of metoprolol has been studied in a group of 98 San Bushmen. 2. The amounts of metoprolol and alpha-hydroxy metoprolol excreted in 0-8 h urine collection, after dosing with 100 mg metoprolol, were measured and the metabolic ratio (% dose excreted as metoprolol/% dose excreted as alpha-hydroxy metoprolol) calculated. 3. Frequency distribution and probit plots of the metabolic rate data showed a bimodal distribution with 4.1% of the population exhibiting slow metabolism with an MR greater than 10. 4. These results are much less than found in Caucasians (8.4%) but very different from the unimodal distribution found for Nigerians. 5. A previous study in the same group of Bushmen had revealed that 18 of 96 subjects were poor or non-metabolizers of debrisoquine to 4-hydroxy debrisoquine, but only one of the poor metoprolol metabolizers was a poor metabolizer of debrisoquine. 6. On the basis of these results, the claim of debrisoquine type of polymorphism for beta-adrenoceptor antagonists found in Caucasians cannot be extrapolated to the San Bushmen, and one must query the use of debrisoquine as measure of oxidative status in any group other than Caucasians.", 
    "52": "The effect of mechanical asphyxia and the following resuscitation on the metabolism of the vital organs (brain, heart, liver, and lungs) has been experimentally studied in male rats. It has been shown that excessive activation of lipid peroxidation leading to the damage of membrane structures is one of the key factors causing bioenergetic disturbances. In clinical conditions it is manifested in hyperenzymemia, while in isolated isovolumetrically contracting heart it is manifested in massive enzyme outflow from cardiomyocytes into the coronary duct and reduction of glucose uptake per unit of cardiac work performed. These changes closely correlate with contractility function disturbances both in normal and accelerated heart rate. Preadministration of 0.2 mg/kg propranolol increased survival in the early postasphyxia period, decreased considerably metabolic disturbances in vital organs and improved myocardial contractility.", 
    "53": "In order to estimate the influence of a non-medicamentous therapy (CNT) on the consumption of medicaments and coronary risk in high blood pressure 73 hypertensives of a medicamentously stabilized CNT-group were examined in comparison to a group of the same size of patients with hypertension who were managed exclusively medicamentously for behaviour of blood pressure, need of antihypertensive drugs and changes of hypertension-associated risk factors. After an exactly controlled 6-month treatment hypertensives with additionally recommended far-reaching CNT showed an economization of medicaments by scarcely the half in comparison to the reference group. By means of suitable control methods a causal non-medicamentously conditioned decrease of blood pressure could be excluded. A different need of antihypertensive drugs was simulated by the exacter intake of medicaments in the index-patients. Notwithstanding the metabolic effects of the additional therapy have induced a positive change of atherogenic lipids. The examinations indicate in general the difficulty of the judgement of efficacy of non-medicamentous therapeutic measures in connection with a rational dose-reduced long-term therapy with antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "54": "In a planned, randomized, double blind study ocular perfusion pressures were measured before and after a 3-day regimen of 2% carteolol hydrochloride or 0.5% timolol maleate. A pressure tolerance test was also carried out. The results of this test revealed the critical pressure: it is the artificially increased intraocular pressure at which the visual function (monitored by visually evoked cortical potentials) is reduced to 20% of its initial value. The ocular perfusion pressures are affected by both drugs. They are more clearly reduced by carteolol than by timolol. The critical pressure is affected by both drugs too. After application of carteolol, the critical pressure is clearly lower than after application of timolol. The difference is statistically significant (p less than 0.05).", 
    "55": "The unilateral, topical administration of certain ocular hypotensive agents, notably clonidine, is reported to result in a bilateral decrease in intraocular pressure. It has been previously proposed that such bilateral ocular hypotensive responses may be centrally mediated. However, the possible influence of blood pressure changes on intraocular pressure has remained a complicating factor in determining mechanisms of action. In order to further clarify the potential relationship between systemic blood pressure changes and intraocular pressure, the effects of two systemic antihypertensive drugs were determined in the conscious rabbit. Topical, unilateral administration of either hydralazine or prizidilol did not lower the intraocular pressure of either eye. A bolus intravenous injection of either hydralazine or prizidilol caused substantial systemic hypotension that persisted for at least 3 h, but no decreases in intraocular pressure occurred. These studies indicate that sustained decreases in systemic blood pressure of approximately 15 mm Hg do not result in ocular hypotension.", 
    "56": "Previous reports have suggested an interaction between propafenone and digoxin. We investigated the pharmacokinetics of IV digoxin when given alone (Phase I), after pretreatment with propafenone 150 mg every 8 hours for seven days (Phase II), and after propafenone 300 mg every 8 hours for 7 days (Phase III). The total body clearance of digoxin during Phase I was 2.45 ml/min/kg and was 2.17 ml/min/kg during Phase II (NS) and decreased to 1.92 ml/min/kg during Phase III (P less than 0.05). The renal clearance and half-life of digoxin were not significantly altered by propafenone. There was a trend towards a decrease in the volume of distribution of digoxin from 9.43 L/kg in Phase I, to 9.33 L/kg in Phase II, and 8.02 L/kg in Phase III. Similarly there was a trend towards a decreased nonrenal clearance of digoxin from 1.21 ml/min/kg during Phase I to 1.01 ml/min/kg during Phase II and to 0.75 ml/min/kg during Phase III. The changes in volume of distribution and nonrenal clearance parallel each other resulting in no change in the elimination half-life of digoxin. It is postulated that the mechanism of this interaction is due to decreases in the volume of distribution and nonrenal elimination of digoxin by propafenone. The degree of this interaction was related to the dose of propafenone. The magnitude of this interaction may be greater in patients and, thus, may require a reduction in the digoxin dose.", 
    "57": "The effects of placebo, propranolol, and clonidine on blood pressure and blood pressure variability were examined in 14 subjects who had moderate essential hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide was given throughout successive 4- to 5-week periods of placebo, propranolol, and clonidine administration. During each treatment period, subjects were admitted twice to the clinical research unit for 24-hour blood pressure monitoring performed during administration of placebo, propranolol and clonidine and repeated 1 to 2 weeks later during the first 24 hours after the abrupt cessation of placebo or drug administration. Blood pressure was recorded at 15-minute intervals using an automated noninvasive recorder (Arteriosonde, Roche, New Jersey). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were averaged and the standard deviation taken as the measure of long-term variability (LTV). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure in sequential overlapping blocks of seven readings were averaged and the standard deviation calculated. Short-term variability (STV) was estimated as the average of the standard deviations of the running means. During placebo administration and withdrawal, systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as LTV and STV were unchanged. Systolic and diastolic pressures did not differ during propranolol administration from those during propranolol withdrawal or placebo withdrawal. Systolic and diastolic LTV and STV did not differ during propranolol administration and withdrawal from those observed during placebo administration or withdrawal. After clonidine withdrawal, both systolic and diastolic pressures increased to values significantly greater than during clonidine administration. These values were significantly greater than those observed after placebo withdrawal, thereby indicating rebound hypertension. After clonidine withdrawal, seven of fourteen subjects developed systolic pressure rebound; diastolic pressure rebound was observed in three patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "58": "It was found that the stimulating effect of alpha-adrenomimetic mesatone in the test of lymphocyte adhesion inhibition in patients with rectum cancer in vitro was eliminated by beta-adrenergic blocker phentolamine and the inhibitory effect of beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. It was shown in vitro that lymphocyte chemoreceptor sensitivity to the stimulating effect of mesatone decreased and sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of isadrine increased in patients with advanced stages of rectum cancer.", 
    "59": "The effects of anapriline, ketamine and anapriline administered during ketamine-induced anesthesia on contents of lipid fractions and ATP in the heart and on oxidation of fatty acids by myocardial mytochondria were studied on 200 albino rats. Administration of ketamine in a dose of 50 mg/kg induced blockade of lipolysis and a decrease of ATP content in the heart. At oxidation of fatty acids a decrease of respiratory control due to an increase of the rate of controlled mitochondrial respiration was noted. Anapriline (1 mg/kg) induced lipolysis blockade and ATP accumulation in the myocardium. Fatty acid oxidation was followed by activation of all rates of mitochondrial respiration and an increase of phosphorylation efficiency coefficient. Anapriline administered during ketamine-induced anesthesia prevented an impairment of myocardial bioenergy developing under the influence of ketamine that manifested itself in an increase of phosphorylating respiration rate, phosphorylation efficiency coefficient and ATP content in the myocardium.", 
    "60": "This study has compared the effect on heart rate control of the addition of pindolol 15 mg bd or verapamil 40 mg tds to maintenance digoxin therapy in 12 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. The study was performed in a randomized cross-over fashion. Treatment effects were assessed by 24-h ambulatory electrocardiography and symptomatic improvement by symptom scores. The results show that the combination of pindolol and digoxin provides better control of atrial fibrillation. With an attenuation of daytime tachycardia, prevention of nocturnal bradycardia and reduction in the length of nocturnal pauses in rhythm. Overall heart rate variability was significantly less with digoxin and pindolol (523 beats min-1 h-1) than with digoxin and verapamil (745 beats min-1 h-1). We conclude that, in the dosages employed, combined digoxin and pindolol therapy is superior to either digoxin and verapamil in combination or digoxin alone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.", 
    "61": "Sixty patients, with mild to moderate essential hypertension, were considered for a double-blind trial comparing the effects of ketanserin and atenolol. After 2 weeks of placebo, a group of 30 patients was given ketanserin 20 mg twice daily for 15 days and 40 mg twice daily for the subsequent 45 days, while the second group (30 patients) was given atenolol for 60 days at the dose of 100 mg once daily. Blood pressure and pulse rate in the supine and standing positions were evaluated every 15 days. After the beginning of treatment with ketanserin, there was a gradual but highly significant decrease of the diastolic and systolic blood pressure values. No important side-effects or significant alterations in the biochemical parameters considered were observed during treatment with ketanserin.",

There was an increase in the median and 80th percentile values 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours after the beginning of tocolysis but no statistically significant difference between these values and the normal ones could be shown.", 
    "63": "One hundred and sixteen patients with newly diagnosed primary open angle glaucoma were selected for a randomised, prospective, multicentre trial if the untreated intraocular pressure was over 25 mmHg and there was field loss characteristic of glaucoma. Conventional management of medical therapy followed by trabeculectomy in unsuccessful cases was compared with trabeculectomy at diagnosis followed where necessary by supplementary medical therapy. At a mean follow-up of 4.6 years there was no significant difference in visual acuity between the groups but the conventional management group had significantly greater loss of visual field which occurred during the unsuccessful attempt at medical control. The eyes which lost most visual field were those with least field loss at diagnosis and this paradox was attributed to a prolonged attempt at medical control in these eyes because they were thought to have a lower risk of visual field deterioration.",

In order to evaluate the mechanism by which beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity preserve left ventricular systolic function at rest, 46 patients with coronary artery disease were studied by right and left heart catheterization and left ventriculography. Patients were studied using a double-blind, randomized protocol before and after a single intravenous dose of 3 mg propranolol (N = 22) or 0.5 mg pindolol (N = 24). 2. Mean right atrial pressure increased similarly after both drugs. Mean pulmonary artery pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, mean aortic pressure, and peripheral vascular resistance did not change significantly after either drug. Cardiac index (before: 3.0 +/- 0.7 (mean +/- SEM); after: 2.8 +/- 0.2 1 min-1 m-2) and heart rate (before: 78 +/- 15; after: 72 +/- 12 bpm) decreased only after propranolol administration. 3. Ejection fraction decreased only after propranolol (48 +/- 16 to 41 +/- 15%). Improvement in segmental wall motion abnormalities was noted (23 of 47 segments) only after pindolol. The total left ventricular wall motion score improved after pindolol and worsened after propranolol (P less than 0.05). In patients with impaired left ventricular function, pindolol administration resulted in improved resting ejection fraction. 4. Thus, the acute hemodynamic consequences of pindolol administration differ from those of propranolol owing to the preservation of left ventricular systolic function which seems to be related to the intrinsic sympathomimetic effect of pindolol on areas of reversible wall motion abnormality.", 
    "65": "The short-term continuous treatment with propranolol and nadolol, a long-acting nonselective beta-adrenoblocker without own sympathomimetic activity, conducted in two randomized groups of men with stable arterial hypertension (the diastolic AP greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg) has shown that by its hypotensive and negative chronotropic effects nadolol given in the mean dose 87 mg/day compared very favourably with propranolol administered in a dose of 144 mg/day. At the same time nadolol is more fit for patients since it may be taken once a day. The influence of both beta-blockers on the hemodynamic, metabolic parameters and external respiratory function was similar. Nadolol in doses of less than 200 mg/day did not lower the rate of glomerular filtration. On the use of the drug in doses of 240 and 280 mg/day the rate of glomerular filtration slightly decreased.", 
    "66": "Labetalol, a combined alpha 1- and nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking drug, was compared to lidocaine or saline to minimize the hypertensive and tachycardic response to intubation in a controlled randomized double-blind study in patients undergoing surgical procedures under general anesthesia. Forty adult patients were divided into four groups of 10 each: placebo (saline), lidocaine 100 mg, labetalol 5 mg, or labetalol 10 mg. The double-blind preparation was administered as an IV bolus just prior to induction and 2 min before the stimulus of laryngoscopy and intubation. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured at 1-min intervals for 2 min prior to induction of anesthesia and through 6 min following induction of anesthesia. Labetalol 10 mg prevented a rise in heart rate after intubation compared to patients who received placebo, lidocaine 100 mg, or labetalol 5 mg. The hypertensive response to intubation was similar in all four groups. Labetalol 10 mg IV just prior to induction of anesthesia is a safe and cost-effective means of preventing tachycardia but not hypertension in response to laryngoscopy and intubation.", 
    "67": "Drug delivery to the eyes is quite inefficient regardless if the drugs are administered topically or intravenously. It is known that less than 1% of topically instilled drug can be absorbed into the eyes while even less of intravenously injected drugs reach the eyes. A research model has been developed in this study which allows delivery of drugs effectively to uveal and anterior structures of the eye. This experimental model allows drugs to be delivered to the eye via cannulation of and retrograde flow through the valveless vortex veins. In addition, the superficial branch of the vortex vein (draining the ciliary body and iris) or the deep branch (draining the choroid plexus of the retina) can be selectively cannulated to suit the researcher's needs. Finally, this procedure minimizes systemic drug actions which otherwise would complicate interpretation of experimental results. This model can be used for in vivo laboratory studies on (a) metabolic and physiological processes of the uveal tract in the eye, and (b) drug delivery to selective tissues of the uveal tract in the eye. Dose-response relationships of pilocarpine and timolol to lower intraocular pressure were demonstrated with this model.", 
    "68": "The effectiveness of labetalol (a combination nonselective beta and alpha-1-adrenergic receptor antagonist) in modifying hemodynamic responses associated with rapid sequence induction and tracheal intubation was evaluated. In a double-blind study, 24 ASA physical status I or II male patients scheduled for elective surgery were given either IV labetalol, 0.25 mg/kg (n = 8) or 0.75 mg/kg (n = 8), or a saline placebo (n = 8). Five minutes later, patients were given oxygen by mask and IV vecuronium, 0.01 mg/kg. Ten minutes after giving labetalol or placebo, cricoid pressure was applied and anesthesia was induced with IV sodium thiopental (4 mg/kg) and succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg) 1 minute prior to intubation. The mean duration of laryngoscopy was 17 +/- 3 seconds. Prior to induction, the 0.25 mg/kg and 0.75 mg/kg doses of labetalol significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced mean arterial pressure by 4.4 +/- 1.9 and by 8.6 +/- 2.0 mmHg, respectively, but did not significantly alter heart rate or cardiac output. The 0.75 mg/kg dose of labetalol also significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased total peripheral resistance by 10.1 +/- 3.0%. Within 30 seconds after intubation, patients in all three groups exhibited increases in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, total peripheral resistance, and rate pressure product and a decrease in stroke volume. However, patients in the 0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg labetalol groups, compared to those in the placebo group, had significantly lower increases in peak heart rate (33 +/- 2 and 27 +/- 3 vs. 44 +/- 7 beats/minute), peak mean arterial pressure (38 +/- 6 and 38 +/- 7 vs. 58 +/- 7 mmHg), and peak rate pressure product (7,726 +/- 260 and 7,215 +/- 300 vs. 14,023 +/- 250 units). The results show that these doses of labetalol significantly blunt, but do not completely block, autonomic responses to rapid sequence induction and intubation.", 
    "69": "In a randomized study, labetalol-induced hypotension and nitroprusside-induced hypotension were compared in 20 patients (10 in each group) scheduled for major orthopedic procedures. Each patient was subjected to an identical anesthetic protocol and similar drug-induced reductions in mean arterial blood pressure (BP) (50 to 55 mmHg). Nitroprusside infusion was associated with a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in heart rate and cardiac output; rebound hypertension was observed in three patients after discontinuation of nitroprusside. Labetalol administration was not associated with any of these findings. Arterial PO2 decreased in both groups. It was concluded that labetalol offers advantages over nitroprusside.", 
    "70": "A group of 20 patients with primary hypertension (NT) were studied for the influence of six-week propranolol therapy on the secretion of immunoreactive insulin (IR-I), gastrin glucagon (IR-G) and pancreatic polypeptide (IR-PP) induced by a high-fat test meal. The results of the examination before the therapy were compared with examination of 10 healthy persons. Before the therapy, the patients with NT revealed a decreased reactivity of IR-PP to the food stimulus. After propranolol therapy, the authors found a significant change of glucagonemia profile and pancreatic polypeptide concentration induced by a test meal. The results of the examinations made suggest a direct or indirect participation of beta-adrenergic endings in the regulation of glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide secretion in patients with primary hypertension.", 
    "71": "The antihypertensive efficacy and acceptability of perindopril (P) were compared to those of captopril (C), atenolol (A) and a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride (D), in 3 double-blind parallel multicenter studies involving 165, 173, and 165 patients, respectively. Patients with essential hypertension and a supine DBP between 95 and 125 mmHg (mean 103.9, 106.2, and 105.2 mmHg, respectively) after a 1-month placebo period were randomized to P 4 mg once daily (o.d.) and either C 25 mg twice daily, or A 50 mg o.d. or D (hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg + amiloride 5 mg o.d.) and treated for 3 months, with visits at monthly intervals. If necessary, treatment was adjusted at each visit to control BP (supine DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg): firstly by doubling the dose and secondly, one month later, by the addition of a second drug, a diuretic in the studies versus C or A, a beta-blocker in the study versus D. At 3 months, BP control on monotherapy in the three studies was achieved in the following proportion of patients: 49% with P vs 49% with C; 55% with P vs 48% with A; 72% with P vs 72% with D. Most of the patients controlled by P received 4 mg, about 15% were controlled with 8 mg. A further percentage of patients was controlled with combination therapy, the combination with a diuretic being more effective with P than with C (26 vs 8%) or A (23 vs 10%) and the combination with a beta-blocker being less effective with P than with D (5 vs 13%). The total percentage of patients controlled was greater with P than with C (75 vs 57%, p = 0.016) or A (78 vs 58%, p = 0.006) and there was no significant difference between P and D (78 vs 84%). The drop-out rate due to side-effects was up to 6% with P, similar to that observed with C (4%), A (5%) and D (5%). Most of the complaints reported with P were minor and non-specific, their incidence being similar to that observed with the other drugs. Cough was reported with both P (1%) and C (2%) as well as with A (1%) and D (1%). Compared to these drugs, the biological acceptability of P was good, no case of renal failure being observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "72": "Propranolol was administered to fifteen cirrhotic patients at requires doses, to reduce cardiac output by 25%. Patients were followed up for a period of 1 to 2 years. Bleeding rates and esophagic varices size were compared against fifteen patients treated with placebo, serwing as control group. On the treated group only one patient showed bleeding, detected by hemoccult while controls showed a 46.6% of bleedings which cause two deaths. The endoscopic size of varices decreased in 73.3% on the treated group, this was not observed on the controls. Propranolol is a useful medicament for the reduction of esophagic varices size and prevention of digestive bleeding in cirrhotic patients.", 
    "73": "1. The inotropic effect of physiological concentrations of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) in isolated guinea-pig cardiac muscles was studied. 2. LH-RH increased the contractile force elicited by either fast and slow responses in a dose-dependent manner. 3. These effects of LH-RH were affected by phentolamine and diltiazem but not by propranolol and cold condition. 4. This study showed the positive inotropic effect of LH-RH on myocardium through the affection to intracellular Ca, and the difference from the effect of cardiotonic steroids.", 
    "74": "In 18 patients (17 male and 1 female, 40 to 63 years old) with coronary heart disease, a randomized double-blind study was carried out to investigate in comparison to placebo, the antiischemic effects of 5, 10 and 20 mg isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) alone and in combination with gallopamil (G: 25 and 50 mg) or 80 mg propranolol (P: 80 mg) on the ischemic ST-segment-depression in standardized exercise ECGs. ST-depression following administration of ISDN alone was reduced significantly and dose-dependently: following 5 mg from 1.32 +/- 1.14 to 1.0 +/- 0.85 mm (-25.2%; p less than 0.05), 10 mg from 1.17 +/- 0.85 to 0.91 +/- 0.69 mm (-21.7% n.s.) and 20 mg from 1.19 +/- 0.5 to 0.52 +/- 0.57 mm (-53.6%; p less than 0.001). In combination with gallopamil (G: 25 and 50 mg) or propranolol (P) reduction of ST-depression was more pronounced: by 5 mg ISDN with 25 mg G from 1.32 +/- 1.14 to 0.7 +/- 0.71 mm (-46.4%; p less than 0.05), with 50 mg G from 1.32 +/- 1.14 to 0.8 +/- 0.83 mm (-38.8%; p less than 0.01), with 80 mg P from 1.32 +/- 1.14 to 0.28 +/- 0.35 mm (-79.5% p less than 0.01), by 10 mg ISDN combined with 25 mg G from 1.17 +/- 0.85 to 0.69 +/- 0.6 mm (-40.7%; p less than 0.05), with 50 mg G from 1.17 +/- 0.85 to 0.66 +/- 0.62 mm (-43.5%; p less than 0.05), with 80 mg P from 1.17 +/- 0.85 to 0.64 +/- 0.78 mm (-46.4%; p less than 0.01), and by 20 mg ISDN with 25 mg G from 1.19 +/- 0.5 to 0.42 +/- 0.43 mm (-62.6%; p less than 0.001), with 50 mg G from 1.19 +/- 0.5 to 0.39 +/- 0.45 mm (-65.2%; p less than 0.001) and with 80 mg P from 1.19 +/- 0.5 to 0.05 +/- 0.16 mm (-95.8%; p less than 0.001).", 
    "75": "Pathological and clinical studies suggest that platelets play role in the pathogenesis of unstable angina. This study investigated the effect of aspirin on silent episodes of unstable angina. Patient exclusion criteria were acute infarction, left bundle branch block, and ST-depression greater than 0.1 mV in the ECG. 27 patients (pts; 20 m, 7 f; 42-72 yrs) in the CCU with unstable angina were randomized in two groups. Group A received a combination on nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium entry blockers; in group B aspirin (500 mg/day) was added. 6 h after initiating therapy, Holter-ECG was implemented for 48 h. One pt of group A was excluded owing to infarction within these 48 h. 4 of 13 pts in group A and 5 of 13 in group B showed no ST-Segment abnormalities. 6 pts from each group displayed 2 to 5 ST-depressions greater than 0.1 mV from up to 10 min in 24 h; 3 in group A and 2 in group B had 1-5 lasting 11 to 25 min. In the second 24 h period, the number of ST-depressions decreased distinctly. Statistically, the results obtained did not differ significantly in the two groups. Furthermore, the duration of the silent ischemia did not correlate with the severity of coronary stenosis (angiography 3-8 days after admission). Thus, when combined with the aforementioned triple therapeutic regimen, aspirin does not appear to influence the silent episodes of unstable angina pectoris.", 
    "76": "Elderly and young hypertensive patients differ with regard to clinical and pathophysiologic profiles. In the elderly, hypertension is generally characterized by elevated peripheral vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output. To establish an individualized or patient-specific approach to their treatment, antihypertensive agents must be evaluated specifically in this subpopulation. Labetalol, an alpha- and beta-blocking agent, has been shown to lower blood pressure in young and elderly hypertensive patients primarily by reducing peripheral vascular resistance without compromising cardiac output. Examination of recent reports on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects, and on the efficacy and safety of labetalol in elderly persons with hypertension, leads us to conclude that the drug appears to be well suited for use in these patients.", 
    "77": "Propranolol is likely to be widely used to prevent variceal haemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis. Adverse reactions to propranolol in this group of patients are unusual, although the treatment group as a whole appears to tolerate drug therapy poorly. Therefore, compliance is likely to be a limiting factor, particularly in the prophylactic setting, and the use of once-daily long acting propranolol, which appears to be equally effective, has distinct advantages over the conventional, shorter acting formulation.", 
    "78": "A prospective, randomised, multicentre, single-blind comparison of propranolol with placebo in the primary prevention of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage was conducted in 230 cirrhotic patients with large oesophageal varices. The dose of propranolol was progressively increased until resting heart rate was reduced by 20 to 25%. The final doses were 40 mg of conventional propranolol and 160 and 320 mg of long-acting propranolol daily in 22, 60 and 18% of patients, respectively. Patients who survived without bleeding were followed up for 436 +/- 172 days (mean +/- SD). After 2 years, the cumulative percentages of patients free from bleeding were 74% in the propranolol group and 39% in the placebo group (p less than 0.05). Similarly, cumulative 2-year survival was 72% in the propranolol group and 51% in the placebo group (p less than 0.05). Propranolol was well tolerated and only 13 patients were withdrawn from treatment. We concluded that propranolol treatment decreased the incidence of first bleeding and death during a period of 2 years in patients with cirrhosis and large esophageal varices.", 
    "79": "The preliminary analysis of a multicentre, randomised, single-blind trial of propranolol for prophylaxis of first bleeding in cirrhosis is reported. 174 consecutively-chosen patients with large oesophageal varices were randomly assigned to either propranolol, in doses which reduced the resting heart rate by 25% (85 patients), or to vitamin K (89 patients). 25 patients had to be withdrawn from treatment with propranolol because of poor tolerance. The 30-month cumulative proportion of patients free of bleeding was 74% in the propranolol group and 63% in the vitamin K group; corresponding survival figures were 59% and 74%, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant. A retrospective analysis, according to the presence of ascites at randomisation showed that a significantly higher proportion of patients without ascites in the propranolol group were free of bleeding compared with those in the control group (87% vs 64%; p = 0.023). No significant differences were found in patients with ascites at randomisation. Length of survival was not significantly affected by treatment in any subgroup, although it was shorter in ascitic patients given propranolol than in controls (33% vs 63%; p = 0.07). If confirmed on a longer follow-up, these results suggest that propranolol could prevent primary variceal haemorrhage in patients with well-compensated cirrhosis.", 
    "80": "74 cirrhotic patients with a history of variceal or gastric bleeding were randomly assigned to treatment with propranolol (40 to 360 mg/day) or placebo. The patients were all in good condition and doses of propranolol were titrated until a 25% reduction in heart rate was achieved. After 2 years, the cumulative percentage of patients free from rebleeding was significantly greater among the patients receiving propranolol (79%) than in the placebo group (32%; p less than 0.0001). Similarly, the percentage of surviving patients was significantly greater with propranolol (90%) than with placebo (57%; p less than 0.02) after 2 years. It was concluded that in cirrhotic patients in good condition, propranolol reduced both the risk of recurrent gastrointestinal haemorrhage and the mortality rate during a 2-year period of continuous administration of the drug.", 
    "81": "The administration of a single dose of atenolol 50 mg 1 h before a standard 3100 kJ cold meal in fasting healthy subjects reduced the supine preprandial heart rate and systolic blood pressure, and blunted the postural and postprandial rises in mean heart rate and systolic blood pressure relative to placebo. It did not affect the preprandial supine diastolic blood pressure, nor the postural rise and postprandial drop in diastolic blood pressure. Preprandial administration of atenolol blunted the postural and postprandial rises in mean plasma renin activity, and it enhanced the rise in plasma noradrenaline during eating in the sitting position, and the postprandial concentrations of noradrenaline. The findings do not permit the conclusion that beta 1-adrenergic stimulation was the predominant cause of these atenolol-responsive changes.", 
    "82": "The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to determine if antihypertensive treatment of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) [systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 160 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) less than 90 mmHg] reduces the 5 year incidence of fatal and nonfatal stroke. Between March 1, 1985 and January 15, 1988, 4736 persons (target 4800) with ISH, age 60 years and over, were enrolled. Potential participants met blood pressure (BP) and age criteria. Those on antihypertensive medication prior to enrollment without documented diastolic hypertension had their medication tapered and discontinued, and then met BP criteria (33% of cohort). Stepped-care therapy with chlorthalidone and atenolol (alternative, reserpine) or matching placebos was initiated as first and second steps. At baseline the trial population was 43.1% male, 56.9% female; 13.9% black, 86.1% non-black. Also, the mean age was 71.6 years; the mean SBP was 170.3 mmHg and the mean DBP was 76.6 mmHg; 59.8% had codeable resting electrocardiographic abnormalities.

    "83": "The cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol was mixed with the diet (6 mg metoprolol/g food) and given to 9 spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) for four weeks, while 9 other SHR were given the plain diet only and served as controls. All rats were also given 0.5% drinking saline labeled with isotope 22Na (37 kBq/1) to drink. Measurements of total exchangeable sodium, blood pressure, pulse rate and weight were performed before and repeatedly during treatment. Plasma renin activity was measured at the end of the study. Before treatment exchangeable sodium, blood pressure, pulse rate and weight were no different between the groups. Metoprolol reduced the pulse rate and prevented the usual blood pressure increase in SHR. Both groups gained weight similarly. Exchangeable sodium increased similarly in both groups along with the weight increase. Plasma renin activity was not significantly different in the two groups. Thus, chronic metoprolol treatment of SHR reduced blood pressure and pulse rate in SHR but did not lower plasma renin or cause measurable sodium or fluid retention.", 
    "84": "To study the possible role of multiple medications and different types of drugs prescribed to the elderly as a risk factor for short-term loss of consciousness, we compared the drug consumption by 188 patients (65 and over) hospitalized for short-term loss of consciousness to that by 188 controls (65 and over) taken from the general population. The two groups were age- and sex-matched. We took into consideration the evolution of drug consumption due to the time-lag between the two studies. There was no significant difference between the mean number of drugs taken per group. Beta-blocker and anti-angina drug usage was significantly increased in the patient group. For diuretics, tranquilizers and anti-depressants, a large difference was noted but it was not significant. Use of vasodilators, hypnotic drugs and antihypertensive agents was similar in both groups. We discuss the possible lack of statistical potency for several drugs and the fact that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the respective roles of certain medications and the underlying disease in the etiology of the loss of consciousness."
