Equally, extrapolation of the data to agents of the same class untested for particular indications should not occur.

RAW264.7 cells were cultured and transfected with luciferase report gene vector pGL2iNOSLuc. Twenty four hours later, PKC inhibitor H-7, calcium channel blocker verapamil, was added into the culture. LPS or PKC activator PMA was added 2 hours later to stimulate the cells. The activity of beta-galactosidase and luciferase was examined and the relative luciferase activity, representing the iNOS transactivity, was calculated. Modified Griess method was used to measure the concentration of NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-) in the culture so as to evaluate the effect of PKC inhibitor on NO production induced by LPS. RT-PCR was used to study the effect of LPS on iNOS gene expression in RAW264.7 cells.",

The NO concentration in the supernatant with H-7 at any time point was significantly lower than those in corresponding samples without H-7 (all P < 0.01). After stimulation of LPS and PMA, the relative luciferase activity was 25.3 +/- 4.6, significantly higher than the baseline level (P < 0.01).

Intravenous infusions of phenylephrine at the same dose rates had a lesser effect on salivary composition particularly protein. Propranolol administered with phenylephrine via the carotid artery, at an antagonist/agonist ratio of 10:1, was much more effective in blocking the phenylephrine-induced changes in salivary composition than equimolar infusion of phentolamine with phenylephrine. It was concluded that alpha(1)-adrenoreceptors were not present in functionally significant numbers in the gland and that the effect of phenylephrine on the kangaroo parotid was mediated by beta-adrenoreceptors. As the phenylephrine dose rates in the kangaroos were comparable with those used to determine alpha-adrenergic responses of eutherian salivary glands and as phentolamine appeared to have minor beta-sympathomimetic activity, at least one subtype of beta-adrenoreceptors in macropods may not be identical to its eutherian counterpart.",

Target-controlled infusion (TCI) permits adapting infusion to pharmacokinetic models. In this prospective randomized study, we compared intra- and postoperative hemodynamics, remifentanil requirement during anesthesia, and postoperative morphine requirement in patients scheduled for carotid surgery, and receiving either continuous IV weight-adjusted infusion of remifentanil (RIVA) or TCI for remifentanil (TCIR). Forty-six patients were enrolled in this study: all were anesthetized by using TCI for propofol. Twenty-three received RIVA (0.5 micro g. kg(-1) x min(-1)) for the induction of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, with the infusion rate decreased to 0.25 micro g x kg(-1) x min(-1) after intubation, then adapted by step of 0.05 micro g x kg(-1) x min(-1) according to hemodynamics. Twenty-three patients received TCIR (Minto model, Rugloop), with an effect-site concentration at 4 ng/mL during induction, then adapted by step of 1 ng/mL according to hemodynamics. All patients received atracurium and a 50% mixture of N(2)O/O(2). Hemodynamic variables were recorded each minute. The number and duration of hemodynamic events were collected, and total doses of anesthetics (remifentanil and propofol) and vasoactive drugs were noted in both groups of patients. Data were analyzed by using unpaired t-tests. RIVA was significantly associated with more frequent episodes of intraoperative hypotension (16 versus 6, P < 0.001) and more frequent episodes of postoperative hypertension and/or tachycardia requiring more frequent administration of beta-adrenergic blockers (16 vs 10, P < 0.04) in comparison with TCIR. The need for morphine titration was not significantly different between groups. TCIR led to a significantly smaller requirement of remifentanil (700 +/- 290 versus 1390 +/- 555 micro g, P < 0.001) without difference in propofol requirement. This prospective randomized study demonstrated that, during carotid endarterectomy, in comparison with patients receiving remifentanil using continuous RIVA, TCI results in less hypotensive episodes during the induction of anesthesia, in fewer episodes of tachycardia and/or hypertension and a smaller beta-adrenergic blocker requirement during recovery, and a decrease in remifentanil requirement. Recommendations to prefer TCI for remifentanil administration during carotid endarterectomy may be justified.", 
    "26": "Remifentanil for intraoperative analgesia in carotid artery surgery is associated with a better stability in perioperative hemodynamics when administered in target-controlled infusion compared with continuous weight-adjusted infusion.

In patients with AF, the atrial ERP's adaptation to rate was nearly normal in the HRA, but was poor in the DCS. In both groups, dl-sotalol significantly increased the atrial ERPs at both the HRA and DCS, as compared with baseline (p < 0.05). However, the prolongation of atrial ERPs was significantly less at a drive cycle length of 600 ms in patients with AF versus control subjects (p < 0.05). After infusion of dl-sotalol, the atrial ERP's adaptation to rate at both the HRA and DCS was poor in patients with AF, and AF was still easily inducible in the majority of them, but not in control subjects.",

The EFS (16 Hz)-evoked overflow of NA in vein was also increased in the presence of inhibitors of phosphodiesterase (PDE) III and PDE IV (i.e. milrinone, 0.4 microM, and roilpram, 30 microM), whereas these inhibitors did not affect the overflow of NA in the artery. The facilitating effect of activators of cAMP-dependent pathway on the EFS-evoked release of NA at 16 Hz appears to be more pronounced in the vein than in artery. The increasing effect of ISO (10 microM) was inhibited with either propranolol (1 microM) or the adenylyl cyclase (AC) inhibitor [9-(tetrahydro-2'-furyl)adenine] (SQ 22,536, 100 microM) in both blood vessels. The ISO effect was inhibited by the PKA inhibitor 14-22 amide (PKI(14-22)), 1 microM, in the artery but not in vein. The enhancing effect of FSK was inhibited by pretreatment of the tissue with SQ 22,536, 100 microM, or the PKA inhibitors PKI(14-22), 1 microM, and 4-cyano-3-methylisoquinoline, 50 nM. However, the inhibitors alone did not significantly change the EFS-evoked overflow of NA in both blood vessels.",

Optimization of neurohormonal therapy was associated with a significant improvement in NYHA class (2.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.8; p < 0.001). No relevant changes were noticed for blood pressure, serum creatinine, serum sodium, and serum potassium, whereas heart rate dropped significantly. Kaplan-Meier curves examining the time to first event of the combined end point of mortality and hospitalisation for worsening heart failure revealed a clear benefit for patients on combined neurohormonal therapy (ACEI/ARB and beta-blocker, n = 86) when compared with patients on neurohormonal monotherapy (ACEI/ARB or beta-blocker, n = 35), (p < or = 0.001).

    "54": "Because treating hypertension in the elderly so effectively reduces major cardiovascular events, it is vital to diagnose this very common condition early. Much of the hypertension that occurs with aging results from stiffening of the major capacitance arteries, typically marked by high systolic and low diastolic blood pressures. Pulse pressure, derived by subtracting diastolic from systolic values, is a useful index of stiffness, but new noninvasive techniques for measurement of arterial compliance have shown that blood pressures cannot reliably predict the state of the arteries in older people. The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) and the Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) trial demonstrated that treating hypertension in the elderly with diuretics or calcium channel blockers reduces strokes and cardiac events; these results are also clearly evident in high-risk groups like diabetics. Further analysis of Syst-Eur has suggested that a calcium channel blocker reduces new-onset dementia, while follow-up data from SHEP indicate that a diuretic provides survival and stroke benefits in obese or overweight elderly hypertensives, but not in the lean. In general, comparisons of antihypertensive agents, including diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers have found similar clinical end point effects. But recently, the Losartan Intervention For End Point Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) study, performed in patients (average age, 67) with left ventricular hypertrophy and predominant systolic hypertension, showed that the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan was significantly more effective than the beta blocker atenolol in reducing such key outcomes as strokes and new-onset diabetes. Even so, careful but effective control of blood pressure in elderly patients, including those over age 80, still remains a critical factor in preventing major cardiovascular events.",

This compound and its relatives have a unique feature among beta(3)-AR agonists: two chiral carbons are adjacently structured on the left side of the molecule. To study the relationship between the stereoconfiguration of the vicinal chiral carbons in 1a and beta-AR agonistic activity, the four stereoisomers were synthesized via oxazolidinone prepared by intracyclization involving inversion of the beta-hydroxy group. The in vitro assays using rat atria for beta(1)-AR, rat uteri for beta(2)-AR, and ferret detrusor for beta(3)-AR showed that 1a possessed potent beta(3)-AR agonistic activity (EC(50) = 3.85 nM) and 3700- and 1700-fold selectivity for beta(3)-AR relative to beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR, respectively. Comparison of the four isomers revealed that the (alphaS,betaR)-compound (1a) was not only the most potent agonist but was also the most selective for beta(3)-AR. In the anesthetized rat, intravenous administration of 1a brought about a sufficient decrement of the intrabladder pressure (ED(50) = 12 microg/kg), and intraduodenal administration of 2a, which is the ethyl ester of 1a, led to same result (ED(50) = 0.65 mg/kg).

Reported barriers included a perception that aggressive management of CHD is thought to be unimportant by support staff yet to require significant staff time.

    "65": "The ghrelin-induced glucagon secretion in diabetic rats is not controlled via cholinergic or adrenergic pathways. In conclusion, it appears that the main target of ghrelin in the rat endocrine pancreas is not glucagon-producing cells but rather insulin secreting cells which are more involve in weight gain and body growth.", 
    "66": "Situational stressors and anxiety impede performance on creativity tests requiring cognitive flexibility. Preliminary research revealed better performance on a task requiring cognitive flexibility, the anagram task, after propranolol (beta-adrenergic antagonist) than after ephedrine (beta-adrenergic agonist). However, propranolol and ephedrine have both peripheral and central beta-adrenergic effects. In order to determine whether noradrenergic modulation of cognitive flexibility is a centrally or peripherally mediated phenomenon, we compared the effects of propranolol (peripheral and central beta-blocker), nadolol (peripheral beta-blocker), and placebo on anagram task performance. Solution latency scores for each subject were compared across the drug conditions. Anagram solution latency scores after propranolol were significantly lower than after nadolol. This suggests a centrally mediated modulatory influence of the noradrenergic system on cognitive flexibility.",

After intravenous bolus injection of propranolol (2mg/kg) to rats, the serum propranolol concentrations were analyzed by a HPLC-fluorimetric detector system. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as C0, AUC, t1/2(beta), and CLp were determined in each group.

Although one patient who did not have any intraventricular pressure gradients showed no improvement in the electrocardiographic and left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, the other 2 patients, who had significant intraventricular pressure gradients, did show improvement. Dynamic intraventricular obstruction might play a role in maintaining apical ballooning, at least, in patients exhibiting an intraventricular pressure gradient.",

Tl-201 and MIBG were performed in 47 patients before beta-blocker therapy. Patients were classified into group A, if their cardiac function improved, and group B, whose function remained unchanged. Two types of extent score (ES) by Tl-201 were proposed to quantitate myocardial damage, mean-2SD (ES-2) and mean-3SD (ES-3). The ES difference between ES-2 and ES-3 was calculated, and according to ES and ES difference, DCM cases were classified into 3 groups: mild-defect type (mild-type), moderate-defect type (moderate-type) and severe-defect type (severe-type). The heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) MIBG uptake ratio was evaluated, and the percent washout ratio of myocardial MIBG was obtained from these data. Group A comprised 18 mild-type, 14 moderate-type and 1 severe-type cases, and group B comprised 5 mild-type, 4 moderate-type and 5 severe-type cases. A significant relation was observed between the defect type on Tl-201 and the response to beta-blocker therapy (p=0.0090). Both H/M MIBG uptake ratios and washout ratio were not significantly different in the 2 groups. Tl-201 may be useful for predicting the response to beta-blocker therapy in patients with DCM.", 
    "73": "To find out whether indirect negative inotropic effects of carbachol (i.e. decreases in force of contraction that had been stimulated by cyclic AMP-increasing agents) might differ dependent on the agonist employed to increase contractile force in isolated human right atrium, we studied effects of carbachol on atria prestimulated with noradrenaline, terbutaline, histamine and serotonin. All four agonists increased right atrial adenylyl cyclase activity and contractile force, whereby increases for terbutaline, histamine and serotonin, but not for noradrenaline, were significantly larger in right atria from beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist-treated vs. non-beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist-treated patients. Carbachol (10(-8)-10(-3) M) concentration-dependently decreased agonist-stimulated contractile force: maximum decrease was not significantly different within the four agonists. pD(2) values for carbachol, however, were higher in atria from non-beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist-treated vs. beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist-treated patients.We conclude that, in isolated human right atria, carbachol-induced indirect negative inotropic effect is not dependent from the agonist employed to increase (via cyclic AMP accumulation) contractile force. However, in atria from beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist-treated patients, carbachol-induced indirect negative inotropic effect is attenuated.", 
    "74": "Several cytopathic mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the dose-limiting cumulative and irreversible cardiomyopathy caused by doxorubicin. Recent evidence indicates that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are key factors in the pathogenic process. The objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with potent antioxidant properties, protects against the cardiac and hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction associated with subchronic doxorubicin toxicity. Heart and liver mitochondria were isolated from rats treated for 7 weeks with doxorubicin (2 mg/kg sc/week), carvedilol (1 mg/kg ip/week), or the combination of the two drugs. Heart mitochondria isolated from doxorubicin-treated rats exhibited depressed rates for state 3 respiration (336 +/- 26 versus 425 +/- 53 natom O/min/mg protein) and a lower respiratory control ratio (RCR) (4.3 +/- 0.6 versus 5.8 +/- 0.4) compared with cardiac mitochondria isolated from saline-treated rats. Mitochondrial calcium-loading capacity and the activity of NADH-dehydrogenase were also suppressed in cardiac mitochondria from doxorubicin-treated rats. Doxorubicin treatment also caused a decrease in RCR for liver mitochondria (3.9 +/- 0.9 versus 5.6 +/- 0.7 for control rats) and inhibition of hepatic cytochrome oxidase activity. Coadministration of carvedilol decreased the extent of cellular vacuolization in cardiac myocytes and prevented the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on mitochondrial respiration in both heart and liver. Carvedilol also prevented the decrease in mitochondrial Ca(2+) loading capacity and the inhibition of the respiratory complexes of heart mitochondria caused by doxorubicin. Carvedilol by itself did not affect any of the parameters measured for heart or liver mitochondria. It is concluded that this protection by carvedilol against both the structural and functional cardiac tissue damage may afford significant clinical advantage in minimizing the dose-limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy that accompanies long-term doxorubicin therapy in cancer patients.", 
    "75": "A nonaqueous capillary electrophoresis (NACE) method, coupled with either UV or electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), is described for the simultaneous analysis of seven beta-blockers. The same electrolyte, namely 25 mM ammonium formate and 1 M formic acid, was used with different investigated organic solvents. In addition to frequently used organic solvents such as methanol (MeOH) and acetonitrile (MeCN), formamide and its derivatives were investigated. Formamide (FA) and N-methylformamide (NMF) present several interesting physico-chemical properties, one of them being a high dielectric constant (e). Since FA and NMF possess a high UV cutoff, beta-blockers with an absorbance above 250 nm were selected as model compounds in order to compare NACE-UV and NACE-MS performances. FA and NMF showed different selectivity compared to water, MeOH or MeCN, and also demonstrated a higher efficiency in terms of the number of theoretical plates (especially NMF). To overcome their unfavorable optical properties, hyphenation with MS detection appears as a promising technique, thanks to its benefits in terms of selectivity, sensitivity and universality. The practical compatibility of FA and NMF with ESI-MS detection in combination with a sheath liquid configuration was demonstrated. In comparison to UV detection, sensitivity was increased, while a high efficiency was maintained. In addition, the low and stable generated currents observed were evidences for the successful hyphenation with ESI-MS. Hence, FA and NMF seemed to be promising alternatives in NACE-ESI-MS, either used as pure organic solvent or as a mixture with MeOH or MeCN.",

A direct HPLC method was developed for the monitoring of the resolutions. Most of the screened lipases preferred the S enantiomer. Both alcohol and ester enantiomers were obtained in ee > 90% after gram-scale resolutions. A new isothiocyanato-type CDA, (1S,2S)- or (1R,2R)-1,3-diacetoxy-1-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-propyl isothiocyanate [(R,R)- or (S,S)-DANI], was designed for the indirect HPLC enantioseparation of primary and secondary amino compounds. The new reagent can be readily synthetized in optically pure form (> or = 99.5%) after a straightforward two-step synthesis. It is stable chemically and stereochemically both in the solid and in the solution phase. It is available in both enantiomeric forms, allowing the appropriate selection of the elution sequence. The kinetics of derivatization was studied in detail for alpha-amino acids and for beta-blockers. The quantitativeness of reactions was ensured by optimization of reaction conditions (pH, reagent excess, temperature). As concerns the HPLC analyses of the thiourea derivatives formed, significant differences were found between selectivities of the organic modifiers applied; in most cases, MeOH proved much more effective than MeCN with respect to both retention times and resolutions. In conclusion, the new CDA was capable of the resolution of most of the investigated analytes.",

The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of bikunin-dependent signal transduction involved in the expression of a plasminogen activator (PA) system and invasion. We report here the following. 1) The human ovarian cancer cell line HRA produced secreted and cell-associated urokinase-type PA (uPA) and PA inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). The plasma membrane of the cells showed enzymatically active uPA even in the presence of high level of PAI-1, as measured by zymography, Western blot, chromogenic assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Northern blot. 2) HRA cells leading to invasion are induced through up-regulation of uPA expression. 3) HRA cells specifically released transforming growth factor-beta type 1 (TGF-beta1) participating in an autocrine/paracrine regulation of cell invasion. 4) Elimination of endogenous TGF-beta1 could induce change in uPA/PAI-1 expression, which could in turn modify the invasive behavior of the cells. 5) The constitutive expression of TGF-beta1 as well as up-regulation of the PA system observed in HRA cells was inhibited by preinoculation of the cells with bikunin or calcium channel blocker SK&F 96365 but not with nifedipine or verapamil, with an IC(50) of approximately 100 nm for bikunin or approximately 30 microm for SK&F 96365, respectively, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bikunin showed no additive effect on SK&F 96365-mediated suppression of TGF-beta1 expression. 6) The ability of TGF-beta1 to elevate free intracellular Ca(2+), followed by activation of Src and ERK, was reduced by preincubation of the cells with bikunin. In conclusion, bikunin could inhibit the constitutive expression of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta1-mediated, Src- and ERK-dependent, PA system signaling cascade, at least in part, through inhibition of a non-voltage-sensitive calcium channel.",

This study selected propranolol hydrochloride as a hydrophilic model drug to design a transdermal delivery system. We evaluated the effect of the nature of the cross-linker on drug permeation through porcine skin and the main permeation parameters (diffusion coefficient, flux and lag time) were calculated. All the chitosan hydrogels analysed provided more transcutaneous permeation of propranolol hydrochloride than the corresponding solution of the commercial drug. Among the different chitosan vehicles, chitosan-laurate and chitosan-myristate hydrogels enhanced lyophilised drug diffusion through the skin with respect to chitosan-palmitate and chitosan-stearate hydrogels. This can been explained by the interaction of the hydrogels with the stratum corneum, increasing the solubility of the drug in the skin.",

Nevertheless, most ICD recipients receive adjunctive antiarrhythmic drug therapy to reduce the number of recurrent episodes and ICD discharges. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of metoprolol and d,l-sotalol in preventing VT/VF recurrences in patients with an ICD in a prospective, randomized trial. One hundred patients (83 men, 17 women; mean age 59 years, SD +/- 11 years) were randomized to receive metoprolol or sotalol after implantation of an ICD. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to age, sex, underlying cardiac disease, left ventricular ejection fraction, NYHA class assessment and clinical arrhythmia. The median follow-up was 728 days (25th percentile: 530 days, 75th percentile: 943 days) in the metoprolol group and 727 days (25th percentile: 472 days, 75th percentile: 1,223 days) in the sotalol group (P = 0.52). Thirty-three patients treated with metoprolol and 30 patients receiving sotalol had at least one episode during the follow-up. Event-free survival curves were generated for the two treatment arms using the Kaplan-Meier method and showed no significant difference (P = 0.68). Eight patients treated with metoprolol and six patients treated with sotalol died during follow-up. Total mortality was not significantly different between the two study groups (P = 0.43).

Electron microscopy revealed a cardiomyocyte-like ultrastructure. These cells had several types of action potentials: sinus-node-like and ventricular-cell-like action potentials. The isoform of contractile protein genes indicated that their muscle phenotype was similar to fetal ventricular cardiomyocytes. They expressed alpha 1A, alpha 1B, alpha 1D, beta 1, and beta 2 adrenergic and M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors. Stimulation with phenylephrine, isoproterenol and carbachol increased ERK phosphorylation and second messengers.

AD is characterized by deposits of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in various regions of the brain, e.g. the cerebral cortex. In the present study, we investigated the effects of PGE(2) on neuronal survival in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons. PGE(2) had no effect on neuronal cell viability or its morphology. Therefore, we examined the synergistic effects of PGE(2) with Abeta, a neurotoxin. Abeta caused neuronal cell death via apoptosis. PGE(2) significantly suppressed Abeta neurotoxicity, but did not promote the neurotoxicity. Furthermore, PGE(2) ameliorated Abeta-induced apoptotic features such as the condensation of chromatin and the fragmentation of DNA. Abeta increased the influx of Ca(2+) into neurons before cell death. Nimodipine, an inhibitor of the L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channel (L-VSCC), significantly reduced Abeta-potentiated Ca(2+) uptake. On the other hand, there was no effect on the Abeta-induced Ca(2+) influx by an N-VSCC blocker or P/Q-VSCC blockers. Moreover, the inhibitor of L-VSCC suppressed Abeta-induced neuronal cell death, whereas neither an N-VSCC blocker nor P/Q-VSCC blockers affected the neurotoxicity of Abeta. PGE(2) also suppressed the Abeta-induced Ca(2+) influx in a concentration-dependent manner. This study demonstrated that PGE(2) rescues cortical neurons from Abeta-induced apoptosis by reducing Ca(2+) influx in the primary culture. Furthermore, the present study suggested that the inhibition of L-VSCC contributes to the neuroprotective effect of PGE(2).",

The total expected costs, variceal bleeding episodes and deaths were calculated over a 1-year time horizon.",

One hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement was associated with total costs of $5015, four variceal bleeding episodes, one variceal bleeding episode-related death and 15 deaths. Two hepatic venous pressure gradient measurements were associated with total costs of $8657, four episodes of variceal bleeding, one variceal bleeding episode-related death and 15 deaths. Compared with beta-blocker therapy alone, the incremental costs per variceal bleeding episode prevented and death averted were, respectively, $108 185 and $355 100 (one hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement) and $202 796 and $719 300 (two hepatic venous pressure gradient measurements).

    "118": "The authors used high and low responders to novelty (HRs and LRs, respectively) to examine the effects of noradrenergic injections into the nucleus accumbens using a special radial-maze task. During the 5 successive test days, solvent-treated HRs acquired this task faster than LRs. Isoproterenol (beta-agonist) combined with phenylephrine (alpha-agonist) improved acquisition in LRs but not in HRs; this effect was counteracted by propranolol (beta-antagonist) and phentolamine (alpha-antagonist). Propranolol combined with phentolamine, as well as phentolamine alone, disrupted acquisition in HRs but not in LRs. Data show that the effects of noradrenergic agents in HRs and LRs are due to differences in acquisition directed by type-specific differences in functional mesolimbic noradrenaline.", 
    "119": "Class III antiarrhythmic agents have been considered to lengthen the myocardial effective refractory period (ERP) without any significant effects on the conduction velocity. However, recent investigations have clarified the positive or negative dromotropic effects of these agents. Amiodarone, a representative class III agent, exerts negative dromotropism by suppressing the fast sodium current responsible for conduction in acute administration (class I effects). Chronic amiodarone causes prolongation of ERP (class III effects), which is sometimes associated with negative dromotropism based on the alteration of passive or active membrane properties. Sotalol shows neither significant positive nor negative dromotropism under the normoxic condition, whereas this agent is reported to exert positive dromotropism mediated by the cAMP-dependent facilitation of gap junctional electrical coupling under the hypoxic condition. Some pure class III agents such as nifekalant are suspected to elicit 'apparent' positive dromotropism in the premature impulse propagation. This is explained by the right and upward shift of the strength-interval curve, which theoretically transforms the graded premature response to the all-or-none response. Although the clinical relevancy of these phenomena remains to be investigated, such variable dromotropism of the individual class III agent may contribute to the better understanding and development of antiarrhythmic agents.", 
    "120": "In this study, some compounds of phenoxypropanolamine (SWR-0342SA) derivatives were found to possess beta 3-adrenoceptor (beta 3-AR) agonistic activity. Addition and deletion of the substituents on phenoxyacetate, chain length variation between two aromatic rings, conversion of phenoxypropanolamine to phenylethanolamine, insertion of double bonds and another ether group in the side chain between two phenyl rings in SWR-0342SA derivatives resulted in novel phenoxypropanolamine and phenylethanolamine compounds. This study was performed to evaluate the structural modification of the parent SWR-0342SA and their effects on the binding affinities as well as functional activities of these derivatives using COS-7 cells and CHO cells expressing human beta 1, beta 2, beta 3-AR and only beta 3-AR respectively. Compounds SWR-0342SA, SWR-0339SA (S-enantiomer with trans-ethylidene group), SWR-0315NA (non-isomeric with racemic ethylidene group and sodium salt), and SWR-0334NA (non-isomeric with trans-ethylidene group and sodium salt), all belonging to phenoxypropanolamine group, were found to have high binding and functional activities and were supposed to be potent beta 3-AR agonists. Since many of the phenoxypropanolamine compounds acts as antagonists to beta 1- and beta 2-ARs, these derivatives have also been evaluated for their affinity to beta 1- and beta 2-ARs. The pKi values of these derivatives to beta-AR subtypes were also compared. These compounds show little selectivities towards beta 3-AR subtypes.", 
    "121": "beta-Adrenoceptor subtypes which mediate relaxation of guinea-pig gastrointestinal smooth muscles in response to catecholamines ((-)-isoprenaline, (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline) and beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists (BRL37344 and (+/-)-CGP12177A) are predominantly beta 3-adrenoceptors. Although cAMP-PKA system is thought to play a substantial role in the smooth muscle relaxation mediated via beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, there is little information on the role of cAMP in beta 3-adrenoceptor-meidated relaxation. The present study was carried out to elucidate the role of cAMP in beta 3-adrenoceptor-meidated relaxation of guinea-pig gastric fundus smooth muscle. Furthermore, possible contribution of two types of K+ (voltage-dependent and Ca(2+)-activated K+, BKCa; voltage-dependent, Kv) channels was also examined pharmaco-mechanically. In gastric fundus smooth muscle, catecholamines and beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists elicited potent relaxations in the presence of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists. All of these relaxations were not diminished by an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, SQ-22,536 (100 microM), which indicates their characteristic of cAMP-independency. SQ-22,536-resistant, beta 3-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations were strongly attenuated by a Kv channel blocker, 4-aminopyridine (3 mM), but not by iberiotoxin (100 nM), a selective blocker of BKCa channel. The present results indicate that 4-aminopyridine-sensitive Kv channels play a primary role in cAMP-independent relaxation of guinea-pig gastric fundus smooth muscle in response to the stimulations of beta 3-adrenoceptors.", 
    "122": "Smooth muscles of urinary bladder wall exhibit spontaneous rhythmic contraction which is myogenic in origin. Although the precise mechanism responsible for the generation of this mechanical activity remains to be established, it can be related closely to the action potential (AP) in urinary bladder smooth muscle (UBSM) cell, and may be the fundamental constituent to determine urinary bladder physiological functions to store and micturate urine. In the present study, possible roles of voltage-dependent and Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ (BK) channels, highly expressed in UBSM cells, were examined in the regulation of spontaneous UBSM contraction with reference to the generation of AP. Iberiotoxin (IbTx), a selective BK channel blocker, strongly increased mechanical activity and AP generation in guinea-pig UBSM. In contrast, BK channel openers (NS-1619, niflumic acid; estradiol, tamoxifen: BK channel alpha- and beta-subunit activators, respectively) significantly diminished AP generation and spontaneous mechanical activity. The present study indicates that BK channels play the primary role as a negative feedback element to limit extracellular Ca2+ influx through affecting AP configurations in the generation of UBSM contraction. BK channel openers including beta-subunit activators may be a potentially useful therapeutic remedy for the treatment of urinary bladder dysfunctions such as frequent urination.", 
    "123": "Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers have been demonstrated to improve symptoms and prognosis in heart failure (HF). We compared the effects of ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade on myocardial beta-adrenoceptor desensitization in rabbits with HF established 3 weeks after myocardial infarction (MI) with left circumflex coronary artery ligation. Rabbits with MI were randomized to no treatment, the ACE inhibitor temocapril (0.5 mg/kg/day) or AT1 receptor blocker valsartan (3 mg/kg/day). Echocardiographic examinations showed that, relative to rabbits with untreated MI, rabbits receiving temocapril or valsartan had a limitation of cardiac remodeling and prevention of the development of systolic dysfunction. Circulating plasma norepinephrine levels that were markedly elevated in MI animals were strongly inhibited by temocapril or valsartan therapy. beta-Adrenoceptor density, beta-adrenoceptor proportion showing high-affinity agonist binding, and basal and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were significantly reduced in MI rabbits. These defects were similarly reversed by temocapril or valsartan. Importantly, as found in human HF, myocardial protein levels of beta-adrenoceptor kinase 1 and G(i alpha) were significantly elevated in MI rabbits, suggesting that these molecules are contributing to the defects in myocardial beta-adrenoceptor signaling. The expression levels of these molecules were normalized equally by both treatments. The results suggest that pharmacologically different interventions in the renin-angiotensin system can equivalently improve the derangements in the beta-adrenoceptor signaling system in the failing heart. This may be important for the beneficial effects of these agents in HF.", 
    "124": "The \"in vivo\" conditions for beta3-adrenoceptors (beta-AR) activation by isoproterenol were investigated in dog. Experiments were carried out in anesthetized dogs using isoproterenol as a nonselective beta-AR agonist. Intravenous infusion of isoproterenol (0.4 nmol/kg/min) induced arterial hypotension and tachycardia with a slight decrease in cutaneous blood flow. At this dose, isoproterenol increased glucose, glycerol, and nonesterified fatty acid plasma levels. The changes in cardiovascular and endocrine-metabolic parameters, induced by the low dose of isoproterenol, were suppressed by pretreatment with nadolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.). After nadolol administration, however, a 10-fold higher dose (4 nmol/kg/min) of isoproterenol was able to induce a decrease in arterial blood pressure with a slight tachycardia and an increase in cutaneous blood flow. This high dose of isoproterenol increased nonesterified fatty acid and glycerol plasma levels but failed to change glucose plasma levels. All these effects were abolished by a pretreatment with nadolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) plus SR59230A [a selective beta3-adrenoceptor antagonist; (3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-ylaminol-(2S)2-propanol oxalate); 1 mg/kg, i.v.]. Moreover, as observed with the high dose of isoproterenol under nadolol pretreatment, an infusion of SR58611A [a selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonist; ((N2S)-7-carbethoxymethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-2-yl-(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-chlorophenyl) ethanamine hydrochloride] induces a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure associated with an increase in heart rate, cutaneous blood flow, and nonesterified fatty acid and glycerol plasma levels. These results demonstrate that the in vivo activation of beta3-adrenoceptors requires higher doses of catecholamine than those necessary for beta1- and/or beta2-adrenoceptor stimulation. These results also argue for the lack of a beta3-AR involvement in the control of heart rate and glycogenolysis in dogs.",

Studies were carried out in smooth muscle strips and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of opossum LES. Isometric tension was recorded in the basal state and after CL 316243, and before and after beta3-antagonist (S)-N-[4-[2-[[3-[-(acetamidomethyl)phenoxy]-2-hydroxypropyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl]benzenesulfonamide (L 748337) and nonselective antagonist propranolol. In some experiments, the effects of nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) nerve activation by electrical field stimulation (EFS) were also examined. The effects of CL 316243 were compared with those of nonselective beta-agonist isoproterenol. CL 316243 caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of the LES smooth muscle. The relaxant action of CL 316243 was determined to be directly at the smooth muscle because it remained unmodified by the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin and other neurohumoral antagonists, and also was observed in the SMCs. L 748337 selectively antagonized the relaxant effect of CL 316243 and, conversely, had no significant effect on the inhibitory actions of isoproterenol. CL 316243 (1 x 10(-8) M) caused an augmentation of NANC relaxation in the LES. Another beta3-agonist, (S)-4-[hydroxy-3-phenoxy-propylamino-ethoxy]-N-(2-methoxyethyl)-phenoxyacetamide (ZD 7114), also caused concentration-dependent full relaxation of the LES that was selectively antagonized by beta3-anatagonist 3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-[(1S)1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-ylaminol]-(2S)-2-propanol oxalate (SR 59230A).

The antiaggregatory activity of carvedilol decreased, depending on the stimulus used, in the following rank order of potency (in parentheses the respective mean inhibitory concentrations of carvedilol and propranolol are given in micromol/l): PMA (19 and 34) > thrombin (55 and 77) > Ca(2+)-ionophore A23187 (58 and 81) > epinephrine (86 and 118). However, aggregation of platelets activated with ADP was not affected by carvedilol in concentrations up to 100 micromol/l. In platelets stimulated with thrombin, carvedilol (10 micromol/l) reduced thromboxane B(2) formation by 64%, whereas propranolol was ineffective at this concentration. Moreover, A23187-induced formation of thromboxane B(2), not affected by propranolol, was completely blocked by 100 micromol/l carvedilol. In comparison to propranolol, the molecule of carvedilol is more lipophilic and possesses lower dipole moment and higher molar refractivity, thus penetrating into platelet membranes readily and in large quantities. The antiplatelet effect was assumed to result from interactions of carvedilol with membrane macromolecules (phospholipids, ion channels, enzymes, etc.) rather than from blockade of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors.",

The drug is administered intravenously for the management of patients with decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). In the Vasodilation in the Management of Acute Congestive Heart Failure (VMAC) study, patients hospitalised with acute decompensated CHF who received nesiritide had significantly greater mean reductions from baseline in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 3 hours after starting treatment than nitroglycerin or placebo recipients (-5.8 vs -3.8 and -2 mm Hg, respectively); all patients also received standard therapy (e.g. intravenous diuretics). Improvements in other haemodynamic parameters were also seen in nesiritide recipients. In addition, significantly more nesiritide than placebo recipients reported an improvement in dyspnoea after 3 hours' treatment in VMAC, whereas there was no significant difference between nitroglycerin and placebo recipients. Improvements in global clinical status, dyspnoea and fatigue were also seen with nesiritide in another active-comparator study and in a placebo-controlled study. In VMAC, there was no significant difference between nesiritide and nitroglycerin recipients in 6-month mortality. In the other active-comparator trial, 6-month mortality was significantly lower in recipients of nesiritide 0.015 micro g/kg/min than in dobutamine recipients (although mortality was not a prespecified endpoint and this result should be interpreted with caution). In this same study, the 21-day all-cause hospital readmission rate was significantly lower with nesiritide 0.015 micro g/kg/min than with dobutamine and the duration of active drug treatment was significantly shorter with nesiritide than with dobutamine. Nesiritide is generally well tolerated. In VMAC, significantly more adverse events occurred with nitroglycerin than with nesiritide. The most common adverse events reported during the first 24 hours of therapy in nesiritide and nitroglycerin recipients included general pain, abdominal pain, catheter-related pain, headache, nausea, asymptomatic and symptomatic hypotension, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and angina pectoris.

On the other hand, it is known that about 20% of variant angina pectoris was refractory to both nitrate and calcium channel blockers. In Japan, it has been reported that denopamine, which is an oral beta1-adrenoceptor selective agonist developed by the Japanese pharmaceutical industry (Tanabe Seiyaku), is effective in those refractory cases. To date, in Japan nine cases have been recognized of patients with vasospastic angina pectoris whose symptoms were relieved by taking denopamine, including one case in which the author has had personal experience. Eight of these nine cases were refractory, and were not relieved by combined therapy using both nitrate and a calcium channel blocker. It was also documented that denopamine was effective in cases where attacks were not relieved by prazosin or magnesium, which have been documented as effective in other refractory cases. In a study of canine coronary arteries, localization of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes was documented, with the beta1-adrenoceptor predominantly found in the conduit coronary artery. In recent years it has been emphasized that the principal role of sympathetic nerves was not associated with the constrictive action of alpha-adrenoceptors, but with the coronary dilative action of beta-adrenoceptors. It would therefore be worthwhile to determine whether denopamine is able to relieve vasospastic angina pectoris in many more cases.",

Following a 2- to 4-week run-in period on timolol twice daily, 436 patients were randomised: 140 to fixed combination therapy once daily in the morning, 147 to latanoprost once daily in the morning and 149 to timolol twice daily. During the open-label extension, patients received fixed combination drug once daily in the morning.", 
    "164": "The difference in mean change from baseline in diurnal IOP from week 2 to week 26 was -1.2 mmHg between fixed combination and latanoprost (95% confidence interval. CI: -1.8 to -0.5; P<0.001; repeated-measures analysis of covariance). The corresponding difference between fixed combination and timolol was -1.9 mmHg (95% CI -2.5 to -1.2; P<0.001). No long-term drift in IOP was detected in patients treated for 12 months with fixed combination. All treatments were well tolerated with no major differences among groups in the incidence of clinically relevant adverse events.", 
    "165": "The fixed combination of 0.005% latanoprost and 0.5% timolol administered once daily in the morning for 6 months was more effective in reducing IOP than the individual components alone and was effective over 12 months.", 
    "166": "Ventricular arrhythmia (VA) from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) is a common problem. Symptomatic patients are usually treated with beta-blockers. There is little data on the systematic evaluation of the efficacy of beta-blocker. We determine the efficacy of atenolol in the treatment of symtomatic VA from RVOT compared with placebo.", 
    "167": "This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. We prospectively studied 52 consecutive patients with symptomatic VA. Severity of symptoms, 24-hour ambulatory monitoring (AECG) and quality of life (QOL) were assessed at baseline and 1 month after atenolol. Exercise testing was performed at baseline. Average premature ventricular complex (PVC) count at baseline was 21,407 +/- 1740 beats per 24 hours, and 19% had ventricular tachycardia as measured by AECG. Results of this study showed that atenolol significantly decreased symptom frequency (P =.03), PVC count (P =.001) and average heart rate (P <.001) measured by AECG, whereas placebo significantly decreased symptom frequency (P =.002) but had no effect on PVC count (P =.78) or average heart rate (P =.44). Neither atenolol nor placebo had an effect on QOL.", 
    "168": "Atenolol improves symptoms and decreases PVC count from ambulatory monitoring. Placebo improved symptoms to the same extent as atenolol but had no effect on severity of VA. This might be the so-called placebo effect, which is a concern when treating patients or doing research on the effects of a drug.", 
    "169": "Patients with hypertension have different types of left ventricular (LV) geometry, but the impact of blood pressure (BP) reduction on LV geometry change during antihypertensive treatment remains unclear.", 
    "170": "Two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiograms were recorded at baseline in 853 unmedicated patients with stage II to III hypertension and LV hypertrophy determined by electrocardiography (Cornell voltage duration > or =2440 mV x ms or modified Sokolow-Lyon criteria: SV1 + RV5/RV6 >38 mV) after 14 days of placebo treatment. Follow-up echocardiography was done after 1 year of blinded treatment with either losartan or atenolol, in some cases supplemented with thiazide and calcium antagonist to reach target a BP of 140/90 mm Hg.", 
    "171": "Baseline systolic/diastolic BP were reduced from 174 +/- 20/95 +/- 11 to 151 +/- 19/84 +/- 11 mm Hg. LV mass was reduced from 234 +/- 56 to 207 +/- 51 g and relative wall thickness from 0.41 +/- 0.07 to 0.38 +/- 0.06 (all P <.001). Prevalence of concentric LV hypertrophy decreased from 24% to 6%, eccentric LV hypertrophy from 46% to 37%, and concentric LV remodeling from 10% to 6%; normal geometry increased from 20% to 51%. A shift toward lower LV mass and relative wall thickness was found, as approximately 73% of those with concentric LV remodeling at baseline shifted to normal geometric pattern, whereas only 7% of those with normal pattern at baseline shifted to concentric LV remodeling. Of patients with concentric LV hypertrophy at baseline, 34% shifted to eccentric LV hypertrophy, whereas only 3% with eccentric LV hypertrophy at baseline had concentric LV hypertrophy. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis showed that Doppler stroke volume reduction was a significant correlate of LV mass reduction (beta = 0.108, P <.001) independent of BP, heart rate change, and assigned drug treatment.", 
    "172": "Antihypertensive treatment reduces LV mass and decreases the prevalence of LV hypertrophy and concentric LV remodeling. Additional control of Doppler stroke volume potentiates the effect of BP reduction on LV mass regression independent of the BP reduction per se."
