During exercise, P caused a significantly higher increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCP) (15.0 +/- 4.0 to 25.3 +/- 4.0 mm Hg), than M (10.9 +/- 4.8 to 17.4 +/- 5.5 mmHg) (p less than 0.025). There was a uniform reduction of the cardiac output (CO), after P and M. P caused a reduction of the CO by a decrease in heart rate and stroke volume, M through a significantly greater decrease in heart rate (p less than 0.0005), without a change in stroke volume (p less than 0.05). The changes in PCP and stroke volume give evidence of a more negative inotropic effect of P compared to M.", 
    "1": "1-(N-hemisuccinyl-N-isopropylamino)-3-(1-naphthoxy)-2-propranolol, contaminated with a small amount of the N,O-dihemisuccinyl derivative, is formed when propranolol [1-isopropylamino-3-(1-naphthoxy)-2-propranolol] is allowed to react with succinic anhydride (pyridine, 70 degrees C, 5 hours). This conjugate, used by others for the preparation of an immunogen of propranolol for development of radioimmunoassay methodology for its sensitive quantitation, was previously assigned the O-hemisuccinate structure. The amide structure is assigned on the basis of comparison of infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral data obtained on the product of succinylation of propranolol with data from the model compounds O-acetylpropranolol, N-acetylpropranolol and N,O-diacetylpropranolol.", 
    "2": "1 The role of histamine H1- and H2-receptors in the musculature and vasculature of the dog trachea was investigated in the blood-perfused trachea in situ. 2 Histamine and acetylcholine caused increases in blood flow (tracheal, vasodilatation) and in intraluminal pressure (tracheal constriction) in a dose-dependent manner. Histamine was almost equipotent to acetylcholine in causing tracheal vasodilatation but was about 30 times less potent in causing tracheal constriction. 3 The histamine H2-receptor agonist, dimaprit, caused a dose-dependent increase in tracheal blood flow but failed to cause tracheal constriction. 4 The tracheal constriction produced by histamine was inhibited strongly by diphenhydramine but not modifed by metiamide. The tracheal vasodilatation produced by histamine was antagonized by both diphenhydramine and metiamide; diphenhydramine was more effective than metiamide. 5 It is concluded that in the tracheal musculature, histamine receptors are exclusively of the H1-type and mediate constriction, whereas in the tracheal vasculature, both histamine H1- and H2-receptors mediate vasodilatation but histamine H1-receptors are predominant.", 
    "3": "1 Propranolol increased pulmonary airway resistance (PAR) in the conscious guinea-pig, whereas atropine had no effect, suggesting the existence of a continual sympathetic bronchodilator tone. 2 The direct bronchoconstrictor effects of histamine, acetylcholine and 5-hydroxytryptamine were modified by autonomic reflexes: a bronchodilator one, abolished by propranolol, and a cholinergic bronchoconstrictor one, seen with histamine. 3 Pentobarbitone increased PAR, an effect which was reduced by propranolol but which was unaffected by atropine. The bronchoconstrictor effects of histamine, acetylcholine and 5-hydroxytryptamine were potentiated by pentobarbitone. 4 Pentobarbitone therefore appears to inhibit the adrenergic bronchodilator tone and to depress adrenergic reflexes, these being the preponderant autonomic influences in these experiments. 5 Like pentobarbitone, urethane increased PAR in the conscious guinea-pig and potentiated the bronchoconstrictor effects of the three amines. These actions are similarly attributed to a reduction in adrenergic influences.", 
    "4": "Aldehyde-fuchsin stainable secretory granules were found in the epithelium of the pyloric part of the mouse stomach. The granules are PAS-negative and nonstainable with lead hematoxylin. In intact mice only a small zone of the pylorus is engaged in production of such granules. Alpha-adrenergic stimulation causes expansion of the zone containing the granules. In mice exposed to general chilling after the propanolol injections there is a sharp extension of the zone in which the specific granules are distributed.", 
    "5": "1 The inotropic effect of penbutolol, a new beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drug, has been compared with that of propranolol in two similar groups of six subjects each. 2 Inotropic changes were assessed from changes in myocardial contractility index [LV dp-dt/11 T] as well as the slope of the regression line relating LV dp/dt to LVED during incremental pacing. 3 Penbutolol was found to have a significant negative inotropic effect of an order similar to that of propranolol in the respective doses studied.", 
    "6": "The ability of practolol and propranolol of prevent ventricular fibrillation in experimental anterior myocardial infarction was compared in dogs subjected to ligation of the left anterior descending and first septal coronary arteries. This procedure, which causes ventricular fibrillation in 90 percent of animals within 30 minutes, was performed in control dogs and in dogs pretreated with propranolol (0.5 mg/kg body weight) or with practolol (1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg). These doses produced nearly equivalent shifts in isoproterenol-induced chronotropic dose-response curves, indicating equivalent degrees of beta adrenergic blockade. In 21 dogs with confirmed ligation, cardiogenic shock did not develop. Six of seven control dogs died with ventricular fibrillation. Six of seven dogs pretreated with propranolol also had fibrillation, whereas only one of the seven dogs pretreated with practolol manifested ventricular fibrillation during the 45 minute postligation observation period. Practolol afforded significant protection compared with no treatment or treatment with propranolol (P less than 0.05).", 
    "7": "An unusual ventricular tachyarrhythmia developed in a 57 year old woman with recurrent ventricular tachycardia and toxic disopyramide plasma concentrations. The rhythm was similar to the patient's previous ventricular tachycardia, but the rate was slower and the QRS complex was markedly widened, mimicking the electrocardiographic changes associated with electrolyte abnormalities. Disopyramide, which has electrophysiologic properties similar to those of quinidine, probably caused the arrhythmia and should be added to the list of drugs associated with atypical ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "8": "We performed intracardiac electrophysiologic studies in 33 patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia. Nineteen patients underwent one, 10 patients two, and four patients three serial electrophysiologic studies. Ventricular tachycardia was successfully induced in 83% of the patients, and pacing methods were successful in terminating tachycardia in 71% of the studies, although pacing-induced acceleration of ventricular tachycardia occurred at least once in 36% of the studies. Seventeen of the 33 patients (52%) required a total of 24 external direct current cardioversions during study. In 21 patients a variety of antiarrhythmic drugs were given I.V. and attempts at ventricular tachycardia induction were repeated to assess prophylactic effects of the drugs. An acutely effective drug or combination of drugs was found in 15 of the patients (71%). Fourteen of the 15 were placed on chronic oral therapy with the effective agent and were followed for an average period of 8.1 months (range one to 33 months). In all 14 patients we could document complete (13 patients) or partial (one patient) long-term prophylaxis against ventricular tachycardia. We conclude that drug efficacy trials in patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia using intracardiac pacing techniques is a rapid and accurate method of selecting effective long-term antiarrhythmic therapy.", 
    "9": "Prazosine, a derivative of quinazoline, acts by relaxing the smooth vascular muscles and blocking postsynaptic alpha-adrenoreceptors. A special protocol was used to treat arterial hypertension in 21 subjects. A small dose (0.5 mg) was given the first day to avoid orthostatic hypotension, then 0.5 mg x 3 on days 2, 3 and 4, followed by 1 mg x 3 on subsequent days. Dosage can be progressively increased up to 30 mg/day. During the first 36 days of treatment, prazosine was given alone. A significant drop in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure was observed in the reclining subject. The effect on orthostatic pressures were nevertheless significantly lower than before initiating treatment. Prazosine induces only a slight increase plasma renin activity. In 9 patients the use of prazosine alone at 3 to 6 mg per day produced not only a drop in arterial pressure but its normalization. In 5 other patients, the administration of prazosine associated with a beta-blocker, acebutolol, induced normalization of arterial pressure. The association of prazosine with a thiazide diuretic was not considered successful. In 5 patients, treatment was interrupted with the appearance of coronary insufficiency, orthostatic hypotension and frequent headaches. Minor side-effects observed in 8 others patients did not require interruption of treatment. Based on the above results, it can be stated that prazosine is an efficient new peripheral vasodilator with good patient tolerance for the treatment of arterial hypertension.", 
    "10": "Injection i.v. of labetalol, a new adrenergic alpha- and beta-blocking agent, decreased arterial blood pressure in 9 hypertensive subjects resting in the supine position, when standing and during supine exercise. Heart rate after labetalol was unchanged in the resting supine position, and it fell in the latter two conditions. Plasma noradrenaline concentration was higher after labetalol in all three experiments as compared to a control study. Plasma adrenaline after labetalol was increased only in the standing position, when the highest plasma noradrenaline concentrations were observed. Blood glucose concentration tended to increase after labetalol, but the difference was not statistically significant. The changes in plasma noradrenaline and blood glucose after labetalol mimic findings observed after alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade. The beta-adrenergic receptor blocking property of labetalol is responsible for the reduced heart rate and it is likely to contribute to the higher plasma noradrenaline concentration observed when standing and during supine exercise.", 
    "11": "1. The technique of microelectrophoresis was used to compare the actions of octopamine, noradrenaline and dopamine on single cortical neurones of the rat. 2. Octopamine both excited and depressed neurones of the cortex. Frequently cells depressed by noradrenaline were excited by octopamine; occasionally the converse was true. The time courses of action of the two amines also differed. Dopamine-elicited excitations were observed, but also were not correlated with octopamine-elicited effects. 3. When octopamine and noradrenaline both caused depressant effects, octopamine frequently was of less apparent potency than noradrenaline. When these amines were excitatory, octopamine appeared at least as and sometimes more potent than noradrenaline. 4. Octopamine was only weakly effective on cortical neurones identified by antidromic stimulation of the pyramidal tract, or synaptically excited by stimulation of the ventrobasal thalamus. 5. alpha-Flupenthixol and propranolol were without effect on octopamine-elicited changes in firing rate at doses which were effective in blocking the actions of dopamine and noradrenaline respectively. Metoclopramide did not block the actions of any of the three agonists, but had strong effects of its own. 6. The results suggest that receptors sensitive to octopamine, and which appear to be pharmacologically distinct from those previously categorized as noradrenaline and dopamine receptors, may exist on central neurones of the rat.", 
    "12": "Twenty patients with coronary heart disease participated in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study on three study mornings to evaluate the effect of oral oxprenolol 80 mg, oral propranolol 80 mg, and placebo on left ventricular contractility. Systolic time intervals were performed in the control period and at 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300, and 360 min after medication. None of 20 patients developed adverse effects. The 80-mg doses of oxprenolol and propranolol had a negative chronotropic effect, with the resting heart rate slightly but consistently decreased more after propranolol, attaining statistical significance at 90, 150, and 300 min. That the 80-mg doses of oral oxprenolol and propranolol also induced a negative inotropic effect was indicated by a similar prolongation of the external isovolumic contraction time and pre-ejection period intervals. This equipotent dose of oxprenolol in producing a negative inotropic effect induces less resting bradycardia than propranolol.", 
    "13": "The effects of oral propranolol upon left ventricular performance were assessed in 18 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease in whom propranolol was tapered prior to elective aortocoronary bypass surgery. Left ventricular ejection fraction, ejection rate, and regional wall motion were obtained on three occasions with first-pass radionuclide angiocardiographic techniques. Patients were studied at peak propranolol dose ( +/- SEM) 224 +/- 29 mg./day; serum propranolol level, 85 +/- 22 ng./ml.), intermediate dose (99 +/- 9 mg./day; serum propranolol, 30 +/- 6 ng./ml.), and 24 hours following discontinuation of propranolol therapy. Heart rate increased significantly (62 +/- 2.3 vs 67 +/- 3.0 vs 73 +/- 2.3 beats/minute, p less than 0.001) during propranolol withdrawal, while systolic blood pressure did not change significantly (114.7 +/- 4.3 vs 110.3 +/-3.0 vs 113 +/- 3.0 mm. Hg, p greater than 0.05). There was no significant change in ejection fraction (59.1 +/- 2.4 vs 60.4 +/- 2.0 vs 59.2 +/- 2.5 per cent) or ejection rate 2.80 +/- 0.18 vs 2.87 +/- 0.18 vs 2.92 +/- 0.20 sec.-1) as propranolol was tapered (p greater than 0.05). No patient demonstrated a change in regional wall motion in response to propranolol withdrawal. The results of this study suggest that oral propranolol in commonly used clinical dosages does not significantly affect radionuclide measures of left ventricular performance in the basal state.", 
    "14": "1. In 20 subjects with uncomplicated essential hypertension, 10 of whom were on propranolol treatment, several blood samples were drawn simultaneously from the renal artery and vein after angiographic studies. In these samples we determined concentrations of noradrenaline, active renin, aldosterone and cortisol. 2. Renal blood flow was measured in all patients by Hippuran-clearance and xenon-washout. 3. Despite marked variations in the arteriovenous difference of noradrenaline, it was apparent in both groups that the kidney is able to release noradrenaline. 4. In the propranolol-treated group noradrenaline secretion with untreated hypertensive patients.", 
    "15": "1. Average supine circulating total catecholamine concentrations were found to be higher than the normal range in about 50% of patients with labile hypertension and in about 30% of patients with sustained essential hypertension. 2. These higher resting concentrations were mainly due to an increase in adrenaline in labile hypertension and to an increase in noradrenaline in sustained hypertension. 3. Patients with elevated catecholamine concentrations were also characterized by a higher heart rate, by an increased myocardial contractility and by greater hypotensive response after treatment with beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents. 4. These studies suggest the existence of sub-groups of hypertensive patients with increased sympathetic tone.", 
    "16": "1. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure show a well defined circadian variation in ambulatory hypertensive subjects. 2. Blood pressure is highest in the mid-morning (10.00 hours) and lowest during sleep at 03.00 hours. 3. Treatment with oxprenolol (taken during the day) reduces daytime blood pressure but is less effective during the night and early morning.", 
    "17": "1. A highly significant inverse relationship was found between blood pressure in untreated hypertensive subjects in late pregnancy and birth weight. 2. Reversal of this intrauterine growth retardation was achieved in 19 patients by treatment of hypertension with oxprenolol. 3. No adverse effects from oxprenolol were found in the patients or in their babies.", 
    "18": "1. 10,294 hypertensive patients were treated and followed by 2200 general practitioners under the supervision of 130 cardiologists and nephrologists. 2. The treatment groups, randomly allocated, were designated to use three distinct antihypertensive drugs, administered alone, and combined two-by-two. 3. Some 75% of patients had a supine diastolic blood pressure of less than 95 mmHg after 4 months treatment. 4. A total of 12% of patients had dropped out by 4 months from entry; no clear relationship was established between side effects and drop out.", 
    "19": "1. Dose-response curves of isoprenaline were constructed in nine hypertensive patients before and after either propranolol or metoprolol. 2. The decrease of diastolic blood pressure and increase of heart rate with isoprenaline were significantly more inhibited by propranolol than by metoprolol. 3. The increase in calf blood flow with isoprenaline was significantly more depressed after propranolol than after metoprolol. 4. The results suggest that the response of the vessels in the limbs to sympathetic stimulation is much less affected after metoprolol than after propranolol.", 
    "20": "1. Labetalol was administered to 18 hypertensive patients for an average duration of 2.44 weeks, with an average final daily dose of 1.65 g. 2. Labetalol decreased resting heart rate by 16% and maximal exercise heart rate by 21%; the phenylephrine-induced rise of systolic brachial artery pressure was reduced by 36%. 3. During labetalol brachial artery pressure was lowered by 29/15 mmHg in the recumbent position, by 41/23 mmHg at rest sitting, and by 53/23 mmHg at maximal exercise; total peripheral resistance was not significantly affected at rest recumbent, but was reduced at sitting and at exercise; cardiac output decreased in all conditions. 4. Labetalol reduced mean pulmonary artery and capillary wedge pressures only in the sitting position. Pulmonary vascular resistance remained unchanged. 5. The drug produced significant decreases of plasma renin activity and of plasma aldosterone concentration.", 
    "21": "1. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral pindolol were determined in 24 hypertensive patients with normal or impaired renal function. 2. In patients with normal renal function, the total clearance of the drug was the sum of both the renal and non-renal clearances in equal parts. The non-renal clearance was found to equal the hepatic clearance directly measured from the hepatic extraction ratio and hepatic blood flow. 3. Compared with patients with normal renal function, patients with chronic renal failure exhibited (i) unchanged transfer rate constants and distribution volumes, (ii) decreased total body clearance with decreased renal clearance and unchanged non-renal clearance. 4. Analysis of data obtained after oral administration of the drug by the Loo-Riegelman method showed that the pindolol absorption kinetic was non-linear. Compared with patients with normal renal function, patients with chronic renal failure exhibited (i) a significantly decreased fraction of dose effectively absorbed, (ii) an increased initial rate of absorption. The initial rate of absorption was inversely correlated with creatinine clearance. 5. The study provided evidence that in patients with renal insufficiency, (i) no increase in the metabolism of the drug accompanied the decrease in renal function, and (ii) decreased bio-availability was associated with a reduced fraction of the dose effectively absorbed and an increased rate of absorption.", 
    "22": "1. The cardiovascular effects of enkephalins have been tested in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. Methionine-enkephalin and leucine-enkephalin increased blood pressure and heart rate after infusion into the brain ventricles. 2. After intravenous injection, blood pressure was increased by methionine-enkephalin and leucine-enkephalin, but heart rate was increased by methionine-enkephalin only. 3. Propranolol treatment reduced the increases in blood pressure following intraventricular methionine-enkephalin and leucine-enkephalin, while only the methionine-enkephalin-induced increases in heart rate were reduced by propranolol. 4. Heart rate and blood pressure responses after intravenous administration of methionine-enkephalins and leucine-enkephalin were not affected by propranolol. 5. Since opioid peptides occur in the blood and in regions of the brain involved in blood pressure regulation, the demonstrated cardiovascular effects to intraventricular and intravenous enkephalins support a role of these peptides in central and peripheral mechanisms of blood pressure control.", 
    "23": "1. Indomethacin was administered alone or in addition to either diuretic or propranolol therapy to three groups of patients with essential hypertension on a free sodium diet. 2. Indomethacin administration reduced renin secretion by about 30% in untreated uncomplicated hypertensive patients and by about 75% in those whose renin secretion had either been stimulated or suppressed by maintained diuretic or beta-adrenoreceptor-blockade therapy. 3. Indomethacin administration produced no net effect on blood pressure in untreated patients with uncomplicated hypertension but it blunted or reversed the antihypertensive effect of either diuretic or propranolol therapy. 4. Salt and water retention may be an important factor in the blood pressure-raising effect of indomethacin during diuretic or propranolol therapy: In addition, prostaglandin synthesis may be important in counteracting increased alpha-adrenergic tone, which may limit the blood pressure-lowering effect of beta-adrenoreceptor-blockade. 5. Because of these interactions and their pressor potential indomethacin should be used with caution when combined with either diuretics or beta-adrenoreceptor blockers.", 
    "24": "1. Six essential hypertensive patients (five with low renin) were treated in successive weeks with placebo; hydrochlorothiazide 100 mg (382 micromol)/day; hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mmol of sodium/day diet; hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mmol of sodium diet and propranolol 160 mg (544 micromol)/day; and hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mmol of sodium and indomethacin 100 mg (287 micromol)/day. 2. Although blood pressure remained unchanged and serum potassium fell on diuretic with or without low salt, there was a marked increase of active renin and a lesser increase of inactive renin, resulting in an increased proportion of active to total renin. 3. Propranolol decreased both active and inactive renin, but not significantly. 4. Indomethacin produced a marked suppression of active renin, a smaller reduction in inactive renin, and a reduction of the ratio of active to total renin almost to placebo values. 5. Blood pressure rose to control values on indomethacin despite the fall in renin whereas it fell with propranolol with little change in renin. 6. Serum aldosterone rose with stimulation but remained elevated despite effective renin suppression with indomethacin and continuing reduced serum potassium concentration.", 
    "25": "1. 20 subjects with uncomplicated essential hypertension were studied, 10 of whom were on propranolol treatment. Several blood samples for determination of total and active renin were drawn simultaneously from the renal artery and vein after angiographic studies. 2. In all patients renal blood flow was measured by Hippuran-clearance at the time of blood sampling. Intrarenal blood flow was assessed by xenon-washout. 3. The results indicate that under basal conditions renin is secreted mainly in the active form, although secretion of inactive renin does occur. During propranolol treatment there is a tendency for secretion of active renin to be reduced.", 
    "26": "Adipocytes isolated from normal, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid rats were characterized with respect to their lipolytic activity (assessed by glycerol release) and beta-adrenergic receptors (assessed by binding of (--) [3H]alprenolol). Fat cells from hypo- and hyperthyroid rats showed the same affinity (K = 1.4 X 10(10) M(-1) and binding capacity (N = 1.21 X 10(-13) mol/microgram DNA) toward alprenolol as those from normal animals. Adipocytes from hypothyroid rats were unresponsive to epinephrine in a concentration range of 0.1-10 micron, with moderate responses at higher concentrations; injection of T3 in hypothyroid rats restored lipolytic responsiveness of the adipocytes to normal levels. Quabain (1 mM) inhibited lipolytic responses to epinephrine by 40--45% in normal and hyperthyroid rats; the lipolytic increment due to the hyperthyroid state was uninfluenced by ouabain. The lipolytic refractoriness to epinephrine of hypothyroid adipocytes was restored to normal levels by theophylline (1 mM) or EGTA (1 mM); the theophylline and EGTA effects were not additive, suggesting that they stimulated lipolysis via a common mechanism. Epinephrine-induced lipolysis in all groups was progressively inhibited by increasing concentrations of Ca2+ in the medium. The Ca ionophore, A23187, showed a concentration-dependent inhibitory action. Theophylline (1mM) almost completely overcame the inhibitory action of the ionophore; in the presence of lower concentrations of theophylline, the inhibitory effect of the ionophore was least in hypothyroid and greatest in hyperthyroid fat cells. The findings suggest that the differences in the lipolytic response to epinephrine observed in hyperthyroid, euthyroid, and hypothyroid adipocytes are not due to alterations in the number or affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors nor to a membrane mechanism that might show differential ouabain sensitivity, but may be related to altered cellular Ca2+ concentrations which may indirectly alter cellular phosphodiesterase activity.", 
    "27": "The effects of gastrointestinal hormones on cAMP accumulation and parathyroid hormone (PTH) release were investigated in dispersed bovine parathyroid cells. Secretin (10 (-7) M) caused a 4- to 6-fold increase in cAMP accumulation, while glucagon, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and gastrin caused little if any stimulation. Cholecystokinin caused a 2- to 3-fold increase in cAMP accumulation at 10(-6) M, but this effect may be related to contamination with endogenous secretin since synthetic cholecystokinin octapeptide had no effect. Maximal intracellular cAMP accumulation due to 10(-7) M secretin was reached within 5 min and returned to control over the next 30-60 min, concomitant with a progressive rise in extracellular cyclic nucleotide. cAMP accumulation was half-maximally stimulated by 5 x 10(-9) to 1 x 10(-8) M secretin and was unaffected by alpha- or beta-adrenergic or dopaminergic blockers. Parallel effects were noted on PTH release : 10(-8) M secretin caused a 20-50% increment in PTH release at 15 min which persisted for up to 2 h; PTH release was stimulated half-maximally by approximately 6--8 x 10(-9) m secretin. The specificity of the observed results for secretin and the lack of effect of adrenergic antagonists suggest the presence of a receptor for secretin on dispersed bovine parathyroid cells. These results also suggest the possibility that secretin may modulate parathyroid function in vivo in the cow.", 
    "28": "Pharmacological properties of adrenergic receptors have been investigated in fat cells isolated from omental adipose tissue of the Dog. From the results, the following points can be stated. 1. Lipolysis is markedly enhanced by isoproterenol. This effect is competitively inhibited by propranolol (a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent). (Fig 1). 2. The beta 2-sympathomimetic salbutamol is found to have only a slight effect on lipolysis rate (Fig. 2). 3. The epinephrine-induced lipolysis is potentiated by phentolamine (an alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent) only on large sized adipose cells (mean fat cell size 96.7 +/- 5.3 micrometer; Fig. 5). 4. The isoproterenol-induced lipolysis is partially inhibited by phenylephrine (an alpha-adrenomimetic drug) (Table I). These findings show that beta 1 nature of the receptors involved in the adrenergic control of lipolysis in Dog adipose tissue. Moreover an antilipolytic effect of epinephrine, via alpha-adrenergic receptors, is observed, especially in large adipose cells.", 
    "29": "1. Adrenaline and noradrenaline have been infused into the fetal sheep to produce plasma concentrations comparable to those seen during hypoxia. The effects have been compared with those of isoprenaline and methoxamine and the sensitivity to beta- and alpha-adrenergic antagonists has been followed. 2. Adrenaline caused an alpha-mediated increase in blood glucose that is associated with a fall in plasma insulin concentration. It also caused a beta-mediated increase in plasma lactate, free fatty acid and amino acid concentrations. 3. Noradrenaline was much less effective than adrenaline at eliciting metabolic responses. It had not cause a significant change in plasma glucose concentration, although this was associated with a small increase in plasma insulin concentration. It caused a small rise in the concentration of lactate and free fatty acids in fetal plasma but had no effect on plasma amino acids. 4. The beta- and alpha-adrenergic antagonists propranolol and phentolamine alone were without effect on any of the plasma metabolites or hormones assayed. Isoprenaline increased plasma glucose, lactate, free fatty acid, alanine and insulin concentrations, while methoxamine only increased plasma glucose and lactate, and this was associated with a fall in insulin concentration. 5. The concentration of ACTH in fetal plasma was increased by adrenaline and to a lesser extent by noradrenaline and methoxamine; these were blocked by phentolamine. Isoprenaline also caused a small increase in ACTH. There were no corticosteroid changes associated with the increase in ACTH. 6. The results have been discussed in relation to the adrenergic and pancreatic control of metabolism in the fetal sheep.", 
    "30": "Norepinephrine added in vitro to nerve ending membranes from rat cerebral cortex stimulates the activity of (Na+, K+) adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) only in the presence of the soluble brain fraction. In its absence norepinephrine inhibits the enzyme. (Mg2+)ATPase also showed stimulation by norepinephrine in the presence of the soluble fraction, but of lesser magnitude. The activation of (Na+, K+)ATPase by norepinephrine is not reproduced by cyclic AMP and is not antagonized by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic blocking agents. These results suggest that the stimulation caused by norepinephrine is a direct effect on the enzyme and is not mediated by cyclic AMP or adrenergic receptors.", 
    "31": "The maturation of the amphibian oocyte has been analyzed. Progesterone as well as organomercurials, lanthanum chloride and propranolol rapidly induce maturation. These chemicals are active only is applied on the cell surface. The mechanism seems to be an induction of the migration of Ca2+ from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm. K + may also play a role. Progesterone induced maturation involves synthesis of histone and histone kinase as well as several biologically active but chemically unidentified factors. cAMP does not seem to be directly involved, whereas protein phosphorylation is so.", 
    "32": "The rise in plasma cyclic AMP after glucagon has been studied in hyper- and hypothyroid patients before and after treatment. In the hyperthyroid group, each individual patient showed a decrease in cyclic AMP response to glucagon on becoming euthyroid, but there was no change after treatment with propranolol. In the hypothyroid group, each individual patient showed an increase in response on becoming euthyroid on thyroxine. We suggest that peak plasma cyclic AMP response to glucagon could be used to monitor tissue responisveness to thyroid hormone during treatment of hypo- and hyperthyroidism, though change in this response is a more sensitive indicator of change from the hypothyroid to the euthyroid state than from the hyperthyroid to the euthyroid state.", 
    "33": "Recent studies from this laboratory have indicated that sympathetic alpha-receptor-mediated coronary vasoconstriction can compete with local metabolic vasodilation to reduce the oxygen supply to the myocardium. In vitro studies from other laboratories on isolated coronary vessel strips suggest that large epicardial vessels are the dominant site of adrenergic alpha-receptor activity. In this study we used anesthetized, open-chest dogs to test the hypothesis that alpha-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction occurs predominantly in epicardial vessels, which are partially removed from the metabolic milieu in the myocardium. Adrenergic beta-receptor blockade was achieved by propranolol (3 mg/kg, iv). The circumflex coronary artery was pump-perfused at constant pressure to minimize passive changes in large vessel resistance. Pressure was measured at the tip of the perfusion cannula sealed in the circumflex artery, and in an apical branch of the circumflex artery. Large vessel resistance was calculated as the pressure gradient along the vessel segment divided by the coronary flow. Intracoronary injections of nitroglycerin were used as an independent measure of the vasomotor responsiveness of the large vessel segment. Adrenergic alpha-receptor activation was produced by intracoronary bolus injections of norepinephrine and by electrical stimulation of the left stellate ganglion. Alpha-receptor stimulation caused an increase in total coronary vascular resistance; however, the relative increase in the resistance of the large vessel was only about 60% of that seen for the entire coronary bed. These data suggest that, contrary to the proposed hypothesis, adrenergic alpha-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in the large coronary vessels is not proportionally greater than that observed in the total coronary vascular bed.", 
    "34": "A single dose of 5 mg of maleate of timolol given orally to glaucomatous patients, considerably lowers their I.O.P. during a period of time of at least 6 hours. It causes only a slight decrease in blood pressure and pulse rate.", 
    "35": "Three groups of patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma, who had ineluded in the previous study, had been treated with timolol twice daily for more than a year. The long-term results confirm the efficacity noted in the medium-term survey, and the absence of side-effects, especially those related to the pulse rate and blood pressure in some of the patients. Drug associations had been necessary:--pilocarpin,--acetazolamid, seem to have the best synergic action with timolol.", 
    "36": "This study included 22 patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma who were treated with either 0.25% or 0.5% timolol. The results showed that a single daily instillation of 0.25% or 0.5% timolol was effective, without producing any side-effects. It was interesting to note that timolol caused the tension peaks to disappear, the nycthemeral graph curve becoming plateau-shaped.", 
    "37": "Following a seventeen weeks study including 110 patients with open-angle glaucoma, 81,8% of the patients treated by timolol, administered twice a day, had a satisfactory control of their intraocular pressure, against only 41,8% of those patients treated by pilocarpine, administered four times a day. The side effects liable to timolol are clinically reduced, in a osit with pilocarpine which is followed by a series of well-known subjective and objective signs often causing discomfort to the patients.", 
    "38": "A double-blind medium term study of the activity of timolol in chronic open-angle glaucoma was conducted in four French ophthalmological centers, using the same protocol. A total of 119 patients were treated: --60 with timolol; --59 with \u00e9pin\u00e9phrine, for comparison. Results showed a significantly superior efficacy for timolol over \u00e9pin\u00e9phrine, after in weeks of treatment. Good tonometric control was obtained in 81.6% of the patients treated with timolol, against 52.5% of those receiving \u00e9pin\u00e9phrine. In 68% of the glaucomatons patients treated with timolol, good tonometric control was obtained with the lowest dose preparation containing 0.1%. No side-effects were noted during the study, either locally or generally (particularly blood pressure changes).", 
    "39": "A total of 45 patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma were divided randomly into three groups of fifteen. Each patient in each group was given one drop into one eye (the other eye serving as a control), of either placebo, timolol 0,5%, or timolol 1,5%. The patients were observed for a period of seven hours, and results showed that timolol was effective in reducing ocular tension when compared to placebo. It was also rapid in action (one to two hours after instillation), and no side-effects were noted. Timolol 0,5% appears to be as equally effective as the 1,5% strength.", 
    "40": "The present report reviews the animal pharmacology supporting the clinical use of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in the therapy of glaucoma and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). The studies have included the effects of timolol upon normal IOP of rabbits and upon elevated IOP in two models of experimental ocular hypertension. Comparisons are made between the latter actions of timolol and those of the reference adrenergic antiglaucoma agent, epinephrine. The interaction of timolol and the beta-adrenergic stimulant, isoproterenol, was also studied to assess the ability of timolol to block beta-adrenergic receptors in the eye. Additionally, the penetration and distribution of timolol in ocular and extraocular tissues and fluids following local application to the eyes of rabbits is described and a resume of the toxicological studies with timolol are presented.", 
    "41": "Rats were given daily injections of noradrenaline (0.5 mg/kg), alprenolol (20 mg/kg), or both together for 17 to 39 days. Noradrenaline injections increased the size of the heart, interscapular brown adipose tissue (ISBAT) and, when the injections were given at a thermoneutral environment, the metabolic activity of the ISBAT. Alprenolol injections tended to reduce the size of the heart and ISBAT and, at a thermoneutral environment, metabolic activity of the skeletal muscle. Furthermore, noradrenaline treatment improved tolerance against body cooling in water at 25 degrees C and enhanced calorigenic response to injected noradrenaline. The metabolic alterations in the rats injected with both drugs together resembled more those of the animals injected with alprenolol only than those of the noradrenaline treated rats. It can be thus concluded that alprenolol, when given together with noradrenaline, antagonized noradrenaline-induced metabolic alterations in the organism. However, the increased pressor response to infused noradrenaline, which was evident in the alprenolol treated animals, was not seen in the animals treated with both drugs. By contrast, these animals, like also the noradrenaline-treated animals, showed decreased pressor response to noradrenaline. This finding suggests that prolonged beta blockade does not abolish the decreased sensitivity of alpha-adrenoreceptors following prolonged noradrenaline load. On the other hand, the hypotonic response to a beta adrenergic drug, isoprenaline, was reduced by prolonged beta blockade despite simultaneous noradrenaline injections.", 
    "42": "The effect of hypertonic mannitol on pressor responses to vasoactive agents was studied in isolated canine coronary arteries perfused with physiologic salt solution at a constant flow. When perfusion pressure was increased with 60 mM KCl, mannitol (50 mosM) consistently caused a decrease in perfusion pressure that lasted for at least 1 h. Withdrawal of mannitol from the perfusion media was associated with a vasoconstrictor response that was not prevented by alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor blockade or by the presence of either nitroglycerin or norepinephrine. Hypertonic mannitol also reduced the responsiveness of the isolated smooth muscle preparations to several different mechanistically unrelated vasodilator agents. The mechanism(s) responsible for the paradoxical ability of hypertonic mannitol to reduce vascular responsiveness to both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator interventions in isolated canine coronary arteries is not known, but future studies should be directed at elucidating it as well as determining whether similar phenomena occur in vivo.", 
    "43": "Terbutaline sulfate, a new synthetic beta2-adrenoceptor agonist, was found to produce a dose-related increase in 59Fe-incorporation into newly formed red blood cells of exhypoxic polycythemic mice. This effect was blocked by prior treatment of the polycythemic mice with the potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, DL-propranolol. Terbutaline was also infused (i.v.) (500 microgram/kg/min) into restrained unanesthetized rabbits for a period of 5 hr with constant monitoring of arterial blood pressure and periodic blood Po2, Pco2, and pH analyses. Terbutaline was found to significantly elevate plasma erythropoietin titers in rabbits while producing a slight but nonsignificant decrease in mean blood pressure. Terbutaline did not produce a significant effect upon blood gases or blood pH. These data suggest a possible involvement of beta2-adrenoceptor activation of erythropoietin production.", 
    "44": "It can be noted, a consequently discovered and treated hypertension is one of the most important achievements of modern medicine within the last 20 years. The earlier treatment begins, the better it success of treatment in avoiding complications on the basis of arterio sclerosis and expectation of life. For elderly hypertensives it is particularly important, what is good in younger decades too - but in higher age the acute threat of life by hypertension is much more pronounced.", 
    "45": "1. Serial venous blood samples were obtained from 45 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Ten of these patients were receiving beta-adreno-receptor-blocking drugs at the time of onset of chest pain and continued on these drugs during their stay in the coronary care unit. The activities of creatine kinase and its MB-isoenzyme (CK-MB) were assayed in the plasma. A lysosomal enzyme, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, was also assayed. 2. In the 35 untreated patients it was found that creatine kinase activity was maximal at a mean time of 21.3 +/- 1.3 h after the onset of chest pain, whereas in the patients receiving beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs peak activity of the enzyme occurred at 24.4 +/- 0.7 h. 3. Peak CK-MB acitivity was also delayed from 18.1 +/- 1.6 h in the control group to 22.4 +/- 1.2 h in the treated patients. 4. The lysosomal enzyme showed a similar pattern of changes to that of CK-MB. Maximum activity in plasma occurred at 18.0 +/- 1.0 h after the onset of chest pain in the control group of patients. In the treated patients peak lysosomal enzyme activity was not found until 24.2 +/- 1.2 h. 5. These alterations in the time-course of plasma enzyme changes after acute myocardial infarction are consistent with the suggestion that beta-receptor antagonists may delay tissue damage during myocardial ischaemia.", 
    "46": "A new assay for plasma levels of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is described. The assay depends upon the ability of the drug to compete with a labelled beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol for beta-adrenoceptor binding sites on lung membranes. The assay is simple to perform, very sensitive and does not require prior extraction of plasma. The assay can also detect bioactive metabolites of these agents and is clearly not limited to a single beta-adrenoceptor antagonist.", 
    "47": "The competitive reversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity of Ro 03-5255 [1-(5-acetylaminobenzfuran-2-yl)-2-isopropylaminoethanol] upon isoprenaline-induced increases of the rate and tension of guinea-pig isolated atria is described. The chlorinated derivative [Ro 03-7894; 1-[5-chloracetylaminobenzfuran-2-yl)-2-isopropyl-aminoethanol] in contrast exhibited concentration-dependent non-competitive irreversible blocking activity as measured by depression of the maximum responses which were not restored by a washout period that successfully reversed Ro 03-5255. When orciprenaline was used as a weak agonist of low efficacy, the maximum responses were depressed to a greater extent. The blockade by Ro 03-7894 was relatively specific for beta-adrenoceptors since it did not antagonize histamine or calcium chloride. The depression of the maximum responses to orciprenaline was reduced by the presence of sodium thiosulphate. Sodium thiosulphate was ineffective in reversing an established blockade. The blockade by Ro 03-7894 was therefore assumed to involve irreversible binding to the beta-adrenoceptor after conversion to an appropriate electrophilic ligand. The significance of this is discussed.", 
    "48": "1. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline were measured in supine and upright positions in 27 essential hypertensive patients and in 12 age-matched control subjects. 2. Plasma adrenaline was markedly increased in a large proportion of patients, compared with control subjects, either in supine or in upright positions, whereas no significant differences were found in plasma noradrenaline. 3. Six hypertensive patients were chronically treated with beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agents (five with propranolol and one with pindolol). Plasma noradrenaline was not significantly changed in the supine position but was markedly increased on standing in four out of six patients. Plasma adrenaline was decreased in five out of six patients either in suprine or upright positions. 4. These findings support the view that the adrenergic system participates in the mechanism of essential hypertension.", 
    "49": "1. A study was conducted amongst 1247 treated hypertensive patients to determine the predictive power of untreated baseline and achieved treated blood pressures in the development of the complications of hypertension. In addition the relative importance of systolic and diastolic pressures was calculated. 2. Statistical analysis was done by calculating univariate differences in blood pressure between cases with and without complications. The higher the univariate distance, the greater the predictive power. 3. Blood pressures achieved during treatment were more important than baseline pressures for predicting stroke in both men and women, confirming the benefits of antihypertensive therapy in preventing strokes. 4. There was some evidence of prevention of myocardial infarction in men and of angina in women as a result of therapy. 5. There was no evidence to suggest that any one group of drugs, including beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs and thiazides, conferred any extra benefit in preventing coronary heart disease. 6. The systolic blood pressures achieved during treatment predicted stroke better than diastolic pressure, but no consistent trends were found for coronary heart disease.", 
    "50": "1. Haemodynamic responses to diazoxide (300 mg intravenously) were studied in 15 hypertensive patients before and after chronic beta-adrenoreceptor blockade by 320 mg of propranolol daily. After diazoxide alone, mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance were lowered by 24 +/- 3 and 35 +/- 5% (mean +/- SEM) respectively. Cardiac output and heart rate rose by 25 +/- 9 and 21 +/- 3%. During beta-adrenoreceptor blockade, the percentage changes of mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance after vasodilatation were not significantly different from those after diazoxide alone. 2. Atropine, 0.04 mg/kg body weight, was given to 12 hypertensive patients chronically treated with beta-adrenoreceptor blockade, before acute vasodilatation by diazoxide. Diazoxide caused no increase in heart rate after combined beta-adrenoreceptor and parasympathetic blockade. However, cardiac output rose by 14 +/- 5%. 3. We conclude that withdrawal of parasympathetic tone is an important determinant of circulatory homeostasis after acute vasodilatation during beta-adrenoreceptor blockade.", 
    "51": "1. Chlorothiazide twice a day plus atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol and propranolol in single daily doses administered to patients with essential hypertension achieved effective control of blood pressure. 2. Each beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drug was associated with small, but significant, increases in plasma triglyceride concentrations and suppression of fasting immuno-reactive glucagon concentrations.", 
    "52": "1. Eight hypertensive patients with angina pectoris had placebo added to their existing medications for 8 weeks, then incremental doses of active labetalol with simultaneous stepwise reduction in other medicines until blood pressure was satisfactorily controlled; after that only labetalol and thiazide (8 weeks) and finally labetalol-placebo together with previous beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists and thiazide for 4 weeks were administered. 2. During the labetalol plus thiazide period resting blood pressures and measurements obtained during isotonic exercise, isometric exercise and the cold pressor test were significantly lower than during the initial placebo addition period. Angina scores were significantly reduced during this period. 3. During the final treatment with placebo, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist and thiazide, blood pressures remained reduced, but angina was significantly worse. 4. Labetalol which antagonizes both alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors produced better relief of angina pectoris than beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists during improvement in blood pressure in hypertensive patients.", 
    "53": "Treatment of 6 healthy adult men with a beta-blocker, timolol, resulted in a rise in serum phosphate which was maintained for the 5 days of therapy. This rise was accompanied by a transient fall in urine phosphate and a rise in the tubular maximum for phosphate reabsorption per unit glomerular filtration rate (TmPO4/GFR). No change in circulating parathyroid hormone or growth hormone could be demonstrated.", 
    "54": "The ocular penetration of topically applied [14C]-atenolol in the rabbit was determined by means of liquid scintillation counting. Only one eye was treated, the fellow eye serving as a control. Blood plasma levels were measured as well. The absolute amount of atenolol which penetrated the eye was very low, but a relatively high concentration was achieved in the tissues of the nictitating membrane. We could only detect an increase in the amount of atenolol with time in the aqueous humor. In all other ocular tissues, including iris and ciliary body, the atenolol level remained constant with time. Hardly any atenolol could be detected in the untreated eye and none in the blood plasma. These findings suggest that the ocular penetration of atenolol administered as an eye drop is very poor. Ocular penetration, therefore, hardly seems to play a part in the antiglaucomatous effect of atenolol.", 
    "55": "The duration and extent of the reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia, as a measure of cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade were studied in 12 healthy volunteers after administration of single oral doses of pindolol 15 mg (Visken) or 160 mg slow release oxprenolol (Slow-Trasicor). The mean maximum effect was reached after 1.6 +/- 0.3 h with pindolol and after 2.5 +/- 0.2 h with slow release oxprenolol. The reduction in heart rate during exercise was virtually identical after both drugs, amounting to -36.1 +/- 1.7 beats/min after pindolol and -36.3 +/- 1.6 beats/min after slow release oxprenolol. The duration of action of pindolol, however, was clearly longer than that of slow release oxprenolol: after 24 h pindolol still exerted 39.6 +/- 5.6% of its maximum activity, as against 22.1 +/- 3.6% for slow release oxprenolol.", 
    "56": "Propranolol was administered in a single dose of 80 mg, 120 mg, 160 mg, 240 mg, or 320 mg, to 23 patients with essential mild to moderate hypertension in a randomised, double-blind cross-over study. All treatments produced a significant fall in lying and standing blood pressures compared with placebo, but there was no statistically significant difference in the effects of the different doses. The percentage of patients showing a satisfactory fall in blood pressure was not different in the five treatment groups. The major anti-hypertensive effect of each dose was present by two weeks. The frequency of side-effects were similar on all the doses.", 
    "57": "Histochemical studies of some myocardial oxido--reductive enzymes after a beta--adrenergic blockade with propranolol have been carried out. Succinate, isocitrate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases did not indicate any changes in activity, whereas the changes in reaction intensities concerning NADH and NADPH tetrazole reductases and glutamate dehydrogenase have rather a transitory and reversible character. Only lactate dehydrogenase showed an increase in the enzymatic activity which speaks for an increase in the glycolysis process in the heart muscle. In the light of our own presented research results we assume that the experimental beta--adrenergic blockade of the heart muscle in rats does not evoke more important enzymatic changes which are noticeable in histochemical microscope examination."
