    "0": "1. The effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulating agents were investigated on three different kinds of preparation of the isolated sphincter of Oddi and on the duodenum of the cat.2. Adrenaline (1.5 x 10(-7)M-6.3 x 10(-7)M), noradrenaline (1.6 x 10(-7)M-6.3 x 10(-7)M), and tyramine (2.9 x 10(-6)M-5.8 x 10(-6)M) increased the activity and tonus of the sphincter musculature and decreased duodenal activity and tone. The effect on the sphincter resulted in increased resistance to flow through the sphincter. The excitatory effects on the sphincter were blocked by phenoxybenzamine (1.7 x 10(-8)M-1.7 x 10(-7)M).3. No effect was produced by tyramine in concentrations up to 4.6 x 10(-5)M on sphincters taken from reserpinized cats. It is suggested that the cat sphincter of Oddi contains adrenergic nerves of functional importance.4. Isoprenaline (1.9 x 10(-8)M-4.7 x 10(-7)M) and terbutaline (3.5 x 10(-7)M-8.8 x 10(-6)M) decreased spontaneous activity and tonus of the sphincter, and diminished resistance to flow through the sphincter. Both agents decreased spontaneous activity and tonus of the duodenum. On a molar basis, isoprenaline was 2-18 times more active than terbutaline on the sphincter and 35-90 times more active on the duodenum. The effects of isoprenaline and terbutaline were blocked by propranolol (3.9 x 10(-7)M).5. It is concluded that the cat sphincter of Oddi contains alpha-adrenoceptors active in contraction of the sphincter, and beta-adrenoceptors active in its relaxation. The beta-adrenoceptors of the sphincter differ from those in the duodenum; it is suggested that they belong to the beta(2)-group (according to Lands' classification).6. The automaticity of the isolated sphincter of Oddi resembled the sphincter activity recorded in vivo and is probably myogenic in nature, as it resisted treatment with phenoxybenzamine (1.7 x 10(-8)M-1.7 x 10(-7)M), atropine (1.4 x 10(-6)M-5.8 x 10(-6)M), hexamethonium (1.4 x 10(-5)M-1.1 x 10(-4)M) and tetrodotoxin (1 mug/ml). The activity of the sphincter has no propulsive function but prevents passage of fluid through the sphincter.", 
    "1": "1. In isolated perfused guinea-pig hearts, isoprenaline (2 x 10(-8) g/ml) reduced the negative chronotropic responses to vagal stimulation and to exogenous acetylcholine.2. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist LB46 (2 x 10(-8) g/ml) abolished the effect of isoprenaline in reducing vagal bradycardia. LB46 itself did not alter the responses to vagal stimulation.3. Increase in (86)Rb efflux induced by acetylcholine was not affected by isoprenaline.4. Aminophylline (2.3 x 10(-4) g/ml) almost abolished the negative chronotropic effect of vagal stimulation.5. The ;antivagal' effects of isoprenaline and aminophylline may be at a common site beyond the level of the cardiac beta-adrenoceptors, perhaps related to cyclic-3',5'-AMP and/or sodium transport.", 
    "2": "1. Field stimulation of desheathed preparations of guinea-pig vas deferens, treated with a ganglion-blocking agent, has revealed the presence of two tetrodotoxin-susceptible components in the motor response, suggesting the existence of two sets of post-ganglionic motor nerve fibres of different excitability: one set responding maximally to pulses of 0.1-0.4 msec; the other, to pulses of 2 msec. No distinction could be made pharmacologically between the two components.2. Cooling potentiated that component in the twitch-responses which was due to stimulation of the more excitable fibres.3. The sensitivity of the longitudinal muscle to the motor action of noradrenaline was low and was subject to considerable animal variation. But normal responses to post-ganglionic field stimulation were elicited in noradrenaline-insensitive preparations, in which the twitches elicited by 5 pulses could not be matched with noradrenaline, even 100-125 mug/ml.4. In some forty experiments, small doses of noradrenaline inhibited the twitch-responses evoked by either set of motor fibres. This inhibition differed from that produced by isoprenaline in two respects. Firstly, propranolol did not antagonize the noradrenaline inhibition, thus excluding an action on beta-adrenoceptors; and secondly, noradrenaline did not depress contractions elicited by muscarine or by 5-methylfurmethide.5. Phenoxybenzamine, 10(-6) g/ml., produced a thousandfold reduction in the sensitivity of the muscle to the motor action of noradrenaline, without any decrease in the height of the twitches elicited by 0.1 or 1 msec pulses.6. The twitch-responses were not affected by combined alpha + beta adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine and propranolol.7. Tyramine, amphetamine, tranylcypromine and prostaglandin E(2) inhibited the twitches but potentiated the contractile effect of noradrenaline.8. The twitch-responses and their inhibition by noradrenaline were present in preparations taken from reserpinized animals.9. Although the twitch-responses could be paralysed by bretylium or guanethidine, the foregoing results excluded adrenergic transmission at the motor endings. Cholinergic transmission was also excluded by negative findings with anticholinesterases, atropine, nicotine and (+)-tubocurarine.10. Motor transmission by histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid or ATP was also excluded.", 
    "3": "1. Effects of the natural stimuli of cold exposure and feeding on heart rate were tested in conscious sheep in which blockade of the cardiac efferent nerves was achieved by administration of propranolol and atropine. Effects of direct nerve stimulation, isoproterenol and angiotensin on heart rate before and after autonomic blockade were studied in acute preparations anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium.2. Propranolol reduced the extent of cardioacceleration induced both by exposure to cold and by eating. Heart rate in propranolol treated animals exposed to cold did not exceed about 120 beats/min. During eating, heart rate in propranolol treated animals showed no upper limit and increased on occasions to over 170 beats/min.3. Heart rate in conscious sheep following administration of atropine and propranolol was about 110 beats/min; in anaesthetized sheep following vagal section and propranolol it was usually about 120 beats/min. This was taken as intrinsic heart rate.4. Angiotensin administered to normal anaesthetized sheep usually reduced heart rate. After vagal section and propranolol, angiotensin injection usually, and angiotensin infusion invariably, increased heart rate.5. It was concluded that there exists in sheep a mechanism which during eating elevates heart rate by a means other than through the parasympathetic and sympatho-adrenal systems. It is suggested that this mechanism involves a direct chronotropic effect of angiotensin secreted in association with eating.", 
    "4": "After inhaling fluoroalkane gases, which are used as aerosol propellants, some people have died suddently and unexpectedly. Seeking an explanation, we had 14 monkeys inhale these gases. All developed ventricular premature beats, bigeminy, or tachycardia, which began at an average of 39 (SE +/-4.2) sec. Fluoroalkanes were present in blood, but arterial hypoxemia or hypercapnia was absent, and arterial pressure was reduced only slightly. In contrast, without fluoroalkanes, 3 min of asphyxia or anoxia caused arrhythmias in only one monkey whose arterial oxygen tension had fallen to 16 mm Hg. The ventricular arrhythmias caused in well oxygenated monkeys by fluoroalkane gases may either be mediated through beta adrenergic receptors, since propranolol abolished these arrhythmias, or result from a nonadrenergic, direct, toxic effect of these gases on the heart. These results suggest that some deaths after propellant inhalation may be caused by ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.", 
    "5": "Milk fed by stomach tube to 2-week-old rats separated from their mothers without feeding for 16 hours transiently but fully reversed the decrease in cardiac rate which had occurred during separation. This effect was rapid in onset and was related to dosage; it was not dependent upon gastric distention, but did depend upon beta-adrenergic transmission.", 
    "6": "1. The effects of intravenous infusions of quazodine (6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethylquinazoline; MJ-1988) on myocardial blood flow, myocardial metabolic heat production and on general haemodynamics have been studied in cats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone.2. Quazodine (0.25 and 0.5 (mg/kg)/min for 10 min) decreased diastolic blood pressure, peripheral vascular resistance, systolic ejection time and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Heart rate, cardiac effort, output and external work and left ventricular dP/dt were markedly increased. These changes are indicative of increased myocardial contractility and peripheral vasodilatation.3. In a dose of (1.0 mg/kg)/min, quazodine had a more marked hypotensive effect, systolic pressure being significantly reduced, and had less effect on left ventricular dP/dt and cardiac effort. Calculated external cardiac work was slightly reduced and there were very occasional nodal arrhythmias.4. Changes in heart rate, aortic dP/dt and diastolic blood pressure induced by quazodine were unaffected by the previous administration of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent alprenolol in a dose (1.0 mg/kg) which abolished the effects of isoprenaline.5. In all doses, quazodine markedly increased local blood flow (by 70-540%) around an implanted myocardial heated thermocouple recorder. ;Corrected temperature', an index of local myocardial metabolic heat production, was almost unchanged and it is suggested that increased myocardial contractility, occurring with unchanged metabolic heat production and oxygen consumption, probably results from a concomitant decrease in intramural wall tension."
