In contrast, beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (2 mg/kg) caused an increase in Qlym from a base-line value of 7.7 +/- 2.2 ml/h to a steady-state value of 10.6 +/-2.3 ml/h within 2 h (P less than 0.05), which was not associated with a change in Ppa. The increase in Qlym persisted for the 4-h duration of the study. The 39% increase in Qlym after propranolol was associated with a 50% increase in transvascular protein clearance (CL), whereas in control animals the 100% increase in Qlym after left atrial hypertension was associated with only a 36% increase in CL, indicating increased transvascular transport of proteins after propranolol. The transient decrease in Qlym after phentolamine may be due to the short-lasting decreased in pulmonary microvascular pressure and vascular surface area. However, the long-lasting increases in Qlym and CL after propranolol may be due to an increase in vascular surface area and to an increase in endothelial permeability of proteins. The results suggests that beta-adrenergic receptors regulate the transendothelial transport of fluid and proteins.", 
    "1": "Penbutolol is a non-selective beta-blocking drug with 'moderate' intrinsic sympathomimetic (partial agonist) properties, and a relatively narrow dose-response range. In many other aspects its pharmacological profile resembles that of propranolol. Significant beta-blockade, as demonstrated by reduction in heart rate during exercise in healthy subjects, persists for at least 24 hours after penbutolol administration, and thus the recommended dosage schedule in both hypertension and angina involves single daily doses (20 or 40mg daily) in most patients, with a divided dose (40mg twice daily) if a higher dose is needed. However, most angina prophylaxis studies to date have not been designed to clearly demonstrate that the beneficial effects of beta-blockade with a single dose of penbutolol extend throughout a 24-hour dosing interval. Further studies are needed to provide such evidence. As might be expected, penbutolol appears to be about as effective as usual doses of propranolol in both mild to moderate hypertension and in angina, but much of the clinical experience with the drug is in unpublished form and is thus somewhat difficult to evaluate in detail. The choice of a beta-blocking drug should be based on a knowledge of the characteristic pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the individual drugs within this group, and on careful consideration of how these properties might be used to benefit the individual patient. As is the case with most other beta-blocking drugs, penbutolol has some specific properties (e.g. relatively narrow dose-response range minimising the difficulty of dose titration, moderate intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) which may be used to advantage in certain patients.", 
    "2": "The action and interaction of topical 2% epinephrine hydrochloride and 0.5% timolol maleate therapy were studied in 12 normal and 16 ocular hypertensive subjects. Measurements of intraocular pressure, outflow facility, and aqueous secretion by fluorophotometry were made. Uveoscleral outflow values were calculated. Epinephrine, applied topically twice daily for one week, resulted in a decrease in IOP of 3.3 +/- 0.9 mm Hg and an increase in outflow facility of 0.05 +/- 0.01 microL/min/mm Hg, as well as an increase in the rate of aqueous production of 0.32 +/- 0.09 microL/min. Uveoscleral outflow showed an increase of 0.83 +/- 0.23 microL/min. Timolol, applied topically twice daily for one week, reduced the IOP 3.9 +/- 1.0 mm Hg and decreased aqueous flow 0.84 +/- 0.23 microL/min, but produced no change in outflow facility or uveoscleral flow. When epinephrine and timolol are given in combination, the effects in lowering IOP may not be completely additive.", 
    "3": "In 140 patients with chest pain quantitation of regional myocardial TI-201 activity was performed by serial scintigraphic images after treadmill exercise. Criteria for an abnormal thallium scintigram included: (a) greater than or equal to 25% persisted reduction in TI-201 uptake in anterolateral, anteroseptal, posterolateral, and inferoapical segments, or greater than or equal to 35% reduction in the inferior segment; (b) an initial defect with delayed redistribution; and (c) abnormal TI-201 washout. Of 110 patients with significant coronary artery disease (CAD), 100 had abnormal TI-201 scintigrams, while 27 of 30 patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries had normal scintigrams; 91% sensitivity, 90% specificity, and 97% predictive accuracy. Sensitivity and specificity were not significantly different when the 95 patients with diagnostic (greater than or equal to 85% maximum heart rate) and 45 with inconclusive (less than or equal to 85% maximum HR) Ex tests were compared. Comparison of qualitative and quantitative image analyses in a subset of these patients showed that both specificity and multivessel disease prediction were greater when the quantitative approach was used (90 against 73% and 78 against 39%, respectively). Sensitivity for CAD detection was reduced by 10% with visual interpretation alone. Thus, quantitative exercise TI-201 scintigraphy appears highly sensitive and specific for CAD detection in patients with chest pain.", 
    "4": "The diminished cardiac output response to exercise with advancing age may be attributable to intrinsic inability of the old ventricle to respond appropriately and/or to an additional loading imposed upon the ventricle by the aged vascular system. The steady (resistance) and pulsatile (characteristic impedance) load components together comprise the vascular load faced by the ejecting ventricle. To study the effect of exercise on both vascular components of load, the aortic input impedance was measured in chronically instrumented young and old beagle dogs during graded treadmill exercise before and after beta blockade. Ascending aortic flow was measured by a cuff electromagnetic flow probe, and pressure was measured by a high-fidelity semiconductor transducer. At low levels of exercise the old animals demonstrated a striking 20% increase in characteristic impedance and a 28% decrease in peripheral resistance with no increase in stroke volume. This vascular loading and limitation in stroke volume persisted across the higher exercise levels. In contrast, the young group demonstrated no increase in characteristic impedence, a progressive decrease in peripheral resistance, and a progressive increase in stroke volume across the same exercise levels. These age differences in vascular response and ventricular output were abolished by beta blockade. The groups did not demonstrate a difference in heart rate response, but the young had a greater increase in external left ventricular power than the old across exercise. These data demonstrated a profound difference in the response of young and old vasculature to exercise. At low and intermediate exercise levels the pulsatile vascular load appeared to be a major factor in the limitation of stroke volume in old dogs. At high levels of exercise, the limited exercise response in the old dog may be caused in part by a diminished inotropic responsiveness as well as by the vascular loading.", 
    "5": "Adenosine levels in oxygen-deprived myocardium can rise to 10- 100 microM concentrations known to cause atrioventricular (AV) conduction delay and block. We reported that the AV conduction delay and block caused by hypoxia is markedly attenuated by 10 microM aminophylline, and adenosine competitive antagonist. THe purpose of the present study was to investigate adenosine's role in ischemic AV conduction disturbances. Dogs were anesthetized and instrumented for His bundle and surface electrogram recordings. The total AV conduction time was subdivided in to atrial-His bundle (AH) and His bundle-ventricle intervals. The atrioventricular node artery (AVNA) was cannulated for selective injection of drugs in the AV node region. Adenosine (10 to 100 microgram), as a 2-ml bolus injection, rapidly produced a dose-dependent, transient increase in the AH interval; a 1,000-microgram dose caused second degree AV block. The duration of the increase in AH interval was also dose-dependent. Dipyridamole, and inhibitor of nucleoside transport, potentiated the negative dromotropic effects of adenosine, whereas aminophylline attenuated them. In some dogs, after cannulation of the AVNA, first and second degree AV block occurred spontaneously or were induced by rapid atrial pacing. Injection of the aminophylline (5 mg/kg, i.e.) or theophylline (100-1,000 microgram) into the AVNA rapidly reversed the AV blocks. Upon washout of the drugs the AV blocks recurred. We conclude that endogenously released adenosine may account for a major fraction of the AV conduction delay and block associated with impaired blood supply to the AV node, and the theophylline and aminophylline reverse the AV conduction defect by antagonizing the effects of adenosine.", 
    "6": "Sixty-eight determination of in vivo insulin resistance were conducted in 35 males (aged 29-63 yr) by measurement of steady-state plasma glucose levels during a combined intravenous infusion of propranolol, epinephrine, glucose, and insulin. Subjects were mildly diabetic and/or hyperlipidemic. All were asymptomatic, denied taking medication, and had no history of cardiac disease. All had normal resting electrocardiograms. During the infusion, mean increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 27 +/- 12.2 (x +/- SD) and 14 +/- 5.7 mm Hg, respectively; mean reduction in heart rate was 19 +/- 6.1 beats/min. Six out of the 35 subjects developed cardiac arrhythmias during the infusion test. Maximal exercise treadmill tests failed to predict all subjects who subsequently developed arrhythmias during the infusion test. These results suggest that this infusion test should be performed under continuous cardiac monitoring and promptly terminated if major arrhythmias develop.", 
    "7": "A 59-year-old patient with acute pancreatitis is described, whose treatment was complicated by concomitant diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension. He received propranolol and insulin without subsequent problems; however, when the insulin was changed to chlorpropamide, a significant increase in blood sugar occurred. It was postulated that this increase in blood sugar was due to an antagonistic action of propranolol at the pancreatic level which interfered with the action of chlorpropamide.", 
    "8": "The plasma protein binding of propranolol and warfarin was studied in vitro by ultrafiltration in hyper- and hypothyroid patients both before and after treatment. The degree of binding of propranolol was significantly decreased in hyperthyroid patients and increased in hypothyroid patients, and was negatively correlated with serum thyroxine and the free thyroxine index. The plasma protein binding of warfarin was also decreased in hyperthyroid patients, but was unchanged in hypothyroid patients. These results suggest that the binding of both acidic and basic drugs may be altered by thyroid disease.", 
    "9": "1 The reduction in the sympathetic efferent discharge observed after propranolol may be due to either a central or a peripheral effect. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, atenolol, is not thought to enter the brain and therefore any reduction in the level of sympathetic efferent discharge observed after atenolol is likely to be mediated peripherally rather than centrally. 2 Cats were anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose and artificially ventilated and a number of variables known to affect the sympathetic nerves were monitored throughout the experiment and maintained within normal limits. Recordings were made from few fibre preparations from the lumber trunk and the renal nerves. Blood pressure was either raised or lowered by the injection of phenylephrine (1-4 microgram/kg) or glyceryl trinitrate (2-20 microgram/kg) and the sympathetic efferent discharge was recorded over a range of blood pressures when the blood pressure was steady. 3 Thirty min after giving atenolol (3 mg/kg) the blood pressure, heart rate and sympathetic efferent discharge were significantly reduced. Atenolol also attenuated the reflex responses of the sympathetic nerves to changes in the blood pressure. 4 It is suggested tht atenolol has its actions on sympathetic nerves at a site outside the CNS and some possible mechanisms are discussed.", 
    "10": "The effect of terbutaline, a beta2-adrenoceptor stimulator, on the vascular resistance of isolated human placenta was examined. Terbutaline produced no change in basal placental vascular resistance, but when the placental vessels were constricted with angiotensin, terbutaline produced a graded decrease in vascular resistance. The vasodilating effect of a high dose of terbutaline was smaller than the effect 20 microgram of isoprenaline and the effect was significantly blocked by propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. The results suggest that the vasodilating effect of terbutaline on the fetal placental circulation can play a role in the improvement of fetal condition during treatment of premature labour and intrapartum fetal distress.", 
    "11": "Experiments were designed to determine whether or not calcitonin, parathormone, and glucocorticoids have direct effects on the vascular smooth muscle cells of bone blood vessels. Tibias of mongrel dogs were isolated. The arteria nutriens was cannulated and perfused at constant flow with aerated Krebs-Ringer solution (37 degrees C). The perfusion pressure was continuously recorded. In unstimulated preparations calcitonin caused dose-dependent increases in perfusion pressure, indicating that it causes constriction of bone blood vessels. Parathormone did not affect basal perfusion; it did not significantly alter vasoconstrictions caused by the injection of norepinephrine indicating that the hormone has no direct effect on the vascular smooth muscle of bone blood vessels. Hydrocortisone, at low concentrations, augmented the constrictions caused by exogenous norepinephrine and periarterial nerve stimulation; at higher concentrations, hydrocortisone caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the response to adrenergic activation. The depressant effect of hydrocortisone was antagonized by propranolol, suggesting that the glucocorticoid facilitates beta-adrenergic relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle cells by catecholamines.", 
    "12": "Systolic time intervals, echocardiographic indexes of left ventricular contractile function and serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels were measured before treatment in nine patients with hyperthyroidism, and again every 2 weeks for the first 2 months after therapy and then every 4 weeks until the subjects were clinically and chemically euthyroid. Six of the nine became transiently hypothyroid. Although the preejection period corrected for heart rate (preejection period index) increased as the patients became euthyroid, the change was not significant. Preejection period index increased dramatically in the patients becoming hypothyroid (p less than 0.005). Corrected left ventricular ejection time (left ventricular ejection time index) also increased as the patients became euthyroid (p less than 0.001), and increased again with the appearance of hypothyroidism (p less than 0.05). There was a linear correlation between velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and serum triiodothyronine level (r - 0.77) and between velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and serum thyroxine level (r = 0.70) at all stages of thyroid function. Thus thyroid hormone definitely enhances left ventricular function in human beings, and both excess and deficiency cause predictable reversible changes in myocardial contractile function. Thus thyroid hormone definitely enhances left ventricular function in human beings, and both excess and deficiency cause predictable reversible changes in myocardial contractile function. Furthermore echocardiographic measurements of velocity of circumferential fiber shortening provide rapid estimates of the chemical status of thyrotoxic patients before and after treatment.", 
    "13": "Renal function studies were performed in subjects with mild hypertension treated with labetalol (n = 5) and moderate to moderately severe hypertension treated in a random double-blind fashion with either labetalol (n = 6) or methyldopa (n = 6). Drugs were given in doses sufficient to reduce standing diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg. This was achieved in all subjects without significant side effects. Inulin clearance, para-aminohippurate clearance, filtration fraction, free-water clearance, and maximal concentrating ability was assessed before and after 15 days of drug. No alterations in any parameter were noted with labetalol. Inulin clearance fell by 13% (p less than 0.05), and filtration fraction fell from 0.23 to 0.18 (p less than 0.02), but other parameters of renal function did not change with methyldopa.", 
    "14": "Ticrynafen (TCNF), a nonthiazide diuretic, has been reported to be nonhyperlipidemic. To define the effects of these drugs on plasma lipoproteins, experiments were performed in hypertensive subjects after placebo therapy, 4 wk after therapy with either hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or TCNF, 3 mo after diuretic with propranolol, and 1 mo after therapy with propranolol alone. Plasma lipoproteins were separated by ultracentrifugation and the lipid fractions isolated by extraction and silicic acid thin-layer chromatography. Plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) total cholesterol fell and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) total cholesterol rose in subjects receiving TCNF. TCNF had no effect on plasma low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride or phospholipid. There was no significant changes in LDL or HDL total cholesterol in subjects on HCTZ. HCTZ tended to increase plasma VLDL triglyceride and phospholipid. The addition of propranolol to either diuretic had no effect on LDL or HDL total cholesterol but increased VLDL triglyceride, especially in subjects on HCTZ. Propranolol alone had no effect on any of the lipids measured.", 
    "15": "A previously reported patient with analbuminemia was re-investigated after 4 1/2 years, at age 6. The serum albumin concentration was 150 mg/L by radioimmunoassay. Most of the observed increase in total plasma protein over the 4 1/2 years was attributable to gamma-globulin. Concentrations of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were increased; the esterified:free ratio and the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity were both normal. Albumin is apparently not essential for binding of lysolecithin generated by the acyltransferase-catalyzed reaction. The binding of bromphenol blue suggested that analbuminemic serum has about 25% of normal binding capacity for bilirubin (more than expected in a patient with analbuminemia), which may explain why newborns with this disorder do not develop kernicterus. Binding by the patient's plasma of diazepam (1020 mg/L) and warfarin (1040 mg/L), which bind primarily to albumin, as well as of propranolol (1.05 g/L), which binds primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, was also studied. The proportions of free diazepam (14.4%) and warfarin (4.8%) were about 10-fold normal. In contrast, the proportion of propranolol in the free form was decreased (4.5%). Evidently, other plasma proteins are partly compensating for the deficiency of albumin.", 
    "16": "The effect of catecholamines and atrial pacing on the relationship between electrical systole (QT) and mechanical systole (QS2) was studied in 12 normal subjects and in 32 patients. The studied subjects were divided into three groups. Group 1 included 12 normal subjects in whom serial isoproterenol infusions were performed before and after oral propranolol administration, 160 mg daily for 2 days. During the 24-hour control period, the QT was always shorter than the QS2 (from 14 +/- 3 to 19 +/- 4 msec, p less than 0.01), while during isoproterenol infusion the QT was always greater than the QS2 (from 28 +/- 5 to 34 +/- 5 msec, p less than 0.01). Group 2 included 26 patients in whom 24-hour urinary epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) were measured the same day as systolic time interval measurements. The E + NE was higher in patients in whom the QT was longer than the QS2 compared with patients in whom the QT was the same or shorter than QS2 (107 +/- 9 vs 61 +/- 7 microgram/24 hours, p less than 0.05). Group 3 included six patients in whom the heart rate was increased with atrial pacing, from 80 to 130 beats/min. The QT was always shorter than the QS2 (from 13 +/- 3 to 24 +/- 5 msec, p less than 0.01). Adrenergic stimulation results in a relative prolongation of the QT with the QS2 shortening and the QT remaining unaffected. The QT is normally shorter than the QS2, so the duration of QT should always be considered in relationship to the duration of QS2. Finally, a reversal of the normal QT-Qs2 relationship may provide a simple index of increased adrenergic activity.", 
    "17": "IHSS is a familial illness with a significant and frequently lethal effect on cardiac function. Diagnosis can be made on clinical grounds and by echocardiography, and is confirmed by cardiac catheterization. High-dose beta -adrenergic blockade may control symptoms but does not give complete protection against fatal arrhythmias. Surgery may be required. A new class of drugs, calcium antagonists, will soon be marketed in this country and could provide more effective therapy for IHSS.", 
    "18": "Specific antisera against oxprenolol, a beta adrenoceptor blocking agent, were produced in rabbits immunized with oxprenolol hemiglutarate-bovine serum albumin conjugate. The antiserum, beta galactosidase labelled oxprenolol and 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactoside as substrate were used to develop an enzyme immunoassay for oxprenolol. The assay can reliably detect as little as one ng of oxprenolol directly from plasma. The plasma concentrations of oxprenolol in spontaneously hypertensive rats were determined by an enzyme immunoassay after a single and multiple oral doses for 14 consecutive days. Oxprenolol was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and was quickly eliminated from plasma. Plasma concentrations-time data conformed to equations describing one-or two-compartment open kinetic model. No significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between after a single dose and multiple doses.", 
    "19": "In a dog K loaded by infusion of 2 mEq KCl/kg/hr, kaluresis plays a relatively small part in slowing the development of hyperkalemia and cardiotoxicity. These are largely retarded by a non-renal mechanism that transfer most of the infused K from extracellular to intracellular fluid. Treatment with beta receptor blocking dosages of propranolol significantly reduces K transfer capacity, but it also markedly diminishes the KCl stimulated secretory response of insulin, a powerful mediator of K transfer. In dogs in which diminution of the insulin response is prevented by administration of exogenous hormone, beta receptor blockade has no effect on K transfer capacity. Thus, it appears that decreased insulin secretion is responsible for the observed fall of K transfer capacity in dogs with beta receptor blockade. However, other evidence suggests that our results can also mean that a K load elicits the secretion of enough insulin to mediate K transfer in the presence of beta receptor blockade; if the hormone response is absent or deficient, beta receptors may be importantly involved in mediation of K transfer to intracellular fluid.", 
    "20": "Recent studies indicate that right ventricular performance is impaired even in uncomplicated systemic hypertension. Because of widespread use of beta-blockade in essentially hypertension, it is possible that such treatment often further depresses right ventricular contractility. To test this premise, and to evaluate the changes induced by different beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents on the contractility of right ventricular myocardium, 20 patients with essential hypertension were divided into two groups on a double-blind randomised basis, and maintained on oral oxprenolol or propranolol for five weeks. Cardiac catheterisation and right ventricular cineangiography were performed at the beginning and again at the end of the five week period. Right ventricular end-diastolic volume index did not change significantly in either group. In contrast, right ventricular end-systolic volume index increased, and right ventricular ejection fraction significantly decreased after chronic beta-blockade. Cardiac index decreased in both groups, but these changes were not statistically significant. When the intergroup differences were compared for all measured indices none of the changes between the two groups was statistically significant. Despite its intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, oxprenolol therefore impairs right ventricular performance to an extent nearly equal to that of propranolol. Moreover, right ventricular contractility is clearly diminished after the institution of beta-blockade in hypertensive patients--an effect that has until now been thought to be limited to the left side of the heart. Great caution must therefore be exercised when beta-blockade is initiated in patients with severely abnormal right ventricular function, because frank right ventricular decompensation may result.", 
    "21": "The effect of obsidan, mercazolil and their combinations on the plasma and erythrocytic potassium and sodium content as well as on the plasma calcium and magnesium concentration was studied under clinical conditions in 107 patients with a visceropathic stage of toxic goitre. Obsidan was given orally in a dose of 1.5 to 2 mg/kg and mercazolil in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg daily within 10 successive days. Obsidan treatment led to an increase in plasma and erythrocytes of the potassium concentration and plasma magnesium content, while the level of sodium in plasma and erythrocytes as well as of plasma calcium reduced. Mercazolil treatment (control group) exerted no significant effect on the test characteristics. It is concluded that obsidan effect on the blood calcium and sodium concentration is mediated through its action on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "22": "Serum concentrations of LH, FSH, testosterone and prolactin were measured in patients with hypertension treated with propranolol (34 cases), methyldopa (13 cases), and methyldopa + propranolol (11 cases). The results were compared with those obtained in 18 controls (hospital out-patients). There were no differences in these hormone concentrations in the various groups, and no difference between those complaining of impotence (13 cases) and those with normal sexual function. Impotence in hypertensive men on treatment with methyldopa cannot be explained by abnormalities in secretion of the reproductive hormones.", 
    "23": "From an original group of 36 Patients (15 with relatively advanced chronic open-angle glaucoma and 21 with ocular hypertension) 21 (seven glucoma and 14 ocular hypertension) were well controlled with Timolol alone or in combination with other pressure-lowering drugs after a three years' observation period. Dropouts occurred mainly in the first half of the treatment period. In most of these cases a glaucoma operation was necessary; more rarely, Timolol was discontinued due to intolerance. The overall success rate of 40% with Timolol alone (14 out of 36 patients) is lower than the 60% to 70% found in other long-term studies. If one considers only the results in the ocular hypertension group, the figure of 68% is more in line with the aforementioned results. In the light of similar studies it appears essential to take into account not only the total number of patients treated but also the degree of severity of the glaucoma. In severe glaucoma Timolol alone is seldom effective enough.", 
    "24": "The effect of propranolol within the first ten days after a transient experimental myocardial ischaemia was investigated. As compared to the untreated control lot, the ultrastructural and biochemical lesions appeared to be much reduced and within reversible limits. Worthy of note was the slight affection of mitochondria revealed by the level of mitochondrial enzymes, the presence of lysosomal and phagolysosomal structures and capillaries of normal aspect, and the absence of cytolysis. The favourable effect of this beta-blocking drug might be attributed to its protective action on the cellular and capillary membrane systems.", 
    "25": "1. The involvement of calcium in the alpha-action of adrenaline on guinea-pig taenia caeci was studied by measuring the changes in membrane potential and muscle contraction, using the sucrose-gap method, and by determining the (42)K efflux, in the presence of a beta-blocker (propranolol, 1.8 x 10(-6)m).2. In the presence of extracellular calcium, the hyperpolarization caused by adrenaline (3 x 10(-6)m) was sustained during the period of its application (5 min), both in active preparations (at 36 degrees C) and in quiescent muscle (22 degrees C). In the absence of calcium, adrenaline caused a transient hyperpolarization which was smaller at 36 degrees C than at 22 degrees C and passed off within 5 min, while adrenaline was present.3. Both the sustained and the transient hyperpolarization were associated with an increase in (42)K efflux which had a similar time course. (42)K flux measurements were made in depolarized tissue (52.8 mm-potassium), in which the effect was consistent and more pronounced than in polarized muscle (2.8 mm-potassium).4. The transient hyperpolarization which is resistant to calcium removal and EGTA (0.1-2.0 mm) could be evoked only once but, following a short exposure to calcium (2.5 mm) for 20 sec and readmission of calcium-free medium, it was restored.5. The sustained and the transient hyperpolarization and the increase in (42)K efflux were abolished by the alpha-antagonist phentolamine (10(-5)m); their amplitude was dependent on the adrenaline concentration in the range 10(-7) to 3 x 10(-6)m, and both responses persisted in the absence of sodium or chloride.6. The hyperpolarization and the increase in (42)K efflux were greater at higher external calcium concentrations (0.3-2.5 mm).7. Cobalt (0.6 mm), D600 (2.5 x 10(-5)m) and the bee toxin apamin (10(-7)m) reduced the alpha-response.8. In the presence of apamin, in calcium-containing solution, the sustained hyperpolarization caused by adrenaline was preceded by, or converted to, depolarization, spike discharge and contraction.9. The depolarizing effect of adrenaline in the presence of apamin persisted in sodium-free or chloride-free medium, but was blocked in the absence of calcium and diminished by cobalt and D600.10. It is concluded that the alpha-response of guinea-pig taenia caeci consists of two components, both involving calcium. First, the activation of alpha-receptors increases calcium entry, which leads to the opening of potassium channels, a sustained hyperpolarization and inhibition of muscle activity. Secondly, in the absence of external calcium, a transient hyperpolarization is revealed, presumably due to the release of bound calcium from a limited cellular store which can be replenished by addition of external calcium, and this leads to an increase in potassium permeability.", 
    "26": "Prophylactic effects of sulfinpyrazone (100 mg/Kg), aspirin (5 mg/Kg, 50 mg/Kg), and propranolol (2 mg/Kg, 10 mg/Kg) on myocardial necrosis and hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol were examined. Drugs were administered to rats daily by gavage for a period of 2 weeks and after that isoproterenol (40 mg/Kg) was injected subcutaneously. The control group received gavage of water and isoproterenol injection. The \"no infarct\" group received gavage of water and saline injection. Premedication of sulfinpyrazone and propranolol significantly preserved myocardial CK activity and decreased cardiac hypertrophy compared with control group (24 hours after isoproterenol injection) while aspirin did not have such effects. Myocardial cyclic AMP concentration significantly increased 30 min after isoproterenol injection in control and all the premedicated rats compared with the \"no infarct\" rats. The increment of cyclic AMP was not suppressed by sulfinpyrazone and propranolol during this period. Plasma levels of prostaglandins were significantly suppressed by the administration of sulfinpyrazone and 50 mg/Kg of aspirin, and were not suppressed by 5 mg/Kg of aspirin. It was concluded that premedication of sulfinpyrazone and propranolol reduce cardiac necrosis and hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol, but aspirin did not have such cardioprotective effects.", 
    "27": "Two isolated guinea pig hearts (H1, H2) were perfused in series in order to bioassay in the recipient heart (H2) the release of vasoactive metabolites. Due to an effective reoxygenation system transit time between H1 and H2 as only 20 sec. Hypoxic perfusion (30% O2) of H1 caused relaxation of the coronary vessels of H2, and this effect could be completely abolished by adenosine deaminase. Similar results were obtained when H1 was stimulated by isoproterenol while H2 was protected by propranolol. From our findings it is concluded that adenosine is the primary vasodilating substance released by the heart into the coronary circulation.", 
    "28": "The role of prostaglandins in the renin release response to renal nerve stimulation (RNS) at different intensities was examined in the anaesthetized dog. The animals were divided into two groups receiving either low or high level RNS, defined by the frequencies of stimulation producing reduction in renal blood flow by 5% or less and 50%. Indomethacin or diclofenac sodium (5 mg/kg i.v.), prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, did not affect the renin release response to low level RNS but decreased the renin release response to high level RNS by 31 +/- 8% (P less than 0.01). Addition of metoprolol, (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) beta-1-adrenoceptor antagonist, to indomethacin or diclofenac sodium resulted in a greater reduction (68 +/- 6% P less than 0.01) of the renin release response to high level RNS compared to that produced by either drug alone. Metoprolol, alone, reduced the renin release response to high level RNS by 37 +/- 14% (P less than 0.05). Phenoxybenzamine (0.6 microgram . kg-1 . min-1), alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, into the renal artery practically abolished the renal vasoconstrictor response to high level RNS and reduced the renin release response by 50 +/- 7% (P less than 0.01). Addition of metoprolol to phenoxybenzamine practically abolished the renal vasoconstrictor response and the renin release response to high level RNS; 94 +/- 4% (P less than 0.01). Addition of phenoxybenzamine to indomethacin or diclofenac sodium practically abolished the renal vasoconstrictor response to high level RNS but did not produce any greater reduction of the renin release response than that produced by either drug alone. These findings suggest that low level RNS results in renin release which is not dependent on prostaglandins. High level RNS results in renin release which is partly mediated by beta-1-adrenoceptors and partly related to alpha-adrenoceptors mediated renal vasoconstriction. Prostaglandins are not involved in the renin release deriving from alpha-adrenoceptor mediated renal vasoconstriction.", 
    "29": "Cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease characterized by abnormalities of exocrine gland and mucociliary function, has recently been shown to be associated with abnormal adrenergic and cholinergic physiologic responses in addition to decreased beta adrenergic-induced cyclic AMP generation in human leukocytes. In this study we have attempted to elucidate the nature of this hyporesponsiveness by assessing beta adrenergic receptor number and affinity (KD) in the intact neutrophil using the antagonist ligand [3H] dihydroalprenolol and cyclic AMP responses to isoproterenol in addition to histamine, and prostaglandin E1 in CF subjects, CF obligate heterozygotes (CFH), and normal control subjects. CF patients had significantly less (p less than 0.025) cyclic AMP stimulation above basals levels with isoproterenol (0.1 microM to 0.1 mM), compared with control values, but no consistent differences between groups were noted with histamine or PGE1. CF neutrophils had significantly fewer (p less than 0.005) beta adrenergic receptors per neutrophil (398.0 +/- 54.2 vs. 819.4 +/- 67.2) compared with control neutrophils, but the KD (0.740 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.630 +/- 0.05 nM) did not differ significantly (p greater than 0.05). There was no correlation between clinical severity and either cyclic AMP generation or dihydroalprenolol binding (r = 0.27 and 0.24, respectively, p greater than 0.05). The CFH group had approximately 50% of the cyclic AMP stimulation compared with controls, but the number (909.8 +/- 89.3) and KD (0.710 +/- 0.09 nM) of their beta adrenergic receptors were indistinguishable from control subjects. These findings suggest \"down regulation\" of the beta receptor in the CF patient. The cause of this remains unknown. Although the etiology of the decreased cyclic AMP responses in CFH was not due to decreased beta adrenergic receptors as assessed by antagonist ligand binding, further studies inthe CFH group to include agonist binding, receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling, intrinsic adenylate cyclase activity, and catecholamine metabolism may help determine the basic cause of beta adrenergic hyperesposiveness in both CFH and CF.", 
    "30": "The present experiments were designed to explore the mechanism whereby 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) stimulates the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) in rat thymocytes in vitro. Addition of T3 evoked a transient, dose-related increase in cellular cyclic (c) AMP concentrations, evident within 5 min. followed soon by an increase in 2-DG uptake. The effects of T3 on both cAMP concentration and 2-DG uptake were dependent upon the presence of extracellular calcium. Epinephrine also induced a sequential increase in thymocyte cAMP concentration and 2-DG uptake. These responses were more prompt than those to T3, but were calcium independent. As with their combined effects on 2-DG uptake, T3 and epinephrine produced synergistic or additive effects on cellular cAMP concentration. Dibutyryl cAMP also stimulated 2-DG uptake, an effect that was more prompt than that of epinephrine, and like that of epinephrine, was calcium independent. Prior or simultaneous addition of L-alprenolol (10 microM), which, we have previously shown, blocks the effect of both T3 and epinephrine on 2-DG uptake, also blocked the increase in thymocyte cAMP concentration induced by these agents. In contrast, L-alprenolol failed to block the increase in 2-DG uptake produced by dibutyryl cAMP. On the basis of these observations we suggest that T3 increases 2-DC uptake in the rat thymocyte by increasing the cellular concentration of cAMP, which then acts to enhance sugar transport. The increase in 2-DC uptake induced by epinephrine is also mediated by an increase in cAMP concentration. The greater response of cellular cAMP concentration to T3 and epinephrine when added together than to either agent added alone may explain their synergistic action to increase 2-DG uptake. We suggest that these actions of T3 and epinephrine are both initiated at the level of the plasma membrane.", 
    "31": "The adenylate cyclase of C6 glioma cell cultures was characterized for sensitivity to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, as well as fluoride, and GTP as a function of the cell cycle. The mitotic phase of the cell cycle was emphasized because both the basal cellular cyclic AMP level and the intact C6 cell's capacity to accumulate cyclic AMP in response to isoproterenol decreased during mitosis. Basal and stimulated adenylate cyclase activities in mitotic cells were decreased relative to the enzyme activities in the G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Analysis of the beta-adrenergic receptor using the radioligand(-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol showed that neither ligand affinity nor receptor density changed during the cell cycle, indicating that the reduced adenylate cyclase activity of the mitotic C6 cell was not caused by alterations in this hormone receptor. The reduction in the mitotic cell's basal adenylate cyclase activity was more prominent than the decrease in isoproterenol-, fluoride, or GTP-stimulated activities suggesting that the effectiveness of these enzymes activators (i.e., the efficiency of the coupling mechanism) was not attenuated during mitosis. These studies indicate that the intrinsic catalytic capacity (not the beta-adrenergic receptor or the coupling mechanism) of the C6 adenylate cyclase complex is reduced during mitosis and contributes to the mitotic cell's inability to accumulate and maintain the cyclic AMP concentration at the interphase level.", 
    "32": "1. The plasma aldosterone responses to exogenous angiotensin II and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were studied before and after 1 month of propranolol therapy (120-240 mg/day) in eight patients with essential hypertension. 2. Basal supine plasma renin activity was decreased (P less than 0.001) after propranolol, whereas plasma aldosterone was unchanged. After 3 h of upright posture the increases in both plasma renin activity and aldosterone were decreased (P less than 0.05) after propranolol. 3. Plasma aldosterone responses to exogenous angiotensin II and ACTH were not significantly different after propranolol. Serum and urinary electrolytes and plasma cortisol were also unaffected by propranolol therapy. 4. It is concluded that changes in adrenal sensitivity are not responsible for maintaining unchanged supine plasma aldosterone concentrations after beta-adrenoceptor antagonism in essential hypertension.", 
    "33": "In the pithed rat, amidephrine a \"selective\" alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, evokes a positive chronotropic response. This response can be antagonized by prazosin but not by propranolol or by rauwolscine. Similarly, part of the chronotropic response to cardioaccelerator nerve stimulation is resistant to blockade by propranolol but is sensitive to prazosin or WB4101. We conclude that alpha 1-adrenoceptors can mediate a chronotropic response in the rat heart either to exogenous agonists or to the endogenous neurotransmitter noradrenaline.", 
    "34": "1 Plasma propranolol steady state concentration (Css) was determined during chronic dosage (160 mg/day) in 22 hyperthyroid patients (aged 16-75 years, 11 smokers, 11 non-smokers) and again following treatment when euthyroid. 2 There was a positive correlation between plasma propranolol Css and age in patients both when hyperthyroid (r = 0.74, P less than 0.01) and when euthyroid (r = 0.58, P less than 0.05). 3 Plasma propranolol Css in hyperthyroid patients were lower (P less than 0.05) in smokers than in non-smokers. 4 Following correction of hyperthyroidism there was a significant increase (P less than 0.01) in both the plasma propranolol Css and degree of plasma protein binding of propranolol. 5 Hyperthyroidism and smoking are known to increase the rate of drug metabolism and it is suggested that these variables may give rise to or accentuate an age related reduction in propranolol clearance.", 
    "35": "Bronchial and cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade have been compared in six normal subjects after three beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Single and double doses of atenolol (50 and 100 mg), acebutolol (100 and 200 mg) and labetalolol (150 and 300 mg) were studied on separate occasions. 2 Salbutamol airway dose-response curves were obtained by measuring the airway response as the change in specific airway conductance (sGaw) after increasing doses of inhaled salbutamol. Bronchial beta-adrenoceptor blockade was assessed after each drug as the dose of salbutamol needed to cause a 50% increase in sGaw (sGaw D50). 3 Cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade was assessed after the same doses of each beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, by measuring the percentage reduction in exercise heart rate from control, after exercise for 5 min at 70% of the subject's maximum work rate. 4 Atenolol 50 and 100 mg caused least bronchial beta-adrenoceptor blockade and the greatest reduction in exercise heart rate. 5 Acebutolol 100 and 200 mg and labetalol 150 and 300 mg produced more bronchial beta-adrenoceptor blockade than atenolol. 6 With this approach new beta-adrenoceptor antagonists can be assessed without putting asthmatic patients at risk.", 
    "36": "Several factors affecting the stimulus-induced vacuolation in cat tracheal submucosal glands described in a companion paper [Am. J. Physiol. 241 (Cell Physiol. 10): C18-C24, 1981] were examined. Stimulation with predominantly alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, and cholinergic agonists at various concentrations and in the presence of appropriate blockers showed that alpha-adrenergic or cholinergic stimulation is more effective in inducing vacuolation than beta-adrenergic stimulation. In addition, Ca- or HCO3- deficient incubation medium or low incubation temperature either blocked or significantly decreased the vacuolation response. Stimulation in the presence of the Na-K-ATPase inhibitor ouabain prevented vacuolation. The known roles of these factors in fluid transport are consistent with the possibility that stimulus-induced vacuolation possibly arises in response to disturbances in cytoplasmic fluid, which are induced in the secretory cell when the fluid component of secretion is intensely stimulated. A model is presented that possibly relates the observed responses to intracellular event and suggests the possibility of ion pumps in the apical membrane.", 
    "37": "An attempt was made to explain the mechanism of histamine release from isolated rat mast cells induced by the beta-adrenergic blocking drug K\u00f6 1124. This drug at the highest concentration used released 12 times more histamine than most other investigated beta-blockers. The release of histamine with K\u00f6 1124 was dose and temperature dependent. The maximal histamine release was at pH 8 and in the absence of calcium ions. Increased calcium concentration decreased histamine release significantly. The effect of K\u00f6 1124 on histamine release from mast cells was inhibited only by cocaine and 2,4-dinitrophenol; other metabolic inhibitors were ineffective. The histamine release due to K\u00f6 1124 was not followed by an equal release of 35S. Isoprenaline in equimolar concentration decreased histamine release induced by K\u00f6 1124 significantly. The release of 35S-labelled granules was decreased or blocked by isoprenaline.", 
    "38": "The hemodynamic effects of the inotropic agents prenalterol and dobutamine were compared in a canine model of acute ischemic heart failure following two-vessel coronary artery constriction. Intravenous infusions of both inotropic agents resulted in improvement of cardiac output, left ventricular maximum dP/dt, and contractile force in the nonischemic zone and in a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. No significant changes occurred in ischemic zone contractile force or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure following either inotropic agent compared to saline controls. Significant differences between the two inotropic agents consisted of prenalterol's markedly longer duration of action (hemodynamic half life of 3 hr after discontinuation compared to a value of 1.7 min after dobutamine discontinuation) and greater augmentation of cardiac output at high-dose dobutamine due to greater increases in heart rate. However, similar hemodynamic effects were noted with prenalterol and dobutamine at doses which increased nonischemic contractile force 50%. Both inotropic agents were associated with ventricular arrhythmias in the acute ischemic state. Implications regarding the use of prenalterol and dobutamine in clinical acute ischemic low-output states are discussed.", 
    "39": "Both clonidine and labetalol when given by bolus intravenous injection into conscious rabbits produce an initial rise in left ventricular pressure associated with a decrease in myocardial contractility as assessed by left ventricular dP/dt. While clonidine also produces a marked bradycardiac effect, labetalol causes no change in heart rate. Acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol, 1 mg/kg, i.v., does not significantly modify the response produced by either clonidine or labetalol. Following cardiac cholinergic blockade with scopolamine methylbromide, 50 microgram/kg, the negative inotropic effect produced by clonidine is abolished and is replaced by a positive inotropic effect, while the negative inotropic response produced by labetalol is attenuated. Following cardiac autonomic blockade with propranolol and scopolamine methyl-bromide, both clonidine and labetalol produce a positive inotropic response. These positive inotropic responses may be due to the partial alpha-adrenoceptor-agonist properties which both drugs possess and which could be unmasked by cardiac autonomic blockade.", 
    "40": "The ability of chronic UM-272 (dimethylpropranolol) treatment to prevent the induction of reentrant ventricular tachyarrhythmias was assessed in the conscious dog subjected to serial programmed electrical stimulation on days 3--5 after myocardial infarction. In 20 untreated control animals, programmed electrical stimulation produced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 6 animals (30%), sustained ventricular tachycardia in 8 animals (40%), and ventricular fibrillation in 6 animals (30%) on the third day after occlusion and reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. On day 4, programmed electrical stimulation produced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 5 animals (36%), sustained ventricular tachycardia in 7 animals (50%), and ventricular fibrillation in 2 animals (14%). UM-272, 5 or 10 mg/kg, i.v., was administered every 12 hr to a separate group of 8 dogs after the induction of ischemic myocardial injury. Programmed electrical stimulation on day 3 after myocardial infarction failed to elicit ventricular arrhythmias in 4 animals (50%, p = 0.014), with acute administration of the next UM-272 dose preventing the induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 7 animals (88%, p less than 0.0001). On day 4, programmed electrical stimulation failed to elicit ventricular arrhythmias in 5 aminals (63%, p = 0.0021). Thirty-six hours after the withdrawal of UM-272, programmed electrical stimulation produced ventricular fibrillation in 5 animals (63%) and sustained ventricular tachycardia which degenerated to ventricular fibrillation in 3 animals (37%). UM-272 significantly (p less than 0.05) depressed conduction in both normal and ischemically injured myocardium while also increasing (p less than 0.05) ventricular effective refractory periods. The results of these investigations suggest that UM-272 may be effective in preventing reentrant ventricular rhythms in hearts subjected to chronic myocardial ischemic damage and, therefore, may be of potential value in preventing reentrant ventricular arrhythmias in man.", 
    "41": "The effects of intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, epinephrine, isoproterenol, N-t-butylnorepinephrine, oxymethyleneisoproterenol, and RO363 on heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and stroke volume were evaluated in chloralose-anaesthetized cats before and after phentolamine, propranolol, atenolol, and butoxamine. Pressor responses to both norepinephrine and epinephrine largely resulted from alpha-receptor-mediated increases in total peripheral resistance. Vasomotor reversal was noted with both drugs in the presence of alpha-receptor blockade. Dilator responses to norepinephrine were abolished by the beta 1-receptor selective antagonist atenolol, as were those to the beta 1-receptor selective agonists oxymethyleneisoproterenol and RO363. Dilator responses to epinephrine were abolished by the beta 2-receptor selective antagonist butoxamine, as were those to N-t-butylnorepinephrine (beta 2-selective) and isoproterenol (nonselective). These results indicate that in addition to beta 2-receptors, beta 1-receptors subserving vasodilatation occur in the cat vasculature. Atenolol displayed agonist-dependent inhibition of the cardiac responses. Responses to noradrenaline, RO363, and oxymethyleneisoproterenol were blocked to a greater extent than were those to epinephrine, N-t-butylnorepinephrine, and isoproterenol. Butoxamine did not display any marked agonist-dependent inhibition of cardiac responses. Nevertheless, the results are in accord with previous suggestions that cardiostimulant beta 2-receptors exist in the cat heart. Interpretation of the actions of catecholamines may be complicated by mixed beta-adrenoceptor populations in the cat cardiovascular system.", 
    "42": "The haemodynamic dose-response effects of intravenous oxprenolol over the range of 2--64 mg were measured in 28 patients with coronary heart disease. At rest there were statistically significant dose-response trends, linear or quadratic, between the cumulative doses of oxprenolol and reductions in systolic pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output and increases in stroke volume and pulmonary wedge pressure. The magnitude of the changes was uninfluenced by the degree of left ventricular functional disability as judged by the level of the pulmonary wedge pressure. During dynamic exercise the haemodynamic changes induced by oxprenolol were significantly greater in patients with more marked left ventricular disability than in those less severely affected. These observations define the immediate effects of intravenous oxprenolol over a relatively wide dose range and confirm its relative haemodynamic safety in patients with stable coronary heart disease.", 
    "43": "To investigate the electrophysiological effects of propranolol in vivo over a wide range of plasma concentrations and to distinguish effects due to beta-blockade from those due to a direct membrane action, His bundle electrograms were recorded, and ventricular effective refractory periods (VERP) and monophasic action potential duration (MAP) were measured in anesthetized control dogs and in dogs given three graded infusions of d- or dl-propranolol. Dogs were excluded if the plasma concentrations attained did not fall in predefined ranges of 25--125, 125--700, and 700--3,000 ng/ml. Isoproterenol sensitivity tests were performed to determine the relative beta-blocking potency of the isomers at the three concentration ranges. The highest concentration of d-propranolol had approximately the same beta-blocking potency as the lowest concentration of dl-propranolol. Mean AH and HV intervals in the His bundle electrogram increased with the concentration of dl-propranolol, and the increase was greater than with d-propranolol (p less than 0.03) at the first and second concentration steps but not significantly different at the highest concentrations of d- and dl-propranolol. VERP and MAP increased directly with concentration of d- and dl-propranolol. Although the mean increases of VERP and MAP tended to be greater in the dl-propranolol group, the differences between d- and dl-propranolol were not statistically significant at any concentration. We conclude that prolongations of atrioventricular and His-Purkinje conduction are stereospecific responses and are due to beta-blockade. The specific mechanism for the prolongation of ventricular repolarization and refractoriness are effects of propranolol that could not be definitively classified in this study.", 
    "44": "A computer program was developed to simplify the conventional method for determining the maximal contractile element shortening velocity at zero load (Vmax) by analysis of pressure-velocity graphs during the isovolumic contraction period. From an uncalibrated left ventricular (LV) pressure signal and its first derivative (dP/dt), the graph relating developed LV pressure (Pd) to the corresponding instantaneous value of (dP/dt)/28 Pd was constructed by the computer. The segment of the graph that encompassed approximately the second half of the isovolumic contraction period, as determined by analysis of the dP/dt waveform, was then extrapolated to provide V'max on the ordinate. This V'max was compared with the conventional Vmax obtained from calibrated LV and aortic pressure signals. In 5 dogs both in the control state and during inotropic (epinephrine, propranolol) and noninotropic interventions (phenylephrine or dextran infusion), a high degree of correlation was found relating V'max and Vmax both derived by either linear (Vmax = 0.91 V'max + 0.14; r = 0.933; P less than 0.001) or exponential (Vmax = 0.99 V'max - 0.06; r = 0.959; P less than 0.001) extrapolation of the pressure-velocity graph to zero load. By use of this program, Vmax can be easily and reliably estimated from the uncalibrated LV pressure signal and its first derivative.", 
    "45": "1. The action of isoprenaline on gastric acid secretion in rats with Heidenhain pouches has been compared with its action in a rat isolated stomach preparation. 2. Isoprenaline (40 micrograms kg-1 h-1) inhibited the acid secretion in response to pentagastrin (20 micrograms kg-1 h-1) in conscious rate with Heidenhain pouches. 3. This inhibition could be abolished by propranolol (2 mg kg-1) and butoxamine (8 mg kg-1) and partially reversed by practolol (8 mg kg-1). 4. Propranolol (2 mg kg-1) significantly increased the response to pentagastrin (20 micrograms kt-1 h-1) but butoxamine and practolol (both at 8 mg kg-1) and the inactive isomer (+)-propranolol (2 mg kg-1) were without any effect on the pentagastrin response in the rats with pouches. 5. In the rat isolated stomach preparation isoprenaline stimulated acid secretion over the range 10(-7) M-10(-3) M whereas phenylephrine and methoxamine were without effect. 6. Propranolol (2 X 10(-5) M) inhibited this stimulatory effect of isoprenaline in vitro but (+)-propranolol (2 X 10(-5) M), practolol and butoxamine (both at 10(-4) M) had no effect on the response. 7. Propranolol (2 X 10(-5) M) did not have any effect on the response of the isolated stomach to pentagastrin (5 X 10(-7) M) or bethanechol (1.7 X 10(-5) M). 8. Phenylephrine (2 X 10(-5) M) did not affect the in vitro responses to pentagastrin (2.17 X 10(-7) M), bethanechol (1.7 X 10(-5) M) or histamine (5.4 X 10(-5) M). 9. It is concluded that isoprenaline has a direct stimulatory effect and an indirect inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion in the rat. Both effects involve stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. The relative predominance of one or other of these two opposing effects may help to explain the contradictory results in the literature regarding the actions of beta-adrenoceptor agonists on gastric acid secretion.", 
    "46": "Using the isolated and blood-perfused dog atrial preparation, chronotropic and inotropic responses to 3 kinds of alpha-adrenergic blockers, phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine, and E-643, were compared. When phenoxybenzamine was administered into the cannulated sinus node artery, positive chronotropic and inotropic responses were induced in doses of 10-300 microgram. Phentolamine also produced positive responses, but at larger doses such as 100 and 300 microgram, accompanying initial negative responses. E-643 usually produced only negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. Positive responses to phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine were significantly suppressed by propranolol, and negative responses to E-643 and phentolamine were not modified by atropine treatment. From these results and previous reports, it is assumed that sinus tachycardia induced by alpha-blockers in situ may be due to 3 different mechanisms, i.e., 1) reflex tachycardia induced by the hypotension, 2) augmented catecholamine release mediated by the block of the presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors, and 3) direct catecholamine release from locally innervated sympathetic nerve terminals.", 
    "47": "Bometolol is a cardiospecific beta-adrenergic blocking drug. The effect on blood pressure was determined in hypertensive rats in acute and subchronic experiments. In acute experiment bometolol, 10-30 mg/kg, p.o., was given to spontaneously hypertensive rats; deoxycorticosterone and salt hypertensive rats; and two kidney, one clip hypertensive rats. Blood pressure was determined continuously for 8 h and after 24 h in unanesthetized condition. The blood pressure lowered by bometolol was dose-dependent in three types of hypertension. In subchronic experiment, bometolol at a dose of 10-30 mg/kg or 100-300 mg/kg, p.o., were given for 5 weeks to deoxycorticosterone and salt hypertensive rats; and two kidney, one clip hypertensive rats. Bometolol did not show antihypertensive effect in either type of hypertension, although bometolol decreased heart rate dose-dependently. Bometolol treatment at the above doses decreased plasma renin activity, heart and kidney weights, and incidence of vascular lesion in either hypertensive rat. Toxic symptom was seen 3 days after bometolol treatment of 300 mg/kg in deoxycorticosterone and salt hypertensive rats.", 
    "48": "We have devised a simple method to determine the ratios of cardiac to vascular beta-receptor blockage (C:V ratios) in normotensive rats anesthetized with pentobarbital, and applied it to six beta-adrenergic blocking drugs (beta-blockers). Mean blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded. Isoproterenol (3 ng-100 microgram/kg, i.v.) was cumulatively injected before and after the intravenous administration of beta-blockers at two dose-levels. Thus shifts of the dose-response curves in BP and HR were observed. \"In vivo pA2\" values were calculated in molar doses per kg by Schild plots. The C:V ratio was calculated as antilogarithm of the difference of the mean in vivo pA2 value in HR from that in BP. Those of atenolol, bometolol, bunitrolol, pindolol, propranolol, and sotalol were 9.77, 8.13, 2.95, 1.38, 1.20, and 0.71, respectively.", 
    "49": "Effects of bucumolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, on blood pressure and the renin angiotensin system were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The results were compared with those of propranolol at an equipotent dose in beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Bucumolol lowered blood pressure and decreased plasma renin concentration (PRC) in both acute and long-term experiments. There was a significant correlation between percent changes in blood pressure and PRC following a single administration of bucumolol. Decrease in PRC persisted for the 6-week observation period despite the sustained reduction in blood pressure. On the other hand, propranolol did not lower blood pressure in acute experiment while it decreased renin release. These results suggest that inhibition of renin release is involved in the antihypertensive action of bucumolol.", 
    "50": "1. Methods - In order to verify that the antagonism of isoprenaline by bepridil was not exclusive to cardiac receptors, anesthetized dogs were subjected to a double isoprenaline stimulation (two 15 minute perfusions at a rate of 1 microgram . kg-1 . min . -1 separated by a 75 minute interval). Bepridil at 5 mg . kg-1 was injected intravenously 45 minutes before the second isoprenaline stimulation, and compared to propranolol (1 mg . kg-1), practolol (5 mg . kg-1) and perhexiline (2.5 mg . kg-1). In addition, bepridil (1 mg . kg-1 . min . -1) and perhexiline (0.5 mg . kg-1 . min-1) were also perfused intravenously, simultaneously with the second isoprenaline stimulation. Classical cardiovascular parameters (heart rate, left dP/dt max., arterial pressure, coronary artery flow) together with plasma free fatty acid levels (FFA) were monitored at intervals of 5 minutes throughout the study. 2. Results - The two isoprenaline stimulations caused non-statistically different increases in the various parameters. All the cardiovascular effects of isoprenaline were inhibited by propranolol, except for the increase in coronary flow. Likewise, the increased plasma FFA level fell by 82.7 +/- 4.2% (p = 0.003). The tachycardia and elevated left dP/dt max. were antagonised by practolol, which the increased FFA levels fell by 64.3 +/- 4.8% (p less than 0.01). The other parameters were not altered. No signficant effect was observed with perhexiline. Rapid I.V. infection of bepridil only decreased the isoprenaline. induced tachycardia (from 74 +/- 15.6 syst. Min.-1 to 57.3 +/- 12.7 syst. min.-1). Perfusion of bepridil considerably limited the tachycardia, while moderately reducing the increased contractility later on. However, it had no effect on FFA levels or the other cardiovascular parameters. 3. Discussion and conclusions - The results obtained with propranolol and practolol are consistent with the competitive B-blocking activity of both compounds. The lack of effect noted in this instance with perhexiline may be explained by the recent hypothesis whereby this compound acts on the presynaptic nerve endings of the cardiac pacemaker system and depresses the release of endogenous noradrenaline while unable to antagonise exogenous adrenergic stimulation. The dissociated effects of bepridil with regard to cardiac and lipolytic stimulation by isoprenaline, strongly suggest functional antagonism by both compounds at cardiac level alone. This antagonism is explained by the depressant effects of bepridil on Ca2+/Na+ slow inward currents, as shown previously in myocardial preparations.", 
    "51": "Ligation of the anterior descending coronary artery two-thirds from its origin in the pig was found to precipitate ventricular arrhythmias and fibrillation, starting approximately 20 min post-ligation, which were associated with regional accumulation of myocardial cAMP in the ischaemic area. When the arrhythmias stopped, cyclic AMP levels in the ischaemic zone were decreased. Arrhythmias could then be induced by subepicardial infusion (10 microliter/min) close to the visible edge of ischaemia of cAMP analogues [N6-monobutyryl cAMP, N6,O2'-dibutyryl cAMP (5.10(-2) M each)] or agents which increase the myocardial contents of cAMP. These agents were: isoproterenol (10(-6) M), noradrenaline, adrenaline (10(-5) M each), glucagon, histamine (10(-3) M each), theophylline and caffeine (5.10(-2) M each). Also active were dopamine (10(-3) M), ouabain (10(-5) M) and aconitine (10(-6) M). The arrhythmias induced by infusion of catecholamines were dependent on Ca2+ and were abolished by beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (pindolol, 10(-6) M) and calcium antagonists (isoptin, D 600, 10(-4) M each). Infusion of 150 mM sodium chloride or 100 mM sodium butyrate did not precipitate arrhythmias. It is concluded that myocardial cAMP may play an important role in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias in the ischaemic heart, probably by augmenting the slow calcium inward current.", 
    "52": "This study describes the newly discovered relation between ejection fraction and end-systolic volume index (ESVI) of the left ventricle as obtained by angiography at the time of cardiac catheterisation. Linear regression analysis shows that ejection fraction (%)=82.0-0.62 ESVI (ml/m2) but the correlation for patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking drugs is significantly lower compared with the untreated group. Non-linear analysis, applied to cover also the asymptotic range for ejection fraction less than 20%, shows similar results. The good relation between the two indices indicates that the index ejection fraction may derive its clinical importance directly from the more fundamental index end-systolic volume index by virtue of the operation of the beta-adrenergic system on the heart.", 
    "53": "The effects of incubation temperature on binding characteristics of beta-adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists were examined in rabbit whole lung membrane fragments. [3H] Dihydroalprenolol ([3H] DHA) exhibited single component, non-cooperative binding at 37 degrees C and 25 degrees C with characteristics representative of beta-adrenergic receptors. Inhibition of [3H] DHA binding by l-propranolol showed single component binding at either incubation temperature, but with slightly higher affinity at 25 degrees C, when analyzed by Hofstee plots. The binding of l-isoproterenol, l-epinephrine and l-norepinephrine were changed qualitatively, as well as quantitatively, by incubation temperature. Hofstee plot analysis of l-isoproterenol inhibition curves showed a linear plot at 37 degrees C and a curvilinear plot at 25 degrees C, whereas l-epinephrine and l-norepinephrine showed curvilinear plots at both temperatures, but with different relative distributions and affinities of the components. The binding characteristics of several selective beta 1- and beta 2-agonists and antagonists were also influenced by incubation temperature. Practolol and prenalterol, beta 1-selective agents, exhibited multiple component binding at 25 degrees C, but only single component binding at 37 degrees C. In contrast, salbutamol, a beta 2-selective agonist, showed single component binding at 25 degrees C and apparent multiple component binding at 37 degrees C. Such temperature-related changes in binding characteristics were not consistent with receptor subtype interconversion and were not restricted to either agonists or antagonists. These studies suggest that the choice of incubation temperature may result in different binding characteristics of various beta-adrenergic receptor ligands. These effects are especially important when binding studies are designed to determine the classification and density of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in individual tissues.", 
    "54": "A patient taking propranolol hydrochloride, 40 mg twice daily, had a constitutional reaction several minutes after receiving a maintenance allergy injection. When the reaction proved resistant to treatment with aqueous adrenalin, intubation with 100% oxygen ventilation and the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate with pancuronium bromide, diphenhydramine hydrochloride and dexamethasone was required for the patient's recovery. Physicians should be aware that, in allergy patients, low doses of propranolol hydrochloride can result in acute pulmonary failure.", 
    "55": "1 Stimulation of the renal nerves in the cat was previously shown to cause renin release which could be blocked by propranolol. An attempt was made in this study to determine the type of beta-adrenoceptor mediating this response.2 In anaesthetized, unilaterally nephrectomized cats, a comparison was made of the ability of two selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists to block the tachycardia and hypotension caused by isoprenaline (mediated respectively by beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors) and the release of renin caused by renal nerve stimulation.3 Isoprenaline (mean dose of 0.224 +/- 0.022 nmol/kg), increased heart rate by approximately 43 beats/min and decreased mean blood pressure by 47 mmHg. Stimulation of the distal cut ends of the renal nerves, at a rate sufficient to reduce renal blood flow by 30%, resulted in an approximately 150% increase in plasma renin activity.4 Administration of the selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol (0.38 to 11.28 mumol/kg), caused a dose-related inhibition of nerve stimulated renin release and of isoprenaline-induced tachycardia, with no diminution of the vasodepressor response to isoprenaline; in contrast, the selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, erythro-DL-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylamino-butan-2-ol (ICI 118, 551, 0.03 to 2.86 mumol/kg), caused a dose-related inhibition of the isoprenaline-induced vasodepression without altering the increase in plasma renin activity caused by renal nerve stimulation. Only at the highest dose of ICI 118, 551 was there a reduction of isoprenaline-induced tachycardia, by about 40%.5 The selective inhibition of neurally activated renin release by atenolol but not by ICI, 118, 551 is consistent with the suggestion that the beta-adrenoceptors mediating renin release resemble those in the heart more closely than those in peripheral blood vessels.", 
    "56": "1 Eight beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents were compared for their ability to antagonize arrhythmias induced by bolus injections of CaCl2 in rats. 2 Only those beta-blockers possessing local anaesthetic properties were effective in antagonizing this type of arrhythmia and there was a highly significant correlation between antiarrhythmic and local anaesthetic properties. 3 Effects on adrenoceptors seem to play only a minor role in the genesis of this type of arrhythmia.", 
    "57": "1 Adrenaline (10 nM) significantly enhanced the stimulation-induced efflux of radioactivity from rat atria previously incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline ([3H]-NA). This effect was abolished by metoprolol (.01 muM). 2 Adrenaline in a higher concentration (1 muM) and NA (1 muM) significantly reduced the stimulation-induced efflux of radioactivity. However, in the presence of phenoxybenzamine (10 muM), adrenaline (1 muM) enhanced the efflux, whereas NA (1 muM) had no effect. 3 In rat isolated atria pre-incubated with adrenaline and then incubated with NA, both catecholamines were taken up and were released by field stimulation. When pre-incubation was with adrenaline and incubation was with [3H]-NA, metoprolol decreased the stimulation-induced efflux of radioactivity. This effect did not occur if the atria were pre-incubated with NA instead of adrenaline, suggesting tht neuronally released adrenaline activates prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors. 4 In conscious rats, intravenously administered adrenaline (6.0 and 0.6 nmol/kg) was taken up and retained in the atria and could be released by field stimulation. The release was calcium-dependent from these rats up to 24 h after administration.", 
    "58": "1 Haemodynamic effects of cigarette smoking before and during chronic treatment with propranolol and metoprolol were studied in 16 patients with essential hypertension. 2 Smoking of cigarettes induced an increase in blood pressure of the same degree in all experimental sessions. Heart rate increased by 16 beats/min during smoking alone, but increased significantly less, when a beta-adrenoceptor blocker was used. Forearm blood flow decreased during smoking in both medication periods. 3 Plasma adrenaline rose significantly during smoking from 0.37 nmol/l to 0.77 nmol/l; plasma noradrenaline did not change. 4 It is concluded that the blood pressure changes induced by smoking are not essentially altered during chronic treatment with selective or non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Only the increase in heart rate is significantly less pronounced during treatment with both drugs.", 
    "59": "Mechanisms related to the inhibitory actions of low concentrations of l- and d-propranolol on adrenergic transmission were investigated in isolated preparations of guinea-pig pulmonary arteries. In sympathetic nerve-radial muscle preparations, l-propranolol (3.3 X 10(-8) and 10(-7) M) dose-dependently inhibited by 15 to 20% contractile responses to nerve stimulation (1 Hz, 2-msec pulse width, 100-sec period and 30-min intervals) 30 and 60 min after the addition, whereas 3.3 X 10(-7) M produced a maximal inhibition. Contractile responses to cumulatively applied norepinephrine were not modified by pretreatment with l-propranolol (10(-7) - 10(-6) M). d-Propranolol (10(-7) M) produced no inhibition of adrenergic transmission. In superfused spiral preparations preloaded with [3H]norepinephrine, l-isoproterenol (3 X 10(-8) - 10(-6) M) dose-dependently facilitated total 3H efflux by transmural field stimulation by 10 to 35% under the same conditions; this facilitation was antagonized by l-propranolol (10(-7) M) but not by d-propranolol (10(-7) M). Phentolamine (3 X 10(-6) M) increased 3H efflux by approximately 3-fold. In the presence of phentolamine, l-propranolol (10(-7) M) significantly inhibited 3H efflux, whereas d-propranolol (10(-7) M) produced no effect. Presynaptic beta adrenoceptors are present on sympathetic nerve endings which innervate guinea-pig pulmonary arteries and low concentrations of propranolol inhibit adrenergic transmission via blockade of these receptors.", 
    "60": "Chronic administration of reserpine to rats resulted in a doubling of the density of beta adrenergic receptors in submandibular gland membranes as determined by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding. The affinity of the labelled drug for the receptor were not altered. There was a concomitant increase in the isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP levels in slices of the gland when incubated in the absence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. However, this increase in cyclic AMP accumulation appears to be related to a decrease in phosphodiesterase activity rather than to the increase in the density of beta receptors, since glands from control and reserpinized animals accumulated equal amounts of cyclic AMP when incubated in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. In addition, there was no difference between glands from controls and reserpine-treated rats in catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, but the Vmax of the phosphodiesterase was decreased 36% in glands from the treated animals. Similar results were obtained when control and surgically denervated glands were compared. The increase in beta adrenergic receptors appears to be the result of the depletion of norepinephrine due to reserpine administration, whereas the decreased phosphodiesterase activity may result from decreased cyclic AMP levels, secondary to the decrease in norepinephrine.", 
    "61": "Neurotransmitter effects were studied on in vitro release of immunoreactive somatostatin (SRIF) from slices prepared from several regions of the rat brain: mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), preoptic anterior hypothalamic area (POA) and amygdaloid complex (AMY). Potassium (K+, 56 mM) stimulated SRIF release in all structures tested in a calcium dependent manner. Morphine, dopamine, GABA and serotonin did not modify SRIF release in any structure; noradrenaline (NA) was not effective on MBH slices, but elicited a dose-dependent stimulation of SRIF release from POA and AMY (ED50 = 6.4 +/- 1.4 nM and 3.6 +/- 1.2 nM respectively). Converse orders of potency of adrenergic agonists were observed in both structures (POA, adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than isoproterenol; AMY, isoproterenol greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline). Phentolamine blocked NA-induced SRIF release in the POA while propranolol was ineffective. On the contrary, propranolol, but not phentolamine, antagonized NA stimulation in the amygdala. The data suggest that NA acting through specific receptors modulate SRIF release from POA and AMY. In POA, NA effect seems mediated through alpha adrenergic receptors while in AMY, beta receptors are involved. The possibility that these interactions of NA with SRIF release are correlated with effects of NA on growth hormone secretion or on epileptic events is discussed."
