The method was optimized using an uncoated fused silica capillary, carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrin (CM-beta-CD) as chiral selector and triethylamine/phosphoric acid buffer in alkaline conditions. A BBD for four factors was selected to observe the effects of buffer electrolyte concentration, pH, CM-beta-CD concentration and voltage on separation responses. Each factor was studied at three levels: high, central and low, and three center points were added. The buffer electrolyte concentration ranged from 25 to 75 mM, the pH ranged from 8 to 9, the CM-beta-CD concentration ranged from 3.5 to 4.5% w/v, and the applied run voltage ranged from 14 to 20 kV. The responses evaluated were resolution and migration time for the last peak. The obtained responses were processed by Minitab to evaluate the significance of the effects and to find the optimum analysis conditions. The best results were obtained using 4% w/v CM-beta-CD in 25 mM triethylamine/H3PO4 buffer at pH 9 as running electrolyte and 17 kV of voltage. Resolution values of 1.98 and 1.95 were obtained for Prop and 4-hydroxypropranolol enantiomers, respectively. The total analysis time was around of 15 min.

    "14": "It remains possible that the benefit from beta-blockers (BBs) in chronic heart failure (CHF) may not entirely be derived from a class-specific effect. Several experimental reports have alluded to the capability of immunomodulation by individual BBs. Given the increasingly recognized importance of the immune system in the pathogenesis of CHF, we studied the effects of BBs on the circulating immune system of these patients. Blood samples from CHF outpatients were prospectively analyzed using flow cytometry and gating software. Results were analyzed against comprehensive clinical details that were recorded during sample donation, including the type of BB administered. 273 blood samples were analyzed from 141 CHF patients, with an average ejection fraction of 31.9% and a mean age of 69.1 years. Patients taking carvedilol had a significantly lower expression of CD107a on cytotoxic T cells compared to bisoprolol (P= 0.001) and nebivolol (P= 0.008). They also had a significantly lower expression of HLA-DR on lymphocytes (P < 0.001 and P= 0.009 for bisoprolol and nebivolol, respectively). Cytotoxic T cells and lymphocytes expressing HLA-DR have been implicated in the pathogenesis of CHF. The fact that carvedilol, but not other commonly used beta-blockers, appears to modulate these important parameters, supports the concept that important differences exist between these agents, which may affect outcomes in CHF.",

CYP2D6 shows a high degree of interindividual variability, which is primarily due to the extensive genetic polymorphism that influences its expression and function. A number of drugs have been clinically implicated in major drug-drug interactions (DDI) via CYP2D6 inhibition. In order to avoid or minimize issues related to CYP2D6-mediated DDIs, pharmaceutical companies routinely screen for potential CYP2D6 liability of lead candidates in the early stage of the drug discovery process.

    "16": "Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by an impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. It has been linked to each of the known atherogenic risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, cigarette smoking, menopause, etc. A number of recent studies have shown that the severity of endothelial dysfunction correlates with the development of coronary artery disease and predicts future cardiovascular events. Therefore, these findings strengthen the hypothesis that endothelial dysfunction may be an early stage of coronary atherosclerosis. This phenomenon primarily reflects an imbalance between the vasodilating (nitric oxide) and vasoconstrictor agents (endothelin-1). Several invasive (intracoronary or intrabrachial infusions of vasoacting agents) and non-invasive techniques (assessment of flow mediated vasodilatation in the brachial artery by ultrasound) have been developed during the last few years to evaluate endothelial function in the coronary and peripheral circulation. This new methodology has allowed assessing the severity of the abnormalities in vascular function and their regression by several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. It is likely that restoration of endothelial function can regress the atherosclerotic disease process and prevent future cardiovascular events. Most pharmacological interventions attempting to improve endothelial dysfunction targeted the risk factors linked to endothelial dysfunction: hypertension (ACE-inhibitors, calcium antagonists), dyslipidaemia (lipid-lowering agents) and menopause (estrogens). Nevertheless, several pharmacological agents have been suggested to achieve vascular protection through different mechanisms beyond their primary therapeutic actions: ACE-inhibitors, statins, third generation of beta-blockers (nebivolol), endothelium-derived nitric oxide synthesis (tetrahydrobiopterin, BH4) and antioxidants agents. In this review we will focus on the current pharmacological management of the endothelial dysfunction.",

Recently, potential therapeutic effect of carvedilol (CAR) has been reported by virtue of which its antioxidant and mitochondrial permeability transitional property. The present study has been designed to explore the CAR effect against D-galactose-induced behavioral, biochemical, and mitochondrial dysfunction in mice. Systemic administration of D-galactose for 6 weeks significantly impaired behavioral (learning and memory and locomotor activity), biochemical parameters (raised lipid peroxidation, nitrite concentration, depletion of reduced glutathione, and catalase activity), and mitochondrial enzymes (decreased complex I, II and III enzymes levels) as compared to sham group. CAR (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) treatment significantly improved behavioral abnormalities and biochemical and cellular alterations as compared to control. Chronic administration of D-galactose for a period of 6 week results into a significant increase of acetylcholine esterase enzyme level. CAR (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) treatment significantly attenuated the elevated level of acetylcholine esterase of mice. In conclusion, present studies highlight the protective effects of CAR against D-galactose-induced behavioral, biochemical, and mitochondrial dysfunction in mice.

    "42": "The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is not fully understood. Amyloid plaques could be causally linked to neuronal loss in AD. Two proteolytic products of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), Amyloid beta40 (Abeta40) and Amyloid beta42 (Abeta42), are considered to be critical in the neurodegeneration seen in AD. However, in transgenic mice that overexpress human Abeta40 or Abeta42, it was shown that Abeta42 was much more amyloidogenic than Abeta40. In contrast to this observation, we have found that cultured cortical neurons from mice transgenic for human Abeta40 and for Abeta42 are both and statistically equally vulnerable to nutritive challenge induced by trophic factor withdrawal (TFW). Aberrant regulation of InsP(3)R (Inositol triphosphate receptor)-mediated calcium release has been implicated in neuronal cell death. It is however not clear whether this pathway plays a critical role in cortical neurons transgenic for different species of human Abeta. We now report that Abeta40 and Abeta42 equally exacerbated intracellular calcium response to TFW in cortical neurons following TFW. When bradykinin (BK), a potent stimulant of InsP(3)R-mediated calcium release from ER, was applied to these cells, wild-type (WT) neurons exhibited a steep rise in [Ca(2+)](i) but this was not observed in either Abeta transgenic type. Similarly, when 1 muM Xestopongin C (XeC), a specific blocker of InsP(3)R, was applied to these neurons, WT cells showed a significant attenuation of increase in [Ca(2+)](i) following TFW, while elevation in [Ca(2+)](i) induced by TFW remained largely unchanged in Abeta40 and Abeta42 cells. Finally, when we treated these cells with a Ca(2+) chelator (BAPTA; 10 muM), all three cell types had a marked attenuation of [Ca(2+)](i). These findings indicate that the exacerbated calcium dysregulation following TFW in Abeta transgenic neurons are likely to be mediated by calcium channels other than ER InsP3R receptors. Overall, our results also suggest that a highly amyloidogenic Abeta species, such as Abeta42, might not necessarily be significantly more neurotoxic than a less or non-amyloidogenic Abeta species, such as Abeta40.", 
    "43": "The propensity score is a balancing score: conditional on the propensity score, treated and untreated subjects have the same distribution of observed baseline characteristics. Four methods of using the propensity score have been described in the literature: stratification on the propensity score, propensity score matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. However, the relative ability of these methods to reduce systematic differences between treated and untreated subjects has not been examined. The authors used an empirical case study and Monte Carlo simulations to examine the relative ability of the 4 methods to balance baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects. They used standardized differences in the propensity score matched sample and in the weighted sample. For stratification on the propensity score, within-quintile standardized differences were computed comparing the distribution of baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects within the same quintile of the propensity score. These quintile-specific standardized differences were then averaged across the quintiles. For covariate adjustment, the authors used the weighted conditional standardized absolute difference to compare balance between treated and untreated subjects. In both the empirical case study and in the Monte Carlo simulations, they found that matching on the propensity score and weighting using the inverse probability of treatment eliminated a greater degree of the systematic differences between treated and untreated subjects compared with the other 2 methods. In the Monte Carlo simulations, propensity score matching tended to have either comparable or marginally superior performance compared with propensity-score weighting.", 
    "44": "In this article, a single-label separation-free fluorescence technique is presented as a potential screening method for cell-based receptor antagonists and agonists.The time-resolved fluorescence technique, quenching resonance energy transfer (QRET), relies on a single-labeled binding partner in combination with a soluble quencher. The quencher efficiently suppresses the luminescence of the unbound labeled ligand, whereas the luminescence of the bound fraction is not affected. This approach allows the development of cell-based screening assays in a simple and cost-effective manner. The authors have applied the technique to the screening of beta(2)-adrenoreceptor (beta(2)AR) antagonists and agonists in intact human embryonic kidney HEK293(i) cells overexpressing human beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. Two antagonists (propranolol, alprenolol) and 2 agonists (metaproterenol, terbutaline) for beta(2)AR were investigated in a displacement assay using europium(III)-labeled pindolol ligand. The assay Z' values ranged from 0.68 to 0.78, the coefficient of variation was less than 10%, and the K(i) values were 19 nM for propranolol and alprenolol and 14 and 5.9 microM for metaproterenol and terbutaline, respectively.

There are two organizational departments that participate in medical treatments as part of the complex of modern organized hospitals: Emergency Department and Coronary Care Unit. Emergency Department is very important for providing prompt and appropriate initial care. Coronary Care Unit provides continuous monitoring of all vital functions, invasive and noninvasive hemidynamic monitoring, 24-h medical attendance, and medical telephone connection with a tertiary center. The main task of medical treatments is the prevention of sudden death, and pain and discomfort relief with the aim of maximal shortening the time elapsed from the first symptom to definitive care. In patients with myocardial infarction and ST elevation, reperfusion therapy (fibrinolytic, primary PCI) should be started within the first two hours of the disease onset. In case of unstable angina pectoris and myocardial infarction without ST elevation, the targets are as follows: stabilization and passivization of the plaque (heparin, ASA, clopidogrel), medical treatment of underlying ischemia (beta blocker, calcium channel antagonist, nitrates) and initiation of secondary prevention (ACEI). The earliest possible assessment of possible risk of disease progression or potential death is of utmost importance to define therapeutic strategy at the very beginning of treatment. Modern medical treatment of acute coronary syndrome requires the following: 24-h accessibility of Emergency Medical Service, functional of medical telephone connection and continuous education of the entire medical staff.",

The procedure was facilitated by relative hypotension induced by esmolol infusion and intravenous adenosine boluses. To allow controlled deposition of N-butyl cyanoacrylate into the arteriovenous malformations, glue injection was synchronised with the onset of adenosine-induced brief cardiac standstill. This resulted in satisfactory obliteration of the arteriovenous malformations nidus in all cases. The haemodynamic modulations, including the adenosine-induced brief cardiac standstill, was noted to not affect the BIS values in our patients. All patients had satisfactory obliteration of their arteriovenous malformations and had good neurological outcomes at one-year follow-up.",

The patients were all female, and underwent living donor liver transplantation at the age of 9 years, 1 month, and 7 months. The etiology of liver disease was cirrhosis due to biliary atresia in two patients and fulminant hepatitis in one patient. Antihypertensive therapy with calcium channel blocker alone was not effective. Blood pressure was eventually controlled after the administration of a beta-adrenergic blocker in addition to the calcium channel blocker to all patients. No end-organ damage was observed, except that two patients developed temporary left ventricular hypertrophy.",

Elevated serum glucose, nonhigh-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, homocysteine, glycosylated hemoglobin as well as large vessel atherosclerotic stroke mechanism were more frequent in high versus low FCRS patients (P<0.05). Among high FCRS patients, 35 (44%) had dobutamine stress echocardiogram performed. Leading reasons for dobutamine stress echocardiogram nonperformance were patient noncompliance (42%) and primary care physician refusal (33%).",

This was dependent on a strong inverse relationship between HR and augmentation index, indicative of increased wave reflection at lower HRs. Multiple regression, adjusted for brachial BP, showed HR to be the major determinant of central pressures. Moreover, HR and brachial BP accounted for 92% of the variability in central systolic and pulse pressures. Consequently, drug-related differences in central aortic pressures were markedly attenuated after adjustment for HR.",

Metabolic parameters such as hepatic glucose production may be altered by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in patients with heart failure. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effects of metoprolol or carvedilol up-titration on fasting glucose, insulin resistance and beta(2)-mediated glucose production in patients with chronic heart failure. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, active comparator study in 15 patients with AHA/ACC Stage C systolic dysfunction HF stable on medical therapy. Participants were randomized to metoprolol 25mg daily or carvedilol 3.125mg twice daily. Metoprolol was titrated to a target of 200mg daily, and carvedilol was titrated to 25mg twice daily over 8weeks. Insulin resistance as assessed by the homeostatic model, and terbutaline-induced glucose production (AUC(0-180)), were assessed at baseline and at 4 subsequent beta-blocker titration visits over 8 weeks. RESULTS: In all 15 patients, terbutaline-induced glucose AUC(0-180) decreased (p=0.0006) as beta-blocker doses increased. A significant reduction in glucose AUC(0-180) compared to baseline was only noted in patients taking metoprolol at 100mg daily (-2424.6 [95% CI -372.6 to -4478.4] mg/dL*min) and 200mg daily (-2437.2 [95% CI -15.1 to -4604.4] mg/dL*min), and not observed in those taking carvedilol. After beta-blocker titration, fasting glucose concentrations for the metoprolol and carvedilol groups were 86.9 (95% CI 89.8-101.6) mg/dL and 95.7 (95% CI 89.8-101.6) mg/dL, respectively (p=0.0273), adjusted for baseline values. There was no significant difference between metoprolol and carvedilol on insulin resistance. CONCLUSION: Increasing doses of beta-blockers are associated with decreased in beta2-mediated glucose production in heart failure. Metoprolol, but not carvedilol, decreases hepatic glucose production at commonly used heart failure doses.", 
    "70": "Conditioned fear memory, once formed through fear conditioning, is modulated by reexposure of individuals to a conditioned stimulus. The reexposure reactivates the fear memory, which induces reconsolidation of the memory first, and then extinction of the fear response. Both attenuating the former and facilitating the latter are effective in reducing the fear response, and these findings are potentially translatable to the enhancement of exposure therapy for complex anxiety disorders. Currently, there is no drug that is established to modulate either reconsolidation or extinction selectively, which are thought to be independent processes. Here, we report that an extinction-facilitating AMPA potentiator, 4-[2-(phenylsulfonylamino)ethylthio]-2,6-difluoro-phenoxyacetamide (PEPA), does not act on the reconsolidation of fear memory formed by contextual fear conditioning in mice. The freezing rates observed in contextually conditioned mice following short reexposure (3 min) to the context were not influenced by intraperitoneal or intra-amygdala administration of PEPA. The same short reexposure to the context enhanced freezing responses in mice that were similarly administered D-cycloserine (DCS), a drug that facilitates both extinction and reconsolidation, and this enhancement of freezing responses in mice intraperitoneally administered DCS was abolished by propranolol, a drug that suppresses reconsolidation. At the same doses used in the short reexposure experiments, PEPA and DCS facilitated extinction of the fear response induced by long reexposure to the context and suppressed reinstatement of the conditioned fear memory. PEPA and DCS did not affect reextinction. These results suggest that PEPA acts on extinction of contextual fear memory without having detectable influences on its reconsolidation.", 
    "71": "We designed our study to investigate the efficacy of a new therapeutic approach to late onset hypertension in patients after surgical repair of aortic coarctation. Several studies have shown a higher incidence of hypertension during daily activities, and during exercise, in patients after surgical correction of coarctation. To the best of our knowledge, however, no data exists concerning haemodynamics, the response of arterial pressures, and the effects of medications for lowering blood pressure during exercise or during daily activities.We studied 128 patients, aged 15.6 +/- 4.3 years, to determine the response of blood pressure as we administered treatment in the attempt to achieve a normotensive state. We excluded patient with associated cardiac abnormalities, apart from those with bicuspid aortic valves. We evaluated blood pressure at rest in both the right arm and leg to establish presence of any gradient, as well as the blood pressure in the arm during exercise testing, and by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring.Atenolol was prescribed for those with elevated values of blood pressure but with a normal increment of heart rate during exercise. We prescribed Candesartan for those with elevated levels of blood pressure but with reduced increments of heart rate, specifically maximal heart rates of less than 85% of their predicted value. Both drugs were used when one alone was not effective. We found that, in young patients, candesartan provided better control of blood pressure with no side-effects, especially as demonstrated using 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, while atenolol was less effective, with more side-effects. Our experience suggests that both drugs should be used in patients who are non-responsive to monotherapy.", 
    "72": "Major oxidation products (OPs) of the beta blocker propranolol, formed during ozonation in aqueous solution were identified and oxidation pathways were proposed. Ozonation led to a high number of OPs being formed. In total, chemical structures were elucidated for five different nominal masses (including constitutional isomers, approximately 13 signals), whereas at least eight other OPs and their isomers (approximately 30 signals) remained unidentified. The structural elucidation was performed via liquid chromatography coupled with hybride triple quadrupole with linear ion trap (LC-Qq LIT MS). The primary ozonation product OP-291, was formed by ozone attacking the naphthalene ring, which resulted in the ring-opening and two aldehyde moieties being formed. OP-291 was further oxidized to OP-307, which was then oxidized to OP-281. Experiments were performed at pH 3 and pH 8, as well as in the presence and absence of a radical scavenger. Ozonation of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents spiked with propranolol (10 microM) led to the same OPs being formed as observed in the experiments with deionized water. Therefore, ozonation of WWTP effluent is resulting in the formation of a high number of OPs with an elevated toxic potential (i.e., formation of aldehydes).", 
    "73": "Atherosclerosis and osteoporosis are highly prevalent chronic diseases that affect populations of similar ages who are clinically asymptomatic until complications appear. Therefore, research into new drugs that are useful for both processes and may improve therapeutic compliance appears to be reasonable. beta-blockers are widely used in the treatment of hypertension and its complications, ischemic heart disease and heart failure. Their use has been associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality. Experimental data have demonstrated that the sympathetic nervous system inhibits bone formation and increases resorption due to the binding of catecholamines to receptors located in osteoblasts. This produces a decrease in bone mineral density and a higher risk of fractures. The effect is eliminated by the administration of beta-blockers. Retrospective case-control and cohort studies have shown a beneficial effect of beta-blockers on fractures reduction, with a protective effect being observed in eight studies and no effect being found in two studies. The aim of this paper is review these data and the possible role of beta-blockers in the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in patients with cardiovascular disease.", 
    "74": "The objective of present study was to develop a gastroretentive drug delivery system of propranolol hydrochloride. The biggest problem in oral drug delivery is low and erratic drug bioavailability. The ability of various polymers to retain the drug when used in different concentrations was investigated. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) K4 M, HPMC E 15 LV, hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC; Klucel HF), xanthan gum, and sodium alginate (Keltose) were evaluated for their gel-forming abilities. One of the disadvantages in using propranolol is extensive first pass metabolism of drug and only 25% reaches systemic circulation. The bioavailability of propranolol increases in presence of food. Also, the absorption of various drugs such as propranolol through P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter is low and erratic. The density of P-gp increases toward the distal part of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Therefore, it was decided to formulate floating tablet of propranolol so that it remains in the upper part of GIT for longer time. They were evaluated for physical properties, in vitro release as well as in vivo behavior. In preliminary trials, tablets formulated with HPC, sodium alginate, and HPMC E 15 LV failed to produce matrix of required strength, whereas formulation containing xanthan gum showed good drug retaining abilities but floating abilities were found to be poor. Finally, floating tablets were formulated with HPMC K4 M and HPC.", 
    "75": "We report the characterisation of 27 cardiovascular-related traits in 23 inbred mouse strains. Mice were phenotyped either in response to chronic administration of a single dose of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker atenolol or under a low and a high dose of the beta-agonist isoproterenol and compared to baseline condition. The robustness of our data is supported by high trait heritabilities (typically H(2)>0.7) and significant correlations of trait values measured in baseline condition with independent multistrain datasets of the Mouse Phenome Database. We then focused on the drug-, dose-, and strain-specific responses to beta-stimulation and beta-blockade of a selection of traits including heart rate, systolic blood pressure, cardiac weight indices, ECG parameters and body weight. Because of the wealth of data accumulated, we applied integrative analyses such as comprehensive bi-clustering to investigate the structure of the response across the different phenotypes, strains and experimental conditions. Information extracted from these analyses is discussed in terms of novelty and biological implications. For example, we observe that traits related to ventricular weight in most strains respond only to the high dose of isoproterenol, while heart rate and atrial weight are already affected by the low dose. Finally, we observe little concordance between strain similarity based on the phenotypes and genotypic relatedness computed from genomic SNP profiles. This indicates that cardiovascular phenotypes are unlikely to segregate according to global phylogeny, but rather be governed by smaller, local differences in the genetic architecture of the various strains.",

    "78": "247 patients (11.9%) were administered beta-blockers and 1,828 patients (88.1%) were not. Whereas patients treated with beta-blockers had a higher prevalence of hypertension and coronary heart disease, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that all-cause mortality rates were significantly (p < 0.007) decreased in patients treated with beta-blockers compared to those without. In multivariable, fully adjusted models, treatment with beta-blockers was also independently associated with reduced all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 0.48; p = 0.02).",

    "81": "Two primiparous women are presented to illustrate the management of PVC during pregnancy and discuss the delivery route according to the symptoms and the PVC complications. The first patient presented PVC associated with large jejunal varices and high anticardiolipid antibodies. She was treated with beta-blocker therapy and low molecular weight heparin during pregnancy, and delivered by cesarean section. The second patient presented protein S deficiency complicated by PVC and thrombocytopenia and delivered vaginally without complications.", 
    "82": "Many issues should be considered when counseling women with PVC, including the management before and during pregnancy according to symptoms and PVC complications. A multidisciplinary approach seems to be key to the management of delivery. Our advice to caregivers is that elective cesarean section seems necessary in cases with digestive varices. Vaginal delivery, with a passive second stage, seems to be relatively safe and less morbid in women without digestive varices, when maternal and fetal tolerance permits.", 
    "83": "We investigated the effects of dose and intrasubject variability (ISV) on bioequivalence (BE) of a parent drug with a single metabolite formed by nonlinear first-pass. A BE simulation was done using a four-compartment model at doses of 17.5, 35.0, and 70.0 mg. ISV was set at either 10% or 20% for clearance and either 20% or 50% for the absorption rate constant, K(a). The ratio of Katest/Kreference was fixed at 1.00 while fraction available ratios, F(test)/F(reference), were varied from 1.00 to 1.25. Results showed the probability of passing the 90% confidence interval (CI) BE requirement for AUC(I), area-under-the-concentration curve to time infinity, and C(max), concentration maximum, were greater for the metabolite than the parent at all F(test)/F(reference) ratios. For the parent, the probability of meeting BE criteria for AUC(I) and C(max) declined from 100% to 60% at the 70 mg dose as the ISV for K(a) increased from 20% to 50% with an increased F(test)/F(reference) ratio. For the metabolite, the probability of meeting BE criteria was above 80% for all doses and ISV values and F(test)/F(reference) ratios less than 1.15. Results show that the parent, reflected absorption, is more informative for determining BE than the metabolite. Clinical data gave a similar result.",

After having identified the most relevant channel subtype (N-type VDCCs), we correlated immunohistochemistry of channel expression with ON histopathology. In the confirmatory part of this work, we performed a treatment study using omega-conotoxin GVIA, an N-type specific blocker.", 
    "86": "We observed that pathological Ca(2+) influx into ONs during optic neuritis is mediated via N-type VDCCs. By analyzing the expression of VDCCs in the inflamed ONs, we detected an upregulation of alpha(1B), the pore-forming subunit of N-type VDCCs, in demyelinated axons. However, high expression levels were also found on macrophages/activated microglia, and lower levels were detected on astrocytes. The relevance of N-type VDCCs for inflammation-induced axonal degeneration and the severity of optic neuritis was corroborated by treatment with omega-conotoxin GVIA. This blocker led to decreased axon and myelin degeneration in the ONs together with a reduced number of macrophages/activated microglia. These protective effects were confirmed by analyzing the spinal cords of the same animals.", 
    "87": "We conclude that N-type VDCCs play an important role in inflammation-induced axon degeneration via two mechanisms: First, they directly mediate toxic Ca(2+) influx into the axons; and second, they contribute to macrophage/microglia function, thereby promoting secondary axonal damage.

    "88": "Lowering IOP is the most readily modifiable risk factor to delay the development and progression of glaucoma (POAG). The fixed combination of brimonidine tartrate 0.2% and timolol maleate 0.5% (FCBT) combines a highly selective alpha2-adrenergic agonist (brimonidine) with a non-selective beta-blocker (timolol). FCBT reduces aqueous production and enhances uveoscleral outflow. Concomitant brimonidine and timolol have additive effects on reducing intraocular pressure (IOP). Multi-center randomized control trials have documented superiority of FCBT twice daily on IOP control compared with monotherapy with the individual components, and equal efficacy compared with concomitant therapy. IOP reduction with FCBT versus fixed combination dorzolamide 2% and timolol 0.5% (FCDT) was similar in a small study. Other studies (n > 293) evaluating concomitant brimonidine and timolol have shown that it is not inferior to FCDT. However, concomitant brimonidine and timolol administered twice daily was significantly less efficacious in IOP reduction than fixed combination latanoprost 0.005% and timolol 0.5% (FCLT). There are no published studies comparing FCBT with FCLT. The side effect profile for FCBT reflects that of its individual components. FCBT was generally well tolerated, with less ocular side effects than brimondine alone, but more than timolol alone. Documented systemic effects were few, although this could be confounded by selection bias. FCBT is a safe and effective IOP lowering agent for POAG and ocular hypertension.", 
    "89": "After atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter (AFL) is the most important and most common atrial tachyarrhythmia. Atrial flutter describes an electrocardiographic model of atrial tachycardia >or=240/min, with a uniform and regular continuous wave-form. There is classically a 2:1 conduction across the atrioventricular (AV) node; as a result, the ventricular rate is usually one-half the flutter rate in the absence of AV node dysfunction. AFL can be harmful by impairing the cardiac output and by encouraging atrial thrombus formation that can lead to systemic embolization. There are four major concerns that must be addressed in the treatment of AFL: reversion to normal sinus rhythm (NSR); maintenance of NSR; control of the ventricular rate; and prevention of systemic embolization. Our review will highlight strategies for reverting patients back to NSR and then maintaining them in NSR, with emphasis on the recent updates, including the role of ablation in the management of atrial flutter.",

The efficacy of landiolol was evaluated in 38 patients who, after developing postoperative atrial flutter or fibrillation, with sinus tachycardia and two patients who had a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with frequent atrial extrasystole. The heart rate and blood pressure before and 2 h after the administration of landiolol were compared. A return to the sinus rhythm from supraventricular arrhythmia was noted in 89%. The heart rate was reduced from 137+/-26 bpm (before landiolol administration) to 93+/-18 bpm (2 h after the start of the medication, P<0.01). As an agent to correct an arrhythmic condition, landiolol successfully raised the systolic blood pressure from 108+/-24 mmHg (before medication) to 120+/-19 mmHg (2 h after the medication was started, P<0.05). Continuous intravenous infusion of landiolol at a low dose was found to be effective for postoperative supraventricular arrhythmia.",

The patients were evaluated with 12-leads electrocardiography and echocardiography before and three months after treatment with nebivolol. The difference between maximum and minimum P wave durations was defined as P-wave dispersion (PWD). Early diastolic flow (E), atrial contraction wave (A) and E deceleration time (DT) and isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) were measured.

    "95": "Given that extracellular ATP is markedly elevated in inflammation and is known to modulate fibroblast function, we examined the effects of exogenously added ATP on Ca(2+)-handling and gene expression in human pulmonary fibroblasts. Cells were loaded with the Ca(2+)-indicator dye fluo-4 and studied using confocal fluorimetry. Standard RT-PCR was used to probe gene expression. ATP (10(-5)M) evoked recurring Ca(2+)-waves which were completely occluded by cyclopiazonic acid (depletes the internal Ca(2+)-store) or the phospholipase inhibitor U73122. Pretreatment with ryanodine (10(-5)M), however, had no effect on the ATP-evoked responses. Regarding the receptor through which ATP acted, we found the ATP-response to be mimicked by UTP or ADP but not by adenosine or alpha,beta-methylene-ATP, and to be blocked by the purinergic receptor blocker PPADS. The ATP-evoked response was greater and longer lasting within the nucleus than in the non-nuclear portion of the cytosol. RT-PCR showed that ATP also rapidly and dramatically increased gene expression of P2Y(4) receptors, the cytokine TGF-beta (an important modulator of wound repair) and two matrix proteins (collagen A1 and fibronectin) approximately 4-5 times above baseline: this increase was not significantly affected by ryanodine but was abolished by PPADS. We conclude that, in human pulmonary fibroblasts, ATP acts upon P2Y receptors to liberate internal Ca(2+) through ryanodine-insensitive channels, leading to a Ca(2+)-wave which courses throughout the cell and modulates gene expression.", 
    "96": "Clinicians are increasingly asked what they can do to evaluate and lower the risk of perioperative cardiac complications. Approximately 4 decades ago, there were few tools to guide the evaluation of perioperative risk. The American Society of Anesthesiology Classification System (ASA class) gave only a vague idea of the risk patients faced during surgery, but the modern era of clinical risk assessment for perioperative complications has seen the introduction of tools that allow clinicians to estimate risk, and also the addition of stress testing for assessing perioperative risk. None of these tests, however, were designed to identify perioperative cardiac risk. This article reviews the literature on perioperative risk assessment, risk reduction, and testing modalities in patients with cardiac disease, along with the role of perioperative angioplasty and the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.", 
    "97": "The recently determined crystal structure of the human beta(2)-adrenergic (beta(2)AR) G-protein-coupled receptor provides an excellent structural basis for exploring beta(2)AR-ligand binding and dissociation process. Based on this crystal structure, we simulated ligand exit from the beta(2)AR receptor by applying the random acceleration molecular dynamics (RAMD) simulation method. The simulation results showed that the extracellular opening on the receptor surface was the most frequently observed egress point (referred to as pathway A), and a few other pathways through interhelical clefts were also observed with significantly lower frequencies. In the egress trajectories along pathway A, the D192-K305 salt bridge between the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) and the apex of the transmembrane helix 7 (TM7) was exclusively broken. The spatial occupancy maps of the ligand computed from the 100 RAMD simulation trajectories indicated that the receptor-ligand interactions that restrained the ligand in the binding pocket were the major resistance encountered by the ligand during exit and no second barrier was notable. We next performed RAMD simulations by using a putative ligand-free conformation of the receptor as input structure. This conformation was obtained in a standard molecular dynamics simulation in the absence of the ligand and it differed from the ligand-bound conformation in a hydrophobic patch bridging ECL2 and TM7 due to the rotation of F193 of ECL2. Results from the RAMD simulations with this putative ligand-free conformation suggest that the cleft formed by the hydrophobic bridge, TM2, TM3, and TM7 on the extracellular surface likely serves as a more specific ligand-entry site and the ECL2-TM7 hydrophobic junction can be partially interrupted upon the entry of ligand that pushes F193 to rotate, resulting in a conformation as observed in the ligand-bound crystal structure. These results may help in the design of beta(2)AR-targeting drugs with improved efficacy, as well as in understanding the receptor subtype selectivity of ligand binding in the beta family of the adrenergic receptors that share almost identical ligand-binding pockets, but show notable amino acid sequence divergence in the putative ligand-entry site, including ECL2 and the extracellular end of TM7.",

The mean resting heart rate was 70+/-6 bpm; the distribution was: 7% for <60 bpm, 38% for 60-69, 38% for 70-79bpm, 14% for 80-89bpm, and 2% for>90bpm.

The BEAUTIFUL trial tested ivabradine against placebo in a large population of 10,917 patients in sinus rhythm, with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, defined as left ventricular ejection fraction < or =35%. Overall, there was no impact of ivabradine on the primary end-point of the trial (cardiovascular mortality, hospitalisation for myocardial infarction, new onset or worsening heart failure). In the placebo arm of the trial, baseline heart rate > or = 70 bpm was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure and coronary revascularisation. In the subgroup of patients with a baseline heart rate > or =70 bpm, treatment with ivabradine resulted in a significant, 36% reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction and a 20% reduction in the need for coronary revascularisation. Ivabradine was well tolerated, with an increased rate of treatment discontinuation, mainly due to bradycardia, compared with placebo. Because of its safety and efficacy to control angina, ivabradine should be considered first-line antianginal treatment in coronary artery disease patients with left ventricular dysfunction and increased heart rate, already receiving beta-blocker therapy or in whom these medications are not tolerated.",

Previous studies of the interaction between the selective beta(1)-blocker bisoprolol and kidney function were performed only for short- and medium-term periods.

    "112": "Metabolic syndrome (MS) is an independent risk factor for chronic kidney diseases. As the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is known to have a key role in renal damage, blockade of RAS may show renoprotective effects in MS. In this study, we investigated the renoprotective effects and mechanisms of action of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR/NDmcr-cp) rats as a model of MS. Male SHR/NDmcr-cp rats at 9 weeks of age were divided into three groups, each of which was treated for 12 weeks with vehicle, hydralazine (7.5 mg kg(-1) per day, p.o.) or ARB (olmesartan, 5 mg kg(-1) per day, p.o.). Blood pressure and urinary protein (UP) excretion were monitored. Kidney tissues were subjected to histological, immunohistochemical and molecular analyses. UP excretion increased with age in vehicle-treated SHR/NDmcr-cp rats compared with that in age-matched WKY/Izm rats. In addition, there was significant glomerular damage (increased glomerular sclerosis index, desmin staining and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells, electron microscopic findings of podocyte injury) and tubulointerstitial damage (increased tubulointerstitial fibrosis index, type IV collagen staining, PCNA-positive cells and expression of TGF-beta mRNA) in vehicle-treated SHR/NDmcr-cp rats compared with that in control rats. All the findings that related to glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage were significantly improved by ARB. Hydralazine mitigated the observed renal damage but was much less effective than ARB, despite similar decreases in blood pressure. There were no significant differences in glucose and lipid metabolism among vehicle-treated, hydralazine-treated and ARB-treated SHR/NDmcr-cp animals. These data suggest that RAS is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of renal damage in MS, and ARBs could provide a powerful renoprotective regimen for patients with MS.", 
    "113": "Androgens produce acute vasodilation of systemic, pulmonary, and coronary arteries in several mammal preparations and increase cardiomyocyte contractility. A decrease of the spontaneous beating of sinoatrial cells has also been described. The aim of this study was to characterize the direct effect of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone on the spontaneous chronotropism and inotropism in the same preparation as an approach to establish the effect on cardiac output and their mechanism of action. The effects were studied on isolated right atria of Wistar rats placed in an organ bath in Tyrode solution at 37 degrees C and bubbled with carbogen. In male rats, the acute administration of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone, a nonaromatizable derivate of testosterone, elicited a positive inotropism, which was associated with a negative chronotropism. As reported in the left atria, polyamines and beta-adrenoceptors played a role in 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone-elicited positive inotropism because the effect was antagonized by alpha-difluoromethylornithine, an inhibitor of polyamine synthesis, and atenolol, a beta1-adrenoceptor blocker, but not on the negative effect on chronotropism. The androgen increased the sinoatrial node recovery time, suggesting an effect on the mechanisms of spontaneous diastolic depolarization involved in atria pacemaking. These effects of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone are not hormonally regulated because they are similarly produced in estrogenized females and gonadectomized male and female rats. These results suggest that the androgen could acutely improve cardiac performance.",

The potential benefits and risks of therapeutically blocking NCX1 in heart failure and during ischemia-reperfusion are being actively investigated. In this study, we demonstrate that prolonged administration of the NCX1 inhibitor KB-R7943 resulted in the up-regulation of Ncx1 gene expression in both isolated adult cardiomyocytes and intact mouse hearts. Ncx1 up-regulation is mediated by the activation of p38. Importantly, p38 is not activated by KB-R7943 treatment in heart tubes from Ncx1(-/-) mice at 9.5 days postcoitum but is activated in heart tubes from Ncx1(+/+) mice. p38 activation does not appear to be in response to changes in cytosolic calcium concentration, [Ca(2+)](i). Interestingly, chronic KB-R7943 treatment in mice leads to the formation of an NCX1-p38 complex. Our study demonstrates for the first time that the electrogenic sarcolemma membrane cardiac NCX1 can act as a regulator of \"activity-dependent signal transduction\" leading to changes in gene expression.",

    "130": "Through inhibitory and excitatory effects on sympathetic neurons, B(2) bradykinin receptors contribute to protective and noxious cardiovascular mechanisms. Presynaptic inhibition of sympathetic transmitter release involves an inhibition of Ca(V)2 channels, neuronal excitation an inhibition of K(V)7 channels. To investigate which of these mechanisms prevail over time, the respective currents were determined. The inhibition of Ca(2+) currents by bradykinin reached a maximum of 50%, started to fade within the first minute, and became attenuated significantly after > or = 4 min. The inhibition of K(+) currents reached a maximum of 85%, started to fade after > 3 min, and became attenuated significantly after > or = 7 min. Blocking Ca(2+)-independent protein kinase C (PKC) enhanced the inhibition of Ca(2+) currents by bradykinin and delayed its fading, left the inhibition of K(+) currents and its fading unaltered, and enhanced the reduction of noradrenaline release and slowed its fading. Conversely, direct activation of PKC abolished the inhibition of noradrenaline release and largely attenuated the inhibition of Ca(2+) currents. These results show that the inhibitory effects of bradykinin in sympathetic neurons are outweighed over time by its excitatory actions because of more rapid, PKC-dependent fading of the inhibitory response.",

The influence on enantioresolution, mobility difference and selectivity of the nature of both anionic CD and BGE anion as well as their concentrations were studied by means of a multivariate approach. A D-optimal design with 25 experimental points was applied. For all studied analytes, the enantiomeric resolution was shown to be significantly influenced by both CD nature and concentration. Except for two compounds, HDAS-beta-CD was found to give higher enantioresolution values than HDMS-beta-CD. The best enantioseparation for all compounds was achieved in the presence of a high chiral selector concentration and for most of them at a low BGE anion concentration. For each investigated compound, operating conditions leading to the best enantiomeric resolution were deduced. A generic NACE system was then recommended, namely 10 mM ammonium acetate and 40 mM HDAS-beta-CD in methanol acidified with 0.75 M formic acid. This generic system was able to completely resolve the enantiomers of all beta-blockers, with a R(s) value of at least 4.

Drugs from different pharmacological classes are used for migraine prophylaxis. These agents may normalize neuronal excitability by modulating distinct ionic channels and various neurotransmitter systems. They can also block cortical spreading depression, prevent peripheral and/or central pain sensitization, and normalize brainstem function. Most of the drugs recently used in migraine prophylaxis have been identified by serendipidy and they have been originally approved for other indications. Subsequently, their use has been extended to migraine prevention, according to their putative mechanisms of action. More recently, trials on adequate samples of migraine patients have been conducted for several drugs. In the present review, we will present and discuss the pathophysiological bases for the use of antidepressants, beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers and antiepileptic drugs in migraine prevention. Currently, the major classes of conventional migraine preventive drugs include the antidepressant amitriptyline, the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol, and the antiepileptic drugs topiramate and valproic acid. Promising results have recently been obtained for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers. Some limited clinical findings have also been reported for atypical antipsychotic agents, nutritional supplements and also botulinum toxin.

Saline solution (SS) or mineral oil (MO) were selected as vehicles. The MO increased the permeability coefficient (K(p)) of PR-Bz (pK(p) approximately 4) of about four times with respect to SS (pK(p) approximately 8) probably due to the ion pair formation. The steady-state flux of S-enantiomers resulted about twofold higher than that of racemates according to their lower melting temperatures with the exception of (S)-PR-Ol and (RS)-PR-Ol vehicled in SS which not resulted statistically different. This anomalous result could be explained considering the behavior of (RS)-PR-Ol or (S)-PR-Ol in aqueous solutions: these salts formed ion pairs which associated to form aggregates up to a concentration of 20 microg/mL as verified by light scattering. Therefore, their effective concentrations in SS resulted similar and justified the overlapped skin permeation profiles.

In this study, the chiral surfactant, dodecoxycarbonylvaline (DDCV), along with the co-surfactant, 2-hexanol, has been prepared as swollen micelle in order to investigate the chiral separation of enantiomeric pairs. Three sets of experiments were investigated in which swollen micelle systems contained: chiral surfactant and racemic co-surfactant; chiral surfactant and chiral co-surfactant; and phase ratio increases, in which both chiral surfactant and chiral co-surfactant were employed. In the first two sets of experiments, co-surfactant concentration was held constant and the surfactant concentration was increased. In the third set of experiments, both surfactant and chiral surfactant concentrations were increased proportionally. The chromatographic figures of merit for each enantiomeric pair were investigated and compared with various chiral aggregate systems. In swollen micelle compositions using constant racemic 2-hexanol concentration, when DDCV concentration increased, enantioselectivity and resolution increased; whereas, efficiency remained constant for most of the test compounds. Compositions using constant S-2-hexanol concentration reached a maximum in all chromatographic figures of merit when DDCV concentration was increased from 2 to 3%.

Although the prompt restoration of antegrade blood flow in the infarct-related coronary artery is the mean therapy for improving survival, reperfusion itself may cause damage to ischaemic myocardial tissue. This event is well known as \"reperfusion injury\". Crucial mediators for cardiac damage in the reperfusion phases are oxidative stress, inflammation and leukocyte infiltration. Already approved and novel therapies might directly reduce these inflammatory processes. Treatments modulating chemokine secretion and activity should be considered as very promising approaches to reduce myocardial reperfusion injury.",

Mechanisms for seizure production, seen in past animal studies, have not been described. Increased calcium levels contribute to excitotoxicity, so in this study neuroblastoma cells are loaded with calcium-indicating dye before application of 1.5 microM to 7.5 mM RDX, with fluorescence recorded for 30 cycles of 11 seconds each. The lowest concentration of RDX increases calcium fluorescence significantly above baseline for cycles 2 to 8; millimolar concentrations increase calcium fluorescence significantly above baseline for cycles 2 to 30. Increases in calcium, like those of 200 nM carbachol, are prevented with 10 mM of calcium chelator ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N,N tetra-acetic acid (EGTA, tetrasodium salt). Calcium channel blocker verapamil (20 microM), Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (5 microM), and general membrane stabilizer lidocaine (10 mM) partially attenuate carbachol- and RDX-induced increases in calcium, suggesting that RDX transiently increases intracellular calcium by multiple mechanisms.",

For reasons of comparison, polymeric films containing the free base metoprolol or free tartaric acid were also prepared. Systems containing various amounts of the free base, free acid and the salt were characterised using polarising light microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and mechanical analysis (puncture test). The free base is the most efficient plasticiser of the three species for Eudragit RL and Eudragit RS, but with limited solubility in the polymers. Due to its hydrophobicity, it can interact with the hydrophobic polymer backbones. In contrast, in salt containing films, ionic interactions between the positively charged quaternary ammonium groups and the negatively charged tartrate anions apparently occur, this being suggested by the different effects on Eudragit RL versus RS, which have different contents of quaternary ammonium groups. Importantly, the combination of acid and base as a salt avoids drug precipitation at higher metoprolol contents. The obtained new insight into the occurring drug-polymer interactions can help to facilitate the development/optimisation of this type of dosage forms.",

Propranolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, has recently been introduced as a novel modality for the treatment of proliferating hemangiomas. This report illustrates the successful management of tracheal hemangiomas using oral propranolol in a young patient with otherwise treatment-resistant airway lesions. Despite various endoscopic therapeutic attempts, the patient remained stridulous with airway disease that persisted into the involution phase of the average hemangioma cycle. Within 6 weeks of beginning oral propranolol (2 mg/kg/day), her airway compromise was eliminated and she had complete resolution of endoscopically visible disease. No side effects from propranolol occurred. We propose that oral propranolol should be considered for use in airway hemangiomas.", 
    "160": "Modern drug discovery chemical libraries contain a large number of molecular entities exhibiting low aqueous solubility, often necessitating the inclusion of solubilizing agents in preclinical models of absorption or metabolism. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of several commonly used polyethoxylated solubilizing agents on P450 (CYP) 3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the rat intestinal mucosa. Atenolol and verapamil were administered in the in situ perfused rat intestine or incubated with rat intestinal microsomes in the presence or absence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 (2% or 20%, v/v) D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS; 100 microg/mL), Cremophor EL (47.5 microg/mL) or polysorbate (Tween) 80 (25 microg/mL). Effects on the absorption of unchanged drug were minimal, with the exception of Tween 80 which caused a 5.0-fold increase in paracellular absorption. Rat intestinal CYP3A was significantly inhibited by PEG-400 and in situ, exceeded inhibition observed with ketoconazole. Cremophor and TPGS increased the fraction of norverapamil in the plasma, consistent with excipient-mediated inhibition of P-gp. These results suggest that caution be exercised when these solubilizing agents are included in preclinical oral dosing solutions as the perturbation of drug absorption barriers may heighten the risk of incorrectly classifying drug candidate PK-parameters.",

Mean age of patients was 76.1 years, 35% of patients had an ejection fraction of >35%, and 37% were women resulting in a unique cohort, far more representative of clinical practice than previous trials. eGFR was strongly associated with outcomes and nebivolol was similarly efficacious across eGFR tertiles. The primary outcome rate (all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospital admission) and adjusted hazard ratio for nebivolol use in those with low eGFR was 40% and 0.84 (95% CI 0.67-1.07), 31% and 0.79 (0.60-1.04) in the middle tertile, and 29% and 0.86 (0.65-1.14) in the highest eGFR tertile.

    "165": "The 2005 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology heart failure (HF) guidelines contributed to a renewed focus on \"at-risk\" patients and emphasized HF as a progressive disease. Patient categorization by stages focused attention on customization of therapy to achieve optimal, evidence-based treatments across the HF continuum. Therapy for risk factors that predispose patients to left ventricular dysfunction or other symptoms may help reduce HF development. beta-Blockers are valuable for treatment of HF; however, the class is heterogeneous, and proper beta-blocker selection for each HF stage is important. beta-Blockers have been used routinely to treat patients with stage A HF with hypertension. Recent controversy regarding the detrimental effects that some beta-blockers have on metabolic parameters has raised inappropriate concerns about the use of any beta-blocker for diabetes. beta-Blockade is standard therapy for the patient with stage B HF who has had a myocardial infarction, but few data are available concerning use in asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Additionally, beta-blockers are part of the core therapy for stage C HF and selected patients with stage D HF. This review examines the role and use of beta-blockers in each HF stage through an evidence-based approach to provide better understanding of their importance in this progressive disease. PubMed searches (1980-2008) identified large clinical trials that evaluated cardiovascular events and outcomes in any HF stage or hypertension. Search terms were heart failure, hypertension, beta-blocker, ACEI, ARB, and calcium channel blocker AND blood pressure coronary artery disease, diabetes, efficacy, left ventricular dysfunction, metabolism, mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke.", 
    "166": "Although frequency-domain analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been performed in the setting of exercise and recovery from exercise, the relationship of specific frequency components to sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs has not been validated in this setting. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship of frequency components of HRV to sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation in the setting of recovery after exercise using selective autonomic blockade. Normal subjects (n = 27, 17 men, 53 +/- 7 yr old) underwent bicycle stress testing on four separate days. On day 1, a baseline study without autonomic blockade was performed. On days 2 through 4, either beta-adrenergic, parasympathetic, or double blockade was administered during exercise and completed 3 min before recovery. Continuous ECG was recorded for 5 min starting from the end of exercise. Time- and frequency-domain measures of HRV were computed for each of the five 1-min segments of RR intervals. Parasympathetic blockade significantly decreased all the HRV measures compared with baseline (P < 0.02 for all). Root mean square of successive differences of RR intervals (rMSSD) was increased by beta-adrenergic blockade (P < 0.0002). All the HRV measures except rMSSD showed increases with time after the first minute of recovery. The low frequency-to-high frequency ratio did not respond to autonomic blockade or to recovery time, consistent with the expected changes in sympathovagal influence. Root mean square (detrended SD) and rMSSD were highly correlated with the square root of the total power (r = 0.96) and high-frequency power (r = 0.95), respectively. Although there are marked reductions in the frequency-domain measures in recovery versus rest, the fluctuations in the low- and high-frequency bands respond to autonomic blockade in the expected fashion. Time-domain measures of HRV were highly correlated with frequency-domain measures and therefore provide a computationally more efficient assessment of autonomic influences during recovery from exercise that is less susceptible to anomalies of frequency-domain analysis.",

Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) measurements were performed in parallel with the metoprolol tartrate release study to track the free volume changes of patches. Second-order polynomial relationship was found, with good correlation, between the metoprolol tartrate released at the 6th hour, the o-positronium lifetime, indicating the free volume of the polymer, and the Metolose SM 4000 relative proportions. The main reason for this correlation is the change in the free volume size of the polymer patches embedding metoprolol tartrate as a function of the relative proportion of Metolose 90SH 100.000SR containing hydroxypropoxy substitution. Since there were no significant changes between the free volumes of Metolose polymers at any ratio of the constituents in the case of lack of metoprolol tartrate, the free volume changes refer to a possible intermolecular interaction between the polymer and the active agent.",

    "173": "The study was undertaken to explore: i) the presence of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors (AR) on thymic lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells and ii) their putative role in T-cell development. The expression of alpha(1)-AR on thymic cells was assessed using both immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric analyses, while their putative role in thymopoiesis was estimated by analyses of thymocyte proliferation and apoptosis, and major thymocyte subset distribution in adult rats subjected to 14-day-long treatment with the alpha(1)-AR blocker urapidil. The presence of alpha(1)-AR was demonstrated on both thymocytes (mainly less mature CD3(-) and CD3(low) cells) and thymic non-lymphoid cells (thymic epithelial cells and CD68-positive cells). Chronic treatment with urapidil increased the thymic weight and thymocyte number. The increase in thymocyte number might, at least partly, be related to an enhanced thymocyte proliferation. In addition, an altered thymocyte subset distribution was observed in these rats. The increase in the percentage of CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) TCRalphabeta(-) thymocytes was accompanied by the reduction in that of CD4+CD8+ (DP) TCRalphabeta(low) cells, and divergent changes in the percentage of the most mature single positive (SP) TCRalphabeta(high) thymocytes. In urapidil-administered rats the percentage of CD4+CD8- SP TCRalphabeta(high) thymocytes was increased, while that of the CD4-CD8+ TCRalphabeta(high) was reduced, compared with controls. In addition, proportions of CD4+CD25+RT6.1- and CD161+TCRalphabeta+ regulatory cells were increased. Collectively, the results indicate that alpha(1)-AR are involved in complex network of neuro-thymic and intrathymic communications that provide fine tuning of both conventional effector and regulatory T-cell development.",

Stage A refers to patients without structural heart disease but at risk to develop chronic heart failure. The major risk factors in stage A are hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, family history of coronary artery disease and history of cardiotoxic drug use. In this stage, blockers hypertension is the primary area in which beta blockers may be useful. Beta blockers seem not to be superior to other medication in reducing the development of heart failure due to hypertension. Stage B heart failure refers to structural heart disease but without symptoms of heart failure. This includes patients with asymptomatic valvular disease, asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, previous myocardial infarction with or without LV dysfunction. In asymptomatic valvular disease no data are available on the efficacy of beta blockers to prevent heart failure. In asymptomatic LV dysfunction only few asymptomatic patients have been enrolled in the trials which tested beta blockers. NYHA I patients were barely 228 in the MDC, MERIT and ANZ trials altogether. The REVERT trial was the only trial focusing on NYHA I patients with LV ejection fraction less than 40%. Metoprolol extended release on top of ACE inhibitors ameliorated LV systolic volume and ejection fraction. A post hoc analysis of the SOLVD Prevention trial demonstrated that beta blockers reduced death and development of heart failure. Similar results were reported in post MI patients in a post hoc analysis of the SAVE trial (Asymptomatic LV failure post myocardial infarction). In the CAPRICORN trial about 65% of the patients were not taking diuretics and then could be considered asymptomatic. The study revealed a reduction in mortality and a non-significant trend toward reduction of death and hospital admission for heart failure.",
