This study evaluated 1,323 patients (mean age 63 +/- 13 years, 47% men) who underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography. Abnormal stress echocardiographic results were defined as those with stress-induced ischemia. HRR was defined as [(peak HR - HR at rest)/(220 - age - HR at rest)] x 100, with HRR <70% defined as low. Follow-up data (2.7 +/- 1.1 years) for confirmed myocardial infarction (n = 16) and cardiac death (n = 58) were obtained. HRR risk stratified patients into normal and abnormal subgroups (event rate 1.1%/year vs 4.2%/year, p <0.0001) and further risk stratified patients into normal (adjusted HR 1 [reference] vs 2.88, p = 0.04) and abnormal (adjusted HR 4.17 vs 10.09, p <0.0001) stress echocardiography groups. Low HRR (relative risk [RR] 2.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23 to 4.01, p = 0.013) was an independent predictor of cardiac event even after controlling for standard cardiovascular risk factors, other stress electrocardiographic variables, and stress echocardiographic variables. Low HRR (chi-square 32) was superior to 85% maximum predicted HR (MPHR; chi-square 18) and provided incremental value over stress echocardiography and 85% MPHR (global chi-square increased from 48.3 to 54 to 61.3, p <0.0001) in a model consisting of stress echocardiography, MPHR, and HRR. In conclusion, HRR can further risk stratify patients who undergo dobutamine stress echocardiography and provides independent and incremental prognostic value over standard cardiovascular risk factors and also independent of echocardiographic myocardial ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction and is superior to 85% MPHR. In the setting of low HRR, normal stress echocardiographic results are prognostically less benign, whereas abnormal stress echocardiographic results are prognostically more malignant.",

The goal of this study was to evaluate the compliance of physicians at a large, inner-city teaching hospital with current evidence-based guidelines. A retrospective review of the medical records of 104 patients admitted with CHF was conducted. Quality-of-care indicators were assessed, including the use of echocardiograms, the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers to appropriate patients, and lifestyle and medication counseling at discharge. The assessment of left ventricular (LV) function was documented in 96.1% of patients (n = 100). A total of 65 patients (92.8%) with systolic dysfunction were considered to be ideal candidates for ACE inhibitor therapy. Of these 65 patients, 58 (89.2%) were discharged on ACE inhibitors. Of 41 patients with LV systolic dysfunction who were considered to be ideal candidates for beta-blocker therapy, only 10 (24.4%) were discharged on beta-blocker therapy. Of all patients with CHF, 50% received discharge counseling on medication compliance, 48% received counseling on a low-salt diet, and only 9% were told to monitor daily weight. This study shows that in a major academic teaching hospital, there is a need for improvement in the use of beta-blocker therapy as well as greater emphasis on patient education strategies regarding diet, medication adherence, and monitoring daily weight.",

Incorporation of both monomers in hydrogels was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Morphological analysis by scanning electron microscopy showed spherical shape and porous surface of all prepared samples. The microspheres showed high water affinity at neutral pH values and a narrow dimensional distribution. Network density of hydrogels depends on derivatization degree (DD%) of BSA and/or concentration of modified BSA in the polymerization feed. In order to employ the prepared samples such as pH-sensitive hydrogels, in vitro release studies, in media simulating biological fluids, were performed using diflunisal (DF) and beta-propranolol (PR) as model drugs. Experimental data showed that the release profiles depend on drug-matrix interactions and diffusional limitation awardable to crosslinking degree of microparticles. beta-Propranolol is quickly released at pH 1.0 and a complete release after 1 h at pH 6.8 was observed. In the case of diflunisal pH-sensitive release was observed. At pH 1.0 low amounts of drug were released (w/w<10% after 2 h). When the pH is 6.8, the diflunisal release increased in the amount (w/w>75% after 24 h).",

In this study, we determined whether this impairment persisted over longer time periods by infusing 400 mug.kg(-1).h(-1) Iso by osmotic minipump for 24-144 h (n = 6-7/group). ALC in control rats was 19.0 +/- 2.4 (SD)% of instilled volume absorbed per hour. In Iso-infused rats, ALC was elevated at 24 h (34.9 +/- 2.4%) and decreased at 48 h (15.2 +/- 4.4%) and had recovered to 24 h values at 96 h (37.3 +/- 3.8%) and 144 h (35.2 +/- 3.3%). Plasma Iso concentrations remained elevated at all Iso infusion times. Peripheral lung beta(2)-AR expression exhibited a parallel time course, with a reduction in expression observed at 48 h, followed by an increase to 24 h values at 96 and 144 h. Propranolol prevented the increase in ALC observed at 96 and 144 h, indicating that the recovery in ALC was mediated by a recovery of beta-AR function and beta-AR signaling. ALC at 96 and 144 h could not be further increased by terbutaline, indicating that ALC was maximally stimulated. These data indicate that recovery of beta-AR-stimulated ALC can occur in the continued presence of Iso and is mediated by a recovery of the ability of the distal lung epithelium to respond to beta-AR stimulation.",

    "22": "The aim of this work is to determine generic screening conditions and an initial simple separation strategy allowing the rapid separation of drug enantiomers in polar organic solvent chromatography (POSC). Four cellulose/amylose-based stationary phases were investigated in detail using two mobile phase basis solvents commonly applied in this mode, i.e. acetonitrile and methanol. Polar mode is interesting for use in purification of enantiomers. In a first step, the parameters potentially influencing the separation, such as addition of an alcohol to the polar organic solvent or the type of mobile phase additive(s), were examined by means of experimental designs. Afterwards, the factors found most important are investigated in more detail. Results showed that the cellulose- and amylose-based stationary phases have very broad and complementary enantiorecognition abilities in the POSC mode. The type of organic solvent for the mobile phase appeared to have a dramatic influence on the quality of the separation. Based on the results, a screening strategy was proposed. Enantioseparation was observed in more than 85% of the tested compounds and analysis times of last eluted peak were usually below 10 min.", 
    "23": "The association constant, standard Gibbs energy, enthalpy and entropy for formation of inclusion complexes of propranolol, a beta-blocker, with various natural and modified cyclodextrins have been determined by calorimetry at 298 K. Both natural and methyl-modified alpha-cyclodextrins do not form complexes, while beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins do. Complexing ability of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin depends on the average substitution degree. For gamma-cyclodextrin, hydrophobic interactions play the major role in binding the guest. The association of natural and modified beta-cyclodextrins is ruled by van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding because of the tighter fit of the guest into the cavity. Decreasing pH determines increasingly negative values of the association enthalpies.", 
    "24": "The cardiovascular system is highly organised in time; blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), peripheral resistance, pressure and the release/activity of vasodilating hormones all display pronounced circadian variations. Pathophysiological events within the cardiovascular system are also not random, as shown for instance by sudden cardiac death (SCD), stroke, ventricular arrhythmias (VA), arterial embolism, and symptoms of coronary heart disease (CHD) such as myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemia, angina attacks (AA) in stable angina (stA) or variant angina (varA) or silent ischemia. In hypertensive patients various anti-hypertensive drugs were investigated in crossover studies (morning vs. evening dosing); however consistent data were only obtained for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. Whereas in dippers ACE inhibitors had a super-dipping effect when dosed at night, no consistent difference in BP lowering effect on the 24-hr BP profile was found with calcium channel blockers after morning and evening dosing. In non-dippers the calcium channel blockers isradipine and amlodipine consistently transformed non-dippers into dippers, after evening dosing. Diuretics are also able to normalize a non-dipping behaviour. Moreover, a circadian phase-dependency in pharmacokinetics has been demonstrated for various cardiovascular active drugs such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, oral nitrates and ACE inhibitors, modified by the pharmaceutical formulation. There is evidence that in hypertensive dippers anti-hypertensive drugs should be given in the early morning, whereas in non-dippers it may be necessary to add an evening dose or even to use a single evening dose in order to not only reduce high BP but also to normalize a disturbed non-dipping 24 hr BP profile. In CHD, calcium channel blockers-mainly short acting and non-retarded preparations-seem to be less effective than beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in reducing ischemic events during the night and early morning. However, the role of formulation and/or subclasses of the calcium channel blockers remains to be elucidated. In order to get more insight into the circadian regulation of the cardiovascular system animal models of primary and secondary hypertension have been studied in various strains of normotensive and hypertensive rats and mice. At least in rodents there is ample evidence that the 24-hr rhythms in BP and HR are under the control of biological clock(s) as they persist under constant darkness (i.e. in free-run conditions) with a period deviating from 24 hr; these rhythms are abolished by lesioning of the \"master clock\" located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). In conclusion, chronobiological and chronopharmacological studies are important experimental and clinical approaches to get a better insight into the physiological and pathophysiological regulation of the cardiovascular system including their rhythmic organisation. Circadian time-dependent clinical studies also have implications for drug therapy in hypertension and CHD.",

The recovery was marked by the secondary development of left intraventricular obstruction.

The intraventricular obstruction seemed to occupy a central role in this case, and we discuss the significance of this mechanical phenomenon in the pathophysiology of this syndrome.", 
    "26": "Noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerve terminals is dependent on Ca(2+) entry through neuronal voltage-gated N-type Ca(2+) channels. The accessory beta(3) subunits of Ca(2+) channels (Ca(V)beta(3)) are preferentially associated with the alpha(1B) subunit to form N-type Ca(2+) channels, and are therefore expected to play a functional role in the stimulation-evoked release of noradrenaline. In this study, we employed Ca(V)beta(3)-null, Ca(V)beta(3)-overexpressing (Ca(V)beta(3)-Tg), and wild-type (WT) mice to investigate the possible roles of Ca(V)beta(3) in the sympathetic regulation of heart rate in vivo. Telemetry was used to monitor the ECG and both time and frequency domain analyses were carried out to evaluate heart rate variability. In the frequency domain analysis, power spectral density of the RR interval series was computed using the fast Fourier transform algorithm. The resting heart rate was increased in Ca(V)beta(3)-Tg mice compared with both Ca(V)beta(3)-null and WT mice. Mice overexpressing Ca(V)beta(3) displayed decreased heart rate variability, which was measured by the time domain analysis of the standard deviation of RR intervals. In the frequency domain analysis, Ca(V)beta(3)-Tg mice showed decreased spectral powers compared with WT and Ca(V)beta(3)-null mice. Pharmacological blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors with metoprolol decreased the heart rate in all genotypes, but the extent of the decrease was most obvious in Ca(V)beta(3)-Tg mice. On the other hand, the spectral powers were decreased in response to parasympathetic blockade (atropine) in WT and Ca(V)beta(3)-Tg mice. These results indicate the functional roles of Ca(V)beta(3) in regulating sympathetic nerve signaling.", 
    "27": "Packed-column supercritical fluid chromatography (pSFC) coupled to an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source and a tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS) with minimum sample pretreatment was explored for the rapid and enantioselective determination of (R,S)-propranolol in mouse blood. Serial bleeding of mice is advantageous for the reduction of animal usage, dosing errors, and animal-to-animal variation. The effects of the eluent flow rate and composition as well as the nebulizer temperatures on the ionization efficiency of racemic propranolol and pindolol as model compounds in the positive ion mode under pSFC conditions were studied. The fundamental parameters on the proposed hyphenated system such as matrix ionization suppression and chromatographic performances were investigated in improving sensitivity and enantiomeric separation for the detection of the analytes. The proposed chiral pSFC-APCI/MS/MS approach requiring approximately 3 min/sample for the determination of (R,S)-propranolol at a low nanogram per milliliter region was partially validated with respect to specificity, linearity, reproducibility, and accuracy and was applied to support a pharmacokinetic study.", 
    "28": "Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and clinical heart failure are common complications of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and result in substantially increased mortality and morbidity. Evidence-based cardiovascular protective therapies, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, antiplatelet agents, and lipid-lowering medications, improve outcomes for these patients. However, this population is significantly undertreated with these guideline-recommended agents. Critical pathways have been demonstrated to improve the quality and consistency of treatment; as such, the new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the management of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) recommend that critical pathways be implemented for the management of these patients. The recent Eplerenone Post-acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS) demonstrates that eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, has incremental benefit in decreasing mortality and morbidity when used with standard care therapies in patients post AMI with heart failure and LVSD. The clinical trial evidence coupled with the national guidelines provides a strong rationale for routine incorporation of aldosterone blockade into new or already established critical pathways for AMI complicated by LVSD and heart failure.", 
    "29": "Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to propranolol (P, 0.40 mg/100 g/day) or saline (S) administration (controls) over 14 days. The expression of major differentiation molecules on thymocytes and Thy-1 (CD90) molecules, which are shown to adjust thymocyte sensitivity to TCRalphabeta signaling, was studied. In addition, the sensitivity of thymocytes to induction of apoptosis and concanavalin A (Con A) signaling was estimated. The thymocytes from P-treated (PT) rats exhibited an increased sensitivity to induction of apoptosis, as well as to Con A stimulation. Furthermore, P treatment produced changes in the distribution of thymocyte subsets suggesting that more cells passed positive selection and further differentiated into mature CD4+ or CD8+ single positive (SP) TCRalphabeta(high) cells. These changes may, at least partly, be related to the markedly increased density of Thy-1 surface expression on TCRalphabeta(low) thymocytes from these rats. The increased frequency of cells expressing the CD4+25+ phenotype, which has been shown to be characteristic for regulatory cells in the thymus, may also indicate alterations in thymocyte selection following P treatment. Inasmuch as positive and negative selections play an important role in continuously reshaping the T-cell repertoire and maintaining tolerance, the hereby presented study suggests that pharmacological manipulations with beta-AR signaling, or chemically evoked alterations in catecholamine release, may interfere with the regulation of thymocyte selection, and consequently with the immune response.",

Plasma natriuretic peptides (BNP, NTproBNP, ANP, and NTproANP) were increased by metoprolol (P<0.01 for all). The natriuretic responses to ANP and BNP infusions were sustained with the introduction of metoprolol despite reduced renal perfusion pressure. The levels of the noninfused natriuretic peptide were increased by both ANP and BNP infusions, and this effect was enhanced by metoprolol.

    "36": "The effect of adrenaline on the transmesothelial resistance (RTM) of sheep's visceral and parietal pleura was studied using the Ussing chamber technique. Basal transmesothelial resistance of visceral pleura was found to be 20.71 +/- 0.31 Omega cm2, whereas that of parietal pleura was found to be 19.53 +/- 0.34 Omega cm2. Immediately after the addition of adrenaline (10(-7) M) both apically and basolaterally on the visceral and parietal pleura, these values were significantly increased (P < 0.05). Addition of the nonselective beta-receptor blocker, propranolol (10(-5) M), suppressed this effect in both visceral and parietal pleura, while addition of the nonselective alpha-receptor blocker, phentolamine (10(-5) M), partly suppressed the above-mentioned increase in the parietal pleura. In conclusion, our results show that adrenaline has a rapid effect on both pleurae. This rapid effect is mediated by the stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the case of visceral pleura, while in the case of parietal pleura this effect seems to be due to a stimulation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. On the visceral pleura the effect of adrenaline vanishes after some minutes and on the parietal this effect is more permanent than the visceral's one, suggesting differences in the distribution of the adrenergic receptors between the visceral and parietal pleura.",

Since then, it has been used in more than a dozen controlled trials to examine whether it can reduce the lag to clinical improvement, and/or improve the clinical response in treatment-resistant patients. A recent metaanalysis concluded that pindolol accelerates the antidepressant response but does not increase the effectiveness of SSRIs in unresponsive patients. Several studies have examined the pharmacology of pindolol to clarify the neurobiological basis of its clinical action. Pindolol was initially used due to its ability to block 5-HT1A receptor-mediated responses and to enhance the neurochemical effects of SSRIs. In transfected cells, however, pindolol is a weak (20-25%) partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors and, as such, its actions greatly depend on the system used. In line with this, other reports have also shown that pindolol can reduce serotonergic cell firing when given alone. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan studies have shown that pindolol displays a preferential occupancy of pre- vs. postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, although the overall occupancy is lower than desirable, which suggests that higher doses (e.g., 15 mg/day) may be more effective than the currently used 7.5 mg daily dosage. However, given the complex pharmacology of pindolol, it is hoped that new developments in this field can proceed through the use of a) selective and silent 5-HT1A receptor antagonists in combination with SSRIs, or b) dual action agents (SSRI+5-HT1A receptor blockers).",

However, whether the use of ARBs is helpful for introducing carvedilol (beta-blocker) is unclear when patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure are admitted to the hospital.", 
    "47": "In this retrospective study, 27 patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure were given carvedilol upon admission. Five patients received carvedilol monotherapy (group A), and 22 were treated with a combination of carvedilol and ARBs (group B).",

In addition, there were no significant differences in the decrease in plasma brain natriuretic peptide, or the improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction upon carvedilol treatment between the groups. Although there was no significant difference in the maintenance dose of carvedilol between the groups, the gross dose of carvedilol in group B was significantly lower than that in group A. In addition, the improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction in group B was positively correlated with the maintenance dose of carvedilol in patients who had wild-type beta1-adrenergic receptor at amino acid 389 (arginine/arginine genotype).",

    "50": "Nebivolol, a selective beta-adrenoceptor (beta1-AR) antagonist, induces vasodilatation by an endothelium- and NO-cGMP-dependent pathway. However, the mechanisms involved in the vascular effect of nebivolol have not been established. Thus, we evaluated the role of alpha1 and beta3-ARs in nebivolol-induced vasodilatation. The responses to nebivolol were investigated in vitro in thoracic aortic rings isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats. Nebivolol (0.1-10 microM) significantly shifted the concentration-response curve to phenylephrine, an alpha1-AR agonist, to the right in a concentration-dependent manner (pA2 = 6.5). Conversely, the concentration-response curve to endothelin 1 (ET1) was unaffected by nebivolol. In ET1-precontracted rings, nebivolol induced a concentration-dependent relaxation, which was unaffected by nadolol (a beta1/beta2-AR antagonist) but was significantly reduced by L-748,337 (a beta3-AR antagonist), endothelium removal or pretreatment with L-NMMA (an NOS inhibitor). Similar results were obtained with a beta3-AR agonist, SR 58611A. It was concluded that, in rat aorta, nebivolol-induced relaxation results from both inhibition of alpha1-ARs and activation of beta3-ARs. In addition, we confirmed that the endothelium and the NO pathway are involved in the vascular effect of nebivolol. The identification of these vascular targets of nebivolol indicate that it has therapeutic potential for the treatment of pathological conditions associated with an elevation of sympathetic tone, such as heart failure and hypertension.", 
    "51": "In rat ventricular cardiomyocytes beta2-adrenoceptors (AR) couple to Gs- and Gi-protein, and evidence has accumulated that beta2-AR agonists can differentially activate either Gs- or Gs- and Gi-protein. In this study, in isolated adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes, we assessed the effects of pertussis toxin (PTX) on beta2-AR agonist (terbutaline (TER), salbutamol (SAL) and fenoterol (FEN)) evoked inhibition of phenylephrine (PE)-induced increase in the rate of protein synthesis (assessed as [3H]phenylalanine incorporation) to find out which beta2-AR agonist activates selectively Gs- or Gs- and Gi-protein. PE (1 microM) increased the rate of protein synthesis from 100% to 130+/-2% (n = 34). FEN, TER and SAL (1 nM-10 microM) inhibited PE-induced increase in the rate of protein synthesis concentration-dependently. FEN inhibited PE effects almost completely (from 132+/-3 to 101+/-1%), whereas TER and SAL caused only partial inhibition (from 131+/-2 to 114+/-2 and 129+/-1 to 111+/-2%, respectively). Pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with PTX (250 ng ml(-1) for 16 h at 37 degrees C) did not affect FEN effects, but converted TER- and SAL-evoked partial inhibition into complete inhibition. Inhibitory effects of the three beta2-AR agonists were markedly attenuated by beta1-AR selective antagonist CGP 20712A (CGP) (300 nM); in contrast, beta2-AR selective antagonist ICI 118,551 (55 nM) inhibited the inhibitory effects of the three beta2-AR agonists only in PTX-pretreated cardiomyocytes,with beta1-AR blocked by CGP. We conclude that, in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes, FEN activates selectively the Gs protein-pathway, while TER and SAL activate the Gs- and Gi-protein pathways. Part of the effects of these three beta2-AR agonists appears to be mediated by beta1-AR.", 
    "52": "The beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, elicits vasodilation and tachycardia in anesthetized rats via activation of propranolol-sensitive beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors and also by propranolol-insensitive beta1- and beta3-adrenoceptors. The aim of this study was to determine whether the relative contribution of propranolol-sensitive and -insensitive beta-adrenoceptors to the changes in heart rate (HR) and vascular resistances elicited by isoprenaline is altered after blockade of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. The hemodynamic responses elicited by isoprenaline (0.1 and 0.5 microg kg(-1), i.v.) were determined before and after injection of saline or the NO synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME, 50 micromol kg(-1), i.v.), and again after injection of the beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (1 mg kg(-1), i.v.). The responses elicited by the above doses of isoprenaline were also determined before and during infusion of the alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine (3 microg kg(-1) min(-1), i.v.), and again 15-20 min after injection of propranolol (1.0 mg kg(-1), i.v.). Both doses of isoprenaline elicited tachycardia and reductions in vascular resistances. Propranolol eliminated the responses elicited by the lower dose of isoprenaline and substantially diminished the responses elicited by the higher dose of the beta1-, beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptor agonist. The maximal vasodilator responses elicited by both doses of isoprenaline were not diminished whereas the maximal increases in HR were higher after injection of L-NAME. The ability of propranolol to diminish the hemodynamic actions of isoprenaline was substantially diminished in L-NAME-treated rats, whereas propranolol retained its potency in rats that received an equi-pressor infusion of the alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine. The finding that the maximal vasodilator responses elicited by isoprenaline were not diminished by L-NAME suggests that the vasodilation elicited by this drug was due to direct activation of beta-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle and that the full compliment of isoprenaline-sensitive receptors was not changed after inhibition of NO synthesis. However, these results suggest that the activities of propranolol-sensitive beta-adrenoceptors are downregulated, whereas propranolol-insensitive beta-adrenoceptors are upregulated upon the loss of exposure to endothelial nitrosyl factors.",

This swelling polymer incorporation layer system, referred to as SPILA system, consists of core granules coated with a mixture of CP, water insoluble polymer, and water-soluble polymer (WP). Release profiles of metoprolol tartrate (ME) from SPILA system were pH dependent: drug release was slower in the medium of pH 1.2 than in the medium of pH 6.8 due to a coating layer with pH-dependent swelling polymer, CP. Lower C(max), longer T(max), longer MRT and higher AUC values were obtained following administration of SR granules based on SPILA system to beagle dogs compared with pH-independent SR granules having a coating layer without CP, while both SR granules provided similar in vitro release profiles. Moreover, using morphine hydrochloride (MO), in vitro and in vivo performances of the SPILA system were investigated. pH-dependency on the release profiles of MO from SPILA system was more evident when the amount of CP incorporated in SPILA system was increased. AUC and MRT values following administration of SR granules of MO with a coating layer containing 8% of CP to beagle dogs were 191 ng h/mL and 10.6 h respectively, while those following SR granules of MO with a coating layer containing 1% of CP to beagle dogs were 86.4 ng h/mL and 5.86 h, respectively. An important role of CP in the release-regulating layer of SPILA system for keeping the higher and more extended plasma levels of morphine free base was confirmed from the in vivo performance of SPILA system.", 
    "59": "Veins play an important role in the control of venous return, cardiac output and cardiovascular homeostasis. However, the central nervous system sites and effector systems involved in modulating venous function remain to be fully elucidated. The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is an important site modulating autonomic outflow to the cardiovascular system. Venous tone can be modulated by sympathetic nerves or by adrenal catecholamines. The present study assessed the relative contribution of these autonomic effector systems to the venoconstrictor response elicited by stimulation of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sham operation or bilateral adrenal demedullation fitted with PVN guide cannulae and fitted with catheters for recording arterial pressure (AP) and intrathoracic vena caval pressure (VP). A latex balloon was advanced into the right atrium. MCFP was calculated from the AP and VP recorded after 4 s of right atrial occlusion. MCFP = VP + (AP - VP)/60. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), VP and MCFP responses to injections of BMI (25 ng/side) into the PVN were recorded from conscious rats to avoid the complicating effects of anesthesia. In sham-operated rats, injection of BMI into the PVN increased MAP by 13 +/- 3 mm Hg and HR by 56 +/- 6 bpm. MCFP was also increased significantly by 0.98 +/- 0.15 mm Hg indicating an increase in venomotor tone. Adrenal medullectomy did not affect the pressor (DeltaMAP = 12 +/- 2 mm Hg), tachycardic (DeltaHR = 48 +/- 7 bpm) or venoconstrictor (DeltaMCFP = 0.73 +/- 0.11 mm Hg) responses. Ganglionic blockade abolished the PVN-induced responses in both groups of rats. In a separate group, pretreatment with the adrenergic neuron blocker, guanethidine (20 mg/kg), also abolished the PVN-mediated venoconstrictor responses. Conversely, selective beta2 adrenergic receptor blockade did not affect MCFP responses to BMI. These data indicate that adrenomedullary catecholamines are not necessary for full expression of the venoconstrictor response to PVN stimulation.", 
    "60": "The purpose of this study was to propose a new method to predict in vivo drug-drug interactions (DDIs) for a high clearance drug from in vitro data. As the high clearance drug, NE-100 (N, N-dipropyl-2-[4-methoxy-3-(2-phenylethoxy)phenyl]ethylamine monohydrochloride) was used. First, approach based on I(u)/K(i) value was used for the prediction of DDIs between NE-100 and concomitant drugs. When the K(i) values (K(i-cal)) obtained from the microtiter plate (MTP) assay and the reported K(i) values (K(i-rep)) for these drugs were used to predict increases at levels of NE-100 AUC(oral) (AUC(oral) ratio), the AUC(oral) ratios from the I(u)/K(i-cal) correlated with those from the I(u)/K(i-rep). This result suggests that the K(i-cal) from the MTP assay can be used for prediction of DDIs instead of the K(i-rep) value. Second, a new approach combining the inhibition rate (R) calculated from the MTP assay and two physiological models was used to predict DDIs. When the AUC(oral) ratios of NE-100 by various drugs were predicted using the R value and the well-stirred model, the ratios were similar to those predicted using the I(u)/K(i). However, after co-administration of drugs such as quinidine, propafenone and thioridazine (potent inhibitors of CYP2D6), the NE-100 AUC(oral) ratios predicted from the dispersion model was much greater than those from well-stirred model. This result shows that application of the dispersion model to the prediction method using the R value might sensitively and precisely predict the increased levels of AUC(oral) by DDIs for high clearance drug, compared with the prediction method using I(u)/K(i) value.", 
    "61": "There is little doubt that diabetes is more common in hypertensive than normotensive individuals. There are also some data suggesting that the use of certain antihypertensive agents, i.e., diuretics and more specifically some beta blockers will increase the occurrence of new onset diabetes (NOD) when compared to other medications, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. The clinical significance of this 1%-3.5% difference, however, has not been established. Different studies report different outcomes. In large outcome trials the occurrence of NOD did not effect mortality or morbidity outcomes. Although one study reported that NOD had the same prognosis as pretreatment diabetes, another did not. At present, data are insufficient to suggest that NOD is of important clinical significance or that present treatment recommendations, especially regarding the use of diuretics, should be changed.", 
    "62": "Some questions about new-onset diabetes (NOD) must still be completely addressed: 1) its incidence; 2) the possible association between NOD and some classes of antihypertensive drugs; and 3) its prognostic impact. It is well known that diuretics and beta blockers can increase plasma glucose and, in available hypertension trials, diuretics and beta blockers caused a higher incidence of NOD than new antihypertensive drugs. NOD heralds a high risk of major cardiovascular events, but the absolute difference between old and new drugs was too small to significantly drive the differences in cardiovascular event rates between the two groups of treatment. This evidence suggests a judicious use of drugs more frequently associated with NOD in subjects at high risk of diabetes (impaired fasting glucose, overweight, family history of diabetes, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels). The lowest effective dose of these drugs should be used, plasma glucose should be checked periodically, and concomitant lifestyle measures to prevent diabetes should be implemented with resolution.",

Endothelium removal and the inhibition of NO synthase with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG) caused pronounced inhibition of sildenafil elicited relaxations but not of SNAP induced responses. Combined treatment with the cyclooxygenase blocker indomethacin and L-NOARG caused significantly greater inhibition of sildenafil relaxations than that produced by L-NOARG alone. Inhibitors of the cGMP (PKG) and the cAMP (cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate) dependent protein kinases Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS (beta-phenyl-1, N2-etheno-8-bromoguanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer) and Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS (Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS (8-(4-chlorophenylthio) adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer), respectively, inhibited the sildenafil concentration-relaxation curves.

As David Cutler and Mark McClellan did in earlier work, we find that overall gains in post-AMI survival more than justified the increases in costs during this period. Since 1996, however, survival gains have stagnated, while spending has continued to increase. We also consider changes in spending and outcomes at the regional level. Regions experiencing the largest spending gains were not those realizing the greatest improvements in survival. Factors yielding the greatest benefits to health were not the factors that drove up costs, and vice versa.", 
    "104": "The influence of the proportion of acrylamidomethyl-gamma-cyclodextrin (gamma-CD-NMA) on loading and release of the hydrophobic triamcinolone acetonide (TA) and the hydrophilic propranolol (PR) by acrylic acid hydrogels was evaluated. gamma-CD-NMA was synthesized by condensation of gamma-cyclodextrin (gamma-CD) with N-(hydroxymethyl) acrylamide. Hydrogels were prepared with gamma-CD-NMA and sodium acrylate (3 M or 4 M), using N,N'-methylen(bisacrylamide) (BIS) as cross-linker, by free radical polymerization into glass moulds of 2 mm wide and were cut as discs (10 mm diameter). gamma-CD-NMA did not modify the pH-dependent swelling of the hydrogels, but significantly increased the swelling degree in the 40:60 ethanol:water, medium in which TA can be dissolved. Hydrogels prepared with gamma-CD-NMA above 5% (w/w of total monomers) showed a remarkably higher capacity to load TA, e.g., 33 mg/g dry hydrogel versus 0.6 mg/g dry hydrogel without gamma-CD-NMA. This is explained by the formation of 1:1 inclusion complexes of TA with gamma-CD mers that overcomes the lack of interactions with the acrylic groups of the network. The release of TA in water, 0.1 N HCl, or pH 6.8 phosphate buffer was sustained for at least 24 h, whatever the pH and the composition of the medium used. In contrast, loading of PR from the water solutions was greater for hydrogels prepared with 3 M acrylate than with 4 M acrylate, irrespective to their content in gamma-CD-NMA, and in less than 2 h ca. 80% PR was released. The lower affinity of PR for the gamma-CD cavities, compared to the strong intensity of the electrostatic interactions with the acrylic acid groups, explains why the incorporation of gamma-CD-NMA did not increased the loading and control release capacity of the hydrogels of this hydrophilic drug. In summary, the copolymerisation of CD with acrylic monomers can provide highly hydrophilic pH-sensitive networks which load large amounts of hydrophobic drugs and release them in a sustained way.",

We evaluated the effect of optimized medical and revascularization therapy on the incidence of SCD after an AMI. A total of 2,130 consecutive patients (mean age 59 +/- 10 years) with an AMI from 2 European centers (Germany and Finland) was included in the study. In this population, 1,004 patients (47%) were treated with an optimized medical and revascularization strategy (defined as treatment with revascularization, beta blockers, aspirin, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). Nonoptimized treatment, defined as a lack of any optimized treatment, was received by 1,126 patients (53%). During the mean follow-up of 2.9 +/- 1.3 years, the incidence of SCD was very low among patients who received optimized treatment (1.2%, annual incidence 0.4%) compared with those who did not (3.6%, annual incidence 1.4%, p <0.01). The treatment strategy that had the greatest effect on differences in the SCD rate was revascularization therapy, with the hazard ratio of SCD being 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.7, p <0.01) for SCD among nonrevascularized patients. Nonoptimized treatment was more often received by older patients, women, diabetic patients, and those with depressed left ventricular function.

This study assessed the additional diagnostic value of new or worsening wall motion abnormalities during recovery after acute administration of beta blockers. The study population consisted of 200 patients (mean 59 +/- 11 years of age, 144 men), who underwent DSE. Images were acquired at rest, low dose, peak dose, and during recovery. Patients received intravenous metoprolol (1 to 5 mg/min). The dose was adjusted to achieve a recovery heart rate within a 10% range of heart rate at rest. Coronary angiography was performed within 2 months. Inducible new wall motion abnormalities were observed in 168 patients (84%) at peak stress. An additional 14 patients (7%) developed new or worsening wall motion abnormalities during recovery. CAD was detected in 182 patients (86 had single-vessel CAD). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of DSE were 88%, 65%, and 73% at peak stress and 97%, 65%, and 74% during recovery. Sensitivity was particularly higher during recovery than during peak stress in patients with single-vessel CAD (98% vs 81%, p <0.001).

The arterial blood pressure (BP) and the heart rate (HR) in response to Ea stimulations at the Tsusanli point (St-36) and the Hoku point (Li-4) were tested by a low frequency Ea (2 Hz; LFEa) and a high frequency Ea (20 Hz; HFEa) with stimulation intensities 20 times the motor threshold. Neither the HR nor the BP was affected when the Tsusanli point was stimulated. Whereas, Ea stimulations at the Hoku point elicit chronotropic and pressor effects. The patterns of pressor responses caused by the LFEa were different from that of an HFEa, i.e., the LFEa elicited a tonic effect, while an HFEa had a phasic one. The HFEa-induced pressor and chronotropic effects were attenuated, while the LFEa induced effects were completely blocked by an intravenous infusion of an alpha-adrenergic blocker (moxisylyte 0.2 mg/min/kg, i.v., for 20 min). A co-infusion with alpha-and beta-adrenergic blockers (propanolol 0.2 mg/min/kg, i.v., for 20 min) completely blocked the HFEa-induced pressor and chronotropic effects. We concluded that Ea stimulations, at the Hoku acupoint, with appropriate stimulation parameters can increase and maintain BP. Furthermore, the LFEa stimulation activates sympathetic vasomotor tone, whereas the HFEa stimulation causes an additional potentiation on the sympathetic drive to the heart.",

    "128": "Evidence from previous studies indicates that the noradrenergic and GABAergic influences within the basolateral amygdala (BLA) modulate the consolidation of memory for fear conditioning. The present experiments investigated whether the same modulatory influences are involved in regulating the extinction of fear-based learning. To investigate this issue, male Sprague Dawley rats implanted with unilateral or bilateral cannula aimed at the BLA were trained on a contextual fear conditioning (CFC) task and 24 and 48 h later were given extinction training. Immediately following each extinction session they received intra-BLA infusions of the GABAergic antagonist bicuculline (50 ng), the beta-adrenocepter antagonist propranolol (500 ng), bicuculline with propranolol, norepinephrine (NE) (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 microg), the GABAergic agonist muscimol (125 ng), NE with muscimol or a control solution. To investigate the involvement of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) as a possible target of BLA activation during extinction, other animals were given infusions of muscimol (500 ng) via an ipsilateral cannula implanted in the DH. Bilateral BLA infusions of bicuculline significantly enhanced extinction, as did infusions into the right, but not left BLA. Propranolol infused into the right BLA together with bicuculline blocked the bicuculline-induced memory enhancement. Norepinephrine infused into the right BLA also enhanced extinction, and this effect was not blocked by co-infusions of muscimol. Additionally, muscimol infused into the DH did not attenuate the memory enhancing effects of norepinephrine infused into the BLA. These findings provide evidence that, as with original CFC learning, noradrenergic activation within the BLA modulates the consolidation of CFC extinction. The findings also suggest that the BLA influence on extinction is not mediated by an interaction with the dorsal hippocampus.", 
    "129": "When animals learn hippocampus-dependent associative and spatial tasks such as trace eyeblink conditioning and the water maze, CA1 hippocampal neurons become more excitable as a result of reductions in the post-burst, slow afterhyperpolarization. The calcium-activated potassium current that mediates this afterhyperpolarization is activated by the calcium influx that occurs when a series of action potentials fire and serves as a modulator of neuronal firing frequency. As a result, spike frequency accommodation is also reduced after learning. Neuronal calcium buffering processes change and/or voltage-dependent calcium currents increase during aging; leading to enhancements in the slow afterhyperpolarization, increased spike frequency accommodation and age-associated impairments in learning. We describe a series of studies done to characterize this learning-specific enhancement in intrinsic neuronal excitability and its converse in aging brain. We have also combined behavioral pharmacology and biophysics in experiments demonstrating that compounds that increase neuronal excitability in CA1 pyramidal neurons also enhance learning rate of hippocampus-dependent tasks, especially in aging animals. The studies reviewed here include those using nimodipine, an L-type calcium current blocker that tends to cross the blood-brain barrier; metrifonate, a cholinesterase inhibitor; CI1017, a muscarinic cholinergic agonist; and galantamine, a combined cholinesterase inhibitor and nicotinic agonist. Since aging is the chief risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, a disease that targets the hippocampus and associated brain regions and markedly impairs hippocampus-dependent learning, these compounds have potential use as treatments for this disease. Galantamine has been approved by the USDA for this purpose. Finally, we have extended our studies to the TG2576 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), that overproduces amyloid precursor protein (APP) and increases levels of toxic beta-amyloid in the brain. Not only do these mice show deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning as they age, but their hippocampal neurons show a reduced capacity to increase their levels of intrinsic excitability with reductions in the slow afterhyperpolarization after application of the muscarinic agonist carbachol. These TG2576 APP overproducing mice were crossed with BACE1 knockout mice, that do not produce beta-amyloid because cleavage of APP by the beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a critical step in its formation. Not only was hippocampus-dependent learning rescued in the bigenic TG2576-BACE1 mice, but the capacity of hippocampal neurons to show normal enhancements of intrinsic excitability was restored. The series of studies reviewed here support our hypothesis that enhancement in intrinsic excitability by reductions in calcium-activated potassium currents in hippocampal neurons is an important cellular mechanism for hippocampus-dependent learning.",

Confluent bovine ECs were loaded with iron dextran (15 muM) for 24 h and then exposed to dihydroxyfumarate (DHF), a source of reactive oxygen species, for up to 2 h. Intracellular oxidant formation, monitored by fluorescence of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin (DCF; 30 microM), increased and peaked at 30 min; total glutathione decreased by 52 +/- 5% (p < 0.01) at 60 min. When the ECs were pretreated 30 min before iron loading with 1.25 to 10 microM d-propranolol, glutathione losses were attenuated 15 to 80%, with EC(50) = 3.1 microM. d-Propranolol partially inhibited the DCF intensity increase, but atenolol up to 10 microM was ineffective. At 2 h, caspase 3 activity was elevated 3.2 +/- 0.3-fold (p < 0.01) in the iron-loaded and DHF-treated ECs, and cell survival, determined 24 h later, decreased 47 +/- 6% (p < 0.01).

In separate experiments, 24-h iron loading resulted in a 3.6 +/- 0.8-fold increase in total EC iron determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy; d-propranolol at 5 microM reduced this increase to 1.5 +/- 0.4-fold (p < 0.01) of controls. Microscopic observation by Perls' staining revealed that the excessive iron accumulated in vesicular endosomal/lysosomal structures, which were substantially diminished by d-propranolol.

    "144": "Airway hyperresponsiveness is a cardinal feature of asthma. Lung C-fiber activation induces central and local defense reflexes that may contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness. Initial studies show that substance P (SP) activates C fibers even though it is produced and released by these same C fibers. SP may induce release of other endogenous mediators. Bradykinin (BK) is an endogenous mediator that activates C fibers. The hypothesis was tested that SP activates C fibers via BK release. Guinea pigs were anesthetized, and C-fiber activity (FA), pulmonary insufflation pressure (PIP), heart rate, and arterial blood pressure were monitored before and after intravenous injection of capsaicin (Cap), SP, and BK. Identical agonist challenges were repeated after infusion of an antagonist cocktail of des-Arg9-[Leu8]-BK (10(-3) M, B1 antagonist), and HOE-140 (10(-4) M, B2 antagonist). After antagonist administration, BK increased neither PIP nor FA. Increases in neither PIP nor FA were attenuated after Cap or SP challenge. In a second series of experiments, Cap and SP were injected before and after infusion of indomethacin (1 mg/kg iv) to determine whether either agent activates C fibers through release of arachidonic acid metabolites. Indomethacin administration decreased the effect of SP challenge on FA but not PIP. The effect of Cap on FA or PIP was not altered by indomethacin. In subsequent experiments, C fibers were activated by prostaglandin E2 and F2alpha. Therefore, exogenously applied SP stimulates an indomethacin-sensitive pathway leading to C-fiber activation.", 
    "145": "In the brain the extracellular concentration of glutamate is controlled by glial transporters that restrict the neurotransmitter action to synaptic sites and avoid excitotoxicity. Impaired transport of glutamate occurs in many cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a devastating motoneuron disease. Motoneurons of the brainstem nucleus hypoglossus are among the most vulnerable, giving early symptoms like slurred speech and dysphagia. However, the direct consequences of extracellular glutamate build-up, due to uptake block, on synaptic transmission and survival of hypoglossal motoneurons remain unclear and have been studied using the neonatal rat brainstem slice preparation as a model. Patch clamp recording from hypoglossal motoneurons showed that, in about one-third of these cells, inhibition of glutamate transport with the selective blocker dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA; 50 mum) unexpectedly led to the emergence of rhythmic bursting consisting of inward currents of long duration with superimposed fast oscillations and synaptic events. Synaptic inhibition block facilitated bursting. Bursts had a reversal potential near 0 mV, and were blocked by tetrodotoxin, the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone, or antagonists of AMPA, NMDA or mGluR1 glutamate receptors. Intracellular Ca(2+) imaging showed bursts as synchronous discharges among motoneurons. Synergy of activation of distinct classes of glutamate receptor plus gap junctions were therefore essential for bursting. Ablating the lateral reticular formation preserved bursting, suggesting independence from propagated network activity within the brainstem. TBOA significantly increased the number of dead motoneurons, an effect prevented by the same agents that suppressed bursting. Bursting thus represents a novel hallmark of motoneuron dysfunction triggered by glutamate uptake block.", 
    "146": "The present study examines possible mechanisms by which the flavonoid isokaempferide (IKPF; 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3-methoxyflavone) from Amburana cearensis, a Brazilian medicinal plant popularly used as bronchodilator, induces relaxation of guinea-pig isolated trachea. In the trachea (with intact epithelium) contracted by carbachol, IKPF (1-1000 microM) caused a graded relaxation, and the epithelium removal increased the sensitivity of the airway smooth muscle to IKPF (EC50, in intact tissue: 77.4 [54.8-109.2] microM; in denuded epithelium: 15.0 [11.3-20.1] microM). The IKPF-induced relaxation was inhibited in 41% by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NAME (100 microM); in 31% and 50% by the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitor ODQ (3 and 33 microM); by propranolol (31%) and also by capsaicin (37%). In the trachea pre-contracted by 40 mM KCl the pre-incubation with glibenclamide (33 microM) or iberiotoxin (IbTX, 0.1 microM), selective K(+) channel inhibitors, inhibited the IKPF-induced relaxation by 39% and 38%, respectively. On the other hand, 4-aminopyridine (100 microM), a nonselective K(+) channel antagonist, did not significantly influence the effect of IKPF, while IbTX induced a rightward displacement of the IKPF concentration-response curve. However, in muscle pre-contracted with 120 mM KCl the relaxant effect of IKPF was significantly reduced and not affected by glibenclamide. In conclusion, these results indicate a direct and epithelium-independent relaxant effect of IKPF on smooth muscle fibers. Although this IKPF relaxant action seems to be multi-mediated, it occurs via both Ca(2+) and ATP-sensitive K(+) channels, but some other possible mechanisms unrelated to K(+) channels cannot be excluded.",

In this work, we compared a confocal and a non-confocal cellular HCS system, the IN Cell Analyzers(1) 3,000 and 1,000, respectively. As a cellular model system we used the Transfluor technology in the 384-well microtiter plate (MTP) format. The Transfluor HCS assay for G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activation is based on the recruitment of a green fluorescent protein-labelled arrestin (ArrGFP) from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. We investigated two GPCRs, the wild-type (wt) beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) and the beta2AR-enhanced (E), a C-terminally mutated receptor with a higher affinity to arrestin. Upon agonist stimulation, the beta2AR-wt induced the redistribution of ArrGFP to coated pits, the beta2AR-E maintained the interaction with ArrGFP down to the formation of endocytic vesicles. Our findings reveal that the assay is feasible on both instruments, with sufficiently robust Z' statistics. Improved Z' statistics, though, are achieved with the confocal system, particularly in case of weak signals. Moreover, throughput is dramatically higher for the IN Cell Analyzer 3,000. We conclude that, depending on the needs for throughput and assay biology, either instrument may fulfil a successful role in the drug discovery process. Confocal optics, however, provide a better basis for the detection of smaller subcellular structures with lower fluorescence intensity.",

    "162": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like paroxetine (Prx) often requires 4-6 weeks to achieve clinical benefits in depressed patients. Pindolol shortens this delay and it has been suggested that this effect is mediated by somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 1A autoreceptors. However clinical data on the beneficial effects of pindolol are conflicting. To study the effects of (+/-)-pindolol-paroxetine administration, we used genetical and pharmacological approaches in 5-HT1A knockout mice (5-HT1A-/-). Two assays, in vivo intracerebral microdialysis in awake mice and the forced swimming test (FST), were used to assess the antidepressant-like effects of this drug combination. Basal levels of extracellular serotonin, 5-HT ([5-HT]ext) in the frontal cortex (FCX) and the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) did not differ between the two strains of mice, suggesting a lack of tonic control of 5-HT1A autoreceptors on nerve terminal 5-HT release. Prx (1 and 4 mg/kg) dose-dependently increased cortical [5-HT]ext in both genotypes, but the effects were greater in mutants. The selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY-100635 (0.5 mg/kg), or (+/-)-pindolol (5 and 10 mg/kg) potentiated the effects of Prx (4 mg/kg) on cortical [5-HT]ext in 5-HT1A+/+, but not in 5-HT1A-/- mice. Similar responses were obtained following local intra-raphe perfusion by reverse microdialysis of either WAY-100635 or (+/-)-pindolol (100 microM each). In the FST, Prx administration dose-dependently decreased the immobility time in both strains of mice, but the response was much greater in 5HT1A-/- mice. In contrast, (+/-)-pindolol blocked Prx-induced decreases in the immobility time while WAY-100635 had no effect in both genotypes. These findings using 5-HT1A-/- mice confirm that (+/-)-pindolol behaves as an antagonist of 5-HT1A autoreceptor in mice, but its blockade of paroxetine-induced antidepressant-like effects in the FST may be due to its binding to other neurotransmitter receptors.", 
    "163": "Pathophysiologic hypotheses for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are centered on the role of the amyloid plaque Abeta peptide and the mechanism of its derivation from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). As part of the disease process, an aberrant axonal sprouting response is known to occur near Abeta deposits. A Nogo to Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) pathway contributes to determining the ability of adult CNS axons to extend after traumatic injuries. Here, we consider the potential role of NgR mechanisms in AD. Both Nogo and NgR are mislocalized in AD brain samples. APP physically associates with the NgR. Overexpression of NgR decreases Abeta production in neuroblastoma culture, and targeted disruption of NgR expression increases transgenic mouse brain Abeta levels, Abeta plaque deposition, and dystrophic neurites. Infusion of a soluble NgR fragment reduces Abeta levels, amyloid plaque deposits, and dystrophic neurites in a mouse transgenic AD model. Changes in NgR level produce parallel changes in secreted APPalpha and Abeta, implicating NgR as a blocker of secretase processing of APP. The NgR provides a novel site for modifying the course of AD and highlights the role of axonal dysfunction in the disease.",

We evaluated the ability of RE to be more sensitive than State Entropy (SE) in measuring nociception in patients undergoing gynaecological laparoscopy.

This agent has shown pharmacodynamic effects beyond those responsible for lowering blood pressure (BP), including the improvement of endothelial function and the normalisation of vascular and cardiac structure and function. Perindopril has a well established role in the treatment of patients with hypertension or heart failure. In the EUROPA trial, once-daily perindopril 8 mg prevented cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) without any apparent heart failure receiving standard recommended therapy. In the ASCOT-BPLA trial, a calcium channel antagonist +/- perindopril regimen demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits compared with a conventional beta-blocker +/- diuretic regimen in patients with hypertension who were at risk of developing cardiovascular events. These trials demonstrate that while perindopril, in addition to standard recommended therapy, has a potential role in preventing cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients, its role in the management of patients with stable CAD is clearly established.", 
    "169": "Patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) are at increased risk for dying suddenly of cardiac causes. The most common causes of LVD are coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI). Aggressive intervention following MI is essential for minimizing the myocardial damage that leads to LVD and the subsequent risk for heart failure and sudden cardiac death. This article describes practical algorithms for managing the patient post MI to minimize such risks. The degree of LVD is a key factor for determining clinical management strategies in the patient post MI. Risk factor reduction and selective neurohormonal blockade, especially with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are usually recommended in the presence or absence of LVD, along with early use of a beta blocker. In patients with LVD, more aggressive intervention includes extended use of a beta blocker. In cases of LVD progressed to heart failure, the mixed beta and alpha blocker carvedilol has improved outcomes significantly. In clinical trials, carvedilol has been demonstrated to have antiarrhythmic activity, a property that offers protection against sudden arrhythmic death in high-risk patients with LVD. Addition of an aldosterone antagonist is also advised in patients with heart failure. In selected patients with reduced ejection fractions, use of surgical/catheter treatment and device therapy offers further benefits.", 
    "170": "The pharmacologic management of the patient post myocardial infarction (MI) aims to achieve several goals. Chief among these is to prevent subsequent events, which include death, reinfarction, and rehospitalization. Secondary goals include preventing arrhythmias, minimizing left ventricular (LV) remodeling, and preventing progression to heart failure. This review describes practical algorithms for use in the pharmacologic management of the patient post MI based on American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines. The intensity of drug treatment is determined guided by the degree of LV dysfunction and the presence or absence of ischemia and arrhythmic risk markers. All patients post MI require an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and antiplatelet therapy, usually with aspirin. In individuals who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is an adequate substitute. Numerous studies document the efficacy of ACE inhibitors, which decrease mortality and the risk of heart failure and stroke. Aldosterone blockade is recommended long-term for patients post MI with an LV ejection fraction < or = 40% and either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes. Use of a beta blocker is an important addition to most post-MI drug regimens. Beta blockers decrease mortality and are especially effective in patients with impaired LV function. Among the beta blockers, carvedilol, which also has alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking activity, was found to decrease mortality significantly in patients with low ejection fractions and heart failure. Another drug therapy of value in post-MI treatment is use of calcium-channel blockers. These are restricted to patients with conserved LV function in whom congestion is absent and in whom beta blockers are contraindicated. Current guidelines also recommend that patients post MI with elevated cholesterol levels should be prescribed lipid therapy with a statin at hospital discharge.", 
    "171": "Current guidelines define the standard of care for patients after myocardial infarction (MI), with particular focus on patients with significant ventricular dysfunction. Inherent in these recommendations are assumptions about the relative risks and benefits, as well as the costs, of the available options. This review will consider strategies to prevent sudden death and heart failure post-MI by utilization of pharmacologic therapies--angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), aldosterone antagonists, statins, and beta-blockers--in parallel with the approaches reviewed elsewhere in this supplement. A patient-centric approach necessitates that drugs in each class be compared for efficacy within this patient population. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of several drugs, such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, in patients post-MI, yet these benefits do not seem to be reflected in the epidemiologic data. This may reflect underutilization of these therapies or, alternatively, support the notion that efficacy in clinical trials does not assure effectiveness in clinical practice. The latter point is a subject of ongoing investigation, while the former is being addressed through quality-of-care initiatives. In clinical practice, aggressiveness is key, starting with patient education. If patients understand their risks better, compliance and adoption of a more ideal lifestyle seem more likely. However, even with educational programs, human nature teaches us that marked change in behavior is difficult and therefore, to minimize risks, particularly of sudden death and heart failure post infarction, an optimized pharmacologic regimen serves as a powerful tool.",
