    "1": "The effect of intravenous acebutolol on supraventricular arrhythmias was evaluated in 20 patients, 5 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation was slowed greater than 15% in all of 10 patients by acebutolol and in none of 5 patients by saline. A rapid ventricular rate in atrial flutter was slowed greater than 15% in all of 6 patients by acebutolol and in none of 3 patients by saline. Frequent premature atrial beats were abolished or reduced by greater than 75% in each of 2 patients by acebutolol and not in a patient by saline. Acebutolol converted multifocal atrial tachycardia to sinus rhythm in a patient. Digitalis-induced nonparoxysmal atrioventricular junctional tachycardia was not affected by saline but was abolished by acebutolol in a patient. Acebutolol was well tolerated in each of 5 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Acebutolol is useful in the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "2": "5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP), the immediate precursor of serotonin, induces a release of insulin and glucagon in the intact rat. These effects of 5HTP, which have previously been shown to be blocked by L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibition, were also prevented by methysergide (a serotonin receptor antagonist). Quipazine (a serotonin receptor agonist) did not alter pancreatic hormone release. Fluoxetine, a serotonin neuronal reuptake blocker did not effect insulin secretion and had a slight glucagon stimulatory effect, however the effects of 5HTP on insulin and glucagon release were not potentiated by fluoxetine pretreatment. Alpha and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade did not alter the pancreatic effects of 5HTP.", 
    "3": "The effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on high-affinity binding of benzodiazepines to brain membranes has been investigated. GABA stimulated [3H]diazepam binding by more than 100% when extensively washed membranes from brain tissue were used. This GABA-stimulated benzodiazepine binding occurred in all brain regions examined. The stimulation was specific for GABA agonist. It was inhibited by the GABA receptor blocker bicuculline methiodide. A large number of compounds structurally closely related to GABA but without direct effect on the GABA receptor failed to enhance [3H]diazepam binding. The stimulation of benzodiazepine binding was caused by an increase in affinity; the number of binding sites remained unchanged. Half-maximal activation of [3H]diazepam binding occurred in the presence of 300 nM muscimol or 900 nM GABA. beta-Guanidinopropionic acid and imidazoleacetic acid were much weaker activators. It is suggested that the described stimulation of benzodiazepine high-affinity binding is mediated by a receptor for GABA. This site of GABA action exhibits different properties when compared to GABA receptors, as characterized by high-affinity binding of GABA agonists.", 
    "4": "In isolated splenic capsules of mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, cat and dog, either a single or a cumulative dose of l- and dl-isoproterenol at a concentration higher than l0(-9) M, induced a relaxation which was inhibited or blocked with pretreatment of 10(-5) M propranolol. At a concentration of 5 x 10(-6) M to 10(-5) M 1- and dl-isoproterenol, an inverse contraction was induced, and such response was prevented or reversed to one of relaxation in the presence of 10(-5) M phentolamine. Application of 10(-5) M epinephrine produced a strong contraction and such was reversed to one of relaxation after addition of 10(-4) M phentolamine. This relaxation was reduced or blocked with pretreatment of 10(-5) M propranolol. Thus, it was confirmed that both alpha- and beta-receptors exist in the splenic capsule area of these different species.", 
    "5": "The mechanisms responsible for altered adrenergic tone in hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are not fully understood. To investigate these mechanisms, the beta-adrenergic receptor-cyclic AMP complex of the turkey erythrocyte was studied among groups of normal, hyperthyroid, and hypothyroid turkeys. In erythrocytes obtained from hypothyroid turkeys, there were fewer beta-adrenergic receptors than in normal cells as determined by the specific binding of [(125)I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol, as well as associated decreases both in catecholamine-responsive adenylate cyclase activity and in cellular cyclic AMP content. In contrast, erythrocytes obtained from hyperthyroid turkeys contained the same number of beta-receptors and had the same catecholamine-responsive adenylate cyclase activity as cells from normal birds. Other characteristics of the beta-receptors in cells from hyperthyroid birds were indistinguishable from those present in normal erythrocytes. However, within the range of circulating catecholamine concentrations, 5-50 nM, the erythrocytes of the hyperthyroid turkeys generated substantially more cyclic AMP after exposure to isoproterenol than did normal cells. These results suggest that thyroid hormone affects beta-receptor-cyclic AMP interrelationships in the turkey erythrocyte by two distinct mechanisms: (a) In hypothyroidism, both beta-receptors and catecholamine-dependent cyclic AMP formation are coordinately decreased; (b) in hyperthyroidism, beta-receptors are unchanged but there is an amplification of the hormonal signal so that occupation of a given number of receptors at physiological concentrations of catecholamines leads to increased levels of cyclic AMP.", 
    "6": "Responsiveness to inotropic agents is altered in hypertension and may contribute to its initiation and maintenance. A biochemical basis for this change was provided by the observation that the number of beta-adrenergic receptors, as reflected in specific [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding, was diminished in both arteries and veins of spontaneously hypertensive rats. There was no change in the affinity of dihydroalprenolol for the binding sites or in the capacity of isoproterenol to displace dihydroalprenolol. The decline in beta-adrenergic receptor numbers is not secondary to blood pressure elevation but may, instead, contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension.", 
    "7": "Alpha- (phentolamine) and beta-adrenergic blocking agents (propranolol) and quinidine similarly enhance the specific binding of TSH to the guinea pig fat cell membranes over the concentration range of 2 X 10(-4) to 4 X 10(-3) M, increasing the binding affinity of TSH to the membranes. The percentage bound increased from 8% in the absence of agents to 32% (phentolamine), 29% (propranolol) and 24% (quinidine), respectively in the presence of these agents (1.5 X 10(-3) M). Each minimal detectable quantity of TSH was approximately 10 microU per tube in the presence of these agents (10(-3) M) as compared to 100 microU per tube in their absence. Both phentolamine and propranolol appeared to enhance the TSH binding to fat cell membranes through membrane-active, non-specific effects besides their alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking activities.", 
    "8": "1 The presence and type of adrenoceptors in the smooth muscle of the pig and human urinary bladder was assessed on the basis of the relative potency of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists.2 In isolated, carbachol-contracted bladder strips from the pig detrusor muscle the relaxing potency of isoprenaline was four times that of salbutamol and ritodrine and thirty times that of noradrenaline.3 Propranolol caused a parallel shift to the right of the noradrenaline dose-response curve which was not changed by phentolamine.4 Propranolol and butoxamine showed, in contrast to practolol, a dose-dependent antagonism of the response to isoprenaline. A pA(2) value of 9.2 +/- 0.2 and 6.8 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- s.e. mean) for the first two antagonists was calculated.5 In the bladder base of the pig, propranolol caused a parallel shift to the right and phentolamine a shift to the left of the dose-response curve to noradrenaline.6 In the human detrusor muscle the potency and maximum effect of isoprenaline and salbutamol were less than those in the pig detrusor muscle. The potency of isoprenaline was sixty times that of salbutamol.7 Whereas a parallel shift to the right of the dose-response curve to isoprenaline was obtained with propranolol, no antagonism was obtained with butoxamine or practolol.8 The results are interpreted as indicating the presence of beta(2)-adrenoceptors in the detrusor muscle of the pig and beta-adrenoceptors with neither beta(1)- nor beta(2)-characteristics in the detrusor muscle of man. An indication of the presence of alpha-adrenoceptors in the bladder base but not in the detrusor muscle of the pig was obtained.", 
    "9": "The muscle relaxing effect of beta-adrenoceptor agonists was examined without and with the presence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in strips from the pregnant and non-pregnant myometrium of the goat and from the pregnant myometrium of the cow. Isoprenaline, salbutamol and ritodrine caused a dose-dependent reduction of the spontaneous contractions of the pregnant myometrium and a dose-related and parallel shift to the right of the isoprenaline dose-response curve was obtained with butoxamine but not with practolol. Isoprenaline but neither salbutamol nor ritodrine caused a dose-related reduction of the spontaneous contractions in the non-pregnant myometrium and a dose-related and parallel shift to the right of the dose-response curve of isoprenaline was brought about with propranolol but not with either butoxamine or practolol. The muscle relaxing effect of ritodrine on the pregnant myometrium of the goat and cow shown in vitro was also demonstrated in vivo in the same species within eight hours of delivery. It is concluded that the beta-adrenoceptors in the pregnant myometrium of the goat and cow belong to the beta2-group whereas those in the non-pregnant myometrium cannot be classified as either beta1- or beta2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "10": "Acute left circumflex coronary artery (LC) occlusion in conscious dogs caused marked ischemia in the myocardium supplied by the occluded artery, as judged by the radioactive microsphere technique for determining blood flow distribution. With the chest open, LC pressure distal to the occlusion fell to 21 +/- 1.9% of aortic pressure. By 8 weeks after gradual LC occlusion with an ameroid constrictor, collateral development had restored coronary blood flow distribution to near-normal under basal conditions and during pacing, at a heart rate of 200 beats/min. The only evidence for ischemia was in the subepicardium within the distribution of the unoccluded left anterior descending artery, which provided the extra collateral blood flow. Distal LC pressure was 70 +/- 1.7% of aortic pressure. Propranolol 160 mg orally every 6 hours for 8 weeks had no detectable effect on coronary collateral development, as judged by blood flow distribution or distal LC pressure. The only significant difference for the propranolol dogs was a slight transmural shift away from the subendocardium in the left anterior descending region.", 
    "11": "Corpora lutea have been found in the ovarian tissue transplanted into the anterior ocular chamber of castrated two-month-old male rats receiving on 3rd through 7th post-natal days alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or p-chlorophenylalanine. Administration of these agents in combination with testosterone propionate to newborn female rats prevented essentially development of the anovulatory syndrome and maintained a normal picture of vaginal smears, ovarian and uterine structure as well as cyclic changes of adenohypophyseal and blood plasma lutropin contents and normal levels of estradiol and progesterone in the blood plasma except of progesterone level in animals receiving alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. The preventive effect of the adrenoblocking agents droperidol and propranolol was weak and inconstant. Results suggest participation of catecholamines and serotonin in the androgen-dependent sexual differentiation of the brain in rats.",

    "13": "1. -- In young well trained adults, adrenergic beta receptors blockade by pindolol or propranolol causes a relative bradycardia during running on a threadmill during 10 to 20 min at 50% VO2 max. 2. -- Pindolol activity is maximum for 5-7.5 mg ingested one hour before starting. In two subjects, tachycardia reappears for 30 mg : this secondary increase may be explained by an intrinsic sympathetic activity of pindolol. 3. -- Propranolol is about 14 times less active than pindolol without any intrinsic sympathetic activity.", 
    "14": "To determine optimal heart rate for the maximal cardiac output at various levels of inotropy and blood volume, the relationship between heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV) was examined in anaesthetized dogs during right atrial pacing. Myocardial inotropy was raised by intravenous infusion of isoproterenol, a stimulator of adrenergic beta-receptors, and reduced by propranolol, an inhibitor of adrenergic beta-receptors. Circulating blood volume was increased by saline infusion. Within the range of optimal heart rate, SV and HR were inversely related: SV = k (HR0-HR), where k indicates the relationship between changes in SV and HR. The intercept with the HR axis is HR0. At constant HR a rise in inotropy increased SV and a fall in inotropy reduced SV. These changes in SV were eual at every HR, and k was therefore constant. In contrast, blood volume expansion increased SV more at low than at high HR (k increased), but HR0 was not significantly changed. Calculated maximal cardiac output: k.HR02/4, and optimal heart/rate: HR0/2, agreed with observations when maximal cardiac output was raised from 1900 to 4500 ml/min by increasing blood volume and inotropy. Optimal HR was not influenced by changes in blood volume, but was increased from 160 to 200 beats/min by increasing inotropy. We conclude that the optimal heart rate and the maximal cardiac output can be predicted from the linear relationship between SV and HR during right atrial pacing.", 
    "15": "The relationship between preload and inotropy on left ventricular function was studied in anaesthetized open-chest dogs, by measuring left ventricular dimensions and stroke volume before and during saline infusion at different levels of inotropy. Left ventricular dimensions were continuously estimated by recording myocardial chord length (MCL) in the anterior wall of the left ventricle by ultrasonic technique. The effects of isoproterenol, a stimulator of adrenergic beta-receptors (high inotropy), and propranolol, an inhibitor of adrenergic beta-receptors (low inotropy), were examined during right atrial pacing at constant heart rate averaging 161 +/- 5 beats/min. Stroke volume was varied within the range 9.0 +/- 1.7 ml to 28.6 +/- 3.2 ml by increasing inotropy and preload. To increase preload, saline was infused intravenously until end-diastolic MCL increased by about 10% and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was higher than 10 mmHg. At constant heart rate and blood volume, both before and during saline infusion, end-diastolic MCL was not influenced by isoproterenol or propranolol administration. End-systolic MCL was reduced by raising inotropy. The difference between end-diastolic and end-systolic MCL, the systolic myocardial shortening (MS), increased during saline infusion; the relative increase in MS was the same at high and low inotropy. On average, MS was more than 50% longer at high than at low inotropy, both before and after saline infusion. Thus, left ventricular end-diastolic volume is increased by saline infusion and end-systolic volume is reduced by increasing inotropy. Preload and inotropy exert independent effects on stroke volume.", 
    "16": "Recent advances in the diagnosis, management and prognosis of hypertension in pregnancy are discussed, with emphasis on antihypertensive drug treatment. The use of diuretics, alpha-methyldopa, clonidine, hydrallazine, beta-adrenergic blockers, diazoxide, chlormethiazole, diazepam and heparin is given special attention.", 
    "17": "McN-2840-46, 2.5 mg/kg, i.v., protected against atrial tachyarrhythmias induced by three different methods in dogs and monkeys. The compound was inactive against ventricular arrhythmias produced by ouabain and by chloroform-epinephrine interaction at a four-fold higher dose. Significant reversal of ventricular arrhythmias produced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in dogs was achieved by infusion of 8.8 +/- 2.4 mg/kg, i.v. of McN-2840-46. Myocardial electrogram studies confirm that the atrium is preferentially affected. McN-2840-46 does not possess beta 1- or beta 2-adrenergic blocking activity when evaluated on isolated rabbit atrial and guinea-pit tracheal chain preparations. McN-2840-46 is vagolytic but not anticholinergic. The vagolytic activity is attributed to its local anesthetic effect. Depression of myocardial function was observed in anesthetized dogs and in the heart-lung preparation. However, the isolated cat papillary muscle was stimulated by McN-2840-46 and doses considerably above the effective anti-arrhythmic dose did not significantly decrease cardiac output in the non-anesthetized dog. The results of these experiments suggest that McN-2840-46 is a potent \"preferential\" atrial anti-arrhythmic agent.", 
    "18": "Dl-propranolol, acebutolol, atenolol, bupranolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, practolol, sotalol and d-propranolol were injected into the cisterna magna of anesthetized dogs with neurogenic hypertension induced by deafferentation and vagotomy. Dl-propranolol and bupranolol correct the hypertension and the tachycardia of the debuffered dog, whereas oxprenolol has only an action on the heart rate. The other beta-blocking drugs and d-propranolol were inactive at the doses used. Our results show that a mere central effect cannot explain the antihypertensive properties of all the tested beta-blocking agents.", 
    "19": "The uptake of radioactively labelled propranolol, oxprenolol, metoprolol, acebutolol, practolol and atenolol into brain, liver and lung tissue was studied five min after intravenous administration (1.0 mg/kg) in normotensive Wistar rats anaesthetised with nitrous oxide and halothane. All of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists including the least lipophilic compounds atenolol and practolol were detected in brain tissue five min after systemic administration. However, the level of propranolol (as measured by total radioactivity) in the bran was 40 and 67 times greater than the levels found for atenolol and practolol, respectively. Additionally, significantly more radioactivity was detected in lung tissue compared to that in liver tissue for the lipophilic, non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol and oxprenolol. Levels of radioactivity in blood, brain, liver and lung were measured 5, 15, 30 and 60 min after administration of either propranolol or atenolol (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) to both conscious and anaesthetised rats and a tendency towards high tissue levels of radioactivity was found in the animals which received the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists under anaesthesia. Pretreatment of groups of rats for 7, 14 and 21 days with unlabelled atenolol (1.0 mg/kg/day, i.p.) caused an increase in the subsequent central uptake of labelled atenolol whilst both the blood levels of radioactivity and the uptake into peripheral tissues were significantly lower in the 2 and 3 week pretreated rats compared to the control animals. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a central action may contribute to the antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "20": "A 17-year-old male patient with eczematous and psoriasiform eruption that developed during long-term therapy with Propanolol (Avlocardyl) has been studied. This eruption disappeared after removal of the drug; oral challenge was soon followed by a vesiculous and bullous eruption of face and extremities; five months later, sun exposure was followed by a severe eczematous eruption in these areas; nails changes were then observed. Most of side-effects of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs have been reported with Practolol: lichenoid, exanthematous, eczematous, psoriasiform rashes; exfoliative dermatitis; oculo-muco-cutaneous reactions; fibrosing polyseritis and drug induced systemic lupus erythematosus manifestations. Adverse effects of other beta-adrenergic blocking agents are less frequent. The pathogenetic mechanism responsible for these adverse reactions is still obscur: these changes might be caused by blockade of the epidermal cells (and T-lymphocytes) beta-receptors, more than by a direct immunologic, allergic or toxic mechanism.", 
    "21": "The hypotensive action of verapamil given orally was assessed in the outpatient management of patients with raised blood pressure, in a single blind study. Twenty-six hypertensive patients on no therapy, 14 on beta blockers and eight on methyldopa were more satisfactorily controlled when verapamil was substituted for the initial drug. There was a marked reduction in the number of side-effects, and the drug was given in many situations where beta blockade was contra-indicated.", 
    "22": "The role of noradrenergic neurons originating from the locus coeruleus (LC) in blood pressure regulation was studied by stereotaxic administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the LC in Wistar-Kyoto rats. The administration of 6-OHDA (12 micrograms/6 microliters) into the bilateral LC resulted in hypertension and tachycardia, which lasted for 12 days and gradually returned to the levels observed before administration. The systolic blood pressure and heart rate were 172 mmHg and 460 beats/min on the mean respectively, one day after administration. The induced hypertension and tachycardia were closely correlated with the depletion of norepinephrine (NE) content in the cortex and the medulla-pons in rats in a hypertensive state. The correlation between the NE content of the cortex and blood pressure was particularly marked (r = -0.793, p less than 0.02). Furthermore, destructive change of the LC was observed histologically in the hypertensive rats. They hypertension was completely prevented by pretreatment with desipramine before 6-OHDA administration. These findings suggest that 6-OHDA induced degeneration, probably mainly in the dorsal bundle originating from the LC and in the LC itself. It is suggested, therefore, that localized chemical degeneration of the bilateral LC causes hypertension and tachycardia as a consequence of denervation of the dorsal bundle of noradrenergic neurons originating from the LC.", 
    "23": "Effects of various hormonal and pharmacological manipulations on somatostatin distribution were investigated to elucidate the physiological significance of somatostatin in the hypothalamus and the other regions of the rat brain. Immunoreactive somatostatin (IRS) was measured by radioimmunoassay newly developed. Insulin induced an increase of hypothalamic IRS and a decrease of plasma RGH, while glucose administration resulted in the opposite responses, which were not significant. Insulin also increased IRS in the thalamus and the brain stem. The insulin-induced increase of hypothalamic IRS was reduced by hyperglycemia. Glucagon reduced IRS initially and then increased it with an elevation plasma RGH. L-dopa did not affect hypothalamic IRS, although it decreased plasma RPRL. Phentolamine slightly increased plasma RGH and decreased IRS in most regions of the rat brain, while propranolol increased IRS in these regions. Pretreatment with propranolol significantly increased plasma RGH 120 min after insulin administration, and hypothalamic IRS decreased initially by pretreatment with propranolol, and then it increased significantly. When pretreated with propranolol, glucagon markedly increased plasma RGH and decreased IRS significantly. From these findings it is concluded that hypothalamic IRS may participate in the hormonal regulatory system in correlation to plasma RGH, as observed in studies on plasma GH and hypothalamic IRS following insulin, glucose, propranolol or phentolamine administration, but IRS in other regions of the brain may have some other actions as a neurotransmitter or a modulator, because of no significant correlation between plasma GH or PRL and IRS in these regions following various stimuli. In addition, glucose homeostasis and adrenergic mechanism may be important factors in regulating IRS in the rat brain.", 
    "24": "We studied the contribution of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor activation to the cardiovascular, metabolic, and hormonal effects of dopamine. At a concentration of 1.5 mug/kg.min, the infusion of dopamine in 12 normal volunteers was associated with a transient but significant rise in pulse rate, which was prevented by propranolol. Venous plasma glucose did not change throughout the experiments, and a mild increase in plasma free fatty acid levels observed during the administration of dopamine alone was antagonized by propranolol. In contrast, neither the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, nor the alpha-adrenergic blocker, phentolamine, was effective in inhibiting the dopamine-induced rise in plasma glucagon (from 82+/-9 to 128+/-14 pg/ml; P < 0.005) and serum insulin (from 7.5+/-1 to 13+/-1.5 muU/ml; P < 0.005) or its suppression of plasma prolactin (from 8.5+/-1 to 5.2+/-0.8 ng/ml; P < 0.001). Although serum growth hormone levels did not change during the infusion of dopamine alone, an obvious rise occurred in three subjects during the combined infusion of propranolol and dopamine. Whereas some metabolic and cardiovascular effects of dopamine are mediated through adrenergic mechanisms, these observations indicate that this is not the case for the effects of this catecholamine on glucagon, insulin, and prolactin secretion, and thus provide further support for the theory of a specific dopaminergic sensitivity of these hormonal systems in man.", 
    "25": "The effects of adrenergic substances on pancreatic insular secretions were studied in a completely isolated canine pancreas with exclusion of the duodenum from the perfusion circuit. To ensure adequate blockade, blockers were infused before agonists. A dose range of beta-receptor blockade was tested, and putative alpha-adrenergic effects were confirmed by combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade.beta-Adrenergic agonism (2 ng/ml isoproterenol) induced a mean integrated increase of 79+/-20% in somatostatin secretion, whereas glucagon and insulin secretion were increased by 185+/-45 and 495+/-146%, respectively. The stimulations of D, A, and B cells were abolished by propranolol.alpha-Adrenergic agonism (10 ng/ml epinephrine) after beta-adrenergic blockade) moderately decreased somatostatin (-37+/-7%) secretion, moderately increased glucagon (91+/-19%), and markedly decreased insulin (-85+/-3%) release. Similar effects on D-, A-, and B-cell secretion were induced with 2 ng/ml epinephrine or 10 ng/ml norepinephrine after beta-adrenergic blockade. The alpha-adrenergic effects on the D and A cell were abolished by either phentolamine or by phenoxybenzamine. This study showed that there are indeed alpha-adrenergic receptors on A cells and that the secretion of glucagon, a \"stress\" hormone, was stimulated either by alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptor agonism. D-cell secretion, like that of the B cell, was inhibited by alpha-adrenergic agonism and was stimulated by beta-adrenergic agonism. However, beta-adrenergic-induced changes in D-cell secretion were smaller in magnitude than those of B-cell secretion.", 
    "26": "Benzimidazoles carrying the 2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino)propoxy side chain at either the C-4 or C-5 ring positions were synthesized and investigated for beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Both compounds demonstrated beta2 selectivity when evaluated in guinea pig atrial and tracheal preparations. The C-4 isomer was 17 times more selective toward tracheal tissue, and its overall potency was roughly comparable to that of propranolol. beta2 selectivity of the C-5 isomer was minimal, with a potency about one-hundredth that of propranolol.", 
    "27": "Nadolol, a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent, was administered orally in gradually increasing single daily doses to 13 hospitalized patients with essential hypertension. Maximal doses ranged from 200 to 480 mg/day. Blood pressure was reduced in nine patients and heart rate was decreased in 11 patients. The decrease in blood pressure was either partial or temporary in five of the nine patients who responded. Concomitant administration of the diuretic chlorthalidone decreased blood pressure in a previously unresponsive patient. Nadolol effectively inhibited isoproterenol-induced tachycardia and decreased cardiac output by 18 per cent. Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration were not changed significantly by the treatment. Body weight was not altered significantly. Blood pressure response was independent of the pretreatment renin levels or the change in renin induced by nadolol; it was also independent of the changes in cardiac output and heart rate but was more pronounced in patients with milder baseline hypertension. The decline in serum concentration of nadolol was consistent with the drug's reported half-life of 12.2 hours. The results indicate that single daily doses of nadolol alone can reduce blood pressure significantly with minimal cardiodepressant effects and no important side effects. The effectiveness of nadolol may be enhanced by the addition of a diuretic.", 
    "28": "The intravenous injection of isoprenaline (10 nmole/kg) into conscious beagle dogs caused significant increases in the blood level of lactate, glucose, FFA, insulin and cyclic AMP. These metabolic alterations induced by isoprenaline were blocked completely by pretreatment of the dog with propranolol (1 mg/kg). Butoxamine (10 mg/kg) antagonized isoprenaline-induced increases in glucose, lactate and insulin, but not the increases in FFA. Practolol (10 mg/kg) diminished the increase in blood FFA very strongly. Salbutamol, which is known to be an agonist of the beta 2-subtype in its bronchomotor and cardiovascular actions, produced marked increases in the blood concentrations of lactate, glucose and insulin but were without effect on the FFA level. Thus metabolic responses of conscious beagle dogs to beta-adrenoceptor agonists appeared to depend differentially on two types of beta-adrenoceptors: beta1-adrenoceptors are largely involved in lipolysis while beta2-adrenoceptors are involved in the regulation of blood glucose metabolism and insulin secretion. A new beta-adrenoceptor agonist, 5-(1-hydroxy-2-isopropylaminobutyl)-8-hydroxycarbostyril hydrochloride hemihydrate (Procaterol), was classified as a beta 2-agonist, because it markedly increased plasma concentrations of glucose, lactate and insulin but increased the plasma level of FFA to a lesser degree. The order of potency of beta2-agonists was procaterol greater than salbutamol greater than trimetoquinol. Metabolic responses of beagle dogs would be useful for appreciating the selectivity and potency of beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists.", 
    "29": "Progressive changes in the S-T interval of the fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) were studied in 14 lamb fetuses, acutely exteriorized and subjected to graded hypoxia. The aims of the study were to investigate whether beta-adrenoceptor stimulation and hypoxia exerted additive or potentiating effects on the FECG and several cardiovascular parameters and whether the hypoxic changes of the FECG could be blocked by beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. The FECG changes were studied in order to correlate them with cardiovascular function, as measured by heart rate, mean arterial pressure, end diastolic pressure, maximum dP/dt and combined cardiac output, estimated by the thermodilution method, as well as with blood gases, acid base status, blood lactate and glucose. Injections of small doses (0.02 to 0.4 microg kg-1 min-1) of isoprenaline induced the same pattern of changes in the FECG as we have previously recorded during hypoxia. By increasing the isoprenaline dose an increase in the duration of the FECG changes and amplitude of the T-wave changes was obtained. Propranolol was found to completely abolish the FECG changes induced by isoprenaline, as well as by mild hypoxia. During severe hypoxia the FECG changes could not be abolished by propranolol. Our previous findings indicated that the hypoxic changes could be regarded as a sign of myocardial glycolysis. Thus, the present finding that even small doses of isoprenaline given to the fetus, initiates the same pattern of FECG changes corroborate this hypothesis.", 
    "30": "Hemodynamic effects of isoproterenol, dopamine, and epinephrine were studied before and after acute beta-adrenergic blockade in 16 open-chest, anesthetized mongrel dogs. Beta blockade was induced with 1 mg. per kilogram of intravenous propranolol. Cardiac output measurements were obtained by thermal dilution, and pressure recordings were obtained in the right ventricle, pulmonary artery, left atrium, left ventricle, and aorta. Derived parameters included stroke volume, pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances, and peak left ventricular dP/dt. In the presence of propranolol, epinephrine became a lethal drug in large doses and did not increase cardiac output in standard doses. Dopamine, in 25 to 50 mcg. per kilogram per minute doses, increased arterial pressure and systemic resistance; cardiac output was diminished compared with dopamine, 10 mcg. per kilogram per minute, prior to propranolol, as a result of increased resistance and decreased LV contractility. Isoproterenol, 0.6 to 0.9 mcg. per kilogram per minute, 15 to 20 times standard dosages, had moderately positive inotropic effects and increased cardiac output. Left ventricular systolic pressure with isoproterenol after propranolol was reduced when compared with effects of smaller doses prior to propranolol. These observations suggest that none of the catecholamines studied would be optimal for circulatory support in heart failure in the presence of propranolol. The present results define a pharmacologic basis for design of appropriate drug combinations for circulatory support in beta-blocked animals.", 
    "31": "1. Rats were made hypertensive by 5 days of continuous isolation in glass metabolic cages; in the text \"hypertensive\" means having a systolic blood pressure greater than 145 mmHg. 2. Daily intraperitoneal injections of either propranolol (5 mg/kg) or atenolol (5 mg/kg) reduced systolic blood pressure within 3 days and the systolic blood pressure remained low provided that the treatment was continued. 3. Treatment with metoprolol also lowered the systolic blood pressure of isolated rats but only when a larger dose (10 mg/kg) was given. 4. Systolic blood pressure returned to hypertensive levels following withdrawal of treatment after 15 days of isolation. However, following cessation of treatment after 27 days of isolation, the systolic blood pressure did not rise. 5. Rats given propranolol in the drinking water (intake equivalent to a daily dose of 5 mg/kg) before and during isolation did not develop hypertension. 6. The possibility that suppression of sympathetic function by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was responsible for these changes is discussed.", 
    "32": "The positive cardiac chronotropic effects of the antiarrhythmic compound, QX 572, in anaesthetized cats has been shown mainly to be due to a release of catecholamines from sympathetic nerve-endings. Furthermore, these undesired effects of QX 572 on heart rate were decreased by adrenergic beta blockade in the animals. In the present study it was found that an adrenergic beta-blockade did not reveal any cardiodepressive effects of QX 572, that in the normal animals might have been masked by the effects of the drug-induced catecholamine-release.", 
    "33": "Asthmatic patients who showed an allergic skin reaction to house-dust antigen (HD) were injected intradermally with a mixture of HD and a various dose of isoproterenol (Isopr) or propranolol (Propr). In some cases Isopr clearly suppressed the formation of the wheal, but in some others Isopr did not much affect the allergic skin reaction. Also Propr increased markedly the skin reaction of some patients, or had little effect on it. The sensitivity of the skin of asthmatic patients to these drugs was closely correlated with the general response of the patients to adrenaline, such as changes in heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose level, and blood triglyceride level.", 
    "34": "The study investigated the acute hemodynamic changes induced in patients with angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease by 3 beta-blockers: metoprolol, cardioselective without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), group I, 11 patients; bunitrolol, noncardioselective with ISA, group II, 11 patients; oxprenolol, noncardioselective with ISA, group III, 11 patients. Hemodynamic variables were obtained at rest and during exercise, before and 45 min after 10 mg i.v. of the drug. Changes in LVEDP and cardiac indexes were such as LV function was improved in 1 patient of group I, 7 patients of group II and 5 patients of group III; impaired in 4 patients of group I and in 1 patient of group III; unchanged in the others. Contractility indexes were less influenced by bunitrolol and oxprenolol. During exercise there was a significant difference between groups for LVEDP which was lower in group II (P less than 0.01). The data seem to indicate that the choice of the beta-blocker may be of importance when it is desirable that an already compromised cardiac function be not further impaired by pharmacological intervention.", 
    "35": "In a double-blind, double crossover experiment, 18 healthy young men received over 3-day periods either 100 mg atenolol, 80 mg propranolol, or placebo. The subjects underwent various motor and cognitive tests 18 h after each last dose had been taken. Propranolol significantly increased variability of a choice reaction-time task. Scores on various subjective rating scales showed that propranolol had a larger mood elevating effect than atenolol. Heart rate and blood pressure were significantly reduced 24h after atenolol medication; these effects were absent or reduced after propranolol had been given.", 
    "36": "Ten chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients were treated in a single-blind trial for six weeks with propranolol in daily doses increasing up to 3 g in order to evaluate a modified dose regimen of propranolol treatment in these patients. Four of the patients improved significantly and could be released from the hospital, regaining premorbid social and work adjustments. The modified regimen proved safe as long as the dose increment was not more than 80 mg/day. The mean therapeutic level of propranolol was 1600 mg/day, which proved to be a safe dose. Although three patients with hypertensive encephalophaty responded, their response was related not to the maximum dose but to a drastic change in the rate of the dose increase. It seems that on the basis of these results a double-blind comparative study would be worthwhile.", 
    "37": "The effects on diabetic control of the relative cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol and the non-selective drug propranolol were compared in 20 hypertensive diabetic patients receiving diet alone or diet and oral hypoglycaemic agents. Each drug was given for one month in a double-blind, cross-over study. Fasting, noon, and mid-afternoon blood sugar concentrations rose by 1.0-1.5 mmol/l (18-27 mg/100 ml). The rise with propranolol was not significantly greater than with metoprolol. In a few patients the rise was clinically important. The small overall change observed in diabetic control should not deter the use of beta-blockers in non-insulin-dependent diabetics, provided control is carefully monitored at the onset of treatment.", 
    "38": "The activity of the beta-receptor blocker pindolol (0.4 mg i.v.) was investigated alone and in combination with digitalis (moderately fast loading) in 12 patients with coronary heart disease and without manifest signs of cardiac insufficiency. These patients showed pathological increase of left ventricular filling pressure during exercise testing. The exercise-induced rise of the mean pulmonary arterial and capillary pressures were increased by pindolol. Concurrently the increase of cardiac frequency was clearly diminished during ergometry (from 107/min without pindolol to 96/min, P less than 0.005). Digoxin given orally for an average of 5 days prevented the pressure increase in the pulmonary circulation induced by pindolol during exercise testing and at rest. The frequency reducing effect of pindolol was potentiated by digitalis. Use of digitalis alone did not influence mean exercise-induced pressure increase of the pulmonary circulation. In fact in some cases deterioration of these parameters was observed.", 
    "39": "In the rabbit jejunum, the elevation of temperature within the range of 25-37 degrees C diminished the sensitivity to noradrenaline (NA) for both the relaxation and amplitude inhibition. The relaxation by NA was mainly mediated via adrenergic beta-receptors at 25, 30 or 37 degrees C. The amplitude inhibition was mediated via alpha-receptors at 37 degrees C, and both alpha- and beta-receptors at 30 or 25 degrees C.", 
    "40": "Field stimulation of isolated, spirally-cut cervix from day-22 pregnant rats produced contractions which could be inhibited by tetrodotoxin or hyoscine and potentiated by propranolol. The rat cervix would appear to receive both cholinergic and noradrenergic innervations whose transmitters activate muscarinic cholinoceptors and beta-adrenoceptors respectively.", 
    "41": "The anticonvulsant activity of racemic and (+)-propranolol was studied in rats. Neither drug changed the current to produce a minimal seizure in 50% of animals. Both drugs were effective in the maximal electroshock seizure test, the (+) isomer being more potent than the racemic form. Since the (+) isomer is practically devoid of beta-adrenergic blocking activity, the anticonvulsant effects of propranolol do not result from beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "42": "beta-Adrenoceptor agonists increase myocardial ischemic injury, mainly by elevating myocardial oxygen consumption. Moreover, it has been shown that isoprenaline may \"steal\" regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) from ischemic to non ischemic areas and from epicardium to endocardium. The mechanisms of these two isoprenaline-induced redistributions of RMBF have been investigated by the use of radioactive microspheres in an experimental model of canine myocardial ischemia with simultaneous measurement of ST-segment elevation. Isoprenaline increased RMBF in both epi- and endocardial non ischemic areas and in epicardial ischemic areas, leading to a significant decrease in the endo/epi ratio. After atenolol, isoprenaline still increased RMBF but to a lesser extent and the endo/epi ratio was still decreased. Salbutamol, in doses inducing no significant changes in cardiac parameters or myocardial oxygen consumption, produced effects similar to those of isoprenaline. These results indicate a non-homogeneous beta2-stimulation-induced vasodilation in endo- and epicardium, which might be due either to the higher epicardial coronary vasocilatory reserve or to a heterogeneous distribution of transmural beta2-adrenoceptors. Isoprenaline also decreased the ischemic/non ischemic total blood flow ratio (I/NI) and caused further increases in ST-segment elevation. These effects were abolished by atenolol pretreatment, indicating the deleterious effects of isoprenaline-induced tachycardia in this I/NI decrease and in the ischemic injury.", 
    "43": "It is reported on a 38-year-old female patient who was treated for 18 days with 150 mg cordanum (talinolol) each and then fell ill with a dyspeptic clinical picture and signs of cholestase. The result of a liver biopsy was the picture of a cholestatic hepatosis. According to the results of the lymphocyte transformation test and the monocyte test as well as to the reexposition with following clinical recidivation the talinolol medication is to be regarded as cause. Pathogenetically is referred to the structural relations of talinolol to substances with paragroups as well as to a possible summation of different loads of the liver function.", 
    "44": "The possible mechanism and the therapeutic activity of a beta-blocking drug (propranolol) in 50 patients with slight \"hyperthyroidism\" or \"dysthyroidism\" are examined. In most cases, the laboratory findings were :1) increase (sometimes considerable) of basal metabolism (up to 70% or more); 2) normal, or nearly normal, thyroid scan, iodoproteinaemia, T3 and T4; 3) therapeutic iodine improvement. Prior to the introduction of scanning, these cases would have been classed as \"hyperthyroidism\" or \"dysthyroidism\". Observation of a normal scan picture, however, throws doubt on such a diagnosis. Cases have, in fact, been noted in which the syndrome was accompanied by normal RU T3, but a marked increase in RIA T3. Since the latter is five times more active, it might be supposed that its increases was responsible for the symptoms, i.e. there could be an increase in T3 activity, even though its quantity was still within normal limits. In other words, there may be cases of genuine hyperthyroidism due to such a proportional rise in RIA T3. Propranolol had a beneficial effect on a series of manifestations that can be described as \"hyperthyroidism\" or \"hypersympathicotonia\".", 
    "45": "A six-month study of triglyceride, cholesterol, free fatty acid (FFA), glucose, insulin, growth hormone, and glucagon concentrations was carried out in asymptomatic hypertensive normal-weight men randomly allocated to treatment with atenolol or propranolol. A highly significant increase in the basal plasma triglyceride concentration was observed in propranolol-treated patients after three and six months' treatment, with a smaller but significant increase in atenolol-treated subjects after six months' treatment. The changes in triglyceride concentration could not be ascribed to variations in plasma insulin, growth hormone, or glucagon concentrations. Basal FFA concentrations were reduced during the first three months of treatment in both groups but returned to pretreatment levels after six months. Plasma cholesterol concentrations were unchanged by either agent.", 
    "46": "Recent research shows that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis either maintains or causes some or all of the high blood pressure of most patients and demonstrates anew that renin-sodium profiling defines this involvement. Performed with a serum potassium measurement, this now reliable test is useful for primary screening and then, in conjunction with renal vein renin studies or an aldosterone profile, for diagnosis or exclusion of surgically curable renovascular or adrenocortical hypertensions. For the remaining majority with essential hypertension, renin profiling exposes the relative participation of either vasoconstriction or volume factors, thereby guiding simpler, more specific, and predictably effective antirenin or antivolume treatments. Renin profiling identifies those in whom treatment should begin with a beta-blocker as opposed to a diuretic while not infrequently also providing baseline information about severity and prognosis in individual patients.", 
    "47": "The Authors considered the variations in electrolyte plasmatic assessment in blood samples incubated \"in vitro\" with propranolol (48 gamma/10 cc) and part of sample incubated with propranolol and theophyllin-ethilandiamin. The evaluation of electrolyte assessment was performed at 20'-40'-60' after tonometration. Sodium and potassium values increase in the samples with the beta-blocking agent and are statistically significant only after 20'; in further controls the increasing values persist. Chloride rises too, marked by a low statistic significance. No variations were observed in samples incubated also with propranolol and antiphosphodiestherasic agent. The Authors suggest trat data should confirm ionic transport blockage across the red cell membrane obtained with theophylline.", 
    "48": "An adenylate cyclase activated as much as 25-fold by low concentrations of octopamine has been identified in the firefly lantern. The relative potency of octopamine and various other amines in stimulating this enzyme, and effects of antagonists in blocking octopamine activation, correlate well with the known effects of these agents in affecting light production. In addition to suggesting a role for adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (or pyrophosphate) in the neural control of firefly flashing, identification of this potent enzyme should facilitate the characterization of phenylethylamine receptors in excitable tissue."
