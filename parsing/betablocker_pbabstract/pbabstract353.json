    "0": "Patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the absence of a reversible cause require long-term therapy. Six approaches may have value in this setting, including individualized drug therapy selected by the invasive approach, individualized drug therapy selected by the noninvasive approach, beta-blocking therapy, amiodarone, transcatheter or electrosurgical ablation, and the implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Data supporting the four pharmacologic approaches and data comparing these approaches to one another and to the implantable cardioverter defibrillator are reviewed. Support for primary therapy with a beta-blocker is the weakest. Nevertheless, a role for concomitant beta-blockade is established. Comparisons of the invasive and noninvasive approaches suggest that, in drug-naive patients, the invasive approach is effective but the noninvasive approach is not, whereas in drug-resistant patients, neither approach is adequate. Data suggesting that amiodarone is more effective than individualized drug therapy is not compelling but is widely accepted. Given these uncertainties, many authorities have embraced the implantable cardioverter defibrillator as the therapy of choice.", 
    "1": "The beta 3 subtype of adrenaline and noradrenaline receptors has now been extensively characterized at the structural and functional levels. Ligand binding and adenylyl cyclase activation studies helped define a beta-adrenergic profile that is quite distinct from that of the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors, but strongly reminiscent of most of the \"atypical\" responses reported in earlier pharmacologic studies. Human, other large mammal, and rodent receptors share most of the characteristic beta 3 properties, although obvious species-specific differences have been identified. Recently, the incidence of a naturally occurring variant of the human beta 3-adrenergic receptor was shown to be correlated with hereditary obesity in Pima Indians and in Japanese individuals, and in Western obese patients with increased dynamic capacity to add on weight and develop non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). A mild weight increase was also shown to develop in female, but not male, mice in which the beta 3 receptor gene was disrupted. Taken together, these results now provide a consistent picture of an important role of the beta 3-adrenoceptor in the regulation of lipid metabolism and as an obvious target for drugs to treat some forms of obesity.", 
    "2": "Nisoldipine is a second-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB). It is the most vascular selective of the currently available CCBs, and thus has the capacity to lower blood pressure without affecting the functioning of the myocardium and skeletal muscle, and without producing any negative inotropic effects. Nisoldipine coat core (CC) is an extended-release formulation that allows nisoldipine to be released gradually over 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations in plasma concentration and providing a good trough/peak ratio. It has a slow onset and long duration of action, and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has demonstrated that its antihypertensive effect is maintained over 24 hours with no evidence of reflex tachycardia, hypotension, or sympathetic neurohormonal activation and no effects on circadian variation. Studies in patients with hypertension have shown that nisoldipine CC provides reductions in blood pressure that are at least equivalent to those seen with diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and other CCBs, without deleterious effects on metabolic parameters. In particular, it has been found to be effective in elderly patients and in black patients with severe hypertension. The DEFIANT studies have demonstrated that nisoldipine CC improves cardiac function and exercise tolerance in patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction, without increasing the risk of mortality compared with placebo. It also improves exercise performance in patients with stable angina pectoris. Nisoldipine CC is well tolerated in all groups of patients, with the most frequently reported side effects being headache and peripheral edema, which are usually mild and transient.", 
    "3": "Adenine nucleotides, lactate and pyruvate were monitored by microdialysis in pig hearts, comprising four experimental groups. Two preconditioned groups, one beta-blocked by metoprolol (0.3 mg kg-1 body wt; n = 6) and the other (n = 7) without beta-blockade. Two groups were not preconditioned, one beta-blocked (n = 6) and one without beta-blockade (n = 7). Probes were inserted into ischaemic and non-ischaemic myocardium. Preconditioning consisted of four consecutive 10 min periods of ischaemia each separated by 20 min of reperfusion. All animals were subjected to 40 min of index ischaemia followed by 25 min of reperfusion. Myocardial cAMP content was determined in biopsies after the final reperfusion and was found low in the beta-blocked groups. Lactate levels during index ischaemia exceeded the basal level 4-6 fold in dialysate. Adenosine concentration reached 12 mumol L-1 during the first preconditioning period while an attenuation was typical for the following three preconditioning periods. The sum of the concentrations of adenosine inosine and hypoxanthine was significantly lower during index ischaemia in the preconditioned groups displaying a peak value of 115 mumol L-1. The corresponding value for unpreconditioned hearts was 230 mumol L-1. The part of adenosine was 5% and less than 1%, respectively. Pyruvate concentration decreased during each brief ischaemic period of preconditioning rising to a higher level of reperfusion. The decrease in pyruvate was smaller in the controls during index ischaemia. The effects of beta-blockade and preconditioning on ischaemic metabolism were comparable and the results of the two treatments were not additive in this respect.", 
    "4": "Low energy biatrial shock is an effective means of restoring sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Ventricular proarrhythmia is avoided provided that shocks are well synchronized to R waves that are not at closely coupled intervals or preceded by long-short cycles. Based on these principles, an implantable atrial defibrillator has been developed and was implanted in three patients with drug refractory paroxysmal AF. The device detects AF via an actively fixed right atrial and a self-retaining coronary sinus defibrillating leads, and delivers 3/3 ms biphasic shocks up to 300 V synchronized to the R wave. The mean implant threshold (ED50) was 195 V (1.8 J). and minimum voltage at conversion during follow-up assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months were 260 V, 2.5 J. 250 V, 2.3 J, and 300 V, 3.0 J respectively. Detection of AF was 100% specific and shocks were 100% synchronized, although only a proportion of synchronized R waves were considered suitable for shock delivery primarily because of closely coupled cycles. Three patients had 9 spontaneous AF episodes, 8/9 (89%) successfully defibrillated by shocks of 260-300 V. Sedation was not used in 4 out of 9 (45%) episodes. Backup ventricular pacing was initiated by the device in 6 out of (67%) episodes. One patient had more frequent AF after lead placement, which subsided after a change of medication. There was no ventricular proarrhythmia. It is concluded that an implantable atrial defibrillator is a viable therapy for selected patients with paroxysmal AF. The device is capable of accurate AF detection, R wave synchronization and ventricular support pacing after successful defibrillation of AF.", 
    "5": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of atrial cardioversion using an endocardial single lead system presently used for ventricular defibrillation. The study population consisted of 26 recipients of an ICD in combination with a conventional endocardial single lead system with the proximal spring electrode as anode in the SVC and the distal as cathode in the apex of the RV. Atrial tachyarrhythmias were induced by right atrial burst pacing. If the arrhythmia sustained > 1 minute, biphasic shocks synchronized with the R wave were delivered using the implanted device, beginning with an energy of 4 J. If 4 J failed to terminate the arrhythmia, energy was increased stepwise, if the first shock was successful, a step-down testing was performed after reinduction of atrial tachyarrhythmias. The mean atrial defibrillation threshold was 2.3 +/- 1.2 J (range, 0.5-5 J). A total of 154 shocks were delivered and no adverse effects were observed. The mean defibrillation threshold for atrial flutter was somewhat lower than that for AF (1.8 +/- 1 J vs 2.7 +/- 1.4 J, P = 0.08). There was no correlation between the atrial defibrillation threshold and a history of previously occurring atrial tachyarrhythmias, the kind of the underlying heart disease, a prescription of antiarrhythmic drugs, the dimension of the LA, the LVEF, or the ventricular DFT. Internal atrial cardioversion of short duration atrial tachyarrhythmias using a transvenous single lead system designed for ventricular defibrillation is feasible and safe at low energies, and may have important clinical applications.", 
    "6": "Periodically in the history of hypertensive therapy there have been minor storms that have significantly affected the utilization of entire classes of agents. The first storm struck with the case-control studies suggesting that reserpine was associated with an increased risk of carcinoma of the breast, a claim subsequently disproved by a number of other studies. The second storm was initiated by a subanalysis of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), from which it was inferred that, in a subset of hypertensive patients, diuretic treatment may have been harmful rather than beneficial. Despite this claim and other speculations, diuretics-especially at low doses-remain a gold standard of antihypertensive therapy. Recently, a third storm has developed in the field of antihypertensive therapy: a case-control study report and a non-randomized cohort study have questioned the use of calcium channel blockers in hypertension. The case-control study suffers from the limitations inherent in this study design, which often gives rise to conflicts and contradiction. In fact, another case-control study published in 1995 reached exactly the opposite conclusions and claimed that calcium channel blockers were associated with significantly less myocardial infarction than traditional antihypertensive therapy. A meta-analysis was also presented as supporting the non-randomized studies questioning the safety of calcium channel blockers. However, it refers to patients with coronary heart disease, not to patients with hypertension, and also combined studies performed with different aims, and data from short-term and long-term studies using short-acting formulations of calcium channel blockers. The controversies generated by these reports have gone well beyond their scientific merit. For final judgement we should wait for well-designed prospective studies, several of which are under way. For the time being, there is no reason to change the current practice of antihypertensive therapy, as summarized in the recommendations of both the United States Joint National Committee and the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension Committee, that is, diuretics and beta-blockers are among those antihypertensive agents with clearly proven benefits in mortality-morbidity studies, but calcium channel blockers as well as ACE inhibitors and alpha-blockers can also be used profitably in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "7": "Nisoldipine coat core (CC) is a long-acting calcium channel blocker (CCB) with a slow and smooth onset of action. It is effective in the treatment of angina pectoris, increasing exercise duration, time to ST segment depression and time to onset of angina. The results of two studies reviewed here, in which patients received concomitant treatment with a beta-blocker, showed that the anti-anginal efficacy of nisoldipine CC, 40 mg once daily, measured at trough was comparable with amlodipine, 10 mg once daily, and with diltiazem retard, 120 mg twice daily, and that efficacy was maintained over a 24-hour period. The third trial reviewed here showed that nisoldipine CC was at least as effective as three-times-daily treatment with diltiazem (total dose 240 mg). To date, the effects of nisoldipine CC have been investigated in over 4,000 patients with hypertension and angina pectoris. Clinical experience suggests that once-daily nisoldipine CC is at least as well tolerated as other CCBs, provides consistent efficacy and is a useful treatment in the management of patients with angina pectoris. The CCBs show promising beneficial effects in experimental atherosclerosis and a small number of clinical trials show some effect on the progression of atherosclerosis in coronary artery disease and restenosis following coronary angioplasty. An ongoing long-term trial with nisoldipine CC after coronary angioplasty is discussed.", 
    "8": "1. In this study, we examined the mechanism(s) by which s.c. nicotine inhibits synovial plasma extravasation. We found that nicotine dose-dependently inhibited bradykinin (BK)- and platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced plasma extravasation. 2. The effect of nicotine on both BK- and PAF-induced plasma extravasation was attenuated by adrenal medullectomy. ICI-118,551 (a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker) (30 micrograms ml-1, intra-articularly) significantly attenuated the inhibitory action of high-dose (1 mg kg-1) nicotine on BK-induced plasma extravasation without affecting the inhibition by low- (0.01 microgram kg-1) dose nicotine or that on PAF-induced plasma extravasation by nicotine at any dose. This suggested that beta 2-adrenoceptors mediate the inhibitory actions of high-dose, but not low-dose, nicotine. We also found that systemic naloxone (an opioid receptor antagonist) (two hourly injections of 1 mg kg-1, i.p.) attenuated the inhibitory action produced by all doses of nicotine on BK- or PAF-induced plasma extravasation, suggesting the contribution of endogenous opioids. 3. RU-38,486 (a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist) (30 mg kg-1, s.c.), and metyrapone (a glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor) (two hourly injections of 100 mg kg-1, i.p.) both attenuated the action of high-dose nicotine without affecting that of low-dose nicotine. 4. Spinal mecamylamine (a nicotinic receptor antagonist) (0.025 mg kg-1, intrathecally, i.t.) attenuated the action of high-dose, but not low-dose, nicotine, suggesting that part of the action of high-dose nicotine is mediated by spinal nicotinic receptors. 5. Combined treatment with ICI-118,551, naloxone and RU-38,486 attenuated the action of low-dose nicotine by an amount similar to that produced by naloxone alone but produced significantly greater attenuation of the effect of high-dose nicotine when compared to the action of any of the three antagonists alone.", 
    "9": "1. The pharmacological features of rat white adipocyte beta-adrenoceptor subtypes were investigated by saturation and beta-agonist competition studies with [3H]-CGP 12177 and by lipolysis induced by beta-agonists as well as their inhibition by CGP 20712A (selective beta 1-antagonist) and ICI 118551 (selective beta 2-antagonist) in an attempt to establish a relationship between the functionality and binding capacity of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. 2. Two populations of binding sites were identified on adipocyte membranes, one with high affinity (0.22 +/- 0.07 nM) and the other with low affinity (23 +/- 7 nM). The low affinity binding sites constituted 90% of the total binding sites. 3. The competition curves, with 15 nM [3H]-CGP 12177, for the beta-agonists, isoprenaline (Iso), noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (Ad), and the selective beta 3-agonist, BRL 37344 (BRL), were clearly biphasic (P < 0.001). The rank orders of agonist potency (pKi) in competing for [3H]-CGP 12177 high affinity and low affinity binding sites, respectively, were Iso (9.28 +/- 0.24) > NA (8.90 +/- 0.12) > Ad (8.65 +/- 0.12) > > BRL (4.53 +/- 0.17) and BRL (7.38 +/- 0.19) > > Iso (2.96 +/- 0.26) > or = NA (2.80 +/- 0.17) > Ad (2.10 +/- 0.11) indicating the expression of beta 1- and beta 3-adrenoceptor subtypes on rat white adipocytes, respectively. Inversely, competition studies with the selective beta 1-agonist, xamoterol (Xam), provided evidence for a single homogeneous population of binding sites with low density (81 +/- 9 fmol mg-1) and high pKi value (7.23 +/- 0.26) confirming the presence of beta 1-adrenoceptors. 4. To assess a possible contribution of the beta 2-subtype, procaterol (Proc), a selective beta 2-agonist, was used to compete with 2 nM [3H]-CGP 12177. A single low affinity (4.61 +/- 0.07) population of binding sites was identified. The density of these sites (71 +/- 12 fmol mg-1) was similar to the one obtained with Xam, suggesting that Proc displaced [3H]-CGP 12177 from the beta 1-subtype. 5. The functional potency (pD2) order with BRL (9.07 +/- 0.20) and catecholamines (Iso: 7.26 +/- 0.06, NA: 6.89 +/- 0.02 and Ad: 6.32 +/- 0.07) was the same as that found for the low affinity binding sites in competition studies. Xam induced lipolysis with greater potency than dobutamine (Dob), 6.31 +/- 0.06 and 5.66 +/- 0.10, respectively. Proc stimulated lipolysis with a low potency (5.59 +/- 0.21). 6. The lipolytic response to 0.001 microM BRL was inhibited by both, selective beta 1- and beta 2-antagonist, in a monophasic manner with low potencies (CGP 20712A pKi: < 4.5 and ICI 118551 pKi: 5.57 +/- 0.13). Similar monophasic profiles were obtained for inhibition of Xam- and Dob-induced lipolysis. In this case, CGP 20712A was more potent (> 10 times) than ICI 118551. The monophasic inhibition was also observed with ICI 118551 in the presence of 0.05 microM Iso or 0.13 microM NA. In contrast, two populations of sites were identified with CGP 20712A in the presence of Iso as well as NA. The pKi values for the first sites were 8.41 +/- 0.09 and 8.58 +/- 0.17, respectively, and for the second population of sites 4.73 +/- 0.22 and 4.27 +/- 0.27, respectively. The proportion of the first sites was low: 19 +/- 4 and 22 +/- 5%, respectively. Biphasic curves were obtained with both antagonists using 2.5 microM Proc (CGP 20712A: pKi1: 8.17 +/- 0.08, site1: 23 +/- 6%, pKi2: 4.77 +/- 0.14; ICI 118551: pKi1: 7.78 +/- 0.03, site1: 37 +/- 2%, pKi2: 5.35 +/- 0.25). 7. Our results show that the radioligand [3H]-CGP 12177 allows the characterization of beta 1- and beta 3-adrenoceptor subtypes on rat white adipocytes. Lipolysis is highly dependent on beta 1- and beta 3-adrenoceptors. Finally, binding and functional studies confirm that lipolysis is mainly driven by the beta 3-subtype.", 
    "10": "1. Chronic treatment of patients with beta-blockers causes atrial inotropic hyperresponsiveness through beta 2-adrenoceptors, 5-HT4 receptors and H2-receptors but apparently not through beta 1-adrenoceptors despite data claiming an increased beta 1-adrenoceptor density from homogenate binding studies. We have addressed the question of beta 1-adrenoceptor sensitivity by determining the inotropic potency and intrinsic activity of the beta 1-adrenoceptor selective partial agonist (-)-RO363 and by carrying out both homogenate binding and quantitative beta-adrenoceptor autoradiography in atria obtained from patients treated or not treated with beta-blockers. In the course of the experiments it became apparent that (-)-RO363 also may cause agonistic effects through the third atrial beta-adrenoceptor. To assess whether (-)-RO363 also caused agonistic effects through beta 3-adrenoceptors we studied its relaxant effects in rat colon and guinea-pig ileum, as well as receptor binding and adenylyl cyclase stimulation of chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human beta 3-adrenoceptors. 2. beta-Adrenoceptors were labelled with (-)-[125I]-cyanopindolol. The density of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors was unchanged in the 2 groups, as assessed with both quantitative receptor autoradiography and homogenate binding. The affinities of (-)-RO363 for beta 1-adrenoceptors (pKi = 8.0-7.7) and beta 2-adrenoceptors (pKi = 6.1-5.8) were not significantly different in the two groups. 3. (-)-RO363 increased atrial force with a pEC50 of 8.2 (beta-blocker treated) and 8.0 (non-beta-blocker treated) and intrinsic activity with respect to (-)-isoprenaline of 0.80 (beta-blocker treated) and 0.54 (non-beta-blocker treated) (P < 0.001) and with respect to Ca2+ (7 mM) of 0.65 (beta-blocker treated) and 0.45 (non-beta-blocker treated) (P < 0.01). The effects of (-)-RO363 were resistant to antagonism by the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551 (50 nM). The effects of 0.3-10 nM (-)-RO363 were antagonized by 3-10 nM of the beta 1-adrenoceptor selective antagonist CGP 20712A. The effects of 20-1000 nM (-)-RO363 were partially resistant to antagonism by 30-300 nM CGP 20712A. 4. (-)-RO363 relaxed the rat colon, partially precontracted by 30 mM KCl, with an intrinsic activity of 0.97 compared to (-)-isoprenaline. The concentration-effect curve to (-)-RO363 revealed 2 components, one antagonized by (-)-propranolol (200 nM) with pEC50 = 8.5 and fraction 0.66, the other resistant to (-)-propranolol (200 nM) with pEC50 = 5.6 and fraction 0.34 of maximal relaxation. 5. (-)-RO363 relaxed the longitudinal muscle of guinea-pig ileum, precontracted by 0.5 microM histamine, with intrinsic activity of 1.0 compared to (-)-isoprenaline and through 2 components, one antagonized by (-)-propranolol (200 nM) with pEC50 = 8.7 and fraction 0.67, the other resistant to (-)-propranolol with pEC50 = 4.9 and fraction 0.33 of maximal relaxation. 6. (-)-RO363 stimulated the adenylyl cyclase of CHO cells expressing human beta 3-adrenoceptors with pEC50 = 5.5 and intrinsic activity 0.74 with respect to (-)-isoprenaline (pEC50 = 5.9). (-)-RO363 competed for binding with [125I]-cyanopindolol at human beta 3-adrenoceptors transfected into CHO cells with pKi = 4.5. (-)-Isoprenaline (pKi = 5.2) and (-)-CGP 12177A (pKi = 6.1) also competed for binding at human beta 3-adrenoceptors. 7. We conclude that under conditions used in this study, (-)-RO363 is a potent partial agonist for human beta 1- and beta 3-adrenoceptors and appears also to activate the third human atrial beta-adrenoceptor. (-)-RO363 relaxes mammalian gut through both beta 1- and beta 3-adrenoceptors. (-)-RO363, used as a beta 1-adrenoceptor selective tool, confirms previous findings with (-)-noradrenaline that beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated atrial effects are only slightly enhanced by chronic treatment of patients with beta-blockers.

    "11": "1. The aims of the present experiments were to define a new experimental model of pulmonary hypertension induced by a post-capillary mechanism and to assess the haemodynamic effects of nitric oxide on post-capillary pulmonary hypertension. 2. Cardiopulmonary variables of 28 male beagle dogs, anaesthetized with chloralose, 16 spontaneous breathing and 12 with assisted ventilation, were studied before and after sino-aortic denervation (SAD). The haemodynamic effects of inhaled nitric oxide (25 p.p.m., 10 min). N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (20 mg kg-1, i.v.), urapidil (0.5 mg kg-1-, i.v.) and propranolol (300 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) were studied after SAD. 3. SAD induced an acute and transient pulmonary hypertension, more marked in spontaneous breathing dogs. This pulmonary hypertension involved a post-capillary mechanism, secondary to the left ventricular haemodynamic effects of the acute increase of left ventricular after-load induced by systemic hypertension. In fact, the increase of mean pulmonary arterial pressure after SAD and the decrease of this parameter after urapidil or propranolol were strongly correlated with the variations of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Furthermore, no significant change in pulmonary vascular resistance was found after SAD or administration of alpha or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. 4. Inhaled nitric oxide did not reverse pulmonary hypertension induced by SAD. N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester had no significant haemodynamic effect of pulmonary circulation. 5. In conclusion, the lack of effect of inhaled nitric oxide and nitric synthase inhibitor on pulmonary circulation parameters SAD suggest that endothelium-derived oxide is not involved in the mechanisms leading to post-capillary pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "12": "Carvedilol (0.25-25 microM), an antihypertensive drug is shown here to reduce endothelin-1 (ET-1) production in cultured human umbilical cord endothelial cells. Two of its metabolites, M14 and M21 (2.5-25 microM) also suppressed ET-1 production, less potently, however, than carvedilol. Carvedilol is a multiple-acting compound with non-selective beta-adrenoceptor and selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity, calcium channel blocking and anti-oxidant activity. To study whether these activities were related to suppressed ET-1 production, endothelial cells were treated with a beta 1-blocker, metoprolol (1-10 microM), a non-selective beta-blocker, propanolol (1-10 microM), an alpha 1-blocker, prazosin (1-10 microM), a calcium channel antagonist, nicardipine (1-10 microM), or with the antioxidative compounds probucol (1-100 microM) and ascorbic acid (1-100 microM). None of these compounds modified ET-1 production. The inhibitory effects of carvedilol, M14 or M21 on ET-1 production were not reversed by N Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (1.9 mM), or by indomethacin (1.5 microM), suggesting that mechanisms other than the stimulation of nitric oxide or prostacyclin production were involved.",

    "24": "This article considers the dominant role of trials involving thousands of patients--the mega-trials--in cardiovascular disease. Problems with large trials mean that alternative strategies must be developed to aid the introduction of new drugs. The limitations of meta-analysis, and of trials with combined and surrogate endpoints are discussed. Properly organized trials designed to establish whether or not two treatments have an equivalent effect seem to offer the best alternative to mega-trials.", 
    "25": "The report of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society's Consensus Conference on the diagnosis and management of heart failure was published in 1994. Focusing on the chronic medical treatment of patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction, we summarize and update the consensus recommendations in the light of the results of several more recent studies. While the positive treatment recommendations are still fully valid or even reinforced by these new data, a somewhat more liberal use of beta-blockers, amiodarone, and newer calcium channel blockers seems justified.", 
    "26": "Most patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) are subjected to symptomatic treatment, predominantly with drugs. Over the years, it has become clear that treatment with unloading drugs is probably more beneficial than treatment with inotropic agents. In addition, it has been widely recognized that the neuroendocrine compensatory changes associated with CHF afford and important target for drug treatment. This may also hold for some of the changes in receptor density, such as the downregulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors. The present and clearly changing insights into the backgrounds of drugs for the treatment of CHF are critically discussed. Apart from the changing views and appreciation of the currently used drugs (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, digoxin, beta-adrenoceptor agonists), the following new approaches are discussed: beta-blockers, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, ibopamine, calcium antagonists, inhibitors of ANP degradation, vasopression antagonist, vesnarinone, and calcium sensitizers.", 
    "27": "Clinical research in chronic heart failure has recently focused on the stimulated neuro-hormonal compensatory mechanisms that could contribute to auto-aggravation of the disease. On the basis of such a hypothesis, and apart from the inhibition of the renin angiotensin system, the antagonism of beta-receptors has evolved as a promising approach for improving quality of life and prognosis. However, the definite proof of beta-adrenoceptor blockade induced benefit on survival remains to be demonstrated. On the basis of CIBIS I data, the objective of the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II (CIBIS II) is to evaluate effects of the selective beta-1 adrenoceptor blocker, bisoprolol, on mortality (primary endpoint) in patients with ischaemic or non-ischaemic chronic heart failure. Eligible patients will be symptomatic ambulatory patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 35% in NYHA functional class III or IV, receiving a background treatment of diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. A total of 2,500 patients are planned to be included with a mean follow up of at least 3 years. Secondary endpoints include hospitalisations, cardiovascular mortality and combination of both as well as permanent treatment withdrawal. Bisoprolol will be titrated up to 10 mg, starting with 1.25 mg daily. Randomization began in November 1995. CIBIS II results will represent a basis for definite conclusions on the evaluation of beta-adrenoceptor blockade induced benefit with bisoprolol in chronic heart failure.", 
    "28": "Ion concentrations in whole blood, plasma, and erythrocytes from arterialized venous blood were examined in eight healthy males performing incremental exercise tests to fatigue on an electrically braked cycle ergometer. Exercise was performed during control and low dose (LD) and high dose (HD) of propranolol (beta-blockade). The LD and HD resulted in a significant decrease in peak heart rate compared with control, while peak oxygen uptake during HD was significantly less than either control or LD. Plasma potassium concentration ([K+]) increased significantly during exercise for control, LD, and HD, while LD and HD plasma [K+] were both significantly greater than control. Erythrocyte [K+] increased significantly for control to 119.2 +/- 1.3 mmol/L, for LD to 116.9 +/- 2.0 mmol/L, and for HD to 117.7 +/- 1.2 mmol/L. Plasma lactate concentration ([Lac-]) increased significantly during exercise for control, LD, and HD. Erythrocyte [Lac-] increased significantly for control to 6.4 +/- 0.8 mmol/L, for LD to 6.4 +/- 0.6 mmol/L, and for HD to 5.0 +/- 0.5 mmol/L, with HD [Lac-] less than either control or LD. beta-Blockade did not significantly alter the percent change in mean corpuscular volume (% delta MCV) during exercise. The results indicate that incremental exercise produces an increase in erythrocyte [Lac-] and [K+]. Although beta-blockade increased plasma [K+] at peak exercise, there was no alteration in erythrocyte [K+] response. The treatment did not impair the ability of the erythrocyte to maintain MCV.", 
    "29": "We investigated the effects of alpha-adrenergic on the capacity of Toxoplasma gondii to invade and proliferate in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Pretreatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with alpha 2-adrenergic led to a high degree of intracellular killing of T. gondii in these cells. Moreover alpha 2-adrenergics activated HUVEC, induced a marked and dose-dependent toxoplasmastatic activity, whereas a pretreatment of HUVEC with alpha 1-adrenergics had no antiparasitic effects. These data suggested that antitoxoplasmal effects could involve alpha 2-adrenoreceptors. This hypothesis is supported by the abolishment of the antitoxoplasma capacities by yohimbine (an alpha 2 adreno-receptor blocker) but not by prazosin (which binds alpha 1-adrenergic receptors). Because it has been reported recently that reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) are essential for the inhibition of T. gondii in macrophages, we investigated whether these molecules are also involved in the alpha 2-adrenergic- dependent induction of toxoplasmastatic activity. We observed, from the incubation of HUVEC with analogs of arginine (e.g. NG-monomethyl-L-arginine) or arginase that deplete arginine, that a good correlation was found between toxoplasmastatic activity and release of NO2- during the activation phase before infection with T. gondii. No correlation was found between NO2-production during the whole infection phase of the HUVEC and toxoplasmastatic activity. These results raise the interesting possibility that alpha 2 and beta-adrenergics agonists, which naturally occur in body fluids, may regulate the transplacental transmission of T. gondii from mother to foetus.", 
    "30": "The optic nerve head in severely myopic eyes may be particularly vulnerable to glaucomatous damage. To study this hypothesis, we examined 122 primary open-angle glaucoma eyes with fair to good control of the intraocular pressure and a sign of baseline optic nerve damage. Then, parameters for the progression of the visual field defects were evaluated by multivariate analysis. A high mean intraocular pressure (p = 0.007) and a large refractive error (p = 0.023) were significant risk factors for subsequent visual field loss. A high baseline cup-to-disk ratio (p = 0.100) was a marginal risk factor. Nonsignificant parameters included patient age (p = 0.692), the use of beta-adrenergic antagonists (p = 0.384), gender (p = 0.831) and left versus right side (p = 0.977). When the refractive error was used to subclassify patients into severely myopic (< or = -4 dpt), mildly myopic (-0.25 to -4 dpt), or emmetropic and hyperopic (> or = 0 dpt), only severe myopia was a significant risk factor for progressive visual field loss. Severe myopia, but not mild myopia, is a significant risk factor for subsequent visual field loss in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma.", 
    "31": "Treatment by a beta 1-beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist has been much used during pathological pregnancies. These agents can reduce the oxygen consumption of the myocardium, increase the coronary blood flow towards ischemic heart areas and improve return of venous blood flow towards the heart. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of action of this agent and to investigate whether a total beta-adrenoceptor antagonist could reduce the fetoplacental disorders elicited in streptozotocin-diabetic pregnant rats. Diabetes was engendered on day 7.5 of pregnancy, and the animals were studied on day 21. Untreated nondiabetic rats or nondiabetic rats treated with propranolol, a total beta-adrenoceptor blocker (2 mg kg-1/ day, i.p.), had a healthy placenta without vascular disturbances, with normal arterial blood velocity in the uterine artery, placenta, umbilical cord and fetal aorta, and showed eutrophic fetuses (3.9 +/- 0.0 g, mean +/- SEM). Untreated diabetic rats had severe placental lesions, with a reduction of arterial blood velocity in the uterine artery (p < 0.01), placenta (p < 0.01) and umbilical artery (p < 0.05), and exhibited fetal hypotrophy (2.3 +/- 0.1 g, mean +/- SEM, p < 0.001) compared with nondiabetic untreated rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with propranolol (2 mg kg-1/day, i.p.) enhanced fetal weight (3.66 +/- 0.2 g) and slightly increased fetal insulin secretion, restored arterial blood velocity to control values in the uterine artery and fetal aorta and reduced placental lesions. In conclusion, our results suggest that the beneficial effects of propranolol were at least in part related to an improvement of uteroplacental hemodynamics; it induced a better redistribution of the blood towards the placenta and the fetal systemic circulation. Propranolol treatment could protect cell membranes against free oxygen radicals and lipid peroxidation, involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic injury in diabetes.",

Erythromelalgia in adults most commonly appears secondary to myeloproliferative disorders, essential thrombocytosis and polycythemia vera; however, in children primary forms predominate. Erythromelalgia in children is characterised by a chronic relapsing course, usually refractory to treatment. We describe a case of erythromelalgia which developed in a 4.5 year old girl following influenza vaccination. Low dose aspirin, carbamazepine and propranolol induced a rapid resolution of the syndrome.",

It was found that the addition of piracetam and tocopherol acetate to conventional antianginal drug therapy brings higher response and exercise tolerance, contributes to more effective hemodynamic and energetic support of the exercise, to positive changes in the central and peripheral hemodynamics.", 
    "34": "Cardiac beta-adrenoceptors are assumed to play a key role in chronic heart failure. Although several radioligands labeled with 11C or 18F have been synthesized for imaging purposes with positron emission tomography (PET), so far no optimal ligands are available to image cardiac beta-adrenoceptors using single photon emission tomography (SPECT). In the present study, we characterized four new synthesized analogues of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist 4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazol-2-one (CGP12177) and one analogue of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist penbutolol. Using classical in vitro displacement studies with left ventricular tissue of New Zealand White rabbits and [125I]iodocyanopindolol as a radioligand, binding affinity to the receptor was determined. From the four analogues, only (2'S,2\"E)- [4-(3'-(1\",1\"-dimethyl-3\"-Iodo-2\" propenylamino)-2'-hydroxypropoxy)]-benzimidazol-2-one proved to have a high affinity, with Ki = 1.25 +/- 0.09 nM, n = 3. The other analogues showed relatively low affinity, with Ki-values > 1 nM. The analogue of penbutolol ((S)-(-)-[1-(2-Iodophenoxy)]-3'-(tert-butylamino)-2'-propanol) also showed a Ki value of 0.64 +/- 0.26 nM, n = 3. Subsequently, (2'S,2\"E)-[4-(3'-(1\",1\"-dimethyl-3\"-Iodo-2\" propenylamino)-2'-hydroxypropoxy)]-benzimidazol-2-one and (S)-(-)-[1-(2-Iodophenoxy)]-3'-(tert-butylamino)-2'-propanol were radioactively labeled with 123I to study their biodistribution in New Zealand White rabbits and to determine specific binding. Significant uptake was observed in both lungs and left ventricles. However, both compounds showed high nonspecific binding in vivo because uptake of the radioligand could not be inhibited by preinjection of different (selective- and nonselective-adrenoceptor antagonists and hydrophilic and lipophilic antagonists) antagonists. In conclusion, although two analogues showed reasonable affinity in vitro for the receptor, their binding in vivo proved to be largely nonspecific, suggesting that these two compounds are unsuitable for imaging purposes. However, because marked differences in affinity for the receptor were observed with only little structural changes between compounds, the present results offer future perspectives for the synthesis of a more specific radioligand.",

One ligand, (S)-(-)-[1-(2-iodophenoxy)]-3'-(tert-butylamino)-2'-propanol (CYBL3), is based on the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist penbutolol. The other ligands are N-iodovinyl and N-iodoaryl analogues of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP12177. These have been synthesized from 2-amino-3-nitrophenol. Furthermore, radioiodinated [123I]CYBL3 and [123I](2'S,2\"E)-[4-(3'-(1\",1\"-dimethyl-3\"-iodo-2\" propenylamino)-2'-hydroxy propoxy)]-benzimidazol-2-one have been prepared by radiolabelling the corresponding trialkyltin precursors using [123I]-NaI in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.", 
    "36": "To investigate current drug therapy for elderly hypertensive patients, we performed a case-card study at Sapporo Medical University and its branch hospitals. The case-card was designed to show prescriptions given for hypertension, complications, and blood pressure. In the 2897 valid cases, calcium antagonists were prescribed in 76.3%, followed by beta-blockers (31.4%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) (25.1%) and natriuretic diuretics (18.1%). When the patients were divided into an elderly group (> or = 65 y.o., n = 1475), beta-blockers and ACE-I were found to be more frequently used in the non-elderly group, and diuretics were more frequently prescribed in the elderly group. Calcium antagonists were the most frequently used drugs, irrespective of age. As monotherapy drugs, calcium antagonists were chosen most frequently in both groups. Diuretics were the second most frequently used drug in the elderly group, but beta-blockers occupied that position in the younger group and these patients as a whole. In the elderly group, the manner of prescription was analyzed according to major complications. In patients with ischemic heart disease, beta-blockers and diuretics were used more frequently than in patients without that condition. Diuretics were prescribed more frequently in patients with renal dysfunction. Calcium antagonists and ACE-I were used more frequently in the patients with diabetes mellitus. The same differences were found in the non-elderly patients with those complications. However, among patients with stroke, calcium antagonists were more frequently used in the elderly group and ACE-I were performed in the younger patients. In conclusion, calcium antagonists were used very often regardless of age, and the other drugs were used according to age-dependent differences in pathophysiologic mechanism.",

    "45": "The non-selective beta-blocker bopindolol, which was developed as a pro-drug, possessed 50-60 times more potent long-acting hypotensive effects on the blood pressure than those of atenolol or propranolol. Because this drug has only a mild partial agonist activity, it did not cause the rapid decrease in heart rate observed with atenolol or propranolol or the increase in heart rate induced by pindolol. These hypotensive effects are due to beta 1-antagonistic effects, not effects on beta 2- or beta 3-adrenoceptors. In addition to these effects, benefits of this drug include the following: slow dissociation rate from beta-adrenoceptors in tissues, high affinity to 5-HT1A subtypes, less clinical effects on lipid metabolism and the inhibition of renin release. It is possible that this drug possesses different pharmacological characteristics from other beta-blockers.", 
    "46": "The effects of carvedilol, a vasodilating beta-blocker with antioxidant activity, and nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, were investigated on aortic lipid deposition and the accumulation of monocytes and foam cells at the sites of atherosclerotic lesions in rats subjected to a hypercholesterolemic diet. Fifty rats were randomly assigned to the following experimental groups: (1) regular rat chow (n = 5); (2) regular rat chow supplemented with a high-cholesterol diet (1% cholesterol and 1% cholic acid; n = 15); (3) a high-cholesterol diet plus nifedipine (n = 15), and (4) a high-cholesterol diet plus carvedilol (n = 15). Animals were maintained on these diets for 12 weeks. None of the treatment groups had blood pressures that were outside the normotensive range, and no significant differences in plasma lipid levels were observed among the high-cholesterol diet and drug-treated groups. There was a significantly lower lipid content (p < 0.001) in the thoracic aortas of the nifedipine-treated (211 +/- 23 nmol/mm2) and carvedilol-treated (182 +/- 23 nmol/mm2) groups compared to cholesterol-fed controls (242 +/- 27 nmol/mm2). Furthermore, carvedilol-treated animals showed significantly less (p < 0.001) lipid accumulation than did the nifedipine-treated animals. The number of monocytes and foam cells were decreased in both drug-treated groups compared to animals receiving high-cholesterol diets without drug treatment. The results demonstrate that treatment with carvedilol or nifedipine can significantly inhibit lipid deposition in the aorta and reduce monocyte and foam cell accumulation, and that carvedilol is significantly more effective than nifedipine in inhibiting lipid deposition.", 
    "47": "Glaucoma is a serious disease that may cause a decrease in peripheral vision as well as blindness. Although the treatment of extreme levels of high intraocular pressure (p > 35 mm) reduces the risk of glaucoma it is not known if the treatment of mild and moderate intraocular pressure prevents the onset of glaucoma. A bibliographic search in Medline CD-ROM was performed from 1967 to 1995, as well as in SIGLE CD-ROM. The keywords used were 'glaucoma prevention' and 'glaucoma suspects'. After the search 18 papers which treated moderate and mild intraocular pressure were selected. Of all these papers, those that used the same methodology; randomization and timolol as treatment, were chosen. The possibility of publication bias was controlled by plotting effect size vs. number of papers, as well as effect size vs. year of publication. A meta-analysis using two methods, weighted zetas and adding zetas, was performed. The combined effect size was -6.25%, and the weighted effect size was -6.45%. We computed the pooled z by two methods: adding Zs and adding weighted Zs. The Z obtained by adding Zs has a value of 2.31120 p = 0.0177, one tail). Using the method of adding weighted Zs we obtained a value of 2.4201 (p = 0.0082, one tail). Our results show that the treatment with timolol of patients with mild and moderate intraocular pressure may help to prevent the onset of glaucoma.",

Complete cure was achieved in all pretoxic patients and in 60 (77.9%) patients with toxic adenoma, while partial cure was observed in 7 cases (9.1%) and failure in 10 (13%). PEI treatment proved similarly effective in toxic patients with a single nodule or with multinodular goitre (87 vs 88.2%, respectively). At the end of treatment, a significant shrinkage of nodule volume was observed in all patients (P = 0.0001). Toxic patients with pretreatment volume > 40 ml (n = 8) did not show a significant difference in treatment response rate as compared to those with volume < 40 ml. Recurrence of hyperthyroidism was never observed during follow-up, independently of thyroid status before treatment. Only one patient with significant thyroid autoantibody serum levels before PEI treatment, developed sub-clinical hypothyroidism at 3 years. The administration of methimazole and/or propranolol did not modify PEI outcome.", 
    "53": "Our data confirm the efficacy and safety of percutaneous ethanol injection for the therapy of autonomous thyroid nodules. The very low incidence of hypothyroidism along with the absence of recurrence of hyperthyroidism suggests that percutaneous ethanol injection is the treatment of choice in patients with pretoxic thyroid adenoma. Percutaneous ethanol injection appears an effective alternative procedure in toxic patients with a high surgical risk even if they have large nodules, and in younger ones in whom radioiodine is contraindicated. Patients may be submitted to anti-thyroid drug and/or beta-blocker therapy if it is necessary, but this does not affect percutaneous ethanol injection treatment outcome. Finally, not only single autonomous thyroid nodules but also toxic multinodular goitre may be successfully treated by percutaneous ethanol injection.",

Anaesthesia comprised fentanyl, propofol infusion and nitrous oxide in oxygen. Neuromuscular block was monitored by measuring the force of contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle in response to train-of-four (TOF) stimulation.

    "56": "A partial beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) agonist will exhibit opposite agonist and antagonist activity depending on the prevailing degree of adrenergic tone or the presence of a beta-AR agonist with higher intrinsic activity. In vivo partial beta-AR agonist activity will be evident at rest with low endogenous adrenergic tone, as for example with chronotropicity (beta 1/beta 2), inotropicity (beta 1) or peripheral vasodilatation and finger tremor (beta 2). beta-AR blocking drugs which have partial agonist activity may exhibit a better therapeutic profile when used for hypertension because of maintained cardiac output without increased systemic vascular resistance, along with an improved lipid profile. In the presence of raised endogenous adrenergic tone such as exercise or an exogenous full agonist, beta-AR subtype antagonist activity will become evident in terms of effects on exercise induced heart rate (beta 1) and potassium (beta 2) responses. Reduction of exercise heart rate will occur to a lesser degree in the case of a beta-adrenoceptor blocker with partial beta 1-AR agonist activity compared with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker devoid of partial agonist activity. This may result in reduced therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of angina on effort when using beta-AR blocking drugs with partial beta 1-AR agonist activity. Effects on exercise hyperkalaemia are determined by the balance between beta 2-AR partial agonist activity and endogenous adrenergic activity. For predominantly beta 2-AR agonist such as salmeterol and salbutamol, potentiation of exercise hyperkalaemia occurs. For predominantly beta 2-AR antagonists such as carteolol, either potentiation or attenuation of exercise hyperkalaemia occurs at low and high doses respectively. beta 2-AR partial agonist activity may also be expressed as antagonism in the presence of an exogenous full agonist, as for example attenuation of fenoterol induced responses by salmeterol. Studies are required to investigate whether this phenomenon is relevant in the setting of acute severe asthma.",

The recovery of beta AR density after down-regulation was not altered by any of the antisense ODNs tested.

Response rates (normalization of DBP or a reduction in DBP by > 10 mmHg) with each active treatment were 72% for sustained-release verapamil/trandolapril, 76% for atenolol/chlorthalidone and 69% for lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide. All three active treatments were tolerated well.", 
    "67": "This study demonstrates that the low-dose combination sustained-release verapamil/trandolapril may be a suitable alternative for combinations containing a thiazide diuretic or a beta-blocker for longer term management of hypertensive patients for whom combination therapy is indicated.", 
    "68": "The aims of the present study were to determine (1) the beta 1-blocking potency and (2) the beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity of nebivolol in man after repeated dosing (7 days) compared with that after a single oral intake and with that after atenolol for 7 days. In addition, it was investigated whether (3) nebivolol has alpha 1-blocking properties which might at least in part explain the vasodilating property of the compound.", 
    "69": "Twelve healthy subjects were randomized in an open, two-way cross-over study. beta 1-Blocking potency and beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity of nebivolol 5 mg once daily (o.d.) were compared with those of atenolol at three doses (25, 50 and 100 mg) o.d. Measurements were performed after 1 and 7 days of drug intake. beta 1-Adrenoceptor potency was assessed by the percentage decrease in exercise-induced tachycardia (delta EIT) during beta-blockade. beta 1-Selectivity of nebivolol and atenolol were investigated using the heart rate response to isoprenaline at equipotent beta 1-blocking dosages of both drugs. alpha 1-Blockade of nebivolol was measured using the phenylephrine dose-response test.", 
    "70": "delta EIT after a single oral dose of nebivolol 5 mg (10%) was significantly smaller than after nebivolol 5 mg o.d. for 7 days (15%). After 1 week of treatment no difference was seen in delta EIT between nebivolol 5 mg o.d. and atenolol 25 mg o.d. (16%). At these dosages the suppression in isoprenaline-induced tachycardia by both drugs did not differ (CD20 ratio 1.7). In contrast to atenolol 25 mg, after 1 week of nebivolol 5 mg o.d., blood pressure decreased. This decrease averaged 10% and-like in a study with hypertensive patients-was similar with that after atenolol 100 mg o.d. None of the phenylephrine test parameters changed from pre-study values after nebivolol.", 
    "71": "beta 1-Blockade of nebivolol 5 mg is larger after repeated dosing than after a single oral intake. After once daily repeated dosing nebivolol 5 mg and atenolol 25 mg are equipotent in beta 1-antagonism. No difference in beta 1-selectivity is observed between the two drugs. Nebivolol has no additional alpha 1-blocking property, which may at least in part explain its vasodilating effect.", 
    "72": "About one hundred European cardiologists discussed the role of calcium antagonists in the follow-up management of myocardial infarction. beta-blockers are the treatment of choice. Where these are contra-indicated or otherwise unsuitable, many clinicians would use a non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist alone or in combination with an ACE inhibitor. There is broad agreement that calcium antagonists should not be used in patients with concomitant left ventricular failure. Cholesterol estimation in post-infarction patients is essential.", 
    "73": "Some 100 European cardiologists discussed calcium antagonists' role in the management of stable angina. Sixty-two percent of those involved used calcium antagonists rather than beta-blockers as first line therapy; 46% were prepared to use calcium antagonists in patients who had had a myocardial infarction more than 6 months previously. Only one tenth would use calcium antagonists in angina patients with left ventricular dysfunction. There was a broad preference for the use of heart rate-moderating calcium antagonists in most forms of stable angina. The discussions also underlined the diagnostic importance of angiography, exercise testing and lipid profile analysis.", 
    "74": "Calcium antagonists have multiple mechanisms whereby they are able to protect against myocardial ischaemia. Recently questions have been posed about the long-term safety of this group of agents. This article is a selective rather than a complete review of the problems. Fears have largely centred around rapidly acting nifedipine when inappropriately used. This agent remains useful in Prinzmetal's angina, a condition in which there are no long-term comparative outcome studies. Current evidence is that verapamil is as safe and as effective as the beta-blocker in effort angina and that non-dihydropyridines (verapamil and diltiazem) are efficacious in the follow up of non-Q wave infarct. Verapamil post-infarct is safe and reduces reinfarction, provided that clinical heart failure is first excluded.", 
    "75": "This study examined the effects of ophthalmic timolol and time of administration on cardiovascular and respiratory functions in healthy young male volunteers. Eight participants (mean age +/- standard deviation, 22 +/- 0.9 years) received either 50 microL of 0.5% timolol or placebo in the lower conjunctival sacs of both eyes in the morning or evening. Intraocular pressure, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory functions, including percent forced expiratory volume in 1 second and peak expiratory flow rate, were then measured for 3 hours after drug administration. Timolol reduced intraocular pressure and cardiovascular function at both administration times. However, a timolol-induced reduction in respiratory function was observed only in the evening: percent forced expiratory volume in 1 second, peak expiratory flow rate, and expiratory flow rate at 75% vital capacity were reduced by 3%, 7%, and 12%, respectively, 3 hours after administration. These results indicate that ophthalmic timolol reduces cardiovascular and respiratory functions in healthy young male subjects and that bronchial sensitivity to timolol differs between morning and evening.", 
    "76": "Statistics regarding long-term survival for patients with heart failure are discouraging today. Converting enzyme inhibitors have produced a modest effect on mortality. beta-Blockers may be the next addition to standard therapy for heart failure because they generate consistent improvements in hemodynamic factors, symptom scores, and submaximal exercise tolerance in randomized, controlled clinical trials. They augment ejection fraction, reduce heart volume, and consistently lower neurohormonal activation as reflected by plasma norepinephrine levels. Trials with carvedilol and bisoprolol suggest an effect on mortality similar to that with converting enzyme inhibitor trials. Future studies, especially the beta-blocker Evaluation Survival Trial (BEST), with mortality as the main end point should elucidate the degree of effect on mortality further.", 
    "77": "Congestive heart failure is a major public health problem in Western countries. Despite current treatment including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, mortality and morbidity remain high. The sympathetic nervous system is markedly activated in heart failure, and inhibition of this system with the beta-adrenergic blocking agents may provide further benefit. Several clinical trials involving over 3,000 patients have shown that beta-blocker therapy improves left ventricular function in patients with heart failure. However, the effects of such therapy on symptoms and exercise tolerance have been variable. Recent reports have suggested that survival is improved with the beta-blocker carvedilol. Large-scale, long-term clinical trials are required to confirm these findings and to clearly define the role of this promising therapy for patients with heart failure.", 
    "78": "Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) radioaerosol is of potential use in the investigation of the neuroadrenergic function of the lungs; however, before the method can be successfully employed the following issues need to be clarified: (1) Does the nebulization affect the radiochemical purity of 123I-MIBG? (2) Is the pulmonary distribution of inhaled 123I-MIBG homogeneous in normal subjects? (3) Does the pulmonary clearance of inhaled 123I-MIBG reflect the functional status of the neuroadrenergic system of the lungs? In this study we performed: (1) a chromatographic study of nebulized 123I-MIBG; (2) a quantitative evaluation of the lung distribution of 123I-MIBG radioaerosol in normal subjects as compared with that of technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) and (3) an assessment of 123I-MIBG lung clearance both under control conditions and after pharmacologically induced beta-blockade, again compared with 99mTc-DTPA. For these purposes, eight normal subjects were divided randomly into an \"MIBG group\" and a \"DTPA group\" (four subjects each) and submitted to three scintigraphic studies each: a baseline study, and studies after the administration of a low (80 mg) and a high (160 mg) dose of propranolol. Radiochemical purity of nebulized 123I-MIBG ranged between 97.18% and 98.70%. The lung distribution of 123I-MIBG, as judged by the aerosol penetration index, was identical to that of 99mTc-DTPA under all study conditions. The 123I-MIBG clearance rate was slower than that of 99mTc-DTPA under baseline conditions (135+/-32 min vs 69+/-27 min, P<0.01) and increased significantly after propranolol administrations, while the 99mTc-DTPA clearance did not change. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) the nebulization does not affect the radiochemical purity of 123I-MIBG; (2) the lung distribution of 123I-MIBG is homogeneous in normal subjects; (3) the pulmonary clearance of 123I-MIBG reflects the functional status of the neuroadrenergic system of the lungs. Thus this scintigraphic method is suitable for research and perhaps for future clinical use.", 
    "79": "In order to relate noradrenaline-dependent potentiation in the dentate gyrus to behavioural events, rats were made to explore an environment in which their encounters with novel stimuli could be strictly controlled and monitored. Previous experiments have shown that an encounter with novel objects in a holeboard elicits a burst response in a large population of noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus. Such a burst response has been demonstrated to produce a large and transient potentiation of the population spike in the dentate gyrus. In the present series of experiments, rats were chronically implanted with stimulating electrodes in the perforant pathway and recording electrodes in the dentate gyrus. Evoked potentials were monitored in the awake rat, first while it was resting quietly in a familiar environment and then while it was exploring the holeboard containing a novel object in a specific hole. There was a tonic increase in population spike amplitude when the rat was placed in the novel holeboard environment, but this effect gradually dissipated. This increase was partly blocked by the beta-noradrenergic antagonist propranolol. In addition there was a robust phasic increase in spike amplitude when the rat encountered a novel stimulus. This phasic response lasted approximately 50-75 s and was absent in animals treated with propranolol. These results show that a behavioural encounter with a novel stimulus can transiently enhance information transmission through the hippocampus, and suggest that activation of the noradrenergic system by the novel stimulus mediates this behavior-dependent gating.", 
    "80": "To evaluate the effect of metoprolol on insulin sensitivity and diurnal plasma hormone levels, seven mildly hypertensive subjects were investigated (four men and three women, age 52 +/- 8, body mass index 25.4 +.- 1.9, mean +/- SD). The study had a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design with 6 weeks' metoprolol treatment (100 mg b.i.d) vs. placebo. At the end of each treatment period 24-h blood samples were collected continuously for diurnal analysis of hormone levels and a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp combined with [3-3H]-D-glucose infusion was performed. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated by means of three different methods: diurnal plasma insulin and glucose levels; glucose consumption; and insulin sensitivity index during euglycaemic clamp conditions. Fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations as well as mean plasma diurnal levels of insulin, growth hormone, testosterone and cortisol were similar after placebo and metoprolol treatment, whereas noradrenaline and adrenaline levels were significantly increased after metoprolol. During the clamp, plasma insulin was significantly higher after metoprolol treatment than after placebo treatment (56 +/- 3 vs. 64 +/- 2 mU L(-1), P < 0.05). Consequently, the insulin sensitivity index [glucose infusion rate (GIR)/ plasma insulin] was lower after metoprolol treatment (16.1 +/- 2.6 vs. 10.2 +/- 1.2, P < 0.05), although GIR was not significantly changed. We suggest that the insulin sensitivity index may not accurately reflect the insulin effect as the plasma level of insulin was significantly increased during insulin infusion but not at 24 h, possibly because of alteration of distribution and/or degradation rate of exogenous insulin. Thus, the likelihood of metoprolol inducing insulin resistance in hypertensive subjects may be less than previously proposed.", 
    "81": "Bradykinin binds to its receptor at target organs and exerts a wide spectrum of biological activities including vasodilation, smooth muscle contraction and relaxation, pain, and inflammation. To gain a better insight into the physiological function of this potent vasoactive peptide, we created transgenic mice that harbor the human bradykinin B2 receptor transgene under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus 3'-LTR promoter (RSV-cHBKR). Expression of HBKR in these transgenic mice was identified in the aorta, brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, uterus, and prostate gland by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction Southern blot analysis. Two transgenic mouse lines expressing the human B2 receptor resulted in a significant reduction of blood pressure (84.2 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, n = 28; 76.9 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, n = 24; P < .001) compared with the control littermates (96.9 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, n = 52). Administration of Hoe 140, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, restored the blood pressure of the transgenic mice to normal levels within 1 hour, and the effect diminished within 4 hours. The transgenic mice displayed enhanced blood pressure-lowering effect induced by a bolus intra-aortic injection of kinin and showed increased response in kinin-induced uterine smooth muscle contractility compared with control littermates. These studies show that overexpression of human bradykinin B2 receptor causes a sustained reduction of blood pressure in transgenic mice. They also suggest that the B2 receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway plays a role in blood pressure regulation.", 
    "82": "Problems with sexual function have been a long-standing concern in the treatment of hypertension and may influence the choice of treatment regimens and decisions to discontinue drugs. The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) provides an excellent opportunity for examination of sexual function and effects of treatment on sexual function in men and women with stage I diastolic hypertension because of the number of drug classes studied, the double-blind study design, and the long-term follow-up. TOMHS was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 902 hypertensive individuals (557 men, 345 women), aged 45 to 69 years, treated with placebo or one of five active drugs (acebutolol, amlodipine maleate, chlorthalidone, doxazosin maleate, or enalapril maleate). All participants received intensive lifestyle counseling regarding weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, alcohol reduction (for current drinkers), and increased physical activity. Sexual function was ascertained by physician interviews at baseline and annually during follow-up. At baseline, 14.4% of men and 4.9% of women reported a problems with sexual function. In men, 12.2% had problems obtaining and/or maintaining an erection; 2.0% of women reported a problem having an orgasm. Erection problems in men at baseline were positively related to age, systolic pressure, and previous antihypertensive drug use. The incidences of erection dysfunction during follow-up in men were 9.5% and 14.7% through 24 and 48 months, respectively, and were related to type of antihypertensive therapy. Participants randomized to chlorthalidone reported a significantly higher incidence of erection problems through 24 months than participants randomized to placebo (17.1% versus 8.1%, P = .025). Incidence rates through 48 months were more similar among treatment groups than at 24 months, with nonsignificant differences between the chlorthalidone and placebo groups. Incidence was lowest in the doxazosin group but was not significantly different from the placebo group. Incidence for acebutolol, amlodipine, and enalapril groups was similar to that in the placebo group. In many cases, erection dysfunction did not require withdrawal of medication. Disappearance of erection problems among men with problems at baseline was common in all groups but greatest in the doxazosin group. Incidence of reported sexual problems in women was low in all treatment groups. In conclusion, long-term incidence of erection problems in treated hypertensive men is relatively low but is higher with chlorthalidone treatment. Effects of erection dysfunction with chlorthalidone appear relatively early and are often tolerable, and new occurrences after 2 years are unlikely. The rate of reported sexual problems in hypertensive women is low and does not appear to differ by type of drug. Similar incidence rates of erection dysfunction in placebo and most active drug groups caution against routine attribution of erection problems to antihypertensive medication.", 
    "83": "The risk of torsades de pointes in patients on sotalol is increased in the setting of renal failure. QT dispersion and prolonged QT intervals have been described as markers for pro-arrhythmia. Four cases of torsades de pointes caused by low dose sotalol in patients with renal failure are reported. All four cases demonstrated that the 12-lead electrocardiogram, with markedly prolonged QT intervals and increased QT dispersion, could have been used to predict pro-arrhythmia.", 
    "84": "We applied system identification to the analysis of fluctuations in heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure (ABP), and instantaneous lung volume (ILV) to characterize quantitatively the physiological mechanisms responsible for the couplings between these variables. We characterized two autonomically mediated coupling mechanisms [the heart rate baroreflex (HR baroreflex) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (ILV-HR)] and two mechanically mediated coupling mechanisms [the blood pressure wavelet generated with each cardiac contraction (circulatory mechanics) and the direct mechanical effects of respiration on blood pressure (ILV-->ABP)]. We evaluated the method in humans studied in the supine and standing postures under control conditions and under conditions of beta-sympathetic and parasympathetic pharmacological blockades. Combined beta-sympathetic and parasympathetic blockade abolished the autonomically mediated couplings while preserving the mechanically mediated coupling. Selective autonomic blockade and postural changes also altered the couplings in a manner consistent with known physiological mechanisms. System identification is an \"inverse-modeling\" technique that provides a means for creating a closed-loop model of cardiovascular regulation for an individual subject without altering the underlying physiological control mechanisms.",

After the normalization of serum tri-iodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations, one group of patients was randomly assigned to a combined treatment with carbimazole and a TSH suppressive dose of T4 for 12 months, followed by another 12 months of TSH suppressive therapy alone. The other group of patients also received carbimazole for one year, but T4 was only added as indicated to normalize elevated TSH serum concentrations, and patients received no therapy during the second year. By the end of the second year, a relapse of hyperthyroidism had occurred in 43% of the patients with and in 45% of the patients without suppressive T4 treatment. In those patients without a relapse of hyperthyroidism, initial thyroid size significantly (P = 0.01) decreased with time in both treatment groups. However, patients on suppressive T4 treatment tended to have a greater reduction in thyroid volume than patients with normal TSH serum concentrations (P = 0.05). In conclusion, we were unable to detect a preventive effect of exogenous TSH suppression on the recurrence of hyperthyroidism. However, our data suggest that TSH suppressive treatment may have a beneficial effect on thyroid enlargement in Graves' disease.",

To investigate whether beta 2-adrenergic agonists can be used safely if associated with low doses of inhaled steroids, for a short period, without a deterioration of asthma control, we have examined 24 mild asthmatics. In a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 1 week of run-in and run-out period framed 3 weeks of treatment. All patients received inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP 250 micrograms t.i.d.); after 1 week, 12 patients inhaled 400 micrograms of broxaterol and 12 patients received placebo t.i.d. FVC, FEV1, PD20-FEV1 methacholine, morning and evening PEF, and PEF amplitude % mean were measured before, during, and after treatment. No significant changes were noted in patients receiving inhaled broxaterol. There were no differences in symptoms and the use of rescue medication (salbutamol spray).

    "104": "The studies reported in this article provide evidence that several complex mechanisms are involved in the ability of dopexamine HCl (DPX) in preventing ischemia-reperfusion induced organ damage. In a canine model of hemorrhagic shock in which shed-blood was reinfused, DPX prevented deterioration in renal blood flow via an action on beta-2 and DA-1 receptors, whereas its ability to preserve tubular function was essentially due its agonistic effects on DA-1 receptors. In a different experimental model in anesthetized rats, acute generation of oxygen free radicals (OFR) via intravenous administration of Xanthine (X) followed by Xanthine Oxidase (XO) resulted in depression of circulation and death of more than 80% of the animals within the observation period of 120 min. Pretreatment of the rats with DPX significantly enhanced survival rate in a dose dependent manner to about 70%. Neither dobutamine nor prenalterol, which are beta-1 adrenoceptor agonists and like DPX, potent chronotropic and inotropic agents were effective in preventing OFR induced lethal toxicity. In a separate series, a selective DA-1 receptor agonist felodopam had no protective effect and a DA-1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390 failed to antagonize the salutary effects of DPX. In contrast, salbutamol, a selective beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist significantly promoted the survival rate facilitated by DPX and a selective beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI-558,551 significantly attenuated the survival rate. These later studies suggest that unlike in hemorrhagic shock, the beta-2 adrenoceptor agonistic properties are critical in the ability of DPX to attenuate lethal toxicity and these effects could be related to prevention of lipid peroxidation induced by oxygen free radicals.",

The released norepinephrine was estimated from the norepinephrine concentration measured in the post-perfusion solution using HPLC. 3. The dose-response curve for dopamine to stimulate the heart rate (HR) closely resembled that for the norepinephrine release. A selective beta 1 antagonist bisoprolol completely abolished the positive chronotropic effect, but did not affect the norepinephrine release. 4. The HR increase in response to 3 mumol/L dopamine was 54 +/- 15% (n = 14) of the control in normal hearts. The response was decreased to 15 +/- 7% (n = 6) by pretreatment with reserpine. 5. A D1 antagonist, SKF83742, (3 mumol/L) shifted the dose-response curve for the dopamine-induced norepinephrine release toward the right, indicating the involvement of D1-like dopamine receptors. 6. Voltage clamp experiments using single cells isolated from the right atrium revealed that dopamine is a weak partial agonist for beta adrenoceptors. Dopamine stimulated the L-type Ca2+ current with a threshold concentration of 3 mumol/L. 7.

    "117": "Positively charged cyclic peptides (three to seven amino acids) have been tested for their inhibitory effects on Na+/Ca2+ exchange in the cardiac sarcolemma vesicles. The lead structure of Phe-Arg-Cys-Arg-Cys-Phe-CONH2 (FRCRCFa) has been systematically modified for identification of important pharmacophores. In cyclic peptides (intramolecular S-S bond, the carboxyl terminal is locked with amide (CONH2), and positive charge is retained by one or two arginines, ornithines, or lysines. Thirty-five different cyclic peptides show IC50 values in the range of 2-800 microM, suggesting that some specific structure-activity relationships may determine the inhibitory effects. Shortening of the FRCRCFa length to four amino acids decreases the inhibitory potency by 10-80-fold. The substitution of Arg2 or Arg4 in FRCRCFa with lysine or ornithine decreases the inhibitory potency by 5-12-fold, suggesting that both arginines are beneficial for inhibition. The substitution of Phe1 in FRCRCFa by 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid produces a potent inhibitor (IC50 = 2-4 microM). The N-myristoylated FRCRCFa exhibits an inhibitory potency (IC50 = 8-10 microM) similar to that of the parent FRCRCFa peptide, thereby arousing a new possibility for the development of a cell-permeable blocker of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, D-Arg4 or D-Cys5 substitutions in FRCRCFa do not alter the inhibitory effect, whereas the L-to-D substitutions of other amino acids in FRCRCFa reduce the inhibitory potency by 4-5-fold. Thus, the L-to-D substitutions of Arg4 and/or Cys5 have a potential to increase the peptide stability to proteolytic degradation. The insertion of proline outside of the ring of FRCRCFa diminishes the inhibitory potency by 3-6-fold, whereas proline introduction into the ring decreases the inhibitory potency by 16-20-fold. The replacement of Cys3 and Cys5 in FRCRCFa with beta, beta-dimethylcystein has no significant effect on the inhibitory potency, suggesting that the S-S bond is not exposed to the interface of the peptide/receptor interaction. In conclusion, the current data support a proposal that the conformationally constrained Arg-Cys-Arg-Cys structure is obligatory for inhibition of Na+/Ca2+ exchange, whereas hydrophobic additions at the carboxyl and amino ends have limited effects in increasing the inhibitory potency.", 
    "118": "Enantiospecific acetyl conjugation was examined in the rat liver 105000 x g supernatant (cytosol) system using racemic 1-amino-3-(1-naphthyloxy)-2-propanol (NDP), a N-desisopropyl metabolite of propranolol. From the results of chiral separative determination of the samples by HPLC using a Chiralcel OD-R column, more remarkable enantiospecificity was observed in the R(+)-enantiomer on NDP elimination and N-acetyl conjugate (AcNDP) formation. Next, the strength of beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic actions and mutagenicities was compared between R(+)- and S(-)-enantiomers of NDP and AcNDP, respectively. In the case of NDP, both enantiomers possessed weak beta1-adrenoceptor antagonistic effects on isoproterenol-induced positive inotropic and chronotropic actions in the left and right atria isolated from a guinea pig. These actions of R(+)- and S(-)-NDP were 1700-times and 100-times less potent, respectively, than those of propranolol. beta2-Adrenoceptor antagonistic actions of R(+)- and S(-)-NDP in the trachea were 1600-times and 200-times less potent, respectively, than those of propranolol. Enantiospecificity was observed in the beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic action of S(-)-NDP, while R(+)-NDP and both enantiomers of AcNDP appeared to be negligible in this action. On the other hand, the mutagenicities of each enantiomer were examined by the Ames method using 13 kinds of Salmonella typhimurium strains. In the case of AcNDP, the numbers of colonies increased according to the substrate concentration only when rat liver 9000 x g supernatant fraction (S-9 mixture) was added to the plates containing TA100, YG1029, TA104 and YG3003, and then enantiospecificity was observed in the mutagenicity of S(-)-AcNDP. Thus, the ultimate mutagen might be an active metabolite formed mainly from S(-)-AcNDP. Despite of the addition of rat liver S-9 mixture, R(+)-AcNDP and both enantiomers of NDP did not indicate mutagenicity.", 
    "119": "The binding and characteristics of rat brain beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) isolated from astrocytes and neurons were investigated. Equilibrium binding experiments demonstrated that beta-AR were more concentrated on astrocytes than on neurons isolated from forebrain, cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Inhibition experiments revealed that beta 1-AR and beta 2-AR were present in the two cell types. Isoproterenol revealed two interchangeable states of high and low affinity binding to both beta 1- and beta 2-AR in neurons. The high affinity binding sites were sensitive to guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp). Similar results were found with other beta-AR agonists but not with salbutamol and salmeterol which recognized both affinity states of the neuronal beta 2-AR but only the low affinity state of beta 1-AR. In astrocytes only the low affinity state of beta-AR was observed.", 
    "120": "The purpose of the present study was to test the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral intervention as an adjunctive treatment of hypertension. To qualify for the study, subjects had to have an unmedicated clinic diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 mm Hg. After qualification, minimal drug requirements were established using a diuretic and a beta-blocker to control blood pressure at < or = 90 mm Hg. Subjects were then randomized into a 6-week cognitive-behavioral intervention or a measurements-only control group. After the treatment phase, medication levels were reduced in all subjects by means of a systematic stepdown procedure. Subjects were followed for 1 year after the stepdown was completed. Addition of the cognitive-behavioral intervention was twice as effective as the control procedure in reducing drug requirements. At 12-months follow-up, 73% of the treatment group were at lower levels of medication than at the time of randomization, compared to 35% in the control group. Moreover, 55% of the treatment group remained completely free of medication, compared to 30% of the control group, at the 12-month follow-up. The reductions in medication were associated with maintained controlled levels of clinic, ambulatory, and home blood pressure. The addition of a standardized and inexpensive group-administered cognitive-behavioral intervention to the drug treatment of hypertension is beneficial as an adjunctive treatment in reducing drug requirements for patients with hypertension, thereby reducing the costs and potential side effects of antihypertensive medications.", 
    "121": "In isolated hearts the inotropic response to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol is known to be abolished after ischaemia and reperfusion. The aim of this study was to investigate whether at decreased glucose levels the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in vascular smooth muscle would be depressed, since low glucose conditions mimic the influence of ischaemia. Accordingly, we investigated the influence of low glucose levels in the extracellular space on the vasorelaxation induced by isoproterenol and salbutamol in rat isolated thoracic aortic ring preparations with an intact endothelium and we attempted to further analyze the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, forskolin, dibutyryl-cAMP and glibenclamide (an ATP-sensitive K(+)-channel blocker) were studied as well. In a glucose-free medium the concentration-response curve for isoproterenol was shifted to the left compared to that obtained under normal glucose conditions. The maximal relaxation induced by isoproterenol was not affected by the absence of glucose. In contrast, the maximal relaxation induced by salbutamol in glucose-free medium decreased by 50% compared to that obtained under normal glucose conditions. Glibenclamide caused a concentration-dependent decrease of the maximum relaxation by isoproterenol in a glucose-free medium, but had no effect under normal glucose conditions. Glibenclamide did not influence the concentration-response curves for salbutamol, neither in the presence nor in the absence of glucose in the medium. The relaxation caused by forskolin and dibutyryl-cAMP was not influenced by glibenclamide in a medium devoid of glucose. In endothelium-denuded preparations glibenclamide did not affect isoproterenol-induced responses neither in the presence nor in the absence of glucose. It is concluded that beta-adrenoceptor stimulation opens ATP-sensitive potassium channels under conditions of impaired ATP-metabolism by a cAMP-independent pathway, which needs an intact endothelium.", 
    "122": "In guinea-pig isolated papillary muscles we studied the positive inotropic effects of the beta-adrenoceptor agonists isoprenaline, fenoterol and noradrenaline in the presence and absence of the beta 1-selective antagonist atenolol and the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118.551. In Schild regression analysis pA2 values, for either atenolol (7.14-7.16) and ICI 118.551 (6.79-6.84) were independent of the agonists used. These results support the view that the inotropic response in guinea-pig ventricular myocardium is mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors only.", 
    "123": "Binding sites for 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)[3H]tropane ([3H]WIN 35,428) on rat striatal membranes were alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and the protective potency was measured of the blockers cocaine, N[1-(2-benzo[b]thiophenyl) cyclohexyl]piperidine (BTCP), benztropine, WIN 35,428; and nomifensine, and of the substrates dopamine, norepinephrine, S(+)-amphetamine, tyramine, and metaraminol. In general, the protective potency was lower (at least 3 times) than the potency in inhibiting [3H]WIN 35,428 binding with the compounds present under the same experimental conditions used for the NEM-induced alkylation. However, the disparity was substantially greater for all substrates tested (10- to 93-fold) than for the blockers (2- to 6-fold), especially cocaine and BTCP (3-fold). [3H]WIN 35,428 binding was best described by a l-site model under the present conditions. The results are discussed in terms of models involving blocker-induced conformational changes and overlapping nonidentical binding domains for blockers and substrates.", 
    "124": "Although prophylactic treatment with beta-blockers is used to retard aortic root dilatation in Marfan syndrome, it is not effective in all patients. To assess the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on the aorta's elastic properties, aortic stiffness index and distensibility were calculated in 13 patients with Marfan syndrome and 10 control subjects before and after beta-adrenergic blockade. At baseline, patients with Marfan syndrome had a significantly increased stiffness index and decreased distensibility. After beta-adrenergic blockade, 8 patients with Marfan syndrome developed stiffness indexes and distensibility values that were closer to normal, whereas these variables deteriorated in 5 patients. Thus the benefit of beta-adrenergic blockade in Marfan syndrome may be the reduction in pulse pressure and myocardial contractility and also promotion of the elastic properties of the aorta. Moreover, the differential responses of aortic mechanics (normalizing or worsening) to beta-adrenergic blockade may possibly have implications for the prognosis in these patients.", 
    "125": "In isolated rat cardiomyocytes, exogenous lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (15 microM) increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration (Ca2+]i) from 72 +/- 5 to 3042 +/- 431 nM accompanied by cell injury as indicated by the hypercontracture of the cells and the increase in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) release. In order to understand whether the cell injury induced by LPC was a consequence of the elevation of [Ca2+]i, the effect of LPC was examined in the Ca2+-free solution containing EGTA. Under the Ca2+ -free conditions, LPC did not increase [Ca2+]i, whereas it still inflicted injury on the cells in terms of cell-shape change and CPK release to the same degree as that under the Ca2+-present condition. Addition of ryanodine (10 microM) failed to prevent the changes in cell-shape and CPK release induced by LPC under both Ca2+-free and Ca2+-present conditions. Preincubation of the myocytes with d-propranolol (50 microM) inhibited the LPC-induced changes in cell-shape and CPK release under both Ca2+ -free and Ca2+ -present conditions (p < 0.05). Our study provides clear evidence that the cellular injury induced by LPC could be independent of the increase in [Ca2+]i, and the Ca2+-independent cellular injury induced by LPC could be attenuated by d-propranolol, although the mechanism remains unknown.", 
    "126": "Mature cardiomyocytes have been shown to possess a cyclic AMP-mediated chloride channel (I(Cl)) which is the product of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene. Species variability has been demonstrated for other ion channels. This study was designed to evaluate human I(Cl) regulation using the whole-cell patch-clamp bioassay. Atrial tissue obtained from children undergoing congenital heart surgery was enzymatically dispersed into isolated myocytes. The patients ranged in age from 1 day to 11 years (mean 2 years). Isoproterenol was used to activate the cAMP second-messenger system in a potassium-free environment. Membrane calcium and sodium channels were pharmacologically blocked. Of 20 human atrial myocytes obtained from 13 pediatric patients, 80% had a small basal chloride current. The current could be inhibited by the anion transport blocker, 9-anthracene carboxylic acid. In 4 of 20 otherwise viable myocytes, no I(Cl) could be elicited, either at baseline or with beta-adrenergic stimulation. Of the 16 myocytes with a basal I(Cl), the current was unaffected by cAMP stimulation in 15 (94%) cells. There were no significant differences in age, gender or clinical status of patients whose cells conducted Cl- current compared with patients whose myocytes had no measurable I(Cl). Ten mature guinea pig ventricular myocytes were evaluated using the same whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Seven of 10 cells showed a reversible increase in I(Cl) with isoproterenol exposure. Despite presence of the CFTR gene in human cardiomyocytes, functional expression of the cAMP-activated I(Cl) does not appear evident in isolated pediatric atrial myocytes. Whether the pathophysiology of congenital heart disease may influence chloride current modulation via alterations in adrenergic tone, intracellular Ca2+ regulation, and cellular osmotic conditions remains to be established.",

Although glucagon has been used in no clinical trial in this setting, its cardiac activity may prove useful, particularly in the setting of beta-adrenergic blockade. We report a case series comprising three patients taking maintenance beta-blocker therapy who presented to the ED with symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension and in whom glucagon therapy obviated the need for further treatment. Further study is warranted to evaluate and define the role of glucagon in the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia.",

Sustained VT was induced in all patients at baseline study, and induction was reattempted during drug therapy. Monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) and ventricular effective refractory period (ERP) were recorded with use of a contact electrode.",

    "133": "The present study was undertaken to characterize the mechanisms of the hemodynamic responses to microinjection of the selective mu-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, in conscious rats chronically instrumented with pulsed Doppler flow probes. We found that i.v. pretreatment with phentolamine had no effect on the tachycardia elicited by DAMGO (1 nmol); however, the pressor response was reversed to a state of hypotension, the renal and superior mesenteric vasoconstrictions were attenuated and the hindquarter vasodilation was potentiated. In the presence of propranolol, the pressor response and renal vasoconstriction were unchanged, whereas the superior mesenteric vasoconstriction was reduced and the hindquarter vasodilation was abolished. Moreover, in those animals we observed bradycardia followed by tachycardia. Combined i.v. pretreatment with phentolamine and propranolol abolished the pressor and heart rate responses to DAMGO but had no effect on the renal and superior mesenteric vasoconstrictions, although the hindquarter vasodilation was reduced. Intravenous pretreatment with a vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist or captopril had no effect on the cardiovascular responses to DAMGO. Together, these results indicate that the hypertension observed after injection of DAMGO into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus was secondary to alpha adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictions in renal and superior mesenteric vascular beds and to beta adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation in the hindquarter vascular bed, whereas the involvement of circulating vasopressin or angiotensin seems less obvious from the present findings. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that nonadrenergic, nonvasopressinergic and nonangiotensinergic vasoconstrictor mechanisms were acting in the renal and superior mesenteric vascular beds.", 
    "134": "Activation of beta-2 adrenoceptors (BAR) in smooth muscle preparations is associated with a rapid, reversible and incomplete receptor desensitization, resulting in a steady-state relaxation response to BAR agonists. Based on results from cell culture studies, we hypothesize that, in the isolated guinea pig trachea, this steady state is a result of a concurrent resensitization of desensitizing BAR. In tracheal segments maintained at mechanical tone (4-6 g), isoproterenol (ISO) and the partial BAR agonist salbutamol (SALB) elicited a monotonic, rapid (1-3 min) and reproducible relaxation response that could be maintained for up to 45 min and was completely reversed by propranolol. Similarly, tissues preconstricted with 0.1 microM carbachol (CARB) responded with a sustained relaxation response to ISO. In contrast, in tissues preconstricted with 0.3 to 10 microM CARB or with 75 mM KCl, the relaxation elicited by ISO was followed by a slow (20-30 min) and partial restoration of muscle tone (\"fade\"). The relaxation and fade were observed when CARB-constricted tissues were relaxed with SALB (0.2 or 10 microM) or 10 microM salmeterol. No response to SALB was observed when tissues were preconstricted with KCl. The fade met criteria for its classification as a homologous desensitization of the relaxation response at the BAR level. In desensitized washed tissues, a complete recovery of the original relaxation response could be detected within 60 min of drug removal. A propranolol- and ICI 118-551-sensitive steady state was achieved 30 to 35 min after the addition of BAR agonists to the isolated tissues. A three-compartment phenomenological kinetic model accurately described the observed data, defining one steady-state and three rate constants, describing relaxation (k1), desensitization (k2) and resensitization (k3). The values of k2 and k3 for the response to SALB and to salmeterol were significantly larger than those observed for ISO. In the presence of KCl, the values of k2 and k3 for the response to ISO were indistinguishable from those measured in the presence of CARB. Given the parameters defined by our model, we propose that desensitization and resensitization of BAR in the isolated guinea pig trachea are distinct concurrent processes whose net result actively maintains a sustained partial relaxation response to ISO, SALB or salmeterol. The component of resensitization in the presence of agonist may account for the clinical efficacy of inhaled BAR agonists.", 
    "135": "Selective inhibitors of the low-Km cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE4) inhibit inflammatory cell function and relax airway smooth muscle. Thus PDE4 inhibitors may be useful in the therapy of asthma. The present study was conducted to determine whether the in vivo activity of rolipram, a prototypical PDE4 inhibitor, is due to its ability to potentiate the anti-inflammatory effects of prostaglandins or catecholamines, endogenous activators of adenylyl cyclase, in models of the early- and late-phase response to antigen. Rolipram, administered i.v. to anesthetized, paralyzed and ventilated ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs, inhibited i.v. antigen-induced bronchoconstriction with an ID50 value of 0.2 mg/kg. Pretreatment with either of the beta adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol and nadolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v.), enhanced the bronchial reactivity to antigen and abolished the inhibitory activity of rolipram (0.1-10 mg/kg i.v.). In addition, the inhibitory activity of three structurally dissimilar PDE4 inhibitors was nearly abolished by propranolol. Cyclooxygenase inhibition by indomethacin slightly enhanced the reactivity to antigen but did not affect the inhibitory activity of rolipram. Plasma catecholamine concentrations were not altered by rolipram (0.3 or 1 mg/kg i.v.), which indicates that there was no stimulation of catecholamine release. Bilateral adrenalectomy reduced plasma epinephrine concentrations (from 1700 pg/ml to 400 pg/ml), significantly enhanced airway reactivity to antigen and substantially reduced the inhibitory activity of rolipram (3 mg/kg i.v.). Pretreatment of conscious guinea pigs with the beta adrenoceptor antagonist nadolol, 2 mg/kg p.o., enhanced aerosol antigen-induced bronchoconstriction and pulmonary eosinophil influx measured by bronchoalveolar lavage. Nadolol reduced the inhibitory effect of rolipram against antigen-induced bronchoconstriction but not eosinophil influx. The inhibitory effect of rolipram was unaffected by indomethacin. The present data suggest that circulating catecholamines play an important protective role against antigen-induced broncho-constriction in the guinea pig. Moreover, the inhibitory activity of PDE4 inhibitors against antigen-induced bronchoconstriction, but not eosinophil influx, is reduced by beta adrenergic blockade or adrenalectomy. Thus the inhibitory activity of PDE4 inhibitors against antigen-induced bronchoconstriction may be related to their synergism with endogenous catecholamines to suppress mast cell degranulation.", 
    "136": "Free Ca2+ near Ca2+ channel pores is expected to be lower in cardiomyocytes dialyzed with bis-(o-amino-phenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) than with ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) because BAPTA chelates incoming Ca2+ more rapidly. The consequences of intracellular Ca2+ buffering by BAPTA (0.2-60 mM) and by EGTA (0.2-67 mM) on whole-cell L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L) were investigated in voltage-clamped guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocytes; bulk cytoplasmic free Ca2+ (Cac2+) was monitored using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator indo-1. ICa,L was augmented by approximately 12-fold when BAPTA in the cell dialysate was increased from 0.2 to 50 mM (half-maximal stimulation at 31 mM), whereas elevating internal EGTA from 0.2 to 67 mM increased ICa,L only by approximately 2-fold. Cac2+ was < 20 nM with internal BAPTA or EGTA > or = 20 mM. While EGTA up to 67 mM had only an insignificant inhibitory effect on the stimulation of ICa,L by 3 microM forskolin, ICa,L in 50 mM BAPTA-dialyzed myocytes was insensitive to forskolin-induced elevation of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP); conversely, ICa,L in cAMP-loaded cells was unresponsive to BAPTA dialysis. Cell dialysis with BAPTA, but not with EGTA, accelerated the slow component of ICa,L inactivation (tau S) without affecting its fast component (tau F), resembling the effects of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. BAPTA-stimulated ICa,L was inhibited by acetylcholine and by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) blocker H-89. These results suggest that BAPTA-induced lowering of peri-channel Ca2+ stimulates cAMP synthesis and channel phosphorylation by disinhibiting Ca(2+)-sensitive adenylyl cyclase.", 
    "137": "Several lines of biochemical and pharmacological evidence provide support for the involvement of the noradrenergic system in the expression of the somatic symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Early studies reported changes in brain noradrenaline and metabolite levels during opiate dependence. The significance of these changes has been clarified in recent microdialysis studies indicating that acute morphine decreases the extraneuronal levels of noradrenaline, whereas an increase in release of the neurotransmitter occurs during opiate withdrawal in several brain areas. Changes in the sensitivity and density of alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors have also been reported, probably as a consequence of the decreased presynaptic noradrenergic activity induced during morphine dependence. In addition, the administration of alpha 2-agonists, such as clonidine, or beta-antagonists, such as propranolol, has been reported to attenuate some manifestations of opiate withdrawal. The noradrenergic structure mediating the expression of opioid abstinence seems to be the locus coeruleus. However, the activation of the locus coeruleus during morphine withdrawal seems to be primarily due to the afferent projections containing excitatory amino acids and derived from the nucleus paragigantocellularis, although intrinsic modifications, consisting of an up-regulation of the cAMP pathway, seem also to be involved in this activation. The participation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system in opiate dependence and its relation with the changes produced in the noradrenergic system are also discussed.", 
    "138": "The effects of 28 days of a very low calorie diet (382 Cal/day)) on the beta-adrenergic lipolytic response and nutritive blood flow in sc adipose tissue were investigated in vivo using the microdialysis technique in 24 obese subjects. The diet did not modify the extracellular glycerol concentrations, but increased the local nutritive blood flow (measured by the ethanol escape method). The lipolytic response and the vasodilating effect of increasing concentrations of isoprenaline (from 0.001-10 mumol/L) added to the perfusate were enhanced after 28 days of diet. Before the diet, equimolar concentrations (100 mumol/L) of dobutamine [selective beta 1-adrenoceptor (beta 1-AR) agonist], terbutaline (selective beta 2-AR agonist), and CGP 12,177 (selective beta 3-AR agonist) increased glycerol concentration in adipose tissue. The lipolytic effect of terbutaline was the greatest, and the effect of CGP 12,177 was the least marked. After 28 days of the diet, the effects of terbutaline and CGP 12,177 were not modified, whereas the effect of dobutamine was increased and reached the effect of terbutaline. The three agonists increased nutritive blood flow; this effect was not modified during the diet. In summary, this study demonstrates an increase in the in vivo lipolytic responses to isoprenaline and dobutamine during the hypocaloric diet. Furthermore, functional beta 3-AR are present in the sc adipose tissue of obese patients; however, their activation is only weakly involved in the lipolytic process in this population and is not modified by the hypocaloric diet.", 
    "139": "In two preliminary studies, pindolol produced robust results in hastening clinical response to antidepressant drugs in depressed patients. Validity of those pilot studies was limited by use of an open-label, unblinded study design, and so the authors conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of pindolol in hastening response to fluoxetine.", 
    "140": "Drug-free outpatients with major depression were concurrently treated with fluoxetine (20 mg/day) and either placebo or pindolol (5.0 mg b.i.d. or 2.5 mg t.i.d.), for 6 weeks, in a randomized, double-blind manner. After 6 weeks, all patients received fluoxetine and placebo and were followed for 3 further weeks in a single-blind manner.", 
    "141": "Forty-three patients completed at least 1 week of the protocol. Rates of partial remission after 2 weeks of treatment with fluoxetine and either pindolol or placebo were 17% (four of 23 patients) and 20% (four of 20 patients), respectively. At study completion, 65% of the patients (N = 28) demonstrated at least a partial remission, and there was no difference between treatment groups. The pindolol group, but not the placebo group, demonstrated significant reductions in blood pressure and pulse rate. The average time to remission and the rates of attrition, overall response, and side effects were similar in the two groups.", 
    "142": "These findings do not support the efficacy of pindolol in hastening clinical response in patients treated with fluoxetine.", 
    "143": "This case report illustrates a rare familial cardiomyopathy first reported in the medical literature in 1982 known as right ventricular dysplasia (right ventricular cardiomyopathy). The patient is a young woman with a history of cardiac arrhythmias suspected to be associated with prolapsed mitral valve who presented to the Berks Country Coroner's office as a sudden unexpected death in a young adult. It is important to recognize the illustrated classic cardiac pathology of this rare entity for clinical management, as an anatomic explanation of cause of sudden death and for the accumulation of statistics to establish frequency, conditions of predisposition, response to therapy and predicted outcome.", 
    "144": "To study the catecholamine-releasing effect of peripheral intravenous administration of the nonionic contrast medium iohexol in patients with pheochromocytomas.", 
    "145": "Ten patients (eight women, two men; mean age, 44 years; age range, 25-70 years) with pheochromocytomas and related tumors and six healthy volunteers (five men, one woman; mean age, 31 years; age range, 27-35 years) were examined. Plasma catecholamine levels were measured at intervals for 60 minutes after the injection of 0.9% saline or iohexol on 2 separate days. All 10 patients intravenously received the specific alpha-adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg in 250 mL of 5% dextrose infused over 2 hours) 24 hours before iohexol-enhanced computed tomography.", 
    "146": "There was no statistically significant increase in epinephrine or norepinephrine levels in the patients or the control subjects.", 
    "147": "While it may be prudent to administer oral alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in all patients with a biochemically proved pheochromocytoma to control their symptoms and to prevent a spontaneous adrenergic crisis, specific blockade may not be required before contrast medium-enhanced scanning with iohexol. Although the sample size of this study is relatively small, the results do suggest that in an incidentally detected, clinically silent adrenal mass that may or may not be hypersecreting, the nonionic contrast medium iohexol may be used for scanning without blockade."
