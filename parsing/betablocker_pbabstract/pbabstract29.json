Ventricular arrhythmia event rates were compared among carvedilol dose continuation, reduction and discontinuation groups. To assess dose dependent effects of beta-blocker withdrawal, dose reduction and discontinuation groups were divided into subgroups.", 
    "2": "Dose discontinuation (n=64) or reduction group (n=83) had significantly higher ventricular arrhythmia rates compared with dose continuation group (n=262) (65.6 vs. 33.7 vs. 15.3%, p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Dose discontinuation group also had a significantly higher ventricular arrhythmia event rate compared with dose reduction group (p<0.001). There were no significant differences in ventricular arrhythmia event rates among dose discontinuation or reduction subgroups.",

These patients were split into three mutually exclusive groups of HR \u2264 60 (N=263), HR 61-69 (N=356) and HR \u2265 70 (N=722). Patients with elevated HR had a higher incidence of diabetes and higher diastolic blood pressure on average than those with controlled HR. Regarding the use of \u03b2-blockers, they were used in 63.3% of patients, 2.7% showed intolerance or contraindication to treatment to monitor heart rate, and ivabradine was used in 2.3%.

    "8": "Application of information on regional intestinal permeability has been identified as a key aspect of successful pharmaceutical product development. This study presents the results and evaluation of an approach for the indirect estimation of site-specific in vivo intestinal effective permeability (Peff) in humans. Plasma concentration-time profiles from 15 clinical studies that administered drug solutions to specific intestinal regions were collected and analyzed. The intestinal absorption rate for each drug was acquired by deconvolution, using historical intravenous data as reference, and used with the intestinal surface area and the dose remaining in the lumen to estimate the Peff. Forty-three new Peff values were estimated (15 from the proximal small intestine, 11 from the distal small intestine, and 17 from the large intestine) for 14 active pharmaceutical ingredients representing a wide range of biopharmaceutical properties. A good correlation (r(2) = 0.96, slope = 1.24, intercept = 0.030) was established between these indirect jejunal Peff estimates and jejunal Peff measurements determined directly using the single-pass perfusion double balloon technique. On average, Peff estimates from the distal small intestine and large intestine were 90% and 40%, respectively, of those from the proximal small intestine. These results support the use of the evaluated deconvolution method for indirectly estimating regional intestinal Peff in humans. This study presents the first comprehensive data set of estimated human regional intestinal permeability values for a range of drugs. These biopharmaceutical data can be used to improve the accuracy of gastrointestinal absorption predictions used in drug development decision-making.", 
    "9": "Fructose is a commonly used sweetener associated with diets that increase the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS). Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been consistently demonstrated to reduce MS. However, there has been no direct comparison among different pharmacological modes of inhibiting the RAS concerning their effects on MS. This study investigated the effect of aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, versus telmisartan, an angiotensin II-receptor blocker, in the treatment of fructose-induced MS in rats. MS was induced by high fructose (FRC) diet feeding for 12 weeks. Oral administrations of telmisartan (TEL, 5 mg/kg), aliskiren (ALS, 30 mg/kg) or vehicle were started in the last 4 weeks. Results showed that administration of either TEL or ALS with FRC diet equally ameliorated the metabolic parameters (glucose level, oral glucose tolerance test, insulin resistance and serum lipids profile), systolic blood pressure and oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, reduced glutathione levels and catalase activity). Additionally, the effects of TEL and ALS were associated with a decrease in body composition index and attenuation of liver index, serum liver enzyme activities and hepatic expressions of inflammatory and fibrotic markers (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, nuclear factor kappa-B and transforming growth factor-\u03b2) with a significant increase in hepatic glucose transporter-2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-alpha and gamma expressions. The results suggested that, at indicated dosage, ALS has ameliorative effect equal to that of TEL against FRC-induced metabolic and hepatic disorders; implying that drugs which inhibit the RAS, by different mode of inhibition, profoundly affect fructose-induced MS in rats.",

Adjusted ORs ranged from 2.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-4.2) for ACE inhibitors to 7.3 (95% CI: 4.5-12.1) for PPIs in the year prior to the index date. After accounting for diagnostic delay, only use of NSAIDs, PPIs, low-dose aspirin, and ACE inhibitors increased the risk of MC. Compared with colonoscopy controls, only use of PPIs (OR-adjusted 10.6; 1.8-64.2) and NSAIDs (OR-adjusted 5.6; 1.2-27.0) increased the risk of MC.",

    "18": "1. This study explores the impact of permeability and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux, upon brain exposure to etamicastat, a new dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor and consequently brain levels of catecholamines. 2. Brain exposure to etamicastat (10\u2009mg/kg), following intravenous administration to mice, was residual and upon oral administration of the same dose no compound was detected, concurring with the absence of effects upon brain catecholamines. The intravenous co-administration of elacridar (1.0\u2009mg/kg), a known P-gp/BCRP dual modulator, significantly increased brain etamicastat exposure, but the levels attained were very low when compared to those of nepicastat, a centrally active DBH inhibitor. 3. In vitro permeability studies from apical-to-basal direction conducted in Caco-2 cells and MDCK-II cells showed that etamicastat apparent permeability was 1.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-5) and 1.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-6\u2009)cm/s, respectively, 5- and 50-fold lower as compared to nepicastat. The secretory efflux ratio in MDCK-II cells overexpressing human P-gp showed an efflux ratio greater than 2, for both compounds, which was significantly decreased by elacridar. Despite its lower bioavailability and higher clearance, as compared to nepicastat, etamicastat showed preferential distribution to peripheral tissues and high plasma free fraction (15.5%), which may explain its effects upon peripheral DBH and catecholamine levels. 4. Though P-gp-mediated efflux may contribute to the limited brain penetration of etamicastat, the low permeability along with the pharmacokinetic properties of etamicastat may be perceived as the main contributors for its peripheral selectivity, which is advantageous for a cardiovascular drug candidate.",

However, there is considerable regional variability in emergency physician practice patterns and debate among physicians as to which agent is more effective. To date, only one small prospective, randomized trial has compared the effectiveness of diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control of AFF in the ED and concluded no difference in effectiveness between the two agents.",

    "24": "The number of poorly water-soluble drug candidates is rapidly increasing; this represents a major challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. As a consequence, novel formulation approaches are required. Furthermore, if such a drug candidate is intended for the therapy of a specific group of the population, such as geriatric or pediatric, the formulation challenge is even greater, with the need to produce a dosage form that is acceptable for specific patients. Therefore, the goal of our study was to explore electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers as a novel nanodelivery system adopted for the oromucosal administration of poorly water-soluble drugs. The nanofibers were evaluated in comparison with polymer films loaded with ibuprofen or carvedilol as the model drugs. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the amount of incorporated drug affects the diameter and the morphology of the nanofibers. The average fiber diameter increased with a higher drug loading, whereas the morphology of the nanofibers was noticeably changed in the case of nanofibers with 50% and 60% ibuprofen. The incorporation of drugs into the electrospun PCL nanofibers was observed to reduce their crystallinity. Based on the morphology of the nanofibers and the films, and the differential scanning calorimetry results obtained in this study, it can be assumed that the drugs incorporated into the nanofibers were partially molecularly dispersed in the PCL matrix and partially in the form of dispersed nanocrystals. The incorporation of both model drugs into the PCL nanofibers significantly improved their dissolution rates. The PCL nanofibers released almost 100% of the incorporated ibuprofen in 4h, whereas only up to 77% of the incorporated carvedilol was released during the same time period, indicating the influence of the drug's properties, such as molecular weight and solubility, on its release from the PCL matrix. The obtained results clearly demonstrated the advantages of the new nanodelivery system compared to the drug-loaded polymer films that were used as the reference formulation. As a result, electrospinning was shown to be a very promising nanotechnology-based approach to the formulation of poorly water-soluble drugs in order to enhance their dissolution. In addition, the great potential of the produced drug-loaded PCL nanofiber mats for subsequent formulation as oromucosal drug delivery systems for children and the elderly was confirmed.",

Compared with always users (n=2922, 49.3%), the risk of all-cause death was significantly higher among inconsistent \u03b2-blocker users (hazard ratio [HR], 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-2.57), and never using \u03b2-blockers was associated with increased risk of both all-cause death (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.01-2.00) and the composite of adverse cardiovascular events (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.10-1.50).

In the MI cohort, mortality was higher for inconsistent users (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.43-3.20) and for never users (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.07-2.63). Consistent results were obtained in equivalent sensitivity analyses.",

Metoprolol is a moderately lipophilic \u03b2-blocker that in overdose causes direct myocardial depression leading to bradycardia, hypotension, and the potential for cardiovascular collapse. We describe the case of a 59-year-old man who intentionally ingested ~7.5\u00a0g of metoprolol tartrate. Initial treatment of bradycardia and hypotension included glucagon, atropine, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Despite these treatment modalities, the patient developed cardiac arrest. Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) and hyperinsulinemia/euglycemia (HIE) therapies were initiated during advanced cardiac life support and were immediately followed by return of spontaneous circulation. Further treatment included gastric lavage, activated charcoal, continued vasopressor therapy, and a repeat bolus of ILE. The patient was weaned off vasoactive infusions and was extubated within 24\u00a0hours. HIE therapy was continued for 36\u00a0hours after metoprolol ingestion. A urine \u03b2-blocker panel using mass spectrometry revealed a metoprolol concentration of 120\u00a0ng/ml and the absence of other \u03b2-blocking agents. To date, no clear treatment guidelines are available for \u03b2-blocker overdose, and the response to toxic concentrations is highly variable. In this case of a life-threatening single-agent metoprolol overdose, the patient was successfully treated with HIE and ILE therapy. Due to the increasing frequency with which ILE and HIE are being used for the treatment of \u03b2-blocker overdose, clinicians should be aware of their dosing strategies and indications.",

At admission, she was haemodynamically stable and the physical examination revealed reduced reflexes in the four limbs. Urgent laboratory findings revealed mild hypokalaemia. Considering the high statin doses she was taking, we also performed an urgent creatine phosphokinase test, which indicated rhabdomyolysis. Statin therapy was immediately stopped and aggressive fluid treatment begun, supplemented with potassium for increased urinary potassium losses. The patient progressively regained muscle strength.",

The EAHFE registry was split into two groups: EAHFE-non-RELAX (patients not fulfilling the RELAX-AHF inclusion criteria; n\u00a0=\u00a03205, 58.3\u00a0%) and EAHFE-RELAX A (patients fulfilling RELAX-AHF inclusion criteria; n\u00a0=\u00a02292, 41.7\u00a0%). The latter group was further refined by also applying exclusion criteria (EAHFE-RELAX B; n\u00a0=\u00a0964, 17.4\u00a0%). Both EAHFE-RELAX groups differed from the EAHFE-non-RELAX group in multiple aspects, with the lower the proportion of patients with implantable cardiac defibrillator and with pulmonary diseases the greater the differences found. The RELAX group, compared with the EAHFE-RELAX groups, significantly included fewer females, younger patients, less in NYHA class I/II, less with implantable cardiac defibrillator and on beta-blocker treatment, and patients had lower systolic blood pressure and cardiac and respiratory rates at ED arrival. The EAHFE-RELAX groups had a significantly lower all-cause mortality than EAHFE-non-RELAX group, and qualitative analysis suggested that EAHFE-RELAX groups had a higher mortality than the RELAX group.",

    "33": "Although we recently demonstrated that opening of a native aortic valve (AV) after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation is a sufficient condition to prevent development of aortic insufficiency (AI), its preoperative predictors remain unknown. Data were obtained from 58 patients who had been treated with continuous flow LVAD for \u2265 6 months at our institute between 2006 and 2014. Opening of native AV was accomplished in 21 patients (36%) at postoperative 6 months. Uni/Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that a preoperative lower cumulative dose of \u03b2-blocker was the only independent predictor for postoperative opening of native AV (P = 0.020, OR 0.905) at the cutoff level of 4.5g (equivalent dose of carvedilol), calculated by an ROC analysis. Prevalence of native AV opening was increased gradually along with improvement of LV ejection fraction only in patients with preoperative insufficient \u03b2-blocker treatment during postoperative 6 months (P < 0.05 for both). Patients with opening of native AV had higher exercise capacity and a lower re-admission rate than those with closed native AV during 2-year LVAD support (5% versus 44%, P < 0.05). Opening of native AV during LVAD support is profoundly associated with LV reverse remodeling especially in patients with insufficient preoperative \u03b2-blocker exposure probably due to their better responsiveness to combination therapy with \u03b2-blocker and LVAD. Patients who accomplished native AV opening can enjoy better exercise performance and avoid re-admission due to cardiovascular events.",

The crystallization rate of GPCRs has accelerated in recent years as techniques have become more sophisticated, particularly with respect to Class A GPCRs interacting with G-proteins. These developments have made it possible for a quantitative analysis of GPCR geometrical features and binding-site conformations, including a statistical comparison between Class A GPCRs in active (agonist-bound) and inactive (antagonist-bound) states.", 
    "35": "Here we implement algorithms for the analysis of interhelical angles, distances, interactions and binding-site volumes in the transmembrane domains of 25 Class A GPCRs (7 active and 18 inactive). Two interhelical angles change in a statistically significant way between average inactive and active states: TM3-TM6 (by -9\u00b0) and TM6-TM7 (by +12\u00b0). A third interhelical angle: TM5-TM6 shows a trend, changing by -9\u00b0. In the transition from inactive to active states, average van der Waals interactions between TM3 and TM7 significantly increase as the average distance between them decreases by >2 \u00c5. Average H-bonding between TM3 and TM6 decreases but is seemingly compensated by an increase in H-bonding between TM5 and TM6. In five Class A GPCRs, crystallized in both active and inactive states, increased H-bonding of agonists to TM6 and TM7, relative to antagonists, is observed. These protein-agonist interactions likely favour a change in the TM6-TM7 angle, which creates a narrowing in the binding pocket of activated receptors and an average ~200 \u00c5(3) reduction in volume.",

Ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) was employed to detect the changes of serum metabolites in normal mice, benign prostatic hyperplasia model mice and BPH model mice with finasteride intervention. The serum metabolite profiles of the three groups of mice were analyzed. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used for group differentiation and biomarker selection. The results showed good distinction among the three groups of mice serum metabolite spectra. Three potential biomarkers, 1-hexadecanoyl-SN-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine and (Z)-13-docosenamide, were discovered and identified. They all indicated the occurrence of benign prostatic hypertrophy is closely related to the disorders of lipid metabolism. Coinpared with the control group, the contents of the first two substances were significantly increased in the serum of BPH model mice, and significantly decreased after intervened by finasteride. The contents of (Z)-13-docosenamide decreased significantly in the serum of model group, and increased after intervened by finasteride. Compared with the control group, the contents of three biomarkers in finasteride group did not recover completely and had significant differences.

Thus, we set out to evaluate the efficacy of OnabotA in a series of patients with CM treated according to the PREEMPT protocol. In May 2012 we began to offer OnabotA to patients with CM who did not respond to topiramate and at least one other preventive therapy (beta blocker and/or calcium channel antagonist). We prospectively recorded demographic data and the characteristics of migraine, and we assessed the modifications in monthly headache and migraine days, as well as the number of days of symptomatic medication and triptan intake. By September 2014 we had treated 52 patients (8 male, 44 female), whose age at treatment onset was 42.8\u2009\u00b1\u200912.7\u00a0years (range: 16-71) and age at migraine onset was 16.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8\u00a0years (3-32). In 43 of these patients (82.7%) symptomatic overuse of medication was observed at the onset of treatment.

Twelve (23.1%) patients failed to perceive a positive effect after the first procedure and it was not repeated in 4 of them. By contrast, there was a significant decreasing in all the variables evaluated compared to the baseline in the 39 patients that received a second series of injections. The use of OnabotA according to the PREEMPT paradigm is an effective treatment in patients with chronic migraine in a real-life setting.",

Mice were assessed with cardiac MRI (ventricular structure and function, in vivo calcium influx (manganese-enhanced MRI)), pressure-volume loops, and histopathology. Combination treatment did not show benefits over treatment with AI or BB alone. Indeed, some beneficial aspects of BB and AI were lost when used in combination.

The study suggests that combined BB and AI may not confer an advantage at an early stage in DMD cardiomyopathy. However, limitations of the mdx model should be considered.", 
    "61": "Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] develops its functions interacting with Mas receptor. Mas receptor was recently identified in the DRG and its activation by Ang-(1-7) resulted in peripheral antinociception against PGE2 hyperalgesia in an opioid-independent pathway. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which Ang-(1-7) induce peripheral antinociception was not yet elucidated. Considering that endogenous noradrenaline could induce antinociceptive effects by activation of the adrenoceptors the aim of this study was verify if the Ang-(1-7) is able to induce peripheral antinociception by interacting with the endogenous noradrenergic system. Hyperalgesia was induced by intraplantar injection of prostaglandin E2 (2\u03bcg). Ang-(1-7) was administered locally into the right hindpaw alone and after either agents, \u03b12-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (5, 10 and 20 \u03bcg/paw), \u03b12C-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine (10, 15 and 20 \u03bcg/paw), \u03b11-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.5, 1 and 2 \u03bcg/paw), \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (150, 300 and 600 ng/paw). Noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor reboxetine (30 \u03bcg/paw) was administered prior to Ang-(1-7) low dose (20 ng) and guanetidine 3 days prior to experiment (30 mg/kg/animal, once a day), depleting NA storage. Intraplantar Ang-(1-7) induced peripheral antinociception against hyperalgesia induced by PGE2. This effect was reversed, in dose dependent manner, by intraplantar injection of yohimbine, rauwolscine, prazosin and propranolol. Reboxetine intensified the antinociceptive effects of low-dose of Ang-(1-7) and guanethidine, which depletes peripheral sympathomimetic amines, reversed almost 70% the Ang-(1-7)-induced peripheral antinociception. Then, this study provides evidence that Ang-(1-7) induce peripheral antinociception stimulating an endogenous noradrenaline release that activates peripheral adrenoceptors inducing antinociception.",

Given that this type of therapy relies on extinction learning principles, neuroscience research has tested different adjuncts that could be used as cognitive enhancers through their impact on extinction learning and its consolidation.

    "63": "Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a genetically determined rare cardiomyopathy (1 in 5000 to 1 in 2000 in the general population), which can lead to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death (SD). The classic form of the disease has a predilection for the right ventricle (RV), but recognition of left-dominant and biventricular variants led to the broader term \"Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy\". The disease affects men more frequently than women and becomes clinically overt usually from the second to the fourth decade of life. Treatment consists of restriction of physical exercise, antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation and ICD implantation. These treatments have the potential to change the natural history of the disease by protecting against SD and offering a good-quality and nearly normal life-expectancy. Antiarrhythmic drugs play an important role in terms of reduction of both the number and the complexity of arrhythmias, but they do not reduce the risk of SD. The results of catheter ablation are poor because of the high rate of VT recurrence. ICD should be reserved to selected patients after an accurate risk stratification. The clinical challenge is to improve risk stratification for better identification of those patients who most benefit from the above therapies. Unfortunately, a curative therapy is not yet available.", 
    "64": "During exercise there is a balance between vasoactive factors that facilitate increases in blood flow and oxygen delivery to the active tissue and the sympathetic nervous system, which acts to limit muscle blood flow for the purpose of blood pressure regulation. Functional sympatholysis describes the ability of contracting skeletal muscle to blunt the stimulus for vasoconstriction, yet the underlying signalling of this response in humans is not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that activation of inwardly rectifying potassium channels and the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, two potential vasodilator pathways within blood vessels, contributes to the ability to blunt \u03b11 -adrenergic vasoconstriction. Our results show preserved blunting of \u03b11 -adrenergic vasconstriction despite blockade of these vasoactive factors. Understanding this complex phenomenon is important as it is impaired in a variety of clinical populations.",

We tested the hypothesis that \u03b11 -adrenergic vasoconstriction is augmented during exercise following inhibition of inwardly rectifying potassium (KIR ) channels and Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase (BaCl2 \u00a0+\u00a0ouabain). In young healthy humans, we measured forearm blood flow (Doppler ultrasound) and calculated forearm vascular conductance (FVC) at rest, during steady-state stimulus conditions (pre-phenylephrine), and after 2\u00a0min of phenylephrine (PE; an \u03b11 -adrenoceptor agonist) infusion via brachial artery catheter in response to two different stimuli: moderate (15% maximal voluntary contraction) rhythmic handgrip exercise or adenosine infusion. In Protocol\u00a01 (n\u00a0=\u00a011 subjects) a total of six trials were performed in three conditions: control (saline), combined enzymatic inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG) synthesis (l-NMMA\u00a0+\u00a0ketorolac) and combined inhibition of NO, PGs, KIR channels and Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase (l-NMMA\u00a0+\u00a0ketorolac\u00a0+\u00a0BaCl2 \u00a0+\u00a0ouabain). In Protocol\u00a02 (n\u00a0=\u00a06) a total of four trials were performed in two conditions: control (saline), and combined KIR channel and Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase inhibition. All trials occurred after local \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol). PE-mediated vasoconstriction was calculated (%\u0394FVC) in each condition. Contrary to our hypothesis, despite attenuated exercise hyperaemia of \u223c30%, inhibition of KIR channels and Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase, combined with inhibition of NO and PGs (Protocol\u00a01) or alone (Protocol\u00a02) did not enhance \u03b11 -mediated vasoconstriction during exercise (Protocol\u00a01: -27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.2\u00a0vs. control, P\u00a0=\u00a00.4\u00a0vs. l-NMMA\u00a0+\u00a0ketorolac; Protocol\u00a02: -21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.9\u00a0vs. control).

    "66": "Genetic analyses have revealed an important association between P/Q-type calcium channel activities and hereditary neurological disorders. The P/Q-type channels are composed principally of heterologous multimeric subunits including CaV2.1 and CaV\u03b24. Of these, the \u03b24 subunit is thought to play a significant role in channel physiology, because a mouse line mutant in that subunit (the lethargic mouse: lh) exhibits a severe ataxic phenotype. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the physiological importance of the \u03b24 subunit. ECG analysis showed that the T wave was high in 8-week-old lh mutants; this may be associated with hyperkalemia. Upon pharmacological ECG analysis, 2-3-week-old lh mutants exhibited reduced responses to a \u03b2-blocker and a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Analysis of heart rate variability revealed that the R-R interval was unstable in lh mutants and that both the low- and high-frequency components had increased in extent, indicating that the tonus of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems was modified. Thus, our present study revealed that the \u03b24 subunit played a significant role in regulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities.", 
    "67": "Impulsive and aggressive behaviors are both modulated by serotonergic signaling, specifically through the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR). 5-HT1BR knockout mice show increased aggression and impulsivity, and 5-HT1BR polymorphisms are associated with aggression and drug addiction in humans. To dissect the mechanisms by which the 5-HT1BR affects these phenotypes, we developed a mouse model to spatially and temporally regulate 5-HT1BR expression. Our results demonstrate that forebrain 5-HT1B heteroreceptors expressed during an early postnatal period contribute to the development of the neural systems underlying adult aggression. However, distinct heteroreceptors acting during adulthood are involved in mediating impulsivity. Correlating with the impulsivity, dopamine in the nucleus accumbens is elevated in the absence of 5-HT1BRs and normalized following adult rescue of the receptor. Overall, these data show that while adolescent expression of 5-HT1BRs influences aggressive behavior, a distinct set of 5-HT1B receptors modulates impulsive behavior during adulthood.",

We tested the hypothesis that the tachycardic effect of hypoxia persists during separate, but not combined, inhibition of \u03b2-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. Nine subjects performed incremental exercise to exhaustion in normoxia and hypoxia (fraction of inspired O2 = 12%) after intravenous administration of 1) no drugs (Cont), 2) propranolol (Prop), 3) glycopyrrolate (Glyc), or 4) Prop + Glyc. HR increased with exercise in all drug conditions (P < 0.001) but was always higher at a given workload in hypoxia than normoxia (P < 0.001). Averaged over all workloads, the difference between hypoxia and normoxia was 19.8 \u00b1 13.8 beats/min during Cont and similar (17.2 \u00b1 7.7 beats/min, P = 0.95) during Prop but smaller (P < 0.001) during Glyc and Prop + Glyc (9.8 \u00b1 9.6 and 8.1 \u00b1 7.6 beats/min, respectively).

Our results demonstrate that the tachycardic effect of hypoxia during exercise partially relies on vagal withdrawal. Conversely, sympathoexcitation either does not contribute or increases heart rate through mechanisms other than \u03b2-adrenergic transmission.

Gradients in beta-blocker sensitivity of helically aligned cardiomyocytes compared with counteracting transversely intruding cardiomyocytes seem crucial. We hypothesize that selective blockade of transversely intruding cardiomyocytes by low-dose beta-blockade unloads ventricular performance. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 3D tagging delivers parameters of myocardial performance. We studied 13 healthy volunteers by MRI 3D tagging during escalated intravenous administration of esmolol. The circumferential, longitudinal, and radial myocardial shortening was determined for each dose. The curves were analyzed for peak value, time-to-peak, upslope, and area-under-the-curve. At low doses, from 5 to 25 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1), peak contraction increased while time-to-peak decreased yielding a steeper upslope. Combining the values revealed a left shift of the curves at low doses compared with baseline without esmolol. At doses of 50 to 150 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1), a right shift with flattening occurred. In healthy volunteers we found more pronounced myocardial shortening at low compared with clinical dosage of beta-blockers.

Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was used as an alternative wetting agent for comparison. The model lenses consisted of a hydrophilic monomer, either 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate or N,N-dimethylacrylamide and a hydrophobic silicone monomer of methacryloxypropyltris (trimethylsiloxy) silane. The loading of the wetting and the therapeutic agent occurred during the synthesis of the silicone hydrogels through the method of direct entrapment. The developed materials were characterized by minimal changes in the water uptake, while lower molecular weight of HA improved their surface wettability. The transparency of the examined silicone hydrogels was found to be affected by the miscibility of the wetting agent in the prepolymer mixture as well as the composition of the developed silicone hydrogels. Sustained release of TM from 4 to 14 days was observed, with the drug transport occurring presumably through the hydrophilic domains of the silicone hydrogels. The release profile was strongly dependent on the hydrophilic monomer composition, the distribution of hydrophobic (silane) domains, and the affinity of the therapeutic agent for the silicone hydrogel matrix. Noncovalent entrapment of the wetting agent did not change the in\u00a0vitro release duration and kinetics of TM, however the drug release profile was found to be controlled by the simultaneous release of TM and HA or PVP. In the case of HA, depending on the HA:drug ratio, the release rate was decreased and controlled by the release of HA, likely due to electrostatic interactions between protonated TM and anionic HA. Overall, partitioning of the drug within the hydrophilic domains of the silicone hydrogels as well as interactions with the wetting agent determined the drug release profile.",

Analysis of the target compounds in the hospital wastewater was performed by means of solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis (HPLC-MS/MS). A screening level risk assessment combining the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) with dose-response data based on Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) was also applied to estimate Hazard Quotients (HQs) for the compounds investigated. Additionally, the environmental hazard associated to the various compounds measured was assessed through the calculation of the Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) Index, which categorizes compounds according to their environmentally damaging characteristics. The results of the study showed the presence of twenty-four out of the twenty-six compounds analysed at individual concentrations ranging from 5 ng L(-1) to 2 mg L(-1). The highest concentrations corresponded to the ICM iomeprol, found at levels between 424 and 2093 \u03bcg L(-1), the analgesic acetaminophen (15-44 \u03bcg L(-1)), the diuretic (DIU) furosemide (6-15 \u03bcg L(-1)), and the antibiotics (ABIs) ofloxacin and trimethoprim (2-5 \u03bcg L(-1)). The lowest levels corresponded to the anti-inflammatory propyphenazone, found at concentrations between 5 and 44 ng L(-1). Differences in terms of concentrations of the analysed compounds have been observed in all the therapeutic groups when comparing the results obtained in this and other recent studies carried out in hospitals with different characteristics from different geographical areas and in different seasons. The screening level risk assessment performed in raw water from the hospital effluent showed that the analgesics and anti-inflammatories (AAFs) acetaminophen, diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen, the antibiotics (ABIs) clarithromycin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim, and the \u03b2-blocker (BBL) propranolol were present at concentrations leading to HQ values higher than 10, thus indicating high risk. When applying a factor to take into account potential dilution and degradation processes, only the compound ibuprofen showed a HQ higher than 1. Likewise, the cumulative HQ or Toxic Units (TUs) calculated in the raw water for each of the therapeutic groups studied showed that these three classes of drugs were at concentrations high enough to potentially generate high risk to aquatic organisms while taking into account possible dilution and degradation processes only one of them, the AAFs can be considered to represent high risk. Finally, the environmental hazard assessment performed showed that the AAFs diclofenac and ibuprofen and the ABI clarithromycin have the highest, maximum value of 9 of PBT Index due to their inherent environmentally damaging characteristics of persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. The methodology followed in the present case study can be taken as a novel approach to classify and categorize pharmaceuticals on the basis of their occurrence in hospital effluents, their derived environmental risks, and their associated environmental hazard. This classification becomes important because it can be used as a model or orientation for hospitals in the process of developing environmentally sustainable policies and as an argument to justify the adoption of advanced, specific treatments for hospital effluents before being discharged into the public sewage system.",

However, modifiable risk factors such as smoking, BP and salt intake also impact on PWV. The finding of modifiable risk factors may lead to the identification of treatable factors, and, thus, is of interest to practicing nephrologist. We have now studied the prevalence and correlates of arterial stiffness, assessed by PWV, in 191 patients from nephrology outpatient clinics in order to identify modifiable risk factors for arterial stiffness that may in the future guide therapeutic decision-making. PWV was above normal levels for age in 85/191 (44.5%) patients. Multivariate analysis showed that advanced age, systolic BP, diabetes mellitus, serum uric acid and calcium polystyrene sulfonate therapy or calcium-containing medication were independent predictors of PWV. A new parameter, Delta above upper limit of normal PWV (Delta PWV) was defined to decrease the weight of age on PWV values. Delta PWV was calculated as (measured PWV) - (upper limit of the age-adjusted PWV values for the general population). Mean\u00b1SD Delta PWV was 0.76\u00b11.60 m/sec. In multivariate analysis, systolic blood pressure, active smoking and calcium polystyrene sulfonate therapy remained independent predictors of higher delta PWV, while age, urinary potassium and beta blocker therapy were independent predictors of lower delta PWV.

Recently, a trial testing a dual inhibitor blocking the angiotensin-II receptor and neprylisin, the enzyme responsible for B-type natriuretic peptide degradation, showed that this complex molecule improved clinical outcomes compared with the ACEI enalapril. However, challenges remain in the management of HF, with suboptimal implementation of guideline-recommended therapies, a changing profile of patients who are older and have multiple comorbidities and a high rate of early rehospitalization for HF. Use of devices such as implantable cardiac defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy are also associated with an improvement in outcomes in this condition. HF with preserved EF (HFpEF), a growing fraction of the HF population, remains a clinical dilemma: no pharmacological intervention has so far demonstrated any convincing benefit on outcome. Heterogeneity of the populations tested, role of comorbidities, difficulties in identifying patients with HFpEF, as well as a mismatch between the clinical phenotypes and the treatments tested, can explain the failure to find beneficial interventions. Overall, the management of HF after discharge remains fragmented and concerted action by all professionals concerned is needed.",

The goal of the study was to investigate whether cerebral tissue oxygenation using near infrared spectroscopy can detect the \u03b2 blocker-induced decrease in cerebral oxygenation depending on the severity of hemodilution and/or the dose of \u03b2 blockers. Animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and randomly assigned to a landiolol or esmolol group. After baseline measurement, landiolol or esmolol was administered at 40 \u00b5g/kg/min for 20 min, increased to 200 \u00b5g/kg/min for 20 min, and then stopped. Hemodynamic and arterial variables and the tissue oxygenation index (TOI) were recorded at each \u03b2 blocker dose. Two stages of hemodilution were sequentially induced by repeated hemorrhage of 600 ml (33% of estimated blood volume) and infusion of the same volume of hydroxyethylstarch. During each stage, landiolol or esmolol was similarly administered and measurements were made. Landiolol and esmolol both dose-dependently decreased heart rate, mean arterial pressure and cardiac output, depending on the severity of hemodilution. Landiolol at 40 \u00b5g/kg/min was almost equivalent in potency to 200 \u00b5g/kg/min esmolol for decreasing HR before hemodilution. Based on the TOI, short-acting \u03b2 blockers reduced cerebral oxygenation in a dose-dependent manner during hemodilution, and oxygenation returned to the baseline level after drug infusion was stopped. TOI may be useful for identification of a decrease in cerebral oxygenation for patients receiving \u03b2 blockade during surgery associated with major bleeding.", 
    "140": "It is well accepted that angiotensin II (Ang II) induces altered vascular stiffness through responses including both structural and material remodeling. Concurrent with remodeling is the induction of the enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX) through which ECM proteins are cross-linked. The study objective was to determine the effect of LOX mediated cross-linking on vascular mechanical properties. Three-month old mice were chronically treated with Ang II with or without the LOX blocker, \u03b2 -aminopropionitrile (BAPN), for 14 days. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) from Doppler measurements of the aortic flow wave was used to quantify in vivo vascular stiffness in terms of an effective Young's modulus. The increase in effective Young's modulus with Ang II administration was abolished with the addition of BAPN, suggesting that the material properties are a major controlling element in vascular stiffness. BAPN inhibited the Ang II induced collagen cross-link formation by 2-fold and PWV by 44% (P<0.05). Consistent with this observation, morphometric analysis showed that BAPN did not affect the Ang II mediated increase in medial thickness but significantly reduced the adventitial thickness. Since the hypertensive state contributes to the measured in vivo PWV stiffness, we removed the Ang II infusion pumps on Day 14 and achieved normal arterial blood pressures. With pump removal we observed a decrease of the PWV in the Ang II group to 25% above that of the control values (P=0.002), with a complete return to control values in the Ang II plus BAPN group. In conclusion, we have shown that the increase in vascular stiffness with 14 day Ang II administration results from a combination of hypertension-induced wall strain, adventitial wall thickening and Ang II mediated LOX ECM cross-linking, which is a major material source of vascular stiffening, and that the increased PWV was significantly inhibited with co-administration of BAPN.", 
    "141": "Essential hypertension (EH) is a widespread disease and might be prevalent in apnea divers and master athletes. Little is known about the influence of EH and the antihypertensive drugs (AHD) on cardiovascular reactions to combined breath hold (BH) and exercise. In this pilot study, healthy divers (HCON) were compared with treated hypertensive divers with regard to heart rate (HR) and mean blood-pressure (MAP) responses to BH, exercise and the combination of both. Ten subjects with EH and ten healthy divers were tested. 3 different 20\u2009s stimuli were applied: BH combined with 30\u2009W or 150\u2009W and 150\u2009W without BH. The time-charts during the stress intervals and during recovery were compared. Subjects treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor showed higher changes for MAP values if breath hold was performed. HR responses were obviously changed if a \u03b2-blocker was part of the medication. One subject showed extreme MAP responses to all stimuli and conspicuous HR if BH was involved. The modulation of HR-/MAP-response in EH subjects depends on the mechanisms of antihypertensive agents. The combination of an ACE inhibitor and a \u03b2-blocker may give the best protection. It is recommended to include short apnea tests in the fitness-to-dive examination to individually predict potential endangerment.",

Scanning for the optimal \u0394\u03bb at which the SFS can be performed in the presence of \u03b2-CD was examined. The results obtained revealed three distinguishable shapes for PPL using SFS that can be represented by three different \u0394\u03bb values, namely 10, 40, and 100 nm. However, the effect of the \u03b2-CD concentration on the fluorescence intensity of PPL was examined using CFS and SFS of PPL at a \u0394\u03bb of 10 and 100 nm. The change in the fluorescence intensity was used to calculate the equilibrium constant (Keq) for the formation of the \u03b2-CD:PPL inclusion complex by applying the Benesi-Hildebrand method. Keq values of 108, 112, and 117 M(-1) were obtained using SFS with a \u0394\u03bb of 10 and 100 nm, and CFS, respectively. Further, the SFS method was successfully employed to examine the iodide quenching effect on the fluorescence intensity of PPL, where the results obtained revealed a Stern-Volmer quenching constant of 42.8 M(-1), which is in good agreement with results obtained using CFS. All results obtained using the SFS method were compared with the results obtained using the CFS method.",

This study was conducted to determine whether initiation of ophthalmic timolol was associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation for bradycardia. Materials and Methods. A self-controlled case-series study was undertaken in patients who were hospitalised for bradycardia and were exposed to timolol. Person-time after timolol initiation was partitioned into risk periods: 1-30 days, 31-180 days, and >180 days. A 30-day risk period prior to initiating timolol was also included. All remaining time was considered unexposed. Results. There were 6,373 patients with at least one hospitalisation for bradycardia during the study period; 267 were exposed to timolol. Risk of bradycardia was significantly increased in the 31-180 days after timolol initiation (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.87). No increased risk was observed in the first 30 days or beyond 180 days of continuous exposure (IRR = 1.40; 95% CI 0.87-2.26 and IRR = 1.21; 95% CI 0.64-2.31, resp.). Conclusion. Bradycardia is a potential adverse event following timolol initiation. Practitioners should consider patient history before choosing a glaucoma regime and closely monitor patients after treatment initiation with topical nonselective beta-blocker eye drops.",

However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. The present study was designed to investigate the molecular basis of propranolol on the regression of infantile hemangiomas using a proliferating infantile hemangioma-derived endothelial cell line. In infantile hemangioma patients, we found that propranolol significantly decreased the expression levels of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 in serum and urine, as well as in hemangioma tissues. In vitro analysis revealed that propranolol reduces the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in hemangioma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, mainly by acting on \u03b22-AR. Interestingly, it was observed that overexpression of HIF-1\u03b1 apparently abrogated the inhibitory effects of propranolol on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and cell growth. Our data further demonstrated that propranolol inhibited the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a critical oncogenic signaling molecule, and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Additionally, overexpression of HIF-1\u03b1 significantly reversed the inhibitory effects of propranolol on STAT3 signaling. In a mouse xenograft hemangioma model, overexpression of HIF-1\u03b1 significantly attenuated the therapeutic effects of propranolol and inhibited propranolol-induced hemangioma cell apoptosis. Moreover, the protein levels of VEGF, phosphorylated STAT3, total STAT3 and Bcl-2 were significantly upregulated by HIF-1\u03b1 overexpression in propranolol-treated nude mice bearing hemangiomas. Collectively, our data provide evidence that propranolol may regress infantile hemangiomas by suppressing VEGF and STAT3 signaling pathways in an HIF-1\u03b1-dependent manner.",

This study was planned to investigate the effect of carvedilol, a \u03b2-blocker, in improving the myocardial injury caused by IR of the rat brain. We have used a whole cerebral IR model in rats by clamping both the right and left common carotid arteries. Rats were divided into five groups; Sham surgery group (Group-Sham), carvedilol treatment before ischemia group (Group-Is+C), vehicle control group (Group-Is+V), carvedilol treatment before reperfusion group (Group-Re+C) and the vehicle control group (Group-Re+V). We have measured the blood pressure and heart rate via a catheter, myocardial tissue \u03b21-adrenaline receptor (\u03b21-AR) levels, phosphor-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-p38 MAPK) signaling factor, malondialdehyde (MDA), and apoptosis (TUNEL assay and expression of caspase-7 protein). The results indicated that the increased expressions of \u03b21-AR, p-p38 MAPK, caspase-7, apoptotic cells and MDA level in the myocardial tissue due to brain ischemia-reperfusion were significantly reduced by carvedilol treatment. From these observations we can suggest that, with the advantage of its antioxidant and \u03b2 blocking action, carvedilol had played the improvement of myocardial injury in ischemia-reperfusion of the brain.",

Cost-effectiveness ratios then became slightly less favourable but still less than US$ 100 per HLY gained for ASA. An incremental cost of\u2009>\u2009US$ 10,000 would have to be paid per extra HLY by adding a triptan in a stepped-care treatment paradigm.

Several experimental and clinical studies have established that Propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, reduces LID without affecting L-DOPA's efficacy. However, the exact mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-dyskinetic profile of Propranolol against a panel of DA replacement strategies, as well as elucidate the underlying neurochemical mechanisms. Results indicated that Propranolol, in a dose-dependent manner, reduced LID, without affecting motor performance. Propranolol failed to alter dyskinesia produced by the D1 receptor agonist, SKF81297 (0.08 mg/kg, sc), or the D2 receptor agonist, Quinpirole (0.05 mg/kg, sc). These findings suggested a pre-synaptic mechanism for Propranolol's anti-dyskinetic effects, possibly through modulating L-DOPA-mediated DA efflux. To evaluate this possibility, microdialysis studies were carried out in the DA-lesioned striatum of dyskinetic rats and results indicated that co-administration of Propranolol (20 mg/kg, ip) was able to attenuate L-DOPA- (6 mg/kg, sc) induced DA efflux.

The aim of this study was to test the effects of isoproterenol, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist, on the voltage-dependent fast-inactivating Na(+) currents in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pyramidal neurons obtained from young rats. The recordings were performed in the cell-attached configuration. Isoproterenol (2\u03bcM) did not change the peak Na(+) current amplitude but shifted the IV curve of the Na(+) currents toward hyperpolarization. Pretreatment of the cells with the \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists propranolol and metoprolol abolished the effect of isoproterenol on the Na(+) currents, suggesting the involvement of \u03b21-adrenergic receptors. The effect of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation on the sodium currents was dependent on kinase A and kinase C; the effect was diminished in the presence of the kinase A antagonist H-89 and the kinase C antagonist chelerythrine and abolished when the antagonists were coapplied. Moreover, isoproterenol depolarized the membrane potential recorded using the perforated-patch method, and this depolarization was abolished by cesium ions. Thus, in mPFC pyramidal neurons, stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors up-regulates the fast-inactivating voltage-gated Na(+) currents evoked by suprathreshold depolarizations.",

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which has become the mainstay of treatment for AMI, is associated with a lower mortality than fibrinolysis. The benefits of beta-blockers after primary PCI in AMI patients without pump failure are unclear. We hypothesized that oral beta-blocker therapy after primary PCI might reduce the mortality in AMI patients without pump failure. The assessment of lipophilic vs. hydrophilic statin therapy in acute myocardial infarction (ALPS-AMI) study was a multi-center study that enrolled 508 AMI patients to compare the efficacy of hydrophilic and lipophilic statins in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. We prospectively tracked cardiovascular events for 3\u00a0years in 444 ALPS-AMI patients (median age 66\u00a0years; 18.2\u00a0% women) who had Killip class 1 on admission and were discharged alive. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The 3-year follow-up was completed in 413 patients (93.0\u00a0%). During this follow-up, 21 patients (4.7\u00a0%) died. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients on beta-blockers had a significantly lower incidence of all-cause mortality (2.7 vs. 7.3\u00a0%, log-rank p\u00a0=\u00a00.025). After adjusting for the calculated propensity score for using beta-blockers, their use remained an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.309; 95\u00a0% confidence interval 0.116-0.824; p\u00a0=\u00a00.019). In the statin era, the use of beta-blocker therapy after primary PCI is associated with lower mortality in AMI patients with Killip class 1 on admission.", 
    "183": "The stimulants cathinone (from Khat leaves) and methylenedioxymeth-amphetamine (MDMA) produce adrenoceptor mediated tachycardia and vasopressor actions that may be the result of direct receptor stimulation, actions on the noradrenaline transporter, and/or displacement of noradrenaline from nerve terminals. Effects of cathinone or MDMA were compared with those of the indirect sympathomimetic tyramine. Male Wistar rats were anaesthetized with pentobarbitone for blood pressure and heart rate recording. Some rats were sympathectomised by treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine. In the anaesthetised rat, cathinone, MDMA and tyramine (all 0.001-1 mg/kg) produced marked tachycardia, tyramine produced marked pressor responses and MDMA produced small pressor responses. The tachycardia to cathinone and MDMA was almost abolished by propranolol (1mg/kg). Pretreatment with cocaine (1mg/kg) did not significantly affect the tachycardia to cathinone or MDMA, but reduced the response to tyramine. However, in sympathectomised rats, the tachycardia to cathinone or MDMA was markedly attenuated, but the tachycardia to tyramine was only partially reduced. Blood pressure effects of tyramine and MDMA were also markedly attenuated by sympathectomy. The results demonstrate firstly that cocaine may not be the most suitable agent for assessing direct versus indirect agonism in cardiovascular studies. Secondly, the use of chemical sympathectomy achieved the desired goal of demonstrating that cardiac \u03b2-adrenoceptor mediated actions of cathinone and MDMA are probably largely indirect.", 
    "184": "The aim of study was to evaluate the effects of nebivolol, a cardioselective beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocker of the third generation with vasodilatory properties, vs. bisoprolol on the genital circulation, uterine vasculature, fetal growth and postnatal development in pregnant Wistar rats. Non invasive measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and heart rate (HR), and invasive measurement of genital blood flow (GBF) were taken in pregnant rats, by tail cuff and transonic probe methods respectively, after an oral treatment by gastric gavage with nebivolol (8mg/kg/day) or bisoprolol (10mg/kg/day) from day 11 to day 18 of pregnancy. Other morphometrical and histological measurements were performed on the ovarian and uterine arteries to evaluate the effect of nebivolol on the uterine vasculature. Furthermore, postnatal mortality and pup growth were recorded. The data demonstrated that nebivolol (compared with bisoprolol) induced a significant decrease in SBP, HR and GBF while DBP remained unchanged. Moreover, nebivolol increased the diameter and the length of ovarian and uterine arteries and the number of uterine artery segmental branches. The results also showed that the body weight gain of newborns in the nebivolol group was significantly lower vs. bisoprolol and vs. control with a higher mortality rate. The nebivolol action is not only limited to its favorable hemodynamic effects represented by a decrease in blood pressure, but it also produces adverse effects on fetal growth and postnatal development that may limit its therapeutic use in females during pregnancy.", 
    "185": "The presence, distribution and characteristics of chamber-specific \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in adult turkey hearts were investigated by radioligand binding studies using (-)-[(125)I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). The \u03b21-selective (CGP 20712A) and \u03b22-selective (ICI 118.551) antagonists as well as the nonselective \u03b2-agonists isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine were used in displacement studies. In all cardiac chambers, ICI 118.551 and CGP 20712A displacement curves were monophasic and steep, with the affinity of CGP 20712A higher than that of ICI 118.551, indicating the exclusive presence of the \u03b21-adrenergic receptor subtype. The agonist rank order of potency was isoproterenol\u2009>\u2009norepinephrine\u2009\u2265\u2009epinephrine, typical for the \u03b21-receptor subtype. In all chambers, the density of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors was ~40\u2009fmol/mg protein and the KD was ~30\u2009pM. The study revealed similar \u03b2-adrenergic receptor density mainly of the \u03b21-subtype in all cardiac chambers, indicating that this receptor subtype could contribute equally to regulate cardiac physiological function and pathophysiology.", 
    "186": "The aim of the present review was to investigate the association between the use of oral \u03b2-blockers and prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treatment. A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed (from inception to September 27, 2014) and Embase (Ovid SP, from 1974 to September 29, 2014) to identify studies that compared the outcome of patients with AMI taking oral \u03b2-blockers with that of patients not taking after PCI. Systematic review and meta-analysis were performed with random-effects model or fixed-effects model. Ten observational studies with a total of 40,873 patients were included. Use of \u03b2-blockers was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause death (unadjusted relative risk 0.58, 95% confidential interval 0.48 to 0.71; adjusted hazard ratio 0.76, 95% confidential interval 0.62 to 0.94). The potential benefit of \u03b2-blockers in preventing all-cause death was not similar in all population but was restricted to those with reduced ejection fraction, with low use proportion of other secondary prevention drugs or with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The association between the use of \u03b2-blockers and improved survival rate was significant in \u22641-year follow-up duration. Rates of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and heart failure readmission in patients using \u03b2-blockers were not significantly different from those in patients without \u03b2-blocker therapy. In conclusion, there is lack of evidence to support routine use of \u03b2-blockers in all patients with AMI who underwent PCI. Further trials are urgently needed to address the issue.", 
    "187": "Bladder overactivity (OAB) is a multifactorial bladder disorder that requires therapeutics superior to the current pharmacological treatment with muscarinic antagonists. \u03b23-adrenoceptor (\u03b23-ADR) agonists represent a novel promising approach that differently addresses the parasympathetic pathway, but the clinical efficacy of these drugs has not been fully elucidated to date. Therefore, we aimed to study the pharmacological mechanisms activated by \u03b23-ADR agonists at muscular and neural sites in the isolated human bladder. Detrusor smooth muscle strips obtained from male patients undergoing total cystectomy were labelled with tritiated choline and stimulated with electrical field stimulation (EFS). EFS produced smooth muscle contraction and simultaneous acetylcholine ([(3)H]-ACh) release, which mostly reflects the neural origin of acetylcholine. Isoprenaline (INA), BRL37344 and mirabegron inhibited the EFS-evoked contraction and [(3)H]-ACh release in a concentration-dependent manner, yielding concentration-response curves (CRCs) that were shifted to the right by the selective \u03b23-ADR antagonists L-748,337 and SR59230A. Based on the agonist potency estimates (pEC50) and apparent affinities (pKb) of antagonists evaluated from the CRCs of agonists, our data confirm the occurrence of \u03b23-ADRs at muscle sites. Moreover, our data are consistent with the presence of inhibitory \u03b23-ADRs that are functionally expressed at the neural site. Taken together, these findings elucidate the mechanisms activated by \u03b23-ADR agonists because neural \u03b23-ADRs participate in the inhibition of detrusor motor drive by reducing the amount of acetylcholine involved in the cholinergic pathway.",

    "189": "To assess the prevalence and correlates of non-optimal secondary medical prevention in patients with stable CAD.", 
    "190": "We included 4184 consecutive outpatients with stable CAD. Treatment at inclusion was classified as optimal/non-optimal regarding the four major classes of secondary prevention drugs: antithrombotics; statins; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs); and beta-blockers. For each treatment, the prescription was considered non-optimal if the drug was missing despite a class IA indication according to international guidelines. To assess the information globally, non-optimal secondary prevention was defined as at least one major treatment missing.", 
    "191": "The proportions of patients with non-optimal treatment were 0.7%, 7.8%, 12.9% and 10.3% for antithrombotics, statins, ACE inhibitors/ARBs and beta-blockers, respectively. Non-optimal secondary medical prevention was observed in 16.8% of cases. By multivariable analysis, the correlates of non-optimal secondary medical prevention were long time interval since last coronary event (P<0.0001), older age (P<0.0001), diabetes mellitus (P<0.0001), hypertension (P<0.0001), no history of myocardial infarction (P=0.001), no history of coronary revascularization (P=0.013) and low glomerular filtration rate (P=0.042).", 
    "192": "Although most patients with stable CAD are receiving evidence-based medications according to guidelines, there remain subgroups at higher risk of non-optimal treatment. In particular, it might be feasible to improve prevention by focusing on patients in whom a long time has elapsed since the last coronary event.", 
    "193": "Two therapeutically active compounds from the group of \u03b2-blockers, acebutolol (AC) and alprenolol (AL), in solid form were subjected to ionizing radiation emitted by a beam of high energy electrons from an accelerator with a standard sterilization dose of 25 kGy and in higher doses of 50-400 kGy. The effects of irradiation were detected by chromatographic methods (TLC, HPLC) and a hyphenated method (HPLC/MS/MS). No significant changes in the physicochemical properties of both compounds studied irradiated with 25 kGy were noted, but upon irradiation with the highest dose (400 kGy) the loss of AC and AL content determined by HPLC was 2.79 and 9.12%, respectively. The product of AC decomposition and the two products of AL decomposition were separated and identified by HPLC/MS/MS. It has been established that radiodegradation of AC and AL takes place by oxidation, leading to formation of the products of radiolysis, most probably alcohol derivatives of the \u03b2-blockers studied. The additional product that appears on radiodegradation of AL is probably formed as a result of two simultaneous reactions: oxidation and CH2 group elimination.",

The objective of this study is to identify any adverse events and to measure the efficacy of propranolol in children with complicated IH, through a retrospective, observational, case-series study of 25 patients treated with propranolol at the H\u00f4pital Universitaire des Enfants Reine Fabiola in Belgium.", 
    "195": "25 patients were submitted to this therapy. The treatment was stopped prematurely for two of them, by parental fear of side effects and 48 % presented one or more adverse events; all of which were transient and rapidly controlled by adjusting the doses administered. Mean age at the start of treatment was 4,8 months. A clearly favorable response was observed in 100 % of patients at their first visit after treatment initiation ; a total response was seen in 9 patients, with subtotal and partial responses observed in 9 and 3 patients, respectively, by the end of treatment.", 
    "196": "The real efficacy of propranolol for complicated IH was confirmed by the clearly evident improvement observed in all patients and the absence of non-responders. As global tolerance was also good, propranolol can therefore be considered to be an appropriate first- line treatment for complicated IH.", 
    "197": "Oral propranolol hydrochloride has been proven effective in treating infantile hemangiomas, and its potential efficacy in choroidal hemangiomas has been suggested. A 57-year-old woman with a juxtapapillary capillary hemangioma was treated with oral propranolol at Nagoya Medical Center in Japan in 2012. Although the condition of this patient partially improved, oral propranolol did not appear to have a critical therapeutic effect. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first pilot study to describe a case in which oral propranolol was used as a therapeutic approach for a retinal hemangioma.", 
    "198": "Patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitute a high-risk group with increased mortality. \u03b2-Blocker therapy has been shown to reduce mortality, prevent arrhythmias, and delay heart failure development after an MI in broad populations. However, the effect of \u03b2-blockers in COPD patients is less well established and they may also be less treated due to fear of adverse reactions. We investigated \u03b2-blocker prescription at discharge in patients with COPD after MI.", 
    "199": "Patients hospitalized for MI between 2005 and 2010 were identified from the nationwide Swedish SWEDEHEART registry. Patients with COPD who were alive and discharged after an MI were selected as the study population. In this cohort, patients who were discharged with \u03b2-blockers were compared to patients not discharged with \u03b2-blockers. The primary end point was all-cause mortality. A total of 4858 patients were included, of which 4086 (84.1%) were discharged with a \u03b2-blocker while 772 (15.9%) were not. After adjusting for potential confounders including baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and in-hospital characteristics, patients discharged with a \u03b2-blocker had lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98) during the total follow-up time (maximum 7.2 years). In the subgroup of patients with a history of heart failure, the corresponding hazard ratio was 0.77 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.95).",

B-blockers were prescribed in 74.2% of patients. Resting HR by pulse on b-blocker was 67.8 bpm and without b-blocker 69.6 bpm (p=0.069). HR70 bpm was independently associated with a lack of physical activity, higher systolic blood pressure, and a higher prevalence of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and carotid artery disease.", 
    "204": "Despite the use of HR lowering agents, the percentage of patients with HR70 bpm was high. It is likely that we can further improve HR control in Greek patients with stable CAD by both increasing the prescription of b-blockers and up-titrating their dose, as well as by using and up-titrating other available HR lowering agents.", 
    "205": "The present work exploits the potential of in silico approaches for minimizing attrition of leads in the later stages of drug development. We propose a theoretical approach, wherein 'parallel' information is generated to simultaneously optimize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of lead candidates. \u03b2-blockers, though in use for many years, have suboptimal PKs; hence are an ideal test series for the 'parallel progression approach'. This approach utilizes molecular modeling tools viz. hologram quantitative structure activity relationships, homology modeling, docking, predictive metabolism, and toxicity models. Validated models have been developed for PK parameters such as volume of distribution (log Vd) and clearance (log Cl), which together influence the half-life (t1/2) of a drug. Simultaneously, models for PD in terms of inhibition constant pKi have been developed. Thus, PK and PD properties of \u03b2-blockers were concurrently analyzed and after iterative cycling, modifications were proposed that lead to compounds with optimized PK and PD. We report some of the resultant re-engineered \u03b2-blockers with improved half-lives and pKi values comparable with marketed \u03b2-blockers. These were further analyzed by the docking studies to evaluate their binding poses. Finally, metabolic and toxicological assessment of these molecules was done through in silico methods. The strategy proposed herein has potential universal applicability, and can be used in any drug discovery scenario; provided that the data used is consistent in terms of experimental conditions, endpoints, and methods employed. Thus the 'parallel progression approach' helps to simultaneously fine-tune various properties of the drug and would be an invaluable tool during the drug development process."
