We questioned whether the selective mineralocorticoid receptor blocker eplerenone improves resistance artery remodeling in hypertensive patients versus the beta-blocker atenolol. Sixteen hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to double-blind daily treatment with eplerenone or atenolol. Resistance arteries from gluteal subcutaneous tissue were assessed on a pressurized myograph. After 1 year of treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were similarly well controlled in both groups. Endothelial function did not change with treatment in either group. Media/lumen ratio and cross-sectional area were unchanged in either the atenolol or the eplerenone group. In atenolol-treated patients, the arterial wall became stiffer, whereas in the eplerenone-treated patients, it became less stiff and similar to that of a normotensive control group. The media collagen/elastin ratio was reduced only after eplerenone treatment. Circulating concentrations of osteopontin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, basic fibroblast growth factor, interleukin-8, and interleukin-10 were significantly reduced only by eplerenone. However, plasma interleukin-1 receptor a concentration was significantly reduced by both drugs. In conclusion, in hypertensive patients, blood pressure control for 1 year with atenolol was associated with increased wall stiffness of resistance arteries, whereas eplerenone treatment was associated with reduced stiffness, decreased collagen/elastin ratio, and a reduction in circulating inflammatory mediators. These data raise the possibility that eplerenone treatment of hypertensive patients when normalizing blood pressure could potentially be associated with better vascular protection and outcomes than the beta-blocker atenolol, which remains to be demonstrated.", 
    "1": "Placental syncytiotrophoblasts are known to express the efflux transporter proteins P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (ABCC2), which are supposed to be a functional part of the human placental barrier. With advancing gestational age, expression of ABCB1 decreases progressively, whereas ABCC2 is more expressed. To evaluate to which extent they contribute to placental barrier function at term, permeability of talinolol, a substrate of both carriers, was measured using a validated human placenta perfusion model. We identified in randomized, crossover experiments a unidirectional transfer of talinolol in the fetomaternal direction because the maternofetal transfer was significantly lower (0.663 +/- 0.188 versus 0.394 +/- 0.067 relative to creatinine permeability, p = 0.012). Maternofetal permeability was increased by the ABCC2 inhibitor probenecid (0.59 +/- 0.15 versus 0.68 +/- 0.13, p = 0.028) and the nonspecific inhibitor verapamil (0.53 +/- 0.09 versus 0.66 +/- 0.16, p = 0.028) but was not influenced by the ABCB1 inhibitor valspodar (PSC833) (0.48 +/- 0.11 versus 0.46 +/- 0.09, p = 0.345). Genetic polymorphisms of ABCB1 and ABCC2 lacked significant influence on expression of the carriers and permeability of talinolol, respectively. In conclusion, maternofetal transfer of talinolol is restricted by a unidirectional process that is influenced by inhibitors of ABCC2.",

    "6": "Nebivolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker (BB) currently used for the treatment of hypertension. It has mild vasodilating properties attributed to its interaction with the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway, a property not shared by other BBs. Carvedilol is a nonselective ss-adrenergic receptor antagonist that also blocks alpha1-adrenergic receptors and is a potent antioxidant. Anthracyclines (ANTs), daunorubicin and doxorubicin, are commonly used in the treatment of several tumours, but their cardiac toxicity prevents their use at maximum myelotoxic doses, representing an important problem. In this study, we have evaluated the role of these BBs administered in combination with ANTs (daunorubicin and doxorubicin) on a reduction in cardiac toxicity. The combination of BB and ANTs has reduced the release of GSSG and GSH; in particular, co-treatment with nebivolol to ANTs has shown a significant reduction. The total integrated creatine kinase and troponin T activities were improved by BB and ANTs co-treatment. A significant reduction of their release was observed when hearts were treated with nebivolol. Cardiac tissue activity of gluthatione reductase was not significant and similar among experimental groups. In contrast, gluthatione peroxidise, Mn-superoxide dismutase and nitrite/nitrate release were increased after co-treatment with nebivolol. Finally, three parameters have been used to evaluate the cardiac toxicity of ANTs: the left ventricular pressure developed under a constant perfusion pressure (LVDP), the rate of variation of this parameter during systole (contractility) (LV/dt)max and during diastole (relaxation) (LV(dP/dt)min. Combination with BB has shown a reduction in cardiac toxicity; in particular, nebivolol has exerted the most significant cardioprotective effect.",

A 48-year-old woman with cirrhosis due to autoimmune hepatitis underwent living-donor liver transplant; her graft-to-body weight ratio of the right lobe was 0.91%. After arterial reperfusion, portal pressure and flow were 24 cm H20 and 2.22 L/min (ie, 360 mL/100g graft/min), respectively. Following splenic artery ligation, the portal pressure decreased to 16 cm H20 and portal flow to 1.74 L/min (ie, 282 mL/100g graft/min). On the second postoperative day, small-for-size syndrome was diagnosed based on the marked prolongation of prothrombin time (international normalized ratio, 4.4), hyperbilirubinemia (359.1 micromol/L), rapid escalation of transaminases (alanine aminotransferase 2488 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 1075 U/L) and very high portal flow rate (> 90 cm/sec). Oral propranolol (40 mg/day b.i.d.) and somatostatin infusion (250-microgram bolus followed by perfusion at a rate of 250 microgram/h for 5 days) were started. Prothrombin time and transaminase levels began to decrease the following day, although the bilirubin level increased to 495.9 micromol/L before returning to normal. The patient was discharged in excellent health 5 weeks after surgery. Despite reduction of portal pressure by splenic artery ligation, small-for-size syndrome may develop in patients with persistent high portal flow. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the successful treatment of small-for-size syndrome by somatostatin and propranolol in the clinical setting.", 
    "12": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and is both common and amenable to treatment. Several major new studies have appeared recently and in response the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the British Hypertension Society have collaborated to update their respective guidelines on primary hypertension, and to agree joint recommendations. The update focuses only on pharmacological aspects of treatment. Wherever possible, the recommendations are based on the clinical outcomes of mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and new onset diabetes mellitus, rather than on blood pressure lowering. A brief treatment algorithm is included. In summary, either calcium channel inhibitors or thiazide-type diuretics should be the preferred initial agent for use in primary hypertension in most patients, although angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (including angiotensin-II receptor inhibitors if ACE-intolerant) are preferred in patients younger than 55.", 
    "13": "This study was designed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of pharmacological interventions, modulating resident cardiac mast cells, on ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury. Isolated rat hearts were mounted on Langendorff apparatus and subjected to 30-min global ischemia followed by 120-min reperfusion. The extent of mast cell degranulation was assessed by release of mast cell peroxidase (MPO). The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) and estimation of infarct size were used to assess the extent of myocardial injury. Left ventricle developed pressure (LVDP) and its derivatives, that is, dp/dt(max) and dp/dt(min), were recorded to evaluate the postischemic recovery of the contractility of heart. Ketotifen (0.1 microM) and low-dose carvedilol (0.1 microM), without beta-blockade activity, attenuated ischemia-reperfusion-induced mast cell degranulation along with the reduction in myocardial injury, suggesting the protective effects of mast cell stabilization during ischemia and reperfusion. Administration of compound 48/80 (1 microg/ml), a specific mast cell degranulating agent, completely degranulated cardiac mast cells before global ischemia. Moreover, it also resulted in the attenuation of ischemia-reperfusion-induced myocardial injury. Decreased release of cytotoxic mediators from already degranulated (empty) mast cells during sustained global ischemia may be responsible for the cardioprotective effects of compound 48/80. Administration of carvedilol or ketotifen after compound 48/80 perfusion did not further enhance the cardioprotective effects, suggesting that the cardiac mast cells may be the common target site for ketotifen, compound 48/80 and low-dose carvedilol.",

The beta-adrenoceptor pathways, which are known to be effective early in hESC-CM development, are of major importance because of their control of rate and force of beating, arrhythmia generation and apoptosis/necrosis. We have therefore performed detailed pharmacological analysis of the beta-adrenoceptor responses in developing hESC-CM.",

Several groups have shown that hESCs can be differentiated in vitro into cardiac myocytes, which may be used to facilitate tissue regeneration by injection directly into damaged myocardium. However, several hurdles still need to be overcome before these cells can be used in clinical trials. In particular, because transplanted hESC-cardiac myocytes should integrate fully within the damaged heart, these cells must be functionally compatible with the host myocardium. To assess this aspect of hESC-cardiac myocytes, Brito-Martins et al. (2008) in this issue of the BJP, describe the responses of hESC-cardiac myocytes to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, compared to those of myocytes from adult human hearts.

This study examined the effect and mechanisms underlying scorpion toxin action from Androctonus australis garzonii on atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release from rat atrium using in vitro organ perifusion. Male Sprague Dawley rats were used in this study. Three experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, atrial tissues were exposed either to Krebs-bicarbonate buffer medium (control) or to scorpion toxin (10(-8) M to 10(-6) M). In experiment 2, animals were chemically sympathectomized with a single intraperitoneal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDOPA) at a dose of 40 microg/g 24 h before sacrifice. Vehicle-treated rats served as control. Atrial tissues were collected and perifused in the presence of 10(-6) M scorpion toxin. In experiment 3, atrial tissues were exposed to 10(-6) M scorpion toxin either in the absence or presence of 10(-6) M propranolol (a beta-adrenoceptor blocker), or 10(-6) M tetrodotoxin (a sodium channel blocker). ANP levels released in the perifusion medium were determined by radioimmunoassay. The scorpion toxin at 10(-6) M induced a significant (p<0.01) increase (106%) in ANP levels. This effect was decreased (20%) by 6-OHDOPA. Propranolol and tetrodotoxin significantly (p<0.01) inhibited 55% and 60%, respectively, the toxin-induced ANP release. The data show that the North African scorpion toxin from Androctonus australis garzonii increases the ANP release in rat atrium through stimulation of sympathetic cardiac nerves and sodium channels activation.", 
    "24": "It is well established that beta-adrenoceptors (beta-ARs) in the hippocampal CA1 region are involved in regulating synaptic plasticity and are essential for acquisition and consolidation of spatial memory and contextual fear memory. Previous studies reported that beta-ARs in the CA1 region are also involved in memory retrieval. The present study re-examined the role of hippocampal beta-ARs in retrieval of conditioned contextual fear. We bilaterally infused a high dose of the beta-AR antagonist propranolol (15mug in 1mul saline) into the CA1 region 30min before retention test and found that propranolol produced no deficit in retrieval of either 1-day or 7-day contextual fear. We then examined if beta-AR stimulation would produce a beneficial effect. The beta-AR agonist isoproterenol (10mug in 1mul saline) was infused into the CA1 region 30min before retention test. Surprisingly, isoproterenol did not enhance but severely disrupted retrieval of 7-day contextual fear memory, with no impact on retrieval of 1-day contextual fear memory. The present study argues against the previous conclusion that beta-ARs in the CA1 region play a role in memory retrieval. beta-ARs in the CA1 region may be dispensable for retrieval of conditioned contextual fear.",

This study aimed at reporting physical and biochemical correlates of serum total testosterone (total T), bioavailable testosterone (BT) and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEAS) levels in community-dwelling, African-American men aged 50-65 years. Home-based physical examinations and health status questionnaires were administered to randomly sampled men. Body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), lower limb and hand-grip muscle strength, and neuropsychological functions were assessed. Levels of serum total T, BT, DHEAS, oestradiol (E2), adiponectin, leptin, triglycerides and glucose were measured. Multiple linear regression models were constructed to identify factors independently associated with androgen levels. DHEAS levels declined from age 50 to 65 years (p < 0.0001), but total T and BT levels remained constant. Independent of other associated factors, higher total T levels were associated with lower serum triglyceride levels (beta = -0.142, p = 0.049); higher BT was associated with better performance on the trail-making tests (TMT-B:TMT-A ratio: beta = -0.118, p = 0.024) and higher DHEAS levels were associated with lower adiponectin (beta = -0.293, p = 0.047) and higher mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score (beta = 0.098, p = 0.008). Multiple regression models predicted 21, 18 and 29% of variance in total T, BT and DHEAS, respectively. Higher total T levels were associated with serum metabolic markers, particularly lower triglycerides, whereas higher BT was associated with better cognitive and muscle function and DHEAS with lower adiponectin and higher MMSE scores.",

This is most apparent in aversive conditioning, in which the stress-related neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) enhances associations between sensory stimuli and fear-inducing events. In contrast to conditioning, extinction decreases fear responses, and is thought to form a new memory. It is not known, however, whether NE is necessary for extinction learning. Previous work has shown that the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IL) is a site of extinction consolidation. Here, we show that blocking noradrenergic beta-receptors in IL before extinction training impaired retrieval of extinction the following day, consistent with a weakened extinction memory. We further found that the sequelae of beta-receptor activation, including protein kinase A (PKA), gene transcription and translation in IL, are necessary for extinction. To determine whether activation of this cascade modulates IL excitability, we measured the response of IL pyramidal neurons to injected current. NE increased the excitability of IL neurons in a beta-receptor- and PKA-dependent manner. We suggest that NE released in IL during fear extinction activates a PKA-mediated molecular cascade that strengthens extinction memory. Thus, emotional arousal evoked by conditioned fear paradoxically promotes the subsequent extinction of that fear, thereby ensuring behavioral flexibility.",

Primary endpoint was frequency of attacks (prevention of migraine attacks) in the final 4 weeks of a 14-week treatment on full dose of metoprolol and nebivolol. Secondary endpoints were time to therapeutic effect, duration of attacks, intensity of headache, consumption of analgesics, evaluation of accompanying symptoms, migraine disability assessment, clinical global impression, quality of life, and responder rates. The statistical analysis was prospectively planned and conducted for all randomized patients.",

Use of acute pain medication decreased on both drugs, as well as accompanying symptoms. Both patients' and physicians' evaluations of disability and disease status were similarly favorable to the 2 treatments. Regarding safety, nebivolol was considerably better tolerated than metoprolol in terms of all reported events, treatment-related events, and event severity.",

The investigation involved monitoring drug decomposition, identifying intermediate compounds, assessing mineralization, and evaluating toxicity. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) via an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface was a powerful tool for the identification and measurement of the degradation products; 23 main species were identified. Intermediates were characterized through their chromatographic behavior and evolution kinetics, coupled with accurate mass information. Through the full analysis of MS and MS(n) spectra and a comparison with parent drug fragmentation pathways, the diverse isomers were characterized. Neither atenolol nor the intermediates formed exhibit acute toxicity. All intermediates are easily degraded and no compound identified could withstand 2 h irradiation. Photomineralization of the substrate in terms of carbon mineralization and nitrogen release was rapid and, within 4 h of irradiation, organic nitrogen and carbon were completely mineralized.",

We investigated whether aspirin and propranolol affect the responsiveness of plasma clotting factor VIII activity levels to acute psychosocial stress. We randomized 54 healthy subjects double-blind to 5-day treatment with a single daily oral dosage of either 100 mg aspirin plus 80 mg propranolol combined, 100 mg of aspirin, 80 mg of propranolol, or placebo medication. Thereafter, subjects underwent a 13-min standardized psychosocial stressor. Plasma levels of clotting factor VIII activity were determined immediately before, immediately after, 45 min and 105 min after stress. Controlling for demographic, metabolic, and life style factors repeated measures analysis of covariance showed that the change in clotting factor VIII activity from prestress to 105 min poststress differed between medication groups (P = 0.023; partial eta = 0.132). The clotting factor VIII activity level decreased from prestress to immediately poststress in the aspirin/propranolol group relative to the placebo group (P = 0.048) and the aspirin group (P < 0.06). Between 45 min and 105 min poststress, clotting factor VIII levels increased in the aspirin/propranolol group relative to the placebo group (P = 0.007) and the aspirin group (P = 0.039). The stress response in clotting factor VIII activity levels was not significantly different between the aspirin/propranolol group and the propranolol group. Propranolol in combination with aspirin diminished the acute response in clotting factor VIII activity to psychosocial stress compared with placebo medication and aspirin alone.

These should be considered as preliminary data, as analyses may change in the final publication. Rosuvastatin did not reduce mortality compared to placebo in patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction due to ischaemic heart disease in the CORONA study. Results of RethinQ provide equivocal evidence of benefit from CRT in patients with heart failure, echocardiographic dyssynchrony and QRS interval <130 ms. In the MASCOT study, the addition of atrial overdrive pacing did not reduce the incidence of permanent atrial fibrillation in patients receiving CRT. The AF-CHF study failed to show a benefit of rhythm control over rate control in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Self-management skills training and education had no benefit on the combined outcome of death or heart failure hospitalisation, compared with education alone in heart failure patients in the HART study. Microvolt T-wave alternans testing failed to identify patients at increased risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in the MASTER study. POISE suggests that initiating metoprolol therapy shortly prior to non-cardiac surgery increases the risk of hypotension, stroke and death, despite reducing the risk of myocardial infarction.

    "67": "Atenolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist ('beta-blocker') widely used for the treatment of angina, glaucoma, high blood pressure and other related conditions. Since atenolol is not appreciably metabolized in humans, the parent compound is the predominant excretory product, and has been detected in sewage effluent discharges and surface waters. Consequently, atenolol has been chosen as a reference pharmaceutical for a European Union-funded research consortium, known as ERAPharm (http://www.erapharm.org), which focused on the fate and effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Here, we present data generated within this project from studies assessing population-relevant effects in a freshwater fish species. Using fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) as a standard OECD test species, embryo-larval development (early life stage or ELS) and short-term (21 d) adult reproduction studies were undertaken. In the ELS study, the 4d embryo NOEC(hatching) and LOEC(hatching) values were 10 and >10mg/L, respectively, and after 28 d, NOEC(growth) and LOEC(growth) values were 3.2 and 10mg/L, respectively (arithmetic mean measured atenolol concentrations were >90% of these nominal values). In the short-term reproduction study, NOEC(reproduction) and LOEC(reproduction) values were 10 and >10mg/L, respectively (mean measured concentrations were 77-96% of nominal values), while the most sensitive endpoint was an increase in male fish condition index, giving NOEC(condition index) and LOEC(condition index) values of 1.0 and 3.2mg/L, respectively. The corresponding measured plasma concentration of atenolol in these fish was 0.0518 mg/L. These data collectively suggest that atenolol has low chronic toxicity to fish under the conditions described, particularly considering the low environmental concentrations reported. These data also allowed the assessment of two theoretical approaches proposed as predictors of the environmental impact of human pharmaceuticals: the Huggett 'mammalian-fish leverage model'; and the acute:chronic ratio (ACR). The Huggett model gave a measured human: fish effect ratio (ER) of 19.3 for atenolol, which compared well with the predicted ER of 40.98. Moreover, for an ER of 19.3, the model suggests that chronic testing may be warranted, and from our resultant effects data, atenolol does not cause significant chronic effects in fathead minnow at environmentally realistic concentrations. The calculated ACR for atenolol is >31.25, which is far lower than that of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and other potent steroidal oestrogens, thus further supporting the observed low toxicity. The data produced for atenolol here fit well with both approaches, but also highlight the importance of generating 'real' experimental data with which to calibrate and validate such models.",

Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta blockers have been shown to improve survival in patients with HF and low ejection fraction. However, no large national study has investigated these agents in patients with HF and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. We evaluated a nationwide sample of 13,533 eligible Medicare beneficiaries aged >or=65 years who were hospitalized with a primary discharge diagnosis of HF and had chart documentation of preserved left ventricular ejection fraction between April 1998 and March 1999 or between July 2000 and June 2001. In Cox proportional hazard model accounting for demographic profile, clinical characteristics, treatments, physician specialty, and hospital characteristics, discharge statin therapy was associated with significant improvements in 1- and 3-year mortality (RR 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61 to 0.78; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.79, respectively). Irrespective of total cholesterol level or coronary artery disease status, diabetes, hypertension, and age, statin therapy was associated with significant differences in mortality rates.

In a cohort study, 1693 consecutive patients > or =65 years undergoing major non-cardiac vascular surgery were preoperatively screened for cardiac risk factors and medication. During follow-up (median: 8.2 years), mortality was noted. Hospital mortality occurred in 8.1% and long-term mortality in 28.5%. In multivariate analysis, age, coronary artery disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal failure and diabetes were significantly associated with increased hospital and long-term mortality.

The vasoactivities of brazilein were evaluated in isolated rat thoracic aorta. The results showed that brazilein can dose-dependently induce contraction of rat thoracic aorta in the resting and phenylephrine pre-evoked state. The average response to 100 microM of brazilein was 30% of the 50 mM KCl contraction, 26% of the 10 muM phenylephrine and 116% of the 20 mM caffeine contraction in comparison. The effects of vasocontraction were proved not to be endothelial dependent and could not be inhibited by alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker phentolamine, beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol, M-adrenaline receptor blocker atropine, angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan or the non-selective nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-Nitro-L-Arginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME). However the influx of extracellular calcium seemed to be required for this action, because depletion of extracellular calcium and the addition of L-type calcium ion channel antagonist (nimodipine and diltiazem), calcium ion channel activator (BAY-K8644) and potassium ion channel opener (pinacidil) could significantly affect the contraction induced by brazilein. We also investigated the possible signal mechanisms underlying brazilein-induced contraction using selective inhibitors. The inhibitors of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), Rho-kinase (ROK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) can suppress the effect of brazilein respectively, whereas inhibitors of other signaling or receptor molecules such as protein kinase C (PKC) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor had no effect. All these results demonstrated that brazilein can induce contraction of rat aorta, that the Ca2+ influx, ROK and ERK signal pathways and MLCK activation must be involved in the contractile processes.", 
    "78": "In chronic kidney disease (CKD) sympathetic overactivity is stimulated by signals from the diseased kidney activating hypothalamic centers. In addition, breakdown of circulating catecholamines is decreased. Indications for beta-blockers are cardio- and renoprotection. Cardioprotection is important because cardiovascular (CV) death is two- to 20-fold more likely in CKD than end-stage kidney disease; consequently, beta-blockers, with their adverse effect on CV risk profile, should be avoided. Controlled prospective evidence for renoprotection by beta-blockers in nondiabetic CKD with hard end points is lacking, but renoprotection by antihypertensive agents was first documented by administering beta-blockers in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Renoprotection by beta-blockers was seen experimentally. Furthermore, controlled studies documented a beneficial effect on albuminuria as a surrogate marker for renoprotection in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Renin-angiotensin system blockade is the undoubted first-line treatment in CKD. Several points argue for ancillary treatment with beta-blockers: in CKD often four or more different antihypertensive drugs are required and cardiac indications are frequent.",

Just before administering the drug, the pre-drug scores were taken, followed by post drug score obtained for consecutive six hours. Psychomotor assessment was carried out by three tests Simple Reaction Timer (SRT), Critical Flicker Fusion Frequent Threshold (CFFT) and Digit Cancellation Test (DCT). The results of present study indicate that single doses of atenolol and propranolol produced significant impairment of psychomotor performance. Nebivolol also impaired psychomotor performance tests in the similar fashion to atenolol and propranolol. Hence, the findings of the present study correlate with the lipophilic nature of the nebivolol.", 
    "81": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of beta-blockers (BBs) on heart rate recovery (HRR) following exercise stress testing. HRR is a predictor of mortality following exercise stress testing and is thought to be due to reinstitution of vagal tone. Exercise testing in the presence of BBs should have no effect on reinstitution of vagal tone and therefore no effect on HRR. One published study contradicts this understanding. The authors performed a retrospective analysis of the University of California, Davis, treadmill database and found 334 patients who underwent exercise stress echocardiography (ESE) with complete data. Patients undergoing ESE without a BB were compared with patients who were receiving a BB. HRR was not affected by BB use in patients without stress-induced echocardiographic abnormalities (negative ESE result). In patients with stress-induced echocardiographic abnormalities (positive ESE result), HRR was delayed compared with patients with negative ESE. BB use improved HRR in patients with positive ESE. BBs do not affect HRR in patients with a negative ESE result, and HRR can be used for mortality prediction. In patients with a positive ESE result, HRR is improved in the presence of a BB.", 
    "82": "Insulin resistance is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Therapies to lower blood pressure should not decrease insulin sensitivity, especially among high-risk patients such as diabetics. This study examined the effect of the beta1-selective adrenergic receptor-blocking agent extended-release metoprolol succinate (ER metoprolol) on insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients with suboptimal blood pressure control. Diabetic patients with average blood pressure levels >130/85 mm Hg despite antihypertensive therapy had insulin sensitivity quantified by insulin clamp. ER metoprolol was then added to their ongoing therapy. Following 12 weeks of ER metoprolol plus other therapy, the insulin clamp study was repeated. There were no significant changes in measures of insulin sensitivity, plasma lipids, or hemoglobin A1c with use of ER metoprolol. When beta-blocker therapy is considered, it appears that this agent can be used to treat hypertension without adverse effects on insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes, at least over the period of time treated.",

    "84": "Amiodarone (AM) is an antiarrhythmic agent widely used in the treatment of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. Dronedarone (DR) is a new compound with a pharmacological profile similar to that of AM, but iodine free. We previously demonstrated that chronic AM treatment reduces transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) in the canine heart. We used standard microelectrode technique to evaluate the effects of acute AM (100 microM) and DR (30 microM) on epicardial (EPI), endocardial (ENDO), and M region tissues obtained from the left ventricular wall of the canine heart. Amiodarone (100 microM, 120 min of exposure) produced little change in the action potential duration of ENDO and EPI tissues, but it shortened the action potential of M cells, especially at slow rates, leading to a decrease in TDR. Similar results were observed with DR. Acute AM (100 microM) and DR (30 microM) eliminated d-sotalol-induced early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and triggered activity in 3 of 3 and 2 of 6 M cell preparations, respectively. The reduction of TDR and the elimination of EAD-induced triggered activity differentiates AM and DR from other class III agents. These effects may explain the efficacy and low arrhythmogenicity of acute AM and suggest a potential safe use of DR as an antiarrhythmic agent.",

Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored by telemetry and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was calculated with the sequence method or with cross spectral analysis. The measurements were obtained before onset of diabetes and during the 4th week of diabetes. The onset of diabetes was accompanied by a continuous decline in HR (615+/-14 vs. 498+/-23 bpm), whereas BP values remained stable (108+/-2 vs. 111+/-2 mm Hg). The circadian HR rhythm increased in diabetic NOD mice. BRS was higher in diabetic NOD mice than in controls. Atropine reduced BRS more profoundly in diabetic mice compared to non-diabetic mice. Despite pathomorphological similarities of the diabetic autonomic neuropathy between patients with diabetes and diabetic NOD mice, the changes in blood pressure regulation are different.

Previous studies on the interaction of the beta1-selective adrenergic antagonist bisoprolol with kidney function have been performed only acutely and over the short term. This study was designed to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and effects on renal hemodynamics and function of bisoprolol during medium-term (6 mo) treatment of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a 2-wk run-in period on placebo, 87 consecutive hypertensive patients (46 men, 41 women) according to ESH-ESC (European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology) guidelines, aged from 27 to 64 y (mean age, 50+/-11 y), without renal or cardiovascular disease, were enrolled and assigned to treatment with bisoprolol 5 mg once daily for 6 mo.

The medium-term effects of bisoprolol included a significant reduction in blood pressure and heart rate (P<.001) without significant adverse drug reactions. Moreover, bisoprolol produced no alteration in renal function or hemodynamics, or in cardiac output.

Some studies have characterized the transcriptional regulation of the GDNF gene, but its regulatory mechanisms have yet to be well defined, especially under pathophysiological conditions. In this study, we used a pharmacological approach to study the expression of the rat GDNF gene induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary cultures of glial cells. MG132, a blocker of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, did not apparently affect LPS-induced GDNF gene expression, whereas it attenuated the up-regulation of iNOS genes via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4. In primary glial cultures, LPS increased the phosphorylation levels of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); in primary microglial cultures, it enhanced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk). Of the several MAP kinase inhibitors tested, a JNK-specific inhibitor blocked LPS-induced GDNF transcription in primary cultures of microglia, but not of astrocytes. These results suggest that LPS up-regulates GDNF transcription through an NF-kappaB independent pathway, and that JNK is responsible for LPS-stimulated GDNF transcription in primary cultures of microglia.",

The originality of these adsorbents is due to their surface chemistry, which protects them from rapid hydrolysis or dissolution at extreme pH conditions. Their adsorption properties were compared to those of the 3 microm Luna-C18 (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), which is a more conventional monofunctional material. The adsorption data were acquired by frontal analysis (FA) and the adsorption energy distributions (AEDs) of all systems studied were calculated by the expectation-maximization (EM) method. The experimental results show that neither a simple surface protection (Extend-C18) nor the elimination of most of the silanol groups (Cogent-C18) is sufficient to avoid a peak tailing of the basic compounds at pH 8 that is of thermodynamic origin. The incorporation of organic moieties in the silica matrix, which was achieved in XTerra-C18, the first generation of hybrid methyl/silica material, reduces the silanols activity and is more successful in reducing this peak tailing.",

This may lead to biased estimates of the treatment effect and loss of precision. The issue of missing data for inverse probability of treatment weighted estimation of marginal structural models (MSMs) has often been addressed, though little has been done to compare different missing data techniques in this relatively new method of analysis. We propose a method for systematically dealing with missingness in MSMs by treating missingness as a cause for censoring and weighting subjects by the inverse probability of missingness. We developed a series of simulations to systematically compare the effect of using case deletion, our inverse weighting approach, and multiple imputation in a MSM when there is missing information on an important confounder. We found that multiple imputation was slightly less biased and considerably less variable than the inverse probability approach. Thus, the lower variability achieved through multiple imputation makes it desirable in most practical cases where the missing data are strongly predicted by the available data. Inverse probability weighting is, however, a superior alternative to naive approaches such as complete-case analysis.",

We find that calcitriol (1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)) inhibits both basal and a LXR agonist, TO-901317, induced ABCA1 mRNA expression but has no effect on the mRNA expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), LXR alpha nor LXR beta. TO-901317 increases both basal and calcitriol induced 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3)-24-hydroxylase (CYP24) mRNA expression and it slightly but significantly inhibits VDR mRNA expression. The inhibition of ABCA1 by calcitriol appears to be androgen-independent. Cell growth assay shows that when each of calcitriol and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was co-treated with ABCA1 blocker, glybenclamide, cell-growth is significantly decreased compared to their own treatments respectively. Our study suggests a possible interaction between calcitriol and TO-901317 in LNCaP cells. Alike DHT, the inhibition of ABCA1 by calcitriol may be involved in its regulation of LNCaP growth.",

Male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used to characterize the interaction between the model drugs isoprenaline (to induce tachycardia) and S(-)-atenolol. Blood samples were taken to determine plasma pharmacokinetics. Reduction of isoprenaline-induced tachycardia was used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of isoprenaline was first characterized with the operational model of agonism using the literature value for the affinity (K(A)) of isoprenaline (3.2 x 10(-8) M; left atria WKY rats). Resulting estimates for baseline (E(0)), maximal effect (E(max)), and efficacy (tau) were 374 (1.9%), 130 (5.9%), and 247 (33%) beats per minute, respectively. In addition, the interaction between isoprenaline and S(-)-atenolol was characterized using a pharmacodynamic interaction model based on the operational model of agonism that describes the heart rate response based on the affinity of the agonist (K(A)), the affinity of the antagonist (K(B)), the efficacy (tau), the maximal effect (E(max)), the Hill coefficient (n(H)), the concentrations of isoprenaline and atenolol, and the displacement of the endogenous agonist adrenaline. The estimated in vivo affinity (K(B)) of S(-)-atenolol for the beta(1) -receptor was 4.6 x 10(-8) M. The obtained estimate for in vivo affinity of S(-)-atenolol (4.6 x 10(-8) M) is comparable to literature values for the in vitro affinity in functional assays. In conclusion, a meaningful estimate of in vivo affinity for S(-)-atenolol could be obtained using a mechanism-based pharmacodynamic modeling approach.",

Thrombocytopenia has been proposed as a noninvasive test to predict the presence of GEV. There is no agreement regarding a specific platelet count (PLT) that can reliably predict GEV. The present longitudinal study aims to (1) further investigate the relationship between varices and PLT at the time of endoscopy, (2) investigate whether changes in PLT from the baseline over time can predict the development of GEV, and (3) investigate whether changes in PLT correlate with the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). A secondary analysis was conducted for 213 subjects with compensated cirrhosis with portal hypertension but without GEV enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of a nonselective beta-blocker used to prevent GEV. PLTs were obtained every 3 months, and HVPG measurements and EGD were done annually. The PLTs were compared between subjects who did and did not develop GEV. In a median follow-up of 54.9 months, 84 patients developed GEV. PLT was greater than 150,000 in 15% of patients at the development of GEV. A receiver operating curve did not show any PLT with high sensitivity or specificity for the presence of GEV. Subjects with clinically insignificant portal hypertension (HVPG < 10 mm Hg) whose PLT remained greater than 100,000 had a 2-fold reduction in the occurrence of GEV (P = 0.0374). A significant correlation was found between HVPG and PLT at the baseline, year 1, and year 5 (P < 0.0001).",

The present study was undertaken to examine the involvement of spinal N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and histamine H(1) and H(2) receptors in the nociceptive behaviors evoked by high-dose histamine. Co-administration of the histamine H(1) receptor antagonists, d-chlorpheniramine and pyrilamine, or the histamine H(2) receptor antagonists, ranitidine and zolantidine, failed to suppress the histamine-evoked nociceptive behaviors. Moreover, following histamine administration, nociceptive behaviors in histamine H(1) receptor-knockout and histamine H(2) receptor-knockout mice were indistinguishable from those in wild-type mice, suggesting that histamine-induced nociceptive behaviors are not mediated through histamine H(1) and H(2) receptors in the spinal cord. The histamine-induced nociceptive behaviors were inhibited by co-administration of the competitive NMDA receptor antagonists, d-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV) and 3-((+)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPPA), and the ion channel blocker, (5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801).

Moreover, agmatine and arcaine, antagonists for a polyamine site on the NMDA receptor, inhibited nociceptive behaviors induced by histamine.

Recently, a synthetic peptide corresponding to a sequence of the second extracellular loop of the human beta(1)-adrenoceptor (beta(1)-EC(II)) has been shown to produce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, myocyte apoptosis and cardiomyopathy in immunized rabbits. To study the direct cardiac effects of anti-beta(1)-EC(II) antibody in intact animals and if they are mediated via beta(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation, we administered IgG purified from beta(1)-EC(II)-immunized rabbits to recombination activating gene 2 knock-out (Rag2(-/-)) mice every 2 weeks with and without metoprolol treatment. Serial echocardiography and cardiac catheterization showed that beta(1)-EC(II) IgG reduced cardiac systolic function after 3 months. This was associated with increase in heart weight, myocyte apoptosis, activation of caspase-3, -9 and -12, and increased ER stress as evidenced by upregulation of GRP78 and CHOP and cleavage of ATF6. The Rag2(-/-) mice also exhibited increased phosphorylation of CaMKII and p38 MAPK. Metoprolol administration, which attenuated the phosphorylation of CaMKII and p38 MAPK, reduced the ER stress, caspase activation and cell death. Finally, we employed the small-interfering RNA technology to reduce caspase-12 in cultured rat cardiomyocytes. This reduced not only the increase of cleaved caspase-12 but also of the number of myocyte apoptosis produced by beta(1)-EC(II) IgG. Thus, we conclude that ER stress plays an important role in cell death and cardiac dysfunction in beta(1)-EC(II) IgG cardiomyopathy, and the effects of beta(1)-EC(II) IgG are mediated via the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor.",

To elucidate the mechanism of the elevated oral clearance, it was hypothesized that female hormones, at the high concentrations attainable during pregnancy, enhance hepatic metabolism of labetalol. Labetalol glucuronidation, which is the major elimination pathway of labetalol, was characterized by screening six recombinant human UGTs (UGT1A1, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B4, and 2B7) for their capacity to catalyse labetalol glucuronidation. The effect of female hormones (progesterone, oestradiol, oestriol, or oestrone) on the promoter activities of relevant UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) was investigated using a luciferase reporter assay in HepG2 cells. The involvement of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) was examined by co-transfecting ERalpha- or PXR-constructs. UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 were identified as the major UGT enzymes producing labetalol glucuronides (trace amount of glucuronide conjugate was formed by UGT1A9). The activities of the UGT1A1 promoter containing PXR response elements were enhanced by progesterone, but not by oestrogens, indicating PXR-mediated induction of UGT1A1 promoter activity by progesterone. Results from semi-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are consistent with the above findings. This effect of progesterone on UGT1A1 promoter activities was concentration dependent. Promoter activities of UGT2B7 were not affected by either oestrogens or progesterone. The results suggest a potential role for progesterone in regulating labetalol elimination by modulating the expression of UGT1A1, leading to enhanced drug metabolism during pregnancy.",

However, chronic repetitive administration of beta-adrenoceptor agonists may increase AHR, airway inflammation, and risk of death. Based upon the paradigm shift that occurred with the use of beta-blockers in congestive heart failure, we previously determined that chronic administration of beta-blockers decreased AHR in a murine model of asthma. To elucidate the mechanisms for the beneficial effects of beta-blockers, we examined the effects of chronic administration of several beta-adrenoceptor ligands in a murine model of allergic asthma. Administration of beta-blockers resulted in a reduction in total cell counts, eosinophils, and the cytokines IL-13, IL-10, IL-5, and TGF-beta1 in bronchoalveolar lavage, and attenuated epithelial mucin content and morphologic changes. The differences in mucin content also occurred if the beta-blockers were administered only during the ovalbumin challenge phase, but administration of beta-blockers for 7 days was not as effective as administration for 28 days. These results indicate that in a murine model of asthma, chronic administration of beta-blockers reduces inflammation and mucous metaplasia, cardinal features of asthma that may contribute to airflow obstruction and AHR.

The reservoir type TDDS containing a hydroxypropyl cellulose gel and polyethylene membrane was used as a control device. In comparison, the TDDS containing skin penetration enhancers, either 2-pyrrolidone or partially methylated beta cyclodextrin (PMbetaCD) were evaluated. The control device (no enhancer) produced about 52% inhibition of isoprenaline induced tachycardia at 2 h and the effect continued over 24 h application period, however, the devices with 2-pyrolidone or PMbetaCD produced about 85% inhibition of isoprenaline induced tachycardia at 3 h and the same effect continued over 24 h application period. Likewise, the AUC of these devices were significantly higher than that of control device. The intravenous bupranolol showed rapid decline in the pharmacodynamic effect with time indicating its rapid elimination. The in vivo delivery of bupranolol (as estimated by a mass balance study) from the devices made with pyrolidone or PMbetaCD was 3-fold higher than that of control.

The aim of this study is to determine if stable addition of a beta2-AR to a second neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), that normally expresses only alpha2A-ARs that are not sensitive to 300 nM EPI exposure, would suddenly render alpha2A-ARs in that cell line sensitive to treatment with the same EPI concentration.",

To distinguish among these possibilities, we examined rat neuronal nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Blockade of a large fraction of ACh activated alpha4beta4 or alpha4beta2 receptors by the open channel blocker hexamethonium failed to change the extent of potentiation by zinc, suggesting that zinc does not change the number of available receptors.

The open probability at 100 nM ACh (0.011 +/- 0.002) was increased 4.5-fold by 100 microM zinc (0.050 +/- 0.008), accounting for most of the potentiation observed at the whole cell level. The increase in open probability was due to an increase in burst duration, which increased from 207 +/- 38 ms in the absence of zinc to 830 +/- 189 ms in the presence of zinc. Our results suggest that potentiation of neuronal nAChRs by zinc is due to a stabilization of the bursting states of the receptor.",

The charts of 68 patients were reviewed retrospectively. The timing and diagnosis of the myocardial infarction, gender, age, type of surgery, type of anesthesia, diabetics, preoperative medical clearance, and deaths were recorded. A subgroup of patients who had significant bleeding perioperatively or postoperatively were compared with patients with no bleeding problems. From 1998 through 2006, there were 46,003 patients who had surgery and 68 perioperative infarcts. Of the 68 patients, 25 received perioperative beta blockers and 11 died. Of the 43 patients who did not receive beta blockers, 22 died. There was no statistically significant difference when the patients were analyzed for concomitant bleeding or nonbleeding with regards to survival and beta blockers.", 
    "205": "Hypertension is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is strongly implicated in these alterations. The possible beneficial effect of a centrally mediated sympathetic inhibition on the diastolic function in severe hypertension has never been studied. We have evaluated the cardiac effects (remodeling, diastolic and systolic functions) of a long-term treatment with a centrally acting drug, rilmenidine, in a model of severe renovascular hypertension.", 
    "206": "One-kidney, one-clip (1K,1C) Goldblatt hypertensive rabbits were randomized in two groups, one receiving rilmenidine (5 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks and the other treated with vehicle only. Hemodynamic effects and left ventricular (LV) remodeling were evaluated by serial tail cuff pressure measurements, and echocardiography every 15 days. These measurements were followed up with invasive hemodynamic measurements and histological analysis.", 
    "207": "Rilmenidine induced a decrease of 8% in blood pressure, a significant bradycardia (19% at 6 weeks after treatment) and an 18% reduction in LV mass, without reduction of ejection fraction (EF). These effects were accompanied by an improvement of the diastolic function, as shown by isovolumic relaxation time and decrease in Tau index, an E/A ratio reversion, and an Ea velocity increase. Moreover, reduction in the atrial (A) and atrial reverse (Ar) velocities, without any effect on LV filling pressures, was observed.", 
    "208": "In 1K,1C Goldblatt rabbits, which mimic most of the characteristics of human hypertensive cardiopathy, we have shown, for the first time, that a central inhibition of the SNS rapidly reverses cardiac hypertrophy and problems associated with primary LV relaxation, without negative inotropic action."
