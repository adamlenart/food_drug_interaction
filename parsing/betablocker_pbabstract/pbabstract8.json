    "0": "The selection and prioritization of pharmaceuticals and their transformation products for evaluating effects on the environment and human health is a challenging task. One common approach is based on compounds (e.g., mixture composition, concentrations), and another on biology (e.g., relevant endpoint, biological organizational level). Both of these approaches often resemble a Lernaean Hydra-they can create more questions than answers. The present study embraces this complexity, providing an integrated approach toward assessing the potential effects of transformation products of pharmaceuticals by means of mutagenicity, estrogenicity, and differences in the gene expression profiles. Mutagenicity using the tk kinase assay was applied to assess a list of 11 priority pharmaceuticals, namely, atenolol, azithromycin, carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, erythromycin, metoprolol, ofloxacin, propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim. The most mutagenic compounds were found to be \u03b2-blockers. In parallel, the photolabile pharmaceuticals were assessed for their mixture effects on mutagenicity (tk assay), estrogenicity (T47D- KBluc assay), and gene expression (microarrays). Interestingly, the mixtures were mutagenic at the \u00b5g/L level, indicating a synergistic effect. None of the photolysed mixtures were statistically significantly estrogenic. Gene expression profiling revealed effects related mainly to certain pathways, those of the p53 gene, mitogen-activated protein kinase, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, and translation-related (spliceosome). Fourteen phototransformation products are proposed based on the m/z values found through ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The transformation routes of the photolysed mixtures indicate a strong similarity with those obtained for each pharmaceutical separately. This finding reinforces the view that transformation products are to be expected in naturally occurring mixtures. Environ Toxicol Chem 2016;35:2753-2764. \u00a9 2016 SETAC.",

    "2": "Among the 28 771 patients from the High-Risk MI Database Initiative we identified 1573 patients with a baseline history of COPD. We evaluated the association between beta-blocker use at baseline (822 with beta-blocker and 751 without) on the rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. On univariable Cox analysis, beta-blocker use was found to be associated with lower rates of both all-cause [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.75, P < 0.0001] and cardiovascular mortality (HR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.78, P < 0.0001). After extensive adjustment for confounding, including 24 baseline covariates, COPD patients still benefited from beta-blocker usage (HR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.60-0.90, P = 0.002 for all-cause mortality; HR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.97, P = 0.025 for cardiovascular mortality). Adjusting for propensity scores (PS) constructed from the 24 aforementioned baseline characteristics provided similar results. In a cohort of 561 pairs of patients taking or not taking beta-blocker matched on PS using a 1:1 nearest-neighbour matching method, patients treated with beta-blocker experienced fewer all-cause deaths (HR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.56-0.89, P = 0.003) and cardiovascular deaths (HR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.97, P = 0.032).",

    "4": "Heart failure is a major public issue, and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the common etiologies of heart failure. DCM is generally progressive, and some patients with DCM need heart transplant despite optimal medical and mechanical therapy. Current guidelines recommend inhibitors of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, namely angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist as well as beta-blockers for the medical treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, including DCM. Furthermore, because they have beneficial effects on the outcome of heart failure in a dose-related fashion, they should be titrated to the target dose. In clinical practice, the underuse and under-dose of these agents matter; however, the efficacy and safety of supramaximal dose of ACE inhibitor or ARB have never been investigated in the patients with DCM. In this issue of ESC Heart Failure, it is demonstrated that benazepril or valsartan at supramaximal dose improved left ventricular function and reduced cardiovascular events compared with each drug at low dose, respectively. In this editorial, the current evidence concerning the use of ACE inhibitor or ARB in patients with HF and future prospective will be discussed.", 
    "5": "The use of the synthetic cathinones (\"bath salts\"), methylone and mephedrone, has been associated with the development of life-threatening hyperthermia. To date, no direct pharmacological intervention to mitigate the hyperthermia induced by synthetic cathinones has been identified. Here, we investigated the effects of the non-selective \u03b11 and \u03b2 adrenergic receptor antagonist carvedilol (5mg/kg ip) on established hyperthermia mediated by methylone and mephedrone (30mg/kg sc) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Methylone and mephedrone induced a hyperthermic response that peaked 60min post treatment. The administration of carvedilol 30min after methylone or mephedrone significantly attenuated these hyperthermic responses. Analysis of the Temperature Area Under the Curve (TAUC) demonstrated carvedilol significantly reduced the TAUC associated with methylone or mephedrone alone. The present study provides the first direct pharmacological intervention for the treatment of synthetic cathinone induced hyperthermia.",

Unfortunately, despite their wide range of application, the ssNMR experiments often suffer from low sensitivity and peaks overlapping between API and excipients. To overcome these limitations, the crosspolarization inversion recovery method was successfully used. The differences in the spin-lattice relaxation time constants for hydrogen atoms T1(H) between API and excipients were employed in order to separate and discriminate their peaks in ssNMR spectra as well as to increase the intensity of API signals in low-dose formulations. The versatility of this method was demonstrated by different examples, including the excipients mixture and commercial solid dosage forms (e.g. granules and tablets).", 
    "13": "Treatment of hypertensive patients with beta-blockers decreases central blood pressure (CBP) less than other antihypertensive drugs, which is believed to account for their lesser cardiovascular protection in this setting. Some authors have suggested that decreasing heart rate (HR) with beta-blockers would increase CBP. In contrast to beta-blockers, the anti-anginal agent ivabradine reduces HR without other hemodynamic effects, and represents an attractive tool for exploring the direct relationship between HR and CBP. Here, we review the available clinical data assessing the effect of selective HR reduction with ivabradine on CBP in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). We collected data from five studies which report either increase, decrease, or neutral effects of ivabradine on CBP. Further studies are needed to clarify the exact role of ivabradine on CBP. However, as supported by its pharmacodynamic effect in patients with stable CAD, available evidence to date suggests that ivabradine does not negatively impact CBP when associated with beta-blocker. HR reduction with both beta-blockers and ivabradine remains well-established treatments for the symptomatic treatment of angina patients.",

To solve those problems, a thermosensitive in situ gelling and mucoadhesive ophthalmic drug delivery system was prepared and evaluated, the system was composed of poloxamer analogs and polycarbophil (PCP) and betaxolol hydrochloride (BH) was selected as model drug. The concentrations of poloxamer 407 (P407) (22% (w/v)) and poloxamer 188 (P188) (3.5% (w/v)) were identified through central composite design-response surface methodology (CCD-RSM). The BH in situ hydrogel (BH-HG) was liquid solution at low temperature and turned to semisolid at eye temperature. BH-HG showed good stability and biocompatibility, which fulfilled the requirements of ocular application. In vitro studies indicated that addition of PCP enhanced the viscosity of BH-HG and the release results of BH from BH-HG demonstrated a sustained release behavior of BH because of the gel dissolution. In vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics studies indicated that the BH-HG formulation resulted in an improved bioavailability and a significantly lower intraocular pressure (IOP). The results suggested BH-HG could be potentially used as an in situ gelling system for ophthalmic delivery to enhance the bioavailability and efficacy.",

    "20": "Although noradrenaline and adrenaline are some of the most important neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, the effects of noradrenergic/adrenergic modulation on the striatum have not been determined. In order to explore the effects of adrenergic receptor (AR) agonists on the striatal firing patterns, we used optogenetic methods which can induce continuous firings. We employed transgenic rats expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in neurons. The medium spiny neuron showed a slow rising depolarization during the 1-s long optogenetic striatal photostimulation and a residual potential with 8.6-s half-life decay after the photostimulation. As a result of the residual potential, five repetitive 1-sec long photostimulations with 20-s onset intervals cumulatively increased the number of spikes. This 'firing increment', possibly relating to the timing control function of the striatum, was used to evaluate the AR modulation. The \u03b2-AR agonist isoproterenol decreased the firing increment between the 1st and 5th stimulation cycles, while the \u03b11-AR agonist phenylephrine enhanced the firing increment. Isoproterenol and adrenaline increased the early phase (0-0.5s of the photostimulation) firing response. This adrenergic modulation was inhibited by the \u03b2-antagonist propranolol. Conversely, phenylephrine and noradrenaline reduced the early phase response. \u03b2-ARs and \u03b11-ARs work in opposition controlling the striatal firing initiation and the firing increment.",

DESIGN Randomized, masked, controlled study. ANIMALS 103 dogs (180 eyes). PROCEDURES Pertinent history, signalment, and ophthalmic examination findings were recorded. Dogs received 1 drop of DHTM or sham treatment solution (sterile, buffered, isotonic eye drops) in both eyes 14 hours and 2 hours before anesthetic induction and at the time of corneal incision closure (ie, end of surgery); IOPs were assessed by rebound tonometry 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after surgery and between 7:30 and 8:00 am on the following day. Dogs with IOPs of 26 to 45 mm Hg received 1 drop of 0.005% latanoprost solution topically; the surgeon's treatment of choice was used for dogs with IOPs > 45 mm Hg. Incidence of POH and postoperative IOPs were compared between treatment groups. RESULTS DHTM treatment resulted in significantly lower incidence of POH than did sham treatment at the level of the dog (18/53 [34%] vs 31/50 [62%]) and the eye (24/94 [26%] vs 42/86 [48%]). Mean IOP did not differ between groups at the time of POH detection. The DHTM-treated eyes that developed POH were significantly more likely to have a 1-hour follow-up IOP < 25 mm Hg after latanoprost administration than were sham-treated eyes (19/25 [76%] vs 18/35 [51%]; OR, 3.87). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Multidose perioperative administration of DHTM in dogs undergoing phacoemulsification reduced the incidence of POH and improved responsiveness of POH to latanoprost treatment.", 
    "22": "Recent data suggests there are non-trivial amounts of human pharmaceutical conjugates potentially entering environmental surface waters. These compounds could contribute to eliciting toxic effects on aquatic biota either directly or indirectly, via de-conjugation. The need for developing a single method for quantifying both parents and conjugates is necessary. Propranolol (PRO), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and their respective major conjugates 4-OH-propranolol sulfate (PRO-Sul) and sulfamethoxazole-\u03b2-glucuronide (SMX-Glc) were successfully simultaneously extracted through weak anion exchange solid phase extraction cartridges from primary and secondary clarification wastewaters from the North End Winnipeg Water Pollution Treatment Plant in Winnipeg, Canada. Subsequent separation and quantification were achieved by reversed-phase C18 chromatography coupled to positive electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Linearity for all compounds throughout the 7-point calibration range was >0.99. Recovery RSD ranges across all matrices for PRO, SMX, PRO-Sul, and SMX-Glc were 2.1-13.2%, 2.3-10.2%, 9.8-19.2%, and 2.0-10.3% respectively. Primary and secondary filtrates respectively showed a significant increase of PRO from 0.039 to 0.045\u03bcg/L; a significant decrease for SMX from 1.56 to 0.58\u03bcg/L; significant decrease of PRO-Sul from 0.050 to 0.020\u03bcg/L; and a significant decrease of SMX-Glc from 0.41 to 0.019\u03bcg/L. These observations indicate that there was removal of all compounds, except for PRO, from the aqueous phase occurring at some point between the stages of treatment. To our knowledge, this is first study that simultaneously separated and quantified two different classes of parent compounds and two different kinds of human metabolite conjugates (glucuronide and sulfate) from a major urban wastewater treatment plant.", 
    "23": "Successive negative contrast (SNC) is an incentive relativity procedure that has been widely used to model emotional reactivity in rodents. The reward downshift experienced during SNC is thought to result in frustration. The exploration of a novel open field (OF), a complex situation involving stress induction and novelty detection, can enhance or block the acquisition of associative and non-associative memories. Previous experiments found a modulatory effect of OF, applied before downshift trials, on SNC. This schedule, however, can affect retention performance by influencing attentional, motivational, motor or sensory-perceptual mechanisms at training or retention testing. The use of post-training OF exposure avoids these confounds. This work assessed the effect of OF exposure after the acquisition of the downshifted memory, with the goal of targeting the consolidation of this mnemonic trace. We also investigated the involvement of the cholinergic and adrenergic systems in this phenomenon. The results indicated that OF facilitates recovery from reward loss and that both transmitter systems, cholinergic and adrenergic, play a role in this effect of OF.",

Here, we investigated the impact of visit-to-visit BP variability and average BP on the carotid artery remodelling progression in high-risk elderly according to different classes of antihypertension medication use/non-use. BP measurements and carotid ultrasound were performed in the common carotid artery in 164 subjects (mean age 79.7 years at baseline, 74.7% females) with one or more cardiovascular risk factors. Based on 12 visits (1 \u00d7 /month for 1 year), we calculated visit-to-visit BP variability expressed as the standard deviation (s.d.), coefficient of variation (CV), maximum BP, minimum BP and delta (maximum-minimum) BP. We measured mean intima-media thickness (IMT) as well as stiffness parameter \u03b2 were measured at baseline and at the mean 4.2-year follow-up. In a multiple regression analysis, the maximum, minimum, s.d. and average of systolic BP (SBP) were significantly associated with a change in \u03b2-values between the baseline and follow-up after adjustment for age, smoking, lower high-density lipoprotein level, baseline \u03b2-value and follow-up period. There were no significant associations between the visit-to-visit BP variability measures and the change in mean IMT. Significant associations of maximum, minimum, s.d. and average SBP were found with increased \u03b2-values in the subjects without calcium channel blocker (CCB) use and in the subjects using renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs). Thus, exaggerated visit-to-visit SBP variability and a high average SBP level were significant predictors of progression in carotid arterial stiffness in high-risk elderly without CCBs use and in those using a RASI.",

There is a great need for new treatment strategies, and a recent retrospective study showing a survival advantage with the use of beta blockers met with a very positive response. This systematic review summarizes the current state of knowledge and research on the topic: A database analysis identified six clinical studies showing inconsistent results with respect to the administration of beta blockers and disease course. The 13 preclinical studies identified showed almost without exception both that catecholamines had detrimental effects on tumour progression, and that these effects could be influenced by pharmacological blockade. Overall the available evidence does not justify the use of beta blockers in clinical practice for ovarian carcinoma at the present time. This article also outlines details of research design required for further studies needed on the subject. Preclinical research findings are however very impressive: They not only form an important basis for the development of future clinical studies but also, through revealing new pathomechanisms, they already make an important contribution towards the development of new treatment strategies for ovarian carcinoma.",

    "40": "The endogenous gasotransmitter hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is an important regulator of the cardiovascular system, particularly of myocardial function. Moreover, H2S exhibits cardioprotective activity against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) or hypoxic injury, and is considered an important mediator of \"ischemic preconditioning\", through activation of mitochondrial potassium channels, reduction of oxidative stress, activation of the endogenous \"anti-oxidant machinery\" and limitation of inflammatory responses. Accordingly, H2S-donors, i.e. pro-drugs able to generate exogenous H2S, are viewed as promising therapeutic agents for a number of cardiovascular diseases. The novel H2S-donor 4-carboxy phenyl-isothiocyanate (4CPI), whose vasorelaxing effects were recently reported, was tested here in different experimental models of myocardial I/R. In Langendorff-perfused rat hearts subjected to I/R, 4CPI significantly improved the post-ischemic recovery of myocardial functional parameters and limited tissue injury. These effects were antagonized by 5-hydroxydecanoic acid (a blocker of mitoKATP channels). Moreover, 4CPI inhibited the formation of reactive oxygen species. We found the whole battery of H2S-producing enzymes to be present in myocardial tissue: cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE), cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST). Notably, 4CPI down-regulated the post-ischemic expression of CSE. In Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts, 4CPI reduced the post-ischemic release of norepinephrine and the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. In both rat and mouse hearts, 4CPI did not affect the degranulation of resident mast cells. In isolated rat cardiac mitochondria, 4CPI partially depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential; this effect was antagonized by ATP (i.e., the physiological inhibitor of KATP channels). Moreover, 4CPI abrogated calcium uptake in the mitochondrial matrix. Finally, in an in vivo model of acute myocardial infarction in rats, 4CPI significantly decreased I/R-induced tissue injury. In conclusion, H2S-donors, and in particular isothiocyanate-based H2S-releasing drugs like 4CPI, can actually be considered a suitable pharmacological option in anti-ischemic therapy.", 
    "41": "It is generally believed that topical administration of eye drops safeguards against harmful systemic effects. However, about 80% of the drug in the ophthalmic products is systemically absorbed and the first-pass metabolism is avoided. Ophthalmic timolol is widely prescribed in the treatment of glaucoma either alone or in the combination eye drop products, many of which have been launched fairly recently. Ophthalmic timolol may cause serious adverse effects such as symptomatic bradycardia, various conduction disorders in the heart, orthostatic hypotension, syncope and falls. Areas covered: In this review we document a number of factors associated with the properties of ophthalmic timolol and specific features of a patient, which may jeopardize patient's cardiac safety even after topical treatment. Expert opinion: Plasma timolol levels are correlated with cardiovascular adverse effects in patients, since timolol is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme in the liver.

End points included in-hospital MACE (myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, congestive heart failure) and 30-day mortality. Possible covariates identified on univariate analysis (P\u00a0< .2) were entered into a multivariable model, and stepwise elimination identified the best subset of predictors.

Management with propranolol was well tolerated in all and did not modify peripheral blood flow, O2-saturation, electrocardiographic PR-interval and left ventricular fractional shortening or ejection fraction. Absolute blood pressure levels were similar without and with propranolol. However, age-adjusted centile levels for both systolic and diastolic levels were significantly lower while on propranolol. The heart rate was significantly lower both when expressed as absolute value and when expressed as age-adjusted centile on treatment with propranolol. In conclusion, propranolol 2 mg/kg of body weight daily causes a statistically though not clinically relevant decrease in blood pressure and heart rate in cardially healthy infants affected by infantile hemangioma.

Extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying and testing strategies to achieve this end, but little consensus has been reached on a common and shared operability.Timing, dose and mode of chemotherapy administration play a crucial role in the development of acute or late myocardial dysfunction. Primary prevention initiatives cover a wide area that ranges from conventional heart failure drugs, such as \u03b2-blockers and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists to nutritional supplementation and physical training. Additional studies on the pathophysiology and cellular mechanisms of anticancer-drug-related CTX will enable the introduction of novel therapies.We present various typologies of prevention strategies, describing the approaches that have already been used and those that could be effective on the basis of a better understanding of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic CTX mechanisms.",

By blocking the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine using \u03b1- or \u03b2-blockers, we hoped to reduce the degree of chronic stress symptoms exhibited by newly captured house sparrows. We measured corticosterone, heart rate and heart rate variability in 24 house sparrows (Passer domesticus) over the first week of captivity. The birds were treated with saline, propranolol (a \u03b2-blocker) or phentolamine (an \u03b1-blocker) for the first 3\u00a0days of captivity. We also compared newly captured animals with animals that had been held in captivity for 1\u00a0month. During the first week of captivity, baseline corticosterone increased, but that increase was blocked by propranolol. Heart rate was not different between the treatment groups, but it was higher during the first week than after 1\u00a0month in captivity. Sympathetic nervous system activity (as measured by heart rate variability) decreased over the first week of captivity, but was not affected by treatment. \u03b2-Blockers, but not \u03b1-blockers, might help to improve some symptoms of chronic stress in newly captured animals.",

Expression profile of genes encoding for ER\u03b1 (ESR1), ER\u03b2 (ESR2), and GPER was GPER > ESR1 > ESR2. As to the endothelial mechanisms, endothelium removal, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, and indomethacin, did not modify the relaxant responses to bazedoxifene. As to the K channels, both a high-K medium and the Kv blocker, 4-aminopyridine, inhibited the bazedoxifene-induced relaxations, whereas tetraethylammonium (nonselective K channel blocker), glibenclamide (selective KATP blocker) or iberiotoxin (selective KCa blocker) were without effect. Bazedoxifene also inhibited both Ca- and Bay K8644-elicited contractions. Therefore, bazedoxifene induces endothelium-independent relaxations of cerebral arteries through (1) activation of GPER and ER\u03b1 receptors; (2) increase of K conductance through Kv channels; and (3) inhibition of Ca entry through L-type Ca channels. Such a profile is compatible with the beneficial effects of estrogenic compounds (eg, SERMs) on vascular function and, specifically, that concerning the brain.

However, limited information is available about recent trends in the prescribing of evidence-based medical therapies in these patients, especially from a population-based perspective. We describe decade-long trends in the discharge prescribing of aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2 blockers, and statins in hospital survivors of AMI. The study population consisted of 5,253 patients who were discharged from all 11\u00a0hospitals in central Massachusetts after AMI in 6 biennial periods from 2001 to 2011. Combination medical therapy (CMT) was defined as the prescription of all 4 cardiac medications at hospital discharge. The average age of this patient population was 69.2\u00a0years and 57.7% were men. Significant increases were observed in the use of CMT, from 25.6% in 2001 to 48.7% in 2011, with increases noted for each of the individual cardiac medications examined. Subgroup analysis also showed improvement in discharge prescriptions for P2Y12 inhibitors in patients who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention. Presence of a do-not-resuscitate order, before co-morbidities, hospitalization for non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, admission to a nonteaching hospital, and failure to undergo cardiac catheterization or a percutaneous coronary intervention were associated with underuse of CMT. In conclusion, our study demonstrates encouraging trends in the prescribing of evidence-based medications at hospital discharge for AMI. However, certain patient subgroups continue to be at risk for underuse of CMT, suggesting the need for strategies to enhance compliance with current practice guidelines.",

As higher heart rate predicts worse outcomes in cardiovascular disease, we hypothesized that tachycardia and nonuse of \u03b2 blockers are associated with increased mortality after HT. All patients who underwent HT at our institution from 1987 to 2010 were included. The association of heart rate 3\u00a0months after HT and \u03b2-blocker use during follow-up to mortality was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses adjusting for clinically relevant baseline variables. From 1987 to 2010, there were 493 HT. After excluding 29 who died within 3\u00a0months and 3 with follow-up <3\u00a0months, 461 HT recipients (50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0years; 20% women) were included. Over a follow-up of 12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0years, selected important univariate predictors of post-HT mortality were older age, male gender, higher body mass index, ischemic cardiomyopathy, longer post-HT intensive care unit stay, and hospitalization and at 3\u00a0months, increased mean pulmonary artery pressure, right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary occlusion pressure, higher heart rate, and nonuse of \u03b2 blockers during follow-up.

Endothelin (ET)-1, a potent vasoconstrictor and pro-inflammatory peptide, is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of ALI in a rat model of sepsis. Here, we investigated whether landiolol hydrochloride, an ultra-short-acting \u03b2-blocker, plays a crucial role in ameliorating and attenuating LPS-induced ALI through modulation of the ET-1 system. Male Wistar rats at 8weeks of age were administered with either saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for three hours (3h) and some of the LPS-administered rats were continuously treated with landiolol for 3h. ALI was induced by LPS, including levels of both circulatory and pulmonary TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 but [PaO2] was significantly decreased. LPS also induced a significant increase in levels of pulmonary ET-1 and ET-A receptor, but levels of ET-B receptor, which has vasodilating effects, were remarkably diminished. Further, LPS administration upregulated the pulmonary expression of HIF-1\u03b1. Finally, the treatment of LPS-administered rats with landiolol for 3h ameliorated and prevented ALI, normalized the altered levels of pulmonary ET-1 and ET-A receptors. Landiolol also induced significant down-regulation of ET-B receptor in lung tissues in the early hours (phase) of sepsis. However, Landiolol treatment had no effect on the up-regulated inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) in both plasma and lung tissues during sepsis, and expression of pulmonary HIF-1\u03b1 also remained unchanged after landiolol treatment. Collectively, these data led us to conclude that landiolol may ameliorate sepsis-induced ALI via the pulmonary ET system.",

    "112": "There has been an increasing demand for rapid and sensitive techniques for the identification and quantification of pharmaceutical compounds in human biofluids during the past few decades, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is one of a number of physicochemical techniques with the potential to meet these demands. In this study we have developed a SERS-based analytical approach for the assessment of human biofluids in combination with chemometrics. This novel approach has enabled the detection and quantification of the \u03b2-blocker propranolol spiked into human serum, plasma, and urine at physiologically relevant concentrations. A range of multivariate statistical analysis techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA), principal component-discriminant function analysis (PC-DFA) and partial least-squares regression (PLSR) were employed to investigate the relationship between the full SERS spectral data and the level of propranolol. The SERS spectra when combined with PCA and PC-DFA demonstrated clear differentiation of neat biofluids and biofluids spiked with varying concentrations of propranolol ranging from 0 to 120 \u03bcM, and clear trends in ordination scores space could be correlated with the level of propranolol. Since PCA and PC-DFA are categorical classifiers, PLSR modeling was subsequently used to provide accurate propranolol quantification within all biofluids with high prediction accuracy (expressed as root-mean-square error of predictions) of 0.58, 9.68, and 1.69 for serum, plasma, and urine respectively, and these models also had excellent linearity for the training and test sets between 0 and 120 \u03bcM. The limit of detection as calculated from the area under the naphthalene ring vibration from propranolol was 133.1 ng/mL (0.45 \u03bcM), 156.8 ng/mL (0.53 \u03bcM), and 168.6 ng/mL (0.57 \u03bcM) for serum, plasma, and urine, respectively. This result shows a consistent signal irrespective of biofluid, and all are well within the expected physiological level of this drug during therapy. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of SERS application as a diagnostic screening method, following further validation and optimization to improve detection of pharmaceutical compounds and quantification in human biofluids, which may open up new exciting opportunities for future use in various biomedical and forensic applications.",

Fast correction of hypoxemia could be obtained by decreasing native LV flow by infusion of a short-acting beta-blocker (esmolol). Our purpose was to retrospectively review the efficacy of esmolol in this situation and hypothesize on the potential mechanisms of action and the associated risks. This is a retrospective analysis of five clinical cases, who underwent lung transplantation and a femoro-femoral venoarterial (VA) ECLS. The patients presented severe hypoxemia (SpO2 < 85%) measured through photoplethysmography on a right hand finger.

Mechanical ventilation and VA ECLS function variables were optimized and unchanged before and after esmolol injection. All patients had terminal respiratory failure with pulmonary hypertension and conserved LV systolic function. Immediately following esmolol injection (1.3 \u00b1 .7 mg/kg; mean \u00b1 1 SD), SpO2 increased from 73% \u00b1 12 to 95% \u00b1 6; blood to arterial partial pressure in CO2 (PaCO2) decreased from 52 \u00b1 18 to 35 \u00b1 7 mmHg systolic pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 61 \u00b1 8 to 50 \u00b1 12 mmHg; the pulmonary artery oxygen saturation (SvO2); increased from 51% \u00b1 24 to 77% \u00b1 12; systemic arterial pressure or catecholamine requirements were unchanged. In conclusion, these results suggest that injection of esmolol allowed rapid correction of regional hypoxemia occurring during lung transplantation despite femoro-femoral VA ECLS. The mechanism is probably a decreased cardiac output of the native LV due to esmolol-induced negative inotropic and chronotropic effects without significant adverse effects on systemic tissue perfusion.",

Reproducible induction of arrhythmia during exercise allows titration and monitoring of the dose of beta-blockers. When there is evidence of incomplete protection (recurrence of syncope or complex arrhythmias during exercise) with beta blockers, flecainide (100-300 mg/day) should be added. Beta-blockers and flecainide are also indicated for affected individuals who have experienced a previous aborted sudden death. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) may be necessary for those with recurrent cardiac arrest while on beta-blocker therapy or for those unable to take beta-blockers. Pharmacologic therapy should be maintained/optimized even in individuals with an ICD in order to reduce the probability of ICD firing. Left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) can be considered in those who are refractory to other therapies or in those who are intolerant of or have contraindications to beta-blocking therapy; however, given the side effects and recurrence of cardiac events associated with LCSD, pharmacologic therapy should always be optimized prior to considering LCSD. Prevention of primary manifestations: Beta-blockers are indicated for all clinically affected individuals, and for individuals with pathogenic variants in one of the genes associated with CPVT with a negative exercise stress test, since sudden death can be the first manifestation of the disease. Flecainide can be added for primary prevention of a cardiac arrest when beta-blockers alone cannot control the onset of arrhythmias during exercise stress test. Prevention of secondary complications: To avoid exacerbation of allergic asthma, a cardiac-specific beta-blocker, metoprolol, may be used; the dose should be individualized. Anticoagulation may be necessary for some persons with an ICD. Surveillance: Follow-up visits with a cardiologist every six to twelve months (depending on disease severity) to monitor the efficacy of therapy; the limit for any allowed physical activity can be defined on the basis of exercise stress test done in the hospital setting; the use of commercially available heart rate monitoring devices for sports participation can be helpful in keeping the heart rate in a safe range during physical activity but should not be considered as an alternative to medical follow-up visits. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Competitive sports and other strenuous exercise; digitalis. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Because treatments and surveillance are available to reduce morbidity and mortality, first-degree relatives of a proband should be offered molecular genetic testing if the family-specific pathogenic variant(s) are known; if the family-specific variant(s) are not known, all first-degree relatives of an affected individual should be evaluated with resting ECG, Holter monitoring, and, most importantly, with exercise stress testing.", 
    "129": "Autosomal dominant CPVT: CALM1- and RYR2-related CPVT are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant CPVT has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Autosomal recessive CPVT:CASQ2- and TRDN-related CPVT are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an affected child are obligate heterozygotes (i.e., carriers of one pathogenic variant). Minor abnormalities (rare and benign arrhythmias) have been reported in heterozygotes in anecdotal cases. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a heterozygote. Once the CPVT-related pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible options.", 
    "130": "The treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection (HFrEF) is changing rapidly. Advances over the past several decades have focused on blocking the adverse effects of neurohormonal activation. This approach has resulted in marked improvement in outcomes in the HFrEF population. Despite these advances, however, mortality and morbidity remain high and HFrEF patients have poor quality of life. New approaches to therapy now offer additional benefits. Combined neprilysin inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade using sacubitril-valsartan (LCZ696) has been shown to be superior to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in HFrEF patients. Compared with enalapril, treatment with LCZ696 was associated with significant reductions in the composite of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalization, both components of this composite endpoint and all-cause mortality. Another approach that has been shown to be effective is the use of ivabradine, an agent that blocks If channels in the sinus node to reduce heart rate. When added to standard therapy (that included a \u03b2-blocker in 89% of patients) in symptomatic HFrEF patients who were in sinus rhythm, ivabradine significantly reduced combined cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalizations. Death from heart failure, all-cause hospitalization, and heart failure hospitalization were also significantly reduced when ivabradine was added to the medical regimen. Thus, both LCZ696 and ivabradine represent significant advances in the therapy of HFrEF. Utilization of these drugs in the growing HFrEF population will benefit millions of patients around the world.",

Neither adenosine nor electric cardioversion could terminate the tachycardia, therefore intravenous esmolol (\u03b2-receptor blocker) was initiated. Inspite of subsequent administration of various antiarrhythmic medications in increasingly higher doses, repeated supraventricular tachycardic episodes occurred. The electrocardiogram showed typical findings of a multifocal atrial tachycardia as the underlying cause. When tachycardic episodes occurred, they also presented as atrial flutter at 460\u2009bpm and a 2:1 block. Finally, high dosage of amiodarone (10\u2009mg/kgbw/d) led to continuous control of the heart rate without tachycardic episodes. To date our patient is mostly in sinus rhythm but without tachycardic episodes and doing well.",

The present investigation tested the effects of beta-blocker use and chronological age on the associations between CMV and immunity in adults aged 60-91 (N=98; 69% CMV seropositive) who were administered the trivalent influenza vaccine for up to 5years. Peak antibody response, corrected for baseline, and spring (persistent) antibody response, corrected for peak, were assessed, as well as beta-2 microglobulin (\u03b22\u03bc) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In multi-level models with years at Level 1 and people at Level 2, CMV serostatus did not predict peak antibody response, but there was a 3-way interaction between CMV serostatus, age, and beta-blockers. Age was negatively associated with peak antibody, but only among adults who were CMV seropositive and taking beta-blockers. CMV seronegative adults who were not taking beta-blockers had the highest antibody persistence. CMV serostatus was not associated with \u03b22\u03bc or IL-6. Results suggest that CMV+ serostatus may negatively compromise antibody response to a greater degree than inflammatory markers in older adults. Furthermore, older adults who take beta-blockers may be more vulnerable to negative effects of age and CMV on peak antibody response, perhaps by virtue of their underlying health condition.",

    "137": "To date, non-selective beta blockers (NSBBs) are a cornerstone in the treatment of portal hypertension. During the last years, our understanding of the potential benefits of early initiation of NSBB treatment, their effects beyond the prevention of variceal bleeding (i.e., their non-hemodyamic effects), as well as potential detrimental effects in patients with advanced disease has continuously evolved. In addition, we have learned that not all NSBBs are equal. Due to its additional anti-\u03b11-adrenergic activity, carvedilol has been shown to be more potent in decreasing portal pressure, but might lead to more pronounced decreases in systemic arterial pressure, when compared to conventional NSBBs. It might be particularly beneficial in 'early' portal hypertension, when potential detrimental effects on systemic hemodynamics are less critical. In contrast, there is increasing evidence that the use of carvedilol or high NSBB doses should be carefully scrutinized in patients with severe or refractory ascites. Our review summarizes the current knowledge on the use of NSBBs for preventing variceal bleeding and other decompensating events and provides guidance for their safe use in hemodynamically 'vulnerable' patient populations.

The dilatation was significantly reduced by endothelium denudation or by L-NAME (inhibitor of NO synthase) or by SQ22536 (adenylyl cyclase blocker). Dilatation of BA was also affected by beta-2 receptor blockade with butoxamine, but not by the guanylate cyclase blocker ODQ. Interestingly, beta-1 blockade by atenolol inhibited nebivolol-induced dilation. Also, the BKCa channel blocker iberiotoxin and KCa channel inhibitor TEA significantly reduced nebivolol-induced dilation. Nebivolol significantly reduced smooth muscle Ca2+ level, which correlated with the increases in diameters and moreover it reversed the hemolysed blood-induced constriction of BA.",

It has long been clinically used to treat cerebrovascular and cardiovascular illnesses. However, there is little information available on whether the role of bisoprolol in the attenuation of ventricular remodeling is dependent upon the achievement of a target dose, and whether it must be used as a preferred option. The aim of the present study was to clarify the underlying benefits of bisoprolol in the attenuation of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis at different doses. C57BL/6J male mice, aged 6-8 weeks, were treated with saline or one of three different doses of bisoprolol (Biso: 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks from day 1 after aortic banding (AB). A number of mice underwent sham surgery and were treated with saline or bisoprolol. The mice were randomly assigned into the sham (n=24) and AB (n=62) groups. The results revealed that bisoprolol had a protective role against the cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and dysfunction caused by AB. This was determined on the basis of heart/body and lung/body weight ratios and heart weight/tibia length ratios, as well as echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters, histological analysis, and the gene expression levels of hypertrophic and fibrotic markers. The present study revealed that administration of bisoprolol for a long time period may enhance its role in the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis induced by AB, whereas no statistically significant difference was observed between the middle- and high-doses. These observations indicated that the function of bisoprolol in protecting against cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and dysfunction is time-dependent. Furthermore, it is proposed that a middle dose of bisoprolol may be a better option for patients with cardiovascular illnesses, particularly those undertaking coronary artery bypass graft and cardiac pacemaker surgeries. These promising results require further clinical investigation.",

However, the role of vestibular signals in the changes in muscle and bone induced by gravity changes remains unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of vestibular lesions (VL) on the changes in muscle and bone induced by 3\u00a0g hypergravity for 4\u00a0weeks in C57BL/6J mice. Quantitative computed tomography analysis revealed that hypergravity increased muscle mass surrounding the tibia and trabecular bone mineral content, adjusting for body weight in mice. Hypergravity did not affect cortical bone and fat masses surrounding the tibia. Vestibular lesions blunted the increases in muscle and bone masses induced by hypergravity. Histological analysis showed that hypergravity elevated the cross-sectional area of myofiber in the soleus muscle. The mRNA levels of myogenic genes such as MyoD, Myf6, and myogenin in the soleus muscle were elevated in mice exposed to hypergravity. Vestibular lesions attenuated myofiber size and the mRNA levels of myogenic differentiation markers enhanced by hypergravity in the soleus muscle.

    "176": "The inhalatory route has emerged as an interesting non-invasive alternative for drug delivery. This allows both pulmonary (local) and systemic treatments (via alveolar absorption). Further advantages in terms of stability, dose and patient preference have often lead researchers to focus on dry powder inhaler delivery systems. Atenolol is an antihypertensive drug with low oral bioavailability and gastrointestinal side effects. Because atenolol possesses adequate permeation across human epithelial membranes, it has been proposed as a good candidate for inhalatory administration. In a previous work, atenolol was combined with alginic acid (AA) and microparticles were developed using spray-drying (SD) technology. Different AA/atenolol ratios, total feed solid content and operative variables were previously explored. In order to improve particle quality for inhalatory administration and the SD yield, in this work the AA acid groups not neutralized by atenolol were kept either free or neutralized to pH\u223c7 and two different SD cyclones were used. Particle morphology, flow properties, moisture uptake and in vitro aerosolization behavior at different pressure drops were studied. When the AA acid groups were neutralized, particle size decreased as a consequence of the lower feed viscosity. The SD yield and in vitro particle deposition significantly increased when a high performance cyclone was employed, and even when lactose carrier particles were not used. Although the in vitro particle deposition decreased when the storage relative humidity increased, the developed SD powders showed adequate characteristics to be administered by inhalatory route up to storage relative humidities of about 60%.",

The presence of pathogenic microorganisms and potentially toxic organic micropollutants does not allow a direct reuse of urban effluents. Membrane processes such reverse osmosis (RO) or nanofiltration (NF) can be considered to effectively eliminate these pollutants. The integration of membrane processes involves the production of concentrated retentates which require being disposed. To date, no treatment is set up to manage safely this pollution. This work focuses on the application of ozonation for the treatment of NF retentates in the framework of the wastewater reuse. Ozonation is a powerful oxidation process able to react and degrade a wide range of organic pollutants. Four pharmaceutical micropollutants were selected as target molecules: acetaminophen, carbamazepine, atenolol and diatrozic acid. This study highlighted that NF represents a viable alternative to the commonly used RO process ensuring high retention at much lower operating costs. Ozonation appears to be effective to degrade the most reactive pollutants toward molecular ozone but is limited for the reduction of refractory ozone pollutants due to the inhibition of the radical chain by the high content of organic matter in the retentates. The ozonation process appears to be a promising NF retentate treatment, but additional treatments after ozonation are required to lead to a zero liquid discharge treatment scheme.",

    "217": "Psychomotor stimulants are frequently used by humans to intensify the subjective experience of different types of social interactions. Since psychomotor stimulants enhance metabolism and increase body temperatures, their use under conditions of physiological activation and in warm humid environments could result in pathological hyperthermia, a life-threatening symptom of acute drug intoxication. Here, we will describe the brain hyperthermic effects of MDMA, MDPV, and methylone, three structurally related recreational drugs commonly used by young adults during raves and other forms of social gatherings. After a short introduction on brain temperature and basic mechanisms underlying its physiological fluctuations, we will consider how MDMA, MDPV, and methylone affect brain and body temperatures in awake freely moving rats. Here, we will discuss the role of drug-induced heat production in the brain due to metabolic brain activation and diminished heat dissipation due to peripheral vasoconstriction as two primary contributors to the hyperthermic effects of these drugs. Then, we will consider how the hyperthermic effects of these drugs are modulated under conditions that model human drug use (social interaction and warm ambient temperature). Since social interaction results in brain and body heat production, coupled with skin vasoconstriction that impairs heat loss to the external environment, these physiological changes interact with drug-induced changes in heat production and loss, resulting in distinct changes in the hyperthermic effects of each tested drug. Finally, we present our recent data, in which we compared the efficacy of different pharmacological strategies for reversing MDMA-induced hyperthermia in both the brain and body. Specifically, we demonstrate increased efficacy of the centrally acting atypical neuroleptic compound clozapine over the peripherally acting vasodilator drug, carvedilol. These data could be important for understanding the potential dangers of MDMA in humans and the development of pharmacological tools to alleviate drug-induced hyperthermia - potentially saving the lives of highly intoxicated individuals.",

Indeed, agents that target the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) have transformed the way in which we manage heart failure. Despite this, mortality in heart failure is poorer than in many malignancies and a large burden of morbidity and recurrent hospitalisation remains. Here, we review the role of RAAS modulation within the field of systolic heart failure. In particular, we provide practical guidance on using current RAAS blockade agents and focus on the recent emergence of new agents that promise additional substantial benefit to those living with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.",

In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed 64,549 adults without congestive heart failure or atrial fibrillation (54 \u00b1 13\u00a0years old, 46% women, 29% black) who underwent clinician-referred exercise stress testing at a single health care system in Detroit, Michigan from 1991 to 2009, with median follow-up of 10.6\u00a0years for all-cause mortality (interquartile range 7.7 to 14.7\u00a0years). Using Cox regression models, we assessed the effect of BBT, ppMHR, and estimated exercise capacity on mortality, with adjustment for demographic data, medical history, pertinent medications, and propensity to be on BBT. There were 9,259 deaths during follow-up. BBT was associated with an 8% lower adjusted achieved ppMHR (91% in no BBT vs 83% in BBT). ppMHR was inversely associated with all-cause mortality but with significant attenuation by BBT (per 10% ppMHR HR: no BBT: 0.80 [0.78 to 0.82] vs BBT: 0.89 [0.87 to 0.92]). Patients on BBT who achieved 65% ppMHR had a similar adjusted mortality rate as those not on BBT who achieved 85% ppMHR (p >0.05). Estimated exercise capacity further attenuated the prognostic value of ppMHR (per-10%-ppMHR HR: no BBT: 0.88 [0.86 to 0.90] vs BBT: 0.95 [0.93 to 0.98]). In conclusion, the prognostic value of ppMHR was significantly attenuated by BBT. For patients on BBT, a lower threshold of 65% ppMHR may be considered for determining worsened prognosis. Estimated exercise capacity further diminished the prognostic value of ppMHR particularly in patients on BBT.", 
    "224": "We conducted a discovery genome-wide association study with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) annotation of new-onset diabetes (NOD) among European Americans, who were exposed to a calcium channel blocker-based strategy (CCB strategy) or a \u03b2-blocker-based strategy (\u03b2-blocker strategy) in the INternational VErapamil SR Trandolapril STudy. Replication of the top signal from the SNP*treatment interaction analysis was attempted in Hispanic and African Americans, and a joint meta-analysis was performed (total 334 NOD cases and 806 matched controls). PLEKHH2 rs11124945 at 2p21 interacted with antihypertensive exposure for NOD (meta-analysis P=5.3 \u00d7 10(-)(8)). rs11124945 G allele carriers had lower odds for NOD when exposed to the \u03b2-blocker strategy compared with the CCB strategy (Odds ratio OR=0.38(0.24-0.60), P=4.0 \u00d7 10(-)(5)), whereas A/A homozygotes exposed to the \u03b2-blocker strategy had increased odds for NOD compared with the CCB strategy (OR=2.02(1.39-2.92), P=2.0 \u00d7 10(-)(4)). eQTL annotation of the 2p21 locus provides functional support for regulating gene expression.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 27 September 2016; doi:10.1038/tpj.2016.67.", 
    "225": "Prior studies have demonstrated the efficacy of non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) in preventing first variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. However, little is known about the overall effectiveness of NSBB in routine clinical care.", 
    "226": "We conducted a retrospective cohort study of cirrhotic patients without prior bleeding who initiated a NSBB (propranolol, nadolol) at any Veterans Administration facility between 2008 and 2013. The primary outcome was variceal bleeding within 12 months. We conducted Cox-proportional hazards analyses to identify demographic, clinical, and NSBB-related (type of NSBB, mean dose, dose change, and heart rate response) factors associated with variceal bleeding.", 
    "227": "Of 5,775 patients, 678 (11.7%) developed variceal bleeding. Mean daily dose of NSBB was <40\u2009mg in 58.8%, 18.1% had either upward or downward titration in NSBB dose, and 9.8% had hemodynamic response. Patients who were younger, with ascites, greater medical comorbidity, and higher MELD (Model for end-stage liver disease) scores had a higher risk of variceal bleeding. Patients on a higher daily dose (>60 vs. <40\u2009mg, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51-0.81), who had either upward or downward dose titration (adjusted HR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.52-0.90 and 0.64; 95% CI 0.45-0.90, respectively), and those who achieved hemodynamic response (adjusted HR 0.75; 95% CI=0.57-1.0) had lower risk.", 
    "228": "Approximately 12% of patients bled while being on NSBB for primary prophylaxis. A higher NSBB dose and dose titration were protective; yet most patients did not have the NSBB dose titrated to the recommended levels. Our data highlight the need for careful monitoring of cirrhotic patients on NSBB."
