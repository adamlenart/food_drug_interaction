    "0": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether beta-adrenergic receptor blockade inhibits glycogen utilization in rats during exercise. Propranolol (1 mg/kg body wt) completely blocked the glycogenolytic effect of a large dose of epinephrine given by injection but did not prevent glycogen breakdown in skeletal muscle or liver during a bout of treadmill exercise. On the contrary, exercise resulted in greater glycogen depletion in plantaris muscles of beta-blocked rats than in those of control rats, probably as a result of decreased availability of fatty acids. Increasing the availability of exogenous substrates slowed the rate of skeletal muscle glycogen depletion during exercise. However, even with increased availability of exogenous substrates, beta-blockade did not result in reduced utilization of skeletal muscle or liver glycogen. In contrast to its effect on skeletal muscle, beta-blockade markedly reduced glycogen depletion in the heart during exercise. We conclude that beta-adrenergic stimulation is of major importance in mediating glycogenolysis in the heart but is not necessary for glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle or liver during prolonged exercise.", 
    "1": "1 The antagonist potencies of labetalol and each of its four stereoisomers have been compared at alpha 1-, beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in anaesthetized dogs and in isolated tissues. 2 The RR stereoisomer is a potent, non-selective antagonist at beta-adrenoceptors but has only weak alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity. 3 The SR stereoisomer was the most potent antagonist at alpha 1-adrenoceptors, and it also had similar potency as an antagonist at beta-adrenoceptors. 4 The alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking profile of the RS stereoisomer is intermediate between that of the RR and SR, but the SS stereoisomer is a relatively weak antagonist at both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. 5 It is concluded that, although most of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity of labetalol is attributable to the SR stereoisomer and nearly all of its beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity resides in the RR stereoisomer, each of the stereoisomers contributes to the overall pharmacological profile of labetalol.", 
    "2": "1 Atenolol 0.2 mg/kg i.v., propranolol 0.2 mg/kg i.v. or placebo were given in a double-blind crossover study to six healthy male subjects, and the effects of a subsequent infusion of epoprostenol (prostacyclin, PGI2) 0-6 ng kg-1 min-1 monitored. 2 PGI2 caused a tachycardia, a fall in diastolic blood pressure, a rise in pulse pressure, reduction in pre-ejection period (PEP) and rise in left ventricular ejection time index (LVETI), headache and facial flushing at doses of PGI2 greater than 2 ng kg-1 min-1,, (P less than 0.05). 3 Beta-adrenoceptor blockade did not prevent the tachycardia in response to PGI2, and did not interact with any of the other dynamic effects of PGI2. 4 In vitro, PGI2 at 1 and 2 ng/ml inhibited platelet aggregation to ADP (P less than 0.01), although no significant effect on platelet aggregation was seen in the in vivo study. Atenolol and propranolol at a final concentration of 1 microgram/ml did not affect this in vitro study. Atenolol and propranolol at a final concentration of 1 microgram/ml did not affect in vitro effect of PGI2 on platelet aggregation. 5 Pretreatment with atropine 0.04 mg/kg i.v. in three subjects did not attenuate the tachycardia caused by PGI2 infusion, even though the baseline heart rate was increased. 6 Adverse effects to PGI2 infusion included sudden bradycardia, pallor and sweating, suggesting that the Bezold-Jarisch reflex seen in animals in response to PGI2 may also occur in humans. 7 Neither increased sympathetic drive nor vagal withdrawal are likely causes of the tachycardia following PGI2 infusion.", 
    "3": "To characterize dopaminergic influences on pancreatic islet D cell function and its potential interaction with islet A and B cell function, the effect of dopamine (0.5-100 micro M) on immunoreactive somatostatin (IRS), insulin (IRI), and glucagon (IRG) release from rat islets incubated in vitro was studied. Dopamine significantly suppressed the release of IRS (P less than 0.001) and IRI (P less than 0.001) and augmented IRG release (P less than 0.001). Maximum suppression of IRS and IRI release was evident at 20 micro M dopamine with half-maximal suppression occurring at 0.5-1 micro M. Maximal stimulation of IRG release was observed at 100 micro M dopamine with a half-maximal response occurring at 5-10 micro M. Suppression of IRS secretion by dopamine (20 micro M) was completely reversed by the dopaminergic antagonists haloperidol (5 micro M) and pimozide (5 micro M) but was only partially reversed by the alpha adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (2 micro M), and was further suppressed by the beta adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (2 micro M). Suppression of IRI release by dopamine was completely reversed by propranolol, but was unaffected by haloperidol, pimozide, and phentolamine. There results indicate that dopamine directly affects pancreatic islet D cell function, and that islet B and D cells appear to be more sensitive to dopamine than are A cells. Dopamine suppresses IRS secretion predominantly through activation of dopaminergic receptors, whereas it suppresses IRI release through an alpha adrenergic mechanism and stimulates IRG release through a beta adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "4": "Glucoprivic stress induced by 2-DG (2-deoxy-D-glucose) is associated with increased oxygen consumption (thermogenesis) and sympathetic nervous system activity, as well as elevations of circulating levels of various hormones and metabolic substrates. To examine the role of beta-adrenergic stimulation in the thermogenic, hyperglycemic, and lipolytic responses to glucoprivation, we administered intravenous infusions of propranolol or normal saline (placebo) during 2-DG challenges in seven healthy males. 2-DG alone produced large increments in plasma catecholamine levels, hyperglycemia, a 3.5-fold increase in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels, a 15 beat/min increase in pulse rate, and hypothermia in spite of a 20% increase in oxygen consumption. When propranolol was given, 2-DG produced only a 50% increase in FFA levels, no change in oxygen consumption, and a 17 beat/min fall in pulse rate associated with a 25% increase in mean arterial blood pressure. Propranolol only slightly attenuated the hyperglycemia and hypothermia associated with 2-DG but potentiated the elevations of plasma epinephrine levels. It is concluded that 2-DG-induced thermogenesis and lipolysis are primarily dependent on beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "5": "Glucose production decreases markedly following acute reduction in insulin and glucagon secretion (induced by somatostatin). After about an hour, however, glucose production is restored nearly to basal rates. To study the mechanism by which this occurs, islet hormone deficiency was superimposed on beta-adrenergic blockade. It was found that the hypoglycemia that accompanies insulin and glucagon deficiency is an adequate stimulus for catecholamine secretion. During combined hormone deficiency and beta-blockade, glucose production fell and remained very low for 2-3 h. This resulted in a profound hypoglycemia (glucose less than 30 mg/dl). We conclude from these studies that restoration of glucose production during sustained insulin and glucagon deficiency is not attributable to a) onset of insulin deficiency because insulin is equally depressed in both experimental settings, b) glucose autoregulation even though adequate substrate is available, or c) an alpha-adrenergic mechanism because plasma catecholamines were very high and alpha-receptors were not blocked. Rather, the glucose counterregulation during insulin and glucagon deficiency must be heavily dependent on a beta-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "6": "In electrophysiologic studies we have previously shown that the calcium-channel blockers nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem have different actions on the atrioventricular node: nifedipine has no evident effect at a dose of 7.5 micrograms/kg of body weight intravenously, whereas verapamil (0.15 mg/kg) and diltiazem (0.25 mg/kg) both prolong the AH interval significantly and terminate or slow reciprocating atrioventricular tachycardia involving the atrioventricular node alone or in association with an accessory pathway. None of the calcium-channel blockers tested influenced intraventricular conduction, but all increased the sinus rate. Since these properties suggested that it would be safer to combine nifedipine, rather than verapamil and diltiazem, with beta-adrenergic blockers in the treatment of ischemic heart disease, we tested this combination for efficacy and safety. Our previous results have now been reviewed, and they show that according to both subjective and objective criteria, nifedipine adds benefits to the action of propranolol in the management of chronic stable angina pectoris. No adverse effects were seen in our series, and beneficial influences were noted in patients with elevation of blood pressure. Side effects reported by others and said to arise from the interaction between nifedipine and beta blockers are analyzed, and prudence is suggested before the combination, or indeed any negative inotropic agent, is given to patients with impaired left ventricular function. The previous reports cannot be taken to indicate that nifedipine has a greater tendency to produce adverse effects in this combination than does the beta-adrenergic blocker.", 
    "7": "Nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker, differs in structure and mode of action not only from the nitrates and beta blockers but also from the other well-known calcium-channel blockers. These differences have important implications for the treatment of angina pectoris. Our clinical experience over a period of 6 years with all types of angina patients--mostly those with chronic stable angina but also those with Prinzmetal's and unstable angina-corroborates the efficacy reports published in the world literature. Although the safety profile of nifedipine has been generally regarded as favorable, a few reports of clinically significant adverse effects in specific patient groups have appeared in the literature. In order to provide a more comprehensive assessment of safety, the records of over 3000 patients treated with nifedipine in open and controlled multiple-dose studies were tabulated and analyzed. Of special concern were patients with clinically significant adverse experiences, patients with a concomitant diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF), patients who were being treated concurrently with beta blockers, and patients who had been taking nifedipine for more than 6 months. Results of this analysis confirm that nifedipine can be safely administered to a broad spectrum of angina patients, including those with a concomitant diagnosis of CHF and those receiving concurrent therapy with beta-blocking agents.", 
    "8": "The calcium-channel blocker, nifedipine, was used as additional oral therapy to beta-adrenergic receptor blockade by the cardioselective agent, atenolol, in the therapy of 31 patients with hypertension. Initial studies were directed towards control of associated angina pectoris in 15 of the patients, but no effects were found on angina except in two patients. However, arterial blood pressure was consistently reduced in all patients. Further studies on 16 patients were therefore directed towards the use of nifedipine as an antihypertensive agent in addition to atenolol and a thiazide diuretic. Nifedipine (10 mg sublingually) acutely dropped blood pressure by about 30/20 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) within 20 minutes. Follow-up studies made after 4 to 8 weeks showed that the initial acute response to nifedipine predicted the long-term response to oral nifedipine, 10 mg twice daily. Of 31 hypertensive patients tested, only one failed to respond to nifedipine.", 
    "9": "The role of the renal beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptor subtypes in renin release was evaluated in anesthetized dogs. The renal baroreceptor and macula densa mechanisms of renin release were inhibited by pretreatment with indomethacin (8 mg/kg i.v.). Thus, the beta adrenergic mechanism of renin release was functionally isolated. Intrarenal infusion of isoproterenol at two infusion rates elicited local renal effects and systemic effects at the low and high infusion rates, respectively. Renin secretion was stimulated at both infusion rates. Isoproterenol elicited a significant renin release in the presence of beta-1 adrenoceptor blockade with atenolol and in the presence of selective beta-2 adrenoceptor blockade with IPS-339. In addition, intrarenal infusion of albuterol, a selective beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist, stimulated renin release in the absence and presence of atenolol. These results lead to the conclusion that beta adrenergically mediated release of renin in the dog is not confined to either the beta-1 or beta-2 adrenoceptor subtypes.", 
    "10": "In Finland's North Karelia region a community-based program for control of hypertension was administered for 5 years. Afterward, drug treatment and the impact of such treatment on control of blood pressure were studied in a cross-sectional survey. The study population (n = 10,199) consisted of a 6.6% random sample of people aged 30-64 years in North Karelia (program area) and Kuopio (reference area). Rate of participation was about 90%. The methods included questionnaire, personal interview, and clinical examination. In North Karelia, 24% of the men and 25% of the women were hypertensives (blood pressure greater than or equal to 175 mm Hg systolic and/or 100 mm Hg diastolic, or currently on antihypertensive drug therapy), compared with 33% of the men and 29% of the women in the reference area. In North Karelia, 48% of the male hypertensives and 67% of the female hypertensives were on drug therapy, compared with 32% and 54%, respectively, in the reference area. Of the total population in each area, 14% in North Karelia currently used drugs, compared with 13% in the reference area. Diuretics and beta-blockers were the drugs most commonly prescribed; men used beta-blockers more often than women did. In terms of quantity of medication, type of drugs, and compliance, the differences between the two areas were small. Control of blood pressure, however, was clearly better in North Karelia than in the reference area for hypertensives and drug users and for both men and women. Therefore, compared with the traditional system, organized hypertension care results in more successful treatment.", 
    "11": "Although all beta-blocking agents have similar pharmacologic effects, they have vastly different pharmacokinetic properties, which can influence the clinical usefulness of a given beta blocker in an individual patient. The efficacy of these drugs in a host of disorders-both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular-and their modes of action in these clinical contexts are examined and discussed.", 
    "12": "The effects of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol, and propranolol on the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide rebreathing have been determined in a double-blind randomized manner. Eight healthy, male, nonsmoking subjects received cumulative doses of each drug over a 10-hr period. The effects of each drug on heart rate and carbon dioxide sensitivity were determined at intervals of 2 hr and were related to plasma concentrations of each drug. Maximum reduction of exercise heart rate was achieved with all four beta blockers and plasma concentrations were in the usual therapeutic range for these drugs. There was considerable intersubject and within-subject variability in ventilatory responsiveness to inhaled carbon dioxide, but we were not able to discern any alteration in central sensitivity to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations.", 
    "13": "Beta adrenergic blocking drugs in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy provide symptomatic relief but their effect on long-term prognosis is uncertain. Thirty patients were studied non-invasively by simultaneous recordings of echocardiogram, apex-cardiogram, phonocardiogram, and electrocardiogram in order to assess diastolic abnormalities on and off oral beta adrenergic blocking drugs. While on treatment these patients had a mean dose of propranolol 200 mg/day. The treatment was stopped for one week and then non-invasive assessment was repeated. The following diastolic time intervals were studied: isovolumic relaxation period (A2-mitral valve opening); rapid relaxation period (A2-O point of the apexcardiogram), and the period from mitral valve opening to the O point of the apexcardiogram (Mo-O) when most of the filling of the left ventricle occurs. The prolongation of the rapid relaxation period reflects a reduced rate of fall of the left ventricular pressure when the pressure differential does not change between A2 and the O point of the apexcardiogram, and in this study this period was prolonged in 19, shortened in eight, and remained the same in three patients after beta blockade. The Mo-O point was prolonged in 22, shortened in seven, and was unchanged in one patient after beta adrenergic blocking drugs. All these results were independent of heart rate. In conclusion the response of diastolic time intervals to beta blocking drugs in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was variable but there was a significant number of patients in whom the time available for filling of the left ventricle was prolonged, suggesting better filling possibly because of improved distensibility of the left ventricle after beta adrenergic blocking drugs.", 
    "14": "The effects of i.v. nifedipine, 20 micrograms/kg, on left ventricular (LV) pressure, dP/dt, aortic pressure, heart rate, LV diameters, cardiac output, coronary blood flow and left circumflex coronary arterial diameter, and calculations of late diastolic coronary and total peripheral resistances and left circumflex coronary cross-sectional area were examined in 11 conscious dogs. In dogs with spontaneous rhythm, nifedipine induced an early, transient response characterized by hypotension and peak increases in coronary blood flow and decreases in total peripheral and late diastolic coronary vascular resistances. The peak effects on large coronary arteries were observed 2--5 minutes later, when mean arterial pressure was only 8.2 +/- 1.6 mm Hg below control and LV end-diastolic pressure and diameter were not significantly different from control. LV dP/dt was elevated by 7.1 +/- 1.1%, heart rate was elevated by 25 +/- 3.3 beats/min, and cardiac output remained elevated by 54 +/- 7.4%. At this time, coronary cross-sectional area was elevated by 26 +/- 3.0%, late diastolic coronary vascular resistance was reduced by 50 +/- 2.7%, and total peripheral resistance was 40 +/- 3.8% below control. The coronary sinus oxygen content was elevated by 3.4 +/- 0.8 vol% and the arteriovenous oxygen difference fell by 3.5 +/- 0.8 vol%. After beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol and with heart rate constant or varying, the increases in coronary cross-sectional area and decreases in late diastolic coronary vascular resistance induced by nifedipine were still observed, but were significantly smaller (p less than 0.01). Thus, nifedipine dilates both large coronary arteries and coronary resistance vessels, effects that could be attributed in part to beta-adrenergic mechanisms. Nifedipine also exerts potent effects on coronary and peripheral arterial vessels, but has little effect on preload.", 
    "15": "Beta-blockade is of proven value in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction but, unfortunately, may produce cardiac failure by removal of needed sympathetic support. The long duration of action of available blockers (hours) makes reversal of failure a complicated problem and precludes rapid modification of therapy to match changing autonomic conditions. To improve the safety and efficacy of beta-blockade in this setting we have developed the concept of ultra-short beta-blockade and have identified a novel beta-blocker (ASL-8052) which possesses a duration of action less than 15 minutes. This compound is cardioselective and possesses efficacy in an animal model of acute myocardial infarction. It, therefore, appears to be suitable for rapid attainment of controlled levels of beta-blockade via intravenous infusion and rapid recovery from beta-blockade if required by the clinical situation. The compound should, therefore, be useful for safe therapy in critically ill cardiac patients.", 
    "16": "This study was designed to examine the existence and possible mechanisms of segmental differences in sensitivity to adrenergic substances in the pulmonary vasculature of the guinea pig. The main pulmonary artery was found to be less sensitive to epinephrine, norepinephrine and phenylephrine than its left and right main branches. Because there were no differences in sensitivities between the left and right branches, most comparisons were made between the main and left branches. The difference in sensitivity was larger for adrenergic agonists which are known to be taken up by adrenergic neurons (epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine) than for an agonist which is not taken up by these neurons (methoxamine). The left artery from reserpine-treated animals was only slightly more sensitive (1.5-fold) to barium chloride than the main pulmonary artery. Cocaine potentiated to a greater extent in the main than in the left pulmonary artery the amines which are taken up by adrenergic neurons. The left arterial branch was less responsive to transmural electrical stimulation than the main artery in the absence and presence of cocaine. [3H]Norepinephrine uptake was larger in main arterial segments than in the branches and histochemical fluorescence studies demonstrated a greater degree of adrenergic innervation in the proximal segments. The results indicate that a major explanation for the differences in sensitivity between the vascular segments is a smaller degree of adrenergic neuronal uptake of agonist in the arterial branches.", 
    "17": "The treatment of congestive cardiomyopathy is dependent on clinical findings, reduced ejection fraction and presence of congestion. Diet, digitalis and vasodilator drugs: prazosin or dihydralazine are used in congestive cardiomyopathy class I or II (NYHA). In the presence of congestion diuretics are added, in chronic congestion of the lung nitrate. Congestive cardiomyopathy class III or IV (NYHA) is treated with diet, digitalis and the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. In the therapy of HOCM or HNCM the calcium antagonist verapamil is now widely used and seems to be replacing the beta-blocker treatment with propranolol. If treatment with beta-blocker and calcium antagonists in patients with HOCM class III or IV (NYHA) ist ineffective surgical therapy is necessary.", 
    "18": "Preincubation of turkey erythrocytes with isoproterenol results in an impaired ability of beta-adrenergic agonists to stimulate adenylate cyclase in membranes prepared from these cells. The biochemical basis for this agonist-induced desensitization was investigated using the new beta-adrenergic antagonist photoaffinity label [125I]p-azidobenzylcarazolol ([125I]PABC). Exposure of [125I]PABC-labeled turkey erythrocyte membranes to high intensity light leads to specific covalent incorporation of the labeled compound into two polypeptides, Mr approximately equal to 38,000 and 50,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Incorporation of [125I]PABC into these two polypeptides is completely blocked by a beta-adrenergic agonist and antagonist consistent with covalent labeling of the beta-adrenergic receptor. After desensitization of the turkey erythrocyte by preincubation with 10(-5) M isoproterenol, the beta-adrenergic receptor polypeptides specifically labeled by [125I]PABC in membranes prepared from desensitized erythrocytes were of larger apparent molecular weight (Mr approximately equal to 42,000 versus 38,000, and 53,000 versus 50,000) compared to controls. When included during the preincubation of the erythrocytes with isoproterenol, the antagonist propranolol (10(-5) M) inhibited both agonist-promoted desensitization of the adenylate cyclase and the altered mobility of the [125I]PABC-labeled receptor polypeptides. These data indicate that structural alterations in the beta-adrenergic receptor accompany the desensitization process in turkey erythrocytes.", 
    "19": "Forskolin at 10 muM caused a 100-fold increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP and a 6-fold increase in glycerol release in the human adipocyte. These responses are comparable to those prompted by 10 muM isoproterenol. The effects of forskolin on cyclic AMP and lipolysis were dose-dependent. Alpha-2 adrenergic activation, achieved with 10 muM epinephrine and 30 muM propranolol, significantly inhibited forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation and glycerol release, shifting the dose-response curves to the right. Forskolin at 10 muM caused a 4.5-fold increase in the adenylate cyclase activity of human adipocyte membranes. When either isoproterenol or epinephrine (0.1 mM) was combined with forskolin, the magnitude of response was substantially greater than the sum of responses achieved by each agent incubated alone.", 
    "20": "A rapid high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been elaborated for the separation and determination of small amounts of impurities in propranolol hydrochloride. The separation was achieved on a column of bare silica (Zorbax SIL) with methanol-water-0.2 M phosphate buffer pH 8.0 (70:25:5) containing 2.5 mM of cetyltrimethylammonium (CTMA) bromide as the eluent. The concentrations of methanol and CTMA as well as the pH of the phosphate buffer were found greatly to affect the separation. The selectivity of the system towards a mixture of propranolol and three possible impurities was investigated using different brands of silica. Only minor variations were found relative to those of a chromatographic system based on chemically bonded ODS silicas from the same sources. The method is also suitable for identification purposes, being able to separate most beta-blocking drugs of structures similar to that of propranolol.", 
    "21": "Chronotropic responses to sympathomimetic amines of isolated atrial preparations from toads (Bufo marinus) were mediated by beta-adrenoceptors since isoprenaline was more potent than adrenaline and noradrenaline, and propranolol was a potent antagonist (pA2, adrenaline as agonist = 9.33). The beta-adrenoceptors had some of the characteristics of mammalian beta 2-adrenoceptors in that (i) adrenaline was more potent than noradrenaline and (ii) the pA2 values of two selection beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, atenolol (pA2 = 5.84) and alpha-methylpropranolol (pA2 = 8.42), were close to the values reported on beta 2-adrenoceptors in mammalian tissues. However, the relative potencies of adrenaline, isoprenaline, noradrenaline, rimiterol, salbutamol and fenoterol (1 : 45.8 : 0.07 : 3.3 : 1.05 : 0.32) did not correspond to the relative potencies reported for these agonists on mammalian tissues which contain predominantly beta 2-adrenoceptors. Also the pA2 value for the beta 2-selective antagonist, ICI 118,551 (7.89, adrenaline as agonist) was lower than its reported pA2 on beta 2-adrenoceptors in mammalian tissues. There was no evidence that the response was mediated by both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors since Schild plots for ICI 118,551 using three agonists of differing selectivity (adrenaline, rimiterol and noradrenaline) were superimposed. It is concluded that, although toad atrial beta-adrenoceptors have several characteristics in common with beta 2-adrenoceptors in mammalian tissues, these amphibian beta-adrenoceptors are not identical with mammalian beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "22": "The effects of opiate receptor antagonism on the fetal cardiovascular response to hypoxemia were examined by means of the radionuclide-labeled microsphere technique. Heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output were measured during baseline periods, during hypoxemia, and before and after infusion of either naloxone (1 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of 0.0% saline solution. Seventeen fetal sheep were subjected to maternal hypoxemia by allowing the ewes to breathe 10% oxygen (3% carbon dioxide, 87% nitrogen). The fetuses responded with bradycardia (p less than 0.002 compared with control), increased blood pressure (p less than 0.002 compared with control), and no significant change in combined ventricular output or placental blood flow. After naloxone, the bradycardia increased by 10% (p less than 0.001), and both combined ventricular output and placental blood flow fell by 20% (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.01, respectively). The fetal bradycardic response to naloxone was reversible with atropine. In fetuses with normal oxygenation of the blood (normoxemic), naloxone had no significant effect on heart rate and blood pressure. These data indicate that endogenous opiates (e.g., endorphin and enkephalin) are important in regulating the fetal circulation during hypoxia, and that the effects of opiate receptor antagonism may be mediated through the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "23": "It is reported on a severe talinolol intoxication of a 19-year-old female patient who on suicidal purpose had taken 1.25-1.5 g talinolol (cordanum) (= 25-30 mg/kg body weight). Symptoms were non-measurable blood pressure and pulse, broadening of QRS with bradycardic disturbance of the rhythm in the ECG as well as severe abdominal pain, however, no bronchospasm. After unsuccessful application of orciprenalin and dopamin intracardiac transvenous electrostimulation with following improvement of the circulatory stimulation and the general condition. The highly frequent atrial stimulation performed before the discharge on the 6th day of the stay in hospital resulted in references to a disturbance of the sinu-auricular node automatism.", 
    "24": "The Authors have taken into account the most common effect of antiglaucomatous drugs on the depth of the anterior chamber. The modifications of the anterior chamber have been evaluated utilizing a Jaeger Pachymeter. The values were obtained before the drug instillation and an hour afterwards. The results are presented as the mean and standard deviation. Among the examined drugs, only miotics have brought about a notable decrease, whereas the others have shown no significant effects.", 
    "25": "The butyrophenone neuroleptic melperone has recently been shown to possess antiarrhythmic properties in man and animals. We studied the correlation between plasma concentration of melperone and the electrophysiological and blood pressure effects of the drug in 20 pentobarbital-anaesthetized dogs. Linear correlations were found between the log melperone plasma concentration and decreases in mean aortic blood pressure and heart rate, and increases in atrial and AV nodal refractoriness. The correlations were better after pretreatment with the beta 1-blocker atenolol. There was a linear correlation between log melperone plasma concentration and increases in ventricular refractoriness only after atenolol. No correlation was found between log melperone plasma concentration and decreases in AV nodal conduction time. Apart from the effect on AV nodal conduction time, the relationship between plasma concentration of melperone and the electrophysiological and blood pressure effects after beta 1-blockade fits well into an overall log concentration-effect relationship. The poorer correlation without beta 1-blockade was probably due to a combination of direct and indirect effects of the drug.", 
    "26": "The infusion of arachidonic acid through Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts in vitro for 15 min was associated with an increased PGI2 formation and release. This was a transient reaction, which showed a peak after 3-5 min and declined thereafter. Simultaneous infusion of washed human platelets (4 X 10(8)/min) stimulated the peak PGI2 formation (measured as immunoreactive 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha) but did not antagonize the inactivation of the PGI2-forming mechanism(s) in the vessel wall. The beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent mepindolol (0.3 and 3 microgram/ml) significantly enhanced the peak release of PGI2 at 3 microgram/ml (P less than 0.05). Its major effect, however, was to inhibit the decline in PGI2 release during arachidonic acid infusion. In this case the PGI2 release during arachidonic acid infusion (area under the curve) was doubled in the presence of mepindolol at both concentrations. It is concluded that protection of vascular PGI2 formation from inactivation might be an important mechanism for the maintenance of PGI2 release in response to continuous stimuli.", 
    "27": "Mesaconitine (MA) inhibited carrageenin-induced hind-paw edema in sham-operated mice as well as adrenalectomized mice. Hind-paw edema produced by subplantar injection of histamine, serotonin and prostaglandin E1 was suppressed by MA, indicating that it elicits the antiinflammatory activity at the early exudative stage of inflammations. However, MA did not affect the biosynthesis of the prostaglandins. Trazoline and propranolol had no effect on the inhibitory activity of MA on carrageenin-induced hind-paw edema. MA when administered i.c. at the doses where it shows marked analgesic activity produced dose-dependent antiinflammatory responses on paw edema produced by carrageenin and on vascular permeability accelerated by acetic acid and agar. The inhibitory activity of morphine on carrageenin-induced paw edema failed to be potentiated by the concurrent administration of MA, demonstrating that the mechanism of the antiinflammatory activity of MA involves the central nervous system.", 
    "28": "The present publication is a summary of a study concerning the direct myocardial effects of seven different beta-blockers which were quantified by means of the cat's heart-lung-preparation. Modifications in these effects induced by administration of fluothane, enflurane, dehydrobenzperidol and fentanyl are recorded. The findings are discussed and compared with those of other authors who have made similar studies in the intact animal, and in man. On the basis of this critical approach recommendations are made concerning the use of beta-blockers in the routine practice of clinical anaesthesia.", 
    "29": "The radioligand 3H-DHA was used to estimate the density and affinity of cardiac beta-receptors in rat strains selectively bred for differences in response to stress. Maudsley Reactive rats selected for heightened reactivity to stress had a greater density of beta-adrenergic binding in cardiac membranes than rats of two genetically distinct Maudsley Non-Reactive strains selected for decreased reactivity to stress, and compared with one of these Non-Reactive strains the MNR/Har, increased affinity for 3H-DHA. Together with previous findings the present results demonstrate a negative correlation between estimates of basal sympathetic activity on the on hand, and post-synaptic beta-receptors in heart on the other, that are consistent with the notion that these receptor alterations have occurred as a result of long-term differences in pre-synaptic release of transmitter. The Maudsley strains may, therefore, provide a useful model for the study of beta-adrenergic receptors as a physiological locus for regulation of end-target responsiveness to sympathetic stimulation.", 
    "30": "This study explores whether home BP self-determination can be used to assess the effect of treatment in patients with borderline hypertension. Sixteen untreated patients underwent a double-blind trial of propranolol hydrochloride (average dose, 105 mg), clonidine hydrochloride (0.24 mg), and placebo. Home BP readings decreased with both active compounds (-8/-5 with propranolol and -11/-7 with clonidine). During placebo, the readings increased to levels identical to untreated values. This study demonstrates that patients with borderline hypertension are consistently capable of detecting small average changes in home BP. It is also shown that sympatholytic monotherapy can be effectively used to lower the BP in such patients.", 
    "31": "Interruption of the ascending noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus in the rat forebrain with 6-hydroxydopamine produced a progressive accumulation, proximal to the lesion, of tritiated dihydroalprenolol binding activity over 2 days. This accumulation could be blocked by interrupting the neurons closer to their cell bodies. Competitive binding studies with the beta 2 agonist Zinterol suggested that the accumulated beta-receptors were primarily of the beta 1 subtype. These results suggest that, in the rat brain, some beta 1-adrenoreceptors are located in presynaptic, noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons and are transported in their axons.", 
    "32": "The stimulation of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation by the depolarizing agents K+, ouabain and veratridine, was studied in rat and guinea pig spinal cord tissue slices. Significantly increased accumulation of cyclic AMP was produced by each of the agents in a concentration-dependent manner. Veratridine and ouabain were equipotent (EC50 = 5 x 10(-5)M) and approximately 500 fold more potent than K+ (EC50 = 10(-2)M). Depolarizing agent-induced cyclic AMP accumulation in slices from guinea pig spinal cord was approximately double the response in rat spinal cord. Maximum stimulation occurred within 2.5 min of incubation with these agents and lasted for at least 30 min. Regional studies demonstrated that the maximal accumulation of cyclic AMP occurred to a greater degree in tissue slices from the dorsal section of spinal cord from both rat and guinea pig. Whereas the ouabain and veratridine stimulatory responses are completely dependent on extracellular Ca++, the K+ response is only partially dependent. Stimulation due to ouabain and veratridine is dependent, and K+ is independent, of release of neurohumoral substances such as norepinephrine or adenosine from spinal neurons. These experiments indicate the possible modulatory role of depolarization-linked events in regulating the spinal cord cyclic AMP system.", 
    "33": "Beta-adrenergic receptors were characterized by measuring the specific binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) on intact isolated rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC) and on perigranular membranes derived from purified RPMC granules. The specific binding of 3H-DHA reaches an equilibrium within 30 min at 5 degrees C and is linear with cell number. Scatchard analysis reveals two populations of binding sites on intact cells: with KD = 10.6 +/- 2.6 and 129 +/- 4.7 nM and Bmax of 186 +/- 38 and 1200 +/- 415 fmol/10(6) cells, respectively. Each cell contains 120 X 10(3) high-affinity binding sites and 720 X 10(3) low-affinity binding sites. There appears to be neither alpha-adrenergic nor muscarinic cholinergic receptors on the RPMC. Specific binding of 3H-DHA also occurred to isolated granules with perigranular membranes. The binding was saturable with a single population of binding sites with an affinity (KD) of 7.0 +/- 0.45 nM. Maximum binding (Bmax) was calculated at 56.6 +/- 1.9 fmol/10(9) granules. Subfractionation of granule components demonstrated that the specific binding sites appear to be localized exclusively on the perigranular membrane.", 
    "34": "Thirty caucasian male patients with stable angina were investigated in two groups of nine and one group of 12. Nine normal subjects were also studied. Patients in the first group (on no treatment) underwent symptom-limited exercise electrocardiography at 0800, 1200, and 1600 hours on the same day. Their heart rates and ST segment displacements at 1600 hours were significantly greater than at 0800 hours and the same phenomenon was seen in the second group who had been receiving propranolol 40 mg four times a day. A similar effect was noted for ST segment displacement but not for heart rate in the third group (on no treatment) tested at 0800 hours and 1600 hours on separate days, two to three weeks apart. Normal control subjects showed no diurnal variation in heart rate and their heart rate responses at 1600 hours were reduced by propranolol. The observations show a circadian variation in the ST segment response to exercise in patients with angina and a possible training effect on heart rate with multiple exercise testing on the same day. This variation is associated with a reduction in vagal parasympathetic tone to the heart and should be taken into account in the assessment of patients with angina and in particular when comparing responses to treatment.", 
    "35": "Combination therapy with timolol 0.25% eye drops and dipivalyl epinephrine (DPE) 0.1% eye drops twice daily is an acceptable form of medication for both chronic simple glaucoma and ocular hypertension. A group of eighteen patients using this combination therapy have been followed up for a period of two years with satisfactory control of intraocular pressure in the majority of cases. An additive effect in lowering intraocular pressure when the two drugs were used in combination was confirmed. Two patients developed a sensitivity reaction to DPE and were able to continue on timolol alone. There was a slight rise in the intraocular pressure between the sixth and ninth months of therapy, but following this the mean intraocular pressure was remarkably stable. Patient acceptance of this twice daily regime was excellent and compliance with the drug therapy was also good.", 
    "36": "Duodenal ulcer can be induced in rats by a single dose of cysteamine. The ulcer formation is accompanied by acid hypersecretion and elevated serum gastrin levels. This study was performed to elucidate the mechanisms of gastrin release after an ulcerogenic dose of cysteamine. Cysteamine induced a rise in serum gastrin from 29 +/- 5 pg/ml to a maximum of 203 +/- 62 pg/ml after 3 h in unoperated rats, whereas no rise was seen in vagotomized or antrectomized rats. The beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol strongly inhibited cysteamine-induced gastrin release, whereas atropine dependent on an intact vagus and may be mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "37": "Effects of trimebutine maleate (TM-906) on the spontaneous contraction were investigated in the isolated circular smooth muscle of the antrum region of the guinea pig stomach. TM-906 dose-dependently reduced the amplitude of the regular spontaneous contraction without any marked change in its frequency and basal tension. This effect of TM-906 was also observed in the presence of phentolamine, propranolol, atropine, and tetrodotoxin. However, the inhibitory effect of TM-906 was overcome by increasing the extracellular concentration of CaCl2. On the other hand, in preparations which exhibited irregular spontaneous contraction, TM-906 regularized it, and spontaneous contraction with regular frequency and amplitude was elicited. In addition, this regularizing effect of TM-906 was also observed in the presence of atropine and tetrodotoxin. It was concluded that TM-906 has dual effects on the spontaneous contraction, reducing the amplitude of regular contraction and regularizing the irregular contraction. These effects of TM-906 may be attributed to the direct action on the smooth muscle.", 
    "38": "The effect of the two C-17 isomers of estradiol on the shape of the action potential of rat atrial tissue was studied by means of classical glass electrodes for different concentrations of estradiol. Resting potential and upstroke were not affected by estradiol, but the duration of the action potential was reduced. Only estradiol-17 beta exhibits an effect in a concentration dependent way, while estradiol-17 alpha has no effect at all. The ionic mechanism was studied by adding specific ionic blockers to the perfusate. Since the effect was much less pronounced when a slow inward current blocker was added, it was concluded that estradiol-17 beta acts mainly via the slow inward current channel. Only a small part of the interaction takes place via the potassium outward channel.", 
    "39": "In vitro experiments, using dopamine-induced relaxations of several pre-contracted rabbit blood vessels, confirmed the presence of renal dopamine receptors and suggested the existence of similar receptors in the portal vein and aorta. With jejunal muscle, however, dopamine's (spontaneous) relaxant effect was mediated by beta-adrenoceptors. The relaxant responses in the blood vessels were small, and quantitative information proved difficult to obtain. Therefore, a method of measuring alpha-adrenoceptor mediated contractile responses to dopamine was developed. Comparison of the respective antagonism of these responses produced by an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine, and a dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol, showed differences between vascular and intestinal smooth muscle. The results suggest that this method is able to detect the presence of dopamine receptors in isolated tissues.", 
    "40": "The pharmacokinetics of acebutolol and its major N-acetyl metabolite diacetolol were determined following acute intravenous and chronic oral administration to 22 subjects with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 3 and 127 ml/min. Following chronic oral administration the mean terminal elimination half-life of unchanged acebutolol was about 10 hours independent of renal function, whereas the hall-life of the N-acetyl metabolite increased from 12.8 hr in subjects with normal renal function (GFR greater than 90 ml/min) to 24.0 hr in preuremic patients (GFR less than 10 ml/min). The mean area of the plasma level-time curve (AUC) of the metabolite was 14.2 mg 1-1 hr in patients with normal renal function and rose to a value of 81.4 mg 1-1 hr in preuremic patients. The mean AUC of the parent drug was not influenced by changes in renal function. The considerable accumulation of the acetyl metabolite, which has about the same beta blocking activity as the unchanged drug, necessitates dose reduction of acebutolol in the presence of different degrees of renal impairment (reduction by half of the normal daily dose in patients with GFR between 30 and 10 ml/min and by three quarters when GFR less than 10 ml/min). In subjects with normal renal function, the ratio between the AUC of the parent drug and that of its major N-acetyl metabolite was 3:1 after intravenous injection of the drug, while it was 1:2.5 following chronic oral administration, indicating a marked first pass metabolism of acebutolol.", 
    "41": "Clonidine and propranolol reverse arterial smooth muscle hypertrophy in hypertensive animals. It is uncertain whether this is mediated by a reduction in pressure or withdrawal of sympathetic nerve activity to the vasculature. Veins obtained from spontaneously hypertensive rats undergo hypertrophy and thereby provide a model for the separation of pressure-dependent and independent effects of antihypertensive drugs. Clonidine (0.075 and 0.3 mg/kg/day) or propranolol (0.75 and 3.0 mg/kg/day), administered by Alzet minipump for three consecutive weeks to SHR and age and sex matched Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats (WKY), produced dose-related reductions in systolic arterial pressure, without affecting central or portal venous or right ventricular pressure. Clonidine reversed the decreased extensibility and the biochemical correlates of hypertrophy which characterized the portal (PV) and vena caval veins (IVC) and pulmonary arteries (PA) obtained from SHR. Moreover, clonidine decreased the uptake of PAS-Schiff stain for neutral and acidic glycosaminoglycans (GAG's) and decreased the medial wall thickness of the PV, IVC and PA obtained from SHR. Clonidine did not affect these parameters in blood vessels obtained from WKY. Propranolol exerted actions similar to clonidine, but its effects were more variable and less effective than clonidine, despite equivalent reductions in arterial pressure. The data support the conclusion that clonidine can reverse the functional morphological derangements of venous and PA dysfunction in SHR. The effects appear to be independent of both a reduction in pressure and withdrawal of sympathetic tone to the blood vessels. The data suggest that clonidine, and to a lesser extent propranolol, may act directly on the veins, or indirectly by inhibiting the release or synthesis of a trophic nonadrenergic factor, to reverse the functional and structural changes in the veins.", 
    "42": "The relationship between R-wave amplitude and left ventricular volume was studied in four tests, each including six normal adults. The means of 10 heart cycles of the R-wave amplitude in surface ECG lead V5 (RV5) and the echocardiographically determined left ventricular enddiastolic dimension (LVEDD) were compared before and during different interventions. After inhalation of 0.3 ml isoamylnitrit, LVEDD was reduced to 7.7%, RV5 to 15.0% below control. During a maneuver of Valsalva, LVEDD decreased to 8.6%, RV5 to 12.9% below control. In both tests heart rates increased markedly. After oral application of propranolol (0.7 to 1.0 mg/kg) LVEDD did not change, whereas RV5 decreased to 8.2% below control. During rapid intravenous infusion of 1 l NaCl 0.9% in 10 to 15 minutes, LVEDD increased to 15.7% above control. R-wave amplitude remained constant. Thus the results of these last two tests let us doubt whether the Brody-effect can be translated without limitation on the in-vivo situation in man.", 
    "43": "Twenty persons with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) were followed for an average of one year in a prospective study after argon laser trabeculoplasty was performed in one eye. By one month the mean intraocular pressure (IOP) had fallen 39% and was associated with an 80% increase in mean facility of aqueous outflow. Eighteen persons with POAG were evaluated for the possibility of maintaining an IOP of less than 22 mm Hg with less medication than was required prior to laser treatment. One third of these patients required no medication after treatment, and 39% required less; however, 28% of persons who were poorly controlled before treatment required the same regimen to maintain control after laser trabeculoplasty. Six out of nine persons no longer required a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor while six out of eight persons no longer required a miotic. Laser trabeculoplasty failed to produce a sufficiently large fall in IOP in most persons on maximal medication to permit discontinuation of all medication; but it produced its most satisfying response in persons whose glaucoma was less difficult to control.", 
    "44": "Stimulation of emotiogenic zones of the dog hypothalamus in acute and chronic experiments evoked the same responses in the heart and coronary vessels: an increase of the coronary vessels resistance occurred within first 5 sec of the stimulation. Acceleration of cardiac activity involved coronary vessels dilatation. Hypothalamic stimulation against the background of adrenergic betareceptor block caused an increase of coronary vessels resistance alone. Changes of arterial pressure were the same as before the block, and the change of the heart rate was less obvious. The neurogenic vasoconstriction of coronary vessels and their metabolic vasodilatation are interrelated in a complicated way: adrenergic influences activating smooth muscles of coronary vessels maintain their extravascular effects during vasodilatation of metabolic nature.", 
    "45": "The ability to preserve myocardial structural and functional integrity during extended periods of total ischaemia has practical clinical significance. The role of endogenous catecholamines in the onset of irreversible damage in global ischaemia of the isolated rat heart was assessed by beta-blockade or catecholamine depletion. The effects of propranolol and reserpine pretreatment on myocardial ultrastructure, function and metabolism were studied during normothermic ischaemic arrest (NICA) and reperfusion of the isolated working rat heart. beta-Blockade as well as catecholamine depletion resulted in an increase in the percentage of totally ischaemic hearts which recovered mechanically upon reperfusion. In these studies mechanical recovery during reperfusion was associated with reversal of ultrastructural ischaemic alterations, but without an improvement in mitochondrial function. These findings support the concept that failure of mitochondria to recover functionally upon reperfusion is not the cause of either irreversible mechanical failure or ultrastructural damage of the ischaemic myocardium.", 
    "46": "The influence of timolol upon cerebrospinal fluid formation rate has been examined in rats by the measurement of 22Na+ entry into this fluid after 10, 100, or 1000 micrograms x kg-1 i.v. and in cats by the dye-dilution measurement of new fluid formation after 30, or 3000 microgram x kg-1 i.v., or 250 micrograms x mL-1 in ventricular perfusate. In rats no change from control rates occurred. In the cats there appeared to be no effect of intraventricular timolol; however, a significant decrease of approximately 25% in the mean flow rate was seen after 40 min when drug was given i.v. at either dose level. A time study showed that no further decrease occurred within 5 h and that the observed decrease continued for at least 3 h. These findings are of interest in view of the ability of topical, intraocular, and i.v. timolol to reduce aqueous humor formation rate.", 
    "47": "The effect of a new antihypertensive drug, labetalol, on uteroplacental blood flow was determined in eight pre-eclamptic women. After injection of 0.5 mCi of 113mIn the radioactivity in the placenta was recorded by a gamma camera linked to a computer and the placental blood-flow index was calculated from the ratio between the maximum radioactivity of the isotope-accumulation curve and the rise time of the curve. Labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist was given intravenously and after 30 min a second uteroplacental blood-flow index was calculated. There was a significant mean decrease of blood pressure from 147/98 to 128/83 mmHg, but no change in uteroplacental blood-flow index, so that uteroplacental vascular resistance tended to decrease.", 
    "48": "The antihypertensive drug labetalol was administered orally and intravenously to ten hypertensive patients aged between 28 and 75 years. There was a significant increase with age in both bioavailability and half-life of labetalol. Clearance tended to be lower in the elderly subjects. First pass metabolism results in variable oral bioavailability of labetalol which is greater in the elderly and this should be borne in mind when using the drug in this age group.", 
    "49": "Atenolol has been studied prospectively in the management of ten patients with essential hypertension during pregnancy. Median supine BP fell significantly from 156/98 mmHg before treatment to 128/82 mmHg at term. Atenolol did not suppress cardiotocographic signs of foetal distress. Although there was one intrauterine death, the remaining nine babies had a median Apgar score at birth of 9 and a median weight which was 82% of the gestational mean. There were no cases of neonatal bradycardia or respiratory depression and the only case of hypoglycaemia was in a dysmature baby. These findings justify a formal study of beta-adrenoceptor blocker therapy in hypertensive diseases of pregnancy.", 
    "50": "In 22 patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia incorporating a retrogradely conducting accessory pathway, electrophysiologic studies were done before and after oral digoxin, 1.25 mg, and propranolol, 160 to 240 mg, each given in 4 divided doses at 6-hour intervals. Before digoxin and propranolol, all 22 patients had induction of sustained tachycardia. After the medication six patients lost the ability to induce atrial echo and one lost the ability to sustain tachycardia due to an increased retrograde accessory pathway or atrial refractoriness or both. Six patients lost the ability to induce or sustain tachycardia due to increased atrioventricular nodal refractoriness. In the remaining nine patients with inducible sustained tachycardia, cycle lengths of tachycardia were prolonged. These findings suggest that combined use of oral digoxin and propranolol is useful in selected patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia.", 
    "51": "The effects of sulfinpyrazone were studied in 33 chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Ventricular fibrillation thresholds, mid diastolic thresholds and duration of the effective refractory period were determined in the normal heart after intravenous administration of sulfinpyrazone, 30 mg/kg body weight. The drug significantly raised the ventricular fibrillation threshold by 24 percent and the mid diastolic threshold by 36 percent and prolonged the effective refractory period by seven percent. The influence of sulfinpyrazone during acute myocardial ischemia was evaluated before and during a 10 minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and after abrupt release of the occlusion. Although the drug afforded significant protection during coronary occlusion, it had no effect on the ventricular fibrillation threshold after reperfusion. Because potent cardiocardiac reflexes are elicited during ischemia, the influence of sulfinpyrazone on the ventricular fibrillation threshold was studied during norepinephrine infusion. Sulfinpyrazone attenuated the reduction of the ventricular fibrillation threshold during sympathetic humoral stimulation. Its effect was additive to beta adrenergic blockade with practolol and membrane stabilization with lidocaine. This investigation suggests that sulfinpyrazone exerts significant effects on ventricular vulnerability of both the normal and the ischemic myocardium. Further studies are needed to elucidate its precise mechanism of action.", 
    "52": "The study was designed to assess the antiarrhythmic and antianginal properties of pindolol as well as the tolerance to the drug by patients who had experienced a myocardial infarction 5 to 6 months previously. Exercise tests were performed in 521 postinfarct patients before and after a single oral 5 mg dose of pindolol. Depending on the physical condition of the patient, the initial work load was 25 or 50 watts, which was increased by 25 watts every 5 minutes. In patients with an initial heart rate (HR) of more than 68 bpm on the average, HR at rest was reduced with pindolol. This reduction was more pronounced the higher the initial HR. If the initial HR was below 68 bpm, HR increased slightly with pindolol, reflecting the drug's intrinsic activity. The frequency-regulating effect of pindolol dependent on the level of exercise that produced the tachycardia: tachycardia at rest responded more markedly to pindolol than exercise-induced tachycardia; tachycardia due to low-level exercise responded better than that due to higher level exercise. Of the 88 patients who developed typical effort angina and/or ischemic ST-segment depression, 62 became symptom free during exercise when taking pindolol. The patient sample included 66 patients with effort-related premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), 44 of whom responded well to pindolol. Of the 453 patients with a stable HR, 15 exhibited PVCs during exercise for the first time while receiving pindolol. Overall, pindolol exerted a statistically highly significant antiarrhythmic effect. Tolerance to pindolol was good; no side effects were observed.", 
    "53": "Twelve patients with documented coronary arteriosclerosis and severe stable angina pectoris were treated with the beta blocker pindolol, 5 mg four times a day, utilizing a double-blind crossover protocol. Following 4 weeks of baseline observation with no active treatment, pindolol and placebo were given for 4 weeks each. End points evaluated were episodes of angina pectoris/week, number of nitroglycerin tablets used per week, time on treadmill test until onset of angina pectoris, double product of heart rate and blood pressure at onset of angina pectoris, and amount of ST depression during the treadmill exercise test. Episodes of angina pectoris and nitroglycerin consumption were reduced by 18% on placebo and 32% on pindolol (not significant). All of the improvement occurred in the third and fourth weeks of pindolol treatment. Less difference between pindolol and placebo was noted when the placebo period came after the pindolol period, suggesting a carry-over effect of pindolol. With pindolol, treatment exercise tolerance was increased 13% (33 seconds) over baseline levels but only 2% over the levels achieved with placebo treatment (not significant). ST depression with exercise was 6% less when patients were on pindolol than when they were on placebo (not significant). There was a marked decrease in myocardial oxygen demand as measured by the double product of blood pressure and pulse during exercise (23% reduction when on pindolol and no change when on placebo, p less than 0.01). This study shows that there was an important placebo effect when treatment of angina pectoris was evaluated and that pindolol significantly reduced myocardial oxygen demand but evidence of ischemia was not significantly reduced. Possible mechanisms to explain the disparity between reduction in estimated myocardial oxygen demand (double product) and objective improvement in ischemia include coronary spasm and altered regional flow resulting from beta blockade. Alternative explanations may be the relatively small fixed dose of pindolol and the small number of patients studied.", 
    "54": "Although all beta blockers have been found to be effective in the symptomatic relief of angina pectoris, the importance of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) has not been studied extensively. In a randomized, double-blind study, we administered equipotent doses of propranolol (10, 20, and 40 mg four times a day) and pindolol (2.5, 5, and 10 mg four times a day), a beta blocker with significant ISA, to 52 patients with angina. Both agents were found to be effective in the treatment of angina. At peak dose, propranolol reduced the number of angina attacks per 2 weeks from 29.29 +/- 4.79 to 18.0 +/- 4.4 (p = 0.021) (a 39% reduction) and increased the exercise tolerance on the treadmill from 7.55 +/- 0.67 METS to 9.36 +/- 0.58 (p = 0.002). Pindolol decreased the number of anginal attacks per 2 weeks from 16.48 +/- 2.63 to 8.65 +/- 2.46 (p = 0.0027) (a 48% reduction) and increased exercise tolerance from 7.95 +/- 0.56 METS to 9.40 +/- 0.57 (p = 0.0245). At the end of the maximum tolerated exercise, propranolol decreased the heart rate from 110.00 +/- 3.41 to 99.71 +/- 3.74 (p = 0.0015). Pindolol also decreased the heart rate at the maximum tolerated exercise from 113.59 +/- 3.24 to 108.12 +/- 3.16 (p = 0.0102). At rest, however, propranolol induced a more pronounced (p = 0.0066) decrease in heart rate (from 69.00 +/- 1.85 to 61.50 +/- 1.99; p = 0.0018), whereas pindolol did not significantly affect the resting heart rate (65.37 +/- 1.47 to 65.5 +/- 1.44; p = 0.9392). In addition propranolol decreased echocardiographically determined ejection fraction from 0.57 +/- 0.02 to 0.15 +/- 0.01 (p = 0.04) and increased the left ventricular end-diastolic volume from 71.8 +/- 3.2 to 92.2 +/- 1.9 ml (p = 0.003), whereas pindolol did not affect the ejection fraction and caused a less pronounced (p = 0.03) increase in end-diastolic volume (from 70.8 +/- 1.8 to 80.2 +/- 2.8; p = 0.02). The data indicate that both propranolol and pindolol are effective in the treatment of angina pectoris and that pindolol decreases the resting heart rate and ejection fraction and increases the left ventricular end-diastolic volume to a lesser extent than propranolol.", 
    "55": "The role of pindolol in treating ventricular arrhythmia was studied in 43 patients with this disorder. Of these patients, 23 had coronary heart disease, 5 had valvular disease, and 15 had no demonstrable heart disease. patients underwent acute drug testing with 20 mg pindolol (phase 1) followed by maintenance therapy (phase 2) for 3 days (20 to 80 mg daily). Efficacy during both phases was evaluated by ambulatory monitoring and treadmill exercise testing. During acute drug testing, 50% of te patients responded. A concordant response between acute drug testing and phase 2 monitoring was seen in 81% (p less than 0.005) of patients and between acute drug testing and phase 2 exercise testing in 88% (p less than 0.005). Arrhythmia was suppressed during the phase 2 exercise test in 53% of patients; these included 80% of the patients without heart disease and 50% of those with coronary heart disease (not significant). During phase 2 monitoring, 60% of patients without heart disease responded vs. 25% with coronary heart disease (not significant). Side effects occurred in 12 patients (28%). These included congestive heart failure (3 patients); fatigue, lightheadedness, and insomnia (2 patients each); nausea, tremor, urinary retention, and bronchospasm (1 patient each); and aggravation of arrhythmia (7 patients). It is concluded that although pindolol alone is marginally effective for treating ventricular arrhythmia in patients with coronary heart disease, it appears to be more valuable in those without heart disease, especially when arrhythmia is provided by exercise. Acute drug testing proved highly predictive of the results with maintenance therapy and is a valuable rapid-screening procedure for identifying potential responders to pindolol.", 
    "56": "Three groups of hypertensive patients were studied after they had received one of the three pharmacologically different beta blockers for at least 1 month: pindolol, 10 mg twice a day (n = 7), propranolol median dose, 80 mg three times a day (n = 9), or metoprolol, 150 mg (twice a day (n = 8). After abrupt withdrawal of drug and replacement with placebo, we measured the following on day 0 and approximately every 2 days up to 3 weeks; beta-adrenergic sensitivity (BAS) by the chronotropic dose of isoproterenol to increase heart rate by 25 bpm (CD25), resting heart rate and blood pressure, and symptoms. All values are medians. On day 0, beta blockade was evident by increased CD25 values of 618 micrograms for pindolol, 57 micrograms for propranolol, and 10 micrograms for metoprolol as compared to 2.8, 2.4, and 3.0 microgram, respectively, at days 14 to 21, which were considered the ultimate baseline. After pindolol on day 0, the CD25 slowly decreased to, but never below, baseline by days 8 to 21. In contrast, after propranolol on day 0, the CD25 decreased significantly two- to fivefold below baseline from days 4 to 14 (BAS) and after metoprolol two- to threefold below baseline from days 2 to 8. After pindolol, heart rate and blood pressure gradually returned to, but not above, ultimate baseline. In contrast, during the period of BAS there was a significant overshoot of heart rate in eight patients after metoprolol (day 0 = 61, peak = 88, baseline = 74) but not after propranolol, while a significant overshoot of blood pressure occurred in six of nine patients after propranolol (day 0 = 140/87, peak = 157/95, baseline = 140/89) but not after metoprolol. Withdrawal symptoms of headache, palpitations, and tremor occurred in one of seven patients after pindolol, six of nine after propranolol, and three of eight after metoprolol. The degree and duration of beta blockade appeared related to drug potency. Withdrawal phenomena occurred after propranolol and metoprolol but not after pindolol.", 
    "57": "Regional myocardial function was assessed by multidirectional echocardiography from eight standardized segments around the left ventricle. Thirty-six subjects (healthy, severe angina pectoris, or acute myocardial infarction) were studied 15 minutes either after the beta 1-selective beta-blocking drug metoprolol had been administered in total doses of 2 and 10 mg intravenously or after pindolol, a beta blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), in total doses of 0.2 and 1.0 mg intravenously had been given. Metoprolol and pindolol reduced rate-pressure product (p less than 0.001 each), heart rate (p less than 0.001), and systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05 to 0.001) in almost the same way. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, 0.2 mg pindolol improved ST segments by 33% and 2 mg metoprolol by 18%. Left ventricular diameter increased (p less than 0.001) and ejection fraction decreased (p less than 0.05) after metoprolol but not after pindolol. Pindolol did not reduce wall motion amplitudes of healthy myocardial segments, while metoprolol did ( p less than 0.01). The overall contractile function of the left ventricle is characterized by composite segmental amplitudes from both ischemic and healthy ventricular regions. In ischemic hearts this function remained unchanged after metoprolol but improved markedly after pindolol (p less than 0.005). Thus, while intravenous pindolol and metoprolol produced equal reductions in rate-pressure product, pindolol, a beta-adrenergic-blocking drug with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, evoked less cardiac depression and thus provided a cardiac safety factor not afforded by the beta- 1-selective metoprolol.", 
    "58": "Two studies of systolic time intervals (STIs) in patients with mild to moderate hypertension (HBP) revealed that no mean change in systolic intervals occurred with pindolol therapy, although some patients had significant alterations in their STIs. Pindolol responders with normal pretreatment preejection period to left ventricular ejection time (PEP/LVET) ratios had a significant increase in this ratio following pindolol therapy, whereas those with abnormal pretreatment PEP/LVET ratios had improvement in this ratio on administration of the drug. Patients on propranolol showed no change in PEP/LVET ratio. Propranolol administration slowed heart rate and lengthened Q-S2, S1-S2, and LVET, however, without altering the Q-S2 and LVET index, indicating that the changes were caused by the effect of propranolol on the heart rate alone. Chlorthalidone in high doses significantly reduced the Q-S2 index and the S1-S2 index, indicating that these changes were not caused by alteration of the heart rate. The second study suggests that STIs may provide a predictive clue for clinical response to pindolol. Patients with normal cardiac function (group I) are more likely to respond to pindolol than are those with abnormal cardiac function (group II). Directionally opposite changes in STIs in the two subgroups suggest different mechanisms for changing cardiac function. Pindolol's dual role as a beta-blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity is proposed as a possible explanation, beta-blocking effects predominating in group I and sympathomimetic activity balancing the beta effect in group II.", 
    "59": "In a double-blind, randomized crossover study of 12 patients suffering from chronic bronchitis, the comparative influence of equipotent doses of pindolol (5 mg) and metoprolol (100 mg) on the bronchodilatory potential of inhaled fenoterol (0.4 mg), a beta 2-agonist, was investigated by means of body plethysmography. Neither beta-blocker caused bronchospasm or attenuated the bronchodilation due to fenoterol. The results are not pertinent to the potential risk of bronchospastic complications induced by beta 1-selective or nonselective drugs, but they rule out a therapy-oriented differentiation between pindolol and cardioselective agents as far as the potential response to the bronchodilating activity of inhaled sympathomimetics is concerned.", 
    "60": "On separate days, in double-blind fashion, 23 subjects with mild or moderate asthma were injected intravenously with a placebo or 0.4 mg pindolol. Plethysmographic and spirometric measurements were performed before and after injection and repeatedly after exhausting incremental bicycle ergometer exercise. The mean reduction in maximal exercise heart rate of 26 bpm after pindolol compared to placebo confirmed significant cardiovascular beta blockade. Baseline 1-second vital capacity (FEV1) values and other flow rates were similar in both trials. There were similar reductions in FEV1 (median of 1% to 2% and mean of 3% to 5%) and other flow rates immediately after injection of placebo or pindolol. Exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) occurred in 34 of 46 trials and tended to be more severe in subjects with more baseline airway obstruction. Minimal EIB (FEV1 to 80% to 90% of baseline values) developed in eight after taking placebo and in seven after taking pindolol; mild EIB (FEV1 to 60% to 79% of baseline) developed in the five after placebo and six after pindolol and moderate EIB (FEV1 to 40% to 59% of baseline) developed in three after placebo and five after pindolol. In five subjects, FEV1 was reduced to a greater extent after placebo than after pindolol (median of 6%), whereas in 13 subjects, FEV1 was reduced to a greater extent after pindolol than after placebo (median of 10%). These small differences in FEV1 between placebo and pindolol were significant by the t test after exercise but not before exercise. Thus, exercise appears to increase the sensitivity in evaluating airway reactivity in asthmatic patients and also tests the effectiveness of cardiovascular beta blockade.", 
    "61": "Ambulatory monitoring of intra-arterial blood pressure was used to assess patterns of circadian blood pressure in 12 hypertensive patients who were treated with pindolol in either a once- or twice-daily dosage regimen. Neither once-daily nor twice-daily pindolol had much effect during the latter part of the night and early morning. In the six patients who agreed to further crossover studies, the hypotensive effects of once-daily therapy were not significantly different from those produced by a twice-daily regimen. While confirming the effectiveness of once-daily beta blockade in hypertension, we deduce that failure to affect nighttime blood pressure substantially is a feature independent of the dosage regimen and also, probably, of the individual beta blocker used."
