Within the first week catabolism of phospholipids predominated, maximal rate of which was detected at the end of the first day. Within the subsequent three days phospholipid composition of cardiomyocyte membranes was gradually normalized. Qualitative and quantitative alterations in the membranes phospholipid composition with frequency of heart rhythm impairments, with increased consumption of glucose by functioning heart as well as with amount of enzymes, liberated from isolated isometrically contracting heart into coronary circulation. Preadministration of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, guthimine, inderal, ionol and isophthine enabled to decrease or even to normalize the cardiomyocyte membranes phospholipid composition.", 
    "1": "Neurohypophysial astrocytes, the pituicytes, are known to undergo morphological changes in vivo in response to stimuli that increase the demand for hormone secretion. Similar changes have been induced by beta-adrenergic stimulation both in the isolated, but otherwise intact, neural lobe and in pituicytes cultured from adult rats. Since the predominant beta-receptor subtype in the neural lobe is beta 2, we investigated the possibility that beta 2-receptor activation is mainly responsible for the observed pituicyte responses. In one experiment, cultured pituicytes were induced by noradrenalin to change from flattened amorphous to stellate morphology. Addition of the beta 2-antagonist IPS 339, but not the beta 1-antagonist practolol, significantly reduced (by 30-60%) the number of cells transformed by noradrenalin. In a second experiment, adrenalin, by definition a more potent beta 2-agonist, transformed significantly more pituicytes into stellate shapes than did noradrenalin at the same concentrations (100% vs. 60% increase, respectively). These results support the idea that beta 2-adrenergic receptors are involved in neurohypophysial plasticity. Also, since the neural lobe is outside of the bloodbrain barrier, these findings suggest that adrenal catecholamines participate in altering pituicyte morphology.", 
    "2": "The effects of two cardioselective beta-blockers metoprolol and atenolol (2 mg/kg, intravenously) on the activity of the sympathetic renal nerve as well as the sensitivity of the chronotropic and sympathetic components of the baroreceptor reflex tested by using phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside. In the experiments on conscious Wistar rats only the more lipophilic agent metoprolol significantly decreased the baseline level of the activity of the sympathetic nerve by 15%. The sensitivity of the chronotropic baroreceptor reflex elicited by a decrease of arterial blood pressure with sodium nitroprusside was reduced significantly both by metoprolol and atenolol. The tendency towards a decrease of the sensitivity of the chronotropic reflex elicited by phenylephrine-induced elevation of blood pressure was noted. The baroreflectory modification of the sympathetic activity did not change significantly under the influence of metoprolol and atenolol. The presence of the central component of action (of metoprolol) and the peripheral component (of the studied beta-blockers) is concluded.", 
    "3": "The new antiallergic drug azelastine (E-0659, Azeptin; CAS 58581-89-8) is used in the treatment of rhinitis and bronchial asthma. In the present study, the effect of azelastine on the regulation of the beta-adrenoceptors and the down regulation of beta-adrenoceptors by terbutaline, a beta-agonist, was investigated using guinea pig lungs. Guinea pigs were divided into four groups; (1) the control (saline-treated) group, (2) the terbutaline-treated group, (3) the azelastine-treated group, (4) terbutaline plus azelastine-treated group. Guinea pigs intramuscularly injected with each agent three times a day for successive 7 days. In the terbutaline-treated group, a 26% reduction in the number of beta-adrenoceptors compared with those of the control group was observed. In the azelastine-treated group, the number of beta-adrenoceptors increased by 24% compared with those of the control group. The number of the beta-adrenoceptors in the terbutaline plus azelastine-treated group was significantly increased compared with that of the terbutaline-treated group. These results suggest that azelastine may prevent the down regulation observed during beta-agonist administration by increasing the number of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "4": "Duration of Action of Betaadrenergic Blockers Determined with Holter-ECG in Healthy Volunteers In phase I, the duration of action of betaadrenergic blockers is usually determined from the reduction of exercise induced tachycardia. In this randomized placebocontrolled doubleblind trial, however, ambulatory 24-h heart rate monitoring was used in 12 healthy volunteers to evaluate the duration of action of the new cardioselective and vasodilating betaadrenergic blocker ridazolol (CAS413). After the control periods as well as after prospectively defined hours the following mean values of heart rate were obtained: Ridazolol: Control 65.2, 12 h 69.6, 16 h 64.9, 24 h 74.0 beasts/min, placebo: Control 64.8, 12 h 78.5, 16 h 69.7, 24 h 73.5 beats/min. Differences after 12 h were statistically significant and would have been significant after 16 h with more volunteers. Additional explorative analysis with adjustment of significance levels for multiple analysis resulted in significant effects from 2 to 14 h. It was not useful, however, to calculate the time of maximal and half-maximal effects because of the large individual variation. Holter-monitoring of spontaneous heart rate in volunteers provides a rapid orientation on the duration of action of betaadrenergic blockers. The method allows to fix prospectively reasonable times of evaluation in efficacy trials in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "5": "Twenty-five cases of the congenital, idiopathic long QT syndrome, occasionally diagnosed at birth and persisting after the 4th day of life, were analysed retrospectively to determine the medium-term prognosis and to identify risk factors. The age of the patients varied: 13 neonates including 10 of less than 5 days of age, and 12 children 1 to 12 years old. Eleven patients belonged to families with long QT syndromes. The recruitment also varied: syncope or near syncope (9 cases), bradycardias or tachyarrhythmias (9 cases) or by systematic familial enquiry (7 cases). The corrected QT interval (QTc) was greater than 0.44 s in all patients, and 17 patients had conduction (atrioventricular or intraventricular) defects and/or ventricular arrhythmias (tachycardia, torsades de pointe or fibrillation). All except two older children were prescribed betablocker therapy and in 6 cases of resistant arrhythmias a pacemaker was implanted. There were 6 deaths: 4 deaths occurred in neonates who had the longest QT intervals (greater than 0.65 s) complicated by conduction defects and tachyarrhythmias. The other 2 fatalities were in older children who both died during syncope. The 19 survivors were followed up for 3 months to 16 years: 4 children with the shortest QTc values (0.44 to 0.48 s) have completely recovered; 2 neonates treated for 9 months and then weaned off therapy without any complications and 2 older children who were not treated. The other 15 cases are all under treatment but do well and have had no syncopal episodes during follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "Lipophilic exaprolol and hydrophilic atenolol differ in their interaction with mast cell membranes. Exaprolol, as compared with atenolol, significantly decreased 32P incorporation into, but increased arachidonic acid liberation from, membrane phospholipids. Moreover, exaprolol significantly decreased phosphate incorporation in compound 48/80 and ConA-PS treated cells and decreased thromboxane formation in stimulated cells. On the other hand, atenolol decreased significantly only arachidonate liberation from stimulated mast cells. These results corroborate to some extent the effect of exaprolol and atenolol on histamine liberation which correlates with their membrane perturbing properties.", 
    "7": "Cyclic AMP production in response to agonists which act at a variety of receptors to either stimulate or inhibit cyclic AMP production has been studied in intact, dissected ciliary processes from rabbit eyes after unilateral surgical removal of the cervical ganglion. Cyclic AMP responses to stimulatory ligands vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), isoproterenol, and forskolin and inhibitory agonists neuropeptide Y (NPY), the synthetic somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995, and alpha-adrenergic agents were investigated in tissues from normal eyes and compared to the same responses in tissues from sympathetically denervated eyes. Neither stimulated cyclic AMP production nor inhibition of stimulated cyclic AMP production was significantly different in tissues from denervated vs. normal eyes. Inhibition of VIP-stimulated cyclic AMP production by epinephrine and paraaminoclonidine in tissues from both normal and denervated eyes was blocked by the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine but not by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin. These data indicate that the VIP, NPY, somatostatin, and alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors which regulate cyclic AMP production in rabbit ciliary processes are postjunctional and suggest that ligands known to modulate cyclic AMP levels in this tissue may exert effects on aqueous humor formation independently of adrenergic innervation.", 
    "8": "Beta-adrenoceptor density and affinity, studied by H3-CGP 12177 binding, and adenylate cyclase activity were measured in 12 left ventricles of rabbits with heart failure and compared to 13 left ventricles of control (C) rabbits. Heart failure (HF) was induced by a double volume (aortic insufficiency) plus pressure (aortic stenosis 14 days later) overload. Left ventricular mass was increased in HF by 67% above C. Saturation curves with CGP 12177 showed a 36% decrease in beta-adrenoceptor density (C = 61.5 +/- 5.4 fmol/mg prot., P less than 0.05) but competition curves with isoproterenol were not different in HF and C. Basal and Gpp(NH)p stimulated adenylate cyclase activity were decreased by 36% and 22% respectively in rabbits with heart failure as compared with control animals and cAMP production was significantly smaller in failing left ventricles than in control left ventricles both after NaF stimulation (C: 161.3 +/- 24.9 pmols/mg/min; HF: 98.8 +/- 7.0 pmols/mg/min; P less than 0.05) and even more after forskolin stimulation (C: 159.1 +/- 23.9 and HF: 60.8 +/- 7.3 pmols/mg/min; P less than 0.01). Although isoproterenol stimulated ACA was smaller in HF than in C, EC50 was similar in both groups (1.6 x 10(-7) M). We conclude that in the early stage of heart failure in the rabbit, although adrenoceptor density is decreased, there are no changes of affinity of beta-adrenoceptors for isoproterenol and the major alteration of cAMP production appears to lie down-stream the receptor level with a markedly impaired stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by forskolin.", 
    "9": "The relationship of body fat distribution to insulin and the catecholamines, hormones that affect lipolysis differentially by fat site, was examined within an environmental context, including factors of medication use, physical activity, dietary intake, educational attainment, and age. Four cross-sectional body fat areas (cm2) were determined by three computed tomography (CT) scans (subcutaneous chest fat at the level of the nipples, subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat at the level of the umbilicus, and subcutaneous left mid-thigh fat) in 191 second-generation Japanese-American men aged 45-74 years. The site-specific fat measurements were first examined in relation to use of beta-adrenergic antagonists, then to fasting plasma insulin and C-peptide levels and to urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine levels from a 24-h urine collection made during usual daily activities. Greater fat stores in the intra-abdominal area, even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI, weight/height2) and presence of coronary heart disease, were found to be related to use of beta-adrenergic antagonists. In men taking no adrenergic antagonists (n = 157), after adjustment for BMI, truncal fat measurements of the chest (partial r = -0.16, P less than 0.05) and intra-abdominal area (partial r = -0.21, P less than 0.05) were found to be inversely related to epinephrine, and intra-abdominal fat (partial r = 0.25, P less than 0.01) alone was directly related to fasting plasma insulin. With respect to other environmental variables, the significant inverse relationship of intra-abdominal fat (adjusted for BMI) with physical activity (partial r = -0.17, P less than 0.05) and the significant difference in intra-abdominal fat by educational attainment (college 102.3 +/- 5.7 vs no college 115.7 +/- 6.1 cm2, P = 0.03) became non-significant with adjustment, using multiple regression analysis, for insulin in the case of physical activity and epinephrine in the case of educational attainment. Thus, intra-abdominal fat showed a unique set of relationships to metabolic parameters which could be further related to certain environmental variables.", 
    "10": "A study was undertaken to determine the presence and distribution of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in the sheep bladder body and base. In the bladder body, noradrenaline and isoproterenol induced relaxation which was significantly inhibited by propranolol, pafenolol and butoxamine. In the presence of propranolol (10(-5) M), noradrenaline induced a small contraction, as well as phenylephrine, but B-HT 920 failed to cause any effect on the bladder body. In the bladder base, noradrenaline caused a contraction that was significantly inhibited by prazosin but not by yohimbine. Phenylephrine also induced a contractile response in this structure which was inhibited by prazosin. Isoproterenol caused a relaxation that was significantly inhibited by propranolol and pafenolol but not by butoxamine. Relaxation was mediated by both beta 1 and beta 2-adrenoceptors in the detrusor muscle and by beta 1-adrenoceptors in the bladder base. Alpha 1-adrenoceptors contributed to maintain the detrusor tone and contract the bladder base.", 
    "11": "The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible humoral beta 2-adrenergic effect on the capillary pressure autoregulation capacity in cat skeletal muscle during bleeding. For this purpose capillary pressure autoregulation in response to graded decrease in arterial pressure was studied in sympathectomized muscle in the control state, and during haemorrhagic hypovolaemia in the presence and absence of selective beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade (ICI 118,551). The study was performed with a technique that permits continuous recordings of average capillary pressure in absolute terms and of the regional pre- and postcapillary vascular resistance, from which the pre- to post capillary resistance ratio could be determined. In the pre-haemorrhagic control state, an experimental decrease in arterial pressure from 100 to 50 mmHg caused a fall of capillary pressure from 17.6 by only 1.7 mmHg (delta PA/delta Pc = 29), demonstrating an efficient capillary pressure autoregulation. This autoregulation was accomplished by a decrease in pre- to post capillary resistance ratio in turn being a result of active precapillary dilatation and a passive increase in post capillary vascular resistance. Haemorrhage per se, via a humoral alpha-adrenergic preferentially precapillary vasoconstriction, caused a decrease in capillary pressure to 16.8 mmHg at arterial pressure 100 mmHg. A superimposed decrease in arterial pressure to 50 mmHg resulted in a capillary pressure fall by 3.7 mmHg (delta PA/delta Pc = 14), indicating impaired auto-regulation capacity. This attenuation to a great extent could be ascribed to adrenaline-induced B2-adrenoceptor stimulation, since beta 2-blockade restored the delta arterial pressure/capillary pressure ratio to 20. Low-dose isoprenaline infusion in the control state similarly caused marked impairment of capillary pressure autoregulation. The beta 2-adrenergic attenuation of capillary pressure autoregulation appears to be a beneficial effect in haemorrhagic hypotension, since it lowers capillary pressure passively in relation to the arterial pressure fall, thereby reinforcing the alpha-adrenergic active capillary pressure decrease, leading to more effective transcapillary fluid absorption and, hence, improved replenishment of plasma volume.", 
    "12": "Celiprolol is a 'third generation' beta-blocking agent which is claimed to avoid problems associated with simpler beta-blockers, such as vasoconstriction, bronchoconstriction and myocardial depression. A double-blind randomized study was undertaken in 30 patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension to compare the haemodynamic effects of single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg kg-1 celiprolol (N = 16) and metoprolol (N = 14). Following celiprolol administration, the tendency was for myocardial function to improve or remain unchanged; left ventricular end-systolic volume and ejection fraction improved significantly (P less than 0.05). However, following metoprolol administration, the tendency was for myocardial function to deteriorate, with significant falls in cardiac output (P less than 0.05), ejection fraction (P less than 0.05) and velocity of circumferential shortening (P less than 0.01). There was a tendency for peripheral resistance to fall slightly with celiprolol but to rise markedly with metoprolol (pNS). Left ventricular pressure-volume loops showed improved performance with celiprolol and deterioration with metoprolol. Both drugs resulted in increases in coronary flow and myocardial oxygen consumption (P less than 0.05). Metoprolol, but not celiprolol, resulted in some deterioration in regional left ventricular wall motion (P less than 0.05). Celiprolol appears to be haemodynamically advantageous compared to metoprolol in patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension.", 
    "13": "The effects of topically applied bunazosin hydrochloride, a selective alpha 1 blocker under development as a drug to treat glaucoma, were studied in regard to the choroidal capillary blood flow, intraocular pressure (IOP), and blood pressure in albino rabbit eyes in comparison with propranolol hydrochloride, a non-selective beta blocker. The capillary blood flow was measured using a thermal diffusion flowmeter. Single instillations (50 ul) of 0.005% bunazosin hydrochloride, lowered the IOP to almost the same degree as did 1.0% propranolol hydrochloride. The maximum decreases from initial IOP were 3.3 +/- 1.2, 3.6 +/- 1.7 mmHg for bunazosin hydrochloride and propranolol hydrochloride, respectively. No significant effect on mean blood pressure was observed with these instillations. The choroidal capillary blood flow was reduced by propranolol hydrochloride for 3 hours after instillation (maximum rate of decrease was 10.0 +/- 4.6%), while it was increased by bunazosin hydrochloride for 150 min. (maximum rate of increase was 8.3 +/- 3.8%). When phenylephrine hydrochloride (0.5%), an alpha 1 agonist, was instilled with bunazosin hydrochloride (0.005%), the choroidal capillary blood flow showed no significant change. This was felt to imply an action mechanism involving the alpha 1 receptor.", 
    "14": "Applying a metaanalysis, it was examined whether a combination of drugs is superior to monotherapy in the treatment of angina pectoris. The three classical groups of anti-anginal drugs, nitrates, calcium channel blockers and beta-receptor blockers were investigated. For data analysis, patients were divided in those suffering from \"angina pectoris\" and those suffering from \"angina pectoris despite monotherapy.\" In patients with the inclusion criterium \"angina pectoris\" combination of drugs is not superior to monotherapy. This applies to the evaluation criteria \"improvement of symptoms\" and \"reduction of ischemia\". In patients with the inclusion criterium \"angina pectoris despite monotherapy\" however, there is a clear superiority of drug combination as compared to monotherapy. Again this applies to the evaluation criteria \"improvement of symptoms\" and \"reduction in myocardial ischemia\". With respect to antianginal efficacy all three possible combinations appear to be similar. If the evaluation criterium is \"improvement of prognosis\" no data are available with regard to drug combination. Furthermore no data are available on the prognostic effect of an anti-anginal therapy in patients with stable angina pectoris. A significant improvement of prognosis could be demonstrated for beta-receptor blocking agents without ISA in unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, and in the postinfarction period. The effect of calcium channel blockers on prognosis depends on the substance class applied and on the presence or absence of signs of congestive heart failure. Monotherapy with nifedipine in instable angina and acute myocardial infarction fails to improve prognosis, and there even may be a tendency to adverse effects. In the absence of signs of congestive heart failure verapamil has been demonstrated to improve prognosis in the post infarction period. Likewise, improvement of prognosis by the administration of diltiazem in acute myocardial infarction only could be demonstrated in patients without signs of heart failure. In contrast, in patients with signs of congestive heart failure diltiazem increased the rate of reinfarction and mortality. For nitrates only in acute myocardial infarction a trend towards improved prognosis has been shown. Especially for nitrates the data on prognosis in coronary heart disease available so far are not convincing.", 
    "15": "'Primary cardioprotection' has, arguably, already been shown with thiazide diuretics and probably with beta-blockers. The proven safety and efficacy of these established drugs override any theoretical or experimental considerations in favour of ACE inhibitors. It is unfortunate that, as yet, the number of hypotheses generated in support of ACE inhibitors has not been matched by large scale clinical trials employing these drugs. The first report of the clinical use of an ACE inhibitor was in 1984; it is high time comparative studies with conventional, and proven, agents were undertaken. With regard to 'secondary cardioprotection', there is overwhelming evidence in favour of the use of beta-blockers in patients with myocardial ischaemia. Indeed, we would argue that ACE inhibitors should be used with caution in such patients to avoid impairment of coronary infusion. In the patient with acute myocardial infarction, intravenous nitrates are cheap, easy to use, safe and seem to be effective (in preventing early remodelling and reducing mortality). In the subacute phase, beta-blockers improve prognosis and, according to the currently available evidence in humans, nitrates are as effective as captopril in altering late remodelling; as in the acute situation, nitrates are cheaper, simpler to use and have a track record of long-term safety. ACE inhibitors improve symptoms, exercise capacity and prognosis in chronic heart failure. In this condition, they have been a major therapeutic advance and, on the available evidence, are to be initially preferred to other vasodilators though they should be given in addition to diuretics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "The cardiovascular effects of dopamine are different before and during thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA). To evaluate underlying adrenoceptor-mediated mechanisms, dopamine effects were investigated in nine chloralose-anesthetized dogs. The circulatory response to dopamine (0-40 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) was studied before and during TEA, and during TEA after introducing the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin (0.3 mg.kg-1), the alpha 2-antagonist rauwolscine (0.3 mg.kg-1), and the beta 1-antagonist metoprolol (0.5 mg.kg-1). TEA decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 29%, cardiac output (CO) by 36%, heart rate (HR) by 27%, and the maximum rate of change of left ventricular pressure (LVdP/dt) by 52%. Systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance and mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) remained unaltered by TEA. Dopamine-induced increases in MAP and HR were augmented by TEA. Both MAP and LVdP/dt increased above pre-TEA levels at 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. Prazosin attenuated the increases in MAP and MPAP by dopamine. Adding rauwolscine almost abolished the dopamine response in MAP and MPAP. Metoprolol almost eliminated the dopamine effects on CO and LVdP/dt. Only minor alterations in cardiac filling pressures were observed during the study. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration was lower during than before TEA at corresponding dopamine infusion rates. NE was reduced by the beta 1-blockade. During TEA, the plasma dopamine levels were generally higher, and they were further increased by adding beta 1-blockade. In conclusion, myocardial contractility and arterial pressure were restored to pre-TEA values by dopamine at 5-10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "Resection of bilateral pheochromocytomas of a 33-year-old man with Sipple syndrome was scheduled. Oral prazosin was started twenty days before the operation and increased to a maintenance dose of 6 mg per day. Oral lavetalol 300 mg per day was added for five days before the operation because prazosin alone was insufficient. Intravascular volume was expanded with two units of stored whole blood per day for four days before the operation for preoperative preparation. Anesthesia was induced with thiamylal 250 mg and vecuronium bromide 9 mg, and maintained with enflurane, nitrous oxide and oxygen. Phentolamine, labetalol and nitroglycerin were used for treatment of hypertensive crises during operation and anesthesia. To combat hypotension which follows the resection of the tumor, continuous infusion of norepinephrine was used for four hours after the operation. There were no hypotensive periods and no complications. After removing bilateral pheochromocytomas of the adrenals, treatment of full adrenocortical replacement therapy was performed. Concurrent use of alpha-and beta-adrenergic blocking agents was important for successful anesthetic management for the resection of pheochromocytoma.", 
    "18": "In the course of adaptation of the rabbit heart to volume load passive diastolic properties of the hypertrophic ventricle and myocardium were changing significantly. On day 30 following perforation of the aortic valve stiffness of the ventricle was reduced, yet normalized ventricular stiffness and myocardial stiffness were increased. These changes were prevented by beta adrenergic blockade during development of adaptation of the heart to volume load. Although ventricular stiffness was reduced, normalized ventricular stiffness and myocardial stiffness remained at the level of control values. The demonstrated effect of beta adrenergic blockade on passive diastolic properties of the ventricle and myocardium may be of value in preventing heart failure due to chronic hemodynamic load.

    "19": "To assess the role of catecholamines in the prevention of hypoglycemia during moderate exercise (approximately 60% peak O2 consumption for 60 min), normal humans were studied with combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade and with adrenergic blockade while changes in insulin and glucagon were prevented with the islet clamp technique (somatostatin infusion with insulin and glucagon infused at fixed rates). The results were compared with those from an islet clamp alone study. In contrast to a comparison study (saline infusion), adrenergic blockade resulted in a small initial decrease in plasma glucose during exercise, from 5.0 +/- 0.2 to 4.4 +/- 0.2 mmol/l (P less than 0.01), but the level then plateaued. There was a substantial exercise-associated decrement in plasma glucose when insulin and glucagon were held constant, i.e., from 5.5 +/- 0.2 to 3.4 +/- 0.2 mmol/l (P less than 0.0001), but the level again plateaued. However, when insulin and glucagon were held constant and catecholamine actions were blocked simultaneously, progressive hypoglycemia, to 2.6 +/- 0.6 mmol/l (P less than 0.001), developed during exercise. Hypoglycemia was the result of an absent increase in glucose production and an exaggerated initial increase in glucose utilization. Thus we conclude that sympathochromaffin activation plays a minor role when insulin and glucagon are operative, but a catecholamine, probably epinephrine, becomes critical to the prevention of hypoglycemia during exercise when changes in insulin and glucagon do not occur.", 
    "20": "Beta adrenergic antagonists have been demonstrated to show stereoselective affinity for serotonin (5-HT) receptors in the central nervous system, and competitively inhibit 5-HT transport of platelets, but have not previously been evaluated for their influence on either 5-HT receptors or 5-HT transport systems of vascular cells. We have reported stimulation of 5-HT uptake by subjection of endothelial (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC) to anoxia. We now report that (+/-)-propranolol inhibits 5-HT uptake by both room air- and anoxia-exposed EC and SMC in culture. The effect on SMC was more marked than that on EC and showed a similar inhibition as ketanserin. The relative inhibitory potencies of beta adrenergic antagonists and ketanserin on uptake of 5-HT by SMC were as follows: (+/-)-propranolol = ketanserin greater than alprenolol = pindolol greater than oxprenolol = atenolol. The beta adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, produced a high elevation of cyclic AMP in SMC along with a cellular configurational change and partially inhibited uptake of 5-HT. Propranolol inhibited 5-HT uptake both in the presence and absence of isoproterenol plus isobutylmethylxanthine, suggesting that its inhibitory effect was not mediated through its interaction at the beta adrenergic receptor. Kinetic analyses of the effect of propranolol on 5-HT uptake indicated that propranolol reduced 5-HT uptake by noncompetitive inhibition. We conclude that beta adrenergic antagonists block vascular cell uptake of 5-HT through an action other than interaction with the beta adrenergic receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "This study utilized quantitative receptor autoradiography to examine the effects of repeated administration of antidepressants to rats on the binding of the beta adrenoceptor antagonist, 125I-iodopindolol (125I-IPIN) to either beta-1 or beta-2 adrenoceptors in various regions of brain. Antidepressants were selected to represent various chemical and pharmacological classes including tricyclic compounds (desipramine and protriptyline), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (clorgyline, phenelzine and tranylcypromine), atypical antidepressants (mianserin and trazodone) and selective inhibitors of the uptake of serotonin (citalopram and sertraline). Additionally, rats were treated with various psychotropic drugs that lack antidepressant efficacy (cocaine, deprenyl, diazepam and haloperidol). Repeated treatment of rats with desipramine, protriptyline, clorgyline, phenelzine, tranylcypromine or mianserin reduced the binding of 125I-IPIN to beta-1 adrenoceptors in many brain areas. Only in the basolateral and lateral nuclei of the amygdala did all six of these antidepressants significantly reduce 125I-IPIN binding to beta-1 adrenoceptors. In these amygdaloid nuclei, the magnitude of the reduction in the binding of 125I-IPIN caused by each of these drugs was comparable to or greater than the reduction in binding produced in any other region of brain. Reductions of binding of 125I-IPIN after antidepressant treatments were not consistently observed in the cortex, the area of brain examined most often in homogenate binding studies. Only the monoamine oxidase inhibitors caused reductions in the binding of 125I-IPIN to beta-2 adrenoceptors, and this effect was generally localized to the amygdala and hypothalamus. Repeated treatment of rats with citalopram, sertraline, or trazodone or with drugs lacking clinical antidepressant efficacy caused no significant effects on the binding of 125I-IPIN to either subtype of beta adrenoceptor in any region of brain. These results demonstrate that amygdaloid beta-1 adrenoceptors are particularly susceptible to regulation by certain antidepressant treatments and implicate the amygdala as an important site of action for antidepressants with pharmacological activity on noradrenergic neurons.", 
    "22": "Emergency care of patients with acute myocardial infarction requires active decision making to use agents that may improve morbidity and mortality. Thrombolysis remains the primary tool to accomplish this goal. Other pharmacologic agents, including lidocaine, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and aspirin, have been used acutely in myocardial infarction in the hopes of preventing death and salvaging myocardium. The decision to select one or all of these agents requires a knowledge of the clinical evidence of their efficacy and risk-to-benefit ratios. The clinical studies of the use of these agents acutely in the management of myocardial infarction are reviewed.",

    "24": "In this study, echocardiograms were recorded during step-wise infusion of dobutamine to a maximum dose of 30 micrograms/kg/min in 103 patients who also underwent quantitative coronary angiography. The echocardiograms were digitally stored and displayed in a format that allowed simultaneous analysis of rest and stress images. Development of a new abnormality in regional function was used as an early end point for the dobutamine infusion. No patient had a symptomatic arrhythmia or complications from stress-induced ischemia. Significant coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis) was present in 35 of 55 patients who had normal echocardiograms at rest. The sensitivity and specificity of dobutamine-induced wall motion abnormalities for coronary artery disease was 89% (31 of 35) and 85% (17 of 20), respectively. The sensitivity was 81% (17 of 21) in those with one-vessel disease and 100% (14 of 14) in those with multivessel or left main disease. Forty-one of 48 patients with abnormal echocardiograms at baseline had localized rest wall motion abnormalities. Fifteen had coronary artery disease confined to regions that had abnormal rest wall motion, and 26 had disease remote from these regions. Thirteen of 15 patients (87%) without remote disease did not develop remote stress-induced abnormalities, and 21 of 26 (81%) who had remote disease developed corresponding abnormalities.",

    "26": "Bleeding from esophagogastric varices carries a high mortality rate. Active variceal bleeding can usually be temporarily controlled medically with a combination of intravenous vasopressin and nitroglycerin, with balloon tamponade, or with endoscopic sclerotherapy. Because of the high likelihood of recurrence, long-term treatment, such as repeated sclerotherapy, propranolol therapy, or shunt surgery, is necessary. The proper selection of such measures requires consideration of the site of variceal bleeding, local availability of specialized techniques, and patient factors. Only liver transplantation reverses the liver damage and offers hope of improved long-term survival. As success at identifying high-risk patients by endoscopic features improves, propranolol or other pharmacologic prophylaxis may become an acceptable treatment.", 
    "27": "A previously healthy 26-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of a severe, throbbing, and bifrontal headache. Initial vital signs were pulse rate, 130 beats/min; blood pressure, 128/50 mm Hg; temperature, 100.1 degrees F. Shortly thereafter the patient's pulse and temperature increased to 170 beats/min and 103 degrees F, respectively. Physical examination showed a tremulous, anxious woman in moderate distress who had a diffusely and symmetrically enlarged thyroid gland. A diagnosis of thyrotoxic crisis was made, and appropriate therapy instituted, including the use of an esmolol infusion for control of hypersympathetic activity. A review of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of thyrotoxic crisis is presented.", 
    "28": "Thirty patients undergoing resection of arteriovenous malformations with deliberate hypotension were randomized to receive 1 of 3 hypotensive agents. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide in all patients. Mean arterial pressure was reduced 20% to 60-65 mm Hg with use of either isoflurane (less than or equal to 4%), sodium nitroprusside (less than or equal to 8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), or esmolol (less than or equal to 24 mg/min). Esmolol was associated with a decrease in cardiac output from 6.2 +/- 1.3 to 3.8 +/- 0.8 L/min, which, because of a 22% increase in systemic vascular resistance, far exceeded the reduction in mean arterial pressure. Systemic vascular resistance increased despite a 32% decrease in plasma renin activity. In contrast, with sodium nitroprusside or isoflurane, the decrease in mean arterial pressure was associated with decreases in systemic vascular resistance of similar magnitude, with no change in cardiac output. Plasma renin activity levels increased 48% with sodium nitroprusside and 126% with isoflurane. Heart rate increased 13% with sodium nitroprusside, remained unchanged with isoflurane, and decreased 23% with esmolol. Although esmolol may be used as a primary hypotensive agent, the potential for marked myocardial depression must be recognized. The differences in pharmacologic properties for the different hypotensive agents suggest that combinations of these agents may provide a pharmacologic profile superior to either agent alone.", 
    "29": "To assess the effects of beta blockers on lipids and apolipoproteins in cigarette smokers and nonsmokers, 330 patients with systemic hypertension received 1 month of placebo and 6 months of beta-blocker monotherapy. Serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apolipoproteins A1 and B were measured. Total cholesterol increased with propranolol (smokers vs nonsmokers, 8 vs 2%); increased for smokers and decreased for nonsmokers with atenolol (8 vs -3%), metoprolol (6 vs -1%) and pindolol (7 vs -6%); and decreased for both groups with celiprolol (-3 vs -10%). HDL cholesterol decreased with propranolol (smokers vs nonsmokers, -8 vs -18%), atenolol (-7 vs -2%) and metoprolol (-12 vs -1%); increased for smokers and decreased for nonsmokers with pindolol (11 vs -2%); and increased for both groups with celiprolol (5 vs 6%). Similar trends were observed with LDL cholesterol and the total/HDL cholesterol ratio. It is concluded that early noncardioselective beta blockers such as propranolol have significant dyslipidemic effects in both smokers and nonsmokers. Cardioselective drugs such as atenolol and metoprolol, or drugs with partial agonist activity such as pindolol, have variable effects. Celiprolol, a new, highly cardioselective beta 1 blocker with partial beta 2 agonist activity and vasodilatory properties, has favorable effects on lipids and minimizes the dyslipidemic effects associated with smoking.", 
    "30": "Depression is frequently seen in patients following myocardial infarction (MI), many of whom are receiving digitalis glycosides, beta-blockers, or other agents that may exert central nervous system (CNS) effects. In a prospective study of the clinical significance of post-MI depression, 335 patients were assessed using a standardized diagnostic interview for depression at 8 to 10 days, and 190 were reinterviewed at 3 to 4 months. Patients prescribed digitalis, beta-blockers, or other cardioactive medications at hospital discharge were identified. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the contribution of these agents to depression at 3 to 4 months, controlling for medical and sociodemographic factors as well as for baseline depression. Treatment with digitalis predicted depression at 3 to 4 months (p less than 0.05); no other medications, including beta-blockers, predicted depression (p greater than 0.10). Digitalis may have CNS effects that contribute to depression post-MI and this finding should be considered in the differential diagnosis of depression in cardiac patients.", 
    "31": "To assess the effect of the ultrashort-acting beta blocker esmolol on ischemia induced by acute coronary occlusion, we studied 16 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty. Doppler echocardiography and ECG monitoring were performed continuously before, during, and after balloon occlusion in the drug-free state and during esmolol infusion. Fourteen of the 16 patients had ST segment elevation during balloon inflation. However, maximal ST segment elevation (2.1 +/- 1.5 mm vs 1.7 +/- 1.3 mm, p less than 0.001) and duration of ST segment elevation (68 +/- 20 seconds vs 54 +/- 19 seconds, p less than 0.05) were both significantly reduced during esmolol infusion. Furthermore, the decrease in ejection fraction seen during drug-free balloon occlusions was significantly blunted during esmolol infusion. In the baseline state ejection fraction decreased from 55% to 38% (p less than 0.05) during coronary occlusion compared with a decrease from 52% to 49% (p = NS) during esmolol infusion. In addition, esmolol appeared to delay the onset of segmental wall motion abnormalities after coronary occlusion, occurring at a mean of 40 seconds after balloon inflation versus a mean of 31 seconds in the absence of beta blockade (p less than 0.05). Thus the use of ultrashort-acting beta blockade appears to diminish the extent and delay the onset of myocardial ischemia during acute coronary occlusion.", 
    "32": "To explore the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on low heart rate-related (mental stress) ischemia, 19 patients with coronary artery disease were randomized into a double-blind crossover trial of metoprolol, 100 mg twice daily, and underwent serial mental stress/bicycle exercise studies. Mental stress-induced wall motion abnormalities occurred at a lower heart rate than exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities during placebo administration (81 +/- 16 vs. 123 +/- 20 beats/min, p less than 0.05). Metoprolol reduced the mean magnitude of exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities (2.8 +/- 2.0 vs. 1.6 +/- 2.4, p = 0.003); improvement was related to the magnitude of hemodynamic beta-blockade effect. Metoprolol did not significantly reduce the mean magnitude of mental stress-induced wall motion abnormalities (3.0 +/- 2.2 vs. 2.6 +/- 2.2), although individual responses predominantly either improved (50%) or worsened (29%). Unlike exercise, the magnitude of hemodynamic beta-blockade did not predict mental stress response and metoprolol did not block mental stress-induced blood pressure elevations. Patients with abolition of exercise-induced ischemia were more likely to have reduction of mental stress-induced ischemia. Patients whose ischemia worsened with metoprolol during mental stress had more easily inducible ischemia, as assessed by exercise-induced placebo wall motion abnormality, chest pain and prior myocardial infarction. Beta-blockade was associated with a lowering of ischemia-related hemodynamic thresholds compared with placebo. These results suggest that beta-blockade has a variable effect on low heart rate-related ischemia that may be due to a lack of effect on mental stress-induced blood pressure elevation in patients with easily induced ischemia or to effects on coronary vasomotor tone, or both.", 
    "33": "Although the mechanism is unknown, clinical trials have suggested that intravenous beta-adrenergic blockade may prevent early cardiac rupture after myocardial infarction. Previous studies have examined effects of beta-blockers on global left ventricular function after myocardial infarction; however, few data exist regarding their immediate effects on regional function or in patients after successful reperfusion. Therefore, 65 patients in whom thrombolysis with or without coronary angioplasty achieved reperfusion at 4.6 +/- 1.7 h from symptom onset were studied. Low osmolarity contrast ventriculograms were obtained immediately before and after administration of 15 mg of intravenous metoprolol (n = 54) or placebo (n = 11). Intravenous metoprolol immediately decreased heart rate (from 92 to 76 beats/min, p less than 0.0001), increased left ventricular diastolic volume (from 150 to 163 ml, p less than 0.001) and systolic volume (from 72 to 77 ml, p less than 0.0005) but did not change systolic and diastolic pressures. Although there was no difference in ejection fraction after metoprolol, centerline chord analysis revealed reduced noninfarct zone motion (from 0.41 to 0.12 SD/chord, p less than 0.05), improved infarct zone motion (from -3.1 to -2.9 SD/chord, p less than 0.01) and smaller circumferential extent of hypokinesia (from 30 to 27 chords, p less than 0.05). Patients with dyskinesia of the infarct zone had the most striking improvement in infarct zone wall motion. Because these changes occurred immediately after beta-blockade, they could not be attributed to myocardial salvage. No significant changes in heart rate, left ventricular volumes or regional wall motion were apparent in the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "Beta-adrenergic blockade represents a promising therapeutic approach to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Bucindolol, a new beta-blocker, showed favorable effects in a short-term (3 month) trial in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. To assess long-term response, 20 study patients (7 of 9 patients previously assigned to the placebo group and 13 of 14 patients previously assigned to bucindolol therapy) received long-term bucindolol therapy and were followed up for a mean of 23 +/- 4 months (range 17 to 30). The mean patient age was 49 years (range 29 to 66) and the median duration of disease was 11 months (range 1 to 190). Ten patients were in functional class II and 10 were in class III; 15 patients were men. At the end of the common follow-up time, all 20 patients were alive, 17 continued to receive bucindolol (mean dose 176 mg/day, range 25 to 200), and 2 underwent cardiac transplantation. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from a baseline value of 25 +/- 8% to 35 +/- 13% (n = 19 pairs, p less than 0.001). Functional class improved in 12, was unchanged in 5 and deteriorated in 3 (p = 0.056). Exercise time was maintained (9.4 +/- 3.1 versus 9.1 +/- 3.5 min, n = 19, p = NS), as was maximal oxygen uptake (19.2 +/- 4.9 versus 18.8 +/- 5.7 ml/kg per min, n = 19, p = NS). Thus, long-term bucindolol therapy leads to substantial increases in ejection fraction and to improved functional class while stable exercise performance is maintained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "Six beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs, atenolol, metoprolol, nadolol, oxprenolol, propranolol and sotalol, were found to react with sodium nitrite in HCl solution, yielding the corresponding N-nitrosamines. The genotoxic activity of the six nitrosamines was evaluated in primary cultures of both rat and human hepatocytes; DNA fragmentation was measured by the alkaline elution technique, and DNA repair synthesis by quantitative autoradiography. Positive dose-related responses were produced in cells of both species after 20 h of exposure to the following subtoxic concentrations: NO-propranolol, 0.01-0.1 mM; NO-oxprenolol, 0.03-1 mM; NO-atenolol and NO-metoprolol, 0.1-1 mM; and NO-nadolol and NO-sotalol, 0.3-3 mM. Modest but statistically significant differences between the DNA-damaging potencies for the two species were observed with NO-atenolol and NO-oxprenolol, which were both more active against rat hepatocytes, and with NO-propranolol, which was more active against human hepatocytes. At equal or higher concentrations, the six N-nitrosamines did not produce DNA fragmentation in Chinese hamster lung V79 cells; this indicates that they behave as indirectly acting compounds, which need to be transformed into reactive metabolites in order to exert a genotoxic effect.", 
    "36": "The effects of short-term administration of indomethacin and propranolol were studied in two groups of patients with borderline hypertension and both central and peripheral hyperkinesia. Indomethacin and propranolol both significantly increased total peripheral resistance (respectively +32 +/- 3%, +59 +/- 7%, p less than 0.001). The increase in blood pressure after administrating propranolol was not significant (+3 +/- 2%), as opposed to what was obtained with indomethacin, (+5 +/- 2%, p less than 0.02). On the brachial artery, Indomethacin had no effect on blood flow and local resistance, on the other hand propranolol induced a decrease in blood flow in the brachial artery (-43 +/- 3%, p less than 0.001) and an elevation of local resistance (+105 +/- 18%, p less than 0.01). While central hyperkinesia depends on both prostaglandins and on the beta-adrenergic system, high muscle blood flow seems to be regulated by the beta-adrenergic system alone, without participation of prostaglandins.", 
    "37": "Human placental microvillous membrane vesicles (MMV) were purified by precipitation of non-microvillous membrane with MgCl2. Two aspects of MMV preparation were found to be important to the interpretation of amino acid transport studies: (1) storage conditions, and (2) preservation of cytoskeletal elements. In non-frozen MMV, MeAIB uptake was stimulated by an inward Na+ gradient and showed 'overshoot'. The initial Na(+)-dependent uptake rate was concentration-dependent with a Vmax of 640 +/- 80 pmol/mg/30 sec and a Km of 0.44 +/- 0.77 mM. Na(+)-stimulated cysteine uptake (65 +/- 23 pmol/mg/30 sec), previously thought to be very low or absent in the human placenta, was comparable to MeAIB, although there was no 'overshoot'. Cysteine uptake was partially stimulated by Li+. In general, freezing and storage at either -80 degrees C or -196 degrees C markedly reduced Na(+)-dependent uptake of several amino acids, compared to vesicles stored at 4 degrees C. The greatest reduction was seen with storage at -80 degrees C, especially with cysteine. There was no effect of storage temperature on Na(+)-independent amino acid uptake. For frozen vesicles, there was no difference in uptake for 12 versus 60 h storage. Removal of cytoskeletal proteins with the chaotropic agent, KSCN, resulted in greater enrichment of MMV marker proteins, but the preparation lost the capacity for active MeAIB uptake. These data, especially with regard to storage conditions, highlight the importance of precise definition of preparation and storage conditions when interpreting results of amino acid uptake by human placental MMV.", 
    "38": "beta-Adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors have been investigated in human lung parenchyma during cancer and chronic pneumonia as compared with normal tissue, obtained after segmental resection of tuberculoma from surrounding normal tissues. Binding of beta-adrenergic radioligand 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) and muscarinic antagonist 3H-quinuclidinyl benzylate (3H-QNB) was saturating with high rate of affinity in lung parenchyma membranes of both controls and patients with cancer and chronic pneumonia. Amount of binding sites of 3H-QNB was significantly increased in cancer (Bmax = 377.5 +/- 65.5 fmole/mg) and did not change in chronic pneumonia (Bmax = 97.7 +/- 14.7 fmole/mg) as compared with normal tissues (Bmax = 108.9 +/- 12.1 fmole/mg); a number of binding sites of 3H-DHA was significantly decreased both in lung parenchyma under conditions of cancer (Bmax = 84.1 +/- 14.5 fmole/mg) and chronic pneumonia (Bmax = 113.8 +/- 10.3 fmole/mg) as compared with normal tissue (Bmax = 456.7 +/- 73.7 fmole/mg). The affinity of 3H-DHA and 3H-QNB binding was practically unaltered. The results obtained suggest the important role of beta-adrenergic receptors in formation of lung cancer in the patients with pneumonia.", 
    "39": "The effect of norepinephrine on human NK cell activity was investigated using a flow cytometry assay. NK cell activity was found to be inhibited by direct addition of norepinephrine to lymphocyte/target cell mixtures in a dose-dependent fashion. This inhibitory effect of norepinephrine was blocked by propranolol but not by atenolol. The results suggest that norepinephrine has a negative influence on NK cell activity and that the effect of norepinephrine is mediated via beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "40": "During early postnatal development rat pups were treated twice daily with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (15 mg/kg) in order to study the acute and long-lasting effects of early blockade of noradrenergic beta-mediated neurotransmission. Treatments from postnatal days 1-10 or days 11-20 did not induce alterations in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors as measured three days after the last injection, nor could lasting effects be shown at 60 days of age. The day 1-10 treatment, however, had a significant effect on the regional brain levels of noradrenaline (NA) and its metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), measured 90 min after the last injection. The metabolite had increased by 40% in all brain regions examined. On day 60, the MHPG concentrations were still increased when compared to postnatally saline-treated animals. Propranolol treatment from day 11-20 only marginally increased MHPG on day 20 and induced no lasting differences. These results suggest that propranolol treatment during the first ten days of life produces a long-lasting increase in NA metabolism, possibly reflecting an increased neuronal NA turnover.", 
    "41": "The experiments on rats have shown that the activation of alpha-adrenoceptors decreases the glomerular filtration as well as sodium and water reabsorption against a background of a decrease in the blood content of vasopressin, renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone and a fall of the renal cortex level of thromboxane B2. alpha-, alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors blockade decreases diuresis as well as sodium and potassium excretion due to an increase in the level of vasopressin, renin and insulin. The stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors accelerates the glomerular filtration, decreases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion against a background of an increase in the secretion of vasopressin, renin, insulin and a fall of the blood level of angiotensin II and aldosterone and an elevation of the prostaglandin E2 content in the renal cortex. A conclusion is drawn that the adrenergic regulation of the kidneys is mediated to a considerable degree by hormones which regulate the water-salt metabolism and vascular tonus in vivo.", 
    "42": "In chronic experiments on 26 male rats solutions of norepinephrine and isoprenaline were introduced through chemotrode to anterior hypothalamus. These solutions were used either solely or were followed by the blockade of the same-called vessel adrenergic receptors. It is shown that adrenoreactive structures of the anterior hypothalamus realize their action through adrenergic structures of the vessel wall in the process of blood coagulation.", 
    "43": "Mucociliary transport plays an important role in the lung defense mechanism by clearing inhaled particles and bacteria from the respiratory tract. In the present study, we tried to determine whether roxithromycin (RXM), a new semisynthetic macrolide, can affect airway mucociliary functions and, if so, what the mechanism of its action is. To do so we measured ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of rabbit cultured tracheal epithelium by a photoelectric method. Addition of RXM (10(-4) M) to a Rose chamber containing epithelial cells caused a rapid increase in CBF from 12.1 +/- 0.6 to 16.2 +/- 0.8 Hz (mean +/- SE, p less than 0.001) within 5 min. This effect was dose-dependent, the maximal increase from the baseline CBF and EC50 being 34.6 +/- 5.0% and 3 x 10(-6)M, respectively. The increase in CBF produced by RXM (3 x 10(-6)M) was not influenced by pretreatment of cells with the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol, the lipoxygenase inhibitor AA-861, or the Ca(2+)-channel blocker verapamil, but it was partially reduced by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (p less than 0.05). Intracellular cyclic AMP levels were increased by 10(-4)M RXM from 42.3 +/- 8.7 to 72.7 +/- 7.0 pmoles/mg protein (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that RXM stimulates ciliary motility; an effect that may be attributed at least in part to the synthesis of cyclooxygenase products and cyclic AMP, and suggest that this macrolide could be useful in treating patients with impaired mucociliary transport in the airway.", 
    "44": "The authors present a clinico-pathological study on 21 patients who died in acute cerebrovascular diseases. The main myocardial lesions were focal hemorrhages, contraction band necroses and myocarditis. The ECG abnormalities and the pathogenesis of the cardiopathy are discussed on the basis of their investigations and dates of references. Their conclusions is that the heart damages are modulated by catecholamines. The occurrence of this cardiopathy should be prevented by beta-blockers, so the life-expectancy of patients and the number of heart donors could increase.", 
    "45": "Several agents can reduce portal pressure in patients with portal hypertension. These drugs act in different ways and have different actions. Several hemodynamic investigations have elucidated the effects of beta-blockade on the splanchnic circulation. Propranolol and other non-selective beta-blockers significantly decreased portal pressure in patients with cirrhosis. In some patients, beta-blockers did not decrease portal pressure while cardiac output and azygos blood flow significantly decreased. The cause and severity of cirrhosis do not influence the effects of beta-blockers. The efficacy of beta-blockers in the prevention of the first gastrointestinal bleeding is well established. Meta-analysis showed that among patients receiving beta-blockers, 10 per cent bled 1 year after inclusion as against 30 per cent in the placebo group. A significant difference in survival rate was also observed between the two groups. The efficacy of beta-blockers in the prevention of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding is variable; 5 trials showed a significant difference while 3 did not show any significant difference between patients receiving beta-blockers and those receiving a placebo. Meta analysis showed a significant difference in the risk of rebleeding but did not show any difference in survival rate. Thus, beta-blockers reduce the degree of portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis and decrease the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in compliant patients.", 
    "46": "Intra-cerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of glucose (0.1-1.0 mumol) caused dose-dependent increases in resting oxygen consumption (Vo2) of conscious rats (maximum increase of 15.4 +/- 2% at 0.5 mumol). These effects were significantly attenuated by peripheral (i.p.) pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor propranolol, indicating the importance of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in the response. Plasma glucose concentrations were elevated (11%) 30 min after central injection of glucose, but intravenous glucose (0.5 mumol) did not affect resting Vo2. Animals which had been fasted for 12 h prior to Vo2 measurement exhibited reduced basal Vo2 values, but the nutritional state of the animal did not affect the metabolic response to central injections of glucose (0.5 mumol). Rats exhibiting genetic (fa/fa Zucker rats) and hypothalamic (VMH-lesioned) obesity showed similar thermogenic responses to centrally administered glucose, to their lean counterparts. These data suggest a dual action of central glucose in the regulation of energy balance, involving stimulation of energy expenditure in addition to its reported inhibition of energy intake. The defective diet-induced thermogenesis associated with VMH and genetic obesities does not appear to result from an inability to respond to changes in intracerebroventricular glucose concentrations.", 
    "47": "Acute or chronic treatment of young or adult rats with chlorimipramine, tianeptine or iprindole, antidepressants with different effects on 5-HT uptake mechanisms, did not modify the density or the affinity of 5-HT1B receptors of the frontal cortex. No significant receptor change was found after prenatal exposure to these antidepressants. The lack of effect of the antidepressants was not related to the density of 5-HT1B receptors, which was significantly lower in younger animals.", 
    "48": "We investigated the M3/M2 antagonist selectivity of [N-iminomethyl-N'-[(2-hydroxy-2-phenyl-2-cyclohexyl)-ethyl] piperazine HCI (DAC 5945) in vivo. ED50 values for reversal of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction and bradycardia by muscarinic antagonists were determined in anesthetized and ventilated guinea pigs. Atropine, ipratopium, pirenzepine and diphenyl-acetoxy-4-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) were non-selective, whereas methoctramine was cardioselective. In contrast, DAC 5945 was a more potent muscarinic antagonist in the airways than in the heart, demonstrating M3/M2 selectivity in vivo.", 
    "49": "The antihypertensive treatment schedules were investigated in 1,153 consecutive patients in 65 general practices. Treatment consisted mainly of diuretics or betablockers singly or combined. In a sample of 303 of these patients, treatment was altered in a randomised, single-blind, cross-over design to consist of a single daily dose of metoprolol, or a single daily dose of metoprolol plus a single dose of a placebo. The effect of multiple dosages on the quality of life was investigated simultaneously with investigation of the efficacy of single drug treatment with a beta-blocker on blood-pressure control as compared with the previous treatment. A slight increase in side-effects was observed which might be ascribed to increased awareness by the patient and also by the doctor. The more simplified regimen with a single daily dose of the betablocker showed the same blood-pressure levels as in the previous more complicated regimen.", 
    "50": "Along with the beneficial effects of beta blockers in the ischemic derangements of myocardial energy metabolism are nonspecific membrane effects, which are thought to derive from the physicochemical interaction of the drugs with the cell membrane. These interactions are observed in various forms (e.g., membrane stabilizing action, quinidine-like action, cardiodepressant action), depending on the intensity of the interaction and on the method used for their detection. There may be still other manifestations that have not been detected so far, owing to our ignorance of their existence and our lack of an adequate method for their detection. The importance of the presence of specific chemical moieties in certain beta blockers with ability to trap peroxy radicals is also discussed.", 
    "51": "Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs have been used in the treatment of hypertension for more than 2 decades. During this time they have reached the position of first-line therapy for hypertension and are recommended as such by the Joint National Committee (U.S.A.) in 1988 and by the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension in 1983 and 1989. This is because of the favorable relationship between the antihypertensive efficacy of these drugs and the rate and severity of their adverse effects. Of particular interest is the possibility that beta blockers may protect against coronary artery disease (CAD). With regard to secondary prevention against CAD, statistically highly significant and clinically relevant reductions of mortality and the risk of reinfarction have been shown in prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. A primary preventive effect against CAD, on the other hand, has only been shown in open trials without placebo control. However, in spite of the lack of clear proof, this effect still appears to be a logical possibility. Some new findings with beta blockers appear to be of particular interest: beta blockade may reduce myocardial necrosis in patients with marked elevations of plasma catecholamines due to traumatic head injury; a similar protective effect in other situations of severe stress, e.g., acute myocardial infarction, would be of great clinical value. Experimental studies also suggest that beta blockers may have antiatherosclerotic effect in animals fed an atherogenic diet and subjected to stress. Again, clinical confirmation of such results would be of great significance.", 
    "52": "Bopindolol is a nonselective beta blocker with mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. One of the drug's main benefits is its prolonged effect, lasting for 24 hours, which makes it possible to administer bopindolol in a single daily dose, a fact that may improve patient adherence to therapy. A double-blind study was performed in two centers, comparing bopindolol with metoprolol in 86 hypertensive patients. Baseline diastolic blood pressure (BP) was 100 to 120 mm Hg. The effects of bopindolol or metoprolol on BP and heart rate were similar: return to normal values was achieved in 70% of patients with either drug. A 6-month study at another center found that bopindolol did not affect the levels of total cholesterol, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides. Another 12-month study documented a decrease in total cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) A1 and apo B. The apo A/B ratio rose, thus improving the atherosclerotic index. No deterioration of glucose tolerance or immunoreactive insulin response to glucose was seen after 6 months of bopindolol administration. Bopindolol satisfactorily modifies not only resting but also exercise BP during isometric and isotonic load, thus reducing BP fluctuation during physical activities of the hypertensive patient. The drug exerts no effect on renal and liver function, electrolyte balance and hematologic parameters. Bopindolol is a very useful drug of first choice in mild and moderate hypertension. Bopindolol's main advantages include its prolonged action, good tolerance and a beneficial effect on risk factors of atherosclerosis (lipid and carbohydrate metabolism).", 
    "53": "Most antihypertensive drugs act by counteracting vasoconstrictor mechanisms and lower blood pressure by lowering vascular resistance. The beta blockers, which have the unique ability to counteract cardiac sympathetic drive, seem to be a major exception to this. Moreover, their degree of cardiodepression is directly correlated with the initial sympathetic tone and also with their degree of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Cardiodepression initially evokes a baroreflex-mediated proportional rise in vascular resistance. As indicated by review of the literature, the antihypertensive effect of beta blockers always parallels a decline in vascular resistance. Studying beta blockers with different degrees of ISA in 50 hypertensive patients after minimizing cardiac sympathetic drive by strict bed rest showed that the initial effect of the drug is offset by a rise in vascular resistance proportional to the fall in cardiac output. After that, blood pressure always fell in parallel with vascular resistance, whatever the absolute level of cardiac output. In the long run, blood pressure and vascular resistance were always positively correlated, irrespective of the level of cardiac output. Thus, like all other antihypertensive agents, beta blockers also lower blood pressure through interference with a vasoconstrictor mechanism.", 
    "54": "Use of propranolol in the treatment of hyperthyreosis in pregnant women is discussed. It was noted, that propranolol given for 24-28 days in low doses, starting from the 34th-35th week of pregnancy, and in higher doses during 5 or 2 days preceding labour diminishes clinical symptoms of hyperthyreosis. It influences thyreotropic hormone levels. No side effects were seen in neonates of mothers treated with propranolol; thyreotrophic hormone levels were within normal values.", 
    "55": "A simple, specific and rapid reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure for sotalol determination is described requiring small plasma volumes. The high recovery of sotalol from plasma and the high precision of measurement obviate the need for an internal standard. Plasma samples (300 microliters) were deproteinised with 50 microliters of 70% (w/w) perchloric acid in disposable glass tubes. After vortex-mixing and centrifugation, 30 microliters of 4 M K2HPO4 were added followed by gentle shaking. A 20-microliters aliquot was then injected (by autosampler) for HPLC analysis. Chromatography was performed on a glass-lined 250 mm x 4 mm 5-micron C18 steel column. The mobile phase was 6% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.08 M KH2PO4 buffer (pH 4.6). The flow-rate was 0.8 ml/min. Detection was by fluorescence with excitation and emission wavelengths at 235 and 310 nm, respectively. The retention time for sotalol was 7.1 min. Calibration was linear from 0.16 to 10 micrograms/ml in plasma (r greater than 0.999 for detector response to sotalol). The minimum concentration for quantitation was 0.08 micrograms/ml [within assay coefficient of variation (C.V.) less than 5%]. Recovery was near quantitative (greater than 98%) and replicate (intra-assay precision was less than 5% C.V.). Analysis of samples (n = 10) at concentrations of 0.42 and 4.2 micrograms/ml gave mean values of 0.44 and 4.3 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inter-assay C.V. values were 4.5 and 2.2%, respectively. Other clinically used antiarrhythmic drugs did not interfere. This assay can be performed using other commercial C18 analytical columns by suitable adjustment of mobile phase flow-rate and acetonitrile composition.", 
    "56": "An isocratic reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of amidepin has been developed. The method is based on the extraction of alkaline plasma with diethyl ether-dichloromethane, and the injection into the Supelcosil LC-18 column of the evaporated and reconstituted organic phase. After separation, detection is carried out by a fluorescence detector (excitation at 195 nm with no filter). The limit of detection is 10 ng/ml of plasma. The mean coefficient of variation is 12%. The plasma levels after oral administration and after intravenous administration are shown.", 
    "57": "A rapid and sensitive microbore high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay is reported for the quantitation of labetalol, an anti-hypertensive agent, in small volumes (250 microliters) of biological fluids (viz., maternal plasma, fetal plasma, amniotic fluid and fetal tracheal fluid) obtained from the chronically instrumented pregnant sheep. Labetalol was extracted from the samples using ethyl acetate and then partitioned into dilute phosphoric acid. Chromatography was performed on a microbore HPLC system using a 2.1 mm I.D. C18 column and detection was accomplished by a low-dispersion fluorescence detector designed for trace analysis. The drug was well separated from endogenous substances in all biological fluids sampled. The calibration curves were linear for all fluids over the range of study with mean coefficients of variation consistently below 5%. Quantitation was possible down to approximately 30 pg of labetalol injected (approximately 1.6 ng/ml in plasma using 250 microliters).", 
    "58": "Whereas isolated heart preparations or anesthetized animals have been used to assess the actions of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists upon reperfusion-induced arrhythmias, this study evaluated the possible antiarrhythmic effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonism in conscious animals. Conscious, chronically instrumented dogs were subjected to a temporary occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 4 h. After the first hour of reperfusion, flestolol (N-(1,1-dimethyl-2- ureidoethyl)-2-hydroxy-3-(O-fluorobenzoyloxy)-propylamine sulfate), an ultra short-acting beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, was administered i.v. at infusion rates of 1 and 2.6 micrograms/kg per min. A control group received the equivalent volume of saline during this period. Delayed reperfusion-induced arrhythmias were evaluated by using a computerized analysis system. Treatment with flestolol did not affect the total number of beats, the number of normal and ectopic beats, and the arrhythmic ratio, i.e. the ratio of ectopic beats to the total number of beats. Hence, beta-adrenoceptor antagonism does not appear to suppress delayed ectopic activity during coronary reperfusion in conscious dogs.", 
    "59": "Recent studies have demonstrated the activation of phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine both by growth factors and by the product of ras oncogene, ras p21. Also, evidence has been presented indicating that the stimulation of this phospholipid-degradative pathway is sufficient to activate mitogenesis in fibroblasts. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, microinjection of transforming ras p21 is a potent inducer of maturation, whereas microinjection of a neutralizing anti-ras p21 antibody specifically inhibits maturation induced by insulin but not by progesterone. The results presented here demonstrated that microinjection of phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C is sufficient to induce maturation of Xenopus laevis oocytes. Furthermore, microinjection of a neutralizing anti-phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C specifically blocks the maturation program induced by ras p21/insulin but not by progesterone.", 
    "60": "Binding parameters of (-)-iodopindolol to beta 2-adrenoceptors were determined on intact mononuclear cells in 41 untreated patients with different DSM-III subtypes of depression. Both maximal beta-receptor density (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) were not significantly different between control and all depressed subjects. However, Bmax was significantly decreased in unipolar patients as compared to controls (p less than 0.001) whereas no significant difference was found in bipolar or dysthymic patients. In unipolar patients, a very strong association was found between Bmax values and the severity of the depression as assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score (r = -0.75; p less than 0.005). This correlation was also highly significant in the entire depressed population (r = -0.58; p less than 0.0009). These results suggest that the lower number of beta-adrenoceptors in intact leukocyte cells of depressed patients is related to the depression severity.", 
    "61": "The effects of complete fimbria-fornix (FF) lesioning, bilateral medial-FF lesioning and systemic administration of a novel noradrenergic alpha 2-antagonist, atipamezole, on electrophysiological properties of the hippocampal formation were studied in the rat. In the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG) complete FF lesioning abolished the long-term potentiation (LTP) of the population spike (PS), which in control rats could be induced by the application of high-frequency stimulus trains on the medial perforant pathway (PP). Several other electrophysiological properties examined in the medial-FF-lesioned rats changed as well. These changes included a decrease in the efficacy of recurrent inhibition and slight differences in granular cell population response evoked by perforant path stimulation. Also, in the DG the power of awake immobility-related nonrhythmical electroencephalogram (EEG) was significantly lower in FF-lesioned rats than in controls. In the DG of control rats systemic administration of atipamezole (1 mg/kg) shifted the population spike-field postsynaptic potential response curve towards the left. In FF-lesioned rats this drug had no effects. The slight effects of atipamezole would be in line with earlier studies, which have shown that noradrenergic activation facilitates neuronal transmission in the DG. Possible explanations for the changes seen in FF-lesioned rats include deafferentation of different subcortical projections and increased epileptic activity. These established changes in synaptic plasticity, recurrent inhibition, nonrhythmical EEG and evoked responses would indicate that information processing is severely hampered in the first stage of the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit after fimbria-fornix lesioning. Thus, the results show that aminergic/cholinergic projections have a significant role in information processing in the dentate gyrus of hippocampal formation.", 
    "62": "Recurrent syncope in the child with a normal heart poses both diagnostic and therapeutic problems. To assess autonomic contributions to syncope, formal autonomic function testing was performed in 22 children (aged 7 to 18 years) with recurrent syncope and a normal heart. Autonomic testing consisted of eight to nine separate tests; 14 of the 22 patients had reproduction of syncope or symptoms during testing. Patients with a positive test had a lower norepinephrine level while supine (334 +/- 86 versus 547 +/- 169 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and lower norepinephrine level in the upright position (628 +/- 219 versus 891 +/- 270 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) than did patients with a negative test. The slope of heart rate response versus log isoproterenol dose was greater in patients with a positive test than in those with a negative test (1.70 +/- 0.70 versus 0.89 +/- 0.19, p less than 0.01). All five patients with a positive test who were given intravenous propranolol had elimination of syncope with repeat testing. Eight of 10 patients with a positive test were successfully treated with atenolol, including 2 patients without prior resolution of symptoms after pacemaker implantation for symptoms attributed to bradycardia. Beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity may cause recurrent syncope in young patients. Inappropriate heart rate response to standing may elicit the Bezold-Jarisch reflex, resulting in bradycardia or hypotension, or both, in some patients. Beta-adrenergic blockade is of benefit in many of these patients.",

Following initial enzymic hydrolysis, the basic drugs and metabolites are extracted using Clean Screen DAU or Bond Elut Certify cartridges, and analysed as their trimethylsilyl ether or 2-(dimethyl) silamorpholine derivatives by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The method proved to be very sensitive and selective for basic drugs. After administration of therapeutic doses of propranolol, metoprolol, timolol, isoxsuprine and clenbuterol to thoroughbred horses, the parent compound/metabolites could be detected in urine for upto 14-120 h depending on the drug.", 
    "64": "In a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study, diltiazem was compared with metoprolol as add-on therapy to diuretic treatment in 115 patients with hypertension. Following a placebo and diuretic period of four weeks, patients were randomized to either slow release diltiazem 90 mg twice daily or metoprolol 100 mg once daily using a double dummy technique. If after four weeks a target supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) less than or equal to 90 mmHg pressure was not reached, the doses of diltiazem and metoprolol were doubled. Supine inclusion systolic/diastolic blood pressures (SBP/DBP) at randomization were 158 +/- 13 (mean +/- SD)/102 +/- 5 mmHg in the diltiazem group and 158 +/- 17/101 +/- 6 mmHg in the metoprolol group. Active therapy significantly lowered SBP and DBP in both groups by 7-10%. Heart rate was significantly lowered in both groups, although the effect of metoprolol was more pronounced. Response rates (supine DBP less than or equal to 90 mmHg and/or decreased by greater than or equal to 10%) were 43% on diltiazem 90 mg twice daily and 52% on metoprolol 100 mg once daily, increasing to 82% and 62%, respectively, after dose escalations. No serious side effects were seen, but three patients, two on diltiazem and one on metoprolol, were withdrawn from the study due to severe headache, nausea and bradycardia respectively. of mild to moderate adverse reactions, tiredness was most frequent, occurring in 14.5% and 15.8% on active diltiazem and metoprolol therapy, respectively. We conclude that both diltiazem and metoprolol lower BP when added to diuretics in hypertensive patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "A case of Romano-Ward syndrome effectively treated by both propranolol and atrial pacing is reported. A 33 year-old female, who had experienced syncopal episodes since she was 20 years old, had a family history showing her son with QTc 0.46. Her QT-U interval and QTc were both 0.6 second when propranolol was not administered. It shortened to 0.28 second and 0.39 respectively under exercise stress testing, and also shortened to 0.41 second and 0.43 respectively when left satellite ganglion block was used. Electrophysiologic study demonstrated that both sinus and atrioventricular nodal functions were normal, but the refractory periods of right and left ventricle differed significantly, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was induced. Her QT-U and QTc intervals shortened to 0.37 seconds and 0.43 respectively through both the treatment of 80 bpm atrial pacing, and the administration of 80mg propranolol. She has never experienced a syncopal episode.", 
    "66": "The anti-arrhythmic drug efficacy of oral propafenone therapy (300 mg to 900 mg per day) was studied in relation to propafenone and hydroxy-propafenone plasma concentrations in 70 outpatients (46 males, 24 females, mean age 57 +/- 12 years) followed up for 24 +/- 32 months. On average 1.7 plasma concentration measurements were performed per patient. The arrhythmias were effectively controlled in 32 patients, but in another 32 patients propafenone therapy was ineffective; in six patients the evaluation was unclear. The therapy was effective in 66% of patients with ventricular premature beats, in 50% with complex ventricular arrhythmias, in 40% with ventricular tachycardia and in 20% with supraventricular tachycardia. Fifty per cent of patients with coronary heart disease and electrical disease, but only 20% with dilated cardiomyopathy and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome were effectively treated. Measurement of peak plasma propafenone levels performed 4.5 +/- 2 h after oral drug administration revealed no statistically significant dose-plasma concentration relation. Optimal propafenone drug efficacy was documented at propafenone plasma concentrations ranging from 0.20 to 0.60 micrograms/ml (63% of patients considered as effectively treated). There was a trend to decrease propafenone efficacy at plasma concentrations below 0.20 micrograms/ml and above 0.60 micrograms/ml. Analysis of hydroxypropafenone identified four patients as poor metabolizers with unusually high propafenone and low hydroxypropafenone plasma concentrations; only one of these four patients showed drug efficacy. Monitoring of propafenone and hydroxypropafenone plasma concentrations was a practical procedure to assess patient's compliance, to identify poor metabolizers and to guide anti-arrhythmic drug therapy.", 
    "67": "Ten patients with proven single-vessel coronary artery disease and a positive exercise test for ischaemia were investigated to establish the importance and therapeutic implications of dynamic coronary stenosis in such patients. All patients interrupted their anti-anginal therapy and under took serial exercise testing in an attempt to identify variability in the ischaemic threshold. Ergonovine testing was performed in nine patients and all underwent 48 h of ambulatory ST segment monitoring while treatment was discontinued. Patients then entered a randomized double-blind study of atenolol and nifedipine; treadmill exercise testing and 48 h of ambulatory ST segment monitoring were performed at the end of each treatment phase. Six (60%) patients showed evidence of variability in coronary vasomotor tone four of whom developed significant ST segment changes during administration of ergonovine; a further two had greater than 30% variability in time to onset of ischaemia during serial treadmill exercise testing. Atenolol significantly increased the time to ischaemia on exercise testing, both in the group as a whole and in the subgroup with evidence of altered vasomotor tone when compared with no therapy, and led to a non-significant reduction in the frequency and duration of ischaemia during the patients' daily lives. Nifedipine, conversely, did not significantly increase time to ischaemia on exercise testing or reduce the frequency or duration of ambulatory ischaemia in either the whole group or the subgroup. With evidence of altered vasomotor tone when compared to no therapy however it was beneficial in terms of reduction in chest pain and requirement for glyceryl trinitrate during daily life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "The ocular accommodation response to a stationary near target exhibits microfluctuations which are characterized by two dominant components of activity: a low-frequency component (LFC: less than 0.5 Hz) and a high-frequency component (HFC: 1.0-2.2 Hz). We have shown recently that there is a significant correlation between the frequency of arterial pulse (AP) and the peak frequency of the HFC. If the mechanisms by which AP induces the HFC are intraocular they are likely to involve both rhythmic variations in choroidal blood flow and intraocular pressure (IOP) pulse: the former inducing changes in ciliary ring diameter from pulsatile blood volume changes in the ciliary body, the latter producing changes in effective lens power following small shifts in lens position or, with each drop in IOP, reduced resistance to inherent lens substance and capsule elasticity. In addition to its well-known ocular hypotensive effect, topical instillation of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist timolol maleate has been shown to reduce significantly the magnitude of the IOP pulse, an effect that has been attributed to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug on the choroidal vasculature. Using a modified Canon IR optometer we report on the effect of 0.5% timolol maleate on the accommodative microfluctuations for a group of 10 emmetropic subjects viewing a target monocularly at a distance of 25 cm. Following a double-blind protocol against a saline control, timolol was shown to reduce the rms for both LFCs and HFCs. An experiment to separate local from systemic effects involved four subjects whose treated and untreated eyes were examined to determine the effects of the consensual reduction in IOP: the results on microfluctuations in the untreated eyes were equivocal but the correlation between arterial pulse frequency and location of the peak frequency of HFC was maintained. The results show that factors relating to IOP and vasculature will affect the magnitude of accommodative microfluctuations.", 
    "69": "A calcium blocking agent, verapamil, and a beta 1-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, metoprolol, were administered alone or in combination to 4-day-old chick embryos (Hamburger-Hamilton developmental stage 24). Embryos co-administered with verapamil (0.05 nmol) and metoprolol (0.1 or 1.0 nmol), neither of which alone caused significant teratogenicity, showed cardiovascular malformations, including ventricular septal defects associated with or without dextroposition of the aorta (overriding aorta). The alterations of calcium movement into the myocyte and/or the haemodynamic change following impaired calcium transport are suggested to be possible causative factors.", 
    "70": "To evaluate differences in efficacy, safety, and quality of life, 394 male patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to receive 20 weeks of either atenolol or nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) in a multicenter double-blind trial. A four-week placebo washout was followed by 8 weeks of titration and 12 weeks of maintenance therapy. Quality-of-life evaluation included clinical assessments by the patient and parallel take-home assessments by patient and spouse. Blood pressure was controlled equally in both groups. The total incidence of adverse reactions was similar in both groups, but a greater percentage of nifedipine GITS patients withdrew due to peripheral edema. Patients completing 20 weeks of therapy demonstrated a more favorable quality-of-life profile (P less than .05) for nifedipine GITS over atenolol in psychosocial (P less than .01), well-being (P less than .05), general affect (P less than .05), emotional ties (P less than .01), emotional control (P less than .05), vitality (P less than .05), and leisure (P less than .05) scores. Treatment differences were particularly pronounced for patients over 50 years of age and were not fully detectable until after 14 weeks of therapy. Deterioration in quality of life was associated with withdrawal. Spouses of younger patients receiving atenolol reported deterioration in sexual satisfaction as compared to spouses of patients taking nifedipine GITS (P less than .02). Thus age, length of trial, and third-party observation are important factors in quality-of-life assessment. Comparison of adverse reactions provides an incomplete measure of how well a drug is tolerated. In contrast, findings indicate that even subtle CNS-mediated effects on mood and well-being can be detected by quality-of-life evaluation.", 
    "71": "Alveolar and lung liquid clearance were studied over 8 h in intact anesthetized ventilated rabbits by instillation of either isosmolar Ringer lactate (2 ml/kg) or autologous plasma (2 or 3 ml/kg) into one lower lobe. The half time for lung liquid clearance of the isosmolar Ringer lactate was 3.3 h and that for plasma clearance was 6 h. In the plasma experiments, the alveolar protein concentration after 1 h was 5.2 +/- 0.8 g/dl, which was significantly greater than the initial instilled protein concentration of 4.3 +/- 0.7 g/dl (P less than 0.05). Thus alveolar protein concentration increased by 21 +/- 12% over 1 h, which matched clearance from the entire lung of 19 +/- 11% of the instilled volume. Overall the rate of alveolar and lung liquid clearance in rabbits was significantly faster than in prior studies in dogs and sheep. The fast alveolar liquid clearance rate in rabbits was not due to higher endogenous catecholamine release, because intravenous and alveolar (5 x 10(-5) M) propranolol did not slow the clearance. Also, beta-adrenergic therapy with alveolar terbutaline (10(-5) or 10(-4) M) did not increase the alveolar or lung liquid clearance rates. Phloridzin (10(-3) M) did not slow alveolar liquid clearance. However, amiloride (10(-4) M) inhibited 75% of the basal alveolar liquid clearance in rabbits, thus providing evidence that alveolar liquid clearance in rabbits depends primarily on sodium-dependent transport. This rabbit study provides further evidence for important species differences in the basal rates of alveolar liquid and solute clearance as well as the response to beta-adrenergic agonists and ion transport inhibitors.", 
    "72": "1. Erythema induced by topically applied timolol, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker, was assessed in six male volunteers. Intensity of erythema developed on the inner surface of the left forearm where timolol free base was applied for 10 h was measured by a visual score, laser doppler flowmeter and reflectance spectrophotometry. Plasma timolol concentrations collected from the left and right arms were also measured. 2. The mean values for blood volume and blood flow per unit volume of tissue both of which were assessed by a laser doppler flowmeter, haemoglobin index measured by reflectance spectrophotometry, and magnitude of erythema graded by a visual score significantly increased after the application of an acrylic co-polymer adhesive patch containing 20% (w/v) timolol free base. 3. Plasma timolol concentrations collected from the left antecubital vein were 2.4 to 10.7 times greater than those from the right arm and had significant correlations (rs = 0.55 to 0.76) with the parameters indicating the extent of erythema developed where a patch containing timolol was applied. 4. The inter-individual variation of timolol was attributed to that of the diffusivity of timolol through skin rather than that of the skin reactivity to topically applied timolol because the plasma timolol concentrations drawn from the left arm in the subjects who did not develop erythema were very low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The effects of single doses of metoprolol 50 mg, metoprolol 100 mg and atenolol 100 mg on exercise tolerance were compared with placebo in a double-blind random cross-over study in 12 healthy subjects. Nine subjects were extensive metabolisers of debrisoquine, and three were poor metabolisers. 2. Three hours after dosing beta-adrenoceptor blocker treatments significantly reduced exercise heart rate, prolonged time to complete exercise, and increased subjective fatigue measured by visual analogue scale. 3. Scores for subjective fatigue did not correlate with reduction in exercise heart rate or prolongation of exercise time. Exercise time prolongation was weakly but not significantly correlated with exercise heart rate reduction. 4. When compared with placebo, prolongation of exercise time and increased fatigue with metoprolol were not significantly related to debrisoquine oxidation phenotype or to the debrisoquine/4-hydroxydebrisoquine (D/4OH-D) ratio. 5. When metoprolol responses were compared with those for atenolol, changes in exercise time and fatigue scores were significantly related to oxidation phenotype.

    "74": "Twenty-two patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) were treated with metoprolol and their clinical courses were compared with those of 26 patients untreated with beta-blocking agents (non beta group). Of the 22 patients treated with metoprolol, 19 (beta group) were treated for a long period, 3 patients left the study within its first 6 months. Using the NYHA classification, 4 patients of the beta group were evaluated as having clinically improved, while none was aggravated, excluding 2 cases of death which occurred during the follow up period. In the non-beta group, clinical improvement was found for 2 patients and aggravation in functional class for 10. The left ventricular diameter was significantly decreased and parameters of systolic function and exercise tolerance were significantly improved in patients of the beta group, while no such improvements occurred in patients of the non-beta group. Twenty-four-hour ECG monitoring demonstrated a significant reduction in incidences of ventricular extrasystole in the beta group but not in those of the non-beta group. Improvement of arrhythmias, evaluated using Lown's grading system, was also identified more frequently in the beta group than in the non-beta group. During the follow-up period, 2 patients of the beta group and 10 patients of the non-beta group died. The survival curve for patients of the beta group prepared using the Caplan Meier Method was better than that for patients of the non-beta group. Metoprolol was therefore found to be useful for treatment of DCM.", 
    "75": "1. The present study examined the effects of morphine on ectopic automaticity induced by local injury in the isolated right ventricle of the rat. 2. Morphine (10(-7)-5 x 10(-5) M) induced a significant increase of ventricular rate similar to that produced by noradrenaline. The excitatory effect of morphine was not modified by the presence of naloxone (5 x 10(-5) M). The maximal effect obtained with morphine in the presence of naloxone was 60 +/- 7%, similar to that obtained with morphine alone (67 +/- 15%). The EC50 values for morphine in the absence (0.89 x 10(-7) M) and presence of naloxone (0.87 x 10(-7) M) were also similar. Apparently this effect is not mediated by postsynaptic opioid receptors. 3. The ventricular automaticity induced in isolated right ventricle of the rat was significantly decreased by the highest concentrations of naloxone (5 x 10(-5) and 10(-7) M). 4. Morphine (10(-9)-5 x 10(-5) M) did not significantly change ventricular automaticity in the presence of propranolol (5 x 10(-8) M) or in reserpinized rats (5 mg kg-1 i.p. 24 h before the experiments). The maximal increases induced by morphine in the presence of propranolol or in reserpinized rats were 5 +/- 0.8% and 16 +/- 14.7% respectively. These results were significantly different from the maximal increase obtained without propranolol or with non-reserpinized animals. It is possible that the effects of morphine on ventricular automaticity could be mediated by an indirect effect located presynaptically at the adrenergic nerve terminals through the release of catecholamines.", 
    "76": "The authors describe a patient who experienced recurrent wide-complex and narrow-complex tachycardias during exercise. Electrophysiologic testing in the resting state revealed dual atrioventricular (AV) nodal pathways. AV nodal reentrant tachycardia was inducible by ventricular premature stimulation but was always nonsustained, terminating with block in the anterograde slow pathway. During isoproterenol infusion, runs of ventricular tachycardia occurred frequently, and spontaneously initiated sustained AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. Exercise testing also provoked ventricular tachycardia and sustained AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. The patient was effectively treated with a combination of atenolol and verapamil. This case is an unusual example of a catecholamine-induced arrhythmia, possibly due to triggered activity (exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia), initiating an arrhythmia due to reentry (AV nodal reentrant tachycardia).", 
    "77": "To study the systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of the new antihypertensive agent pinacidil, the authors administered intravenously two doses of pinacidil (0.1 mg/kg) to patients with hypertension after 3 days of randomized, double-blind pretreatment with either propranolol or placebo. Pinacidil administration decreased systemic arterial pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance in both groups of patients. It also decreased pulmonary artery wedge pressure, and increased cardiac output, heart rate, and plasma norepinephrine levels; the changes in cardiac output and heart rate were attenuated by propranolol pretreatment. In addition, propranolol-pretreated patients responded to pinacidil with a decrease in forearm blood flow. In contrast, pinacidil administration exerted no significant effects on right atrial pressure, stroke volume, or mean pulmonary arterial pressure alone or in combination with propranolol. The results show that pinacidil is a potent arterial dilator but has little effect on the venomotor tone in patients with hypertension.", 
    "78": "We conducted electrophysiologic (EP) studies and estimated the sinus node function and atrioventricular (AV) conduction in 10 patients with suspected coronary arterial disease (age range 35-55 years) before and during diltiazem therapy (60 mg thrice daily for 5-7 days). The effect of beta blockade (0.1 mg/kg of intravenous propranolol) was evaluated in both EP studies. The mean spontaneous sinus cycle length (SCL) and the AV nodal Wenckebach cycle lengths (AVWB) were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) after propranolol alone (913 +/- 131 and 504 +/- 197 ms, respectively) compared with baseline values (SCL: 827 +/- 149 ms, AVWB: 439 +/- 173 ms). Diltiazem alone failed to influence the SCL and AVWB significantly. Following the combination (diltiazem + propranolol), SCL (945 +/- 147 ms) and AVWB (533 +/- 148 ms) were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than baseline and post diltiazem values (SCL: 840 +/- 150 ms; AVWB 457 +/- 103 ms). None of the other parameters (sinoatrial conduction time, corrected sinus node recovery time, AH and HV intervals, AV nodal and atrial effective refractory periods) were significantly influenced by propranolol, diltiazem, or the combination. No patient developed AV block, sinus arrest/sinoatrial exit block, or symptomatic sinus bradycardia following beta blockade after diltiazem administration. Oral diltiazem therapy alone and after beta blockade does not appear to adversely influence the sinus node function and AV conduction in patients below the age of 55 years. The combination of diltiazem and beta blocker thus appears safe in selected patients with coronary arterial disease.", 
    "79": "We studied a possible relation between stroke and an enhanced susceptibility to rupture of the arterial internal elastic lamina by comparing stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats with spontaneously hypertensive rats, which have a very low incidence of stroke. We quantified interruptions in the internal elastic lamina in certain arteries and studied the effect of beta-aminopropionitrile, an inhibitor of cross-link formation in collagen and elastic fibers, on rupture of the internal elastic lamina and on mortality in these two substrains. To eliminate any influence of higher blood pressure in the stroke-prone rats on the parameters studied, we used antihypertensive treatment to obtain equivalent blood pressures in the two substrains. Results showed that stroke sensitivity was associated with an enhanced early spontaneous rupture of the internal elastic lamina in the caudal artery, an increased susceptibility to beta-aminopropionitrile-induced rupture of the internal elastic lamina, and earlier mortality, mainly from aortic rupture, under beta-aminopropionitrile treatment. These findings suggest that stroke-prone rats have an enhanced minor connective tissue defect that is expressed by rupture of the internal elastic lamina and may be related, at least in part, to their greater vascular fragility and increased susceptibility to stroke.", 
    "80": "The possible involvement of protein kinase C and Ca2+ metabolism in the proteolytic enzyme release from schistosome cercariae was studied. Cercariae were placed in dechlorinated tap water containing 0.37 mM calcium in the small glass petri dish and exposed to the stimuli (linoleic acid, phorbol esters, and Ca2+ ionophore) with or without inhibitors of protein kinase C or Ca2+ metabolism. The proteolytic activity of incubation medium of cercariae thus treated was measured by the azocoll assay. The penetration response of cercariae induced by linoleic acid, a physiological stimulus, was mimicked by phorbol esters. When exposed to phorbol esters, 0.02 to 2 microM of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and 0.2 to 2 microM of phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), cercariae ceased the swimming movement, began a rhythmic thrusting of the anterior tip of the parasite, and released the proteolytic enzyme, but they did not shed the tails. Lowering Ca2+ in water by addition of 5 mM ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), phorbol ester-induced release of enzyme was completely inhibited. Phorbol ester-induced release of enzyme was partially inhibited by 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), an inhibitor of protein kinase C, at a concentration of 100 microM. H-7 alone, at a concentration of 100 microM, did not affect the swimming movement of cercariae. The cercariae were stimulated to release the enzyme by high concentrations (10 and 100 microM) of the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, but enzyme was not released by low concentrations (0.5 and 1 microM) of this drug. Cercariae exposed to A23187 behaved differently from those exposed to phorbol esters. They ceased swimming, showed strong muscle contraction, and shed their tail. A23187 stimulated cercariae to release the enzyme in the water containing 5 mM EGTA. A23187-induced enzyme release was not inhibited by N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7), a calmodulin antagonist, trifluoperazine (TFP), a better calmodulin antagonist on schistosome, or by verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker. Linoleic acid-induced release of enzyme was partially inhibited by 0.5 and 5 mM of EGTA and by 1 to 100 microM of H-7. While it was not inhibited by N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-8) and N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA-1004), inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase which were used as negative controls of H-7, W-7, TFP, 8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8), an intracellular Ca2+ antagonist, and verapamil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "81": "The interaction between verapamil and beta-blockers may involve negative chronotropic, inotropic, and dromotropic effects. Three randomized, double-blind, crossover trials evaluated standardized submaximal exercise hemodynamics after oral verapamil (120 mg) and beta-blocker, alone and in combination, in groups of eight healthy men. The beta-blockers were propranolol (80 mg), metoprolol (100 mg), and pindolol (5 mg). During submaximal exercise, each beta-blocker produced similar reductions in heart rate. Likewise, each verapamil and beta-blocker combination caused greater decreases in heart rate and prolongation of PR interval than did either drug alone. Only the verapamil and propranolol combination produced greater reduction of systolic blood pressure and prolongation of rate-adjusted PR interval. All verapamil and beta-blocker combinations caused frequent adverse events, predominantly exercise fatigue and resting first-degree heart block. Although the verapamil and metoprolol or pindolol combinations produced lesser negative dromotropic or inotropic effects compared with verapamil and propranolol, coadministration of verapamil and any beta-blocker should be performed cautiously.", 
    "82": "Severe hypertension developed in a fifty-five year-old woman after surgical removal of a retroperitoneal tumor, when the renal artery was injured. Renal arteriography after the surgery demonstrated a segmental infarction of the right kidney. A close relationship between activation of the renin-angiotensin system and the development of severe hypertension was observed. Satisfactory control of blood pressure concomitant with reduction of plasma renin activity was achieved by a combination of an angiotensin-converting anzyme inhibitor, beta-blocking agent, and calcium-entry blocker. The mechanism of activation of the renin-angiotensin system in renal infarction is discussed.", 
    "83": "The present study in hypertensive men (40-64 years old) with untreated diastolic blood pressure above 100 mm Hg was aimed at investigating whether metoprolol (n = 1,609) given as initial treatment would lower the risk for coronary events (sudden death and myocardial infarction) more effectively than thiazide diuretics (n = 1,625). A substantial part of this study was the metoprolol arm of the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension (HAPPHY) study. The HAPPHY study was a pooling of the effect of different beta-blockers, mainly metoprolol and atenolol, in which no favorable effect in relative risk was observed for atenolol as compared with diuretics. In the present study, 255 patients suffered definite coronary events during follow-up; 25% of these events were fatal, 39% were acute myocardial infarctions, and 36% were silent myocardial infarctions. The risk for coronary events was significantly lower in patients on metoprolol than in patients on diuretics (111 versus 144 cases, p = 0.001, corresponding to 14.3 versus 18.8 cases/1,000 patient years and a relative risk of 0.76 at the end of the trial; 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.98). This difference in risk has potentially important implications for clinical practice because of the large number of hypertensive patients who are at increased risk for coronary events. Because a placebo group, for ethical reasons, could not be included, relative risk can only be expressed in relation to diuretics. There was no difference between the two treatment groups in baseline characteristics, blood pressure during follow-up, or stroke rates. Thus, the difference in risk for coronary events is probably mediated via mechanisms other than blood pressure control. However, present data might suggest that different beta-blockers may have different efficacy in preventing coronary events. The reasons for this possibility are as yet unknown.", 
    "84": "The cardiac baroreflex was studied in humans by means of vasoactive drugs and in conscious rabbits by the drug and perivascular cuff methods, which provide somewhat different afferent drive. Mean arterial pressure (MAP)-heart rate (HR) curves were derived using 1) a single symmetric logistic function and 2) a compound function, where the two halves of separate logistic functions were centered on the resting value, one for the tachycardia response and the other for the bradycardia response. There were some differences in overall reflex parameters (plateaus, HR range, gain) between the two methods because of minor degrees of asymmetry. But the differences were small, and the single symmetric logistic adequately describes the overall properties. With the compound function, we assessed average gain, Gt and Gb, for the tachycardia and bradycardia responses and the corresponding normalized (range-independent) gains, Ct and Cb. The resting HR has a large effect on Gt/Gb, since it determines the HR range of each logistic. Moreover, Gt/Gb depends on both resting autonomic tone and reflex changes. However, Ct and Cb provide information about \"intrinsic\" differences in sensitivity; they are independent of resting HR but entirely dependent on reflex autonomic changes. In rabbits Ct and Cb tended to be larger with the cuff than with the drug method; in addition, with the former Ct less than Cb, whereas with the drug method Ct greater than or equal to Cb, which was consistent with differences in afferent drive. There were also differences between humans and rabbits in Ct/Cb of the vagal component of the reflex. The assessment of the normalized gains of the compound logistic function has substantial advantages over previous methods for assessing gain of the tachycardia and bradycardia responses.", 
    "85": "Effect of centrally administered endothelins (ETs) on cardiovascular regulation was investigated in conscious normotensive rats. ET-1, ET-2, or ET-3 was injected through a cannula into the cisterna magna, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured through a cannula in the femoral artery. Baroreceptor HR reflex was measured by monitoring the changes in HR in response to changes in MAP induced by slow intravenous injection of phenylephrine or nitroprusside. MAP and HR responses were then analyzed in individual animals by sigmoidal curve fitting. Intracisternal (ic) administration of ET-1 did not change resting MAP or HR at doses of 2.5 or 25 pmol/kg. The higher dose of ET-1 induced a significant increase of baroreflex sensitivity without a change of HR range. Sympathetic and vagal components of the baroreflex were examined by testing reflex responses after pretreatment with methylatropine (0.5 mg/kg iv) and atenolol (1.0 mg/kg iv), respectively. An increased baroreflex sensitivity was observed after ET-1 treatment in the atenolol-treated rats but not in the methylatropine-treated rats, suggesting that the peptide selectively affected the vagal component of the reflex. Intravenous 25 pmol/kg ET-1 did not cause an increase in baroreflex sensitivity. Neither ET-2 nor ET-3 (25 pmol/kg ic) induced changes in resting MAP or HR, but both significantly increased baroreflex sensitivity without changes in HR range. Order of potency of the ETs on baroreflex gain was ET-3 greater than or equal to ET-1 greater than ET-2. In conclusion, ETs at doses that do not change resting values for MAP or HR, may induce significant centrally mediated sensitization of the baroreceptor HR reflex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "86": "To assess the effects of intravenous aminophylline on the sinus node, 12 patients with clinical and Holter monitor-documented sick sinus syndrome were studied (1) during the control state, (2) after pharmacologic autonomic blockade and (3) 5 min after intravenous administration of aminophylline. The effects of aminophylline on sinus node function were compared with those after pharmacologic autonomic blockade. No significant improvement of sinus node function was found after intravenous aminophylline administration with a mean sinus cycle length and a mean maximum CSRT of 968 +/- 218 and 1832 +/- 1036 ms, respectively. The mean serum theophylline level was 10.9 +/- 1.7 micrograms/ml. Since aminophylline is an adenosine receptor antagonist, these findings suggest that intrinsic adenosine may not play an important role in pathogenesis in patients with chronic and advanced sick sinus syndrome.", 
    "87": "Three recent additions to the list of antihypertensive agents have been approved for use as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs. Betaxolol hydrochloride (Kerlone) maintains its effect for 24 hours, making it a true once-a-day beta blocker. Penbutolol sulfate (Levatol) is as effective as other beta blockers and diuretics. Doxazosin mesylate (Cardura), a selective alpha 1 blocker, also allows once-a-day dosing and has produced favorable changes in lipid profiles. Two new drug delivery systems, one for verapamil hydrochloride (Verelan) and one for extended-release nifedipine (Procardia XL), allow less frequent dosing and may offer other advantages, such as greater compliance and a more tolerable side-effect profile.", 
    "88": "The effects of atenolol (100 mg/day) and nifedipine (20 mg 3 times daily) and their combination on ambulant myocardial ischemia were investigated using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Eighteen men with symptomatic coronary artery disease, exercise-induced ischemia and minimal symptoms, underwent 4 blinded treatment periods of 2 weeks' duration (2 placebo, 1 atenolol, 1 nifedipine). Those that did not have ischemia eliminated by monotherapy received combination therapy with both drugs. Forty-eight-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was used to quantitate ischemic parameters at the end of each period. Both nifedipine and atenolol as monotherapy reduced the number of ischemic episodes and the average duration of each episode compared with placebo (p less than 0.05). Compared with placebo, nifedipine reduced the total duration of ischemia (p less than 0.05) but the effect of atenolol on ischemia duration was of borderline significance (p = 0.066). There were no differences in reduction of ischemic parameters when atenolol was compared with nifedipine (difference not significant). In the 9 patients who continued to have ischemia with monotherapy, combination therapy eliminated it in 2 and reduced the duration by greater than 50% in the remaining patients compared with placebo. In conclusion, monotherapy with nifedipine or atenolol is similarly effective in eliminating or reducing ambulant ischemia. Combination therapy can provide additional benefit in those with continued ischemia.", 
    "89": "Dose-response evaluation of oral labetalol (100, 200, or 300 mg) on heart rate and systemic blood pressure in emergency department patients with hypertensive urgency (diastolic blood pressure, 110 to 140 mm Hg, and no end-organ evidence of hypertensive emergency).", 
    "90": "This acute-treatment, dose-ranging study used a randomized, double-blind, parallel design. Patients with supine diastolic blood pressure of 110 to 140 mm Hg after 30 minutes of bedrest received an oral dose of labetalol. Supine blood pressure and heart rate were measured manually and recorded hourly for four hours after dose. Diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less or a 30-mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure was considered a treatment success.", 
    "91": "Two hundred fifty-five patients were evaluated for inclusion, and 36 patients (19 women and 17 men; mean age, 44 years; age range, 23 to 67 years) were studied. The most frequent reason for exclusion was a spontaneous decrease in diastolic blood pressure to less than 110 mm Hg (31%) with bedrest. There were 12 patients in each treatment group. Compared with baseline, the 100-mg dose significantly (P less than .05) reduced heart rate at three and four hours after dose, and the 300-mg dose significantly (P less than .05) reduced heart rate at one, two, and three hours after dose; the 200-mg dose did not significantly affect heart rate. All doses produced a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures at one, two, three, and four hours after dose compared with baseline. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups with regard to systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate at baseline or one, two, three, or four hours after dose. At two hours after dose, diastolic blood pressure control was observed in 75%, 58%, and 67% of patients receiving 100, 200, and 300 mg, respectively (P = .903). At four hours after dose, diastolic blood pressure control was observed in 50%, 64%, and 67% of patients receiving 100, 200, and 300 mg, respectively (P = .755). A comparison of treatment success rates between the two time periods showed a waning of response with the 100-mg dose of labetalol at hour 4 compared with hour 2 (P less than .05). No adverse effects were observed.",

    "93": "The effects of drugs on ischemia and reperfusion-induced arrhythmias were studied in vivo in anesthetized rats. The chest was opened under artificial respiration and the heart was exposed. The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded, followed by reperfusion for 10 min each. The drugs (mannitol 10-50 mg/kg, aspirin 0.25-5 mg/kg, verapamil 5-50 micrograms/kg and propranolol 1 mg/kg iv) were tested in the vagotomized animals. The test agent was dissolved in saline and 0.5 ml infused 15 min before the coronary occlusion. The results indicated that mannitol and aspirin reduced the incidence and duration of arrhythmias (ventricular premature contraction, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation) during ischemia and reperfusion, while verapamil and propranolol reduced the incidence of arrhythmias during ischemia."
