In skeletal muscle (LM), [3H]CGP12177 labeled a homogeneous population of beta2-AR as evidenced by the rank order of affinity of catecholamines [(-)isoproterenol > (-)epinephrine > (-)norepinephrine], a high affinity of the binding site for the beta2-AR-agonist clenbuterol (equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd = 16 nM), and a low affinity of the binding site for the beta1-AR-antagonist CGP20712A (Kd = 21 microM). The affinity of ICI118551, a ligand selective for beta2-AR in other species, was uncharacteristically low in porcine LM (Kd = 441 nM), but was consistent with a value reported for the cloned porcine beta2-AR. In heart ventricle, ligand binding revealed a predominant population of beta1-AR, judged by the rank order of affinity of catecholamines [(-)isoproterenol > (-)epinephrine > or = (-)norepinephrine] and high-affinity binding to CGP20712A (Kd = 40 nM). The Kd for ICI118551 (731 nM) was close to that observed at beta2-AR in LM, confirming that ICI118551 is not subtype-selective in the pig. Displacement studies using (-)propranolol, clenbuterol, and (-)isoproterenol revealed a second high-affinity binding site in the heart that was not a beta2-AR and could not be eliminated by guanosine 5'-triphosphate or guanylyli-midodiphosphate. In adipose tissue, an equal number of beta1- and beta2-AR was identified through the binding of clenbuterol and CGP20712A, whereas ICI118551 could not discriminate between these sites. In further experiments, we used 10 microM CGP20712A to eliminate beta1-AR binding and allow accurate Kd values to be determined at beta2-AR for nonselective ligands. Under these conditions, another binding site was observed that had a high affinity for (-)propranolol (Kd = 20 pM), which is inconsistent with beta3- or beta4-AR binding reported elsewhere. Our results indicate that porcine adipose tissue contains beta1-AR, beta2-AR, and an atypical binding site in the proportions 50, 34, and 16%, respectively, of the total binding sites labeled by [3H]CGP12177.",

Patients with chronotropic incompetence by either method had a lower pVo2 than those without. These differences remained significant for both patients taking and not taking a beta blocker. %HRR, Max-PPHR%, and HRR were related to New York Heart Association class and correlated with pVo2. There was no difference in the slopes relating heart rate to pVo2 between patients with and those without chronotropic incompetence (6.1 (1.7) v 5.1 (1.8), p = 0.34).

Poly I also induced an increase in activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcriptional activity, possibly due to the activation of the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK, Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. Dextran sulphate (DS) efficiently inhibited the activation induced by poly I including the production of the inflammatory mediators.

Thiazide diuretic and beta-blockers are potentially diabetogenic, whereas calcium channel blockers appear neutral. Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system are associated with improvements in glycemic control and may lower diabetes incidence, but it is not clear if this represents a truly preventive effect. Also, it should be noted that previous studies have reported inconsistent results, and the data to date are not definitive. We suggest that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system be used as first-line agents in uncomplicated hypertensive patients who are at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Thiazides and beta-blockers should not be avoided in patients with compelling indications for these drugs. Many hypertensive patients (particularly those who are obese or have prediabetes) require several agents to achieve target blood pressure levels. Therefore, the choice of initial agent is far less important than ensuring that target blood pressure goals are reached.", 
    "23": "The protective effects of carvedilol, an antihypertensive agent, against oxidative injury caused by acetaminophen were studied in rat liver. Male Wistar rats (250 +/- 30 g) were pre-treated with carvedilol (3.6 mg/kg, p.o.) for 10 days and on the 11th day received an overdose of acetaminophen (800 mg/kg, p.o.). Four hours after acetaminophen administration, blood was collected to determine serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). After that, rats were killed and the livers were excised to determine reduced glutathione (GSH), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and carbonyl protein contents, and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione S-transferase (GST), and also the DNA damage index. Acetaminophen significantly increased the levels of TBARS, the DNA damage and SOD, AST and ALT activities. Carvedilol was able to prevent lipid peroxidation, protein carbonilation and DNA fragmentation caused by acetaminophen. Moreover, this drug prevented increases in SOD, AST and ALT activities. These results show that carvedilol exerts cytoprotective effects against oxidative injury caused by acetaminophen in rat liver. These effects are probably related to the O2*- scavenging property of carvedilol or its metabolites.",

    "29": "Although sarcolemmal (SL) Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is known to regulate the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), its involvement in catecholamine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i is not fully understood. To gain some information in this regard, isolated rat cardiomyocytes were treated with different agents, which are known to modify Ca2+ movements, in the absence or presence of a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, and [Ca2+]i in cardiomyocytes was determined spectrofluorometrically with fura-2 AM. Treatment with isoproterenol did not alter [Ca2+]i in quiescent cardiomyocytes, whereas the ATP (purinergic receptor agonist)-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was significantly potentiated by isoproterenol. Unlike ryanodine and cyclopiazonic acid, which affect the sarcoplasmic reticulum function, SL L-type Ca2+ channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem, as well as a SL Ca2+-pump inhibitor, vanadate, caused a significant depression in the isoproterenol-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. The SL Na+/Ca2+ exchange blockers amiloride, Ni2+, and KB-R7943 also attenuated the isoproterenol-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i. Combination of KB-R7943 and verapamil showed additive inhibitory effects on the isoproterenol-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. The isoproterenol-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in KCl-depolarized cardiomyocytes was augmented by low Na+; this augmentation was significantly depressed by treatment with KB-R7943. The positive inotropic action of isoproterenol in isolated hearts was also reduced by KB-R7943. These data suggest that in addition to SL L-type Ca2+ channels, SL Na+/Ca2+ exchanger seems to play an important role in catecholamine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in cardiomyocytes.",

Both 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone decreased ANG II-induced DNA synthesis. Rosiglitazone treatment increased nuclear PPAR-gamma expression and activity in VSMC. However, rosiglitazone did not alter expression of PPAR-alpha/beta, ERK 1/2, Akt, or ANG II receptors. 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone decreased ERK 1/2 and Akt peak activity, both of which were induced by ANG II via the AT1 receptor. Rosiglitazone inhibited ANG II-enhanced phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), as well as Src homology (SH) 2-containing inositol phosphatase 2 (SHIP2). PPAR-gamma activation reduced ANG II-induced growth associated with inhibition of ERK 1/2, Akt, 4E-BP1, and SHIP2. Modulation of these pathways by PPAR-gamma activators may contribute to regression of vascular remodeling in hypertension.",

Compounds were prepared in an attempt to explore the ability of the benzisothiazole ring to interact with the beta-adrenoceptor site and to establish whether oxypropanolaminic derivatives recognise the beta3-adrenoceptor subtype. All the products were tested on rat atria, bladder and small intestine, which preferentially (but not exclusively) express beta1-, beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptors, respectively. When compared with the reference, non-specific, beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline, the products tested did not show any consistent beta-adrenoceptor agonistic activity in the different models. Most compounds relaxed smooth muscle preparations, but such effect was resistant to the blockade by propranolol (1 micromol/l), ICI 118,551 (1 micromol/l) or bupranolol (1-10 micromol/l), thus excluding that the spasmolytic effect involves any beta-adrenoceptors. When tested as antagonists, some of these products showed a concentration-dependent attenuation of the isoprenaline-induced effects in rat atria, without affecting beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation in smooth muscle. These data confirm the ability of the benzisothiazole ring to interact with beta-adrenoceptors, but the substitution in 5- or 7-positions with oxypropanolaminic groups does not generate compounds endowed with specific activity at beta3-adrenoceptors. Conversely, most of these compounds behave as (specific) antagonists at beta1- (cardiac) adrenoceptors. At the maximum concentrations tested (1-100 micromol/l), these compounds also exert direct spasmolytic and negative chronotropic effects, which could be related to a blockade of Ca2+-dependent mechanisms at an intracellular level and/or an anaesthetic-like activity at plasma membranes.",

Despite a similar mean heart rate (69 beats/min), patients with the Ser49 genotype tended to have higher doses of beta-blockade compared with Gly49 carriers (P = .065). In patients receiving a low dose of beta-blockade (< or = 50% of targeted full dose), the 5-year mortality rate was lower among Gly49 carriers than Ser49 patients (risk ratio [RR], 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07-0.80; P = .020). In patients receiving high doses of beta-blockers, there was no significant difference in outcome between genotypes (P = .20), which was attributable to a better outcome for Ser49 patients treated with a high dose of beta-blockade as compared with a low dose. Gly49 carriers had a similar survival rate with different doses of beta-blockers. With low-dose beta-blockers, both codon 49 (RR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.89; P = .029) and codon 389 (RR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.04-5.63, P = .039) were related to 5-year mortality rate.",

In order to identify the positive inotropic, positive lusitropic and vasodilator effects of both agonists also in vivo, we have determined their effects on the left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), the rate of intraventricular pressure rise (+dP dt(-1)(max)) and decline (-dP dt(-1)(max)), the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the mesenteric blood flow (MBF) in pithed and vagotomized rats. 2 CGP 12177 (0.1-100 nmol kg(-1)) and cyanopindolol (1-1000 nmol kg(-1)) dose-dependently enhanced all cardiac parameters. The nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bupranolol 10 micromol kg(-1) diminished the CGP 12177 (100 nmol kg(-1))-stimulated increases in LVSP from 26.3+/-8.2 to 13.1+/-1.8 mmHg (P<0.05), +dP dt(-1)(max) from 5287+/-290 to 2439+/-296 mmHg s(-1) (P<0.001) and -dP dt(-1)(max) from -3836+/-301 to -2187+/-443 mmHg s(-1) (P<0.05), respectively. The beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A 10 micromol kg(-1) (known to block the low-affinity state of beta(1)-adrenoceptors at high doses) inhibited increases in +/-dP dt(-1)(max) elicited by the highest dose of CGP 12177. 3 The highest doses of CGP 12177 and cyanopindolol increased DBP by about 10 mmHg and MBF by 1.4+/-0.3 and 0.6+/-0.3 ml min(-1), respectively. The vascular effects of CGP 12177 were not affected by bupranolol and CGP 20712A. 4 In conclusion, activation of the low-affinity state of beta(1)-adrenoceptors by CGP 12177 and cyanopindolol in pithed rats causes a positive inotropic and lusitropic effect. By contrast, the vascular effects of CGP 12177 and cyanopindolol are not mediated by these receptors and have only marginal influence under in vivo conditions.",

Formulations were prepared based on rotatable central composite design with peripheral polymer ratio (carbopol 934P: HPMC 4KM) and core polymer ratio (HPMC 4KM: sodium alginate) as two independent formulation variables. The three layered buccal compact comprises a peripheral layer, core layer and backing layer. Four dependent (response) variables were considered: bioadhesion force, percentage MT release at 8 h, T50% (time taken to release 50% of drug) and release exponent (n). The release profile data was subjected to curve fitting analysis for describing the release mechanism of MT from three layered buccal compact. The main effects and interaction terms was quantitatively evaluated by quadratic model. The decrease in MT release was observed with an increase in both the formulation variables and as the carbopol: HPMC ratio increases the bioadhesive strength also increases. The desirability function was used to optimize the response variables, each having a different target and the observed responses were highly agreed with experimental values. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the model in the development of three layered buccal compact containing highly water-soluble drug MT.", 
    "47": "Extracts from the plant Lycopus europaeus L. are traditionally used in mild forms of hyperthyroidism. High doses caused a reduction of TSH or thyroid hormone levels in animal experiments, whereas in hyperthyroid patients treated with low doses of Lycopus an improvement of cardiac symptoms was reported without major changes in TSH or thyroid hormone concentrations. Lycopus extract was tested in thyroxine treated hyperthyroid rats (0.7 mg/kg BW i.p.). Co-treatment with an hydroethanolic extract from L. europaeus L. started one week later than T4-application and lasted 5.5 weeks. As reference substance atenolol was used. The raised body temperature was reduced very effectively even by the low dose of the plant extract, whereas the reduced gain of body weight and the increased food intake remained unaffected by any treatment. No significant changes of thyroid hormone concentrations or TSH levels were observed. Lycopus extract and atenolol reduced the increased heart rate and blood pressure. The cardiac hypertrophy was alleviated significantly by both treatment regimes. beta-Adrenoceptor density in heart tissue was significantly reduced by the Lycopus extract or the beta-blocking agent showing an almost equal efficacy. Although the mode of action remains unclear, these organo-specific anti-T4-effects seem to be of practical interest, for example in patients with latent hyperthyroidism.", 
    "48": "Propranolol is a noncardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist that has been recently reported to prolong the QTc interval on the surface electrocardiogram in humans when overdosed [Farhangi, V., Sansone, R.A. (2003). QTc prolongation due to propranolol overdose. Int. J. Psychiatry Med. 33, 201-202.]. To examine the underlying mechanisms for these clinical findings, we studied the effects of propranolol on the human cardiac potassium channels encoded by the ether-a-go-go-related gene (ERG) using the whole cell voltage-clamp technique. We found that propranolol blocked hERG currents in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 9.9+/-1.3 microM which is relevant to the predicted plasma level of propranolol in this case report. The present study demonstrated that propranolol can inhibit hERG channels. The interaction between propranolol and hERG channels could lead to delayed cardiac repolarization and might be a molecular mechanism for the previously reported QTc prolongation when propranolol is overdosed.", 
    "49": "The present study was performed to examine neuroprotective effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(3) receptor antagonists against beta-amyloid protein (25--35)-, a synthetic 25--35 amyloid peptide, induced neurotoxicity using cultured rat cortical neurons. beta-Amyloid protein (25--35) produced a concentration-dependent reduction of cell viability, which was significantly reduced by (5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK-801), an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, verapamil, an L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. The 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, tropanyl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate (MDL-72222, 0.1--10 microM) and N-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2.]oct-3-yl)-6-chloro-4-ethyl-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzoxazine-8-carboxamide hydrochloride (Y 25130, 0.05--5 microM), decreased the beta-amyloid protein (25--35) (10 microM)-induced neuronal cell death as assessed by a colorimetric 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the number of apoptotic nuclei, evidenced by Hoechst 33342 staining. MDL 72222 and Y 25130 inhibited the beta-amyloid protein (25--35) (10 microM)-induced elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)) and glutamate release, generation of reactive oxygen species, and caspase-3 activity. These neuroprotective effects of MDL 72222 (10 microM) and Y 25130 (5 microM) were completely blocked by the simultaneous treatment with 100 microM 1-phenylbiguanide, a 5-HT(3) receptor agonist, indicating that the protective effects of these compounds were due to 5-HT(3) receptor blockade. These results suggest that the activation of the 5-HT(3) receptor may be partially involved in beta-amyloid protein-induced neurotoxicity, by membrane depolarization for Ca(2+) influx. Therefore, the blockade of 5-HT(3) receptor with MDL 72222 and Y 25130, may ameliorate the beta-amyloid protein-induced neurotoxicity by interfering with the increase of [Ca(2+)](c), and then by inhibiting glutamate release, generation of reactive oxygen species and caspase-3 activity.",

    "54": "Cigarette smoking is implicated in the formation of occlusive vascular diseases. Nicotine's role in this process is incompletely understood. Nicotine's effect on human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HaVSMC) and the role of the nicotinic receptor (nAChR), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and the PDGF-receptor (PDGF-R) in this response were studied. Nicotine's mitogenic effect was characterized by three methods: thymidine incorporation, a viability/proliferation assay based on metabolic conversion of tetrazolium salt to formazan dye and cell counting. Nicotine administration (10(-6) M) stimulated cell cycle entry marked by increased DNA synthesis, PCNA and cyclin D1 production, and increased cell division. Nicotinic receptor blockade with d-tubocurarine, a nicotinic AchR blocker, decreased nicotine-induced DNA synthesis, and cell division (0.33 +/- 0.04, 0.77 +/- 0.31-fold decrease, respectively). Nicotine increased cellular PDGF-BB transcript levels and protein release (ELISA: 1.6 +/- 0.5-fold increase) but not PDGF-AA or PDGF-AB release. Nicotine increased PDGFbeta-receptor protein content. PDGF inactivation with anti-PDGF antibody abolished nicotine-induced DNA synthesis (1.9 +/- 0.08-fold decrease). PDGF-R blockade with the PDGF-R antagonist tyrphostin AG 1295 decreased nicotine-induced DNA synthesis and cell division (0.25 +/- 0.01, 0.44 +/- 0.2-fold decrease, respectively). PDGF-R blockade reversed nicotine-stimulated increases in PDGF release, PDGF-BB transcripts, and PDGF-receptor levels (0.68 +/- 0.34; 0.46 +/- 0.01; 0.28 +/- 0.01-fold decrease, respectively). In conclusion, nicotine-mediated activation of nAChRs increases PDGF-BB transcription and protein production as well as PDGF beta-receptor levels. PDGF-BB/PDGF-R interaction is vital in nicotine's mitogenic actions on human aortic smooth muscle cells.",

    "71": "Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are three drugs with acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-inhibiting activity that are currently being used to treat patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. We have studied the neuroprotective effects of these drugs, in comparison with nicotine, on cell death caused by beta-amyloid (Abeta) and okadaic acid, two models that are relevant to Alzheimer's pathology, in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Galantamine and donepezil showed a U-shaped neuroprotective curve against okadaic acid toxicity; maximum protection was achieved at 0.3 microM galantamine and at 1 microM donepezil; at higher concentrations, protection was diminished. Rivastigmine showed a concentration-dependent effect; maximum protection was achieved at 3 microM. When apoptosis was induced by Abeta25-35, galantamine, donepezil, and rivastigmine showed maximum protection at the same concentrations: 0.3, 1, and 3 microM, respectively. Nicotine also afforded protection against Abeta- and okadaic acid-induced toxicity. The neuroprotective effects of galantamine, donepezil, and nicotine were reversed by the alpha7 nicotinic antagonist methyllycaconitine but not by the alpha4beta2 nicotinic antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt blocker 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride (LY294002) reversed the protective effects of galantamine, donepezil, and nicotine but not that of rivastigmine. In contrast, the bcl-2 antagonist ethyl[2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)]-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate (HA 14-1) reversed the protective effects of the three AChE inhibitors and that of nicotine. Our results show that galantamine, donepezil, and rivastigmine afford neuroprotection through a mechanism that is likely unrelated to AChE inhibition. Such neuroprotection seemed to be linked to alpha7 nicotinic receptors and the PI3K-Akt pathway in the case of galantamine and donepezil but not for rivastigmine.", 
    "72": "Alternative splicing of mouse beta3-adrenoceptor transcripts produces an additional receptor isoform (beta3b-adrenoceptor) with a C terminus comprising 17 amino acids distinct from the 13 in the known receptor (beta3a-adrenoceptor). We have shown that the beta3b-adrenoceptor couples to both Gs and Gi, whereas the beta3a-adrenoceptor couples only to Gs. To define the regions involved in this differential G protein coupling, we have compared wild-type, truncated, and mutant beta3-adrenoceptors. In Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing beta3-adrenoceptors truncated at the splicing point, cAMP accumulation with CL316243 [(R,R)-5-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-amino]-propyl]1,3-benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate] increased by 59% following pretreatment with pertussis toxin, suggesting that the C-terminal region of the beta3a-adrenoceptor inhibits coupling to Gi. We next utilized the cell-penetrating peptide Transportan 10 (Tp10) to introduce peptides comprising the different C-terminal tail fragments into cells expressing beta3a-adrenoceptor, beta3b-adrenoceptor, and the truncated beta3-adrenoceptor. Treatment with beta3a-Tp10 (1 microM) caused cAMP responses to CL316243 in the beta3a-adrenoceptor to become pertussis toxin-sensitive and display a 30% increase over control, whereas the other peptides did not affect any receptor. Mutation at a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site (Tyr392Ala beta3a-adrenoceptor) did not alter responses or pertussis toxin sensitivity relative to the parent receptor. Surprisingly, a Ser388Ala/Ser389Ala mutant beta3b-adrenoceptor became unresponsive to CL316243 while retaining an extracellular acidification rate response to SR59230A [3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-[(1,S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronapth-1-ylamino]-2S-2-propanol oxalate]. Our findings suggest that the beta3a-adrenoceptor cannot couple to Gi because of conformational changes induced by a protein(s) that interacts with residues in the C-terminal tail or because this protein(s) affects the intracellular localization of the beta3a-adrenoceptor.",

Urocortin facilitated the acquisition, consolidation and also retrieval of the passive avoidance response. The following receptor antagonists blocked the action of urocortin on consolidation: haloperidol, atropine, phenoxybenzamine, bicuculline, the CRF antagonist CRF9-41 and methysergide. Propranolol attenuated, but did not fully block the action of urocortin, while naloxone and nitro-L-arginine were ineffective.

We have examined the effects of T4 spinal transection on isometric contractions of mesenteric arteries isolated from spinalized rats. Nerve-evoked contractions involved synergistic roles for norepinephrine and ATP. At 7 wk after spinal transection, responses to perivascular stimulation at 1-5 Hz were enhanced fivefold, whereas the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (10 nM) produced a twofold larger reduction in contraction (to 20 pulses at 10 Hz) than in unoperated controls. In contrast, the reduction in nerve-evoked contractions by the P2-purinoceptor antagonist suramin (0.1 mM) and the responses to the P2-purinoceptor agonist alpha,beta-methylene ATP or to high K+ concentration did not greatly differ between groups, indicating that arteries from spinalized rats were not generally hyperreactive. Sensitivity to the alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine was enhanced in arteries from spinalized rats, and the difference from controls was abolished by the norepinephrine uptake blocker desmethylimipramine. Sensitivity to the alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine, which is not a substrate for the neuronal norepinephrine transporter, was similar among the groups. Thus the increased neurally evoked response after spinal transection appeared to be due to a reduction in neuronal uptake of released norepinephrine, a mechanism that did not explain the enhanced response of tail arteries after spinal transection that we previously reported. The findings provide further support for potentiated neurovascular responses contributing to the genesis of autonomic dysreflexia.", 
    "92": "Spectral analysis of cardiovascular signals has been extensively used to investigate circulatory homeostatic mechanisms. However, the nature of very low-frequency (VLF) fluctuations remains unclear. Because we previously observed enhanced VLF fluctuations in blood pressure (BP) in the sympathectomized rat (a model characterized by markedly increased plasma epinephrine levels), the aims of our study were to assess whether the genesis of VLF fluctuations in BP depends on circulating catecholamines and to determine which adrenergic receptor(s) and which membrane ion channel(s) are involved. We used continuous intra-arterial BP recordings from unanesthetized unrestrained rats to compute the power of VLF fluctuations in BP in the intact condition, during acute ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium, and after restoration of BP levels by infusion (in addition to hexamethonium) of adrenergic agonists (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and clonidine) or nonadrenergic vasoconstrictors (vasopressin). Effects of infusion of specific adrenergic receptor blockers (propranolol, prazosin, and yohimbine) with hexamethonium and catecholamines and infusion of various membrane ion channel blockers on VLF fluctuations in BP were also evaluated. Our results are as follows. 1) Ganglionic blockade drastically reduced BP levels and VLF fluctuations. 2) All vasoconstrictors restored BP levels, but only adrenergic vasoconstrictors generated striking VLF fluctuations in BP. 3) Catecholamine-induced fluctuations were abolished by alpha2-, but not alpha1- or beta-, adrenergic receptor blockade and by Ba2+-sensitive K+ channel or L-type Ca2+ channel, but not by other ion channel, blockers. We conclude that, in the conscious, unrestrained ganglion-blocked rat, catecholamine infusion generates VLF fluctuations in BP through stimulation of alpha2-receptors and activation of Ba2+-sensitive K+ channels. These fluctuations may have (patho)physiological relevance under conditions of disrupted circulatory homeostasis.", 
    "93": "Levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer, was used in combination with beta-adrenergic antagonists in a man aged 56 yr with cardiogenic shock, complicating acute myocardial infarction, who developed severe tachycardia after dobutamine administration. The patient's trachea was intubated, his lungs were ventilated, and he was started on dopamine 5 microg kg(-1) min(-1) and dobutamine 5 microg kg(-1) min(-1), titrated to a mean arterial pressure > or =65 mm Hg. He progressively became tachycardiac (>120 beats min(-1)) with a cardiac index (CI) of 1.4 litre min(-1) m(-2) despite adequate preload. Levosimendan 6 microg kg(-1) was administered intravenously over 10 min followed by a continuous infusion of 0.2 microg kg(-1) min(-1) for 24 h. Within 30 min, the patient's CI increased to 2.2 litre min(-1) m(-2), but the heart rate (HR) also increased from 142 to 155 beats min(-1). Esmolol 1 mg kg(-1) i.v. was administered with a consequent transient decrease in HR to 110 beats min(-1) without adverse haemodynamic effects; however, HR increased again shortly afterwards. Carvedilol 3.125 mg orally twice a day was then administered, and the dose was increased to 6.25 mg orally twice daily on the following day. Subsequently, HR decreased over time and both catecholamines were discontinued 14 h after starting levosimendan infusion. The trachea was extubated within 20 h and the patient was discharged to the ward on day 4 after admission. In conclusion, levosimendan in combination with a beta-adrenergic antagonist may have beneficial effects in patients with cardiogenic shock who exhibit tachycardia in response to inotropic agents.", 
    "94": "The effects of electroacupuncture stimulation (EAS) of the hind paw and the back on the mesenteric microhemodynamics in anesthetized rats were investigated using an intravital microscope system. Red blood cell (RBC) velocity in the mesenteric arterioles was measured by the dual-sensor method developed by the authors. Electrical stimulation was applied using two acupuncture needles inserted into the skin and the underlying muscles of the hind paw and the dorsal Th13-L1 level area. The hind-paw EAS evoked intensity-dependent pressor responses and increase responses in RBC velocity in mesenteric precapillary arterioles, while the back EAS evoked depressor responses and decrease responses in RBC velocity. Heart rate showed increase responses accompanying EAS either on the hind paw or the back. The pressor responses and increase responses in RBC velocity in mesenteric precapillary arterioles accompanying the hind paw EAS were abolished by an intravenous administration of alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist (phenoxybenzamine; POB), and the tachycardiac responses were abolished by administration of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (propranolol). Occasional but notable reflex vasoconstrictions in the mesenteric terminal arteriole were induced by EAS either on the hind paw or the back. These vasoconstrictive responses were not affected by the administration of POB. The present study directly demonstrated that hemodynamic changes at the level of precapillary arterioles accompanying EAS either on the hind paw or the back mainly depend on the changes of systemic arterial pressure regardless of stimulus current intensities. Moreover, the results in the present study suggest some receptors other than alpha-adrenergic receptor might be involved in the mechanism of EAS-induced vasoconstriction in the mesenteric arteriole.", 
    "95": "Hypertension is both a disease and risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and each 20/10 mm Hg rise in blood pressure (BP) doubles the risk for CVD. Although BP reduction through lifestyle modification and/or antihypertensive therapy has been shown to dramatically reduce the risk for CVD, recent evidence has shown that many patients with hypertension do not have adequate BP control. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) provides comprehensive guidelines on the diagnosis, classification, and management of hypertension and related CV conditions. The JNC 7 guidelines recommend that most patients receive first-line therapy with thiazide diuretics, but the majority of patients will require 2 or more antihypertensive agents to achieve adequate BP control. The selection of additional antihypertensive therapies should be based on the presence of concomitant CV and metabolic conditions as well as patient-specific factors such as race. An important role exists for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta-blockers, particularly in patients with comorbid CV or metabolic conditions. Clinical evidence suggests that these agents may offer benefits beyond simple BP lowering. Furthermore, synergies among antihypertensive classes may improve BP control and combination therapy may also permit the use of smaller doses of each medication and reduce the risk of dose-related adverse effects.",

Atrial fibrosis was quantified with Picrosirius Red staining. Left atrial diameter was increased (5.8+/-0.6 mm in MI vs. 3.6+/-0.3 mm in sham; P<0.0001), as was atrial fibrosis (26.7+/-3.8% in MI vs. 10.5+/-2.2% in sham; P<0.0001), which correlated with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after 3 months of MI. P-wave duration was also increased and premature atrial beats were frequent on the 24-h electrocardiogram. Similar improvements in LV dysfunction were observed after 1 month of spironolactone, ACE-inhibitor, or beta-blocker therapy alone or in combination.

Following a once-daily 50-mg dose of atenolol over the previous 11 months, her QTc remained prolonged at 560 ms. To minimise any increase in catecholamine levels and consequent risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias, a combined spinal-epidural technique was selected using intrathecal diamorphine and levobupivacaine, with intravenous and oral magnesium and potassium supplementation. Levobupivacaine was substituted for routine racemic bupivacaine to decrease the risk of drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Delivery outcome was successful and uneventful.

    "104": "Norepinephrine (NE) has demonstrated proconvulsant and antiepileptic properties; however, the specific pharmacology of these actions has not been clearly established. To address this, we studied the effect of NE on hippocampal CA3 epileptiform activity. Frequency changes of burst discharges in response to NE were biphasic; low concentrations increased the number of bursts, while higher concentrations reduced their frequency, suggesting the involvement of multiple adrenergic receptor (AR) types. This hypothesis was confirmed when, in the presence of betaAR blockade, increasing concentrations of NE caused a monophasic decrease in epileptiform activity. Antagonists selective for alpha1 or alpha2ARs were then used to determine which alphaAR type was involved. While discriminating concentrations of the alpha1AR antagonists prazosin and terazosin had no effect, selective amounts of the alpha2AR antagonists RS79948 and RX821002 significantly reduced the potency of NE in decreasing epileptiform activity. Furthermore, this antiepileptic action of NE persisted when all GABA-mediated inhibition was blocked. This data suggests that, under conditions of impaired GABAergic inhibition, the excitatory and inhibitory effects of NE on hippocampal CA3 epileptiform activity are mediated primarily via beta and alpha2ARs, respectively. Moreover, our results imply that the antiepileptic effect of alpha2AR activation in CA3 is not dependent on the GABAergic system.",

We explored protective, blood pressure-independent effects of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonist candesartan and the selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol. Diabetes mellitus was induced in 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats after injection of streptozotocin. Diabetic rats were randomized to treatment with candesartan or metoprolol in sub-antihypertensive doses or to placebo treatment. In the quadriceps, musculature markers of oxidative stress and inflammation were determined. Function of the inherent vascular bed was measured in vivo in the autoperfused hindlimb. Increases in NAD(P)H activity, expression of its cytosolic subunit p22(phox) and of endothelial NO synthase e(NOS) displayed enhanced oxidative stress. Upregulated intercellular (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and of inducible NOS (iNOS) revealed inflammatory processes. Diabetes was associated with severe impairment of endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilatation. Candesartan, but not metoprolol, reduced NAD(P)H activity, attenuated diabetes-induced over-expression of p22(phox) and eNOS mRNA as well as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, iNOS and eNOS immunoreactivity and led to a substantial improvement of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (+46.3% vs. placebo treatment; P<0.05). Angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonism, but not beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonism, ameliorates diabetes-generated oxidative stress, indicating a pivotal role of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of diabetic complications.",

Rational drug design became possible in the 1950s when theoretical knowledge of drug-target interaction and experimental drug testing could interlock in cycles of mutual advancement.

Three episcleral veins of rats with normal IOP were cauterized. Three months later we examined the effects on anterograde axonal transport from the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to the superior colliculus (SC) as well as on the number of neurons in the retinal ganglion layer (RGL). These parameters were also studied in a group of rats submitted to treatment with timolol after confirming that their IOP was still raised after two weeks. After the surgical procedure, the mean IOP of the experimental eyes increased to 33.5+/-1.06 mmHg (1.25 fold compared to the control group) and three months later the IOP remained significantly elevated; however, after a long period of treatment with timolol the IOP was 14.05+/-0.81 mmHg, similar to that of the control group. In the group with normal IOP, labelling with horseradish rabbit peroxidase (HRP) at 120 minutes and 24 hours postinjection showed continuous staining from the retina to the SC. In the experimental group the optic nerve head (ONH) was completely negative, although in the group treated with timolol there was partial block of axonal transport in the ONH, in which the staining was slightly more intense. The number of neurons in the RGL, counted by immunohistochemical labelling with Neu-N, showed that in eyes with normal and elevated IOP there were 423+/-11 neurons/mm(2) and 283+/-10 neurons/mm(2), respectively. After treatment with timolol the number of neurons (331+/-10 cells/mm(2) increased compared with elevated IOP eyes, although the number did not reach that of the control group. These results indicate that treatment with timolol, started two weeks after the surgical procedure, was partially neuroprotective because the loss of neurons in the RGL was lower than in untreated animals, though not sufficient to re-establish normal axonal transport.",

We compared the effects of beta(3)-AR activation on L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L) in isolated left ventricular myocytes obtained from normal and age-matched rats with isoproterenol (ISO)-induced HF (4 months after 340 mg/kg s.c. for 2 days). ICa,L was measured using whole-cell voltage clamp and perforated-patch recording techniques. In normal myocytes, superfusion of 4-[-[2-hydroxy-(3-chlorophenyl)ethylamino]propyl]phenoxyacetate (BRL-37,344; BRL), a beta3-AR agonist, caused a dose-dependent decrease in ICa,L with maximal inhibition (21%, 1.1 +/- 0.2 versus 1.4 +/- 0.1 nA) (p < 0.01) at 10(-7) M. In HF myocytes, the same concentration of BRL produced a proportionately greater inhibition (31%) in ICa,L (1.1 +/- 0.2 versus 1.6 +/- 0.2 nA) (p < 0.05). A similar inhibition of ICa,L was also observed with ISO (10(-7) M) in the presence of a beta1- and beta2-AR antagonist, nadolol (10(-5) M). Inhibition was abolished by the beta3-AR antagonist (S)-N-[4-[2-[[3-[3-(acetamidomethyl)phenoxy]-2-hydroxypropyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl]benzenesulfonamide (L-748,337; 10(-6) M), but not by nadolol. The inhibitory effect of BRL was attenuated by a nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10(-4) M), and was prevented by the incubation of myocytes with pertussis toxin (PTX; 2 microg/ml, 36 degrees C, 6 h). In conclusion, beta3-AR activation inhibits L-type Ca2+ channel in both normal and HF myocytes. In HF, beta3-AR stimulation-induced inhibition of Ca2+ channel is enhanced. These effects are likely coupled with PTX-sensitive G-protein and partially mediated through a NOS-dependent pathway.",

Drug effects were evaluated on the tonic contraction induced by KCl (80 mM) and on spontaneous, 1x10(-5) M phenylephrine-, and 1x10(-6) M PGF(2alpha)-induced rhythmic contractions in isolated canine ureteral preparations using a functional experimental technique. The potencies (pD(2) value) of the following drugs were compared: KUL-7211, tamsulosin (an alpha(1A/1D)-adrenoceptor antagonist), prazosin (an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist), verapamil (a Ca(2+)-channel blocker), butylscopolamine (a nonselective muscarinic antagonist), and papaverine (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor). The rank order of relaxing potencies against KCl-induced tonic contraction was KUL-7211 (6.60)>tamsulosin(5.90)>verapamil(5.70)>papaverine(4.88)>prazosin (4.54). The rank order of potencies for reductions in spontaneous rhythmic contractions was KUL-7211 (6.80)>verapamil(6.12)>papaverine(5.05). Conversely, high concentrations of the two alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists (tamsulosin and prazosin) and of butylscopolamine enhanced the spontaneous contractions, although at low concentrations (up to 1x10(-6) M) they had no significant effects. For suppression of spasmogen-induced rhythmic contractions, the rank order of potencies was, against phenylephrine-induced contractions: KUL-7211 (6.95)>tamsulosin(6.26)>prazosin(5.68)>verapamil(5.64)>papaverine (5.03), and against PGF(2alpha)-induced contractions: KUL-7211 (7.05)>verapamil(6.70)>papaverine (5.27).

The relaxant responses of beta-AR agonists were characterized using beta-AR antagonists in prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha)-precontracted arteries. The role of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium in beta-AR-mediated relaxation was also investigated. Isoprenaline (a non-selective beta-AR agonist) and salbutamol (a selective beta2-AR agonist) induced vasorelaxation. ICI 118551 (a selective beta2-AR antagonist) antagonized the effect of both isoprenaline and salbutamol (pA2 values of 9.57 and 9.51 respectively). In contrast, atenolol (1 microM) and CGP 20712A (0.1 microM), two beta1-AR antagonists, did not modify the relaxing effect of isoprenaline. The response to isoprenaline obtained in the presence of nadolol (10 microM, a beta1/beta2-AR antagonist) was not further inhibited by SR 59230A (1 microM, a selective beta3-AR antagonist). The non-beta1/beta2-AR agonists studied (BRL 37344, SR 58611A, and CGP 12177A) did not elicit vasorelaxation. Relaxation to isoprenaline and salbutamol was unaffected by L-N(G)-nitro-arginine methyl ester (100 microM, an inhibitor of NO synthase) or after endothelium removal. These results demonstrate the role of beta2-AR in mediating relaxation in rat intralobar pulmonary artery precontracted with PGF2alpha. They indicate that beta2-AR-mediated relaxation in this artery is NO- and endothelium-independent.

Cytokines induce the expression of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) leading to NO production. NO contributes to cytokine-induced apoptosis, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether NO modulates signalling via mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Akt.",

Accordingly, an NO donor (S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine, SNAP) dose-dependently caused apoptosis in INS-1 cells. SNAP activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK, but suppressed the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK. In rat islets, NOS inhibition decreased JNK and p38 activities induced by a 6-h exposure to IL-1beta. Likewise, IL-1beta-induced JNK and p38 activities were lower in iNOS(-/-) mouse islets than in wild-type islets. In human islets, SNAP potentiated IL-1beta-induced JNK activation. The constitutive level of active, Ser473-phosphorylated Akt in INS-1 cells was suppressed by SNAP. IGF-I activated Akt and protected against SNAP-induced apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-I was not associated with reduced JNK activation.",

After birth, because of frequent supraventricular extrasystoles, the infant was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Findings on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) showed frequent supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia with four beats as the longest run. At the age of 12 days, he developed cardiopulmonary arrest after crying out. A monitored ECG showed ventricular tachycardia. Twenty minutes after onset, a 12-lead ECG showed ventricular fibrillation, which returned to normal sinus rhythm with repeated DC cardioversion.

However, the potential adverse effects and specifically the negative inotropic actions of propranolol prompted our further investigation of the potential value of a non-beta-adrenergic inotropic drug, levosimendan, in conjunction with propranolol, for minimizing postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction after successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Ventricular fibrillation was induced and untreated for 7 minutes in 15 domestic pigs, which were divided into propranolol, propranolol plus levosimendan, and control groups. Propranolol was administered as a bolus dose of 0.1 mg/kg during cardiac arrest. Electrical defibrillation was attempted after 12 minutes of cardiac arrest including 5 minutes of precordial compression. Levosimendan was administered at 10 minutes after successful resuscitation in a dose of 20 microg/kg and followed by infusion of 0.4 microg/kg/min over the ensuing 220 minutes. Propranolol reduced energies or numbers of defibrillatory shocks and postresuscitation myocardial ectopy, and it improved postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction.

    "147": "Three groups of structurally diverse chiral compounds were used to study the interaction mechanism responsible for stereoselective recognition with teicoplanin as chiral selector in capillary liquid chromatography. Teicoplanin-based chiral stationary phase (CSP) was used. The effect of the variation of mobile phase composition on retention and enantioselective separation was studied. The mobile phase composition suitable for enantioresolution of the various chiral compounds differed according to the interaction forces needed for chiral recognition. Mobile phases with high buffer portion (70-90 vol.%) were preferred for separation of enantiomers of profen non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and chlorophenoxypropionic acid herbicides that require hydrophobic interactions, inclusion and pi-pi interactions for stereoselective recognition with teicoplanin. Higher concentration triethylamine in the buffer (0.5-1.0%) increased resolution of these acids. On the other hand, H-bonding and electrostatic interactions are important in stereoselective interaction mechanism of beta-adrenergic antagonists with teicoplanin. These interaction types predominate in the reversed phase separation mode with high organic modifier content (95% methanol) and in polar organic mobile phases. For this reason beta-adrenergic antagonists were best enantioresolved in the polar organic mode. The mobile phase composed of methanol/acetic acid/triethylamine, 100/0.01/0.01 (v/v/v), provided enantioresolution values of all the studied beta-adrenergic antagonists in the range 1.1-1.9. Addition of teicoplanin to the mobile phase, which was suitable for enantioseparation of certain compounds on the CSP, was also investigated. This system was used to dispose of nonstereoselective interactions of analytes with silica gel support that often participate in the interaction with CSPs. Very low concentration of teicoplanin in the mobile phase (0.1 mM) resulted in enantioselective separation of 2,2- and 2,4-chlorophenoxypropionic acids.", 
    "148": "Aside from the important role of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of heart failure, this biological peptide has proved to be an independent surrogate marker of rehospitalization and death of the fatal disease. Several randomized clinical trials demonstrated that drugs such as beta blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, spironolactone and amiodarone have beneficial effects in decreasing circulating BNP level during the management of chronic heart failure. The optimization of clinical decision-making appeals for a representative surrogate marker for heart failure prognosis. The serial point-of-care assessments of BNP concentration provide a therapeutic goal of clinical multi-therapy and an objective guidance for optimal treatment of heart failure. Nevertheless new questions and problems in this area remain to be clarified. On the basis of current research advances, this article gives an overview of BNP peptide and its property and role in the management of heart failure.",

Therefore, studies were conducted to elucidate the role of IKs in normal human ventricular muscle and in preparations in which both repolarization reserve was attenuated and sympathetic activation was increased by exogenous dofetilide and adrenaline.", 
    "150": "Preparations were obtained from undiseased organ donors. Action potentials were measured in ventricular trabeculae and papillary muscles using conventional microelectrode techniques; membrane currents were measured in ventricular myocytes using voltage-clamp techniques. Chromanol 293B (10 micromol/L), L-735,821 (100 nmol/L), and HMR-1556 (100 nmol/L and 1 micromol/L) produced a <12-ms change in APD while pacing at cycle lengths ranging from 300 to 5000 ms, whereas the IKr blockers sotalol and E-4031 markedly lengthened APD. In voltage-clamp experiments, L-735,821 and chromanol 293B each blocked IKs in the presence of E-4031 to block IKr. The E-4031-sensitive current (IKr) at the end of a 150-ms-long test pulse to 30 mV was 32.9+/-6.7 pA (n=8); the L-735,821-sensitive current (IKs) magnitude was 17.8+/-2.94 pA (n=10). During a longer 500-ms test pulse, IKr was not substantially changed (33.6+/-6.1 pA; n=8), and IKs was significantly increased (49.6+/-7.24 pA; n=10). On application of an \"action potential-like\" test pulse, IKr increased as voltage became more negative, whereas IKs remained small throughout all phases of the action potential-like test pulse. In experiments in which APD was first lengthened by 50 nmol/L dofetilide and sympathetic activation was increased by 1 micromol/L adrenaline, 1 micromol/L HMR-1556 significantly increased APD by 14.7+/-3.2% (P<0.05; n=3).",

    "152": "There are three members of the beta-adrenoceptor family, all of which are primarily coupled to G(s) proteins. Recent studies using the huge range of beta-ligands now available have given remarkable new insights into their pharmacology. beta1-adrenoceptors exist in at least two active conformations, whereas beta2-adrenoceptors are able to induce signaling via different agonist-induced receptor conformational states, and their affinity for antagonists can be altered by highly efficacious agonists. This study therefore examined the pharmacology of the human beta3-adrenoceptor stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Several compounds described previously as beta-antagonists have agonist properties at the beta3-adrenoceptor. Antagonist affinity measurements varied at the beta3-adrenoceptor in a manner similar to those observed at human beta1-adrenoceptors and unlike those seen at beta2-adrenoceptors. Some ligands (e.g., fenoterol and cimaterol) were more readily inhibited by all antagonists, whereas other ligands [e.g., alprenolol and 1-(2-ethylphenoxy)-3-[[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthalenyl]amino]-(2S)-2-propanol hydrochloride [SR 59230A]) stimulated responses that were more resistant to antagonism. Alprenolol inhibited fenoterol-induced beta3-adrenoceptor responses while acting as an agonist at higher concentrations. This is highly suggestive of two active conformational states of the beta3-adrenoceptor. (S)-4-[2-Hydroxy-3-phenoxypropylaminoethoxy]-N-(2-methoxyethyl)phenoxyacetamide (ZD 7114) stimulated a two-component response, of which the first component was more readily antagonized than the second. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the human beta3-adrenoceptor exists in at least two different agonist conformations with a similar high- and low-affinity pharmacology analogous to, if not as pronounced as, the beta1-adrenoceptor. Both conformations are present in living cells and can be distinguished by their pharmacological characteristics. In this respect, the human beta3-adrenoceptor seems similar to the human beta1-adrenoceptor.",

By 4 months postoperatively, the uncorrected visual acuity and BSCVA in the right eye had decreased to 20/40. Corneal topography of that eye was consistent with ectasia. One drop per day of timolol 0.5% (Timoptic XE) was prescribed. Five months postoperatively, the IOP had decreased and BSCVA and topography had improved. At 11 months, BSCVA returned to 20/20 and corneal topography normalized. Topographic difference maps were used to monitor corneal shape changes.

The present work aimed at evaluating the toxicity and pharmacology of D-arginine administered by the intraperitoneally route in albino male mice. Toxicity of D-arginine, alone as well as in the presence of propranolol and betamethasone was evaluated. D-Arginine in mice showed a light toxicity order (DL50: 2800 mg/kg). Previous injection of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), or betamethasone (0.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) produced a decrease in the toxicity of D-arginine (LD50: 3600 mg/kg, 3300 mg/kg, respectively). Also, a neuropharmacological screening of D-arginine using behavioural, neurological, autonomic, barbiturate-induced sleep time and pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions tests were performed. D-Arginine 700 mg/kg displayed central stimulant properties, whereas a depressant profile was observed at a dose of 1400 mg/kg.

Coexpression of the alpha subunits with the beta subunit resulted in a shift of the IC(50) value of GB to nanomolar values, indicating selectivity of GB for beta subunit containing GlyRs. We also analyzed the mechanism of GB inhibition and the effect of point mutations introduced into the alpha1 subunit. Our results are consistent with a channel blocking effect, since (i) GB inhibited glycine currents non-competitively, and (ii) a point mutation in the pore forming M2 domain reduced GB potency. In conclusion, GB is a potent blocker of beta subunit containing GlyR channels and hence can be used to discriminate homo- from hetero-oligomeric GlyRs. As hetero-oligomeric GlyRs are known to be synaptically localized, GB represents a channel blocker that may be employed to separate extrasynaptic from synaptic glycine currents.",

In broken membranes, where, as the situation with gramicidin, both sides of the non-polarized membrane were exposed to 130 mM Na(+), gramicidin was ineffective. Dopamine had a potency for membrane preparations that was not significantly different from that for control cells or synaptosomes, while other substrates had potencies for membrane preparations that were reduced to a level similar to those observed in gramicidin-treated cells or synaptosomes. These results suggest that diminishing Na(+) gradient and membrane potential may convert DAT to a conformational state that dopamine could easily bind to when gaining free access to its intracellular portion. In contrast, non-dopamine substrates may not be able to readily interact with this state from either side of the membrane."
