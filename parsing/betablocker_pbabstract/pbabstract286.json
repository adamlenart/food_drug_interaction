    "0": "A single dose of an alpha1-noradrenergic antagonist transiently reinstates hemiplegia after recovery from brain injury, which suggests that noradrenaline (NA) is required to maintain recovery. No systematic studies have determined the postinjury duration of this vulnerability. This study used a within-subject, dose-response design to determine whether prazosin (PRAZ), an alpha1-NA antagonist, or propranolol (PROP), a beta-NA antagonist, would continue to reinstate hemiplegia over time after recovery from weight-drop traumatic brain injury (TBI). PRAZ transiently reinstated hemiplegia as measured by beam walk (BW) score in a dose-dependent manner, with the same degree of symptom reinstatement at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-TBI. Between-animal variability in reinstatement of hemiplegia by PRAZ was predicted by severity of deficits in BW ability 24 h after TBI. In contrast, PRAZ did not reinstate tactile placing deficits at 1 month post-TBI suggesting a different mechanism of maintaining recovery for each task. Reinstatement of symptoms are not due to sedation. Only TBI rats receiving PRAZ, not high, sedating doses of PROP or saline (SAL), showed return of hemiplegia. These data indicate that vulnerability to transient reinstatement of hemiplegia on some tasks endures long after functional recovery from TBI.",

    "2": "Eighty eyes of 40 subjects with POAG were included in the study. Subjects were randomly divided into four groups given timolol maleate 0.50%, betaxolol HCl 0.50%, carteolol 1% or levobunolol 0.50% drops, applied twice daily (one drug to each group). Before beginning the treatment and at the end of the first month ocular blood flow velocity was measured using the color Doppler imaging (CDI) method. In the ophthalmic artery (OA), central retinal artery (CRA) and temporal posterior ciliary artery (TPCA) the peak systolic (PS) and end-diastolic (ED) blood flow velocities were measured and resistive index (RI) values were calculated. The results within each group were analysed using the matched paired student's t-test. The data between groups was compared with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison tests.", 
    "3": "The timolol group showed a significant increase in RI values of TPCA. In the betaxolol group RI decreased significantly in CRA and TPCA, whereas in the carteolol group there was a significant decrease only in CRA. In the levobunolol group there was no change in any artery. CONCLUSIONS. Betaxolol seemed to have a greater vasodilator effect than carteolol, and levobunolol had no effect on the retinal and choroidal vasculature. Timolol may have some vasoconstrictive effect in the ciliary vasculature.", 
    "4": "Despite publication of several randomized trials of prophylactic variceal ligation, the effect on bleeding-related outcomes is unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of the trials, as identified by electronic database searching and cross-referencing. Both investigators independently applied inclusion and exclusion criteria, and abstracted data from each trial. Standard meta-analytic techniques were used to compute relative risks and the number needed to treat (NNT) for first variceal bleed, bleed-related mortality, and all-cause mortality. Among 601 patients in 5 homogeneous trials comparing prophylactic ligation with untreated controls, relative risks of first variceal bleed, bleed-related mortality, and all-cause mortality were 0.36 (0.26-0.50), 0.20 (0.11-0.39), and 0.55 (0.43-0.71), with respective NNTs of 4.1, 6.7, and 5.3. Among 283 subjects from 4 trials comparing ligation with beta-blocker therapy, the relative risk of first variceal bleed was 0.48 (0.24-0.96), with NNT of 13; however, there was no effect on either bleed-related mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.61; confidence interval [CI], 0.20-1.88) or all-cause mortality (RR, 0.95; CI, 0.56-1.62). In conclusion, compared with untreated controls, prophylactic ligation reduces the risks of variceal bleeding and mortality. Compared with beta-blockers, ligation reduces the risk for first variceal bleed but has no effect on mortality. Prophylactic ligation should be considered for patients with large esophageal varices who cannot tolerate beta-blockers. Subsequent research should further compare ligation and beta-blockers to determine the effect on mortality, and measure ligation's cost-effectiveness.",

The chronotropic effects of the IgG and immunopurified anti-beta(1)RAbs or anti-M2RAbs were assessed on cultured cardiomyocytes before and after exposure to atropine and propranolol. The biochemical effects of the IgG from 9 patients from group I, 6 from group II, and 6 controls were evaluated on COS7 cells transfected with genes encoding for beta(1),beta(2)-adrenergic receptors (cAMP increment) or M(2)-cholinergic receptors (phosphatidylinositol increment). The IgG from group I patients exerted a positive chronotropic action, with a high prevalence of anti-betaRAbs (75%) and low prevalence of anti-M2RAbs (10.7%) and induced a clear-cut and long-lasting increment in cAMP. The IgG from group II patients depressed chronotropism, with a high prevalence of anti-M2RAbs (76.9%) and low prevalence of anti-betaRAbs (15.4%) and evoked a marked augmentation of phosphatidylinositol.",

We also hypothesized that ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers would beneficially affect the measured indices.", 
    "9": "In the cross-sectional analysis, plasma viscosity (P=0.001), fibrinogen (P=0.02), vWF (P<0.0001), and soluble P-selectin (P<0.001) levels were elevated in patients with CHF compared with healthy controls. Women demonstrated greater abnormalities of hemorheological indices and vWF than males (all P<0.05). Plasma viscosity (P=0.009) and fibrinogen (P=0.0014) levels were higher in patients with more severe symptoms (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III-IV), but there was no relationship with left ventricular ejection fraction. When ACE inhibitors were introduced, there was a reduction in fibrinogen (repeated-measures ANOVA, P=0.016) and vWF (P=0.006) levels compared with baseline. There were no significant changes in hemorheological, endothelial, or platelet markers after the introduction of beta-blocker therapy, apart from a rise in mean platelet count (P<0.001).", 
    "10": "Abnormal levels of soluble P-selectin, vWF, and hemorheological indices may contribute to a hypercoagulable state in CHF, especially in female patients and in those with more severe NYHA class. Treatment with ACE inhibitors improved the prothrombotic state in CHF, whereas the addition of beta-blockers did not. These positive effects of ACE inhibitors may offer an explanation for the observed reduction in ischemic events in clinical trials.",

Changes in mean IMT in the common carotid artery and maximal IMT in the bulb were the main outcome variables. Death and cardiovascular events were monitored. Progression of IMT(max) in the carotid bulb at both 18 and 36 months was reduced by metoprolol CR/XL (-0.058 mm/y; 95% CI, -0.094 to -0.023; P=0.004; and -0.023 mm/y; 95% CI, -0.044 to -0.003; P=0.014, respectively). Incidence of cardiovascular events tended to be lower in metoprolol CR/XL-treated patients (5 versus 13 patients, P=0.055). Rate of IMT(mean) progression in the common carotid at 36 months was reduced by fluvastatin (-0.009 mm/y; 95% CI, -0.015 to -0.003; P=0.002).

    "14": "We have recently suggested that atypical beta-adrenoceptors are present in guinea pig gastric fundus and duodenum. In the present study, we have shown that SR59230A (3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-ylamino]-(2S)-2-propanol oxalate), a selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist, possesses agonistic activities at atypical beta-adrenoceptors in these tissues. SR59230A caused concentration-dependent relaxations. However, (+/-)-propranolol (1 microM) did not affect SR59230A-induced relaxations. Pretreatment of with a combination of (+/-)-propranolol (1 microM) and the non-selective beta(1)-, beta(2)-, beta(3)- and beta(4)-adrenoceptor antagonist, (+/-)-bupranolol (30 microM), significantly antagonized the relaxant effects induced by SR59230A. The results clearly indicate that SR59230A acts as an atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonist on guinea pig gastric fundus and duodenum.", 
    "15": "In this study, we attempted to further characterize atypical beta-adrenoceptors on the guinea pig duodenum. (-)-Enantiomers of isoprenaline and noradrenaline were more potent than its (+)-enantiomers. The isomeric activity ratios ((+)/(-)) were less than those obtained in the guinea pig atria and trachea. The concentration-response curves to catecholamines ((-)-isoprenaline, (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline), to the selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist, BRL37344 ((R*, R*)-(+/-)-4-[2-[(2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)amino]propyl]phenoxyacetic acid sodium), and to the non-conventional partial beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist, (+/-)-CGP12177A ((+/-)-[4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one] hydrochloride), were resistant to blockade by (+/-)-pindobind, the beta-adrenoceptor alkylating agent. (-)-Noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline were more potent than dopamine and (-)-phenylephrine, respectively. Selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists possess agonistic activities at atypical beta-adrenoceptors. (+/-)-Propranolol and (+/-)-bupranolol had no agonistic effect, whereas (+/-)-alprenolol, (+/-)-pindolol, (+/-)-nadolol, (+/-)-CGP12177A and (+/-)-carteolol exhibited agonistic activities at atypical beta-adrenoceptors. These results suggest that pharmacological properties of atypical beta-adrenoceptors differ from those of conventional beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors on the guinea pig.",

    "18": "Under control conditions, sustained AF could be induced by single S(2) extrastimuli that caused unidirectional block and macroreentry. Sotalol (2 mg/kg) and dofetilide (0.04 mg/kg) failed to terminate AF in any dog, but prevented AF induction by S(2) stimuli in 19/22 (86%) and 4/5 (80%) of animals, respectively. With sotalol and dofetilide, unidirectional block still occurred, but wavefront reentry failed. The prevention of S(2)-induced reentry was related to large increases in the effective refractory period (ERP) at a BCL of 1000 ms, leading to ERPs that exceeded the conduction delay following S(2). Reverse use-dependent effects resulted in smaller ERP increases at BCLs closer to the AF cycle length. Although the number of zones of reactivation per cycle during sustained AF were decreased by sotalol and dofetilide, the changes were small and insufficient to terminate AF.",

    "20": "The effects of the activation of cyclic AMP-dependent Cl- current (ICl,cAMP) on cell volume were studied at various [K+]o under isosmotic conditions in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. The area of the cell image obtained with videomicroscopy was used as an index of cell volume. I(Cl,cAMP) was activated by adrenaline (5.5 microM). Measurements of the membrane potential (Vm) were performed by the gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp method. At 5.4 mM [K+]o with low [Cl-]o, where Vm was negative to the predicted equilibrium potential of Cl- (ECl), adrenaline sizably decreased the cell area. At high [K+]o with normal [Cl-]o, where Vm was positive to ECl, adrenaline increased the cell area; at 145.4 mM [K+]o the cell area was increased to 110% of control on average (n = 22). The cells swollen in this manner shrank when [Cl-]o was reduced to a low level in the presence of adrenaline. The results indicate that the induction of Cl- influxes (outward I(Cl,cAMP)) or effluxes (inward I(Cl,cAMP)) can lead to a cell swelling or shrinkage, respectively. The addition of BaCl2 (1 mm), a blocker of K+ channels, attenuated the adrenaline-dependent cell swelling, supporting the view that Cl- fluxes must be accompanied by cofluxes of K+ ions to affect the cell volume. The adrenaline-dependent cell swelling was inhibited by antagonizing beta-adrenergic stimulation with acetylcholine or by blocking I(Cl,cAMP) channels with glibenclamide, confirming the involvement of I(Cl,cAMP) in the adrenaline response. The results show that the activation of I(Cl,cAMP) can shrink or inflate the cardiac cells under isosmotic conditions, depending on Vm and ECl.", 
    "21": "Bimatoprost, a synthetic analogue of endogenous prostamides, is in development as a topical ocular hypotensive agent for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Prostamides are a newly discovered class of compounds that have been shown to have potent ocular hypotensive activity in the laboratory. Bimatoprost mimics the endogenous prostamides by lowering intraocular pressure (IOP). Bimatoprost provides outstanding control of IOP throughout the day, and a high percentage of patients receiving bimatoprost achieve the low target pressures important for clinical success. In controlled clinical trials, bimatoprost 0.03% given once daily has displayed efficacy superior to timolol 0.5% given twice daily, the current standard for therapy. Analysis of pooled six month data from two large Phase III trials demonstrated that mean IOP was consistently 2 - 3 mmHg lower with bimatoprost q.d. than with timolol b.i.d. Bimatoprost 0.03% q.d. has also been shown to provide significantly better diurnal IOP control than latanoprost 0.005% q.d., probably the most efficacious topical medication currently available. Patients receiving bimatoprost q.d. were more likely than timolol or latanoprost patients to achieve low target pressures. In all clinical evaluations, bimatoprost q.d. has been demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated. Bimatoprost will likely be available for clinical use in 2001 and it has great potential to be superior to all other medications in IOP-lowering efficacy. It is anticipated that bimatoprost will have an important role in therapy for glaucoma and ocular hypertension.", 
    "22": "One of the most recent contributions to the therapeutic arsenal available for the treatment of glaucoma is the prostaglandin (PG) analogues. They represent a new class of ocular hypotensive drugs, targeting the uveoscleral outflow of ocular aqueous humour. Two drugs, latanoprost and unoprostone, are presently commercially available. In terms of intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, latanoprost is the most powerful drug in clinical use today. The once daily dosing promotes compliance. Additional effect is achieved in combination with other hypotensive drugs, including those that increase trabecular outflow facility. The most frequent side effect is increased iris pigmentation that seems to be irreversible. A low frequency of cystoid macular oedema has been reported, predominantly in patients whose blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is compromised. Systemic side effects are rare. The experience with unoprostone is still much less than that with latanoprost. The ocular hypotensive mechanism of action of unoprostone is not well documented but an increase in uveoscleral outflow may be at least a part of its mode of action. Systemic side effects are rare and the ocular side effects seem to be mild. The ocular hypotensive effect is less than that of latanoprost and may not be suitable for monotherapy. It is widely accepted that the IOP alone is not responsible for the development of glaucomatous visual defects. It remains to be seen if this class of drugs will preserve vision in glaucoma patients better than other classes. More PG analogues are under development for potential clinical use.",

In these groups, 754 and 540 patients, respectively, required hospitalization for congestive heart failure. The probability that beta-blocker therapy reduced total mortality and hospitalizations for congestive heart failure was almost 100%. The best estimates of these advantages are 3.8 lives saved and 4 fewer hospitalizations per 100 patients treated in the first year after therapy. The probability that these benefits are clinically significant (>2 lives saved or >2 fewer hospitalizations per 100 patients treated) is 99%.

Subjects were recruited from patients attending other outpatient clinics and entered into the study if their SBP was more than 150 mm Hg after three visits. Patients were given a low and high dose of each of the main classes of drugs or placebo for 1 month each. The study was a balanced, randomized crossover design with five periods: placebo; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; beta-blocking drugs; calcium-blocking drugs; and thiazide diuretics. Blood pressure (BP) was measured 24 to 26 h after the previous dose. A questionnaire for side effects was administered at each visit. Seventy-four patients entered the study. beta-Blockers could not be used in 15 patients because of asthma or bronchospasm and these had two placebo periods. There were 9 of 66 patients on P, 9 of 46 on beta-blockers, 4 of 65 on calcium-blocking drugs, 4 of 65 on diuretic, and 1 of 62 patients on ACE inhibitors who did not progress to the higher dose because of side effects. Decreases in SBP compared to randomized placebo were calcium-blocking drugs 15 mm Hg = diuretic 13 mm Hg > ACE inhibitors 8 mm Hg = beta-blockers 5 mm Hg. Blood pressure decrease correlated with placebo BP (P < .0005, r = 0.53 to 0.70). When corrected for placebo, target SBP (<140 mm Hg) was reached in between 6% to 15% of patients on monotherapy. Sequential monotherapy achieved target in 29%. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium-blocking drugs, and diuretics had no more side effects than placebo. Patients on beta-blockers had more side effects and the well-being score was reduced. Diuretics and calcium-blocking drugs are more effective in elderly patients at lowering SBP pressure. beta-Blockers were relatively ineffective, were frequently contraindicated, and had more side effects. Monotherapy achieved control in only a small number of patients. In elderly people with essential hypertension, therapy should be instituted with diuretics or calcium-blocking drugs, but combination therapy will usually be required to achieve goal.",

In order to examine not only the existence of enantioselectivity but also the effect of enzyme inducer (PB or 3-MC) on PL metabolism, 500 microM PL (RS-PL, R(+)-PL or S(-)-PL) was incubated at 37 degrees C using 8 x 10(6) cells/ml isolated rat hepatocytes. Then, the elimination amount of PL and the formation amounts of eight kinds of the metabolites including ring hydroxylated metabolites (4-OH-, 5-OH- and 7-OH-PL) and side chain metabolites (NDP, AcNDP, PGL, NLA and NAA) were simultaneously determined by HPLC. By 3-MC- and PB-pretreatment, a significant increase was noticed in PL elimination and also in the formation of PL metabolites, NDP, NLA and NAA. Furthermore, the presence of enantioselectivity was observed, i.e. the substrate R(+)-PL was always eliminated faster than the substrate S(-)-PL. Regarding the metabolite formation, NDP, AcNDP and NAA were dominantly produced from R(+)-PL, and NLA, PGL and the ring hydroxylated metabolites from S(-)-PL. In all cases of PL elimination and the metabolite formation, the amounts of the metabolites derived from RS-PL indicated the mean values of the respective amounts derived from R(+)-PL and S (-)-PL. Using the three kinds of isolated rat hepatocytes mentioned above, the kinetic parameters of NDP-formation at 37 degrees C for 10 min were calculated using RS-PL, R(+)-PL or S(-)-PL as a substrate.

    "48": "The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src has been implicated in the switching of signaling of beta2-adrenergic receptors from adenylylcyclase coupling to the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In the current work, we demonstrate that Src plays an active role in the agonist-induced desensitization of beta2-adrenergic receptors. Both the expression of dominant-negative Src and treatment with the 4-amine-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) inhibitor of Src kinase activity blocks agonist-induced desensitization. Agonist triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta2-adrenergic receptor and recruitment and activation of Src. Because phosphorylation of the Tyr-350 residue of the beta2-adrenergic receptor creates a conditional, canonical SH2-binding site on the receptor, we examined the effect of the Y350F mutation on Src phosphorylation, Src recruitment, and desensitization. Mutant beta2-adrenergic receptors with a Tyr-to-Phe substitution at Tyr-350 do not display agonist-induced desensitization, Src recruitment, or Src activation. Downstream of binding to the receptor, Src phosphorylates and activates G-protein-linked receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), a response obligate for agonist-induced desensitization. Constitutively active Src increases GRK phosphorylation, whereas either expression of dominant-negative Src or treatment with the PP2 inhibitor abolishes tyrosine phosphorylation of GRK and desensitization. Thus, in addition to its role in signal switching to the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, Src recruitment to the beta2-adrenergic receptor and activation are obligate for normal agonist-induced desensitization.",

When estrogen was treated to HT22 cells, which lack functional ERs, Abeta-induced cell death was not affected. Transfection of HT22 cells with human ERalpha, but not ERbeta, restored protective action of estrogen against Abeta. Hoechst staining revealed that estrogen protected ERalpha-expressing cells by blocking Abeta-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that estrogen blocks Abeta-induced cell death via ERalpha-dependent pathways.", 
    "50": "The effects of diadenosine pentaphosphate (Ap5A), diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), alpha,beta-methyleneATP (alpha,beta-meATP), and ATP were studied on the excitability of unmyelinated axons in isolated rat vagus nerve by means of a computerized threshold tracking technique. All purinergic compounds produced an increase in excitability, however, only the effects of alpha,beta-meATP and of Ap5A were strongly reduced by 2'- (or 3') -O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP (TNP-ATP), a selective blocker for P2X1, P2X3, and heteromeric P2X2/3 receptors. The rank order of potency for TNP-ATP-sensitive excitation was determined as follows (30 microM each): alpha,beta-meATP >Ap5A > Ap4A = ATP. These data suggest that Ap5A might be an important naturally occurring agonist for P2X receptors at the axonal membrane of unmyelinated, including nociceptive, nerve fibres.", 
    "51": "A new high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been developed for the determination of the beta-receptor blocker carvedilol in human cardiac tissue. After homogenizing tissue samples in a microdismembrator, carvedilol and the internal standard naftopidil are extracted with acetone. The extract is evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in a potassium acetate buffer of pH 3.5. Samples are cleaned up with solid-phase extraction columns. Carvedilol and the internal standard show recoveries of 69.8 +/- 12.2% and 63.9 +/- 9.34%, respectively. The linearity range for carvedilol is 0.01-0.35 ng/mg (parts per billion) tissue (wet weight), and the limit of quantitation is 0.01 ng/mg. The percentage coefficient of variation of the intra-assay varies between 1.45 and 5.38% and the interassay between 4.25 and 6.96%. To use as an application of the assay, the cardiac carvedilol tissue level in a patient on oral carvedilol therapy for congestive heart failure is reported.", 
    "52": "Patients with heart failure show signs of cardiac sympathetic dysfunction such as elevation of blood norepinephrine (NE) level, as a result of reduction in the number of sympathetic nerves, decrease in myocardial NE content, accelerated NE turnover or spillover of NE, and NE reuptake disorder at sympathetic nerve endings. In dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), iodine 123-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) used clinically as a tracer for imaging of the sympathetic function was found to be useful in evaluation of severity and prognosis.", 
    "53": "A total of 143 (123)I-MIBG myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were taken at successive intervals on 58 patients with DCM (mean age 54 +/- 11 years), as well as before and after therapy to determine the severity of DCM and the therapeutic effect of beta-blocker. Patients were divided into group A (n = 20), in which left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved by 10% or more within 6 months after the administration of beta-blocker, and group B (n = 20), in which there was less than a 10% change in LVEF. After (123)I-MIBG myocardial SPECT was taken, the washout rate for the entire left ventricle was calculated from early and delayed images. The estimations of extent score and severity score were based on the polar map prepared from short axial images taken from 17 healthy volunteers (mean age 35 +/- 5 years). There was a significant correlation between LVEF and (123)I-MIBG findings (extent score, severity score, and washout rate) obtained before and after beta-blocker therapy. After beta-blocker therapy, LVEF and (123)I-MIBG findings significantly improved in group A. On the other hand, no change occurred in (123)I-MIBG findings in group B. There was no significant difference in LVEF between group A (32.1% +/- 8.0%) and group B (29.5% +/- 7.2%). Also, there was no significant difference in the washout rate between group A (54.4% +/- 10.9%) and group B (52.9% +/- 7.2%). Comparison of (123)I-MIBG images before beta-blocker therapy of group A and group B revealed that the extent score (26.5 +/- 16.0 vs 44.5 +/- 21.1, respectively; P <.01) and the severity score (24.9 +/- 21.9 vs 58.2 +/- 35.2, respectively; P <.01) on the basis of the early (123)I-MIBG image was significantly lower for group A.", 
    "54": "From the above findings, patients with DCM in which (123)I-MIBG uptake is high on early images were expected to show improvement in cardiac function by beta-blocker therapy. Findings also suggested that (123)I-MIBG was useful for examining the severity of DCM, determining the applicability of beta-blocker therapy, estimating the maintenance dosage of beta-blocker, and evaluating prognosis.",

    "56": "A single-blind randomized trial of 100 patients with stable coronary artery disease was performed in the outpatient clinic of a Veterans Affairs Health System. Outpatients with chronic stable angina taking at least 2 antianginal medications were studied. Patients were randomized to one of two treatments: optimal adjustment of their usual antianginal medications or conversion to solely long-acting medications (long-acting diltiazem +/- nitroglycerin patches +/- atenolol) with subsequent optimization. The primary outcome was the 3-month change in Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores. Although no differences in physical limitation scores were noted, patients randomized to receive long-acting medications had improved symptom control (3-month improvement in anginal stability [19.1 vs 5.6, P =.02] and anginal frequency [17.8 vs 5.5, P =.006]), more treatment satisfaction (3-month improvement of 8.2 vs 3.0, P =.057), and better quality of life (3-month improvement of 11.2 vs 5.6, P =.09) compared with patients whose pretrial medications were optimized. The improvement in symptom control was statistically significant.",

    "58": "The effect of hypothyroidism on gastrointestinal beta(1)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor function and expression was examined in rat ileal smooth muscle preparations. (-)-Isoprenaline and the selective beta(3) agonist disodium (R,R)-5-[2-[[2-3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-amino]propyl]-1,3-benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate (CL 316234) relaxed both control and hypothyroid tissues in a dose-dependent manner. Responses to isoprenaline were reduced in tissues from hypothyroid rats, as was the shift produced with the beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist, 3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-ylamino]-(2S)-2-propanol oxalate (SR 59230A). No change was seen in responses to CL 316243. Experiments with a selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist produced results suggesting that isoprenaline did not act at this receptor. Messenger RNA levels for both beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors were not affected by hypothyroidism. These results show that, unlike in adipose tissues, ileal beta(1)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptors are not directly regulated by thyroid hormone and that beta(3)-adrenoceptor coupling to the relaxation response is reduced in a rat model of hypothyroidism.", 
    "59": "Mechanisms underlying celiprolol-induced vasodilatation were analyzed in isolated porcine coronary arteries. Celiprolol induced dose-related relaxation of the artery rings with endothelium, an effect which was suppressed by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME), nitric oxide (NO) scavenger, guanylate cyclase inhibitor, endothelium denudation, and removal of Ca(2+). L-NAME contracted, and superoxide dismutase relaxed, the arteries only when the endothelium was preserved. Neither superoxide dismutase nor beta-adrenoceptor antagonists changed celiprolol-induced relaxations. Celiprolol increased the cyclic GMP content in the tissue. The release of NO from endothelium, estimated by the extracellular production of cyclic GMP in arteries incubated in medium containing guanylate cyclase and GTP, was augmented by celiprolol, and L-NAME abolished this action of celiprolol. It is concluded that celiprolol elicits relaxation by acting on sites other than beta-adrenoceptors in the endothelium and by releasing NO, which activates soluble guanylate cyclase in smooth muscle and produces cyclic GMP. Scavenging of superoxide anions from the endothelium does not seem to account for the induced relaxation.", 
    "60": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) after cardiac surgery is thought to increase length of stay (LOS). A clinical pathway focused on the management of postoperative AF, including prophylaxis with beta blockers, was implemented to assess the effect of AF on LOS after cardiac surgery. Data were obtained on consecutive cardiac surgery patients in preoperative normal sinus rhythm, no prior history of AF, and no chronic antiarrhythmic therapy from January to May 1995 (control) and November 1996 to June 1997 (pathway). Statistical analysis was performed to assess the effect of postoperative AF on the LOS, clinical outcomes, and cost after cardiac surgery. Despite the clinical pathway, the LOS (7 days for both periods; p = 0.12) and incidence of AF (28.9% vs 28.4%; p = 0.92) remained unchanged. Unadjusted direct costs were 15% higher in the pathway period (p <0.001). Increased rates of beta-blocker therapy had a marginal effect on the incidence of postoperative AF, except in the group who only underwent primary coronary artery bypass graft surgery (31.2% vs 25.3%; p = 0.31). Multivariate analysis revealed that AF contributed only 1 to 1.5 days to the LOS. Thus, this investigation represents the most recent analysis of the effects of postoperative AF on LOS, clinical outcomes, and cost after cardiac surgery. Unlike prior studies, the impact of postoperative AF is less prominent in the current era of cardiac surgical care regardless of the presence of a clinical pathway addressing AF.", 
    "61": "Hospital survival of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock has improved during recent years. It is unclear whether this mortality benefit also applies to elderly patients with cardiogenic shock. Elderly residents (age > or = 65 years) of the Worcester, Massachusetts metropolitan area (1990 census population = 437,000) hospitalized with confirmed AMI and cardiogenic shock in all metropolitan Worcester, Massachusetts hospitals between 1986 and 1997 constituted the sample of interest. We examined the use of coronary reperfusion strategies, adjunctive therapy, and hospital mortality in a cohort of 166 cardiogenic patients treated early in the reperfusion era (1986 to 1991) compared with 144 patients with AMI treated approximately 1 decade later (1993 to 1997). There was a significant increase in the use of an early revascularization strategy over time (2% vs 16%, p <0.001). Marked increases in use of antiplatelet therapy, beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were also observed over the decade-long experience. In-hospital case fatality declined significantly over time, from 80% (1986 to 1991) to 69% (1993 to 1997) in elderly patients who developed cardiogenic shock (p = 0.03). After adjusting for differences in potentially confounding prognostic characteristics between patients hospitalized in the 2 study periods, an even more pronounced reduction in hospital mortality (42%) was observed for the most recently hospitalized cohort. The most powerful predictor of in-hospital survival was use of an early revascularization approach to treatment. Thus, hospital mortality has declined for patients > or = 65 years of age with AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock, and this decline has occurred in the setting of broader use of early revascularization and adjunctive medical therapy for this high-risk population.", 
    "62": "The beneficial impact of beta blockade after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is clear, but beta-adrenergic blockers differ in multiple characteristics, including lipophilicity and selectivity. The impact of these factors on the effects of beta blockade is unknown. We therefore compared the effects of different beta blockers on mortality after AMI. Charts of 201,752 patients with AMI were abstracted by the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, a quality assurance program sponsored by the Health Care Financing Administration. Of the 69,338 patients prescribed beta blockers, we compared mortality of patients receiving different beta-adrenergic blockers using the Cox proportional-hazards model accounting for multiple factors that might influence survival. The mortality rates of the 2 selective agents, metoprolol and atenolol, were virtually identical (13.5% and 13.4% 2-year mortality, respectively). Compared with metoprolol, patients discharged on propranolol had a slightly increased mortality (15.9% 2-year mortality), which may be related to undetected differences at baseline. Survival with all of the drugs was superior to the 23.9% 2-year mortality seen in patients not receiving beta blockers. Beta blockade overall was associated with a 40% improvement in survival. Although the use of beta blockade after AMI has major prognostic importance, the present study suggests that the specific beta blocker chosen will have little influence on mortality.", 
    "63": "Despite scientific evidence that secondary prevention medical therapies reduce mortality in patients with established coronary artery disease, these therapies continue to be underutilized in patients receiving conventional care. To address this issue, a Cardiac Hospital Atherosclerosis Management Program (CHAMP) focused on initiation of aspirin, cholesterol-lowering medication (hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A [HMG CoA] reductase inhibitor titrated to achieve low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol < or =100 mg/dl), beta blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in conjunction with diet and exercise counseling before hospital discharge in patients with established coronary artery disease. Treatment rates and clinical outcome were compared in patients discharged after myocardial infarction in the 2-year period before (1992 to 1993) and the 2-year period after (1994 to 1995) CHAMP was implemented. In the pre- and post-CHAMP patient groups, aspirin use at discharge improved from 68% to 92% (p <0.01), beta blocker use improved from 12% to 62% (p <0.01), ACE inhibitor use increased from 6% to 58% (p <0.01), and statin use increased from 6% to 86% (p <0.01). This increased use of treatment persisted during subsequent follow-up. There was also a significant increase in patients achieving a LDL cholesterol < or =100 mg/dl (6% vs 58%, p <0.001) and a reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction and 1-year mortality. Compared with conventional guidelines and care, CHAMP was associated with a significant increase in use of medications that have been previously demonstrated to reduce mortality; more patients achieved an LDL cholesterol < or =100 mg/dl, and there were improved clinical outcomes in patients after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction.",

The ACE deletion allele (ACE D) is associated with increased renin-angiotensin activation; however, its influence on patient outcomes remains uncertain, and the pharmacogenetic interactions with beta-blocker therapy have not been previously evaluated.", 
    "66": "We prospectively followed 328 patients (age, 56.1+/-11.9 years) with systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.24+/-0.08) to assess the impact of the ACE D allele on transplant-free survival (median follow-up, 21 months). Transplant-free survival was compared by genotype for the whole cohort and separately in patients with (n=120) and those without beta-blocker therapy (n=208) at the time of entry. Transplant-free survival was significantly poorer for patients with the D: allele (1-year percent survival II/ID/DD=94/77/75; 2-year=78/65/60; ordered log-rank test, P:=0.044). In patients not treated with beta-blockers, the adverse impact of ACE D allele was dramatically increased (1-year percent survival II/ID/DD=95/75/67; 2-year=81/61/48; P:=0.005). In contrast, in patients receiving beta-blocker therapy, no influence of ACE genotype on transplant-free survival was evident (1-year percent survival II/ID/DD=91/80/86; 2-year=70/71/77; P:=0.73).", 
    "67": "In a cohort of patients with systolic dysfunction, the ACE D allele was associated with a significantly poorer transplant-free survival. This effect was primarily evident in patients not treated with beta-blockers and was not seen in patients receiving therapy. These findings suggest a potential pharmacogenetic interaction between the ACE D/I polymorphism and therapy with beta-blockers in the determination of heart failure survival.", 
    "68": "We determined the effects of fentanyl, sufentanil, morphine, and meperidine on the spontaneous contractility of isolated human pregnant uterine muscle strips. Uterine specimens were obtained from normal full-term parturients undergoing elective lower-segment cesarean delivery. Longitudinal muscle strips were prepared and mounted vertically in tissue chambers to record their isometric tension. Opioid concentration-response curves were constructed after rhythmic contractions were established. The responses were also examined in the presence of opioid receptor blocker, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, beta-adrenoceptor blocker, or cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Fentanyl and meperidine inhibited uterine contractility in a concentration-dependent manner, their concentration that inhibited 50% being 2.3 x 10(-6) and 1.0 x 10(-3)M, respectively. Sufentanil and morphine had no significant effects on uterine contractility. Pretreatment with either naloxone, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, atenolol, or indomethacin did not affect the uterine responses to opioids. These results demonstrate that fentanyl and meperidine may have direct inhibitory effects on the contractility of the human uterus, though at supraclinical concentrations.",

    "70": "We examined the relative roles of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in mediating the alpha1-adrenergic receptor (alpha1-AR) stimulated hypertrophic phenotype in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Norepinephrine (NE; 1 microM) in the presence of the beta -AR antagonist propranolol (Pro; 2 microM) caused activation of Ras (>six-fold), MAPK/ERK kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2, >10-fold) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2, approximately 30-fold) within 5 min, as determined by kinase activity assays and Western blots using phospho-specific antibodies. Conversely, p38 and c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK) were not activated by NE/Pro. Activated MEK1/2 signals remained detectable at 2 h, and activated ERK1/2 remained detectable at 48 h. The alpha1-AR selective inhibitor prazosin (100 nM) completely inhibited the NE/Pro-stimulated activation of Ras, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of NE/Pro-stimulated protein synthesis (as assessed by [3H]leucine incorporation and cellular protein accumulation) and ERK1/2 activation, with approximately 50% inhibition at a concentration between 10 and 50 microM, which is consistent with the known IC50 values of PD98059 for MEK1 (4 microM) and MEK2 (50 microM). Thus, these data show that alpha1-AR stimulated hypertrophy in ARVM is dependent on the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway.", 
    "71": "The effects of chronic pretreatment with isoproterenol (5 mg kg(-1)) daily for 10 days on cardiac alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in Langendorff heart preparations were investigated. Isoproterenol pretreatment caused cardiac hypertrophy (29%) as shown by a significant increase in the ratio of ventricular dry weight to body weight. In preparations from isoproterenol-pretreated rats, both maximum increases in left ventricular systolic pressure and heart rate elicited by isoproterenol (10(-12) to 10(-4) M) were significantly reduced (the isoproterenol concentration producing 50% of the maximum positive inotropic and chronotropic responses was enhanced almost 32- and 4-fold, respectively), while the positive inotropic response to phenylephrine (10(-12) to 10(-4) M) was significantly enhanced (the phenylephrine concentration producing 50% of the maximum positive inotropic effect was reduced almost 100-fold), compared with saline-pretreated rats. In preparations from both groups, phenylephrine infusion induced non-significant changes in heart rate and its positive inotropic response was reduced in the presence of propranolol (10(-7) M) in the perfusion medium. Even under beta-adrenoceptor blockade, the curve for the phenylephrine-induced positive inotropic effect remained shifted upward after isoproterenol pretreatment. Chronic isoproterenol pretreatment induces the expected cardiac beta-adrenoceptor desensitization while simultaneously enhancing the positive inotropic responsiveness to phenylephrine in Langendorff heart preparations. These findings support the hypothesis that cardiac alpha1-adrenoceptor stimulation may contribute to the maintenance of myocardial function under conditions in which beta-adrenoceptor function is compromised.",

The separation was carried out on silica gel 60 F254, using ethanol-glacial acetic acid (4:1, v/v) as mobile phase. Second order polynomial equation was used for the regression line. The third method was based on high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation of acebutolol HCl from its acid-induced degradation product on a reversed phase, ODS column using a mobile phase of methanol-water (55:45, v/v) with UV detection at 240 nm.

    "75": "In the primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage, beta-blockers continue to be the first-line treatment. Newer nonselective beta-blockers with anti-alpha1-adrenergic activity, such as carvedilol, appear to have a better impact on reducing the hepatic venous pressure gradient than propranolol. The addition of isosorbide mononitrate appears to improve the effectiveness of beta-blockers in primary prophylaxis, but not that of somatostatin in the treatment of acute variceal hemorrhage. The use of vasoactive drugs alone in acute variceal bleeding has not proved to be more effective than endoscopic treatment. The advent of endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) has strengthened the role of endoscopy in the management of bleeding esophageal varices. EVL has improved the results, particularly in terms of lowering the treatment-related morbidity, compared with endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS). However, the variceal recurrence rate after initial eradication with EVL is relatively high. In contrast to synchronous combined therapy with EVL plus EVS, metachronous combination of EVL and low-dose EVS may improve the results of EVL alone. For bleeding fundic varices, obliteration using cyanoacrylate is currently the treatment of choice. Endosonography (EUS) is coming into more widespread use in the assessment of variceal eradication and in further attempts to improve the results of endoscopic injection therapy. According to two meta-analysis studies, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is not yet capable of replacing endoscopic treatment in the secondary prevention of variceal bleeding.", 
    "76": "Imidazoline compounds have been considered for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We have now investigated the effects of imidazolines on interleukin (IL)-1beta-induced beta-cell apoptosis and the signal transduction pathways involved. Inhibition of Ca2+ influx into beta-cells by D-600, a blocker of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels, suppressed IL-1beta-induced apoptosis. Our data show that calcineurin, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2B, is responsible for the effect of Ca2+ on beta-cell apoptosis. We also demonstrate that IL-1beta-mediated apoptosis correlates with expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the increase in intracellular production of nitric oxide. An inhibitor of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), KT5823, suppressed IL-1beta-induced apoptosis, suggesting the involvement of a PKG-dependent pathway in the apoptotic process. One of the major findings in this study is that imidazoline compounds RX871024 and efaroxan, suggested as prototypes of a new generation of drugs against type 2 diabetes, can protect against IL-1beta-induced apoptosis in pancreatic beta-cells, possibly by their inhibition of the expression of iNOS, a key element in the IL-1beta-induced apoptotic pathway in pancreatic beta-cells. These data suggest that imidazoline compounds should be explored as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",

After an oral dose of 100 mg, about 55% of the bioavailable talinolol is eliminated unchanged in the urine. This fraction is reduced to 25% in patients with moderate to severe renal failure. A strong correlation was found between the renal elimination of talinolol and creatinine clearance. In patients with renal failure, the delayed elimination leads to an increase in t(1/2z) and to a decrease in the apparent total body clearance. Steady state trough levels (c(min)ss) in these patients are about 2.2-fold higher than in volunteers. The hemodialysability of talinolol was low.",

Of these, 36 were treated with class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs and rate control drugs (group 1) and 76 were treated with rate control alone (group 2). Group 3 consisted of 151 randomly selected patients who did not have AF. All patients were reevaluated at 6 weeks to determine their rhythm and clinical status. Only one patient each in groups 1 and 2 was in AF 6 weeks after discharge. There was a trend toward a higher mortality and morbidity in group 2 patients. PAF after coronary surgery appears to be a self-limited disease process. In this cohort of patients, the rate of recurrence of AF after discharge was similar in patients receiving class I or class III antiarrhythmic drugs together with rate control agents compared to those receiving rate control drugs alone.", 
    "89": "Several studies have demonstrated that essential hypertension is accompanied by sympathetic activation, which contributes to blood pressure elevation. Sympathetic activation also has adverse consequences in hypertensive patients beyond initiating blood pressure elevation. There is evidence that neural vasoconstriction has metabolic effects in skeletal muscle, impairing glucose delivery to muscles. In the liver, retarding of post prandial clearance of lipids contributes to hyperlipidemia. Cardiac sympathetic activation is a probable cause of sudden death in hearth failure. A trophic effect of sympathetic activation on cardiovascular growth is also likely, contributing to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Consequently, one of the major aims of antihypertensive therapy should be to attenuate sympathetic tone. It is possible that, among the antihypertensive drugs available, those inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system might best reduce cardiovascular risk.", 
    "90": "The pineal gland in humans is under both alpha- and beta-adrenergic control, although it seems that beta1-adrenoceptors are mainly implicated in melatonin secretion. In the present study, we evaluated the role of beta-adrenergic innervation on melatonin production and its relation with the production of growth hormone (GH). Thirty-four children (15 males and 19 females, mean age 10.5 +/- 0.8 years) from the University of Granada Hospital were studied. The children were included in a protocol for the evaluation of growth delay using the propranolol + exercise test. This standardized test allowed us to study simultaneously the role of an unspecific beta-adrenergic blocker such as propranolol and of an adrenergic stimulus such as exercise on the pineal production of melatonin. Changes in plasma levels of melatonin and GH were determined at basal, 120 and 140 min after the test was applied. Hormonal determinations were carried out by commercial radioimmunoassay kits previously standardized in our laboratory. The results show a significant decrease in plasma melatonin levels at 120 and 140 min after the test (P < 0.05), whereas GH levels increased significantly at 140 min (P < 0.001). The decrease of melatonin levels was a consequence of the test, since in a control group, the circadian decay of melatonin was significantly less pronounced (P < 0.05). These data suggest an inverse relationship between melatonin and GH after the propranolol + exercise test, and the reduction in melatonin may be related to its depletion by exercise-induced oxidative stress.", 
    "91": "We developed a new high-performance liquid chromatographic method using an ODS column and a chiral column for the assay of racemic 4-OH-PL sulfate and enantiomeric 4-OH-PL sulfates, respectively. The method was successfully applied to measure phenolsulfotransferase (PST) activities for 4-OH-PL in cytosolic fractions from livers of Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata) and for comparison with its activity of cytosolic fractions from rat, rabbit, dog, and human livers and Hep G2 cells. The activity was ranked as Hep G2 cells > monkeys = humans = dogs = rats > rabbits. To evaluate the Japanese monkey as a nonhuman animal model in drug metabolism studies, we further characterized sulfation of 4-OH-PL as a further metabolic pathway in monkey livers to compare that with human livers. Inhibition studies in which cytosolic fractions were preincubated at 43 degrees C or 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol (DCNP) used as a PST inhibitor indicated that two kinds of PSTs, thermolabile, low-Km and DCNP-resistant PST and thermostable, high-Km and DCNP-sensitive PST were involved in 4-OH-PL sulfation by monkey liver cytosol, which is very similar to the reported profile of 4-OH-PL sulfation by human liver cytosol. Sulfation kinetics in a low concentration range of 4-OH-PL enantiomers demonstrated that apparent Km values were similar between human and monkey liver cytosolic fractions, but the Vmax values were different, so that intrinsic clearance values (Vmax/Km, Clint) were higher in monkeys than in humans. Furthermore, enantiomer selectivity of [R(+)-4-OH-PL > S(-)-4-OH-PL] was observed in the Vmax and CLint values of monkey liver cytosol. These results indicate that the profile of sulfation of 4-OH-PL by liver cytosolic fractions is similar in humans and Japanese monkeys.",

    "98": "Patients with oesophageal varices without previous bleeding have a risk of 25-30% for the development of a bleeding episode within two years. It is important to identify patients with a high risk of bleeding due to the high mortality of 30-40% within six weeks after a bleeding episode. Treatment with a non-selective betablocker possibly combined with isosorbidnitrate should be initiated if an upper endoscopy shows the presence of medium- or large-sized oesophageal varices. Sclerotherapy or ligation initiated within a short time after start of an acute bleeding episode reduces mortality and risk of bleeding. Pharmacological treatment may have effect on the acute episode, and most data advocate for Terlipressin to be the first choice. If bleeding continues transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) should be considered. Fifty to seventy percent of patients will experience a rebleeding episode if otherwise untreated. Endoscopic ligation should be preferred possibly in combination with a non-selective betablocker. If another bleed occurs the patient should be considered for TIPS or transplantation.",

The etiology of preeclampsia is still unknown. Delivering the baby is the only definite treatment. The benefits of acute pharmacological control of severe hypertension prior to and/or post-delivery are generally accepted. Most drugs commonly used in the management of severe hypertension in pregnancy have significant maternal and/or neonatal adverse side effects. Furthermore, some are not effective to acutely lower the blood pressure in patients with a hypertensive crisis. Until recently not one of the commonly used antihypertensive drugs has been tailored to the pathophysiology of severe preeclampsia, being a clinical syndrome characterized by endothelial cell dysfunction, vasospasm and platelet aggregation. Ketanserin, a serotonin(2)-receptor blocker, is a drug that appears to be tailored for treating this pregnancy-associated enthothelial cell dysfunction. The results of several prospective trials show that there is a definite place for serotonin(2)-receptor blockers in the treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders. This review provides a summary on the more established drugs as well as on some of the newer antihypertensive drugs used in pregnancy with emphasis on the existing experience with ketanserin.", 
    "100": "Twenty-four genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene were analysed in liver DNA samples of 39 Japanese and 44 Caucasians and compared with CYP2D6 protein levels and bufuralol 1'- and 6-hydroxylation activities in liver microsomes of these human samples. We detected 13 types of CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms and classified these into 20 genotypes; nine types were found in Japanese and 14 types in Caucasian samples. CYP2D6*10B, but not CYP2D6*10A, was the most frequent (34.6%) in Japanese. In Caucasians, several CYP2D6 polymorphisms including CYP2D6*4, *4D, *4E, *4L, *3, *9, *5 and *2E (frequencies of 6.8, 3.4, 4.5, 9.1, 1.1, 2.3, 2.3 and 4.5%, respectively) were detected. A Caucasian having CYP2D6*3/*5 had a protein with slower gel mobility (immunoblotting with anti-CYP2D6 antibody) and very low activity for bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation. Five Caucasian samples (CYP2D6*4/*4, *4/*4L, or *4D/*4L) had no measurable CYP2D6 protein and very low bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation activities. Seven Japanese subjects with CYP2D6*10B/*10B had CYP2D6 protein at levels of approximately 20% of those present in humans with CYP2D6*1 and *2 and catalysed bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation at low rates. Kinetic analysis of bufuralol 1'- and 6-hydroxylation indicates that (i) the Km values for 1'-hydroxylation were lower in individuals with CYP2D6*1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*2X2, and *2/*2 than those with CYP2D6*4/*4, *4/*4L, *4D/*4L, or *10B/*10B and Vmax values tended to be higher in the former groups (*1, *2), and (ii) individuals with heterozygous CYP2D6*1/*4D, *1/*4L, and *1/*5 had relatively high Vmax/Km ratios, whereas individuals with heterozygous CYP2D6*1/*9, *2/4D, *2/*5, *2/*10B, *2E/*4E, *3/*5, *4L/*9, and *10B/*39 had lower Vmax/Km ratios for bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation. Quinidine inhibited bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation in liver microsomes, particularly at low substrate concentrations, in individuals with CYP2D6*1/*1, and 1/1*2, but not those with CYP2D6*4/*4 and very slightly in individuals with CYP2D6*10B/*10B. The latter two groups were found to be more sensitive to alpha-naphthoflavone than the former groups, indicative of the contribution of CYP1A2. These results support the view that CYP2D6*3, *4, *4D, and *4L are major genotypes producing poor metabolizer phenotypes in CYP2D6 in Caucasians, whereas CYP2D6*10B is a major factor in decreased CYP2D6 protein expression and catalytic activities in Japanese.",

    "105": "Left bundle branch block (LBBB), traditionally viewed as an electrophysiologic abnormality, is increasingly recognized for its profound hemodynamic effects. LBBB causes asynchronous myocardial activation, which, in turn, may trigger ventricular remodeling. Exercise nuclear studies frequently show reversible perfusion defects in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease and some patients with intermittent LBBB develop angina coincident with the onset of LBBB. It is uncertain, however, if these phenomena are because of myocardial ischemia or ventricular asynergy. LBBB is associated with impaired systolic and diastolic function. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), LBBB is accompanied by progressive left ventricular (LV) dilatation and mitral regurgitation. It is not known whether LBBB is the cause or the consequence of LV dilatation. DCM patients with LBBB, as compared to those with normal intraventricular conduction, are more likely to have a nonischemic etiology, profound LV dilatation, lower ejection fraction, increased symptomatology, and shorter survival. Patients with DCM and acceleration-dependent LBBB may benefit from restoration of a narrow QRS complex by suppressing the heart rate with beta-blocker. There is extensive research underway in patients with DCM and LBBB to evaluate the short and long-term effects of normalization of ventricular activation sequence with high septal, LV, or biventricular pacing.",

These results, transposed to the French population, may be used to evaluate the economic advantages of Carvedilol by developing a cost-effectiveness study which consists in relating the direct expenses (drugs and hospital admissions) of each of the two strategies, with or without Carvedilol, to their respective mortalities. Hospital expenses were estimated with respect to the H.M.G. corresponding to each hospital stay at 1997-1998 values. The cost in the Carvedilol group was 2,823 FF per patient (including 1,491 FF for the drug itself) but 2,056 FF were economised in hospital expenses. With an increased cost of 767 FF but a 50% reduction in mortality corresponding to a difference in mortality of 45@1000, the cost-effectiveness of Carvedilol was 17,040 per life saved and 2,130 FF per additional year of life expectancy. A study of the sensitivity produced even more favourable results of Carvedilol.

Therefore, current guidelines for treatment of CHF now include beta blockers as standard therapy for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction < or = 40%) and mild to moderate heart failure. Beta-blocker therapy for CHF should be started cautiously and increased gradually to avoid exacerbating symptoms of heart failure. At this time, data for therapy in patients with NYHA class I or IV symptoms are limited, and it is unclear whether all beta blockers confer benefit or whether some are better than others. Several trials are under way to answer these questions. Until more evidence is available, only those agents that have proved beneficial in mortality trials should be used to manage CHF.",

    "111": "This study focused on the contribution of different adrenoreceptor subtypes to the modulation of fictive swimming activity in a relatively simple, yet intact, lower vertebrate system, the immobilized Xenopus laevis tadpole and explored their possible role in mediating the noradrenergic modulation of spinal motor networks. In Xenopus embryos, near the time of hatching, activation of alpha(1) adrenoreceptors increased the duration of episodes of fictive swimming, whilst in larvae, 24 h after hatching, they were decreased. Activation of alpha(2) adrenoreceptors, however, markedly reduced episode duration at both developmental stages. Cycle periods in both stages were increased by the activation of alpha(1) and/or alpha(2) receptor subclasses, whereas beta adrenoreceptors were not apparently involved in the modulation of cycle periods or the duration of swim episodes. However, both beta and alpha(1) receptor activation decreased the intersegmental delay in the head-to-tail propagation of swimming activity, while alpha(2) receptors did not influence these rostro-caudal delays. Activation of neither alpha, nor beta, receptor subclasses had any consistent effect on the duration of ventral motor bursts. Our findings suggest that noradrenergic modulation of the swim-pattern generator in Xenopus tadpoles is mediated through the activation of alpha and beta adrenoreceptors. In addition, activation of particular receptor subclasses might enable the selective modulation of either the segmental rhythm generating networks, the intersegmental coordination of those networks or control at both levels simultaneously.",

When the conditioned taste is unfamiliar, formation of long-term CTA memory depends on muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and protein synthesis. We show that extinction of CTA memory is also dependent on protein synthesis and beta-adrenergic receptors in the IC, but independent of muscarinic receptors and MAPK. This resembles the molecular signature of the formation of long-term memory of CTA to a familiar taste. Thus, memory extinction shares molecular mechanisms with learning, but the mechanisms of learning anew differ from those of learning the new.",

Ligands of catecholamine-like- (five), imidazoline- (nine) and non-catecholamine-non-imidazoline-type (five) were included. 2. The relative maximum responses were similar in both assays. Five ligands were full or nearly full agonists, six produced 20 - 70% of the response to a full agonist and the remaining eight gave lower responses (< 20%) so that their potencies were difficult to evaluate. 3. Marked differences in the potencies of the agonists with respect to the two measured responses were seen. The catecholamines were several times less potent in decreasing cyclic AMP than in increasing Ca(2+), whereas the other, both imidazoline and ox-/thiazoloazepine ligands, were several times more potent with respect to the former than the latter response. For instance, UK14,304 was more potent than adrenaline with respect to the cyclic AMP response but less potent than adrenaline with respect to the Ca(2+) response. 4. All the responses were sensitive to pertussis toxin-pretreatment. Also the possible role of PLA(2), beta-adrenoceptors or ligand transport or metabolism as a source of error could be excluded. The results suggest that the active receptor states produced by catecholamines and the other agonists are markedly different and therefore have different abilities to activate different signalling pathways.",

    "120": "The effects of pindolol, melatonin, and the melatonin receptor agonist agomelatine were studied in rats implanted for chronic sleep procedures. Administration of pindolol (1.0-4.0 mg/kg) during the light phase induced a significant reduction of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) and an increase of waking (W). In the rats recorded after receiving 1.0-6.0 mg/kg melatonin no significant differences were found in sleep or W compared with controls. Agomelatine (1.0-6.0 mg/kg) induced a significant increase of light sleep during the first 3 h of the recording period. Pretreatment with melatonin partly prevented the pindolol-induced suppression of REMS. However, agomelatine was ineffective in this respect. Overall, these data suggest that the decreased production of melatonin could play a role in REMS suppression related to pindolol administration.",

We have previously shown that terbutaline stimulates secretion of PC by fetal type II cells, but the response wanes after 30 minutes. We studied the effects of salmeterol, a highly selective, long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist that does not cause receptor desensitization, on PC secretion by adult type II alveolar cells in primary culture. Release of lactate-dehydrogenase was < 4% and did not vary with the concentration of salmeterol. Salmeterol stimulated PC secretion in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximum effective-concentration tested was 50 nM and the EC50 was 11.40 +/- 1.14 nM. Propranolol inhibited the effect of salmeterol on release of PC, confirming that the effects of salmeterol are mediated by beta-receptors. OT50, the time for onset of action, was 32.0 +/- 1.6 minutes. RT50, the time to achieve 50% recovery from maximal stimulation was, 393.0 +/- 20.2 minutes. We conclude that salmeterol stimulates PC secretion by type II cells through activation of beta-adrenergic receptors and has a longer duration of action (>6 hours) compared to other beta2-agonists. Salmeterol may be a useful drug with which to study the role of receptor desensitization in the developmental changes in PC secretion.",

In the presence of (+/-)-propranolol (1 microM), the additional presence of (+/-)-bupranolol (3-30 microM), a non-selective beta1-, beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptor antagonist, caused a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the CRCs to catecholamines and beta3-adrenoceptor agonists. Schild plot analyses of (+/-)-bupranolol against these agonists gave pA2 values of 6.02 ((-)-isoprenaline), 6.03 ((-)-noradrenaline), 6.01 ((-)-adrenaline), 6.56 (BRL37344) and 5.74 ((+/-)-CGP12177A), respectively. All Schild plot slopes were not significantly different from unity. The pA2 values of (+/-)-bupranolol obtained for the guinea-pig beta3-adrenoceptors were about one log unit less than the values obtained for the rat beta3-adrenoceptors and about two log units less than the values obtained for dog beta3-adrenoceptors. 5. These results confirm that functional beta3-adrenoceptors are present in the guinea-pig ileum and that the relaxations of these agonists are mainly mediated via beta3-adrenoceptors in this tissue. The differential antagonistic potency of (+/-)-bupranolol may suggest that there is a species difference between the three species (guinea-pig, dog and rat) in their beta3-adrenoceptors.", 
    "124": "1. The potency of the beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol was measured as an inhibitor of responses to isoprenaline in guinea-pig left atria. Measurements were made in two ways, firstly, by pre-incubating the atria with a given concentration of atenolol followed by an isoprenaline dose-response curve and, secondly, by measuring the response to isoprenaline followed by addition of atenolol. 2. It was found that the estimation of atenolol potency as an antagonist of beta1-adrenoceptors by these two methods gave divergent results. Specifically, it was found that the isoprenaline-induced increased rate of myocardial relaxation was resistant to receptor blockade. Thus, the rate-limiting step in the relaxation response was dissociated from receptor activation and therefore, could not be used for the measurement of receptor occupancy. 3. In contrast, the positive inotropic response was very responsive to receptor occupancy. However, when atenolol was used to block a steady-state isoprenaline response, there was a complicating depression of basal inotropy after receptor blockade that obfuscated measurement of receptor blockade. 4. In general, these data indicated that the blockade of a steady-state agonist response to measure the potency of an antagonist might in some cases yield erroneous results. These studies indicate some caution in the interpretation of blockade responses in pre-contracted or pre-stimulated pharmacological preparations.", 
    "125": "Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and has been shown to be involved in spinal nociceptive processing. We previously demonstrated that intrathecal (i.t.) administration of prostaglandin (PG) E(2) and PGF(2 alpha) induced touch-evoked pain (allodynia) through the glutamatergic system by different mechanisms. In the present study, we characterized glutamate receptor subtypes and glutamate transporters involved in induction and maintenance of PGE(2)- and PGF(2 alpha)-evoked allodynia. In addition to PGE(2) and PGF(2 alpha), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), but not kainate, induced allodynia. PGE(2)- and NMDA-induced allodynia were observed in NMDA receptor epsilon 4 (NR2D) subunit knockout (GluR epsilon 4(-/-)) mice, but not in epsilon 1 (NR2A) subunit knockout (GluR epsilon 1(-/-)) mice. Conversely, PGF(2 alpha)- and AMPA-induced allodynia were observed in GluR epsilon 1(-/-) mice, but not in GluR epsilon 4(-/-) mice. The induction of allodynia by PGE(2) and NMDA was abolished by the NMDA receptor epsilon 2 (NR2B) antagonist CP-101,606 and neonatal capsaicin treatment. PGF(2 alpha)- and AMPA-induced allodynia were not affected by CP-101,606 and by neonatal capsaicin treatment. On the other hand, the glutamate transporter blocker DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate (DL-TBOA) blocked all the allodynia induced by PGE(2), PGF(2 alpha), NMDA, and AMPA. These results demonstrate that there are two pathways for induction of allodynia mediated by the glutamatergic system and suggest that the glutamate transporter is essential for the induction and maintenance of allodynia.", 
    "126": "Today, heart failure is an increasing concern in the United States. Its prognoses are poor and its treatment is a complicated endeavor, because heart failure is not a single disease state. Rather, it is a syndrome with a cyclic pathophysiology composed of multiple mechanisms. Effective case management of heart failure must address each of the many changes involved in this syndrome, and therapy must be individualized, especially because patients with heart failure often require regimens of five or more drugs. In special populations, such as the elderly and/or patients with concomitant diseases requiring added medication, polypharmacy becomes an important issue. Maintaining consistent compliance with the treatment regimen and patient education regarding symptoms of fluid retention can be critical. Currently, beta-blockers, in addition to standard therapy, are recommended as first-line treatment in mild-to-moderate heart failure. The three cases presented in this article illustrate some common scenarios encountered and clinical decisions made when beta-blockers are used in the management of heart failure.", 
    "127": "Heart failure remains a clinically challenging illness, with increasing incidence and prevalence and a high risk of mortality. The introduction of agents that interfere with the neurohormonal response to chronic left-ventricular dysfunction has resulted in improved patient outcomes. Owing to slowed disease progression and reduced mortality, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are indicated in all patients with heart failure. New data indicate that in appropriate patients, beta-blocker therapy relieves the symptoms associated with heart failure, reduces hospitalizations, and improves survival when added to standard therapy. Questions still remain regarding the ideal use of beta blockers in heart failure, and ongoing trials will attempt to clarify those points.", 
    "128": "Beta blockers have repeatedly demonstrated their therapeutic value in the treatment of a variety of diseases; as a result, multiple treatment guidelines advocate the use of beta blockers. Despite these guidelines, the use of beta blockers is remarkably low. Numerous factors that influence the trends of drug use include pharmaceutical advertisements, physician legal concerns, marketing influences, outdated therapeutic contraindications, and patient and physician demographics. Recent primary evidence from randomized clinical trials has demonstrated a significant benefit to patients with heart failure when beta-blocker therapy is added to standard therapy. To ensure proper treatment, continuing efforts must be made to provide patients with appropriate therapy that is proven to reduce the risks of mortality and morbidity.", 
    "129": "Inhalational general anesthetics have recently been shown to inhibit neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (nnAChRs) expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and in molluscan neurons. However, drug actions on these systems are not necessarily the same as those seen on native mammalian neurons. Thus, we analyzed the detailed mechanisms of action of halothane on nnAChRs using rat cortical neurons in long-term primary culture. Currents induced by applications of ACh via a U-tube system were recorded by the whole-cell, patch-clamp technique. ACh evoked two types of currents, alpha-bungarotoxin-sensitive, fast desensitizing (alpha 7-type) currents and alpha-bungarotoxin-insensitive, slowly desensitizing (alpha 4 beta 2-type) currents. Halothane suppressed alpha 4 beta 2-type currents more than alpha 7-type currents with IC(50) values of 105 and 552 microM, respectively. Halothane shifted the ACh dose-response curve for the alpha 4 beta 2-type currents in the direction of lower ACh concentrations and slowed its apparent rate of desensitization. The rate of recovery after washout from halothane block was much faster than the rate of recovery from ACh desensitization. Thus, the halothane block was not caused by receptor desensitization. Chlorisondamine, an irreversible open channel blocker for nnAChRs, caused a time-dependent block that was attenuated by halothane. These results could be accounted for by kinetic simulation based on a model in which halothane causes flickering block of open channels, as seen in muscle nAChRs. Halothane block of nnAChRs is deemed to play an important role in anesthesia via a direct action on the receptor and an indirect action to suppress transmitter release.", 
    "130": "The effects of two beta(3)-adrenergic receptor agonists, (R)-4-[4-(3-cyclopentylpropyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1H-tetrazol-1-yl]-N-[4-[2-[[2-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl]benzenesulfonamide and (R)-N-[4-[2-[[2-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl)- ethyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl]-1-(4-octylthiazol-2-yl)-5-indolinesulfonamide, on indices of metabolic and cardiovascular function were studied in anesthetized rhesus monkeys. Both compounds are potent and specific agonists at human and rhesus beta(3)-adrenergic receptors. Intravenous administration of either compound produced dose-dependent lipolysis, increase in metabolic rate, peripheral vasodilatation, and tachycardia with no effects on mean arterial pressure. The increase in heart rate in response to either compound was biphasic with an initial rapid component coincident with the evoked peripheral vasodilatation and a second more slowly developing phase contemporaneous with the evoked increase in metabolic rate. Because both compounds exhibited weak binding to and activation of rhesus beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in vitro, it was hypothesized that the increase in heart rate may be reflexogenic in origin and proximally mediated via release of endogenous norepinephrine acting at cardiac beta(1)-adrenergic receptors. This hypothesis was confirmed by determining that beta(3)-adrenergic receptor agonist-evoked tachycardia was attenuated in the presence of propranolol and in ganglion-blocked animals, under which conditions there was no reduction in the evoked vasodilatation, lipolysis, or increase in metabolic rate. It is not certain whether the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor-evoked vasodilatation is a direct effect of compounds at beta(3)-adrenergic receptors in the peripheral vasculature or is secondary to the release or generation of an endogenous vasodilator. Peripheral vasodilatation in response to beta(3)-adrenergic receptor agonist administration was not attenuated in animals administered mepyramine, indomethacin, or calcitonin gene-related peptide(8-37). These findings are consistent with a direct vasodilator effect of beta(3)-adrenergic receptor agonists.", 
    "131": "Glycine and GABA are likely co-transmitters in the spinal cord. Their possible interactions in presynaptic terminals have, however, not been investigated. We studied the effects of glycine on GABA release using superfused mouse spinal cord synaptosomes. Glycine concentration dependently elicited [(3)H]GABA release which was insensitive to strychnine or 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid, but was Na(+) dependent and sensitive to the glycine uptake blocker glycyldodecylamide. The glycine effect was external Ca(2+) independent, but was reduced when intraterminal Ca(2+) was chelated with 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetracetic acid or depleted with thapsigargin, or when vesicular storage was impaired with bafilomycin. Glycine-induced [(3)H]GABA release was prevented, in part, by blocking GABA transport. The glycine effect was halved by sarcosine, a GLYT1 substrate/inhibitor, or by amoxapine, a GLYT2 blocker, and abolished by a mixture of the two. The sensitivity to sarcosine, used as a transporter inhibitor or substrate, persisted in synaptosomes prelabelled with [(3)H]GABA in the presence of beta-alanine, excluding major gliasome involvement. To conclude, in mice spinal cord, transporters for glycine (both GLYT1 and GLYT2) and for GABA coexist on the same axon terminals. Activation of the glycine transporters elicits GABA release, partly by internal Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis and partly by transporter reversal."
