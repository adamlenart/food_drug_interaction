The renal vasodilator response to L-arginine observed in normotensive subjects (15 +/- 4% increase in effective renal plasma flow) was abolished in untreated hypertensive patients and restored only in the group treated by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. In the whole population a positive correlation between the change in effective renal plasma flow and the change in urinary cGMP was obtained. It is suggested that abnormalities of the renal nitric oxide pathway not corrected by increased availability of L-arginine and reversible only on long-term treatment by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may underlie the abnormal renal resistance observed in essential hypertension.", 
    "1": "Because considerable important information has been published since our previous review, this update concentrates on new findings with regard to cardiovascular and renal risk factors contributing to the striking morbidity and mortality of these coexisting diseases. For example, a large body of investigative data has recently emerged suggesting or delineating a pathogenic role for hyperglycemic-related glycosylation and oxidation of lipoproteins and vascular and renal tissues. Great strides have recently been made in the understanding of platelet, coagulation, lipoprotein, and endothelial abnormalities in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disease associated with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Major progress has been made in clarifying the pathophysiology of glomerulosclerosis and other processes involved in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, accumulating data surveyed in this review address new and promising pharmacological interventions that specifically address these pathophysiological mechanisms.", 
    "2": "The present study was undertaken to assess the influence of nitroprusside-induced hypotension on beta 2-adrenoceptor density. Twenty-four patients undergoing nose-septum corrections under general anesthesia were allocated randomly to a nitroprusside or control group. beta 2-Receptor density on lymphocytes was measured by binding studies using (-)125-iodocyanopindolol. Lymphocyte subpopulations B, T, Thelper, Tsuppressor, and natural killer cells were determined simultaneously by flow cytometry. Five of 12 nitroprusside-treated patients developed significant intraoperative increases of epinephrine levels (+69% versus preoperatively) which were not seen in the remaining seven patients. In these five patients, beta 2-receptor density of unfractionated lymphocytes was 26% lower (P < 0.05) on the first day after surgery compared with preoperative values. Since no changes in proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations were observed, these results are not caused by redistribution phenomena inducing a decrease of subsets with a high number of beta receptors. These findings suggest that beta 2-adrenergic responsiveness might be diminished after nitroprusside treatment in some patients.", 
    "3": "Dexmedetomidine decreases cerebral blood flow without significantly affecting cerebral oxygen consumption in anesthetized dogs. To assess the direct cerebrovascular effects of dexmedetomidine, we investigated the responses of vasomotor tone to topical application of dexmedetomidine to pial vessels in vivo, using a parietal cranial window. Forty-one dogs were anesthetized with pentobarbital. In 20 dogs, we topically applied six concentrations of dexmedetomidine solution (10(-8), 10(-7), 10(-6), 10(-5), 10(-4), 10(-3) M) and directly measured pial arterial and venous diameters. In 10 dogs, the inhibitory effects of pretreatment of pial vessels with 10(-5) M yohimbine were examined after the application of 10(-5) dexmedetomidine. In the remaining 11 dogs, the effects of 10(-3) M dexmedetomidine were evaluated in the presence of N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), glibenclamide, or propranolol. Dexmedetomidine significantly constricted pial arteries and veins in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-7) M to 10(-4) M; P < 0.05). Yohimbine blocked dexmedetomidine-induced constriction of pial vessels (both large and small arteries and large veins P < 0.0001; small veins P < 0.005). However, when the highest concentration of dexmedetomidine (10(-3) M) was administered under the window, pial vessel diameter was not significantly altered. In the presence of glibenclamide, 10(-7) and 10(-3) M dexmedetomidine induced a significant decrease in pial arterial diameter compared with 10(-7) and 10(-3) M dexmedetomidine solution alone, respectively (P < 0.05). L-NAME or propranolol did not affect the dexmedetomidine-induced constriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We randomized into two groups all patients referred to our unit who had had at least one episode of syncope or two episodes of presyncope 1 month before presentation and had a positive isuprel Tilt Table Test (TTT). Group 1 (Gr 1) received oral atenolol, and group 2 (Gr 2) received placebo medication. After a 1-month period patients were reassessed for degree of their symptoms and underwent repeated TTT. Forty-two patients were enrolled in the study. Gr 1 and Gr 2 were comparable in age (38 +/- 13 years vs 43 +/- 14 years, p = 0.216 and sex (male/female = 6:15 vs 10:11, p = 0.204). The severity of attack was similar in both groups. Eight patients in Gr 1 and six patients in Gr 2 had mitral valve prolapse (p = 0.5). No significant differences were seen in systolic blood pressure (122 +/- 17 vs 117 +/- 16 mmHg, p = 0.334), diastolic blood pressure (70 +/- 11 vs 72 +/- 11 mm Hg, p = 0.677), and heart rate (79 +/- 12 vs 79 +/- 13, p = 0.98) between the two groups. The response rates (negative TTT) after 1 month of treatment were 62% versus 5% (p = 0.0004) in the atenolol and control group, respectively. Moreover, patients who received atenolol reported feeling better compared with those who received placebo (71% vs 29%, p = 0.02). In conclusion, atenolol significantly improved symptoms of patients with vasovagal syncope.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "Carazolol is a beta1/beta2 adrenoceptor antagonist of high potency used in the treatment of hypertension. Its affinity for the beta 3-adrenoceptor was determined in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the gene of the human or the murine beta 3-adrenoceptor. Carazolol is recognized with a nanomolar affinity, which positions it among the best ligands for beta 3-adrenoceptors. The adenylyl cyclase stimulation was measured in transfected cells where carazolol acted as a full agonist on both murine and human receptor subtypes. Furthermore, in murine adipocyte-like 3T3-F442A cells, which express beta 3-adrenoceptor naturally, carazolol induced lipolysis. This compound also appeared to be a useful tool for molecular characterization of the beta 3-adrenoceptor, unlike the classical beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists, carazolol conferred an appreciable protection of receptor binding sites against inactivation by the reducing agent dithiothreitol. The major iodinated analog of carazolol retained its binding characteristics for the beta 3-adrenoceptor and remained an efficient adenylyl cyclase stimulator in cells expressing human beta 3-adrenoceptor.",

It aims at the recognition of the optimal diastolic blood pressure value (< 90, < 85 or < 80 mmHg?) in order to maximize the possible benefit of an antihypertensive therapy. In addition, the HOT study investigates whether low doses of aspirin (75 mg/day) are able to reduce the occurrence of severe cardiovascular events. In Switzerland a total of 797 patients have been enrolled in the study. Antihypertensive therapy was initiated with felodipine = Plendil (5 mg/day). This vasoelective calcium antagonist could reduce diastolic blood pressure values to < 90 or < 80 mg/Hg, respectively, in one of two or one of three patients within the first three months. In nine or six patients, respectively out of ten a reduction of diastolic blood pressure values to < 90 or < 80 mmHg was reached within one year by combination of felodipine with other antihypertensive drugs (ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and diuretics).",

    "12": "Rolipram was characterized for its emetic, behavioral, cardiovascular and pulmonary activities in dogs, to assess its systemic pharmacology and potential bronchodilatory selectivity. At doses > or = 0.1 mg/kg i.v., rolipram induced emesis, anxiety, and stepping behaviors in conscious dogs, and increased heart rate and cardiac contractility in anesthetized instrumented dogs not treated with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. Cardiovascular effects in anesthetized dogs were apparently related to rolipram's central nervous system activities, in that they were associated with a reversal pentobarbital-induced anesthesia and could be ablated by pentobarbital supplementation. Rolipram's reversal of anesthesia was confirmed in uninstrumented dogs, where rolipram shortened pentobarbital sleep time while increasing heart and respiratory rates. After intragastric administration, rolipram exhibited greater emetic potency (100% emesis at 0.1 mg/kg p.o.) and lesser bronchodilatory potency (ED50 = 0.04 mg/kg i.d.) than after i.v. administration. The data demonstrate that rolipram is a potent bronchodilator that produces central nervous system effects only at higher doses when administered i.v. to the dog. Administered intragastrically, however, the bronchodilatory selectivity of rolipram is reduced presumably as a result of the activation of emetic reflexes at sites within the gastrointestinal tract.", 
    "13": "Ion-pair chromatography (IPC) and micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC) were used for the separation and determination of parent beta-blockers from human biological fluids. In both these techniques, N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was used as a buffer additive. In IPC, CTAB was an ion-pair former, and in MECC it was a micelle-forming surfactant. The effectiveness of the IPC method using methanol-gradient elution and that of MECC were compared for drug-spiked serum and urine samples. Detection was performed with a diode-array detector in the IPC method and with a 214-nm filter in the MECC technique. In both methods a phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was used. In MECC the buffer solution contained 10 mM CTAB, while in IPC the CTAB concentration was decreased from 7 to 4 mM during the separation when a methanol gradient was used. The study showed that the IPC technique performed better for bioanalyses than the high-performance MECC technique, since in MECC UV detection presented a problem because of the low sample concentration. However, in MECC sample preparation was less time-consuming, using hydrolyzation and protein precipitation and, unlike the IPC technique, it did not require any liquid-liquid extraction step.", 
    "14": "The purpose of the present study was to develop an approach to directly monitor structural changes in a G protein-coupled receptor in response to drug binding. Purified human beta 2 adrenergic receptor was covalently labeled with the cysteine-reactive, fluorescent probe N,N'-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N'-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4- yl)ethylenediamine (IANBD). IANBD is characterized by a fluorescence which is highly sensitive to the polarity of its environment. We found that the full agonist, isoproterenol, elicited a stereoselective and dose-dependent decrease in fluorescence from IANBD-labeled beta 2 receptor. The change in fluorescence could be plotted against the concentration of isoproterenol as a simple hyperbolic binding isotherm demonstrating interaction with a single binding site in the receptor. The ability of several adrenergic antagonists to reverse the response confirmed that this binding site is identical to the well described binding site in the beta 2 receptor. Comparison of the response to isoproterenol with a series of adrenergic agonists, having different biological efficacies, revealed a linear correlation between biological efficacy and the change in fluorescence. This suggests that the agonist-mediated decrease in fluorescence from IANBD-labeled beta 2 receptor is due to the same conformational change as involved in receptor activation and G protein coupling. In contrast to agonists, negative antagonists induced a small but significant increase in base-line fluorescence. Despite the small amplitude of this response, it supports the notion that antagonists by themselves may alter receptor structure. In conclusion, our data provide the first direct evidence for ligand-specific conformational changes occurring in a G protein-coupled receptor. Furthermore, the data demonstrate the potential of fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool for further delineating the molecular mechanisms of drug action at G protein-coupled receptors.",

    "23": "We reported earlier the presence of a 40 kDa plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein (FABPpm) in human placenta. This protein is thought to be involved in the sequestration of unesterified free fatty acids bound to albumin from the maternal plasma for delivery to the fetus. However, its location in human placental syncytiotrophoblasts is not known. These cells are bipolar; one side facing maternal circulation (microvillous membranes), and the other side facing fetal circulation (basal membranes). Therefore, it is important to resolve the location of this protein in trophoblast membranes in order to understand fatty acid transport and metabolism in human placenta. Isolated plasma membranes vesicles were prepared respectively from the maternal facing microvillous and fetal facing surface of the human full-term placental syncytiotrophoblast. Using these membrane preparations, fatty acid binding activity, the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis radiobinding assay for FABPpm, and Western blot analysis of FABPpm were carried out to determine the location of this protein in these membranes. Based on the above studies we conclude that the FABPpm is located exclusively in the microvillous membranes. Since FABPpm may be responsible for FFA uptake, its location in the microvillous membranes favours the unidirectional flow of maternal FFA to the fetus.",

    "25": "Ventricular fibrillation induced in animals pretreated with sotalol, a class III antiarrhythmic agent, would spontaneously terminate and revert into a sinus rhythm. This phenomenon has been attributed to the class III action of this drug, i.e., prolongation of myocardial action potential duration and effective refractory period. Since various observations suggested that these alone cannot explain the defibrillating phenomenon, we hypothesised that sotalol affected ventricular intercellular synchronization by increasing intercellular coupling. Our recent experimental studies have shown that sotalol antagonized the cellular decoupling to guinea pig ventricular muscle strip caused by perfusion with either a hypoxic normal Tyrode's solution or an oxygenated high Ca2+ Tyrode's solution. We assumed that the most likely mechanism for the restoration of intercellular coupling would be increasing intracellular cAMP concentration. In order to test this hypothesis, we studied the modification of this sotalol-induced recoupling by a cAMP dependent protein kinase inhibitor. The results clearly supported our assumption since the addition of Arg-Gly-Tyr-Ala-Leu- Gly (pure A- kinase inhibitor) prevented the aforementioned cellular recoupling action of sotalol in a dose-dependent manner. It can thus be concluded that changes in intracellular cAMP level are involved in the synchronizing / defibrillating effect of sotalol.", 
    "26": "A specific and sensitive gas chromatographic-high-resolution mass spectrometric method for the determination of 5-(3-tert.-butylamino-2-hydroxy)propoxy-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril (carteolol), which is a beta-blocker giving depression of intraocular pressure, was developed to elucidate the pharmacokinetics of its ophthalmic application. Carteolol has been determined by high-performance liquid chromatography but with less satisfactory sensitivity. Carteolol was derivatized with pentafluorobenzoyl (PFB) amide followed by dimethylethylsilyl (DMES) ether, resulting in a high negative-ion current. The PFB-DMES derivative of carteolol was determined by the gas chromatography-negative-ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (GC-NICI-MS) using selected-ion monitoring at low and high mass spectrometric resolution. the detection limit was less than 100 fg when the fragment ion was monitored at m/z 552.2067 in the NICI mode using methane as a reagent gas. The quantification limit of carteolol in human plasma with this method was less than 30 pg/ml. The proposed GC-MS method is considered to have sufficient specificity and sensitivity to study the pharmacokinetics of carteolol used as an ophthalmic solution.", 
    "27": "1. alpha 1-Adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of the beta-adrenoceptor-dependent Cl- current was investigated in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes using the patch clamp technique. The Cl- conductance activated by noradrenaline (0.1-10 microM) with an alpha 1-blocker (prazosin, 5 microM) was significantly greater than that activated by noradrenaline alone. Phenylephrine and methoxamine, alpha 1-agonists, exerted an inhibitory effect on the Cl- conductance activated by isoprenaline. The dose-response relationship for isoprenaline and the Cl- current activation was shifted to higher doses in the presence of phenylephrine (30 microM). 2. The interaction of alpha 1- and beta-agonists on Cl- current was also observed on the single channel level; in some of the outside-out membrane patches, phenylephrine (50 microM) depressed the activity of the single Cl- channel which was induced by 5 microM adrenaline. 3. Phenylephrine had no effect on the Cl- conductance induced by forskolin (0.5-5 microM), an activator of adenylate cyclase. The Cl- conductance activated persistently by isoprenaline in GTP gamma S-loaded cells was also insensitive to phenylephrine. The results suggest that the observed alpha 1-adrenergic attenuation of the beta-adrenergic response is not primarily due to inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. The alpha 1-adrenergic action may interfere with the processes leading to enzyme activation in the beta-adrenergic pathway.",

Its vasopressor effect by which it increases coronary perfusion pressure is likely to favor initial resuscitation. Its beta-adrenergic action, however, may have detrimental effects on postresuscitation myocardial function when administered before resuscitation because it increases myocardial oxygen consumption. In the present study, our focus was on postresuscitation effects of epinephrine when this adrenergic agent was administered during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Postresuscitation myocardial functions were compared with those of a selective alpha-adrenergic agent, phenylephrine, when epinephrine was combined with a beta 1-adrenergic blocking agent, esmolol, and saline placebo.",

Mechanical ventilation and precordial compression was initiated either 4 or 8 minutes after the start of ventricular fibrillation.

Left ventricular pressure, dP/dt40, and negative dP/dt were continuously measured for an interval of 240 minutes after successful cardiac resuscitation. Except for saline placebo, comparable increases in coronary perfusion pressure were observed after each drug intervention. The number of countershocks required for restoration of spontaneous circulation was significantly greater for epinephrine-treated animals (10 +/- 8) when compared with phenylephrine-treated animals (1.8 +/- 0.4, P < .01) and with animals treated with epinephrine combined with esmolol (1.6 +/- 0.9, P < .01). After resuscitation, dP/dt40 and negative dP/dt were significantly decreased and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly increased in each animal when compared with prearrest levels. However, the greatest impairment followed epinephrine, and this was associated with significantly greater heart rate and the shortest interval of postresuscitation survival of 8 +/- 4 hours, whereas placebo controls survived for 12 +/- 11 hours. Phenylephrine-treated animals survived for 41 +/- 10 hours (P < .01 versus epinephrine), and animals that received a combination of epinephrine and esmolol survived for 35 +/- 11 hours (P < .01 versus epinephrine).

Average compliance rates approximated 100%, although considerable variability within and between subjects was observed. Using an arbitrary limit to classify patients as compliers or noncompliers, the following frequencies of noncompliance were observed during the study year: cyclosporine, 23%; azathioprine, 13%; prednisone, 23%; atenolol, 36%; and nifedipine, 32%. Average compliance scores for all immunosuppressive drugs were superior to those of antihypertensive medication (P < 0.001). Except for a better compliance for prednisone in men as compared with women, we found no consistent relationship between compliance on the one hand and several demographic variables, graft function, or quality of life on the other hand. Patients who developed one or more acute rejection episodes showed a higher degree of undercompliance, especially for prednisone, than patients without rejections (P < 0.01). Following the occurrence of a rejection episode, compliance scores improved significantly. Keeping in mind the limitations of the pill count method, we conclude that noncompliance with immunosuppressive drugs is not a huge problem during the first year after renal transplantation. However, it is likely that noncompliance contributes to a certain number of acute rejection episodes.", 
    "43": "Nipradilol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with vasodilator activity, has a structure which contains a NO2 group. In anesthetized dogs, the time course of the systemic vasodilation and plasma nitrite (NO2-) concentration was studied following intravenous administration of nipradilol (1 mg/kg). A fall in systemic vascular resistance was observed at 1 min, which was rapidly followed by a significant increase in the plasma NO2- concentration. It is indicated that nipradilol exerts systemic vasodilatation via nitric oxide (NO) release in vivo.", 
    "44": "The rat Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and steady-state and transient currents were measured using a two-electrode voltage clamp. The maximal glucose induced Na(+)-dependent inward current was approximately 300-500 nA. The apparent affinity constants for sugar (alpha-methyl-D-glucopyranoside; alpha MDG) (K alpha MDG 0.5) and sodium (KNa0.5) at a membrane potential of -150 mV were 0.2 mM and 4 mM. The KNa0.5 increased continuously with depolarizing potentials reaching 40 mM at -30 mV, K alpha MDG 0.5 was steeply voltage dependent, 0.46 mM at -30 mV and 1 mM at -10 mV. From all tested monovalent cations only Li+ could substitute for Na+, but with lower affinity. The relative substrate specificity was D-glucose > alpha MDG approximately D-galactose > 3-O-Me-Glc > beta-naphthyl-D-glucoside > uridine. Phlorizin (Pz), the specific blocker of sugar transport, showed an extremely high affinity for the rat cotransporter with an inhibitor constant (KPzi) of 12 nM. SGLT1 charge movements in the absence of sugar were fitted by the Boltzmann equation with an apparent valence of the movable charge of approximately 1, a potential for 50% maximal charge transfer (V0.5) of -43 mV, and a maximal charge (Qmax) of 9 nanocoulombs. The apparent turnover number for the rat SGLT1 was 30 s-1. Model simulations showed that the kinetics of the rat SGLT1 are described by a six-state ordered nonrapid equilibrium model, and comparison of the kinetics of the rat, rabbit and human cotransporters indicate that they differ mainly in their presteady-state kinetic parameters.", 
    "45": "Chronic heart failure is the leading cause of hospital admissions in patients older than 65 years. Heart failure due to systolic dysfunction is accompanied by activation of the sympathetic nervous system that contributes to progressive symptoms and an increased risk of death. While several clinical trials have suggested that antagonizing this sympathetic activation with beta-blocking agents may provide clinical benefit, no clear consensus exists regarding use of beta-blockers for congestive heart failure. Therefore, we review the pathophysiology of the sympathetic nervous system as a basis for examining these clinical trials in order to understand the rationale for beta-blockade as a treatment for heart failure.",

    "48": "Sympathetic nervous system activation in patients with chronic heart failure is a major contributor to the severity of disease as well as its progression over time. Antagonism of its effects, via beta-blocker therapy, appears overall to improve both quality of life and survival. However, its place as a cornerstone in the therapy of this disease depends on the results of large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.", 
    "49": "The effects on vagally-induced gastric contractions of local electrical stimulation of the gastric sympathetic nerves were investigated in anaesthetised cats. Sympathetic stimulation caused an inhibition of vagally mediated gastric contractions which survived beta-adrenoceptor blockade and could not be mimicked by the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. We therefore concluded that the inhibition was not predominantly dependent upon activation of alpha or beta adrenoceptors, although some effect attributable to noradrenaline could not be entirely excluded. In an attempt to determine the mechanism of this phenomenon, we administered exogenous neuropeptide Y (NPY) and galanin (GAL), both of which are known to occur as cotransmitters in some sympathetic nerves in the cat. Both NPY and GAL were able to mimic the effect of sympathetic stimulation on vagally-induced gastric contractions but their effects were variable.", 
    "50": "The present study examined the role of the sympathetic nervous system as a mediator of the message from the CNS to the kidneys to stimulate the secretion of renin. Two procedures that increase the secretion of renin were tested: administration of the serotonin releaser fenfluramine, which increases renin release without altering blood pressure [53], and subjecting the rats to the 'psychological' stressor of conditioned emotional response (CER) stress. Pretreatment of rats with either the beta antagonist sotalol or the beta 1-selective antagonist atenolol completely prevented the increase in plasma renin activity and concentration caused by fenfluramine (5 mg/kg i.p.) injection. However, chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) combined with surgical adrenal medullectomy did not prevent the increase in plasma renin activity and concentration following fenfluramine injection. Since beta-antagonists have been previously shown to prevent the renin response to CER stress, we also tested whether the sympathetic nervous system mediates the renin response to CER stress. Chemical sympathectomy combined with adrenal medullectomy did not prevent the effect of CER stress on renin release. The completeness of the sympathectomy/adrenal medullectomy was verified biochemically by measuring plasma epinephrine and both plasma and renal norepinephrine concentrations. Plasma epinephrine and renal norepinephrine levels were reduced to below 1% of control while plasma norepinephrine was reduced to below 8% of control values. In conclusion, our data support previous reports suggesting that activation of CNS pathways increases the secretion of renin. However, the message from the brain to release renin from the kidneys does not exclusively involve either the sympathetic innervation of the kidneys or adrenal epinephrine. Although beta 1 receptors are involved in mediating this phenomenon, their location or mechanism remains unknown and will be discussed.", 
    "51": "The application of cost-effectiveness methodology is particularly important in widespread diseases such as hypertension. However, because prospective cost-effectiveness analyses comparing different antihypertensive drugs are not currently available, differences in the cost effectiveness of these drugs can only be estimated. The purpose of this review is to estimate and compare the costs of drug therapy with selective and nonselective beta adrenoceptor antagonists in hypertension. The global costs of antihypertensive treatment are largely determined by drug costs. In most countries, drug costs do not appear to vary substantially between beta 1-selective and nonselective beta-blockers. The adverse sequelae of hypertension include stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy and renal failure. There are no obvious differences in effect on stroke and cardiac hypertrophy between beta 1-selective and nonselective beta-blockers. However, compared with beta 1-selective antagonists, nonselective drugs might be less effective in preventing myocardial infarction in smokers and may impair renal function in patients with both increased peripheral resistance and declining cardiac output. There is a clear difference between beta 1-selective and nonselective beta-blockers on quality-of-life (QOL) perception. During treatment with nonselective beta-blockers, QOL perception is lower than during treatment with beta 1-selective drugs. Preservation of quality of life during long term antihypertensive treatment deserves considerable weight in economic analyses. Consequently, the more favourable effects of beta 1-selective agents on quality of life may outweigh the possible higher costs of these drugs, and suggest that beta 1-selective agents may be more cost effective than nonselective beta-blockers.", 
    "52": "Neuropeptides such as gastrin releasing peptide and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) stimulate CCK secretion from CCK producing cells. We hypothesized that in addition to somatostatin, galanin may also play an inhibitory role on CCK secretion. The effect of galanin on CCK secretion was studied in a CCK-producing murine neuroendocrine tumor cell line, STC-1. Galanin below 10 nM did not affect basal CCK secretion but dose- and time-dependently inhibited KCl-stimulated CCK secretion. Galanin also inhibited forskolin-, bombesin- and PACAP- but not dibutyryl cAMP- or beta-TPA-stimulated CCK secretion. The inhibitory effect of galanin was reduced partially by a blocker of ATP-sensitive K+ channel (K+ ATP), glibenclamide, and prevented by pretreatment of the cells with PTX. The results indicated galanin regulates CCK secretion by modulation of K+ ATP and cAMP production through receptors coupled to a PTX-sensitive G protein.",

    "56": "Of 193 patients at 16 centres, 111 had echocardiograms that could be quantitatively evaluated. The primary analysis of the study was performed using data from those patients. In addition, echocardiograms of 88 patients were analysed on an 'according to protocol' basis (patients with preset values of left ventricular mass). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced both by ramipril and by atenolol without any significant difference between the two drug treatments. The heart rate was significantly reduced by atenolol only. Both the 'primary' and the 'according to protocol' analyses showed that the left ventricular mass was significantly reduced by ramipril only. Comparison between treatments according to a multivariate analysis demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in left ventricular mass during ramipril than during atenolol treatment.", 
    "57": "The present study is the first of suitably large size in which a direct comparison of the effects of an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker on echocardiographic left ventricular mass has been performed. It has demonstrated that ramipril is more effective than atenolol in reversing left ventricular hypertrophy in essential hypertensive patients.", 
    "58": "Responses (473) were collated from a questionnaire sent to 5054 veterinarians in Australia enquiring about drug preferences for treating cardiac disease in dogs and cats. When treating a small breed dog with endocardiosis and mild left congestive heart failure, 74% of 472 respondents used a diuretic, 67% a theophylline derivative, 27% a vasodilator and 20% a positive inotrope. Frusemide was the preferred diuretic and digoxin the preferred inotrope, but vasodilator use varied. Low sodium diets were \"often recommended\" by 71% of respondents. Propranolol was preferred to diltiazem for treating feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Digoxin was clearly preferred for treating supraventricular dysrhythmias, while lignocaine and digoxin were preferred equally for ventricular dysrhythmias. Respondents appeared more willing than US veterinarians to use theophylline derivatives and prasozin, and less inclined to employ nitrates, hydralazine, inotropes other than digoxin, and low sodium diets.", 
    "59": "The hyperventilation syndrome (HVS) can be regarded as a form of panic disorder associated with a relative increase in sympathomimetic tone, the effects of which can be counterbalanced by beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The efficacy of the beta-blocker bisoprolol was investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomised crossover trial involving 60 patients from 17 general practices. Following a single-blind placebo prephase, patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomised to treatment with either 5 mg bisoprolol or an identical-looking placebo tablet once daily for three weeks. They were then crossed over to the other treatment arm. At the end of each treatment phase the number of hyperventilation attacks and the severity of symptoms were assessed and side effects recorded. The number of attacks decreased from 4.04 per week at baseline to 3.52 with placebo and to 1.26 with bisoprolol. The decrease of attacks with bisoprolol was significant (p < 0.05) compared to baseline and placebo. The severity of the complaints improved from 29 (scale 0 to 64) at baseline not significantly to 26 with placebo and significantly (p < 0.05) to 15 with bisoprolol. No serious side effects were reported. Five milligrams of bisoprolol once daily is effective and safe in the maintenance of symptom reduction in patients with the hyperventilation syndrome.", 
    "60": "Intravenous verapamil was given to two haemodynamically stable patients with persistent atrial tachycardia, resulting in circulatory arrest requiring CPR in one and collapse with unrecordable blood pressure in the other. Both responded to resuscitation and tachycardia was subsequently controlled with propranolol in one and sotalol in the other. Factors contributing to the cardiovascular collapse included: (i) left ventricular dysfunction; and (ii) failure to convert the tachycardia to sinus rhythm. It was concluded that verapamil may be dangerous in supraventricular tachycardia not due to atrioventricular (AV) junctional re-entry, despite normal blood pressure and perfusion, particularly if left ventricular dysfunction were present. If the diagnosis of AV junctional re-entry is in doubt, adenosine is preferable as it is less likely to cause haemodynamic collapse and will assist in making the diagnosis.", 
    "61": "The efficacy of d/l sotalol was investigated in 50 patients (43 men, seven women; 33 with coronary artery disease, 15 with dilated cardiomyopathy; ejection fraction 33 +/- 10%) with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia. Before d/l sotalol a mean of 2 +/- 1 (1 to 4) class I antiarrhythmic drugs were ineffective. In 24 patients (48%) oral d/l sotalol (320 +/- 47 mg.day-1) prevented induction of the ventricular tachycardia; in 23 patients the ventricular tachycardia remained inducible (d/l sotalol 326 +/- 50 mg.day-1). The electrophysiological effects of d/l sotalol did not differ between patients in whom d/l sotalol prevented induction of ventricular tachycardia and those in whom the ventricular tachycardia remained inducible. In two patients, torsade des pointes developed after oral application of d/l sotalol; one patient suffered from severe hypotension even with 80 mg of sotalol per day. During long-term follow-up (27 +/- 12 months) 5/24 patients (21%) had a non-fatal recurrence of ventricular tachycardia (1 week to 21 months), one patient died suddenly and another from progressive heart failure. In patients in whom the ventricular tachycardia could be induced despite oral application of d/l sotalol, control of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia was attempted by the use of sotalol in combination with mexiletine (n = 2), amiodarone (n = 9), catheter ablation (n = 2), antitachycardia surgery (n = 1) or the implantation of an automatic cardioverter defibrillator (n = 12). Recurrence of ventricular tachycardia was observed in four patients without an implanted cardioverter defibrillator. Seven out of 12 patients with an implanted cardioverter defibrillator received appropriate shocks or successful antitachycardia pacing. Although no patient died suddenly, overall mortality was 17% in this group. It is concluded that d/l sotalol is highly effective in the suppression of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia inducible by programmed electrical stimulation. However during a mean follow-up of 27 +/- 12 months a recurrence of ventricular tachycardia was seen in 21% of patients, and one patient died suddenly.", 
    "62": "The additional efficacy, duration of action and tolerability of felodipine were evaluated in patients with stable angina pectoris and a positive stress test who were already receiving therapy with a beta-adrenergic blocker. One hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with 5-10 mg felodipine once daily or matching placebo, and were evaluated by serial exercise testing during 12 weeks of treatment. Felodipine at 4 h significantly increased exercise duration assessed after 4 weeks of treatment (increase 34 +/- 65 s vs 18 +/- 71 s in placebo-treated patients; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.11; P = 0.01), and after 12 weeks of treatment (increase 39 +/- 103 s vs 3 +/- 72 s; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.16; P = 0.02). The time until onset of exercise-induced anginal pain and time until 1 mm ST depression assessed after 4 weeks of treatment also increased significantly with felodipine compared to placebo. No statistically significant changes in exercise test parameters evaluated 24 h after medication were observed. The addition of felodipine once daily demonstrated a sustained improvement in exercise duration in patients symptomatic despite treatment with a beta-blocker evaluated 4 h after drug intake. At 24 h post dose, no statistically significant effect was observed. Felodipine is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects and no adverse effect on quality of life.", 
    "63": "Histamine (HA) and isoprenaline (ISO) strongly stimulated cAMP formation in chick cerebral cortical slices. The effects of HA and ISO were selectively antagonized by HA H2-receptor blockers (aminopotentidine, ranitidine) and beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol, respectively. The combination of HA (0.1-100 microM) and ISO (0.1-10 microM) produced some additive effects when the drugs were used at low concentrations, i.e. 0.1-1 microM but not when HA was applied at 10 or 100 microM doses (which evoked nearly maximal effect). It is suggested that HA H2-like receptors and beta-adrenoceptors (whose activation leads to stimulation of cAMP formation) are localized in the same subpopulation of cortical cells, in which they probably utilize a common and limited pool of cAMP-generating system.", 
    "64": "The influence of CGP 37849, a competitive antagonist of NMDA, receptors and desipramine (DMI) on the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in rats exposed to the forced swimming test was investigated. CGP 37849 (10 mg/kg) and DMI (15 mg/kg), given twice to rats (24 h apart), or the forced swimming test alone failed to alter the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in the rat cortex, as tested using [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA). However, in rats injected with CGP 37849 (10 mg/kg) or DMI (15 mg/kg) and exposed to the forced swimming test, it was found that the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in the cortex was decreased. It was also observed that CGP 37849 used in a dose which decreased the density of beta-adrenergic receptors reduced the immobility time in a manner similar to DMI. It is concluded that CGP 37849 may evoke similar adaptive receptor changes as anti-depressant drugs which-in turn-suggests antidepressant-like properties of CGP 37849.", 
    "65": "A case is presented of a 30-year old man with long-term history of painful muscle cramps, episodes of tetany, general malaise and persistent hypokaliemia. On the ground of clinical appearance and biochemical data the Bartter's syndrome in Gitelman's variant was diagnosed. In differential diagnosis we considered renal tubular acidosis, other tubular defects (Liddle's syndrome), primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Other possible causes of hypokaliemia were excluded such as surreptitious diuretic and lexative abuse, persistent vomiting and diarrhea. Good therapeutic effect were achieve using spironolacton, indomethacin, propranolol and potassium supplementation.", 
    "66": "The mechanisms of the positive inotropic action of a new synthetic tetrahydroisoquinoline compound, SL-1, were investigated in isolated rat cardiac tissues and ventricular myocytes. SL-1 produced a rapidly developing, concentration-dependent positive inotropic response in both atrial and ventricular muscles and a negative chronotropic effect in spontaneously beating right atria. The positive inotropic effect was not prevented by pretreatment with reserpine (3 mg/kg) or the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (1 microM), but was suppressed by either the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (3 microM) or the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 1mM). In the whole-cell recording study, SL-1 increased the plateau level and prolonged the action potential duration in a concentration-dependent manner and decreased the maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) and amplitude of the action potential in isolated rat ventricular myocytes stimulated at 1.0 Hz. On the other hand, SL-1 had little effect on the resting membrane potential, although it caused a slight decrease at higher concentrations. Voltage clamp experiments revealed that the increase of action potential plateau and prolongation of action potential duration were associated with an increase of Ca2+ inward current (ICa) via the activation of beta-adrenoceptors and a prominent inhibition of 4AP-sensitive transient outward K+ current (Ito) with an IC50 of 3.9 microM. Currents through the inward rectifier K+ channel (IK1) were also reduced. The inhibition of Ito is characterized by a reduction in peak amplitude and a marked acceleration of current decay but without changes on the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. In addition to the inhibition of K+ currents, SL-1 also inhibited the Na+ inward current (INa) with an IC50 of 5.4 microM, which was correlated with the decrease of Vmax. We conclude that the positive inotropic effect of SL-1 may be due to an increase in Ca2+ current mediated via partial activation of beta-adrenoceptors and an inhibition of K+ outward currents and the subsequent prolongation of action potentials.", 
    "67": "A simple, rapid, and sensitive fluorimetric-high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of propranolol in human serum/plasma has been developed, without the need for solvent extraction. The procedure required 200 microliters of serum/plasma, and the addition of 1 ml of acetonitrile for protein precipitation followed by vortexing and centrifugation at 10 000 g. The clear supernatant was evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen at 50-60 degrees C, the residue was reconstituted in 100 microliters of methanol, and a 90 microliters portion was injected onto the high-performance liquid chromatograph for propranolol quantitation. Chromatography was accomplished using a Hypersil cyano column, a mobile phase of acetonitrile-aqueous acetic acid (1%) containing 0.2% triethylamine (35:65, v/v) (pH 3.6), a flow rate of 1.5 ml min-1, a fluorescence detector set at an excitation wavelength of 230 nm and an emission wavelength of 340 nm, and using pronethalol as the internal standard. Retention times for pronethalol and propranolol were 7.5 min and 9.5 min, respectively. Standard curves were linear in the range 5-200 ng ml-1. Relative standard deviations for both inter-day and intra-day precision analysis were less than 7% for serum. No interference was observed from endogenous serum/plasma components. Specificity was shown for some, but not all, commonly coadministered drugs tested. The advantages of this method include good precision, low sample volume, good reproducibility and recovery, and high sensitivity.", 
    "68": "Direct separation of enantiomers of denopamine was investigated by two separation methods. One is capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) using cyclodextrins (CDs) (CD-CZE) and the other is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using CD immobilized chiral stationary phases (CD-CSPs). Enantiomers of denopamine were successfully resolved by employing heptakis (2,6-di-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (DM-beta-CD) and acetyl-beta-cyclodextrin (AC-beta-CD), and partially resolved with heptakis(2,3,6-tri-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (TM-beta-CD), hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) and beta-CD polymer under acidic conditions. Separation of enantiomers of denopamine by HPLC was also successful with one of the CD-CSPs, where perphenylated beta-CD (Ph beta-CD) was immobilized. In CD-CZE, some polymeric additives, such as hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose (HPMC) and polyvinylalcohol (PVA), and a coated capillary were used to improve the enantioseparation of denopamine. Method validations such as linearity, recovery and repeatability, etc., were investigated for HPLC, and the method was applied to the optical purity testing of the drug substances and in tablet form.",

    "70": "The effects of regional hypoxemia and ischemia on epicardial electrogram were studied in anesthetized, open-chest dogs. The left circumflex artery (LCx) was cannulated and perfused with either arterial blood or hypoxic solution. A contact electrode for recording monophasic action potential (MAP) was applied to the epicardial site of the LCx area. Epicardial electrograms and MAP in the LCx perfusion territory were recorded 1) just before and at the end of a 2-min coronary occlusion (ischemia) and 2) just before and at the end of a 2-min perfusion of hypoxic solution (hypoxemia). The activation-recovery interval (ARI), defined as an interval from the minimum derivative of the QRS complex to the maximum derivative of the T-wave in the unipolar electrogram, changed linearly with MAP duration during above interventions. The ARI decreased by 29% from 189 +/- 14 to 134 +/- 30 ms during ischemia (p < .001), and it increased by 39% from 183 +/- 11 to 254 +/- 31 ms during hypoxemia (p < .001). Hypoxemia produced a giant negative T-wave whose pattern was not modified by pretreatments with autonomic nerve blockers (propranolol and atropine), a Ca2+ channel blocker (verapamil), an ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP blocker (5-hydroxydecanoate or transient outward K+ current (I(to) blocker (4-aminopyridine). Isoproterenol, forskolin or aminophylline inhibited both the appearances of giant negative T and the ARI prolongation. Accordingly, unlike ischemia, hypoxemia prolongs repolarization process and this prolongation is inhibited by the augmentation of intracellular cyclic AMP.", 
    "71": "The short- and long-term effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril and the cardioselective beta-blocker bisoprolol on serum lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) levels were investigated in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Fifty-two patients completed the 12-month, randomized, multicenter trial. After administration of lisinopril (10 to 20 mg/d; n = 24) and bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg/d; n = 28), systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly (P < 0.01) from baseline in both groups at 3, 6, and 12 months. The reduction in diastolic blood pressure was significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the lisinopril group than in the bisoprolol group only at 6 months. Heart rates dropped significantly in the bisoprolol group but not in the lisinopril group. No significant changes in lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, or Lp(a) levels were observed with either drug at 3, 6, or 12 months, and no significant differences were noted between the two drugs for these parameters. We conclude that lisinopril and bisoprolol are effective as antihypertensive drugs without adverse metabolic effects after short- and long-term treatment in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.",

    "73": "Basal and electrical stimulation-induced release of tritiated norepinephrine (3H-NE) was determined in superfused slices of the rat hypothalamus and hippocampus. Isoproterenol (0.1-10 nM), a nonselective beta-adrenergic agonist, enhanced stimulation-evoked release of 3H-NE from hypothalamic and hippocampal slices in a concentration-dependent manner without consistently altering basal release. Isoproterenol (1 nM) increased ratios of S2/S1 to 143 +/- 4% (hypothalamus) and 152 +/- 15% (hippocampus) of control values. The facilitatory effects of isoproterenol were antagonized by propranolol (50 nM), a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist. The beta 2-selective adrenergic agonist clenbuterol (10-100 microM) enhanced basal release of 3H-NE in a concentration-dependent fashion. These results provide evidence for a beta-adrenergic receptor mediated regulation of NE release from hypothalamic and hippocampal slices. Whether the positive feedback mechanism contributes to any of the NE-mediated physiological functions associated with the hypothalamus and hippocampus requires further study. However, the effect of clenbuterol indicates that some of its behavioral actions in animals may be attributed to this NE release-enhancing effect observed in the present study.", 
    "74": "We studied one hundred consecutive patients, under the age of 55 years (mean age: 45.6 years), with myocardial infarction and a Q wave, in order to assess the prognostic value of an early stress test. Thirty five patients were excluded: 2 deaths, 21 revascularizations during the acute phase, 4 tests were performed without treatment, 6 tests were unable to be performed and 2 patients left hospital against medical advice. Sixty five patients [males, n = 60 (92.2%), anterior infarction, n = 25 (38.5%), thrombolysed n = 35 (53.8%), intact left ventricular ejection fraction (mean: 54.7%)] systematically underwent a stress test limited by symptoms, in hospital, on the tenth day of infarction, using an ergometric bicycle and under medical treatment (including beta blockers n = 47 (72.2%)] and cardiac catheterization. The test was considered positive when it was accompanied by angina and/or ST depression (n = 19), negative in the absence of these criteria for a level of 120 watts (n = 23), inadequate when the duration was less than 9 minutes and when the heart rate was less than or equal to 70% of the theoretical maximal heart rate (n = 11), doubtful when there was accentuation of ST elevation in the infarcted territory with mirror ST depression (n = 12). Only 30.7% of patients had multi-vessel coronary lesions (two- and three-vessel disease). The mortality was 4.6% with a mean follow-up of 27.4 months (range: 3-38). The sensitivity of the test for detection of multi-vessel disease was 62.5%, the specificity was 65.3%, the positive predictive value was 52.6%, and the negative predictive value was 73.9%. The sensitivity of this test, with beta-blocker treatment, to predict coronary lesions or cardiac events, fell to 33.3% and 37.5%, respectively. The stress test during the post-infarction period, with beta-blocker treatment, appears to be less sensitive for the identification of multivessel disease and cardiac events: this treatment should therefore be suspended before performing this test when allowed by the patient's clinical state.",

However, recent reports suggest that cancer occurs with a higher frequency than expected and is more aggressive in this disease. We report six patients with hyperthyroidism due to a Basedow Graves disease that presented a palpable thyroid nodule, which was cold in the scintiscan and solid in the ultrasound examination. Fine needle cytology disclosed cancer in five cases (two with cytological features of greater aggressiveness) and a nodular hyperplasia in one. The diagnosis was confirmed in the surgical piece in all patients. We conclude that Basedow-Graves disease and thyroid cancer, which can have an increased aggressiveness, may coexist.", 
    "76": "Heart rate is an important physiological variable in the control of cardiac output, even in fishes, where the importance of stroke volume has been overemphasized. Except for the myxinoids, the fish heart is innervated by cranial nerve X and the nature of this innervation is mainly inhibitory by parasympathetic fibers, although a sympathetic contribution has also been demonstrated. In mammals, cardiac innervation is not only responsible for the control of mean heart rate but it also modulates the beat-to-beat heart rate changes. These beat-to-beat changes are known as heart rate variability (HRV) and appear to be related to fluctuations in respiration and blood pressure. In this paper we demonstrate the link between cardiac innervation and HRV in several species of teleosts because HRV is greatly decreased after vagotomy or atropinization. In contrast, after abolishing the sympathetic influence with propranolol, only slight changes in total HRV are observed, indicating the restricted importance of the adrenergic innervation in determining phasic changes in HRV despite the significant tonic effect which has been demonstrated. Thus, it appears unlikely that the sympathetic influence will be present in any measured spectral component as suggested previously. Furthermore, clear spectral patterns do not always exist and this may be due to the erratic influence of respiration which is clearly faster than heart rate in all fish species studied. This differs from the slow ventilation frequency displayed by many mammalian species that exerts an influence on a beat-to-beat basis (respiratory sinus arrhythmia). Spectral patterns could also be affected by changing levels of circulating catecholamines, although this is still unproved.", 
    "77": "The authors present a review of their contributions over the last decade to the study of the autonomic control of heart rate during dynamic exercise under physiological and pathological conditions. These studies included the development of new methods for the evaluation of autonomic control of heart rate during dynamic exercise in man. Pharmacological blockade of sympathetic (propranolol) and parasympathetic (atropine) efferent nerves was used to demonstrate differences in time constants and power-dependent relative participation of each division of the autonomic nervous system, as predominant mechanisms responsible for the tachycardia occurring during dynamic exercise. These findings have permitted the use of properly standardized dynamic exercise (discontinuous protocol: step powers, seated position on a bicycle ergometer, 4-min duration), as a simple and noninvasive test for the evaluation of autonomic control of the sinus node. This test has proved to be useful for detecting physiological autonomic adaptations induced by aerobic training, as well as dysfunctions occurring in pathologic conditions such as Chagas' disease and hyperthyroidism.",

The authors present the results of the open study in 35 women with migraine without aura treated with the daily dose of 1000-1500 mg of SV, during 10 weeks. The results were compared with the effect of propranolol administered to the same patients, in daily dose of 120-160 mg during 10 weeks. The effects were similar: in both methods more than 50% reduction of frequency and severity of attacks was obtained. The side effects were generally mild; in no case the treatment was stopped. The authors conclude that in the future SV might be administered in migraine prophylaxis as the first choice drug.",

The values od AUC and T1/2 for potentially active 4HOP-Sulf were significantly higher than those for unchanged P at a single and course administration. The values od AUC and T1/2 for for S-PG were approximately three times higher than those for P-PG after both a single and course administration.

    "85": "1. It was the aim of the present study to investigate the role of the beta-adrenergic receptor in hypoxaemia induced vasodilatation in the human forearm. 2. The study was performed in 12 non-smoking male volunteers. In six subjects the local vascular effects of intra-arterially (i.a.) infused propranolol (0.1 mu kg-1 min-1) was determined during normoxaemia and hypoxaemia (peripheral oxygen saturation; SpO2 80%), and compared with the contra-lateral (control) arm. beta-adrenergic receptor blockade by propranolol was confirmed by i.a. infusions of adrenaline. In six other subjects the effects of incremental hypoxaemia (SpO2 90, 85, 80%) on forearm- and finger blood flow was investigated. A difference between these vascular beds is the absence of vascular beta-adrenergic receptors in the finger. Forearm- and finger blood flow were measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Plasma levels of (nor-)adrenaline were determined in both arterial and venous blood samples. Hypoxaemia was attained by gradual decompression of a hypobaric chamber and individually adjusted. 3. During normoxaemia the single infusion of propranolol did not influence forearm vascular resistance. In contrast, during hypoxaemia a net vasoconstriction was observed in the arm treated with propranolol, which was significantly different (P = 0.009) from the vasodilatation in the control arm (mean difference in response 40%; 95% confidence interval 13.2-66.8). The net arterio-venous spillover of noradrenaline from the forearm increased after the first 15 min of hypoxaemia (P < 0.05) and returned to baseline in the next 15 min. Arterial and venous plasma levels of adrenaline during hypoxaemia remained unchanged compared with normoxaemia. In the second set of experiments incremental levels of hypoxaemia induced a vasoconstriction in the finger, which was significantly different (P = 0.025) from the vasodilatation in the forearm (mean difference in response 300%; 95% confidence interval 63-537). 4. The data indicate that beta-adrenergic receptors contribute to hypoxaemia induced vasodilatation, despite unaltered adrenaline plasma concentrations.", 
    "86": "A 44 year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, FAB, M4E) developed heart failure during treatment with anthracyclines for AML. She had not experienced heart disease and her left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 59% at the end of a successful remission induction therapy. Because her LVEF decreased to 33% after early consolidation therapy, the chemotherapy for AML was discontinued. The cumulative dose of daunorubicin, aclarubicin and mitoxantrone was 486 mg/m2, 135 mg/m2 and 55 mg/m2, respectively. In October 1990, four months after the end of the chemotherapy, heart failure (class III, NYHA) developed and did not improve by treatment consisting of dobutamin, digoxin and diuretics. Anthracycline cardiomyopathy was histologically confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy. Then we administered selective beta 1-antagonist, metoprolol (Seloken), with an initial dose of 5 mg/day which was doubled 3 times every 4 or 8 weeks to 40 mg/day, according to the treatment schedule of dilated cardiomyopathy. She recuperated satisfactorily (Class I, NYHA), and was discharged on February '91. Her LVEF gradually improved and it has been maintained at above 50% on an outpatient basis. The patient has been in complete hematological remission during this period. It seems that low dose selective beta 1-antagonist therapy has a potential to improve myocardial function in some patients with anthracycline cardiomyopathy.", 
    "87": "In this study, we examined the relation between spontaneously reported adverse experiences and responses given on the comparison of ophthalmic medications for tolerability (COMTOL) checklist questionnaire which queries the frequency and bother of specific side-effects known to be associated with topical ophthalmic agents used to treat ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma, and the impact that the side-effects have on health-related quality of life. The study was a 4-week, randomized, open-label, two-period cross-over clinical trial comparing dorzolamide and pilocarpine in 92 patients who were also receiving timolol for the treatment of ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. Patients completed the COMTOL questionnaire at baseline and at the end of each period and spontaneous reports of adverse experiences (AEs) were collected throughout the study by the investigator. Since there were only 3 spontaneously reported AEs related to drug treatment while patients received dorzolamide and since COMTOL scores indicated a low level of side-effects, the analyses were limited to pilocarpine treatment periods. We discovered that during the pilocarpine treatment periods, a large percentage (94%) of the 47 patients, who failed to spontaneously report any adverse experiences, indicated on the COMTOL that they had experienced side-effects. These discrepancies between the methods of spontaneous reports and a checklist questionnaire are similar to those previously reported in the literature for other drugs. Unlike previous literature, we went beyond identifying discrepancies with the two reporting methods and we looked for possible explanations for why the discrepancies existed. We discovered that patients who spontaneously reported AEs expressed more bother from these specific side-effects on the questionnaire than patients who did not spontaneously report AEs. As well, patients who spontaneously reported AEs and discontinued drug as a result of the AEs expressed on the COMTOL the greatest bother from side-effects. This trend of increasing negative impact (as patients reported AEs and discontinued) was also observed with COMTOL global question scores on the impact of side-effects on health-related quality of life, the impact of activity limitations on quality of life, satisfaction with medication and compliance with medication. Therefore, spontaneous reporting of side-effects appears to be detecting the most clinically meaningful side-effects.", 
    "88": "Magnesium sulphate has antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic properties, a coronary and systemic vasodilating action, a direct myocardial protective effect in experimental and clinical models of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Two meta-analyses have pooled the results of several small studies that had analyzed the effect of controlled hypermagnesiemia in acute myocardial infarction before the advent of thrombolytic and antithrombotic therapies. The results have shown a more than 50% mortality reduction, with a minimum estimated benefit of about 30%, and a reduction in ventricular arrhythmias of about 50%. In LIMIT-2, a double-blind trial of 2,316 patients where magnesium was administered as a 8 mMol bolus followed by a 24-hour infusion of 65 mMol, a 24% reduction in mortality was observed. However, these data have not been confirmed in the more than 58,000 patients of the ISIS-4 trial. In this study magnesium, at the same dose of the LIMIT trial, did not reduce 5-week mortality, neither in the general population (7.64% versus 7.24% in control patients, p = n.s.) nor in specific subgroups. The results of ISIS-4 have excluded the routine use of magnesium sulphate in acute myocardial infarction in the era of fibrinolysis and aspirin, beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors. Nevertheless, magnesium administration could still be considered in certain clinical situations, such as 1) the presence of contraindications to fibrinolysis and aspirin, 2) the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias unresponsive (or as an alternative) to lidocaine, 3) severe hypertension when beta-blockers are not indicated.",

The nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events during coadministration of nefazodone and propranolol were similar to those observed with either treatment alone. There were no clinically significant effects on vital signs, electrocardiographic results, or laboratory parameters. With coadministration, the maximum peak concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC tau) of propranolol decreased 29% and 14%, respectively; Cmax and AUC tau of 4-hydroxy-propranolol decreased 15% and 21%, respectively. Despite decreased plasma concentrations of the beta-antagonists, the reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia and post-exercise double product was slightly greater with coadministration than with propranolol alone. Administration of nefazodone alone did not significantly affect either pharmacologic parameter. The pharmacokinetics of nefazodone and its metabolites were largely unaffected during coadministration.

    "101": "Underfeeding or overfeeding of rats during the suckling period, realized by the adjustment of the number of sucklings per litter, are followed by important changes in the function of endocrine glands and hormonal stimulation of lipolysis in adipocytes. For explanation of causes of the differences in the stimulation of lipolysis the changes of beta-receptors in adipocytes were studied in animals with different neonatal nutrition. The number of suckling pups in litter was adjusted to 4, 8, 14 on the second postnatal day. After weaning (at the age of 30-500 days) the size of adipocytes, basal and norepinephrine stimulated lipolysis, the binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol in adipocytes were determined. In neonatally underfed animals, in comparison to overfed, those a decrease in the size of adipocytes, a diminution of basal lipolysis and lower stimulation of lipolysis by norepinephrine were observed. The decrease in binding capacity (at the age of 30-60 days) and of affinity of beta-receptors (at the age of 60 to 360 days) were found in neonatally overfed rats. These results showed that the changes of beta-adrenergic receptors in adipocytes of animals with neonatal nutritions have a role in the alteration of the stimulation of lipolysis in adipocytes.

    "102": "The effects of the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-m (oxo-m) on insulin secretion, K(+)-permeability and electrical activity from isolated mouse pancreatic islets were studied. Oxo-m potentiated glucose-induced insulin secretion in a dose-dependent manner, saturating at ca. 10 microM. At 11.2 mM glucose, oxo-m (0.1 and 10 microM) had two distinct effects on beta-cell electrical activity. Both concentrations increased the steady-state burst frequency, however, at 10 microM an initial and transient polarization was measured, and the subsequent activity was accompanied by a slight depolarization. The polarizing effect of oxo-m was almost completely suppressed by charybdotoxin (ChTX), a blocker of the large conductance (maxi) [Ca2+]i-activated potassium channel (K(Ca)). In the presence of 11.2 mM glucose, oxo-m (50 microM) provoked a significant and transient increase in the 86Rb efflux from perifused islets. This effect was inhibited by ChTX. ChTX also potentiated oxo-m stimulated insulin secretion in the presence of glucose. Finally, the balance between the polarizing and depolarizing effects of oxo-m was variable in different islets and depended on glucose concentration. Insulin secretion stimulated by oxo-m in the presence of glucose was more closely correlated to the agonist induced increase in burst frequency than to an increase in plateau fraction. We conclude that muscarinic stimulation has at least two effects on beta-cell electrical activity, an initial hyperpolarization, owing to activation of K(Ca) channels, followed by depolarization and high-frequency bursts, proposed to reflect the activation of a current sensitive to the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (CRAC).", 
    "103": "1. Using intracellular recording and voltage-clamp techniques, we examined the biophysical properties of a Ca(2+)-activated slow inward current and its physiological role in plateau potential generation in the dorsal gastric (DG) motor neuron of the stomatogastric ganglion in the crab, Cancer borealis. 2. As shown in the accompanying paper, a brief puff of serotonin (5-HT) evoked a plateau potential in the DG neuron. Intracellular loading of the Ca2+ chelator ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) prevented 5-HT from evoking a plateau potential. On the contrary, rapid increase of intracellular Ca2+ by photolysis of caged-Ca2+ (bound to DM-nitrophen) evoked a plateau response in DG bathed in normal saline. 3. Extracellular tetrodotoxin (TTX), tetraethylammonium (TEA), 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and Cs+ and intracellular iontophoresis of Cs+ were used to block voltage-dependent INa, IK, and Ih. Under these conditions we voltage clamped DG using two electrodes and isolated a long-lasting tail current after a short depolarization of the cell. 4. The reversal potential of the slow tail current was extrapolated to be -27 +/- 3.5 (SE) mV. Na+ substitutions with choline+, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane+ (Tris+) or n-methyl-glucamine+ (NMG+) did not significantly affect the reversal potential or the amplitude. 5. The slow tail current was Ca2+ dependent. It was reduced or abolished by the Ca2+ channel blocker Co2+, intracellular injection of EGTA, and by Ba2+ replacement of Ca2+ as the charge carrier. The activation and deactivation of this current do not show an apparent dependence on voltage. 6. When the voltage-dependent Na+, K+, and Ca2+ channels were blocked, a brief puff of caffeine evoked a slow depolarization. In voltage clamp, caffeine evoked a slow inward current with an apparent conductance increase. This current was reduced by intracellular EGTA. The current-voltage (I-V) relationship of the caffeine-evoked current was linear with a reversal potential of -25 +/- 4.8 mV. This was not statistically different from the reversal potential of the depolarization-evoked tail current. 7. 5-HT enhanced the depolarization-evoked slow tail current but had no effect on the caffeine-evoked slow inward current. 8. We conclude that the slow tail current is a Ca(2+)-activated nonselective current, similar to the Ca(2+)-activated nonspecific cation currents described in other preparations. This current appears to play an important role in plateau generation and maintenance in DG. 5-HT has no direct effect on the properties of this current, but it indirectly enhances the current through an increase of voltage-dependent Ca2+ current.",

Using current- and voltage-clamp techniques, we examined the biophysical properties of a voltage-dependent Ca2+ current and its physiological role in plateau potential generation in the dorsal gastric (DG) motor neuron of the stomatogastric ganglion in the crab, Cancer borealis. 2. Stimulation of one of a set of identified serotonergic/cholinergic mechanosensory cells, the gastropyloric receptor (GPR) cells, induced plateau potentials in DG. A brief pressure application of serotonin (5-HT) closely mimicked the effect of the GPR cells. The 5-HT-evoked plateau in DG was not blocked by the sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX), or a combination of TTX with potassium channel blockers, including tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and the Ih blocker, CsCl. The 5-HT-evoked plateau was eliminated by the Ca2+ channel blockers Co2+ and Cd2+, suggesting that Ca2+ entry is essential for plateau potentials in DG. During the plateau, we observed a 30% decrease in input resistance. 3. When sodium and potassium currents were blocked pharmacologically, injection of suprathreshold depolarizing current evoked all-or-none plateau-like responses lasting several seconds, even in the absence of 5-HT. This response was blocked by Ca2+ channel blockers, further supporting a role for Ca2+ in plateau generation. 5-HT significantly prolonged the duration of this plateau. 4. We isolated a voltage-dependent Ca2+ current in voltage-clamped DG neurons. This current was analyzed with the use of either Ca2+ or Ba2+ as the charge carrier after other currents had been maximally blocked with extracellular TTX, TEA, 4-AP, and CsCl and intracellular loading with Cs+ and ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). The Ca2+ current was detectable at -45 mV, peaked at -15 mV, and was estimated to reverse at +45 mV. Co2+ and Cd2+ effectively blocked the Ca2+ current. 5. The voltage dependence of activation of the Ca2+ current was quantantitively analyzed by fitting the voltage-conductance relation with a third power Boltzmann relation. The maximum conductance (gA), half-activation voltage (VA) for individual gating steps, and the slope steepness (k) were 0.19 +/- 0.02 (SE) microS, -36.5 +/- 2.0 mV, and 4.4 +/- 1.4 mV/e-fold, respectively. 6. 5-HT significantly potentiated the gA by approximately 42% without affecting VA and k. 7. We conclude from our current- and voltage-clamp results that a voltage-dependent Ca2+ current plays an important role in generating plateau potentials in the DG neuron. Enhancement of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ current by 5-HT is one of the mechanisms for 5-HT-evoked plateau potentials.", 
    "105": "Species differences in the metabolism of bunitrolol (BTL) and propranolol (PL) in liver microsomes from rats and dogs were investigated. Hepatic microsomes from dogs lacked the ability to catalyze PL 7-hydroxylation, which is mediated by the CYP2D subfamily in rats. This suggested that dogs might lack the CYP2D subfamily; however, the antibody against cytochrome P450 (P450) BTL (CYP2D2) recognized a protein of approximately 49 kDa in hepatic microsomes from dogs, indicative of the presence of the CYP2D subfamily in dogs. The P450 purified from dog hepatic microsomes was designated P450 Canis familiaris (CF)1. It cross-reacted with the antibody against P450 BTL. The apparent molecular weight of the purified P450 CF1 was estimated to be 49 kDa. Its N-terminal amino acid sequence resembled the sequences of the members of the rat CYP2D subfamily and was the same as the sequences of the dog CYP2D subfamily, as deduced from the cDNA, except for the lack of four residues at the N-terminal. P450 CF1 could mediate metabolism of BTL and PL. P450 CF1, however, could not mediate PL 7-hydroxylation, which is almost exclusively mediated by CYP2D in rats. These findings indicate that P450 CF1 belongs to the CYP2D subfamily and that it differs functionally from the rat CYP2D subfamily. An antipeptide antibody against the synthetic peptide (DPTQPPRH), the sequence of which occurs in dog CYP2D at position 266-273 (S. Kirita et al., unpublished data), inhibited BTL 4-hydroxylase activity by 71% in dog hepatic microsomes at the substrate concentration of 0.01 M. This is further evidence that the CYP2D subfamily, in particular P450 CF1, is largely responsible for the oxidation of beta-blockers in dog hepatic microsomes.",

Pressure gradients and total cardiac work load (expressed as rate x pressure product) were assessed, and the relationship between increasing cardiac work load and the resulting left ventricular hypertrophy was established in a control group and compared with left ventricular hypertrophy in a group treated with a high dose of oral propranolol (80 mg kg-1 body weight). 3. In the rats with mean pressure gradients over the coarctation in the range of 15-31 mmHg, the animals on control diet showed a 38% increase in left ventricular weight/body weight ratio (LV ratio) and a 30% increase in heart weight/body weight ratio (heart ratio), whereas rats given high dose oral propranolol-treatment showed increases of only 13% and 9%, respectively. 4. In a second series of rats with a wider range of pressure gradients, the regression lines of LV ratio versus mean pressure gradient, and of LV ratio versus cardiac work, were different in the two groups with a slope that was only half as steep in the propranolol-treated rats as in the controls. Thus, for the same increment in cardiac work load, the degree of compensatory cardiac hypertrophy in propranolol-treated rats was half that observed in controls. 5. The reduction in compensatory cardiac hypertrophy was not associated with an increase in incidence of congestive heart failure and the propranolol-treated rats were able to sustain equally high (or higher) degrees of pressure over-load as controls did. 6. It is concluded that propranolol treatment approximately halves the compensatory cardiac hypertrophy occurring in response to a left ventricular pressure over-load by a mechanism independent of its effect on cardiac work load. This finding provides further support for the view that noradrenaline released from sympathetic nerve terminals in the heart exerts a trophic effect on cardiac myocytes, and that the sympathetic nervous system may be the final common pathway in many forms of compensatory cardiac hypertrophy. In contrast to in vitro models, this effect appears to be largely mediated via beta-adrenoceptors in the intact animal.", 
    "108": "1. The study was undertaken to assess the role of beta-adrenoceptors in the induction of compensatory cardiac hypertrophy in an in vivo model. 2. In the rat, exposure to severe hypoxia (6% inspired oxygen for 8 h day) caused a 51% increase in right heart weight and a 75% increase in haematocrit. 3. The hypoxia-induced right ventricular hypertrophic response was reduced by 65% by oral treatment with a high dose of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (80 mg kg-1 body weight); the drug treatment caused only a minor reduction (6%) in secondary polycythaemia. 4. With a less severe degree of hypoxia (7% inspired oxygen) there was only minimal secondary polycythaemia (+15%), and a lesser degree of compensatory right ventricular hypertrophy in untreated rats (+33%). 5. Treatment with the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol, in a dose of 80 mg kg-1 body weight abolished right ventricular hypertrophy in response to 7% inspired oxygen, without affecting haematocrit and caused a small reduction in the ratio of heart weight to body weight in normoxic rats. 6. The results show that the effect of propranolol on hypoxic right ventricular hypertrophy is not secondary to any effect on secondary polycythaemia as has previously been suggested and that a marked reduction of compensatory cardiac hypertrophy can be obtained by a beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist. Thus these findings support the view that noradrenaline released from cardiac sympathetic nerve terminals exerts a trophic effect on myocardial cells and demonstrates that in vivo, this trophic effect can be reduced by beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "109": "1. The monosynaptic reflex (MSR), recorded in vitro from the neonatal rat spinal cord, was depressed by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), methysergide and R(+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), and also by the selective 5-HT1D agonists, sumatriptan and N-methyl-3-(1-methyl-1-piperidinyl)-1H-indole-5-ethane sulphonamide (GR 85548). 2. Ketanserin (1 microM) and methiothepin (1 microM) reduced the duration of depressions elicited by 5-CT, but not those produced by 5-HT, sumatriptan, GR 85548, methysergide or 8-OH-DPAT. 3. The IC50 for MSR depression by 5-CT was 3.6, 2.1-6.2 nM (n = 4), by sumatriptan was 15.2, 12.9-18.0 nM (n = 32), by GR 85548 was 18.4, 11.7-29.1 nM (n = 12), by methysergide was 29.8, 10.2-87.1 nM (n = 4) and by 8-OH-DPAT was 0.21, 0.11-0.43 microM (n = 3) (geometric means and 95% confidence limits). 4. Ketanserin (0.1 or 1 microM) antagonized competitively responses to sumatriptan (apparent pA2 7.8 +/- 0.1, n = 5), GR 85548 (apparent pA2 7.6, unpaired data, n = 5), methysergide (apparent pA2 7.9 +/- 0.12, n = 4) and 8-OH-DPAT (apparent pA2 8.3 +/- 0.1, n = 3). Concentration-response curves to 5-CT showed a smaller, parallel shift to the right (apparent pA2 6.8 +/- 0.1, n = 4), but responses to 5-HT were unaffected by ketanserin (1 microM) (n = 4). 5. Methiothepin (1 microM) antagonized competitively responses to GR 85548 (apparent pA2 7.7, unpaired data, n = 5). 6. Mianserin (0.3 microM), a concentration sufficient to cause substantial block of 5-HT2C-mediated responses but have only a small effect on 5-HT1D-mediated actions, caused a small, non-parallel shift of the concentration-response curve to sumatriptan. 7. Depression of the MSR by sumatriptan was not blocked by (+/-)-cyanopindolol (0.1 microM), (+/-)-propranolol (0.5 or 1 microM) or spiroxatrine (0.1 microM), and depression of MSR by 8-OH-DPAT was not blocked by spiroxatrine (0.1 microM). (+/-)-Cyanopindolol (0.1 and 1 microM) itself induced a slow depression of the MSR. 8. The novel 5-HT1D antagonist, N-[4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) phenyl]2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl) [1,1-biphenyl]-4-carboxamide (GR 127935, 30 nM to 1 microM) caused a concentration-related depression of the reflex (up to 50%) usually slow in onset. Neither with these concentrations nor with concentrations in the range 1-3 nM was there any unequivocal blockade of responses to sumatriptan. 9. It is concluded that sumatriptan, GR 85548, methysergide and 8-OH-DPAT depress the MSR in the neonate rat spinal cord via ketanserin-sensitive receptors, which have some similarities to 5-HT1D alpha receptors but which are not blocked by GR 127935. 5-HT released by tryptaminergic pathways may act via the same receptors to depress the MSR. 5-HT applied to the cord probably acts via a different, possibly novel 5-HT receptor to depress the MSR.", 
    "110": "1. Homogenate binding studies and receptor autoradiography have been used to examine the binding characteristics and localization of propranolol-resistant (-)-[125I]-cyanopindolol (CYP) binding sites in rat ileum. 2. Saturation studies with (-)-[125I]-CYP and homogenates of rat ileum identified a site with pKD 8.89 +/- 0.08 and Bmax = 50.3 +/- 4.1 fmol mg-1 protein (n = 6). Both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors (AR) were not detected in these preparations. 3. (-)-Isoprenaline infusion (400 micrograms kg-1 h-1) for 14 days caused no significant change in the density of (-)-[125I]-CYP binding which was 48.9 +/- 12.8 and 40.6 +/- 12.3 fmol mg-1 protein in control and isoprenaline-treated animals respectively (n = 6) (P = 0.97). 4. Competition for (-)-[125I]-CYP binding in the presence of 0.1 microM (-)-propranolol gave affinity values for CYP, tertatolol, alprenolol, ICI 118551 and CGP 20712A that correspond to known affinities at atypical beta-ARs. Stereoselectivity ratios for tertatolol and alprenolol were low. 5. Autoradiographic localization of propranolol resistant (-)-[125I]-CYP binding showed sites associated with the mucosa and to a lesser extent to the muscularis. A small population of beta 2-ARs were detected located predominantly in the longitudinal and circular smooth muscle layers. 6. This study identifies an (-)-[125I]-CYP binding site in rat ileum that is resistant to blockade by propranolol (0.1 microM), is located predominantly in the mucosa, shows resistance to downregulation by isoprenaline and has binding characteristics of the atypical beta-AR.", 
    "111": "Endogenous glucose production rate (EGPR) remains constant when lactate is infused in healthy humans. A decrease of glycogenolysis or of gluconeogenesis from endogenous precursors or a stimulation of glycogen synthesis, may all be involved; This autoregulation does not depend on changes in glucoregulatory hormones. It may be speculated that alterations in basal sympathetic tone may be involved. To gain insights into the mechanisms responsible for autoregulation of EGPR, glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis were measured, with a novel method (based on the prelabelling of endogenous glycogen with 13C glucose, and determination of hepatic 13C glycogen enrichment from breath 13CO2 and respiratory gas exchanges) in healthy humans infused with lactate or saline. These measurements were performed with or without beta-adrenergic receptor blockade (propranolol). Infusion of lactate increased energy expenditure, but did not increase EGPR; the relative contributions of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to EGPR were also unaltered. This indicates that autoregulation is attained, at least in part, by inhibition of gluconeogenesis from endogenous precursors. beta-adrenergic receptor blockade alone (with propranolol) did not alter EGPR, glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. During infusion of lactate, propranolol decreased the thermic effect of lactate but EGPR remained constant. This indicates that alterations of beta-adrenergic activity is not required for autoregulation of EGPR.", 
    "112": "Silent ischemia is a frequent finding in patients with unstable angina and portends a poor prognosis. We compared the efficacy of sustained-release (SR) verapamil and metoprolol in reducing silent ischemia in patients with unstable angina and assessed whether detection of silent ischemia was related to unfavorable outcomes in the contemporary setting of concurrent therapy with heparin and aspirin. Holter monitoring (leads a VF, V2, V5) for the first 72 h was used to assess the frequency and duration of ST-shift episodes. There were 37 patients in the verapamil-SR group and 40 patients in the metoprolol group, with both groups having similar baseline characteristics. There were more episodes of angina in the verampamil-SR group (29 vs. 12, p = 0.05). There was no difference between the two groups in the frequency (51 vs. 49 episodes, p = 0.9) or duration (23 +/- 48 vs. 18 +/- 50 min, p = 0.6) of ST-shift episodes. There were 20 unfavorable in-hospital outcomes distributed equally between the two groups (p = 0.9). Patients with unfavorable outcomes had ST shift more often (50 vs. 28%, p = 0.07) and for a longer duration (40 +/- 69 vs. 13 +/- 38 min, p = 0.03). Patients with ST shift > or = 60 min had a 60% probability of unfavorable outcome compared with 33% for ST shift of 1-59 min duration and 20% for no ST shift (p = 0.04). We conclude that metoprolol appears to reduce symptoms better than verapamil-SR, but no difference in silent ischemia or unfavorable outcomes was seen. Silent ischemia remains a common occurrence in these patients despite heparin and aspirin therapy and its detection continues to have prognostic value.", 
    "113": "The effects of hypertonic saline solution (HSS) and hyperosmotic dextrose (HD; 2,400 mosm/L, 4 ml/kg of body weight) on left ventricular afterload were determined in normovolumic, chloralose-anesthetized, autonomically blocked dogs (n = 8). Solutions were infused IV over 3 minutes. Left ventricular afterload was assessed by use of a dual-tipped micromanometer catheter with an electromagnetic fluid-velocity sensor located in the ascending aorta, and the impedance spectrum was calculated after Fourier analysis of signal-averaged aortic pressure and flow signals. Hypertonic saline solution and HD decreased peripheral resistance, reflection coefficient at zero frequency, and frequency of the first zero crossing of the phase angle for 3 to 5 minutes after either fluid was administered. Characteristic impedance was not altered by HSS or HD. These impedance spectrum changes indicate transient vasodilatation and afterload reduction. We conclude that the vascular effect of an ionic hyperosmotic solution (HSS) is similar to that of a nonionic hyperosmotic solution (HD), and that HSS and HD transiently decrease afterload in normovolumic dogs. The duration of the afterload reduction after HSS administration appeared to be too short to be of great clinical benefit.", 
    "114": "Nitrovasodilators and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of angina pectoris and hypertension, but each has side effects that may prevent their long-term use. In the present study responses of coronary arteries and arterioles to nipradilol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with nitrovasodilator action, were compared to nitroglycerin in normal myocardium of the beating left ventricle in anesthetized dogs. Coronary arteries and arterioles were visualized using stroboscopic illumination of epicardial surface of the heart and intravital microscopy with fluorescence angiography. Diameters were measured under control conditions and during topical suffusion of nipradilol (10(-8)-10(-4) M) or nitroglycerin (10(-8)-10(-4) M). Nipradilol produced dose-dependent dilation of all size arteries and arterioles however, dilation was inversely related to vessel size. Arterioles less than 100 microns in diameter dilated more than arteries greater than 200 microns in diameter. In contrast, dilation to nitroglycerin was directly related to vessel size. Arteries larger than 200 microns dilated more than arterioles less than 100 microns. In conclusion, although nipradilol and nitroglycerin are both nitrovasodilators the microvascular response to these agents is different.", 
    "115": "To determine the existence of beta 3-adrenoceptors in functional assays in isolated preparations for which data are lacking, we compared the effects of SR 58611A, a selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, and isoprenaline in the guinea pig common bile duct, distal colon and urinary bladder. SR 58611A and isoprenaline relaxed the common bile duct (EC50: 6.85 and 0.41 mumol/l, respectively). The effect of SR 58611A was resistant to CGP 20712A, ICI 118551, propranolol and tetrodotoxin, but was antagonized by alprenolol (pA2 = 6.86), while the effect of isoprenaline was antagonized by CGP 20712A, ICI 118551, propranolol and alprenolol (pA2 = 7.04, in the presence of propranolol to saturate beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors). In colonic preparations, SR 58611A and isoprenaline relaxed circular muscle strips (EC50: 5.48 and 0.49 mumol/l, respectively). The effect of SR 58611A was resistant to CGP 20712A, ICI 118551, propranolol and tetrodotoxin, but was antagonized by alprenolol (pA2 = 7.01). The effect of isoprenaline was resistant to CGP 20712A, but was antagonized by ICI 118551, propranolol and alprenolol (pA2 = 6.88, in the presence of propranolol). In urinary bladder strips, SR 58611A had no effect, whereas isoprenaline reduced resting tone (EC50:0.87 mumol/l), an effect antagonized by alprenolol (pA2 = 8.14). These data provide functional evidence for the presence of beta 3-adrenoceptors in the guinea pig common bile duct and colon, but not in the urinary bladder. At the concentrations used, the effect of SR 58611A was probably mediated solely by activation of beta 3-adrenoceptors located on smooth muscle cells, whereas the effects of isoprenaline were due to beta 3- and also to beta 1-and/or beta 2-adrenoceptor activation.", 
    "116": "The past few decades have seen a remarkable development in the field of pharmacological therapy, one of the most notable examples being the treatment of arterial hypertension. Some of the early anti-hypertensive agents were relatively crude by today's standards, but gradually efficacy, tolerability, or both, of blood pressure-lowering (BP) drugs have been improved. It is presently possible to choose from a number of effective and well-tolerated compounds for the treatment of hypertension. The latest additions to the anti-hypertensive armamentarium are the angiotensin II receptor antagonists, the most advanced of these being losartan. It is perhaps most relevant to compare losartan to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, another class of anti-hypertensive agents which acts mainly by interfering with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Studies have shown that losartan lowers BP at least as effectively as ACE inhibitors. However, the side-effect profile of losartan is more favourable. In particular cough, a relatively common side-effect of ACE inhibitors, has been shown to be significantly less common during losartan treatment. This is probably because losartan does not interfere with bradykinin metabolism, unlike the ACE inhibitors. Regarding the reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a powerful risk indicator for cardiovascular disease, we have shown that losartan is more effective in this regard than treatment with the beta-blocker atenolol. It appears, based on these and other findings, that interference with the RAAS is particularly useful in causing reversal of the cardiovascular hypertrophic changes. The prognostic implications remain to be demonstrated, but it would be logical to expect a benefit from this effect. It was recently shown that polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease even in the absence of conventional risk factors. If these findings are confirmed the interest in interfering with the RAAS as a therapeutic modality in hypertension would obviously be strengthened. It is not easy to predict the future role of any new therapeutic modality. The positive relation between efficacy and tolerability of losartan, as well as the fact that several observations suggest that interference with the RAAS could be favourable from a prognostic point of view, suggest that losartan may come to play an important role in the future treatment of hypertension.", 
    "117": "This 12-week, open-label study was conducted to gain experience with losartan potassium, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, in patients with severe hypertension. Patients were either untreated or withdrawn from current therapy for at least 48 h before initiation of losartan 50 mg once daily. Patients were titrated to 100 mg as needed to achieve a goal of sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) 90 or 95 mm Hg. Hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg once daily titrated to 25 mg) was added and followed by either a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) and/or atenolol, if BP was not controlled. A total of 179 patients with a pretreatment mean baseline BP of 172 +/- 17/112 +/- 18 mm Hg enrolled in the trial and BP was recorded 24 h after dosing at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8 and the final week (10-12 weeks). The mean reductions in SiDBP from baseline were 7.3, 9.3, 15.9 and 18.9 mm Hg, respectively, and these changes from baseline were statistically significant, P < 0.001. At the end of the trial, 22% of patients remained on losartan monotherapy, 30% required the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and 31% required both HCTZ and a CCB; 11% required HCTZ and atenolol while 4% required HCTZ, a CCB and atenolol; 2% of patients were on regimens not specified by the protocol. SiDBP < 90 mm Hg was achieved in 68 patients by the final visit; 24% of these patients were treated with losartan monotherapy (50 or 100 mg), 41% achieved control with the addition of HCTZ (12.5 or 25 mg) and 24% required triple therapy which included losartan, HCTZ and a CCB. As assessed by the investigator, 25% of the patients in the study had drug-related clinical adverse experiences. Headache was the most frequently reported clinical adverse event (26% of patients). No clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters were observed. It is concluded that losartan potassium can be used as initial therapy for patients with severe hypertension and can be administered concurrently with hydrochlorothiazide, calcium channel blockers and atenolol.", 
    "118": "We studied the clinical symptoms in nine children (seven females and two males; mean age 11.6 years) with severe but transient acute secondary erythermalgia. The classical symptoms at presentation were episodic attacks of painful burning hands and feet which felt warm with congested appearance of the feet. Each attack lasted for a mean period of 25 days (range from 6 to 56 days). The blood pressure was elevated in seven patients. Intravenous sodium nitroprusside was effective in ameliorating the symptoms with drop in blood pressure to normal in five patients; pizotifene, labetolol, prostaglandin E1 and hypnotherapy were effective in each of four separate cases. The episodes of acute secondary erythermalgia were transient in all and did not recur after a mean follow up period of 1.6 years. These cases suggest that acute secondary erythermalgia, however transient, is not rare and can be associated with mild to moderate hypertension which may respond to sodium nitroprusside. A greater awareness of this condition is necessary to make an accurate and timely diagnosis and institute appropriate therapy in order to prevent undue complications.", 
    "119": "1. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether intracerebral microdialysis can be used for the assessment of local differences in drug concentrations within the brain. 2. Two transversal microdialysis probes were implanted in parallel into the frontal cortex of male Wistar rats, and used as a local infusion and detection device respectively. Within one rat, three different concentrations of atenolol or acetaminophen were infused in randomized order. By means of the detection probe, concentration-time profiles of the drug in the brain were measured at interprobe distances between 1 and 2 mm. 3. Drug concentrations were found to be dependent on the drug as well as on the interprobe distance. It was found that the outflow concentration from the detection probe decreased with increasing lateral spacing between the probes and this decay was much steeper for acetaminophen than for atenolol. A model was developed which allows estimation of kbp/Deff (transfer coefficient from brain to blood/effective diffusion coefficient in brain extracellular fluid), which was considerably larger for the more lipohilic drug, acetaminophen. In addition, in vivo recovery values for both drugs were determined. 4. The results show that intracerebral microdialysis is able to detect local differences in drug concentrations following infusion into the brain. Furthermore, the potential use of intracerebral microdialysis to obtain pharmacokinetic parameters of drug distribution in brain by means of monitoring local concentrations of drugs in time is demonstrated.", 
    "120": "1. In order to obtain specific antibodies of the P4502D subfamily, we generated two anti-peptide antibodies against synthetic peptides, DPAQPPRD (peptide A) and DPTQPPRH (peptide B). The sequence of peptide A occurs in rat P4502D2, P4502D4 and human P4502D6, whereas the sequence of peptide B occurs in the dog P4502D subfamily. These sequences are closely related to an epitope of liver/kidney microsomal autoimmune hepatitis. 2. In immunoblotting studies, the anti-peptide antibody against peptide A recognized a 49-KDa protein in microsomes derived from human lymphoblasts expressing P4502D6 and rat liver. It showed no crossreactivity with microsomes from dog liver. In contrast, the anti-peptide antibody against peptide B recognized a 49-KDa protein only in microsomes of dog liver. These indicate that each anti-peptide antibody has the specificity for the respective sequences of the members of P4502D subfamily, with the species investigated herein. 3. In immunoinhibition studies, the anti-peptide antibodies against peptide B inhibited bunitrolol 4-hydroxylation and propranolol 4,5-hydroxylation, which are mediated by the dog P4502D subfamily. These data suggest that the anti-peptide antibodies against peptide B bind to the native and denatured forms of the P4502D subfamily. 4. The present study has demonstrated that the anti-peptide antibodies against this region are useful for studying the members of the P4502D subfamily.", 
    "121": "To study the effects of airway obstruction (AWO) and arousal on coronary blood flow, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), pigs were chronically instrumented with arterial catheters, Doppler flow probes on the left circumflex coronary artery, and electrodes for determination of sleep stages. A modified balloon catheter was placed in the trachea to obstruct the upper airway during sleep. Following control studies, the role of beta adrenergic receptors in hemodynamic responses to AWO was assessed by administering propranolol, a beta adrenoreceptor blocking agent. In control studies, during nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREM), MAP was 85 +/- 2 mmHg before AWO and increased by 8 +/- 2 mmHg upon arousal. Mean arterial pressure was lower during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (64 +/- 2 mmHg) and the increase upon arousal was threefold greater (22 +/- 2 mmHg). Heart rate was similar in both sleep stages (NREM 123 +/- 5 bpm; REM 125 +/- 6 bpm) and increased significantly upon arousal (NREM, 11 +/- 2 bpm; REM, 18 +/- 3 bpm increase). Coronary blood flow was similar during both stages (NREM 44 +/- 5 ml/min; REM 44 +/- 6 ml/min) and increased by 13% (NREM) and 22% (REM) during arousal. Coronary vascular resistance increased significantly by 17% during arousal from AWO during REM sleep. All changes were significant at p < 0.05. Following beta adrenergic receptor blockade studies using propranolol, baseline HR was reduced in NREM sleep and HR and coronary blood flow increases during arousal from apnea were eliminated. Adrenoreceptor blockade studies suggest that these effects were mediated by the beta adrenergic component of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "122": "Celiprolol is a beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker) which acts as a weak agonist at beta 2-adrenoceptors. The drug demonstrates vasodilator properties and does not depress heart rate to the same extent as propranolol, atenolol or metoprolol. Celiprolol has shown equivalent antihypertensive efficacy to other beta-blockers, notably propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol and pindolol, in patients aged 18 to 75 years with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The drug has also shown similar antihypertensive efficacy to the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and to combination diuretic therapy with hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride. Celiprolol was equally effective in adult patients of all ages, although no data are available for patients aged over 75 years. Data from a small number of clinical trials indicate celiprolol to be as effective as both propranolol and atenolol in improving work capacity and reducing the frequency of anginal attacks in patients with stable effort angina. However, the drug has not yet been evaluated in postmyocardial infarction patients. Celiprolol offers advantages over other beta-blockers, including reduction of peripheral vascular resistance and maintenance of resting heart rate, cardiac output and renal perfusion. The drug is also associated with improvements in plasma lipid profiles and does not appear to adversely affect carbohydrate metabolism or lung function, although its use in patients with reversible obstructive pulmonary disease is not recommended. Celiprolol is therefore a highly cardioselective beta-blocker with ancillary characteristics which are potentially useful in patients with hypertension and angina complicated by other conditions commonly associated with advanced age. These include impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease and hyperlipidaemia. The drug may also be preferred to other beta-blockers in patients in whom a reduction in heart rate would be particularly undesirable. Further long term (> 12 months) clinical trials and pharmacoeconomic data are now required to confirm the clinical relevance of the pharmacodynamic advantages of celiprolol therapy.",

Serum samples were collected and immediately frozen at -20 degrees C. Within 1 week, the serum samples were thawed at room temperature, and adjusted to pH 7.4 using 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 5.0. Aliquots were spiked with 250 ng mL-1 and 500 ng mL-1 of each STL enantiomer, placed in ultrafiltration sets (Microsep, 30K molecular weight cut-off), capped, equilibrated to 37 degrees C, and centrifuged at 1850g for 1.5 h at 37 degrees C. Aliquots of ultrafiltrate and unspun serum were analysed for STL enantiomer concentration using a stereospecific HPLC assay. In all groups, bound fraction was less than 7% for both STL enantiomers. There were no significant differences in bound fraction between groups, or between enantiomers. Adsorption of STL enantiomers to the ultrafiltration device and membrane, evaporative loss of serum samples during centrifugation, and protein concentration in each ultrafiltrate sample were all negligible. It is concluded that the binding of STL in human and rat serum at therapeutic concentrations and physiological temperature and pH is negligible and non-stereoselective.", 
    "131": "This paper presents the results of a study comparing the effectiveness of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, atenolol, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I), phenelzine, and the combination in treatment of 61 adults with migraine headache. The goals of the study are (1) to investigate the safety of concomitant treatment of migraine with beta-blockers and phenelzine, (2) to assess whether orthostatic hypertension and other side effects would be relieved, and (3) to compare the results of this open trial of phenelzine to those of a previous study using similar methods. Phenelzine was associated with a large decrease in the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. Anxiety and depression were also reduced by phenelzine both alone, and in combination with a beta-blocker. The results show that the combination of MAO-I's and beta-blockers can be administered safely, and can lead to the reduction in the side effects with either drug alone."
