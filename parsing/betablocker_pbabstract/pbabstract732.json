    "0": "Over the past decade, research in blood platelet physiology has led to the suggestion that platelets play an important part in the pathogenesis and complications of coronary artery disease. Occlusive intravascular platelet aggregates have been shown to cause ischemic myocardial damage in the experimental animal and to be present in some patients who die suddenly. The interplay between endothelial damage and platelet aggregation has been implicated in the etiology of atherosclerosis. Products released from platelets during aggregation may cause arterial spasm. Patients with overt ischemic heart disease and with the risk factors associated with coronary artery disease have been found to have abnormally reactive platelets. Clinical studies of drugs that inhibit platelet aggregation have been reported to show a beneficial effect in preventing cardiac deaths or myocardial infarction; other studies have been negative or shown only a trend toward benefit. This report reviews the theoretical and experimental basis for the platelet hypothesis and the current data on the use of antiplatelet drugs in patients with coronary disease.", 
    "1": "The effects of acebutolol (800 mg per day for three days) on pulse rate, blood pressure, plasma noradrenaline and plasma renin activity were measured in nine patients with essential hypertension, at rest in a horizontal position, after five minutes standing upright and after walking for one hour. Acebutolol reduced pulse rate, blood pressure and plasma renin activity in all three positions. Treatment has no influence on plasma noradrenaline in a horizontal position, but significantly reduced its orthostatic stimulation. The inhibition of noradrenergic response to an orthosatic position is compatible with a central or presynaptic effect of acebutolol. This effect would not appear to be essential to its antihypertensive action since acebutolol reduced blood pressure but not plasma noradrenaline in a horizontal position. Blood pressure response to treatment was positively correlated to initial values of plasma renin activity measured after walking for one hour and plasma noradrenaline measured after five minutes in an orthostatic position. On the basis of this correlation, measurement of these two hormonal indices is of predictive value, within the limits of a short period of treatment with acebutolol and strictly defined hospital conditions.", 
    "2": "Timolol maleate is the first beta-adrenergic-blocking drug available in the United States for topical therapy in open angle glaucoma. It may be used alone for initial therapy in selected patients or with other antiglaucoma drugs in patients requiring additional control. It should be tried, before resorting to surgery, when traditional maximal medical therapy has failed or is not tolerated. Timolol has few local side effects, but since it is absorbed, it may produce systemic reactions similar to those induced by orally administered propranolol hydrochloride. Timolol appears to be an important advance in antiglaucoma therapy, although further experience is needed to determine whether its long-term usefulness will be limited by the development of tolerance or the appearance of unexpected side effects.", 
    "3": "The effects of intravenous propranolol, metoprolol, acebutolol and placebo on exercise-induced changes in heart rate and peak flow rate (PFR) have been studied in a group of healthy subjects. The three beta-blockers produced significant and comparable reductions in exercise-induced tachycardia and the magnitude of the reduction was related to the log plasma concentration of each drug. Significant cardiac beta-blockade was detectable for three hours after giving propranolol and for four hours after metoprolol and acebutolol. The exercise-induced changes in PFR were small and variable and were not significantly affected by any of the drugs. We conclude that, contrary to published reports, exercise-induced changes in heart rate and PFR in healthy subjects do not provide a satisfactory test system for assessing the selectivity of beta-blockers.", 
    "4": "Matched doses of metoprolol and pindolol were administered to 31 hypertensive outpatients in a double-blind randomized crossover trial, which was designed to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and pattern of side effects of the two drugs. Twenty-nine patients completed the study. A tenfold difference in dose (25 +/- 2 mg/day of pindolol and 234 +/- 22 mg/day of metoprolol) was required to produce a similar antihypertensive effect. There was a significantly greater fall in pulse rate during metoprolol treatment. Complaints of dry mouth, mild Raynaud's phenomenon, and eye discomfort were more frequent during treatment with metoprolol; and sleep disturbances and abnormal dreaming patterns were more frequent during treatment with pindolol.", 
    "5": "Baroreceptor activity was increased after i.v. infusion of acebutolol in rabbits with an intact circulation, and in rabbits with a total cardiopulmonary by-pass. In rabbits with an intact circulation, renal nerve activity was reduced.", 
    "6": "In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) chronically treated during their growth with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, no correlation was found between the reduction in heart rate and the prevention of genetic hypertension development.", 
    "7": "Common effects of four beta-adrenergic blocking drugs have been investigated in mice using classical and new psychopharmacological tests. Propranolol, alprenolol, practolol and penbutolol reduced the increase in locomotor activity produced by reserpine after MAO inhibition; they produce hypothermia when associated with amphetamine and they increase oxotremorine-induced hypothermia. Regarding these three tests the studied substances ranged themseleves in the same order of potency: penbutolol greater than propranolol greater than alprenolol greater than practolol. Propranolol and penbutolol decreased the toxicity provoked in crowded mice by amphetamine or by the association pargyline-reserpine; alprenolol and practolol did not. Propranolol, penbutolol and alprenolol antagonized the amphetamine-induced increase in motor activity; practolol did not. When used at doses for which d-l propranolol was active, the dextrogyre isomer of propranolol was without effect whatever the test studied. It is suggested that for the selection of a beta-blocking drug, regarding central effects in man, the tests described would deserve consideration.", 
    "8": "Propranolol alone was used to prepare 20 thyrotoxic patients, 19 women and 1 man, for subtotal thyroidectomy. Serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations were measured immediately before, at several stages during and after the surgical procedure. As judged primarily by the cardiovascular response, an average of 80 mg (range 40 to 120 mg) of propranolol qid for 8 days (range 3 to 18 days) was required to prepare the patients. During the various stages of surgical removal there was no change from the initial mean (+/- SEM) T4 concentration of 25.0 +/- 2.5 microgram/dl (321.8 +/- 32.2 nmol/l) or T3 concentration of 4.2 +/- 0.6 microgram/l (6.45 +/- 0.92 nmol/l) (P greater than 0.2). At discharge on the fifth postoperative day values were significantly lower, 12.9 +/- 1.5 microgram/dl (166.0 +/- 19.3 nmol/l) and 1.9 +/- 0.2 microgram/l (2.9 +/- 0.31 nmol/l), respectively (P less than 0.001). There were no operative complications but four patients had transient hypoparathyroidism. After 1 year 2 of 18 patients had permanent hypoparathyroidism and 4 of the 18 followed up for 1 year had permanent hypothyroidism requiring thyroid hormone replacement. There was no instance of recurrent thyrotoxicosis. The authors conclude that during surgical manipulation of the gland no release of thyroid hormones into the circulation was detected and that, using propranolol as the sole agent, thyrotoxic patients can be rapidly and safely prepared for subtotal thyroidectomy.", 
    "9": "Fourteen hyperthyroid patients (11 men, three women), ages 28-66, were followed with serial measurements of serum thyroid hormone levels for 1 mo after therapy with I-131. Twelve patients had diffuse toxic goiters (25--70 g in size); two patients had multinodular glands (40--100 g). The patients were taking no antithyroid medications; ten patients were treated with propranolol. All patients received the equivalent of 5000 rad, except the two with multinodular glands, who received larger doses. There was no consistent pattern of serum T4 and T3 levels after the I-131 therapy. For the entire group, there was no significant increase of the mean serum hormone concentration. One group (three patients) had a mean T4 increase of 28% and a T3 increase of 91% above baseline at Days 10--11. Seven patients had minimal increases of hormone levels at Days 2--3, and a third group (four patients) had no increase of thyroid hormones after I-131 therapy. The patients with no rise in hormone concentrations had smaller goiters than the other groups. There was no correlation of the dose of radioactive iodine, or of the initial hormone concentration, with the rises or declines of T4 and T3 levels after I-131 therapy. Radioiodine therapy caused no significant increase of serum T4 and T3 concentrations in the majority of patients.", 
    "10": "In two previous studies the effects of topically applied 1% and 0.2% solutions of bupranolol on intraocular pressure were investigated in 21 and respectively 20 eyes with chronic uncomplicated open-angle glaucoma.--As early as 30 minutes after both solutions a very significant pressure drop, without concomittant pupillary reaction, was recorded. The 1% bupranolol solution was less well tolerated and caused some ocular irritation. The present study was therefore initiated in order to find out whether a 0.2% solution of bupranolol would yield significantly different results in comparison with the former.--Statistical evaluation, based on variance analysis linked with multiple t-tests, showed a barely significant difference between the pressure-lowering effects of the 1% and 0.2% solutions after one hour, whereas after 2 hours the difference became clearly significant in favour of the 0.2% solution. Furthermore, the 0.2% solution clearly showed a tendency to prolonged duration of effect, beyond the two-hour observation time. It therefore seems justified to supplement the present findings by long-term studies aimed at assessing optimal concentrations of the drug on the one hand, and its long-acting properties on the other. In this way, bupranolol is likely to gain recognition as an antiglaucomatous agent.", 
    "11": "In the isolated, blood-perfused canine atrium preparations, ethanol injected into the cannulated sinus node artery consistently produced dose-dependently negative inotropic effects at a dose range of 0.03 to 1 mmol and negative chronotropic effects starting from 0.1 mmol. Ethanol-induced negative inotropic and chronotropic responses were not blocked by an adequate dose of atropine. When acetaldehyde was given into the sinus node artery, positive inotropic and chronotropic effects were dose-relatedly produced from 0.1 to 30 mumol. Acetaldehyde-induced positive inotropic and chronotropic effects were inhibited by treatment with propranolol. However, these positive effects were not suppressed by either imipramine or tetrodotoxin, although imipramine inhibited tyramine-induced actions and tetrodotoxin suppressed acetylcholine-induced positive chronotropic and inotropic effects in atropine-treated preparations. From these results, it is suggested that ethanol has direct depressant properties on pacemaker and contractile activities, and that acetaldehyde has stimulating properties through adrenergic beta-receptors but neither through tyramine-like action nor nerve excitation.", 
    "12": "A model for the in vitro study of the conversion of thyroxine into triiodothyronine using isolated rat liver parenchymal cells is described. Isolated liver cells (mean protein content 18 mg/ml) convert approximately 0.8% of 1.3 microM exogenously added T4 into T3 during thirty minutes incubation. Carbimazole (50 microM) has no effect on the conversion process, whereas propylthiouracil (50 microM) inhibits the conversion. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent propranolol lowers the conversion ratio when added in concentrations of 580 and 1160 microM, but has no inhibitory effect when 290 microM is added.", 
    "13": "Propranolol alone was given to sixteen hyperthyroid, and concomitantly with thyroxine therapy to ten hypothyroid patients. Following treatment of the hyperthyroid group for 1-2 weeks there was a significant decrease in serum triiodothyronine (T3) which correlated with the plasma propranolol steady state concentration. The serum reverse T3 (rT3) rose significantly. Weight loss ceased in this group while weight gain occurred in patients who had a marked fall in serum T3. One patient with T3 toxicosis went into remission. The reduction in serum T3 was maintained in six patients receiving propranolol for more than 1 month. In the hypothyroid group the mean serum T3 level achieved with 0.15 mg thyroxine per day was significantly lower than in a control group who did not receive propranolol. In five patients following propranolol withdrawal there was a significant rise in T3, a fall in rT3 and TSH, and weight loss. Propranol may therefore have a clinically significant and direct action on the peripheral conversion of thyroxine to T3 and rT3.", 
    "14": "Extracellular potassium activity before and after coronary occlusion was measured in the canine heart by means of potassium-selective surface electrodes. In the ischaemic myocardium potassium activity rapidly increased from a preocclusion value of 3.2 +/- 0.3 mmol.litre-1 to 10 +/- 0.6 mmol.litre-1 within the first 5 min and to about 11.3 +/- 0.5 mmol.litre-1 after 10 min of ischaemia (range from 9.5 to 14.5 mmol.litre-1). Following the initial 10 min of ischaemia no further increase was measured. In the non-ischaemic area potassium activity remained constant. Acute beta-blockade significantly attenuated the initial rate of increase in potassium activity; however, beta-blockade did not influence maximal values of extracellular potassium activity measured after occlusion. Lowering of heart rate by vagal stimulation did not modify the pattern of increase in potassium during acute ischaemia. Following ventricular fibrillation, a slow but continuous rise in potassium activity was found. These results demonstrate that extracellular potassium activity in the acutely ischaemic myocardium is considerably higher than indicated by the technique of coronary vein sampling and is in the range necessary for the development of re-entrant arrhythmias in the early phase after coronary occlusion.", 
    "15": "Eight male schizophrenics were treated in an open study with d.l. propranolol. The dose was increased by 160 mg/day until a maximum of 2,400 mg/day was achieved on day 15, and this remained constant until day 21. Seven patients showed significant clinical evidence of psychiatric improvement, while the incidence of toxic side-effects was low. There was wide inter-patient variation in plasma levels of propranolol. Despite a significant increase of plasma propranolol between day 15 and day 21 of the study, there was no significant change in serum prolactin.", 
    "16": "A possible causal relationship between tissue FFA contents and the depression in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in myocardial ischaemia has been suggested. To test this hypothesis, the effects of different substrates added to the perfusates of hypoxic, low-flow perfused hearts were examined on oxidative phosphorylation catalysed by mitochondria isolated from such tissue. In an additional series of experiments tissue neutral glyceride and FFA levels were analysed and correlated with changes in mitochondrial function. Mitochondria isolated from hearts with a high tissue FFA content exhibited the lowest ADP/O ratios, RCI and QO2 values. On the other hand, mitochondria isolated from hearts with reduced FFA contents, performed significantly better with respect to these parameters of mitochondrial function studied.", 
    "17": "The antihipertensive effect of a diuretic (dihidrochlorothiazide 100-200 mgr.), a betablocker (propranolol 20-180 mgr.) and the vasodilating agent minoxidil (25-70 mgr.), administered daily during 10-16 weeks, was asessed in 18 patients with refractory arterial hypertension (RAH). The arterial blood pressure (mm. of Hg.) differences obtained at the end of a 2 weeks diuretic period and at the end of the triple theraphy period was --53.1 +/- 18.1, p less than or equal to 0.001 (mean, standard deviation and significance) and --26.5 +/- 11.8, p less than or equal to 0.001, for clinostatic sistolic and diastolic pressures, respectively and --45.7 +/- 24.1, p less than or equal to 0.001 and --21.6 +/- 40 (p less than or equal to 0.001) for orthostatic sistolic and diastolic pressures, respectively. 66.6% of cases normalized the blood pressure at the end of the protocol. No significant changes were observed in body weight and pulse rate. In 94.4, 66.6 and 16.6% of cases appeared hypertricosis lanuginosa; edema or palpitations, respectively, as theraphy related symptoms. RAH is an entity of poor prognosis and difficult therapheutic management. In this study a significant antihipertensive response was achieved, which was superior to the one obtained in a similar population treated with other regimens in the same clinic. Despite the opposed attitude to continue the treatment exihibited by most female patients, we believe that minoxidil has enriched the therapheutic armamentarium of this dreadfull type of hypertension.", 
    "18": "The management of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism in pregnancy is discussed and illustrated with appropriate cases. The dangers of the usage of high doses of antithyroid drugs and of propranolol are described.", 
    "19": "1. Noradrenaline and dopamine produce contractions of isolated preparations of vasa deferentia from the rat or the guinea-pig. 2. Dopamine was three to five times as potent as noradrenaline on the rat vas deferens, but was considerably less potent than noradrenaline on the guinea-pig vas deferens. 3. Phentolamine antagonized responses to noradrenaline and dopamine of vasa deferentia of both species. On the rat vas deferens the pA2 values against noradrenaline and dopamine were 7.6 and 7.4, respectively. 4. Pimozide, a dopamine antagonist, antagonized responses to dopamine on vasa deferentia of both species, but was not significantly active in antagonizing responses to noradrenaline. On the rat vas deferens, the pA2 value against dopamine was 7.9. t. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, propranolol and oxprenolol slightly enhanced dopamine-induced contractions on vasa deferentia of both species. 6. It is suggested that dopamine might act on both a-adrenoceptors and dopaminoceptors in the vas deferens, and that the component due to activation of dopaminoceptors is greater in the rat than the guinea-pig.", 
    "20": "1. The temporal relationship between the myocardial arteriovenous difference of plasma propranolol concentration and heart rate and left ventricular dp/dt maximum was examined for 30 min after intravenous administration of 10mg (0.04 mmol) dl-propranolol in nine patients with ischaemic heart disease. 2. Very large positive myocardial a.v. differences of propranolol within the first 5 min became negative after 5 min, indicating a rapid, avid uptake with subsequent release of propranolol from the heart. 3. The heart rate and left ventricular dp/dt maximum increased 1 min after propranolol administration and did not change after the fifth min of the observation period. 4. The data suggest that a large number of unspecific binding sites for propranolol are present in the heart in addition to the specific beta-receptors.", 
    "21": "The rate of net water uptake from the feline small intestine has been investigated during control conditions, during graded infusions of the vasodilator drug isopropylnoradrenaline, and during electrical stimulation of the regional sympathetic nerve fibres to the gut. Net water absorption rate was largely unaffected by intestinal vasodilatation. The fraction of the absorbate transported via the lymphatics remained also constrant at 20-40% of the total absorption regardless of blood flow rate. Stimulating the sympathetic nerve fibres to the small intestine increased, however, net water absorption rate. The increase was particularly pronounced when blood pressure was kept constant during the period of stimulation. The absorption rate was on an average almost doubled at a stimulation frequency of 8 Hz during constant pressure conditions. The mechanism(s) explaining this nervous control of water absorption are tentatively discussed.", 
    "22": "Uterine mucus secretion was studied by measuring carbohydrate release from everted guinea-pig uteri placed in organ baths. Field stimulation of the organ resulted in a significant increase in carbohydrate out-put, this increase was inhibited by tetrodotoxin, scopolamine and previous destruction of the paracervical ganglia. Previous section of the hypogastric nerve reduced the response to field stimulation, while interruption of the costouterine connexion or the pelvic nerve was without overt effect. Stimulation of the hypogastric nerve increased uterine carbohydrate secretion. Pelvic nerve stimulation produced no significant effect. Carbachol increased the carbohydrate secretion to the same extent as did field stimulation. Isoprenaline and methoxamine were without significant effect. It is suggested that certain endometrial cells have a cholinergic sympathetic secretory innervation with pre- and postganglionic fibers running in the hypogastric nerve.", 
    "23": "The practical value of any therapy depends upon a combination of effectiveness of the agent (or procedure) and the extent to which the patient complies in its proper administration. Thus, it might be said that the multiple of effectiveness times compliance equals the \"usefulness product.\" Among the various glaucoma therapies, this product seems to range from about 30%--90%. Timolol's effectiveness in lowering intraocular pressure combined with its low incidence of side effects yields a high usefulness product, and this may decrease the incidence of surgery required for the treatment of the open-angle glaucomas.", 
    "24": "The use of the Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) to assess the safety and efficacy of a new drug or treatment can provide a clear evaluation of the relative benefits and risks of the new therapy as compared to the longer-established treatment methodology. In some cases, such as insulin, the benefits are immediately apparent; in other cases, such as photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, the consensus is not so easily obtained, and the clinical trial can supply the answer. Furthermore, the RCT provides the opportunity to identify adverse reactions, in particular those which present with a seemingly unrelated or unexpected set of symptoms. In conducting clinical trials of timolol, researchers must be alert for beta-adrenergic antagonist effects, such as were seen with practolol, and should be especially careful to note early, mild reactions which may be the forerunners of later, more severe or irreversible adverse effects.", 
    "25": "Timolol ophthalmic solution effectively reduced mean intraocular pressure (IOP) in Negro and Caucasian patients with chronic open angle glaucoma and untreated IOP of 22 mm Hg or higher. No differences in pressure lowering response were observed among the races although the Negroes required somewhat higher timolol concentrations to produce similar reductions from baseline IOP. Negro patients also appeared to have a more severe disease as indicated by the number of prior antiglaucoma drugs required and the untreated (baseline) pressures. An unexpected finding was the significantly greater number of Caucasians with dark irides who were discontinued from therapy because of inadequate pressure reduction.", 
    "26": "Thirty-three eyes of 22 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or severe ocular hypertension had topical timolol maleate added to their maximally tolerated medical regimens. With minimal side effects, 25 eyes (76%) could be treated medically for one year, and only eight eyes (24%) required filtering surgery. Thirteen (39%) of the medically treated eyes achieved intraocular pressures of 21 mm Hg or less. After the addition of timolol, 17 of the 33 eyes (52%) completed the one-year protocol with final mean intraocular pressure decreases of 5 mm Hg or more on medical therapy.", 
    "27": "Of 145 patients registered for an investigation of timolol, 27 patients were dropped for unrelated reasons. Among the remaining 118 patients (212 eyes), a significant reduction in intraocular pressure resulted from twice-a-day topical instillation of 0.25 or 0.5% timolol to ocular hypertensives, primary open-angle glaucoma or aphakic glaucoma patients. Outflow facility improved only slightly, but remained improved throughout the course of this study. A significant reduction in aqueous secretion, however, was the predominant cause of intraocular pressure reduction. Timolol alone controlled intraocular pressure in 87% of ocular hypertensives, in 68% of patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma and in 68% of patients with angle-unobstructed aphakic glaucomas. The addition of epinephrine brought the intraocular pressure to less than 22 mm Hg in 85% of the total group of patients.", 
    "28": "Twelve patients with ischemic heart disease were investigated by right and left heart catheterisation. All patients were studied at rest and during exercise, both before and after administration of beta-blocker propranolol, Inderal (ICI). Left ventricular function decreased after administration of propranolol, but these changes were significant only during exercise. Contractility was depressed after administration of propranolol already at rest. On the other hand, left ventricular filling pressure decreased after administration of propranolol. Our results show the poor reliability of the evaluation of the left ventricular function based solely on the left ventricular filling pressure.", 
    "29": "The distribution and kinetics of D,L-propranolol in rat brain were examined after an intravenous injection of the drug. Measurements in brain areas and blood were performed by means of a sensitive and specific gas liquid chromatographic method. The disappearance rate in cortical areas paralleled that in blood. However D,L-propranolol decreased at a slower rate in hypothalamic and medullary nuclei. Since propranolol is believed to have central hypotensive effects, its retention by certain central nuclei involved in blood pressure regulation is of interest.", 
    "30": "Four patients complaining of erectile dysfunction and using tobacco or propranolol were examined with penile blood pressure measurements and Doppler recordings, calculating the penile acceleration ratio (PAR). After a change in regimen, erectile capacity was restored, PAR returned to normal, and blood pressure measurements revealed increased systolic penile blood pressure in three patients. The changes, especially in PAR, indicate a marked penile vascular reaction during smoking and beta-blocking treatment in these men.", 
    "31": "Changes in blood pressure, heart rate, electrolyte excretion, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were monitored before and after minoxidil was added to a regimen of a diuretic and propranolol hydrochloride in 12 severely hypertensive patients. None required more than 40 mg of minoxidil daily for control. On a constant intake, urinary sodium excretion decreased, while urinary potassium excretion remained stable. Heart rate, body weight, and plasma volume increased, while creatinine clearance did not change. Although plasma renin activity increased fourfold, the plasma aldosterone concentration did not increase. Six subjects were restudied after two months of minoxidil treatment. Although blood pressure control continued to be excellent in these subjects, plasma renin values and plasma volume had returned to pretreatment levels. These studies suggest that minoxidil rapidly and effectively lowers blood pressure. Although sodium retention accompanies minoxidil administration acutely, the effect is independent of aldosterone and may be transient.", 
    "32": "This report concerns two patients with Bartter's syndrome who were treated with propranolol, spironolactone, and potassium supplements. When ibuprofen was added to this regimen, potassium supplements were no longer required. In both patients, plasma renin activity decreased, plasma volumes increased, and a \"catch-up\" in linear growth ensued. This report confirms others that indicate prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors are a useful adjunct in the therapy of Bartter's syndrome.", 
    "33": "In anuric dogs K loaded by infusion of 2 mEq of KCl per kg per hr the quantity of K transferred to intracellular fluid in ureter-ligated animals is considerably less than in nephrectomized ones; the combination of ureter ligation and hyperkalemia seems to suppress transmembrane K transfer. In the present investigation we found that treatment of K loaded ureter-ligated dogs with epinephrine markedly increased the animals' ability to transfer K to intracellular fluid, and that administration of propranolol (with and without epinephrine) reduced K transfer capacity below the control level. Further, we found that propranolol treatment of K-loaded nephrectomized dogs produced a striking diminution of K transfer ability. The data suggest that beta adrenergic receptors are importantly involved in the transmembrane K transfer of K-loaded anuric dogs, and that ureter ligation and hyperkalemia suppress K transfer capacity by blocking beta receptors.", 
    "34": "Penbutolol, a nonselective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, induced reduction of exercise-induced heartbeats for at least 24 hr after a single 40-mg oral dose, and was equipotent with respect to a 2 X 20-mg regimen over the same period. Ingestion for 7 days did not influence the pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics of penbutolol, and there was no cumulation of drug in serum. A relationship was found between the logarithms of measurable serum concentrations of penbutolol and the percentage reduction of total heartbeats. Absorption of oral penbutolol appeared to be reduced when administered in the evening. Since beta-adrenoceptor activity was relatively unchanged between 13 and 24 hr after a single 40-mg dose of penbutolol, there is a possibility that an active metabolite or metabolites may contribute to prolonged duration of action.", 
    "35": "We describe an analysis for propranolol in plasma, with use of reversed-phase \"high-pressure\" liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection. Pronethalol is used as the internal standard. The procedure, which involves extraction into an organic solvent, evaporation, and clean-up by micro-scale back extraction from hexane into an aqueous phase, is specific and sensitive. The detection limit is less than 6 microgram/L (2.3 X 10(-8) mol/L). Within-day and between-day coefficients of variation are 1.8 and 4.4%, respectively. Commonly used drugs, including procainamide, N-acetylprocainamide, and quinidine, do not interfere.", 
    "36": "Electrophysiologic studies were performed in a 41 year old man for analysis of paroxysmal tachycardias appearing in various electrocardiographic patterns of supraventricular and ventricular bigeminy, junctional and ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, among others. All these arrhythmias were due to dual atrioventricular (A-V) nodal pathways with simultaneous dual fast and slow conduction of single atrial beats at a normal basic sinus rate. Moderate changes in sinus rate and in fast or slow pathway conduction times, or both, changed the position of the slowly conducted beats between the neighboring two fast conducted beats and resulted in various electrocardiographic manifestations of the conduction disturbance. Different blocks, such as second degree type 1, 2:1, 3:1 and possibly also type II, in one of the two pathways and occasionally aberrant conduction induced even more unusual tracings. After intravenous injection of 25 mg of ajmaline, unexpected lengthening and shortening of the A-H interval occurred, suggesting variable shifts between fast and slow pathway conduction. The incidence of dual A-V nodal pathways is discussed; it was documented in 17 (4.2 percent) of 405 patients studied. A theoretical model of A-V nodal conduction is proposed to explain its normal properties and abnormal patterns.", 
    "37": "With information obtained from the hypertensive workup (described in part 1 of this article), the physician devises a treatment plan. A stepped-care approach is generally favored, with a diuretic, an adrenergic blocker, and a vasodilator being added in turn until blood pressure is brought under control. The indications and contraindications, dosages, and side effects of the most commonly used antihypertensive agents are discussed here, with suggestions for increasing compliance.", 
    "38": "In 1976, 130 patients aged 70 or older were admitted to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) at Toronto Western Hospital. Arrhythmias were noted in all but 24 percent. Digoxin was given to 53 patients, lidocaine to 24, propranolol to 28, and quinidine to 11. In 2 patients, cardioversion by direct current was required for supraventricular arrhythmias. In 26 patients, temporary pacemakers were used. Of 13 patients who experienced at least one cardiac arrest in the CCU, 10 survived to be discharged to the ward. In total, only 12 of the 130 elderly patients died in the hospital, and in only 3 of these was arrhythmia the primary cause of death. The treatment of arrhythmias in the elderly is as successful and rewarding as in younger patients. Indications for the various antiarrhythmic drugs are similar. Except for digoxin, the dosages of such drugs for the elderly are the same as those for younger patients. Adverse effects apparently are not more common in the elderly.", 
    "39": "What regulates the activity of the central nervous renin-angiotensin system is not known. To define whether control of this central system is linked to that in the periphery, simultaneous blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples for measurement of immunoreactive angiotensin II were drawn from anesthetized dogs during hemorrhage, furosemide-induced volume depletion, insulin-hypoglycemia, beta-adrenergic blockade and saline infusion. Despite vigorous increments or decrements in plasma innunoreactive angiotensin II, CSF levels remained stable. Since immunoreactive angiotensin II in dog CSF is claimed to be mainly the heptapeptide des-Asp1-angiotensin II (angiotensin III), the possibility that the level of this peptide within CSF simply reflects plasma concentrations was assessed by infusing angiotensin III (2.5 and 25 ng/kg/min intravenously, each for 60 minutes) and monitoring plasma and CSF peptide levels. Whereas plasma immunoreactive angiotensin II levels increased appropriately across the infusions, no change in CSF levels was observed. These studies indicate the angiotensin III does not cross the blood-CSF barrier, at least in the short term.", 
    "40": "Of 82 patients with medically refractory unstable angina pectoris seen between October 1972 and January 1978, 60 patients underwent a combination of intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation, cardiac catheterization and coronary revascularization. Most patients had atherosclerotic involvement of the vessels of the anterior left ventricular wall, 48 patients (80 percent) had abnormalities of left ventricular wall contraction and 22 patients (36 percent) had evidence of acute myocardial injury. One operative and one late death occurred. The perioperative infarction rate was 5 percent. Survivors, followed up for 3 to 63 months (mean 31 months), have done remarkably well; 77 percent are considered employable,and more than 90 percent are in functional class I or II.", 
    "41": "The binding of 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate, a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, of 3H-dihydroalprenolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist, and of 3H-flunitrazepam, a ligand which labels benzodiazepine receptors, was examined in several regions of control and Friedreich's ataxia (FA) brains. 3H-Quinuclidinyl benzilate binding appeared to increase in the inferior olivory nucleus, anterior and posterior cerebellar vermi but was unaltered in the dentate nucleus and cerebellar hemisphere of FA brain. The binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol seemed to increase in the inferior olivary nucleus yet was not different from controls in the dentate nucleus, cerebellar hemisphere, anterior and posterior cerebellar vermi of FA brains. 3H-Flunitrazepam binding was slightly lowered in the inferior olivary and dentate nuclei but was unchanged in the other FA brain regions examined. The present study suggests possible trends in neurotransmitter receptor alterations in post-mortem brain tissue of FA patients.", 
    "42": "Propranolol at concentrations of 1 x 10(-6) to 1 x 10(-4) M consistently increased neutrophil motility as measured in Boyden chambers. The effects were not due solely to stimulation of random migration and chemokinesis but also of directional motility. Propranolol, over a similar concentration range, caused inhibition of post-phagocytic cell metabolic activity (hexose monophosphate shunt, nitro-blue tetrazolium reduction and protein iodination) without any detectable effect on the ingestion rate of Candida albicans. Atenolol had no effect on any of these neutrophil functions. Both drugs were without effect on glycolysis and intracellular cyclic AMP levels. Propranolol however, at concentrations which stimulated cell motility, caused increased intracellular cyclic GMP levels. It is suggested that propranolol may stimulate neutrophil motility by promoting increased intracellular cyclic GMP levels or by decreasing neutrophil superoxide production.", 
    "43": "Timolol, which binds to beta-adrenergic receptors, is a potent antagonist of the catecholamine-stimulated synthesis of cyclic AMP. However, the actual mechanism of action by which timolol reduces intraocular pressure is not readily apparent. Compared to its efficacy in human eyes, the drug is relatively ineffective in rabbit eyes. A reasonable postulate is that soon after administration, timolol blocks endogenous adrenergic stimulation contributing to the formation of aqueous humor by the ciliary processes. Nevertheless, the long-lasting reduction of intraocular pressure persists at a time when the drug is no longer bound to beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "44": "Thirty-one eyes of 20 glaucomatous patients on maximum medication were treated with timolol drops for a mean period of 9 months. Adequate levels of control of intraocular pressures were obtained in 21 eyes. No significant ocular or systemic side effects were noted. Timolol has an additive effect in further lowering intraocular pressures in patients being treated with a combination of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, pilocarpine, epinephrine, and the anticholinesterases.", 
    "45": "The recent introduction of newer scintillation cameras, convenient radiopharmaceuticals and innovative data-processing systems has hastened the use of radionuclide methods in the evaluation of cardiac function. This review familiarizes the primary internist with physics and instrumentation required in understanding cardiovascular nuclear images. Basic principles underlying the gated cardiac blood-pool scan and the first-pass study are described. Authoritative references are given to readers seeking more complete information. The major emphasis of the review, however, is on the clinical applications of these techniques. The role of these noninvasive methods in myocardial infarction, diagnosis and prognosis of ischemic heart disease, assessment of cardiomyopathies, study of idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis and left atrial myxoma is discussed. Finally, mention is made of newer applications: evaluation of nitroglycerin action on viable but ischemic myocardium and determination of the hemodynamic effects of propranolol in patients with coronary-artery disease.", 
    "46": "Chronically instrumented awake dogs were used to study the effects of nitroglycerin and propranolol on the transmural distribution of myocardial blood flow during transient ischemia. Studies were carried out 7-14 d after implantation of an electromagnetic flowmeter probe and balloon occluder on the left circumflex coronary artery, placement of epicardial minor axis sonar crystals, and implantation of left atrial, left ventricular, and aortic catheters. The occluder was inflated to completely interrupt flow for 10 s followed by partial release to reestablish flow at 60% of the preocclusion level. During this partial release, which served as the control for the study, regional myocardial blood flow was measured with 7- to 10-mum radioactive microspheres. After control measurements, seven dogs were given nitroglycerin (0.4 mg i.v.) and eight dogs propranolol (0.2 mg/kg i.v.). 5 min later the occlusion and partial release sequence was repeated, and regional myocardial blood flow was measured when heart rate, aortic and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and minor axis diameter were unchanged from control values.The data values were selected so that total flow to the ischemic region during partial release after nitroglycerin or propranolol administration was not significantly different from flow during the control partial release. After nitroglycerin administration, endocardial flow (endo) in the ischemic region increased from 0.46+/-0.07 to 0.59+/-0.06 ml/min per g (P < 0.006); epicardial flow (epi) decreased from 0.78+/-0.09 to 0.70+/-0.08 ml/min per g (P < 0.04). The endo:epi ratio increased from 0.65+/-0.07 to 0.92+/-0.10 (P < 0.05). In contrast, administration of propranolol produced no significant change in transmural flow (endo, 0.42+/-0.02 and 0.46+/-0.03 ml/min per g; epi, 0.71+/-0.06 and 0.70+/-0.07 ml/min per g) or in the endo:epi ratio (0.60+/-0.03, 0.66+/-0.06) in the ischemic region. Nitroglycerin and propranolol produce different effects on the transmural distribution of blood flow to ischemic myocardium. Nitroglycerin can increase blood flow to the underperfused endocardium in the absence of alterations in heart size, hemodynamic parameters, and total transmural flow to the ischemic region. Under similar conditions, propranolol has no significant effect on the transmural distribution of blood flow to an ischemic region.", 
    "47": "Of 60 patients receiving intraaortic balloon counterpulsation for angina refractory to maximal medical therapy, a subgroup of 10 patients underwent left ventricular angiography both with and without counterpulsation. Severe stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery was present in all 10 patients. Counterpulsation resulted in a significant decrease in systolic and end-diastolic left ventricular pressures and no increase in cardiac index. Left ventricular diastolic and systolic volume, ejection fraction and regional contraction patterns, often abnormal, were unchanged. However, mean normalized systolic ejection rate was improved by the addition of counterpulsation. It is concluded that intraaortic balloon counterpulsation has relatively little effect on the left ventricular volume of patients with medically refractory angina pectoris. The symptomatic improvement that takes place seems to occur mainly through the effect of counterpulsation on preload and afterload.", 
    "48": "Three beta-adrenoceptor antagonists--atenolol (A), metoprolol (M), and pamatolol (P)--were examined with respect to their effects on isoproterenol responses of isolated right atria and portal veins from rats. With all three blockers at concentrations of 10(-7), 10(-6), and 10(-5) M, the chronotropic atrial responses indicated a linear relation with slope of 1 for log (dose ratio - 1) versus log[blocker]. The following pA2 values were obtained: A = 7.14, M = 7.51, P = 7.56. Inhibition of spontaneous contractions in portal veins by isoproterenol was studied after alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by phenoxybenzamine. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were used at 10(-6), 10(-5), and 10(-4) M in these experiments. Only with P did the relation log (dose ratio-1) versus log[blocker] show a slope near unity, whereas A and M gave slopes significantly less than 1. Intercepts of the regression lines with the abscissa corresponded to pA2 values of A = 6.01, M = 6.51, P = 5.54. The results indicate that all three substances are \"cardioselective\" beta-adrenoceptor antagonists devoid of intrinsic beta-stimulatory action. A and M show a comparable degree of cardioselectivity, whereas P is more selective."
