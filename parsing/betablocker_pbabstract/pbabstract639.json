    "0": "The age-dependent differences in the involvement of alpha-adrenoceptors in the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine (Phe) were examined in isolated atria of male Wistar rats 6 weeks (6W), 10 weeks and 7 months (7M) of age. The maximal increase in tension development induced by Phe increased with age, whereas the EC50 values for the positive inotropic effect of Phe did not change with age. The inhibitory effect of phentolamine on the response to Phe increased with age. Propranolol caused only slight inhibition of the effect of Phe in both 6W and 7M rats, and the EC50 values for Phe in the presence of propranolol did not change significantly with age. The EC50 values for isoprenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine in 7M rats were higher than those in 6W rats. In 7M rats, the duration of the tension development was only slightly affected by Phe in the presence or absence of propranolol, but it was markedly decreased by Phe in the presence of phentolamine. The dose-response curve for Phe was markedly shifted to the left by papaverine in 6W rats, but slightly in 7M rats. The dose-response curve for isoprenaline was markedly shifted to the left by papaverine in both groups. These results are consistent with effects of Phe being mediated by both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in both 6W and 7M rats, but there is a shift in the balance from rather more beta-receptors in the young animals to more alpha-receptors in the adults.", 
    "1": "Effects of propranolol on coronary artery were investigated in isolated dog coronary arteries and in isolated hearts of rats and guinea-pigs. Cumulative administration of dl-propranolol produced concentration-dependent relaxation of coronary arterial strips under potassium-contracture. There was no difference in relaxant potency between the optical isomers of propranolol. Lidocaine produced less relaxation than dl-propranolol, while atenolol and practolol scarcely affected the contraction. dl-Propranolol-induced relaxation was significantly restored by additional calcium or prevented by prior administration of calcium. In isolated hearts of rats and guinea-pigs which were perfused at a constant coronary inflow and paced at a constant rate, bolus administration of dl-propranolol produced dose-dependent falls in coronary perfusion pressure without significant changes in myocardial contractile force. Results indicate that propranolol may have relaxant activities on coronary arteries through inhibition of calcium influx in the cell membrane of coronary arterial smooth muscle.", 
    "2": "The effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve stimulation on resistance to flow in the proximal urethra was examined in male, chloralose-anesthetized cats. Hypogastric (sympathetic) nerve stimulation increased urethral resistance, an effect that was blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist prazosin (0.1 mg/kg), reduced 50% by ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium (0.4 to 0.6 mg/min) and potentiated by the beta-adrenergic antagonist sotalol (5 mg/kg). In the presence of phenylephrine-induced constrictions of the urethra, hypogastric nerve stimulation decreased resistance by a sotalol-sensitive, hexamethonium-resistant mechanism. The results imply that sympathetic stimulation can either raise or lower urethral resistance under different conditions, and that the organization of the nerves mediating the two types of response differs. Because pelvic nerve stimulation produced small and inconsistent responses, the parasympathetic input was instead activated by sacral ventral root stimulation. Sacral stimulation produced an atropine-sensitive constriction when basal urethral resistance was low, and dilatation when resistance was high. The latter response was reduced by atropine, but was resistant to sotalol. However, the decrease in resistance produced by acetylcholine in the presence of PE was not reduced by atropine, implying that acetylcholine-induced dilatation of the urethra is not due to activation of muscarinic receptors on smooth muscle. It is hypothesized that parasympathetic dilatation of the urethra may be mediated by a non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic inhibitory transmitter released from post-ganglionic neurons. A muscarinic mechanism may be involved in this response either to potentiate the action of the unknown transmitter or to facilitate the ganglionic excitation of these neurons. Parasympathetic constrictor responses can be attributed to activation of postganglionic cholinergic neurons.", 
    "3": "A familial presentation of torsade de pointes is described. The propositus had recurrent syncope, documented torsade de pointes, a normal Q-T, and close coupled premature ventricular beats initiating the paroxysmal arrhythmia. The mother had sporadic syncope without documented torsade de pointes, a normal Q-T, and closely coupled premature ventricular beats. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated reproducible inducible torsade de pointes tachycardia in both patients. Serial drug testing in both revealed suppression of induced torsade de pointes with oral propranolol. Chronic oral propranolol resulted in clinical cure in both patients.", 
    "4": "The effect of oral pindolol 15 mg daily was compared with placebo in 529 patients who had electrical and/or mechanical complications after an acute myocardial infarction. The study was multicentric (five in Sweden, two in Australia) and patients were allocated in a stratified manner to placebo (266 patients) or pindolol (263 patients). Treatment was started 1--21 days after infarction and patients were followed for 2 years. Forty-seven patients (17.7%) in the placebo group and 45 patients (17.1%) in the pindolol group died. In patients who commenced therapy later than 5 days after myocardial infarction mortality was 18% lower in the pindolol group and there was an even greater difference in patients who commenced therapy after 12 days. Patients who were on digitalis therapy had a lower mortality if treated with pindolol. The apparent improvement in prognosis in patients treated in Sweden compared to Australia may have been due to later entry of patients. This study suggests that improvement in prognosis when beta blocking drugs are given after myocardial infarction may only apply to certain groups of patients. No benefit is gained by commencing an oral beta blocking drug immediately and such therapy need not be started before 1 week or more after the myocardial infarct.", 
    "5": "We previously reported that a low threshold action of norepinephrine (NE) on the cerebellar circuitry is expressed as an amplification of the inhibitory action of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) on Purkinje cell activity. Here we examined the effects of locus coeruleus (LC) stimulation on \"off-beam\" inhibitions of Purkinje cell firing induced by activation of local basket and stellate cell interneurons to determine whether endogenous NE, released from synaptic terminals, could induce a comparable enhancement of GABA-mediated synaptic input to these neurons. Stimulation of LC, at current intensities which by themselves were subthreshold for directly affecting background activity of Purkinje neurons, markedly increased off-beam inhibitory neuronal responses. Iontophoretic application of the beta-adrenergic blocker sotalol reversibly antagonized this enhancement of synaptic inhibition. In comparison, the potentiative effects observed with LC stimulation were increased by iontophoresis of the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine. LC -induced increases in off-beam inhibition were not observed after destruction of cerebellar noradrenergic terminals by 6-hydroxydopamine. These results suggest that noradrenergic input from the LC can augment the efficacy of conventional GABA-mediated inputs synapsing on the Purkinje cell.", 
    "6": "One hundred consecutive patients requiring propranolol hydrochloride before undergoing isolated aortocoronary bypass procedures were examined. In half the patients, propranolol therapy was discontinued, whereas the other half continued to receive intraoperative and postoperative propranolol regardless of clinical events. Although there were no preoperative differences in the apparent degree of coronary arterial disease or left ventricular function in the two groups, postoperative supraventricular arrhythmias were less frequent in the propranolol-treated group, most noticeably in those receiving less than 320 mg preoperatively. In patients who had received large preoperative doses (greater than or equal to 320 mg/day), there were no significant differences in postoperative supraventricular tachycardias. Continued propranolol therapy following isolated coronary bypass surgery appears to be a safe and efficacious method of decreasing the incidence of postoperative supraventricular tachycardias.", 
    "7": "The effect on renal function of a combination of a beta 2 receptors stimulating tokolytic agent (Fenoterol) with a so-called cardioselective beta 1 blocker (Metoprolol) which is able to antagonise the cardiac side effects of beta 2 stimulation, was examined in femaLe rabbits in a 24-hour test. Infusing 31.5 ml/h isotonic solution, 20 micrograms/kg/min Fenoterol and 3.125 micrograms/kg/min Metoprolol, excretion, creatinine clearance, electrolyte elimination, the serum electrolyte levels, Hb, HK and the weight were determined. The combination of Fenoterol and Metoprolol antagonised almost completely the massive water retention occurring under Fenoterol alone. At the latest after 12 hours, normal values were obtained in respect of the creatinine clearance reduced under Fenoterol, the urine excretion rate and, consequently, the Hb concentration and haematocrit reading. The reduction of sodium elimination caused by Fenoterol was completely reversed under the combination, whereas the reduced excretion of potassium was not influenced. Water retention in tocolysis with beta 2 stimulants is one of the most important causes for the information of a pulmonary oedema. The danger of the occurrence of such pulmonary oedemas, especially in risk pregnancies (gestosis), is drastically reduced by antagonising water retention, and hence the combination of Fenoterol and Metoprolol seems to be very favourable from both the cardiac and renal viewpoints. In a group of 17 pregnant women, the drastic improvement of urine excretion under the combination could be confirmed.", 
    "8": "Eighteen patients, most of them plethoric, exhibiting stage I, II or III permanent essential hypertension, were treated following reduction of their weight excess with moderate doses of butofilolol. The minimum duration of treatment was 6 months; 5 patients received the drug for more than 1 year, and the last 3 for more than 18 months. An antihypertensive effect of butofilolol was observed in 11 of 18 cases. It was deemed very good or good in 9 patients, i.e. 50 p. cent; this is the usual rate of efficacy of beta-blocking agents in this indication. The effective dose, administered as 1 or 2 daily doses, is 200 mg/day on an average (range 75-300). No true manifestation of clinical or biological intolerance was recorded, although the patients were continued on low-calorie diets, and some of them showed disturbances of glycoregulation. It is the author's opinion that butofilolol constitute a good therapeutic approach to hypertension in plethoric subjects, when the weight reduction has failed to correct it adequately--if at all.", 
    "9": "Twenty-one patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease were treated with carbimazole 30 mg daily, given as a single dose. Propranolol was also given for the first 3 weeks. All became clinically euthyroid with normal serum thyroxine (T4) levels, usually within 1-3 months. Patients with large goitres and raised serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations took longer to respond. In 19 patients a positive thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) response to intravenous thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) developed. Carbimazole was stopped soon after (median time of treatment 18 weeks, range 9-41 weeks) and 18 patients have been followed. Seven of these (39%) have remained in remission from hyperthyroidism for more than one year (median 77 weeks). Carbimazole 30 mg once daily is a convenient and effective treatment for hyperthyroid Graves' disease. Many patients will achieve prolonged remissions if treatment is stopped when serum T3 and T4 levels are in the low-normal range, usually 2-4 months after clinical euthyroidism has been reached.", 
    "10": "Great advances have been made in our understanding of cardiac arrhythmias and the effect of drugs on these arrhythmias. Several new types of antiarrhythmic drugs have been introduced. For example, encainide, flecainide, or lorcainide are new type I drugs that exert their major effects on depressing cardiac conduction. These drugs appear to be very effective for suppression of premature ventricular contractions. The introduction of verapamil (a calcium antagonist) allows for rapid control of supraventricular arrhythmias by virtue of its effects on the slow-channel (predominately Ca++) receptors. New beta-blocking drugs have been introduced which may prove beneficial in certain clinical situations since they exert more selective blockade of the cardiac receptors (beta1) as opposed to smooth muscle receptors (beta2). Amiodarone is an extremely potent drug which is effective for both supraventricular as well as ventricular arrhythmias. The major cellular electrophysiologic effect of this drug is to prolong the action potential duration. Its major clinical drawback is the rather formidable long-term side effects which include corneal opacities, thyroid dysfunction, neurologic toxicity, and pulmonary fibrosis.", 
    "11": "Radionuclide angiography permits evaluation of left ventricular performance during exercise. There are several factors that may affect the results in normal subjects and in patients with chronic coronary heart disease. Important among these are the selection criteria: age, sex, level of exercise, exercise end points, ejection fraction at rest and effects of pharmacologic agents. An abnormal ejection fraction response to exercise is not a specific marker for coronary heart disease but may be encountered in other cardiac diseases. In addition to the diagnostic considerations, important prognostic data can be obtained. Further studies are needed to determine the prognostic implications of anatomic findings versus the functional abnormalities induced by exercise in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "12": "Atenolol 100 mg once daily and metoprolol SA 200 mg once daily were compared in 20 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, in a randomised, double-blind cross-over trial. Blood pressure and heart rate were compared at rest and during maximal exercise on a bicycle ergometer at 2 and 24 h post-dose. Blood pressure control was similar with both drugs, except at 2 h when systolic blood pressure was significantly lower with atenolol. Blood pressure and heart rate were less well controlled at 24 h than at 2 h with both drugs, but the majority of patients were still considered adequately controlled at 24 h. Atenolol and metoprolol SA can be considered equally effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension and can be recommended as a once daily regime.", 
    "13": "In the preceding report, the kinetics of formation of N-nitrosopropranolol (NNP) from propranolol and inorganic nitrite were determined in solutions of hydrochloric acid over the range of pH similar to that found in the human stomach. In this communication, NNP formation was examined in human gastric juice and in the presence of organic nitrate ester vasodilator drugs. In comparison to HCl solutions, equivalent concentrations of propranolol and nitrite produced similar amounts of NNP in gastric juice; however, the yield increased as the pH was lowered and the kinetics of nitrosamine formation were different. Endogenous nitrite concentrations in 22 samples of human gastric juice were below the minimum concentration (10(-5) M) required for production of detectable levels of NNP. Maximal therapeutic dosages of propranolol (10(-2) M) incubated with isosorbide dinitrate (3,4-6.8 X 10(-3) M) or nitroglycerin (8.6 X 10(-4) M) also failed to produce NNP. However, NNP formed adventitiously during the concentration of aqueous and methylene chloride solutions that contained propranolol and organic nitrates, underscoring the importance of avoiding artifactual formation of nitrosamines. Furthermore, synthetic NNP was not mutagenic in either the Ames tester strains (TA92, TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538) or the hepatocyte-mediated mammalian cell mutagenesis assay. We conclude that NNP is unlikely to form in the stomach under conditions normally present in patients. Moreover, even if NNP formed under exceptional circumstances, this compound is unlikely to be a carcinogen. With respect to the potential formation of nitrosamines during drug dissolution in the stomach, long-term therapy with propranolol hydrochloride appears to be safe.", 
    "14": "Alternate medications for the treatment of Tourette syndrome are required because haloperidol in some patients either may be ineffective or may cause disturbing side effects. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, has been reported as effective, in uncontrolled trials, in ameliorating symptoms of tic disorder, tardive dyskinesia, and drug-induced extrapyramidal syndrome. Propranolol, in doses up to 120 mg per day, was administered to five patients with Tourette syndrome in a placebo-controlled study and was found ineffective in ameliorating symptoms of Tourette syndrome. Results underscored the importance of placebo-controlled investigation when evaluating the effects of drugs in Tourette syndrome.", 
    "15": "In this study, the relation between renin activity and therapeutic response to hydrochlorothiazide or propranolol was studied. Patients with a diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 114 mm Hg were treated with propranolol (40 to 320 mg twice daily) or hydrochlorothiazide (25 to 100 mg twice daily). The initial renin profiles were: low, 56 percent (n = 300); normal, 33 percent (n = 174); high, 11 percent (n = 60). A greater incidence of low and fewer high renin profiles (p less than 0.001) were observed in blacks. After furosemide administration (40 mg intravenously), 55 percent of patients (n = 291) had a low renin response and 45 percent (n = 240) had a normal renin response. No correlation between renin profile and renin response was observed, although low renin response and low renin profile occurred more frequently in older patients. Hydrochlorothiazide administration resulted in a greater decrement in diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05) in the total group. Irrespective of renin activity, both hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol reduced diastolic blood pressure. When renin profile was considered, no significant variation in response to hydrochlorothiazide therapy was observed, and there was a greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure in the patients with a high renin profile receiving propranolol. In comparing therapeutic response, patients with a low renin profile had a better response to hydrochlorothiazide, and propranolol was more effective in patients with a high renin profile. The anticipated effect of therapy on plasma renin activity was observed. Although these results are consistent with a volume-vasoconstrictor analysis of hypertension, the results of therapy could not have been prejudged from renin profile or responsivity. The slight differences observed do not warrant the expense of renin determinations when a simple determination of therapeutic response is sufficient.", 
    "16": "After five years' extensive use of cimetidine, drug interactions have emerged as one of its major adverse effects. Clinically important interactions with warfarin, phenytoin, diazepam, chlormethiazole, propranolol, lidocaine, and a number of other drugs have been reported. An appreciation of the variety of underlying mechanisms, inhibition of drug metabolism, decreased liver blood flow, and altered drug distribution should reduce the risk of further drug interactions with cimetidine.", 
    "17": "Long-term beta-blockade is said to increase the number of beta-receptors. The effect of beta-blockers could therefore be reduced after long use. We tested this hypothesis in nine healthy subjects given 15 mg pindolol daily for 4 wk. Plasma concentrations (measured fluorometrically), isoproterenol dose-response relationship (to calculate the dose needed to increase heart rate by 25 bpm), renin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were measured several times before and after the first and last dose. Kinetic parameters remained stable: total clearance (Cltot) = 45.2 and 42.9 l/hr, and Vdss = 205.8 and 198.6 l after the first and last dose. The concentration-effect relationship, plotted as the \"dose ratio minus one\" against the log of the plasma concentration was identical after 4 wk. Basal plasma renin activity was reduced slightly and the increase of stimulated plasma renin was blunted by pindolol even after 4 wk. The initial lowering of unstimulated renin by pindolol in the first 2 hr after dosing was not detectable after 4 wk. Epinephrine and norepinephrine levels in plasma were not changed initially nor after 4 wk. It is concluded that pindolol has a stable kinetic profile over time and that its beta-blockade does not induce tachyphylaxis.", 
    "18": "The results from the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial for patients ages 60-69 years indicate a significant beneficial effect of propranolol and an overall reduction in mortality of 33%. This beneficial effect appears to begin early and continues through 3 years of follow-up. Examination of patient complaints and medical reasons for withdrawing study medication indicates that side effects resulting from propranolol use were infrequent in both the younger and older age groups, and there were no major differences between the two groups. Given these results, and considering the large number of hospital-diagnosed myocardial infarctions that occur each year in persons older than 60 years of age, it appears that the use of propranolol, where not contraindicated, could delay mortality in a substantial number of older postinfarction patients.", 
    "19": "We carried out a double-blind, randomized study, based at The Academic Department of Cardiology in Newcastle upon Tyne, to compare the effect of sotalol 320 mg once daily with that of placebo in patients from 20 hospitals who survived an acute myocardial infarction. Treatment was started 5-14 days after infarction in 1456 patients; 60% were randomized to sotalol and 40% to placebo. This represented 45% of those evaluated for entry. All patients were followed for 12 months and the analysis was done on an \"intention-to-treat\" principle. Sixty-four patients (7.3%) in the sotalol group died, compared with 52 (8.9%) in the placebo group. Although the mortality rate was 18% lower in the sotalol group, the difference was not statistically significant. There was a significant reduction in confirmed reinfarction, but not in all suspected reinfarctions.", 
    "20": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of propranolol was carried out in 560 high-risk survivors of myocardial infarction enrolled at 12 Norwegian hospitals. The main purpose of the study was to determine the effect of propranolol, 160 mg/day, on the incidence of sudden cardiac death over 12 months. The patients were randomized 4-6 days after the acute event. A statistically significant reduction in sudden cardiac deaths of 52% was noted (11 deaths in the propranolol group and 23 in the placebo group). Four placebo patients and one propranolol patient were successfully resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation. In addition, less severe ventricular arrhythmias were significantly more common among the placebo-treated patients. Twenty-five patients in the treatment group and 37 in the control group died (p = 0.11). Severe adverse effects of the drug were uncommon in this high-risk population. The findings support the results of the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial and other long-term beta-blocker trials in survivors of myocardial infarction.", 
    "21": "The Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of propranolol therapy in 3837 men and women with acute myocardial infarction. The patients began their treatment 5-21 days after hospital admission (mean 13.8 days). During an average follow-up of 25 months, there were statistically significant reductions in total mortality (26%), cardiovascular mortality (26%), arteriosclerotic heart disease (27%), sudden death (28%) and coronary incidence (definite nonfatal reinfarction plus coronary heart disease mortality) (23%). There was no group difference in incidence of congestive heart failure. Of the many potential side effects that were monitored, broncho-spasm, cold hands and feet, and fatigue occurred more frequently in the propranolol group. Propranolol not only reduced coronary mortality and morbidity, but also was administered with a great degree of safety. Based on these results, its use is recommended for at least 3 years in patients with no contraindications to beta blockade who have had a recent myocardial infarction.", 
    "22": "The Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that tested the effectiveness of propranolol in reducing the mortality rate in patients after myocardial infarction (MI). Twenty-four hour ambulatory ECG monitoring was done on 3279 of the 3837 enrolled patients at baseline (5-21 days after hospital admission) and repeated after 6 weeks of therapy in a random sample of 25% of the study population. Ventricular arrhythmias were divided into seven different categories and the prevalence of each category is presented. Ventricular arrhythmia at baseline appears to increase with patient age, past history of myocardial infarction, and use of diuretics. Other selected variables--sex, CPK ratio and history of smoking, diabetes and hypertension--appear to be less clearly associated with ventricular arrhythmia. Paired data analysis performed on 826 patients who had ambulatory electrocardiograms both at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment showed an increased prevalence of ventricular arrhythmia at 6 weeks. This increase was blunted by propranolol therapy.", 
    "23": "In this study, 1884 patients who were selected from 3647 consecutive patients who survived at least 6 days after an acute myocardial infarction were randomized to double-blind treatment with either placebo or timolol and followed for 12-33 months. One hundred fifty-two patients in the placebo group and 98 in the timolol group died. The life-table cumulative probability of total death was 21.9% in the placebo group and 13.3% in the timolol group, corresponding to a relative reduction of 39.4% (p = 0.0003). One hundred thirty-one nonfatal reinfarctions were confirmed in the placebo group and 90 were confirmed in the timolol group, including events among withdrawn patients. The life-table probability rate of reinfarction was 16.4% in the placebo and 11.8% in the timolol group (p = 0.001). We conclude that chronic treatment with timolol in survivors of acute myocardial infarction who can tolerate beta-adrenergic blockade is effective in reducing both total mortality and reinfarction over 33 months.", 
    "24": "In the G\u00f6teborg Metoprolol Trial, 1395 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were, on admission, randomly allocated to double-blind treatment, 697 to placebo and 698 to metoprolol (15 mg i.v. + 200 mg/day) for 90 days. During this period, there were 62 deaths in the placebo group (8.9%) and 40 in the metoprolol group (5.7%), a mortality reduction of 36% (p less than 0.03). This effect persisted regardless of age, previous infarction or previous chronic beta blockade. All deaths were classified as cardiovascular. After 3 months, all patients were recommended open treatment with metoprolol, and the difference in mortality between the two groups was maintained after 1 year. Early institution of metoprolol (within 12 hours) influenced infarct development during the first 3 days (infarct diagnosis and indirect measures of infarct size). Metoprolol also reduced the incidence on fatal and nonfatal infarction during the next 4-90 days by 35%. Furthermore, fewer episodes of ventricular fibrillation were recorded in the metoprolol than in the placebo group (six vs 17 patients). The tolerance was judged to be very good. The same percentage of patients (19%) was withdrawn from the blind treatment in the two groups. Fewer patients in the metoprolol group used lidocaine, furosemide and analgesics. We conclude that metoprolol therapy instituted on admission in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction reduced 3-month mortality and exerted beneficial clinical effects.", 
    "25": "The Timolol Myocardial Infarction Study was a completely randomized program of 1884 survivors of myocardial infarction comparing timolol maleate, 10 mg twice daily, with placebo for the secondary prevention of sudden death and reinfarction. In that study, timolol maleate reduced total mortality (152 placebo vs 98 timolol) and the incidence of first nonfatal reinfarctions (131 placebo vs 90 timolol). This report evaluates the effect of timolol in selected categories--age, sex, infarction site, heart size, transmural infarction, diabetes, smoking, multiple reinfarctions and pulse. These data document two important facts. First, the effects of timolol in the total sample were also seen in different subpopulations, and there were no major subgroups for which this positive effect would not be expected. Second, the consistency of the effects observed with respect to pulse, transmural infarction, age and infarct site are in contrast to some previous studies with practolol, propranolol, and alprenolol. Thus, beta blockers may not be identical with respect to reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "26": "Six cardiac transplant recipients underwent maximal exercise testing before and after the administration of intravenous propranolol to assess the effect of beta blockade on their exercise heart rate response and exercise capacity. Before propranolol the patients were capable of a mean of 6.8 minutes of exercise and heart rate increased from a resting value of 102 +/- 25 a minute to 138 +/- 34 at peak exercise--a mean increase of 35%. All tests were terminated because of tiredness or muscle weakness. After one hour's rest, intravenous propranolol (0.2 mg/kg over 10 minutes) was administered with a reduction in resting heart rate from 109 +/- 28 a minute to 83 +/- 16. During the repeat exercise test the patients were capable of a mean of 4.5 minutes of exercise and all tests were terminated by extreme exhaustion and/or unsteadiness requiring immediate cessation of the treadmill. Heart rate increased from a resting value of 83 +/- 16 a minute to 96 +/- 18 at peak exercise. The exercise capability of the denervated heart is conspicuously reduced by beta blockade, presumably because of its reliance on circulating catecholamines.", 
    "27": "beta-Adrenoceptors of pig coronary arteries were investigated by the use of a new ligand, 125iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) in binding studies. Inhibition of ICYP binding by betaxolol (a selective beta 1-antagonist), zinterol (a selective beta 2-agonist) and ICI 118551 (a selective beta 2-blocking drug) resulted in non-linear Scatchard plots, suggesting that both beta-adrenoceptor subtypes are present in pig coronary arteries. Computer analysis of the data gave a beta 1:beta 2-adrenoceptor ratio of approximately 65:35.", 
    "28": "The presence of adrenergic regulation of estradiol uptake in rat uterus was studied by using alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers in normal or Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution at 30 degrees C in vitro. Cyclic GMP content was also investigated under these conditions. By the stimulation with noradrenaline (4 X 10(-7) M), Ca2+-dependent 3H-estradiol uptake was increased in both cytosol and nuclear fractions. These increases were blocked in the presence of phentolamine (4 X 10(-7) M) but not by propranolol (4 X 10(-7) M). Increase in uterine cyclic GMP contents were shown under the condition in which 3H-estradiol uptake was stimulated. These results suggest that adrenergic alpha-stimulation increased uterine estradiol uptake and that consequently, increased estradiol-receptor complexes elevated uterine cyclic GMP levels. The changes in uterine cyclic GMP may serve as an index of estrogen action.", 
    "29": "Beta-adrenergic receptors were studied in membranes prepared from isolated fat cells obtained from both control and cold-acclimated rats. Beta-adrenergic receptors were identified using beta-adrenergic antagonist, (-) - [3H] dihydroalprenolol. Scatchard plots of specific binding suggest the existence of two binding sites for (-) - [3H] dihydroalprenolol with different affinities. Beta-adrenergic agonists competed for specific binding sites with typical beta 1-adrenergic specificity. There appears to be approximately 5,000 sites of high affinity per fat cell. Cold-acclimation (4 weeks at 4 degrees C) reduced adipocyte size; it did not appear to alter either the maximal number of binding sites of high and low affinity, or their affinity for beta-antagonists or agonists; however the density of binding sites in the fat cell was increased in cold-acclimated rats. It is concluded that the cold-adaptative process which induces in vivo the enhancement of calorigenic effect of norepinephrine is not found at the level of beta-receptors in white fat cells. The increased lipolytic response to norepinephrine observed in vitro in epididymal fat may be explained by cold-induced modifications in cell size and number.", 
    "30": "The effect of non-selective beta-blocker propranolol on the changes of plasma GH, prolactin and cortisol level during physical exercise in healthy untrained men has been evaluated. Acute i.v. pretreatment with propranolol resulted in an increased response of plasma GH level to the exercise on a bicycle ergometer. Propranolol significantly potentiated also the response of plasma cortisol level to submaximal exercise. No changes in urinary excretion of free cortisol and 17-OHCS during exercise combined with propranolol infusion as compared to that during exercise alone were observed. The increase of plasma prolactin level after exercise was not altered by propranolol administration. It is suggested that central beta-adrenoreceptors may play an inhibitory role in the control of GH and ACTH secretion during exercise. However, the interaction of propranolol with other central neurotransmitters as well as its peripheral effects, particularly the reduction in physical performance, must also be taken into consideration.", 
    "31": "It was shown experimentally on mice that prodigiozan did not increase the acute toxicity of prednisolone. It lowered the prednisolone-induced reduction of the period of hexenal sleep and preserved the capacity for increasing resistance to infection, when the adrenal cortex was blocked with metopiron. These findings together with the literature data were interpreted as arguments against the assumption that glucocorticoid mobilization was an important factor of the prodigiozan mode of action. Blocking of the beta-adrenoreceptors with obsidan increased the capacity of prodigiozan to activate the macrophage system and to raise the nonspecific resistance to infection, while blocking of the alpha-adrenoreceptors with phenolphthalein lowered this capacity. It was suggested that the macrophage activation was mediated by the alpha-adrenoreceptors and was due to a decrease in the cAMP/cGMP ratio.", 
    "32": "In order to examine more precisely the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in the process of differentiation we used the new radioligand iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP), which we found to be a very useful probe to identify beta receptors. Binding characteristics conformed to those expected for a physiologically relevant beta receptor. L6E9 cells grown in horse serum, which allows differentiation, exhibit increased beta receptor density in intact cells as a function of age. In contrast, cells grown in fetal calf serum, which does not allow differentiation, exhibit constant beta receptor density. In broken cells, however, both differentiating and non-differentiating cells show an increase in beta receptors. These results suggest that the process of differentiation is associated with an unmasking of beta receptors which are increasing but cryptic in undifferentiated cells.", 
    "33": "Isolated right and left guinea-pig atria, guinea-pig tracheae and rabbit aortic strips were used to define the sympathomimetic properties of N-isopropyloctopamine. This compound was a highly beta selective, direct-acting adrenergic agonist, approximately 200- and 440-fold less potent than isoproterenol in cardiac and smooth muscle, respectively. It was nearly a full agonist in both cardiac and smooth muscle without appreciable selectivity for either beta-1 or beta-2 receptors and had no demonstrable beta blocking activity. No alpha adrenergic activity was detectable within the concentration range tested. The chronotropic effect of N-isopropyloctopamine was very persistent and resistant to repeated washing of the tissues, which may reflect unusually firm binding to beta receptors.", 
    "34": "Intact lymphocytes from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) produce significantly (P less than 0.001) less adenosine 3':5' cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) than normal lymphocytes in response to isoproterenol (10(-8)-10(-4) M), although the basal cAMP content and the response to prostaglandin E1 are normal. Obligate heterozygotes for CF have significantly (P less than 0.005) reduced cAMP response to isoproterenol as well, suggesting a genetic component in the beta adrenergic deficiency in CF. The number of beta adrenergic receptors, as determined by equilibrium binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to lymphocyte particulates, is the same in normal lymphocytes (969 +/- 165 receptors/cell) and lymphocytes from patients with CF (1,333 +/- 263 receptors/cell). Binding properties of the receptor for both antagonist and agonist, as assessed by KD for dihydroalprenolol and Ki for (-)-isoproterenol, are also normal in the CF lymphocytes. Similarly, in granulocytes from patients with CF, the cAMP response to isoproterenol (10(-8)-10(-4) M) is significantly reduced compared with healthy controls (P less than 0.03), as is the response of granulocytes from obligate heterozygotes (P less than 0.05). Again, the basal cAMP levels and the response to prostaglandin E1 are normal. The number of beta adrenergic receptors, as determined by equilibrium binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to granulocyte particulates, was the same in normal (1,462 +/- 249 receptors/cell) and CF (1,621 +/- 221 receptors/cell) preparations. Binding properties of the receptor for both agonist and antagonist, as assessed by KD for dihydroalprenolol and Ki for isoproterenol, are normal in CF granulocyte particulates. The lymphocyte and granulocyte beta adrenergic defect in CF cannot be explained by abnormalities of the beta adrenergic receptor or of adenylate cyclase itself. Receptor-cyclase coupling is the most likely site of the heritable beta adrenergic defect in CF.", 
    "35": "As is illustrated in the case report presented here, disorders other than malignant hyperthermia can lead to fever and tachydysrhythmias. Should such symptoms develop in a patient with a previous history of thyrotoxicosis, the possibility of thyroid storm should be considered. Careful monitoring must not cease with the termination of the operation, because this complication usually develops after surgery. Should the complication occur, a successful outcome is dependent upon an understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease process, aggressive monitoring, and appropriate pharmacological management.", 
    "36": "Effects of S-596 on dog coronary arteries were investigated in vitro. S-596 produced concentration-dependent relaxations of coronary arterial strips under potassium-, prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha- or PGE2-contracture. S-596-induced relaxations of the strips were not influenced by tetraethylammonium or tranylcypromine, but restored by additional Ca++ or prevented by prior administration of Ca++. In distal portions of coronary arteries, S-596 significantly inhibited concentration-dependent relaxations of the strips induced by norepinephrine and reversed to weak contractions. In proximal portions, S-596 significantly inhibited concentration-dependent contractions induced by norepinephrine. Results indicate that S-596 has a nonspecific relaxant effect on isolated dog coronary arteries maybe through impairment of Ca++ availability and simultaneously has an alpha-adrenoceptor blocking effect, particularly on large coronary arteries.", 
    "37": "The positive inotropic responses of guinea-pig left atria and papillary muscles and positive chronotropic responses of right atria to sympathomimetic amines were examined at 38 degrees and 30 degrees C. At the lower temperature, supersensitivity to orciprenaline and isoprenaline was exhibited as shifts of the dose-response curves to the left and significant reductions in EC50 values. This supersensitivity could not be attributed to reduced metabolism since the experiments were performed in the presence of metanephrine (10(-5)M) and U-0521 (3',4'-dihydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone) (10(-4)M) as inhibitors of extraneuronal uptake and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) respectively, and the agonists are not susceptible to neuronal uptake. After incubation of the tissues with Ro 03-7894 (1-(5-chloracetylaminobenzfuran-2-yl)-2-isopropylaminoethanol), followed by its prolonged washout (greater than 2h), the maximum responses to isoprenaline and orciprenaline were depressed, confirming the apparently irreversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonism. Dissociation constants (KA) for isoprenaline and orciprenaline were determined from the equiactive concentrations obtained before (A) and after (A') incubation with Ro 03-7894, plotted as 1/A against 1/A' (KA = (slope-1)/intercept). KA values were the same for orciprenaline in the three cardiac preparations and for isoprenaline in the atria. This applied at 38 degrees and 30 degrees C and indicates that the beta-adrenoceptors mediating the inotropic and chronotropic responses of the guinea-pig heart do not differ. The KA values of both agonists were, however, consistently and significantly lower at 30 degrees than at 38 degrees C, indicating an increase in affinity. 8 It is concluded that hypothermia-induced supersensitivity of cardiac tissue to sympathomimetic amines is associated with an increase in their affinity for the B-adrenoceptors.", 
    "38": "Depolarizations of freshly-dissected isolated superior cervical ganglia of the rat were recorded extracellularly. The following sympathomimetic amines (in order of decreasing potency) produced depolarizations of up to 0.4 mV: isoprenaline, salbutamol, adrenaline, noradrenaline. Depolarizations were lost after overnight storage, leaving only hyperpolarizing responses. Depolarizations by isoprenaline were antagonized by (-)-propranolol (pA2 8.94 +/- 0.15), (+/-)-butoxamine (pA2 7.36 +/- 0.12) and (+/-)-practolol (pA2 5.14 +/- 0.13). They were not blocked by phentolamine (1 microM) or phenoxybenzamine (1 microM). Isoprenaline and salbutamol were antagonized with equal facility by practolol or butoxamine. In concentrations producing ganglionic depolarization, these compounds also produced a smaller depolarization of presynaptic elements in the ganglion, but not preganglionic trunk fibres. Presynaptic depolarization was blocked by 100 nM propranolol but not by 1 microM phentolamine. Isoprenaline and salbutamol increased the amplitude of the compound ganglionic action potential recorded following single preganglionic nerve stimuli when transmission had been rendered submaximal by adjusting the Ca/Mg ratio, but not in normal solution. Isoprenaline (0.1 microM) also increased the amount of [3H]-acetylcholine released by preganglionic stimulation in low Ca/high Mg solution. It is concluded that facilitatory adrenoceptors are present on pre- and postsynaptic elements in rat superior cervical ganglia, which resembles the 'beta 2' subclass of beta-receptors.", 
    "39": "Marihuana extract (ME) is known to influence smooth muscle activity. This study was designed to investigate the effect of crude ME on rat uterine muscle and to explain the mechanism of action using antagonists such as atropine, ergometrine and propranolol. The contractions and the electrical activity were recorded on isolated superfused rat uteri. It is speculated that ME by its uterine stimulatory action compromise uterine blood and may affect oxygen/nutrient transfer. The implication of this to the fetus is discussed.", 
    "40": "Epinephrine, norepinephrine or the more selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, inhibited insulin release from isolated pancreatic islets of lean mice or obese mice homozygous for the gene ob. Clonidine was highly effective at 0.1 mumol/l. In contrast, the preferential alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, had no or only a modest effect at 10 mumol/l. The effects of norepinephrine or clonidine were counteracted by yohimbine, a preferential blocker of alpha-2 receptors, but not by prazosine, an alpha-1 receptor blocker. The glucose-stimulated uptake of 45Ca2+ in the islets was only consistently inhibited by epinephrine. This effect was counteracted by yohimbine. Clonidine had no effect on the release of 86Rb+ from preloaded islets. It is concluded that insulin secretion is suppressed by alpha-2 receptor agonism in the pancreatic beta-cells and that this effect is mediated by mechanisms other than the transmembrane fluxes of calcium or potassium ions.", 
    "41": "Effects of befunolol and other beta-blocking agents on the phagocytosis of cultured retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE cells) from the chick embryo were investigated. Toxicity was evaluated as an ability of RPE cell phagocytosis of polystylene latex spheres (PS). After an incubation with beta-blockers, PS was added to the medium. The phagocytic reaction was terminated, and particle numbers in RPE cells were counted under an oil immersion microscope. Incubation with befunolol in a range of concentration of 10(-9)-10(-3) M resulted in a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of phagocytosis. Incubation with 10(-6) M befunolol inhibited phagocytic activity down to 60% of control. The same mode of action was observed in other beta-blockers. The inhibitory effect of befunolol at 10(-4) M or lower concentrations was reversible, while incubation with 10(-3) M for 24 h was irreversible.", 
    "42": "Although rare, acute poisoning with beta-blockers can be serious. Including the four personal cases of the authors, 40 cases of propranolol overdose have been published, with 8 deaths. Hypoglycaemia was not reported, but the association with alcohol can be very serious. One case of bronchospasm and one case of acute pulmonary oedema have been reported. Bradycardia is not the rule and widening of the QRS complex was reported in 4 cases. The other cases published are: 1) 10 cases with oxprenolol (including 5 cases of coma and 4 deaths), 2) 9 cases with acebutolol (2 deaths) including 5 with studies of the kinetics of the product (1 personal case), 3) 7 cases with pindolol (no bradycardia, good prognosis), 4) 6 cases (1 personal) with metoprolol (4 cases of massive ingestion with 1 death), 5) 3 cases with alprenolol (1 death), 6) 4 cases with sotalol (2 cases of turned apex, 1 death), 7) 1 case with atenolol. The authors discuss the practical management. They stress that glucagon is a much better form of treatment in severe cases than isopropylnoradrenaline, and that the crucial period is in the first few hours after the ingestion of the beta-blockers, i.e. usually before the patient's arrival at the hospital. The effectiveness of endocavity stimulation has not been demonstrated.", 
    "43": "In the framework of a screening test of new phenoxyalkanolamines the authors tested derivatives with the basic structure Ph1--NHCH2CH2NHCH2CH(OH)CH2--OPh2 for beta-adrenergic blocking activity and sympathicomimetic action on the spontaneously beating atrial preparation from the guinea-pig and on the circulation of the cat. Derivatives with the substituents 2,5-dimethyl, 2-nitro, 3-nitro, 2,6-dimethyl and 2-chloro at Ph1 produced in the atrial preparation a some 3- to 10fold stronger beta 1-adrenergic blockade than propranolol. In in vivo experiments on the cat, all of these compounds had a potent sympathicomimetic effect on the heart, so that they may be classified as specific beta-adrenergic antagonists. The addition of 4-nitro, 3-methyl and 4-ureido at Ph2 reduces the beta-adrenergic blockade and suppresses the sympathicomimetic action. 1-(3',4'-Dimethoxyphenylethylamino)-2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropane and its derivates showed a similar behaviour as described by Hoefle [8]. 1-[beta-(3-Nitrophenylamino)ethylamino]-2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropane hydrochloride exhibited a particularly strong and long-lasting sympathicomimetic effect. Studies on the dog revealed a specific beta 1-mimetic action; in the effective dose range of 10-30 micrograms/kg i.v., a positive inotropic effect prevailed, and the effect on heart rate was but small. No beta-adrenergic blockade or mimetic action on the peripheral vascular system was observed.", 
    "44": "The general consensus of opinion in psychopharmacology is that the basic lesion in schizophrenia is a defect of the dopaminergic mechanism in some part or parts of the brain. In this article I wish to show that there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the central lesion involves the polyamines rather than dopamine.", 
    "45": "Acetylcholine produced contraction, relaxation or a biphasic effect on corpus cavernosum muscle strips of human penis. These effects were antagonized by atropine but were modified by hexamethonium or tetrodotoxin suggesting the presence of excitatory and inhibitory muscarinic receptors in the human penis. Nicotine and DMPP also produced contraction or relaxation of the corpus cavernosum muscle strips. These effects were presumably indirect as they were abolished by hexamethonium and tetrodotoxin. Contractions produced by nicotine or DMPP were abolished by atropine whereas the relaxations produced by these agents were only partially blocked by atropine. Hence, the receptors mediating these relaxations are unlikely to be entirely muscarinic.", 
    "46": "The beta-blocker Metipranolol is discussed with reference to a pilot study and a double-blind study. It was found to be remarkably effective in lowering intraocular pressure. No statistically significant difference was found between Metipranolol and Timolol with regard to their effect on intraocular pressure and blood circulation. Nor were any significant side effects observed.", 
    "47": "beta-Adrenergic blocking agents--esmolol hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic profile, metabolism. Pharmacokinetic profile--cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, methyl 3-[4-(2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino)propoxy]phenylpropionate hydrochloride. Esmolol--cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, pharmacokinetic profile.", 
    "48": "Twenty-eight patients with intermittent claudication were studied before and one month after withdrawal of treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking drugs for hypertension, coronary heart disease or both. Heart rate, blood pressure, ankle/arm systolic blood pressure ratio and ankle pulse volume recording (PVR) at rest and after treadmill exercise were recorded, as well as walking distance, time of recovery from subjective symptoms, restitution time of pressure ratio and PVR. A control group of 14 patients, whose beta-adrenergic blocking drugs were not withdrawn, was also included. The result can be summarized as showing that withdrawal of beta-blockade was not demonstrably advantageous in patients with intermittent claudication. Significant improvement was observed only during the first month of the trial, a change which was independent of withdrawal of beta-blockade. The relief of subjective symptoms after exercise occurred significantly faster after withdrawal of nonselective beta-blockade. Otherwise, there was no difference between nonselective and cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.", 
    "49": "We have previously demonstrated that the rat submandibular gland releases immunoreactive kallikrein into the circulation. To study the role of the autonomic nervous system in this release, submandibular gland blood flow and kallikrein concentration in peripheral arterial and venous blood from the gland were measured and secretion rates calculated before and after parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve stimulation (8V, 2 msec, 10 Hz) for 1 minute. Immunoreactive kallikrein in plasma was measured by radioimmunoassay, and timed collections of venous outflow were used to measure blood flow. During basal conditions, the unstimulated submandibular gland of the rat released immunoreactive kallikrein into blood at the rate of 0.92 +/- 0.07 ng/min. Parasympathetic stimulation increased blood flow 4-fold (before, 68.5 +/- 8.3 microliters/min; after, 253.5 +/- 76.2; P less than 0.05) without significantly changing immunoreactive kallikrein secretion rate. Sympathetic stimulation produced an 11-fold increase in blood flow (before, 64.9 +/- 9.3 microliters/min; after, 709.6 +/- 97.5; P less than 0.05) and a 57-fold increase in immunoreactive kallikrein secretion rate from the gland (before, 1.05 +/- 0.25 ng/min; after, 59.8 +/- 18.6; P less than 0.05). Sympathetic stimulation also produced a 4-fold increase in the concentration of immunoreactive glandular kallikrein in arterial plasma (before, 15.2 +/- 1.1 ng/ml; after, 56.2 +/- 12.9; P less than 0.05). Pretreatment with phentolamine (1 mg/kg) or prazosin (0.2 mg/kg) blocked the increase in kallikrein secretion rate produced by sympathetic stimulation. These results indicate that the sympathetic nervous system, through activation of alpha 1-adrenoreceptors, controls kallikrein secretion from the submandibular gland into the circulation. Released kallikrein may be responsible for the reactive vasodilation observed in the rat submandibular gland after sympathetic stimulation.", 
    "50": "As beta-adrenergic blockers grow increasingly popular for the therapy of a wide variety of disorders, it becomes increasingly important to appreciate the spectrum of physiologic effects on the gastrointestinal system and the potential hazards associated with use of these agents. This review details the effects of the beta-adrenergic blocking agents on the gastrointestinal tract.", 
    "51": "Elevated total peripheral resistance and normal cardiac output are the hemodynamic characteristics of chronic essential hypertension. One approach to treating hypertension matches the individual pathophysiology with the hemodynamic effects of antihypertensive drugs. Antiadrenergic drugs are appropriate second-step therapy in many cases of established hypertension; by reducing total peripheral resistance, these agents can reduce blood pressure while sparing cardiac output and renal blood flow. The physician should treat elderly hypertensive patients cautiously and consider using drug with a favorable hemodynamic profile.", 
    "52": "The interactions of agonists and antagonists with beta-adrenergic receptors on intact 1321N1 human astrocytoma and C62B rat glioma cells were studied by using the radioligand (-)-[125I]iodopindolol. Competition binding assays were performed at 37 degrees C under equilibrium conditions and in short-time nonequilibrium assays that approximated initial velocity conditions for binding of the radioligand. The theoretical basis and experimental validation of the initial velocity approach for determining binding affinities of rapidly equilibrating ligands are presented. For the agonists isoproterenol and epinephrine, high binding affinities that approximated their apparent affinities for binding in membranes and for increase of cyclic AMP concentrations in intact cells could be demonstrated only in short-time assays; in contrast, much lower affinities were observed with equilibrium (60-min) assays as reported previously for various cell lines. High-affinity binding of isoproterenol to 1321N1 cells also was observed in equilibrium (6-hr) binding assays carried out on ice. These results indicate that in the native state the intact cell beta-adrenergic receptor has a high binding affinity for agonists and suggest that incubation at 37 degrees C in the presence of an agonist converts the receptors to a form with low affinity for agonists.", 
    "53": "Management of the postinfarction patient should be directed toward identifying and treating individuals at risk of future coronary morbidity or mortality. The history, physical examination, resting ECG, and chest film, supplemented with ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, noninvasive assessment of left ventricular function, graded exercise testing, and sometimes angiography allow stratification of patients into high- and low-risk subgroups. A program of exercise training, risk factor modification, and prophylactic therapy with beta blockers would be warranted in most patients. Use of antiarrhythmic agents may alter prognosis in certain subgroups. Evidence is currently insufficient to warrant routine use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents in the postinfarction patient.", 
    "54": "Cimetidine is a widely used antiulcer medication that is also a potent inhibitor of the mixed-function oxidase enzymes in the liver. This effect results in a number of clinically important interactions with other drugs, which are now being appreciated. Other effects of cimetidine, such as raising of gastric pH, alteration of liver blood flow, or alterations in renal secretory mechanisms, may also contribute to or result in clinically significant interactions. Current data document appreciable alterations in the metabolism or excretion of warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, lidocaine, certain beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, certain benzodiazepines, and probably narcotic analgesics and procainamide. Thus, effects of these drugs and serum levels, where available, should be more closely followed when used in combination with cimetidine. Cimetidine appears to exacerbate the myelosuppressive effects of the nitrosoureas, and may also significantly alter the absorption of ketoconazole. Though other drugs may affect the absorption or elimination of cimetidine, the clinical implication of these effects is uncertain.", 
    "55": "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents differ considerably in their effects on myocardial excitable properties. The possibility that intrinsic sympathomimetic activity might contribute to such differences has not been adequately explored. This study examined the influence of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity on the electrophysiologic effects of three agents with varying degrees of such activity. Intravenous propranolol (0.5 mg/kg), oxprenolol (0.5 mg/kg) and pindolol (0.05 mg/kg) were administered in 16 anesthetized dogs. The effects of the drugs on ventricular vulnerability were studied over a 2 hour period. Propranolol and oxprenolol raised the ventricular fibrillation threshold by 42 and 56%, respectively. In contrast, pindolol resulted in an elevation of only 25%. After depletion of endogenous norepinephrine stores using reserpine, pindolol led to a decrease of the ventricular fibrillation threshold, which was reversed by propranolol. These data indicate that intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of beta-adrenergic blocking agents substantially alters their ultimate effect on myocardial excitable properties.", 
    "56": "Negative T waves in the ECG during an acute infection may be due purely to functional variations, making the diagnosis of acute myocarditis difficult. The effects of orthostasis, beta-blockade, and intravenous epinephrine infusion (0.07-0.21 micrograms/kg/min) on T waves and the Q-T interval was studied in 28 young men with acute myocarditis, in 29 persons with functional T-wave abnormalities, and in 30 healthy subjects. Myocarditis-induced negative T waves were never normalized by beta-blockade. Functional T-wave inversions were normalized by beta-blockade in 22 subjects (76 percent). Orthostasis always augmented the T-wave abnormalities that were normalized by beta-blockade. Functional T-wave abnormalities responding to beta-blockade were augmented by epinephrine in 17 subjects (77 percent); but those unresponsive to beta-blockade were normalized in six of seven subjects. The Q-Tc interval was significantly (p less than 0.01) lengthened in subjects with myocarditis (410 +/- 36 ms) compared with controls (384 +/- 27 ms). The beta-blockade test is useful in differentiating between functional T-wave inversions and acute myocarditis. However, functional T-wave abnormalities are not constantly abolished by beta-blockade but may then be normalized by epinephrine. A clearly prolonged Q-Tc interval speaks for a diagnosis of myocarditis.", 
    "57": "Results based on small subgroups are prone to much random variation and firm conclusions based on subgroup analyses should be avoided. Caution is advisable, especially with regard to post hoc and multiple analyses. Subgroup findings for which a reasonable biologic explanation can be given and those supported by independent results from other subgroups within the trial are more likely to be real. The strongest support for a subgroup finding in one trial is a replication from another trial. Post hoc analyses from the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial suggest, and are supported by the Norwegian Timolol Study, that myocardial infarction patients older than age 60 years and those with arrhythmic and other complications not severe enough to preclude treatment benefit the most in absolute terms from beta blockers.", 
    "58": "The indications for, and the contraindications to, therapy with beta-adrenoceptor drugs in acute myocardial infarction are still unclear. Earlier fears have been largely dispelled and these agents can probably be prescribed with comparative safety in affected patients without hypotension or evidence of cardiac failure. If, however, there is reason to suspect a raised end-diastolic pressure or a low cardiac output, they should only be used if the indications are strong and if careful hemodynamic monitoring is observed.", 
    "59": "Comparing the effects of long-term beta-blocker trials on nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) is difficult because of differences in diagnostic criteria and in methods of reporting and classifying events. Analysis of available data indicates that the relative effect of beta blockers on the incidence of nonfatal MI is not different among the reviewed long-term trials. Pooling of trial results indicates that beta-blocker therapy has a beneficial effect on nonfatal MI incidence that is of the same magnitude (25%) as that for all-cause mortality.", 
    "60": "Beta-adrenergic blockers have several physiologic and pharmacologic actions that are due to a class action resulting from competitive blockade of cellular receptors. However, they have other actions that are due to an individual spectrum of pharmacologic activity. These may be due to pharmacologic differences, such as cardioselectivity, membrane-stabilizing activity, and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, or to disease-specific responses of patients.", 
    "61": "Treatment with oral beta 1 blockade started after recovery from acute myocardial infarction and continued for approximately 2 years reduces total mortality by about 25%. It is unclear how long oral treatment should be maintained, nor is it known if stopping beta blockade increases the risk of sudden death or reinfarction. Acute i.v. administration of beta blockers has been shown to reduce indexes of infarct size. The effect of this reduction on short- and long-term survival is promising, but not conclusive.", 
    "62": "It seems clear that beta blockers can limit infarct size in man and reduce mortality after a myocardial infarction. Early mortality also seems to be reduced by beta blockade in patients in whom infarct size was not limited. Thus, infarct size limitation is not the only mechanism for an effect of beta blockade on early infarction mortality. The favorable effect of early initiation of beta blockade on long-term survival might, however, suggest an importance of infarct size limitation for prognosis. More studies are needed to evaluate the role of infarct size limitation for long-term prognosis.", 
    "63": "Ten randomized clinical trials of beta-blocking drugs in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease are reviewed. The six trials of long-term treatment involving three drugs have completed recruitment; the results should be reported during the next few years. In addition to the possibility of confirming the positive results from other trials, the findings may provide further information on the timing of treatment initiation and the mechanism of benefit. Three of the four trials concerned with the efficacy of beta blockers in the early acute phase of myocardial infarction are still recruiting. Two of these (the Prehospital Myocardial Infarction Study and the International Study of Infarct Survival) are large trials aiming to determine the effect on mortality from all causes. The third (Multicenter Investigation of the Limitation of Infarct Size) has infarct size as the primary end point, as does the one trial with completed follow-up (Belfast), whose preliminary findings indicate no effect on threatened infarction.", 
    "64": "All available beta-adrenergic blocking agents share the property of blocking beta 1 adrenoceptors, including those in the heart. They differ, however, in their ability to block beta 2 receptors (cardioselectivity), their membrane stabilizing action, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and their pharmacokinetic properties. The strongest evidence for efficacy in secondary prevention has been obtained with timolol, metoprolol and propranolol. Timolol and propranolol block all beta-receptor-mediated responses and are therefore nonselective, whereas metoprolol is relatively cardioselective. Propranolol and metoprolol have membrane stabilizing action, but timolol does not; none of these agents show intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Thus, no ancillary property is a requirement for efficacy. All of these agents may precipitate heart failure, but this problem has been exaggerated, and transient failure during the early course of myocardial infarction is no longer a contraindication to therapy. Cardioselective agents cause less bronchospasm, but this can still occur, especially with higher dosages. In addition, these agents probably cause somewhat less fatigue and result in less hypertension during hypoglycemia than nonselective agents. The availability of at least three effective agents allows for a choice of therapy to offer individual patients.", 
    "65": "It is generally agreed that the conditions leading to myocardial ischemia occur when the oxygen demands of the myocardium exceed the oxygen supply. The major limitations of oxygen supply to the myocardium are atherogenic disease and vasospasm of the coronary arteries. The major hemodynamic determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption are systemic wall tension, heart rate and the inotropic state of the myocardium. Stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart by endogenous catecholamines increases myocardial oxygen consumption, which can aggravate the ischemic process. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs decrease myocardial oxygen requirements by reducing systemic arterial pressure, heart rate and myocardial contractility at rest and during exercise, making them useful for treating ischemia. The effects of these drugs on coronary blood flow are less well defined. Beta blockers may decrease coronary blood flow by allowing the unopposed influence of coronary vasoconstrictor impulses to prevail. However, the drugs may also augment overall coronary blood flow by slowing the heart rate and increasing diastolic perfusion time. Controversial studies have shown favorable effects of beta blockers on myocardial metabolism and energetics, the coronary microvasculature, collateral blood flow, the distribution of myocardial blood flow, oxygen-hemoglobin affinity and platelet function. Although their exact antiischemic mechanisms are not known, beta blockers have an overall pharmacologic profile that favors their use in the prevention and treatment of myocardial ischemia.", 
    "66": "Beta-blocker therapy apparently is important in the short- and long-term care of patients with myocardial infarction (MI). In the former, administration may reduce MI size, and in the latter, it promotes a statistically significant reduction in mortality. Since beta blockers exert a number of effects, it is still not known how the specific beneficial effects are mediated. Nevertheless, there is still a need to examine the effects of beta blockers, either singly or combined with other medications, on patients recovering from acute MI and as a late intervention. Specific attention must be directed to the older patient, those with moderate myocardial dysfunction, and those with life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias. Each of these problems must be addressed by a well-designed, randomized clinical trial to ensure the best possible study design and the most accurate scientific outcome."
