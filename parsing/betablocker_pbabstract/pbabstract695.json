Intraperitoneal administration of Chou-Mou-li produced dose-dependent hypothermia in rats at both 8 and 22 degrees C Ta- At 8 degrees C Ta the hypothermia in response to Chou-Mou-Li was due to decreased metabolism, while at 22 degrees C Ta the hypothermia was due to both decreased metabolism and cutaneous vasodilatation. There was no change in respiratory evaporative heat loss. Furthermore, the hypothermia induced by Chou-Mou-Li was greatly antagonized by pretreatment of animals with p-chlorophenylalanine (a selective depletor of brain serotonin), but not by either atropine sulfate (a selective blocker of cholinergic receptors), regitine (a selective blocker of alpha-adrenergic receptors) or DL-propranolol (a selective blocker of beta-adrenergic receptors). However, at 30 degrees C Ta, systemic administration of Chou-Mou-Li produced no change in rectal temperature or other thermoregulatory responses. On the other hand, direct administration of serotonin into the lateral cerebral ventricle of conscious rats also produced dose-dependent hypothermia at 8 and 22 degrees C Ta. Again, the hypothermia in response to serotonin was due to decreased metabolism at 8 degrees C Ta and was due to both decreased metabolism and cutaneous vasodilatation at 22 degrees C Ta. At 30 degrees C Ta administration of serotonin also produced no change in thermoregulatory functions. The data indicate that Chou-Mou-Li produces hypothermia by increasing sensible heat loss and decreasing metabolic heat production, probably via the release of endogenous serotonin within brain.", 
    "1": "Under isometric conditions simultaneous recordings are made of the contractile activity of smooth-muscle strips isolated along the circular axis from the pyloric sphincter (PS) and at 1 cm proximally an distally from it -- from the antrum (A) and duodenum (D). The effect of transmural electrical stimulation is studied after the method of Burn and Rand (1960) (duration of the impulses 0.5 ms, frequency from 2 to 20 Hz and supramaximal current values for 20 s). The responses of the smooth-muscle strips isolated from A and D to transmural electrical stimulation are similar. Switching on of the stimulation causes contraction (on-response) throughout the entire stimulation period, while its switching off leads to additional last contraction (off-response). A dependence is observed between the amplitudes of the on- and off-responses and the frequency of the impulses, the maximum being reached in the high-frequency range (16-20 Hz). After Atropinum sulfuricum (5 x 10(-6)M) the on-response is considerably reached, no off-response being observed. In PS triggering of the stimulation results in inhibition of the phasic activity, accompanied by marked relaxation (on-response). The amplitude and the duration of the relaxation depend on the frequency of the impulses applied, the amplitude being maximal at 4-6 Hz, while its duration reaches the maximum between 16 and 18 Hz. Atropinum sulfuricum (5 x 10(-6)M) does not change essentially the amplitude of the relaxation. After Atropinum sulfuricum, Phentolamine and Propranolol (10(-5)M) the amplitude of the relaxation increases significantly in the low-frequency region (4-8 Hz), while its duration decreases considerably.", 
    "2": "To assess the duration of improved exercise tolerance by metoprolol given in a new sustained-release formulation, 40 in-patients affected by stable exercise-induced angina pectoris received single-blind placebo in day 1 and thereafter, in double-blind cross-over once daily administration, metoprolol RETARD 100 mg and 200 mg in days 3 and 5. Symptom-limited cycloergometric exercise tests were performed at 3 and 24 hours after placebo and after each of the two doses of metoprolol RETARD. Duration of exercise, maximal workload and total work performed did significantly increase at 3 and 24 hours after metoprolol RETARD 100 mg (P less than 0.01) and 200 mg (P less than 0.01), without any significant difference between the two doses. Peak systolic arterial pressure and heart rate were lowered by metoprolol RETARD 200 mg at 3 (P less than 0.01) and 24 (P less than 0.01) hours, whereas only the peak heart rate at 3 hours was lowered (P less than 0.05) by the 100 mg dose. It is concluded that in patients with stable exercise-induced angina pectoris, metoprolol RETARD 200 mg appears to be able to increase exercise tolerance and to reduce exercise-induced myocardial oxygen consumption throughout 24 hours period. This may justify a once daily dosing schedule of the 200 mg dose, aimed at improving patient compliance.", 
    "3": "Treatment of recurrent ventricular tachycardia (RVT) is still difficult, as far as choice of antiarrhythmic agents, dosage, associations and statement of their effectiveness are concerned; the Authors report their experience on twelve cases of RVT. The diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia was confirmed by esophageal electrograms in four cases and by intracardiac recordings in two cases. Patients were controlled by clinical observation, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring and several recordings. Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was carried out in ten patients. Two patients left the hospital spontaneously; therapy was found to be effective in the remainder. Four patients were treated with quinidine plus betablockers, for cases with quinidine plus amiodarone. The results of long-term follow-up suggest that combined pharmacological therapy with drugs of different classes may be successful in preventing recurrences of ventricular tachycardia. The Authors think that careful choices of adequate therapeutic programs and rigid criteria for the evaluation of results should be planned in apparent refractory RVT, before referring to invasive procedures.", 
    "4": "28 patients, aged 35-62 years, with uncomplicated hypertension, entered a double-blind, crossover study, in which the effects of single daily doses of sotalol and metoprolol were compared. Both drugs exerted a clinically useful anti-hypertensive effect as monotherapy, or in combination with a thiazide diuretic. No significant difference in hypotensive effects was noted between the two beta-blocking agents, when the dose was titrated to an optimal clinical effect. Treatment with sotalol and metoprolol was associated with a clinically insignificant increase in serum uric acid concentration. The side-effects observed were few, and in only two cases was therapy discontinued. We regard both sotalol and metoprolol as useful anti-hypertensive drugs.", 
    "5": "Mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and rectal temperature were measured from conscious, chair-restrained squirrel monkeys prepared with chronically indwelling arterial and venous catheters and temperature probes to determine the magnitude and duration of the effects of acute intravenous injections of propranolol, phentolamine and methyl atropine. The data indicate a predominant influence of the sympathetic nervous system in the regulation of cardiovascular activity resting squirrel monkeys.", 
    "6": "The actions and interactions between strophanthidin and norepinephrine on electrical and mechanical events were studied in cardiac canine Purkinje fibers perfused in vitro. The results obtained show that norepinephrine (but not strophanthidin) shifts phase 1 and the beginning of the plateau to a more positive potential, an effect reduced by beta-receptor blockade. Norepinephrine increases the contractile force to the maximal value sooner than strophanthidin. In low Ca solution, the inotropic action of strophanthidin far exceeds that of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine does not cause spontaneous discharge in the driven fibers, whereas strophanthidin eventually induces fast spontaneous rhythms. When norepinephrine is given in the presence of strophanthidin (or vice versa) spontaneous activity is induced which consists either of a slow rhythm (characterized by large action potentials) or of a fast rhythm (characterized by small action potentials). The latter is typically induced by strophanthidin alone but occurs sooner in the presence of both agents. Propranolol prevents the onset of the slow rhythm but not that of the fast rhythm. It is concluded that norepinephrine and strophanthidin increase force by different mechanisms and that the potentiation between these agents in causing spontaneous discharge may involve an enhancement of diastolic depolarization(slow rhythm) or of the oscillatory potential (fast rhythm).", 
    "7": "A sensitive method for monitoring serum or plasma labetalol (2-hydroxy-5-[1- hydroxy-2-(1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamino) ethyl] benzamide hydrochloride) is described. The method is designed to study single dose kinetics and assess predose labetalol levels during chronic treatment. The applicable range of the assay is 10 to 400 ng/ml using 1 ml of plasma or serum. The method uses reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), a mobile phase of acetonitrile/pH 3.0 phosphate, and ultraviolet detection at 207 nm. The percentage recovery of labetalol and internal standard (propericiazine) (3-cyano-10-[3-4-hydroxypiperidino) propyl] phenothiazine from serum was 95.6% and 75.5%, respectively. Th precision of the method at labetalol serum concentrations of 400 and 50 ng/ml was indicated by a coefficient of variation of 4.3% and 6.9%, respectively. An approximate fourfold variation in plasma labetalol concentration, with plasma levels ranging from 20 to 93 ng/ml, was seen 10 to 11 hours after a dose in a group of patients taking 200 mg twice daily.", 
    "8": "The effect of propranolol on colonic motility was studied in 10 patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Colonic motility was recorded by pressure measurement 15-18 cm from the anus, and total contractile activity (kPa x min) simultaneously integrated. After rest, motility was recorded for 30 min after injection of saline (control period) and after injection of 5 mg propranolol intravenously. Administration of propranolol was followed by an increase in colonic motility in 9 out of the 10 patients. In one patient no change was observed. During the control period, total contractile activity was 7.7 +/- 18 (S.E.M.) kPa x min (58 +/- 14 mmHg x min), increasing after propranolol to 14.2 +/- 2.3 kPa x min (107 +/- 17 mmHg x min). The difference was significant (p less than 0.01). After propranolol, the colonic pressure waves regularly appeared for longer periods of time and had higher amplitudes than during control activity. Prolonged elevation of basal pressure with superimposed pressure waves was observed in two patients. This study shows that adrenergic beta-blocking agents enhance colonic motility in man. The results may explain abdominal symptoms such as pain and change in bowel habits appearing in patients treated with beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "9": "Clonidine administered to mice induced hypothermia and this effect was antagonized by a single dose of the following beta-agonists: salbutamol, isoprenaline and terbutaline. The effect of these beta-agonists was completely antagonized by propranolol. The effect of terbutaline on reserpine-and apomorphine-induced hypothermia was also studied; it causing a slight but significant reversal of hypothermia. This effect was also blocked by propranolol. The results obtained here showed these beta-agonists behave in a manner similar to other antidepressant drugs. The data reinforces the view that beta-stimulation is of great importance in antidepressant action.", 
    "10": "The plasma concentrations of pindolol have been examined following the administration of single doses of 15 mg tablets to eight healthy male subjects. The apparent half-life of elimination in plasma (t1/2 = 4.05 h) and in urine (t1/2 = 3.21 h) was calculated using conventional pharmacokinetic methods. The renal clearance was estimated by plotting urinary excretion rates versus plasma concentrations; for all subjects these plots were curved. In addition to these graphical estimations, the plasma concentrations of pindolol and the urinary excretion data for each volunteer were simultaneously fitted using a one or two-compartment open body model; a computer program using non-linear regression algorithms was used. This procedure did not give an adequate fit to the data. Another type of data analysis, using a population - based model, permitted us to show that the renal elimination of pindolol in man comprises of two separate processes - tubular secretion and reabsorption, which was partially saturable under the experimental conditions. The theoretical relevance and clinical significance of these findings are discussed.", 
    "11": "The suppressive effect on PTH secretion of propranolol, a beta 1 and beta 2 blocker, and that of atenolol a specific beta 1 betablocker was compared in 24 uraemic patients not yet on dialysis in a cross over study. Although plasma PTH concentrations were comparable, plasma bicarbonate was higher with propranolol suggesting that the initial suppression of PTH secretion by propranolol was greater as a higher bicarbonate should lead to lower ionised calcium. The suppressive effect of cimetidine on PTH secretion was assessed in 12 patients on chronic haemodialysis. In the seven compliant patients there was no change in N and C terminal plasma PTH values but plasma calcitonin concentrations significantly decreased with cimetidine and returned to initial values after cimetidine was discontinued.", 
    "12": "The action of beta-adrenoceptor antagonist penbutolol on the current underlying pacemaker activity in cardiac Purkinje fibres was analysed using the voltage clamp technique described by DECK et al. (1964). After the application of adrenalin, beta-blockers are able to counteract the well known shift of the s-kinetics of the pacemaker current. However, without any prior application of adrenalin the beta-blocker Penbutolol has no effect on these kinetics except for a small depression of the amplitude of the pacemaker current tails. The rectifier properties of the pacemaker current and the negative slope of the fully activated current voltage relationship of iK2 are unchanged. Penbutolol is able--even after a longer period of washout (about 60-90 min was necessary)--to protect the beta-adrenoceptors from the action of adrenalin (HASHIMOTO et al., 1979). These findings suggest that beta-blockers are competitive inhibitors of beta-stimulators and further support the notion that the pacemaker current in cardiac Purkinje fibres is controlled by beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "13": "Thirty patients with chronic glaucoma or chronic ocular hypertension were administered Timolol drops for thirty-eight to forty-nine months. Twenty four eyes had their intra-ocular pressure controlled with Timolol alone, during this period, and eighteen eyes with additional treatment (cholinergic agents or sulfonamides). In two cases, temporary superficial punctate keratopathy developed.", 
    "14": "The presence of alpha- and beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in cerebral microvessels of the rat and pig was assessed by ligand binding techniques. The results demonstrate the presence of specific binding to alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic receptors but no appreciable specific binding to alpha 1-adrenergic or muscarinic cholinergic receptors. beta-Adrenergic receptors of pig cerebral microvessels are similar to those of the brain and other organs in their binding characteristics to the tritiated ligand and in their stereospecificity of binding to the biologically active isomers of beta-adrenergic agonists. Further evidence derived from the differential potency of binding displacement by the various beta-adrenergic agonists and selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic antagonists indicates that beta-adrenergic receptors of pig cerebral microvessels are mostly of the beta 2-subtype.", 
    "15": "We measured adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine beta-hydroxylase in arterial and in coronary sinus blood in 14 patients with coronary artery disease, at rest and under pacing-induced ischemia. Pacing increased the concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline in both arterial and coronary sinus blood. The origin of the adrenaline increase appears to be extramyocardial. The arteriovenous differences indicated that the heart extracts adrenaline and releases noradrenaline. These differences were not significantly changed by pacing, nor by the administration of propranolol. No marked changes in the concentrations of dopamine beta-hydroxylase were observed, except under pacing after propranolol, in which case a release from the heart occurred.", 
    "16": "Three cases of peritoneal fibrosis induced by the beta adrenoceptor blocking agent practolol are presented. Histological and scanning electron microscopical specimens showed a thick layer of loose connective tissue with collagen bundles and fibroblasts. No evidence of mesothelial cells with characteristic microvilli was found. The conclusion is drawn that the basic feature of practolol peritonitis is the destruction of the mesothelial membrane and a slowly progressive formation of loose connective tissue. The reason for the increased formation of connective tissue and the cause of the excessive activity of fibroblasts are discussed.", 
    "17": "An intravenous infusion of NaCl, NaCl + phentolamine (alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist), or NaCl + propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) was given in three series of experiments. After intraduodenal infusion of glucose (82 ml 1.51 M, pH 6.5) the GIP concentration in plasma increased from 42.3 (23.1-62.2) to 225 (107-460) pM during intravenous NaCl, from 35.6 (17.3-38.9) to 251 (127-387) pM during phentolamine, and from 32.5 (5.5-63.4) to 172 (103-405) pM during propranolol administration. The blood glucose response was not different in the three experiments. It is concluded that the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol inhibits the release of GIP after intraduodenal administration of glucose.", 
    "18": "A method to filter whole blood through 5-micron filters at a pressure of 20 cm column of water and the use of aging red cells as a reproducible procedure to generate rigidified cells is described. The system is sensitive enough to evaluate in pharmacologic screening possible influences of chemical agents on red cell deformability. Investigations with the methylxanthine derivates pentoxifylline and theophylline, the beta-blocker penbutolol and prednisolone, revealed that only the first compound has a dose-dependent effect on red deformability.", 
    "19": "The Fatty acid Incorporation into human Adipose Tissue (FIAT), the metabolic step after the hydrolysis of plasma triglyceride (TG)-bound fatty acids (FA) by lipoprotein lipase, was studied by an in-vitro technique to investigate its role and reactions to various substrates, drug and dietary treatments in hypertriglyceridaemia (HTG). We found that FIAT was reduced, P less than 0.001, in patients with HTG and a recent myocardial infarction compared to normotriglyceridaemic (NTG) patients. Patients with very high plasma TG levels had the lowest FIAT. There were highly significant positive correlations between FIAT in several subcutaneous regions and omental fat with highest activities in the omental fat. FIAT increased approximately linearly with increasing medium FA concentrations in both NTG and HTG patients. Low values were more common in HTG. In both groups, however, the rate of fatty acid mobilizing lipolysis was significantly decreased when FA increased. FA thus seems to have important effects on both FIAT and rate of lipolysis. FIAT was increased when rate of fatty acid mobilization was inhibited in vitro by the beta-blocker oxprenolol. FIAT decreased, P less than 0.05 and lipolysis increased, P less than 0.01 after one week of treatment with an adenosine derivate BM 11.189. Serum TG were not affected in that study but decreased, P less than 0.001, when HTG patients were treated by diet and clofibrate for two weeks presumably because this treatment increased FA-removal, ie FIAT. The results suggest that variations in the FIAT activity seems to play an important role in determining plasma TG levels.", 
    "20": "The present study was designed to assess the antiarrhythmic Prajmalium Bitartrate (PB) efficacy in the long term treatment of 22 patients with recent myocardial infarction and persistent, frequent, polimorphous, repetitive (two or more in a row) ventricular premature complexes (VPCs). VPCs were exposed by means of 24-hours ambulatory monitoring. The acute drug testing with a single dose of PB (30 mg) was followed by multiple maintenance therapy with a dose decreasing from 60 to 40 mg every day. Than, the long term antiarrhythmic action was evaluated by both monitoring and exercise stress testing (EST), symptom self-limited, in a 7 months and 28 days follow-up. A favorable therapeutic effect, with a reduction of VPCs frequency greater than 85% and the suppression of their greater Lown degrees, was obtained in 13 cases (59.2%) using PB alone and in 6 cases (27.2%) using PB associated with Amiodarone in 5 patients and with Metoprololo in one. No VPCs were present or they were less than 2 every 3 minutes during EST. Fourteen patients reported a recurrence of VPCs when the drug was stopped for 24-28 hours, after 3-5 months of the treatment. In 3 patients (13.6%) the PB was uneffective. In a case there was, during the acute drug testing, a paradox increasing of the arrhythmias, and in the other two an abnormal lengthening of QTc interval, while arrhythmia was unchanged. PB, alone or associated with other antiarrhythmic drugs, appears a well tolerated, handy and effective agent and it can be proposed as a drug of first choice for controlling VPCs.", 
    "21": "The result of an exercise ECG can be represented on an XY chart by four monovariate (normal) distributions: heart rate (divided by X axis); blood pressure (divided by Y axis); Working time deficit (-X axis); ST depression (-Y axis); and two bivariate (elliptic) distributions: double product (divided by X divided by Y quadrant); ST X time-deficit index (-X -Y quadrant). Charts for 100 normal men, 100 normal women, 100 coronary men, and 100 coronary women were first of all built up. Charts of 100 patients under propanolol, 33 under atenolol, 47 under nidefipine, 13 under verapamil, and 44 under isosorbide dinitrate were then compared with those from coronary men. Beta blockers produced a shift in all six parameters; nifedipine modified blood pressure, double product, ST and time deficit; verapamil only changed blood pressure and time deficit; isosorbide changed ST, time deficit and the ST X time-deficit index.", 
    "22": "The effects of smoking on the treatment of angina has been studied in 10 patients. Each patient underwent 4 randomized 1-week treatments consisting of on and off smoking, and on and off propranolol (360 mg/day). At the end of each treatment a maximal exercise test was performed using 16 praecordial leads. Smoking was associated with a significantly higher heart rate, blood pressure, area and severity of ST-segment depression. This was not abolished by propranolol. Thus, smoking aggravates the simple haemodynamic variables used to assess myocardial oxygen requirements and the electrocardiographic signs of ischaemia; this is true even after treatment with propranolol.", 
    "23": "Changes in the exercise ECG caused by five different drugs are presented. Analysis of these changes indicate that these are related to the hemodynamic effects of the drugs, rather than to reduction of myocardial ischemia. Calcium antagonists (Verapamil) as well as drugs which reduce heart rate (Alinidine, Propranolol) do not change the relation between ST depression and heart rate in a given patient. Drugs which lower ventricular volume (Molsidomine, Nitroglycerine) reduce the amount of ST depression at the same heart rate during exercise.", 
    "24": "Electrophysiological investigations were performed in 30 patients with symptomatic sinus node disease (SND) to assess the extent and distribution of associated functional disturbances in the conduction system. The tests were performed before and after inhibition of autonomous tone with propranolol, 0.1 mg/kg, and atropine, 0.02 mg/kg. Surface ECG had shown bundle branch blocks (BBB) in 5 patients and fascicular blocks in 2. AV block I had been recorded in 4 patients, while none had shown high-degree AV block. Malfunction was most often detected in the AV junction, 17 patients showing a prolonged conduction time or an abnormal effective AV node refractory period. Intraventricular conduction delay was present in 7 patients, with a prolonged HV interval in 3 and a complete permanent BBB in the others. Rate-dependent BBBs were demonstrated in a further 4 patients. Long cardiac arrests following interruption of atrial pacing, suggesting impaired automaticity also of subsidiary escape pacemakers, were seen in 11 patients. Only 6 patients, 20%, showed no signs of associated malfunction of the conduction system. Thus, detailed electrophysiological assessment demonstrated associated conduction abnormalities in the majority of these SND patients. The results agree with histopathological studies and show that sinus node malfunction is often the clinically apparent manifestation of a widespread degenerative process in the cardiac conduction system.", 
    "25": "In concentrations higher than 1 X 10(-3)M histamine relaxed guinea-pig tracheal strips previously contracted by lower histamine concentrations. The blocker of H1-histaminergic receptors diphenhydramine (1 X 10(-6)M and 1 X 10(-5)M) and the alpha-adrenoblocker phentolamine (1 X 10(-5)M) potentiated histamine-induced relaxation. The beta-blocker propranolol (1 X 10(-4)M) decreased the histamine relaxant effect. Oxprenolol (1 X 10(-4)M) that is a less potent blocker of the tracheal beta 2-adrenoreceptors and is a partial beta-agonist did not influence histamine-induced relaxation. It is suggested that high histamine concentrations relax the guinea-pig tracheal strips by activating the H2-receptors and by depleting catecholamines in the smooth muscle.", 
    "26": "The possible interactions of the anti-asthmatic compound, eprozinol, with bronchoconstrictors and adrenergic agents were investigated in the anaesthetised guinea pig by means of the following techniques: (1) study of the inhibition of histamine- and serotonin-induced bronchospasm; (2) investigation of potentiation or antagonism between the anti-bronchoconstrictor effects of eprozinol and isoprenaline; (3) investigation of propranolol-induced blockade of the anti-bronchoconstrictor effects of eprozinol and several reference compounds. In the anaesthetised guinea pig, eprozinol (5 mge . kg-1), isoprenaline (2 micrograms . kg-1) and theophylline (15 mg . kg-1) administered intravenously cause a clear inhibition of the bronchospasm induced by intravenous perfusion of histamine or serotonin, with an intensity not significantly different for all three compounds. The anti-bronchoconstrictor activities of eprozinol and isoprenaline with regard to histamine are directly additive and show absolutely no interference with one another. Propranolol is without effect on in vivo anti-bronchoconstrictor activity of eprozinol on tracheal musculature. It is concluded that the mechanisms brought into play by eprozinol to exert anti-bronchoconstrictor and bronchorelaxant activity, are completely independent of the adrenergic system.", 
    "27": "12 patients suffering from chronic coronary insufficiency with signs of ischemia in the ECG, were treated orally with 200 mg of acebutolol t.i.d. for a period of 3 weeks. The following parameters were examined at the beginning of the therapy as well as at the end of every week: number of stenocardiac attacks, characteristics of pain, nitroglycerin consumption, B.P., H.R., respiratory rate, ECG, maximal exercise test, PEP, LVET, PEP/LVET at rest and immediately after effort. The treatment with acebutolol was effective inducing an improvement of subjective symptoms (reduction of stenocardiac crises, intensity and duration of angor, trinitrin pearls consumption) and an increase of effort tolerance. The utility of the therapy was also proved by the reduction of the systolic pressure and by the following decrease of hemodynamic overload and, therefore, of the heart muscle's work. This positive effect is due to the reduction of the myocardial oxygen consumption, modulated among others by the bradycardiac action of the drug. The cardioselectivity of acebutolol avoided to cause peripherical disorders usually observed with other non selective beta blocking drugs.", 
    "28": "The effects or oral atenolol (100 mg once/day) and metoprolol (100 mg once/day, 100 mg twice/day and 300 mg once/day) have been compared with placebo on the heart rate and systolic blood pressure responses to exercise in 5 healthy volunteers. The drugs were given for 5 days in a double blind randomised fashion with each volunteer receiving each dose of drug. Measurements were made after the first dose on day 1 and after 5 days of dosing. The results on both heart rate and systolic blood pressure showed that overall (over a 24 h period) after acute (day 1) or after chronic (5 days) dosing, atenolol 100 mg once/day, metoprolol 100 mg twice/day and 300 mg once/day, were equivalent as beta-adrenoceptor blocking doses. Thus milligram for milligram atenolol and metoprolol do not produce equivalent blockade on the cardiovascular system of man.", 
    "29": "The general disposition of [14C]-Pranolium Chloride (SC-27761), a potential anti-arrhythmic agent, has been studied in the beagle dog, baboon and rhesus monkey. The compound was moderately absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract of the three species at 5 mg/kg. There was appreciable inter-animal variation in the amount of absorption, and the absorption was dose-dependent in the monkey. After i.v. dosage the radioactivity was largely cleared via the kidneys. The initial elimination half-lives for Pranolium in the dog and primate were between 0.6 to 3.1 hours after i.v. dosage, but could not be determined after oral dosage. Less than 1% of the dose was localised in monkey fetal tissues, two hours after an i.v. dose was given to pregnant female rhesus monkeys, and the highest concentrations of radiolabel were detected in fetal liver. Pranolium was found to be extensively metabolised and 1-naphthol was identified as a major metabolite. Pranolium was excreted in urine both unchanged and as conjugates, but 1-naphthol was excreted largely as conjugates.", 
    "30": "A study was carried out in 12 healthy volunteers to determine the effects of 0.25% and 0.5% pindolol eye drops on intraocular pressure. The results showed that both concentrations produced similar and highly significant falls in intraocular pressure after single instillation into the conjunctival sacs, the effect being measured with a non-contact tonometer. No significant changes were found in resting heart rate.", 
    "31": "A post-marketing surveillance programme was carried out in general practice to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose combination of 100 mg metoprolol and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, with particular reference to elderly patients. Patients received a single daily dose over a period of 3 months. The results of the analysis of data from 1446 patients showed that, although the initial blood pressure was higher in the elderly, both the systolic and diastolic pressures were reduced by the same degree after 3-months' treatment, regardless of age. The incidence of side-effects was similar in all age groups, although a higher proportion of these side-effects led to treatment withdrawal in the elderly, possibly reflecting an increasing overall intolerance to drugs with age. The results suggest that treatment with the metoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide combination is effective and well tolerated in the majority of hypertensive patients, irrespective of age or previous antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "32": "An autoradiographic study was performed on the effects of hydrocortisone, reserpine, propranolol and phentolamine on the uptake of tritiated amines by adrenal medullary cells of the mouse. Oral feeding of hydrocortisone ahd no significant effect on the normal uptake pattern of dopamine, noradrenaline or adrenaline by medullary cells of different type (A cells or NA cells) or location (marginal or central), although the overall amounts taken up were markedly reduced. Handling the animals led to similar reductions in the uptake of all three amines and was thus clearly shown to be the important factor in this effect. Reserpine reduced the uptake of [3H] noradrenaline to 25% of the control value although the relative distribution remained unchanged. Propranolol and phentolamine had no observed effect on [3H] noradrenaline uptake. These results are discussed in the light of the previously reported action of ACTH in reversing the effects of hypophysectomy on medullary amine uptake (Hirano and Kobayashi 1978), and it is concluded that ACTH must exert this effect directly on the adrenal medulla rather than through the secretion of adrenal corticosteroids. It is also suggested that reserpine acts, as in neurons, by blocking amine uptake into intracellular granules rather than by blocking uptake into the cell itself.", 
    "33": "The effects of the Chinese herb Wu-Chu-Yu (Evodiae fructus) on the cardiovascular function were assessed in anesthetized cats, conscious rats, and isolated preparations of rat aortic strip and auricle. In anesthetized cats, intravenous administration of alcohol-water crude extracts of Wu-Chu-Yu (0.03-0.24 g/kg) produced a dose-dependent hypertension and an increased contractile force of nictitating membrane which lasted for more than 5 min in higher doses. Phentolamine, but not tetraethylammonium antagonized hypertension and the increased contractile force of nictitating membrane induced by Wu-Chu-Yu. In conscious rats, hypertension was also observed by intraperitoneal administration of Wu-Chu-Yu (6 g/kg). Bilateral nephrectomy, administration of phentolamine or propranolol, all significantly decreased the hypertensive effect of Wu-Chu-Yu. Pretreatment with reserpine 24 hours in advance did not change the pressor effect of the crude extract. In aortic strip preparations, Wu-Chu-Yu caused the increase of contractile force, and the dose-response curve was parallel shift to the right in the presence of phentolamine. In auricle preparations, Wu-Chu-Yu produced positive inotropic and positive chronotropic effects, and the presence of propranolol changed the slope of Wu-Chu-Yu's dose-inotropic effect curve and reversed the chronotropic effect from positive to negative. Both in vivo and in vitro results suggested that alpha and beta adrenoceptors were directly involved in the cardiovascular effects of Wu-Chu-Yu.", 
    "34": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (V. I. P.) has been demonstrated in neuronal elements of smooth muscle organs including the urinary bladder, thus indicating that this peptide may be a neurohumoral transmitter. In isolated strips of rabbit urinary bladder we have demonstrated that V. I. P. causes relaxation. Unlike the relaxant effect of the beta agonist isoproterenol, the inhibition produced by V. I. P. could not be blocked by propranolol. These studies indicate that V. I. P. may play a role in the regulation of bladder contractility.U", 
    "35": "Eighty-seven patients with intractable hypertension received minoxidil for a mean duration of 27 months (range three months to five years). A significant reduction in mean outpatient blood pressure from 206/129 to 158/98 mmHg (p less than 0.001 for both systolic and diastolic values) was recorded after one month's treatment. In 26 patients who received minoxidil for four or more years a further reduction in mean blood pressure to 147/89 mmHg was achieved. The mean daily dose of minoxidil was 23 mg (range 2.5 to 60 mg). In all patients a beta adrenergic neurone blocker and a diuretic were prescribed with minoxidil to counteract tachycardia and fluid retention. Thirteen patients required the addition of a fourth hypotensive agent. The use of minoxidil led to simpler drug regimens with the majority of patients well controlled on twice daily or once daily schedules. Most patients commented spontaneously on a feeling of improved wellbeing while taking minoxidil which also appeared to be relatively free from side effects commonly encountered with other hypotensive drugs, particularly drowsiness, dizziness and impotence. Fluid retention of 7 kg or more occurred in 18 patients, more commonly in those with renal impairment, but could be controlled by increasing the dose or potency of diuretics. Four patients with end stage renal failure and one patient with normal renal function developed pericardial effusions. Hirsutism was universal and limited the usefulness of the drug in women. We currently recommend minoxidil for hypertensive men who diastolic blood pressure remains greater than or equal to 110 mmHg despite an adequate trial of a beta adrenergic neurone blocker, diuretic and an additional drug, or for patients who find the side effects of such therapy intolerable.", 
    "36": "The contractile effect of propranolol in isolated rabbit ear artery was assessed in reserpinized and in surgically and chemically denervated blood vessels. Reserpinization and surgical denervation either had no effect on or enhanced the ear artery contractile response to 10(-6) to 10(-4) M propranolol. In contrast, the contractile response to propranolol was nearly abolished after denervation of the ear artery in vitro with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Dose-response curves to norepinephrine were shifted to the left by factors of 4.9 in 6-OHDA denervated ear arteries and 15.6 in untreated arteries in the presence of 10(-7) M desipramine. The diluent for 6-OHDA shifted both the norepinephrine and propranolol dose-response curves to the right. It is proposed that propranolol caused a contractile response in ear artery by an action on the postsynaptic tissues of this vessel. 6-OHDA denervation caused nonspecific desensitization in rabbit ear artery leading to the loss of response of this vessel to propranolol.", 
    "37": "Clinical trials of beta-blocking drugs in hypertensive subjects have shown that these drugs do not affect blood pressure significantly at night or during the early morning. Labetalol, which is a combined alpha- and beta-blocking agent, reduces mean blood pressure levels at all times. These studies strongly support the hypothesis of a circadian rhythm of alpha-receptor-mediated-sympathetic activity.", 
    "38": "A fatal case of propranolol intoxication is described. The patient had ingested 3-5 g of the drug and probably no other drugs. Gastric lavage could not be performed due to some kind of obstruction in the distal part of the oesophagus. At autopsy, the oesophagus was normal, and a spasm due to B-blockade is suggested. Epileptiform seizures resistant to treatment with diazepam and barbiturates were frequent and probably not solely caused by cerebral ischaemia.", 
    "39": "Increasing doses of propranolol were injected intraperitoneally to four series of adult male rats in order to study the effect of this beta-blocking agent on various organs (testis, epididymis, prostate and seminal vesicle) and endocrine glands (adrenals, pancreas, thyroid, pituitary). Histological damage was observed only in testes: i.e., necrosis and desquamation of germinal cells in the seminiferous tubules associated with light arterial vasoconstriction. Pelviperitoneal fibrosis was observed as well. These lesions seem to be of pharmacological vascular origin and appear to occur in combination with an elective toxic effect of propranolol on the germinal cells.", 
    "40": "Timolol is a non-specific beta-blocking agent acting on both beta 1 and beta 2 receptors while metoprolol is a specific beta 1 blocking agent. Both timolol and metoprolol decrease intraocular pressure by reducing aqueous humor secretion without increasing facility of outflow. They have both similar short and long term efficacy which does not diminish even after several months of use. Generally, there are adequate to treat glaucoma without perimetric changes, while treatment of glaucoma with functional defects requires their association with miotics. When blocking beta 1 receptors, timolol causes marked constriction of bronchi and peripheral vessels. Hence, it is contraindicated in bronchial asthma and ischemic optic neuropathy. This is not the case with metoprolol, which does not block beta 2 receptors.", 
    "41": "Serum lipoproteins were determined in 15 patients before and during antihypertensive treatment with atenolol (0.1-0.2 g/day for a mean of 8 months. The mean blood pressure fell from 171/103 to 154/93 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Significant lipoprotein changes were an increase in very low density triglycerides (VLDL-TG) from 1.21 +/- 0.95 (SD) to 1.62 +/- 1.24 mmol/l (p less than 0.01) and in low density (LDL) TG from 0.46 +/- 0.12 to 0.51 +/- 0.12 mmol/l (p less than 0.05). Together, these TG increases resulted in development of hypertriglyceridaemia in 7/15 patients during atenolol treatment. No effect on whole serum cholesterol or on the high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were found. Thus, some patients on long term treatment with atenolol seem to received the benefit of normotension at the cost of hypertriglyceridaemia. This may have practical implications, since hypertriglyceridaemia, constitutes an important risk factor for atherosclerosis.", 
    "42": "In 10 healthy volunteers the time course of cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity, plasma levels and cumulative urinary excretion of pindolol were compared during a 4-day course of pindolol 5 mg (Visken) t. d. s., and one tablet of pindolol 20 mg retard (Visken retard) once a day. After oral administration of the 20 mg retard tablet, plasma concentrations of pindolol higher than half the maximum value (1/2 Cp (tmax)) were maintained about 2.5 times as long as after administration of the conventional 5 mg tablet. This is evidence for an important and marked retardation of drug release. During treatment with pindolol 20 mg retard once daily, cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade, measured by the reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia and in the exercise-induced rise in systolic blood pressure, at almost all times throughout the 24 h period was at least as great as during treatment with pindolol 5 mg t. d. s. This suggests that patients successfully treated with pindolol 5 mg t. d. s. can be maintained with the same beta-adrenoceptor blockade by a single tablet of pindolol 20 mg retard once daily.", 
    "43": "Basal and adrenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase (AC) was studied in biopsy specimens of the gastric and duodenal mucosa from 112 individuals. AC activities were log normally distributed. AC of fundic and antral gastric mucosa responded to adrenaline in a concentration-dependent manner, that of the duodenal mucosa did not respond to adrenaline. The degree of activation in biopsies of normal gastric mucosa was similar to that of patients with chronic atrophic gastritis or patients antrectomized according to the Billroth method. AC in biopsies from cimetidine-treated peptic ulcer patients was less sensitive to adrenaline than AC in biopsies from untreated patients. The threshold concentration of cimetidine to inhibit adrenaline-stimulated AC in vitro was 10(-6) mol/l. The data provide evidence of an adrenaline-sensitive AC in cells other than parietal cells and show an inhibitory action of cimetidine on the catecholamine-sensitive AC in the human gastric mucosa.", 
    "44": "The apparent partition coefficient (Kapp.) of propranolol hydrochloride alone and in the presence of hydrochlorothiazide and frusemide were determined between chloroform and artificial intestinal juice. Both diuretics significantly reduced the relatively high Kapp. of propranolol hydrochloride. On the other hand, the relatively low Kapp. of both diuretics were significantly increased by the presence of propranolol hydrochloride. Also in vitro solubility studies were carried out using the Sartorius solubility simulator. The frequently prescribed therapeutic combination of propranolol hydrochloride tablets and either hydrochlorothiazide or frusemide tablets seems, on the whole to have similar in vitro solubility patterns when compared to those of the individual drugs. However, the mutual effects on the apparent partition coefficient revealed in the present work can be one of the factors responsible for improving the in vitro absorption of propranolol hydrochloride and the diuretics when present together.", 
    "45": "We examined the direct effects of isoproterenol (ISO) and L-norepinephrine (NE) on electrolyte transport in isolated rabbit cortical collecting tubules (CCT) perfused in vitro. The addition of either ISO (10(-6) M) or NE (10(-6) M) to the bath decreased transepithelial potential difference (PD), on average by 51 and 25%, respectively. These effects of ISO and NE were abolished by prior addition of the beta-adrenergic blocker, L-propranolol. ISO (10(-5) M) had no effect from lumen. Also, osmotic water permeability was not influenced by ISO. Ouabain and ISO had additive effects on PD. Elimination of chloride from both perfusate and bath, or addition of acetazolamide, abolished the effect of ISO on PD. Although isotopic sodium flux for lumen to bath was not influenced by ISO, chemical net chloride absorption increased from 1.1 +/- 0.4 to 2.7 +/- 0.6 peq . cm-1 . sec-1 (n = 8, p less than 0.005). In conclusion, both ISO and NE and capable of decreasing PD in rabbit CCT perfused in vitro. This effect is mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors and is accompanied by the increase in net chloride absorption. Although the mechanism responsible for this decrease in PD with ISO in unclear, active chloride absorption, active hydrogen secretion, or membrane chloride permeability changes may account for the effects of ISO.", 
    "46": "Although propranolaol is effective and widely used for many disorders, there are reports of it causing side effects severe enough to warrant its discontinuance. A 71-year-old female is reported to have experienced diarrhea and weight loss from the use of propranolol 20 mg qid. On discontinuing the drug, the diarrhea quickly resolved. On rechallenge with 10 mg qid the patient displayed no problems; however, when the dosage was increased to 20 mg qid, the diarrhea returned. When the drug was discontinued the second time, the diarrhea stopped again. The occurrence of diarrhea in any patient receiving propranolol should cause consideration of an adverse drug reaction.", 
    "47": "A fluoroimmunoassay for the determination of serum of plasma levels of propranolol was developed using antibodies to propranolol coupled to magnetizable solid-phase particles and fluorescein-labeled propranolol as tracer. The method was sufficiently sensitive, precise, and specific for application to routine monitoring of propranolol therapy, and gave good correlation (r = 0.99) with a widely used ultraviolet fluorometric method in the assay of patients' specimens. The fluoroimmunoassay involves the same instrumentation as the fluorometric assay and has practical advantages, including greater sensitivity (only 100 microliters of sample required), avoidance of an extraction step, and visible-wavelength fluorometry, which permits the use of disposable plastic apparatus throughout the entire procedure.", 
    "48": "A method is described for the simultaneous measurement of cardiac output (CO), using the thermodilution method, and arterial blood pressure in conscious unrestrained rats. For the injection of the indicator solution (ice-cold, 0.9% saline) and for the measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, chronically-implanted polyethylene cathethers were used, while CO was measured transpulmonarily with a commercially available CO computer and an acutely-implanted (via caudal artery) arterial thermistor catheter. The following were observed in 10 rats at rest: a CO of 40.2 +/- 1.9 ml/min/100 g, a mean arterial blood pressure of 106 +/- 5 mmHg, a heart rate of 417 +/- 20 beats/min and a peripheral vascular resistance of 2.68 +/- 0.13 mmHG/(ml/min/100 g). After injection of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline, there was a rise in CO and heart rate, while peripheral resistance and blood pressure were lowered. Injection of the beta-receptor-blocked propranolol caused decreases in CO and heart rate, while peripheral resistance and blood pressure rose. It is concluded, that the method described here for the simultaneous measurement of CO and arterial blood pressure is suitable for the investigation of drug-induced cardiovascular effects in conscious rats.", 
    "49": "The total content of oxidized (NAD+ plus NADP+) and reduced (NAD . H/ plus NADP . H2) forms of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotides was detected in the myocardium of 7, 30-day- and 3--5 month-old (adult) noninbred white rats exposed to the alpha-adrenoblockers dibenamine and phentolamine (5 mg/kg) and to the beta-adrenoblockers anaprilin and alfeprol (1 mg/kg). It was shown that the content of nicotinamide coenzymes in the myocardium of growing rats exposed to different adrenoblockers changes depending on neurohumoral regulation and metabolism of the heart muscle within each age period.", 
    "50": "The findings in six patients admitted to hospital 0.5-4.5 h after the ingestion of an overdose of 2.4-8 g sotalol are described. In addition to bradycardia and hypotension, all patients had a considerably prolonged corrected Q-T interval, up to 172 +/- 8% of normal. Severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred in five of the six patients, the risk was greatest up to 20 h after the ingestion of sotalol. The long Q-T interval returned to normal over 3 to 4 days, which is consistent with the long half-life of sotalol. In addition to its beta-blocking action, sotalol has marked electrophysiological properties of a Class III antiarrhythmic drugs, which are likely to be able to account for its observed effects. Special attention should be paid to the risk of severe ventricular arrhythmias in sotalol intoxications.", 
    "51": "Relative sensitivities tp ouabain of atrial and ventricular muscles from 1-week and 4-month rabbits were compared in vitro. Ventricular muscles were also studied with prior treatment that minimized unphysiological, stimulation-induced release of norepinephrine (propanolol and/or reserpinization). Atrial and pretreated ventricular muscles from the newborn showed (a) higher sensitivity to ouabain and (b) the same \"relative' positive inotropic effect (RPIE) when compared to those of the adult (RPIE is ouabain-induced inotropism relative to the maximal calcium-induced inotropism and represents ouabain-specific-inotropism). With no prior treatment, ventricular muscles from the newborn showed a nonsignificant tendency toward a lower sensitivity to ouabain and a significantly lower RPIE than those of the adult. These results suggest that under normal physiological conditions, the newborn myocardium may be more sensitive to ouabain than that of the adult.", 
    "52": "Eleven patients suffering from WHO stage II essential arterial hypertension were treated with the combination of labetalol plus chlorthalidone in the reciprocal ratio of 10:1 in the form of once-a-day administration in the morning. The dosage was individualized on the basis of hypotensive response and side effects until an acceptable blood pressure was achieved. The duration of the treatment was 45 days with blood pressure measurements after 7, 15, and 45 days. By the end of the first week of therapy significant reductions had already been obtained in systolic arterial pressure (down from 181 +/- 24 to 157 +/- 9 mmHg, P less than 0.01) and diastolic arterial pressure (down from 110 +/- 7 to 96 +/- 7 mmHg, P less than 0.01), reductions which were also maintained over time. The mean dosage at the time of the final measurement was 150 mg (136 mg labetalol and 14 mg chlorthalidone). In no case were orthostatic hypotension phenomena observed, and the side effects proved modest without requiring suspension of the therapy. Because of the simplification of the therapy, patient compliance was good.", 
    "53": "The left anterior descending coronary artery was constricted for eight minutes on two occasions in 13 anaesthetised open-chest dogs. One group (n = 8) was studied before and afer 1 mg . kg-1 propranolol intravenously; a second group (n = 5) served as controls. Simultaneous blood samples were drawn from arterial and coronary sinus catheters for measurement of lactate and catecholamine concentrations. In controls, coronary artery constriction resulted in a reproducible fall in fractional myocardial lactate extraction and an increase in left atrial pressure, but caused no significant changes in blood pressure, heart rate or plasma concentrations of noradrenaline, adrenaline, or dopamine. In the treated group, heart rate was reduced but blood pressure was the same after propranolol; both remained unchanged during constriction and after release. The fall in fractional lactate extraction was abolished by propranolol. Arterial noradrenaline increased significantly after propranolol, fell during constriction and rose again after release. A similar trend was observed in coronary sinus noradrenaline. Reversible myocardial ischaemia is not associated with peripheral or myocardial release of catecholamines. Pre-treatment with propranolol appears to exert a protective effect on the myocardium even during reversible ischaemia. Although peripheral noradrenaline levels are increased after propranolol, this increase is not maintained during coronary artery constriction.", 
    "54": "Previous studies have shown that oral administration of minoxidil on 2 consecutive days produces an increase in heart rate and myocardial necrosis in Beagle dogs. Propranolol treatment (1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg every 8 h) did not abolish tachycardia and did not alter the incidence or severity of minoxidil-induced necrosis. In the present studies, pretreatment with either furosenmide (10 mg/kg) or hydrochlorothiazide (250 mg/kg) reduced serum potassium levels. However, only furosemide (for 11 days) reduced significantly the incidence of minoxidil-induced necrosis; only 2 of 10 animals (20%) developed myocardial lesions compared to 11 of 14 (79%) in the non-treated group. The incidence and severity of lesions in hearts from animals treated with furosemide for 3 days or hydrochlorothiazide for 11 days were essentially the same as in animals given minoxidil alone. Thus, furosemide, under certain conditions, can reduce the incidence of acute ventricular lesions induced by minoxidil.", 
    "55": "The combination of sotalol and hydrochlorothiazide in a fixed ratio of 6.4:1 was evaluated in thirty patients with uncomplicated hypertension. In the first part of the study, once daily administration of an optimal dose of the combination was significantly more effective than either hydrochlorothiazide or sotalol alone in lowering both the supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Blood pressure was still controlled 24 h after the previous dose. Serum potassium fell by 0.37 mEq/l from the mean pretreatment value after treatment with the combination, but it still remained within the normal range. In the second part of the study the long term effect of the combination on blood pressure, heart rate and biochemical parameters was studied in twenty patients. Supine and standing blood pressure fell by 28.7/15.3 mmHg and 29.5/17.6 mmHg, respectively (p less than 0.001). Serum potassium was 3.98 +/- 0.07 mEq/l after twelve months of therapy; potassium supplements were not administered. Like serum potassium, the other biochemical parameters remained within the normal range. The combination was well tolerated on long term use, and only one patient withdrew from the study.", 
    "56": "None of the betamimetics have a exclusively tocolytic effect. By stimulating the cardiovascular beta-receptor, they also cause a substantial increase in the heart rate and a decrease in blood pressure. We administered 4--5 micrograms/min of Fenoterol to 13 patients during the first stage of labour. This led to complete inhibition of labour. To reduce cardiac side effects, a primarily cardiac beta-blocker (5 mg Atenolol or 20 mg Metoprolol) was also given. The maternal and fetal heart rates were measured by ECG and by fetal scalp-electrode, respectively. The fetal heart rate remained largely unchanged, both during the Fenoterol infusion as well as during the additional administration of the beta-blocker. The maternal heart rate, which increased under the influence of the Fenoterol, fell (p less than or equal to 0.01) but did not return to normal. In all cases the beta-blockade led to a brief increase in uterine activity.", 
    "57": "Second degree pacemaker block is a safety mechanism of the synchronous pacer at atrial rates above 120-130. The aim of the present study was to determine the work level at which pacemaker block occurred before and after beta-blockade. Seven patients (mean age 53 y.) were submitted to graded, submaximal exercise on a bicycle ergometer without drug and after 0.8 mg pindolol i.v. (6 pats.) or alprenolol orally (1 pat.). Pacemaker block developed at much higher total work after beta-blockade in 3 patients (5800 vs. 1900 kpm. p less than 0.0005), while 4 patients had to stop work due to exhaustion before pacemaker block occurred. Total work increased significantly after beta-blockade (p less than 0.005). Lack of a stable i.v. atrial electrode has delayed the extensive use of the synchronous pacemaker. The design of the generator, however, is not optimal block occurs is too low for a number of patients. beta-Blockade effectively delays the occurrence of pacemaker block and can be of therapeutic value. It is suggested that the P-synchronous pacer should be redesigned with a programmable basic rate (50-70 beats/min) and a programmable upper rate (130-180 beats/min) to ensure that the obvious physiologic advantages of the atrial triggered pacemaker can be maintained both at rest and during physical exercise.", 
    "58": "Plasma propranolol steady-state concentrations (Css) were measured in 24 hyperthyroid and 6 hypothyroid patients before and after correction of the thyroid disorder. Following treatment of hyperthyroidism by surgery, antithyroid drugs or radioiodine, there was a significant rise in the plasma propranolol Css in patients receiving propranolol either 160 mg/day, 240 mg/day, or 480 mg/day. In addition, in five patients the area under the plasma propranolol concentration versus time curve during a dosing interval increased significantly from 405 ng/ml/h when hyperthyroid to 778 ng/ml/h when euthyroid. In the hypothyroid patients given propranolol 160 mg/day concomitantly with 1-thyroxine therapy the plasma propranolol Css fell significantly when euthyroid. There was a small but significant increase in the degree of plasma protein binding of propranolol, following treatment of hyperthyroidism and a significant decrease following correction of hypothyroidism. It is concluded that thyroid disorders markedly influence propranolol handling.", 
    "59": "The haemodynamic effects of intravenous metoprolol, over the dose-range 2.5--20 mg, were studied in 12 patients with coronary heart disease. The pharmacodynamic activity of the drug was confirmed by the suppression of exercise systolic pressure and tachycardia. There were statistically significant dose-response reductions in systolic and diastolic pressures, heart rate and cardiac output together with a dose-related increase in pulmonary wedge pressure. In patients with coronary heart disease intravenous metoprolol should probably not exceed the doses used in this study and should be administered with caution in patients with impairment of pumping function.", 
    "60": "1. The effect of prolonged administration of beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agents was studied in growing rabbits. Equivalent doses of propranolol and timolol were given parenterally for 8 weeks. 2. Animals given propranolol had a significantly lower heart rate than that in the controls. After subcutaneous injection, plasma propranolol levels were twice those obtained after intraperitoneal injection. 3. Growth rate of animals given propranolol intraperitoneally was significantly less than controls, whereas animals given propranolol subcutaneously or timolol intraperitoneally grew normally. Reduced growth rate was associated with reduced food intake and was not related to the beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking activity of the drugs. 4. At the end of the experiment the heart and other organs were examined. beta-Adrenoreceptor blockade produced no significant changes in ventricular size or water content, and no significant changes in ultrastructure were found.", 
    "61": "Concomitant administration of antacid increased the maximum concentration (Cpmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of 100 mg oral dose of metoprolol by 25 per cent (p less than 0.05) and 11 per cent (p less than 0.1) respectively. For atenolol the opposite effect was observed and Cpmax and AUC were decreased by 37 and 33 per cent respectively (p less than 0.02). In both cases the antacid did not affect the time-course of atenolol in the plasma or its bioavailability. Propantheline prolonged the absorption phase of atenolol and the time of peaking (tmax) was shifted from 2.1 to 4.5 h. Cpmax of atenolol was essentially unchanged by propantheline pretreatment while the AUC was increased by 36 per cent. It is concluded that the negative effect of the antacid on the bioavailability of atenolol is caused by a reduction in the in vivo dissolution rate due to increased gastric pH. The positive effect of propantheline might be due either to more efficient absorption of atenolol in the upper part of the intestine or more extensive dissolution of the drug as a result of prolonged contact with gastric juice or a combination of these factors.", 
    "62": "A radioimmunoassay has been developed for propranolol with a sensitivity of 2.37 nmol l-1 in unextracted plasma using a 50 microliter sample. Plasma concentration measurements were made on samples from volunteers for up to 8 h after they had been given 5, 10, or 40 mg of propranolol by mouth. Analysis of the results showed that mean elimination half-lives and total body clearances were similar following each of the doses and that the area under the curve was proportional to the dose. Steady-state propranolol concentrations in 17 patients on regular propranolol treatment were linearly related to the dose ver the range 20-640 mg d-1; the regression line extrapolated to the origin. These data indicate non-saturable kinetics for the hepatic metabolism of propranolol within the dose ranges investigated and lead us to believe that there is no 'oral-threshold' dose for propranolol. The radioimmunoassay may be useful in clinical practice for monitoring plasma propranolol concentrations and for detecting patient compliance.", 
    "63": "In this comparative bioavailability study two sustained release capsule formulations of propranolol, one a clinical trial formulation and the other the U.K. sales formulation ('Inderal' LA), were compared with a conventional 'Inderal' tablet. Twelve healthy adult male volunteers received, on cross-over basis, on three separate occasions, 160 mg oral doses of three formulations of 'Inderal'. Bioavailability was based on concentration of propranolol in whole blood. The peak blood level and area under the propranolol blood level curve fell as the dissolution time increased. The half-lives of the three formulations were inversely proportional to their dissolution rates, those of the sustained release formulations being considerably longer than that of the conventional tablet. The 160 mg 'Inderal' tablet produced a rapid 90-fold decline over 24 h in propranolol blood levels following a high initial peak. By comparison both sustained release formulations showed a less rapid fall in systemic levels and gave higher blood levels at the end of 24 h and plateau values between 8 and 14 ng ml-1. The 'Inderal' LA sustained release formulation gave consistently higher propranolol blood levels than the clinical trial sustained release formulation. This result is in good agreement with their dissolution profiles. The lowering of the systemic bioavailability as the dissolution time increases is thought to be due to an increased metabolism of propranolol.", 
    "64": "We present a method for the analysis of antidysrhythmic drugs [procainamide, acecainide (NAPA), lidocaine, quinidine, disopyramide, N-desisopropyl disopyramide, and propranolol] in serum. The drugs, together with an internal standard, are extracted from 0.2-1.0 ml of serum, separated on an octyl-bonded reversed-phase column using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile/phosphate buffer, and monitored by either ultraviolet or fluorescence spectrophotometry. The proposed method offers good reproducibility, sensitivity, linearity, and accuracy. Of more than 50 drugs and metabolites, tested for possible interference, only diazepam, flurazepam, and the N-oxide metabolite of quinidine interfere with quinidine analysis, while meperidine coelutes with disopyramide. However, diazepam and flurazepam do not interfere with quinidine analysis with fluorescence detection.", 
    "65": "A preliminary report is given on the first 500 patients entered in an on-going open study in general practice of a combination of 10 mg timolol maleate and 2.5 mg bendrofluazide used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a 2-week placebo period, dose titration was conducted at weekly intervals, with a final assessment 8 weeks after the diastolic blood pressure was controlled. Data for 472 patients out of 492 commencing active therapy were evaluated. Four-hundred and thirty-seven (93%) became normotensive (less than or equal to mmHg diastolic) on a mean dose of 1.9 tablets taken as a single daily dose. Control was maintained over the follow-up period in all but 13 (2.6%) patients who required a dosage reduction and 2 (0.4%) who required a dosage increase. The incidence of side-effects was low, 22 (4.4%) patients stopping treatment due to adverse events. Biochemical parameters all stayed within normal values. The rapidity of dosage titration, patient acceptability, compliance with regard to the once daily dosage and the low incidence of side-effects suggest that the timolol/bendrofluazide combination approaches optimum therapy for mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "66": "1. The absorption, distribution, excretion and metabolism of pindolol were studied in rhesus monkeys after a single oral dose of 2.5 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg and after a chronic treatment of 5 years at the same daily dosage. 2. The pharmacokinetic parameters were the same for animals which received pindolol for the first time, and animals which underwent the 5 years' chronic treatment. An elimination half-life of 1.5 to 1.9 h was estimated in plasma for unchanged pindolol. 3. The distribution pattern of unchanged pindolol determined fluorimetrically, as well as total 14C in the tissues, following administration of [14C]pindolol showed no difference between a single dose and 5 years of chronic treatment. No accumulation of pindolol or metabolites was detected in the tissues of chronically treated animals. A mean elimination half-life of 10h was evaluated in 21 organs. 4. Acutely dosed and chronically treated rhesus monkeys showed the same metabolic pattern in urine. There was no evidence for induction or inhibition of the metabolism of pindolol."
