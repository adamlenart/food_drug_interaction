Relaxation of isolated guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle with isoproterenol hydrochloride, salbutamol hemisulfate and clorprenaline hydrochloride, was markedly increased by continous infusion of DET. This result may suggest that DET, an alpha-receptor blocker, can be used together with bronchodilators such as beta-receptor stimulator for the treatment of various chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.", 
    "1": "Renal papillary necrosis was induced in rats by daily subcutaneous injection of 15 mg 2-bromoethylamine hydrobromide (BEA) per 100 g of body weight for 2 successive days. This dose was 50% higher than that reported previously. Beta adrenergic receptor blockade with oxyprenolol did not influence the kidney damage. The administration of heparin did not show any effect. The doses applied did not induce the incoagulability for a sufficient period of time. On the contrary, treatment with hydrocortisone decreased papillary necrosis without inducing increased diuresis.", 
    "2": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) have basal levels of plasma renin activity (PRA) lower than the ones observed in normal Sprague Dawley rats. Three beta blocking agents are orally administered to unanesthetized spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats. Propranolol and S 464 reduce PRA in spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive control rats. Pindolol do not lower PRA in normotensive rats but increases levels of PRA in spontaneously hypertensive rats. These results are discussed.", 
    "3": "Intravenous injection of isoproterenol increases plasma renin activity (PRA) in anesthetized dogs. S. 464, a new beta adrenergic blocking agent, injected five minutes before isoproterenol, inhibits plasma renin hyperactivity. On the other hand, teclothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, induces no significant modification of the isoproterenol-induced increase of PRA. The combination of both compounds (five parts of S. 464, one part of diuretic), assumes the same inhibitory effects as S. 464 alone. These results and other experimental data (antihypertensive and diuretic activities) are discussed and explain the interest of such an association as a rational therapy of arterial hypertensive disorders.", 
    "4": "Previous studies have indicated the existance of haemodynamically important structural vascular changes in patients and animals with hypertension. Possible pathophysiological implications of these changes are discussed. Two studies dealing with the question of reversibility of the structural changes on long-term blood pressure lowering therapy are described. The results indicate that the changes are partially but not completely reversible.", 
    "5": "One hundred and forty-seven patients with essential hypertension participated in this multicentre study. The results indicate that metoprolol in a dosage of 150-450 mg daily is an effective and well tolerated therapy both in patients previously untreated and in patients unsatisfactorily treated with other antihypertensive agents.", 
    "6": "The authors carried out a study on beta-adrenergic blockers Proprafnolol, Pindolol and Practolol, on an isolated uterus of a rat, obtained at various phases oestrus. The Beta-adrenergic blocker Pindolol manifested inhibiting effect on the spontaneous contractility of the uterus more marked after elevated level of gestagens. The pharmacological analysis gave foundation to the authors to assume that the relaxation of Pindolol was due to direct myotropic action. Propranolol in large doses and at high gestagenic level manifested antioxytocic activity. Practolol did not affect both spontaneous uterine activity as oxytoxin contraction.", 
    "7": "Essential hypertension (EH) can be subdivided according to the sympathetic and renin activity into two contrasting forms: (1) borderline beta-hyperadrenergic renin hyperresponsive and (2) stable beta-hypoadrenergic renin hyporesponsive EH. These two forms probably represent two expreme poles in the spectrum of EH in which sympathetic and renin hyper- or hyporeactivity cannot be accounted for by catecholamine determinations solely. beta-Adrenergic responsiveness monitored by plasma cyclic AMP determinations revealed plasma cyclic AMP, renin and circulatory hyperresponsiveness to isoproterenol in borderline hyperadrenergic EH while the opposite, cyclic AMP and renin hyporesponsiveness to insulin-induced hypoglycemia have been described in low renin stable EH. The kidney is in the center of the adrenergic abnormality in the two forms of EH with the borderline one excreting into the urine catecholamines not accounted for by their glomerular filtration. Catecholamines solely, however, do not account for the differences in both forms of EH which can probably be attributed to their different beta-adrenergic responsiveness.", 
    "8": "In cats anaesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, the posterior hypothalamus was superfused and electrically stimulated with a push-pull cannula. The pressor response to stimulation of this hypothalamic area was inhibited when the hypothalamus was superfused with drugs blocking either alpha-adrenoreceptors (piperoxan, tolazoline), or beta-adrenoreceptors--(+/-)-propranolol, (-)-propranolol, practolol, sotalol, metoprolol. (+)-Propranolol and a concentration of procaine equianaesthetic to propranolol were ineffective. During superfusion with tolazoline in the presence of practolol the inhibition was twice as that when the hypothalamus was superfused with either tolazoline or practolol. In another series of experiments the push-pull cannula was inserted into the anterior hypothalamus. The depressor response to stimulation of this area was inhibited by the hypothalamic superfusion with the alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs phentolamine, tolazoline, piperoxan or yohimbine. Hypothalamic superfusion with phenylephrine abolished the inhibitory effect of phentolamine on the depressor response. The results indicate that adrenoreceptors are present in the hypothalamus and that they are involved in blood pressure changes elicited by hypothalamic stimulation.", 
    "9": "Twenty-five patients, 16 men and 9 women, 5-59 years of age with the Marfan syndrome and cardiac complications were started on propranolol over a 6-year period. Propranolol was used as a beta-adrenergic blocking agent to reduce myocardial contractility in an attempt thereby to stay the progression of aortic dilatation and to prevent acute dissection of the aorta. The indications for prophylactic treatment were aortic dilatation, with aortic regurgitation in most cases. It was intended to keep the pulse rate below 70 at all times or below 60 at rest. Propranolol given in daily doses of 120-160 mg caused no side effects. The mean observation time for propranolol treatment in the 25 patients was 3.0 +/- 1.8 years ranging from 1-7 years. In spite of treatment, 5 patients (1 female and 4 males) experienced acute aortic dissection of rupture with fatal outcome. This occurred in 2 patients with the asthenic type, in 2 patients with the nonasthenic type, and in 1 patient with the marfanoid hypermobility syndrome. Serial echocardiograms showed that other patients on propranolol developed increasing dilatation of the aortic root. These observations indicate that propranolol does not necessarily protect against aortic dissection nor stop the progression of the aortic dilatation when cystic medial necrosis of the aorta is already present.", 
    "10": "The synthesis and resolution of a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, 1-(7-ethylbenzofuran-2-yl)-2-tert.-butylamino-1-hydroxyethane (bufuralol) are described. Structure-activity studies leading to selection of the title compound are discussed.", 
    "11": "The new beta-blockers 4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropyl-amino-propoxy)-carbazole (carazolol) and 1-(4-acetoxy-2,3,5-trimethylphenyloxy)-3-isopropylamino-propan-2-ol (methypranol, Disorat) were compared with 14 well-known beta-blocking agents with regard to isoproterenol antagonism (equipotent doses in the rabbit i.v.), acute toxicity (LD50 in mice i.v.) and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (increase in the heart rate of reserpinized rats i.p.). The following descending order for the equipotent beta-receptor blocking doses was obtained: nifenalol, DCI, pronethalol, practolol, sotalol, alprenolol, bupranolol, toliprolol, propranolol, methypranol, YB 2 pindolol, bunitrolol, oxprenolol, bunolol and carazolol. Carazolol had, in addition, the highest therapeutic index and at beta-receptor blocking doses virtually no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.", 
    "12": "Nineteen men, aged 41-64 years, with stable angina pectoris have completed a random double-blind study of atenolol, 50 mg b.i.d., atenolol, 100 mg b.i.d., and placebo. Fifteen patients had subjective improvement on atenolol, two were unchanged and two felt worse (because of asthenia/leg fatigue). No significant placebo effect was found. On both atenolol dosages there were highly significant reductions in heart rate at rest and during exercise and in BP. Only the maximal heart rate decreased significantly more on 100 mg atenolol than on 50 mg (p less than 0.01). Fourteen patients had the same or a better physical performance on the 50 mg b.i.d. regimen than on the 100 mg b.i.d. regimen, although this difference was not significant. Sixteen patients had higher bicycle exercise performance on atenolol than on placebo. Disregarding the three non-responders, a mean increase of 44% in bicycle performance was found. No serious side-effects were seen. Most individuals reported an increased feeling of well-being on atenolol.", 
    "13": "The rational use of cardiac glycosides and anti-anginal drugs is deduced on the basis of the pathophysiological interdependence between cardiac and coronary insufficiency. With respect to therapeutic influence on myocardial function and oxygen balance the following rules ought to be regarded: 1. The use of cardiac glycosides should be restricted to patients with cardiac insufficiency in which these drugs are able to reduce the myocardial oxygen consumption due to the hemodynamic consquences of the positive-inotropic action. 2. Organic nitrates and/or beta-receptor blocking agents are compatible with simultaneous cardiac glycoside therapy, but both must be applied according to the individual requirement. 3. Coronary dilators are of questionable value in the therapy of coronary insufficiency, an additional advantage of a combination with cardiac glycosides still has to be proven. 4. There is no rational basis for the use of fixed combinations of these drugs, they do not allow effective and/or safe therapy.", 
    "14": "Determination of both catecholamine concentrations (norepinephrine and epinephrine) and the activity of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase in the plasma of health volunteers and hypertensive patients leads to the conclusion that these parameters used together can be considered an index for sympathetic neuronal activity. However, highly specific and sensitive radiometric methods are necessary for the measurement of these biochemical parameters. In healthy volunteers and hypertensive patients after acute and chronic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, e.g., propranolol, practolol or penbutolol, a significantly higher increase of catecholamine concentrations in the plasma has been observed during physical exercise. This pronounced increase in plasma catecholamine concentrations (mainly norepinephrine) is probably due to an enhanced compensatory sympathetic neuronal activity, accompanied by an increased peripheral resistance; this is obviously necessary in order to maintain a sufficient perfusion of peripheral tissues during work load under the influence of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, since an adequate cardiac output is prohibited by blockade of adrenergic beta-receptors. On the other hand, the pronounced increase in sympathetic tone after beta-blockade, especially after administration of high doses, could be responsible for certain reported side effects, such as hypertensive crisis in psychiatric patients or in patients with phaeochromocytoma.", 
    "15": "The pathophysiology of the coronary insufficiency, the effect of beta-receptor antagonists, the understanding of these effects on the basis of the pathophysiology and the possibilities of testing beta-receptor antagonists in patients with coronary insufficiency are discussed. It is pointed out that the pathophysiology of the coronary insufficiency is based on the difference between oxygen demand of and oxygen supply to the myocardium. beta-Receptor antagonists compensate for this difference. Testing beta-receptor antagonists should include tolerance to exercise and controlled studies using standard medication for comparison.", 
    "16": "Etiologic circumtances of low cardiac outputs are studied according as they concern a diminution of the precharge (hypovolemy of different reasons), an augmentation of the postcharge (by augmentation of aortic impedance or resistance to blood flow) or a cardiac deficiency. The latter can be of non-ischemic origin (effects of beta-blocking drugs, cardiac arrhytmias tamponade, deficience of myocardiac fiber, metabolic disease) or ischemic:--during E.C.C.: diminution of available oxygen (hypothermial), arterial pressure and output too low, clamping time or ventricular fibrillation too long;--after E.C.C.: insufficient surgical correction, coronary embolism lack of balance between apport and expense of oxygen. Therapeutics ways are discussed regarding the different etiologies. The central rule is that it is better to relieve an ischemic myocardia than lash it. But treatment of low cardiac outputs is most often an average solution which must be choose in regard to a well understood physiopathology.", 
    "17": "Experiments staged on rats demonstrated that the formation of pathological states caused by stress and accompained by the development of ulcerative lesion of the gastric mucosa are associated with the degree of the catecholamines level drop in the mesencephalon and hypothalamus. The application of seduxen and also of combinations consisting of L-DOPA with seduxen, or with an L-adrenoblocking agent-pyroxan tends to reduce the frequency of developing ulcerative lesions of the stomach. The protective effect produced by the combination of L-DOPA with an L-adrenoblocking agent--pyroxan is barred by an additional administration of an beta-adrenoblocking agent--inderal.", 
    "18": "Cyclic AMP levels were measured in cardiac and vascular tissues removed from pentobarbitone-anesthetized rats pretreated with theophylline 45 mg/kg i.p. Noradrenaline, 20 microng/kg i.v., increased cardiac but not vascular cyclic AMP levels; this selective effect of noradrenaline was not altered by pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine, 1 mg/kg i.v. Tazolol, 120 microng/kg i.v., selectively increased cardiac cyclic AMP levels whereas fenoterol, 15 microng/kg i.v., selectively increased vascular cyclic AMP levels. The results suggest that adenylate cyclase activation in cardiac and vascular tissued in vivo is mediated by beta adrenoceptors which consist of different subtypes.", 
    "19": "The effects of pindolol, 10 mg/kg, alprenolol, 50 mg/kg, and practolol, 50 mg/kg, given by mouth, on blood pressure and heart rate were investigated over a 24-hr period in 5 conscious renal hypertensive dogs, using a cross-over design. Pindolol and alprenolol caused significant falls in blood pressure which averaged 22 mm Hg (at 3-hr after p.o. administration) and 20 mm Hg (at 3-hr). However, practolol failed to produce any significant changes in blood pressure. Heart rate increased by 67 beats/min (at 1-hr) and 39 beats/min (at 3-hr) after pindolol and alprenolol, respectively, but did not show any significant increase when practolol was given orally. The pindolol-induced tachycardia and hypotension were not suppressed significantly by propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) which blocked completely the tachycardia and hypotension induced by isoprenaline (3 mg/kg p.o.). The hypotension and tachycardia observed after oral administration of D-32 (50 mg/kg) or after intravenous infusion of p-OH D-32 (1 mg/kg per min for 5 min) were also not modified significantly by propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.). Based on these results and other published data, mechanisms pertaining to the hypotension exerted by beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents were discussed.", 
    "20": "The evolution is presented, of a partial infarction of the small bowel, of venous origin, without apparent cause. In the 10-th day after onset, following a segmentary resection of the jejunum and termino-terminal anastomosis, the patient had another segmentar infarction of the ileon, also of venous origin, that was cured after resection. After recovery the hematological investigations evidenced a coagulation disturbance that necessitated longterm heparin therapy, a treatment that is continued 3 years after surgery. Although the repeated infarction of the small bowel of venous origin is theoretically possible the case presented appears to be unique by its evolution and the result of the medico-surgical treatment.", 
    "21": "Changes in blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and hemodynamic components were studied in 23 patients with essential hypertension treated with oral pindolol or propranolol. These beta-adrenergic blocking agents effectively lowered the blood pressure in the majority of the patients. Although plasma renin activity was not significantly changed, the higher was the pretreatment level, the more it tended to be decreased. Systemic vascular resistence was significantly decreased, while changes in cardiac index and circulating blood volume were variable. Pindolol showed less effect in reducing the heart rate than propranolol. The antihypertensive effect of these drugs had no correlation with the change in plasma renin activity or in any one of hemodynamic components.", 
    "22": "Only recently approved for use in the treatment of hypertension in the US, the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking compound propranolol has been used elsewhere for this purpose since 1964. The exact mechanisms to explain why and how \"beta-blocking drugs\" reduce arterial pressure are not known with certainty, but possible explanations include: (1) \"resetting\" of the baroreceptors, (2) reduction of cardiac output, (3) adaptation of circulation (\"autoregulation\"), (4) inhibition of renin release, (5) central nervous system effects, (6) possible antihypertensive metabolites, and (7) other unknown mechanisms or a combination of known mechanisms. Propranolol alone has been demonstrated to be extremely effective in reducing arterial pressure. In addition, the combination of propranolol and vasodilator and diuretic drugs would be expected to reduce vascular resistance without reflexive cardiac stimulation and with prevention of sodium and fluid retention.", 
    "23": "1 Purified membranes retaining a catecholamine responsive adenylate cyclase have prepared from rabbit heart, lung and (pseudo-pregnant) uterus. 2 These preparations have the characteristics of plasma membranes and both heart and lung respond to beta-adrenoceptor agonists in the order: (+/-)-isoprenaline greater than (-)-noradrenaline greater than (-)-adrenaline greater than (+)-isoprenaline greater than salbutamol. The sensitivity of the adenylate cyclase to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation is improved by pre-treatment of the animals with reserpine and syrosingopine. 3 Dose-ratios for several concentrations of propranolol (non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker), practolol and atenolol (cardio-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockers) have been measured on all three membrane preparations. Schild plots of log (dose ratio -1) vs. log dose were virtually coincident for heart and lung with a dissociation constant (Kb) for propranolol very close to the pharmacological value. The ratio of Kb values was 0.65 for practolol and 1.23 for atenolol compared with pharmacological cardio-selectivity ratios (measured on isolated atria and tracheal chain) of 67.6 and 110 respectively. The uterus/heart Kb ratio was 51.5 for atenolol. Inhibition of the uterus by practolol gave a Schild plot with slope significantly less than 1, indicating a different mechanism of action from the heart. 4 Kb values obtained by measuring adenylate cyclase stimulation in chopped tissue (including preparations of bronchial tree and alveolar tissue as well as whole lung) resembled the membrane values rather than those found in whole organs. 5 The results show that the pharmacological selectivity of practolol and atenolol is maintained at the receptor-adenylate cyclase level, at least as far as heart and uterus are concerned, though the smaller selectivity ratios in the biochemical system suggest that receptor differences is not the only factor and that phase distribution of the drug may also be important. Membranes prepared from whole lung show that phase distribution of the drug may also be important. Membranes prepared from whole lung show an overall beta1 response which may simply reflect the predominance of beta1 cell types containing beta1-adrenoceptors over bronchial smooth muscle.", 
    "24": "1 The response of the beta-adrenoceptors of human lymphocytes to selective agonists and antagonists has been studied quantitatively by measuring changes in cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels. 2 The receptor was activated by isoprenaline and by salbutamol, and blocked by propranolol but not by practolol. A similar pattern of response was obtained with fragments of human lung tissue. 3 The mean value for pA2 for propranolol was 8.34 and for practolol was 3.95. 4 These findings indicate that the lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor is a beta2-receptor and support the solidity of using lymphocytes to study beta-adrenoceptor function in bronchial asthma. It may also be of use in the evaluation of selective beta2-blocking drugs in man.", 
    "25": "1 Cardiovascular and metabolic responses to intravenous infusion of isoprenaline were measured in fasted, anaesthetized cats. 2 Isoprenaline (0.2 mug kg-1 min-1 for 15 min) decreased diastolic blood pressure and increased heart rate, blood glucose, blood lactate and plasma free fatty acids. 3 Oxprenolol (0.5 mg/kg) antagonized all cardiovascular and metabolic effects of isoprenaline non-selectively. 4 Para-oxprenolol (0.25 mg/kg) and practolol (4 mg/kg) antagonized the effects of isoprenaline on heart rate and free fatty acids selectively. 5 H 35/25 ((I-(4-methylphenyl)-2-isopropyl aminopropanol) hydrochloride, 3 mg/kg) antagonized the effects of isoprenaline on blood pressure, glucose and lactate selectively. 6 It is concluded that metabolic adrenoceptors are differentiated into subtypes similar to those mediating cardiostimulation and vasodilatation.", 
    "26": "Twenty-three closed-chest, alpha-chloralose-anesthetized, volume-expanded, alpha- and beta-adrenergic-blockaded dogs with rate fixed by atrial pacing had 30-90 ml of saline at 37 degrees C infused into the pericardial sac a) with vagus intact, b) after vagotomy, and c) with vagus intact but with systolic pressure augmented with a balloon. A significant reduction in left ventricular (LV) systolic pressure (SP), and cardiac output (CO) occurred at a pericardial volume of 30-60 ml, when LV end-diastolic (ED) and right atrial (RA) pressures were not increased. Whereas the percentage decline of CO, LVSP, maximum negative and maximum positive dP/dt was greater in group A (vagus intact) than in group B (vagus cut), significant residual depressed performance was demonstrated only in group B. In four paced, atropinized, beta-blockaded dogs, response to tamponade was similar to that in intact dogs; vagotomy at 90 ml in these dogs resulted in a fall in CO, a rise of LVSP and a significant elevation in LVED and RA pressures. Thus, in the early phases of cardiac tamponade a sympathetic neurohumoral response supports cardiac performance while the vagus nerve exerts a myocardial protective effect. Vagal afferents appear to modulate this response.", 
    "27": "The corpus-fundus of the urinary bladder of man and cat was studied in vitro with respect to type of beta-adrenergic receptors. In both species beta-adrenergic stimulation produced marked relaxation but species differences were apparent. In the cat bladder only beta1-receptors were found. In the human bladder the beta-receptors had neither beta1- nor beta2-characteristics. It is suggested that the beta-adrenergic receptors in the corpus-fundus of the human bladder are of a third type.", 
    "28": "The acute hypoglycaemic reaction is accompanied by a rise in systolic and a slight fall in diastolic blood pressure and a tachycardia. In contrast, during beta-blockade with propranolol there is a rise of both systolic and diastolic blood pressures and bradycardia. Restoration of blood glucose to normal is delayed. With metoprolol there is a lesser increase in diastolic blood pressure and a slight tachycardia. Restoration of the blood glucose to normal is little delayed. When patients liable to hypoglycaemia require a beta-blocking agent, it is suggested that a selective blocker such as metoprolol should be used.", 
    "29": "Beta-blocking agents with partial agonist activity seem to reduce heart rate at rest slightly less than those without this property. Cardio-selective drugs have no effect on stroke volume at rest contrary to the non-selective ones which will reduce it somewhat. This difference is abolished during exercise. The only difference seen during work between different beta-blockers is the effect on the peripheral vascular resistance. The selective drugs lower the arterial pressure with unchanged resistance.", 
    "30": "The therapeutic effect of beta adrenoceptor blockers in angina pectoris can be ascribed to an inhibition of beta1 receptor mediated stimulation of heart rate and myocardial contractility, resulting in an improved oxygen supply-demand balance in the myocardium. When given in equipotent beta1 blocking doses, the nonselective blocker propranolol and the beta1 selective blocker metoprolol differ markedly as regards inhibition of adrenaline induced beta2 mediated vasodilatation. Only propranolol will inhibit this effect. After propranolol, adrenaline therefore elicits a haemodynamic effect pattern characterized by high peripheral vascular resistance, high arterial blood pressure, low cardiac output and increased cardiac size. In view of these findings it is suggested that a beta1 selective blocker may be a more efficient antianginal agent than a nonselective blocker in those patients in which the anginal attack is associated with a significant release of adrenaline. The clinical relevance of this hypothesis has not been tested.", 
    "31": "There are two kinds of adrenergic receptors in rat fundus (stomach), the alpha receptors are stimulated with adrenaline and noradrenaline and can be blocked effectively with azapetine and the beta receptors are stimulated with isoprenaline and adrenaline and can be blocked effectively with propranolol. Adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline all produce inhibition of acetylcholine induced contractions in both untreated and reserpinized tissues that can be antagonized with azapetine and propranolol on its specific receptors but propranolol has a greater capacity to decrease the sensitivity of both untreated and reserpinized tissues to isoprenaline and adrenaline than azapetine can in case of noradrenaline and adrenaline.", 
    "32": "Treatment of ventricular arrhythmias at the present time is difficult and requires a strong commitment on the part of the physician and the patient. Adequate documentation of the arrhythmia with continuous ECG recordings (Holter recordings), preferably for 24 hours, should be performed in each case. Exercise testing can be utilized in selected patients, but is generally inferior to the Holter technique. Underlying cardiac pathology should be searched for, utilizing echocardiography in all patients and coronary angiography and left ventriculography in patients with more severe ventricular tachycardias. Estimation of the prognostic significance of the VPBs must be made in the context of the underlying disease, and goals for treatment must be set. Treatment in all cases first requires measures to avoid known precipitating factors. If antiarrhythmic therapy is utilized, a systematic empirical trial of available agents should be undertaken, utilizing repeated Holter monitoring to document effectiveness. Serum levels of the antiarrhythmic medications should be measured in most cases. Combinations of antiarrhythmic agents can be employed if the need is great, but the agents singly are ineffective. If treatment is determined to be ineffective, it should be discontinued. Surgical techniques may be useful in cases of refractory ventricular tachycardia, and they include overdrive pacing, surgical sympathectomy, or ventricular aneurysmectomy with or without coronary bypass. Coronary bypass alone or resection of a hypokinetic but not aneurysmal area of myocardium may be successful in some cases, but the results are less predictable than when a true aneurysm is resected. Electrophysiologic studies, performed as part of the preoperative evaluation and provoking a self-perpetuating ventricular tachycardia, may permit selection of patients suitable for ventriculotomy to interrupt the re-entry pathway. At present, this must be considered experimental and is performed in only a few centers equipped for the required complex epicardial mapping. Surgery has not been shown to affect complex VPBs outside the setting of acute ischemia. Control of ventricular arrhythmias requires a highly individualistic approach with documentation of effectiveness.", 
    "33": "Labetalol 1-5 mg/kg administered intravenously to normal subjects in the supine position produced an immediate mean fall in systolic (16%) and diastolic (25%) blood pressure with a concomitant increase in heart rate (12%). After graded exercise, intravenous labetalol inhibited increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Isoprenaline log dose response curves of increase in heart rate and reduction in diastolic pressure after intravenous labetalol shifted to the right in a parallel manner compared with pre-labetalol response curves suggestive of competitive antagonism at beta-adrenoceptor sites. Similarly, phenylephrine dose response curves of increase in systolic pressure before and after intravenous labetalol were suggestive of competitive antagonism at alpha-adrenoceptor sites. The ratio of relative potency alpha: beta adrenoceptor antagonism after intravenous labetalol was approximately 1:7, whereas in the same subjects after oral labetalol the ratio was approximately 1:3 as previously reported. Using the inhibition of isoprenaline tachycardia to estimate the potency of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonism of labetalol relative to that of propranolol the potency ratio was 1:6. However, using inhibition of Valsalva tachycardia as the index, the estimated ratio was approximately 1:3. Estimates of relative potency using inhibition of tilt tachycardia were complicated by the additional effects upon blood pressure after labetalol not seen after propranolol. Labetalol produced adrenoceptor blockade at both alpha and beta sites in man sufficient to explain its therapeutic antihypertensive effect.", 
    "34": "The beta blocking agents are valuable drugs in cardiology. They are effective in any fast arrhythmia. Together with nitroglycerin, beta blockers are drugs of first choice in angina. As antihypertensives, they have advantages that should make them drugs of first choice. For migraine the beta blockers are equal to any other type of drug. With more study their place in treating anxiety will be clarified. And without question other uses will be found. It is difficult for this author to understand the attitude of the FDA to this class of drugs. To limit the American physician to only one drug in this large group of drugs is unheard of. Although it can be argued that propranolol is the best one, there are obvious cases where another drug would be better. For example, propranolol induces nightmares in a few patients. There is evidence to show that timolol does this less frequently. FDA delay in approval of propranolol for essential hypertension is totally incomprehensible. Other approved drugs are less effective and much more toxic. Propranolol, and the other beta blockers, are safe and effective. The adverse beta effects are easily controlled or avoided. The other adverse effects are no more frequent than with any other class of drugs, and all are reversible. It is to be hoped that science and common sense will prevail over bureaucratic indecision.", 
    "35": "The hormonal control of [14C]glucose synthesis from [U-14C-A1dihydroxyacetone was studied in hepatocytes from fed and starved rats. In cells from fed rats, glucagon lowered the concentration of substrate giving half-half-maximal rates of incorporation while it had little or no effect on the maximal rate. Inhibitors of gluconeogenesis from pyruvate had no effect on the ability of the hormone to stimulate the synthesis of [14C]glucose from dihydroxyacetone. The concentrations of glucagon and epinephrine giving half-maximal stimulation from dihydroxacetone were 0.3 to 0.4 mM and 0.3 to 0.5 muM, respectively. The meaximal catecholamine stimulation was much less than the maximal stimulation by glucagon and was mediated largely by the alpha receptor. Insulin had no effect on the basal rate of [14C]clucose synthesis but inhibited the effect of submaximal concentration of glucagon or of any concentration of catecholamine. Glucagon had no effect on the uptake of dihydroxyacetone but suppressed its conversion to lactate and pyruvate. This suppression accounted for most of the increase in glucose synthesis. In cells from gasted rats, where lactate production is greatly reduced and the rate of glucose synthesis is elevated, glucagon did not stimulate gluconeogenesis from dihydroxyacetone. Findings with glycerol as substrate were similar to those with dihyroxyacetone. Ethanol also stimulated glucose production from dihydroxyacetone while reducing proportionately the production of lactate. Ethanol is known to generate reducing equivalents fro clyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and presumably thereby inhibits carbon flux to lactate at this site. Its effect was additive with that of glucagon. Estimates of the steady state levels of intermediary metabolites and flux rates suggested that glucagon activated conversion of fructose diphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate and suppressed conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. More direct evidence for an inhibition of pyruvate kinase was the observation that brief exposure of cells to glucagon caused up to 70% inhibition of the enzyme activity in homogenates of these cells. The inhibition was not seen when the enzyme was assayed with 20 muM fructose diphosphate. The effect of glucagon to lower fructose diphosphate levels in intact cells may promote the inhibition of pyruvate kinase. The inhibition of pyruvate kinase may reduce recycling in the pathway of gluconeogenesis from major physiological substrates and probably accounts fromsome but not all the stimulatory effect of glucagon.", 
    "36": "The effect of post-ethanol ingestion of a single dose of propranolol on acute intoxication was studied in 13 healthy male volunteers. A within subjects, double-blind, crossover design was employed. Each subject participated in two experimental sessions. In each session, subjects took a battery of tests under three conditions: Sober, Alcohol (0.8 g/kg) and Alcohol (1.1 g/kg) + Pill, in that order. The pill contained propranolol (40 mg) in one session and placebo in the other. Ethanol significantly reduced motor coordination, memory and divided attention performance and altered mood scores. Propranolol significantly increased ethanol's effects on divided attention, inebriation ratings and the electroencephalogram without significantly altering blood alcohol concentrations. There was no indication that propranolol antagonized any of ethanol's effects. These results agree with studies indicating that ethanol's effects are increased by a reduction in the functional capacity of central catecholamine systems. It is suggested that central catecholamine-stimulating drugs may reverse some of ethanol's effects.", 
    "37": "The morphine blocking and anticonvulsant effects of propranolol were investigated in mice. Three different convulsant procedures (electroshock, pentylenetetrazol and thebaine) were used. In addition, LD50's of morphine after different doses of propranolol were done. Sotalol was used as a control drug to check which of the effects of propranolol could be regarded as due to beta blockade. Morphine LD50 in mice is not altered by pre-treatment with propranolol. The anticonvulsant characteristics of propranolol are different from those of sotalol, the former acting mainly on the tonic phase of the seizures. This study does not support the hypothesis that propranolol is a morphine antagonist but reinforces the idea that propranolol has definite central nervous system effects.", 
    "38": "Six symptomless patients aged 64-84 (mean 72) years received antihypertensive therapy from their family doctors. Pretreatment systolic pressures ranged from 160 to 220 mm Hg and disastolic pressures from 80 to 120 mm Hg. Within one week of starting therapy all six patients were admitted as emergencies with epidoses of unconsciousness. Admission systolic pressures ranged from 80 to 150 mm Hg and diastolic pressures from 50 to 90 mm Hg. Before admission each patient had experiences symptoms of postural hypotension and had become housebound. After antihypertensive therapy was stopped, one patient had a residual left homonymous hemianopia but the others recovered completely. A raised systolic and distolic pressure is common in the elderly; potent antihypertensive treatment may seriously impair the quality of life and is often unecessary.", 
    "39": "Stereospecific binding sites for (-) [3H]-alprenolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, have been identified in guinea-pig myocardial broken cell preparations. The concentration of the sites was 0.3 pmoles per mg of protein and the dissociation constant (at 37 degrees C) 10(-8) M. A close correlation between the ability of various beta-adrenergic antagonists to compete with tracer alprenolol binding and to block the response of isoprenaline-stimulated myocardial adenylate cyclase has been found. Low affinity sites for the labelled beta-adrenergic antagonist in contrast to stereospecific sites are heat stable and do not discriminate between the (-) and the (+) forms of the beta-adrenergic antagonists. Adenylate cyclase in guinea-pig myocardial tissue is poorly stimulated by isoprenaline or 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate. This is attributed to a high basal activity which could be lowered by a preincubation at 37 degrees C.", 
    "40": "It was shown that adrenergic drugs, which increase the intracellular levels of cAMP, inhibit the rosette formation by T-lymphocytes, but stimulate the rosettes produced by B-lymphocytes. Cholinergic drugs, which increase the levels of cGMP, on the contrary, stimulate the formation of rosettes by T-lymphocytes but inhibit those produced by B-lymphocytes.", 
    "41": "The stimulatory effects of isoproterenol and secretin on external pancreatic secretion were compared in the rat. 1. In acute fistula, pylorus ligation, atropine, glucagon did not change either of the stimulated secretions. Propranolol inhibited isoproterenol-induced secretion and did not change secretin induced stimulation. Theophylline alone displayed a large hydrelatic stimulatory effect, without increasing protein excretion; the effect of theophylline was additive with the effects of isoproterenol or secretin but no evidence was found of potentiation or prolongation of action. Isoproterenol did not increase pancreatic blood flow and induced no variations in the plasma levels of immunoreactive secretin. Combining various doses of isoproterenol and secretin did not allow to reach secretory levels greater than the maximal response to secretin. 2. In conscious rats chronic fistulae, isoproterenol and secretin had a distinct effect.", 
    "42": "Propranolol was infused intravenously for 60 minutes to five ewes (4 mug per kilogram per minute) or five fetal sheep (10 mug per kilogram per minute). The umbilical blood flow was significantly decreased by 18 per cent from control at 60 minutes with either maternal or fetal propranolol infusion. Uterine blood flow and maternal and fetal mean arterial pressure did not significantly change. Maternal and fetal heart rates decreased 18 and 9 per cent from control, respectively, during maternal propranolol infusion. With propranolol to the fetus, fetal heart rate decreased 15 per cent and maternal heart rate did not change. During all infusion, maternal and fetal arterial pH, PCO2 and PO2 remained within normal physiologic limits.", 
    "43": "Ritodrine hydrochloride was administered parenterally to pregnant ewes during spontaneous or oxytocin-induced uterine activity. The effects of ritodrine on the uterus and cardiovasculature were assessed both with and without simultaneous administration of either alpha or beta blockade. Ritodrine was found to be an effective inhibitor of both spontaneous and induced uterine activity. Ritodrine did cause maternal tachycardia but no significant hypotension. Alpha-adrenergic blockade did not influence the effects of ritodrine. Beta blockade with propranolol reversed the uterine and cardiovascular effects of ritodrine, whereas beta blockade with practolol reversed the cardiovascular effects without interfering with the inhibition of uterine activity produced by ritodrine."
