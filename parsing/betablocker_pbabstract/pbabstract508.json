    "0": "Therapeutics involves the careful balance between treatment disadvantages and advantages--the so-called risk-benefit ratio. Even after 20 years beta-blockers must be selected carefully to suit the patient's needs. This review examines several problems associated with beta-blockade. Generally, beta1-cardioselectivity is considered advantageous, but properties such as partial agonist activity, which limits receptor up-regulation, might be of greater value in reducing the adverse effects associated with abrupt drug withdrawal. Beta-Blockers, either lipophilic or hydrophilic agents, have specific problems: lipophilic drugs provoke adverse central nervous system effects and need careful dose titration; variable gastrointestinal absorption is common with hydrophilic agents, whereas extra care is needed in patients with renal impairment. For most patients, especially those with asymptomatic conditions, once-daily dosing is preferred. For many, the quality of life is of overriding clinical importance. Despite significant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic advances, the final criteria depend largely on a clinical assessment, improvement in the quality of life, and patient preference. We still await the discovery of an ideal beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent; some of the newer beta-blockers, however have many of the properties that clinicians value.", 
    "1": "beta-Blocking therapy is used extensively is conditions as diverse as hypertension, angina pectoris, arrhythmias, thyrotoxicosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, migraine, glaucoma, and myocardial infarction. Studies show they beneficially influence sinus node and atrioventricular conduction, but excessively high doses may cause sinus arrest or sinoatrial block. Nonselective beta-blockade in asthmatic patients may aggravate bronchoconstriction, whereas increased airways resistance is less likely with beta 1-selective, partial agonist, or alpha-beta-blocking drugs. Hypoglycemia can be prolonged; beta 1-selective or partial agonist drugs may cause less interference with glucose metabolism. beta-Blockade affects free fatty acids, lipids and lipoproteins, thyroid hormones, and parathormone. beta-Blockade may normalize abnormal platelet aggregation. Finally, the choice of the most effective drug depends on the clinician's knowledge of the various pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic drug profiles, allied with familiarity of the patient's medical condition.", 
    "2": "This survey covers the classification and subdivisions of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, including alpha 1 and alpha 2, beta 1 and beta 2, and pre-and postsynaptic receptor subtypes, together with the distribution and functional relevance of the various adrenoceptor subtypes. The emphasis will be on their relevance in circulatory regulatory processes, especially those of the blood vessels. The alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists that interact with various receptor subtypes are briefly discussed. The control of alpha 2-adrenoceptors concerned with blood pressure regulation is an important target for centrally acting antihypertensive drugs (such as clonidine or alpha-methyldopa). Changes in adrenoceptor density, particularly the down-regulation of beta 1- adrenoceptors (but not beta 2), are found in congestive heart failure. However, the experimental findings about alpha-and beta-adrenoceptors in essential hypertension remain controversial. Finally, the influence of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on plasma lipids and carbohydrate metabolism is briefly reviewed. The changes found may be only partly explained on the basis of alpha- or beta-receptor blockade.", 
    "3": "A series of erythro- and threo-2-(aryloxy)-1-(2-piperidyl)ethanol derivatives (3) was synthesized from 2-(2-oxiranyl)pyridine for evaluation as beta-antagonists. Most compounds displayed high competitive beta-blocking potency, but they lacked significant beta 1/beta 2 selectivity. The 1-naphthoxy derivative erythro-3b was 17 (beta 1) and 33 (beta 2) times more potent than its open-chain analogue, propranolol. Within the whole series, erythro-3 diastereomers were more potent beta-blockers than the threo-3 isomers, and the potency of the latter seems to be rather insensitive to structural modification. The effect of N-methylation and of interposition of an alkyl chain between the aromatic ring and the side chain, while being detrimental to beta-blocking activity, was less marked than in the classic (aryloxy)propanolamine blockers.", 
    "4": "The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) of 32 beta-adrenoceptor ligands, mainly antagonists, was calculated by the STO-3G ab initio quantum mechanical method. The MEP of phenylethanolamines (PEAs) features a negative minimum in the meta region (designated M1) which is topographically equivalent to a minimum (designated M2) found in the vicinity of the aromatic ring in all (aryloxy)propanolamines (AOPAs). In these compounds, a second negative zone located beyond the meta position and designated M3 is found in all beta 1-selective antagonists and in some nonselective and beta 2-selective antagonists. The beta 1-selective antagonists feature in the para position an additional zone which is positive (P4) in the full antagonists and negative (M4) in the antagonists displaying intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). The MEP-based pharmacophoric models of PEAs, AOPAs, and oxime ethers show common elements and lead to a proposed general model for beta-adrenoceptor ligands.", 
    "5": "Experiments were designed to study the effect of the beta adrenergic antagonist, carteolol, on the endothelium-dependent responsiveness of isolated arteries. Rings of canine coronary arteries were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording; carteolol inhibited the relaxation to isoproterenol and abolished the difference in responsiveness to the beta adrenergic agonist between rings with and without endothelium. Carteolol did not cause endothelium-dependent relaxations of femoral or coronary arteries. In bioassay experiments, carteolol augmented the basal release of relaxing factors from the endothelium of the femoral artery; this effect was prevented by indomethacin. In rings of femoral arteries, carteolol increased the endothelium-dependent relaxations induced by the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist UK 14,304; this was not affected by indomethacin but prevented by propranolol. Carteolol did not modify the endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine, adenosine diphosphate, bradykinin, thrombin and the Ca+-ionophore A23187. Carteolol inhibited the endothelium-dependent hypoxic contraction of the canine coronary artery. It did not affect endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine in the aorta of the spontaneously hypertensive rat. These experiments suggest that carteolol facilitates the abluminal release of endothelium-dependent relaxing factor caused by alpha-2 adrenergic activation, and causes the intraluminal release of vasodilator prostaglandins. The compound prevents the endothelium-dependent contractions which are not mediated by products of cyclooxygenase. These actions may contribute to the vasodilatator properties of carteolol in the intact organism.", 
    "6": "Age-related differences in the binding properties of beta-adrenergic receptors on lymphocyte membranes isolated from healthy individuals have been reported. The purpose of the present studies was to determine whether or not beta receptors on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) membranes showed similar age-related changes. Plasma Percoll gradients were used to isolate PMN and mononuclear leukocyte (MN) cells from blood drawn in the supine position from young (25-34 years) and elderly (60-76 years) healthy volunteers. Both blood pressures and plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly elevated in the elderly subjects. Saturation analysis with [125I]-(-) iodopindolol (IPIN) showed a 2.5-fold higher density of beta 2 receptors on the MN, but not PMN, membranes from the elderly. Neither the affinities of the receptor for IPIN or the agonist isoproterenol, nor the GTP-induced shift in agonist affinity, differed with subject age in either cell type. These results suggest that subpopulations of MN cells on which beta-adrenergic receptors are localized may increase in the elderly and that it is important to measure receptor properties on a more homogeneous leukocyte population such as PMN cells or subpopulations of MN cells as a function of aging.", 
    "7": "Astrocytes from cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord responded to isoproterenol and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) with increases in intracellular cyclic AMP levels. The response to VIP was as great as that to isoproterenol in cortical astrocytes (180-fold and 185-fold, respectively), and the effect of VIP in combination with isoproterenol was partially additive. Spinal cord astrocytes also responded to VIP and isoproterenol with equal potency (seven- to ninefold and eight- to 13-fold, respectively), but the level of response was much smaller than in cortex. Spinal cord astrocytes were synergistic in their response to VIP and isoproterenol. The response to VIP was lowest in cerebellar astrocytes (only threefold), and no additivity was observed when VIP was added together with isoproterenol. A small response to alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) was also observed in cortex and cerebellum, but not in spinal cord. Somatostatin inhibited the response to isoproterenol in cortex and cerebellum, but had no effect in spinal cord. The results from the above study show that astrocytes obtained from these three regions of the rat CNS express quite different responses to VIP and alpha-MSH and further point to possible astrocyte heterogeneity.", 
    "8": "The effect of chronic propranolol administration (2 mg.kg-1.d-1 for 14d) and withdrawal on microvascular perfusion was studied in rabbit myocardium. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran was injected into four groups of anaesthetised open chest rabbits. Fluorescent microscopy was used to identify the perfused vessels and alkaline phosphatase stain was employed to locate the total microvasculature. Beta adrenoceptor density (Bmax), measured using 125I-iodopindolol, increased from 20.3(SD 6.3) fmol.mg-1 protein in control to 52.4(8.9) in chronically treated rabbits. The proportion of the capillary bed which was perfused, 61.4(4.3)% was significantly decreased by acute injection of propranolol to 51.1(5.1)%, but not affected by chronic administration, remaining at 57.0(4.0)%. The percentage of the capillary bed perfused increased significantly after cessation of chronic propranolol treatment to 69.1(6.5)%. Similar results were seen for myocardial arterioles. Thus, while diffusion distances are increased by acute adrenoceptor blockade, this effect is not seen in the chronic condition. Diffusion distance decreased significantly after withdrawal of chronic propranolol treatment. We conclude that the percentage of perfused capillaries is strongly influenced by the number of beta adrenoceptors or their effect.", 
    "9": "The actions of blockers of dopaminergic receptors (haloperidol), alpha-receptors (phenoxybenzamine), beta-receptors (propranolol) and muscarinic cholinergic receptor (atropine) on the ACTH-induced delay of the extinction of active avoidance behavior were studied in rats. In the doses used, none of the receptor blockers modified the extinction of active avoidance behavior. ACTH delayed the extinction. However, the dopamine receptor blocker (haloperidol) and the muscarinic cholinergic receptor blocker (atropine) did prevent the action of ACTH in delaying the extinction of active avoidance behavior, whereas the alpha-(phenoxybenzamine) and beta- (propranolol) receptor blockers were ineffective. The results suggest that mainly dopaminergic and cholinergic mediations are involved in the delaying action of ACTH on the extinction of active avoidance behavior.", 
    "10": "In the erythrocytes incubated at low temperature (3-6 degrees C), the uptake of Li+ in 6- and 16-week old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was significantly higher than in the normotensive rats (WKY) of the same age. During the incubation of cells at 37 degrees C no difference occurred in either ouabain-sensitive or ouabain-resistant fluxes of Rb+, Na+ and Li+ between the 16-week old SHR and the WKY. K+ efflux from the erythrocytes at 3 degrees C was consistently stimulated after addition to the incubation medium of 1 mmol/l Ca2+. The value of Ca2+-dependent K+-transport was significantly elevated in 16-week old SHR than in the WKY, but there was no difference in 6-week old rats. Propranolol-induced Ca2+-dependent K+ efflux from the cells at 22 degrees C was markedly higher in 6- and 16-week old SHR as compared with the WKY. The results provide a further evidence in favor of the hypothesis on the existence of a \"membrane defect\" in red blood cells in the SHR.", 
    "11": "The effect of the disulfide reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) and other thiols on binding of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)-125iodocyanopindolol (125ICYP) to human mononuclear leucocytes (MNL) was investigated. Saturation experiments and dissociation kinetics revealed two classes of specific 125ICYP binding sites, one of high and the other of low affinity, respectively. In intact MNL DTT caused a decrease in specific binding. This was due almost selectively to a decrease in the affinity of high affinity binding sites, which decreased gradually in a concentration-dependent manner to the affinity of low affinity binding sites. In MNL membranes DTT decreased not only the affinity but also the number of high affinity binding sites. The DTT effect was completely reversible by simple reoxidation on air. The structural isomers (+/-)-DTT. (-)-DTT and dithioerythritol revealed identical effects on specific binding, whereas the monothiols mercaptoethanol and alpha-monothioglycerol, having a lower redox potential, were considerably less effective. In the same concentration range that influenced specific binding. DTT stimulated intracellular cAMP production. These results suggest functionally important disulfide bridges which regulate the affinity of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites in human MNL. They stabilize the receptor in a high affinity state; their reduction causes the conversion of the high affinity state into a low affinity state in a process associated with stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Available evidence indicates that a similar transformation is made by beta-adrenoceptor agonists. Consequently low affinity 125ICYP binding sites preexistent in untreated cells could represent a reduced receptor state resulting from agonist-receptor interaction in vivo.", 
    "12": "Atenolol (A) and enalapril (E), two agents widely used as first-line monotherapy in arterial hypertension, have never been compared in their potency and duration of action by using 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Twelve out-patients (mean age 48.6 years - SD 7) with mild-to-moderate hypertension and supine diastolic blood pressure (Hawksley Random Zero Manometer) greater than 100 mmHg at the end of a 3-week placebo wash-out received, in double-blind and random order, A 100 mg daily, E 20 mg daily and placebo for 4 weeks each, according to a 3 x 3 latin square design. A 24-hour non-invasive ABPM (Spacelabs ICR 5200) was performed at the end of each of the 3 periods. In respect to placebo, both A and E produced a 24-h antihypertensive effect. The frequency of diastolic blood pressure values above 90 mmHg was 50.0% after placebo, 24.5% after A and 28.9% after E (a 51% reduction after A and a 42.3% reduction after E in respect to placebo - both p less than .05). Systolic blood pressure profiles differed less than 5 mmHg between placebo and A, as well as between placebo and E, between 9:30 and 10:30. Diastolic blood pressure profiles differed less than 5 mmHg between placebo and A over 2 h (between 2:30 and 3:30, and between 10:30 and 11:30), and between placebo and E over 2 other h (between 9:30 and 10:30, and between 11:30 and 12:30). None of the routine hematochemical parameters differed between placebo, A and E.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "3H-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) -- receptor binding was studied in membrane preparations from metestrous uterine tissue, both in presence and absence of exogenous prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha at 10(-9) M. In addition, the uptake of 3H-noradrenaline (NA) by uterine segments from estrous and metestrous rats and the influences of PGF2 alpha (10(-9) M), cocaine (10(-5) M) corticosterone (5.10(-5) M), normetanephrine (10(-6) M) or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA: 10(-4) M), were explored. The Scatchard analysis of experimental data with 3H-DHA with or without added PGF2 alpha indicates the existence of a single class of high affinity receptors and no differences were found, in presence of PGF2 alpha, regarding the control dissociation constant or the control maximal sites of specific binding. On the other hand, the uptake of 3H-NA by uterine segments at metestrus was significantly greater than at estrus. In metestrous uteri PGF2 alpha (10(-9) M) reduced significantly NA uptake. ASA enhanced NA uptake by uteri from estrous rats, an influence prevented by PGF2 mu. In uterine segments isolated at estrus, cocaine, corticosterone and normetanephrine failed to alter 3H-NA uptake, whereas in preparations isolated at metestrus, corticosterone and normetanephrine reduced the uptake, but cocaine did not evoke any influence. Results are discussed in terms of previous findings documenting an amplification of the negative inotropic influence of NA mediated by the activation of beta-adrenoceptors, both in estrous or in metestrous preparations incubated with PGF2 alpha. Such previous findings cannot be explained by changes in the number of NA receptors or by a greater affinity of tissue receptors for the agonist, but rather by differences in NA uptake controlling its effective concentration at the biophase, near receptor sites. Interrelationships along sex hormones (estradiol), prostaglandins (PGF2 alpha) and catecholamines (NA) in uteri, are also discussed.", 
    "14": "Single smooth muscle cells were prepared from guinea-pig taenia caecum. To study the beta-adrenoceptors in the single cells, we observed mechanical responses of the single cells to beta-adrenergic drugs and also tested the binding of a [3H]-labelled drug to the single cells. The single cells showed a graded relaxing response to isoprenaline. The concentration-response curve was shifted in a parallel fashion by propranolol, indicating a competitive antagonism. The pA2 value of propranolol was in agreement with that estimated using the intact tissue. The dissociation constant of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol was similar to the value estimated in the microsomal fractions. The apparent dissociation constants of isoprenaline and propranolol estimated from inhibition of the specific binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol to the single cells were also in agreement with the values in the microsomal fractions. The results suggest that there is no change in the beta-adrenoceptor mechanism in single smooth muscle cells by isolating the cells.", 
    "15": "This study compared the effects of beta-blockers differing in degree of central nervous system penetration on Type A behavior and cardiovascular reactivity to mental stress. Forty-six male hypertensives were assigned randomly to receive either highly lipophilic and nonselective propranolol, hydrophilic and cardioselective atenolol, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, or placebo. Subjects were administered parallel forms of the Structured Interview (SI) and performed mental arithmetic and a cognitive task prior to and after 6 weeks of therapy. Results indicated that diuretic and placebo subjects (subsequently combined into a single control group) did not differ and that both beta-blockers reduced heart rate but not blood pressure reactivity to mental stress (p less than 0.02), an effect that was strongest during the mental arithmetic test. Analysis of SI components indicated a reduction only in explosive speech for beta-blockers versus controls (p less than 0.05). For global SI classifications, seven out of 12 subjects (58%) receiving propranolol, three of 12 (25%) receiving atenolol, and four of 22 control subjects (18%) became less Type A (p less than 0.05). These data do not replicate results of a prior study obtained with atenolol and suggest that only a subset of hypertensive individuals show reduced Type A behavior with propranolol. Central nervous system mechanisms may be important in producing these effects.", 
    "16": "The efficiency of covalently linking alprenolol to Sepharose via a 14-atom spacer prepared from 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether has been increased. This in turn has aided in increasing the specific yield of beta-2-adrenergic receptor by a factor of 3 over earlier results. Further development of extraction and solubilization protocols are also described. The adsorption of the affinity-purified receptor to stainless steel was measured, and is cited as a potential problem in further purification by high-pressure liquid chromatography.", 
    "17": "Twenty-one dogs underwent instrumentation of the left ventricle with ultrasonic dimension to study the effects of acute protein-calorie malnutrition on the adrenergic responsiveness of the heart. This study allowed a chronic and dynamic measurement of the major cardiac axes and the ventricular wall thickness, which in turn can be used to derive sophisticated measurements of global and intrinsic left ventricular function. Of the 21 dogs, 11 received a protein- and calorie-deficient diet designed to achieve a mean weight loss from a baseline of 20-25% over a 4-week period. The other 10 dogs received a normal diet. Dogs were also randomized to receive either acute propranolol beta-receptor blockade (n = 9) or acute isoproterenol beta-receptor stimulation (n = 12) during their baseline studies. Of the nine dogs given propranolol, five were subsequently malnourished and four served as controls. Of the 12 given isoproterenol, six were rendered malnourished and six were controls. All dogs were studied at both baseline and 4 weeks and received drugs in an identical fashion during both studies. The significant changes with malnutrition consisted of decreases in heart rate, cardiac mass, and left ventricular wall thickness. The degree of change in stroke volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output, dp/dt, and Emax (index of left ventricular contractility), with the administration of propranolol or isoproterenol was unaltered by malnutrition. These data support the contention that moderate protein-calorie malnutrition is well tolerated in instrumented, unstessed dogs and that the left ventricle's capacity to respond to beta-stimulation and to tolerate beta-blockade is largely unimpaired.", 
    "18": "Whole-body hypoxia may increase peripheral O2 demand because it increases catecholamine calorigenesis, an effect attributable to beta 2-adrenoceptors. We tested these possibilities by pump-perfusing innervated hindlimbs in eight dogs with autologous blood kept normoxic by a membrane oxygenator while ventilating the animals for 40 min with 9% O2 in N2 (NOB group). Similar periods of normoxic ventilation preceded and followed the hypoxic period. A second group (n = 8, beta B) was pretreated with the specific beta 2 blocker ICI 118,551. Hindlimb O2 uptake was elevated by 25 min of hypoxia in NOB, whereas whole-body O2 uptake was reduced. Limb O2 uptake remained elevated in recovery, but all effects on limb O2 uptake were absent in beta B. Hindlimb resistance and perfusion pressure increased in hypoxia in both groups, and there was little evidence of local escape from reflex vasoconstriction. These results clearly indicated that global hypoxia increased O2 demand in muscle when the local O2 supply was not limited and that beta 2-receptors were necessary for this response. Autoregulatory escape of limb muscle blood flow from centrally mediated vasoconstriction during whole-body hypoxia was also shown to be practically nil, if normoxia was maintained in the limb.", 
    "19": "1. In rabbit pulmonary artery and left atrial strips previously incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline, the active fragment of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH 1-24, 0.1 microM) significantly enhanced the stimulation-induced (S-I) outflow of radioactivity when a cocktail containing corticosterone (40 microM), cocaine (30 microM) and propranolol (4 microM) was present, but not in the absence of these drugs. In rabbit pulmonary artery a facilitatory effect of ACTH 1-24 (0.1 microM) was also observed when only cocaine (30 microM) was present. 2. ACTH 1-24 (0.1 microM) did not affect the S-I outflow of radioactivity from rat atria, rat pulmonary artery or guinea-pig pulmonary artery, either in the presence or in the absence of the cocktail containing corticosterone (40 microM), cocaine (30 microM) and propranolol (4 microM). These results suggest that the presence of facilitatory prejunctional ACTH receptors may be restricted to rabbit sympathetic nerve endings. 3. Angiotensin II (0.01 microM), but not isoprenaline (0.1 microM) or ACTH 1-24 (0.1 microM), significantly enhanced the S-I outflow of radioactivity from rabbit pulmonary artery. In the presence of phentolamine (1 microM) to block inhibitory alpha 2-adrenoceptors, the facilitatory effect of angiotensin II (0.01 microM) was significantly enhanced, and a significant facilitatory effect of isoprenaline (0.1 microM) and of ACTH 1-24 (0.1 microM) was then revealed. These results suggest that feedback inhibition of noradrenaline release, mediated through the prejunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptor mechanism, buffers increases in noradrenaline release during activation of facilitatory prejunctional receptors. 4. In rabbit pulmonary artery, two concentrations of 8-Br-cyclic AMP, (270 or 540 microM), enhanced the S-I outflow of radioactivity in the presence of phentolamine (1 microM) to a similar extent. In the presence of 8-Br-cyclic AMP (270 microM) and phentolamine, the facilitatory effects of isoprenaline (0.1 microM) and of ACTH,24 (0.1 microM) were blocked, whereas that of angiotensin II (0.01 microM) was not changed. These results suggest that both prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors and ACTH receptors enhance noradrenaline release by generating cyclic AMP. The mechanism by which angiotensin II facilitates noradrenaline release is probably independent of the cyclic AMP second messenger pathway.", 
    "20": "We have investigated the effect of dietary fat on isoproterenol-stimulated and propranolol-inhibited heart rate in the rat. In the first experiment, weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets containing 10% butter (10B), 10% corn oil (10C) or 9% butter/1% corn oil (10M) for 4 wk. Heart rate was determined in response to increasing i.v. doses of isoproterenol. The percent stimulation at the highest dose of isoproterenol (100 microM) was found to be significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in the 10C-fed group than either the 10B- and 10M-fed groups. A similar study investigated the effect of propranolol inhibition of heart rate in low-fat (10C and 10B) as well as high-fat (25C) corn oil- and high-fat (25B) butter-fed animals. Heart rate was elevated with a constant i.v. infusion of isoproterenol and the inhibitory effect of propranolol was determined. The ED50 was found not to depend on the level of fat, but was found to be significantly lower in the corn oil-fed animals than in those red butter fat (P less than 0.05). Thus, animals appear to be more sensitive to these beta-adrenergic agonists/antagonists when fed a diet containing corn oil rather than butter fat as the lipid source.", 
    "21": "To study the functional maturity of beta-receptor-mediated responses, seven chronically catheterized lamb fetuses, 93-107 days of gestation, and seven fetuses, 116-134 days of gestation, received intravenous randomly sequenced infusions of isoproterenol (ISO) 0.03, 0.06, and 0.125 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 10 min separated by 45-min intervals or two saline infusions followed by 0.125 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 ISO after treatment with 0.5 mg/kg propranolol (PRO). Each fetus received the two treatments 24-48 h apart. In immature fetuses, plasma renin activity (PRA) of 2.0 +/- 0.7 ng.ml-1.h-1 did not change with either protocol. In mature fetuses, PRA of 7.5 +/- 2.5 ng.ml-1.h-1 increased two- to three-fold after the infusion of the highest two doses of ISO (P less than 0.003). Propranolol blocked this response. No significant changes were observed after the infusions of the lowest dose of ISO or saline. Both groups showed significant heart rate increases with all doses of ISO. Propranolol injection decreased heart rate significantly and blocked responses to ISO. We conclude that although a cardiac beta-receptor-mediated response is present by 93 days of gestation in the lamb fetus, a renal beta-receptor-mediated response, renin secretion, is absent.", 
    "22": "Previous studies on numerous cardiac preparations have shown that stimulation of alpha 1-receptors produces a positive inotropic effect. The cellular basis for this effect is not well understood. Isolated feline ventricular myocytes were used in the present study to examine the idea that the increase in contractility induced by stimulation of alpha 1-receptors is produced by an increase in inward Ca2+ current and that this event is caused by the stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC). These experiments showed that phenylephrine (10(-4) M) increased Ca2+ current from 0.56 +/- 0.02 (control) to 1.12 +/- 0.25 nA and increased contractile magnitude by 201 +/- 28%. The effect on Ca2+ current was completely blocked by propranolol (10(-7)M), whereas after beta-receptor blockade, contractile state was still 130 +/- 8% of control levels. alpha 1-Receptor blockade by prazosin eliminated this residual inotropic component of phenylephrine. Lower concentrations of phenylephrine (10(-7)M) were without effect on Ca2+ current and contractility as was stimulation of PCK with 150 nM of a phorbol ester. These results suggest that the positive inotropic effect of alpha 1-receptor stimulation in adult feline ventricular myocytes is not produced by increasing inward Ca2+ current and that this response is also not associated with stimulation of PKC.", 
    "23": "Our objective was to investigate the integrated pulmonary vascular response of conscious dogs to combined inhibition of the autonomic nervous system, arginine vasopressin (V1) receptors (vasopressinergic V1), and converting enzyme to identify the overall influence of these three major neurohumoral mechanisms in vascular regulation of the pulmonary circulation. Multipoint pulmonary vascular pressure-cardiac index (P/Q) plots were generated by graded constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava, which produced stepwise decreases in Q. When compared with the P/Q relationship measured in intact conscious dogs, combined neurohumoral block resulted in active, nonflow-dependent pulmonary vasodilation. A second objective was to assess the extent to which cyclooxygenase pathway inhibition modified both the intact P/Q relationship and the pulmonary vasodilator response to combined neurohumoral block. Cyclooxygenase inhibition alone (either indomethacin or sodium meclofenamate) resulted in active, nonflow-dependent pulmonary vasoconstriction. Moreover, the pulmonary vasodilation in response to combined neurohumoral block was entirely abolished following cyclooxygenase inhibition. Thus the integrated pulmonary vascular response of conscious dogs to combined neurohumoral block is active vasodilation. This response appears to be mediated by metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway.", 
    "24": "The receptors mediating adrenergic stimulation of acid secretion by Amphiuma jejunum were characterized in this study using alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. Isolated segments of jejunum were mounted in Ussing chambers and bathed in Cl- -free (SO4(2-] medium. Shortcircuit current (Isc) and acid secretion (JH) were recorded, the latter by measuring the rate of alkalinization of the serosal medium. The beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol (10(-4) M), had no effect on the Isc and JH stimulated by norepinephrine (NE). The alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, clonidine and UK-14,304, mimicked the effect of NE, with effective concentrations providing 50% maximal delta Isc of 2.0 X 10(-7) and 9.0 X 10(-8) M, respectively. NE added subsequently produced no greater stimulation. In contrast, the alpha 1-adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine, produced little stimulation of JH and Isc; NE added subsequently stimulated the Isc. The alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin had no effect on the NE-induced Isc or JH, whereas the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine inhibited the NE-stimulated Isc with a half-maximal effective concentration of 3.5 X 10(-7) M. Yohimbine (10(-4) M) reduced the NE-stimulated Isc by 88%, whereas the spontaneous Isc was reduced by only 12%. These results demonstrate that alpha 2-adrenergic receptors on the basolateral membrane of Amphiuma enterocytes mediate NE-enhanced, but not spontaneous, intestinal acid secretion.", 
    "25": "The postnatal development of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to beta-adrenergic receptors has been studied in frontal cortex, cerebellum, striatum, and hypothalamus of the rat after prenatal and perinatal exposure to diazepam. Dams were injected subcutaneously with single daily doses of 1 mg of diazepam/kg from day 7 to 20 of gestation or from day 15 of gestation to day 6 after birth. Prenatal exposure had no effect on litter size or length of gestation or on the postnatal development of body and brain weights of the progeny. However, a reduced mortality of the pups was observed in relation to vehicle-treated controls until postnatal day 10. Prenatal diazepam administration decreased [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding in frontal cortex, striatum, and hypothalamus but not in cerebellum. This decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor binding was due to a decrease in receptor density rather than in receptor affinity. In contrast, perinatal diazepam exposure led to a transient decrease in [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding limited to the frontal cortex. The permanent reduction in number of beta-adrenergic receptors, which depends on the scaling and duration of the drug application period, points to the necessity of a prolonged evaluation of effects of exposure to psychotropic drugs in early stages of brain development.", 
    "26": "The specific beta-adrenergic radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) was used to identify and characterize beta-adrenergic receptors in bovine pituitary folliculo-stellate cells (bFSC) grown in culture. Saturation analysis demonstrated the binding of ICYP to bFSC particulate fractions to be of high affinity (apparent Kd = 80 pM) and low capacity (Bmax = 37 fmol/mg protein). The specific beta-adrenergic radioligand [3H] dihydroalprenolol also bound to bFSC particulate preparations with parameters compatible with binding to the beta-adrenergic receptor (Kd = 3.0 nM; Bmax = 52 fmol/mg protein). No specific binding was observed with either the dopamine receptor radioligand [3H]spiperone or the alpha-adrenergic radioligand [3H]dihydro-alpha-ergocryptine. The bFSC beta-adrenergic receptors were further characterized by computer modeling of competition studies with a variety of agonists and antagonists selective for beta-adrenergic subtypes. The pharmacological profiles of ICYP binding obtained from these studies indicated that approximately equal proportions of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic subtypes are expressed in cultured bFSC. Bovine FSC beta-adrenergic receptors are functionally coupled to activation of cAMP. The beta-adrenergic agonists isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine provoked a rapid and marked stimulation of intracellular cAMP accumulation. The approximately equipotent effect of epinephrine and norepinephrine indicated that the beta-adrenergic effect on cAMP production is principally mediated via the beta 1-adrenergic receptor. The identification of beta-adrenergic receptors on bFSC positively coupled to adenylate cyclase provides a possible regulatory control pathway for the proposed role of pituitary FSC in the modulation of anterior pituitary hormone secretion.", 
    "27": "The effects of Bay k 8644, a dihydropyridine calcium agonist, on sinoatrial (SA) node pacemaker activity and atrial contractility and its interaction with the calcium antagonists, nicardipine and verapamil, were investigated in the isolated, blood-perfused dog atrium. Bay k 8644 (0.03-30 micrograms) increased sinus rate and atrial contractility dose dependently. Norepinephrine (NE) and CaCl2 dose dependently increased the sinus rate and contractility but the positive chronotropic effect of CaCl2 was much less than that of the other drugs. The positive chronotropic effect of Bay K 8644 (0.3-1 microgram) was dose dependently depressed by nicardipine at doses of 1-10 micrograms but the inotropic effect was depressed only by a large dose of 10 micrograms. After sinus arrest induced by nicardipine (10-30 micrograms), SA node pacemaker activity was readily restored by Bay k 8644 or NE. Verapamil (1-3 micrograms) also depressed the positive chronotropic effect of Bay k 8644 more effectively than the inotropic effect although it did not attenuate the chronotropic effect of NE. The inotropic interaction could not be evaluated at higher doses of antagonists because of sinus arrest. Propranolol (3 micrograms) suppressed both positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of NE but did not depress the Bay k 8644-induced responses. These results show that the antagonism between Bay k 8644 and calcium antagonists is predominant on SA node pacemaker activity in cardiac tissues.", 
    "28": "The antiarrhythmic efficacy of a slow-release form of metoprolol was studied in 13 male coronary patients, mean age 47 years (39-59 years) with frequent and complex ventricular arrhythmias (couplets, salvos). The prospective, single-blind trial was based on 24 h Holter monitoring. In each case, the extent of coronary heart disease and the presence of old myocardial infarction was documented by coronary angiography. Initial treatment with placebo was followed by active treatment with 200 and 400 mg metoprolol per day, respectively, and placebo again during one week each. Thereafter, 200 mg metoprolol/24 h were administered over a period of one month. At the end of each treatment period, metoprolol plasma levels were determined simultaneously with the assessment of cardiac arrhythmias by Holter monitoring. Under a daily dose of 400 mg metoprolol, plasma levels increased from 235 +/- 326 (under 200 mg) to 841 +/- 613 mumol/l (p less than 0.001), and mean heart rate decreased from 75 to 63 bpm (p less than 0.001), the average number of ventricular extrasystoles decreased from 1,722 to 480/24 h (p less than 0.05) and the number of couplets from 38 to 7/24 h (p less than 0.05) when compared to the placebo period. After one month's treatment with 200 mg metoprolol per day, a significant reduction in heart rate from 75 to 67 bpm was observed (p less than 0.05); however, antiarrhythmic efficacy with regard to the number of premature ventricular contractions and couplets was insignificant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "Twenty patients aged 55 +/- 16 years with 40 chronic ventricular tachycardias (VT) refractory to 4.6 +/- 1.9 antiarrhythmic drugs, used alone or in combination, were managed by low doses of beta-blocker agents combined with oral amiodarone (Am), either after loading (1.2 g for 7 days, n: 5) or reloading (1.2 g for 4 days, n: 15) of Am. All patients proved refractory to Am alone. Seven VT were also refractory to endocardial catheter fulguration in six patients. Thirteen patients had coronary artery disease, three had arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, two had dilated cardiomyopathy, one had valvular disease, and one had no structural heart disease. Ten patients had an EF less than 30%. Ten patients were in NYHA functional class three. VT was permanent in three patients, daily in three, weekly in seven, paroxysmal in seven. In 11 patients, VT occurred both at day and night. In 11 patients, decrease of the sinus cycle preceeded VT. Oral administration of a daily low dose of a beta blocker agent (acebutolol 100 mg, betaxolol 5-10 mg, metoprolol 50 mg, nadolol 20-40 mg, pindolol 2.5 mg, propanolol 30 mg, sotalol 80-160 mg, terta-tolol 2.5 mg) combined with 400 mg/day of Am suppressed VT episodes in all patients. None presented heart failure or collapse. The mean reduction of the heart rate was 15% (65 to 55/min). At discharge, exercise ECG (n: 14) induced non sustained VT in two patients. At programmed electrical stimulation (PES) (n: 15), VT was no longer inducible in 4 patients, was slower, well-tolerated in nine patients, and remained inducible at the same rate in only two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "1. Isolated segments of the guinea-pig ileum were vascularly perfused and the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) into the portal venous effluent was determined by h.p.l.c. with electrochemical detection. Test substances were applied via the arterial perfusion medium. 2. Isoprenaline (0.1 microM) increased the outflow of 5-HT and 5-HIAA maximally by about 75% and this was antagonized by propranolol (0.1 microM). Forskolin (1-10 microM) increased the outflow of 5-HT by approximately 105% and that of 5-HIAA by approximately 55%. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor AH 21-132 (0.1-1 microM) increased the outflow of 5-HT and 5-HIAA by about 70%. Isoprenaline (1 nM) and AH 21-132 (10 nM), which alone had no effect, increased the outflow of 5-HT and 5-HIAA by 75%, when applied in combination. 3. Clonidine (1 microM) reduced the outflow of 5-HT by 45%, an effect blocked by tolazoline (1 microM), but not by prazosin (0.1 microM). 4. The effects of isoprenaline, forskolin and clonidine were also observed in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 microM) demonstrating a direct modulation of 5-HT release from the enterochromaffin cells. 5. In conclusion, the release of 5-HT from enterochromaffin cells is facilitated by activation of beta-adrenoceptors and inhibited via alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Enhancing intracellular cyclic AMP, by direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin or by inhibition of phosphodiesterase, also facilitates the release of 5-HT. The beta-adrenoceptor-mediated effect on 5-HT release appears to involve an increase in cyclic AMP, as the effect of isoprenaline was potentiated after inhibition of phosphodiesterase.", 
    "31": "Preliminary animal studies indicate tha celiprolol has antiarrhythmic properties. Animal and clinical electrophysiologic studies suggest that the antiarrhythmic activity is from celiprolol beta-blocking effects (class II antiarrhythmic). Studies with anesthetized dogs show that celiprolol elevates the ventricular fibrillation threshold. An unexpected finding in the canine infarct drug model is the spontaneous conversion of ventricular fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm. The beta2-agonist property of celiprolol may account for this observation. In a clinical study celiprolol has bee found to decrease ventricular rate in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. In the same study, the compound decreased the occurrence of premature ventricular contractions by 50%. Animal and clinical studies demonstrate that celiprolol does not adversely interact wit digitalis glycosides.", 
    "32": "3,4-Dihydroxyphenylethylamine (dopamine) and beta-adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists were assessed for their effects on cyclic AMP accumulation in human astrocytoma derived clone D384 cells. Dopamine, SKF 38393, and 2-amino-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene increased cyclic AMP content with Ka values of 2.0, 0.2, and 1.6 microM. The D1-selective antagonists SCH 23390 (Ki, 1.2 nM) and SKF 83566 (Ki, 0.8 nM) were over 5,000-fold more potent than the D2-selective antagonist domperidone (Ki, 6.7 microM) at inhibiting dopamine stimulation of cyclic AMP formation. SCH 23388 (Ki, 560 nM; the S-enantiomer of SCH 23390) was 400-fold less potent than SCH 23390. Isoprenaline, adrenaline, salbutamol, and noradrenaline increased cyclic AMP content with Ka values of 0.13, 0.12, 0.22, and 7.60 microM. The beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 (Ki,0.8 nM) was almost 8,000-fold more potent than the beta 1-selective antagonist practolol (Ki, 5.9 microM) at inhibiting isoprenaline stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. These results demonstrate that D384 cells express D1-dopamine and beta 2-adrenergic receptors linked to adenylate cyclase. Furthermore, the dopamine receptor expressed by D384 cells exhibits a pharmacological profile typical of a mammalian striatal D1-receptor and therefore the use of this clone represents another approach to studying central D1-receptors.", 
    "33": "A direct method is described for the resolution of the enantiomers of betaxolol, a novel cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, using a tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)cellulose chiral column. An excellent resolution of the two antipodes is obtained (Rs greater than 2) with high peak symmetries. The method is simple and ideally suited to the routine control of the enantiomeric excess in the bulk drug and the analysis of the enantiomers of betaxolol in hepatocyte suspensions. With modification of the polar modifier in a hexane-based mobile phase, most commercially available beta-blockers can be baseline resolved.", 
    "34": "Using reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography, with octan-1-ol as stationary phase and phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) as mobile phase, the behaviour of different drugs at 37 degrees C was studied. Three classes of drug were examined: beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. As well as ranking these compounds in terms of their distribution coefficients, an attempt was also made to assign a quantitative value to each. For the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists this was done by using a series of published values obtained using the shake-flask technique: for the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents a series of standard compounds was used. No good calibration data were available for the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, but approximate values were assigned. The results obtained were compared with other published data and the applicability of the method discussed.", 
    "35": "In the present study, we investigated the cardiovascular effects of dl-nebivolol, a newly synthetized, chemically novel, beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist and its enantiomers, d-nebivolol (SRRR) and l-nebivolol (RSSS), in closed-chest anesthetized dogs, using atenolol as a reference substance. Results from preliminary studies in vitro indicate that d-nebivolol is the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist and that l-nebivolol is practically devoid of beta-adrenoceptor-blocking properties. Unlike atenolol, dl-nebivolol does not depress left ventricular function and slightly, but significantly, reduces peripheral vascular resistance over the dose range from 0.0025 to 0.04 mg.kg-1 i.v. These observations are likely to be clinically relevant because one daily oral dose of 5 mg dl-nebivolol effectively lowers arterial blood pressure in patients with hypertension. The favorable hemodynamic profile of dl-nebivolol can be ascribed to the l-enantiomer because the cardiovascular effects of this enantiomer are similar to those of the racemate. The cardiovascular profile of the d-enantiomer is similar to that of atenolol, albeit that its depressant effect on left ventricular function occurs at higher doses.", 
    "36": "The mechanisms by which insulin inhibits catecholamine-induced lipolysis in fat cells are unknown. In this study the possible role of an interaction between insulin and the adrenoceptors on human fat cells was investigated. Insulin inhibited, in a dose-dependent fashion, the specific binding of hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic nonselective beta-receptor radioligands but had no effect on the binding of alpha 2-selective radioligands. The results of saturation experiments and competition-inhibition experiments under both equilibrium conditions and nonequilibrium conditions revealed that insulin reduced the total number of beta-adrenergic binding sites (maximum effect 25%) without changing the beta-adrenoceptor affinity. This insulin effect was rapid and reversible; one-third of the effect occurred within 1 min of incubation and it was completely reversed within 30 min after withdrawal of insulin. It could be mimicked by a polyclonal rabbit insulin receptor antibody but not by insulin mimickers acting distal to the initial interaction between the hormone and its specific insulin-receptor binding site. The beta-adrenoceptor binding to a plasma membrane-enriched fraction decreased at the same time as it increased to a microsomal enriched fraction after insulin treatment, indicating a redistribution of beta-adrenoceptors in the cell. In lipolysis experiments performed under conditions like those in the binding experiments, insulin inhibited the rate of lipolysis with a lag period of 3 min. Furthermore, the hormone caused a dose-dependent maximum 10-fold shift to the right of the dose-response curve for isoprenaline-induced lipolysis without changing the amplitude of the curve. This effect of insulin was specific for the beta-adrenergic receptors system, since insulin markedly decreased the amplitude of the dose-response curve for parathyroid hormone-induced lipolysis. In addition, the effect of insulin on isoprenaline-induced lipolysis could be mimicked by long-lasting fractional inactivation of the beta-adrenoceptors. The dose-response relationships for the inhibitory effects of insulin on beta-adrenoceptor binding and the lipolytic sensitivity to isoprenaline were almost identical. Half-maximum and maximum effects occurred at about 5 and 100 microunits/ml of insulin, respectively. In conclusion, the exposure of human fat cells to physiological insulin doses is followed by a rapid and dose-dependent translocation of beta-adrenoceptors from the exterior to the interior of the cell and a subsequent dose-dependent decrease in the lipolytic sensitivity to beta-adrenergic agonists, without a change in maximum lipolysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "37": "Incubation of cultured mesenteric vascular smooth muscle cells with dopamine, in the presence of propranolol, caused an increase in cyclic AMP formation in a concentration-dependent manner (Ka apparent 6.8 +/- 0.5 microM). This effect of dopamine was inhibited by the DA1-receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (Ki = 1 nM). These results suggest that cultured mesenteric vascular smooth muscle cells express DA1-receptors linked to adenylate cyclase.", 
    "38": "Bilateral adrenalectomy, like chronic pineal denervation by means of superior cervical ganglionectomy, induced an increase in the morning levels of [125I]iodopindolol (IPIN) binding to rat pineal membranes; this change may be related to the reduced input of catecholamines to the pinealocytes as suggested by the decrease in nocturnal pineal melatonin synthesis previously reported in adrenalectomized rats. Castrated rats did not show changes in IPIN binding to pineal membranes when measured either at middark or in chronically superior cervical ganglionectomized rats, suggesting that the regulation of pineal beta-adrenergic receptors is independent from gonadal control.", 
    "39": "The ability of angiotensin II to down-regulate its receptor was tested on rat hepatocytes in primary culture for 4 h. Angiotensin II treatment decreased [3H]angiotensin II specific binding in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The effect was maximum with 1 microM angiotensin II and after 2 h. There was a decrease in the maximum number of binding sites (56% of control) with no significant effect on the apparent dissociation constant. The down-regulation was blocked by the angiotensin II antagonist [Val4,Ile7]angiotensin III and was not induced by other hormones (e.g. vasopressin, norepinephrine, or glucagon) or by 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate or A23187 ionophore. The decrease in angiotensin II receptors resulted in correlated decreases in the potency of angiotensin II to activate phosphorylase or lower glucagon-induced cAMP accumulation. However, high concentrations of the agonist were still able to elicit maximal responses in both parameters. Down-regulation of the receptor was not dependent upon active Gi, since it was still observed after ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of Gi by pertussis toxin. The above results indicate that the down-regulation of the hepatic angiotensin II receptor induced by its agonist is homologous and does not involve Gi, Ca2+, or protein kinase C. The correlation of receptor loss with decreases in the potency of angiotensin to activate phosphorylase and inhibit glucagon-induced cAMP accumulation is consistent with the idea that a single receptor population regulates two different messengers, i.e. calcium and cAMP.", 
    "40": "The effectiveness of metoprolol as a prophylactic treatment of migraine was investigated in double-blind comparative trials involving more than 500 patients. In two trials using a slow-release preparation and a dose of 200 mg per day, metoprolol proved significantly better than a placebo and as effective as propranolol 160 mg/day or flunarizine 10 mg/day. At the dose of 100 mg per day metoprolol was significantly more effective than clonidine and clomipramine and not different from a placebo, propranolol 80 mg/day or pizotifen 1.5 mg/day. It is concluded that metoprolol is useful as prophylactic treatment of migraine and ranks among the main drugs used for the same purpose, such as propranolol and pizotifen.",

Acutely, propranolol decreased both maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and exercise duration compared with metoprolol and placebo. Chronically, VO2max increased 24% (95% CI, 8 to 40) in response to training on placebo and 8% on metoprolol (95% CI, 3 to 14); it did not increase on propranolol (95% CI, -10 to 15).",

    "48": "The novel brown adipose tissue (BAT) selective beta-adrenergic agonist, BRL 37344, is 31-fold more potent than (-)-isoproterenol in stimulating the respiratory rate of interscapular BAT fragments. BRL 37344 is also more potent (9-fold) than (-)-isoproterenol in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity of IBAT purified plasma membranes whereas, in the same preparation, it is 81-fold less potent than (-)-isoproterenol in competition displacement studies with the beta-adrenergic ligand, [125I]cyanopindolol. We have previously demonstrated that the photoaffinity reagent [125I]cyanopindolol-diazirine selectively labels a 62 kDa protein in IBAT plasma membranes that displays pharmacological properties of a beta 1-adrenergic subtype. Relatively high concentrations of BRL 37344 (10 microM) are required to displace [125I]cyanopindolol-diazirine binding to the 62 kDa protein. Taken together, the results suggest that two different populations of beta-adrenergic receptors may co-exist in BAT plasma membranes: a small population (about 15%) of atypical beta-receptors and a large population of beta 1-receptors that exhibit high and low affinities for BRL 37344, respectively.", 
    "49": "An iodinated photosensitive derivative of norepinephine, N-(p-azido-m-iodophenethylamidoisobutyl)-norepinephrine (NAIN), has been synthesized and characterized. NAIN stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in guinea pig lung membranes in a manner similar to (-)-isoproterenol and was inhibited by (-)-alprenolol. NAIN was shown to compete with [125I]iodocyanobenzylpindolol for the beta-adrenergic receptor in guinea pig lung membranes with an affinity which was dependent on the presence of guanyl nucleotides. Carrier-free radioiodinated NAIN ([125I]NAIN) was used at 2 nM to photoaffinity label the beta-adrenergic receptor in guinea pig lung membranes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of (-)-alprenolol (1 microM) protectable [125I]NAIN labeling showed the same molecular mass polypeptide (65 kDa) that was specifically derivatized with the antagonist photolabel [125I]iodoazidobenzylpindolol. Specific labeling of the beta-adrenergic receptor with [125I]NAIN was dependent on the presence of MgCl2 and the absence of guanyl nucleotide. Guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate (100 microM) abolished specific labeling by [125I]NAIN. N-Ethylmaleimide (2 mM) in the presence of [125I]NAIN protected against the magnesium and guanyl nucleotide effect. These data show that NAIN is an agonist photolabel for the beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "50": "beta-blockade can result in extreme bradycardia, significant conduction problems, bronchospasm, or left ventricular dysfunction. For this reason, the use of long-acting beta-blockers is of limited value in the perioperative period. Esmolol, due to its ultrashort action and cardioselective properties, has been shown to be safe and effective for use in treatment of tachycardia and hypertension. Doses of up to 300 microg/kg/min for up to seven hours have been used with a return to baseline parameters within 30 minutes of discontinuation of the infusion. It can also be safely used in treatment of the asthmatic patient with tachycardia or hypertension with no clinically significant increases in airway resistance.

    "51": "Use of pancuronium or vecuronium with the priming principle was evaluated in regards to hemodynamic changes and adequacy of relaxation for a rapid induction-endotracheal intubation sequence with sufentanil in 24 ASA Class III-IV patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Twelve patients taking beta-blockers (groups B-P and B-V) were compared with 12 patients not receiving beta-blockers (groups NB-P and NB-V). Patients randomly received vecuronium or pancuronium (15 microg/kg), followed in 4 minutes by sufentanil 5 microg/kg and another 85 microg/kg of the appropriate relaxant through a central vein. Intubation was possible in all patients at 90 seconds with good-to-excellent conditions. Heart rate (HR) remained statistically elevated after induction (90 +/- 10 beats/min) and intubation (105 +/- 10 beats/min) only in group NB-P (baseline 74 +/- 12 beats/min). The NB-P group also had an elevated blood pressure after the priming dose. No significant hemodynamic changes were found in the other groups in mean arterial pressure, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, systemic vascular resistance (SVRI), or cardiac index (CI). When used with vecuronium, sufentanil in a dose of 5 microg/kg provided adequate anesthesia to avoid the hypertensive, tachycardic response that frequently occurs following a rapid intravenous (IV) induction, without unduly depressing cardiac output or arterial pressure. Two patients had evidence of respiratory difficulty after the priming dose, associated with transient tachycardia and hypertension which resolved after induction. Using the priming principle, either pancuronium or vecuronium rapidly provided relaxation in patients with cardiac disease. Chronic beta-blocker therapy was able to attenuate the tachycardia from pancuronium and was not associated with bradycardia when used with vecuronium. In patients with cardiac disease not on beta-blockers, pancuronium was associated with tachycardia. Therefore, vecuronium appears to be more suitable for these patients.", 
    "52": "Twenty-six patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism treated only with propranolol for 1-21 months have been followed up to 5 years. The patients were evaluated before treatment, at 15, 30, and 90 days during treatment, and then at 90-day intervals during propranolol treatment by clinical examination and measurement of serum free T3, free T4, rT3, TSH, and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations and serum anti-thyroglobulin, antithyroid microsomal, antithyroid peroxidase, and thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies. Eighteen patients who had no biochemical improvement during propranolol therapy or relapsed after initial improvement were treated conventionally. In contrast, eight patients had a biochemical remission, which has lasted 30-48 months after propranolol withdrawal. The biochemical values before and during treatment did not differ among the two groups of patients, except for the initial serum free T3 levels which were significantly higher in the patients who had no remission. Serum TSH levels returned to normal only in patients who had a long-lasting remission. While thyroid autoantibodies decreased or disappeared during follow-up, the evolution of thyroid-stimulating autoantibody values was grossly related to the clinical outcome. Long-lasting remissions may occur in patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease not given ablative or antithyroid drug therapy. Since propranolol is devoid of antithyroid and immunosuppressive actions, these remissions are probably spontaneous. Although they tended to occur in patients with less severe disease, no biological parameter was found that predicted the outcome.", 
    "53": "Because beta-adrenoreceptor agonists inhibit gastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion in animals, we postulated that the beta 2-adrenoreceptor agonist, terbutaline, would inhibit pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion in humans. Moreover, we hypothesized that terbutaline might inhibit food-stimulated acid secretion, as gastrin is a major mediator of food-stimulated acid secretion. Subcutaneous terbutaline (0.25 mg) reduced acid secretion during intravenous infusion of a submaximal dose of pentagastrin by 30%-40% (p less than 0.005), even though terbutaline increased serum gastrin levels (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, subcutaneous (0.25 mg) or oral (5 mg) terbutaline, given before a homogenized steak meal was infused into the stomach, lowered mean food-stimulated acid secretion rates, despite enhanced postprandial serum gastrin concentrations. Terbutaline also increased serum gastrin concentrations in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and in vagotomized individuals. Thus, beta 2-adrenoreceptor agonists enhance gastrin release while at the same time inhibiting gastrin-stimulated acid secretion in humans.",

There were no adverse side effects requiring the discontinuation of the propranolol, and in all cases, the agitated behavior was controlled without inducing general sedation. Both the nursing home staff and the families were pleased with the therapeutic effects. Propranolol represents a possible alternative way of addressing the severe problem of agitated behavior in senile dementia patients.", 
    "56": "The stimulation of DNA synthesis by serum is accompanied by early (30 minutes) and late (2-8 hours) increase in ouabain-sensitive rubidium (potassium) influx and the elevation of intracellular potassium content from 0.5-0.6 to 0.7-0.8 mmole per gram protein in CHO-K1 cells. Isoproterenol alone induces the transient increase both in potassium influx via Na,K-ATPase and in potassium efflux without any effect on intracellular potassium content and cell proliferation. Isoproterenol acts synergistically with serum in eliciting the early and late changes in potassium transport and in stimulating G1----S transition. The combination of serum and theophylline produces a rapid increase in potassium influx, however, it does not stimulate DNA synthesis and does not induce any later increase in intracellular potassium content. It is concluded that early and late activation of Na,K-ATPase by mitogens can be dissociated; the Na,K-ATPase activation is involved in mitogenic response when producing the sustained potassium influx and the elevation of intracellular potassium content during G1----S transition.", 
    "57": "In urethane-anesthetized rats with an intact spinal cord, application of capsaicin on the outer surface of the urinary bladder produced a transient bradycardia, hypotension and negative cardiac inotropism which were neither prevented by i.v. atropine (0.5 mg/kg) nor by cervical vagotomy. In acute spinal rats (C2-C3) application of capsaicin (0.2 and 2 micrograms in 25 microliters) on the urinary bladder induced a transient hypertension, tachycardia and positive cardiac inotropism. A second application (30 min later) induced minor cardiovascular effects, expecially with the higher dose, indicating desensitization. All cardiovascular responses to topical capsaicin were abolished by systemic capsaicin desensitization (50 mg/kg s.c., 4 days before). The excitatory cardiovascular response to capsaicin in acute spinal rats was markedly reduced by bilateral section of pelvic but not hypogastric nerves. Further, it was abolished by pretreatment with hexamethonium (20 mg/kg i.v.) or reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p., 2 days before) and reduced, at various extent for the different components, by phentolamine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) or propranolol (1 mg/kg). In rats with pelvic and hypogastric nerves intact, section of the cord at a level (T12-L1), just above the medullary segments which receive primary afferent input from the bladder (L6-S1), abolished the excitatory cardiovascular response to application of capsaicin on the bladder. In spinal rats (C2-C3) rapid distension of the urinary bladder with saline produced transient tachycardia, hypertension and positive cardiac inotropism similar to that evoked by capsaicin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "58": "We have studied the effects of a lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) on antagonism of leukotriene (LT) C4-induced contractions of isolated guinea-pig trachea and the results were compared to that of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. NDGA (30 microM) as well as indomethacin (5 microM) inhibited LTC4-induced contractions. But, in the presence of indomethacin NDGA was ineffective to inhibit the LTC4 response, whereas two other lipoxygenase inhibitors, phenidone (3-30 microM) and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA, 10 microM), markedly inhibited it. The antagonist action of an LTD4 receptor antagonist FPL55712 against LTC4-induced contractions was significantly reduced by NDGA (10-30 microM), but indomethacin had no effect on it. NDGA possessed the same inhibitory effect on the LTC4 antagonism in the presence of indomethacin, but 0.3 microM phenidone and 1 microM ETYA which did not inhibit the LTC4 response had no effect on it. NDGA also inhibited the relaxant response of isoproterenol on the contraction elicited by 30 nM LTC4, but did not affect those of forskolin and aminophylline. The relaxant response of isoproterenol on the LTC4 response was not inhibited by indomethacin, 0.3 microM phenidone and 1 microM ETYA. In the presence of a gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase inhibitor, L-serine borate (SB, 45 mM), NDGA had no effect on the LTC4 antagonism and the relaxant response of isoproterenol. In contrast, NDGA significantly inhibited the relaxant response of isoproterenol on 30 microM histamine- and 30 microM acetylcholine-induced contractions, but it did not affect the histamine antagonism by a histamine H1-blocker pyrilamine. These results suggest that some putative non-prostanoids are involved in LTC4-induced contractions of guinea-pig trachea and which regulate the effects of LTD4 antagonism and beta-adrenoceptor activation.", 
    "59": "According to theory, for a drug of nonrestrictive, flow-limited clearance, a change during pregnancy of the unbound fraction (fu) of drug in maternal plasma should cause a change in steady-state unbound plasma drug concentration (Cu) in maternal plasma, which should also cause a change in fetal Cu. This theory was examined in 14 chronically cannulated, unanesthetized pregnant ewes in which 28 separate experiments were performed during the latter part of gestation. An initial bolus dose and 3-h constant rate infusion of propranolol were administered via the maternal jugular vein and steady-state maternal and fetal carotid arterial plasma total and unbound propranolol concentrations were measured. Fetal Cu (32 +/- 21 ng/mL) was significantly less than maternal Cu (78 +/- 52 ng/mL), due to previously demonstrated fetal hepatic extraction of propranolol. Notwithstanding fetal elimination, there was a significant correlation between fetal Cu and maternal Cu (r = 0.41, p less than 0.025). There was also a strong correlation between fetal Cu and the maternal unbound fraction of drug (fu; r = 0.75, p less than 0.001). We conclude that for propranolol, a drug of nonrestrictive, flow-limited clearance, changes in maternal fu can have a significant influence on fetal Cu, and therefore would be expected to influence the pharmacological effect of the drug in the fetus.", 
    "60": "The plasma kinetics of a nifedipine/acebutolol fixed dose combination were estimated after a single oral dose in patients with chronic liver disease and in a healthy control group of the same age. The drug metabolism evidently slowed down in the group with chronic liver disease. The plasma elimination half-lives of acebutolol, diacetolol and nifedipine of these patients were about twice as long as that in the control group. Doses of these drugs should be accordingly reduced, particularly in cirrhosis.", 
    "61": "Short term observation following Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy indicates that serious elevation of intra-ocular pressure may occur, unrelated to the amount of incident energy used. In this study we evaluated the effect of pre-treatment with anti-prostaglandin eyedrops on the rise in IOP. The IOP in forty pseudophakic patients, undergoing Nd-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy, was measured before capsulotomy and 2 and 4 hours afterwards. The fellow-eye was used as a control. Thirty minutes pre-operatively the patients were given one of the four following combinations of eyedrops: 1 drop timolol 0.5% and 1 drop placebo, 1 drop indomethacin 1% and 1 drop placebo, 1 drop timolol 0.5% and 1 drop indomethacin 1%, 1 drop placebo and 1 drop placebo. Statistical analysis of the results showed that indomethacin alone has little influence on the IOP-rise, whereas timolol has. When indomethacin is added to timolol there is no significant enhancement.", 
    "62": "Propranolol hydrochloride is a beta-adrenergic blocking drug used in a variety of clinical conditions. Overdoses can result in severe hypotensive states usually associated with bradycardia or asystole or with profound myocardial depression. We report on an 18-year-old man who ingested a massive dose of propranolol HCl in a suicide attempt. The patient was brought to the hospital in an unresponsive state within 30 minutes of ingestion. He was initially stabilized but subsequently died nine hours after the drug was ingested. Invasive monitoring during this period revealed the shock to be secondary to marked depression of his systemic vascular resistance. Cardiac rhythm and left ventricular output were maintained throughout the attempted resuscitation. This hemodynamic picture suggests that decreased systemic vascular resistance may be another mechanism of shock in significant propranolol HCl overdoses.", 
    "63": "The stability of milrinone and digoxin, furosemide, procainamide hydrochloride, propranolol hydrochloride, quinidine gluconate, or verapamil hydrochloride in 5% dextrose injection containing milrinone was studied. Milrinone admixtures with digoxin, furosemide, propranolol hydrochloride, quinidine gluconate, and verapamil hydrochloride were studied at two concentrations. Admixtures of milrinone and procainamide hydrochloride were studied at four concentrations. Duplicate solutions of each admixture and each control were prepared and stored in glass containers for four hours at room temperature (22-23 degrees C), under normal fluorescent lights. The samples were analyzed immediately by visual inspection, tested for pH, and assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Milrinone 0.35 mg/mL-furosemide 4 mg/mL and milrinone 0.1 mg/mL-furosemide 5 mg/mL admixtures precipitated immediately after preparation and were not studied by HPLC. No changes in pH or visual appearance were observed in the remaining admixtures after storage at room temperature for four hours. Admixtures containing milrinone 0.175 or 0.2 mg/mL and procainamide hydrochloride 1, 2, or 4 mg/mL satisfied the USP standard for procainamide hydrochloride injection USP assay after one hour but failed this test in all cases after four hours. No degradation of milrinone was observed in any of the admixtures containing procainamide hydrochloride. Milrinone and furosemide are incompatible in 5% dextrose injection and should be administered separately. The remaining admixtures were compatible, and all except those containing procainamide hydrochloride were stable for four hours at room temperature.", 
    "64": "The risks of beta-blockers in asthmatics are well known. However, there are increasing reports of severe, and often refractory, anaphylaxis in patients taking beta-blockers who experience other allergic phenomena. We describe the case of a 69-year-old lady with long-standing recurrent angio-oedema and giant urticaria who was placed on atenolol. Mechanisms whereby beta-blockers may precipitate or exacerbate anaphylaxis are outlined and the treatment of patients with anaphylaxis, taking beta-blockers, is discussed.", 
    "65": "The ability of the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol to influence the response of isolated cardiac and vascular smooth muscle to several classes of calcium channel blockers was examined. For comparison, the interactions between propranolol and other classes of negative inotropic and vasorelaxant agents was also evaluated. The results of these studies demonstrate that propranolol pre-treatment significantly enhances the in vitro response to the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nifedipine, but not the thiazapine calcium channel blocker diltiazem. This enhancement was unrelated to the negative inotropic or vasorelaxant properties of these agents. In addition, propranolol pre-treatment of rat cortical membranes also enhanced the affinity of nifedipine for the 3H-nitrendipine binding site, but did not alter the effect of diltiazem on 3H-nitrendipine binding. These observations suggest that a direct interaction may exist between beta-receptor antagonists and dihydropyrine-type calcium channel blockers. This interaction may be an important factor in selecting drug therapy for conditions such as hypertension and angina.", 
    "66": "In conscious rats, in the presence of prazosin and idazoxan (alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, respectively), blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) become unstable, due to the occurrence of 'spontaneous' depressor and tachycardic episodes. These events could be triggered also by auditory stimuli, and were blocked by antagonism of beta 2-adrenoceptors. In adrenal-demedullated animals treated with prazosin and idazoxan, BP was less variable than in sham-operated animals, but bolus injections of adrenaline or salbutamol could simulate the 'spontaneous' depressor events seen in the latter. The marked swings in HR were not explained by sensitization of the cardiac baroreflex in the presence of idazoxan, but were probably due to blockade of prejunctional autoinhibitory alpha 2-adrenoceptors, amplifying the effects of intermittent sympatho-adrenal activation.", 
    "67": "Previous studies on the metabolic fate of antihypertensive agent labetalol in humans identified only conjugated metabolites of the drug and accounted for only a portion of the dose. In this study, urine samples obtained from three patients on chronic labetalol therapy for hypertension were analyzed initially by thin layer chromatography for the presence of other metabolites. All three urine samples were found to contain 3-amino-1-phenylbutane. The identify of this metabolite in one of the urine samples was confirmed by electron capture negative-ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry experiments also identified the presence in the urine sample of the D-hydroxy derivative of 3-amino-1-phenylbutane. The two metabolites are the result of oxidative biotransformations of labetalol. 3-Amino-1-phenylbutane has been reported to be a potent sympathomimetic agent, and the question arises whether the newly identified metabolites of labetalol contribute to its pharmacological effects.", 
    "68": "In 20 patients with cirrhosis we studied the relationship among the efficiency of beta-adrenergic blockade induced by oral administration of 40 mg propranolol, the plasma level of propranolol, and the liver function. The beta-adrenergic blockade was studied 2 h and 8 h after propranolol administration and assessed by the cardiac chronotropic response to isoprenaline. Liver function was evaluated by a standard liver function test and the Child-Turcotte or Pugh score. The beta-adrenergic blockade and propranolol plasma concentration were higher 2 h than 8 h after propranolol administration. The beta-adrenergic blockade and the propranolol plasma concentration varied widely among patients. No significant correlation was found between the efficiency of beta-blockade and propranolol concentration. The beta-adrenergic response before propranolol administration was correlated with bilirubin level and Child scores, but no significant correlation was found between the beta-blockade and the severity of liver disease. These results suggest that in patients with cirrhosis, differences in response to propranolol are not related to differences in the severity of the liver disease or to differences in propranolol concentration.", 
    "69": "The authors have conducted a study of 24 women (mean age: 28 years) whose 31 pregnancies were treated with a beta-blocker (propranolol, in most cases). The overall results were compared with data from the literature. The return to normal of the blood pressure (BP) was excellent (23 cases or 74.2%). The BP was poorly controlled in 8 out of 31 cases among which were found the 4 fetal deaths of the study. There was no toxemia, no maternal complications, no theoretical neonatal effect of the beta-blockers (nor bradycardia nor hypoglycaemia). As for fetal hypotrophy, it was more frequent when the ABP did not return to normal (57% hypotrophy vs 39%) and the beta-blocker, by causing a return to normal of the BP, decreases its incidence. In addition, the mean length of treatment exceeded 2.35 weeks in normotrophic newborns in comparison with the hypotrophic newborns. Concomitantly, the return to normal of the blood pressure is improved in normotrophic newborns. The risk of fetal hypotrophy attributed to the beta-blockers is therefore confirmed and these drugs even have a favorable effect on the birth weight.", 
    "70": "Acute cerebral infarction in gerbils, produced by unilateral carotid ligation, was used as a model to investigate secondary myocardial changes. The extent of the myocardial damage revealed by succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) histochemistry and by release of myocardial creatine phosphokinase (MB-CK) was measured in gerbils sacrificed from 3 to 48 h after either carotid ligation, carotid isolation only or skin incision only. For technical reasons dead animals were excluded from analysis. Of surviving ligated animals 74% developed neurological deficits related to brain ischaemia. A significant weight increase in the ipsilateral hemisphere was found at 6-10 h, and maximal histological damage at 16 h, both partially reversible thereafter. Non-ligated animals did not develop neurological changes, and showed neither brain swelling nor cerebral histopathology. Extensive cardiac damage was shown by the SDH method from 3 h postoperatively, and confirmed by the elevated serum levels of MB-CK in the carotid-ligated group. The SDH changes were identical with those described in the hearts of patients with acute intracranial lesions, and appeared to be reversible. The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade was assessed in this model. Metoprolol tartrate injected intraperitoneally 3 h before and 1 h after carotid ligation (10 mg/kg each dose) significantly decreased the extent of myocardial damage as estimated both with SDH histochemistry and MB-CK serum levels. It had no effect on the ischaemic brain changes. These results strongly support the concept of catecholamine mediation of myocardial injury resulting from acute brain lesions.", 
    "71": "Normal biconcave erythrocytes were transformed by the lysolipid lysolecithin (1-alpha-lysophosphatidylcholine, LPC) into spiculated and sphered corpuscles which had a normal viscosity at high shear rates despite their abnormal shape. The LPC induced a hitherto not identified metabolic process within the erythrocyte which depended on various factors as the Ca++-concentration, pH-value, and temperature of the suspending medium and which was advanced by guanosine or certain drugs as for instance moxaverine, a derivative of papaverine. This metabolic process normalized transiently the erythrocyte shape and deformability; but the cells started to become more viscous again during longer incubation though their shape remained normal. Because the shape of red cells correlated weakly with their deformability, it is suggested that measurements of the mechanical properties of erythrocytes should supplement the morphological studies in investigations of drugs which affect the red cell shape.", 
    "72": "Many studies have been performed to investigate the haemodynamic effects of propranolol. However, little is known of its actions on the metabolic activity of the liver. This study aimed to investigate the influence of propranolol on hepatic function as assessed by the galactose elimination capacity (GEC) and the intrinsic clearance of indocyanine green (ICG). 15 patients with biopsy-proven alcoholic cirrhosis and portal hypertension were studied. 10 had GEC and ICG clearance measured before and after the i.v. injection of 15 mg of propranolol (group P) and 5 had ICG clearance measurement before and after normal saline injection (group C). Propranolol significantly reduced heart rate (P less than 0.005) and the porto-hepatic pressure gradient (P less than 0.01). Hepatic blood flow was not changed. GEC was not altered by propranolol. Propranolol decreased the intrinsic hepatic clearance of ICG as determined by the 'sinusoidal' model by 12% (P less than 0.01). This suggests that propranolol may have an inhibitory action on the hepatic elimination of ICG that is independent of any effect on total liver blood flow or drug metabolism, since intrinsic clearance is not influenced by changes in blood flow and ICG is thought not to be metabolized.", 
    "73": "Limiting factors of maximal exercise performance are not clearly defined. In order to differentiate between various factors, maximal exercise was studied during continuous (n = 12) and intermittent (n = 9) exercise. The non-selective beta-blocker timolol (10 mg b.i.d. for 5 days) was compared double-blind and placebo controlled with the beta-1-selective beta-blocker metoprolol (100 mg b.i.d. for 5 days), with respect to effect on maximal exercise tolerance. Total cumulated work was comparable during continuous and intermittent exercise. Timolol and metoprolol reduced maximal exercise performance. No difference was observed between the two beta-blockers during intermittent exercise. The non-selective beta-blocker caused a greater reduction in exercise performance (10.4%) than the beta-1-selective beta-blocker (4.7%) (P less than 0.05) during continuous exercise. Maximal heart rate was higher with metoprolol than timolol during continuous exercise. The non-selective beta-blocker caused a slightly greater inhibition of lipolysis than the beta-1 selective one. No significant differences in glucose concentrations were observed between the treatment regimens. Exercise caused a marked increase in serum potassium concentrations. Beta-blockade caused further increase in potassium at any given workload. This study indicates that maximal working capacity is comparable during continuous and intermittent exercise. Beta-1-selective and non-selective beta-blockade reduce the maximal working capacity, non-selective more than beta-1-selective. Substrate availability was not responsible for the beta-blocker induced reduction of the working capacity. The rate of rise in serum potassium was significantly higher during beta-blockade and may, therefore, be a limiting factor for the maximal working capacity.", 
    "74": "Six patients with intraocular hypertension received 0.5% timolol or saline uniocularly with saline to the other eye, and the intraocular pressure was measured by applanation tonometry at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes. Falls in pressure were seen in both the timolol treated and consensual eyes. The same experiments were conducted after pretreatment of the consensual eyes with guanethidine 5%. The consensual ophthalmotonic reaction (COR) to timolol administration was blocked by pretreatment with guanethidine. Three out of four patients with Horner's syndrome also showed a reduced COR in the affected eye after timolol administration to the normal eye, suggesting that the COR is mediated by a nervous reflex with the efferent limb in the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "75": "The consensual ophthalmotonic reaction describes the phenomenon whereby alteration of the intraocular pressure in one eye is accompanied by a corresponding pressure change in the contralateral eye. Thirteen normal and thirteen ocular hypertensive subjects received 0.5% timolol, 2% pilocarpine, 1% adrenaline, or saline uniocularly with saline to the other eye under double blind, randomised conditions. Intraocular pressure was measured by applanation tonometry at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes. Falls in pressure were found in both treated and consensual eyes for all treatments in both subject groups. A linear relationship between the fall in pressure in the treated eye and that in the consensual eye was found for timolol and pilocarpine but not for adrenaline.", 
    "76": "The modulation of adenylate cyclase by guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and hormones was examined in liver membranes of lean and ob/ob mice, to determine whether a defective regulation of cyclase similar to that found in adipocyte membranes was present. In conjunction with GTP, glucagon was a powerful stimulant of cyclase in both types of membranes. In contrast, GTP alone or in conjunction with isoproterenol and norepinephrine stimulated significantly less in the membranes of the lean than in those of the obese mouse. In addition, low concentrations of norepinephrine elicited an inhibitory response in membranes of the lean mouse, but not in those of the obese. This inhibitory effect of norepinephrine was abolished by the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine and by treatment with pertussis toxin, but not by propranolol or treatment with cholera toxin. These data show that it is possible to demonstrate inhibitory effects of guanine nucleotides on cyclase in the membranes from lean but not those from obese mice and suggest a defect in inhibitory regulation in the tissue of the obese.", 
    "77": "We retrospectively analyzed two studies to determine whether smoking affected the treatment of hypertension. In a study of the effects of propranolol hydrochloride (a hepatically metabolized beta-blocker) vs hydrochlorothiazide, 108 smokers and 232 nonsmokers were randomized to the propranolol treatment group. The propranolol-treated smokers tended to be younger, taller, thinner, and wre more likely to be black. This group also had an initial blood pressure reduction (+/- SD) of -7.9 +/- 12.9/-8.7 +/- 8.4 mm Hg compared with -10.7 +/- 13.0/-10.9 +/- 7.1 mm Hg for the nonsmokers. Blood pressure increased less during the one-year maintenance period for the nonsmokers. However, when analyzed by race, this effect was seen in blacks, but not in whites. Diastolic blood pressure tended to be reduced more in nonsmokers (vs smokers) receiving hydrochlorothiazide (-12.1 +/- 6.7 vs -10.7 +/- 6.7 mm Hg, respectively). The second study compared the effects of nadolol (a renally excreted beta-blocker) with bendroflumethiazide. There were no significant effects on blood pressure for either of these drugs. In both studies, there was a greater tendency for smokers to be terminated from the study irrespective of drug group. We conclude that cigarette smoking does interfere with the treatment of hypertension in general, and especially with reduction of blood pressure by propranolol in black patients.", 
    "78": "In goldfish, microinjections of norepinephrine (NE) into the anterior aspect of the nucleus preopticus periventricularis result in dose-dependent decreases in selected temperature (21). To determine the characteristics of the adrenoceptors involved in this response, noradrenergic antagonists were injected 10 min before an injection of 50 ng norepinephrine. In comparison to control injections, injections of 50 ng phentolamine, an alpha-antagonist, significantly attenuated the effect of NE. In contrast, 50 ng propranolol, a beta-antagonist, produced a nonsignificant attenuation. These antagonists injected by themselves had no thermoregulatory effect. For noradrenergic agonists, thermoregulatory effects comparable to a dose of 10-25 ng NE were obtained at the following doses (in microgram): 1.0 clonidine (alpha 2), 5.0 phenylephrine (alpha 1), and 25 isoproterenol (beta). In fish, both alpha 1 and alpha 2-adrenoceptors appear to subserve the NE-induced decrease in selected temperature. Because antagonists injected by themselves do not have a thermoregulatory effect, NE may not have a role in the short-term regulation of body temperature in fish but rather may modulate this system in response to altered environmental conditions.", 
    "79": "The effects of treatment with L-thyroxine (T4) for 10-12 days on left ventricular (LV) function and myosin isoenzyme content in rats with LV dysfunction after myocardial infarction were studied. Electrocardiogram (ECG) criteria were used to select animals with large myocardial infarctions. These animals were divided into six groups: control and five treatment groups that received daily subcutaneous injections of T4 (1.5, 3, 6, 10, or 15 micrograms/100 g body wt) for 10-12 days. Intravascular pressures were then measured with micromanometer-tipped catheters, and the hearts were analyzed for myosin isoenzyme distribution. The lowest dose of T4 (1.5 micrograms) produced no changes in heart rate, LV pressure or aortic pressure (AoP), myosin isoenzyme composition, or serum T4 levels. Larger doses of T4 (3, 6, 10, and 15 micrograms) produced increases in LV rate of pressure development (dP/dt), heart rate, and T4 levels but did not change LV pressure or AoP. Myosin isoenzyme composition in the control group showed increases in the proportion of the V3 form and decreases in the V1 form compared with the normal pattern. T4 administration produced dose-dependent increases in the V1 myosin isoform and corresponding decreases in the amount of the V2 and V3 forms. Heart rate increases observed with larger doses of T4 could be prevented by addition of propranolol (500 mg/l) to the drinking water. However, in rats treated with T4 and propranolol, LV pressure, AoP, LV dP/dt, and myosin isoenzyme composition were unchanged compared with T4-treated rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
