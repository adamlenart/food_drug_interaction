Recently, it was reported that a Rho kinase inhibitor prevented fibrosis of various tissues and that the Rho/Rho kinase pathway was involved in the renin-angiotensin system of vascular smooth muscle cells. In this study, the involvement of the Rho/Rho kinase pathway on angiotensin II signaling in liver fibrogenesis and generation of steatosis was investigated.",

Liver histology and hepatic stellate cell activation were analyzed. Free radical production was detected by 4-hydroxynonenal and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine immunostaining and the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha was examined. Isolated hepatic stellate cells were pretreated with a Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, or an angiotensin II receptor blocker, CV-11974, and stimulated with angiotensin II, and mRNA expression of transforming growth factor-beta and alpha-smooth muscle actin was analyzed.", 
    "2": "Both the angiotensin II receptor blocker and the Rho kinase inhibitor improved fibrosis and steatosis of the liver in CDAA-fed rats. The increase in the number of hepatocytes positive for 4-hydroxynonenal and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in CDAA-fed rats was significantly prevented by the angiotensin II receptor blocker and the Rho kinase inhibitor. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA in the liver of CDAA-fed rats were significantly increased and this increase was significantly inhibited by treatment with the angiotensin II receptor blocker and the Rho kinase inhibitor. mRNA expression of transforming growth factor-beta and alpha-smooth muscle actin stimulated by angiotensin II was also significantly suppressed by these two drugs.",

    "4": "Despite advances in the treatment of hypertension, control rates continue to be suboptimal in both Europe and the US. Strategies that improve hypertension control are therefore urgently needed. This study aimed to assess the relative efficacies of various antihypertensive drugs commonly used in France in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) by using a meta-analytical approach. This update of a previously published meta-analytical approach extends the number of drugs evaluated from 13 to 19.", 
    "5": "A total of 80 randomised, controlled trials published between 1973 and 2007 involving 10 818 patients were selected for inclusion in the meta-analytical approach. Data were examined for 19 drugs, and 16 drugs were included in the analysis: hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide sustained-release (SR), atenolol, amlodipine, lercanidipine, manidipine, enalapril, ramipril, trandolapril, candesartan cilexetil, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan medoxomil, telmisartan, valsartan and aliskiren. Weighted average reductions in SBP and DBP over a period of 8-12 weeks were calculated for each drug from information on both the mean and the variability in BP reduction. No trials evaluating furosemide, spironolactone or cicletanine satisfied the inclusion criteria for this analysis.", 
    "6": "The average weighted reductions in SBP over 8-12 weeks were most marked with diuretics, and in particular indapamide SR 1.5 mg/day (mean change from baseline -22.2mm Hg), which reduced SBP to a greater extent than any of the other drugs evaluated (at any dosage considered). Average weighted reductions in DBP were generally similar with all classes of antihypertensives and ranged from -11.4mm Hg with the beta-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol and calcium channel antagonists to -10.3mm Hg with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists.", 
    "7": "This new analysis supports the results of the earlier investigation, in that indapamide SR 1.5 mg/day appeared to be the most effective drug for producing significant reductions in SBP within 8-12 weeks, which is an essential element in optimising cardiovascular prevention among hypertensive patients. The clinical application of these results should take into consideration all the limitations discussed in this analysis.", 
    "8": "Tramadol, which inhibits the reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin, is effective in animal models of depression. Its antidepressant-like effects may be mediated mainly by the noradrenergic system. This study investigated the role of the noradrenergic system in the antidepressant-like effects of tramadol and desipramine in the unpredictable chronic mild stress model. We assessed the involvement of beta-adrenoreceptors, particularly beta2-receptors in the activity of these drugs. In addition, we measured the level of noradrenaline and its metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol (MHPG) in the locus coeruleus, hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum in stressed mice. Unpredictable chronic mild stress induced a degradation of coat state and decreased grooming behaviour in the splash test, which was reversed by the chronic administration of tramadol (20 mg/kg) and desipramine (10 mg/kg). The nonselective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and the selective beta2-receptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) reversed the antidepressant-like effects of tramadol and desipramine. Moreover, chronic tramadol and desipramine treatment increased the level of noradrenaline (NA) and MHPG in the locus coeruleus but not in the cerebellum, whereas only MHPG level was increased in the hypothalamus. Tramadol, however, increased the levels of MHPG and NA in the hippocampus, whereas desipramine only increased NA level. These data support the view that the noradrenergic system plays an important role in the antidepressant-like action of tramadol.",

In addition, perindopril significantly reduced aortic root diameters relative to placebo in both end-systole and end-diastole (P<.01 to P < .001 for all comparisons between groups). Although perindopril marginally reduced mean arterial pressure (from 81 [2] mm Hg to 80 [1] mm Hg in perindopril group vs 83 [2] mm Hg to 84 [3] mm Hg in placebo group, P = .004), the observed changes in both stiffness and left ventricular outflow tract diameter remained significant when mean arterial pressure was included as a covariate. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), which contributes to aortic degeneration in Marfan syndrome, was reduced by perindopril compared with placebo in both latent (59 [6] ng/mL to 45 [3] ng/mL in perindopril group, P = .01 vs placebo) and active (46 [2] ng/mL to 42 [1] ng/mL in perindopril group, P = .02 vs placebo) forms.",

    "17": "Differences in energy metabolism during beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (AR) stimulation have been shown to translate to differences in the elicited functional responses. It has been suggested that differential access to glycogen during beta(1)- compared with beta(2)-AR stimulation may influence the peak functional response and modulation of the response during sustained adrenergic stimulation. Interleaved (13)C- and (31)P-NMR spectroscopy was used during beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR stimulation at matched peak workload (2.5 times baseline) in the isolated perfused rat heart to monitor glycogen levels, phosphorylation potential, and intracellular pH. Simultaneous measurements of left ventricular (LV) function [LV developed pressure (LVDP)], heart rate (HR), and rate-pressure product (RPP = LVDP x HR) were also performed. The heart was perfused under both substrate-free (SF) conditions and with exogenous glucose (G). The greater glycogenolysis was observed during beta(1)- than beta(2)-AR stimulation with G (54% vs. 38% reduction, P = 0.006) and SF (92% vs. 79% reduction, P = 0.04) perfusions. The greater beta(1)-AR-mediated glycogenolysis was correlated with greater ability to sustain the initial contractile response. However, with SF perfusion, the duration of this ability was limited: excessive early glycogen depletion caused an earlier decline in LVDP and phosphorylation potential during beta(1)- than beta(2)-AR stimulation. Therefore, endogenous glycogen stores are depleted earlier and to a greater extent, despite a slightly weaker overall inotropic response, during beta(1)- than beta(2)-AR stimulation. These findings are consistent with beta(1)-AR-specific PKA-dependent glycogen phosphorylase kinase signaling.", 
    "18": "Models describing the structural changes mediating Cys loop receptor activation generally give little attention to the possibility that different agonists may promote activation via distinct M2 pore-lining domain structural rearrangements. We investigated this question by comparing the effects of different ligands on the conformation of the external portion of the homomeric alpha1 glycine receptor M2 domain. Conformational flexibility was assessed by tethering a rhodamine fluorophore to cysteines introduced at the 19' or 22' positions and monitoring fluorescence and current changes during channel activation. During glycine activation, fluorescence of the label attached to R19'C increased by approximately 20%, and the emission peak shifted to lower wavelengths, consistent with a more hydrophobic fluorophore environment. In contrast, ivermectin activated the receptors without producing a fluorescence change. Although taurine and beta-alanine were weak partial agonists at the alpha1R19'C glycine receptor, they induced large fluorescence changes. Propofol, which drastically enhanced these currents, did not induce a glycine-like blue shift in the spectral emission peak. The inhibitors strychnine and picrotoxin elicited fluorescence and current changes as expected for a competitive antagonist and an open channel blocker, respectively. Glycine and taurine (or beta-alanine) also produced an increase and a decrease, respectively, in the fluorescence of a label attached to the nearby L22'C residue. Thus, results from two separate labeled residues support the conclusion that the glycine receptor M2 domain responds with distinct conformational changes to activation by different agonists.", 
    "19": "We describe a 58-year-old man who was successfully treated with a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent for intractable hemolysis due to paraprosthetic leakage. After replacement of a mitral prosthetic valve with another mechanical valve, the patient suffered intractable intravascular hemolysis resulting from recurrent paraprosthetic leakage. With oral administration of a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, betaxolol hydrochloride, for 3 months, the hemoglobin value increased from 9.7 g x dL(-1) to 12.4 g x dL(-1), although glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase values remained elevated.", 
    "20": "The effect of alpha(1)- and beta-adrenergic blockade on daily rhythms of urinary adrenalin (ADR) and cortisol (CORT) under basal conditions were evaluated. Voles acclimated to a 12:12 h light/dark cycle at 26+/-2 degrees C received a single dose of either propranolol (PROP; 4.5 mg/kg) or prazosin (PRAZ; 1 mg/kg) 1 h before lights off. Urine samples were collected for 24 h at 4 h intervals. PROP evokes a significant increase in mean urinary ADR; although CORT was unaffected by PROP, PRAZ administration significantly decreased both urinary ADR and CORT during the scotophase as compared with control voles. Cosinor analysis indicated a significant 24 h rhythm in urinary ADR, but not in CORT secretion. ADR mesor and amplitude were increased and acrophase was significantly delayed by 5 h in PROP-treated voles; PRAZ elicited opposite effects. Unexpectedly, these changes in the 24 h ADR rhythm persisted 4-weeks after PROP-treatment. The 24 h rhythm components of urinary CORT were marginally altered 4-weeks post-PROP, but only the acrophase showed a significant change. Collectively, the results indicate that sympathetic activity has a redundant compensatory mechanism defending against physiological changes induced by beta-blockade. The simultaneous decrease in adrenal hormones induced by PRAZ suggests that alpha(1)-adrenoceptors may contribute to the mechanism of integrated stress responses.", 
    "21": "Acute exercise is known for causing considerable changes in leukocyte counts and function. In this paper we report that differentiated changes in T-lymphocyte distribution occur in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs depending on the type and the intensity of exercise. Using fluorescent cell tracking we observed a release of T-cells from the spleen while lung, bone marrow and Peyer's patches served as target organs. The number of T-cells in the blood rose after intensive running while lymphopenia occurred after swimming exercise. Changes in number of labelled T-cells were neither found in the lymph nodes nor in the thymus regardless of exercise protocol. Following an alpha- or beta-blockade, the exercise-induced release of T-cells from the spleen and the accumulation of T-cells in the lung were inhibited while the enhancement of T-cells in the Peyer's patches was not affected. The administration of epinephrine partially mimicked the effects of exercise and resulted in a release of T-cells from both, the spleen and the liver, as well as in an increase of circulating blood T-cells. In conclusion, exercise induces a substantial re-distribution of T-cells within lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. The migrating properties of T-cells could be partially explained by adrenergic mechanisms associated with exercise while the involvement of certain homing receptors remains to be shown. Our results suggest that the accumulation of T-cells in both, lung and Peyer's patches, may enhance the immune vigilance in these compartments which serve as the body's major defence barriers.", 
    "22": "Carvedilol is often used to treat hypertension and for prophylaxis in vascular sclerosis in renal transplant recipients, who require concomitant treatment with ciclosporin. However, there are few reports regarding the pharmacokinetic interactions between carvedilol and ciclosporin. We have investigated the potential effects of carvedilol on the pharmacokinetics of ciclosporin, and examined the inhibitory effects of carvedilol on P-glycoprotein-mediated transcellular transport using Caco2 cells. Ciclosporin alone or with carvedilol was orally or intravenously administered to rats. The oral administration of carvedilol (10 mg kg(-1)) with ciclosporin (10 mg kg(-1)) increased the whole blood concentration of ciclosporin. When ciclosporin (3 mg kg(-1)) was intravenously administered with carvedilol (3 mg kg(-1)), there was no difference in the whole blood ciclosporin concentration between administration with and without carvedilol. Co-administration with carvedilol increased ciclosporin bioavailability from 33% to 70%. In Caco2 cells, carvedilol caused a concentration-dependent increase in the intracellular accumulation of ciclosporin, and its effect was comparable with that of verapamil. Carvedilol considerably raised the concentration of ciclosporin in the blood and this interaction was associated with the absorption phase of ciclosporin. This interaction was caused by the inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated transport by carvedilol in the intestine.",

With the recent introduction of dual-source computedtomography (DSCT), the increased temporal resolution of 83 ms should also improve the assessment of cardiac function in CT. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of DSCT in the assessment of left ventricular functional parameters with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as standard of reference. Fifteen patients (two female, 13 male; mean age 50.8 +/- 19.2 years) underwent CT and MRI examinations on a DSCT (Somatom Definition; Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany) and a 3.0-Tesla MR scanner (Magnetom Trio; Siemens Medical Solutions), respectively. Multiphase axial CT images were analysed with a semiautomatic region growing algorithms (Syngo Circulation; Siemens Medical Solutions) by two independent blinded observers. In MRI, dynamic cine loops of short axis slices were evaluated with semiautomatic contour detection software (ARGUS; Siemens Medical Solutions) independently by two readers. End-systolic volume (ESV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), ejection fraction (EF) and stroke volume (SV) were determined for both modalities, and correlation coefficient, systematic error, limits of agreement and inter-observer variability were assessed. In DSCT, EDV and ESV were 135.8 +/- 41.9 ml and 54.9 +/- 29.6 ml, respectively, compared with 132.1 +/- 40.8 ml EDV and 57.6 +/- 27.3 ml ESV in MRI. Thus, EDV was overestimated by 3.7 ml (limits of agreement -46.1/+53.6), while ESV was underestimated by 2.6 ml (-36.6/+31.4). Mean EF was 61.6 +/- 12.4% in DSCT and 57.9 +/- 9.0% in MRI, resulting in an overestimation of EF by 3.8% with limits of agreement at -14.7 and +22.2%. Rank correlation rho values were 0.81 for EDV (P = 0.0024), 0.79 for ESV (P = 0.0031) and 0.64 for EF (P = 0.0168). The kappa value of inter-observer variability were amounted to 0.85 for EDV, ESV and EF. DSCT offers the possibility to quantify left ventricular function from coronary CT angiography datasets with sufficient diagnostic accuracy, adding to the value of the modality in a comprehensive cardiac assessment. The observed differences in the measured values may be due to different post-processing methods and physiological reactions to contrast material injection without beta-blocker medication.",

    "74": "Despite a decade of successful clinical trials for stroke prevention, substantial gaps exist in the application and implementation of this information in community practice. The frequency of guideline use is low, and there remains controversy regarding the standard of practice. Patients with stroke may have multiple risk factors and concomitant stroke mechanisms, factors that are not addressed in stroke clinical trials and guideline statements. New guidelines are needed to account for these complexities and to provide primary care physicians a practical means to achieve stroke prevention. We sought to develop guidelines that can be implemented by primary care physicians to enhance the use of medical and surgical measures for recurrent stroke prevention. We sought to test the applicability of current evidence-based guidelines to daily practice with routine and complex patient case scenarios to determine whether these could be simplified into a more easily applied form for primary care physicians. We used RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Methodology to develop guidelines for the use of interventions supported by randomized controlled trials including carotid revascularization, anticoagulant therapy, antiplatelet therapy, and blood pressure management for the prevention of recurrent stroke. After a systematic literature review of randomized clinical trials we developed a comprehensive list of indications or clinical scenarios to capture decision making. A diverse multidisciplinary panel reviewed and rated each indication according to the RAND Appropriateness Method. First, panelists rated each scenario (1-3 for inappropriate, 4-6 for uncertain, and 7-9 for appropriate) without interaction with other panelists. \"Appropriate\" was defined as the expected health benefit exceeding its expected negative consequences by a sufficient margin. At a formal interactive session, panelists re-rated all indications. Overall carotid endarterectomy was rated as appropriate when there was 50% to 99% ipsilateral symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, inappropriate with <50% or 100% stenosis (total occlusion), and uncertain when the surgical risk was high. Carotid angioplasty was generally rated as of uncertain value. When there was atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation with warfarin was rated as appropriate when there was a low bleeding risk but of uncertain value when the bleeding risk was high. For patients who were not candidates for warfarin therapy, aspirin, aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole, or clopidogrel were all rated as appropriate initial therapies. Ticlopidine was considered inappropriate and aspirin plus clopidogrel of uncertain value. With the exception of ticlopidine and aspirin, persons with a prior cerebral ischemic event while on aspirin could receive any of the aforementioned antiplatelet agents or combinations and be considered appropriately treated. The panelists rated a blood pressure of <130/80 mm Hg at 1 year after ischemic stroke as the target level and rated any of the following agents as appropriate initial therapies if there was no diabetes mellitus or proteinuria: diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor blockers, or combinations of a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Patient risk played a significant role in deterring the panel from recommending certain therapies; however, the presence of atrial fibrillation or large or small cerebral vessel syndromes rarely had significant influence on treatment decisions. Appropriateness was less where bleeding or surgical risk was excessive. Using consensus evidence from clinical trials, we have developed recurrent stroke prevention guidelines for routine and more complex patient scenarios according to appropriateness methodology. Broad application of these guidelines in primary practice promises to reduce the burden of recurrent stroke.",

    "80": "The presented paper deals with a new methodology for direct determination of propranolol in human plasma. The methodology described is based on sequential injection analysis technique (SIA) coupled with solid phase extraction (SPE) column based on restricted access materials (RAM). Special RAM column containing 30 microm polymeric material-N-vinylacetamide copolymer was integrated into the sequential injection manifold. SIA-RAM system was used for selective retention of propranolol, while the plasma matrix components were eluted with two weak organic solutions to waste. Due to the acid-basic and polarity properties of propranolol molecule and principles of reversed-phase chromatography, it was possible to retain propranolol on the N-vinylacetamide copolymer sorbent (Shodex MSpak PK-2A 30 microm (2 mm x 10 mm)). Centrifuged plasma samples were aspirated into the system and loaded onto the column using acetonitrile-water (5:95, v/v), pH 11.00, adjusted by triethylamine. The analyte was retained on the column while proteins contained in the sample were removed to waste. Interfering endogenous substances complicating detection were washed out by acetonitrile-water (15:85), pH 11.00 in the next step. The extracted analyte was eluted by means of tetrahydrofuran-water (25:75), pH 11.00 to the fluorescence detector (emission filter 385 nm). The whole procedure comprising sample pre-treatment, analyte detection and column reconditioning took about 15 min. The recoveries of propranolol from undiluted plasma were in the range 96.2-97.8% for three concentration levels of analyte. The proposed SIA-RAM method has been applied for direct determination of propranolol in human plasma.", 
    "81": "Recently, various clinical studies have indicated that lipophilic beta-blockers reduce the coronary mortality in diabetic patients; however, systematic studies have not been reported. The objective of the present investigation was to compare the effects of chronic treatment with metoprolol and atenolol on cardiovascular complications in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Injection of STZ produced hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, increased blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, reduction in heart rate, and structural alterations in cardiac tissues. Metoprolol and atenolol effectively prevented the development of hypertension in diabetic rats. Metoprolol treatment produced a slight but significant reduction in serum glucose levels with elevation in serum insulin levels, while atenolol produced a slight increase in glucose levels but no effect on insulin levels. Moreover, neither metoprolol nor atenolol treatment reduced the elevated cholesterol levels in diabetic rats. Metoprolol treatment significantly prevented STZ-induced increase in triglyceride levels, but atenolol failed to produce this effect. Metoprolol exhibited a minimal improvement in STZ-induced bradycardia, whereas atenolol produced a further reduction in heart rate. Histological examination showed metoprolol treatment also prevented STZ-induced hypertrophy and some of the alterations in cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, our data suggest that metoprolol has some beneficial effects over atenolol with respect to cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes mellitus.", 
    "82": "Study of the chronobiology of allergic rhinitis (AR) and bronchial asthma (BA) and the chronopharmacology and chronotherapy of the medications used in their treatment began five decades ago. AR is an inflammatory disease of the upper airway tissue with hypersensitivity to specific environmental antigens, resulting in further local inflammation, vasomotor changes, and mucus hypersecretion. Symptoms include sneezing, nasal congestion, and runny and itchy nose. Approximately 25% of children and 40% of adults in USA are affected by AR during one or more seasons of the year. The manifestation and severity of AR symptoms exhibit prominent 24-h variation; in most persons they are worse overnight or early in the morning and often comprise nighttime sleep, resulting in poor daytime quality of life, compromised school and work performance, and irritability and moodiness. BA is also an inflammatory medical condition of the lower airways characterized by hypersensitivity to specific environmental antigens, resulting in greater local inflammation as well as bronchoconstriction, vasomotor change, and mucus hypersecretion. In USA an estimated 6.5 million children and 15.7 million adults have BA. The onset and worsening of BA are signaled by chest wheeze and/or croupy cough and difficult and labored breathing. Like AR, BA is primarily a nighttime medical condition. AR is treated with H1-antagonist, decongestant, and anti-inflammatory (glucocorticoid and leukotriene receptor antagonist and modifier) medications. Only H1-antagonist AR medications have been studied for their chronopharmacology and potential chronotherapy. BA is treated with some of the same medications and also theophylline and beta2-agonists. The chronopharmacology and chronotherapy of many classes of BA medications have been explored. This article reviews the rather extensive knowledge of the chronobiology of AR and BA and the chronopharmacology and chronotherapy of the various medications used in their treatment.", 
    "83": "Class I recommendations for treating patients with current or prior symptoms of heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) include using diuretics and salt restriction in individuals with fluid retention. Use angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers if intolerant to ACE inhibitors because of cough or angioneurotic edema. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, most antiarrhythmic drugs, and calcium channel blockers should be avoided or withdrawn. Exercise training is recommended. Implant cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended in individuals with a history of cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, or hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia. ICD is indicated in patients with ischemic heart disease for at least 40 d post-myocardial infarction or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, an LVEF of 30% or less, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III symptoms on optimal medical therapy, and an expectation of survival of at least 1 yr. Cardiac resynchronization therapy should be used in individuals with an LVEF of 35% or below, NYHA class III or IV symptoms despite optimal therapy, and a QRS duration greater than 120 ms. An aldosterone antagonist can be added in selected patients with moderately severe to severe symptoms of heart failure who can be carefully monitored for renal function and potassium concentration (serum creatinine should be <or=2.5 mg/dL in men and <or=2.0 mg/dL in women; serum potassium should be <5.0 mEq/L).",

    "88": "Cholinergic neurons in the parabigeminal nucleus of the rat midbrain were studied in an acute slice preparation. Spontaneous, regular action potentials were observed both with cell-attached patch recordings as well as with whole cell current-clamp recordings. The spontaneous activity of parabigeminal nucleus (PBN) neurons was not due to synaptic input as it persisted in the presence of the pan-ionotropic excitatory neurotransmitter receptor blocker, kynurenic acid, and the cholinergic blockers dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE) and atropine. This result suggests the existence of intrinsic currents that enable spontaneous activity. In voltage-clamp recordings, I(H) and I(A) currents were observed in most PBN neurons. I(A) had voltage-dependent features that would permit it to contribute to spontaneous firing. In contrast, I(H) was significantly activated at membrane potentials lower than the trough of the spike afterhyperpolarization, suggesting that I(H) does not contribute to spontaneous firing of PBN neurons. Consistent with this interpretation, application of 25 microM ZD-7288, which blocked I(H), did not affect the rate of spontaneous firing in PBN neurons. Counterparts to I(A) and I(H) were observed in current-clamp recordings: I(A) was reflected as a slow voltage ramp observed between action potentials and on release from hyperpolarization, and I(H) was reflected as a depolarizing sag often accompanied by rebound spikes in response to hyperpolarizing current injections. In response to depolarizing current injections, PBN neurons fired at high frequencies, with relatively little accommodation. Ultimately, the spontaneous activity in PBN neurons could be used to modulate cholinergic drive in the superior colliculus in either positive or negative directions.", 
    "89": "Although organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus are highly compartmentalized, these organelles are interconnected through a network of vesicular trafficking. The marine sponge metabolite ilimaquinone (IQ) is known to induce Golgi membrane fragmentation and is widely used to study the mechanism of vesicular trafficking. Although IQ treatment causes protein kinase D (PKD) activation, the detailed mechanism of IQ-induced Golgi membrane fragmentation remains unclear. In this work, we found that IQ treatment of cells caused a robust activation of phospholipase D (PLD). In the presence of 1-butanol but not 2-butanol, IQ-induced Golgi membrane fragmentation was completely blocked. In addition, IQ failed to induce Golgi membrane fragmentation in PLD knock-out DT40 cells. Furthermore, IQ-induced PKD activation was completely blocked by treatment with either 1-butanol or propranolol. Notably, IQ-induced Golgi membrane fragmentation was also blocked by propranolol treatment. These results indicate that PLD-catalyzed formation of phosphatidic acid is a prerequisite for IQ-induced Golgi membrane fragmentation and that enzymatic conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol is necessary for subsequent activation of PKD and IQ-induced Golgi membrane fragmentation.",

Several studies suggest that therapeutic agents for the treatment of CHF, particularly angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, are underused in end-stage renal disease patients with CHF. Although limited data are available, growing evidence suggests that therapeutic agents for CHF improve survival and are safe to use, assuming close monitoring of adverse events. The reluctance of physicians in prescribing these therapeutic agents and the reasons underlying the inconsistent use of these agents in the dialysis population need to be addressed.",

However, whether in-treatment resolution or continued absence of electrocardiographic hypertrophy is independently associated with decreased incidence of diabetes is unclear. Electrocardiographic hypertrophy was evaluated over time in 7998 hypertensive patients without diabetes at baseline in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study who were treated with losartan- or atenolol-based regimens and followed with serial electrocardiograms and blood pressure determinations. Electrocardiographic hypertrophy was defined using gender-adjusted Cornell voltage-duration product criteria >2440 mm.ms. During mean follow-up of 4.6+/-1.2 years, diabetes developed in 562 patients (7.0%). In a Cox model adjusting for treatment assignment, in-treatment resolution or continued absence of Cornell product hypertrophy was associated with a 38% lower risk of new diabetes (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.78). After adjusting for the association of new diabetes with prior antihypertensive treatment, baseline glucose, and Framingham risk score, baseline and in-treatment systolic and diastolic pressure, HDL, uric acid, and body mass index, and the decreased incidence associated with losartan-based therapy, in-treatment continued absence, or resolution of Cornell product hypertrophy remained associated with a 26% lower risk of new diabetes (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.93).

The Self-emulsifying osmotic pump tablet (SEOPT) has two outstanding features. It could improve the bioavailability of carvedilol by self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS), control the release rate and make the plasma concentrations more stable by elementary osmotic pump tablet. The results of transmission electron microscope (TEM) and particle size assessment showed that the shape of the resultant emulsion was round and regular, the average diameter of the particles was 246 nm. Since the solubility of carvedilol was improved by the emulsion, the elementary SEOPT could guarantee a complete release of carvedilol under the osmotic pressure of mannitol. The cumulative release at 12 hr was 85.18%. Therefore the disadvantage that lipophilic drugs can not be released completely when prepared into elementary osmotic pump tablet was resolved. The results of Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray diffraction diffraction (XRD) proved that carvedilol was amorphous in the preparation. The relative bioavailability of carvedilol in beagle dogs was 156.78%. The plasma concentrations were more stable compared with that of commercially available tablet (Luode). And the in vitro and in vivo correlation was good (r = 0.9725). Therefore, the elementary SEOPT developed in this paper might provide a new idea for preparing lipophilic drugs into osmotic pump tablet conveniently.",

In this study, we compared the reactive rise in blood pressure induced by cuff inflation when the cuff was placed at the upper arm level and at the wrist.", 
    "111": "The reactive rise in systolic and diastolic blood pressure to cuff inflation was measured in 34 normotensive participants and 34 hypertensive patients. Each participant was equipped with two cuffs, one around the right upper arm (OMRON HEM-CR19, 22-32 cm) and one around the right wrist (OMRON HEM-CS 19, 17-22 cm; Omron Health Care Europe BV, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands). The cuffs were inflated in a double random order (maximal cuff pressure and position of the cuff) with two maximal cuff pressures: 180 and 240 mmHg. The cuffs were linked to an oscillometric device (OMRON HEM 907; Omron Health Care). Simultaneously, blood pressure was measured continuously at the middle finger of the left hand using photoplethysmography. Three measurements were made at each level of blood pressure at the arm and at the wrist, and the sequence of measurements was randomized.", 
    "112": "In normotensive participants, no significant difference was observed in the reactive rise in blood pressure when the cuff was inflated either at the arm or at the wrist irrespective of the level of cuff inflation. Inflating a cuff at the arm, however, induced a significantly greater rise in blood pressure than inflating it at the wrist in hypertensive participants for both systolic and diastolic pressures (P<0.01), and at both levels of cuff inflation. The blood pressure response to cuff inflation was independent of baseline blood pressure.", 
    "113": "The results show that in hypertensive patients, cuff inflation at the wrist produces a smaller reactive rise in blood pressure. The difference between the arm and the wrist is independent of the patient's level of blood pressure.",

Laboratory studies showed elevated thyroid hormone, decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone, and hypokalemia. Rapid reduction in thyroid hormone levels by giving antithyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil and prompt potassium therapy with frequent measurements of serum potassium levels during therapy to avoid catastrophic hyperkalemia when potassium starts to shift back from intracellular to extracellular compartments can lead to successful outcome.",

All patients had standardized cataract surgery with PPCCC and IOL implantation in the capsular bag followed by a postoperative dose of a fixed dorzolamide-timolol combination. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an ACR6D SE IOL (Laboratoires Corn\u00e9al) in 1 eye and a Centerflex (C-flex) 570C IOL (Rayner Surgical GmbH) in the contralateral eye. The IOP was measured at baseline and postoperatively at 6 and 24 hours as well as 1 week.",

Our goals were to investigate the effects of familial aggregation and behavioral factors on the change in BMD during a 5-yr follow-up. Subjects (n=140) were 70 exposure-discordant monozygotic twin pairs (age 35-69 yr). BMD was measured with the same dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner at baseline and at the 5-yr follow-up. A variety of covariates were used including physical examination and interview data. Multivariate linear regression was used. The mean annual decrease in femoral BMD was 0.2%. The mean lumbar BMD was unchanged, although 8-17% of subjects had a decrease of more than 5%. Familial aggregation explained 14% of the changes in femoral BMD and 19% in lumbar BMD. The stability of BMD in the follow-up was high, both for individuals (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.90-0.94) and for co-twins in a pair (ICC=0.77-0.84). In femoral BMD, use of alcohol (p=0.006), coffee (p=0.046), and beta-blockers (p=0.043) led to increases, whereas smoking led to a decrease (p<0.01). We concluded that frequent increases in BMD, influenced by beta-blockers, partly explain the minor mean changes during follow-up; however, about every 10th subject had a significant decrease. Overall, familial effects played a dominant role in BMD changes in adult men.",

All these alterations were diminished in SHR + AT (P < 0.01). SHR + RAM presented differences with respect to SHR + AT in the reduction of these variables. TGFbeta(1) expression in the vessel wall from the clitoris and collagen I and III deposition in the interstitium from the clitoris in untreated SHR were significantly more (P < 0.01) than in WKY. While SHR + AT showed a mild decrease in these variables, SHR + RAM presented a significant reduction (P < 0.01) in TGFbeta(1) expression interstitial fibrosis and in both types of collagens.

Therefore, we tested naming in a pilot study of chronic Broca's aphasia patients with anomia after propranolol and after placebo in a double-blinded crossover manner. Naming was better after propranolol than after placebo, suggesting a potential benefit from propranolol in chronic Broca's aphasia with anomia.

In group 1, ejection fraction and left ventricular end-diastolic volume normalised, and interventricular septum thickness increased. No remodelling occurred in group 2. In group 3, interventricular septum thickness was unchanged, ejection fraction and left ventricular end-diastolic volume improved. Also autonomic modulation differed. At baseline, adrenergic activation was observed either at rest or during standing. After carvedilol treatment, group 1 did not show any change in the low frequency/high frequency ratio in both conditions, whereas groups 2 and 3 showed reduced adrenergic activation at rest and normal response to standing.",

    "141": "Apart from gating by interaction with betagamma subunits from heterotrimeric G proteins upon stimulation of appropriate receptors, Kir.3 channels have been shown to be gated by intracellular Na+. However, no information is available on how Na+-dependent gating affects endogenous Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channels in mammalian atrial myocytes. We therefore studied how loading of adult atrial myocytes from rat hearts via the patch pipette filling solution with different concentrations of Na+ ([Na+]pip) affects Kir3 current. Surprisingly, in a range between 0 and 60 mm, Na+ neither had an effect on basal inward-rectifier current nor on the current activated by acetylcholine. Overexpression of Kir3.4 in adult atrial myocytes forced by adenoviral gene transfer results in formation of functional homomeric channels that interact with betagamma subunits upon activation of endogenous muscarinic receptors. These channels are activated at [Na+]pip >or= 15 mm, resulting in a receptor-independent basal inward rectifier current (I bir). I bir was neither affected by pertussis toxin nor by GDP-beta-S, suggesting G-protein-independent activation. PIP(2) depletion via endogenous PLC-coupled alpha1 adrenergic receptors causes inhibition of endogenous Kir3.1/3.4 channel currents by about 75%. In contrast, inhibition of Na+-activated I bir amounts to < 20%. The effect of the Kir3 channel blocker tertiapin-Q can be described using an IC50 of 12 nm (endogenous I K(ACh)) and 0.61 nm (I bir). These data clearly identify I bir as a homotetrameric Kir3.4 channel current with novel properties of regulation and pharmacology. Ibir shares some properties with a basal current recently described in atrial myocytes from an animal model of atrial fibrillation (AF) and AF patients.", 
    "142": "Guidelines for post-myocardial infarction (MI) management emphasize treatment with statins, beta blockers (BBs), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Little is known about the temporal trends and racial differences in such use after discharge. This study assessed temporal trends and racial differences in the use of statins, BBs, and ACEIs or ARBs after MI discharge in community-dwelling seniors. Administrative data from pharmacy assistance programs and Medicare in 2 states (1995 to 2004) were used to identify all patients hospitalized for MI who survived > or =90 days after discharge. Age, gender, race, co-morbidities, and MI-specific procedures during hospitalization were assessed. The study outcomes were filled prescriptions for any statin, BB, or ACEI or ARB <90 days after discharge. Multivariate regression was used for trend and racial difference analyses. Of 19,368 patients identified, 6,577 (34.0%) filled prescriptions for statins, 12,387 (64.0%) for BBs, and 9,934 (51.3%) for ACEIs or ARBs <90 days after MI discharge. The use of these drugs increased from 1995 to 2004, most steeply for statins (11% to 61%), less so for BBs (47% to 80%), and least for ACEIs or ARBs (46% to 58%) (all p for trend <0.001). Black patients were 14% and 5% less likely to receive statins and BBs, respectively (all p <0.05). No evidence of an interaction between race and time trend was found. In conclusion, the use of cardiovascular medications after discharge from MI hospitalization in older patients may still be inadequate but has increased over time. The underuse of statins and BBs was marked in black patients and did not improve over time.",

    "144": "Previous research suggests that the noradrenergic system modulates certain types of cognitive flexibility. This study compared various doses of beta-adrenergic antagonists for their effect on cognitive flexibility in problem solving, and how task difficulty interacts with this effect, as well as the effect of beta-adrenergic antagonists on other tasks. Anagram task performance was compared in 72 subjects using a within-subject design for propranolol at 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and placebo in a double-blinded manner, and the effects of subject ability and task difficulty were examined. We also examined the effect of the 40 mg propranolol dose on a range of other tasks. Overall, more anagram problems were solved while on propranolol 40 mg than on placebo. Subjects least able to solve the problems benefited significantly from 40 mg of propranolol. Also, for all subjects the most difficult problems were solved more quickly with propranolol 40 mg than placebo. Benefits were also seen for word fluency and backward digit span. Therefore, noradrenergic modulation of cognitive flexibility is affected by how much difficulty the subject is encountering when searching for the solution, a pattern consistent with what might be expected in an effect on the search of the semantic and associative network.", 
    "145": "The management of hypertension continues to pose important challenges. Recent developments have established the importance of more rigorous blood pressure control in the community. In the perioperative setting, hypertension has long been recognised as undesirable, although the adverse impact of high blood pressure on the acute risks of elective surgery may have been previously overstated.A number of agents and techniques are available to control blood pressure perioperatively. These include principally general and regional anaesthetics, alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, peripheral alpha(1)- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, dopamine D(1A)-receptor agonists (fenoldopam), and nitric oxide donors. Recent years have seen important developments in the receptor selectivity of new compounds and in pharmacokinetics, particularly esterase metabolism. The future study of genomics may enable us to identify patients at risk for hypertension-related adverse events and target therapies most effectively to these high-risk groups.", 
    "146": "Sepsis is accompanied by an enormous increase in catecholamine expression, leading to metabolism of lipids and glucose, changes in cardiovascular output, immunomodulatory effects, and changes in protein metabolism, all of which push the body into a catabolic state. Deleterious beta-adrenoceptor controlled responses to stress and sepsis are well documented; therefore, it would seem appropriate to use propranolol under such circumstances. There are arguments both for and against the use of beta-adrenoceptor blockade during episodes of stress and infection. The definition of sepsis itself is a clinical one in most cases. There are guidelines concerning the diagnosis of sepsis (systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS] in the presence of significant infection). However, when the cause of SIRS is not infection, for example, in burn patients, is it not possible, and indeed preferable, to tackle the stress response in a more aggressive fashion? The effects of SIRS on the body are myriad and have been defined and illustrated in many fine reviews. The effects of sepsis on the body, as well, have been discussed in the world literature and are beyond the scope of this article. In this article we attempt to demonstrate the effects of sepsis (SIRS plus infection) on whole body metabolism, outline the mediators of these changes, and then show the ability of propranolol to attenuate the changes seen.",

The metabolic changes seen in critical illness are highly complex, and how and when to treat them are only just beginning to be determined. Studies have demonstrated that the acute phase and the later phase of critical illness behave differently from a metabolic point of view for many organs, and while many of the alterations in metabolism seen during early critical illness may be appropriate and beneficial responses to cellular stress, whether this is true for all the metabolic alterations in all forms of critical illness is unclear. Currently we face more questions than answers, and further study is needed to elucidate the various components of the metabolic response to acute and chronic critical illness and to develop better techniques to assess and monitor these changes so that we can determine which therapeutic approaches should be used in what combinations and in which patients.",

She was twice treated with oral cyclophosphamide and received antihypertensive treatment with atenolol and enalapril. After 3 years without any control or therapy, she presented in a reduced general condition with hypertensive crisis and a blood pressure of 220/130 mmHg, headache, vomiting and loss of vision. Additionally, renal insufficiency (creatinine 11.4 mg/dl, urea 157 mg/dl), with oliguria, anaemia and a severe relapse of nephrotic syndrome, was present. Initial treatment with steroids, albumin-furosemide infusions and antihypertensive drugs was unsuccessful, and dialysis treatment was necessary. Renal biopsy showed an advanced stage of the known FSGS and, surprisingly, a thrombotic microangiopathy. Further diagnostic investigations revealed no signs of haemolytic-uraemic syndrome, but echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy, and hypertensive retinopathy grade 3 was diagnosed, making severe hypertension the most likely reason for the thrombotic microangiopathy. While adequate antihypertensive treatment led to regress of left ventricular hypertrophy and hypertensive retinopathy, renal function did not recover, and the patient remained dialysis-dependent. In conclusion, severe hypertension in chronic kidney disease can lead to target organ damage and thrombotic microangiopathy, which may further worsen renal function.", 
    "153": "Beta-blockers are known to improve postoperative outcome after major vascular surgery. We studied the effects of beta-blockers in 2126 vascular surgery patients with and without kidney disease followed for 14 years. Creatinine clearance was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, and kidney function was categorized as Stage 1 for a reference group of 550 patients, Stage 2 with 808 patients, Stage 3 with 627 patients, and combined Stages 4 and 5 with 141 patients. Outcome measures were 30-day and long-term all-cause mortality with a mean follow-up of 6 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to control cardiovascular risk factors, including propensity for beta-blocker use. In all, 129 (6%) and 1190 (56%) patients died respectively. Mortality rates were three- and two-fold higher, respectively, for patients at Stages 3-5 compared to the reference group for the two outcomes. beta-Blocker use was significantly associated with a lower risk of mortality after surgery. The overall adjusted hazard ratio was 0.35 and 0.62, respectively, for individuals at Stages 3-5 compared to the reference group for 30-day and long-term mortality. This study shows that kidney function is a predictor of all-cause mortality and beta-blocker use is associated with a lower risk of death in kidney disease patients undergoing elective vascular surgery.", 
    "154": "Psychosocial stress might increase the risk of atherothrombotic events by setting off an elevation in circulating levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6. We investigated the effect of aspirin and propranolol on the responsiveness of plasma IL-6 levels to acute psychosocial stress. For 5 days, 64 healthy subjects were randomized, double-blind, to daily oral aspirin 100mg plus long-acting propranolol 80 mg, aspirin 100mg plus placebo, long-acting propranolol 80 mg plus placebo, or placebo plus placebo. Thereafter, all subjects underwent the 13-min Trier Social Stress Test, which combines a preparation phase, a job interview, and a mental arithmetic task. Plasma IL-6 levels were measured in blood samples collected immediately pre- and post-stress, and 45 min and 105 min thereafter. The change in IL-6 from pre-stress to 105 min post-stress differed between subjects with aspirin medication and those without (p =0.033; eta p2=0.059). IL-6 levels increased less from pre-stress to 105 min post-stress (p <0.027) and were lower (p =0.010) at 105 min post-stress in subjects with aspirin than in subjects without aspirin. The significance of these results was maintained when controlling for gender, age, waist-to-hip ratio, mean arterial blood pressure, and smoking status. Medication with propranolol was not significantly associated with the stress-induced change in IL-6 levels. Also, aspirin and propranolol did not significantly interact in determining the IL-6 stress response. Aspirin but not propranolol attenuated the stress-induced increase in plasma IL-6 levels. This suggests one mechanism by which aspirin treatment might reduce the risk of atherothrombotic events triggered by acute mental stress.", 
    "155": "1. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreceptor activation on myocardial contractility in an anaesthetic-free decerebrated rat preparation. 2. In the decerebrated and retrogradely perfused working heart-brainstem preparation, we recorded phrenic nerve activity, left ventricular (LV) pressure (microtip Millar catheter), LV dP/dT, heart rate and aortic perfusion pressure before and after activating peripheral chemoreceptors with bolus intra-arterial injections of KCN. 3. Without cardiac pacing, chemoreflex activation caused falls in heart rate (-108 +/- 21 b.p.m.) and complex polyphasic changes in LV pressure and LV dP/dT. If the heart was paced, chemoreflex activation caused significant rises in LP pressure (+16 +/- 3 mmHg) and LV dP/dt (+778 +/- 93 mmHg/s). These positive inotropic effects were significantly and substantially attenuated by beta-adrenoceptor blockade with atenolol. In all instances, chemoreflex activation elicited potent tachypnoeic responses. 4. In conclusion, activation of peripheral chemoreceptors in non-anaesthetized rats evokes a positive inotropic response that is sympathetically mediated. This observation may be relevant for the evaluation of neurally induced effects of acute hypoxia on the ventricular myocardium.", 
    "156": "Gut motility is modulated by adrenergic mechanisms. The aim of our study was to examine mechanisms of selective adrenergic receptors in rat jejunum. Spontaneous contractile activity of longitudinal muscle strips from rat jejunum was measured in 5-ml tissue chambers. Dose-responses (six doses, 10(-7) -3 x 10(-5)M) to norepinephrine (NE, nonspecific), phenylephrine (PH, alpha1), clonidine (C, alpha2), prenalterol (PR, beta1), ritodrine (RI, beta2), and ZD7714 (ZD, beta3) were evaluated with and without tetrodotoxin (TTX, nerve blocker). NE(3 x 10(-5)M) inhibited 74 +/- 5% (mean +/- SEM) of spontaneous activity. This was the maximum effect. The same dose of RI(beta2), PH(alpha1), or ZD(beta(3)) resulted in an inhibition of only 56 +/- 5, 43 +/- 4, 33 +/- 6, respectively. The calculated concentration to induce 50% inhibition (EC50) of ZD(beta3) was similar to NE, whereas higher concentrations of PH(alpha1) or RI(beta2) were required. C(alpha2) and PR(beta1) had no effect. TTX changed exclusively the EC50 of RI from 4.4 +/- 0.2 to 2.7 +/- 0.8% (p < 0.04). Contractility was inhibited by NE (nonspecific). PH(alpha1), RI(beta2), and ZD(beta3) mimic the effect of NE. TTX reduced the inhibition by RI. Our results suggest that muscular alpha1, beta2, and beta3 receptor mechanisms mediate adrenergic inhibition of contractility in rat jejunum. beta2 mechanisms seem to involve also neural pathways.",

    "158": "The electrophysiologic actions of the class III antiarrhythmic agents, GLG-V-13 and d,l-sotalol, were examined in superfused normal and ischemically injured epicardium. Both drugs produced concentration and reverse-use dependent prolongation of the action potential duration in normal myocardium without altering resting potential, action potential amplitude, or Vmax. Both drugs increased the slope of restitution curves in normal epicardium but prevented action potential alternans at short cycle lengths. The response of superfused ischemically injured left ventricular epicardium to drug 4 days after coronary artery ligation was determined by the extent of ischemic injury, with no electrophysiologic changes produced within epicardial cells characterized by prominent action potential shortening and no further action potential shortening with pacing. Cells demonstrating less severe injury (as evidenced by less severely depressed action potential amplitudes, Vmax, and action potential durations) retained a limited ability to respond to drug administration with action potential prolongation. A concentration-dependent, increased disparity of action potential duration was observed concurrent with the ability of single premature stimuli to induce monomorphic tachycardia. The present data demonstrate a variable response of ischemically injured canine epicardial cells to action potential prolongation with GLG-V-13 and d,l-sotalol, facilitating localized reentry in vitro, despite a failure of the same drugs to facilitate reentrant tachycardia in vivo.", 
    "159": "Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are now the mainstay of therapy in patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation, resuscitated sudden cardiac death, or certain high-risk markers for these arrhythmic events. Although ICDs in such patients can be life-saving, they can impair quality of life when painful or frequent discharges occur or when residual VT symptoms recur prior to delivery of ICD therapies. As such, antiarrhythmic drugs often are employed in an attempt to reduce the triggering tachyarrhythmic events. Recently, studies with beta-blockers, sotalol, amiodarone, and the investigational agent azimilide have been performed to objectify the efficacy, benefits, or risks of such therapies when administered to patients with ICDs. This review describes the considerations important to the use of these therapies in ICD patients and the results and applicability of these investigative studies.", 
    "160": "Last studies have shown unsatisfactory diagnosis and treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. The aim of this study was to compare the knowledge of primary care physicians (PCP), cardiologists from cardiology clinics (CARC), internal and cardiology department physicians (INTD and CARD) about CHF diagnosis and treatment.", 
    "161": "A questionnaire consisting of 23 questions related to above issues was filled out by 153 physicians (64 PCP, 24 CARC, 44 INTD and 21 CARD) from the urban district. Similarly to other physicians, PCP suspected CHF on the ground of ankle oedema (88%), dyspnoea (75%) and basal pulmonary crepitations (44%). Most questioned doctors ordered a chest X-ray (58-86%) to establish the diagnosis. Echocardiography was underused by PCP (19%) in comparison to other doctors (68-86%). Under-utilization of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (-68 to -79%; NS) and, especially, beta-blockers (-35% by PCP to -51% by CARD; p < 0.05) was observed. The recommended target dose of enalapril knew more CARD (52%) and INTD (45%) than PCP (25%) (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). The appropriate target dose of carvedilol knew 3% of PCP, 8% of CARC, 9% of INTD and 14% of CARD (PCP vs. CARD; p < 0.01).", 
    "162": "Most CHF patients from the urban region are diagnosed by PCP and other doctors on the basis of symptoms, signs and a chest X-ray. The misdiagnosis of CHF may depend on the small direct access of PCP to echocardiography. Under-utilization and under-dosing of ACEI and beta-blockers creates the necessity to introduce broad educational programs and some organisational changes (implementation of CHF clinics).",

The study comprised 27 patients (20 men and 10 women), aged 38-55 years (mean 48.3 years) with stable angina. The patients were administered carvedilol in increasing every four weeks doses: 12.5 mg/day, 25 mg/day, 50 mg/day. The control group consisted of 12 healthy subjects aged 39-49 years (mean 45.7 years). Blood samples were collected before and 4, 8 and after 12 weeks of therapy in patients and once in control group. Our study has been approved by the local Ethics Committee. Superoxide dismutase (SOD-1), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) activities in erythrocytes were determined according to Misra and Fridovich, Little and O'Brien and Beers and Sizer; respectively. The enzymatic antioxidative defence was significantly decreased in patients with stable angina in comparison to healthy subjects. During carvedilol therapy an increase in SOD-1, GSH-Px and CAT activities was observed. Moreover GSH-Px activity after 8 and 12 weeks of carvedilol therapy did not differ from that observed in group of healthy subjects.

On the other hand, 123I-betamethyl-p-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) reflects myocardial fatty acid metabolism and is considered to be a more sensitive tracer than perfusion tracers. In this study, the efficacy of DCM for the evaluation of myocardial damage and the prediction of cardiac events was studied using 123I-BMIPP and 201TI (Tl) myocardial scintigraphy.",

An extent score (ES) and severity score (SS) were calculated for each BMIPP image. BMIPP and Tl images were divided into 17 segments, and total defect scores (TDS) were calculated for each. The TDS of the BMIPP and Tl images were compared with score differences greater than or equal to 4 and less than 4 defined as mismatch and non-mismatch, respectively.",

Thirty-two male and 18 female patients aged 35 to 60 years old were supplied sesame oil (Idhayam gingelly oil) and instructed to use it as the only edible oil for 45 days. Blood pressure, anthropometry, lipid profile, lipid peroxidation, and enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants were measured at baseline and after 45 days of sesame oil substitution. Substitution of sesame oil brought down systolic and diastolic blood pressure to normal. The same patients were asked to withdraw sesame oil consumption for another 45 days, and the measurements were repeated at the end of withdrawal period. Withdrawal of sesame oil substitution brought back the initial blood pressure values. A significant reduction was noted in body weight and body mass index (BMI) upon sesame oil substitution. No significant alterations were observed in lipid profile except triglycerides. Plasma levels of sodium reduced while potassium elevated upon the substitution of sesame oil. Lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS]) decreased while the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and the levels of vitamin C, vitamin E, Beta-carotene, and reduced glutathione (GSH) were increased. The results suggested that sesame oil as edible oil lowered blood pressure, decreased lipid peroxidation, and increased antioxidant status in hypertensive patients.",

Whether diltiazem exerts the same effect in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with spontaneous AF is unclear. Fifty patients presenting to the ED with new-onset or paroxysmal AF and a rapid ventricular rate (>100 beats per minute) were randomly assigned to receive intravenous diltiazem or esmolol during the first 24 hours of presentation. Conversion to sinus rhythm occurred in 10 patients (42%) in the diltiazem group compared with 10 patients (39%) in the esmolol group (P = 1.0). Diltiazem does not decrease the likelihood of spontaneous conversion of AF to sinus rhythm in the ED setting.",

We retrospectively analyzed 171 patients who had a baseline ejection fraction of 45% or less, a follow-up echocardiogram at 2 to 12 months after initiation of medical therapy, and a final echocardiogram. We found that 48.5% of the patients demonstrated initial improvements in LV function after initiation of medical therapy, and the improvements appear to be sustained (88% of patients) at 44 +/- 21 months follow-up. A nonischemic etiology and younger age were the only independent predictors of change of LV ejection fraction of 10 or more at a mean 8.4 +/- 3.4 months after optimal medical therapy. Our study revealed a trend toward improved long-term survival in individuals with an early improvement in LV ejection fraction with medical therapy, especially in those with sustained improvement.",

    "191": "Neuropeptide W (NPW) is a regulatory peptide that acts via two subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors, GPR7 and GPR8. Evidence has been provided that NPW is involved in the central regulation of energy homeostasis and feeding behavior. In this study, we examined the effects of NPW on insulin release and localization of NPW in the rat pancreas. NPW (10-100 nM) significantly increased insulin release in the presence of 8.3 mM, but not 2.8 mM, glucose in the isolated rat islets. By fura-2 microfluorometry, NPW (1-100 nM) concentration-dependently increased cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) at 8.3 mM glucose in rat single beta-cells. The NPW-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase was abolished under external Ca(2+)-free conditions and by an L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nifedipine (10 microM). RT-PCR analysis revealed that mRNA for NPW was expressed in the rat pancreas and hypothalamus. Double immunohistochemical analysis showed that NPW-immunoreactivity was found in islets and co-localized with insulin-containing beta-cells, but not glucagon-containing alpha-cells and somatostatin-containing delta-cells. These results suggest that NPW could serve as a local modulator of glucose-induced insulin release in rat islets. NPW directly activates beta-cells to enhance Ca(2+) influx through voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2+) channels and potentiates glucose-induced insulin release.", 
    "192": "Activation of the sympathetic nervous system is common in patients with chronic kidney disease, plays an important role in the genesis of hypertension, the rate of decrease of renal function, and is associated with the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality seen in these patients. beta-blockers are potent antihypertensive agents but differ in their hemodynamic effects on renal function. The cardioselective beta-blockers such as atenolol and metoprolol are known to retard the progression of renal diseases, but to a lesser degree compared with blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. However, the newer vasodilating beta-blockers such as carvedilol and nebivolol have different effects on renal hemodynamics and function primarily because of its greater adjunctive alpha1-blocking activity. Carvedilol decreases renal vascular resistance and prevents reductions in the glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow in patients with hypertension with or without impaired kidney function. In addition, carvedilol may retard progression of albuminuria, and provide cardiorenal protection in chronic kidney disease patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and at high risk for sudden cardiac death.", 
    "193": "Heart beat rate and blood pressure, together with baroreflex sensitivity, have become important tools in assessing cardiac autonomic system control and in studying sympathovagal balance. These analyses are usually performed thanks to spectral indices computed from standard spectral analysis techniques. However, standard spectral analysis and its corresponding rigid band-pass filter formulation suffer from two major drawbacks. It can be significantly distorted by non-stationarity issues and it proves unable to adjust to natural intra- and inter-individual variability. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD), a tool recently introduced in the literature, provides us with a signal-adaptive decomposition that proves useful for the analysis of non-stationary data and shows a strong capability to precisely adjust to the spectral content of the analyzed data. It is based on the concept that any complicated set of data can be decomposed into a finite number of components, called intrinsic mode functions, associated with different spectral contributions. The aims of this study were twofold. First, we studied the changes in the sympathovagal balance induced by various pharmacological blockades (phentolamine, atropine and atenolol) of the autonomic nervous system in normotensive rats. Secondly, we assessed the use of EMD for the analysis of the cardiac sympathovagal balance after pharmacological injections. For this, we developed a new (EMD-based) low frequency vs. high frequency spectral decomposition of heart beat variability and systolic blood pressure, we define the corresponding EMD spectral indices and study their relevance to detect and analyze changes accurately in the sympathovagal balance without having recourse to any a priori fixed high-pass/low-pass filters.",
