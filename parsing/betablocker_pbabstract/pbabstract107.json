    "0": "Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions in the United States. Obesity adversely affects the circulatory system with resultant endothelial dysfunction, which promotes systemic hypertension, coronary artery disease, and vascular calcification. It is believed that the release of adipokines is responsible for this effect. In addition, obesity causes intrinsic changes in the heart including an increase in left ventricular (LV) mass, LV hypertrophy, LV dilatation, left atrial dilatation, and diastolic, as well as systolic dysfunction in some cases. The combination of increased adipose cells and an increase lean muscle mass in obese patients results in high cardiac output and an accompanying increased circulating volume leading to these adaptive changes. Weight loss by means of caloric restriction or surgery results in favorable hemodynamic changes referred to as \"reverse remodeling.\" Regression of LV mass and chamber size has been shown universally. However, some studies have failed to reveal improvement in diastolic function possibly because of confounders such as nutritional deficiency that may occur after weight loss surgery. Some evidence seems to suggest that the greatest regression of LV mass and LV hypertrophy may occur when weight loss is combined with beta-adrenergic blocker therapy (in those who have an indication for the drug) when compared with other antihypertensive drugs versus weight loss alone.",

Exposure of myocytes to \u03b2(3) AR agonists decreased \u03b2(1) Na(+)-K(+) pump subunit glutathionylation, an oxidative modification that causes pump inhibition. The in vivo relevance of this was indicated by an increase in myocardial \u03b2(1) pump subunit glutathionylation with elimination of \u03b2(3) AR-mediated signaling in \u03b2(3) AR(-/-) mice.

Due to the high prevalence of concomitant signs of subclinical organ damage and the high risk of cardiorenal complications, hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome are to be considered at high risk. Although the management of this condition must begin with the implementation of a healthy lifestyle and dietary habits, these measures are usually insufficient to adequately control blood pressure values and reduce the cardiovascular risk in the long term. Therefore, in the presence of persistent blood pressure values above 140/90 mmHg, pharmacological antihypertensive therapy is often required to reach the recommended target of less than 130/80 mmHg. In the absence of specific, compelling indications to the contrary, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and calcium-channel blockers should be preferred over diuretics and beta-blockers.

An observational, non-interventional, open-label study of 406 eyes with primary open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension was thus undertaken. One drop of trav/tim fixed combination was administered in the evening for 3 months. Patients were divided into five groups according to previous drug regimens: timolol 0.5% monotherapy; betaxolol 0.5% monotherapy; latanoprost 0.005% monotherapy; travoprost 0.004% monotherapy; and dorzolamide 2%/timolol 0.5% fixed combination. Upon medication substitution, the trav/tim fixed combination provided better IOP control and tolerability in all five patient groups.

The amplitude and frequency of these contractions were regulated endogenously by the tissue. We tested whether the spontaneously contracted atrial strips could be used as an experimental assay model to determine inotropic and chronotropic effects of existing drugs and candidate chemicals directly on human heart muscle. The well-established inotropic and chronotropic effects of the calcium channel blocker (verapamil), the \u03b2-adrenoceptor blocker (propranolol), the phosphodiesterase inhibitor (theophylline) and the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor (ouabain) were tested on spontaneously contracting strips of human atrium. With demonstrative tracings, we showed the negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of verapamil and propranolol, the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of theophylline and the transient inotropic and tachyarrhythmic effects of ouabain on dobutamine-pretreated human atrial strips. By using this method the undetermined inotropic and chronotropic effects of any candidate compound can be evaluated directly on spontaneously contracting human atrial muscle. Furthermore, we demonstrated the advantages of using dobutamine instead of conventional electrical field stimulation in order to obtain stable and durable contractions of the atrial strips. In conclusion, we describe a new, simple, reliable, convenient and ethical method for investigating the inotropic and chronotropic effects of candidate drugs directly on human atrium tissue without the need for human test subjects.",

Alterations in autonomic function have been documented in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We hypothesize that alterations in autonomic function may contribute to mutation-specific clinical phenotypes in cTnT-related FHC. Heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) has been used to assess autonomic function from an electrocardiograph. Nontransgenic, \u0394160E, or R92Q mice were implanted with radiofrequency transmitters to obtain continuous electrocardiograph recordings during 24-h baseline and 30-min recordings after \u03b2-adrenergic receptor drug injections. Although \u0394160E mice did not differ from nontransgenic mice for any 24-h HRV measurements, R92Q mice had impaired HR regulation, as measured by a decrease in the SD of the R-R interval, a decrease in the low frequency-to-high frequency ratio, a decrease in normalized low frequency, and an increase in normalized high frequency. \u03b2-Adrenergic receptor density measurements and HRV analysis after drug injections did not reveal any significant differences for \u0394160E or R92Q mice versus nontransgenic mice. Arrhythmia analysis revealed both an increased incidence of heart block in R92Q mice at baseline and frequency of premature ventricular contractions after isoproterenol injections in \u0394160E and R92Q mice. In addition, \u0394160E and R92Q mice exhibited a prolonged P duration after drug injections. Therefore, between two independent and clinically severe cTnT mutations within the same functional domain, only R92Q mice exhibited altered autonomic function, whereas both mutations demonstrated abnormalities in conduction and ventricular ectopy.",

    "35": "A gain of function mutation N588K in the KCNH2 gene that encodes HERG channels has been shown to underlie the SQT1 form of short QT syndrome (SQTS). We describe a different mutation in the KCNH2 gene in a Chinese family with clinical evidence of SQTS. A Chinese family with a markedly short QT interval (QTc=316 \u00b1 9 ms, n=4) and a strong family history of sudden death was investigated. Analysis of candidate genes contributing to ventricular repolarization identified a C1853T mutation in the KCNH2 gene coding for the HERG channel, resulting in an amino acid change (T618I) that was found to 100% co-segregate with the SQTS phenotype (n=4). Whole cell voltage clamp studies of the T618I mutation in HEK-cells demonstrated a 6-fold increase in maximum steady state current (146.1 \u00b1 16.7 vs 23.8 \u00b1 5.5 pA/pF) that occurred at a 20 mV more positive potential compared to the wild type channels. The voltage dependence of inactivation was significantly shifted in the positive voltage direction (WT -78.6 \u00b1 6.8 vs T618I -29.3 \u00b1 1.7 mV). Kinetic analysis revealed slower inactivation rates of T618I but faster rates of recovery from inactivation. Quinidine (5 \u03bcM) and sotalol (500 \u03bcM) had similar inhibitory effects on steady currents measured at +20 mV in WT and T618I but were less effective in inhibiting tail currents of mutant channels. The altered function of T618I-HERG channels suggests that this mutation in the KCNH2 gene is responsible for the SQTS phenotype in this family. Both quinidine and sotalol may be therapeutic options for patients with the T618I HERG mutation.", 
    "36": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs frequently soon after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and often results in increased mortality and morbidity, particularly in patients with heart failure. New-onset AF is also a common event in the early period after discharge from a cardiac surgery clinic. Current guidelines recommend \u03b2 blockers as first-line medication for the prevention of AF after CABG. In this prospective study, we investigated the effectiveness of the highly selective \u03b21 receptor antagonist bisoprolol compared to the less selective \u03b2 blocker carvedilol in preventing postdischarge AF after CABG in patients with decreased left ventricular function. Three hundred twenty patients (231 men, 89 women, mean age 66 \u00b1 10 years) with ejection fraction <40% who underwent CABG and were then referred to an in-hospital cardiac rehabilitation program were randomized to receive bisoprolol (n = 160) or carvedilol (n = 160) starting 4 to 5 days after surgery. Bisoprolol was started at 1.25 mg 1 time/day and carvedilol was started 3.125 mg 2 times/day. All patients underwent continuous telemetric electrocardiographic monitoring for 5 days after entry in the study and thereafter 2 times/day routinely up to hospital discharge. During follow-up, 23 patients (14.6%) in the bisoprolol group and 37 patients (23%) in the carvedilol group developed AF (relative risk 0.6, confidence interval 0.4 to 0.9, p = 0.032). Twenty-six percent of all AF episodes were asymptomatic. At the 4-week outpatient visit, those in the bisoprolol group showed a significantly greater decrease in heart rate, being in sinus rhythm or AF (-15.6 \u00b1 3 vs -9.4 \u00b1 3 beats/min, p = 0.021), whereas changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not differ significantly. In conclusion, bisoprolol is more effective than carvedilol in decreasing the incidence of postdischarge AF after CABG in patients with decreased left ventricular function.",

The pharmacokinetics of metoprolol after intravenous (IV) (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg) and oral (1, 2, and 5 mg/kg) administration, and the intestinal and hepatic first-pass extraction of metoprolol after IV, intraportal, and intraduodenal (1 and 2 mg/kg) administration were comprehensively assessed in rats. 2. Metoprolol exhibited dose-independent pharmacokinetics after IV administration, and dose-dependent pharmacokinetics after oral administration probably due to the saturable first-pass extraction of metoprolol. At doses where metoprolol exhibited dose-independent pharmacokinetics (1 and 2 mg/kg), complete absorption (>99.2%) and low F (<0.245) after oral administration were observed. The intestinal and hepatic first-pass extraction ratio (E(G) and E(H), respectively) of metoprolol were approximately 0.45 and 0.60, respectively (equivalent to approximately 45% and 30% of orally administered dose, respectively), suggesting considerable contribution of intestinal first-pass extraction to the low F of metoprolol in rats. 3.

While reports of this condition date back for centuries, little is known about what interventions are most effective for this population. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the research evidence on interventions for the prevention and treatment of postpartum psychosis. Studies were searched using CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases. All primary research studies published in English since 1970 that explored interventions for the prevention or treatment of postpartum psychosis were included. The search resulted in 26 studies on interventions for postpartum psychosis, with 10 focusing on prevention and 17 focusing on treatment. Studies on the prevention of postpartum psychosis have examined the effects of mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and hormone therapy, while those examining treatment have included electroconvulsive therapy, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, hormones, and the beta blocker propranolol. Only preliminary evidence suggests which interventions may be effective strategies to prevent (e.g., lithium) and treat (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy) postpartum psychosis. Due to methodological limitations in the studies reviewed, extensive evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum psychosis cannot be made. The known risk factors and negative consequences of postpartum psychosis point to the importance of preventative and acute treatment measures.

Expression levels of the identified genes were further estimated by pretreatment with an \u03b11-adrenoceptor blocker and/or a \u03b21-adrenoceptor blocker. In response to IMO, expression of 46 genes was significantly altered in the heart and that of 49 genes was significantly altered in the aorta. Pathway analysis with DAVID Bioinformatics Resources indicated that regulation of transcription and response to endogenous stimulation were the top two scoring pathways. Altered expression of cardiac genes was blunted by pretreatment with a \u03b21-adrenoceptor blocker or \u03b11 + \u03b21-adrenoceptor blockers. In contrast, that of aortic genes was blunted by pretreatment with an \u03b11-adrenoceptor blocker or \u03b11 + \u03b21-adrenoceptor blockers. Activation of \u03b11-adrenoceptor in the blood vessels or activation of \u03b21-adrenoceptors in the heart were mainly responsible for emotional stress-induced alteration of cardiac and vascular gene profiles.",

Telephone care is an option that could help to titrate HF medication in a timely manner. We describe our experience of a nurse-run, cardiologist- or nurse practitioner-supervised clinic to up-titrate HF medications via telephone.", 
    "52": "Patients with the diagnosis of HF, New York Heart Association classes I to III, were referred to a registered nurse-run, cardiologist-/nurse practitioner-supervised HF medication titration clinic. Clinical and medication data collected at enrollment to the clinic and at 3 to 6 months after optimization of HF medications in patients who did or did not reach the target doses were compared. Effect on left ventricular (LV) function was also evaluated.", 
    "53": "There were 79 patients in the evaluation: 64 with HF and LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and the remaining 15 with HF and preserved ejection fraction (EF). Seventy-two percent of patients with LVSD were on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and 61% were on a \u03b2-blocker at baseline, and this increased to 98% and 97%, respectively, after optimization. Target doses was achieved in 50% of patients for ACEI or ARB, and in 41% for \u03b2-blockers. The median time to optimization was 54 days (interquartile range, 20-97 days). The average number of phone calls at the time of optimization were 5.4 (SD, 3.7), and the average number of clinic visits was 1.9 (SD, 1.3). Reasons for not reaching the target doses included hypotension, hyperkalemia, and renal dysfunction for ACEI and bradycardia for \u03b2-blockers. Overall, the EF increased by 10% (SD, 10%) after 6 months, and 35% or greater in 42% of patients whose baseline EF was less than 35%. There were no adverse events related to the dose up-titration.",

We evaluated signaling via the human platelet thrombin receptors, protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1 and PAR4, to the activation of cPLA(2\u03b1), which provides a substrate for the biosynthesis of TxA(2) and 12-HETE.",

PAR1-induced formation of TxA(2) was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol kinase inhibitor LY294002, whereas this inhibitor did not block 12-HETE biosynthesis. Both 1-butanol and propranolol also blocked TxA(2) biosynthesis but did not inhibit 12-HETE formation.",

In this systematic review we assessed the safety and efficacy of the \u03b21-specific, adrenergic receptor antagonist esmolol in noncardiac surgery. Safety was assessed by analyzing the incidence of postoperative hypotension and bradycardia, and efficacy was assessed by analyzing the incidence of myocardial ischemia.", 
    "59": "We searched electronic databases for randomized placebo-controlled trials of the perioperative use of esmolol in noncardiac surgery. We abstracted data on design, demographics, hemodynamic changes (planned or unplanned), myocardial ischemia, and MI. Heterogeneity was assessed via meta-regression.",

Overall, the analysis demonstrates an increased incidence of unplanned hypotension (OR 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 3.04), which was found to be dose related (R(2) = 0.408). An increased incidence of significant bradycardia was not demonstrated (OR 1.18; 95% CI, 0.69 to 2.02). Dose titration was shown to influence both the change in arterial blood pressure and heart rate. In comparison with placebo, esmolol decreased the frequency of myocardial ischemia in the 7 evaluating studies (OR 0.17; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.45). We did not assess the effects of esmolol on the incidence of MI or stroke because the incidence of these events was too infrequent in the retrieved studies.",

    "62": "Beta blockers have been used in the treatment of cardiovascular conditions for decades. Despite a long history and status as a guideline-recommended treatment option for hypertension, recent meta-analyses have brought into question whether \u03b2 blockers are still an appropriate therapy given outcomes data from other antihypertensive drug classes. However, \u03b2 blockers are a heterogenous class of agents with diverse pharmacologic and physiologic properties. Much of the unfavorable data revealed in the recent meta-analyses were gleaned from studies involving nonvasodilating, traditional \u03b2 blockers, such as atenolol. However, findings with traditional \u03b2 blockers may not be extrapolated to other members of the class, particularly those agents with vasodilatory activity. Vasodilatory \u03b2 blockers (i.e., carvedilol and nebivolol) reduce blood pressure in large part through reducing systemic vascular resistance rather than by decreasing cardiac output, as is observed with traditional \u03b2 blockers. Vasodilating ability may also ameliorate some of the concerns associated with traditional \u03b2 blockade, such as the adverse effects on metabolic and lipid parameters, including an increased risk for new-onset diabetes. Furthermore, vasodilating ability is physiologically relevant and important in treating a condition with common co-morbidities involving metabolic and lipid abnormalities such as hypertension. In patients with hypertension and diabetes or coronary artery disease, vasodilating \u03b2 blockers provide effective blood pressure control with neutral or beneficial effects on important parameters for the co-morbid disease. In conclusion, it is time for a reexamination of the clinical evidence for the use of \u03b2 blockers in hypertension, recognizing that there are patients for whom \u03b2 blockers, particularly those with vasodilatory actions, are an appropriate treatment option.",

Additionally, the capability of excised gastric mucosa to maintain an acidic pH was assessed. In vitro permeation studies were performed in Ussing-type diffusion chambers with rat stomach using fluorescence-labeled bacitracin (bac-FITC), sodium fluorescein (NaFlu), propranolol HCl, and cimetidine as model drugs. The pH was adjusted to pH 1, 2, and 6.8 in the donor chamber and pH 7.4 in the acceptor chamber. The study demonstrated that both, the fore stomach and the glandular gastric mucosa, are capable of maintaining an acidic pH of 1-1.2 in the donor chamber. P(app) (permeation coefficients) were found to be 1.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 \u00d7\u00b710(-7) and 7.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 \u00d7\u00b710(-7) for bac-FITC and 3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 \u00d7\u00b710(-7) and 2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 \u00d7\u00b710(-6) cm/sec for NaFlu at pH 2 and 6.8, respectively, in the glandular stomach. In order to evaluate the effect of pH on the integrity of paracellular space, propranolol as high-permeability drug and cimetidine as low-permeability drug were chosen. The P(app) of propranolol HCl was determined to be 5.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3 \u00d7\u00b710(-7) and 1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 \u00d7\u00b710(-6) cm/sec at pH 2 and 6.8, respectively, in the glandular stomach.

    "64": "Beta-blockers are a heterogeneous group of antihypertensive agents. What they have in common is competitive antagonistic action on beta-adrenoreceptors (B1, B2 and B3). They differ in their receptor selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), vasodilating properties and metabolism. Antihypertensive mechanisms and effect differ according to receptor-specificity and ISA, where differences in duration of action also have to be considered. An unfavourable metabolic profile of beta-blockers was reported based on studies describing the metabolic side effects of weakly-selective or non-selective agents. Newer generation beta-blockers appear to have a metabolic neutral profile. In systolic heart failure, three agents proved to improve survival up to 30%, mainly because of B1-blocking and/or vasodilating properties. The position of beta-blockers in treating diastolic heart failure remains uncertain. Beta-blocker therapy in coronary artery disease also leads to uncontested survival benefit, the cardioprotective mechanism largely due to rate reduction. This paper aims to describe the basis of heterogeneity of the available agents and to translate this into their applicability in different cardiovascular diseases, with focus on the underlying physiopathological mechanisms.",

Here we studied the therapeutic effect of combining a PPAR-\u03b3 agonist, rosiglitazone (Ros), with an ARB, losartan (Los), in experimental IgAN induced in Lewis rats by oral and intravenous immunization with bovine gamma-globulin (BGG). The rats were randomly divided into six groups: control, IgAN, IgAN with unilateral nephrectomy (IgAN/1K), and IgAN/1K receiving Ros, Los, or Ros + Los. Medication was given 1 week after nephrectomy until killing. Rats developing IgAN had hematuria, mesangial hypercellularity with IgA deposition, glomerular damage, and tubulointerstitial infiltration of CD25+ leukocytes accompanied by increased renal expression of TGF-\u03b2, AngII receptor subtype-1 (ATR1) and ICAM-1. The renal histopathology, albuminuria, and renal expression of TGF-\u03b2, ATR1 and ICAM-1 worsened with unilateral nephrectomy. Ros or Los reduced the renal expression of PCNA, TGF-\u03b2, ATR1, and ICAM-1 in IgAN rats with nephrectomy. Despite no difference between rats treated with monotherapy, combined therapy offered additive effect with decreased renal expression of TGF-\u03b2, ATR1 and ICAM-1 and attenuation of renal injury. Our animal study suggests combined PPAR-\u03b3 agonist and ARB holds promise for future therapy for IgAN.",

Although the differential pharmacological effects of individual Carvedilol enantiomer is supported by preceding studies, the cellular response to each enantiomer is not well understood. Here we report the use of GC-MS metabolomic profiling to study the effects of Carvedilol enantiomers on vascular smooth muscle cells (A7r5) and to shed new light on molecular events underlying Carvedilol treatment. The metabolic analysis revealed alternations in the levels of 8 intracellular metabolites and 5 secreted metabolites in A7r5 cells incubated separately with S- and R-Carvedilol. Principal component analysis of the metabolite data demonstrated the characteristic metabolic signatures in S- and R-Carvedilol-treated cells. A panel of metabolites, including L-serine, L-threonine, 5-oxoproline, myristic acid, palmitic acid and inositol are closely correlated to the vascular smooth muscle contraction. Our findings reveal the differentiating metabolites for A7r5 cells incubated with individual enantiomer of Carvedilol, which opens new perspectives to employ metabolic profiling platform to study chiral drug-cell interactions and aid their incorporation into future improvement of \u03b2-blocker therapy.",

At the study start, all patients received bisoprolol, the dose of which was titrated until the clinical signs of intolerance (most common - bronchoobstruction) appeared or worsened. Average dose of bisoprolol at the time of forced titration stop was 6.3+/-2.2 mg/day, mean heart rate (HR) decreased from 82.1+/-8.4 to 72.2+/-8.5 bpm. Then, the patients were randomized into two groups: patients of the first group (n=25) continued to take bisoprolol in tolerable dose, and patients of the second group were added ivabradine (5-15 mg, mean dose 10.7+/- 3.1 mg/day). In contrast to the bisoprolol alone, combination therapy resulted in further decrease of HR to an average of 62.6+/-4.1 bpm over 6 month of follow-up.

Comparison of atropine and propranolol with baseline and combined cardiac parasympathetic and sympathetic blockade (atropine+propranolol) indicated opposite influences of vagal and cardiac sympathetic outflows on HR exponents. The vagal outflow adds white-noise components, amplifying differences with BP exponents; the cardiac sympathetic outflow adds Brownian motion components at short scales and contributes to the plateau between 40 and 80 s. Overall sympathetic inhibition by clonidine decreased short- and long-term exponents of HR, and short-term exponents of BP, so that their \u03b1(t) spectra had different means but similar profiles. Therefore, cardiac vagal, cardiac sympathetic and vascular sympathetic outflows contribute differently to HR and BP fractal structures. Results are explained by different distribution and dynamics of acetylcholine receptors and of \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors between heart and vasculature.", 
    "91": "Propranolol treatment was recently reported to be successful for the management of severe infantile hemangioma. Known adverse effects of propranolol treatment include transient bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and bronchospasm (in patients with underlying spastic respiratory illnesses), which led to a general recommendation to gradually increase propranolol dosage and closely monitor patients' hemodynamics at the onset of therapy. To date, no serious or unexpected adverse effects that required specific intervention have been reported. In this report, we describe the case of a 17-week-old female preterm infant who presented with a large, ulcerated, cutaneous-subcutaneous hemangioma of the right lateral thoracic wall, which we treated successfully with propranolol. A few days into therapy, a potentially life-threatening adverse effect, severe hyperkalemia, was observed and required treatment with loop diuretics, fluids, and nebulized salbutamol to normalize her serum potassium levels. This therapy could be gradually tapered and finally discontinued only after several weeks of propranolol treatment. Our case report indicates that, at least during the initial phase of the propranolol treatment of infantile hemangioma, close monitoring of serum electrolytes, besides the monitoring of hemodynamics and blood glucose, is necessary.",

At 24 h after IM, isolated intestinal smooth muscle contractile activity in vitro, gastrointestinal transit in vivo, inflammatory mediator expression and leucocyte infiltration were measured.", 
    "95": "After IM, ileal circular muscle contractility in vitro and gastrointestinal transit in vivo were reduced and the number of macrophages and neutrophils increased in the inflamed muscle layer, resulting in the induction of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 1 \u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Both MOS and CJ-033466 significantly attenuated not only the intestinal motility dysfunction but also the leucocyte infiltration and inflammatory mediator expression after IM. The autonomic ganglionic blocker hexamethonium (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and the \u03b17-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR) antagonist methyl lycaconitine citrate (0.087 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked MOS-mediated ameliorative actions.

    "97": "In recent years, a major development in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) is the use of catheter ablation, and a significant number of patients may benefit from this mode of therapy. On a global scale, it may not be feasible to deal with most patients solely on the basis of ablation. Therefore, it is likely that much of the therapy for AF will continue to rely on antiarrhythmic agents for maintaining sinus rhythm. For many years, amiodarone and sotalol have been the dominant antiarrhythmic agents, with amiodarone being the most effective antiarrhythmic in suppressing AF; however, amiodarone use is limited due to concerns of end-organ toxicity. Upstream therapies, such as statins, fish oil, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers may also provide additive efficacy to these and other membrane-active antiarrhythmics. In recent years, a number of new agents are being developed and the first successful congener of amiodarone, dronedarone, has been shown to be effective in controlling AF and reducing cardiovascular hospitalization. This paper explores the possibility of augmenting the extent of controlling AF by combining multiple potent antiarrhythmic agents old and new.", 
    "98": "Class I antiarrhythmic drugs are sodium channel inhibitors that act by slowing myocardial conduction and, thus, interrupting or preventing reentrant arrhythmia. Due to proarrhythmic effects and the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, class I antiarrhythmics should not be administered in patients with structural heart disease. Nevertheless, there remains a broad spectrum of arrhythmias--among the most common being atrial fibrillation--that can successfully be treated with class I antiarrhythmic drugs. This review gives an overview on the classification, antiarrhythmic mechanisms, indications, side effects, and application modes of class I antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "99": "Susceptibility of thermoregulatory responses to cold to blockage of \u03b1(1)- and \u03b2-adrenoreceptors differs in health and hypertension. \u03b1(1)-Adrenoceptor blockade reduces vessel reactivity during cooling and vessel reaction to cold becomes similar to that in intact normotensive rats. Changes in the structure of metabolic response to cold in favor of non-shivering thermogenesis typical of hypertensive animals becomes even more pronounced under conditions of \u03b1(1)-adrenoceptor blockade due to inhibition of cold shivering. Blockage of \u03b2-adrenoceptors does not affect parameters of vascular response to cooling. In hypertensive rats, in contrast to normotensive animals, \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockade during cooling increased temperature thresholds for total metabolic reaction and shivering. The maximum shivering intensity also increased, which partially compensated inhibition of non-shivering thermogenesis. In the whole organism, blockade of one type of adrenoceptors during cooling leads to intensification of compensatory mechanisms realized through adrenoceptors of the other type. In hypertensive rats, compensatory capacities of thermogenic processes controlled by \u03b1(1)- and \u03b2-adrenoceptors are impaired in comparison with normotensive animals under conditions of inhibition of both shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis.", 
    "100": "Chronic hypoxia protects the heart against injury caused by acute oxygen deprivation, but its salutary mechanism is poorly understood. The aim was to find out whether cardiomyocytes isolated from chronically hypoxic hearts retain the improved resistance to injury and whether the mitochondrial large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels contribute to the protective effect. Adult male rats were adapted to continuous normobaric hypoxia (inspired O2 fraction 0.10) for 3 wk or kept at room air (normoxic controls). Myocytes, isolated separately from the left ventricle (LVM), septum (SEPM), and right ventricle, were exposed to 25-min metabolic inhibition with sodium cyanide, followed by 30-min reenergization (MI/R). Some LVM were treated with either 30 \u03bcM NS-1619 (BKCa opener), or 2 \u03bcM paxilline (BKCa blocker), starting 25 min before metabolic inhibition. Cell injury was detected by Trypan blue exclusion and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Chronic hypoxia doubled the number of rod-shaped LVM and SEPM surviving the MI/R insult and reduced LDH release. While NS-1619 protected cells from normoxic rats, it had no additive salutary effect in the hypoxic group. Paxilline attenuated the improved resistance of cells from hypoxic animals without affecting normoxic controls; it also abolished the protective effect of NS-1619 on LDH release in the normoxic group. While chronic hypoxia did not affect protein abundance of the BKCa channel regulatory \u03b21-subunit, it markedly decreased its glycosylation level. It is concluded that ventricular myocytes isolated from chronically hypoxic rats retain the improved resistance against injury caused by MI/R. Activation of the mitochondrial BKCa channel likely contributes to this protective effect.", 
    "101": "Pomolic acid has recently shown hypotensive effect in rats. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the vascular effects of this triterpenoid and to examine its mode of action. Functional experiments in rat aortic rings precontracted with norepinephrine were performed to evaluate the vasorelaxant effect of pomolic acid. This triterpenoid induced a vasorelaxation (IC\u2085\u2080 = 2.45 \u03bcM) in a concentration- and endothelium-dependent manner and showed no effect on contractions evoked by KCl (25 mM). Pre-treatment of aortic rings with L-NAME (100 \u03bcM), methylene blue (100 \u03bcM) or glibenclamide (10 \u03bcM), totally prevented the vasorelaxation induced by pomolic acid, while indomethacin (10 \u03bcM) had no effect on this response. Additionally, pomolic acid relaxation was unaffected under the muscarinic- and \u03b2-adrenergic-receptor blocked ensured for atropine and propanolol respectively (10 \u03bcM each). In contrast, the vasorelaxant effect of pomolic acid was abolished under the purinergic-receptor blocked ensured for suramin (10 \u03bcM). Finally, apyrase (0.8 U/ml) an enzyme which hydrolyses ATP and ADP did not affect pomolic acid relaxation. In summary, pomolic acid has a potent endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant effect, possibly acting through the direct activation of endothelial purinergic receptors via NO-cGMP signaling pathway, which could be part of the mechanism underlying its hypotensive effect.", 
    "102": "Interest in the presence of pharmaceuticals in wastewater, in the water of our rivers and, to a lesser extent, in our drinking water, has been growing in recent decades. Many of these substances, currently classified as \"emerging pollutants\", are biologically active compounds and continuously released in effluents. As sewage treatment plants (STPs) are not adequately equipped to eliminate all of these substances completely, some are discharged directly into rivers. In Spain, as in most of its neighbouring countries, there is an elevated use of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (which are extremely prevalent among the older adult population) and anti-inflammatory medications, which are obtainable over the counter without a medical prescription. This study therefore sought to determine to what degree pharmaceuticals with the highest regional prescription and/or use rates, such as cardiovascular and analgesic/anti-inflammatory/antipyretic medications, were present in the principal rivers (Jarama, Manzanares, Guadarrama, Henares and Tagus) and tap-water samples of the Madrid Region (MR). Samples were taken downstream the discharge of 10 of the most important region's STPs and the most frequently used drugs in the region were analysed for. Of the 24 drugs analysed, 21 were detected at concentrations ranging from 2 ng L\u207b\u00b9 to 18 \u03bcg L\u207b\u00b9. The highest drug concentrations corresponded to ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, atenolol, frusemide (furosemide), gemfibrozil and hydrochlorthiazide, and in most cases exceeded the amounts reported in the scientific literature. No traces of these groups of pharmaceuticals were detected in the drinking water analysed. On the basis of the high concentrations detected, we believe that an environmental surveillance system should be implemented to assess the continuous discharge of these pharmaceuticals and their possible ecotoxicological effects. At the same time, efforts to raise the awareness of the public about responsible use and the proper disposal of such substances at purpose-designated collection points should be increased. Furthermore sewage treatment processes should be suitably adapted to increase the rates of removal of these drugs.",

The neuropsychiatric adverse reactions associated with the use of beta-blockers are relatively uncommon and they are mostly seen with poisoning or overdose. We describe an 81-year-old man who developed sleep disorders, nightmares, depression and anxiety as probable adverse effect of low-dose metoprolol (25 mg/day). This case illustrates not only the neuropsychiatric adverse reactions of beta-blockers, but also that diagnosis of these reactions can be easily missed in elderly patients.",

Suramin- and saline-treated (control) mdx mice performed exercise on a treadmill to worsen disease progression. Immunoblotting showed an increase of TGF-\u03b21 in mdx diaphragm, limb, and cardiac muscles. Suramin decreased creatine kinase in mdx mice and attenuated fibrosis in all muscles studied, except for cardiac muscle. Suramin protected limb muscles against damage and reduced the exercise-induced loss of strength over time.

    "118": "The handle region peptide (HRP), a (pro)renin receptor (P)RR blocker, did not prevent the acute nephropathy occurring 2 weeks after clipping in renovascular hypertensive rats. This study was performed to examine the effects of HRP, its scramble peptide, or a saline vehicle on slowly progressive nephropathy occurring in the kidneys of two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats. At 2 weeks after clipping, the renal morphology in the clipped and non-clipped kidneys was similar in the three groups of rats. At 12 weeks after clipping, however, the glomerulosclerosis index (GI) and the tubulointerstitial damage (TD) of the non-clipped kidneys of the HRP-treated rats were significantly lower than those of vehicle-treated rats, although the GI and the TD were similar in the rats treated with scramble peptide and vehicle. The GI and the TD of the clipped kidneys were similar in the three groups of rats at 12 weeks after clipping. In the non-clipped kidneys at 12 weeks after clipping, activated prorenin levels, angiotensin II levels and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 mRNA levels of HRP-treated rats were significantly lower than those of vehicle-treated rats, although they were similar in the non-clipped kidneys from the rats treated with scramble peptide and vehicle. In the clipped kidneys at 12 weeks after clipping, activated prorenin levels, angiotensin II levels and TGF-\u03b2 mRNA levels were similar in the three groups of rats.

    "121": "Assessing viral-based \u03b2ARKct gene delivery with electrophysiological techniques, analysis of contractile performance, subcellular Ca\u00b2(+) handling, and site-specific protein phosphorylation, we demonstrate that \u03b2ARKct enhances the cardiac L-type Ca\u00b2(+) channel (LCC) current (I(Ca)) both in NCs and FCs on \u03b2AR stimulation. Mechanistically, \u03b2ARKct augments I(Ca) by preventing enhanced inhibitory interaction between the \u03b11-LCC subunit (Cav1.2\u03b1) and liberated G(\u03b2\u03b3) subunits downstream of activated \u03b2ARs.

Targeted interruption of this inhibitory signaling pathway by \u03b2ARKct confers improved \u03b2AR contractile responsiveness through increased I(Ca) without enhancing regular or restoring abnormal cAMP-signaling. \u03b2ARKct-mediated improvement of I(Ca) rendered cardiomyocytes neither susceptible to \u03b2AR-induced damage nor arrhythmogenic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca\u00b2(+) leakage.", 
    "123": "The present study investigated whether baroreflex control of autonomic function is impaired when there is a deficiency in NO production and the role of adrenergic and cholinergic mechanisms in mediating reflex responses. Electrical stimulation of the aortic depressor nerve in conscious normotensive and nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced hypertensive rats was applied before and after administration of methylatropine, atenolol, and prazosin alone or in combination. The hypotensive response to progressive electrical stimulation (5 to 90 Hz) was greater in hypertensive (-27 \u00b1 2 to -64 \u00b1 3 mmHg) than in normotensive rats (-17 \u00b1 1 to -46 \u00b1 2 mmHg), whereas the bradycardic response was similar in both groups (-34 \u00b1 5 to -92 \u00b1 9 and -21 \u00b1 2 to -79 \u00b1 7 beats/min, respectively). Methylatropine and atenolol showed no effect in the hypotensive response in either group. Methylatropine blunted the bradycardic response in both groups, whereas atenolol attenuated only in hypertensive rats. Prazosin blunted the hypotensive response in both normotensive (43%) and hypertensive rats (53%) but did not affect the bradycardic response in either group. Prazosin plus angiotensin II, used to restore basal arterial pressure, provided hemodynamic responses similar to those of prazosin alone. The triple pharmacological blockade abolished the bradycardic response in both groups but displayed similar residual hypotensive response in hypertensive (-13 \u00b1 2 to -27 \u00b1 2 mmHg) and normotensive rats (-10 \u00b1 1 to -25 \u00b1 3 mmHg). In conclusion, electrical stimulation produced a well-preserved baroreflex-mediated decrease in arterial pressure and heart rate in conscious l-NAME-induced hypertensive rats. Moreover, withdrawal of the sympathetic drive played a role in the reflex bradycardia only in hypertensive rats. The residual fall in pressure after the triple pharmacological blockade suggests the involvement of a vasodilatory mechanism unrelated to NO or deactivation of \u03b1(1)-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "124": "Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation is proinflammatory and proatherogenic. Antagonism of MR improves survival in humans with congestive heart failure caused by atherosclerotic disease. In animal models, activation of MR exacerbates atherosclerosis. The enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11\u03b2-HSD2) prevents inappropriate activation of the MR by inactivating glucocorticoids in mineralocorticoid-target tissues. To determine whether glucocorticoid-mediated activation of MR increases atheromatous plaque formation, we generated Apoe(-/-)/11\u03b2-HSD2(-/-) double-knockout (E/b2) mice. On chow diet, E/b2 mice developed atherosclerotic lesions by 3 months of age, whereas Apolipoprotein E (Apoe(-/-)) mice remained lesion free. Brachiocephalic plaques in 3-month-old E/b2 mice showed increased macrophage and lipid content and reduced collagen content compared with similar sized brachiocephalic plaques in 6-month-old Apoe(-/-) mice. Crucially, treatment of E/b2 mice with eplerenone, an MR antagonist, reduced plaque development and macrophage infiltration while increasing collagen and smooth muscle cell content without any effect on systolic blood pressure. In contrast, reduction of systolic blood pressure in E/b2 mice using the epithelial sodium channel blocker amiloride produced a less-profound atheroprotective effect. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 expression was increased in the endothelium of E/b2 mice compared with Apoe(-/-) mice. Similarly, aldosterone increased vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 expression in mouse aortic endothelial cells, an effect mimicked by corticosterone only in the presence of an 11\u03b2-HSD2 inhibitor. Thus, loss of 11\u03b2-HSD2 leads to striking atherogenesis associated with activation of MR, stimulating proinflammatory processes in the endothelium of E/b2 mice.", 
    "125": "Aggression is a behavioural strategy for securing resources (food, mates and territory) and its expression is strongly influenced by their presence and value. While it is known that resource holders are generally highly aggressive towards intruding consexuals and usually defeat them, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are not known. In a novel intruder-resident paradigm for field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus), we show that otherwise submissive losers of a preceding aggressive encounter readily fight and often defeat aggressive winners after occupying an artificial shelter. This aggression enhancing effect first became evident after 2 min residency, and was maximal after 15 min, but absent 15 min after shelter removal. The residency effect was abolished following non-selective depletion of biogenic amines from the central nervous system using reserpine, or semi-selective depletion of octopamine and dopamine using \u03b1-methyl-tyrosine, but not following serotonin depletion using \u03b1-methyl-tryptophan. The residency effect was also abolished by the treatment with phentolamine, an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, or epinastine, a highly selective octopamine receptor blocker, but not by propranolol, a \u00df-adrenergic receptor antagonist, or by yohimbine, an insect tyramine receptor blocker.

Overall, there are complicated antifibrillatory effects which are involved in the reduction of morbidity and mortality of this the therapy. According to the guidelines, it is important to uptitrate to highest tolerated dose. In patients with atrial fibrillation, antiadrenergic therapy should be the first line treatment; if well tolerated, then \u03b2-blockers alone or as a combination with an antiarrhythmic drug is preferable. Future prospective studies on the antiarrhythmic effects in this therapeutic area should include comparisons of different \u03b1 - and \u03b2-selective active substances. Increasing knowledge of the differential therapy with the available active substances including intravenously applicable short-acting \u03b2-blockers, e.g., in intensive care therapy - should distinguish the different therapeutic effects.", 
    "128": "Decades after its registration, amiodarone is still regarded as the most effective antiarrhythmic drug available for the treatment of tachyarrhythmias. Amiodarone is classified as a class III antiarrhythmic drug. In addition to the prolongation of cardiac repolarization, its leading pharmacologic features are sodium and calcium channel block, nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic inhibition as well as high lipophilicity and a very long plasma half-life. In patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, amiodarone is the most effective antiarrhythmic drug in maintaining sinus rhythm. Furthermore, it prevents ventricular arrhythmias, such as frequent ventricular extrasystoles or nonsustained runs of ventricular tachycardia, as well as sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. In patients with increased risk for sudden cardiac death, e.g., with severely depressed left ventricular function, amiodarone is a highly effective and safe antiarrhythmic drug. In addition, amiodarone has been shown to reduce the number of appropriate and inappropriate shocks in patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. During long-term amiodarone treatment, typical side effects including corneal microdeposits, blue-gray skin discoloration, photosensitivity, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, peripheral neuropathy, optical neuritis and hepatotoxicity accrue. Upon cessation of medication, these are almost always reversible. Irreversible, severe adverse effects, such as pulmonary toxicity, are very rare under the currently used maintenance dose of 200 mg/day.

Inhibition of this leak is an emerging therapeutic strategy. To explore the role of chronic PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in HF pathogenesis and treatment, we generated a knockin mouse with aspartic acid replacing serine 2808 (mice are referred to herein as RyR2-S2808D+/+ mice). This mutation mimics constitutive PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2, which causes depletion of the stabilizing subunit FKBP12.6 (also known as calstabin2), resulting in leaky RyR2. RyR2-S2808D+/+ mice developed age-dependent cardiomyopathy, elevated RyR2 oxidation and nitrosylation, reduced SR Ca2+ store content, and increased diastolic SR Ca2+ leak. After myocardial infarction, RyR2-S2808D+/+ mice exhibited increased mortality compared with WT littermates. Treatment with S107, a 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative that stabilizes RyR2-calstabin2 interactions, inhibited the RyR2-mediated diastolic SR Ca2+ leak and reduced HF progression in WT and RyR2-S2808D+/+ mice. In contrast, \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockers improved cardiac function in WT but not in RyR2-S2808D+/+ mice.Thus, chronic PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 results in a diastolic leak that causes cardiac dysfunction.

Compared with PGC-1\u03b1-a mRNA, PGC-1\u03b1-b or PGC-1\u03b1-c mRNA is transcribed by a different exon 1 of the PGC-1\u03b1 gene. In this study, effects of exercise intensity and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1\u03b2-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) on isoform-specific expressions of PGC-1\u03b1 were investigated. All isoforms were increased in proportion to exercise intensity of treadmill running (10-30 m/min for 30 min). Preinjection of \u03b2\u2082-adrenergic receptor (AR) antagonist (ICI 118551) inhibited the increase in PGC-1\u03b1-b and PGC-1\u03b1-c mRNAs, but not the increase in PGC-1\u03b1-a mRNA, in response to high-intensity exercise. Although high-intensity exercise activated \u03b12-AMP-activated protein kinase (\u03b12-AMPK) in skeletal muscles, inactivation of \u03b12-AMPK activity did not affect high-intensity exercise-induced mRNA expression of all PGC-1\u03b1 isoforms, suggesting that activation of \u03b12-AMPK is not mandatory for an increase in PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA by high-intensity exercise. A single injection in mice of AICAR, an AMPK activator, increased mRNAs of all PGC-1\u03b1 isoforms. AICAR increased blood catecholamine concentrations, and preinjection of \u03b2\u2082-AR antagonist inhibited the increase in PGC-1\u03b1-b and PGC-1\u03b1-c mRNAs but not the increase in PGC-1\u03b1-a mRNA. Direct exposure of epitrochlearis muscle to AICAR increased PGC-1\u03b1-a but not the -b isoform. These data indicate that exercise-induced PGC-1\u03b1 expression was dependent on the intensity of exercise. Exercise or AICAR injection increased PGC-1\u03b1-b and PGC-1\u03b1-c mRNAs via \u03b2\u2082-AR activation, whereas high-intensity exercise increased PGC-1\u03b1-a expression by a multiple mechanism in which \u03b12-AMPK is one of the signaling pathways.",

Because activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs) strongly enhances the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region, we examined whether activation of these receptors also had metaplastic effects on LTP induction. Our results show that activation of \u03b2-ARs induces a protein synthesis-dependent form of metaplasticity that primes the future induction of late-phase LTP by a subthreshold stimulus. \u03b2-AR activation also induced a long-lasting increase in phosphorylation of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) GluA1 subunits at a protein kinase A (PKA) site (S845) and transiently activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Consistent with this, inhibitors of PKA and ERK blocked the metaplastic effects of \u03b2-AR activation. \u03b2-AR activation also induced a prolonged, translation-dependent increase in cell surface levels of GluA1 subunit-containing AMPA receptors. Our results indicate that \u03b2-ARs can modulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity by priming synapses for the future induction of late-phase LTP through up-regulation of translational processes, one consequence of which is the trafficking of AMPARs to the cell surface.",

An ECG dataset that contained recordings from patients under control and sotalol condition was analyzed. In order to relate sotalol-induced ECG changes to its effect on ion channel level, i.e., blockade of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium channel (I(Kr)), varied degrees of I(Kr) blockade were simulated in a slab of ventricular tissue. The mean JT area increased by 36.5% following the administration of sotalol in patients. Simulations in the slab tissue showed that sotalol increased action potential duration preferentially in the midmyocardium, which led to increased transmural dispersion of repolarization and JT area. In conclusion, JT area reflects the transmural dispersion of repolarization and may be a potentially useful surrogate/supplemental ECG biomarker to assess drug safety.",

    "170": "Improvements are needed in following guidelines for basic interventions such as body mass assessment, accurate BP measurement, use of thiazide diuretics and lifestyle advice. BP control is inadequate.", 
    "171": "Portal hypertension is a cause a major luminal gut hemorrhage, most often from esophageal varices. Identification of those with varices, and administration of therapies to reduce the likelihood of initial bleeding improve patient outcomes. Beta blocker therapy or variceal band ligation are most often used in this context. Management of acute variceal hemorrhage (including routine use of antibiotics) is followed by initiating strategies to reduce the frequency of recurrent bleeding. Mortality from portal hypertensive bleeding has been diminished by use of these interventions.", 
    "172": "We investigated the effects of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) activation on GABAergic synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal neurons. Current-clamp recordings revealed that methacholine produced membrane depolarization and action potential firing. Methacholine augmented the bicuculline-sensitive and GABA(A) -mediated frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs); the action of methacholine had a slow onset and longer duration. The increase in methacholine-evoked sIPSCs was completely inhibited by atropine and was insensitive to glutamatergic receptor blockers. Interestingly, methacholine action was not inhibited by intracellular perfusion with GDP-\u03b2-S, suggesting that muscarinic effects on membrane excitability and sIPSC frequency are mainly presynaptic. McN-A-343 and pirenzepine, selective agonist and antagonist of the m1 mAChR subtype, respectively, neither enhanced sIPSCs nor inhibited the methacholine effect. However, the m3-m5 mAChR antagonist 4-DAMP, and the m2-m4 mAChR antagonist himbacine inhibited the methacholine effect. U73122, an IP(3) production inhibitor, and 2APB, an IP(3) receptor blocker, drastically decreased the methacholine effect. Recording of miniature events revealed that besides the effect exerted by methacholine on membrane firing properties and sIPSC frequency, muscarinic receptors also enhanced the frequency of mIPSCs with no effect on their amplitude, possibly modulating the molecular machinery subserving vesicle docking and fusion and suggesting a tight colocalization at the active zone of the presynaptic terminals. These data strongly suggest that by activating presynaptic m2, m3, m4 and m5 mAChRs, methacholine can increase membrane excitability and enhance efficiency in the GABA release machinery, perhaps through a mechanism involving the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum.", 
    "173": "Psoriasis is a common skin disorder; knowledge of the factors that may induce, trigger, or exacerbate the disease is of primary importance in clinical practice. Drug intake is a major concern in this respect, as new drugs are constantly being added to the list of factors that may influence the course of this disease. Drug ingestion may result in exacerbation of pre-existing psoriasis, in induction of psoriatic lesions on clinically uninvolved skin in patients with psoriasis, or in precipitation of the disease in persons without family history of psoriasis or in predisposed individuals. In view of their relationship to drug-provoked psoriasis, therapeutic agents may be classified as drugs with strong evidence for a causal relationship to psoriasis, drugs about which there are considerable but insufficient data to support the induction or aggravation of the disease, and drugs that are occasionally reported to be associated with aggravation or induction. This review focuses on the most common causative agents for drug-induced, drug-triggered, or drug-aggravated psoriasis, such as \u03b2-blockers, lithium, synthetic antimalarial drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and tetracyclines, and the mechanisms of action of these drugs in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.", 
    "174": "Myocardial automatism and arrhythmias may ensue during strong sympathetic stimulation. We sought to investigate the relevant types of adrenoceptor, as well as the role of phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity, in the production of catecholaminergic automatism in atrial and ventricular rat myocardium.", 
    "175": "The effects of adrenoceptor agonists on the rate of spontaneous contractions (automatic response) and the amplitude of electrically evoked contractions (inotropic response) were determined in left atria and ventricular myocytes isolated from Wistar rats.", 
    "176": "Catecholaminergic automatism was Ca(2+) -dependent, as it required a functional sarcoplasmic reticulum to be exhibited. Although both \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoceptor activation caused inotropic stimulation, only \u03b2(1) -adrenoceptors seemed to mediate the induction of spontaneous activity. Catecholaminergic automatism was enhanced and suppressed by \u03b2(2) -adrenoceptor blockade and stimulation respectively. Inhibition of either PDE3 or PDE4 (by milrinone and rolipram, respectively) potentiated the automatic response of myocytes to catecholamines. However, only rolipram abolished the attenuation of automatism produced by \u03b2(2) -adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "177": "\u03b1- and \u03b2(2) -adrenoceptors do not seem to be involved in the mediation of catecholaminergic stimulation of spontaneous activity in atrial and ventricular myocardium. However, a functional antagonism of \u03b2(1) - and \u03b2(2) -adrenoceptor activation was identified, the former mediating catecholaminergic myocardial automatism and the latter attenuating this effect. Results suggest that hydrolysis of cAMP by PDE4 is involved in the protective effect mediated by \u03b2(2) -adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "178": "The purpose of this study was to verify the occurrence of pigment dispersion in retinal pigment cells exposed to UVA and UVB radiation, and to investigate the possible participation of a nitric oxide (NO) pathway. Retinal pigment cells from Neohelice granulata were obtained by cellular dissociation. Cells were analyzed for 30\u2003min in the dark (control) and then exposed to 1.1 and 3.3\u2003J\u2003cm(-2) UVA, 0.07 and 0.9\u2003J\u2003cm(-2) UVB, 20\u2003nm\u03b2-PDH (pigment dispersing hormone) or 10\u2003\u03bcm SIN-1 (NO donor). Histological analyses were performed to verify the UV effect in vivo. Cultured cells were exposed to 250\u2003\u03bcm L-NAME (NO synthase blocker) and afterwards were treated with UVA, UVB or \u03b2-PDH. The retinal cells in culture displayed significant pigment dispersion in response to UVA, UVB and \u03b2-PDH. The same responses to UVA and UVB were observed in vivo. SIN-1 did not induce pigment dispersion in the cell cultures. L-NAME significantly decreased the pigment dispersion induced by UVA and UVB but not by \u03b2-PDH. All retinal cells showed an immunopositive reaction against neuronal nitric oxide synthases. Therefore, UVA and UVB radiation are capable of inducing pigment dispersion in retinal pigment cells of Neohelice granulata and this dispersion may be nitric oxide synthase dependent.", 
    "179": "Glaucoma is a group of progressive optic neuropathies in which the axons in the optic nerve are injured, retinal ganglion cell numbers are reduced and vision is gradually and permanently lost. The only approved and effective way to treat glaucoma is to reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP). This is usually accomplished by surgical and/or pharmacological means. Drugs designed to reduce IOP target one or more of the parameters that maintain it. These parameters (collectively known as aqueous humor dynamics) are the production rate of aqueous humor, the pressure in the episcleral veins and the drainage of aqueous humor through the trabecular or uveoscleral outflow pathways. Intraocular pressure lowering drugs can be classified as inflow or outflow depending on whether they reduce aqueous humor inflow into the anterior chamber or improve aqueous humor outflow from the anterior chamber. Inflow drugs, like \u03b2 adrenergic antagonists and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, reduce the rate of aqueous humor production. Outflow drugs, like prostaglandin analogs, cholinergic agonists and sympathomimetics, increase the rate of drainage through the uveoscleral outflow pathway and/or increase the facility of outflow through the trabecular meshwork. Some drugs have mixed inflow/outflow effects. This review summarizes the pharmacological treatments for glaucoma in use today and some new drugs showing potential for use in the future.", 
    "180": "Not all blood pressure (BP)-lowering agents have the same effect on central BP, but we know that central BP, in itself, is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, antihypertensive agents should ideally also have a central BP-lowering effect. In this paper the authors evaluate the effect of adding a calcium channel blocker to a \u03b2-blocker. The results show this combination does not reverse the lesser effect of \u03b2-blockers on central BP, and that the combination of valsartan plus amlodipine is more effective in lowering central BP than a combination of amlodipine plus atenolol."
