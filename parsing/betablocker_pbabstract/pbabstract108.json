    "0": "The importance of heart rate in human health and disease has been well known to clinicians for quite some time. Recent epidemiologic studies have further strengthened this concept. Modulation of heart rate by pharmacologic as well as non-pharmacologic means has affected cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in various trials and observational studies. Conventional rate-control agents, such as \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists (\u03b2-blockers), calcium channel blockers, and digoxin, have contributed greatly to the management of various diseases where heart-rate reduction is required; however, these agents have effects beyond rate control that may be unacceptable. Ivabradine has recently been recognized as a pure heart-rate-reducing agent and is being extensively studied. It is the latest addition to the class of drugs used to control angina. It is indicated in cases of \u03b2-blocker intolerance or when \u03b2-blockers fail to achieve a heart rate of <60\u2009beats/min. The pure heart-rate-reducing effect of ivabradine has also been reported in smaller studies and anecdotal case reports. The theoretical possibilities of the utility of ivabradine are many and have opened up a whole new field of research for the future. The BEAUTIFUL trial enrolled approximately 10,000 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and left ventricular dysfunction, with the aim of assessing the effect of ivabradine versus atenolol on various cardiovascular outcomes. Although ivabradine failed to achieve favorable results for primary endpoints, it appeared effective in achieving a favorable secondary endpoint in a subgroup of patients who had a heart rate of >70\u2009beats/min. Other large trials are also underway to assess the effects of ivabradine on heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, CAD, and other cardiovascular disorders. In this review, we discuss the pharmacologic basis of the action of ivabradine and its role in angina control, as well as in other conditions being actively studied or in which a role for ivabradine has been hypothesized.",

There is high pressure to develop new drugs to prevent and treat ROP. There is increasing enthusiasm for anti-VEGF drugs, but angiogenic inhibitors selective for abnormal blood vessels would be considered as an optimal treatment.In an animal experimental model of proliferative retinopathy, we have recently demonstrated that the pharmacological blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors improves retinal neovascularization and blood retinal barrier breakdown consequent to hypoxia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the propranolol administration in preterm newborns suffering from a precocious phase of ROP in terms of safety and efficacy in counteracting the progression of retinopathy.", 
    "2": "Preterm newborns (gestational age at birth lower than 32 weeks) with stage 2 ROP (zone II-III without plus) will be randomized, according to their gestational age, to receive propranolol added to standard treatment (treatment adopted by the ETROP Cooperative Group) or standard treatment alone. Propranolol will be administered until retinal vascularization will be completely developed, but not more than 90 days. Forty-four participants will be recruited into the study. To evaluate the safety of propranolol administration, cardiac and respiratory parameters will be continuously monitored. Blood samplings will be performed to check renal, liver and metabolic balance. To evaluate the efficacy of propranolol, the progression of the disease, the number of laser treatments or vitrectomies, the incidence of retinal detachment or blindness, will be evaluated by serial ophthalmologic examinations. Visual function will be evaluated by means of behavioural standardized tests.",

The initial presentations were sudden onset of spontaneous knee swelling and painful sensation accompanied by limitation of joint movement. The patient had a history of recurrent swelling with spontaneous remission over the same location in the past year. In addition, diffuse cutaneous hemangioma since infancy was also noted. Synovial involvement of a cutaneous hemangioma was confirmed by multidetector computed tomography and arthroscopy. The patient was started on oral corticosteroid and \u03b2-blocker.

    "6": "Cardiac complications are an infrequent yet undesirable cause of morbidity and mortality following total knee arthroplasty. Perioperative prophylaxis with beta-blocker medication has been shown to reduce in-hospital cardiac deaths in noncardiac surgical patients. This study evaluated the safety and in-hospital cardiac complications of a consecutive cohort of 267 total knee arthroplasties in patients who followed a perioperative beta-blocker prophylaxis institutional protocol. The patients were categorized into three groups: A, already on a beta-blocker; B, beta-blocker prescribed by orthopaedic surgeon; and C, not given the medication. The 90-day mortality and in-hospital cardiac complications were evaluated. Of the patients who had 267 procedures, 203 (76%) received beta-blocker prophylaxis perioperatively: 110 (41.2%) were already on the medication preoperatively, 93 (34.8%) were prescribed the medication by the surgeon, and 64 (24%) did not receive this medication. There were no deaths within the first 90 days. There were two nonfatal myocardial infarctions (0.7%) and six other cardiac complications (2.2%). With a beta-blocker prophylaxis protocol implemented by one surgeon, 76% of total knee arthroplasty patients were given the medication and it was prescribed in 34.8% by the orthopaedic surgeon. In-hospital cardiac complications were low.", 
    "7": "The necessity of haemangioma treatment in infants has been controversially discussed for years. One reason is the favoured clinical observation of a potential spontaneous involution without any therapeutic approach or medical treatment, thus avoiding their specific risks. On the other hand, there are several reports on serious cases with -rapidly growing haemangiomas including severe consequences. There are potential complications such as loss of visus in cases of periorbital manifestation. A basic problem is the lack of a unique systematic classification, on the basis of which -diagnostic measures, therapeutic indications and modes could be compared. Such a classification would be much more competent including a sufficient comparison of treatment results. The basic aim in management is to achieve control of the haemangioma growth and induction of its sub-sequent involution back to only a cosmetic detraction. Each threatening functional loss can be classified as an urgent indication for treatment. There is a need to consider the treatment options and their values; in particular, cryotherapy or laser therapy in localised manifestations are mostly -favoured because of the convincing evidence from available data. In the case of a more disseminated haemangioma manifestation, the initiation of propranol medication is possible, a novel drug for this indication. However, there are no follow-up data on the mid-term or long-term outcome available at this time. Further studies on the subject are therefore required.", 
    "8": "Variceal hemorrhage is one of the leading causes of death in patients with cirrhosis, with the 6-week mortality after each episode ranging from 15% to 20%. The two main strategies for primary prevention of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and varices are the administration of nonselective \u03b2-blockers or the obliteration of varices with use of endoscopic band ligation. In this review, we present and critically review the latest data on primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage. We advocate that nonselective \u03b2-blockers should be the first line therapy, and band ligation should be offered only in cases of intolerance or side effects. We also explore potential future therapies based on preliminary experimental and clinical data.",

In coronary CT angiography, image quality is highly dependent on heart rate, with heart rate reduction to less than 60 beats per minute being important for both image quality and radiation dose reduction, especially when single-source CT scanners are used. \u03b2-Blockers are the first-line option for short-term reduction of heart rate prior to coronary CT angiography. In recent years, multiple \u03b2-blocker administration protocols with oral and/or intravenous application have been proposed. This review article provides an overview of the indications, efficacy, and safety of \u03b2-blockade protocols prior to coronary CT angiography with respect to different scanner techniques.

    "15": "We evaluated 16 pregnant women with gestational age between 20 and 32 weeks in acute severe hypertension which were randomly allocated to receive either hydralazine or labetalol. Blood pressure and Doppler ultrasound parameters from maternal uterine and fetal middle cerebral and umbilical arteries were assessed during acute severe hypertension and after treatment. A significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in both groups. A significant change in Doppler parameters was observed only in pregnant women who received hydralazine: an increase in uterine arteries resistance index. We concluded that both drugs were highly effective in reducing blood pressure in these women. Despite the observed increase in resistance index of uterine arteries associated with hydralazine, the use of hydralazine and labetalol were not related to any significant changes in fetal Doppler, which is reassuring about the safety of these drugs when treating acute severe hypertension in pregnancy.", 
    "16": "Several previous studies revealed that pharmaceuticals with aliphatic amine function exhibit a higher toxicity toward algae than toward other aquatic organisms. Here we investigated the pH-dependent toxicity of the five basic pharmaceuticals fluoxetine, its metabolite norfluoxetine, propranolol, lidocaine, and trimipramine. For all of them, the toxicity increased with increasing pH when aqueous effect concentrations were considered. Since these pharmaceuticals contain a basic amine group that is protonated and thus positively charged at physiological pH and because algae are capable of biological homeostasis, i.e., pH inside the algal cell remains virtually independent of variable external pH, the speciation of aliphatic amines can be different inside the algal cell compared to the external medium. Therefore, we hypothesized that the high toxicity of aliphatic amines in algae is a toxicokinetic effect caused by speciation and not a toxicodynamic effect caused by a specific mode of toxic action. This hypothesis also implies that internal effect concentrations are independent on external pH. On this basis we developed a simple toxicokinetic model, which assumes that only the neutral molecule is bioavailable and can pass the plasma membrane. This assumption is likely to be valid at pH values down to two units below the acidity constant (pK(a)). For lower pH values a more complex model would have to be evoked that includes, an, albeit smaller, permeability of the charged species. For pH>pK(a)-2, we can safely assume that the outer membrane serves as insulator and that the charged species is formed inside the cell according to the pH in the cytoplasm. Thus this toxicokinetic model is an ion-trapping model. The input parameters of this model are the measured aqueous effect concentrations determined as a function of pH and the membrane-water partitioning, which was modelled by the liposome-water partition coefficients of the neutral and cationic species. They were deduced from experimentally determined liposome-water distribution ratios at various pH values measured with an equilibrium dialysis method. The modelled internal effect concentrations were independent of the external pH and effective membrane burdens were in the same range as for other baseline toxicants found in the literature for algae, daphnids and fish. These results confirm that the higher algal toxicity of pharmaceuticals with an aliphatic amine group can be explained by a toxicokinetic effect and that these pharmaceuticals do not exhibit a specific mode of action in algae but act as baseline toxicants.", 
    "17": "Our objective was to evaluate immediate acute changes in myocardial function during the autonomic storm of brain death (BD). Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n = 8/group): controls without any treatment, \u03b2-blocker (Esmolol\u00ae, 10 mg/kg), calcium channel blocker (Diltiazem\u00ae, 10 mg/kg), or alpha-blocker (Prazosin\u00ae, 0.3 mg/kg). Treatments were administered intravenously 5 min before BD induction. Echocardiography (ATL-5000, 8 MHz) was performed to measure left ventricular (LV) dimensions and fractional shortening at baseline, during BD induction and 5 min and 15 min after BD. In controls, BD was immediately associated with an increase in wall thickness and a decrease in LV cavity dimension. This myocardial wall hypertrophy was completely prevented by \u03b2-blockers, but not with calcium- and alpha-blockers. Extensive myocardial interstitial edema was found in all groups, except in the \u03b2-blocker group. Myocardial wall hypertrophy was also prevented during a longer follow-up of 180 min after BD in \u03b2-blocker group as opposed to controls. In conclusion, BD is associated with an immediate and severe myocardial damage related to an important interstitial edema which is prevented by \u03b2-blockers.",

    "40": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest family of signaling receptors expressed in the CNS, mediate the neuropsychiatric effects of a diverse range of clinically relevant drugs. It is increasingly clear that GPCRs can activate distinct G protein-dependent and -independent transduction pathway(s), and that certain drugs differ in the ability to regulate distinct signaling mechanisms linked to the same receptors. A fundamental question in neuropharmacology is whether such \"biased agonism\" occurs in physiologically relevant neurons and with endogenous receptors. Here we show that propranolol and carvedilol, two \u03b2-blocker drugs that inhibit \u03b2-adrenergic signaling via heterotrimeric G proteins, function in hippocampal pyramidal neurons as potent and selective activators of an alternate receptor-linked calcium signaling pathway mediated by \u03b2-arrestin-2 and ERK1/2. Our results support the emerging view of \u03b2-arrestin-biased agonism as a significant mechanism of drug action and do so in CNS-derived neurons expressing only native receptors.",

The LMOG comprised a self-assembled fibrillar gel of trans-(1S,2S)-1,2-bis-(dodecylamido) cyclohexane in methanol. The di-L-valinol-copper complex exhibited the best performance on LMOG-CE compared with all other \u03b2-amino alcohol-copper selectors. The dependence of chiral resolution on the pH*, the ratio between the copper and the L-valinol ligand and the concentration of added selector complex in the run buffer were investigated revealing a marked difference between the activity of the copper-valinol and the previously studied copper-valine selector. The optimal separation conditions were achieved using a 2:1 valinol/copper ratio, in accordance with the 2:1 structure of the complex, which was proven by single crystal and powder X-ray diffractions and by elemental analysis. Unlike the copper-valine selectors that could be used only under acidic conditions (pH* 3.5), the copper-valinol selectors could be used under near-neutral conditions and even at pH* 9.1. A comparison between SDS-micellar electrokinetic chromatography and LMOG-CE under otherwise identical conditions revealed a significant superior separation on the LMOG-filled capillaries.", 
    "42": "The role of nitric oxide (NO) derived from all three NO synthases (NOSs) in renal lesion formation remains to be fully elucidated. We addressed this point in mice lacking all NOSs. Renal injury was induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). UUO caused significant renal lesion formation (tubular apoptosis, interstitial fibrosis, and glomerulosclerosis) in wild-type, singly, and triply NOS(-/-) mice. However, the extents of renal lesion formation were markedly and most accelerated in the triply NOS(-/-) genotype. UUO also elicited the infiltration of inflammatory macrophages, up-regulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, and induction of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in all of the genotypes; however, the extents were again largest by far in the triply NOS(-/-) genotype. Importantly, long-term treatment with the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1))-receptor blocker olmesartan significantly prevented the exacerbation of those renal structural changes after UUO in the triply NOS(-/-) genotype, along with amelioration of the macrophage infiltration, TGF-\u03b21 levels, and EMT. These results provide the first evidence that the complete disruption of all NOS genes results in markedly accelerated renal lesion formation in response to UUO in mice in vivo through the AT(1)-receptor pathway, demonstrating the critical renoprotective role of all NOSs-derived NO against pathological renal remodeling.", 
    "43": "Acute hyperadrenergic stressor states are accompanied by cation dyshomeostasis, together with the release of cardiac troponins predictive of necrosis. The signal-transducer-effector pathway accounting for this pathophysiological scenario remains unclear. We hypothesized that a dyshomeostasis of extra- and intracellular Ca2+ and Zn2+ occurs in rats in response to isoproterenol (Isop) including excessive intracellular Ca2+ accumulation (EICA) and mitochondrial [Ca2+]m-induced oxidative stress. Contemporaneously, the selective translocation of Ca2+ and Zn2+ to tissues contributes to their fallen plasma levels. Rats received a single subcutaneous injection of Isop (1 mg/kg body wt). Other groups of rats received pretreatment for 10 days with either carvedilol (C), a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist with mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter-inhibiting properties, or quercetin (Q), a flavonoid with mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant properties, before Isop. We monitored temporal responses in the following: [Ca2+] and [Zn2+] in plasma, left ventricular (LV) apex, equator and base, skeletal muscle, liver, spleen, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), indices of oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, and myocardial fibrosis. We found ionized hypocalcemia and hypozincemia attributable to their tissue translocation and also a heterogeneous distribution of these cations among tissues with a preferential Ca2+ accumulation in the LV apex, muscle, and PBMC, whereas Zn2+ declined except in liver, where it increased corresponding with upregulation of metallothionein, a Zn2+-binding protein. EICA was associated with a simultaneous increase in tissue 8-isoprostane and increased [Ca2+]m accompanied by a rise in H2O2 generation, mPTP opening, and scarring, each of which were prevented by either C or Q. Thus excessive [Ca2+]m, coupled with the induction of oxidative stress and increased mPTP opening, suggests that this signal-transducer-effector pathway is responsible for Isop-induced cardiomyocyte necrosis at the LV apex.",

Pharmacokinetics of the parent drug were investigated over 120 h, urinary and plasma metabolites up to 192 h post-dose. \u00b9\u2074C-(S)-ralfinamide was rapidly and completely absorbed. Ralfinamide and the dealkylated ralfinamide metabolite (NW-1716) represented the majority of plasma radioactivity. Plasma elimination of the parent compound occurred mono-exponentially (half-life approx. 15 h). \u00b9\u2074C-radioactivity was eliminated in a bi-phasic manner (terminal half-life of 60 and 24 h for plasma and whole blood, respectively). Plasma-concentrations of unchanged ralfinamide were significantly lower than radioactivity concentrations, indicating metabolism of the parent compound. At 192 h post-dose the total balance of radioactivity was almost complete (95%). The main route of excretion was via the kidneys (94% of the dose). Major metabolites identified in urine and plasma were the N-dealkylated acid of ralfinamide and deaminated ralfinamide acid (NW-1799). Other metabolites, in particular the product of glucuronide conjugation N-dealkylated-\u03b2-glucuronide, were identified.",

    "53": "Astrocytomas and glioblastomas have been particularly difficult to treat and refractory to chemotherapy. However, significant evidence has been presented that demonstrates a decrease in astrocytoma cell proliferation subsequent to an increase in cAMP levels. The 1321N1 astrocytoma cell line, as well as other astrocytomas and glioblastomas, expresses \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2(2)-ARs) that are coupled to G(s) activation and consequent cAMP production. Experiments were conducted to determine whether the \u03b2(2)-AR agonist (R,R')-fenoterol and other \u03b2(2)-AR agonists could attenuate mitogenesis and, if so, by what mechanism. Receptor binding studies were conducted to characterize \u03b2(2)-AR found in 1321N1 and U118 cell membranes. In addition, cells were incubated with (R,R')-fenoterol and analogs to determine their ability to stimulate intracellular cAMP accumulation and inhibit [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into the cells. 1321N1 cells contain significant levels of \u03b2(2)-AR as determined by receptor binding. (R,R')-fenoterol and other \u03b2(2)-AR agonists, as well as forskolin, stimulated cAMP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. Accumulation of cAMP induced a decrease in [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. There was a correlation between concentration required to stimulate cAMP accumulation and inhibit [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. U118 cells have a reduced number of \u03b2(2)-ARs and a concomitant reduction in the ability of \u03b2(2)-AR agonists to inhibit cell proliferation. These studies demonstrate the efficacy of \u03b2(2)-AR agonists for inhibition of growth of the astrocytoma cell lines. Because a significant portion of brain tumors contain \u03b2(2)-ARs to a greater extent than whole brain, (R,R')-fenoterol, or some analog, may be useful in the treatment of brain tumors after biopsy to determine \u03b2(2)-AR expression.",

Differential scanning calorimetry measurements of the complexes have shown no reversibility of thermal denaturation as indicated by the three observed peaks and the opposite role that acebutolol plays in the folding different domains of the fibrinogen molecule and the stability of such domains. While circular dichroism measurements have revealed that interaction of acebutolol with fibrinogen affects the protein secondary structure to a different extent depending on the temperature and drug concentration, dynamic light scattering analysis showed evidence for protein aggregation mainly to tetramers and dimers.",

Morphine- or DAMGO-induced \u03bcOR endocytosis resulted from direct interactions between the ligand and the \u03bcOR because endocytosis was not affected by tetrodotoxin, a blocker of endogenous neurotransmitter release. Ligand-induced \u03bcOR internalization was inhibited by pretreatment with the dynamin inhibitor, dynasore. Chronic morphine administration resulted in a significant increase and translocation of dynamin immunoreactivity from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane, but did not affect \u03b2-arrestin immunoreactivity.",

    "59": "In the field of traumatic stress, chemoprophylaxis is a term that is often used but rarely well understood. There has been no shortage of debate on the issue, but few rigorous studies to ground the discussion. The purpose of the current paper is to explore the issues surrounding this contentious area. Databases including PubMed, PsychArticles and Web of Knowledge were searched using the key words 'chemo or pharmaco', 'prevention or prophylaxis', and 'PTSD or post-traumatic stress'. Relevant journals and reference lists of the papers obtained through this search were scanned for additional references. Studies that investigated the use of pharmacotherapy to prevent the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder were considered for this paper. Studies that examined the treatment of established PTSD were excluded. A total of 15 empirical studies were included in the review (including five randomized controlled trials), and twice as many non-data-driven papers. Evidence for the prophylactic use of alcohol, morphine, propranolol, and hydrocortisone is presented, followed by a discussion of the many challenges of using pharmacological interventions in this context. While attention to this issue has increased in recent times, the dearth of empirical data has done little to further the field. Larger studies are indicated following small trials with medications such as propranolol and hydrocortisone. There remain a number of ethical and practical questions to be answered before the widespread use of chemoprophylaxis can be recommended.",

However, recent studies have questioned the utility of \u03b2-blockers in the emergency department in these patients. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence behind the use of \u03b2-blockers in the emergency department for STEMI patients.", 
    "61": "Activation of pudendal afferents can evoke bladder contraction or relaxation dependent on the frequency of stimulation, but the mechanisms of reflex bladder excitation evoked by pudendal afferent stimulation are unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the contributions of sympathetic and parasympathetic mechanisms to bladder contractions evoked by stimulation of the dorsal nerve of the penis (DNP) in \u03b1-chloralose anesthetized adult male cats. Bladder contractions were evoked by DNP stimulation only above a bladder volume threshold equal to 73 \u00b1 12% of the distension-evoked reflex contraction volume threshold. Bilateral hypogastric nerve transection (to eliminate sympathetic innervation of the bladder) or administration of propranolol (a \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist) decreased the stimulation-evoked and distension-evoked volume thresholds by -25% to -39%. Neither hypogastric nerve transection nor propranolol affected contraction magnitude, and robust bladder contractions were still evoked by stimulation at volume thresholds below the distension-evoked volume threshold. As well, inhibition of distention-evoked reflex bladder contractions by 10 Hz stimulation of the DNP was preserved following bilateral hypogastric nerve transection. Administration of phentolamine (an \u03b1-adrenergic antagonist) increased stimulation-evoked and distension-evoked volume thresholds by 18%, but again, robust contractions were still evoked by stimulation at volumes below the distension-evoked threshold. These results indicate that sympathetic mechanisms contribute to establishing the volume dependence of reflex contractions but are not critical to the excitatory pudendal to bladder reflex. A strong correlation between the magnitude of stimulation-evoked bladder contractions and bladder volume supports that convergence of pelvic afferents and pudendal afferents is responsible for bladder excitation evoked by pudendal afferents. Further, abolition of stimulation-evoked bladder contractions following administration of hexamethonium bromide confirmed that contractions were generated by pelvic efferent activation via the pelvic ganglion. These findings indicate that pudendal afferent stimulation evokes bladder contractions through convergence with pelvic afferents to increase pelvic efferent activity.",

Atenolol was used as an active pharmaceutical ingredient, ethylcellulose as a matrix former, microcrystalline cellulose as a filler and disodium phosphate anhydrous and trisodium phosphate dodecahydrate as alkalizing materials. Water and a water-ethanol mixture served as granulation liquids. Pellet formation was evaluated via mechanical, dissolution and morphological studies. In order to enhance the dissolution of Atenolol from the pellets, alkalizing components were used and the influence of these components on the pH was tested. Investigations of the breaking hardness, the morphology and the dissolution revealed that the pellets containing trisodium phosphate dodecahydrate and prepared with a higher amount of water as binding liquid displayed the best physico-chemical parameters and uniform dissolution. In in vitro experiments, the dissolution release complied with the texture of the pellets and the effect of pH. The pellets have suitable shape and very good hardness for the coating process and are appropriate for subsequent in vivo experiments.", 
    "63": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is a genetic disorder that is characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and structural abnormalities of the right ventricle. Due to significant heterogeneity in its manifestation, the diagnosis of ARVD is challenging and requires a multifaceted approach to patient evaluation. It is important to not rush and diagnose ARVD prematurely, as the implications both for the patient and also for family members are enormous. Similarly, it is important for clinicians to be aware of this condition because it is potentially life threatening. There are three keys aspects to treatment once a diagnosis is established. The first issue concerns risk stratification and deciding whether to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). We currently advise ICD implantation for probands who meet the full criteria for the disease, especially if they have experienced cardiac syncope, sustained ventricular tachycardia, or have severe right ventricular or left ventricular dysfunction. In addition, we feel there are sufficient observational clinical data and scientific data from animal models to advise that both competitive sports and high-level athletics be prohibited. We advise our patients to generally limit their activity to activities such as walking and golf. Finally, it is our opinion that most patients with ARVD should be treated with both a \u03b2-blocker as well as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, provided these drugs are well tolerated.",

Different non-ionic surfactants; polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, namely Brij 78, Brij 92, and Brij 72; and sorbitan fatty acid esters (Span 60) were evaluated for their applicability in preparation of CAR proniosomal gels. A 2(3) full factorial design was employed to evaluate individual and combined effects of formulation variables, namely cholesterol content, weight of proniosomes, and amount of CAR added on performance of proniosomes. Prepared proniosomes were evaluated regarding entrapment efficiency (EE%), vesicle size, and microscopic examination. Also, CAR release through cellulose membrane and permeation through hairless mice skin were investigated. Proniosomes prepared with Brij 72 and Span 60 showed better niosome forming ability and higher EE% than those prepared with Brij 78 and Brij 92. Higher EE% was obtained by increasing both weight of proniosomes and amount of CAR added, and decreasing cholesterol content. Release rate through cellulose membrane was inversely affected by weight of proniosomes. In Span 60 proniosomes, on increasing percent of cholesterol, a decrease in release rate was observed. While in Brij 72 proniosomes, an enhancement in release rate was observed on increasing amount of CAR added. Permeation experiments showed that skin permeation was mainly affected by weight of proniosomes and that Span 60 proniosomal gels showed higher permeation enhancing effect than Brij 72. Proniosomal gel could constitute a promising approach for transdermal delivery of CAR.",

A higher proportion of patients in the atropine group achieved the target HR compared to the placebo group (60% versus 3%, p<0.0001). SPECT imaging was abnormal in a higher proportion of patients in the atropine group as compared to the placebo group (57% versus 42%, p<0.05). Stress-induced myocardial ischaemia was present in more patients in the atropine group as compared to placebo (47% versus 29%, p<0.01). In both groups of patients, no major side effects occurred.", 
    "72": "The addition of atropine at the end of exercise testing is more effective than placebo in raising HR to adequate levels, without additional risks of complications.

    "73": "Arterial generalized transfer functions (GTFs) are increasingly used to estimate central pressure from peripheral measurements. Analysis of derived central waveforms may be valuable in the assessment of patients with chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to assess whether the GTF is affected by renal disease. Ninety-four subjects with varying degrees of renal function (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative stages 1 to 5; 14 controls) had simultaneous measurements of carotid and radial waveforms made by applanation tonometry. GTFs were calculated by Fourier analysis for each subject group. Derived carotid waveforms were obtained by applying an independently generated GTF to the radial waveform. Glomerular filtration rate inversely correlated with central systolic (R = -0.42; P < 0.001), mean (R = -0.34; P < 0.01) and diastolic (R = --0.27, P < 0.01) blood pressures, as well as central augmentation index (R = -0.30; P< 0.01) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (R = -0.33; P < 0.001). Derived waveforms were not significantly different from measured waveforms in terms of systolic blood pressure, augmentation index, maximum slope, or the delay between the incident and reflected waves, although the derived waveforms slightly underestimated the systolic ejection period (-4.4 \u00b1 0.9 ms; P < 0.001). Overall root-mean-square error was 2.4 \u00b1 0.1 mm Hg. No significant relationship existed between the degree of bias of any derived waveform measure and glomerular filtration rate or chronic kidney disease stage (P > 0.16). No significant differences between chronic kidney disease stages were observed in transfer function gain or phase (P > 0.05). We conclude that the peripheral-to-central GTF is not affected by degree of renal dysfunction and can be used with equivalence in patients with varying degrees of chronic kidney disease.",

Organics are mainly oxidized with hydroxyl radical (OH) formed from Fenton's reaction between added Fe(2+) and electrogenerated H(2)O(2). The PEF treatment in Pt/ADE-Pt/CF system yields almost total mineralization because OH production is enhanced by Fe(2+) regeneration from Fe(3+) reduction at the CF cathode and Fe(III) complexes with generated carboxylic acids are rapidly photodecarboxylated under UVA irradiation. Lower mineralization degree is found for PEF in Pt/ADE cell due to the little influence of UVA light on Fe(2+) regeneration. The homologous EF processes are much less potent as a result of the persistence of Fe(III)-carboxylate complexes. Aromatic intermediates such as 1-naphthol, 1,4-naphthoquinone and phthalic acid and generated carboxylic acids such as pyruvic, glycolic, malonic, maleic, oxamic, oxalic and formic are identified. While chloride ion remains stable, NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-) ions are released to the medium. A reaction sequence for propranolol hydrochloride mineralization is proposed.", 
    "84": "In recent years, increasing emphasis has been placed on quantitative characterization of drug metabolites for better insight into the correlation between metabolite exposure and toxicological observations or pharmacological efficacy. One common strategy for metabolite quantitation is to adopt the stable isotope labeled (STIL) parent drug as the internal standard in an isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay. In the current work, we demonstrate this strategy could have a potential pitfall resulting in quantitation bias if the internal standard is subject to ion suppression from the co-eluting parent drug in the incurred samples. Propranolol and its metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol were used as model compounds to demonstrate this phenomenon and to systematically evaluate different approaches to mitigate the issue, including atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) mode of ionization, increased internal standard concentration, quantitation without internal standard, the use of a structural analog as internal standard, and dilution of the samples. Case studies of metabolite quantitation in nonclinical and clinical studies in drug development were also included to demonstrate the importance of using an appropriate bioanalytical strategy for metabolite quantitation in the real world. We present that bias of metabolite concentrations could pose a potential for poor estimation of safety risk.

The latter steadily gain in importance as parenteral controlled release dosage forms, especially for acid-labile drugs. A variety of lipid powders were blended with theophylline and propranolol hydrochloride as sparingly and freely water-soluble model drugs. Cylindrical implants were prepared by direct compression and thoroughly characterized before and after exposure to phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Based on the experimental results, an appropriate mathematical theory was identified in order to quantitatively describe the resulting drug release patterns. Importantly, broad release spectra and release periods ranging from 1 d to several weeks could easily be achieved by varying the type of lipid, irrespective of the type of drug. Interestingly, diffusion with constant diffusivities was found to be the dominant mass transport mechanism, if the amount of water within the implant was sufficient to dissolve all of the drug. In these cases an analytical solution of Fick's second law could successfully describe the experimentally measured theophylline and propranolol hydrochloride release profiles, even if varying formulation and processing parameters, e.g. the type of lipid, initial drug loading, drug particles size as well as compression force and time. However, based on the available data it was not possible to distinguish between drug diffusion control and water diffusion control. The obtained new knowledge can nevertheless significantly help facilitating the optimization of this type of advanced drug delivery systems, in particular if long release periods are targeted, which require time consuming experimental trials.",

In the voltage-clamp mode (V(H)=-70mV), the application of DA induced outward currents in about 70% of SG neurons tested. DA-induced outward current was observed in the presence of either Na(+) channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX) or a non-NMDA receptor antagonist, CNQX, and was inhibited by either GDP-\u03b2-S in the pipette solution or by perfusion of a non-selective K(+) channel blocker, Ba(2+). The DA-induced outward currents were mimicked by a selective D2-like receptor agonist, quinpirole and attenuated by a selective D2-like receptor antagonist, sulpiride, indicating that the DA-induced outward current is mediated by G-protein-activated K(+) channels through D2-like receptors. DA significantly suppressed the frequency and amplitude of glutamatergic spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). DA also significantly decreased the frequency of miniature EPSCs in the presence of TTX. These results suggest that DA has both presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibitory actions on synaptic transmission in SG neurons. We showed that DA produced direct inhibitory effects in SG neurons to both noxious and innocuous stimuli to the skin. Furthermore, electrical stimulation of dopaminergic diencephalic spinal neurons (A11), which project to the spinal cord, induced outward current and suppressed the frequency and amplitude of EPSCs. We conclude that the dopaminergic descending pathway has an antinociceptive effect via D2-like receptors on SG neurons in the spinal cord.",

We performed a meta-analysis of the short-term efficacy of nicorandil compared with antianginal drugs for stable angina. We selected 20 reports (vs. \u03b2-blockers, n=6; vs. nitrates, n=6; vs. calcium antagonists, n=8) of prospective controlled trials from MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and Japana Centra Revuo Medicina. The trials were short in duration (median 5 weeks). We combined the results using odds ratios (OR) for discrete data and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous data.

Furthermore, there were no significant differences in time to ischemia (total exercise duration, time to 1-mm ST depression, time to onset of pain). Although the total numbers of adverse events with each antianginal drug were similar, heart rate and blood pressure were significantly decreased by calcium antagonists but not changed by nicorandil (8.09 [95% CI: 3.20, 12.98] and 8.64 [95% CI: 3.28, 13.99], respectively).

Brain-to-blood efflux of glutamate is increased by decreasing the concentration of glutamate in blood. Little is known about the effect of hyperthermia on blood glutamate concentrations, and the effectiveness of blood glutamate-decreasing mechanisms in these conditions. Although hyperthermia is hypothesized to decrease blood glutamate concentrations by activation of stress mechanisms, blunting the stress response by blocking \u03b2-adrenergic receptors should prevent this decrease. Furthermore, during hyperthermia there should be a concurrent process of leakage of glutamate from muscle tissue into blood, resulting in a contradictory increase of blood glutamate concentrations. In this study we investigated the effects of hyperthermia on blood glutamate levels and studied the effects of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol on stress-induced changes in glutamate levels. We then studied the effectiveness of the blood glutamate scavenger oxaloacetate on hyperthermia-induced increases of glutamate levels.",

Carvedilol per se did not present any effect on renal mitochondria.

Our results showed that the propranolol treatment inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting the involvement of \u03b2-ARs in this cellular response. Propranolol-induced growth inhibition was associated with G0/G1 arrest and G2/M arrest depending upon the concentration. In addition, propranolol also induced apoptosis in both cell lines, as determined by Annexin V staining assay. Furthermore, propranolol decreased the level of NF-\u03baB and then downregulated VEGF, Cox-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Collectively, these results suggested that propranolol repressed gastric cancer cell growth through the inhibition of \u03b2-ARs and the downstream NF-\u03baB-VEGF/MMP-2/9/COX-2 pathway.",

To our knowledge, this is the first case of hypermelatoninemia without any detectable organic pathology. We did not determine the exact mechanism of hypermelatoninemia in this patient; however, it might have been related to irregular control of pinealocytes by the suprachiasmatic nucleus or related pathways.

ARBs were associated with a lower incidence of new-onset diabetes in Western population [OR 0.81, (0.76, 0.85)] and Japanese population [OR 0.61, (0.48, 0.79)].", 
    "197": "There is sufficient evidence that ARBs have beneficial effect in preventing new-onset type 2 diabetes. ARBs should be considered in patients with high risk of developing diabetes.", 
    "198": "\u03b2(3)-Adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(3)-AR) is expressed in several tissues and is considered a drug target for the treatment of several pathologies such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cachexia, metabolic syndrome, heart failure, anxiety and depressive disorders, preterm labor, overactive bladder, control colon motility, and of coadjuvants in colon cancer therapy. It is a seven-transmembrane domain (7TD) G-protein coupled receptor and is usually coupled to a Gs-protein (Gi-protein in very few cases), and its stimulation increases the production of cAMP. A lot of \u03b2(3)-AR agonists have been uncovered and extensively characterized. Conversely, very little is known about \u03b2(3)-AR inverse agonists that would suppress the agonist-independent activity (constitutive activity) of the receptor by stabilizing it in its inactive state. This chapter attempts to outline (a) the importance of the \u03b2(3)-AR as a therapeutic target through the disquisition of its role in human health (physiology) and disease (pathology); (b) the description of \u03b2(3)-AR structure [amino acid sequence and 7TD organization]; (c) the medicinal chemistry of \u03b2(3)-AR: 7TD amino acid-ligand specific interactions, \u03b2-adrenoreceptor subtype selectivity, stereospecific interactions and biological activity relationships, inverse agonism and blockage of \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor constitutive activity; and (d) \u03b2(3)-AR inverse agonists. The detailed procedure to prepare and assess the biological activity/selectivity of the more potent and selective \u03b2(3)-AR inverse agonists (SP-1e and SP-1g) up to now known is also described.", 
    "199": "The RR intervals of sinus and ventricular beats were determined by analysis of a 24-h ambulatory electrocardiogram in a Boxer before and after treatment with sotalol. These RR intervals were plotted using tachograms, histograms, and Poincar\u00e9 plots. The tachogram demonstrated a 'band' wherein a range of RR intervals was infrequent, the histogram did not take the form of a single Gaussian distribution of RR intervals, and the Poincar\u00e9 plot showed nonhomogeneous beat-to-beat variability. This type of patterning was described as a \"zone of avoidance\" potentially caused by the clustering of beats within specific ranges. Treatment with sotalol enhanced the \"zone of avoidance\". Further investigation is needed to understand the mechanism for this observation as well as any clinical implications.", 
    "200": "A 41-year-old healthy man was diagnosed with bilateral carotid body tumors. The patient had a staged surgical removal of the tumors approximately 8 months apart. Postoperative recovery was uneventful after removal of the first and largest tumor; however, after removal of the second tumor, the patient developed tachycardia and hypertension. He was diagnosed with baroreceptor failure syndrome after ruling out other possible causes. Baroreceptor failure syndrome is a rare and important complication known to be associated with many conditions, one of them being inadvertent baroreceptor denervation during bilateral carotid body tumor resection. Medical management of this condition is necessary to prevent cerebrovascular events; thus, it is important for the surgeon and the internist to recognize and treat it aggressively.", 
    "201": "Hypertension is a risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and heart failure and precedes heart failure in 91% of cases. This becomes even more important considering that the number of Americans with hypertension increased from 65 million in 2005 to 72 million in 2007. If blood pressure is effectively controlled this risk can be minimized-blood pressure reductions as small as 2 mm Hg have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by up to 10%. There is also strong evidence that blood pressure targets for populations at high risk of cardiovascular disease, including those with diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease, should be lower than 140/90 mm Hg. The number and type of antihypertensive drugs have increased dramatically from 28 diuretics in 1972 to over 125 agents today, including fixed dose combination dosage forms. Beta blockers have been available for the treatment of hypertension since the 1960s. However, there has been resistance to using these agents in patients with diabetes and renal failure because of metabolic side effects, and in other patients because of tolerability concerns such as depression, weight gain, and impotence. Two newer beta blockers with vasodilatory effects (carvedilol and nebivolol) have proven efficacy and tolerability in patients with hypertension and appear to lack the adverse effects associated with older beta blockers. Carvedilol causes vasodilation by alpha blockade, and nebivolol via nitric oxide mechanisms. Both of these agents reduce peripheral vascular resistance and maintain cardiac output. Clinical trial evidence to date leads to the conclusion that beta blockers are strongly indicated post-MI and in all patients with left ventricular dysfunction regardless of symptoms. Their beneficial abilities include improvement of oxygen supply and demand (which can reduce myocardial ischemia), anti-arrhythmic properties, and beneficial effects on cardiac remodeling.", 
    "202": "Two-step stacking of organic cations by sweeping and micelle to solvent stacking (MSS) in capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) is presented. The simple procedure involves hydrodynamic injection of a micellar sodium dodecyl sulfate solution before the sample that is prepared without the micelles. The micelles sweep and transport the cations to the boundary zone between the sample and CZE buffer. The presence of organic solvent in the CZE buffer induces the second stacking step of MSS. The LODs obtained for the four beta blocker and two tricyclic antidepressant test drugs were 20-50 times better compared to typical injection.", 
    "203": "Since depression entails not only dramatic personal disruption but also a huge amount of medical and socioeconomic burden, slowness of antidepressant action and difficulties to attain remission are entangled issues to be solved. Given the controversial previous findings with enhancing strategies such as pindolol, we examined whether the speed of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) action can be truly accelerated with optimized pindolol dosage. Additionally, we aimed at elucidating whether pindolol benefits emerge, particularly in a population with nonresistant depression.", 
    "204": "Thirty outpatients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV criteria) recruited between December 2002 and November 2005 were randomly assigned to receive citalopram + pindolol (5 mg tid) or citalopram + placebo for 6 weeks in a double-blind randomized clinical trial. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of pindolol augmentation in patients with nonresistant depression was also performed. Outcome criteria were based on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. For the meta-analysis, efficacy was assessed by the number of treatment responders at 2 weeks and 4-6 weeks.", 
    "205": "Clinical trial outcomes: Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed a significant group-by-time interaction (P = .01). Cumulative percentage showed a trend for sustained response (odds ratio [OR] = 2.09; 95% CI, 0.914-4.780; P = .08) and a well-defined increased likelihood of sustaining remission (OR = 5.00; 95% CI, 1.191-20.989; P = .03) in pindolol receivers. Median survival time until first response was 65% less in the pindolol group (22 days vs 30 days; P = .03). The negative binomial regression model yielded different rates of response per person-day for pindolol and placebo groups (7.6% vs 4.7%, respectively; P = .03). Meta-analysis: Outcome favored pindolol at 2 weeks' time (relative risk [RR] = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.18-2.39; P = .004) and also at 4-6 weeks' time (RR = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.20; P = .02).", 
    "206": "Present findings represent further evidence of the acceleration and enhancement of efficacy with pindolol administered together with SSRIs, displaying a quicker and more pronounced decrease of symptoms in patients with nonresistant major depressive disorder.",
