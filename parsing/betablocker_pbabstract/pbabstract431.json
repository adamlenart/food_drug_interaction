    "0": "Previous studies in human volunteers have demonstrated an inhibition of gastric motility following painless rectal distension. In the present study we investigated, in anaesthetized rats, the effects of colonic distension on gastric tone and looked at certain aspects of the underlying nervous mechanisms. Changes in gastric volume were monitored continuously by a volumetric method. Colonic distension induced an immediate and pronounced gastric relaxation which lasted throughout the period of distension. The inhibition of gastric tone following colonic distension was abolished by hexamethonium or by bilateral cervical vagotomy. The selective adrenergic alpha 1 blocker, prazosin, the alpha 2 blocker, yohimbine, and the non-selective beta-blocker, propranolol, had no significant effect on gastric relaxation following colonic distension. Likewise, naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, did not significantly influence gastric reflex inhibition. It is concluded that colonic distension induced a non-adrenergic inhibition of gastric tone mediated through the vagal nerves. Ganglionic receptors are also suggested to form part of the inhibitory pathway.", 
    "1": "1. Atenolol 50 mg kg-1 was administered daily for 7 to 21 days to male normotensive Wistar rats and to Okamoto spontaneously hypertensive rats. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored daily. 2. Following atenolol treatment the response to exogenous noradrenaline and to periarterial nerve stimulation was measured in the in situ blood perfused mesentery. 3. In normotensive animals, treatment with atenolol for 7 days had little effect on the responses of the mesenteric vasculature to either exogenous noradrenaline or to periarterial nerve stimulation. After 21 days, the response to noradrenaline was little changed, but there was a statistically significant decrease in the response to periarterial nerve stimulation at the higher stimulation frequencies (16 and 35 Hz). 4. In spontaneously hypertensive animals, treatment with atenolol for 7 days did not significantly affect the response of the mesenteric vasculature to either noradrenaline or periarterial nerve stimulation; however, after treatment for 21 days, responses to exogenous noradrenaline were reduced, while responses to periarterial nerve stimulation were even more markedly reduced, particularly at the lower stimulus frequencies. 5. The time course of the observed effects suggests that, over time, atenolol induces changes other than the simple blockade of beta-adrenoceptors which can be demonstrated to be present immediately. The decreased responses to periarterial nerve stimulation in normotensive and hypertensive animals suggest that the changes induced affect presynaptic mechanisms of noradrenaline release (either directly or indirectly), rather than changes in postsynaptic receptor sensitivity or vascular reactivity. The observation that the changes are more evident in hypertensive animals indicates that they may play an important role in the antihypertensive action of atenolol.", 
    "2": "Migraine patients seem to suffer from a continuous autonomic imbalance. Sympathetic instability, expressed by enhanced low frequency fluctuations, which exists during the headache free intervals, was observed in our previous study by spectral analysis of heart rate (HR) fluctuations. Propranolol--a beta adrenoceptor antagonist, is widely used in migraine prophylaxis. In order to specify and quantitate propranolol efficacy in migraine, spectral analysis of heart rate fluctuations was performed on 10 migraine patients before and during the treatment with propranolol. They were compared to 10 healthy control patients and 6 migraine patients who were treated for several months with propranolol and then discontinued the medication. The analysis was carried out on a 24h Holter ECG recording, which was performed for each subject during a headache free interval. Short 256 sec subtraces, taken every 30 min from the 24h ECG signal, were submitted to A/D conversion, R wave detection and computation of heart rate power spectrum. Propranolol achieved a marked effect, when comparing the power spectra of HR fluctuations in treated versus untreated migraine patients. A strong reduction (to normal level) in the low frequency HR fluctuations in the range below 0.1 Hz., was apparent in patients treated with propranolol. Subjects who had received propranolol in the past and discontinued the drug, displayed a carry-over effect of reduced fluctuations even 2-3 months after its discontinuation. It seems that the propranolol efficacy in migraine is associated with the mechanism of stabilizing the fluctuations within the frequency band related to sympathetic activity, hereby moderating the vascular instability in migraine.", 
    "3": "An interactive Fortran program, MUCRA, is presented. The program can perform randomization analysis of a completely randomized or randomized-blocks design extended to growth and response curves. A single-step Scheff\u00e9-type procedure as well as the Peritz's closed step-down procedure have been implemented which control the familywise type I error-rate. In general, MUCRA is suitable as a computer tool for a distribution-free analysis of variance with repeated measures. The use of MUCRA is demonstrated by analyzing the effects oxprenolol and atenolol have on exercise heart rate. Oxprenolol is a non-selective beta-blocker with moderate intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), given by the Oros delivery system. Atenolol is a beta 1-selective blocker without ISA. A randomized placebo-controlled crossover design was used to compare the effects of the beta 1-blockers on heart rate during a progressive maximal exercise test on a bicycle ergometer. Application of the Scheff\u00e9-type procedure showed that the two drugs significantly (alpha = .05) reduce the heart rate during the exercise test at the three prechosen times (2, 5, and 24 hr) after intake. The reduction from atenolol is more pronounced than from oxprenolol Oros at 2 and 5 hr.", 
    "4": "The purpose of this study was 1) to clarify whether augmented myocardial contraction after a brief coronary occlusion, i.e. post-ischemic hypercontraction, depends on a transient increase in coronary blood flow or preceding myocardial ischemia, and 2) to identify the role of catecholamines or calcium flux in this phenomenon. Sixteen mongrel dogs were examined in open-chest anesthetized condition. One-minute reperfusion after two-minute total coronary occlusion of the left anterior descending artery resulted in a transient increase in segment shortening. Intracoronary administration of adenosine caused hyperemia without any changes in segment shortening. Two minutes of total coronary occlusion with adenosine caused post-ischemic hypercontraction to the same degree, but without any additional hyperemia. Two minutes of partial occlusion with 75% flow reduction caused less post-ischemic hypercontraction. Post-ischemic hypercontraction did not occur after partial occlusion with 50% flow reduction, irrespective of hyperemia with adenosine during reperfusion. Propranolol or verapamil did not prevent this phenomenon. Thus, post-ischemic hypercontraction is not dependent on the transient increase in coronary blood flow, but is related to the preceding myocardial ischemia. Local release of catecholamines is not likely to be the cause. A calcium antagonist, verapamil, did not modify this phenomenon. The precise mechanism of this phenomenon is still uncertain, although some alterations in cellular hemostasis, such as ionic changes, are likely to be the cause.",

    "6": "The authors propose a method to generate information relevant to the decision tree that adds additional perspective to the characterization of health quality during survival. Their approach uses survival data to distinguish two attributes of utility: prolongation of life and quality of life (QOL). Health-state transition probabilities correspond to the prolongation of life and are modeled in a discrete-time transient semi-Markov process. Quality-of-life-state transition probabilities are derived from the assumptions of a simple recurrent Markov process. They reflect events within the health-state sojourn time that differentiate perceptions of pain and suffering over a short fixed time period. Outcomes for these two dimensions of utility are highly relevant to the assessment of medical technology that might prolong life at the cost of increased pain and suffering, implying a reduced QOL. The methods are demonstrated on a subset of follow-up data from the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT).", 
    "7": "A patient with pheochromocytoma was studied by MIBG scintigraphy while on labetalol therapy, which has been reported to interfere with imaging. Serial imaging was performed at 2, 18, 25, and 90 hours to obtain time/activity curves. Blood samples were taken at each imaging study to determine activity counts. Tumor activity per gram of tissue (surgery 116 hours after injection) was compared with blood activity. Tumor and blood activity decreased concurrently, whereas the decrease in peritumoral activity was faster, thus providing transiently improved contrast on 18- and 25-hour images. The diagnostic implications of these results are discussed.", 
    "8": "This study determined the dose-response relationship among three doses of betaxolol compared with placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 317 hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or betaxolol 5, 10, or 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks. A significant (P less than .05) decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) compared with concurrent placebo was evident with all three doses of betaxolol after 1 week of active treatment. Each dose of betaxolol maintained a significant reduction in diastolic and systolic BP and heart rate responses throughout the 4-week treatment period. At the fourth week (final treatment evaluation), BP and heart rate were significantly (P less than .05) reduced by all three doses of betaxolol compared with placebo. For supine systolic and diastolic BP, the decreases with betaxolol 20 mg were significantly (P less than .05) greater than with the 5 mg dose, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 10-mg and either the 5- or 20-mg doses. For standing diastolic BP, the effect of betaxolol 5 mg once daily was significantly (P less than .05) less than that of 10 and 20 mg. The overall supine diastolic BP response to betaxolol was dose dependent, and more patients responded to the 10- and 20-mg doses of betaxolol (66% and 76%, respectively) than to the 5-mg dose (59%). For each efficacy variable, the absolute magnitude of the reduction was greater with increasing dose. In subgroup analyses, BP responses were analyzed by race, age, baseline BP, and age combined with baseline BP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "The present studies were designed to verify whether preventing the rise in serum levels of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) by adrenergic blockade would interfere with the decrease in tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity caused by acute exercise in rats. Ninety minutes before being killed, male rats were injected intraperitoneally with either saline, the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol (25 mg/kg body weight), or the alpha 2-adrenergic blocker yohimbine (3 mg/kg body weight). Half of each group was killed at rest and the other half immediately after a 1-h run on a treadmill. LPL was determined in white adipose tissue (WAT), heart, and red vastus lateralis muscle (VLM). Exercise enhanced serum levels of NEFA 50% over resting values in saline-injected rats. The latter increase was totally abolished in animals having received propranolol or yohimbine. The activity of LPL in WAT, heart, and red VLM was approximately 35% lower in exercised rats than in resting animals. Serum triacylglycerols were also reduced by the run. Neither propranolol nor yohimbine interfered with any of these reductions. Exercise did not change serum glucose levels in saline-injected rats but decreased it in those injected with propranolol or yohimbine. Serum insulin was unchanged by exercise and by the antagonists. These findings suggest that the beta- and alpha 2-adrenergic pathways, as well as the exercise-induced rise in serum levels of NEFA, are not responsible for the early reducing effect of a 1-h run on tissue LPL activity in untrained rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "This study examined the effects of atenolol and metoprolol on neuropsychologic functioning, mood, sedation, and sleep. Following tapering of antihypertensive medication and a 3-wk placebo washout, 35 hypertensive patients were randomized to receive double-blind either atenolol or metoprolol for 4 wk. There was no consistent evidence that beta blocker treatment was associated with a deleterious effect on neuropsychologic functioning. The neuropsychologic effects of the drugs did not differ. There were also no significant changes in mood as assessed by the Profile of Mood States as a consequence of treatment with a beta blocker. However, there was a trend for patients receiving metoprolol to report a poorer mood profile. There was no overall or differential drug effect on deep sleep or sedation. On both drugs, however, patients complained of disturbing dreams (p less than 0.04); however, the two drugs did not differ in this regard. On both medications patients had substantial complaints of fatigue; however, it is inappropriate to attribute this to the medication since there were equivalent complaints on placebo.", 
    "11": "The use of beta-adrenergic antagonists for primary prevention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices is discussed. In five controlled trials, patients with cirrhosis and endoscopically proven esophageal varices were treated with either propranolol or nadolol in doses to reduce heart rate by 20-25% or in doses to decrease hepatic vein pressure by 25% of basal levels or to a level of less than 12 mm Hg. In two of three studies, investigators found that propranolol significantly reduced frequency of initial bleeding in patients with esophageal varices. In one of two studies, nadolol significantly decreased the risk of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis; in the other study, a significant difference in the frequency of initial bleeding was found only among patients who were compliant with therapy. Only one of the five studies showed a significant difference in survival between the treatment group and the placebo group. Adverse effects of therapy included dizziness, fatigue, cardiac insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, and risk of bleeding associated with propranolol withdrawal. Therapy with a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist should be considered for primary prevention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis and suspected or documented large varices; however, abrupt discontinuation of the medication is associated with risk of bleeding.", 
    "12": "In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in 10 healthy volunteers the hemodynamic effects, drug plasma concentrations, and thyroid hormone profiles were compared after oral administration for 1 week of 40 mg t.i.d. racemic (R,S)-propranolol versus 20 mg t.i.d. optically pure (S)-propranolol. During exercise, both substances decreased heart rate (-14%, p less than 0.01), as well as the overall rate pressure product (-19%, p less than 0.01) to the same extent, indicating similar beta-blocking effects. After oral application of (R,S)-propranolol the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of (S)-propranolol were higher than those of (R)-propranolol (eudismic ratios (S)- over (R)-propranolol Cmax, 1.36 [p less than 0.01] and AUC, 1.42 [p less than 0.01]) despite dose-equivalence of both enantiomers in the administered racemic (R,S)-propranolol preparation indicating different pharmacokinetic properties. Mean values of Cmax and the AUC of (S)-propranolol did not differ significantly after 1 week of oral administration of 40 mg (R,S)-propranolol and 20 mg (S)-propranolol t.i.d., respectively. The ratio of triiodothyronine to thyroxine was decreased by (R,S)-propranolol (-25%, p less than 0.01) but not by (S)-propranolol, suggesting that only the (R)-enantiomer inhibits the conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine. Thus, half-dosed optically pure (S)-propranolol is an equally effective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist compared with currently used racemic (R,S)-propranolol. By contrast, the conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine is inhibited by (R)-propranolol only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "There are few data on whether differences exist in the renal tubular secretion of enantiomers and no data on whether inhibition of renal secretion of individual enantiomers is stereoselective. Pindolol was used as a probe drug because it is used clinically as a racemic mixture of R-(+) and S-(-) enantiomeric forms and is highly secreted by the proximal tubules of the kidney. Eight young healthy subjects received a single 15 mg oral dose of racemic pindolol with and without 400 mg cimetidine twice daily. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve of both R-(+)- and S-(-)-pindolol were significantly (p less than 0.01) increased by cimetidine from 234 +/- 90 (mean +/- SD) to 344 +/- 78 ng/ml.hr for R-(+)-pindolol and from 209 +/- 73 to 288 +/- 69 ng/ml.hr for S-(-)-pindolol. The renal clearance of R-(+)-pindolol (170 +/- 55 ml/min) was significantly (p less than 0.05) less than that for S-(-)-pindolol (222 +/- 66 ml/min). Cimetidine significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced the renal clearances of R-(+)-pindolol to 104 +/- 18 ml/min and for S-(-)-pindolol to 155 +/- 38 ml/min. The enantiomer with the higher renal clearance [S-(-)-pindolol] had its renal clearance reduced less by cimetidine (26% versus 34%, p less than 0.05). Cimetidine appears to have a stereoselective action on the active transport system for organic cations in the proximal tubule.", 
    "14": "The effect of the combined treatment with propranolol 20 mg tid and diltiazem 60 mg tid in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation treated with digoxin was evaluated. Thirteen patients entered a double-blind, three-phase crossover study. Heart rate was significantly reduced during rest and at maximal exercise (p less than 0.05) during combined treatment compared with treatment with any single drug. No significant changes in maximal work load, exercise time, systolic blood pressure at maximal work load, or subjective sensation of well-being could be demonstrated during combined drug treatment. The RR distribution pattern was unaffected by the addition of propranolol, diltiazem, or their combination to the chronic digoxin treatment. It is concluded that the combination of diltiazem and propranolol has no advantages over any of these drugs singly, in the moderation of heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation even combined with basic digitalis treatment, and that the intrinsic AV nodal function is unaffected by these drugs or their combination.", 
    "15": "Seventy-four patients who met DSM-III criteria for social phobia completed 8 weeks of double-blind, randomly assigned treatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine sulfate, the cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker atenolol, or placebo. The overall response rates were 64% for phenelzine, 30% for atenolol, and 23% for placebo. Phenelzine was widely superior to both atenolol and placebo on independent rater analyses and, to a lesser extent, on self-report, with no significant differences between atenolol and placebo. At the end of 16 weeks, phenelzine was still significantly superior to placebo, while atenolol showed an intermediate response that did not differ significantly from either of the other treatments. Patients with generalized social phobia constituted 76% of the sample, and they were preferentially responsive to phenelzine. The small size of the discrete social phobic sample precluded separate outcome analyses for this subtype. Overall, the findings support the responsivity of social phobia to monoamine oxidase inhibitors.",

The type of drug prescribed affected weight change with all diets. The drug effect on weight change, present in all groups at 6 months, was most pronounced in those randomly assigned to the weight loss diet, where the placebo group lost 4.4 kg, the atenolol group lost 3.0 kg, and the chlorthalidone group lost 6.9 kg. The group differences were attenuated but persisted at 24 months. We suggest that the antihypertensive drug prescribed affects the success of a conjoint weight loss program and speculate that the difference between the drugs may be due to their intrinsic effects on the sympathetic nervous system and related metabolic changes.",

    "28": "This study was designed to determine the hemodynamic effects of the class III antiarrhythmic agent d-sotalol in acute ischemic heart failure at concentrations that prolong ventricular repolarization. In pentobarbital-anesthetized open-chest dogs, heart failure was induced by microembolization of the area supplied by the main left coronary artery until a stable left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure of 25 +/- 2 mm Hg was achieved. Embolization shortened the QT interval by 30 +/- 11 msec, while 1 and 2 mg/kg d-sotalol intravenously after embolization lengthened the QT interval by 23 +/- 7 and 39 +/- 7 msec, respectively (n = 7). Heart rate increased after embolization by 19 +/- 7 beats/min, while it decreased by 12 +/- 6 beats/min and by 21 +/- 5 beats/min after d-sotalol.

Arrhythmia evaluation in five of the patients suggested catecholamine-sensitive ventricular tachycardia. This diagnosis was supported by either a positive relation to exercise or isoproterenol infusion, suppression of arrhythmia by beta-blockade or sleep, and lack of induction of arrhythmia by programmed electrical stimulation of the heart. The arrhythmias resolved in one patient soon after evaluation and in one other patient after 2 months of controlling therapy. Five other patients continued to receive therapy throughout pregnancy.

    "30": "Quantitative autoradiography was used to evaluate the effects of adrenalectomy (ADX) and corticosterone (CORT) on binding at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors in the dorsal hippocampus and cortex of the rat. ADX increased binding of [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin at 5-HT1A receptors in the oriens and lacunosum moleculare layers of CA2 and CA3, in the lacunosum moleculare layer of CA4 region, and in the dentate gyrus. In restraint-stressed ADX rats, binding was increased only in the oriens and lacunosum moleculare layers of CA2. Restoration of baseline levels of CORT reversed the effects of ADX on 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus, while high levels of CORT decreased binding at 5-HT1A receptors in the dentate gyrus. No treatment affected binding at 5-HT1A receptors in the CA1 region of the hippocampus or in the cortex. ADX increased binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol at 5-HT1B receptors in the infrapyramidal dentate, but this effect was not observed in ADX rats that were restrained. CORT treatment in both ADX and SHAM (adrenally intact) rats resulted in binding at 5-HT1B receptors that was lower than that in untreated ADX and SHAM rats in the infrapyramidal dentate, and lower than that in ADX rats in the suprapyramidal dentate and CA4. In ADX and SHAM rats, CORT also reduced binding at 5-HT1B receptors in area 2 of the cortex. It is suggested that decreases in binding at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B/1D receptors resulting from chronic exposure to high levels of CORT may also occur in animals that fail to adapt to chronic severe stress. Such changes in binding may play important roles in the etiology of depression.",

    "34": "The carrier-mediated transport systems, found in cerebral endothelium, are responsible for maintaining the nutrient milieu of the CNS. The objective of this study was to identify what factors might regulate the sodium-dependent A-system of neutral amino acid transport in isolated cerebral microvessels. The uptake of amino acids into isolated microvessels was measured using methylaminoisobutyric acid (MeAIB) a nonhydrolyzable A-analog of the A-system carrier. The results indicated that stimulation of adrenergic (both alpha and beta) receptors significantly (P less than 0.05-0.02) increased the uptake of MeAIB. While the muscarinic agonist carbachol alone did not alter the uptake of MeAIB, it blocked the stimulation evoked by adrenergic agonists. Furthermore, addition of the metal ion, aluminum also significantly (P less than 0.05) increased specific uptake of MeAIB by 95%, when compared to untreated controls. These results indicate that the uptake of neutral amino acids, through the A-system, into cerebral microvessels, can be modulated by adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, as well as the metal ion aluminum. Since the A-system of amino acid transport may control appropriate levels of amino acids in brain, modulation of the uptake of amino acids by adrenergic and cholinergic receptors and by aluminum, may be associated with an imbalance of amino acids and possible neurotransmitter defects in the CNS.", 
    "35": "The fluxes of representative hydrophilic (propranolol hydrochloride) and lipophilic (diazepam or indomethacin) drugs, administered as ethanolic solutions containing putative penetration enhancers (n-nonane, 1-nonanol, and 1-decanol), were measured across hairless mouse skin in vitro. Propranolol transport was augmented significantly by the presence of 4% (v/v) alkane or alkanol in the vehicle; diazepam and indomethacin, on the other hand, were enhanced only by n-nonane. Experiments with saturated solutions of the drugs as the donor phase revealed that the actions of the enhancers were taking place in the skin and were not a result of an alteration of solute thermodynamic activity in the vehicle. In separate runs, the impact of n-nonane and 1-nonanol on the percutaneous penetration of ethanol was determined. Temporal effects identical to those on the flux of propranolol were observed. A further measurement revealed that the penetration of 1-decanol, when administered as a 4% (v/v) solution in ethanol, followed a profile similar to that of the solvent (which, in turn, was comparable with that of the independently assessed propranolol hydrochloride). Thus, considerable linkage exists between the transport of a hydrophilic drug and the major vehicle component in the presence of n-nonane and 1-nonanol. The lipophilic drugs, conversely, were promoted only by n-nonane and only after most of the ethanol had been absorbed. The results show that an apparent synergy of transport between a putative enhancer and a cosolvent may not always lead to augmented drug flux. Study of the transport of all key formulation components is recommended, therefore, to optimize vehicles for transdermal drug delivery.", 
    "36": "A prospective study of the hemodynamic and renal changes was undertaken in 11 neonates whose mothers were treated with acebutolol for hypertension during pregnancy, compared with a control group of 11 infants born to normotensive mothers. Monitoring of the cardio-respiratory system was performed for a period of 4 days. Renal function was studied during 2 periods (12-36, 60-84 hours of life). Hemodynamic failure was observed in 5 of 11 children from treated mothers. The data concerning the renal function of treated group showed: 1) a diuresis significantly lower during the first period (p less than 0.05); 2) the absence of significant rise in the glomerular filtration rates during the second period; 3) a lower sodium balance during the 1st and 2nd periods (p less than 0.02 and p less than 0.05), a lower calcium balance during the 1st period (p less than 0.01). No relationship was found between the renal changes and the hemodynamic disturbances. The direct effect of the drug on the glomerular and tubular functions and/or the renal arteriolar vasomotricity could explain these changes in the renal function in the newborns prenatally exposed to acebutolol.", 
    "37": "Transdermal absorption of drugs is limited by the stratum corneum, which serves as a diffusion barrier. This barrier might be overcome by enhancing the thermodynamic activity of the drug vehicle. Thermodynamic activity is particularly high in supersaturated systems because it is directly correlated with the degree of saturation. Since supersaturated systems are not stable, they were formed in situ by application of water-free microemulsion bases. These water-free microemulsion bases saturated with the drug were applied to New Zealand albino rabbits with an occlusive patch. Occlusion leads to water uptake from the skin due to hydratation and changes the microemulsion base into a microemulsion. The microemulsion will become supersaturated as a result of decreasing solubility of the drug with increasing water content. The pharmacodynamic effect of the model drug bupranolol in vivo was investigated over a 10-hr time period. The in vitro solubility of bupranolol was examined with respect to the water content. The solubility vs water content curves were compared to the effect vs time curves. The microemulsions and their individual components were studied, and the effect vs time curves were inversely correlated with the solubility vs water content curves.", 
    "38": "In order to clarify the involvement of phosphatidylserine (PhS) in the cellular accumulation of propranolol, we have characterized the binding of 3H-propranolol to cultured rat fibroblasts and to liposomes containing PhS. The properties of propranolol binding to the cells and liposomes were analyzed by means of a Scatchard plot. The cells contained at least two classes of propranolol binding sites, one site of high affinity/low capacity and the second site of lower affinity/higher capacity, while the liposomes contained only one class of binding site. The values of the association constant (K) and number of binding sites (n), given on a PhS basis for the propranolol binding site in the liposomes, were both very close to those of corresponding binding parameters for the high affinity/low capacity binding site in the cells. Cell death, caused by various toxic reagents, resulted in a marked decrease in propranolol accumulation in the cells. Kinetic analysis of the drug binding to dead cells showed one binding site with binding parameters comparable to those of the low affinity/high capacity binding site in the intact cells. Polar cations, methylamine and NH4Cl, completely inhibited propranolol binding to the liposomes. On the other hand, these cations partially inhibited propranolol accumulation in intact cells and failed to inhibit the drug binding to dead cells. These results suggest that PhS in cytomembranes represents the high affinity/low capacity propranolol binding site in cultured rat fibroblasts.", 
    "39": "The reported study was carried out in 25 patients aged 21 to 58 years with essential hypertension in second stage of WHO classification. During three months in 10-day courses they were given alternately 1 placebo tablet or 160 mg propranolol retard in one dose daily. The values of the heart rate and blood pressure were compared before and after the treatment. A significant decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate was noted. The comparison of blood pressure and heart rate values after 10 days on propranolol with those before the treatment showed a statistically significant reduction of these parameters. This is an evidence that the hypotensive action of propranolol retard develops already during 10 days of treatment.", 
    "40": "Thirty two patients with cirrhosis of the liver of Child's B and C class and an episode of endoscopically proven variceal bleed were randomly assigned to receive endoscopic sclerotherapy (EST) or oral propranolol for the prevention of recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding. EST was performed at 3 week intervals using 1% polidocanol intravariceally, till eradication of varices. Propranolol dose was adjusted to reduce the resting heart rate by 25% of the basal value (mean +/- SD, 194.3 +/- 63.9 mg/day) Two patients in the propranolol group were excluded within 48 hours due to side effects of the drug. Thirty patients (EST-16, propranolol-14) completed the trial. Patients were followed up for a maximum of 480 days. Mean follow-up in the EST and propranolol groups was 217 and 243 days respectively. The median bleeding free intervals were 480 and 194 days and number of rebleeding episodes was eight and 16 respectively in the EST and propranolol groups (both p = ns). Our study suggests a trend in favor of EST in preventing variceal rebleeding in patients with hepatic cirrhosis who belong to Child's B and C classes.", 
    "41": "A 69 year old woman was treated with sotalol (320 mg daily) for intermittent atrial fibrillation. Sotalol was initially well tolerated and reversion to sinus rhythm with sinus bradycardia occurred 4 weeks after initiation of therapy. Shortly thereafter, the patient developed recurrent syncope due to torsade de pointes. This was treated successfully with intravenous magnesium infusion and withdrawal of sotalol. Subsequently, the atrial fibrillation was adequately managed using amiodarone, with no recurrence of torsade de pointes. Development of bradycardia associated with reversion to sinus rhythm represents a potential cause of 'late' pro-arrhythmic effects of sotalol.", 
    "42": "The collaboration of Fergus Campbell, Gerald Westheimer and John Robson in the 1950s produced insight into the nature of accommodation microfluctuations and instigated work which has led to the current view that the nominally steady-state accommodation response exhibits temporal variations which can be characterized by two dominant regions of activity: a low-frequency component (LFC less than 0.6 Hz) and a high-frequency component (HFC greater than or equal to 1.0 less than or equal to 2.3 Hz). A functional role has been attributed to these microfluctuations as they offer a means by which a directional cue could be derived from an even-error stimulus. However, there is no consensus regarding the respective contribution made by each of the dominant components in the accommodation control process. Using a newly-designed measurement and recording system we have conducted a series of experiments to investigate the nature and aetiology of the microfluctuations. The incidence and magnitude of microfluctuations in LFCs and HFCs for central and peripheral lens zones were investigated while five young emmetropic subjects viewed a near target. The form of the power spectra of the fluctuations was found to be similar for central and peripheral zones although an overall reduction in magnitude was observed in the periphery. The HFCs are thus a consistent feature of microfluctuations in central zones and not, as previously suggested, merely a spurious feature of peripheral zones. A significant between-subject variation in the location of HFCs was found and led us to consider the relationship between HFCs and other physiological systems which provide intraocular rhythmic variation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "We investigated the involvements of sympathetic and nonadrenergic nervous systems in the inhibitory reflex following bronchoconstriction in dogs. Inhalations of a 0.00125% solution of histamine and Ascaris suum antigen (3 mg protein) to the bronchial side induced reflex tracheal constriction following bronchoconstriction. An intra-arterial infusion of 5 micrograms/min of atropine to the tracheal site changed the reflex tracheal constrictions by histamine and antigen inhalations into tracheal dilatations. The reflex tracheal dilatations were abolished by the combination of intra-arterial propranolol (100 micrograms) and transections of both the bilateral superior laryngeal nerves and the spinal cord at the C1 level. The reflex tracheal constrictions induced by histamine and antigen inhalations were increased with 100 micrograms propranolol. Furthermore, the reflex tracheal constrictions were enhanced by the combination of 100 micrograms propranolol and transection of the spinal cord. These findings indicate that during the constriction of the bronchial smooth muscle, not only a reflex tracheal constriction mechanism but also one of reflex dilatation operates and that the latter reflex response may be mainly mediated by the sympathetic nerves, with partial involvement of the nonadrenergic nerves. This inhibitory reflex may attenuate asthmatic bronchoconstriction.", 
    "44": "We studied the structural and functional characteristics of the vascular bed at calf level in 46 middle aged hypertensive patients (20 males and 26 females) treated with different beta-blockers. After one week of placebo, the patients were divided into three groups: group 1 was treated with labetalol, an alpha-beta-blocker (200 mg t.t.d.); group 2 was treated with acebutolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) (200 mg t.t.d.); group 2 was treated with acebutolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) (200 mg t.t.d.); group 3 was treated with metoprolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker without ISA (100 mg t.t.d.). Before and after placebo, and after three months of active drug treatment, we measured blood pressure, and rest and peak flow at the calf level by strain gauge plethysmography. Basal and minimal vascular resistances were calculated as the ratio between mean blood pressure and rest or peak flow, respectively. A significant decrease in blood pressure was observed in each group. However, basal and minimal vascular resistances decreased only in the labetalol-treated group. These observations indicate that antihypertensive agents that have similar effects on blood pressure, may have different effects on minimal vascular resistance. Therefore, maximum vasodilation of arterioles improves, suggesting that long term treatment with labetalol, but not with other beta-blockers is able to induce a partial regression of vascular structural alterations in hypertensive patients.",

After 6 months of effective antihypertensive therapy, there was a 12% decrease in LV mass for the entire group. However, the extent of LVH regression was highly variable among individual patients.",

Rats were administered either desipramine (DMI) or sertraline daily at doses 7.5 mg kg-1 or 10 mg kg-1, i.p., respectively and the effects on the functional state of hypothalamic neuroendocrine control mechanisms assessed by measurements of plasma hormones following acute drug challenge. The effects of treatment on gross behaviour and brain adrenoceptor density were also determined. 2. Both DMI and sertraline caused significant reduction in activity measured as ambulation and rearing at 14 days of treatment. 3. All animals were chronically cannulated after 14 days of treatment and tested for neuroendocrine response to acute i.v. clonidine (50 micrograms kg-1) or 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 250 micrograms kg-1) after 21 or more days of treatment. 4. Rats treated with DMI but not sertraline showed a virtually complete suppression of the growth hormone (GH) secretion elicited by clonidine in controls, while the secretion of corticosterone was augmented. 5. Treatment with DMI but not sertraline led to a significantly greater 8-OH-DPAT-induced secretion of prolactin than in the control rats, while the plasma concentrations of corticosterone following 8-OH-DPAT were not influenced by either DMI or sertraline treatment. 6. The density (but not the affinity) of cerebral cortical binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol was significantly reduced by DMI treatment. 7. These results show that DMI treatment blunted the sensitivity of post-synaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors, accompanied by complex interactions manifested as increased responsiveness of alpha 1-adrenoceptors and 5-HT1A receptors. Sertraline had no significant neurendocrine effects at a dose which significantly reduced gross activity.",

According to the results of 24-h Holter-monitoring recording, patients were divided into two groups: 10 patients with fixed coronary reserve and 10 patients with variable coronary reserve. The number of ischemic events was reduced with both therapies: from 12 +/- 10 at baseline to 3.4 +/- 4.0 (p less than 0.05) with verapamil and to 3.9 +/- 7.0 (p less than 0.05) with nifedipine plus propranolol (N + P).

We wished to determine whether these findings may be extended to humans. Forearm blood flow (venous occlusion plethysmography) and the regional overflows of NE and NPY-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) were studied at rest and during sympathetic nerve activation by lower body negative pressure (LBNP; -10 mm Hg, 10 min) in 10 hypertensive men before and after local alpha-adrenergic blockade by a dose of phenoxybenzamine (60 micrograms x 100 ml-1 x min-1 for 60 min), which most markedly attenuated responses to exogenous NE; propranolol (10 micrograms x 100 ml-1 x min-1) was present throughout. Phenoxybenzamine increased forearm blood flow at rest (11.5 +/- 1.0 vs. 3.9 +/- 0.3 ml x 100 ml-1 x min-1; p less than 0.001).

    "49": "Conversion of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) to nonsustained VT may be a potent mode of antiarrhythmic drug action, whereas a drug's conversion of nonsustained VT to sustained VT could produce serious clinical complications. We tested the effects of two class Ic drugs [encainide (1, 2, and 4 microM) and propafenone (0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 microM)) and a class III drug (d-sotalol (25, 50, and 100 microM)] on the proportion of VT episodes that were sustained (duration greater than 1 min) in an acute in vitro model of reentrant VT in left ventricular (LV) epicardium: a Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart whose LV endocardial and midwall cells have been killed by a selective freezing procedure. Multiple VT episodes were generated by increasing the stimulation rate until self-sustained activity occurred. Some episodes spontaneously terminated in less than 1 min; others lasted longer and were terminated by transient cooling of the heart. Both encainide and propafenone increased the fraction of episodes of sustained VT in all preparations; the increase was significant in 4 of the 5 encainide preparations (p less than 0.02) and 4 of the 5 propafenone preparations (p less than 0.003). d-Sotalol, on the other hand, decreased the fraction of sustained VT in all preparations; the decrease was significant (p less than 0.002) in 4 of the 5 preparations. All 3 drugs increased the basic cycle length of pacing at which VT was induced and the cycle time of the resulting VT. These results of this new assay of drug action may be related to the drugs' different mechanisms of prolonging refractoriness.",

Eight to 12 days later, monophasic action potentials were recorded endocardially from the apex of the noninfarcted right ventricle and infarcted areas of the left ventricle, and the effects of 1.5 mg/kg intravenous sotalol were evaluated. Monophasic action potentials from the infarcted zone of the left ventricle were obtained from areas where fractionated bipolar electrograms could be recorded; this was histologically confirmed. After sotalol, in sinus rhythm, the monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization of the infarcted zone increased from 186 +/- 31 to 226 +/- 45 ms (+ 22%, p less than 0.05), and monophasic action potential duration of the noninfarcted zone increased from 184 +/- 31 to 225 +/- 47 ms (+ 22%, p less than 0.05).

    "51": "Beta-Adrenoceptor agonists activate a time- and voltage-independent Cl- conductance in mammalian cardiac myocytes. To characterize the cellular signaling pathways underlying its regulation, wide-tipped pipettes fitted with a pipette perfusion device were used to record whole-cell current and to introduce nucleotides to the interior of guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Replacement of pipette GTP with GDP beta S prevented activation of the Cl- conductance by Iso, suggesting a requirement for G protein turnover. With GTP in the pipette, the effect of Iso could be abolished by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, and mimicked by histamine or forskolin. These actions of Iso and forskolin are mediated exclusively via cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), because (a) maximal activation of the Cl- conductance by forskolin or pipette cAMP occluded the effect of Iso, and (b) switching to pipette solution containing a synthetic peptide inhibitor (PKI) of PKA completely abolished the Cl- conductance activated by Iso and prevented the action of forskolin, but had no further effect. These results argue against basal activation of the Cl- conductance, and make it extremely unlikely that the stimulatory G protein, Gs, has any direct, phosphorylation-independent influence. The muscarinic receptor agonists acetylcholine (ACh) and carbachol diminished, in a reversible manner, Cl- conductance activated by Iso or forskolin, but not that elicited by cAMP. The muscarinic inhibition was abolished by replacing pipette GTP with GDP beta S, or by preincubating cells with pertussis toxin (PTX), and was therefore mediated by an inhibitory G protein, presumably Gi, influencing adenylyl cyclase activity. Nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues (GTP gamma S or GppNHp) applied via the pipette did not themselves activate Cl- conductance, but rendered Cl- current activation by brief exposures to Iso or histamine, but not to forskolin, irreversible. The Cl- conductance persistently activated by Iso was insensitive to propranolol or ACh, but could still be abolished by pipette application of PKI. The data indicate that stimulation of beta-adrenergic or histaminergic receptors in the presence of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues causes persistent activation of Gs and uncouples it from the receptors. We conclude that autonomic regulation of cardiac Cl- conductance reflects accurately the underlying modulation of adenylyl cyclase activity and, hence, that this system is a suitable mammalian model for in situ studies of the interactions between adenylyl cyclase, Gs, Gi, and forskolin.", 
    "52": "Nasal ciliary function forms an important defence mechanism within the upper respiratory tract which has largely been ignored in recent years. The effects of various drugs used extensively in the treatment of diseases of the nose have not been fully established. Furthermore, the physiological control of ciliary activity is unclear. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the effects of drugs on ciliary beat frequency in vitro using a photometric technique. A dose-dependent response to alpha and beta receptor drugs was found, cocaine hydrochloride achieved ciliostasis even at 40-fold dilution, and potassium ions, except at the limits of tolerance for excitable tissue, did not affect ciliary function. In conclusion, we suggest that alpha and beta receptors may be present on ciliated epithelium and be involved in the control of ciliary function in vivo. Ion fluxes across the ciliary cell membrane may also be important in ciliary activity akin to nervous tissue.",

    "54": "Effects of neurokinin A (NKA) on sympathetic neurotransmission were studied in rat vas deferens. Although neither prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker, nor alpha, beta-methylene adenosine triphosphate, a P2-purinoceptor blocker, inhibited the NKA-induced contractions in the epididymal site, high concentration of NKA-induced contractions in the prostatic site were slightly decreased by either of the two blockers. Treatment with guanethidine, which prevents the release of sympathetic transmitters from presynaptic nerve endings, also had no effect on NKA-induced contractions in either site. To investigate the effects of NKA on the adrenergic and purinergic neurotransmission in more detail, we measured transmitter release by using [3H]norepinephrine or [14C]adenosine. Neither spontaneous or nor evoked 3H efflux, indicating NE release, was affected by NKA in either site. NKA enhanced 14C efflux, indicating ATP release, evoked by electrical stimulation in the epididymal site, which may be originated from smooth muscle. In the prostatic site, contractions induced by electrical stimulation were enhanced in spite of no increase in 3H or 14C efflux. These results suggest that: 1) NKA has no effect on presynaptic nerve terminals in both sites, 2) NKA potentiates the effects of neurotransmitters in the prostatic site, and 3) NKA modulates the neurotransmissions.", 
    "55": "Cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression undergoes an ontogenetic transition from beta to alpha MHC isoforms. Although thyroid hormone plays a role in this change, the timing of the events suggests the participation of other factors. Using a new, denaturing SDS-PAGE procedure that cleanly resolves the beta and alpha heavy chains, we have assessed the role of beta-adrenergic stimulation on this transition in fetal and neonatal rat hearts. In control animals at embryonic day 20, less than 15% of the MHC was the alpha-form, and the proportion increased to approximately 35% by postnatal day 1 and to 80% by postnatal day 8. Although catecholamine levels rise abruptly at birth, and cyclic AMP levels increase the expression of alpha-MHC in vitro, neither premature beta-adrenergic stimulation (maternal treatment with terbutaline on embryonic days 17, 18 and 19) nor continuous prenatal blockade of beta-receptors (maternal propranolol infusions from embryonic day 7 onward) influenced the developmental profile. Because beta-receptors in fetal and neonatal heart are functionally linked to adenylate cyclase, and cyclic AMP has been shown to promote the expression of alpha-MHC, the lack of effect of terbutaline or propranolol suggests that activation of adenylate cyclase through fetal cardiac beta-receptors is not sufficient to mediate the switchover without participation of other factors, such as thyroid or steroid hormones, or hypoxia.", 
    "56": "The improvement of our understanding of the pharmacology of nitrate derivatives has allowed rationalisation of their use in the treatment of coronary artery disease. The comprehension of the evolution of the sensitivity of the vessel wall to nitrate vasodilatation with time has enabled definition of a rhythm of administration which preserves therapeutic efficacy: a daily therapeutic window of 8 to 10 hours. The introduction of new galenic forms (slow release oral preparations and transdermal patches) facilitates the practical application of the \"optimal\" pharmacokinetic profile. A single daily dose of slow release ISDN is effective in controlled trials versus placebo in the treatment of chronic stable angina. Many clinical trials have also shown the synergy of the anti-anginal effects of ISDN and betablockers, both in single dose studies and during prolonged administration. These therapeutic windows are not adapted to the treatment of acute coronary insufficiency (unstable angina, myocardial infarction); however, it has recently been shown that the use of small, fixed doses of intravenous ISDN over a 3 day period is usually adequate for controlling acute coronary insufficiency and is not associated with the phenomenon of tolerance.",

    "58": "The inhibitory effect of dopamine has been studied in longitudinal and circular muscle strips of the cat gastric fundus. When tone was raised by transmural electrical stimulation and by administration of methacholine, dopamine concentration-dependently relaxed the strips but the inhibitory effect of dopamine was clearly more pronounced on electrically-induced tone. The effect of dopamine was not influenced by the presence of cocaine or hydrocortisone. The relaxant effect of dopamine, when tone was raised by methacholine, was not influenced by alpha- and dopamine receptor antagonists but it was significantly reduced by propranolol and ICI 118551 (erythro-DL-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3- isopropylaminobutan-2-ol). The inhibitory effect of dopamine on the electrically-induced tone was significantly reduced by phentolamine; domperidone tended to reduce the effect of the lower concentrations of dopamine. In the presence of propranolol, phentolamine and rauwolscine concentration-dependently antagonized the inhibitory effect of dopamine on electrically-induced tone, while prazosin was without influence. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of dopamine in the cat gastric fundus is mainly due to interaction with postjunctional beta 2-adrenoceptors on the smooth muscle cells and with prejunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors on the intramural cholinergic neurons.",

In a cohort of patients receiving antihypertensive treatment predominantly consisting of beta blockers in combination with diuretics, support for an improved survival has been presented.

In 10 insulin-dependent diabetic patients with early diabetic nephropathy [urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE) less than 100o micrograms/min], who were receiving continuous therapy with metoprolol and bendroflumethiazide, a double-blind crossover study with four months addition of ramipril 5 mg (Ramace) and placebo was conducted. UAE (radioimmunoassay) and fractional albumin excretion were significantly reduced after the four months of ramipril administration [UAE: 114.1 x/divided by 1.3 (geometric mean x/divided by confidence factor] versus 174.6 x/divided by 1.2 micrograms/min, 2P less than 0.005).

Transmural nerve stimulation of guinea-pig atria, obtained from animals pretreated with reserpine (5 mg kg-1, i.p.), in the presence of atropine 1 microM and of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker CGP 20712A 1 microM, induced a positive inotropic effect which was reduced by the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist hCGRP-(8-37) and abolished by pretreatment with capsaicin 1 microM. 2. Noradrenaline concentration-dependently (0.01-10 microM) reduced the increase in cardiac contractility induced by transmural nerve stimulation. The inhibitory effect of noradrenaline was antagonized by yohimbine (0.5-1 microM), in a dose-dependent manner. Prazosin (0.5-1 microM) antagonized the effect of noradrenaline and this effect was independent of concentration. 3. In the presence of yohimbine, the lower part of the inhibitory-response curve for noradrenaline was slightly but significantly shifted by prazosin. A similar degree of antagonism was observed in the presence of 1 microM phenoxybenzamine. 4. The selective alpha 2 agonists BHT 920 and clonidine reduced, in the same concentration-range (0.01-1 microM), the cardiac response to transmural nerve stimulation in a yohimbine-sensitive fashion. 5.

BRL 37344 was 10,000 times more potent than salbutamol, and salbutamol was slightly more potent than prenalterol. The concentrations required to increase albumin output by 100% (EC100%) were 1.4 nM, 0.7 mM and approximately 1.0 mM for BRL 37344, salbutamol and prenalterol, respectively. All three agonists inhibited methacholine-induced lysozyme output, with salbutamol being 60 times more potent than BRL 37344, and BRL 37344 being approximately 100 times more potent than prenalterol. 3. The selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551, inhibited the increase in albumin output produced by BRL 37344, but much more potent at inhibiting the response to salbutamol; the pA2 for ICI 118551 was 5.55 and 7.18 (P less than 0.001) when the agonist was BRL 37344 and salbutamol, respectively. ICI 118551 also attenuated the inhibition of lysozyme output produced by the two agonists, but was 10-30 times more potent at inhibiting this response than the albumin response to BRL 37344 and salbutamol. 4. The greater potency (4-5 orders of magnitude) of BRL 37344, compared to the beta 1- (prenalterol) and beta 2- (salbutamol) adrenoceptor selective agonists, in stimulating methacholine-induced albumin transport suggests that tracheal epithelium possess an atypical, or beta 3-adrenoceptor similar to that previously reported for adipocytes and gastrointestinal smooth muscle. The weak antagonism of the response to BRL 37344 by ICI 118551 would also be consistent with an atypical adrenoceptor mediating the albumin transport response. Inhibition of methacholine-induced serous cell lysozyme output would appear to be mediated predominantly by beta2-adrenoceptors.5. In view of the possible beneficial protective effects of albumin in airway surface liquid, selective beta3-agonists like BRL 37344 might have potential value in the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory airway disease.", 
    "62": "1. Two populations of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) subtypes and their proportions were characterized in adipocytes isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue of castrated male crossbred pigs (60-85 kg). 2. Specific binding of the radioligand 125I-iodopindolol (IPIN) to crude plasma membranes (70-90% of total binding) reached equilibrium conditions in 30 min (38 degrees C), was tissue concentration-dependent, stereospecific and saturable (bmax = 168 +/- 5.8 fmol/mg protein). 3. Displacement curves by ICI 89,406 were best-fit by a two site model (P less than 0.01) that indicated the presence of two receptor populations and selectivity of IPIN for the beta 2AR subtype. 4. Forty-five percent of the receptors had a high affinity for ICI 89,406, Ki = 2.27 +/- 0.68 nM and were classified as beta 1AR.", 
    "63": "Calcium antagonists have been proposed for the prophylactic treatment of migraine because of their putative vasodilating antispasmodic effect and of their action against the cellular consequences of brain hypoxia. Published reports of controlled double-blind studies of calcium antagonists for the prophylactic treatment of migraine are reviewed herein. The effectiveness of verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine in this indication cannot be considered as firmly demonstrated, when problems with trial design and the amount of available data are taken into account. Nimodipine failed to demonstrate significant effectiveness in migraine with or without an aura. In contrast, the ability of a diphenylpiperazine, flunarizine, to decrease the incidence of migraine attacks in patients with common or classical migraine has been firmly demonstrated, although there is less evidence of this agent's effectiveness on the duration and severity of attacks. The percentage of patients who respond to flunarizine seems comparable to the percentages of propranolol or pizotifen responders. However, flunarizine is associated with unpleasant (weight gain) or severe (extrapyramidal or depressive symptoms) adverse effects which limit its place to that of a second-line drug. Lastly, the analysis of these studies failed to disclose a correlation between calcium movements across the cell membrane and effectiveness for the prevention of migraine attacks. Flunarizine's effect in migraine probably involves monoamine mechanisms which bear no relation to calcium.", 
    "64": "Five beta-blocking agents are effective as long-term prophylactic treatment of migraine: propranolol, metoprolol, timolol, atenolol and nadolol. Propranolol has been most extensively studied and proved effective in 19 of 21 controlled trials. The optimal dose should be determined on a case-by-case basis, by increasing the daily dosage gradually. Among the properties of beta-blockers, the only one which appears to be correlated--albeit negatively--with effectiveness on migraine is intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA): drugs without ISA are effective against migraine whereas partial agonists are not. The mode of action of beta-blockers in migraine is still poorly understood; one of the most cogent current hypotheses involves reduction of brain catecholaminergic hyperactivity.",

    "66": "47 anaesthetised open chest dogs were studied. The diameters of epicardial arterial microvessels were measured in beating hearts using an incident light fluorescence microscope equipped with a floating objective. Drugs were infused into the left anterior descending coronary artery keeping the heart rate and aortic pressure at control levels. To examine the effect of alpha adrenergic blockade, phentolamine (100 micrograms.kg-1) was given in the absence or presence of beta adrenergic blockade (propranolol 50 micrograms.kg-1). To examine the effect of beta adrenergic blockade, propranolol (50 micrograms.kg-1) or three doses of ICI 118,551 (a selective beta 2 antagonist, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 microgram.kg-1.min-1) was given.", 
    "67": "Coronary arterial microvessels were divided into three groups according to the control diameters (D) of small (D less than 100 microns), medium (100 less than or equal to D less than 200 microns) and large (D greater than or equal to 200 microns) groups. In the absence of beta adrenergic blockade, phentolamine significantly dilated all vessel groups: small +19.6 (SEM 5.6)%, medium +5.8(2.3)%, large +5.3(0.9)%. In the presence of beta adrenergic blockade, the vasodilator effect of phentolamine was completely abolished. Propranolol constricted all vessel groups: small -3.6(1.1)%, medium -4.8(1.0)%, large -3.5(1.0)%. ICI 118,551 significantly constricted the large vessel group [-2.5(0.6)%] at the mid dose, and the medium and large vessel groups [medium -3.1(0.8)%, large -3.5(1.3)%] at the highest dose.", 
    "68": "These data indicate that (1) the vasodilator effect of phentolamine is induced by beta adrenergic stimulation; (2) resting alpha adrenergic tone of coronary arterial microvessels is minimal in normally beating hearts, and (3) resting beta adrenergic tone may play a physiological role in coronary arterial microvessels, and beta 2 adrenergic tone predominates in arterial microvessels greater than 100 microns in diameter.", 
    "69": "The effects of a new beta 1 adrenergic receptor blocking agent with beta 2 receptor agonistic properties on cardiovascular mass, left ventricular function, and aortic distensibility were studied in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats.", 
    "70": "20 male SHR and 20 male WKY rats (10 treated and 10 untreated) aged 22 weeks were studied after three weeks of treatment. Cardiovascular mass was measured and left ventricular function was assessed using electromagnetic flowmetry while rapidly infusing whole blood at pharmacologically reduced mean arterial pressure and at pretreatment arterial pressure levels. Aortic distensibility was assessed by obtaining pressure-volume relationships in isolated aortic segments.", 
    "71": "Mean arterial pressure was reduced without changing cardiac output in SHR (p less than 0.01); it remained unchanged in WKY despite reduced cardiac output. Most noteworthy, and like no other agent studied to date, celiprolol significantly reduced both left and right ventricular as well as aortic mass in both WKY and SHR. Despite these similar mass reductions, celiprolol improved left ventricular function (p less than 0.01) and aortic distensibility (p less than 0.05) only in the SHR, a function maintained even when mean arterial pressure was increased abruptly to pretreatment levels.", 
    "72": "Unlike other beta receptor blockers (or any other agent studied in the SHR), celiprolol was effective in reducing mass of right and left ventricles and of aorta; decreasing mean arterial pressure through a fall in total peripheral resistance; and improving left ventricular function and aortic distensibility in the SHR. In contrast, while these structural changes were also produced in WKY, they were not associated with similar functional responses. These findings provide further support for the thesis of a structural and haemodynamic dissociation in antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "73": "MIS is a one-year Multicentre Isradipine Study of the treatment of essential hypertension, in which participated seven centres in Czechoslovakia. The study comprised 144 patients with mild or medium severe hypertension. Isradipine belongs into the group of dihydropyridine derivatives with a high specific and low non-specific affinity to dihydropyridine binding sites of the L-type of calcium channels. After a four-week placebo period isradipine treatment (2.5 mg (1/2 tablet twice a day/was started. This dose increased to 5 mg (1 tablet twice a day) unless normalization of the diastolic pressure was achieved by a smaller dose. Monotherapy with isradipine normalized the diastolic pressure (less than 90 mmHg) in 44% of the hypertonic patients. 56% hypertonics where monotherapy with isradipine did not reduce the diastolic pressure below 90 mmHg were treated by a combination of isradipine and bopindolol. This group of patients had a significantly higher systolic and diastolic pressure, a higher number of erythrocytes and thrombocytes at the onset of the investigation. Addition of bopindolol to isradipine proved very effective. At the end of the one-year study 87% of the patients had a normal diastolic pressure. Isradipine as monotherapy and combined with bopindolol did not influence the metabolic risk factors of IHD and drug tolerance was very good.", 
    "74": "The use of beta-blockers in the treatment of angina, claudication or hypertension is a therapeutic paradox. All those conditions feature increased constrictor tone, so it appears to make little sense to treat them with drugs which block the action of vasodilators. The paradox would disappear, however, if vasodilators could be shown to have the ability to increase constrictor tone in certain circumstances. This paper argues that they have. It presents evidence that isoprenaline, a potent dilator of the dog's saphenous vein, is a powerful constrictor of the vein when it is released from the vasa vasorum of the vein. Indeed, on a molar basis, it appears to be a more powerful constrictor of the vein than exogenous noradrenaline is. Since there is no reason to suppose that isoprenaline is unique among dilators in demonstrating this type of bimodal behaviour, it is possible to justify the proposal that compounds which are normally classified as endogenous dilators may, when released from the pathological vasa vasorum which neoproliferate in atherosclerosis, be responsible for the constrictor effects associated with claudication, and some forms of hypertension and angina. If true then beta-blockade would not be a paradoxical choice of treatment for those conditions.", 
    "75": "Esmolol is a specific beta 1-blocker; it is hydrosoluble, without intrinsic sympathetic activity. Distribution half-life is 2 minutes and elimination half-life 9 minutes. Esmolol is hydrolyzed by the blood esterases. Its indications are all those where inotropism and heart rate must be briefly and specifically diminished using a titration technique: 1) In patients with coronary artery disease, or poor cerebral compliance, just before a strong nociceptive stimulus like intubation, extubation, skin incision, etc. 2) In patients with coronary artery disease, to decrease oxygen consumption by the myocardium. 3) In patients with hypertensive episodes per and post-operatively, especially in vascular surgery and neurosurgery. 4) In cardiac insufficiency due to obstructive cardiomyopathy. 5) In patients with specific cardiac rhythm problems. 6) In all patients where propranolol is indicated bu cannot de administered due to its long duration of action. Esmolol has to be given either as a mini-infusion at a rate of 300-600 micrograms/kg/min for the first 1-2 minutes followed by 200-300 micrograms/Kg/min or as a bolus (just before a nociceptive stimulus) 1-3 mg/kg. When using esmolol, it is important to set limits within which heart rate and blood pressure must remain. Over-dosage can occur easily but can be avoided without difficulty.", 
    "76": "In principle, all forms of treatment applied in patients with symptomatic coronary heart disease may likewise be used in silent myocardial ischemia. Based on Bayes' theorem, therapeutic measures may only be applied in patients with a positive exercise ECG with a high likelihood of coronary heart disease, and/or with myocardial ischemia revealed by another, ECG-independent method, such as, for example, thallium-scintigraphy. As symptomatic improvement cannot be expected in patients with silent myocardial ischemia, therapeutic efficacy can only be documented by an improvement in prognosis. Results of controlled randomized trials are not available in silent myocardial ischemia; therapeutic recommendations can, therefore, only be based on analogous results obtained in patients with symptomatic forms of the disease. Apart from reduction of the known risk factors of coronary heart disease, aspirin may be given to all patients at risk. Among the antiischemic antianginal drugs, beta-receptor blocking agents without intrinsic-sympathomimetic activity may be expected to improve prognosis. In asymptomatic patients with left-stem stenosis and three-vessel disease with impaired left-ventricular function (also, in two-vessel disease with a stenotic dominant LAD) aorto-coronary bypass surgery may be considered in order to improve prognosis.", 
    "77": "Thirty-eight patients already treated with atenolol 50 mg once daily were randomly assigned to treatment with either hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg once daily) or lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily) for 8 weeks in a double-blind crossover study. Eight weeks' treatment with the combination of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker or the diuretic and beta-blocker produced falls in blood pressure (lying: -8.4 +/- 15.4/ -7.3 +/- 80 mmHg and -6.1 +/- 15.3/ -5.2 +/- 8.8 mmHg [mean +/- SD] for lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide respectively; standing: -10.2 +/- 14.2/8.2 +/- 9.2 mmHg and -6.8 +/- 14/ -6.3 +/- 10.3 mmHg for lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide respectively) which were not statistically significantly different. Heart rate was significantly increased on the combination of beta-blocker and diuretic (lying: +4.3 +/- 10.7; standing: +3.2 +/- 10.0 beats/min) compared with a fall on beta-blocker+ACE inhibitor (lying; -0.5 +/- 7.6; standing: -1.5 +/- 7.4). Both therapeutic regimens were equally well tolerated. These results suggest that where patients fail to respond to monotherapy with a beta-blocker the addition of an ACE inhibitor may be as effective as the more traditional option of diuretic therapy.",

The blockade of keratinocyte beta-adrenergic receptors may play a key role in the aetiopathology of this unwanted side-effect.",

In mice, uterine leiomyomas were present in 4 of 50 females at 200 mg/kg but not in any other group. The incidences of other tumor types, as well as pathologic findings, were comparable among groups. In rats, significant body weight gain suppression occurred at 5, 30, and 180 mg/kg. Brown discoloration of perianal fur and steel-gray discoloration of hairless skin were evident in high-dose rats. A generalized steel-gray discoloration of internal organs and tissues occurred in the 30 and 180 mg/kg groups. No other differences between treated and control groups were evident. The clinical relevance of the increased incidence of uterine leiomyoma in mice is questionable because it occurred only in one species at more than 200 times the projected therapeutic dose.",

The responsibility of the physician who deals with athletes always has been, is, and always will be the health and safety of the athlete.", 
    "81": "Drug-induced depression is classified by the DSM-III-R as an organic mood syndrome of the depressed type. Because drugs have specific pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action, depressive syndromes induced by specific drugs may have characteristic clinical features. An awareness of such features would be valuable for clinical purposes. This review is an attempt to summarize the information on clinical features of drug-induced depressions. The review determined that no unique clinical features have been identified for depressive syndromes associated with most drugs. However, the literature did suggest that depressions associated with oral contraceptive agents may differ significantly from non organic major depressive episodes.", 
    "82": "Drug-induced depression which is classified as DSM-III-R is difficult for clinicians to diagnose because the cause is not easily distinguishable from adjustment disorders or nonorganic mood disorders. This review summarizes the few articles published within 20 years as searched in the Index Medicus about the clinical manifestations of organic mood syndromes from oral contraceptives (OCs), beta blockers, alcohol and sedative-hypnotic drugs, and other medications. There was a noticeable lack of articles and specific clinical features which would help differentiate causes. Oral contraception may cause depression by inducing hepatic tryptophan oxidase, which may lead to a deficiency of vitamin B6. The most common reason for discontinuing OCs is depression, i.e., there are reports of a rate of 70/1000 woman years during the 1st year of OC use. However, the rate among females examined in a catchment study was similar at 6.6%. There is some indication that depression may be dose related, i.e., low dose is related to the same prevalence as in the control group. A basic requirement of DSM-III-R is severe and persistent depression; OC-related depression does not exhibit sleep or appetite disturbances. The relationship between beta blockers and depression indicates that the prevalence and the nature of the relationship are not consistently confirmed. Depressive episodes (14) reported in 8 studies showed major depression and suicidal thoughts or attempts just after initiation of propranolol and resolution when the drug was discontinued; timing of the symptoms may be the best basis upon which to make a clinical judgement. Alcohol use is usually seen as associated with depression, but the extent to which alcohol induces depression is unknown. Symptoms are transitory and appear during bouts of heavy drinking. Studies on benzodiazepine use and depression are reported to be confounded by other factors. Other depression-causing agents for which information was unavailable are identified as psychostimulants, metoclopramide, H-2 blockers, methyldopa, and steroids.",

Plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels in patients receiving beta-blockers and diuretics were not significantly different from untreated hypertensives.

In contrast, treatment with ACE inhibitors was associated with significantly lower plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels compared with untreated hypertensives.",

    "88": "We have developed murine models of viral myocarditis induced by encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus in which severe myocarditis, congestive heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy occur in high incidence. From these models, we have learned the natural history and pathogenesis and assessed new diagnostic methods and therapeutic and preventive interventions. Mural thrombi in the atria and ventricles, ventricular aneurysms, conduction disturbance and various arrhythmias were seen in these models. Anti-heart antibody were found in sera of mice and myosin isoenzyme were changed during the course of EMC virus myocarditis. Atrial natriuretic polypeptide was markedly increased in the ventricles in these mice. Successive infection with coxsackievirus and EMC virus developed lesions similar to chronic myocarditis. The myocardial uptake of antimyosin antibody was proved to be a useful method of diagnosis of myocarditis. Treatment with the nucleoside analogue, ribavirin and recombinant alpha interferon effectively inhibited myocardial virus replication and reduced myocardial damage. Passive immunization and virus-specific vaccine prevented development of myocarditis. The use of immunosuppressive therapy was associated with greater mortality when administered early in illness and beneficial effects were not seen by later administration. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor improved myocardial injury and congestive heart failure. A nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, carteolol, prevented the development of myocardial lesions similar to those in dilated cardiomyopathy after myocarditis in the chronic stage.",

In healthy volunteers the mean difference in GFR was 4.8 ml min-1 (95% CI -8.2 to 17.7 ml min-1) and the mean difference in ERBF was 49.8 ml min-1 (95% CI -47.5 to 147 ml min-1) after celiprolol. In patients with chronic renal insufficiency the mean difference in GFR was -2.1 ml min-1 (95% CI -64.6 to 65.8 ml min-1). The study had sufficient power to detect a 15% change in GFR for normals and 10% for patients, and for ERBF, changes of 14% and 23% were detectable. Celiprolol at a dose of 200 mg daily for 7 days can be used in patients with chronic renal insufficiency without adversely affecting GFR or ERBF.", 
    "90": "1. The aims of this study were to investigate the partial agonist profile of carteolol and evaluate methodology for differentiating relative beta 1 and beta 2 partial agonist activity (PAA) in vivo. 2. Eight normal subjects received single oral doses of carteolol 10 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg; nadolol 40 mg; pindolol 30 mg and placebo, given in a single-blind, randomised crossover design. 3. beta 1-PAA was demonstrated with carteolol by dose-related increases in resting heart rate and systolic blood pressure, and a plateau in the dose-response curve for attenuation of exercise tachycardia. beta 2-PAA with carteolol was evidenced by a dose-related increase in resting finger tremor and progressive attenuation of exercise-induced hyperkalaemia. beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonism was shown by attenuation of terbutaline induced hypokalaemic, chronotropic and finger tremor responses. 4. Carteolol behaved as a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with both beta 1 and beta 2-PAA components. In the standard clinical dose range of 10-30 mg, its in vivo PAA effects were relatively beta 1-selective. Thus at low doses, there appeared to be a dissociation between selectivity of antagonist and partial agonist activity. 5. Attenuation of exercise hyperkalaemia appears to be a novel and sensitive method for the evaluation of beta 2-PAA in vivo.", 
    "91": "The 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptor can bind certain beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, such as pindolol, with high affinity. Such pharmacological cross-reactivity suggests a structural similarity in the ligand binding site between the two receptors. To identify this structural entity, we mutated Asn385 in the seventh transmembrane domain of the human 5-HT1A receptor, based on the observation that this residue is conserved in all 5-HT1A and beta-adrenergic receptors of different species but is absent in all other cloned guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptors. This single point mutation (Asn385 to valine) causes a highly selective decrease in the affinity of pindolol and other aryloxyalkylamines for the mutant receptor (about 100-fold), while producing only minor changes in the binding of other 5-HT agonists and antagonists. The results provide direct evidence that Asn385 is responsible for the high affinity interaction between 5-HT1A receptors and aryloxyalkylamine beta-adrenergic antagonists but is not required for the binding of other chemical classes of ligands.", 
    "92": "The impact of esmolol infusion on hemodynamics, ventricular performance, venous admixture, sympathoadrenal, and renin-angiotensin system responses during sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced hypotension was studied in 11 patients undergoing lymph node dissection during general anesthesia with 60% nitrous oxide and fentanyl. Radial arterial and thermistor-tipped pulmonary catheters were employed for hemodynamic monitoring. Arterial and mixed venous blood gas tensions, arterial plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma catecholamine levels were measured. Derived hemodynamic parameters and venous admixture (Qs/Qt) data were obtained from standard equations. Transesophageal echocardiography (6 patients) was used to assess left ventricular performance using the relationship between end-systolic wall stress (ESWS) and velocity of circumferential shortening (VCFC). After surgical incision, arterial hypotension was induced with SNP alone. Esmolol was infused at each of the following rates in sequence: 200, 300, and 400 micrograms/kg/min. Each esmolol infusion lasted 20 minutes and the SNP dose was adjusted to maintain MAP at 55 to 60 mm Hg. The mean dose of SNP required to induce hypotension was 5.5 micrograms/kg/min +/- 0.5 SE. Compared to prehypotension values, SNP induced significant increases in Qs/Qt and reductions in PaO2, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and stroke volume index (SVI). Esmolol infusion caused dose-dependent (highest with 400 micrograms/kg/min) reductions in the SNP requirement, heart rate (HR), SVI, Qs/Qt, and PRA, and also led to significant increases in SVR and left ventricular (LV) internal diameter in diastole as well as systole. Furthermore, esmolol infusion was associated with a dose-dependent downward and leftward shift of the ESWS versus VCFC relationship, implying diminished contractility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "93": "We have investigated beta-adrenergic regulation of adenylate cyclase activity in heart tissue membranes from the genetically obese Zucker rat, the genetically obese CBA mouse and the genetically obese diabetic (db/db) mouse. Responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation was impaired in membranes from the obese Zucker rat, but not in the other models. The membranes from obese Zucker rats showed both decreased beta-adrenergic-receptor number and altered coupling between beta-adrenergic receptors and the stimulatory guanine-nucleotide-binding protein, Gs. In contrast, no alterations in either the levels of Gs or the functional interaction between this protein and the catalytic moiety of adenylate cyclase were observed. In these three genetic models of obesity we observe dissimilar alterations in the control of adenylate cyclase.", 
    "94": "The effect of pressure-overload left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on myocardial function is controversial. A major factor in the controversy may be the age at which the pressure overload was induced. The goal of this study was to determine whether the age at which the LVH was induced affected systolic myocardial function. We studied lambs (n = 8) and sheep (n = 7) with LVH induced by constricting the ascending aorta and their sham-operated controls (n = 7 and n = 7). This new, unsedated, ovine model of LVH was large enough to accommodate chronic surgical implantation of instrumentation and the induction of pressure-overload hypertrophy in both young and adult age groups. Solid-state intraventricular pressure transducers and sonomicrometer crystal were used to assess instantaneous left ventricular pressure and dimensions. Myocardial contractility was assessed with midwall shortening at common preload and afterload. Load alterations were induced by graded infusion of methoxamine. There was depressed myocardial function in adult sheep with LVH compared with adult controls. Lambs with and without LVH had normal left ventricular myocardial function, similar to adult controls. Similar results were obtained in studies after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. We conclude that maturation decreases the ability of the myocardium to maintain normal contractility in the presence of pressure-overload hypertrophy.", 
    "95": "The effect of several hormones known to alter intracellular free Ca2+ on rates of O2 uptake in periportal and pericentral regions of the liver lobule was studied in the perfused liver. Regional O2 uptake was measured by stopping the flow and monitoring the decrease in O2 concentration. When perfusion was in the anterograde direction, basal rates of O2 uptake were two to three times higher in periportal than in pericentral regions, and phosphorylase alpha activity, which increases as a function of intracellular free Ca2+ levels, was higher in periportal regions. In contrast, when perfusion was in the retrograde direction, rates of O2 uptake were two to three times greater in pericentral regions. Infusion of epinephrine (0.1 microM) or angiotensin II (5 nM) increased the rate of O2 uptake nearly exclusively in downstream areas of the lobule where O2 tension was low. When perfusions were in the anterograde direction, epinephrine increased phosphorylase alpha activity significantly only in pericentral regions. Stimulation of O2 uptake by epinephrine was blocked by the alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker phentolamine (1 microM) but not by the beta-receptor blocker propranolol. Thus hormones that increase intracellular calcium stimulate O2 uptake predominantly in regions of the liver lobule where O2 tension is lowest, supporting the hypothesis that oxygen tension regulates O2 uptake in the liver via mechanisms involving intracellular free Ca2+.", 
    "96": "Nicardipine a second-generation dihidropyridine calcium antagonist, has been approved in oral formulation for use in the United States, and is under review for parenteral use. Nicardipine is the most vascular-selective agent of this class currently approved and should, on theoretical grounds, be ideal for combination therapy with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Studies have shown that the combination of nicardipine and beta-blocking agents offers additional efficacy over monotherapy with either agent alone. The hemodynamic profile of combination therapy appears to be especially favorable in patients with diminished left ventricular function needing therapy with agents of both classes.

The experiments were performed on anesthetized rats pretreated with either saline (control group), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril maleate, 2 mg/kg), an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist (prazosin hydrochloride, 0.5 mg/kg), a beta-adrenergic antagonist (propranolol hydrochloride, 5 mg/kg), or an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist (atipamezole, 5 mg/kg). Cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta was associated with an expected increase in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance in all animals. During the period of cross-clamping, cardiac output gradually decreased in all groups. Animals pretreated with the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor developed hypertension of a lesser degree than the control animals, while rats pretreated with the beta-adrenergic or alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist demonstrated a greater arterial hypertension than the control animals. The possible mechanisms underlying the observed differences are discussed. In conclusion, the present study confirms the posed hypothesis that the reninangiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems play an important role in hemodynamic response to cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta.", 
    "98": "Intracellular movement of vesiculated pigment granules in angelfish melanophores is regulated by a signalling pathway that triggers kinesin and dyneinlike microtubule motor proteins. We have tested the relative importance of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) vs cAMP ([cAMP]i) in the control of such motility by adrenergic agonists, using fluorescence ratio imaging and many ways to artificially stimulate or suppress signals in these pathways. Fura-2 imaging reported a [Ca2+]i elevation accompanying pigment aggregation, but this increase was not essential since movement was not induced with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, nor was movement blocked when the increases were suppressed by withdrawal of extracellular Ca2+ or loading of intracellular BAPTA. The phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, blocked aggregation and induced dispersion at concentrations that suggested that the protein phosphatase PP-1 or PP-2A was continuously turning phosphate over during intracellular motility. cAMP was monitored dynamically in single living cells by microinjecting cAMP-dependent kinase in which the catalytic and regulatory subunits were labeled with fluorescein and rhodamine respectively (Adams et al., 1991. Nature (Lond.). 349:694-697). Ratio imaging of F1CRhR showed that the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated aggregation was accompanied by a dose-dependent decrease in [cAMP]i. The decrease in [cAMP]i was both necessary and sufficient for aggregation, since cAMP analogs or microinjected free catalytic subunit of A kinase-blocked aggregation or caused dispersal, whereas the cAMP antagonist RpcAMPs or the microinjection of the specific kinase inhibitor PKI5-24 amide induced aggregation. Our conclusion that cAMP, not calcium, controls bidirectional microtubule dependent motility in melanophores might be relevant to other instances of non-muscle cell motility.",

    "106": "Hyperthermia and overheating of the rat isolated organs induce significant changes of the binding of receptors' specific blockers and catecholamine synthesis. One of the main mechanisms of the organism response to the temperature actions involves a local rearrangement in intensity of different stages of the adrenergic process. Possible significance of these changes in the hypothalamus for synchronisation of the organism's response to extreme temperature effects, is discussed.", 
    "107": "1. Bradykinin can release neuronal calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenal medullary catecholamines, both of which could contribute to its cardiovascular effects in vivo. Therefore, in the main experiment, regional haemodynamic responses to bolus injections of bradykinin (3 nmol kg-1, i.v.) were assessed in the same chronically-instrumented, conscious, Long Evans rats in the absence and in the presence of human alpha-CGRP [8-37] or ICI 118551, antagonists of CGRP1-receptors and beta 2-adrenoceptors, respectively. The selected doses of these antagonists caused specific inhibition of responses mediated by exogenous human alpha-CGRP and beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists, respectively. 2. Bradykinin administered alone as an i.v. bolus had a slight pressor effect accompanied by a marked tachycardia. There were early (at about 30 s) increases in flow and conductance in the mesenteric vascular bed, and delayed (at about 90 s), but qualitatively similar, changes in the hindquarters vascular bed. There were only slight increases in flow and conductance in the renal vascular bed. 3. Human alpha-CGRP [8-37] had no statistically significant effects on the responses to bolus doses of bradykinin. However, in the presence of ICI 118551, the pressor effect of bradykinin was significantly enhanced while its tachycardic effect was significantly suppressed. The hindquarters vasodilator effect of bradykinin was converted to a vasoconstriction and there was a slight renal vasoconstriction, but the mesenteric vasodilator effect of bradykinin was unchanged by ICI 118551. 4. In subsidiary experiments, in other animals, it was found that infusion of bradykinin (36 nmol kg-1 min-1) elicited a pattern of haemodynamic responses similar to that seen with bolus injections and, as in the latter case, the hindquarters hyperaemic vasodilation was inhibited by ICI 118551. In the presence of mecamylamine (at a dose sufficient to block reflex heart rate responses to rises or falls in arterial blood pressure) bolus injection or infusion of bradykinin still elicited increases in renal, mesenteric and hindquarters blood flow. However, in additional experiments in adrenal demedullated rats (n = 4) the hindquarters hyperaemic effect of bradykinin was absent, although the mesenteric hyperaemic effect remained. 5. The results indicate that the increase in hindquarters blood flow following administration of bradykinin in vivo is largely due to activation of beta 2-adrenoceptors by catecholamines released subsequent to direct stimulation of the adrenal medulla by the peptide. However, the bradykinin-induced increase in mesenteric blood flow does not depend on this mechanism.", 
    "108": "An age-related change in potency of L-isoprenaline in the presence of ascorbic acid, desmethylimipramine, corticosterone, pargyline, and phentolamine was obtained in tracheal strips from guinea pigs of differing ages between 6 and 40 weeks. The potency in the strips from 100-week-old guinea pigs did not significantly differ from that in strips from 40-week-old animals. Single cells were prepared from the tracheal muscles of 6-, 10-, 40-, and 100-week-old guinea pigs. The specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to the single cells was saturable. The dissociation constants of [3H]dihydroalprenolol were in good agreement with those of the membrane fractions from the guinea-pig tracheal muscles, and did not change with age. An excellent relationship between the potency of L-isoprenaline and the maximum binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol estimated in the preparations from 6- to 40-week-old guinea pigs was found, suggesting that the increase in the potency of L-isoprenaline is due to the increase in the maximum binding or receptor density. The value in the preparations from 100-week-old guinea pigs deviated significantly from the regression line. This suggests the possibility that the decrease in potency in the strips from 100-week-old animals is due to a change in post beta-receptor processes in responsiveness.", 
    "109": "Human beta 2-adrenergic receptors were overexpressed in chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human epitheloid carcinoma (HeLa) cells. Stable expression in these cells was achieved by transfection of a vector containing the cDNAs for the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor as well as for dihydrofolate reductase. By stepwise increases of the concentration of methotrexate - an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase - the expression in CHO cells could be increased to levels of almost 200 pmol/mg membrane protein, which is more than 1% of the total membrane protein. In contrast, overexpression of the receptors in HeLa cells by the same technique led to cell death. The receptors produced in overexpressing CHO cells were correctly processed and were fully functional with respect to their ligand binding and signalling properties. The adenylyl cyclase activity of membranes from these cells responded with extremely high sensitivity to the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. The receptors could be purified from these membranes to apparent homogeneity by solubilization and chromatography on a single affinity column. Thus, the expression system described here allows the preparation of human beta 2-adrenergic receptors in quantities sufficient for pharmacological and biochemical investigations.", 
    "110": "Net fluxes of potassium, calcium, sodium and chloride were examined in isolated perfused rat hearts during alpha-1-adrenoceptor stimulation. The ion measurements were performed in the non-recirculating perfusate. Hearts were exposed to alpha-1-adrenoceptor stimulation (phenylephrine 5 x 10(-5) mol/l in the presence of the beta-blocker timolol 10(-6) mol/l). During alpha-1-adrenoceptor stimulation perfusate potassium fell relatively rapidly by about 0.10 mmol/l after approximately 100 sec. followed by a slower rise. About 180 sec. after onset of alpha-1-adrenoceptor stimulation, the potassium level was about 0.06 mmol/l below the control concentration level. This reduction was eliminated by the alpha-1-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin (10(-7) mol/l). The effects on net calcium fluxes were measured at two different calcium concentrations. For both concentrations we found a small but statistically significant reduction of the calcium concentration in the perfusate after alpha-1-adrenoceptor stimulation. Neither sodium nor chloride perfusate concentrations showed statistical significant changes compared to control values. The present observations revealed the existence of alpha-1-adrenoceptor regulated mechanisms related to a net uptake of both potassium and calcium in rat heart.", 
    "111": "In perfused rat liver perivascular nerve stimulation (7.5 Hz, 20 V, 2 ms, 5 min) at the liver hilus caused an increase in glucose release, a shift of lactate uptake to output and a decrease in arterial, portal and total flow. The influence of the alpha 1-receptor blocker prazosin and the beta-antagonist propranolol on these nerve effects were studied in the isolated rat liver perfused via both the hepatic artery and the portal vein in three experimental series at 9 a.m., at 2 p.m. and at 8 p.m. 1) The nerve stimulation-dependent increase in glucose output was maximal at 9 a.m. (100%), halfmaximal at 2 p.m. (50%) and very low at 8 p.m. (15%). The alterations in arterial, portal and total flow were similar in all three series. 2) At 9 a.m., at 2 p.m. and at 8 p.m. 5 microM arterial plus portal prazosin nearly completely inhibited the metabolic alterations and blocked the reduction of arterial, portal and total flow by 80%. 3) At 9 a.m. 10 microM arterial, portal and arterial plus portal propranolol inhibited the increase in glucose release to less than 25% and the shift of lactate uptake to output to about 50%. At 2 p.m. this inhibitory effect was not observed, neither by selective arterial or portal, nor by simultaneous arterial plus portal addition of 10 microM propranolol. At 8 p.m. the influence of propranolol could not be studied because of the too small control values. The nerve stimulation-dependent reduction of arterial, portal and total flow was not influenced by propranolol, neither at 9 a.m. nor at 2 p.m.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "112": "1. [125I]-(-)pindolol binding was used to determine beta-adrenoceptor density in homogenate preparations of right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies from 43 non-rejecting patients over the first 13 months following cardiac transplantation. The selective beta 1 subtype antagonist ligand CGP 20712A was used to determine the subtype density in 32 of the patients. Biopsy specimens from 15 donor hearts were used as controls. 2. beta-adrenoceptor density (expressed in terms of fmol mg-1 protein) was increased in the group of transplanted hearts as a whole compared with the donor hearts with respect to total (35 +/- 2 vs 23 +/- 2) and the beta 1 subtype (25 +/- 2 vs 16 +/- 2) whereas the beta 2 subtype and radioligand dissociation constant did not differ. 3. Non-parametric analysis of variance of total receptor density over time revealed significant heterogeneity which appears to be due to a discrete increase in beta-adrenoceptor density during the 4th post operative month. 4. These results indicate that beta-adrenoceptor density is not constant following transplantation. Furthermore, the increase in receptor density following transplantation is due mainly to an increase in the beta 1 subtype without a significant change in the beta 2 subtype.", 
    "113": "In the opossum kidney cell line the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin; 5-HT)1B receptor is negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase via a Gi protein. Preincubation of opossum kidney cell line cell monolayers with 5-HT resulted in 5-HT1B receptor-mediated desensitization expressed as a 4-fold rightward shift of the dose-response curve and a 10 to 29% decrease of maximal inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production. These moderate decreases in potency and efficacy were concentration- and time-dependent. Maximal desensitization occurred with 3 hr of 5-HT preincubation. Preincubation with 5-HT caused no change in the potency or efficacy of alpha-2 adrenergic agonist-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production. Therefore, the desensitization caused by 5-HT preincubation appears to be homologous. Down-regulation of the 5-HT1B receptor, assessed with the high affinity radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol, also occurred, and was concentration- and time-dependent. Maximum down-regulation of 40% occurred after 20 hr of exposure to 10 microM 5-HT. These results demonstrate that, like other receptors coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, exposure of 5-HT1B receptors to an agonist causes desensitization of the functional response followed by down-regulation of the receptor.", 
    "114": "This study examined the effect of immobilization stress on the expression of muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors on thymocytes and lymphocytes obtained from 5-month-old L-E male rats. After 2 h immobilization (acute stress) there was a significant increase in specific binding of [3H]-DHA to beta-adrenergic receptors on thymocytes and on lymphocytes from the blood but not from the spleen, whereas [3H]-QNB binding to muscarinic receptors in those cells was not altered in comparison with the undisturbed control. Chronic immobilization stress (5 days, for 2 h) decreased the [3H]-QNB binding to lymphocytes collected from the spleen and blood but not from thymus; it caused neither a significant change in the 3H-DHA binding to thymocytes nor lymphocytes obtained from the blood and spleen."
