Analytical methods suited for their multianalyte detection are thus necessary. In this perspective, receptor assays were developed. The research activities undertaken in this study describe the solubilisation of a recombinant human beta(2)-adrenergic receptor produced in the inner membrane of genetically modified Escherichia coli, using the detergent n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside. Its potential to detect the presence of beta-agonists or beta-blockers in biological samples was evaluated. The solubilised beta(2)-adrenergic receptor retained its binding affinity in a radio-receptor assay based on the competition for the binding to receptors between a ligand (beta-agonist or antagonist) and the radioligand [(125)I]iodocyanopindolol. The IC(50) values ranged from 5+/-1 x 10(-8) M (clenbuterol) to 8+/-2 x 10(-6) M (isoxsuprine) for the beta-agonists tested and from 1.5+/-0.2 x 10(-10) M (carazolol) to 1.2+/-0.2 x 10(-5) M (metoprolol) for the beta-blockers tested. It was shown to have a lower limit of detection than a radio-receptor assay using the solubilised beta(2)-adrenoceptor expressed in a mammalian cell line. The solubilised recombinant human beta(2)-adrenoreceptor expressed in E. coli would be a useful tool to develop non radioactive multianalyte screening methods.",

For unsymmetrical epoxides, the regioselectivity was influenced by the electronic and steric factors associated with the epoxides and the amines. A complementarity in the regioselectivity was observed during the reaction of styrene oxide with aromatic and aliphatic amines: aromatic amines provided amino alcohols from nucleophilic attack at the benzylic carbon as major products whereas aliphatic amines resulted in formation of the amino alcohols through reaction at the terminal carbon atom of the epoxide ring as the major/sole products. Reaction of aniline with various glycidic ethers gave the amino alcohols by regioselective nucleophilic attack at the terminal carbon atom of the epoxide ring as the only/major product. Zinc(II) perchlorate hexahydrate was found to be the best catalyst compared to other metal perchlorates. The counteranion modulated the catalytic property of the various Zn(II) compounds that followed the order Zn(ClO4)2.(6)H2O>Zn(BF4)2 approximately Zn(OTf)2>ZnI2>ZnBr2>ZnCl2>Zn(OAc)2>Zn(CO3)2 in parallelism with the acidic strength of the corresponding protic acids (except for TfOH).

    "29": "Evidence is given that beta-blocker treatment differentially influences gene expression and up-regulation of beta(1)-adrenoceptors in human myocardium. Here, we investigate whether long-term treatment with carvedilol or metoprolol may functionally alter myofibrillar function in end-stage human heart failure. Investigations were performed in Triton X (1%, 4 degrees C, 20 h)-skinned fiber preparations of explanted hearts from patients undergoing heart transplantation due to idiopathic dilative cardiomyopathy. Five patients were not on beta-adrenoceptor blocker treatment (DCM_NBB), and 5 patients received either carvedilol (DCM_CAR) or metoprolol (DCM_MET). Nonfailing (NF) donor hearts (n = 5), which could not be transplanted due to technical reasons, were investigated for comparison. Ca(2+)-dependent tension (DT) development and actomyosin-ATPase activity (MYO) were measured and tension-dependent ATP consumption was calculated by the ratio of DT and MYO (\"tension cost\"). In addition, we measured the phosphorylation of troponin I (TNI) by back phosphorylation. Maximal DT and TNI phosphorylation were reduced, with myofibrillar Ca(2+) sensitivity of DT and MYO as well as tension cost being increased in DCM_NBB compared with NF. Metoprolol treatment restored TNI phosphorylation, decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity of tension development and of myosin-ATPase activity, but did not alter the tension-dependent ATP consumption. Carvedilol treatment improved maximal DT and significantly decreased tension-dependent ATP consumption without altering myofibrillar Ca(2+) sensitivity. TNI dephosphorylation was increased in patients treated with carvedilol. In conclusion, chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade functionally alters myofibrillar function. The more economic cross-bridge cycling in patients under carvedilol treatment may provide an explanation for the efficacy of carvedilol in the treatment of chronic heart failure patients.",

In addition, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), LV end-systolic volume (LVESV), and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) were calculated by echocardiography. In the DCM patients, the regional defect score index (RDSI), regional washout rate index (RWRI), and wall motion score index (WMSI) were also determined to evaluate regional adrenergic dysfunction and wall motion. Examinations were repeated in all DCM patients after standard treatment containing carvedilol at a dose of 10-20 mg/day (mean dose: 16 +/- 4 mg/day) for a mean of 12 +/- 1 months. Both the (123)I-MIBG scintigraphic and echocardiographic parameters were significantly worse in the DCM patients than the normal control subjects. After treatment, all of these parameters improved significantly in the DCM patients. There was a significant correlation between the changes of (123)I-MIBG findings and changes of the LVEDV and LVESV after treatment. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between changes of the WMSI and those of the RDSI or RWRI in DCM patients.",

However the implantation of a device in small children can have technical problems.

    "34": "A method using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been developed for the determination of 12 beta-blockers and beta(2)-agonists in wastewater samples. Extraction of the drugs was effected by an Oasis MCX cartridge with a strong cation resin adsorbent. Matrix coextractives were removed from the SPE cartridge by methanol prior to the elution of the drugs with a mixture of dichloromethane, 2-propranol, and ammonium hydroxide. The extract was analyzed by LC-MS/MS with electrospray ionization operating in the positive mode. Recovery of the 12 compounds was in most cases better than 85% at the fortification levels of 500 and 50 ng/L, with standard deviations between 3 and 7%. Based on a concentration factor of 250, the method detection limits ranged from 6 to 11 ng/L for the target compounds. No degradation of these drugs in spiked sewage effluent samples was observed over a storage period of 7 days at 4 degrees C in the dark. Many beta-blockers were detected in the 14 wastewater samples collected from seven Canadian sewage treatment plants; those occurring at the highest concentrations were atenolol, acebutolol, sotalol, and metroprolol, with overall median concentrations of 1370, 339, 282, and 257 ng/L, respectively. However, there was only a small decrease in the median concentrations of these beta-blockers between the primary and final effluent, suggesting that these drugs are not easily removed by the sewage treatment processes. As a result of selective extraction and effective removal of coextractives, no matrix effect was observed for the samples during LC-MS/MS analyses.", 
    "35": "The purpose of this research work was to establish mucoadhesive buccal devices of propranolol hydrochloride (PRH) in the forms of bilayered and multilayered tablets. The tablets were prepared using sodium carboxymethylcellulose (SCMC) and Carbopol-934 (CP) as bioadhesive polymers to impart mucoadhesion and ethyl cellulose (EC) to act as an impermeable backing layer. Buccal devices were evaluated by different parameters such as weight uniformity, content uniformity, thickness, hardness, surface pH, swelling index, ex vivo mucoadhesive strength, ex vivo mucoadhesion time, in vitro drug release, and in vitro drug permeation. As compared with bilayered tablets, multilayered tablets showed slow release rate of drug with improved ex vivo bioadhesive strength and enhanced ex vivo mucoadhesion time. The mechanism of drug release was found to be non-Fickian diffusion (value of n between 0.5 and 1.0) for both the buccal devices. The stability of drug in both the optimized buccal devices was tested for 6 hours in natural human saliva; both the buccal devices were found to be stable in natural human saliva. The present study concludes that mucoadhesive buccal devices of PRH can be a good way to bypass the extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism and to improve the bioavailability of PRH.",

The physicochemical compatibility of the drug and the polymers was studied by infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The results suggested no physicochemical incompatibility between the drug and the polymers. In vitro permeation studies were performed by using Franz diffusion cells. The results followed Higuchi kinetics (r = 0.9953-0.9979), and the mechanism of release was diffusion mediated. Based on physicochemical and in vitro skin permeation studies, patches coded as F3 (ethyl cellulose:polyvinylpyrrolidone, 7.5:2.5) and F6 (Eudragit RL:Eudragit RS, 8:2) were chosen for further in vivo studies. The bioavailability studies in rats indicated that the carvedilol transdermal patches provided steady-state plasma concentrations with minimal fluctuations and improved bioavailability of 71% (for F3) and 62% (for F6) in comparison with oral administration. The antihypertensive activity of the patches in comparison with that of oral carvedilol was studied using methyl prednisolone acetate-induced hypertensive rats. It was observed that both the patches significantly controlled hypertension from the first hour (P < .05). The developed transdermal patches increase the efficacy of carvedilol for the therapy of hypertension.",

Tablets containing hydroxyapatite and a pore forming agent (50% (w/w) Avicel PH 200/20, 37.5% and 50% corn starch/37.5% sorbitol) were manufactured by direct compression followed by sintering. The influence of pore forming agent (type and concentration), sinter temperature and sinter time on tablet properties was investigated. Sintering (1250 degrees C) revealed tablets with an acceptable friability (<1%). Using 50% (w/w) Avicel PH 200 as pore forming agent resulted in tablets combining the highest porosity (50%) and the highest median pore diameter (5 microm). Aqueous drug solutions (metoprolol tartrate, riboflavin sodium phosphate) were spiked on the tablet surface. The maximum volume of drug solution absorbed was limited (2x100 microl), revealing that these porous carriers were ideal for low dosed formulations. Drug release from the tablets was slow, independent of the drug. To accelerate drug release, tablets were manufactured using a modified gelcasting technique yielding tablets with a median pore size of 60 and 80 microm. Release from these tablets was drastically increased indicating that the permeability of the tablets was influenced by the pore size, shape and connectivity of the porous network. Changing and controlling these parameters made it possible to obtain drug delivery systems providing different drug delivery behaviour.",

However, significant heterogeneity exists in the effectiveness of beta-blockers among individual cases. We focused on 39 polymorphisms in 16 genes related to adrenergic system and investigated their association with the response to beta-blockers among 80 patients with CHF owing to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The polymorphisms of NET T-182C (P=0.019), ADRA1D T1848A (P=0.023) and ADRA1D A1905G (P=0.029) were associated with the improvement of left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) by beta-blockers. Furthermore, combined genotype analysis of NET T-182C and ADRA1D T1848A revealed a significant difference in LVFS improvement among genotype groups (P=0.011). These results suggest that NET (T-182C) and ADRA1D (T1848A and A1905G) polymorphisms are predictive markers of the response to beta-blockers. Genotyping of these polymorphisms may provide clinical insights into an individual difference in the response to the beta-blocker therapy in CHF.",

To identify an optimal treatment regimen for obese hypertensive patients, we studied the interactions between a drug-based weight loss approach by sibutramine and different antihypertensive drug regimens.",

Sibutramine treatment resulted in a significantly greater decrease in body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference and a significant increase in diastolic blood pressure during 24-hour blood pressure monitoring compared with placebo treatment. Sibutramine-induced weight loss and reduction of visceral obesity were markedly attenuated in the metoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide group compared with the other groups. Consistently, improvement in glucose tolerance and hypertriglyceridemia by sibutramine was abrogated in the cohort treated with metoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide compared with the other groups.", 
    "61": "The present study demonstrates for the first time that an antihypertensive combination therapy regimen with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers is more advantageous than a beta-blocker/diuretic-based regimen in supporting the weight-reducing actions and concomitant metabolic changes induced by sibutramine in obese hypertensive patients. These data may help to develop future comprehensive treatment strategies and guidelines for this high-risk patient population.", 
    "62": "Heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) is a measure of the variations in individual treatment response to the same agent across a population. Hypertension affords an appropriate model for investigators of HTE. Use of blood pressure measurement guidelines and consistent techniques help to reduce the potential variability associated with clinician measurements. Patient characteristics such as age and race/ethnicity can affect blood pressure, including patient response and adverse events observed with antihypertensive medication. Through pharmacogenetic advances, potential underlying causes for such variation are emerging. The growing number of clinical examples of mutations that affect antihypertensive response includes multiple polymorphisms within the components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The most prominent examples of these polymorphisms exist in the genes coding for angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. An understanding of the components of blood pressure variability and sources of HTE in antihypertensive therapy is important for analyzing published reports on this topic. It is also helpful when designing treatment protocols for individual patients with hypertension and in assessing their response to therapy.",

We conducted a prospective study including 100 patients hospitalized in the service of general medicine at the Calmette hospital in Phnom Penh. We analyzed the principal risk factors, clinical signs, nature of stroke, complications and markers of the vital and functional prognosis. This work shows the difficulties encountered in the initial care of stroke: delay or absence of hospitalization, cost of complementary examinations to be carried out to determine the nature and the aetiology of stroke and very low level of follow-up to ensure secondary prevention and functional rehabilitation. It can be explained in part by the socioeconomic and cultural level. Research like this one which assesses local needs for stroke prevention, treatment and rehabilitation should be conducted in developing countries to inform the planning and allocation of health care resources in order to reduce the burden of illness associated with stroke. The progressive improvement of the medical structures, and of the socioeconomic and cultural level will facilitate stroke care management.", 
    "64": "The effect of nebivolol (30.0, 60.0, or 90.0 microM) on the blood oxygen transport was studied by incubation with blood samples for 120 min. Nebivolol increased the values of p50 (pO2 at 50% hemoglobin saturation with oxygen) under real pH and pCO2 (by 4.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg at the lowest concentration (p < 0.01). The further (2- or 3- fold) growth in the concentration of nebivolol increased these values by 7.5 +/- 1.1 and 10.6 +/- 0.7 mm Hg, respectively (for both p < 0.01), thereby indicating the dose dependence of the drug effect. Greater drug concentration resulted in higher methemoglobin level and nitrate/nitrite content. The data can be explained by a change in the hemoglobin-oxygen affinity as a result of the influence of nebivolol through an autonomous intraerythrocyte system that regulates the blood oxygen-binding properties. In this case, NO acts as an important modifier of the hemoglobin function.", 
    "65": "The electrophysiological properties of cardiocyclide, nibentan and sotalol and their efficacy on a model of atrial fibrillation were compared in experiments in anaesthetized dogs. The electrophysiological parameters of drugs were investigated using the method of programmed electrical stimulation of myocardium on the background of excitation of the peripheral segment of the right vagus nerve with current pulses of increasing frequency. The atrial fibrillation was produced by short stimulation (10 pulses) of the right auriculum (10 Hz, 4 thresholds). Cardiocyclide was injected in a dose of 2.5-5.0 mg/kg; nibentan, 0.25 mg/kg; and sotalol, 2.5 mg/kg. Cardiocyclide was found to prevent vagotonic atrial fibrillation in 80% of cases; under vagal stimulation this drug maintained the electrophysiological attributes and exhibited the frequency-independent action inherent in this agent. Nibentan completely retained its ability to prolong the ventricular repolarization under vagal stimulation conditions, increased the effective atrial and ventricular refractory periods, and showed the ability to prevent and eliminate the vagotonic atrial fibrillation in 80-90% of cases. Under vagal stimulation, sotalol increased the repolarization and prolonged the effective refractory atrial and ventricular periods, reduced the heart rate, and suppressed the sinus node function. The action of sotalol was frequency-dependent. Sotalol was found to prevent the vagotonic atrial fibrillation in 60% of cases.",

Following pre-medication with saline, atropine and/or propranolol, the horses ran for 2.5 min at a speed of 8 m/sec at a 10% incline and T was calculated from HR after the exercise. Secondly, 7 Thoroughbred horses were then trained for 11 weeks and T and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) measured at intervals of 1 or 2 weeks. In 6 horses, T with atropine pre-medication was also measured before and after the whole training period. Furthermore, the HR variability at rest was evaluated by power spectral analysis at intervals of 3 or 4 weeks.",

Parasympathetic blockade significantly decreased T only after and not before, the training; however, T was lower in post training than in pretraining, irrespective of parasympathetic blockade. On the other hand, parasympathetic activity at rest was attenuated and sympathetic activity became predominant following the training.", 
    "70": "Heart rate recovery is affected by sympathetic withdrawal and parasympathetic reactivation in horses and suggests that physical training hastened HR recovery by improving the parasympathetic function after exercise with aerobic capacity. However, the effects of other factors need to be considered because the training effect appeared on T even under parasympathetic blockade. The parasympathetic activity at rest is in contrast to that after exercise, suggesting that T does not reflect parasympathetic activity at rest.",

    "72": "In the last years the treatment of heart failure has radically changed due to the results of multicenter clinical trials. The antagonism of neurohormonal systems has proved to be the only strategy, which favorably modifies the prognosis of the patients with heart failure. Particularly, the effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and beta-blockers has been proven in patients with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction; more recently, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and aldosterone blockers have shown to improve the outcome in heart failure. The public health im portance of translating this body of evidence of research into clinical practice is paramount. We used data from the IN-CHF registry to examine changes in the use of pharmacological treatment from 1995 to 2005. The proportion of patients receiving an ACE-inhibitor was slightly higher in the 1995-2000 than after but this difference is not statistically significant. The use of \"recommended therapies\" as beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and ARBs increased significantly in these 10 years. The use of beta-blockers also increased significantly among elderly patients and patients in advanced NYHA class. Patients treated with the combination of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs are very few (1.1%), even if this association is now recommended by the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. The same analysis repeated after the CHARM and Val-HeFT publication shows that this association is used in 2.0% of the patients. The proportion of patients treated with a beta-blocker plus ACE-inhibitors plus ARB is only 0.8%. Use of digitalis and calcium channel blockers fell continuously from 1995 whereas use of diuretics and anticoagulants remained relatively constant. Statins are becoming widely used in this population (from 5 to 20%) even if the information on the effect of these drugs in heart failure is still incomplete.",

The importance of a sound (family) history is demonstrated. Besides specific correlates for arrhythmias in the history of a patient, the long term consequences of dyspnoe on exertion and hypertension are outlined. In 80% of patients sudden death is due to myocardial ischemia or interstitial myocardial fibrosis which in turn result from acquired diseases such as coronary artery disease and hypertension. Against this background the importance of the prevention of sudden cardiac death by nonantiarrhythmics drugs is stressed. Examples of under-utilization of therapy guidelines are given with special reference to beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "74": "Current treatment goals in heart failure (HF) aim to improve both survival and quality of life (QoL) of patients. In this brief communication, we reviewed randomized controlled trials that assessed the impact of pharmacological treatment on QoL, and we discussed some methodological limitations of QoL assessment in HF. Studies that assessed QoL with a disease-specific questionnaire were included. We found that at present there is a paradox in HF treatment. Life prolonging therapies, such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers improve modestly or only delay the progressive worsening of QoL in HF. Treatment with beta blockers does not affect QoL in any way. However, this neutral effect of beta blockers may also be due to some methodological limitations, such as the small number of patients included in beta blocker trials or the short duration of follow-up. Disease-specific questionnaires may also have some limitations, e.g. are not sensitive enough to detect small changes in QoL. On the other hand, therapies that significantly improve QoL in HF (e.g. inotropic agents) do not seem beneficial in relation to survival. We conclude that QoL in HF remains an open field, in which new therapies but also clarification of methodology is required. In the mean time, the use of life prolonging therapies appears as a safe measure to modestly improve or maintain QoL.",

    "76": "Isolated rat hearts underwent 30 min ischemia and 120 min reperfusion. Infarct size was evaluated using nitro-blue tetrazolium staining. In Control hearts infarct size was 61+/-5% of risk area. PostC (5 cycles of 10 s reperfusion/ischemia) reduced infarct size to 22+/-4% (p<0.01). PostC protection was abolished by B2 BK receptor-antagonists (HOE140 or WIN64338), nitric oxide synthase-inhibitor (L-nitro-arginine-methylester), protein kinase G (PKG)-blocker (8-bromoguanosine-3',5'-cyclic-monophosphorothioate), and mitochondrial K(ATP) (mK(ATP))-blocker (5-hydroxydecanoate) each given for 3 min only. Since 3 min of BK-infusion (100 nM) did not reproduce PostC protection, protocols with Intermittent-BK infusion were used to mimic PostC: a) 5 cycles of 10 s oxygenated-no-BK/oxygenated+BK buffer; b) 5 cycles of 10 s oxygenated-no-BK/hypoxic+BK buffer. Both protocols with Intermittent-BK attenuated infarct size (36+/-5% and 38+/-4%, respectively; p<0.05 vs Control and NS vs PostC for both; NS vs each other). Intermittent-BK protection was abolished by the same antagonists used to prevent PostC protection. Intermittence of re-oxygenation only (5 cycles of 10 s oxygenated/hypoxic buffer) did not reproduce PostC. Yet, cardioprotection was triggered by intermittent mK(ATP) activation with diazoxide, but not by intermittent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation with purine/xanthine oxidase. ROS scavengers (N-acetyl-L-cysteine or 2-mercaptopropionylglycine), given for 3 min only, abolished PostC-, Intermittent BK-and diazoxide-induced protection.", 
    "77": "Intermittent targeting of specific cellular sites (i.e. BK B2 receptors and mK(ATP) channels) during early reperfusion triggers PostC protection via ROS signaling. Since neither intermittent oxygenation nor exogenous ROS generators can trigger protection, it is likely that intermittent autacoid accumulation and ROS compartmentalization may play a pivotal role in PostC-triggering.",

Voluminous clinical trial data support beginning drug therapy with low-dose chlorthalidone, unless the patient has a specific indication for a different drug. Additional drugs (typically in the sequence, angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium antagonist, beta-blocker, alpha-blocker, aldosterone antagonist, direct vasodilator, and centrally acting alpha(2)-agonist) can be added to achieve the blood pressure goal (usually <140/90 mm Hg, but <130/80 mm Hg for diabetics and those with chronic kidney disease).

    "79": "Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is common in patients with cardiovascular disease. Although numerous efforts have sought to understand CAM types and the prevalence of CAM, whether patients preferentially use CAM instead of evidence-based therapies is unknown. Self-reported use of CAM and evidence-based therapies in a prospective registry of hospitalized patients with acute coronary syndrome from March 1, 2001 to October 31, 2002 were examined. Poisson regression models were used to assess whether CAM use was independently associated with lower rates of aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin use in 596 patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD). Overall, CAM use was 19% in patients with CAD. Higher proportions of patients who used CAM were non-Caucasian (31% vs 12%), uninsured (12% vs 7%), economically burdened (58% vs 29%), and had depression (13% vs 6%, p<0.05 for all). Patients who used CAM were more likely to use beta blockers (64% vs 46%, p=0.008) and as likely to use aspirin (73% vs 74%, p=0.90) and statins (71% vs 68%, p=0.76) as non-CAM users. Adjusting for demographic and clinical factors did not change results (CAM users: RR 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.60 for using beta blockers, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.11 for using aspirin, and RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.28 for using statins). In conclusion, although CAM users with established CAD have worse socioeconomic status than nonusers, we found no evidence that they were less compliant with evidence-based therapies.", 
    "80": "Although serotonin, serotonin uptake inhibitors and serotonin precursors (including tryptophan or 5-hydroxytryptophan) are known to have hypoglycemic action in rodents or human, it is not clear whether serotonin has hypoglycemic effect in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ-diabetic rats). The aim of this study was to investigate the action of serotonin in regulating the plasma glucose STZ-diabetic rats. Plasma glucose, insulin, beta-endorphin and adrenaline were assessed after intraperitoneal administration of serotonin. Serotonin produced hypoglycemic effects without altering plasma insulin and adrenaline levels but increasing beta-endorphin level in STZ-diabetic rats. The glycogen content in soleus muscle was increased at 90 min after application of serotonin (0.3 mg/kg) in STZ-diabetic rats. Dihydroergotamine (non-selective 5-HT receptor blocker) and pimozide (5-HT(7) receptor blocker) abolished the hypoglycemic effect of serotonin in STZ-diabetic rats. Serotonin-induced hypoglycemic effect in association with the increase of beta-endorphin release was abolished in bilaterally adrenalectomized STZ-diabetic rats. In isolated adrenal gland of STZ-diabetic rats, the increase of beta-endorphin secretion in response to serotonin was reduced by either dihydroergotamine or pimozide. Pretreatment with naloxone (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented serotonin-induced plasma glucose lowering effect in STZ-diabetic rats. The results demonstrated that serotonin may activate 5-HT(7) receptor on rat adrenal gland to enhance of beta-endorphin secretion, which then stimulates the opioid receptor to increase peripheral glucose utilization, resulting in decreased plasma glucose levels in STZ-diabetic rats.",

The bed voidage, axial dispersion coefficient, overall mass transfer coefficients as well as equilibrium constants for the chromatographic enantiomeric separation were evaluated by moment analysis on the basis of the solid film linear driving force model. The equilibrium constants were found to be 3.81, 5.24, 9.45 and 19.41 for the stereoisomers (SRS)-, (SRR)-, (RSS)- and (RSR)-nadolol, respectively.

    "82": "Endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis may play an important role in the destruction of pancreatic beta-cells, thus contributing to the development of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. One of the regulators of endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated cell death is the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (Chop). We presently studied the molecular regulation of Chop expression in insulin-producing cells (INS-1E) in response to three pro-apoptotic and endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducing agents, namely the cytokines interleukin-1beta + interferon-gamma, the free fatty acid palmitate, and the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum pump Ca(2+) ATPase blocker cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). Detailed mutagenesis studies of the Chop promoter showed differential regulation of Chop transcription by CPA, cytokines, and palmitate. Whereas palmitate- and cytokine-induced Chop expression was mediated via a C/EBP-activating transcription factor (ATF) composite and AP-1 binding sites, CPA induction required the C/EBP-ATF site and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response element. Cytokines, palmitate, and CPA induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation in INS-1E cells leading to activation of the transcription factor ATF4. Chop transcription in response to cytokines and palmitate depends on the binding of ATF4 and AP-1 to the Chop promoter, but distinct AP-1 dimers were formed by cytokines and palmitate. These results suggest a differential response of beta-cells to diverse endoplasmic reticulum stress inducers, leading to a differential regulation of Chop transcription.", 
    "83": "Beta-adrenoceptor mediated vasorelaxation and cAMP production decline during maturation and aging in rat aorta. beta-adrenoceptor-stimulated vasorelaxation is mainly triggered by Gsalpha-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase. beta(2)-adrenoceptors can also activate Gi protein which inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity. In this study, we examined the role of Gi proteins in the decreased beta-adrenoceptor mediated responses during maturation. Pertussis toxin treatment of aortic rings to inhibit Gialpha activation completely restored age related decline in isoproterenol-stimulated maximal vasorelaxation in 3-month old rats. This treatment increased the potency, but not the maximal response of isoproteronol to produce vasorelaxation in 6 month old rats. The maximal isoproteronol stimulated cAMP responses were also partially restored in pertussis toxin-treated rings from 3 or 6-month old rats. We also examined beta-adrenoceptor stimulated binding of (35)[S]GTPgammaS to Gsalpha and Gialpha1/2 in aortic membranes from 1, 3 and 6-month old rats. In 1-month old rats, isoproterenol-stimulated (35)[S]GTPgammaS binding to Gsalpha was significantly higher than that of 3 or 6-month old rats. Isoproterenol-stimulated (35)[S]GTPgammaS binding to Gialpha1/2 was found to be significantly increased in 3 or 6-month old rats compared to 1-month old rats. The results of this study showed that beta-adrenoceptor-mediated activation of Gs and Gi proteins was declined and increased, respectively, and inhibition of the Gi mediated activity by pertussis toxin treatment partially restored impaired vasorelaxation and cAMP response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation during maturation in rat aorta. The decrease in beta-adrenoceptor mediated activation of Gs gradually increased during maturation. All together these results indicated that beta-adrenoceptor mainly activates Gs protein in aorta from 1-month old rats, while it activates Gi and with a certain degree of decline it also activates Gs in aorta from 3 and 6-months old rats and not only the increase in beta-adrenoceptor coupling to Gi but also the decrease in its coupling to Gs play a role in the impaired beta-adrenoceptor responses in rat aorta during maturation.",

Twelve months after carvedilol therapy, a significant improvement in LA and left ventricular (LV) function was observed. To investigate the beneficial effects of carvedilol, patients were separated into 2 groups according to the presence of pretreatment LV contractile reserve (CR) (ejection fraction [EF] increases >20% after dobutamine infusion): Group A consisted of 18 patients with CR and Group B of 17 patients without CR. After carvedilol treatment, both the LV and LA function were improved in group A (P < .01 for all). However, in group B, only the LA function was significantly improved (left atrial ejection volume increased from 10.4 +/- 3 mL to 15.4 +/- 6.7, P < .01 and LA ejection fraction from 19.6 +/- 45.3% to 29.4 +/- 12.5%, P < .01), whereas the LV contractile reserve has partially reappeared (EF from 29.9 +/- 4.5% at baseline, increased after dobutamine infusion to 35.8 +/- 6.8%, P < .0001).",

The patients were randomized to receive candesartan titrated to 32 mg 1 per day versus placebo in double-blind fashion for 6 months. Nt-proBNP, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, glucose, insulin, and fasting insulin resistance index were analyzed. Candesartan decreased Nt-proBNP (median value = 12.4% versus -20.4%; [candesartan] P = .05), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (+5.32% versus -20.3% [candesartan]; P = 0.046), without significantly influencing serum interleukin-6, interleukin-18, adhesion molecules, or markers of oxidative stress.

Strategies are needed to increase the proportion of patients who are receiving evidence-based therapies. Predischarge initiation of evidence-based therapies has effectively increased utilization in the acute coronary syndrome population. Predischarge initiation of beta-blockade in patients hospitalized for heart failure has also been shown to be safe and effective for improving beta-blocker use at 60 days. Larger registry initiatives have demonstrated improved use of evidence-based therapies associated with implementation of a performance improvement process system.

We created a Markov decision model to compare BB and EVL in such patients, examining both cost-effectiveness (cost per life year [LY]) and cost-utility (cost per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]). Outcomes included cost per LY, cost per QALY, proportions of persons with VB, TIPS, and all-cause mortality. EVL and BB were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR). When considering only LYs, initial EVL exceeds the benchmark of 50,000 dollars/LY, with an ICER of 98,407 dollars. However, when quality of life (QoL) is considered, EVL is cost-effective compared to BB (ICUR of 25,548 dollars/QALY). In sensitivity analysis, EVL is cost-effective if the yearly risk of EV bleeding is > or = 0.26 (base case 0.15), the relative risk of bleeding on BB is > or = 0.69 (base case 0.58), or if the relative risk of bleeding with EVL is < 0.27 (base case 0.35). The ICUR favored EVL unless the relative risk of bleeding on BB is < 0.46, the relative risk of bleeding with EVL is > 0.46, or the time horizon is < or = 24 months. Whether EVL is \"cost-effective\" relative to BB therapy for primary prevention of EV bleeding depends on whether LYs or QALYs are considered. If only LYs are considered, then EVL is not cost-effective compared to BB therapy; however, if QoL is considered, then EVL is cost-effective.", 
    "94": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is an increasingly common medical condition and the fastest growing cardiovascular diagnosis in North America. Over one-third of patients with heart failure also have renal insufficiency. It has been shown that renal insufficiency confers worsened outcomes to patients with heart failure. However, a majority of the larger and therapy-defining heart failure medication and device trials exclude patients with advanced renal dysfunction. These studies also infrequently perform subgroup analyses based on the degree of renal dysfunction. The lack of information on heart failure patients who have renal insufficiency likely contributes to their being prescribed mortality and morbidity reducing medications and receiving diagnostic and therapeutic procedures at lower rates than heart failure patients with normal renal function. Inclusion of patients with renal insufficiency in heart failure studies and published guidelines for medication, device, and interventional therapies would likely improve patient outcomes.", 
    "95": "St John's wort (SJW) is known to induce cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein through pregnane X-receptor activation. Our study evaluated the effects of long-term SJW administration on oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics of the nonmetabolized in vivo probe of P-glycoprotein, talinolol, in relation to intestinal P-glycoprotein expression. In a controlled, randomized study (N=9), the pharmacokinetics of oral (50 mg) and intravenous talinolol (30 mg) was determined before and after 12 days SJW (900 mg daily, Jarsin 300). Duodenal biopsies were taken and MDR1 genotypes assessed. SJW reduced the oral talinolol bioavailability by 25% (P=0.049) compared with water control. A 93% increase in oral clearance (P=0.177) and a 31% reduction in area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC; P=0.030) were observed. Renal and nonrenal clearance (CLNR), elimination half-life, peak serum drug concentration (Cmax), and time to reach Cmax were not significantly altered. After intravenous talinolol, SJW affected only CLNR (35% increase compared with water, P=0.006). SJW increased MDR1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) as well as P-glycoprotein levels in the duodenal mucosa. Subjects with the combined MDR1 genotype comprising 1236C>T, 2677G>T/A, and 3435C>T polymorphisms had lower intestinal MDR1 mRNA levels and displayed an attenuated inductive response to SJW as assessed by talinolol disposition. Long-term SJW decreased talinolol AUC with a corresponding increase in intestinal MDR1 expression, suggesting that SJW has a major inductive effect on intestinal P-glycoprotein. Interestingly, the magnitude of induction appeared to be affected by MDR1 genotype.", 
    "96": "Zhi-Fuzi (Radix Aconiti lateralis preparata) is prescribed fairly frequently in Chinese medicine clinical practice for treating the complications of cirrhosis. However, scientific evidence regarding its efficacy and safety has not been available until now; in addition, its treatment efficacy has not yet been evaluated in well-designed clinical trials. Hence, we investigated the hemodynamic effects of Zhi-Fuzi in conscious rats with portal vein ligation (PVL) and the safety in normal rats. Our study included 3 parts: (i) early administration during which the hemodynamic effects of low and high doses of Zhi-Fuzi (0.4 and 0.8 g/kg twice daily) and propranolol (15 and 30 mg/kg twice daily) administered for 14 days after PVL on male Sprague-Dawley rats were evaluated; (ii) late administration during which the other group of PVL rats received 2.4 g/kg of Zhi-Fuzi twice daily from the 15th to 28th postoperative day; hemodynamic effects were measured when the Zhi-Fuzi treatment was finished; and (iii) safety evaluation during which 2 groups of normal rats were administered Zhi-Fuzi (0.4 and 0.8 g/kg twice daily) for 14 days; biochemical and histopathologic studies were completed after hemodynamic measurement. In early administration the portal pressures in rats receiving low and high doses of Zhi-Fuzi, low and high doses of propranolol, and distilled water were 13.81 +/- 0.11, 11.59 +/- 0.07, 17.09 +/- 0.06, 14.52 +/- 0.29, and 20.11 +/- 0.22 mm Hg, respectively. The high dose of Zhi-Fuzi exerted more portal hypotensive effects than propranolol and simultaneously ameliorated the systemic arterial hypotension in PVL rats. The late administration of Zhi-Fuzi also significantly reduced the elevated portal pressure (14.56 +/- 0.19 vs. 19.50 +/- 0.31 mm Hg in control, P < 0.05). There were no adverse effects seen in normal rats receiving Zhi-Fuzi. The results suggest that Zhi-Fuzi is a potential drug for the prophylaxis and treatment of portal hypertension.", 
    "97": "To determine the activity of a major intestinal esterase in the first-pass hydrolysis of O-isovaleryl-propranolol (isovaleryl-PL), a model ester compound, rat intestinal jejunum and blood vessels were perfused simultaneously after inhibition of a carboxylesterase (CES) by bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (BNPP). BNPP specifically inhibits approximately 90% of CES activity without influencing aminopeptidase activity or the transport of L-leucyl-p-nitroanilide and p-nitroaniline, nonester compounds. When isovaleryl-PL was perfused into the jejunal lumen after BNPP treatment, its absorption clearance (7.60 +/- 0.74 microl/min) increased approximately 3-fold compared with control, whereas its degradation clearance (32.5 +/- 5.40 microl/min) decreased to 23% of control. Therefore, CES seems to be mainly responsible for the intestinal first-pass hydrolysis of isovaleryl-PL. This finding is consistent with the results from studies of in vitro BNPP inhibition in the mucosal S9 fraction. V(max) values for valeryl-PL, isovaleryl-PL, and p-nitrophenyl acetate in the jejunal S9 fraction were 1.7- to 2.5-fold higher than that in the ileal S9 fraction, which agreed with the jejunum/ileum ratio (approximately 1.5-fold) of mRNA expression levels for the CES2 isozymes, AB010635 and AY034877. These findings indicated that CESs expressed in the intestine markedly contribute to first-pass hydrolysis in both jejunum and ileum.",

    "103": "Propranolol-HCl, a water soluble drug, was bound to Indion 254, a cation exchange resin, and the resulting resinate was microencapsulated with polystyrene using an oil-in-water emulsion-solvent evaporation method with a view to achieve prolonged drug release in simulated gastric and intestinal fluid. The effect of various formulation parameters on the characteristics of the microcapsules was studied. The diameter of the resinate-loaded polystyrene microcapsules increased with increase in the concentration of emulsion stabilizer and coat/core ratio and decreased with increase in the volume of organic disperse phase. The variation in the size of the microcapsules appeared to be related with the inter-facial viscosity which was influenced by the viscosity of both the aqueous dispersion medium and the organic disperse phase. The resinate encapsulation efficiency and hence the drug entrapment efficiency of the microcapsules increased with increase in the concentration of emulsion stabilizer and coat/core ratio and decreased with increase in the volume of organic disperse phase. These characteristics were found to depend on the extent of formation of fractured microcapsules and subsequent partitioning of the resinate into the aqueous dispersion medium. The degree of fracture on the microcapsules depended on the viscosity of the aqueous dispersion medium and the organic disperse phase. The uncoated resinate discharged the drug quite rapidly following the typical particle diffusion process. Although the desorption of the drug from the resinate was independent of pH of the dissolution media, increase in ionic strength increased the drug desorption. On the other hand, release of drug from the coated resinate was considerably prolonged and followed a diffusion controlled model. The prolongation of drug release was dependent on the uniformity of coating which was influenced by the formulation parameters. The drug release from the microcapsules was also found to be independent of pH of the dissolution media and increased with increase in ionic strength. The pH-independent release of the drug from both the uncoated and microencapsulated resinate was due to pH-independent solubility of the drug and high equilibrium concentration of the resinate in both the dissolution media. Polystyrene appeared to be a suitable polymer to provide prolonged release of propranolol independent of pH of the dissolution media.",

To satisfy the different application purposes, MIPs with well controlled physical forms in different size ranges are highly desirable. For examples, MIP nanoparticles are very suitable to be used to develop binding assays and for microfluidic separations, whereas MIP beads with diameter of 1.5-3 microm can be more appropriate to use in new analytical liquid chromatography systems. Previous studies have demonstrated that imprinted microspheres and nanoparticles can be synthesized using a simple precipitation polymerization method. Despite that the synthetic method is straightforward, the final particle size obtained has been difficult to adjust for a given template. In this work, we initiated to study new synthetic conditions to obtain MIP beads with controllable size in the nano- to micro-meter range, using racemic propranolol as a model template. Varying the composition of the cross-linking monomer allowed the particle size of the MIP beads to be altered in the range of 130 nm to 2.4 microm, whereas the favorable binding property of the imprinted beads remained intact. The chiral recognition sites were further characterized with equilibrium binding analysis using tritium-labeled (S)-propranolol as a tracer. In general, the imprinted sites displayed a high chiral selectivity: the apparent affinity of the (S)-imprinted sites for (S)-propranolol was 20 times that of for (R)-propranolol.

Linear regression for 50 microL injection yielded a detection limit calculated as 0.04 microg mL(-1) of propranolol HCl in KRB (R(2)>0.999). However, linearity for dissolution monitoring was not given for the complete range of concentrations and first order polynomial calibration was established (R(2)>0.9999). To conclude, the SIA system was able to monitor simultaneously dissolution and permeation of the immediate release propranolol HCl tablets and the authors succeeded in automating the apparatus for combined measurement of dissolution and permeation.

    "135": "Age-related increase in the density of thymic noradrenergic fibres and noradrenaline (NA) concentration is proposed to be associated with thymic involution and altered thymopoiesis. To test this hypothesis thymocyte differentiation/maturation and thymic structure were studied in 18-month-old male Wistar rats subjected to 14-day-long propranolol (P) blockade of beta-adrenoceptors (beta-ARs). The treatment primarily resulted in changes in the T-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent stages of thymopoiesis, which led to an increase in both the relative and absolute numbers of the most mature single positive (SP) CD4(+)CD8(-) (including cells with the CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory phenotype) and CD4(-)CD8(+) TCRalphabeta(high) thymocytes. Accordingly, in the thymi of these rats an increase in both numerical density and absolute number of medullary thymocytes encompassing mainly the most mature SP cells was found. These findings, together with an increase in the thymocyte surface expression of the regulatory molecule Thy-1 (CD90) (implicated in negative regulation of TCRalphabeta-dependent thymocyte selection thresholds) in the same rats, may suggest increased positive/reduced negative thymocyte selection. Collectively, the results indicate that a decline in thymic efficiency in generating both conventional and regulatory T cells, and consequently in immune function, in aged rats may be, at least partly, attenuated by long-term blockade of beta-ARs with P.",

Acellular capillaries and proliferating endothelial cells were increased by 3- and 1.6-fold, respectively, in diabetic Ren-2 controls and reduced with 4 and 10 mg of valsartan and further reduced with 40 mg of valsartan. Atenolol had no effect on retinal pathology in diabetic Ren-2 rats.", 
    "143": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system but not antihypertensive therapy with atenolol reduces vascular pathology in diabetic Ren-2 retina, suggesting that angiotensin II is a causative factor and therapeutic target in diabetic retinopathy.", 
    "144": "To investigate the effect of various ocular hypotensive eyedrops on the intraocular pressure (IOP) fluctuations caused by the postural change in patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG).", 
    "145": "Randomized crossover single-blind study.", 
    "146": "Twenty-four eyes of 24 newly diagnosed NTG patients were enrolled. One of the three eyedrops including timolol maleate, latanoprost, and brinzolamide was randomly administered for one month. Each patient received all three eyedrops with a one-month washout period between the drugs. The IOP at baseline and after each treatment trial was measured in both sitting and supine positions.", 
    "147": "Compared with the baseline level, the magnitude of IOP elevation associated with the postural change did not alter significantly by the application of any eyedrops (one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance, P = .288).", 
    "148": "The mechanism of action underlying the IOP change with the postural change is different from the pharmacologic action of these hypotensive agents.", 
    "149": "Endogenous myocardial nitric oxide (NO) may modulate the transition from adaptive to maladaptive remodeling leading to heart failure. In rodent models of pressure overload or myocardial infarction, the three NO synthase (NOS) isoforms were shown to play a neutral, protective, or even adverse role in myocardial remodeling, depending on the quantity of NO produced, the location of each NOS and their regulators, the prevailing oxidant stress and resultant NO/oxidant balance, as well as NOS coupling/dimerization. Beside neuronal NOS and--in specific conditions--inducible NOS isoforms, endothelial NOS (eNOS) exerts cardioprotective effects on pressure-overload, ischemia/reperfusion, and myocardial infarction-induced myocardial remodeling, provided the enzyme remains in a coupled state. Besides its effects on excitation-contraction coupling in response to stretch, eNOS acts as an \"endogenous beta-blocker\" by restoring the sympathovagal balance, opposing excessive hypertrophy as well as promoting vasodilatation and neoangiogenesis, thereby contributing to tissue repair. As eNOS was also shown to mediate the beneficial effects of cardiovascular drugs commonly used in patients with heart failure, strategies to increase its expression and/or coupled catalytic activity in the myocardium offer new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of this disease.", 
    "150": "To investigate the effects of carvedilol on stabilizing atherosclerosis plaque.", 
    "151": "Forty five male Japanese white rabbits were divided randomly into 5 groups with 9 for each. One group was fed up with normal diet as blank control. In other four groups, the common carotid artery of rabbits fed up with high cholesterol diet were injured by balloon. Three groups of them were transfected by wild-type p53 gene 8 weeks later, and then two groups of them were treated with carvedilol (3 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1)) and metoprolol (6 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1)) respectively, high cholesterol diet should be continued for other 4 weeks. Serum lipid, hypersensitive C-reaction protein (hsCRP), oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) were measured in 0, 8, 12 weeks after experiment. The apoptosis rate of smooth muscle cell (SMC) in endomembrane and the local expression of p53, bcl-2, bax, alpha-actin were examined after experiment, and the carotid arteries were examined by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.", 
    "152": "The typical carotid atherosclerotic plaques were observed in balloon-injured groups. The local expression rates of p53 in groups transfected by wild type p53 gene were higher obviously than them in other two groups (P < 0.01). Compared with the rabbits received simple transfection, the thickness of the fibrous cap in rabbits received carvedilol and metoprolol were all increased, but the change could be observed significantly in carvedilol group (P < 0.05). Compared with metoprolol, carvedilol could reduce the level of serum hsCRP, oxLDL, MDA, and increase the concentration of SOD and GSH-PX significantly (P < 0.05 or 0.01), but two medicines had no obvious influence to serum lipid. The apoptosis rate of SMC in endomembrane, the local expression of bax gene and bax/bcl-2 ratio were decreased, the positive expression rates of alpha-actin and bcl-2 were enhanced in carvedilol group (P < 0.01).", 
    "153": "Both carvedilol and metoprolol can improve the stability of the plaque, but carvedilol is superior. Its mechanisms may lie in that carvedilol still has function of anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, decreasing the apoptosis rate of SMC in addition to its function of blocking beta-receptor.", 
    "154": "To study quality of therapy of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients in primary health care institutions of Kemerovo city.", 
    "155": "Records for 200 outpatients with CHF admitted to cardiological departments of Kemerovo hospitals were analysed. The treatment quality was assessed by special sheets reflecting treatment of CHF patients.", 
    "156": "CHF most frequently resulted from ischemic heart disease and arterial hypertenion (67.6 and 18.9% patients, respectively). Among medicines, ACE inhibitors in subnormal doses were used most frequently (70.9%), less often were administered disaggregants (52.4%), beta-adrenoblockers in low doses (50.4%), diuretic drugs (43.3%), cardiac glycosides (16.5%) and aldosteron antagonists (28.6%). Calcium antagonists were prescribed to 19.7%, metabolic medication--to 22.1%, nitrates --to 37.8% patients.", 
    "157": "As a rule, CHF treatment in outpatient clinics of Kemerovo was made according to national standards except underestimation of beta-adrenoblockers, cardiac glycosides and too frequent administration of calcium antagonists and some metabolic drugs.",

    "159": "Report of a case of heart failure occurring in a patient with AN and a review of the literature.", 
    "160": "A 56 year old woman with a 25 year history of AN binge-purge subtype experienced increasing shortness of breath on exertion, orthopnea, and swelling of the ankles. Investigations revealed a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. A diagnosis of heart failure caused by severe prolonged protein-calorie malnutrition was made. She was treated with a diuretic, a beta adrenergic blocker and an angiotension enzyme inhibitor. Her cardiac function returned to normal after a year of refeeding. Protein-calorie malnutrition, ipecac toxicity, and deficiencies of thiamine, phosphorus, magnesium, and selenium have been reported to cause heart failure in patients with AN.", 
    "161": "If shortness of breath occurs in AN it may be a symptom of heart failure. The diagnosis is further suggested by increased jugular venous pressure, increasing shortness of breath on exertion, and pulmonary crepitations at the bases of the lungs on physical examination. The chest x-ray usually shows pulmonary venous redistribution, the electrocardiogram may be normal, and the echocardiogram should document a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Standard medical therapy for heart failure should be started. In addition, a history of ipecac use should be taken, deficiencies should be corrected, and weight restoration can reverse cardiac abnormalities.", 
    "162": "It is still unclear whether celiprolol, a beta(1)-selective blocker, reduces myocardial infarct size. This study will examine whether celiprolol reduces myocardial infarct size, as well as investigate the mechanisms for its infarct size-reducing effect in rabbits.", 
    "163": "Japanese white rabbits underwent 30 min of ischemia and 48 h of reperfusion. Celiprolol (1 or 10 mg x kg (-1) x h(-1) for 60 min, iv) was administered 20 min before ischemia with or without pretreatment with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME, 10 mg/kg, iv, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) or 5-hydroxydecanoic acid sodium salt (5-HD, 5 mg/kg, iv, a mitochondrial K(ATP) channel blocker). The area at risk as a percentage of the left ventricle was determined by using Evans blue dye, and the infarct size was determined as a percentage of the area at risk by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Celiprolol 1 and 10 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) significantly reduced the infarct size in a dose-dependent manner (36.4+/-1.7%, n=7 and 25.4+/-2.9%, n=7, respectively) compared with the control (46.2+/-3.1%, n=8). The infarct size-reducing effect of celiprolol was completely blocked by L-NAME (40.4 +/-2.8%, n=8) but not by 5-HD (27.3+/-1.0%, n=8). Celiprolol 1 mg x kg(-1) x h (-1) increased the myocardial interstitial levels of NOx, an indicator of nitric oxide, and reduced the intensity of dihydro-ethidium staining of myocardium, an indicator of superoxide, during reperfusion after 30 min of ischemia.", 
    "164": "Celiprolol reduces myocardial infarct size and also increases nitric oxide production and reduces superoxide levels but not mitochondrial K(ATP) channels in rabbits.", 
    "165": "The characteristics and outcomes of patients discharged from hospitals with a diagnosis of heart failure (HF) have been described by a number of previous epidemiological studies. However, very little information is available on this issue in general practice in Japan.", 
    "166": "The Japanese Cardiac Registry of Heart Failure in General Practice (JCARE-GENERAL) is designed to study the characteristics, treatment and outcomes prospectively in a broad sample of outpatients with HF who were managed by cardiologists in hospital (Hospital-HF) and primary care physicians in general practice (GP-HF). Out of 2,685 patients with HF, 1,280 patients were Hospital-HF and 1,405 GP-HF. Compared to the Hospital-HF patients, GP-HF patients were more likely to be elderly and female, and they had a higher prevalence of hypertensive heart disease as a cause of HF. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers were more prescribed to Hospital-HF than GP-HF patients. At the follow-up of 1.2 year, after adjustment, the mortality was comparable between the Hospital-HF and GP-HF groups, whereas HF-related admission was higher in the Hospital-HF group than in in the GP-HF group.", 
    "167": "Based on the JCARE-GENERAL, the characteristics, treatment and outcomes of GP-HF patients differed from those of Hospital-HFpatients in Japan.", 
    "168": "A 79-year-old woman was out in the garden having lunch on a hot summer's day. She developed stabbing chest pains more severe on her left side, associated with radiation down her left arm. Severity was 7 out of 10. There was no relief of pain with glyceryl trinitrate spray. Risk factors for ischaemic heart disease include hyperlipidaemia, being an ex-smoker 40 years ago, no history of diabetes or hypertension. There was a family history of her father having a myocardial infarction at the age of 54. ECG revealed widespread deep symmetrical T-wave inversion in the chest leads and lateral limb leads.", 
    "169": "The patient's serum creatine kinase level was 180 IU/l (normaL range 30-135), troponin I level was 6.56 g/l (normal range 0-0.10), D-dimer was negative and random serum cholesterol level was 5.3 mmol/l (3.8-5.2). Significant coronary stenoses were excluded. A left ventriculogram revealed a hyperkinetic base and a dyskinetic apical region of the left ventricle. Echocardiography showed normal valves, basal septal hypertrophy and a dilated akinetic apex, with the region of akinesia spanning more than the arterial territory.",
