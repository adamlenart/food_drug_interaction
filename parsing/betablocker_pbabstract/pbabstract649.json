Relative synthesis rate was estimated in adult rabbit heart when both ventricles worked against zero pressure. The decreasing order was troponin complex, actinin complex, myosin, tropomyosin, and actin and was almost the same as that found in an in vivo study. The synthesis rates of myosin B in left and right ventricles were almost equal in hearts without left and right ventricular pressure load. In young rabbit heart with a right ventricular pressure load, an increase in the synthesis rate of right ventricular myosin B was observed along with the concomitant increase in that of left ventricle. As those increases were blocked by neither propranolol nor verapamil, it was suggested that these increases were not mediated by Ca2+ influx or beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "1": "The rhythmic contraction induced by glucose removal was not eliminated by tetrodotoxin, atropine, propranolol or indomethacin, but was abolished by Ca2+ removal from the solution or administration of verapamil and was increased by Ca2+-ionophore (A-23187). The rhythmicity was eliminated by ouabain (1.7 X 10(-6) - 1.7 X 10(-5) M), and was also abolished by removal of potassium from the solution but re-appeared after re-admission of potassium. The addition of calcium or sodium to preparations incubated in calcium or sodium and glucose-free solution in the presence of ouabain did not induce rhythmicity. Our findings suggest that the rhythmicity produced by glucose removal in the guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle is myogenic in origin and involves a depolarization-dependent calcium influx. The possibility that the rhythmicity may be related to alterations in Na-K ATPase activity was not ruled out.", 
    "2": "Rats born to mothers treated with propranolol, during days 8-22 of gestation, displayed hyperactivity in the open field which lasted up to 60 days of age and an impairment of avoidance in the shuttle box which was more marked in the male rats. Females exhibited hyperactivity in the open field but developed impaired avoidance learning only when exposed prenatally to both propranolol and hypoxia. Propranolol administration during the last term of pregnancy (days 18-22) affected mostly shuttle box performance. In contrast, hyperactivity could be induced by treatment during various stages of pregnancy, (days 8-22, 8-18, or 18-22) with the duration of hyperactivity being directly related to the length of treatment of the mothers. The possible mechanism of the disruptive effect of propranolol in the fetus and newborn is discussed.", 
    "3": "Newborn rats treated for the first weeks of life with guanidinoethane sulfonate (GES), a blocker of taurine transport producing taurine depletion, showed a severe disruption of photoreceptor structure. Photoreceptor damage consisted of a marked reduction of the size of the photoreceptor layer, deformation of the outer segments, and a profound disorganization of the disc membranes. The GES-induced degeneration pattern was very similar to that observed in cats fed a taurine-deficient diet. Injection of beta-alanine, another antagonist of taurine transport, also produced a disruption of photoreceptor structure. These results confirm the requirement of taurine for maintaining photoreceptor structure in different species.", 
    "4": "Available evidence in vitro and in vivo suggests that pharmacologic doses of isoproterenol stimulate the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin (CT) and propranolol inhibits secretion. However, the findings in man are either quite modest or inconsistent. In view of this controversy, we examined the effects of isoproterenol, 0.15 micrograms intradermally (i.d.), dopamine, 5 micrograms/kg body weight over 60 min intravenously (i.v.), and propranolol, 1 mg over 5 min followed by 60 micrograms per min for 2 i.v. in normal human subjects. It was found that these agents did not alter serum calcium, serum immunoreactive PTH, or plasma immunoreactive CT. The findings do not support a physiologic role for biogenic amines in the control and regulation of PTH or CT secretion in normal man.", 
    "5": "Publications dealing with the results of treating coronary heart disease patients with 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy-propoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone hydrochloride (carteolol hydrochloride, Endak, Endak mite) are reviewed. They amount to 7 publications dealing with a total of 137 patients. Heart rate, blood pressure, pressure-rate product, behaviour of the S-T depression under exercise, together with the subjective declarations of the number of angina pectoris attacks and the use of nitroglycerin were used to evaluate the effectivity. The therapeutically effective doses lay between 6 and 20 mg per day. Carteolol increased the tolerance of stress by 45%, in an ergometric investigation, as compared with a placebo. The reduction of the S-T depression, typical of an anti-anginal effect, was observed in all investigations with carteolol. Carteolol reduced the increase in the arterial blood pressure under stress and lowered the raised pressure-rate product. Carteolol significantly reduced the heart rate on exercise. Tachycardiac resting rates became normal, normal rates remained unchanged. A bradycardia of less than 50 beats/min was not observed in any of the patients. Only 9 of the 137 patients suffered from side-effects and the treatment had to be terminated in just 2 cases. Pathological alterations were not revealed by the clinical laboratory investigations during any of the studies.", 
    "6": "To assess the response of the relationship between systolic blood pressure and end-systolic volume to pharmacologic agents with known cardiac effects, we studied 21 patients with known coronary heart disease by means of gated radionuclide angiograms during the infusion of phenylephrine. Each individual was studied during the infusion of phenylephrine twice, once as a control and the second time after the administration of either intravenous dobutamine, topical nitroglycerin ointment, or intravenous propranolol. Eight individuals received 10 micrograms/kg/min of dobutamine, which reduced resting cardiac volumes (p less than 0.01), raised ejection fraction (p less than 0.01), and shifted the slope (1.38 +/- 0.50 to 2.03 +/- 0.69, p less than 0.01) and pressure intercept received 2 inches of nitroglycerin ointment. Nitroglycerin increased ejection fraction (p less than 0.05) and reduced volumes (p less than 0.05) but did not alter either the slope (1.46 +/- 0.68 to 1.49 +/- 0.61, p = NS) or intercept (10.6 +/- 5.4 to 10.1 +/- 6.4 mm Hg, p = NS) of the relationship. Eight patients received 15 mg of intravenous propranolol. Propranolol reduced resting ejection fraction (p less than 0.05), increased volumes (p less than 0.05), and reduced both the slope (1.67 +/- 0.58 to 1.51 +/- 0.53, p less than 0.05) and the intercept (13.8 +/- 2.5 to 7.5 +/- 2.3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) of the pressure-volume relationship. Thus the systolic blood pressure/end-systolic volume relationship can be assessed from radionuclide angiograms.", 
    "7": "The role of dopaminergic and adrenergic innervation of the intermediate lobe of amphibian pituitary in the release of alpha MSH has been studied in vitro. Neurointermediate lobes of frog (Rana ridibunda Pallas) have been perifused in amphibian culture medium (ACM) for 5-7 h. alpha MSH released in the effluent perifusate was measured by means of a sensitive and specific RIA. No significant morphological alteration of neurointermediate lobe cells was observed during the perifusion experiment, even at the electron microscopic level. The existence of dopaminergic receptors, responsible for an inhibition of frog melanotrophs, was shown using the dopaminergic agonists apomorphine (10(-6) M) and bromo-2-ergocryptine (10(-8) and 10(-7) M), which initiated a marked reduction of alpha MSH secretion. The effect of apomorphine was obliterated by the dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol. Haloperidol itself induced a dose-related stimulation, and the monoamine oxidase inhibitor nialamide (4 x 10(-3) M) inhibited alpha MSH secretion. In addition, haloperidol led to a complete reversal of the inhibitory effect of nialamide on alpha MSH secretion. These results demonstrate the existence, in the parenchyme of the intermediate lobe, of dopaminergic nerve fibers that are functionally active. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol was responsible for a dose-related stimulation of alpha MSH secretion; the stimulatory effect was reversed by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. TRH is a potent stimulator of alpha MSH secretion in amphibians. Since haloperidol and propranolol did not abolish the stimulation of alpha MSH release induced by TRH, it appeared that TRH action was not mediated via an inhibition of dopamine release or via a stimulation of adrenergic nerve fibers.", 
    "8": "A group of twelve comparable patients with primary open angle glaucoma were treated with Timolol 0.25 per cent drops to which was added pilocarpine 2 per cent, adrenaline 1 per cent or guanethidine 3 per cent plus adrenaline 0.5 per cent in a cross-over study. The initial intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction due to timolol was statistically significant. The mean additional IOP lowering due to pilocarpine 2 per cent was 1.37 mm Hg, that due to adrenaline 1 per cent was 1.79 mm Hg and that due to guanethidine 3 per cent plus adrenaline 0.5 per cent was 5.29 mm Hg.", 
    "9": "Eight out-patients with essential hypertension participated in a comparative, placebo-controlled study with a cross-over design. Pindolol and propranolol were administered orally in doses of 20.0 +/- 3.13 mg/d (mean +/- SEM) and 125.0 +/- 19.17 mg/d respectively. Pindolol reduced mean blood pressure by 11.9 mmHg; pre-ejection period index by 8.1 msec; total peripheral resistance by 3.1 mmHg min/L; and limb vascular resistance by 3.28 mmHg min 100 g/ml. Heart rate, cardiac output, plasma renin activity and urinary norepinephrine excretion rate were not altered by pindolol. Propranolol reduced mean blood pressure by 14.0 mmHg; heart rate by 9.1 beats/min; cardiac output by 0.57 L/min; limb blood flow by 1.06 ml/100 g.min; and plasma renin activity by 1.44 ng/ml/h; and increased pre-ejection period index by 8.7 msec. Total peripheral resistance, limb vascular resistance and urinary norepinephrine excretion rate were not altered by propranolol. It was concluded that: (1) the drugs, pindolol and propranolol, are equally effective as antihypertensive agents; (2) heart function and plasma renin activity are decreased by propranolol and unaltered by pindolol; (3) total peripheral resistance is decreased by pindolol and unaltered by propranolol; and (4) these findings may be explained by the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity exhibited by pindolol only.", 
    "10": "The efficacy and safety of long-term therapy depends on the dose regimen. The early recognition of individual pharmacokinetic defects is a professional task of the clinical pharmacologist. The application of test compounds has been used to differentiate between slow and fast metabolizers. Modern techniques for identifying and quantitating drug metabolites facilitate the determination of the individual metabolic state without resorting to compounds foreign to the particular therapy. This paper exemplifies this principle by examining the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, oxprenolol, hydralazine, maprotiline and diclofenac sodium. The systematic collection and analysis of representative samples of data is shown to be a prerequisite for the conclusive assessment and interpretation of the individual metabolic state.", 
    "11": "The aim of this study was to examine the interrelationships between age, plasma catecholamines, plasma renin activity (PRA) and blood pressure in essential hypertensive (EH) patients. PRA, plasma noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) were measured in 76 consecutive EH patients (WHO stages 1-2, aged 24-66 years) and in 28 normotensive subjects (aged 25-64 years) studied at rest in supine position after 5 days of normal fixed sodium and potassium intake. Both plasma NA and A were slightly but significantly higher in EH patients (p less than 0.05). While no relationship was found between the various parameters in normotensive subjects, in EH patients, particularly those at WHO stage 2, plasma NA was directly related to mean blood pressure (MBP) (p less than 0.001) and PRA (p less than 0.01). Plasma A was weakly related to MBP (p less than 0.05); PRA was inversely related to age (p less than 0.01) but no relationship was found between NA or A and age. Partial correlation analysis confirmed all these relationships. In fact, NA was related to MBP also considering constant PRA (p less than 0.001) or age (p less than 0.001), and NA was related to PRA also considering constant MBP (p less than 0.01) or age (p less than 0.001). Acute pharmacological alpha- and beta-blockade, with labetalol 100 mg i.v., induced a reduction of MBP which was directly related to basal plasma NA (p less than 0.001). These results support the view that in EH the sympathetic nervous system might be in part responsible for PRA levels and for the severity of hypertension.", 
    "12": "Twenty-five patients with essential hypertension were randomly assigned to treatment with either captopril or atenolol. There were 15 males and 10 females and their mean age was 53 years, range 32-66 years. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced by atenolol 50-100 mg once daily. Captopril 25-50 mg 3 times daily caused a significant decrease in supine diastolic but not in systolic blood pressure. After the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (25-50 mg) to those who did not become normotensive (supine diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg) on captopril or atenolol alone, blood pressure was further reduced. Captopril combined with hydrochlorothiazide significantly reduced both supine and standing blood pressure by 31/17 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and 33/18 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) respectively. Atenolol combined with hydrochlorothiazide caused a significant decrease of both recumbent and standing blood pressure by 21/10 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and 23/13 mm Hg (p less than 0.05 systolic, p less than 0.001 diastolic). The reduction of systolic blood pressure was significantly better with the captopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination, while there was no difference between the groups as regards diastolic blood pressure reduction. Thus, hydrochlorothiazide potentiates the blood pressure lowering effect of captopril more than of atenolol. This could be due to a synergistic interaction between captopril and hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "13": "A multi-centre, single-blind trial was carried out in general practice to compare the therapeutic efficacy, tolerance and compliance of penbutolol and long-acting propranolol, both given once daily, in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Two hundred and twenty-two patients (111 patients in each treatment group) completed the 8-week treatment period. On completion, diastolic blood pressure was under control in 60% of patients receiving penbutolol and in 55% of patients receiving long-acting propranolol. Tolerance of the trial medications was good. At the final assessment, 88.3% of patients receiving penbutolol and 93.7% of patients receiving long-acting propranolol indicated no problems on direct questioning. Side-effects, as elicited from a 24-item symptoms list, were similar for both treatments and were generally minimal. Compliance was good in both treatment groups.", 
    "14": "In a double-blind study, patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension were treated randomly with either indoramin or propranolol orally. The dose of both drugs was increased as necessary, to a predetermined level, in order to reduce the diastolic (Phase V) blood pressure to 100 mmHg or less. Patients were followed up for 12 weeks. There were 23 patients on propranolol and 27 on indoramin. The blood pressure in 22 patients on propranolol and 25 patients on indoramin was satisfactorily controlled in both the supine and standing positions. Mean supine blood pressure decreased from 181.3 +/- 14.2/116.2 +/- 6.8 mmHg to 140.6 +/- 7.1/95.7 +/- 3.6 mmHg after 12 weeks of treatment in patients receiving propranolol and from 188.3 +/- 18.9/118.4 +/- 8.7 mmHg to 144.7 +/- 7.3/95.7 +/- 2.5 mmHg in those treated with indoramin. There were no significant differences between the effects on supine and standing blood pressures and blood pressure control was maintained throughout the 12-week period in patients receiving indoramin and those receiving propranolol. Propranolol reduced the mean heart rate by approximately 16 beats/min in both the supine and standing positions. The maximum effect was seen 4 weeks after starting treatment and was maintained throughout the study. Sinus bradycardia (heart rate less than 60/min) occurred in 9 (39%) patients receiving propranolol. Indoramin caused a small but significant reduction in mean heart rate of approximately 4 beats/min in both the supine and standing positions. The maximum effect was seen after 2 weeks of treatment and was maintained for the rest of the duration of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "15": "We investigated the effect of captopril on plasma norepinephrine concentration and blood pressure in two groups of hypertensive patients. One group consisted of five severely hypertensive patients rendered hypernoradrenergic by administration of a minoxidil-propranolol-diuretic regimen. The other group was ten untreated mildly hypertensive patients. Two hours after 12.5mg of captopril, blood pressure was lowered (p less than .05) in four of the five hypernoradrenergic patients from 180 +/- 8/102 +/- 8 to 132 +/- 7/77 +/- 8 mmHg. Chronic administration of 100-150mg of captopril tid caused no further blood pressure reduction. Precaptopril plasma norepinephrine concentration was 925 +/- 206 and two hours after the 12.5mg dose was 807 +/- 80 pg/ml. Three months later having advanced the dose to 300-450 mg/day it was lower (p less than .05) at 752 pg/ml. The acute blood pressure response correlated (r = -0.72, p less than .001) with the precaptopril plasma norepinephrine. Precaptopril blood pressure in the mild hypertensive patients was 146 +/- 4/98 +/- 1, after a 25-100mg dose it was 137 +/- 6/91 +/- 2 (diastolic p less than .05) and at two months with the same captopril dose bid it was 141 +/- 8/88 +/- 4 mmHg (diastolic p less than .01). Corresponding initial PNE was 425 +/- 72, two hours after captopril 405 +/- 47 and 310 +/- 63 pg/ml (p less than .05) with chronic administration. Thus, captopril lowers blood pressure in both hypernoradrenergic and eunoradrenergic hypertensive patients without increasing plasma norepinephrine suggesting some unique dampening effect of this drug on the sympathetic nervous system. Also, addition of captopril to triple therapy lowered blood pressure in proportion to plasma norepinephrine levels suggesting importance to its action on this sympathetic nervous system effector.", 
    "16": "In 27 hypertensive patients whose blood pressure could not be adequately controlled with 200 mg metoprolol Durules alone, the effect of a double dose of metoprolol Durules (400 mg once daily) was compared with a fixed combination of 200 mg metoprolol and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (Selokomb). The study followed a double-blind cross-over schedule in 2 parallel groups. The reduction in diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.01) was comparable in the two groups. A significant fall (p less than 0.01) in systolic blood pressure occurred with the metoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide combination. The subsequent change from the double dose of metoprolol Durules to the combination therapy also resulted in a fall in systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05). Mean serum potassium and blood glucose levels did not change after each alteration in therapy. Most of the side-effects mentioned were mild and transient in character.", 
    "17": "In a cross-over study of 52 middle-aged patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, we have compared the effect and tolerability of 100 mg atenolol and 100 mg metoprolol given once daily. After 1 1/2 and 3 months of treatment, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure 24 hours after drug intake were significantly lower on atenolol. There were no significant differences after 3 months when blood pressure was read 3-4 hours after dose intake. During exercise, systolic blood pressure and heart rate were--at all work-loads--significantly lower on atenolol. Four patients on metoprolol and one patient on atenolol discontinued treatment owing to side-effects. The results support the need for thorough analysis of the duration of action and influence of physical activity and sympathetic tone in comparisons between presumedly equivalent antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "18": "Previous work indicates that one consequence of the accumulation of several xenobiotics in the lung is compromised pulmonary disposition of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). In the present studies, we examined whether pulmonary accumulation of chlorpromazine (CPZ), propranolol (P), imipramine (IMP), and clomipramine (Cl-IMP) affected 5-HT disposition in rabbit lungs. Pulmonary extraction and metabolism of [14C]-5-HT during single pulmonary passage were examined using the reference indicator radioisotope dilution technique in male New Zealand albino rabbits. After control experiment, animals received CPZ or P (2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg), IMP or Cl-IMP (0.25, 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg) via the jugular vein. Pulmonary clearance was 83% of administered 5-HT. A significant proportion (28%) of total radioactivity in the bloodstream after single passage was recovered as 5-HIAA in control experiments. These values were reduced significantly to 70 and 20%, respectively upon prior administration of IMP (0.25 mg/kg). Cl-IMP was more effective in reducing these values further. CPZ and P were marginally effective at the highest dose. While prior administration of IMP and Cl-IMP resulted in pulmonary accumulation of both drugs, the latter accumulated to a significantly greater extent. These results suggest that Cl-IMP has higher affinity to the rabbit lung than IMP and may inhibit pulmonary uptake of 5-HT by competition for uptake and binding sites more than IMP.", 
    "19": "To test the hypothesis that the depression of cardiac performance induced by competitive blockade of sympathetic stimulation at beta-adrenoceptors could be attenuated by the addition of a high level of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or concomitant alpha- and beta-blockade, the haemodynamic dose-response effects of propranolol (non-cardioselective, no ISA), pindolol (non-cardioselective, high ISA) and labetalol (non-cardioselective, alpha-blocker) were compared in a randomized study of 30 patients with stable coronary artery disease. Following 4 intravenous (i.v.) doses of each drug given according to a logarithmic cumulative dosage schedule, changes in circulatory variables were measured 2-4 min following each i.v. bolus and during bicycle exercise following the maximum dose of each drug. At rest propranolol induced dose-related reductions in heart rate, cardiac output and increases in pulmonary artery occluded pressure and systemic vascular resistance. The only change in resting haemodynamic variables following pindolol was a small dose-related increase in pulmonary artery occluded pressure. Labetalol induced dose-related falls in systemic blood pressure and vascular resistance with linear increase in cardiac output and pulmonary artery occluded pressure. During exercise the depression of cardiac output and increase in pulmonary artery occluded pressure which occurred in patients randomized to propranolol was effectively attenuated in the pindolol and labetalol groups. These observations on cardiac performance following beta-blockade in ischaemic heart disease suggest a rational basis for the use of compounds with added vasodilator or intrinsic sympathomimetic properties.", 
    "20": "The purpose of the study was to compare the effects of oxprenolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, to propranolol, a beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, on myocardial performance and myocardial O2 consumption (MVO2). Myocardial performance was reflected by the systolic time intervals (STI) and MVO2 by the triple product of heart rate X left ventricular ejection time X systolic blood pressure (HR X LVET X SBP). The trial, a double-blind cross-over study, included 32 hypertensive patients, 17 males and 15 females, with a mean age of 50.9 years. The patients were divided into two groups: group A - 16 patients who were treated with effective antihypertensive doses of oxprenolol and diuretics (Esidrex K) for the first 8 weeks (period I) and with similar doses of propranolol and diuretics for the following 8 weeks (period II); Group B - the same number of patients who received the same drugs in the reverse order. All patients were examined during both periods at 2- and 3-week intervals, blood pressure and heart rate were recorded, and patients were provided with the appropriate study medication. At the end of periods I and II, myocardial function was assessed on the basis of STI, and MVO2 was evaluated on the basis of the triple product of HR X LVET X SBP. Four measurements of STI and MVO2 were carried out for each patient at the end of periods I and II: prior to intake of medication and 1 1/2, 3 and 4 1/2 h after intake of medication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "The authors studied the pressure-reducing action of a new beta-blocking agent (carteolol) in a group of subjects affected with open angle glaucoma. The drug was efficacious in all cases treated and did not show any noteworthy side effects.", 
    "22": "The effects of a single oral dose and of an 8 week treatment with labetalol--an alpha 1- and beta 1-2-adrenoceptor blocking agent--and with atenolol--a beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking agent--were compared in 52 hypertensives. A single oral dose of atenolol induced a marked bradycardia without decrease in blood pressure. On the contrary labetalol lowered blood pressure but not resting heart rate. After an 8 week treatment both drugs exhibited a similar antihypertensive effect. However labetalol did not decrease heart rate and plasma renin activity as markedly as atenolol did. It was concluded that the alpha 1 blocking properties of labetalol were of importance in the development of the antihypertensive properties that this drug exhibits after a single or multiple administrations.", 
    "23": "Fifteen out-patients with moderate hypertension were randomly and sequentially treated with atenolol, indapamide and a combination of the two drugs after a wash-out period of at least 1 week and a 2-week placebo run-in period. The duration of treatment was 4 weeks in each case. The dosage was 2.5 mg indapamide and 100 mg atenolol, in single tablets which were taken at 11.00 hours. All the treatment regimens produced a highly significant (p less than 0.001) reduction in systolic and diastolic, supine and standing blood pressure; these reductions were not significantly different for the single drugs but were significantly greater for the combined therapy. The number of patients reaching the end-point of a diastolic blood pressure of 95 mmHg or less was the same with either atenolol or indapamide, i.e. 7 (46.6%), but was greater with the combined therapy, i.e. 10 (66.6%). A significant (p less than 0.001) reduction in pulse rate was observed with the treatments involving atenolol. Acceptability of the treatments was very good; the number of volunteered and elicited complaints during the different treatments being less compared to the placebo period, particularly for the combined treatment. No significant difference was observed in the blood biochemistry tests. The results are discussed in light of the mechanisms of action of the two drugs, which seem well integrated with each other, and the duration of the antihypertensive effect, which allows a single administration with consequent good treatment compliance.", 
    "24": "Left ventricular function was examined by echocardiography and systolic time intervals in nine healthy male volunteers, who ingested ethanol 0.35 g/kg 4 hr after a 50-mg peroral dose of calcium cyanamide, an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor. Accumulation of acetaldehyde in blood was accompanied by marked increases in heart rate (53%) and cardiac output (78%) as well as by decreases in diastolic arterial blood pressure (19%) and peripheral vascular resistance (46%). Ejection fraction and maximum circumferential fibre shortening velocity increased by 25 and 47%, respectively; the preejection period/ejection time ratio decreased by 31%. 4-Methylpyrazole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, efficiently reduced blood acetaldehyde levels when injected intravenously (7 mg/kg) at the height of the reaction. It was as effective as intravenous propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) in attenuating the hyperdynamic circulation and stabilized arterial blood pressure better than propranolol. We conclude that even a very mild alcohol intoxication (30-50 mg/100 ml) causes a marked enhancement of cardiac function, in addition to vasodilation, in subjects with impaired acetaldehyde oxidation. These changes are reversed by preventing acetaldehyde formation through alcohol dehydrogenase inhibition.", 
    "25": "An open study was carried out to assess the efficacy of indoramin used as second step therapy in 30 patients with moderate to severe hypertension who had failed to respond adequately to monotherapy with a thiazide or beta-blocker. After a 1-week washout period, patients started treatment with 25 mg indoramin twice daily plus hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg twice daily) or propranolol (40 mg once daily). Indoramin dosage was subsequently adjusted in 25 mg steps (to maximum 150 mg daily), if necessary, at follow-up control visits every 14 days. Analysis of the results from the 22 patients who completed the 75-day study period showed that there were progressive, statistically significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (supine and erect) to clinically acceptable levels. Heart rate also decreased significantly and this was more evident in the 7 patients treated with the combination of indoramin, thiazide plus beta-blocker. No patient had orthostatic hypotension and few side-effects were reported, although 7 patients withdrew for this reason.", 
    "26": "The antihypertensive effect of indapamide (2.5 mg/day) was evaluated in 2184 patients with essential hypertension by 300 French general practitioners over a period of treatment of 3 months. Indapamide produced a significant reduction in blood pressure, the amplitude of which was directly related to pre-treatment blood pressure levels; normalization of blood pressure was achieved in approximately 66% of patients. Addition of a beta-blocker to the treatment regimen on the second month was required in only 10% of patients. No severe side-effect was reported, although a significant reduction in kalaemia was noted in less than 5% of patients.", 
    "27": "The efficacy of a propranolol-hydralazine combination tablet was compared with that of each of its two components in the twice-daily treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure: 100 to 125 mmHg). After a three-week, single-blind, placebo period, a 9- to 18-week, single-blind, dose-finding phase with the combination was performed. The daily doses of propranolol/hydralazine were 40 mg/25 mg, 80 mg/25 mg, 80 mg/50 mg, 120 mg/50 mg, 160 mg/50 mg, and 160 mg/100 mg. Of 83 patients, 73 (88%) had decreases in diastolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 10 mmHg. Thirty-eight (46%) patients had a diastolic blood pressure equal to or less than 90 mmHg while taking 80 mg propranolol/50 mg hydralazine or less given BID. Mean systolic and diastolic pressures were reduced by 16.8 mmHg (10.9%) and 17.6 mmHg (16.7%), respectively (P less than 0.001). A ten-week, double-blind, parallel-treatment phase followed in which patients were randomly assigned to the combination tablet or to propranolol or hydralazine. There were significantly larger increases in mean systolic (P less than 0.01) and mean diastolic (P less than 0.03) blood pressure when the components were taken alone than with the combination from the mean of the last three weekly dose-finding visits to the mean of the last four biweekly parallel-treatment visits. The changes in systolic/diastolic blood pressures were: hydralazine (n = 30), 14.43/8.62 mmHg; propranolol (n = 24), 9.87/6.09 mmHg; and the combination (n = 27), 1.47/1.53 mmHg. During the parallel-treatment phase, the proportions of patients with new complaints were: hydralazine, 16/31 (52%); propranolol, 10/25 (40%); and the combination, 11/27 (41%). In the hydralazine group, three patients had cardiovascular events (severe tachycardia, mild palpitations, and skipped heart beats) and two patients had mild anxiety; no such occurrences were noted in the propranolol or combination group. The mean change (increase) in heart rate from the end of dose-finding to the end of the double-blind period was significantly larger for patients taking hydralazine than for patients taking propranolol or the combination. Mean changes for these groups were: hydralazine, 12.4 beats/min; propranolol, 2.9 beats/min; and the combination, 1.8 beats/min (P = 0.0001). This study found the combination of propranolol plus hydralazine to be safe and more effective than either component.", 
    "28": "Fifty-three hypertensive patients from one practice, of whom forty-two were new patients, were treated with Prestim--a fixed dose combination of 10 mg timolol maleate and 2.5 mg bendrofluazide. After a 2-week placebo run-in period, dose titration took place at weekly intervals up to a maximum of 4 tablets daily. Stabilized patients were followed-up at 3 months and approximately 1 year. At the 3-month follow-up, forty-nine patients were evaluated. Forty-two patients (85%) were well controlled (diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg) on Prestim at a mean daily dose of 1.4 tablets. Four patients stopped therapy due to side-effects and in three patients the blood pressure was uncontrolled on the maximum dose of 4 tablets daily. After 1 year, thirty-four patients (75%) were still well controlled on a mean dose of 1.3 tablets daily. A further two patients were lost to follow-up and six other patients stopped therapy during the last nine months of the study. There were no unexpected side-effects and the general biochemical profile remained unaltered.", 
    "29": "Serial blood samples were obtained throughout pregnancy from 11 women with essential hypertension (EHT). Seven were treated with labetalol (Trandate) and 4 with alpha -methyl dopa (Aldomet). Nine patients were well-controlled throughout pregnancy. Their mean plasma renin concentrations (PRC) followed the profile determined in 18 normal patients studied serially. They remained in the upper normal range until the last month, when both treatment groups showed a fall in PRC. Mean plasma aldosterone (ALD) also followed a normal profile until late gestation when it too showed a sharp fall. Of the two patients who developed superimposed PIH, one, who received labetalol, developed severe hypertension at 35 weeks, requiring delivery. Although PRC increased early in this pregnancy, ALD did not, remaining low throughout. Serum potassium [K+] measurements were also very low in this patient. The second patient only became hypertensive at 40 weeks and had PRC and ALD profiles resembling those in the successfully treated EHTs. There was a strong positive correlation throughout between serum potassium and ALD measurements (p less than 0.001) but none between PRC and ALD. This latter agrees with the known lack of correlation between PRC and ALD in normal pregnancy and may suggest that changes in electrolyte balance are more important stimuli to ALD secretion during pregnancy.", 
    "30": "The beta 1-selective blocker metoprolol was compared to propranolol and a placebo in a double-blind crossover trial in 24 patients with essential tremor. Both beta blockers suppressed the essential tremor, but metoprolol, which caused a mean reduction of 32.0% in tremor intensity from the base-line value, was less effective than propranolol, which reduced mean tremor intensity by 41.3%. Subjective benefit for their tremor was found by 15 of the patients taking propranolol and by one taking metoprolol. The tremor frequency was not affected. No serious side effects were observed. Metoprolol may offer an alternative for those essential tremor patients who cannot tolerate propranolol.", 
    "31": "Experiments with isolated perfused hearts of guinea pigs and rats showed that cardiac action is linked to formation of prostaglandinlike substances (PLS) and prostacyclin (PGI2). Perfusion of the hearts with arachidonic acid or pretreatment with a linoleic-acid-supplemented diet significantly increased the content of PLS and PGI2 and exerted an economic effect on the heart performance. Dipyridamole induced a marked increase in the coronary flow and PGI2 formation of the hearts but decreased the enhanced myocardial PGI2 biosynthesis after perfusion with arachidonic acid. Propranolol also caused a rise in PGI2 efflux but did not show any influence on PGI2 formation after arachidonic acid. Dipyridamole and propranolol prevent decreased PGI2 formation after acetylsalicylic acid, supporting the view that a combination of these drugs exerts a preventive effect in patients with angina pectoris and heart infarction.", 
    "32": "In a multicenter randomized double-blind trial, we compared the antihypertensive effects of 12 weeks of therapy using timolol maleate, a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent, alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, and hydrochlorothiazide alone in 70 outpatients with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension (61 of whom completed the study). All three groups showed significant blood pressure reductions in both supine and standing positions which were most marked in the timolol-hydrochlorothiazide group (154/103 leads to 129/85 mm Hg). A good or excellent therapeutic response was obtained in 20 of 21 patients in the timolol-hydrochlorothiazide group. In 16 of 20 patients receiving timolol alone, and in 10 of 20 receiving hydrochlorothiazide alone. Adverse reactions were minimal in all treatment groups but highest in the hydrochlorothiazide group. It was concluded that timolol-hydrochlorothiazide combination is more effective than either drug alone for management of hypertension and that timolol alone or with hydrochlorothiazide is well tolerated.", 
    "33": "Publications dealing with investigations made with 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy-propoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone hydrochloride (carteolol hydrochloride, Endak, Endak mite) on patients with essential hypertension, are briefly reviewed. Four controlled studies are considered in greater depth. A comparative study with pindolol indicates that the beta-receptor blocker carteolol led to a significant reduction of the elevated blood pressure of patients with essential hypertension, as did pindolol. The antihypertensive effect of carteolol, however, was seen in a significantly higher number of patients than that of pindolol (p less than 0.05). A further controlled clinical study of carteolol, this time in comparison with diuretics, also demonstrated its satisfactory antihypertensive effect. It was found that carteolol displayed a significantly greater (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.001) effectivity in reducing the blood pressure than did previously prescribed diuretics. In another test the antihypertensive effect was established by comparison with a placebo (p less than 0.001). Moreover, a study has been made of the effect of carteolol on the renin-aldosterone system. The results established that the hypotensive effect of carteolol is not associated with an inhibition of the renin-aldosterone system.", 
    "34": "This trial comprised 40 patients with angina pectoris and reproducible ischaemic ST segment depression in the exercise ECG. Whenever possible the diagnosis of coronary heart disease was confirmed by coronary angiography. After a preliminary 7-day placebo period, 20 of these patients were treated for 4 weeks with 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy-propoxy)-3, 4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone hydrochloride (carteolol hydrochloride, Endak, Endak mite), a nonselective beta-receptor blocker, having adrenergic properties (ISA) up to 30 times more powerful than those of propranolol. The trial was double-blind and randomized; standard medication (pindolol) was given to the controls. In general, the results obtained with carteolol--and also with pindolol--may be regarded as \"good\" or \"very good\". The average weekly incidence of anginal attacks fell from 6 to 4 (p less than 0.05). Carteolol produced a definite decrease in ST segment depression during exercise, at the end of exercise and in the recovery phase (p less than 0.05). The same was true for the patients treated with pindolol. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups. Pulse rate and systolic blood pressure--measured before exercise and at the end of the recovery phase--did not change; however, readings made at the end of exercise showed a significant decrease (p less than 0.05). Diastolic pressure remained essentially unaltered. There were no changes in the chest radiograph or resting ECG. Laboratory results remained unchanged in both groups. In one patient of each group treatment needed to be discontinued because of dyspnoea, mainly during exercise. This reaction could probably be related to the beta-blocker therapy. The overall response to treatment, as assessed by the physician conducting the trial, was \"good\" or \"very good\" in 75% of the patients receiving carteolol and in 70% of those receiving pindolol. 70% of the patients who had received carteolol assessed the therapeutic result as \"good\" or \"very good\"; in the pindolol group 55% made the same judgment.", 
    "35": "The realization that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality increases in patients with mild elevation of either systolic or diastolic blood pressure has led to a consideration to treat millions of patients with mild diastolic or isolated systolic hypertension. The cost of administering a successful antihypertensive treatment program and the potential adverse effects of pharmacologic agents is of great concern. It has been emphasized that the risk of premature mortality differs in individual patients according to the number of associated cardiovascular risk factors at any level of blood pressure. This has led to a suggestion that only high risk patients be treated. However, a significant number of low risk patients with mild hypertension develop a more severe or complicated form of their disease even over a follow-up period of five to ten years. There is no good way to identify these patients. Trials of antihypertensive therapy suggest a beneficial effect of blood pressure lowering in mild hypertension. No trials of antihypertensive therapy in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension have been reported, but the elevation in systolic blood pressure appears to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Even the choice of the first step agent in treatment is debatable. Diuretics or beta blockers effectively lower blood pressure in the majority of hypertensive patients, particularly if modest dietary sodium restriction is achieved. The incidence of side effects, either symptomatic or biochemical, is similar but diuretics are unquestionably cheaper and probably more effective. Successful application of an antihypertensive treatment program may continue to reduce our unacceptably great incidence of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "36": "Among 1,036 patients treated for migraine headache between 1973 and 1980, 865 were given a daily maximum dose of 320 mg of propranolol, while 171 served as differently treated controls. At least one year of treatment was prescribed, at the end of which time 84% of the propranolol group reported sustained improvement compared with similar improvement in only 32% of controls (p less than 0.01). The success rate progressively increased during the entire year.", 
    "37": "Two beta-blocking agents, non-selective propranolol and beta 1-selective metoprolol, were investigated with respect to their effect on glucose metabolism in 11 hypertensive, non-diabetic patients. They were randomly treated for two weeks in a double-blind cross-over manner with propranolol, metoprolol and placebo. Both drugs caused a small but significant increase in basal blood glucose values as compared with placebo (p less than 0.01). Metoprolol increased the blood glucose concentrations during the first 10 min of an i.v. glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) as compared with placebo (p less than 0.02) and propranolol (p less than 0.05). Propranolol raised only the blood glucose values during the later part of the IVGTT (p less than 0.01). The increase in blood glucose concentrations was, however, not associated with significant changes in peripheral insulin levels. The mean basal glucagon concentrations were lower during propranolol and metoprolol than during placebo (p less than 0.01). Propranolol also induced a more pronounced reduction of plasma glucagon than placebo (p less than 0.05) at 10 min of the IVGTT. The mean basal free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations were lower during propranolol (p less than 0.001) and metoprolol (p less than 0.05) than during placebo. Both drugs decreased the plasma levels of FFA during the first 10 min of the IVGTT as compared with placebo (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.02, respectively). Pharmacological doses of propranolol and metoprolol increased blood glucose concentrations, decreased plasma glucagon and FFA concentrations, but had no effect on serum insulin levels in hypertensive, non-diabetic subjects.", 
    "38": "Thirteen patients with mild essential hypertension, mean age 44 years (range 21-59), were studied during \"stress\" before and after postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and combined postsynaptic alpha- and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Loud broad band noise (100 dBA for 10 min) was used as the stress stimulus. Exposure to noise caused a significant increase in systolic (7%, p less than 0.05), diastolic (9%, p less than 0.01) and mean arterial pressure (6%, p less than 0.01). The blood pressure elevation was caused by an increase in total peripheral resistance (12%, p less than 0.05). There was no significant change in heart rate, stroke volume or cardiac output. The blood pressure response during noise stimulation was not affected by postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor blockade (prazosin, 2 mg orally). The hemodynamic reaction pattern, however, was totally reversed. Thus, the cardiac output increased significantly (9%, p less than 0.05), while the total peripheral resistance tended to decrease. Combined postsynaptic alpha- and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade (labetalol, 200 mg orally) inhibited the increase in systolic blood pressure caused by noise, while the diastolic and mean arterial pressures still increased significantly (5%, p less than 0.01). Labetalol effectively blocked the stress-induced increase in total peripheral resistance and there was no significant increase in cardiac output after combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Exposure to noise caused a significant increase in circulating noradrenaline (20%, p less than 0.05). Plasma adrenaline and plasma renin activity were not affected by noise stimulation. These results suggest that blood pressure elevation is essential during \"stress\" but that the hemodynamic pattern causing blood pressure elevation may vary and may be affected by pharmacological blockade of various parts of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "39": "Oxprenolol (OX) is a nonselective, beta-adrenergic blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. We studied 178 patients in five centers to determine whether a polymer-matrix-based, slow-release preparation of oxprenolol (SR-OX) given once daily was as effective as the standard preparation given twice daily for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After a placebo washout phase, patients were treated with OX until blood pressure was controlled. They were then randomized in a double-blind fashion to continue the same dose, given as either OX bid or SR-OX qd with a placebo as the second dose. All patients took hydrochlorothiazide 50-100 mg/d throughout the study. Blood pressure was reduced 23/15 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and pulse 8 beats/min in the SR-OX group (n = 67) and 24/17 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and 8 beats/min in the OX group (n = 72) by titrating standard OX. After randomization to SR-OX or OX, there were no further changes over six weeks. Home-determined blood pressures showed no loss of control in the evening. There were no unexpected adverse effects. We conclude that SR-OX given once daily is as effective as OX given twice daily for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "40": "We investigated the effect of intrarenal administration of dopamine on renin release in conscious dogs. Dopamine in doses ranging from 0.28 to 3.0 micrograms . kg(-1) . min(-1) produced a significant increase in systemic plasma renin activity (PRA) and renin secretion rate without altering systemic blood pressure. Dopamine also induced renal vasodilatation and natriuresis within this dose range. To determine if the dopamine-induced renin release is related to its vasodilatory action, two other vasodilators, papaverine and acetylcholine, were infused into the renal artery, but neither, in doses that produced a rise in renal blood flow similar to that of dopamine, had any effect on PRA. As dopamine can activate alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in addition to dopaminergic receptors, experiments were also performed to characterize the type of receptors involved in dopamine-induced renin release. Intrarenal infusion of sulpiride and haloperidol, dopamine antagonists, significantly inhibited dopamine-induced renin release and renal vasodilatation. In contrast, intrarenal infusion of propranolol failed to alter dopamine-induced rise in PRA or renal blood flow. Simultaneous infusion of phentolamine and dopamine, on the other hand, produced a significant potentiation of dopamine-induced renin release and renal vasodilatation. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that dopamine is capable of inducing renin release and renal vasodilatation in conscious dogs. Moreover, such actions of dopamine are mediated through activation of specific dopamine receptors in the kidney. Finally, we present evidence for the existence of the intrarenal alpha-adrenergic mechanism that is inhibitory to renin release.", 
    "41": "Systolic time intervals (STI) were recorded at rest and during isometric exercise (IHG) in 20 hypertensive outpatients, WHO Stage 1 or 2. In a double-blind crossover study, slow-release metoprolol 200 mg once daily and matched placebo were given for 4 weeks each, at the end of a 2-week placebo washout. Blood pressure and STI were taken in the last day of washout and of either crossover period. Treatment decreased blood pressure and heart rate values at rest and on peak IHG; it didn't modify preejection period index (PEPI), left ventricular ejection time index (LVETI), and their ratio at rest, but decreased the ratio between diastolic blood pressure and PEPI (DBP/PEPI ratio) at rest and on peak IHG and lengthened the PEPI at peak IHG. Resting PEPI values on placebo treatment showed a negative correlation with systolic (r = -0.72) as well as diastolic (r = -0.80) pressure reduction on slow-release metoprolol as compared with placebo treatment. The PEP/LVET ratio at rest on placebo treatment showed a negative correlation with systolic (r = -0.78) as well as diastolic (r = -0.82) pressure reduction at rest on metoprolol compared with placebo treatment. Patients with a resting PEP/LVET ratio less than 0.43 showed a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure approximating or exceeding 20 mm Hg, whereas patients with a PEP/LVET ratio greater than 0.47 showed a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of less than 10 mm Hg. In patients with a PEP/LVET ratio of 0.43 to 0.47 (50% of the trial population), STI didn't show any correlation with the pressure response to beta-blockade. A positive correlation was found between the DBP/PEPI ratio at rest on placebo treatment and systolic (r = 0.56) as well as diastolic (r = 0.76) pressure reduction at rest on slow-release metoprolol compared with placebo treatment. Thus, STI appeared as promising predictors of the magnitude of blood pressure response to sustained beta-blocking therapy in mild-to-moderate essential hypertension, mostly in patients with a resting PEP/LVET ratio less then 0.43 or greater then 0.47.", 
    "42": "Adenylate cyclase activity of rabbit bone marrow erythroblasts decreased continuously as the cells developed. The proerythroblasts were the richest cells in cAMP. No changes in cAMP levels were observed after the final cell division. cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity declined rapidly during the early period of erythroid cell development and remained constant but extremely low after condensation of the nucleus. Both cytosolic cAMP-binding capacity and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity decreased in dividing erythroblasts when calculated in terms of cell number but remained constant per cell volume. Membrane-associated protein kinase was found to be cAMP-dependent only in the dividing cells. The adenylate cyclase activity of both early and late erythroblasts was stimulated by GTP and p (NH)ppG, whereas the stimulating effect of the beta-adrenergic drug L-isoprenaline was limited to the immature dividing cells. The lack of response of non-dividing erythroblasts to beta-adrenergic stimuli is not due to loss of beta-receptors, since both dividing and non-dividing cells bind 125I-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol with equal affinities. The number of beta-adrenergic receptors per cell was 2-fold higher in the dividing cells. No significant change in binding affinity for GTP and p (NH) ppG during erythroblast development was observed.", 
    "43": "The influence of different doses of bradykinin (0.1 micrograms, 1.0 micrograms/0.1 ml) and dopamine (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 micrograms/0.1 ml) on the flow through vessels of the isolated hindpaw of rat was estimated. Dopamine in small doses did not change and in the highest doses decreased the vascular flow. Bradykinin decreased the vascular flow and the effect was dose-dependent. This peptide administered together with dopamine in the smallest dose, evoked the same effect as dopamine itself in the highest dose and decreased the effect of dopamine introduced into the organism in the highest dose. Administration of phentolamine and propranolol decreased the vascular flow. The vasodilating effect of dopamine was seen after administration of drugs blocking the adrenergic receptors and the vaso-constricting effect of dopamine administered in the highest dose was not observed. Bradykinin decreased the vascular flow and when administered together with dopamine evoked effect similar to that after administration of the peptide with phentolamine and propranolol. The authors suppose that except the modifying influence of bradykinin on the action of dopamine, the role of the peptide receptor in this action cannot be excluded.", 
    "44": "10 normal volunteers (5 females, 5 males, 18-30 years) were treated for 4 days with the beta-blocker sotalol, 320 or 960 mg/day, 5 persons each in random order. A placebo was applied 5 days before and 2 days afterwards. Changes in blood pressure and pulse were not pronounced. EEG data from vigilance-controlled EEGs, evaluated in a spectral parameter analysis, showed a significant decrease of the absolute and relative alpha-power and the dominant alpha-amplitude and so far indicate a central nervous system action of sotalol.", 
    "45": "The amount of ouabain bound to an enriched fraction of heart or kidney medulla is reduced by propranolol. The inhibitory effect is greater under conditions in which complex II formation is promoted. Similar concentrations of propranolol are able to produce a reduction in Na+, K+-ATPase activity, by reduction of the number of active sites without changes in ionic affinity. The lack of stereospecificity and the high concentrations (greater than 10(-4)M) required indicate that this effect is independent of beta adrenergic blockade. Effectiveness reduction of cardiac glycosides in the presence of propranolol could be due to inhibition of drug interaction with its receptor.", 
    "46": "Dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment of WT or cyc- lymphoma membranes resulted in the simultaneous loss of epinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and beta-adrenergic antagonist binding. The treatment produced no significant decrease in NaF-stimulated activity and only a partial loss of the PGE1 stimulation. Epinephrine partially protected against the loss of epinephrine-stimulated cyclase activity. The decrease in beta-adrenergic stimulation of adenylate cyclase was characterized by over a 100-fold increase in Kact for epinephrine stimulation of adenylate cyclase (10 mM DTT for 30 min) with no effect on the Vmax. We have previously shown that two polypeptides (Mr = 55,000 and 65,000 daltons) are specifically labeled by [125I]iodoazidobenzylpindolol (IABP) in WT and cyc-. The IABP photolabeling of the 55,000 dalton beta-receptor polypeptide was preferentially reduced by 1.0 mM DTT, whereas 10 mM DTT eliminated the photolabeling of both polypeptides. The effects of DTT were not due to either scavenging of the nitrene or reduction of the azide. A reduction in epinephrine stimulation of adenylate cyclase was also observed after treatment of intact WT, and the effects were readily reversed in the cells by washout of the DTT. The DTT effects on membranes were not reversed by washout. Our results demonstrate that the oxidized state of the lymphoma beta-receptor is necessary for maximum sensitivity to agonist stimulation of adenylate cyclase and that low concentrations of reducing agent selectively decrease specific photo-labeling of the 55,000 dalton beta-receptor polypeptide.", 
    "47": "The inhibitory effect of atropine on phospholipid 32P labelling stimulated by muscarinic or alpha-adrenergic agonists was studied in isolated parotid cells. Atropine (10(-11) to 10(-4) M) had no effect on phospholipid 32P labelling in unstimulated cells. In contrast, 10(-8) to 10(-7) M atropine provoked a competitive inhibition of the cholinergic stimulation (i.e. this effect was completely wiped out at high agonist concentration). The atropine app. KD for the muscarinic receptor was 5 X 10(-9) M. Moreover, atropine inhibits the adrenergic stimulation of phospholipid 32P labelling by decreasing the efficacity and potency of the adrenergic agonists. The atropine app. KD for the alpha-adrenergic receptor can be estimated at 10(-5) M. This inhibition of alpha-adrenergic stimulation appears to be specific since atropine was without effect on the substance P or beta-adrenergic stimulation. At very low concentration (10(-10) - 10(-9) M) atropine seems to be a modulator (activator) of the muscarinic or adrenergic agonist-receptor complex. From the present data, it is suggested that atropine, besides its classical blocker effect at the muscarinic receptor, at high concentration is a specific alpha-adrenergic antagonist.", 
    "48": "It has been widely reported that the chronic administration of antidepressant drugs induces a down regulation of beta receptors in the brains of experimental animals with a time course that parallels the therapeutic improvement seen in depressed patients given these drugs. It has been tacitly assumed that these beta receptors are located on neurons. All classes of antidepressant drugs tested, various monoamine uptake inhibitors, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, or novel drugs lacking either of these actions, reduced the retention of dihydroalprenolol by intact astrocytes in primary cultures. The drug concentrations altering this retention by astrocytes (Ki) are in the same range as those reported by other investigators using homogenates of glioma cells or whole brain. The isoproterenol-induced stimulation of cyclic AMP formation by astrocytes in primary cultures is reduced acutely by the antidepressants amitriptyline, tranylcypromine and doxepin. Following washout of the antidepressant drug, isoproterenol stimulation of adenylyl cyclase is reduced in astrocytes exposed in culture to amitriptyline or tranylcypromine for 12-14 days or longer but is not altered in astrocytes exposed to the antidepressants for only 5 days. This indicates that the chronic exposure of astrocytes in culture to antidepressant drugs, down regulates astrocyte beta receptors with a time course that parallels the beta down regulation seen in vivo in animal brain homogenates and the therapeutic improvement seen in depressed patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "The potential photoaffinity ligand 14-beta-(o-nitro, p-azido)-cinnamoyl-amino-N-cyclopropylmethylnormorphinone (NAM) and its derivative NOM, lacking the p-azido function, were synthesised and their opiate receptor activity determined in isolated tissue preparations. The ligands showed slow receptor kinetics. NAM was a pure competitive antagonist of met5-enkephalin responses in MVD while its antagonism of normorphine responses in GPI appeared non-competitive and non-reversible. In radioligand binding assays NOM completely and irreversibly blocked specific binding of 3H-DHM. Partial blockade of 3H-DADL specific binding was reversible by washing. No binding of NOM to kappa sites was observed. The slow receptor kinetics of NAM preclude its use as a photoaffinity ligand but suggest that a chemically more stable derivative may have a role as a pseudocovalent blocker of mu-receptors.", 
    "50": "Pineal glands obtained from rats of different ages were incubated in vitro with drugs known to specifically alter pre- or postsynaptic noradrenergic neurotransmission to determine when during development nerve terminal or receptor mediated control of glandular N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity might reach functional maturation. Basal daytime NAT activity measured in vitro was lowest in fetal rats, increased dramatically by the day of birth, peaked at 10 days postnatally, and subsequently declined to near adult levels by 25 days of age. Drugs (isoproterenol, norepinephrine, or propranolol) known to influence pineal gland NAT activity by acting directly on pinealocyte postsynaptic beta-noradrenoceptors produced comparable changes in enzyme activity at all ages studied, although larger doses of the receptor agonist were required in fetal animals to elevate NAT activity. In contrast, in vitro incubation with indirect acting drugs (amphetamine or 1-dopa) which require functional presynaptic nerve terminals to exert their pharmacological effects, failed to increase pineal gland NAT activity until early in postnatal life. Hence, postsynaptic beta-noradrenoceptors may function to control pineal gland NAT activity prior to the time when the presynaptic sympathetic neurons innervating the gland attain maturational status.", 
    "51": "The effects of captopril and propranolol on blood pressure, heart rate and plasma noradrenaline, renin and aldosterone, and on the responses to changes in posture and to isometric exercise were measured in patients with essential hypertension. During placebo administration blood pressure, heart rate and plasma noradrenaline rose on standing and during isometric exercise. The rise in diastolic blood pressure during isometric exercise correlated significantly with the rise in plasma noradrenaline. During captopril treatment blood pressure was significantly lower than during placebo administration when the patients were lying, standing or sitting, but the reduction during isometric exercise was not significant. Plasma renin increased, but heart rate, plasma noradrenaline and plasma aldosterone remained unchanged. The acute changes in blood pressure, heart rate and plasma noradrenaline produced by standing and isometric exercise during captopril treatment were similar to those during placebo administration. During propranolol treatment diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower than during placebo administration when the patients were lying, standing or sitting and during isometric exercise. Heart rate also fell. Plasma noradrenaline during standing, sitting and isometric exercise was significantly greater than during placebo administration. The changes in plasma noradrenaline measured during propranolol treatment with the patients supine were negatively correlated with noradrenaline values obtained during placebo administration: plasma noradrenaline fell in patients with higher, and increased in those with lower, initial concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "The effects of enalapril were assessed in a double-blind study versus propranolol. Twenty-two patients with essential hypertension were titrated with either enalapril (5, 10 and 20 mg twice daily) or propranolol (40, 80 and 120 mg twice daily). With propranolol blood pressure decreased from 154/101 +/- 4/1 to 146/98 +/- 5/2 mmHg (mean +/- SEM); with enalapril it decreased from 151/103 +/- 3/1 to 134/92 +/- 4/2 mmHg, both after 12 weeks of therapy. Effective renal plasma flow remained unchanged in the propranolol group whereas it increased from 413 +/- 19 to 445 +/- 27 ml/min (p less than 0.05) with enalapril. Glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged at either medication. Enalapril is an effective anti-hypertensive agent with a favourable effect on renal haemodynamics.", 
    "53": "To test the hypothesis that beta-blockade might impair potassium (K) tolerance in terminal renal failure we gave propranolol, and then atenolol, to a group of 12 clinically stable non-diabetic patients on chronic haemodialysis and on a constant diet containing approximately 50 mEq of K/day. Propranolol, 60 to 80 mg/day for 10 days induced a significant increase in predialysis serum K from 5.1 +/- 0.1 to 5.8 +/- 0.2 mEq/L (p less than 0.005). Atenolol (50 mg/day for 10 days) in the same group of patients did not produce a significant change in predialysis serum K (5.5 +/- 0.2 vs 5.2 +/- 0.2 mEq/L). Both propranolol and atenolol decreased heart rate but neither drug induced significant changes in plasma aldosterone, arterial pH, serum insulin or blood glucose. Thus in haemodialysis patients, beta-2 adrenergic blockade by propranolol is associated with a significant increase in serum K not mediated by pH, aldosterone or insulin, and probably due to inhibition of intracellular K uptake. Selective beta-1 adrenergic blockade by atenolol at low doses does not change serum K, and therefore, if indicated, cardioselective beta-blockers might be preferable to nonselective drugs in haemodialysis patients.", 
    "54": "Chronic administration of antidepressants reduces brain beta-adrenergic receptor number and function. Peptide and steroid hormones are also capable of modifying receptor activity, and because circulating levels of these substances are altered in depressed patients, studies have been undertaken to determine whether hormones influence the neurochemical responses to antidepressant drugs. Co-administration of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and imipramine induces a more rapid reduction in brain beta-adrenergic receptor binding than is observed with either substance alone. Moreover, by itself, ACTH treatment alters the ability of norepinephrine to stimulate cAMP accumulation in brain tissue without affecting recognition site number. Lesioning of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle blocks the decline in beta-receptor number and activity produced by the ACTH-imipramine treatment. Indeed, administration of ACTH facilitated these increase in beta-receptor number that occurs following denervation. These data indicate that ACTH treatment influences beta-adrenergic receptor adaptations that occur in response to a change in synaptic activity. Such findings have implications in regard to the clinical responses to antidepressants, and the role of hormones in the etiology of affective illness.", 
    "55": "The control by beta-adrenergic receptors of the production of oxygen radicals by zymosan-stimulated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and monocytes (M phi) was studied in vitro by means of chemiluminescence. In addition we asked whether PMN and M phi exhibit differential sensitivity to beta-adrenergic stimulation. For beta-adrenergic stimulation we applied fenoterol ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-9) M x 2.7. We found a dose-dependent suppression of the production of oxygen radicals, the ID50 being approximately 10(-6) M both for PMN and M phi. By assessment of lactic dehydrogenase release a cytotoxic effect of the drug could be ruled out. When incubated together with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol at 10(-6) and 10(-7) M the suppression effect of fenoterol could be reversed in dose-dependency. Preincubation with fenoterol revealed that the inhibitory action on M phi persisted, in contrast, no such suppression could be verified with PMN. Our findings indicate the control of the production of oxygen intermediates of human PMN and M phi by beta-adrenergic stimulation. Furthermore, selective functional modulation of resting PMN and M phi by beta-adrenoceptors is suggested. These effects may be of importance in vivo, in particular since fenoterol was applied in pharmacological doses.", 
    "56": "Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) produced the rapid relaxation followed by the contraction in the gallbladder strips from guinea pig. The contractile response to ATP was antagonized with theophylline, but not with apamin and atropine. The dose-response curve for ATP-induced contraction was shifted to the right by theophylline. The relaxation induced by ATP was blocked by apamin, but not by theophylline, phentolamine and propranolol. The dose-response curve for ATP-induced relaxation was shifted to the right and downwards by apamin. These results indicate that two kinds of receptors for ATP exist in the guinea pig gallbladder and the theophylline-sensitive receptors may be involved in the contractile response and the apamin-sensitive receptors in relaxation.", 
    "57": "It has been reported that pig skin epidermis contains at least four independent adenylate cyclase systems, i.e. 1) beta-adrenergic-, 2) histamine H2-, 3) adenosine and, 4) prostaglandin E-adenylate cyclase systems, resulting in the accumulation of cyclic AMP. Using human skin epidermis, we investigated the responses of adenylate cyclase to epinephrine, histamine, and adenosine. In normal human skin, all three agents increased cyclic AMP levels of the skin. The epinephrine effect was inhibited by a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol. The histamine effect was inhibited by a histamine H2 inhibitor, cimetidine. The adenosine effect was inhibited by theophylline. The effects of epinephrine and histamine were augmented by the addition of the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. Another phosphodiesterase inhibitor, papaverine, augmented the effects of all three agents. In contrast to pig skin epidermis, where histamine and adenosine-induced cyclic AMP accumulations were marked, in human skin, epinephrine-induced cyclic AMP accumulation was more marked than those induced by histamine and adenosine. Using the epidermis of Darier's disease, we also investigated the effects of epinephrine, histamine and adenosine on the cyclic AMP levels of the skin. The involved skin of Darier's disease was shown to be characterized by a defective beta-adrenergic responsiveness. These findings show that normal human skin possesses at least three independent adenylate cyclase systems (beta-adrenergic, histamine H2-, and adenosine-adenylate cyclase), as in pig skin epidermis, with a different responsiveness pattern to these stimulators. Our data also show that the responsiveness to each receptor-adenylate cyclase system may be modified in a pathological condition of epidermis such as in Darier's disease. The significance of decreased beta-adrenergic responsiveness in the involved skin in Darier's disease was discussed in relation to our previous finding of the same type of defect in the psoriatic-involved epidermis.", 
    "58": "The efficiency of separation of the radioligand receptor complex from the unbound ligand by both rapid filtration and centrifugation is compared for two standard receptor assays in the rat brain: the beta-adrenergic receptor using 3H-dihydroalprenolol and the benzodiazepine receptor using 3H-flunitrazepam. Whereas in beta-adrenergic binding studies both separation procedures yield similar binding data, the apparent binding in the benzodiazepine receptor assay is lower in the filtration experiments as compared to the data obtained by centrifugation, indicating an incomplete retention of the ligand receptor complex by filter. However, in both assays the results of the binding studies are highly dependent on the type of filters used. The following filters were compared: glass fibre filters GE/B and GF/C (Whatman Ltd., Kent, England), membrane filter HAWP (pore size 0.45 micrometer, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, U.S.A.) and glass fibre filters NK I, NK VIII, NK-15-90, NK 13-90, NK 14-120 (all produced by VEB Feinpapierfabrik Neu-Kaliss, G.D.R.). Although a somewhat higher specific binding can be obtained by the membrane filter and several types of the NK filters as compared to the most widely used Whatman GF/C the manifold higher unspecific binding of the radioligand by these filters does not favour their use in ligand assays. Retention as well as unspecific binding of the filter NK VIII is very similar to the Whatman GF/C filter. This new filter seems, therefore, well suited for radioligand studies.", 
    "59": "Alterations in the status or in the regulation of adrenoceptors may contribute to essential hypertension. This could be studied using the recently introduced radio-ligand binding techniques to characterize the adrenoceptors on human peripheral blood cells. The present study shows that patients with essential hypertension have a twofold increase of beta 2-adrenoceptor density on intact mononuclear cells as compared to normotensive controls: 859 +/- 260 (n = 10) vs. 420 +/- 119 (n = 10) maximal binding sites for (+/-) 125-Iodocyanopindolol expressed as molecules per cell (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, there is a highly significant correlation (r = 0.86) between the calculated mean arterial blood pressure and the beta 2-adrenoceptor density over a wide range of normal and increased blood pressure. These findings could only be demonstrated with intact mononuclear cells but not with membrane fractions. No difference was found in receptor affinity between patients with essential hypertension and normotensive controls. Thus, essential hypertension is combined with a higher beta 2-adrenoceptor density on intact mononuclear cells which might represent, for example, an increased density of prejunctional beta 2-adrenoceptors. Mean arterial blood pressure is positively correlated with beta 2-adrenoceptor density over a wide range of blood pressure in normotensives and hypertensives. The expression of beta 2-binding sites on the cell surface is possibly altered in essential hypertension resulting in a disparity between intracellular and extracellular binding sites as compared with normotensives.", 
    "60": "Potentiation of renin release can be achieved by combining adrenergic stimulation and renal vasodilatation. To examine whether pentobarbital anesthesia influences plasma renin concentration (PRC) by its vasodilatory effect, experiments were performed in rats subjected to increasing levels of adrenergic activity. PRC was two- to fourfold higher in anesthetized than in conscious rats when the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol HCl (0.05-3.2 micrograms kg-1 min-1) was infused. The sympathomimetic agent tyramine suppressed and the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phenoxybenzamine enhanced to the same extent the isoproterenol-stimulated PRC in conscious and anesthetized animals. Chronic renal denervation did not abolish the isoproterenol-pentobarbital synergistic effect on PRC. These results are consistent with the view that the renin response to pentobarbital anesthesia is somehow related to the vascular effects of the anesthetic.", 
    "61": "The consequences of selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition on the norepinephrine(NE)-sensitive adenylate cyclase system were determined in slices of rat cerebral cortex. The chronic administration of clorgyline, which selectively inhibited the activity of MAO-A, caused a significant decrease in the responsiveness of the noradrenergic cyclic AMP-generating system. The noradrenergic subsensitivity was accompanied by a significant decrease in the density of beta-adrenoceptors, as measured by 3H-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding, without altering the Kd value. However, selective inhibition of MAO-B by deprenyl did not alter the sensitivity of the cyclic AMP-generating system to NE or the specific DHA binding. The basal levels of cyclic AMP in the cortex were unaltered by the drugs. Since inhibition of MAO-A, but not MAO-B, increases the availability of NE, the results support the hypothesis that a persistent NE-receptor interaction is one of the prerequisites for the in vivo densitization of the NE-sensitive adenylate cyclase and the concomitant down-regulation of the number of beta-adrenoceptors in brain.", 
    "62": "A general model has been developed describing the relationship between the measured (IC50) and absolute affinities (KI), observed in radioligand binding studies when two ligands, one radioactive, interact with two receptors or binding sites. The model shows the dependence of the IC50's upon the concentration of radioligand for any combinations of the absolute affinities of the radioligand (Kd's) and the displacing ligand (KI's). By constraining the affinities of the two ligands for the sites, five special cases of the general model can be described that model all possible 'selectivities' the ligands may have for the sites. The properties of these five cases can be exploited experimentally to probe the nature of the ligand/site interactions by the simple expedient of constructing a number of displacement curves at different radioligand concentrations. The method has been tested experimentally in three situations where two ligand/two site interactions occur, and is shown to be a useful technique to qualitatively examine the underlying binding reactions.", 
    "63": "Two fractions of beta-adrenergic receptors have been separated from desensitized C62B cells by centrifugation on a sucrose gradient. Using two beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) antagonists, 125I-iodopindolol and (3H)CGP-12177, the different binding characteristics of these fractions have been investigated. While iodopindolol binds to beta AR both in a light (30% sucrose) and a heavy (45-50% sucrose) peak, CGP-12177 binds only to those in the heavy peak. Incubation of these two gradient fractions with the antibiotic alamethicin selectively increases the binding of CGP-12177 only in the light peak. This result suggests that the desensitization-induced light peak beta AR exist on the inside of vesicles. The hydrophilic ligand CGP-12177 is capable of reaching these receptors only through alamethicin-formed pores.", 
    "64": "After guinea pigs were exposed to histamine or acetylcholine aerosol for 1 week, alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic and cholinergic muscarinic receptors on the lung membranes were measured by direct binding techniques using 3H-prazosin, l-3H-dihydroalprenolol, and l-3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate, respectively, and adenylate cyclase responses to l-isoproterenol (10(-5) to 10(-8) M) and NaF (20 mM) were also examined on the membranes. After the inhalation, the number of beta-adrenergic receptors was decreased by about 25% without a significant change in binding affinity for l-3H-dihydroalprenolol, while the number and the affinity of alpha 1-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors on the membranes were not significantly different from those in the control animals. When compared with the control animals, the lung membranes showed a reduced adenylate cyclase response to l-isoproterenol, and the response to 10(-5) M of l-isoproterenol was significantly decreased by 11% in the lung membranes. The histamine inhalation showed no significant effect on basal adenylate cyclase activity and adenylate cyclase response to NaF.", 
    "65": "The action of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists has been studied on the membrane potential of glial cells in cultured rat central nervous system. Noradrenaline and the alpha-agonist phenylephrine caused a depolarization which was reversibly blocked by the alpha-antagonist phentolamine. In contrast, the beta-agonist isoprenaline hyperpolarized the glial membrane. This hyperpolarization was not associated with measurable changes in membrane resistance and was antagonized by the beta-blocker atenolol. These results suggest that the glial depolarization is mediated by activation of alpha-receptors, whereas the hyperpolarization is due to stimulation of beta-receptors. The existence of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors on glial cells is further supported by autoradiographic studies showing binding of noradrenaline and alpha- and beta-antagonists to astrocytes.", 
    "66": "The effect of timolol on the active transport system in the iris root-ciliary body of rabbits was studied to elucidate the action mechanism of timolol. Neither Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) nor Mg++-ATPase was inhibited by timolol at 1 X 10(-4) M concentration. None of the energy production parameters (oxygen consumption, glucose metabolism, and lactic acid formation) was inhibited by timolol either. Further, the biosynthesis of prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha was not affected by timolol at 1 X 10(-3) M. The blood flow to the eye was measured with a 85Sr-microsphere method. It was found that the blood flow in the iris root-ciliary body and choroid was significantly reduced by a topical application of 0.25% timolol. The dopamine concentration in the iris root-ciliary body was reduced by timolol at 1 X 10(-5) M concentration. Neither epinephrine nor norepinephrine concentration was altered by timolol. The results indicate that timolol reduces the rate of aqueous humor formation through reduction of blood flow to the ciliary process rather than via the inhibition of the active transport system or that of prostaglandin biosynthesis.", 
    "67": "The prophylactic effect of a single oral dose of 5 mg pindolol (P) or 100 mg metoprolol (M) on sympathetic and adrenergic stress reactions was investigated by a double blind study in 40 patients undergoing oral surgery. A reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart rate was noted after both, P and M, as was the increase of these parameters during surgery. Adrenaline-, noradrenaline- and c-AMP-level were reduced after systematic beta-blockade by P only, not after M. The increased lipolysis and glycolysis during surgery were prevented by P only. The stimulation of the hypothalamic and adrenal stress reactions were not influenced by either P or M. The application of the systematic beta-blocker with ISA (P) only was suited to prevent the increase of catecholamine levels in plasma and peripheral receptor stimulation.", 
    "68": "Although the alpha 2-adrenergic inhibitory control on lipolysis in several mammalian species, e.g. in dogs, hamsters, rabbits and also in man has been proved recently, in rats some peculiarities have been described in the alpha-adrenergic regulation of lipid mobilization. In the present study the effect of the specific alpha 2-adrenergic blocking agent--yohimbine (YOH)--on lipid mobilization in young (45-55 days old) and old (6 months) rats of the Wistar strain was followed and also its interaction with the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol and the specific alpha 2-adrenergic agonist--clonidine. Furthermore, the effect of YOH on the isoprenaline (ISO) induced lipolysis was studied. The adipokinetic effect was estimated from the amount of released non-esterified fatty acids from the tissue preparation into the incubation medium. In all experimental series YOH produced a significant response, which was concentration-dependent (pD2 6.2) with the maximum effect corresponding to 40% of the highest adipokinetic action of ISO. Young rats were more sensitive than old animals. In both age groups YOH non-competitively decreased the highest effect of ISO to the level of its own lipid-mobilizing activity. In the presence of YOH, the ISO dose-response curve therefore completely disappears. The adipokinetic effect of YOH can be antagonized competitively by clonidine (CLO) (pA2 6.25 and 6.01 for concentrations of CLO 1 and 10 mumol.1(-1) respectively). The inhibitory effect of propranolol is about two orders lower. It is concluded that in rats the alpha 2-adrenergic control rather concerns basal lipolysis, whereas induced lipid mobilization can be inhibited by depression of the alpha 2-activity.", 
    "69": "Plasma cyclic AMP levels during anaphylactic shock in rats was studied in 7 groups of animals: (1) control rats; (2) rats with adrenomedullectomy; (3) rats treated with propranolol; (4) rats with reserpinization; (5) rats with 6-hydroxydopamine-induced chemical sympathectomy; (6) rats treated with hexamethonium, and (7) rats treated with cocaine (catecholamine uptake inhibitor). All experiments were carried out in ovalbumin-sensitized rats. Plasma cyclic AMP showed a rapid increase during anaphylactic shock in control rats. Adrenomedullectomy abolished the anaphylaxis-induced increase in plasma cyclic AMP, while hexamethonium had no effect. Propranolol caused a dose-dependent abolition of the increase. The treatment of rats with reserpine, 6-hydroxydopamine or cocaine partially inhibited the increase in plasma cyclic AMP. The results show that the adrenal medulla is the major source of catecholamines during anaphylactic shock, and that catecholamines in the adrenergic neuronal terminals may be partly responsible for the anaphylaxis-induced increase in plasma cyclic AMP.", 
    "70": "The tricyclic antidepressant desmethylimipramine (DMI) 2.5 mg/kg IM was administered to adolescent baboons once daily for 21 days, to investigate changes in alpha- and beta-noradrenergic function. Prior to DMI treatment, plasma growth hormone (GH) responses to the intravenous infusion of an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, clonidine, or a beta 2-adrenergic antagonist, ICI 118,551, were determined. DMI, 2.5 mg/kg, administered acutely did not stimulate the release of GH (up to 4 h post injection). The GH response to clonidine was decreased 4 h after DMI, 2.5 mg/kg. Alterations in plasma GH response to clonidine and ICI 118,551 were evident during and after chronic DMI administration. The GH response to clonidine was significantly diminished after 2 days, and gradually returned to the pretreatment amplitude over 7-21 days of treatment, with an overshoot 2 days after DMI withdrawal. After 21 days of DMI administration the GH response to ICI 118,551 was significantly enhanced, and remained consistently elevated during a withdrawal period of 21 days. These changes in the response to an alpha-adrenergic agonist and a beta-adrenergic antagonist indicate that the long term regulatory changes in receptor sensitivity, occurring between 2 and 21 days of DMI treatment, compensate for the acute effects of DMI on these responses.", 
    "71": "Secretion of insulin is increased by beta-adrenergic agonists and inhibited by alpha-adrenergic agonists. However, administration of epinephrine, which acts on both types of receptors, inhibits insulin secretion. A preliminary study using [3H]-dihydroergocryptine and [3H]-dihydroalprenolol as the respective alpha- and beta-receptor binding ligands, surprisingly revealed a preponderance of beta-binding sites in normal rat pancreatic islets. The present study, using displacement by epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol and clonidine validated the use of these radioligands as appropriate for specific receptor binding in pancreatic islet cells. The islets were found to have 55 fmol/mg protein of alpha-adrenergic receptor sites and 170 fmol/mg protein of beta-receptor sites. The affinity of both alpha- and beta-receptors for epinephrine was similar, as judged by the displacement of either radioligand, thus ruling out a preferential affinity of alpha-receptor binding as an explanation for the alpha-inhibition of insulin secretion. The data on radioligand displacement by clonidine indicate that the alpha-receptor is of the alpha 2-type.", 
    "72": "We have studied the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol, a beta-adrenergic ligand, and [3H]spiroperidol, a dopaminergic ligand, to human peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations. The catechol-O-methyltransferase activity on these different cells was also determined. On intact living cells, an unequal distribution of both beta-adrenergic and dopaminergic binding sites was found between B- and T-lymphocyte subpopulations. In each binding, T cells exhibited a lower number of binding sites than B cells. On particulate preparation, catechol-O-methyltransferase activity showed a similar distribution, but binding data with such material were quite different. Although it was not possible to detect dopaminergic binding sites on particulate preparation, T and B lymphocytes contained equivalent numbers of beta-adrenergic binding sites. Different explanations for these results are proposed.", 
    "73": "Renal function was studied by means of the clearance method in the healthy subject during hypotonic polyuria induced in initial depletion conditions with or without adrenolytic treatment. Three experiments were performed: a) 19 in water-salt depletion; b) 9 in depletion associated with (+/-)-propranolol; c) 9 in depletion associated with prazosin. 15' clearance periods were carried out during control, dopamine infusion in a subpressor dose (0.1 microgram x kg-1 x min-1) and after suspension, respectively. PAH and endogenous creatinine clearance was also determined, Propranolol made no significant difference to renal function by comparison with simple depletion, whereas the more intense depletive effect of prazosin lead to a significant reduction in renal plasma flow and the glomerular filtration rate. Isosmotic and anisosmotic reabsorption of sodium (in % of the respective loads) was inhibited despite reduction of the filtrate and of the distal sodium load. Dopamine was ineffective as a vasodilator and natriuretic in water and salt depletion, while it displayed significant sodium-retaining properties. Pretreatment with propranolol and prazosin allowed dopamine to show vasodilator and hydrosaluretic effects during depletion. These results are in line with the view that the renal vasal and tubular alpha-adrenergic receptors make a significant contribution to the water and salt conservation associated with volume depletion, and that dopamine influences renal function under these experimental conditions probably by activating prejunctional beta-adrenergic receptors of noradrenergic nerve endings."
