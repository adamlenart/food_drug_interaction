One month later, 20 microl of 0.5% timolol was instilled into the 10 LASIK eyes, 10 PRK eyes, and the 20 control contralateral eyes. One hour later, 150 microl of aqueous humor was collected from all eyes, and the concentration of timolol in the aqueous humor was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The effect of LASIK and PRK on the corneal permeability to timolol was analyzed.",

The average timolol concentrations in the aqueous humor of the ten eyes 1 month after PRK and in the ten contralateral eyes were 1.24 +/- 0.43 microg/ml and 1.12 +/- 0.30 microg/ml (P = 0.483), respectively. The average ratio of timolol concentration in the aqueous humor of the LASIK or PRK eyes 1 month after surgery to that of the contralateral normal eyes was 1.18 +/- 0.58 or 1.19 +/- 0.67 (P = 0.972), respectively.",

The point of action is culminated to (1) Ca antagonism, (2) beta-adrenoceptors blocking action, and (3) anti-platelet action. Because Mg(2+) is one of physiology materials, more ideal effect can be expected than Mg(2+). On the other hand, in the new large-scale clinical trial of acute myocardial infarction (MAGIC), Mg(2+) was not able to show the expected outcomes although Mg(2+) is an important co-factor of 5'-nucleotidase activity which is a production enzyme of adenosine and may show cardioprotective effect through adenosine production increase. Therefore, we must say that we need further investigation on the role of Mg(2+) on the cardiovascular protection.",

Chronic angle-closure glaucoma was defined as optic neuropathy with or without a visual field defect, an anterior chamber angle in which the trabecular meshwork was not visible for at least 180 degrees on gonioscopy, and evidence of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) in association with a chronically elevated IOP. Static and dynamic gonioscopy was performed at baseline. The angles were graded in each quadrant according to the Shaffer scheme, and the number of clock hours of PAS was recorded. The change in daily IOP (defined as the mean of the 9:00 am and 5:00 pm IOP time point values) from baseline to week 12 was analyzed and correlated with mean angle width and extent of PAS.",

We report a retrospective study of the outcome in 95 consecutive patients with angiographically revealed arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Fifty-four patients underwent microsurgical total AVM removal (group I). Forty-one patients who refused open surgery (group II) were managed either by endovascular embolisation (16 cases), radiosurgery (three) or followed up with medical treatment for their symptoms. In the first group pretreatment with the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol before surgery, the current neuronavigation techniques, intraoperative embolisation and AVM nidus colouring in high flow AVM were used for total microsurgical excision of the lesions. All AVM patients but one survived microsurgery. The mortality rate was 1.8% for group I. Six patients with grade IV-V AVM developed new temporal neurological symptoms following surgery. Four of them recovered completely in 3-6 weeks; two patients remained with mild persistent monoparesis and with homonymous hemianopsia postoperatively. In ten of 13 epileptic patients surgery produced a cure. No patient re-bled following surgery. No postoperative normal perfusion pressure breakthrough occurred. In the second group ten patients (24%) developed intracerebral haemorrhages, six of ten patients demonstrated progressive seizures. The mortality rate in group II totalled 17% over 6 years. Microsurgical management approaches must consider preoperative correction of impaired cerebral autoregulation, neuronavigation for preoperative planning and intraoperative orientation, intraoperative embolisation and dying of the nidus for large high-flow AVMs.", 
    "12": "The acute coronary syndrome comprises unstable angina, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. A successful and stable revascularisation of the infarct related vessel, and the prevention of the loss of myocardium are the main therapeutic targets, as cardiovascular mortality and long term quality of life are essentially determined by left ventricular function. The clinical diagnosis comprises clinical symptoms, ECG-changes, and cardiac troponins. Early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become the most common method of coronary revascularisation. If PCI is not available, systemic thrombolysis is an alternative after exclusion of contraindications. Parenteral anticoagulation with intravenous or subcutaneous heparines, antithrombotic therapy and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are the common secondary drug therapy. Moreover, to prevent left ventricular remodelling ACE-inhibitors, angiotension 2-receptor antagonists, and beta-blocker are indicated.", 
    "13": "Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug with concomitant antiplatelet effects. It is safe and well tolerated, even in populations with high consumption of concomitant drugs. These data suggest that adverse events (AE) due to drug-to-drug interactions (DDI) with policosanol are not relevant. Experimental data indicate that potential DDI between policosanol and drugs metabolized through the cytochrome P450 hepatic system are not expected, but pharmacodynamic DDI cannot be excluded. Several clinical studies have shown that policosanol decreased arterial pressure compared with placebo, and a pharmacological interaction with beta-blockers was experimentally proven. Therefore, clinical DDI between policosanol and beta-blockers can be expected. This study investigated whether policosanol reinforces the antihypertensive effects of beta-blockers and/or whether this combination impairs some safety indicators or induces specific AE in older patients. After 5 weeks on a diet-only baseline period, 205 older hypercholesterolemic patients taking beta-blockers were randomized to policosanol 5 mg/day or placebo for 3 years. After 1 year on therapy, policosanol significantly reduced (p < 0.00001 versus placebo) low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (20.9%), total cholesterol (TC) (19.3%) and triglycerides (TG) (25.7%), whereas it increased (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 versus placebo) high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (4.1%). Treatment effects did not to wear off during the 3-year follow-up. At study completion, policosanol lowered (p < 0.00001 versus placebo) LDL-C (34.3%), TC (23.2%) and TG (21.2%) and raised (p < 0.00001 versus placebo) HDL-C (12.3%). Thirty-one patients (15.1%) discontinued the study, 22 in the placebo group (20.6%) and nine in the policosanol group (9.2%). Of these, 20 patients (16 in the placebo group and four in the policosanol group) withdrew from the study due to AE. The frequency of serious adverse events (SAE), mostly vascular, in policosanol patients (3/98, 3.1%) was lower than in the placebo group (15/107, 14.0%). No impairment of safety indicators was observed. Nevertheless, reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed in policosanol patients compared with those in the placebo group. The frequency of policosanol patients reporting mild or moderate AE (18/98, 18.4%) was also lower than in the placebo group (30/107, 28.0%). In conclusion, policosanol was well tolerated in elderly patients taking beta-block- ers and did not increase AE. Additional reduction of blood pressure and a lower frequency of SAE were observed in policosanol patients compared with those taking placebo. The cholesterol-lowering efficacy of policosanol was that expected. These results provide support that policosanol therapy added to hypercholesterolemic elderly individuals taking beta-blockers could provide additional benefits in lowering blood pressure; SAE were not more frequent in the policosanol group than in the placebo group and there was no increase in AE.", 
    "14": "Both beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist drugs (beta-blockers) and non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs), ie, diltiazem and verapamil, can cause sinus arrest or severe sinus bradycardia, and when drugs from the two classes are used together, these effects may be more than additive. We report nine patients in whom a beta-blocker (one patient), a non-DHP CCB (one patient), or the combination (seven patients) caused sinus arrest or severe sinus bradycardia which resulted in hospitalization in six of the nine. Although this combination of drugs always has the potential for causing profound bradycardia, certain aspects of the history, such as age, the presence of renal or hepatic disease, and the number and types of other medications, are further predictors of marked bradycardia with hypotension.", 
    "15": "Hypertensive emergencies encompass a variety of clinical conditions and several drugs are now available for use in these situations. The clinician should take into account the specific etiology of the severe hypertension, co-existing conditions of patient, and the pharmacology of agents when selecting a drug for treatment. In the case of hypertensive encephalopathy, the lowering of blood pressure is therapeutic as well as diagnostic. If the mental status does not improve within a few hours of lowering the blood pressure, other causes of hypertension should be considered. Historically, nitroprusside has been the most commonly used agent in this clinical situation. Alternative drugs that are easy to administer include labetalol and fenoldopam. Nitroglycerin and nicardipine may also be effective but clinical experience in hypertensive encephalopathy is limited. Drugs that cause sedation such as clonidine should not be used in order to avoid confusion with the neurological assessment.", 
    "16": "An approach has been developed for drug metabolism studies of non-radiolabeled compounds using on-line liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) combined with chip-based infusion following fraction collection. The potential of this approach, which improves the data quality compared with only LC/MS analysis, has been investigated for the analysis of in vitro metabolites of tolcapone and talinolol, two compounds with well-characterized metabolism. The information-dependent LC/MS/MS analysis enables the characterization of the major metabolites while the chip-based infusion is used to obtain good product ion spectra for lower level metabolites, to generate complementary MS information on potential metabolites detected in the LC/MS trace, or to screen for unexpected metabolites. Fractions from the chromatographic analysis are collected in 20 second steps, into a 96-well plate. The fractions of interest can be re-analyzed with chip-based infusion on a variety of mass spectrometers including triple quadrupole linear ion trap (QqLIT or Q TRAP) and QqTOF systems. Acquiring data for several minutes using multi-channel acquisition (MCA), or signal averaging while infusing the fractions at approximately 200 nL/min, permits about a 50 times gain in sensitivity (signal-to-noise) in MS/MS mode. A 5-10 microL sample fraction can be infused for more than 30 min allowing the time to perform various MS experiments such as MS(n), precursor ion or neutral loss scans and accurate mass measurement, all in either positive or negative mode. Through fraction collection and infusion, a significant gain in data quality is obtained along with a time-saving benefit, because the original sample needs neither to be re-analyzed by re-injection nor to be pre-concentrated. Therefore, a novel hydroxylated talinolol metabolite could be characterized with only one injection.",

Changing from supine to standing alone caused a significant increase in QTc in the LQT2 group compared with in control subjects (change in QTc of 48+/-38 ms versus 21+/-29 ms, respectively, P=0.02). While QT and QTc remained longer in LQT2 patients at peak exercise, QT shortening (QT peak minus QT supine) was greater in LQT2 patients than in control subjects (-158+/-32 ms versus -117+/-32 ms, P<0.001). Beta-blocker treatment had no effect on the resting QTc, but it normalized the increase in QTc on standing (45+/-29 ms before beta-blocker versus 23+/-32 ms after beta-blocker, P=0.03). During exercise, QT shortening and peak QTc were not affected by beta-blocker treatment.",

    "20": "Secondary prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) entails intervening in the aftermath of a traumatic event to forestall the development of PTSD. There has been little psychopharmacologic research in this area. This is surprising, given that PTSD is the mental disorder with the most clearly identified cause and onset. In a translational model of PTSD's pathogenesis presented herein: A traumatic event (unconditioned stimulus) overstimulates endogenous stress hormones (unconditioned response); these mediate an overconsolidation of the event's memory trace; recall of the event in response to reminders (conditioned stimulus); releases further stress hormones (conditioned response); these cause further overconsolidation; and the overconsolidated memory generates PTSD symptoms. Noradrenergic hyperactivity in the basolateral amygdala is hypothesized to mediate this cycle. Preventing pre-synaptic norepinephrine release with alpha2-adrenergic agonists or opioids, or blocking post-synaptic norepinephrine receptors with beta-adrenergic antagonists such as propranolol, reduces hormonally enhanced memories and fear conditioning. Two controlled studies of trauma victims presenting to emergency rooms suggest that posttrauma propranolol reduces subsequent PTSD, as does one naturalistic clinical study of morphine treatment of burned children. Cortisol both enhances memory consolidation and reduces memory retrieval, leading to mixed predictions. Two controlled studies of intensive care unit patients found that cortisol reduced PTSD. One study did not find benzodiazepines effective in preventing PTSD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antiepileptics, and alpha2-adrenergic agonists have yet to be tried.", 
    "21": "The aim of this study was to prepare and test an artificial corneal epithelium (reconstituted rabbit corneal epithelium, RRCE) exhibiting barrier characteristics and paracellular permeability similar to those of native rabbit cornea. The RRCE was obtained from a rabbit corneal epithelium (RCE) cell line grown for 8 days in submerged culture, then for 7 days in air-interface conditions on Snapwell polyester membranes. Permeation studies on the RRCE were carried out in comparison with rabbit excised corneas in vitro, using timolol maleate (TM) as the test drug, alone and in association with the following ocular permeation enhancers: benzalkonium chloride, ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid sodium salt, polyethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene stearyl ether, sodium deoxycholate, and escin. The integrity of the RRCE was assessed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) during culture time and after every permeation experiment. When TM was tested alone, the permeation parameters (apparent permeability coefficient, lag time) obtained with the RRCE were similar to those of excised rabbit corneas. The artificial epithelium, however, was less sensitive than native cornea to the effect of permeation enhancers.", 
    "22": "Patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) were dosed twice-daily with 0.5% timolol maleate for 2 years, followed by 2 years of twice-daily dosing with 0.5% betaxolol hydrochloride. The changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) and effects on visual field by each treatment were monitored over this 4-year period. Both the timolol and betaxolol treatments controlled IOP. The mean MD (mean deviation in visual field) values at 24 months of the timolol treatment were -6.18 dB (decibels) and -5.32 dB. Mean MD baseline values following 24 months of the timolol treatment produced 2.31 dB and 0.95 dB reductions in sensitivity in the right and left eyes, and the reduction in the right eye was statistically significant (p < 0.01). The mean MD values after 24 months of the betaxolol treatment were -3.82 dB in the right eyes, an increase of 2.36 dB, and -4.05 dB in the left eyes, up by 1.28 dB. The results from this clinical trial demonstrated that betaxolol was superior over timolol in improving mean retinal sensitivity.",

Latanoprost reduced the IOP from previous monotherapies, including nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers, topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, alpha-adrenergic agonists and pilocarpine (p < 0.0001) and adjunctive therapies, including the fixed combinations of dorzolamide and timolol, pilocarpine and timolol, and pilocarpine and metipranolol, and the unfixed combination of dorzolamide and timolol and dorzolamide and clonidine (p < 0.0028). Latanoprost further reduced the IOP across all diagnostic groups (p < 0.0001). The most common ocular adverse event was ocular irritation (n = 25; 1.6%), which was also the most common reason given for patients who discontinued latanoprost because of an adverse event (n = 20; 1.3%).",

    "27": "The property of carvedilol in acid-alkaline medium was studied by spectrofluorimetry. Effects of organic solvents on carvedilol fluorescence spectra were examined and the reason was discussed. A simple, rapid and high sensitive fluorimetric method for the determination of carvedilol in medicine is developed. The measurement of relative fluorescence intensity was carried out at 356 nm with excitation at 254 nm. Effects of pH, standing time and foreign ions on the determination of carvedilol have been examined. A linear relationship was obtained between the relative fluorescence intensity and concentration of carvedilol in the range of 0.50-270 ng ml(-1). The linear regression equation of the calibration graph is C = 0.000543F - 0.002 (C is concentration (microg ml(-1)) and F is relative fluorescence intensity in the equation), with a correlation coefficient of linear regression of 0.9998 and relative standard deviation of 2.31%. The detection limit of this method is 0.19 ng ml(-1), and recovery is from 98.70 to 102.1%. This method can be used for determination of carvedilol in tablet. The results obtained by this method agreed with those by the official method.", 
    "28": "Anti-hypertensive agents may differently stimulate compensatory neuro-hormonal mechanisms and induce different effects on the cardiovascular remodeling and function. The combination of low doses of the two synergistic drugs may lead to a lesser activation of counter regulatory mechanisms and could provide optimal therapeutic benefit. We evaluated on spontaneously hypertensive rats the effect of 3-week period of anti-hypertensive treatment. Rats were divided into four groups: control, bisoprolol (100 mg kg-1), hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg kg-1), and their combination with low doses (10 and 1 mg kg-1, respectively). The effects of treatment were evaluated on neuro-hormonal stimulation, cardiac and vascular structure and function. The combination had synergistic anti-hypertensive effects and significantly reduced heart rate and blood pressure but to a lower extent compared with bisoprolol 100 mg kg-1. Combination therapy was associated with a lower renin activation compared to hydrochlorothiazide alone and improved endothelial function. Cardiovascular remodeling differed between the groups: with bisoprolol, cardiac hypertrophy was reduced; with the combination therapy, the aortic media/lumen ratio was most increased. The consequent shear stress reduction may explain the associated endothelial function improvement. Such favourable cardiovascular remodeling with diuretic-beta-blockade combination may participate to the long-term cardiovascular protection during anti-hypertensive treatment.", 
    "29": "Increasingly, detailed characterization of human molecular genetic variation will facilitate the use of genetic information in preventing, diagnosing, and treating common diseases. One promising application is the identification of genetic variants influencing responses to drugs used to lower blood pressure (BP) and prevent target-organ complications of hypertension. This update on gene markers to guide antihypertensive therapy highlights polymorphisms recently reported to predict interindividual differences in response to antihypertensive medications. However, single-site variation in most genes makes only a small contribution to differences in BP response, and, after all known genetic and environmental predictors have been considered, most variation in responses still remains unexplained. Advancing beyond our current \"trial-and-error\" approach to selecting drug therapy in individual patients will undoubtedly require whole-genome approaches to discover additional, novel genetic pathways influencing drug response. In addition, larger samples will be required to more fully characterize genetic variation within candidate genes and to consider the joint effects of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Eventually, knowledge of genetic variants that influence BP responses may allow more individualized tailoring of therapy to optimally reduce BP and target-organ damage.", 
    "30": "Beta-adrenergic blockers provide significant cardioprotection during acute ischemia and reperfusion. To further explore the effects of additional alpha-1-adrenoceptor blockade on autonomic modulation in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), carvedilol was compared with metoprolol in the setting of primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). In a prospective study, 100 consecutive patients (61.1 +/- 11 years; 23 females) undergoing primary PCI for AMI were randomly assigned to metoprolol 200 mg/day vs carvedilol 25 mg/day. The first oral dose of study drug was administered upon hospital admission, and a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram was recorded. A total of 40 recordings of patients assigned to metoprolol and 39 of patients assigned to carvedilol were eligible for analysis of heart rate turbulence. Turbulence onset (TO), turbulence slope (TS), and turbulence timing were measured after ventricular premature beats (VPBs). The mean value of the 10 preceding RR intervals (mean RR) before VPBs was also measured. There were no significant differences in mean age, gender distributions, TIMI perfusion grades, left ventricular ejection fraction, site and size of infarction, duration of ischemia, and mean 24-hour heart rate between the two groups. Though the mean RR were not significantly different (metoprolol 863.1 +/- 157 ms; carvedilol 839.6 +/- 151 ms), there was a trend toward lower values of TO in the carvedilol group (-0.015 +/- 0.016 vs -0.012 +/- 0.023%; P = NS) and significantly higher values for TS in the metoprolol group (6.96 +/- 5.8 vs 5.6 +/- 4.22; P < 0.05). Turbulence timing was similar in both groups (metoprolol 5.8 +/- 2.4 vs carvedilol 6.1 +/- 2.1). In patients undergoing direct PCI for AMI, treatment with carvedilol, in contrast to metoprolol, was associated with a higher early acceleration and a lower deceleration of heart rate after VPBs, indicating differing effects on baroreceptor response due to additional alpha-1-adrenoceptor blockade. These data offer new insights into effects of a broader antiadrenergic therapy on autonomic reflexes in the acute phase of AMI.", 
    "31": "Beta-adrenergic blockers exert significant antiarrhythmic activity during ischemia and reperfusion. To further explore the beneficial effects conferred by alpha-1-adrenoceptor blockade on ventricular repolarization dynamicity in the acute phase of myocardial infarction (AMI), we compared carvedilol with metoprolol in the setting of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In a prospective study, 100 consecutive patients undergoing primary PCI for AMI were randomized to metoprolol 200 mg/day versus carvedilol 25 mg/day. The first oral dose of study drug was administered and a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram recorded upon hospital admission. Slopes of the linear QT/RR regression were determined before and after reperfusion. A total of 38 recordings of patients treated with metoprolol and 34 recordings of patients with carvedilol were eligible for analysis of QT/RR slopes. The two study groups were similar with respect to age, gender, TIMI perfusion grades, ventricular function, duration of ischemia, and site and size of infarction. Mean RR- and QT-intervals were similar to the metoprolol and carvedilol groups, before and after PCI. Likewise, there was no significant difference in QT/RR slopes between the metoprolol and carvedilol groups before PCI. In contrast, after PCI, there was a trend toward lower QT/RR slopes in the metoprolol group (from 0.18 +/- 0.07 to 0.17 +/- 0.08), and a significant decrease in QT/RR slopes in the carvedilol group (from 0.17 +/- 0.07 to 0.14 +/- 0.09). In patients undergoing successful direct PCI for AMI, treatment with carvedilol, in contrast to metoprolol, was associated with a significant decrease in QT-RR slopes, suggesting greater cardiac electrical stability.", 
    "32": "We report a case of intermittent complete left bundle branch block (CLBBB) which occurred during general anesthesia. An 83-year-old female was scheduled for upper lobectomy of the right lung under general anesthesia. Her preoperative 12-lead ECG showed atrial fibrillation and ST-depression in V4-6. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and pentazocine, and maintained with 0.5-1.5% isoflurane, 0-50% nitrous oxide in oxygen under close monitoring and appropriate respiratory management. The operation was performed uneventfully. Several minutes after the end of surgery, on converting her into the supine position from the left lateral decubitus position, widened QRS complexes, later diagnosed as CLBBB, appeared on ECG. At that time, heart rate was 92 beats x min(-1). After the administration of esmolol hydrochloride, heart rate decreased rapidly in a few minutes and ECG returned to normal conduction from CLBBB. We diagnosed this as rate-dependent intermittent CLBBB. Although intermittent CLBBB continued until the next day, the patient was asymptomatic and cardiac enzymes were within normal ranges. The intermittent CLBBB, which occasionally occurs during anesthesia, makes the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and acute myocardial infarction difficult. The present case suggests that esmolol can be used effectively and safely to distinguish CLBBB as a benign disorder from myocardial ischemia in a patient with CLBBB.", 
    "33": "The anesthetic management of patients with pheochromocytoma, in which drastic hemodynamic changes may occur, is still a challenge to even the most experienced anesthesiologist, although the perioperative mortality has been reduced remarkably. We report three patients who developed unexpected major complications during elective resection of a pheochromocytoma. The Case 1 patient was a 46 year-old woman who developed ventricular tachycardia immediately after administration of ephedrine for transient hypotension induced by excessive phentolamine. Even a mild beta adrenergic agent may cause extraordinary stimulation to myocardium under alpha blockade. The Case 2 patient was a 44 year-old man who needed intensive vasodilating therapy due to an exaggerated cardiovascular response to intraoperative surgical stress. He developed severe metabolic acidosis resembling hyperdynamic shock before resection of the tumor, although blood pressure was controlled within the expected range. The Case 3 patient was a 60 year-old woman who did not receive preoperative alpha blocker therapy because she lacked cardiovascular symptoms. However, she revealed a high level of systemic vascular resistance after induction of general anesthesia and needed moderate inotropic support to compensate for an abrupt reduction of vascular resistance after resection of the tumor. The pathophysiology of the disease is complex and anesthetic care must be tailored in accordance with each patient's situation.", 
    "34": "The cell toxic effects of nonionic surfactants were investigated by means of two in vitro models, namely pig nasal mucosa mounted in horizontal Ussing chambers, and Caco-2 cell monolayers. A series of homologous polyethyleneoxide (PEO) surfactants with a wide span in hydrophilic head-group size and hydrophobic chain lengths were screened for concentration-dependent effects on the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and mannitol permeability across Caco-2 cell monolayers. Trends in effects on permeability in the presence of increasing surfactant concentration coincided with the effects seen on TEER. Correlation of surfactant molecular structure with cell toxicity showed the size of the PEO group to be a more critical parameter than the size of the hydrocarbon chain. More specifically, the presence of very long PEO groups (>30 EO units) were found to lead to a decrease in cell toxicity. Similar trends were observed in the studies of the effects of PEO surfactants on pig nasal mucosa mounted in horizontal Ussing chambers. However, the nasal mucosa was somewhat more tolerant towards high surfactant concentrations than the Caco-2 cells. The relation between surfactant molecular structure and cell toxic effects is discussed in terms of micellar surface adsorption and micellar solubilization. The effect of the surfactants on the solubility of budesonide was investigated at two different surfactant concentrations (0.01 and 1 mg/mL). At the lower concentration, the solubilizing capacity of all of the surfactants was marginal, and there was no correlation between solubilizing capacity and cmc. At the higher concentration, on the other hand, all surfactants substantially increased the solubility of budesonide. The C18 PEO-ester with 40 EO units in the head group was found to be an efficient micellar solubilizer for budesonide, without causing adverse effects on the Caco-2 cell monolayers.", 
    "35": "Adequate growth of coronary vasculature in the remaining left ventricular (LV) myocardium after myocardial infarction (post-MI) is a crucial factor for myocyte survival and performance. We previously demonstrated that post-MI coronary angiogenesis can be stimulated by bradycardia induced with the ATP-sensitive K(+) channel antagonist alinidine. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that heart rate reduction with beta-blockade may also induce coronary growth in the post-MI heart. Transmural MI was induced in 12-mo-old male Sprague-Dawley rats by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Bradycardia was induced by administration of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol (AT) via drinking water (30 mg/day). Three groups of rats were compared: 1) control/sham (C/SH), 2) MI, and 3) MI + AT. In the MI + AT rats, heart rate was consistently reduced by 25-28% compared with C/SH rats. At 4 wk after left anterior descending coronary ligation, infarct size was similar in MI and MI + AT rats (67.1 and 61.5%, respectively), whereas a greater ventricular hypertrophy occurred in bradycardic rats, as indicated by a higher ventricular weight-to-body weight ratio (3.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.1 mg/g in MI rats). Analysis of LV function revealed a smaller drop in ejection fraction in the MI + AT than in the MI group ( approximately 24 vs. approximately 35%). Furthermore, in MI + AT rats, maximal coronary conductance and coronary perfusion reserve were significantly improved compared with the MI group. The better myocardial perfusion indexes in MI + AT rats were associated with a greater increase in arteriolar length density than in the MI group. Thus chronic reduction of heart rate induced with beta-selective blockade promotes growth of coronary arterioles and, thereby, facilitates regional myocardial perfusion in post-MI hearts.", 
    "36": "We have previously found that oral or intravenous (i.v.) administration of the polysaccharide fraction PB-2, extracted from the lichen Flavoparmelia baltimorensis, facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus (DG) in vivo. In this study, the mechanism underlying the effect of PB-2 on the induction of LTP was investigated in the DG of anesthetized rat focusing on the contribution of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor and the adrenaline beta-receptor. An i.v. injection of IL-1ra (10(-9) g/kg), an antagonist of the IL-1 receptor, had no effect on the basal response in the DG; however, this treatment augmented the enhancement of LTP induced by a single i.v. injection of PB-2 (10(-3) g/kg). This potentiating effect was also observed following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of IL-1ra (10(-15)-10(-11) g). An i.v. injection of IL-1beta (3.5 x 10(-15)-3.5 x 10(-9) g/kg) inhibited the induction of LTP, which was diminished by the previous application of IL-1ra. These results suggest that the activation of the IL-1 receptor induces the suppression of LTP in PB-2-treated rats, and that endogenous IL-1beta contributes to the IL-1 receptor activation. An i.c.v. infusion of metoprolol (7.5 x 10(-6) g), an antagonist of the adrenaline beta(1)-receptor, attenuated the enhancement of LTP induced by an i.v. injection of PB-2. These results suggest that PB-2 has two different effects on the LTP, an enhancing effect and an inhibiting one, and that it exhibited the significant enhancing effect on the LTP as a total balance of these effects.", 
    "37": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation is a common complication after open heart surgery; it increases morbidity, hospital stay, and costs. In an analysis of 8 large cardiac surgery trials totaling 20,193 patients, the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was estimated to be 26% and ranged from 17% to 35%. We reviewed the results of 52 studies published between 1966 and 2003 that evaluated pharmacologic strategies to prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation in nearly 10,000 patients undergoing open heart operations. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, after open heart operations occurred in 29% of patients who did not receive prophylactic drugs, compared with 12% in patients who received intravenous followed by oral amiodarone, 15% in those given sotalol, 16% in those given oral amiodarone, and 19% in those given beta-blockers. Pharmacologic strategies and regimens aimed at preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation are necessary to optimize the postoperative care of patients undergoing open heart operations. Although no strategy has consistently been shown to be superior to another, the most effective approach to preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation likely involves multiple interventions. In the absence of contraindications, all patients should receive beta-blocker therapy before and after the operation. For patients with 1 or more risk factors for postoperative atrial fibrillation, regimens consisting of either sotalol (beta-blocker with class III antiarrhythmic properties) alone or beta-blockers in combination with amiodarone seem to be the safest, most effective pharmacologic strategies for preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation.",

However, many important relations noted in GUSTO were corroborated by studies using CCP data. Both data sets identified similar predictors of ICH and presentation delay. The degree of variability in beta-blocker use (across geographic region) and angiography use (between genders) was remarkably similar when studied using CCP or GUSTO data.",

    "42": "Noradrenaline plays distinct roles in the modulation and consolidation of memory for one-trial, discriminated, avoidance learning in the chick. We have previously shown that activation of beta2-, beta3- and alpha1-adrenoceptors (ARs) by injection into the multimodal forebrain association region (intermediate medial hyperstriatum ventrale [IMHV] or intermediate medial mesopallium [IMM]) is involved in the consolidation of memory 30 min after training and that activation of alpha2-ARs in the caudate putamen plays a role in the reinforcement of memory leading to consolidation in the IMM (IMHV). In this paper we provide evidence that noradrenaline acts at beta1-ARs in the basal ganglia (lobus parolfactorius or medial striatum) in short-term memory processing immediately post-training and demonstrate inhibition of memory by selective AR antagonists at particular times in the sequential memory processing sequence after training. These results support separate roles for beta2- and beta3-ARs in memory consolidation. Our studies suggest that, as a consequence of the learning experience, noradrenaline acts in different brain regions and at different times in memory processing, to enhance memory through distinct populations of ARs.", 
    "43": "The effects of PACAP-38 on the extinction of active avoidance learning were studied in rats. The action of transmitter mediation was followed by pretreating the animals with appropriate receptor antagonists. PACAP-38 administered into the lateral brain ventricle caused a transitory facilitation of the extinction of a learned active avoidance response at 3 and 6 h following extinction, which had returned to or even above the control level at the 24-h testing. PACAP 6-38, which is an antagonist of PACAP-38, and an antibody against PACAP-38, prevented this action. When the animals were retested during a further 10 days, the control animals demonstrated response extinction on day 7, while the PACAP-38-treated animals still showed a high proportion (70%) of positive responses. The following receptor blockers diminished the action of PACAP-38 on the facilitation of extinction: propranolol, haloperidol, naloxone, bicuculline and nitro-L-arginine, the latter by blocking nitric oxide formation. Phenoxybenzamine and atropine were ineffective. The data reveal that the transitory action of PACAP-38 within 24 h on the facilitation of extinction is mediated by beta-adrenergic, dopaminergic, GABA-ergic and opiate receptors and nitric oxide. This transitory facilitated extinction is caused partly by depressed locomotion and presumably also an increased body temperature. Following a transitory facilitation of extinction from 24 h on, PACAP-38 demonstrated a greatly delayed extinction, which lasted for more than 7 days, while the control animals displayed complete extinction. The data suggest that PACAP-38 facilitates memory retrieval processes in the extinction of the active avoidance reflex.", 
    "44": "We investigated potential contribution of K+ channel activity to regulation of ischemia-induced neuronal injury, using cerebrocortical slice cultures. Exposure of cultures to a glucose-free conditioning solution containing sodium azide and 2-deoxyglucose caused neuronal cell death as assessed by cellular uptake of propidium iodide, which was prevented by MK-801, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. Application of tetraethylammonium markedly exacerbated ischemic neuronal injury. Charybdotoxin, a blocker of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ (BK(Ca)) channels, also augmented ischemic injury, whereas AM 92016, a blocker of delayed rectifier K+ channels, and dequalinium, a blocker of small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels, had no significant effect. In addition, tetraethylammonium and charybdotoxin were effective in augmenting NMDA-induced neuronal injury. These results present unprecedented evidence for the ability of tetraethylammonium to enhance ischemic neuronal death, and suggest that BK(Ca) channels constitute an endogenous system to protect cortical neurons from ischemic injury, via prevention of NMDA receptor over-activation.", 
    "45": "LVP1, a novel protein inducing lipolytic response in adipose cells, was purified from scorpion Buthus occitanus tunetanus venom. It represented 1% of crude venom proteins, with pHi approximately 6 and molecular mass of 16170 Da. In contrast to well-characterized scorpion toxins, reduction and alkylation of LVP1 revealed an heterodimeric structure. Isolated alpha and beta chains of LVP1 have a respective molecular mass of 8877 and 8807 Da as determined by mass spectrometry. The N-terminal and some internal peptide sequences of LVP1alpha and beta were determined by Edman degradation. The full amino acid sequences of both chains were deduced from nucleotide sequences of the corresponding cDNAs prepared based on peptide sequences and the 3' and 5' RACE methodologies. LVP1alpha and beta cDNAs encode a signal peptide of 22 residues and a mature peptide of 69 and 73 residues, respectively. Each mature peptide contains seven cysteines, which are compatible with an interchain disulfide bridge. The cDNA deduced protein structures share a high similarity with those of some Na+ channel scorpion toxins. LVP1 was not toxic to mice after intracerebro-ventricular injection. LVP1 stimulated lipolysis on freshly dissociated rat adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner with EC50 of approximately 1+0.5 microg/ml. LVP1 subunits did not display any lipolytic activity. As previously described for venom, beta adrenergic receptor (beta AR) antagonists interfere with LVP1 activity. Furthermore, it is shown that LVP1 competes with [3H]-CGP 12177 (beta1/beta2 antagonist) for binding to adipocyte plasma membrane with an IC50 of about 10(-7) M. These results demonstrate the existence of a new type of scorpion venom nontoxic peptides that are structurally related to Na+ channel toxins but can exert a distinct biological activity on adipocyte lipolysis through a beta-type adrenoreceptor pathway.", 
    "46": "Based on the results of independent studies the involvement of norepinephrine in REM sleep regulation was known. Isolated studies showed that the effect could be mediated through either one or more subtypes of adrenoceptors. Earlier we have reported that REM-OFF neurons continue firing during REM sleep deprivation and mild but continuous stimulation of locus coeruleus (LC) or picrotoxin injection into the LC, that did not allow the REM-OFF neurons in the LC to stop firing, reduced REM sleep. However, the mechanism of action and type of adrenoreceptors involved in REM sleep regulation were unknown. The possible mechanism of action has been investigated in this study. It was proposed that if LC stimulation-induced decrease in REM sleep was due to norepinephrine, adrenergic antagonist must prevent the effect. Therefore, in this study, the effects of alpha1, alpha2 and beta-antagonists, viz. prazosin, yohimbine and propranolol, respectively, and alpha2 agonist, clonidine, on LC stimulation-induced reduction in REM sleep were investigated. The results showed that stimulation of LC inhibited REM sleep by reducing the frequency of generation of REM sleep, although the duration per episode remained unaffected. This decrease in the frequency of REM sleep was blocked by beta-antagonist propranolol while the duration of REM sleep per episode was blocked by alpha1-antagonist, prazosin. Also, a critical level of norepinephrine in the system was required for the generation of REM sleep, however, a higher level may be inhibitory. Based on the results of this study and our earlier studies, an interaction between neurons, containing different neurotransmitters and their subtypes of receptors for LC-mediated regulation of REM sleep has been proposed.", 
    "47": "Patients with congenital long QT syndrome may develop arrhythmias under conditions of increased sympathetic tone. We have addressed whether some of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers commonly used to prevent the development of these arrhythmias could per se block the cardiac HERG (Human Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene) potassium channels, which would be a most unwanted side effect. HERG potassium channels were heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the currents measured by two-electrode-voltage-clamp technique. Propranolol caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of HERG current with an IC50 value of 81 microM at -10 mV. When HERG was co-expressed with the accessory subunit KCNE2, an IC50 value of 52 microM was determined. The block by propranolol was voltage-dependent, but it did not change the HERG channel deactivation kinetics. The propranolol analogue ICI118551 ((+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol hydrochloride) blocked the HERG channel with similar affinity, whereas the beta1-receptor antagonists metoprolol and atenolol showed weak effects. Further, the four compounds blocked HERG channels expressed in a mammalian HEK293 cell line. These data showed that HERG blockade by beta-adrenoceptor blockers occurred only at high micromolar concentrations, which are significantly above the recently established safe margin of 100 (Redfern et al., 2003).", 
    "48": "The perioperative management of patients at risk for cardiovascular diseases who undergo non-cardiac surgery has been subject of debate over the past few decades and is still of great interest. An adequate perioperative management may modify postoperative mortality and morbidity and may improve the long-term prognosis. The purpose of this review is to examine the present day knowledge regarding the preoperative evaluation and perioperative and postoperative management. In spite of the available guidelines (the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association of 1996) and of several studies on this subject, many controversies still persist. The main questions are: 1) the preoperative cardiovascular evaluation through non-invasive tests (and the true predictive value of the increased cardiovascular risk) and 2) the real benefit of coronary revascularization before non-cardiac surgery. The last part of this review highlights many recent clinical observations and experimental studies regarding the efficacy of the extensive use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers and optimized anti-ischemic pharmacological therapy in reducing the cardiovascular risk of non-cardiac surgery and in improving the long-term prognosis.",

Simple markers to identify patients at high risk for non-aortic complications of dissection are lacking. We investigated the effect of renal insufficiency on the presentation, complications, and outcome of patients with acute aortic dissection. We evaluated 638 patients with type A and 365 patients with type B aortic dissection enrolled in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) between January 1996 and December 2000. Chi-squared and Student's ttesting were performed to identify the effect of renal insufficiency on patient presentation, management, and outcome. Patients with renal insufficiency more often required nitroprusside for blood pressure control (type A: 40.7% vs 31.1%, p = 0.049; type B: 66.7% vs 37.3, p = 0.0001) and had a greater risk of mesenteric ischemia (type A: 10.7% vs 1.4%, p < 0.0001; type B: 17.7% vs 3.0%, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, aortic dissection patients with renal insufficiency are at increased risk for drug-resistant hypertension and aortic branch vessel compromise. Routine measurement of serum creatinine provides a readily accessible clinical marker for important complications. Upon recognition, renal impairment indicates a need for close monitoring, aggressive blood pressure control, and evaluation of aortic branch vessel circulations.",

Beta-adrenergic receptor-blockers have emerged as a cornerstone in the management of symptomatic heart failure. This article reviews the normal functioning of the beta-adrenergic pathway, the consequences of hyperadrenergism on this crucial signaling pathway, and the mechanisms by which chronic beta-blocker therapy reverses these abnormalities. The clinical evidence from controlled trials of the efficacy of beta-blockers in treating heart failure is summarized. Finally, the concomitant use of beta-blockers and positive inotropic agents in advanced heart failure is discussed.", 
    "56": "1. The effects of the main component of the Tityus serrulatus scorpion venom, toxin TsTX-I, were studied on the contractility and release of neurotransmitters in the rat vas deferens. Since TsTX-I is known to act on sodium channels, we used veratridine, another sodium channel agent, for comparison. 2. Toxin TsTX-I induced concentration-dependent contractions with an EC(50) value of 47.8+/-0.1 nM and a maximum effect of 84.4+/-10.4% of that for BaCl(2). 3. Contractions by TsTX-I were abolished by denervation or tetrodotoxin (0.1 microM), showing that the toxin effects depend on the integrity of sympathetic nerve terminals. 4. To check for the presence of a noradrenergic component, experiments were conducted after removal of adrenergic stores in nerve terminals by reserpinization (10 mg kg(-1), 24 h prior to experiments) or blockade of alpha(1) adrenoceptors by prazosin (30 microM), showing that these procedures did not modify the response to TsTX-I, and therefore that adrenoceptors were not involved in contractions. 5. To check for the presence of a purinergic component, experiments were carried out after blockade of P(2X) receptors by suramin (0.1 mM) or desensitization by alpha,beta-methylene-ATP (30 microM). These agents greatly abolished the contractile response to TsTX-I (about 83% by desensitization and 96% by suramin), showing the involvement of purinergic receptors. 6. The release of noradrenaline and purinergic agents (ATP, ADP, AMP and adenosine) was detected by HPLC. Together, the total release of purines in the presence of TsTX-I was about 42 times higher than in the control group. In contrast, TsTX-I did not modify the overflow of noradrenaline, showing that the release was selective for purines. 7. The release of purinergic agents was reduced by the N-type calcium channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA (1 microM) and by the P/Q-type blocker omega-conotoxin MVIIC (1 microM), showing that the effects of TsTX-I are calcium-dependent. 8. The results show that TsTX-I produced a selective release of purines from postganglionic sympathetic nerves in the rat vas deferens.",

In order to further explore excitatory NANC neurotransmission, we performed conventional intracellular recordings from guinea-pig taenia caeci smooth muscle. Tissue was perfused with oxygenated Krebs solution at 35 degrees C and nerve responses evoked by either oral or aboral nerve stimulation (NS) (4 square wave pulses, 0.3 ms duration, 20 Hz). Electrical activity was characterized by slow waves upon which one to three action potentials were superimposed. Oral NS evoked an inhibitory junction potential (IJP) at either the valley or peak of the slow wave. Application of nifedipine (1 microM) abolished slow waves and action potentials, but membrane potential flunctuations (1-3 mV) and IJPs remained unaffected. Concomitant application of apamin (300 nM), a small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel blocker, converted the IJP to an EJP that was followed by slow IJP. Further administration of N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 200 microM), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, abolished the slow IJP without affecting the EJP, implying that the slow IJP is due to nitrergic innervation. The EJP was abolished by tetrodotoxin (1 microM), but was not significantly affected by atropine (3 microM) and guanethidine (3 microM) or hexamethonium (500 microM). Substance P (SP, 1 microM) desensitization caused slight attenuation of the EJP, but the EJP was abolished by desensitization with alpha,beta-methylene ATP (50 microM), a P2 purinoceptor agonist that is more potent than ATP at the P2X receptor subtype, suramin (100 microM), a non-selective P2 purinoceptor antagonist, and pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS, 100 microM) , a selective P2X purinoceptor antagonist. In contrast, the EJP was unaffected by MRS-2179 (2 microM), a selective P2Y(1) receptor antagonist. Aboral NS evoked an apamin- and l-NAME-sensitive IJP, but virtually no NANC EJP. These data suggest the presence of polarized excitatory purinergic neurotransmission in guinea-pig taenia caeci, which appears to be mediated by P2X purinoceptors, most likely the P2X(1) subtype.",

    "75": "Thirty-six patients undergoing vaginal total hysterectomy under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control group (n = 12), L5 group (n = 12), and L10 group (n = 12). In the control, L5, and L10 groups, the patients were given saline, landiolol 5 mg, and 10 mg, respectively, just before infiltration of epinephrine(1 : 300,000; total dose, about 100 microg) into the surgical field. Blood pressure and heart rate was assessed before and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 min after the initiation of epinephrine infiltration. If systolic blood pressure and heart rate exceeded 160 mmHg and 120 beats.min(-1), respectively, Ca blockers of either diltiazem 5 mg or nicardipine 1 mg and/or 2% sevoflurane were given.", 
    "76": "Epinephrine infiltration significantly increased systolic blood pressure from 122 +/- 15 to 170 +/- 29 mmHg and heart rate from 63 +/- 8 to 106 +/- 10 beats.min(-1). In both the L5 and L10 groups, the increase in heart rate (from 69 +/- 16 to 87 +/- 16 beats.min(-1), P < 0.01, and from 70 +/- 18 to 76 +/- 9 beats.min(-1), P < 0.01, respectively) was significantly smaller compared to the control group, but the increase in systolic blood pressure was significantly attenuated in the L10 group (from 116 +/- 18 to 140 +/- 27 mmHg, P < 0.01). The number of patients given either Ca blockers or sevoflurane in the control group was significantly higher than that in the landiolol groups (P < 0.01).",

    "79": "Previous studies showed that alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor stimulation by catecholamines influenced neutrophil function, cytokine liberation, and platelet aggregability. We investigated whether adrenergic stimulation with epinephrine also alters platelet-neutrophil adhesion. This might be of specific interest in the critically ill, because the increased association of platelets and neutrophils has been shown to be of key importance in inflammation and thrombosis. For this purpose, whole blood was incubated with increasing concentrations of epinephrine (10 nM, 100 nM, and 1 microM). To distinguish receptor-specific effects, a subset of samples was incubated with propranolol (10 microM) or phentolamine (10 microM) before exposure to epinephrine. After incubation, another subset of samples was also stimulated with 100 nM of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. All samples were stained, and platelet-neutrophil adhesion and CD45, L-selectin, CD11b, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, and P-selectin expression were measured by two-color flow cytometry. Epinephrine significantly enhanced platelet-neutrophil adhesion and P-selectin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa expression on platelets. CD11b and L-selectin expression on unstimulated neutrophils remained unchanged, whereas N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-induced upregulation of CD11b and downregulation of L-selectin were suppressed by epinephrine. beta-Adrenergic blockade before incubation with epinephrine increased platelet-neutrophil aggregates and adhesion molecule expression (CD11b, P-selectin, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) even further. These results demonstrate that epinephrine enhances platelet-neutrophil adhesion. The alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated increase in P-selectin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa expression on platelets may contribute substantially to this effect. Our study shows that inotropic support enhances the platelet-neutrophil interaction, which might be crucial for critically ill patients.", 
    "80": "A wide variety of vasoactive drugs have been used to treat the acute hypertensive response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). We designed this randomized, double-blind, saline-controlled, crossover study to compare three different doses of nicardipine when administered before the ECT stimulus. Twenty-five patients undergoing a series of 4 ECT treatments received bolus injections of either saline or nicardipine 20, 40, or 80 mug/kg IV in a random sequence during a standardized methohexital (1 mg/kg) and succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) anesthetic technique. The mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate values were recorded at specific time intervals, as were the duration of seizure activity and the need for rescue labetalol. Both the 40 and 80 mug/kg doses of nicardipine reduced the percentage increase in MAP above the baseline value compared with the saline group (7% and 7% versus 30%, respectively). Nicardipine 40 and 80 mug/kg were also associated with a significant reduction in the need for labetalol (7 +/- 3 mg and 5 +/- 0 mg versus 22 +/- 10 mg in the saline group). Compared with the 40 mug/kg dose, nicardipine 80 mug/kg was associated with a more rapid heart rate at the time the ECT stimulus was applied. The 80 mug/kg dose was also associated with a reduced MAP value on awakening compared with the baseline value (91 +/- 12 mm Hg versus 102 +/- 8 mm Hg). We conclude that a bolus injection of nicardipine 40 mug/kg IV immediately before the ECT stimulus was optimal for controlling the acute hemodynamic response to ECT treatments.",

Mental stress may trigger serious arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardias and ventricular fibrillation. This study investigates gender differences in the electrophysiologic effects on different levels of the cardiac conduction system elicited by mental stress and autonomic tone inhibition.", 
    "82": "Twenty-three healthy volunteers (11 male and 12 female) participated in the study. Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic variables were measured at baseline, during mental stress produced by Stroop's color word conflict test (CWT), and after autonomic tone inhibition (ATI) with propranolol (0.15 mg/kg) and atropine (0.02 mg/kg). During CWT, men showed shorter QT and JT durations, whereas women had shorter refractoriness in the atrial tissue and AV node. After ATI, no gender differences in sinus nodal properties were noted, whereas AV nodal refractoriness and conduction time became shorter in women, and QT and JT duration and the refractory period of the right ventricle were shorter in men.", 
    "83": "In women, mental stress produces a pronounced effect on the AV node and on the sinus node. Men react with a more pronounced effect on ventricular electrophysiologic properties. Certain gender differences in cardiac electrophysiologic properties seem to be intrinsic. After ATI, women have a higher heart rate and shorter AV nodal refractoriness but longer QT and JT intervals and longer effective refractory periods in the right ventricle. These differences may partly explain why certain arrhythmias occur more often in women than in men.", 
    "84": "1. We have investigated the effect of tityus gamma (TiTX gamma) scorpion toxin on the release of [3H]dopamine in rat brain prefrontal cortical slices. The stimulatory effect of TiTX gamma on the release of [3H]dopamine was dose/time-dependent with an EC50 of 0.01 microM. 2. Tetrodotoxin blocked the TiTX gamma-induced release of [3H]dopamine, indicating the dependency for Na+ channels. 3. EGTA had no effect on the TiTX gamma-induced release of [3H]dopamine, indicating the process is independent of extracellular calcium. Release of [3H]dopamine evoked by TiTX gamma was inhibited by 57% by BAPTA, a chelator of intracellular calcium. 4. Xestospongin and 2-APB, putative blockers of IP3-sensitive release of intracellular calcium stores, caused an equal and significant inhibition of 24% of the TiTX gamma-induced release of [3H]dopamine, while the slight inhibition evoked by dantrolene, a putative blocker of ryanodine-sensitive calcium store was not significant. 5. Nomifensine and ascorbic acid, blockers of dopamine transporter (DAT), caused an inhibition of 27 and 29%, respectively, on the toxin-induced release of [3H]dopamine suggesting that most of the TiTX gamma-induced release of dopamine is not due to the reversal of Na+ gradient. 6. In conclusion the majority of the TiTX gamma-induced release of [3H]dopamine is exocytotic and mobilizes calcium from the intracellular IP3-sensitive calcium stores.", 
    "85": "The study goal was the analysis of effectiveness of hemodynamic management of patients undergoing interfacility transport for suspected acute aortic dissection (SAAD). Our retrospective, consecutive-case review examined 62 nonhypotensive patients transported by an air emergency medical services (EMS) service during 1998 to 2002, with referral hospital diagnosis of SAAD. Of patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 120 upon air EMS arrival, antihypertensives had been given in only 23/42 (54.8%). In 19 cases where pretransport SBP is less than 120, with no referral hospital antihypertensive therapy given, median pretransport SBP was 158 (range, 122-212). In 20/62 cases (32.3%), the air EMS agency instituted antihypertensive therapy, which was successful; of 42 cases with pretransport SBP less than 120, mean intratransport SBP decrement was 24 (95% confidence interval, 16-32). In patients undergoing transport for SAAD, pretransport hemodynamic therapy was frequently omitted and often inadequate, generating an opportunity for air EMS intervention. Education to improve SAAD care should focus upon both referral hospitals and transport services.", 
    "86": "Most individuals with arterial hypertension or congestive heart failure are insulin-resistant and at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), using an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or a selective angiotensin receptor AT1 blocker (ARB), may exert favourable metabolic effects capable of preventing T2DM in high risk individuals. We performed a meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of RAS inhibition on the incidence of new cases of T2DM in patients with arterial hypertension or congestive heart failure. Ten RCTs with cardiovascular prognosis as primary endpoints analysed the incidence of T2DM as secondary endpoints or as post-hoc analysis after a mean follow-up of 1 to 6 years: five with an ACEI and five with an ARB, compared with a placebo (n=4) or a reference drug (beta-blocker or diuretic: n=5; amlodipine: n=2). Eight RCTs concerned hypertensive patients: STOP Hypertension-2 (lisinopril or enalapril vs beta-blocker or diuretic), CAPPP (captopril vs thiazide or beta-blocker), HOPE (ramipril vs placebo), ALLHAT (lisinopril vs chlorthalidone and lisinopril vs amlodipine), LIFE (losartan vs atenolol), SCOPE (candesartan vs placebo), ALPINE (candesartan vs placebo) and VALUE (valsartan vs amlodipine). Two RCTs concerned patients with congestive heart failure: SOLVD (enalapril vs placebo) and CHARM-overall programme (candesartan vs placebo). Overall, 2 675 new cases of T2DM (7.40%) were observed in the group of 36 167 patients receiving a treatment with ACEI or ARA as compared with 3 842 events (9.63%) in the group of 39 902 control patients. A mean weighed relative risk reduction of new T2DM of 22% (95% CI: 18, 26; p<0.00001) was observed after RAS inhibition. The beneficial effect was similar with ACEIs and with ARBs as well as in patients with hypertension and in those with heart failure, and was also present whatever the comparator (placebo or beta-blockers/diuretics or amlodipine). The number needed-to-treat to avoid one new case of T2DM averaged 45 patients over 4-5 years. In conclusion, RAS inhibition consistently and significantly reduces the incidence of T2DM in individuals with arterial hypertension or with congestive heart failure. Considering the pandemic of T2DM, such pharmacological approach deserves further attention among the strategies aiming at preventing T2DM.",

Age/gender/treatment-adjusted KM analysis revealed significant differences only in the cohorts with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), defined as LVEF >45%, or in less symptomatic patients (New York Heart Association I or II). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that beta-blocker (BB) was associated with a significant reduction in mortality from cardiac causes, and either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) was significantly related to the improvement of survival in the MI cohort (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.222 and 0.497, p<0.05), even though these medicines were used significantly less often in the MI cohort.",

Images were reconstructed at 30-80% of the cardiac cycle in increments of 5%. Image quality of the following eight coronary segments was assessed by two radiologists in consensus: left main coronary artery; proximal and middle segments of the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) coronary arteries; and the proximal, middle, and distal segments of the right coronary artery (RCA).

Permeability experiments were performed both in the choroid-to-retina (inward) direction and in the retina-to-choroid (outward) direction. Carboxyfluorescein and FITC-dextrans were determined by fluorometry, and beta-blockers by HPLC. The transepithelial electrical resistance and potential difference were monitored during the experiments.", 
    "96": "Permeability of the fluorescent FITC-dextran probes through RPE-choroid decreased significantly with the increasing size of the probe. RPE-choroid was 35 times more permeable to carboxyfluorescein (376 Da) than to FITC-dextran 80 kDa. The permeabilities of lipophilic beta-blockers were up to 8 and 20 times higher than that of hydrophilic atenolol and carboxyfluorescein, respectively. The lag time of solute flux across the RPE-choroid increased with the molecular weight and lipophilicity. Compared with published data on isolated sclera, bovine RPE-choroid was 10 to 100 times less permeable to hydrophilic compounds and macromolecules. The permeability of lipophilic molecules in RPE-choroid was in the same range as in the sclera.",

Higher manipulation costs (i.e. process-specific slowing of reaction times in the manipulation conditions compared to the control condition) were observed after propranolol but not after atenolol. The propranolol effect was mainly observed in subjects with low emotional arousal (i.e. low state anxiety rating at baseline). Because both beta-blockers induced a comparable decrease of blood pressure and pulse, the propranolol effect on the 'working component' of working memory is considered to be a central, presumably prefrontal one.", 
    "99": "The rat has been used increasingly in glaucoma research, but many aspects regarding the regulation of its intraocular pressure (IOP) are still unknown. For example, it is not clear whether glaucoma medications can lower IOP in the rat similarly to human. This information will be valuable in evaluating this animal model for its usefulness in predicting drug effects in patients. Hence, we tested the acute IOP effects of selected glaucoma drugs topical administered onto the rat eye. In these studies, IOP was measured using the Tono-Pen XL tonometer. After a correlation between the IOP reported by the Tono-Pen and actual IOP was established, IOP measurements were obtained in slightly sedated adult rats. Effects of glaucoma medications were tested in two groups of animals. One group (12 h/L) was housed in a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle. The other (24 h/L) was housed under constant light. Exposure of the animals to constant light increased their basal IOP from 20.5+/-0.6 mmHg (mean+/-S.E.M., n=12) to 32.0+/-0.5 mmHg. At 3 h after topical administration, Betoptic S lowered IOP by 4.3+/-1.7 mmHg (n=6) and 3.7+/-0.3 mmHg (n=6) in the 12 and 24h/L rats, respectively. Pilocarpine did not affect rat IOP. Xalatan produced a biphasic response in the rat. At 3h after topical administration, it increased IOP by 7.9+/-1.4 and 7.0+/-1.0 mmHg in the 12 and 24 h/L rats, respectively. By the next day, it decreased IOP by 3.0+/-1.0 and 6.0+/-0.8 mmHg in the 12 and 24 h/L rats, respectively. The IOP-enhancing effect of Xalatan was dose-dependent. The present study indicates that IOP responses of the rat to different pharmacological agents are not identical to those of the human. In the rat, Betoptic S, but not pilocarpine, lowered IOP. Xalatan initially increased then decreased IOP.", 
    "100": "Carvedilol is a beta-adrenoceptor blocker and a potent antioxidant that improves cardiac function in patients with heart failure. The restoration of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2) gene expression may be an underlying mechanism of its beneficial effects on cardiac function. In primary cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, treatment with either carvedilol or its beta-receptor inactive metabolite, BM910228, attenuated the hydrogen peroxide-mediated decrease in SERCA2 mRNA and protein levels, while metoprolol, a pure beta-blocker, had no effect. Moreover, carvedilol itself significantly enhanced SERCA2 gene transcription, suggesting that carvedilol specifically restores SERCA2 gene transcription. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that two Sp1 sites in the SERCA2 gene promoter region mediated the response to carvedilol under oxidative stress. Further, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors correlated with carvedilol-mediated changes in the promoter assays. These studies may provide a mechanistic explanation for the beneficial effects of carvedilol in heart failure.",

We estimated the projected benefit of a secondary prevention \"poly-portfolio\" strategy, including pharmacologic and lifestyle approaches for those with coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke. Based on recent clinical trial results and clinical guidelines, combinations of a high-dose statin, low to standard doses of antihypertensive therapy, aspirin, omega-3 fish oil, cardiac rehabilitation, and diet were evaluated. Patients with CHD, post-myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke were projected to experience 84%, 91%, and 77% reductions, respectively, in CHD events from a pharmacologic approach. Numbers of those needed to treat (NNT) for 5 years were 9 to 11 to prevent 1 CHD event, and 21 to prevent 1 stroke. Post-MI patients were projected to experience a 93% reduction in the risk of CHD death (NNT 16) from a pharmacologic approach and a 97% reduction in the risk of CHD death (NNT 15) with the addition of lifestyle changes. A secondary prevention polyportfolio holds great promise for reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease in the highest risk patients.", 
    "102": "We investigated whether ranolazine therapy improves exercise-induced angina pectoris and myocardial ischemia compared with placebo or with standard doses of atenolol in patients who had chronic angina and evaluated the effects on hemodynamics at rest and during exercise. In this trial, 158 patients who had symptom-limited exercise discontinued beta-blocker therapy and were randomized into a double-blind, 3-period, crossover study of 400 mg of immediate-release ranolazine 3 times daily, 100 mg/day of atenolol, or placebo, each administered for 1 week. Exercise tests were administered at the end of each treatment period. Therapy with ranolazine or atenolol produced statistically significant improvement in all 3 exercise end points compared with placebo. Compared with atenolol therapy, ranolazine therapy resulted in significantly longer total exercise duration and was statistically indistinguishable from atenolol for time to onset of angina and ST-segment depression. Except for a modest increase in systolic blood pressure at peak exercise during ranolazine therapy, hemodynamic measurements did not differ significantly during ranolazine and placebo therapies. In contrast, atenolol significantly decreased blood pressure, heart rate, and rate-pressure product at rest and during exercise compared with placebo or ranolazine. In conclusion, ranolazine therapy prolonged exercise duration and decreased exercise-induced ischemia and angina with quantitative effects equal to or greater than those with atenolol. Unlike atenolol, the anti-ischemic and antianginal effects of ranolazine occurred without decreases in blood pressure, heart rate, or rate-pressure product.", 
    "103": "We report a case of severe lichenoid drug eruption with multiple possible causative agents. A hepatitis C-positive male presented with a short history of painful erosions of the vermilion, lichenoid lesions on the buccal mucosa and glans penis, and erosions and lichenification of the scrotum. In addition, he had a pruritic polymorphic eruption over the scalp, trunk and limbs, comprising psoriasiform and eczematous lesions. He had received combination therapy of pegylated interferon-alpha-2a and ribavirin, along with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for interferon-induced leucopenia, and propranolol for portal hypertension. The former three agents were ceased 3 weeks prior to presentation, but he remained on propranolol at the initial dermatology consultation. The polymorphous clinical picture was consistent with lichenoid drug eruption, which was confirmed on histology. The papulosquamous eruption responded quickly to 2 weeks of oral prednisone 25 mg daily, which was tapered to 1 mg over 3 months and then ceased. The mucosal lesions were slow to improve and required the addition of tacrolimus 0.03% solution t.d.s. for complete resolution.", 
    "104": "Despite recommendations from various learned establishments, there are strong reservations regarding betablockers, which have been contra-indicated in chronic cardiac failure for a long time. Several published enquiries have found a low prescription rate for betablockers. We performed an enquiry into the apparent modes of betablocker prescription in chronic cardiac failure. Questionnaires were sent to all the cardiologists in France, and 1622 were analysed. The dosage used, reasons for non-prescription, modes of repeat prescription, and the influence of the response to treatment were analysed. This enquiry shows that although the advantage of betablockers is acknowledged, there is still a block to their use.", 
    "105": "The general profile of women with cardiac failure differs from that of the male population, especially with respect to aetiology and prognosis. Women are often older, have preserved systolic function more often and a higher incidence of risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Moreover, global mortality is lower in women. From the therapeutic point of view, women with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction probably benefit from ACE inhibitors but those with asymptomatic dysfunction have no reduction in mortality with this class of drugs. In addition, treatment with ACE inhibitors is usually interrupted in women because of a higher incidence of secondary effects. The poorer tolerance could be explained by the profile of women with cardiac failure. The large scale multicentre trials with betablockers included very few women. In MERIT-HF, in which there was a large number of women (23%), the female subgroup was the only one in which a benefit in mortality was not demonstrated. However, a retrospective analysis of the data of this subgroup plus a meta-analysis of all trials with betablockers does show improved mortality with this class of drugs in women. In a retrospective study of the DIG study, there seems to be a difference in the effects of digoxin between men and women; the prescription of digoxin is associated with a higher overall mortality in women. Finally, women seem to require diuretics more often than do men. There are many explanations for the differences observed in therapeutic responses between men and women. The role of sex hormones is often evoked, although it has never been clinically proved. The treatment of heart failure in women should take clinical and biological factors specific to women into account and may explain the relative inefficacy of certain forms of treatment.", 
    "106": "In Europe, 20% of the populations is over 65 years of age. About 5% of the older adults have heart failure. Heart failure (HF) in the elderly is an increasing public health problem, leading cause of hospitalization in older patients and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Prognosis has improved only slightly during the past decade. Typically, heart failure occurs when ventricles do not fill (diastolic heart failure - DHF) or empty blood (systolic heart failure - SHF) properly. Transthoracic echocardiography is the key investigation to confirm the underlying structural and functional abnormalities of the heart. Patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction should be treated with a diuretic, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and a beta-blocker (unless contraindicated). Several epidemiologic studies have recently shown that more than 50% of older patients who present with symptoms of HF have DHF. While numerous large trials have established specific therapies for SHF, such trials are lacking for DHF. The finding of similar key pathophysiologic abnormalities in DHF and SHF suggests the possibility that therapies that have been successful for SHF may have a role in therapy for DHF. A recent survey showed that despite physicians' awareness of the benefits of beta-blocker therapy, only minority of patients with heart failure are treated with beta-blocker or combination of ACE inhibitors and beta-blocker.",

Compared with MI rats without therapy, MI rats treated with each single drug showed significant attenuation of mRNA expressions of cardiac molecule genes (P < 0.01); while their hemodynamic parameters were significantly improved (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), and in terms of spontaneous deaths survival rate prolonged (P < 0.05). Both half and full dosage combined treatments exerted more powerful effects on improvement of cardiac phenotypic changes and on attenuation of betaMHC, BNP mRNA expressions (P < 0.05 vs monotherapy); while LVEDP was further lowered (P < 0.05 vs monotherapy).

The mixed solution of N + E or X + E were titrated to maintain mean arterial blood pressure between 70 and 80 mmHg following anesthesia induction. The variables of hemodynamics, arterial blood lactate content (Lac) and gastric intramucosal partial pressure of carbon dioxide were measured at the following time points: after induction of anesthesia (T1), pre-revascularization (T2), grafting of left anterior descending (T3), right coronary descending (T4) and left coronary circumflexus branches (T5), post-revascularization (T6), the end of operation (T7).

Objectives for preventive treatment include limiting future pain and disability and potentially modulating the course of disease progression. Many factors influence medication choice for patients such as migraine type, patient preference, co-existing conditions, and medication side effects. In this paper, frequently prescribed treatment options for migraine prevention are reviewed. Most headache preventive medications treat other medical disorders and are found serendipitously to be beneficial in migraine or other headache disorders. A new treatment option is topiramate, with proven safety and efficacy across the largest controlled migraine prevention trials conducted to date. New clinical information is enhancing patient care and enabling clinicians to ease the burden of migraine worldwide.",

    "122": "Perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI) is one of the most important predictors of short- and long-term morbidity and mortality associated with non-cardiac surgery. Prevention of a PMI is thus a prerequisite for an improvement in overall postoperative outcome. The aetiology of PMI is multifactorial. The perioperative period induces large, unpredictable and unphysiological alterations in coronary plaque morphology, function and progression, and may trigger a mismatch of myocardial oxygen supply and demand. With many diverse factors involved, it is unlikely that one single intervention will successfully improve cardiac outcome following non-cardiac surgery. A multifactorial, step-wise approach is indicated. Based on increasing knowledge of the nature of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, and in view of the poor positive predictive value of non-invasive cardiac stress tests, and the considerable risk of coronary angiography and coronary revascularization in high-risk patients, the paradigm is shifting from an emphasis on extensive non-invasive preoperative risk stratification to a combination of selective non-invasive testing and aggressive pharmacological perioperative therapy. Perioperative plaque stabilization by pharmacological means may be as important in the prevention of PMI as an increase in myocardial oxygen supply or a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand.", 
    "123": "Surgery is imperative for cancer treatment, but was suggested to suppress immunity and facilitate metastasis. Here we study the involvement of catecholamines and prostaglandins (PG) in such outcomes, and the role played by marginating-pulmonary (MP)-NK cells in controlling MADB106 metastasis. Non-operated and laparotomized F344 rats were injected postoperatively with a PG synthesis inhibitor (indomethacin, 4 mg/kg i.p.), a beta-blocker (nadolol, 0.6 mg/kg s.c.), both drugs, or vehicle. Rats were then inoculated intravenously with non-immunogenic syngeneic MADB106 cells, and 24 h later lung tumor retention was assessed, or 3 weeks later lung metastases were counted. Additionally, 12 h after surgery we harvested MP-NK cells and circulating-NK cells and compared their numbers and cytotoxicity against MADB106 cells and standard YAC-1 target cells. Surgery significantly increased MADB106 metastasis. Nadolol and indomethacin reduced this effect by approximately 50% when used alone, and significantly more (75%) when used together. Only MP-leukocytes exhibited NK cytotoxicity against MADB106 cells. Surgery markedly suppressed it, and nadolol and indomethacin additively restored it. Similar effects were observed assessing MP-NK and circulating-NK cytotoxicity against YAC-1 target cells. Alterations in the numbers of NK cells were partly associated with alterations in total MP-NK activity, but not with circulating-NK activity. Last, administrating nai ve rats with physiologically relevant doses of a beta-adrenergic agonist (metaproterenol), and/or with PGE2, additively and independently of each other promoted MADB106 metastasis, simulating the effects of surgery. These findings point at potential prophylactic measures in cancer patients undergoing surgery, and suggest a role for MP-NK cells in resisting metastasis of apparently insensitive tumors.", 
    "124": "The role of peripheral serotonin (5HT) 2A and 5HT1A receptors on the orofacial nocifensive behavioral activities evoked by the injection of formalin into the masseter muscle was evaluated in the rats with persistent temporomandibular joint (TMJ) inflammation evoked by Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). The orofacial nocifensive behavioral activities evoked by the injection of formalin into masseter muscle were significantly enhanced at 1 day (CFA day 1 group) or 7 days (CFA day 7 group) during TMJ inflammation. Pretreatment with local administration of 5HT2A receptor antagonist, ketanserin (0.01, 0.1 mg/rat) into the masseter muscle or systemic administration of ketanserin via i.p. injection (1 mg/kg) reduced the orofacial nocifensive behavioral activities of the late phase evoked by formalin injection into masseter muscle on the side of TMJ inflammation (CFA day 7 group). However, local (0.001-0.1 mg/rat) or systemic (1 mg/kg) administration of 5HT1A receptor antagonist, propranolol, into masseter muscle did not produce the antinociceptive effect in CFA day 7 group. Moreover, local administration of ketanserin (0.1 mg) or propranolol (0.1 mg) into masseter muscle did not inhibit nocifensive orofacial behavior in rats without TMJ inflammation. These data suggest that persistent TMJ inflammation causes the elevation of the orofacial nocifensive behavior, and peripheral 5HT2A receptors play an important role in mediating the deep craniofacial tissue nociception in rats with TMJ inflammation.", 
    "125": "A simple, specific and sensitive reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method with UV absorbance detection was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of quinidine, verapamil and passive permeability markers, in samples obtained from rat intestinal in situ single-pass perfusion studies. Chromatography was carried out on C18 column with mobile phase comprising of acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and methanol in the ratio of 40:60 (v/v) pumped at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min and UV detection was employed at 230 and 275 nm. The average retention times for hydrochlorthiazide, frusemide, quinidine, propranolol, and verapamil were 4.9, 5.8, 6.9, 8.9 and 11.3 min, respectively. The calibration curves were linear (R(2)>0.9995) in the selected range for each analyte. The method is specific and sensitive with limit of quantification as 25 ng/ml for quinidine and verapamil. The intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision were found to be good for all the five analytes. The method was found to be reliable in permeability determination and to estimate pH-dependent P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux transport of quinidine. Weak bases quinidine, propranolol and verapamil showed pH-dependent permeability, where quinidine permeability increased by 3.6-fold when the luminal pH was changed from pH 4.5-7.4. Inhibition of P-gp by verapamil (200 microM) indicated that about 68% and only 35% of passive transport of quinidine was attenuated by P-gp-mediated efflux at pH 4.5 and 7.4, respectively. In conclusion, low passive transport rates of weakly basic P-gp substrates at lower pH, may lead to more accessibility of these molecules to P-gp within enterocytes thus resulting in pH-dependent functional activity of P-gp as protic drugs moves along the gastrointestinal tract.", 
    "126": "Voltage-gated sodium channels with \"resurgent\" kinetics are specialized for high-frequency firing. The alpha subunits interact with a blocking protein that binds open channels upon depolarization and unbinds upon repolarization, producing resurgent sodium current. By limiting classical inactivation, the cycle of block and unblock shortens refractory periods. To characterize the blocker in Purkinje neurons, we briefly exposed inside-out patches to substrate-specific proteases. Trypsin and chymotrypsin each removed resurgent current, consistent with established roles for positively charged and hydrophobic/aromatic groups in blocking sodium channels. In Purkinje cells, the only known sodium channel-associated subunit that has a cytoplasmic sequence with several positive charges and clustered hydrophobic/aromatic residues is beta4 (KKLITFILKKTREK; beta4(154-167)). After enzymatic removal of block, beta4(154-167) fully reconstituted resurgent current, whereas scrambled or point-mutated peptides were ineffective. In CA3 pyramidal neurons, which lack beta4 and endogenous block, beta4(154-167) generated resurgent current. Thus, beta4 may be the endogenous open-channel blocker responsible for resurgent kinetics.", 
    "127": "Some TTX-sensitive sodium channels open transiently during recovery from inactivation, generating a \"resurgent\" sodium current that flows immediately following action potentials. In this issue of Neuron, Grieco and colleagues present evidence that resurgent sodium current results from a novel form of inactivation in which the cytoplasmic tail of the beta4 subunit acts as a classic open-channel blocker.", 
    "128": "In the present study chitosan (REVTMbio1) or Carbopol (REVTMbio2 and 3) coated niosomal timolol maleate (0.25%) formulations were prepared by reverse phase evaporation (REV) and compared to timolol solution (TMS; 0.25%) in terms of in vitro release and IOP lowering pharmacodynamic effect. The in vitro release phase of timolol (91% release in 2 h) was extended significantly by its incorporation into niosomes and further by the polymer coating (40-43% release upto 10 h). The developed formulations were evaluated for their pharmacodynamics in albino rabbits, by measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) using a non-contact pneumatonometer, and were compared to a marketed in situ gel forming solution of timolol (Timolet GFS, 0.5%; Sun Pharma). REVTMbio1 formulation showed a more sustained effect of upto 8h (vis a vis 6 h for carbopol-coated niosomes). TMS in comparison showed effect for only 2 h though the peak effect was slightly more (14%). Lowering of IOP in the contralateral eye (20-40% as compared to 100% in case of TMS), considerably reduces with REV and REVbio formulations indicating lesser systemic side effects. Moreover, the results of REVTMbio1formulation containing 0.25% of timolol maleate compared well with the 0.5% marketed gel formulation, indicating our formulation to be significantly better considering that similar effect is obtained at half the concentration. The later becomes especially important in context to the cardiovascular side effects associated with ocular timolol maleate therapy.", 
    "129": "Glaucoma represents a major cause of vision loss throughout the world. Primary open-angle glaucoma, the most common form of glaucoma, is a chronic, progressive disease often, though not always, accompanied by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). In this disorder, retinal ganglion cell loss and excavation of the optic nerve head produce characteristic peripheral visual field deficits. Patients with normal-tension glaucoma present with typical visual field and optic nerve head changes, without a documented history of elevated IOP. A variety of secondary causes, such as pigment dispersion syndrome and ocular trauma, can result in glaucoma as well. Treatment of all forms of glaucoma consists of reducing IOP. With proper treatment, progression of this disease can often be delayed or prevented. Treatment options for glaucoma include medications, laser therapy and incisional surgery. Laser techniques for the reduction of IOP include argon laser trabeculoplasty and selective laser trabeculoplasty. Both techniques work by increasing outflow of aqueous humour through the trabecular meshwork. Surgical options for glaucoma treatment include trabeculectomy, glaucoma drainage tube implantation and ciliary body cyclodestruction. While each of these types of procedures is effective at lowering IOP, therapy usually begins with medications. Medications lower IOP either by reducing the production or by increasing the rate of outflow of aqueous humour within the eye. Currently, there are five major classes of drugs used for the treatment of glaucoma: (i) cholinergics (acetylcholine receptor agonists); (ii) adrenoceptor agonists; (iii) carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs); (iv) beta-adrenoceptor antagonists; and (v) prostaglandin analogues (PGAs). Treatment typically begins with the selection of an agent for IOP reduction. Although beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are still commonly used by many clinicians, the PGAs are playing an increasingly important role in the first-line therapy of glaucoma. Adjunctive agents, such as alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and CAIs are often effective at providing additional reduction in IOP for patients not controlled on monotherapy. As with any chronic disease, effective treatment depends on minimising the adverse effects of therapy and maximising patient compliance. The introduction of a variety of well tolerated and potent medications over the past few years now allows the clinician to choose a treatment regimen on an individual patient basis and thereby treat this disorder more effectively.", 
    "130": "The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and acceptability of trimetazidine (TMZ) in combination with hemodynamic agents (beta-blockers or long-acting nitrates) in 177 stable angina patients. In this randomized, placebo-controlled study (TACT: Trimetazidine in Angina Combination Therapy), stable angina patients resistant to nitrates or beta-blockers were selected. After a 1-week selection period (W0), patients who had a difference of <10% in duration between 2 positive exercise tests, defined as 1-mm ST-segment depression (STD) 80 milliseconds after J point with angina pain or 1.5 mm without pain were randomly treated with TMZ (20 mg t.i.d., n = 90) or placebo (Pbo t.i.d., n = 87) orally. A final exercise test was performed after 12 weeks of treatment (W12). The efficacy was assessed by exercise test duration, time to 1-mm STD, time to angina onset, mean number of angina attacks, mean short-acting nitrate consumption, and rate-pressure product. Differences (W12 - W0) in these parameters were analyzed using the Student t test. All statistical tests were conducted at the 5% significance level. At inclusion and during the study, 52% of patients received long-acting nitrates, and 48% were treated with a beta-blocker as monotherapy. At the beginning of the study, the TMZ and Pbo groups were statistically homogeneous with respect to all analyzed characteristics (demographic characteristics, characteristics of anamnesis, characteristics used for evaluation of antianginal therapy efficacy). For various reasons, 11 patients (7 from the Pbo group and 4 from the TMZ group) were excluded from the trial. A total of 166 patients (80 from the Pbo group and 86 from the TMZ group) completed the study in full compliance with the protocol. After 12 weeks of therapy, exercise test duration increased from 417.7 +/- 14.2 (W0) to 506.8 +/- 17.7 seconds (W12) in the TMZ group versus 435.3 +/- 14.8 (W0) to 458.9 +/- 16.2 seconds (W12) in the Pbo group (P < 0.05). Time to 1-mm STD increased from 389.0 +/- 15.3 (W0) to 479.6 +/- 18.6 seconds (W12) in the TMZ group versus 411.8 +/- 15.2 (W0) to 428.5 +/- 17.3 seconds (W12) in the Pbo group (P < 0.05). Time to onset of anginal pain increased from 417.0 +/- 16.9 (W0) to 517.3 +/- 21.0 seconds (W12) in the TMZ group versus 415.1 +/- 16.5 (W0) to 436.4 +/- 18.5 seconds (W12) in the Pbo group (P < 0.005). The mean number of anginal attacks per week decreased from 5.6 +/- 0.6 to 2.7 +/- 0.5 in the TMZ group versus 6.8 +/- 0.7 to 5.1 +/- 0.7 in the Pbo group (P < 0.05), mean consumption short-acting nitrates per week decreased from 5.2 +/- 0.9 to 2.8 +/- 0.8 in the TMZ group versus 5.5 +/- 0.8 to 4.1 +/- 0.9 in the Pbo group (NS). No change in the rate-pressure product was seen in both. The combination of trimetazidine with beta-blockers or long-acting nitrates significantly improves exercise stress test parameters and angina symptoms compared with placebo. Due to its metabolic effect, free of any hemodynamic action, trimetazidine has proven to be beneficial for combination in patients with stable angina.", 
    "131": "The aim of the study was to compare the results of tear film volume, conjunctival and corneal state of children eyes both treated with beta-blocker and healthy ones. We have examined 40 eyes of 20 children at the age from 7 to 17 years. Group I - 20 glaucomatous eyes treated with 0.5% timolol twice daily during at least 12 months. Group II - 20 eyes of control age-matched group. Schirmer I test without anesthesia and lissamine green staining was performed to evaluate conjunctival and corneal surface. The values of Schirmer I test were: group I from 12 to 24 mm, the mean 17.06 +/- 1.78 mm and group II from 16 to 35 mm, the mean 29.3 +/- 2.67, p = 0.000004. Keratoepitheliopathy was observed in 4 eyes (20%) of group I and was rated as 3rd and 6th degree of Franck classification. In the group II, there were only single staining points classified as 1st degree noticed in 2 eyes (10%), p = 0.37. The long-term treatment with timolol causes a decrease in tear secretion in children, which can further generate keratoepiteliopathy. Therefore, we suggest application of the artificial tears in these patients.", 
    "132": "Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS2) deletion in mice prolongs signaling by G protein-coupled vasoconstrictor receptors and increases blood pressure. However, the exact mechanism of the increase in blood pressure is unknown. To address this question we tested autonomic nervous system function and blood pressure regulation in RGS2-deficient mice (RGS2-/-). We measured arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) with telemetry, computed time and frequency-domain measures for blood pressure and HR variability (HRV) as well as baroreflex sensitivity [BRS-low frequency (LF)], and assessed environmental stress sensitivity. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was approximately 10 mmHg higher in RGS2-/-compared with RGS2+/+mice, while HR was not different between the groups, indicating a resetting of the baroreceptor reflex. Atropine increased MAP more in RGS2-/-than in RGS2+/+mice while HR responses were not different. Urinary norepinephrine excretion was higher in RGS2-/-than in RGS2+/+mice. The blood pressure decrease following prazosin was more pronounced in RGS2-/-mice than in RGS2+/+mice. The LF and high-frequency (HF) power of HRV were reduced in RGS2-/-compared with controls while BRS-LF and SBP-LF were not different. Atropine and atropine+metoprolol markedly reduced the HRV parameters in the time (RMSSD) and frequency domain (LF, HF, LF/HF) in both strains. Environmental stress sensitivity was increased in RGS2-/-mice compared with controls. We conclude that the increase in blood pressure in RGS2-/-mice is not solely explained by peripheral vascular mechanisms. A central nervous system mechanism might be implicated by an increased sympathetic tone. This state of affairs could lead to a baroreceptor-HR reflex resetting, while BRS remains unimpaired.", 
    "133": "The activation of presynaptic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is widely reported to inhibit transmitter release; however, the lack of accessibility of many presynaptic terminals has limited direct analysis of signalling mediators. We studied GPCR-mediated inhibition of fast cholinergic transmission between superior cervical ganglion neurones (SCGNs) in culture. The adrenoceptor agonist noradrenaline (NA) caused a dose-related reduction in evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). NA-induced EPSP decrease was accompanied by effects on the presynaptic action potential (AP), reducing AP duration and amplitude of the after-hyperpolarization (AHP), without affecting the pre- and postsynaptic membrane potential. All effects of NA were blocked by yohimbine and synaptic transmission was reduced by clonidine, consistent with an action at presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors. NA-induced inhibition of transmission was sensitive to pre-incubation of SCGNs with pertussis toxin (PTX), implicating the involvement of Galpha(i/o)betagamma subunits. Expression of Galpha transducin, an agent which sequesters G protein betagamma (Gbetagamma) subunits, in the presynaptic neurone caused a time-dependent attenuation of NA-induced inhibition. Injection of purified Gbetagamma subunits into the presynaptic neurone inhibited transmission, and also reduced the AHP amplitude. Furthermore, NA-induced inhibition was occluded by pre-injection of Gbetagamma subunits. The Ca(2+) channel blocker Cd(2+) mimicked NA effects on transmitter release. Cd(2+), NA and Gbetagamma subunits also inhibited somatic Ca(2+) current. In contrast to effects on AP-evoked transmitter release, NA had no clear action on AP-independent EPSPs induced by hypertonic solutions. These results demonstrate that Gbetagamma subunits functionally mediate inhibition of transmitter release by alpha2-adrenoceptors and represent important regulators of synaptic transmission at mammalian presynaptic terminals.", 
    "134": "We describe a patient with nonsignificant coronary artery disease who experienced variant angina after beta -blockade withdrawal. Standard therapy with nifedipine and nitrates aimed at suppressing symptoms and typical transient ST-segment elevations was superseded by the reinstitution of metoprolol. The autonomic alternations before and after readministration of metoprolol were analyzed by time and spectral indices of heart rate variability (HRV). Metoprolol reduced the HRV and reversed the low-frequency/high-frequency power ratio toward a more physiological autonomic balance. We conclude that the reinstitution of beta -blocker acted protectively by preventing surges of sympathetic activity on an underlying basis of parasympathetic predominance.",

    "143": "We have recently shown that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and a subset of its C-terminal fragments (CTFs) are tyrosine phosphorylated in human brain and in cultured cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation generates a substrate that is sequentially bound by the adaptor proteins ShcA and Grb2, and this interaction is significantly enhanced in Alzheimer's disease brains. Here we have studied the APP/CTFs phosphorylation and ShcA activation in a human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, under basal and apoptotic conditions. To commit these cells to apoptosis, we used staurosporin, a well-known apoptotic inducer and protein kinase C blocker. Our data suggest the following: (1) in normally proliferating SH-SY5Y cells, full-length APP is complexed with Grb2[Q3], likely through its SH2 domain; (2) upon induction of apoptosis, APP is degraded and ShcA-Grb2 coimmunoprecipitates with CTFs recognized by anti-APP antibodies; and (3) caspase inhibitors partially block the degradation of APP and the coprecipitation of CTFs with ShcA-Grb2 adaptors. In summary, our data suggest that in SH-SY5Y cells, tyrosine-phosphorylated APP is involved in a complex with ShcA-Grb2 adaptors that is disrupted during apoptosis. The abnormal degradation of APP and consequent increased levels of CTFs (as has been observed in Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome) generate a complex between tyrosine-phosphorylated CTFs and intracellular adaptors. The signaling through APP and its CTFs may have significant relevance for apoptotic cell death in Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "144": "1 Cyclic AMP formation has consistently been reported to be desensitized in various tissues including heart of animal models of end-stage renal failure (ESRF). In contrast, reports on desensitization of cAMP formation in ESRF patients remain contradictory. Whether this discrepancy results from a difference between human ESRF and its animal models or from the use of circulating blood cells in the human and various solid tissues in the animal studies, remains unclear. Therefore, we performed three studies with heart and platelets of ESRF patients undergoing haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and age- and gender-matched controls with normal renal function (n = 11-13 each). 2 In platelets from haemodialysis patients adenylyl cyclase activity in response to receptor-dependent and -independent agonists was reduced by approximately 30%, and this could be explained by an alteration at the level of adenylyl cyclase itself. However, no such desensitization was seen in platelets from peritoneal dialysis patients. 3 In hearts from ESRF patients undergoing haemodialysis, beta-adrenoceptor density and subtype distribution, cAMP formation in response to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline or various receptor-independent stimuli, were very similar to those in control patients but activity of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase was increased by approximately 20%. 4 We conclude that conflicting reports on the desensitization of cAMP formation between ESRF patients and ESRF animal models are not explained by the use of solid tissues in animal studies vs. circulating blood cells in patient studies. Rather desensitization of cAMP formation seems to be a less consistent feature of human ESRF than of its animal models.", 
    "145": "Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated that beta blocker therapy improves the prognosis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), but cardiac events sometimes occur even in patients showing favourable response to the therapy. In this study, the usefulness of meta-iodobenzyguanidine (MIBG) in predicting cardiac events was investigated in DCM patients successfully receiving long-term treatment with beta blockers.", 
    "146": "The subjects were 53 patients with DCM (including 10 women; mean age, 56.5+/-10.9 years) who could continue beta blocker therapy for more than 6 months. MIBG was performed within 1 year of commencing the therapy. The extent score, severity score and washout rate were obtained from single photon emission computed tomography images. At the same time, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular end diastolic diameters were measured by echocardiography. The endpoints were cardiac events (cardiac death and admission to hospital due to heart failure or arrhythmia), and patients were observed for an average of 1314+/-986 days (150-4100 days).", 
    "147": "Cardiac events occurred in nine patients during the observation period. The multivariate statistical analysis demonstrated that the delayed extent score was the strongest significant predictive factor, (hazard ratio 1.036, P<0.01). while LVEF was not a predictive factor. Both the improvement of LVEF and MIBG were significant predictive factors. The improvement of washout rate was the strongest.", 
    "148": "Parameters of MIBG but not of LVEF were useful in predicting cardiac events in DCM patients whose condition had been successfully stabilized by the introduction of beta blockers.",

After risk stratification to identify those patients most likely to benefit from an early invasive vs early conservative strategy, a comprehensive management plan can be assembled through an \"ABCDE\" approach. The elements of this include \"A\" for antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, and angiotensin receptor blockade; \"B\" for beta-blockade and blood pressure control; \"C\" for cholesterol treatment and cigarette smoking cessation; \"D\" for diabetes management and diet; and \"E\" for exercise.",

    "155": "Increases in contraction-stimulated glucose transport in fast-twitch rat epitrochlearis muscle are mediated by AMPK- and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK)-dependent signaling pathways. However, recent studies provide evidence suggesting that contraction-stimulated glucose transport in slow-twitch skeletal muscle is mediated through an AMPK-independent pathway. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that contraction-stimulated glucose transport in rat slow-twitch soleus muscle is mediated by an AMPK-independent/Ca2+-dependent pathway. Caffeine, a sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-releasing agent, at a concentration that does not cause muscle contractions or decreases in high-energy phosphates, led to an approximately 2-fold increase in 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake in isolated split soleus muscles. This increase in glucose transport was prevented by the SR calcium channel blocker dantrolene and the CAMK inhibitor KN93. Conversely, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), an AMPK activator, had no effect on 2-DG uptake in isolated split soleus muscles yet resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in the phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The hypoxia-induced increase in 2-DG uptake was prevented by dantrolene and KN93, whereas hypoxia-stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK was unaltered by these agents. Tetanic muscle contractions resulted in an approximately 3.5-fold increase in 2-DG uptake that was prevented by KN93, which did not prevent AMPK phosphorylation. Taken in concert, our results provide evidence that hypoxia- and contraction-stimulated glucose transport is mediated entirely through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism in rat slow-twitch muscle.", 
    "156": "The study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of long-term (6-month) therapy with the selective beta-blocker bisoprolol, the cytoprotector trimetazidine and their combination on the clinical course of disease, the morphofunctional parameters of the left ventricle (LV) and life quality in 71 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) concurrent with functional classes (FC) III-IV chronic heart failure (CHF) (ejection fraction (EF) < 35%, as evidenced by echoCG). In Groups 1, 2, and 3, basic therapy was supplemented by bisoprolol, trimetazidine, and bisoprolol plus trimetazidine, respectively. The initial dose of bisoprolol was 1.25 mg with its subsequent titration to an individually tolerable. Trimetazidine was given in a dose of 20 mg thrice daily. The patients' clinical status and echoCG were monthly assessed. There was a decrease in FC of CHD in all the groups, a reduction in LV end diastolic and systolic volumes, and an increase in shortening faction, LV EF, and an improvement of LV diastolic function. There was evidence that it should be expedient and safe to use the cytoprotector trimetazidine in the treatment of CHF in patients with CHD. In patients with CHD concurrent with CHF, therapy using a combination of bisoprolol and trimerazidine was found to have the most pronounced impact, which yielded the maximum clinical and hemodynamic effect (LV EF increased by 42.6% of the baseline values, the rate of early and late ventricular diastolic filling decreased by 59% of the baseline values). The revealed regularities of the positive effect on the clinical and hemodynamic parameters of long-use of bisoprolol, trimetazidine, and their combination in patients with CHD concurrent with FC III-IV CHF show it expedient to include these drugs and their combination into therapy for CHF that develops in the presence of CHD.", 
    "157": "Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (\"beta-blockers\") are one of the most widely used classes of drugs in cardiovascular medicine (hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and increasingly in heart failure) as well as in the management of anxiety, migraine and glaucoma. Where known, the mode of action in cardiovascular disease is from antagonism of endogenous catecholamine responses in the heart (mainly at beta1-adrenoceptors), while the worrisome side effects of bronchospasm result from airway beta2-adrenoceptor blockade. The aim of this study was to determine the selectivity of beta-antagonists for the human beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. (3)H-CGP 12177 whole cell-binding studies were undertaken in CHO cell lines stably expressing either the human beta1-, beta2- or the beta3-adrenoceptor in order to determine the affinity of ligands for each receptor subtype in the same cell background. In this study, the selectivity of well-known subtype-selective ligands was clearly demonstrated: thus, the selective beta1 antagonist CGP 20712A was 501-fold selective over beta2 and 4169-fold selective over beta3; the beta2-selective antagonist ICI 118551 was 550- and 661-fold selective over beta1 and beta3, respectively, and the selective beta3 compound CL 316243 was 10-fold selective over beta2 and more than 129-fold selective over beta1. Those beta2-adrenoceptor agonists used clinically for the treatment of asthma and COPD were beta2 selective: 29-, 61- and 2818-fold for salbutamol, terbutaline and salmeterol over beta1, respectively. There was little difference in the affinity of these ligands between beta1 and beta3 adrenoceptors. The clinically used beta-antagonists studied ranged from bisoprolol (14-fold beta1-selective) to timolol (26-fold beta2-selective). However, the majority showed little selectivity for the beta1- over the beta2-adrenoceptor, with many actually being more beta2-selective. This study shows that the beta1/beta2 selectivity of most clinically used beta-blockers is poor in intact cells, and that some compounds that are traditionally classed as \"beta1-selective\" actually have higher affinity for the beta2-adrenoceptor. There is therefore considerable potential for developing more selective beta-antagonists for clinical use and thereby reducing the side-effect profile of beta-blockers."
