    "0": "The evolution of antihypertensive drug use in the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic between 1969 and 1986 was determined, from computerized data, by extracting percentages of new patients prescribed different drugs at their first clinic visit. Prescribing of adrenergic neuron blockers and centrally acting drugs (methyldopa and clonidine) was common in the early years but declined rapidly until, after 1975 and 1980, respectively, it remained at 10% or less. Diuretics, mainly thiazides, were prescribed for 20% of patients in 1969 to a peak of 55% in 1980. beta-Blockers were first used during the early 1970s and their use peaked in 1980, when they were prescribed for over 60% of new patients. They remained a first-choice treatment in more than 40% of patients. Calcium channel blockers were first used in 1980 and by 1986 were prescribed for 15% of new patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were used from 1982 and in 1986 were prescribed for 7% of new patients. These two classes of drugs are more expensive than older drugs. However, because of their low usage, this did not greatly influence treatment costs up to 1986, as beta-blockers and thiazides remained widely used.", 
    "1": "Several large-scale, multicenter trials have been conducted to evaluate the effects of currently available calcium channel blockers on a variety of cardiac end points in patients with myocardial infarction. Results indicate that careful subgroup stratification is necessary if morbidity and mortality are to be favorably altered. Certain groups of patients who are at high risk of recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or death must be targeted for more aggressive diagnosis and therapy. Subset analysis of the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial (MDPIT) provides detailed information about diltiazem's long-term benefit following non-Q-wave or inferior Q-wave MI, and its lack of efficacy in patients with extensive or prior MI. Concerning use of beta-blockers versus calcium channel blockers as secondary prevention following acute MI, the pathogenesis, clinical course, prognosis, anatomy, and histology of non-Q-wave MI differs appreciably from Q-wave MI, and hence it is logical to assume that secondary prophylaxis post-MI should differ for non-Q-wave versus Q-wave MI. It would appear that beta-blockers (particularly those agents without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) are best suited for secondary prevention after Q-wave MI, whereas diltiazem is the only therapy of proven benefit for use after non-Q-wave MI.", 
    "2": "A large number of pharmacological trials have been carried out, attempting to reduce the mortality (10-15%) in the year following of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and/or the recurrence of ischemic events. Thrombolytic therapy and beta-blockade are the only interventions to be associated with a significant decrease in cardiac mortality. Early intervention with intravenous beta-blockers aims at limiting infarct size and at decreasing mortality. The Swedish study using intravenous (15 mg) followed by oral (200 mg/day) metoprolol showed a 36% reduction in mortality after the first week, a benefit persisting after 1 year. The combination of streptokinase and intravenous atenolol is safe and may be beneficial in selected patients. Large-scale controlled multicenter studies have shown that beta-blockers introduced within the first 3 days after acute MI significantly reduce total mortality and/or sudden death in the year following the acute event. Some of these studies demonstrate a reduction in recurrence of MI. The reduction (averaging 25%) in mortality may be explained by the anti-ischemic action of beta-blockers and the prevention of arrhythmia-induced death. Introduced early, beta-blockers may reduce the size of the initial MI as well as subsequent infarction and/or ischemia. Furthermore the antistress action of beta-blockers results in a decrease in free fatty acids, with their untoward effect in acute MI. Antiplatelet aggregation may also play a role. These properties of beta-blocking agents should be utilized in every patient with acute MI in the absence of any major contraindication. Elective indications include patients with hypertension, angina pectoris, and/or ventricular arrhythmias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "This study investigated the effects of (-)-pindolol, a putative 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, upon the central hypotensive action of the antihypertensive drug urapidil and of the purported 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) in cats. Chloralose/urethane-anesthetized cats were thoracotomized and artificially ventilated. Blood pressure was monitored in the iliac artery, and the drugs were injected into the vertebral artery. Urapidil (1-300 nmol/kg) or 8-OH-DPAT (0.01-1 nmol/kg) dose-dependently reduced blood pressure. (-)-Pindolol (30 and 100 nmol/kg) shifted the dose-response curves of both drugs significantly and in a similar manner to the right. Doses of urapidil of 30 nmol/kg or higher also reduced the elevation of blood pressure following the intravenous injection of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist cirazoline whereas 8-OH-DPAT was ineffective. Yet, the hypotensive response to the directly acting vasodilator nitroglycerin remained unchanged after urapidil. The results support the hypothesis that the centrally mediated component of the antihypertensive action of urapidil is due to stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors in the brainstem. Peripheral alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade comes into play with higher doses of the drug administered via the vertebral artery.", 
    "4": "Urapidil and three derivatives with hypotensive properties (5-acetyl-, 5-formyl-, 5-methylurapidil) bind selectively to 5-HT receptors of the 5-HT1A subtype and to alpha 1-adrenoceptors labeled by [3H]8-OH-DPAT and [3H]prazosin, respectively. Binding to these receptors is likely to contribute to their hypotensive action. 5-Methylurapidil, the most potent of these drugs, was used in its 3H-labeled form as a radioligand. After blockade of alpha 1-adrenoceptors by prazosin, [3H]5-methylurapidil binds with nanomolar affinity to a binding site that is similar to the (5-HT1A) site labeled by [3H]8-OH-DPAT. No binding to other 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors was observed. 5-HT uptake inhibitors did not inhibit [3H]5-methylurapidil binding. [3H]5-methylurapidil binding is sensitive to GTP and is modulated by divalent cations. Our results show that urapidil derivatives bind to the 5-HT1A recognition site and that [3H]5-methylurapidil is a valuable tool for the investigation of this receptor subtype.", 
    "5": "An in vivo model for the simultaneous study of the motility of the gallbladder, sphincter of Oddi and duodenal wall in the anesthetized cat was developed. Changes in gallbladder volume were recorded as well as changes in the outflow from the sphincter of Oddi and from a vein graft inserted through the duodenal wall during perfusion at constant pressure. The distribution of three peptide hormones (substance P-SP, vasoactive intestinal peptide-VIP and cholecystokinin-CCK) within the feline extrahepatic biliary tree was studied immunocytochemically. Nerve terminals with SP-like immunoreactivity (LI) were distributed to the smooth muscle layers and also to acetylcholinesterase-positive ganglions cells in the intrinsic plexa. SP-LI was further demonstrated in cell bodies of the intrinsic plexa as well as in vagal axons. VIP-LI had a similar distribution. An especially rich VIP-ergic innervation was observed within the circular muscle layer of the sphincter of Oddi. SP-LI or VIP-LI did not occur in mucosal endocrine cells. On the other hand, CCK-LI was not demonstrated in nerves but occurred regularly in endocrine cells of the duodenal mucosa. Regional administration of SP elicited dose-dependent contractile motor effects on the biliary tree, which were not dependent on muscarinic or nicotinic cholinoceptors, but were inhibited by infusion of an antagonistic SP analogue indicating a direct effect on the smooth muscle cell. Efferent electrical vagal nerve stimulation elicited contractile motor responses, which were blocked by either atropine or infusion of the SP-analogue, indicating activation of a postganglionic cholinergic neuron via intrinsic or extrinsic SP neurons. These observation correlate well with the presence of SP nerve terminals on acetylcholinesterase-positive ganglion cells of the intrinsic plexa and SP axons within the vagus. An afferent mechanism cannot be excluded; antidromic activation of SP-containing axon collaterals from vagal afferents might act on intrinsic cholinergic neurons. The cellbodies of such afferents may be present in intrinsic plexa or within the sensory vagal nodose ganglion. VIP elicited relaxatory motor responses from the extrahepatic biliary tree, not influenced by blockade of cholinoceptors or beta-adrenoceptors. Stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors, or selective stimulation of beta 2-adrenoceptors caused dose-dependent relaxatory motor responses, which were antagonized by specific blockade. Stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors following selective blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors resulted in relaxation, most probably mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "6": "Neuroendocrine hamster lung tumors, induced by exposure to 60% hyperoxia and subcutaneous administration of the tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-l-(3-pyridyl)-l-butanone (NNK) for 12 weeks, were placed in cell culture. By subsequent selective transfer of epithelial cells and maintenance in an atmosphere of 8% CO2, cell lines with characteristics of neuroendocrine cells were established. The neuroendocrine markers expressed by these cell lines included electron dense neuroendocrine secretion granules as well as secretion of calcitonin and mammalian bombesin. In keeping with data previously reported for a human neuroendocrine lung tumor cell line, nicotine, acetylcholine, and mammalian bombesin (MB) acted as strong growth factors in these neuroendocrine hamster tumor lines. The mitogenic effect of nicotine and acetylcholine was abolished by nicotinic receptor inhibition while the effects of mammalian bombesin were inhibited by an antagonist of MB receptors. Our data suggest that a receptor-mediated mitogenic effect of nicotine on neuroendocrine lung cells may be instrumental in the induction of smoking-associated small cell lung cancer.", 
    "7": "To assess the effects of intravenous isradipine (0.5 mg) on left ventricular function in patients pretreated with the beta-blocker propranolol (0.1 mg/kg i.v.), 10 patients were studied during cardiac catheterization for suspected coronary artery disease (confirmed in 6). All patients had normal ejection fractions at rest. Following propranolol, isradipine significantly reduced mean aortic pressure (baseline: 112 mm Hg; propranolol: 107 mm Hg; isradipine: 92 mm Hg) and left ventricular systolic pressure (149 vs. 144 vs. 117 mm Hg, respectively). Propranolol alone significantly decreased heart rate, which then increased after isradipine (75 vs. 66 vs. 70 beats/min, respectively). Cardiac index was depressed with propranolol but normalized with isradipine (3.8 vs. 3.0 vs. 3.7 L/min/m2, respectively) as was mean pulmonary artery pressure (16 vs. 18 vs. 16 mm Hg, respectively). Left ventricular contractility decreased significantly during beta-blocker infusion and reached baseline values with isradipine (2,270 vs. 2,080 vs. 2,320 mm Hg/s, respectively). Parallel to dP/dtmax, systolic wall tension decreased as a consequence of the reduction of left ventricular volume and afterload (1,223 vs. 1,332 vs. 905 units, respectively). It is concluded that isradipine effectively reduces cardiac afterload with no sign of intrinsic cardiodepression.", 
    "8": "The objectives of this study were (a) to evaluate the dose-response effect of isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on the heart rate and blood pressure of males with mild to moderate hypertension; and (b) to compare these results with those obtained with propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, on a matched patient population. Twenty-four patients entered a single-blind study, beginning with a 2-week washout placebo period followed by a forced-titration period. Treadmill and hand-grip tests were also performed. Two weeks were allocated to each stage of the therapy. The end point of the study was normalization of blood pressure with a minimum of side effects. Results and conclusions include the following: both drugs were effective in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), but isradipine was more effective in reducing the DBP; isometric exercise can predict accurately the results of the isotonic exercise; the maximum therapeutic effect of propranolol was achieved during the second study-dose level; increases in the isradipine dose were reflected in a proportional reduction of SBP and DBP; and the incidence of side effects is lower among isradipine-treated patients compared to propranolol-treated patients.", 
    "9": "In a recent study in which metabolic characteristics of newly detected obese and nonobese hypertensive subjects were compared with those of normotensive subjects, insulin sensitivity was decreased, fasting insulin values and insulin values after an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) were increased, and fasting and IVGTT glucose values were increased in both hypertensive groups. Furthermore, adverse alterations in lipid profile variables were found in the hypertensive groups when compared with the normotensive group. The effects of various antihypertensive agents on these metabolic variables have been assessed in prospective trials. Treatment with the beta 1-selective blocking agents metoprolol and atenolol was associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and increased fasting values of insulin and glucose. There were also indications of a suppressive effect on insulin secretion during IVGTT, as well as an increase in serum triglycerides and a decrease in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Hydrochlorothiazide treatment was associated with a decrease in insulin sensitivity and an increase in blood glucose concentrations. In addition, hydrochlorothiazide increased total cholesterol, particularly the low-density lipoprotein fraction. The calcium channel blocker diltiazem did not appear to produce any negative metabolic effects. Treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril resulted in increased insulin sensitivity with no adverse effects on lipids. All of the agents reduced blood pressure to a similar degree. These findings, and those of other studies, suggest that captopril and diltiazem offer advantages over the other agents with regard to effects on risk factors for coronary artery disease other than hypertension. Unlike diltiazem, captopril improves insulin sensitivity and this may prove to be important.", 
    "10": "The studies reported here represent a continuing search for mechanisms which may play a role in neurological disturbances resulting from brain injury. In particular, they are part of an effort to elucidate the involvement of both the serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems in the wide-spread decrease in cortical glucose utilization, interpreted as reflecting a functional depression, associated with a focal cortical lesion in the rat. Quinolinic acid, an endogenous metabolite of L-tryptophan, a neurotoxin and an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist was found to accumulate in cortical areas of a traumatized rat hemisphere in parallel with a previously demonstrated increase of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Ketanserin (20 mg/kg/day), a 5-HT2 receptor blocker ameliorated the depression of glucose utilization in traumatized brain while MK-801 (3 mg/kg, before and after lesion), an NMDA receptor blocker, had no effect. Alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, quantitated in vivo with [125I]-HEAT (iodo-2-[beta-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl-aminomethyl]tetralone), were found to be elevated in cortical areas of the lesioned hemisphere, but not in other structures.", 
    "11": "This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study compared felodipine and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) given in addition to a beta-blocker in 134 elderly hypertensive patients aged 56-79 years (mean of 66 +/- 5 years). In the felodipine-treated group (n = 57), supine blood pressure (BP) was reduced from 171 +/- 16/101 +/- 6 mm Hg at randomization to 147 +/- 12/86 +/- 6 mm Hg after 8 weeks, whereas in the HCT-treated group (n = 66), BP was reduced from 170 +/- 4/101 +/- 5 to 151 +/- 16/89 +/- 9 mm Hg. The reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was significantly greater in the felodipine than in the HCT group (p less than 0.003). In the felodipine-treated group, 87% of the patients were controlled (DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) compared with 58% in the HCT group (p less than 0.001). Reported adverse events were generally mild. Six patients withdrew from the study due to adverse events, five in the felodipine group and one in the HCT group.", 
    "12": "The efficacy of and tolerance to felodipine given as extended-release (ER) tablets once daily (o.d.) and the plain tablets twice daily (b.i.d.) were compared in this study. After a 4-week period on placebo and a beta-blocker, 102 patients who had a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the supine position greater than 95 mm Hg were randomized to treatment with felodipine ER tablets 10 mg o.d. (n = 50) or plain tablets 5 mg b.i.d. (n = 52). If the DBP was greater than 90 mm Hg after 2 weeks, the dose was doubled. The total treatment time on felodipine was 6 weeks. Blood pressure (BP) was measured 2 h after the dose and at the end of the dosing interval, i.e., 24 h after ER and 12 h after plain tablets. Both formulations reduced BP significantly (15/12 mm Hg in the ER and 13/11 mm Hg in the plain tablet group, at the end of the dosing interval). No differences in BP reduction were seen between the groups. The proportion of responders was 71% on ER and 65% on plain tablets 24 and 12 h, respectively, after dose intake, and greater than 90% in both groups, when measured 2 h after dose. Ankle swelling and flushing were the most frequently reported adverse events. Eight patients (three on ER) were withdrawn, most of them due to vasodilatory side effects. Felodipine ER once daily was as effective and tolerable as plain tablets b.i.d.", 
    "13": "In a multicenter study comprising 23 Swedish primary health care centers, felodipine extended-release (ER) tablets in doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg were compared double-blind with placebo when given in addition to metoprolol controlled-release (CR) tablets 100 mg. All medication was given once daily in the morning. Altogether, 251 hypertensive patients with a diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg after 4 weeks of treatment with placebo in combination with metoprolol CR 100 mg were randomized to four parallel groups. After 4 weeks of treatment, there were significantly greater reductions in blood pressure with all doses of felodipine ER than with placebo, both 2 and 24 h after intake of the tablets. Twelve patients were withdrawn because of adverse reactions. Of these, one patient was taking placebo, one 5 mg of felodipine ER, four 10 mg of felodipine ER, and six patients 20 mg of felodipine ER. When combined with metoprolol, 5 mg of felodipine ER seemed to be less effective than higher doses, but was very well tolerated. Adding 10 mg of felodipine ER to the basal metoprolol appeared to be optimal if both the effect and adverse reactions were taken into consideration.", 
    "14": "Calcium antagonists demonstrate a close relationship between plasma drug level and effect on blood pressure (BP). Thus, the intensity and duration of action can be influenced by dose and disposition. Felodipine has a dose-related effect on diastolic BP whether given alone or with a beta-blocker. The latter combination reduces adverse effects and improves tolerability, particularly at higher (20 mg/day) doses of felodipine. Felodipine 5 or 10 mg/day in an extended release formulation could be predicted to lower BP throughout a 24-h period. The results of formal prospective clinical trials confirm the predictions and indicate that felodipine can be used as a once-daily agent in essential hypertension.", 
    "15": "Hypertensive patients who had previously taken part in double-blind, controlled studies were treated with open-label felodipine for 1 year: 377 had felodipine added to a beta-blocker and 94 were receiving monotherapy. In the first group, supine blood pressure (BP), measured at the beginning of the double-blind period, was reduced from 172 +/- 23/107 +/- 8 to 140 +/- 20/86 +/- 8 mm Hg at the end of 1 year of therapy. In the monotherapy group, BP was reduced from 170 +/- 22/101 +/- 7 mm Hg measured before treatment to 149 +/- 17/90 +/- 9 mm Hg after 1 year. The most common adverse experiences that led to withdrawal were peripheral edema, headache, flushing, and dizziness. No development of tolerance was noted.", 
    "16": "Isatin (Tribulin) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both MAO A and MAO B in broken cell preparations from rat brain and pineal. However, isatin administered in vivo (80-160 mg/kg) to the intact animal significantly increased brain, but not pineal, serotonin and did not affect 5HIAA or other indoles in either brain or pineal. Further, in vivo administration did not produce detectable MAO inhibition in either tissue. In pineal organ culture, addition of isatin up to 1mM had no influence on the concentrations of pineal indoles or the activities of monoamine oxidase or serotonin N-acetyltransferase. However, the diazepam augmentation of beta adrenergic induction of serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity was blocked by isatin. The results of these studies call into question the proposed role of isatin as an endogenous monoamine oxidase inhibitor but support a possible role as a benzodiazepine receptor blocker.", 
    "17": "Quinapril, when given as initial monotherapy or in addition to diuretics, was extensively evaluated in patients with moderate to severe hypertension, defined as sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 105 mm Hg with concomitant diuretic therapy or greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg during placebo baseline. In four double-blind, comparative trials and a subset analysis from a placebo-controlled study, 368 patients were treated with quinapril, and 338 patients were treated with comparative therapies (i.e., captopril, enalapril, or placebo). In three studies, quinapril was given in addition to diuretics, and in one study nonresponders received optional atenolol. Two studies assessed quinapril as first-line monotherapy, with nonresponders receiving hydrochlorothiazide in one study. Quinapril dosages ranged from 10 to 40 mg/day, with some patients receiving up to 80 mg/day. Quinapril effectively reduced blood pressure in patients with moderate to severe hypertension either as first-line monotherapy or when given concomitantly with a diuretic or a beta-blocker. Quinapril was comparable in efficacy to enalapril, and in several analyses quinapril was significantly more efficacious than captopril (p less than 0.05). Quinapril was well tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events was comparable with or less than that of captopril or enalapril.", 
    "18": "The binding site for an open-channel blocker, QX-222, at mouse muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors was probed using site-directed mutagenesis, oocyte expression, and electrophysiological analysis. The proposed cytoplasmic end of the M2 transmembrane helix is termed position 1'. At position 10' (alpha S252, beta T263, gamma A261, delta A266), Ala residues yield stronger and longer binding of QX-222 than Ser or Thr residues. These effects are opposite and roughly equal (30%-50% per mutation) to previously reported effects at position 6'. The polar end of an anesthetic molecule seems to bind to the position 6' OH groups, which provide a water-like region; the nonpolar moiety is near position 10' and binds more strongly in a nonpolar environment. Interactions with adjacent OH-rich turns of an amphiphilic helix may explain the widespread blocking effects of local anesthetics at the conduction pore of ion channels.", 
    "19": "A thirty-five-year-old woman without organic heart disease who has exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias suppressed by propranolol and diltiazem is reported. Treadmill exercise provoked reproducibly nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and salvos of ventricular premature contraction (VPC). QRS morphology of these ventricular arrhythmias showed left bundle branch block pattern and right axis deviation. Oral propranolol (20 mg) and diltiazem (90 mg) prevented exercise provocation of NSVT and VPC. However, oral mexiletine (200 mg) and procainamide (500 mg) could not prevent exercise provocation of these ventricular arrhythmias. No ventricular arrhythmias could be induced by any form of ventricular extrastimulations. Right ventricular pacing at a rate of 210 beats/minute provoked NSVT of which the QRS morphology was similar to that of exercise-induced NSVT. Triggered activity may be a possible electrophysiologic mechanism for exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias in this patient, although other mechanisms such as reentry and enhanced automaticity could not be completely excluded.", 
    "20": "The effects of electrical stimulation of the left splanchnic nerve on insulin, somatostatin, and glucagon secretion from the isolated perfused rat pancreas were investigated. Electrical splanchnic nerve stimulation (SNS), performed by square-wave impulses, produced a 25% decrease in effluent flow and a 10-fold increase in perfusate norepinephrine. Both insulin and somatostatin output in the presence of 16.7 mM glucose were inhibited during SNS by 85 and 56% of the basal value, respectively. Glucagon output in the presence of 5.5 mM glucose was stimulated 20-fold by SNS. Perfusion with 10(-6) M propranolol further decreased insulin and somatostatin output during SNS, when expressed as the total decrement beneath basal during stimulation. The glucagon response to SNS tended to be enhanced, although not significantly, by simultaneous infusion of 10(-6) M propranolol. However, 10(-6) M phentolamine (Phe) attenuated the SNS-induced inhibition of insulin and somatostatin output by 50 and 40%, respectively. However, insulin output remained decreased after SNS with Phe. The SNS-induced glucagon response was completely abolished by 10(-6) M Phe alone or by 10(-6) M Phe plus 10(-6) M propranolol. With 10(-6) M Phe plus 10(-6) M propranolol, insulin and somatostatin output remained decreased after SNS. These results suggest that insulin and somatostatin secretions induced by glucose are inhibited during SNS through the alpha-adrenergic mechanism and also that the beta-adrenergic mechanism exerts a stimulatory action. SNS-induced glucagon secretion occurs mainly through alpha-adrenergic activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "Human tracheal epithelial cells in suspension, whether obtained by brushing at bronchoscopy or from necropsy specimens by proteolytic digestion and EDTA treatment, increase adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production in response to isoproterenol. These cells in primary culture also respond to beta-adrenergic agonists in order of potency isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. The response is inhibited by propranolol or ICI 118551 (a beta 2-adrenergic selective blocker) but not by atenolol (a beta 1-adrenergic blocker). Binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) to membranes was rapid, stereoselective, and saturable and displayed receptor density 8.0 +/- 4.6 fmol/mg protein (mean 228 receptors/cell) and a dissociation constant (KD) for ICYP of 35 +/- 14 pM for freshly isolated cells and a KD of 25 +/- 13 pM and receptor density of 17 +/- 17 fmol/mg protein for cells in culture. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for atenolol was 470 microM and for ICI 118551 was 0.012 microM. Analysis of the ICI 118551 displacement curve indicates that greater than 90% of the receptors are of the beta 2-adrenergic class. Prostaglandins E1 or E2, vasoactive intestinal peptide, carbachol, phenylephrine, or platelet-activating factor did not affect either the maximal cAMP response or the isoproterenol dose-response relationship. Neither clonidine nor epinephrine plus propranolol altered cellular cAMP content, and cyclooxygenase inhibition did not change the cAMP response to epinephrine. We conclude that in human tracheal epithelial cells in primary culture, adrenergic stimulation affects cAMP levels only through beta 2-adrenergic receptors and that modulation of this system by platelet-activating factor or muscarinic, alpha 1-, or alpha 2-adrenergic agents does not occur.", 
    "22": "We used isolated rat hearts subjected to coronary artery ligation and reperfusion to study the antiarrhythmic activity of 5-hydroxypropafenone (5OHP) and N-depropylpropafenone (NDPP), major metabolites of propafenone (P) in humans, and of the two enantiomers (R)- and (S)-propafenone. 5OHP suppressed reperfusion arrhythmias similar to the parent drug in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentration of 5OHP needed to prevent ventricular fibrillation in 50% of experiments (EC50) was significantly higher than that of P (0.186 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.153 +/- 0.005 mg/L, mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05). 5OHP had a relative potency of 80% compared to P. When 5OHP and P were administered together, their antiarrhythmic effect appeared to be supra-additive. The NDPP metabolite showed very little antiarrhythmic potency and was about four times less active than P. The two enantiomers (R) and (S) were equipotent and showed antiarrhythmic activities similar to racemic P.", 
    "23": "The hypokalaemic response to adrenaline and the involvement of beta-adrenoceptors and Na(+)-K+ pumps were investigated in control rabbits and animals chronically pretreated with adrenaline. The hypokalaemic response to acute intravenous infusion of adrenaline was significantly reduced when rabbits were chronically pretreated with adrenaline for 10 days. Chronic pretreatment of rabbits with adrenaline significantly reduced the densities for [125I]cyanopindolol and [3H]ouabain binding sites in skeletal muscle and heart. Furthermore, there was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.97, p less than 0.001) between the Bmax for ICYP and [3H]ouabain, in the rabbit heart. Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake and the activity of 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate phosphatase were used to assess the function of the Na(+)-K+ pump in skeletal and cardiac muscle. There was no significant difference in these functional indices of the Na(+)-K+ pump between the control and adrenaline-pretreated animals, in skeletal or cardiac muscle. Thus, downregulation of the [3H]ouabain binding sites did not appear to be accompanied by reduced function of the Na(+)-K+ pump. Additional investigations are required to confirm further the dissociation between the function of the pump and the ouabain binding sites.", 
    "24": "The myocardial availability of the beta 1-selective blocker metoprolol was compared following standard intravenous (i.v.) administration and after coronary venous retroinfusion. Thirteen open-chest farm pigs were subjected to 90-min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In six of these pigs, metoprolol was administered as an i.v. injection while 7 pigs received the drug retrogradely into the coronary vein. The time of administration was 5 min. In both groups, metoprolol was administered after 30 min of coronary artery occlusion. Metoprolol did not influence heart rate (HR) or blood pressure (BP) whether administered i.v. or into the coronary vein. At the end of administration, plasma metoprolol was significantly higher when administered i.v. (2,955 +/- 543 nmol/L) than after coronary venous infusion (1,213 +/- 464 nmol/L; p less than 0.05). At 30 and 60 min after injection, plasma metoprolol did not differ significantly between the two groups. Myocardial tissue concentration of metoprolol in nonischemic myocardium was approximately 480 pmol/g for both groups and similar in the subendocardial, midmyocardial, and subepicardial layers of the myocardium. After i.v. administration, myocardial Metoprolol concentration in the ischemic zone was less than that in the nonischemic zone, averaging 150-300 pmol/g tissue. In contrast, coronary venous retroinfusion of metoprolol resulted in a substantial accumulation of the drug in the ischemic zone, as exemplified by a subendocardial concentration of 2,002 +/- 689; a midmyocardial concentration of 26,643 +/- 8,813 and a subepicardial concentration of 98,571 +/- 58,930 pmol/g, respectively (mean +/- SE). Coronary venous retroinfusion of metoprolol resulted in a pronounced accumulation of drug in the ischemic myocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "A commonly used combined intravenous (i.v.) and oral dose regimen of atenolol was evaluated in 21 patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Atenolol 5-10 mg was administered i.v. and was followed by 50 mg twice daily during the first 24 h. Starting on the second day, 100 mg was administered as a single dose. Dose adjustments were made as necessary. The i.v. dose resulted in a rapid plasma peak concentration, but absorption of the first oral dose appeared to be delayed. The half-life (t1/2) was significantly prolonged on day 2 as compared with day 6, but the tmax, Cmax, and area under the curve (AUC) were all comparable to what has been reported in patients without MI. The change in heart rate (HR) or blood pressure (BP) was not related to the initial plasma level of atenolol. The interindividual variation was large, but most patients obtained plasma levels of atenolol which in studies of other diseases have been shown to be effective.", 
    "26": "We evaluated effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist tertatolol on responses of resistance arteries to isoproterenol and phenylephrine and compared them with those of propranolol. The experiments were performed in femoral, mesenteric, and renal resistance arteries that had been isolated from adult Wistar-Kyoto rats, chemically sympathectomized and mounted for recording of contractile reactivity in vitro. In renal resistance arteries that had been pretreated with phenoxybenzamine, isoproterenol did not affect contractile responses to potassium. Under these conditions, isoproterenol induced relaxation in mesenteric resistance arteries. Low concentrations of both SR-tertatolol and SR-propranolol shifted concentration-response curves for isoproterenol to the right. Affinity for competitive beta-adrenergic antagonism did not differ between both agents. Unlike SR-propranolol, SR-tertatolol reduced maximal relaxing responses to isoproterenol. As compared with R-tertatolol, S-tertatolol was 100 times less potent as a competitive beta-adrenergic antagonist and failed to affect maximal relaxing responses to isoproterenol. In femoral, mesenteric, and renal resistance arteries preconstricted by phenylephrine, concentrations of SR-tertatolol greater than 1 microM induced relaxation. This relaxing effect did not differ between SR-tertatolol and SR-propranolol or between S-tertatolol and R-tertatolol. These data indicate that in resistance arteries tertatolol is a stereoselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist that exhibits both a competitive and a noncompetitive mechanism of action. In addition, high concentrations of tertatolol relax resistance arterial smooth muscle. This effect was neither stereoselective nor selective for the renal vascular bed and was also observed with propranolol.", 
    "27": "We present the case of a 58-year-old woman who ingested more than 35 g of caffeine in a suicide attempt. She manifested all the clinical symptoms and signs of caffeine toxicity. Esmolol, an ultrashort-acting beta 1-selective antagonist, controlled her multiple dysrhythmias and symptoms of sympathetic nervous system hyperstimulation. We suggest the use of esmolol for treatment of dysrhythmias secondary to caffeine toxicity; to the best of our knowledge, the use of esmolol has not been reported for this purpose.", 
    "28": "The effects of beta-adrenergic agonists on ATP utilization and adenine nucleotide breakdown in human adipocytes were examined. The catecholamine-induced increase in cAMP was associated with an enhancement of adenine nucleotide catabolism resulting in an increase in release of inosine and hypoxanthine which can not be reutilized for adenine nucleotide synthesis. Therefore, one-third of total cellular adenine nucleotides were irreversibly lost in the presence of 1 mumol/liter isoproterenol. The catecholamine-induced increase in purine release could be blocked by phosphodiesterase inhibitors, suggesting that cAMP is the main precursor of purines in the presence of beta-adrenergic agonists. However, epinephrine (in the simultaneous presence of the alpha 2-adrenergic blocking agent, yohimbine) and isoproterenol were 10 times more potent in stimulating purine release than in elevating cAMP. In addition, purine release ceased when cAMP was still markedly increased, suggesting a compartmentation of the cyclic nucleotide and/or involvement of the hormone-sensitive, low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase. The results document that white fat cells have an enormous potential for dissipating energy, and demonstrate that the pathway involving cAMP formation and hydrolysis constitutes the principle route of adenine nucleotide catabolism in the presence of beta-adrenergic agonists.", 
    "29": "A number of studies have addressed the response to calcium antagonists, used alone or combined with other therapy, in patients with silent myocardial ischemia (SMI). Nifedipine, the first calcium antagonist to be studied, was shown to be superior to pindolol in patients with effort angina. Although both nifedipine and diltiazem significantly reduced episodes of ST depression, compared with placebo, in patients with stable effort angina, the addition of nifedipine to diltiazem removed the beneficial effect of diltiazem in another study. Studies have shown a reduced incidence of ischemic episodes during nicardipine treatment in patients with ambulatory ischemia, predominantly SMI, and rest angina due to coronary artery spasm. Other workers similarly reported that verapamil was superior to both placebo and propranolol in reducing painful and painless ischemia in patients with angina at rest. It has been demonstrated that, compared with placebo, nifedipine reduced ischemic episodes by 50% and also markedly reduced total ischemic time in totally asymptomatic men with coronary artery disease and SMI. It was suggested that the well-documented increase in SMI occurring between 0600 and 1200 h was reduced, but not eliminated, by nifedipine. Diltiazem may also attenuate the circadian variation in SMI. Nifedipine has been shown to be particularly effective in SMI when combined with a beta-blocker. This has been substantiated in a large group of patients; both drugs reduced the number of episodes of SMI when used as monotherapy, and the combination decreased the incidence by 95%. These findings collectively indicate that calcium antagonists are effective in reducing or preventing SMI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "High-affinity uptake and localization of radiolabelled gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been examined using light microscopic autoradiography in laminar preparations and transverse paraffin sections of the rat stomach, and small and large intestine. In the presence of beta-alanine (10(-3) M), a substrate specific inhibitor of high-affinity GABA transport into glia, tritiated GABA was accumulated by a high-affinity uptake system into myenteric ganglia and a subpopulation of mucosal cells. In the small and large intestine high-affinity uptake of [3H]GABA was evident in myenteric ganglion cells, extra-ganglionic sites and in the deep muscular nerve plexus of the circular muscle layer. Such labelling could be prevented in tissue treated with the specific neuronal high-affinity uptake blocker, L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid dihydrochloride (L-DABA; 10(-3) M), and therefore represented the selective distribution of [3H]GABA uptake sites to intrinsic neuronal elements of the rat gastrointestinal tract.",

    "32": "Epidemiologic studies revealed that up to 10 percent of middle-aged men show more than 10 cessations of breathing of more than 10 seconds' duration. In these patients, increased morbidity and mortality rates have been proved. More than 50 percent of apnea patients exhibit arterial hypertension, and up to 50 percent of hypertensive patients experience sleep apnea. Patients with sleep apnea and essential hypertension need special attention paid to their antihypertensive therapy because the following side effects of drugs have to be avoided: increases of cardiac insufficiency, hyperviscosity of the blood, intensification of the hypersomnia by central sedation, intensification of a pre-existing tendency towards arrhythmias, and deprivation of deep and rapid eye movement sleep. In this study, the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with sleep apnea and hypertension are examined. An interim evaluation of six patients (aged 50 to 57) yielded the following results: Average Broca index, 124; average blood pressure before therapy, 159/102 mm Hg; average blood pressure after therapy, 132/78; a decrease of the apnea and hypopnea index from x = 31 (range, 12 to 77) to x = 20 (range, two to 54). Therapy did not influence sleep structure: before therapy, an average of 19 percent of sleep episodes were of the rapid eye movement type (range, 11 to 32 percent); after therapy, 23 percent were of this type on average (range, 21 to 25 percent). A final evaluation will be carried out after the second study phase for 12 patients who have been treated in a double-blind scheme with metropolol versus cilazapril.", 
    "33": "The hydrolytic activity of phosphatidylcholine phospholipase D in the synaptosomes from canine brain was examined using a radiochemical assay with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoryl[3H]choline as the exogenous substrate. The involvement of G protein(s) in regulation of this enzyme was demonstrated by a 2- to 3-fold stimulation of the basal activity (4.81 +/- 0.44 nmol choline released/mg protein/h) with guanosine 5'-(3-O-thiol)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), guanyl-5'-yl-(beta, gamma-methylene)diphosphonate, aluminum fluoride, or cholera toxin. The stimulation of phospholipase D hydrolytic activity by GTP gamma S was inhibited by 2 mM guanosine 5'-(2-O-thiol)diphosphate. GTP gamma S at the maximum stimulatory concentration (10 microM) had an additive effect on the maximum cholera toxin stimulation of phospholipase D activity. However, the reverse was not true, thus indicating the possibility that more than one G protein may be involved. Furthermore, cholinergic agonists, including acetylcholine, carbachol, and muscarine, were able to increase the phospholipase D hydrolytic activity at low but not maximally stimulatory concentrations of guanine nucleotide. These cholinergic stimulations were antagonized by atropine, a muscarinic blocker. In addition, O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, a protein kinase C activator, was able to stimulate the hydrolytic activity of phospholipase D more than 300% in the presence of 0.2 microM GTP gamma S. However, in the absence of GTP gamma S, stimulation was less than 60%. Our results not only indicate that the receptor-G protein-regulated phospholipase D may be directly responsible for the rapid accumulation of choline and phosphatidic acid in the central nervous system but also reveal that muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-G protein-regulated phospholipase D is a novel signal transduction process coupling the neuronal muscarinic receptor to cellular responses.",

The half-life of labetalol in the plasma of the infant was found to be approximately 24 h, i.e. substantially longer than in normal adults. The half-life of labetalol in newborn premature infants may be prolonged as compared to normal adults.

    "36": "The effect of carvediolol on the secretory function was studied using cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. Carvedilol caused the concentration-dependent inhibition of catecholamine secretion evoked by carbamylcholine, high K+ or veratridine. The drug also caused the inhibition of radioactive calcium uptake stimulated by these secretagogues into the cells, and the inhibition of calcium uptake was observed in parallel with that of catecholamine secretion. The inhibitory action of carvedilol on catecholamine secretion was shown to be similar to that caused by a classical beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol. Furthermore, although the level of carbamylcholine-stimulated catecholamine secretion inhibited by diltiazem, a potent calcium channel antagonist, was significantly raised by elevating the calcium concentration in the reaction mixture, increasing the concentration of calcium ions in the mixture failed to induce any substantial influence on the secretion inhibited by carvedilol, as well as propranolol, under the same experimental conditions. These results seem to indicate that carvedilol may cause the inhibition of catecholamine secretion through its blocking action on calcium influx into the cells, and suggest the possibility that the inhibitory action of carvedilol on calcium influx is presumably based on its stabilizing action on the plasma membranes rather than its blocking action on the calcium channels in the chromaffin cell.", 
    "37": "Activation of beta-adrenergic and somatostatin receptors increases and attenuates, respectively, cAMP. We have determined, however, that in enteric endocrine cells beta-adrenergic and somatostatin receptors also regulate Na-H exchange activity, independent of their effects on cAMP. In cells loaded with a pH-sensitive dye, epinephrine, acting at a beta 2-adrenergic receptor induced an alkalinization while somatostatin caused an acidification of intracellular pH (pHi). These pHi changes were dependent on extracellular Na+ and inhibited by amiloride. Forskolin, dibutyryl-cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP, however, had no effect on pHi. Cholera toxin, while decreasing the EC50 for epinephrine-stimulated increases in cAMP, had no effect on epinephrine-induced alkalinization, suggesting receptor coupling to Na-H exchange was not mediated by a cholera toxin-sensitive stimulatory GTP-binding protein (Gs). Additionally, epinephrine stimulated Na-H exchange in cyc- variants of S49 lymphoma cells, which lack a fundamental Gs. In the presence of pertussis toxin, somatostatin attenuation of cAMP was completely reversed; however, somatostatin inhibition of Na-H exchange was not affected. We suggest that beta-adrenergic and somatostatin receptors regulate Na-H exchange independent of changes in cAMP and possibly independent of GTP-binding proteins previously described as being coupled to these receptors.", 
    "38": "In urethane-anesthetized, artificially ventilated rats, electrical or chemical (by L-glutamate) focal stimulations of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) produced an increase in cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF). The RVLM-induced cortical vasodilative response was present in animals with spinal cords sectioned at levels of Th3-4 and with bilateral extracerebral cervical sympathetic trunks (CSTs) severed. The RVLM-induced cortical vasodilative response was totally eliminated by an alpha 2 adrenergic blocker, but not by blockers for muscarinic, nicotinic, alpha 1 and beta receptors. It was concluded that there is an intracerebral vasodilative neural pathway including an alpha 2 adrenergic receptor originating in the RVLM for regulation of cortical blood vessels.", 
    "39": "The modulation by sympathomimetic amines of the electrically evoked [3H]acetylcholine release from the motor nerve was investigated. Phenylephrine (10 mumol/l), alpha-methylnoradrenaline (10 mumol/l) and adrenaline (1 mumol/l) enhanced the electrically evoked [3H]acetylcholine release from the rat phrenic nerve. The enhancing effect of phenylephrine was completely prevented by low concentrations of prazosin (0.1 or 0.01 mumol/l) whereas a high concentration of yohimbine (1 mumol/l) was necessary to abolish the effect of phenylephrine. The simultaneous blockade of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, i.e. propranolol (0.1 mumol/l) together with prazosin (0.01 mumol/l) or yohimbine (1 mumol/l), was required to abolish the enhancing effect of alpha-methylnoradrenaline. Likewise, the enhancing effect of adrenaline could be abolished only by a combination of two antagonists (propranolol together with yohimbine or prazosin). Neither clonidine nor oxymetazoline (1 or 10 mumol/l) modulated the evoked [3H]acetylcholine release. The experiments showed the existence of alpha-adrenoceptors which are present on the motor nerve and whose stimulation mediates an increase in evoked transmitter release. The different potencies found for prazosin and yohimbine indicate that an alpha 1-subtype of the receptors was involved. Increased sympathetic activity may facilitate neuromuscular transmission by stimulation of presynaptic alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "40": "Adenylate cyclase activity was determined in alveolar macrophages (AMs) obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids of naive and antigen-challenged guinea pigs. After the anaphylactic reaction in ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs, the basal levels of cyclic AMP in AMs were significantly increased compared to the levels in naive AMS (1.87 +/- 0.22 versus 5.26 +/- 0.45 pmol cyclic AMP/5.10(6) cells). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostacyclin (DC-PGI2), histamine, isoprenaline and salbutamol stimulated adenylate cyclase activity more effectively in AMs obtained from sensitized guinea pigs after the booster injection compared to AMs obtained from non-treated animals. Moreover, DC-PGI2 and histamine, which were hardly able to induce a rise in cyclic AMP levels in naive AMs, become effective activators in AMs obtained after antigen challenge (100 and 60% increase in the response, respectively). Using selective receptor ligands, we have shown that beta 2-adrenoceptors and H2-subtype histamine receptors are functionally coupled to macrophage adenylate cyclase activity. The present data indicate that sensitization does not affect the configuration of the receptor on the outer membrane (no change in affinity constants), but affects other parts of the transmembrane signal system leading to the intracellular production of cyclic AMP (e.g. regulatory binding proteins or increases in the number of receptors).", 
    "41": "The Working Group on Hypertension in Diabetes recommends starting pharmacologic treatment of hypertension with a small dose of a thiazide, beta-blocker, prazosin hydrochloride, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or calcium channel blocker. Thus, these alternatives are regarded as first-line treatment in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus. Both thiazides and beta-blockers can cause deterioration in glycemic control and have an unfavorable influence on the lipoprotein profile. These metabolic side effects may partly counteract beneficial effects. Non-selective beta-blockers should probably be avoided in diabetic patients, since blockade of the beta-2 receptor may be associated with a compromise in peripheral blood flow and with problems associated with hypoglycemia. Cardioselective beta-blockers, which may have primary preventive effects on coronary disease, are beneficial in this patient group. In patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus without nephropathy or overt fluid retention, diuretic therapy could be replaced by sodium restriction and/or calcium channel blocker therapy, since these agents also have a mild diuretic effect. Calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and prazosin hydrochloride have minimal metabolic side effects, making them suitable for treatment of hypertension in this patient group.", 
    "42": "The mixed beta-adrenoceptor and 5-HT1A receptor antagonists, (-)-pindolol and propranolol, enhance rather than inhibit the hyperlocomotion induced in rats by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT. The mechanism of this effect was now investigated. The rats were pretreated with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist or saline and with the agonist 45 min later. Ambulation was quantified as the number of quadrants entered during a 15 min observation period. (-)-Pindolol, alprenolol, betaxolol, ICI 118,551 and a combination of betaxolol and ICI 118,551 (all at 1 mg/kg) significantly enhanced the locomotion induced by 8-OH-DPAT (0.24 mg/kg). Timolol (1 and 10 mg/kg) given 45 min before 8-OH-DPAT was inactive; however, given at 10 mg/kg 15 min prior to 8-OH-DPAT, the compound enhanced locomotion. (-)-Pindolol (1 mg/kg) also enhanced the locomotion induced by the putative selective 5-HT1A receptor partial agonists, flesinoxan and ipsapirone, but not that induced by 5-OH-DPAT, a DA2 receptor agonist. These results suggest that beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonism can enhance the locomotion induced by 5-HT1A receptor agonists. In the case of mixed 5-HT1A and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated effect may mask the inhibition of locomotion expected from 5-HT1A receptor antagonism.",

Pharmacol. 93, 2P), we have demonstrated that MDL 73005EF also acts as a highly efficacious partial agonist at the 5HT1A receptor, based on its ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase in rat hippocampal membranes. Compared with two structurally related 5-HT1A partial agonists, the rank order of potency of MDL 73005EF in the FSC assay was comparable to affinity calculated by radioligand binding.", 
    "44": "Clinical failure of antiarrhythmic drugs often occurs in practice. Therefore, there is a need for new, effective and long-acting drugs with a wide therapeutic range and a low level of toxicity. Most new class I compounds block the fast sodium ion inward current of myocardial cells. According to their effects on the recovery kinetics of the sodium ion channel, these drugs are classified into 3 groups: IA (intermediate--cibenzoline, pirmenol, hydroxy-3-S-dihydroquinidine, quinacainol); IB (fast--tocainide, moricizine); IC (slow--flecainide, encainide, propafenone, lorcainide, indecainide, recainam and penticainide). Class IC drugs greatly depress intracardiac conduction and are the most potent antiarrhythmic compounds able to suppress ventricular premature beats. However, it is doubtful that long-term suppression of ventricular arrhythmias will improve survival of the patients. Some new drugs have been developed belonging to other classes: class II, esmolol, a new ultrashort-acting beta blocker; class III, N-acetyl-procainamide and sotalol, which prolong duration of the action potential and increase ventricular refractoriness; class IV, the mixed sodium ion-calcium ion-potassium ion antagonist, bepridil. The pharmacologic properties and the clinical effects of these new antiarrhythmic drugs are reviewed. However, future therapeutic trends will depend on the results of large multicenter clinical secondary prevention trials such as the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial. New antiarrhythmic drugs with original electrophysiologic profiles and minimal adverse effects must prove their ability not only to suppress arrhythmias but also to reduce sudden cardiac death rate.", 
    "45": "The effects of nebivolol, the racemic mixture of the SRRR and RSSS enantiomers, on beta-adrenoceptor-mediated cAMP accumulation in living cardiac cells were compared to those of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Serum-free cultivation of cardiac cells from ventricles of 2 to 3-day-old Wistar rats resulted in a population of contractile cardiac cells almost free of mesenchymal non-myocardial cells. Isoproterenol stimulated beta 1- as well as beta 2-adrenoceptor sites. Selective beta 1- and beta 2-receptor site occlusion, in the presence of an appropriate concentration of the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118-551, or the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, CGP 20712-A, showed that the receptor population consisted of mostly the beta 1-adrenergic subtype. The latter could be specifically stimulated by noradrenaline. Nebivolol and d-nebivolol (SRRR) inhibited noradrenaline-induced cAMP accumulation with IC50 values of 22 and 15 nM, respectively. CGP 20712-A was 10 times more active and atenolol was 7 times less active than nebivolol. Both assays, beta-adrenoceptor binding and cAMP accumulation, evidenced beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic properties only for the d-enantiomer of nebivolol (SRRR). 1-Nebivolol (RSSS) showed no beta-adrenergic activity.", 
    "46": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a beta-blocker (mepindolol) with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) to a beta-blocker (metoprolol duriles) without ISA. Hypertensive patients with more than 50 years of age were selected and randomly allocated to receive either 5 mg/day mepindolol (Group A, 10 patients), or 200 mg/day metoprolol duriles (Group B, 9 patients), or placebo (Group C, 10 patients). They were submitted to clinical exam, stress testing and plasma lipids dosage before and after four weeks of treatment. At rest, there were a significant reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) in all groups. The mean values for SBP, DBP and HR at rest after treatment were respectively: 154.0, 95.5, 73.7 (Group A); 148.8, 94.4, 70.1 (Group B); 153.0, 96.0, 77.8; (Group C). During stress testing, there were a significant reduction of SBP, HR and double product (DP). The DBP remained unchanged. The mean values for SBP, DBP, HR and DP during stress testing after treatment were respectively; 198.0, 115.5, 124.3, 246.9 (Group A); 198.8, 114.4, 144.6, 283.2 (Group B); 202.2, 119.0, 143.5, 283.4 (Group C). Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, have not changed with both beta-blockers. There were a significant increase in plasma triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol levels after treatment with beta-blockers. In conclusion, both mepindolol and metoprolol were similarly effective in reducing arterial blood pressure of hypertensive patients. There were not significant differences between the beta-blocker with or without ISA in regard to their effects on plasma lipids.", 
    "47": "The antihypertensive efficacy and subjective and physical tolerability of three different pharmacological treatments (metoprolol, captopril and the combination of hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride) were compared with placebo in 36 elderly hypertensives (aged 61-79 years), according to a Latin-square double-blind design. The placebo and the active treatments were administered for 2 months. Seated blood pressure was significantly reduced by all the pharmacological treatments compared with placebo, but only metoprolol significantly reduced the heart rate. No haematological or biochemical changes were observed during the study. Physical fitness, evaluated as endurance in a standard cycle ergometer exercise test, was slightly decreased after the treatment with metoprolol and the diuretic combination and slightly improved after treatment with captopril. Subjective tolerability, evaluated by a check-list of symptoms, was better during the active therapies, and in particular during the captopril treatment, than during the placebo treatment. Our results indicate that all three active treatment regimens significantly reduce blood pressure in elderly hypertensives and that captopril appears slightly better tolerated physically and subjectively.", 
    "48": "Cultured porcine endothelial cells derived from aortas spontaneously released immunoreactive endothelin into the medium in a time-dependent manner. This release was completely inhibited by cycloheximide and is, therefore, directly related to de novo protein synthesis. The endothlin-induced release was further stimulated by adrenaline. Adrenaline-induced stimulation was completely inhibited by the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine and was not inhibited by the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. Cycloheximide completely prevented the adrenaline-stimulated as well as the basal release. These results suggest that cultured endothelial cells release endothelin slowly but continuously and that this release can be stimulated by adrenaline via alpha-adrenergic receptors. We speculate that the endothelium generates vasoconstrictor signals through endothelin production, thus contributing to the regulation of vascular tone.", 
    "49": "An enzyme (befunolol reductase) which catalyzes the reduction of befunolol to dihydrobefunolol was purified from the cytosolic fraction of rabbit liver to homogeneity by various chromatographic techniques. Befunolol reductase had molecular weights of 29000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 34000 on gel filtration. The enzyme required reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as a cofactor and showed an optimal pH of 6.5. The apparent Km and Vmax values of the enzyme for the reduction of befunolol were 1.7 mM and 4.4 units/mg, respectively. Flavonoids, sulfhydryl reagents, heavy metals and coumarins strongly inhibited the enzyme. The enzyme catalyzed the reduction of a variety of aromatic ketones. In addition to befunolol, some ketone-containing drugs such as daunorubicin and levobunolol were efficiently reduced by the enzyme. On the basis of substrate specificities for steroids, befunolol reductase purified from the cytosolic fraction of rabbit liver appeared to be a 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.",

Approximately 80 to 85 per cent of patients with detrusor hyperreflexia have a functional neuromuscular disturbance of their detrusor muscle. One to 2 per cent of the patients seen in our urodynamic unit have detrusor hyperreflexia caused by a neurogenic bladder. As our clinic's population ages, this type of functional neuromuscular disturbance--neurogenic bladder problem--will increase. The neuromuscular control of the lower urinary tract is complex and not fully understood, explaining why we are unable to treat the functional neuromuscular disturbance in some patients effectively and why we may have to try several drugs before finding one that is effective in other patients. Although patients may have the same symptoms and even the same urodynamic findings, the cause of the functional neuromuscular disturbance may be different. One patient may respond to drug A and not to drug B, and another patient with virtually the same symptoms and urodynamic findings responds to drug B and not to drug A. The main neurologic control of the lower urinary tract is through the sacral outflow of somatic and (mainly) parasympathetic nerve fibers. There appears to be an \"on-off\" control mechanism involving the urethrovesical unit wherein there is parasympathetic inhibition of the detrusor muscle and parasympathetic stimulation of the urethral smooth muscle and stimulation of somatic nerves to the urethral striated muscle at rest. Reverse action occurs when the patient voids. For this reason, cholinergic and anticholinergic drugs exert a powerful influence on the lower urinary tract. Adrenergic control through alpha 1- (and indirectly alpha 2-) and beta 2-receptors (with a preponderance of alpha-receptors in urethral smooth musculature and a preponderance of beta-receptors in the detrusor muscle) appears to modulate and modify parasympathetic action. This explains why adrenergic stimulant and blocker drugs, in most women, do not affect the lower urinary tract as much as parasympathomimetic-lytic drugs. However, adrenergic effect seems to be greater in some women than in others, explaining, for example, why some patients with detrusor hyperreflexia respond to beta 2-stimulatory drugs and not to anticholinergic drugs. Also inter-twined in the neuromuscular control of the lower urinary tract are the roles of prostaglandins and calcium-potassium channel changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "51": "Muscarinic receptors have been identified in the airways in several species, including humans, located on airway smooth muscle, secreting cells and on the nerves. M1 receptors are found in sympathetic ganglia in the guinea-pig and in parasympathetic ganglia in humans. M2 receptors (inhibitory autoreceptors) are found in cholinergic parasympathetic nerve terminals in many species, including humans, whereas the muscarinic receptors found on airway smooth muscle and mucus glands belong to the M3 subtype. It is possible that a defect in neuronal M2 receptor function may explain beta-blocker-induced asthma. M2 antagonists such as methoctramine are promising tools for elucidating the role of muscarinic receptor subtypes in the lung. However, they can potentially increase acetylcholine release. This property is not shown by drugs with a higher selectivity for M1 and M3 receptors which are likely to be useful clinically in the treatment of airway disease.", 
    "52": "Some features of hyperthyroidism mimic sympathetic nervous system overactivity. We have compared the clinical (scored on the Wayne Therapeutic Index), hemodynamic (blood pressure and heart rate) and biochemical (plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucose, free fatty acids, insulin, growth hormone and free thyroxine index) effects of clonidine (alpha 2-agonist, which reduces plasma catecholamine levels) with those of nadolol (non-selective beta adrenergic receptor antagonist) in ten female hyperthyroid patients. Each patient received nadolol for 1 week followed by clonidine for 1 week in a single-blind manner. All measurements were made before treatment and then repeated at the end of the nadolol and clonidine treatment periods. Thyroid function remained unaltered during the study. Both agents caused significant clinical improvement--the mean Wayne Index score was 18 pretreatment, 2 on nadolol and 6 on clonidine (P less than .003 for each). Heart rate was reduced by both drugs, but blood pressure was unchanged. Side effects occurred in eight out of ten patients while on clonidine. Nadolol increased plasma concentrations of epinephrine from 47 +/- 18 pg/mL to 87 +/- 24 pg/mL, and norepinephrine from 241 +/- 154 pg/mL to 338 +/- 224 pg/mL (P less than .001 for each). In contrast, clonidine depressed norepinephrine levels from 241 +/- 154 pg/mL to 110 +/- 49 pg/mL (P less than .001) without lowering plasma epinephrine significantly. Plasma free fatty acids tended to fall on both agents compared to pretreatment levels. The blood glucose, insulin and growth hormone concentrations were unaffected by either drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "Dilevalol is the R-R' optical isomer of labetalol and differs pharmacologically from the racemic mixture in the following ways: it is seven-fold more potent as a selective beta-2 agonist; it is four times more potent as a nonselective beta antagonist; it has no clinically significant alpha antagonist property. Dilevalol is a vasodilator and reduces blood pressure by reducing systemic vascular resistance. It has a half-life of 15-18 hours, and is demonstrated to be effective as an antihypertensive agent for 24-30 hours. Hemodynamic studies in humans show that following administration of dilevalol either orally or intravenously, blood pressure falls as a consequence of a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Cardiac index is unchanged and heart rate decreases slightly. Dilevalol is shown to cause regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in younger individuals, to improve left ventricular performance and to have no effect on parameters of renal function. Prospective double-blinded clinical trials in comparison with placebo, propranolol, metoprolol and atenolol were conducted and demonstrate dilevalol to be an effective antihypertensive agent with a favorable side effect profile with a particularly low incidence of central nervous system side effects.", 
    "54": "The efficacy and safety of long-acting propranolol (LA.P), 160 mg once-daily, in the prophylactic treatment of migraine have been tested against placebo in a multicentric, double-blind, randomized study. The two groups are compared in a parallel manner over a treatment period of 12 weeks, following a 4-week placebo run-in period. Fifty-five of the 74 patients who entered the trial were included at the end of the run-in period. Forty-one patients completed the study. None of the 14 patients who withdrew from the study did so because of side effects. The statistical analysis was done according to the \"intention to treat\" principle. LA.P was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks (p = 0.01 by variance analysis). LA.P reduced the average number of monthly crises by 48% on day 84. There was a slight but significant reduction of the systolic blood pressure and heart rate in the erect position, but there was no significant difference between LA.P and placebo regarding either the number of complaints or the number of side effects elicited out of a 17-item questionnaire. None of the observed side effects led to a withdrawal from treatment.", 
    "55": "The purpose of this prospective randomized trial was to compare the efficacy of propranolol and amiodarone in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias during the first 6 months following myocardial infarction (MI). 97 patients were treated with either amiodarone (n = 48) or propranolol (n = 49) starting on the 9th day following MI. Holter monitoring was carried out on four occasions: on D7, D21, D90 and D180. There was no statistical difference in the incidence of 'major' arrhythmias (an average of at least 10 ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) h-1, multiform or paired VPCs or runs) between the two groups on D7. A significant difference in favour of amiodarone became apparent at D180 (P = 0.04). Patients were also classified according to whether treatment failed or was successful. 'Success' was recorded when arrhythmias remained minor or became minor (less than 10 uniform VPCs h-1) and 'failure' when arrhythmias remained major or became major, or when patients were withdrawn because of side-effects, or lost to follow-up. The difference remained in favour of amiodarone (P = 0.03 at D21; P = 0.05 at D90; P = 0.06 at D180). Evaluation of the percentage reduction in the number of VPCs at D21, D90 or D180 compared with D7 showed superiority of amiodarone at D90 (P less than 0.01) and D180 (P less than 0.04). In this study, the overall effect of amiodarone on ventricular arrhythmias following MI was shown to be superior to that of propranolol.", 
    "56": "The long-term effects of selective (atenolol) and nonselective (carteolol) beta-blockers on brachial artery diameter velocity and flow and on vascular resistance (pulsed Doppler) were compared in two groups of 10 hypertensive patients at respective daily doses of 100 and 20 mg. The drugs decreased mean blood pressure (p less than 0.01) with similar magnitude, although systolic blood pressure was decreased more by atenolol than by carteolol (p less than 0.05). Heart rate was decreased by atenolol (p less than 0.01) but was unchanged by carteolol. The drugs did not change brachial circulation when the hand circulation was present. During hand exclusion (wrist occlusion) comparison from baseline showed that atenolol decreased velocity and flow (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05) and increased resistance (p less than 0.05), whereas carteolol decreased resistance (p less than 0.05); after 3 months of treatment, velocity and flow were higher (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.001) and resistance was lower (p less than 0.01) with carteolol than with atenolol. Thus, hand exclusion demonstrated opposite drug effects on arterioles--dilation for carteolol and constriction for atenolol.", 
    "57": "Dilevalol, the R-R optical isomer of labetalol, a nonselective beta-antagonist with vasodilation from selective beta 2 agonism, was administered in sequential multiple bolus intravenous injections of 10 to 100 mg in total doses ranging from 35 to 585 mg (mean dose, 414 mg) to 101 patients with supine diastolic blood pressures above 120 mm Hg. Mean blood pressure was reduced from 200 (+/- 3)/129 (+/- 1) mm Hg to 149 (+/- 2)/101 (+/- 1) mm Hg, a mean reduction of 51/28 mm Hg. The therapeutic goal was established as a reduction in supine diastolic blood pressure to less than 100 mm Hg or a reduction of at least 30 mm Hg. This was achieved in 62 (61%) of 101 patients, with an additional 7 patients having a final supine diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg. Treatment with dilevalol was less successful in black male patients than in the group at large. There was a tendency for older patients to respond better than younger patients. Prior recent treatment of patients with beta-adrenergic antagonists decreased the effectiveness of the drug. Significant orthostatic hypotension was not noted. Sixty-four patients were transferred to oral dilevalol treatment in combination with a diuretic, and blood pressure in this group averaged 160/100 mm Hg after 1 month of therapy. Dilevalol appears to be a safe and effective drug that can be used intravenously successfully in the majority of patients with severe hypertension and provides an alternative to therapy with other agents. It also is a useful agent for oral treatment of these patients after successful intravenous therapy.", 
    "58": "In two randomized, double-blind clinical trials comparing pinacidil with prazosin and with placebo in patients with hypertension, a number of statistically significant and potentially beneficial effects on blood lipids were detected in the patients taking pinacidil. Patients treated with pinacidil exhibited significant average decrements from baseline in concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides and a significant average increment in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The mean effects seen in the pinacidil group were significantly greater than those in the placebo group for both total cholesterol (-9.8 vs +4.2 mg/dl, p less than 0.001) and triglycerides (-21.6 vs +8.6 mg/dl, p less than 0.001). The effects seen in patients given pinacidil were also significantly greater than those seen in the patients treated with prazosin for both high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+3.6 vs -1.0 mg/dl, p = 0.002) and triglycerides (-14.8 vs +30.3 mg/dl, p less than 0.001). Negative effects of hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol on blood lipids were not apparent in patients given pinacidil. Thus, pinacidil treatment of hypertension is associated with a beneficial effect on blood lipids, which may be of clinical significance.", 
    "59": "Hypertension is common following coronary artery bypass surgery. The safety of labetalol, a recently released combined alpha-1 and beta-adrenergic blocking agent for treatment of hypertension in this clinical situation is controversial. The authors compared the hemodynamic effects of labetalol with those of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in 91 patients with good left ventricular function and equally severe coronary artery disease and in whom coronary artery bypass surgery had been just completed. They were anesthetized using fentanyl, diazepam, and enflurane. If hypertension developed postoperatively, patients were randomized to receive labetalol, 2 mg/min to a maximum of 300 mg (20 patients) or sodium nitroprusside in 0.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 increments by infusion (20 patients) to return blood pressure to normal. Compared with control values, labetalol brought about significant (P less than 0.05) reductions in heart rate, and cardiac index. No change was noted in stroke volume or systemic vascular resistance, but slight increases were found in central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Sodium nitroprusside treatment caused significant increases in heart rate and cardiac index while reducing diastolic blood pressure, central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Stroke volume remained unchanged. Following the study period, blood pressure was controlled in all patients with SNP. Total doses of SNP in the 16 h following the study period were significantly less in the labetalol group (46.6 +/- 11.7 mg) versus (116.1 +/- 10.3 mg) in the SNP group (P less than 0.05). In this clinical circumstance, labetalol can be safe and effective for controlling hypertension, but its mechanism of achieving this effect varies from that for sodium nitroprusside.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "Numerical methods have been used to compare the availability predictions of a number of hepatic elimination models when Michaelis-Menten kinetics is operative. Propranolol and galactose were used as model compounds. Lower availabilities were predicted by the dispersion model than by a segregated distribution model for both compounds. The differences in the predictions were most pronounced for models corresponding to a large variation in solute residence times in the liver. The predictions of the tank-in-series, dispersion model with mixed boundary conditions and dispersion model with Dankwerts boundary conditions were similar over all concentrations studied. Changes in blood flow and protein binding provided little discrimination between the model predictions. It is concluded that micromixing of blood between sinusoids and the anatomical sites of mixing are important determinants of availability when liver eliminating enzymes are partially saturated.",

All patients were treated with antithyroid drugs, carbimazole being the mainstay of treatment. The incidence of the disease was 0.9 per 1000 births and was similar with other series. No cases of fetal goitre were noted. The mean birth weight was 2952 g; there was no significant difference in the birth weight of term live births in patients treated with carbimazole alone or carbimazole combined with propranolol.", 
    "62": "After a brief revision about the long QT syndrome, we report the case of a 52 year old man admitted to hospital for a syncopal attack. His electrocardiogram was considered normal: sinus bradycardia and U waves were recorded. The echocardiogram revealed anterior mitral leaflet redundancy and possible tricuspid prolapse. During the atropine test, after a normal increment of sinus frequency, 2 runs of self-limited torsade de pointes appeared. The electrocardiogram showed lesion wave at first, and then prolonged QT. During the intracavitary study, premature ventricular stimulation caused torsade de pointes. After propranolol iv it was no more possible to induce major ventricular arrhythmias anymore. Coronarography was normal. Nadolol therapy was begun. On 6 months follow-up the patient is asymptomatic.", 
    "63": "In order to determine whether isovolumic relaxation period (IRP) reflects left ventricular relaxation under different afterload conditions, 17 anesthetized, open chest dogs were studied, and the left ventricular pressure decay time constant (T) was calculated. In 12 dogs, angiotensin II and nitroprusside were administered, with the heart rate constant at 90 beats/min. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the aortic dicrotic notch pressure (AoDNP) and T were major determinants of IRP, while left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was a minor determinant. Multiple linear regression analysis, correlating T with IRP and AoDNP, did not further improve the correlation coefficient compared with that between T and IRP. We concluded that correction of the IRP by AoDNP is not necessary to predict T from additional multiple linear regression. The effects of ascending aortic constriction or angiotensin II on IRP were examined in five dogs, after pretreatment with propranolol. Aortic constriction caused a significant decrease in IRP and T, while angiotensin II produced a significant increase in IRP and T. IRP was affected by the change of afterload. However, the IRP and T values were always altered in the same direction. These results demonstrate that IRP is substituted for T and it reflects left ventricular relaxation even in different afterload conditions. We conclude that IRP is a simple parameter easily used to evaluate left ventricular relaxation in clinical situations.", 
    "64": "The cardiotoxic effect of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol was studied in cultured neonatal rat myocytes. A progressive increase in irreversible cell injury as determined by leakage of the cytoplasmic enzyme alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (alpha-HBDH) from the cells was noted at concentrations above 2.5 x 10(-4) M isoproterenol (exposure time 6 h). The isoproterenol-induced cell damage was reduced or prevented by several free radical scavengers: the application of Trolox C, a water-soluble vitamin E analogue, ICRF-159, a chelator of divalent cations, ascorbic acid, a potent antioxidant, as well as the enzymatic free radical scavengers superoxide dismutase and catalase reduced alpha-HBDH release. This study corroborates the hypothesis that oxidation products of isoproterenol, especially the formation of oxygen- and/or oxygen-derived free radicals, are responsible for the cytotoxicity observed after prolonged exposure to isoproterenol. In contrast to isoproterenol, exposure to 5 x 10(-4) M fenoterol, another beta-adrenergic agonist which is not oxidized, does not impair the viability of the myocytes. Moreover, application of the beta-blocker propranolol (10(-4) M, 10(-5)M) in combination with 5 x 10(-4) M isoproterenol does not prevent alpha-HBDH release. These findings suggest that isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity is not the result of excessive beta-adrenoceptor activation, but is mediated by the formation of free radicals.", 
    "65": "In spontaneously hypertensive turkeys, both high blood pressure and high catecholamine levels play a role in the development of vascular hypertrophy. We studied the effect of labetalol, an alpha- and beta-blocking drug, on the aortic media. Seventeen turkeys were given increasing doses of the drug (20-35 mg/kg daily) from the 2nd to the 35th week of age; 13 control birds were given a daily placebo. The actively treated turkeys showed significantly lower values of blood pressure and a lower heart rate compared with the controls throughout the study period. After the turkeys had been killed, seriate histological sections taken from the abdominal aorta near the bifurcation were used for a three-dimensional assessment of the aortic media by computerized morphometry. The volume of aortic media was significantly lower in the labetalol-treated birds than in the controls. This was also observed in the non-responder turkeys. This finding indirectly supports the view that catecholamines may play a major but independent role in the development of vascular hypertrophy.",

This indicated an anxiogenic response in this test. This anxiogenic response was not significantly reversed by DL-propranolol (5 and 10 mg/kg IP) or clonidine (0.02 and 0.04 mg/kg IP). These results provide no evidence to suggest that the anxiogenic effects of chlordiazepoxide withdrawal are mediated by an increase in noradrenergic activity.

We examined encapsulation of propranolol hydrochloride and the ability of the fibers to act as a sustained-release delivery system for propranolol hydrochloride as a model drug. The U.S.P. basket dissolution method was used to evaluate the in vitro drug release kinetics and the effect of the aspect ratio (length/diameter) on drug release. For in vivo evaluation, selected fibers were administered to dogs in gelatin capsules. The results of these in vitro and in vivo studies were compared to those obtained with a marketed sustained-release propranolol product (Inderal LA). The fiber delivery system provided a sustained-release profile of plasma propranolol concentrations similar to that observed with Inderal LA.",

The additional ionization introduced by the sulphate group into these compounds compared with the basic parent drug does not produce a corresponding increase in hydrophilic character. 2. Zwitterionic conjugates have constant lipophilicity between their pKa values. The opposite charges on the ionizing functional groups in this pH range appear to cancel the effect of each other on lipophilicity. 3. In the case of propranolol the O-sulphate derivative is more lipophilic than the parent compound at pH values below 7, despite the ionized character of the sulphate function. 4. The decrease in lipophilicity appears to be related to the separation in the molecular structure of the amino and sulphate groups.",

Effects where studied in shortened sheep cardiac Purkinje fibres with the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. Action potentials were activated at a frequency of 0.25 Hz and membrane currents at 0.03 Hz or 0.05 Hz in most experiments. Out of the currents investigated the transient outward current (ito) reacted most sensitively to (+)- and (+/-)-sotalol. Ito-amplitude was decreased on the average to 77% of reference at 10 mumol/l and to 53% at 1000 mumol/l (+)- or (+/-)-sotalol. The maximally available ito-current was decreased but the voltage-dependent control of inactivation was left nearly unchanged. The initial inwardly rectifying current (iK1), which propels the last repolarization phase of the action potential and controls resting potential to a large extent was reduced on the average to 93% of reference at 10 mumol/l and to 62% at 1000 mumol/l (+)- or (+/-)-sotalol. Time-dependent (delayed) outward current (iK) was on the average not affected by (+)- or (+/-)-sotalol up to 100 mumol/l and was decreased to 84% of reference current under the influence of 1000 mumol/l. An initial outward current, which is activated at positive membrane potentials (iinst) was not clearly affected by (+)- or (+/-)-sotalol at concentrations up to 1000 mumol/l.

    "71": "CS-905 is a potent dihydropyridine calcium blocker that has a gradual and long-lasting antihypertensive action with little tachycardia in SHR. In this study, we investigated chronic and acute effects of CS-905 on renal functions in SHR. To examine the chronic effects, 23 week-old male SHR were treated with CS-905 (1 or 3 mg/kg/day, p.o.) or 0.3% CMC (carboxymethylcellulose). After the 15 week-treatment, the agent dose-relatedly lowered systolic blood pressure measured 24 hr after the final administration (184 +/- 2 and 173 +/- 3 mmHg at 1 and 3 mg/kg/day vs. 218 +/- 4 mmHg for the control group). Natriuresis and the reduction of urinary protein excretion were also observed in the CS-905 treated groups. Urinary NAG (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase) activity tended to decrease, but not significantly. Histopathological changes observed in the SHR kidney were reduced by chronic treatment with CS-905. On a single oral administration in 38 week-old SHR, CS-905 caused natriuresis at a dose of 3 mg/kg, but did not affect urinary protein excretion and urinary NAG activity. These effects of CS-905 on renal functions may be beneficial in the treatment of hypertension.",

Digoxin (0.25-0.5 mg daily), metoprolol (50-100 mg twice a day) and verapamil (40-80 mg three times a day) were evaluated for this purpose. An open randomised cross-over design was followed. The efficacy of a drug was evaluated by: (1) subjective improvement on a visual analog scale, and (2) objective improvement on repeated multi-stage symptom-limited treadmill exercise. In patients with sinus rhythm greater than or equal to 50% subjective improvement was seen in 90%, 40% and nil with metoprolol, verapamil and digoxin, respectively. The total work done by these patients was 1008 +/- 541 kpm (control), 2869 +/- 1418 kpm on metoprolol, 2369 +/- 884 kpm on verapamil and 1654 +/- 918 kpm on digoxin.

    "73": "Although propranolol is still the drug of first choice for migraine prophylaxis, the optimal antimigraine dose of this drug is still unknown. The main aim of our study is to clarify this point. Fifty-three patients suffering from severe migraine attacks were given propranolol at low doses, close to or up to 1 mg/kg body weight daily, for one month. If the patient responded, then treatment was maintained unchanged for a further two months. If the patient did not respond, propranolol was progressively increased until control was obtained. Thirty-nine (73.5%) patients responded to low doses, and 7 of the 17 patients whose dose had been increased, because of poor or absent response, showed improvement. Five patients did not finish the study because of intolerable side effects, which intensified as the dose was increased. Tolerance was not noticed. In addition to confirming the well-known utility of propranolol in migraine prophylaxis, our results show that low doses are effective in controlling serious migraine bouts in many patients. Fewer than a third of patients will need higher doses in controlling migraine attacks.",

Antagonism between ketamine and either histamine or acetylcholine was examined also. Ketamine caused bronchial relaxation irrespective of the constricting agent, and exerted a partial and non-competitive antagonism to histamine and acetylcholine. Propranolol and indomethacin did not inhibit the effect of ketamine, excluding the involvement of beta activation and of prostaglandins.", 
    "75": "The previous findings that the inducible [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding sites with low affinity for isoproterenol (RL) could be regulated by serotonin (5-HT) in vitro and by 5-hydroxytryptophan and the 5-HT uptake inhibitor fluoxetine in vivo, prompted the present pharmacologic characterization of these receptor sites, using nonlinear regression analysis of competition binding curves. If isoproterenol was used as the displacing agent, lesioning with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine selectively increased [3H]-DHA binding sites with low micromolar affinity. By contrast, if 5-HT was used as the displacing agent, the receptor population with high agonist affinity showed a fourfold increase whereas the density of [3H]-DHA sites with low micromolar affinity for 5-HT was not altered. Neither the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, nor mianserin, a 5-HT2 and 5-HT1C antagonist, altered the induced RL receptor population, whereas the selective 5-HT1B agonist CGS-12066B reduced the increase in the RL receptor population with a potency equal to that of 5-HT. These results strengthen the notion that the [3H]-DHA sites with low agonist affinity for isoproterenol represent 5-HT1B receptors induced following a reduction of serotonergic neuronal function.",

Metoprolol treatment caused an 8% decrease in heart rate and a 13% decrease in blood pressure and led to a rise in plasma triglycerides, 24%, 17% and 34% after 1, 3 and 6 months of metoprolol treatment, respectively. However, no effect on plasma triglycerides was observed after 9 months of metoprolol treatment while a reduced cholesterolemic response was observed. Intimal proliferations containing accumulations of lipids were observed in small intramural branches of coronary arteries (greater than 100 microns) in 11 of 31 control rats fed the atherogenic diet for 9 months. In contrast, similar changes were observed in only 1 of 34 metoprolol-treated rats fed an otherwise identical diet.

Half of the hypertensive patients were under the age of 50 (young group) and half were over the age of 50 yrs (old group). The antihypertensive agents had not been administered according to any specific protocol, but represented the choice of the individual clinicians treating the patients in the clinic. All patients had received treatment for at least one year, and usually for two years. The behavioural tests performed were designed to measure sensory-perceptive ability, cognitive ability and psychomotor function and were those employed and described in our previous studies. The results achieved were varied, but indicated that older age was associated with an impairment in performance as was blood pressure. Test performances in the young hypertensives were similar to those achieved by older normotensives. These results were more prominent in cognitive and psychomotor functions than in the sensory-perceptive tests. The antihypertensive drugs used also affected these results; the worst behavioural performances tended to be in patients receiving the central nervous system agonists (methyl-dopa and clonidine) and better performances in patients receiving beta-blockers alone when compared with the other groups. Surprisingly, patients receiving diuretics showed poorer performance levels, but these were better in patients who received a beta-blocker in combination with their diuretic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "The effects of amiodarone and sotalol were studied with programmed electrical stimulation of the heart in 19 patients with inducible tachycardia (AV nodal tachycardia: 10 cases, circus movement tachycardia: 9 cases). Amiodarone was administered intravenously at a dose of 300 mg over 2 min and sotalol at a dose of 1.5 mg kg-1 over 10 min. Both i.v. amiodarone and sotalol lengthened the transnodal conduction time, the effective refractory period of the AV node and the AV nodal Wenckebach cycle length. Only sotalol significantly lengthened the effective refractory periods of the right atrium and the right ventricle. Infused intravenously during tachycardia, amiodarone interrupted arrhythmia in five of six patients and sotalol in seven of ten cases. Tachycardia was stopped by blockade of the impulse into the AV node in three amiodarone patients and in five sotalol patients. In the remaining four cases, the weak link of the circuit was the accessory pathway. Thus i.v. sotalol exhibits electrophysiologic effects consistent with both class II and III activity, whereas the effects of i.v. amiodarone are the result of different activities throughout all areas of the cardiac tissue.", 
    "80": "Automatic analysis of heart rate variability from Holter recordings may be invalidated by beat recognition errors and recording artefact, necessitating filtering and editing of the computer-recognized RR interval sequence. Two new methods for heart rate variability analysis have been developed, based on an estimation of the width of the main peak of the frequency distribution curve of the computer-recognized normal-to-normal beat sequence. These methods are independent of a low level of recognition error and artefact, thus removing the need for operator-dependent, time-consuming editing. The value of the new methods (heart variability indices 1 and 2) in identifying patients with serious events (death and symptomatic, sustained documented ventricular tachycardia) during a 6-month follow-up after acute myocardial infarction was assessed in a case-control study comparing 20 patients who had experienced such events (Group I) with 20 patients who, following admission with acute myocardial infarction, had remained free of complications for greater than 6 months after discharge (Group II). Group II was selected to match Group I with regard to age, sex, infarct site, ejection fraction, and beta-blocker treatment. Analysis of the unfiltered computer-recognized normal-to-normal interval sequence showed that heart rate variability indices 1 and 2 were significantly lower (P less than 0.005, P less than 0.002) in those who had experienced events compared with those free from complications. Two other methods of expressing heart rate variability, including the standard deviation method, in combination with four different data-filtering techniques, gave less significant distinction between those with and without events during follow-up. It is concluded that using the methods described, reduced heart rate variability in patients at risk from death or sustained ventricular tachycardia after acute myocardial infarction can be detected automatically from unfiltered Holter tape recordings even in the presence of a low level of beat recognition error and recording artefact.", 
    "81": "The protective effects of beta 1-adrenergic blockade with metoprolol (Betaloc Astra) were demonstrated in the gerbil model of myocardial injury provoked by acute ischaemic brain lesions. The myocardial injury was reversible and lipid droplet accumulation was its most striking morphological feature. These droplets were easy to measure in EM photographs and their size was expressed as percentage of sarcoplasmic volume. The EM data of fat accumulation were compared in hearts of carotid-ligated animals with and without metoprolol pretreatment, and in animals with the carotid isolated only, at standard intervals 3-48 h after operation. While in carotid-ligated-only animals the average myocardial fat contents rose to a peak of 1.9% at 10 h, in metoprolol pretreated animals the amount of fat was always significantly lower and started to return earlier to basal values (peak at 6 h, 1.1%). In carotid-isolated-only animals, fat accumulation peaked at 6-10 h (1.1%) and returned quickly to normal levels (0.34 +/- 0.18%). This effective pharmacological blockade with metoprolol strongly supports the concept of catecholamine mediation between acute intracranial lesions and myocardial injury. The background and significance of myocardial fat accumulation is discussed. The EM morphometry of fat droplets appears to be a suitable tool for quantification of reversible myocardial damage most useful for experimental evaluation of cardioprotective measures. As changes in succinic dehydrogenase histochemistry (from 'myofibrillar' to 'granular' pattern) correlated with EM measured fat accumulation, the simplicity and speed of the SDH method recommends itself for fast orientation about presence of myocardial damage.", 
    "82": "Chick embryos rendered calcium deficient by long-term culture outside the eggshell develop hypertension and tachycardia (R. Tuan and H. Q. Nguyen, J. Exp. Med. 165: 1418-1423, 1987). To characterize the hypertension of cultured shell-less (SL) chick embryo, we have compared their cardiovascular response to adrenergic drugs with normal (NL) embryos at day 14 of incubation. Blood pressure and pulse rate were measured before and after administration of norepinephrine (NE), phentolamine (PA), isoproterenol (IP), and propranolol (PP). Base-line blood pressures (systolic and diastolic) were uniformly higher in SL than NL embryos. In both embryos, blood pressure was elevated by NE and PP but lowered by IP and PA; pulse rates were decreased by PP and PA and increased by NE and IP. Pharmacological sensitivity to NE and PA, based on their effective dosages and magnitude of response in blood pressure and pulse rate, was higher in SL embryos. On the other hand, the embryos did not differ significantly in their sensitivity to IP and PP. The plasma concentration of catecholamines was considerably higher in SL embryos. Although serum calcium was lower in SL embryos, myocardial calcium content was not significantly different. Thus the cardiovascular function of SL embryos is likely to be under more sensitive and potentiated alpha-adrenergic regulation, perhaps a result of different calcium handling by several tissues (e.g., myocardium). These properties of the SL chick embryo indicate that it is a novel and useful experimental system to study the relationship between calcium homeostasis and development of hypertension.", 
    "83": "Disturbances in autonomic control during myocardial ischemia may contribute significantly to the development of malignant cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore acute ischemia was induced in 29 mongrel dogs with healed myocardial infarctions during an exercise test. Seventeen animals developed ventricular fibrillation (susceptible, S), whereas 12 dogs did not (resistant, R). Before the exercise plus ischemia test a coronary occlusion was made at rest. The amplitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (0.24- to 1.04-Hz component of R-R interval fluctuation) was used as an index of cardiac vagal tone. Acute ischemia elicited a significantly larger heart rate increase in susceptible animals (S: control 115.6 +/- 0.8, occlusion 176.4 +/- 8.2 beats/min vs. R: control 114.6 +/- 8.9, occlusion 145.7 +/- 7.5 beats/min). Accompanying the heart rate increase were significantly greater reductions in the cardiac vagal tone index in the susceptible animals. (S: control 6.4 +/- 0.3, occlusion 2.2 +/- 0.6 ln ms2 vs. R: control 6.6 +/- 0.4, occlusion 5.1 +/- 0.5 ln ms2). beta-Adrenergic receptor blockade reduced the heart rate increases but exacerbated the reductions in the cardiac vagal tone index. These data suggest that coronary artery occlusion elicits a significantly greater increase in sympathetic activity coupled with a greater reduction in parasympathetic activity in animals subsequently shown to be susceptible to ventricular fibrillation.", 
    "84": "The endocardium modulates contractile performance of subjacent myocardium in isolated heart muscle. We investigated the effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 0.01-30 microM) on isolated cat papillary muscles with or without intact endocardium (+E or -E, respectively). Selective endocardial damage by 1-s immersion in 1% Triton X-100 caused reduction in half-isometric relaxation time (RT1/2) and isometric twitch tension (TT), but not maximum unloaded shortening velocity (Vmax). 5-HT caused reduction in RT1/2 in endocardium-intact but an increase in endocardium-damaged preparations (at 30 microM: -12.1 +/- 1.8%, +E; +5.2 +/- 1.5%, -E). Mean percent increases in TT were greater in endocardium-damaged muscles (at 30 microM: 37.3 +/- 8.6%, +E; 107.3 +/- 19.5%, -E). In the presence of ketanserin (1 microM), 5-HT reduced RT1/2 in endocardium-intact (at 30 microM: -11.9 +/- 1.3%) but not endocardium-damaged muscles (except slightly at 30 microM) and increased TT at 30 microM by 28.7 +/- 4.9% (+E) and 48.9 +/- 15.6% (-E). In the presence of propranolol (1 microM), 5-HT increased RT1/2 (+E and -E) while increasing TT by 23.3 +/- 7.8% (+E) and 43.5 +/- 2.5% (-E). Endocardium did not influence changes in Vmax. Ketanserin (1 microM), but not propranolol (1 microM), markedly diminished endocardial damage induced by 5-HT (greater than or equal to 10 microM). These results suggest a 5-HT-induced endocardium-mediated \"inhibitory\" effect (causing earlier isometric relaxation) that is not blocked by ketanserin.", 
    "85": "The renal medulla harbours powerful humoral antihypertensive mechanisms, as earlier explored in unclipping experiments on renal hypertensive rats or in normotensive isolated kidneys cross-circulated at increased perfusion pressures from 'donor rats', in which renal function also seemed to be affected. Injection of the renomedullary factor medullipin I (Med I; formerly ANRL) mimics these haemodynamic responses, and Med I seems to be one of the most important mediators of the depressor effects. The present study was performed to analyse further the haemodynamic and, particularly, the renal effects of Med I, using anaesthetized intact WKY rats and constant-pressure perfused (90 mmHg) isolated WKY kidneys, cross-circulated by these intact 'donor' rats. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and renal function were followed for one 30-min period before and two 30-min periods after injection of 1 mg Med I (M; n = 7) or an equal volume of saline as control (C; n = 13). In the intact 'donor' WKY, MAP and HR remained largely constant in C during the three periods, being 126 +/- 5, 125 +/- 5, and 120 +/- 5 mmHg, while MAP fell in the M group after Med I, from 121 +/- 5 to 107 +/- 7 and 107 +/- 5 mmHg (P less than 0.05), and also HR tended to decrease in M. Renal resistance (RR) fell while renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increased significantly (P less than 0.05) after Med I in the M donor rats despite their MAP reduction. However, in the constant-pressure perfused, cross-circulated kidneys the RR, RPF and GFR changes were clearly more pronounced (P less than 0.01) and also diuresis, natriuresis, osmolar excretion and osmolar clearance increased significantly after Med I (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, the present results support the view that Med I not only has important and long-lasting depressor effects but also affects renal function in important ways, inducing vasodilatation and increasing GFR, RPF, diuresis and sodium-osmolar excretion."
