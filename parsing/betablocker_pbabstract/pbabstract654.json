    "0": "The role of hormones and other humoral factors in the regulation of myocardial hypertrophy has been difficult to evaluate. We asked whether myocardial cell hypertrophy could be demonstrated in cultures from the day-old rat ventricle and evaluated the effect of serum concentration and catecholamines on the growth process. Two single-cell preparations were used: serum-supplemented, bromodeoxyuridine-treated cultures and serum-free cultures with transferrin and insulin. Both preparations were characterized by myocardial cell predominance (about 75--80% of total cells) and constant cell numbers. Myocardial cell size was documented by photomicroscopy and quantified by volume (microscopic diameter of suspended cells), surface area (planimetry of attached cells), and total cell protein concentration (Lowry method and cell counts). Growth was also evaluated in pure nonmyocardial cell cultures. In cultures with 5% (vol/vol) serum, myocardial cell size increased 2- to 3-fold over 11 days in culture. Final volume, surface area, and protein concentration were about 3000 micrometer3/cell, 5000 micrometer2/cell, and 1500 pg/cell, respectively. Serum had a dose-related effect on myocardial cell hypertrophy; myocardial cell size increased about 4-fold when serum concentration was increased from 0% to 5% or 10%. Cells maintained in serum-free medium with transferrin and insulin (each 10 microgram/ml) did not hypertrophy, but did remain responsive to the growth-promoting activity of serum. Chronic exposure to isoproterenol or norepinephrine (1 microM) significantly stimulated myocardial cell hypertrophy. This stimulation was dose-related, was not blocked by equimolar propranolol, was not associated with a sustained chronotropic effect, and was more pronounced in the serum-free preparation. In pure cultures of nonproliferating (bromodeoxyuridine-treated) nonmyocardial cells, cell size also increased with time in culture, but variation in serum concentration and addition of norepinephrine had no significant effect on cell size. Myocardial cell hypertrophy occurs in culture and is regulated by variations in the culture medium, including serum, with its contained hormones and growth factors, and catecholamines. The culture preparation can be used to explore the regulation of myocardial cell hypertrophy by nonhemodynamic factors.", 
    "1": "The beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug exaprolol liberated histamine from isolated rat mast cells in a dose- and time-dependent way. Histamine was liberated within seconds and was not followed by a parallel granule liberation. The inhibition of histamine liberation was induced with low temperature, low pH, high concentration of Ca2+, TTD, suramin and EDTA. Subcellular distribution of 3H-exaprolol demonstrated a quantitative relationship between histamine depletion against exaprolol uptake in isolated rat mast cell granules. A nonspecific mechanism of action in the effect of exaprolol on mast cells is discussed. It is proposed that the drug acts on mast cells due to the direct and indirect ion exchange mechanism resulted in disproportion between histamine and granule liberation.", 
    "2": "Alteration of mast cell cyclic AMP levels have been implicated in the acute respiratory symptoms in mill workers following inspiration of cotton, flax, or hemp textile dusts. This paper describes the inverse relationship between the cellular levels of cyclic AMP and the degranulation in pure culture of mast cells in response to aqueous cotton bract extracts of glanded and glandless varieties.", 
    "3": "Substance P (SP), a vasoactive neuropeptide, has recently been demonstrated in the female genital tract. In the present paper we have investigated the relationship between substance P (0, 0.065, 6.5, 650 pmol X min-1 X kg-1) administered by close intraarterial infusions, and myometrial blood flow (MBF). The MBF was measured by the 133Xe washout technique in ten non-pregnant, estrogen pretreated, female rabbits anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone. SP increased MBF in a dose-dependent fashion. This effect was not influenced by cholinergic, adrenergic or enkephalinergic blocking agents, indicating a direct effect of substance P on vascular smooth muscle. Substance P may therefore play a physiological role in the local nervous control of myometrial blood flow.", 
    "4": "The correlation between the binding of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, (--)[3H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHAP), and the adrenergic inhibition of histamine release by acetylcholine and by compound 48/80 was studied with isolated purified rat mast cells and in rat mast cell crude membrane fractions. Acetylcholine-evoked histamine release was inhibited by catecholamines, in the order isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline. Pretreatment of cells with (--)alprenolol antagonized the inhibitory effect of isoprenaline on acetylcholine-induced histamine release. 40/80-evoked histamine release was blocked by isoprenaline at significantly higher concentrations than those required to inhibit cholinergic histamine release. The inhibitory effect of isoprenaline was equally antagonized by preincubating mast cells with (--)alprenolol. Specific binding sites for DHAP have been demonstrated in rat mast cell membranes. The specific binding of DHAP was inhibited by adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists according to the stereospecificity of these compounds. A close correlation between the binding-inhibitory potency of various adrenergic compounds and the data obtained in the pharmacological experiments was found, thus indicating the presence of beta-adrenoceptors in rat mast cells.", 
    "5": "Left ventricular (LV) relaxation was studied in patients with hypertensive heart disease with LV hypertrophy (HHD, n = 25) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, n = 9), and these data were compared with that of normal controls (n = 20). The effects of oral administration of propranolol (n = 11), pindolol (n = 3), nifedipine (n = 6) and diltiazem (n = 5) in patients with HHD and that of propranolol (n = 9) in patients with HCM were also studied. Isovolumic relaxation time (IRT) was measured using dual M-mode echocardiography and peak normalized rate of change of the LV cavity in early diastole (peak dD/dt/D) was calculated by M-mode echocardiography using a digitizer and microcomputer system. IRT was significantly longer in HHD (112 +/- 24 msec, p less than 0.001) and in HCM (85 +/- 40 msec, p less than 0.05) compared with that of normal subjects (64 +/- 24 msec). The normal value of peak dD/dt/D was 3.8 +/- 0.7 sec-1, and it was significantly lower in HHD (2.7 +/- 0.8 sec-1, p less than 0.001). It was also lower in HCM (3.2 +/- 0.8 sec-1), but without a statistical significance. In HHD there was a significant relationship (r = -0.611, p less than 0.01) between peak dD/dt/D and wall thickness of the LV (interventricular septum + LV posterior wall). There was no significant change in IRT before and after the administration of beta-blockers and calcium antagonists except nifedipine in HHD (before: 116 +/- 28 msec, after: 80 +/- 14 msec, p less than 0.005). It was probably due to the effect of an accompanied decrease in heart rate. However, peak dD/dt/D was significantly increased in both HHD and HCM groups after the administration of propranolol, pindolol, nifedipine and diltiazem. These data show that LV relaxation is abnormal in the hypertrophied LV. Although the genesis of this abnormality is not clear, there seems to be a close relationship between the relaxation abnormality and increased LV mass in HHD. Oral administration of propranolol, pindolol and diltiazem for patients with HHD and propranolol for patients with HCM seems to improve the abnormal LV relaxation of each disease.", 
    "6": "Tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome of involuntary movements that develops during or following long-term neuroleptic treatment. Current treatment of tardive dyskinesia is unsatisfactory. Neuroleptics can reduce the syndrome, but the underlying pathogenetic process is probably aggravated during treatment. The use of these drugs is necessary, however, when the patient simultaneously exhibits intense psychotic and dyskinetic symptoms. In this controlled study, 8 patients were treated with a beta-blocker drug, oxprenolol, as a slow-release preparation that was administered in increasing doses up to 640 mg per day for one month. We conclude that this drug can ameliorate both the psychotic features of schizophrenics and their tardive dyskinetic movements without producing significant side-effects.", 
    "7": "The influence of vascular beta-adrenoceptors on the tooth-supporting functions of the periodontal ligament were studied in 30 anesthetized rabbits. Propranolol and the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists ICI 118,551 and H 35/25 induced a marked extrusion of the incisor, probably due to reduced vasodilator tone in periodontal postcapillary blood vessels. Isoprenaline reversed the movement. beta 1- and beta 2-receptor antagonists decreased the intrusive responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation in teeth close to control position, but had no effect on responses in fully extruded teeth. Intrusive mobility, as tested by intermittent loading with 5-10 g, remained unaffected by beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The results suggest that vascular beta 2-adrenoceptors are important in the regulation of tooth position by their control of periodontal postcapillary resistance. Prejunctional beta-receptors enhancing the vasoconstrictor--and intrusive--responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation are probably a mixture of beta 1- and beta 2-receptors. It would seem that the periodontal vasculature is important for the position of the rabbit tooth but, due to rapid adaptive mechanisms of the tooth-supporting tissues, the vasculature contributes little to the resistance against load-induced intrusive movements of the tooth.", 
    "8": "The effects of alpha-, beta- or alpha + beta-adrenergic blockade on arterial plasma concentrations of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin in response to splanchnic nerve stimulation were studied in anesthetized cats. In control experiments splanchnic nerve stimulation caused a marked rise in plasma glucose and glucagon concentrations and a marked fall in insulin but somatostatin was unaffected. Pretreatment with phentolamine significantly increased basal plasma insulin concentration but the response pattern to splanchnic nerve stimulation was not altered. Propranolol attenuated both the glucose and insulin responses. Combined alpha-and beta-blockade abolished the hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia induced by splanchnic nerve stimulation, whereas the rise in plasma glucagon was not affected. It is concluded that insulin release from the pancreas and glucose release from the liver is controlled by adrenergic mechanisms whereas pancreatic glucagon and somatostatin secretion is relatively insensitive to splanchnic nerve stimulation in cats.", 
    "9": "Prenalterol, previously characterized as a functionally cardioselective partial beta-adrenoceptor agonist, was shown to relax K+ -elicited contractures in the uterine muscle from progesterone pretreated rats (pD2 7.7) and to increase beating rate in the rat right atrium (pD2 8.0) at about the same concentrations with maximal effects corresponding to 94 and 82% respectively of those of isoproterenol. Terbutaline, with equal maximal effects as isoproterenol, was 50 times more potent in the uterus (pD2 7.8) than in the right atrium (pD2 6.1). Both tissues displayed a high sensitivity to isoproterenol (pD2 9.1 in both tissues) indicating large receptor reserves for the full agonist. The maximal relaxing effect of prenalterol in the uterus was obtained at about a three-fold increase of the cyclic AMP content, which is similar to that obtained with isoproterenol at a corresponding relaxation. The effects in the uterine muscle of all three agonists were mediated through beta 2-adrenoceptors since beta 2-adrenoceptor blockers (ICI 118, 551 and IPS 339) antagonized the effects in concentrations which had only marginal effects on the atrial responses of the agonists. The beta 1-antagonists pafenolol and pamatolol in concentrations higher than those, which blocked the effects of the agonists on beating rate, were devoid of inhibitory effects in the uterus. These results indicate that prenalterol possesses the ability to elicit a functional response by stimulation of either beta 1-or beta 2-adrenoceptors provided that the tissue has a large spare receptor reserve for full agonists.", 
    "10": "Several neuroleptic drugs enhance the release and the turnover of noradrenaline in the central nervous system and in peripheral organs. The present study demonstrates the effect of long term treatment (18 days) with atypical neuroleptic drugs (clozapine, thioridazine, and sulpiride) on beta-adrenoceptor density in the cerebral cortex and in the myocardium of rats. 1. Clozapine and thioridazine significantly reduced the number of 3H-dihydroalprenolol (DHA)-binding sites by 24 and 21%, respectively, in a crude cortical membrane fraction, and by 28 and 24% in myocardial membranes. 2. Sulpiride failed to alter the maximal number of binding sites in the cortex and in the myocardium. 3. The affinity of 3H-DHA to its binding sites remained unchanged by treatment with neuroleptic drugs. 4. Desipramine, which is known to reduce cerebral beta-adrenoceptors during chronic administration, was tested as reference compound. It proved to be more effective in this regard than clozapine and thioridazine in the cortex, but failed to reduce 3H-DHA binding in the myocardium. 5. Acute treatment with desipramine, clozapine, and thioridazine had no effect on 3H-DHA binding in the cerebral cortex. The decrease in beta-adrenoceptor density after long term treatment with neuroleptics may be ascribed to an increased concentration of noradrenaline at the receptor site due to antagonism at presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors and inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake.", 
    "11": "In experiments on fibroblasts of Chinese hamster (B II d ii FAF-28, clone 431) it is shown that the specific beta-agonist isoproterenol causes an increase in the intracellular content of cAMP and a decrease in radiosensitivity of the cells. The beta-antagonist propranolol blocks the appearance of the above effects due to isoproterenol. Isoproterenol fails to affect either the intracellular cAMP level or radiosensitivity of mice fibroblasts L, clone B-82, endowed with a functioning adenylate cyclase system but deprived of beta-adrenergic receptors. It is presumed that an increase in radioresistance of mammalian cells due to the effect of isoproterenol is possible only in the presence of beta-receptors in the cells and that it is realized through the beta-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "12": "A comparative study of three treatments of reflex sympathetic dystrophy (selected at random) was carried out on 55 cases : 20 patients were treated with calcitonin, 19 with beta-blocking agents, and 16 with griseofulvin. The delay in drug effect seems similar for the 3 drugs but griseofulvin is associated with a greater failure rate. The beta-blocking agents and calcitonin gave comparable results. beta-Blocking agents appear to obtain better results than other 2 treatments in patients with a psychological component to their disease.", 
    "13": "The first part of the article is a general review of the various drug treatments available for algodystrophy : purely symptomatic, analgesic treatment, vaso-active drugs, calcitonin. The major advance over the last few years has been the use of beta-blockers and calcitonin but, to date, only one double blind trial has been published. This study demonstrated the value of calcitonin after one month of treatment. The authors undertook a retrospective study of 651 cases and a prospective study of 91 cases and based their work on the evaluation of various treatments prescribed separately examining each therapeutic sequence rather than each individual case. Three treatments stood out by their frequent use : griseofulvin, calcitonin and beta-blockers. Each of these drugs was effective in more than 60 p. cent of cases. It is impossible, in such a study, to formulate a hierarchy of the various treatments. Only controlled studies will be able to establish their order of effectiveness. The results vary somewhat according to the site of the algodystrophy. The best therapeutic response is obtained in lesions involving the hip leading to a very favourable prognosis.",

The symptoms, signs, clinical course, and prognosis vary according to the type of glaucoma. Therefore, appropriate classification is essential to determine specific medical or surgical therapy.", 
    "16": "In acute experiments on 29 dogs with coronary occlusion changes in cardiohaemodynamics, epicardial electrogram and the regional contractility of the myocardium were studied with the aid of echocardiography after combined administration of inderal with nitroglycerin or sodium nitroprusside. It was established that under these conditions nitrites retain their ability to decrease the load on the heart: they decrease the end diastolic pressure and the volume of the cavity of the left ventricle, enhance the productivity of the heart Nitrites given with inderal do not change the contractility of the ischemized area and also do not affect the magnitude of the rise of ST segment of the epicardium electrogram of the ischaemic zone. It is concluded that the use of nitrites in acute myocardial ischaemia combined with inderal is justified to decrease congestive insufficiency of the heart, excepting cases with marked hypotension.", 
    "17": "1 Phenylephrine (1-100 microgram/kg, intravenously) produced dose-dependent increases in heart rate and blood pressure in the pithed rat. 2 The positive chronotropic response to phenylephrine (10 microgram/kg) was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by propranolol (0.01-0.3 mg/kg), but higher doses of propranolol (up to 3 mg/kg) did not reduce the response by more than about 50%. The residual response was virtually abolished by phentolamine (0.3 mg/kg) or prazosin (3 microgram/kg). Labetalol (3 mg/kg) which has both alpha- and beta-blocking activity, also abolished the positive chronotropic response. 3 The pressor response to phenylephrine (1-30 microgram/kg) was enhanced by propranolol (1 mg/kg) and abolished by phentolamine (1 mg/kg) and prazosin (30 microgram/kg). Labetalol (3 mg/kg) reduced the response to phenylephrine by 73%. 4 Propranolol (0.3 mg/kg) completely blocked the chronotropic and vasodepressor effects of isoprenaline (0.1 microgram/kg). 5 It is concluded that phenylephrine acts on both alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoreceptors to produce an increase in heart rate, on alpha 1-adrenoreceptors to produce vasoconstriction and on beta 2-adrenoreceptors to produce vasodilation. This latter effect is usually masked by the predominant vasoconstrictor action.", 
    "18": "The benzodiazepines and the beta-adrenergic blockers are effective in the treatment of anxiety neurosis (generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder) but offer little help in the treatment of agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorders. The antidepressants are often effective in agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorders, and the evidence suggests that their antipanic and antiobsessional effects may be independent of their antidepressant properties. There is suggestive evidence linking the antiobsessional effect to a specific neurotransmitter (serotonin) system.", 
    "19": "The effectiveness of organic nitrates in the therapy of angina pectoris can be explained from their direct relaxing action on vascular smooth muscle. At conventional dosage the most important action of nitrates is a pooling of blood in the large systemic venous capacitance vessels which leads to a decrease of central venous pressure and ventricular filling pressure. The resulting reduction in left ventricular volume lowers, at virtually constant arterial pressure, systolic wall tension and hence myocardial oxygen consumption. Only at higher dosage, is a distinct dilatation of systemic resistance vessels affected. The fundamental action of the \"Ca antagonists\", i.e. the inhibition of transmembrane calcium influx in the myocardium and the vascular smooth muscle, includes various beneficial effects for the treatment of angina pectoris. The lowering of myocardial oxygen consumption after application of calcium antagonist is mainly due 1. to the decrease in afterload of the left ventricle, caused by the relaxation of peripheral resistance vessels, 2. to the reduction in ventricular preload by a peripheral venodilation. By a direct inhibitory effect on the coronary vascular tone, coronary blood flow at rest in patients with angina pectoris increases. In addition, Ca antagonists are very efficacious in relieving angiospastic angina. The primary mode of action of beta-blocking drugs in angina pectoris affects, in contrast to the peripheral mechanisms of nitrates and Ca antagonists, is on the heart directly. By the reduction in the extent of exercise heart rate, the increase in cardiac output and, hence, the mean arterial pressure is also significantly lower during exercise under beta-blockade. Beta-blockers also depress the contractile state of myocardium. Therefore, the main factors of the myocardial oxygen consumption (mean arterial pressure, size of the left ventricle, contractility and heart rate) may be essentially influenced. By the decrease in heart rate and the longer diastolic period a better myocardial oxygen delivery results. Besides the immediate cardiac effects of beta-adrenergic blockade, a decline in peripheral resistance combined with a fall in blood pressure occur in hypertensive patients during long-term drug administration. Different hypotheses have been proposed in the last years to explain the antihypertensive mode of action of beta-blockers. Some possible mechanisms are discussed.", 
    "20": "Three kinds of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SH rats) from 5 to 13 weeks of age, and their effects on the development of hypertension and on peripheral sympathetic nervous system were investigated. In SH rats treated with the vehicle (2% Tween 80) for 8 weeks, systolic blood pressure increased from 132 +/- 1.3 to 179 +/- 2.7 mmHg (n = 10). Treatment with propranolol (2 X 50 mg/kg/day p.o., n = 8), pindolol (2 X 15 mg/kg/day p.o., n = 8) and D-32 (2 X 15 or 2 X 50 mg/kg/day p.o., n = 9) for 8 weeks slightly but definitely depressed the aforesaid development of hypertension, and their average reduction in systolic blood pressure was approximately 15 mmHg. In the pressor response to electrical stimulation of pre-ganglionic sympathetic nerves, there was not any difference between SH rats treated with vehicle and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (propranolol and D-32). P.o. administration of guanethidine or phentolamine, however, caused a slight hypotension and produced a significant reduction in the pressor response to electrical stimulation. SH rats treated with propranolol showed a leftward shift of the pressor response curve not to norepinephrine but to angiotensin II as compared with that obtained from vehicle treated SH rats. This phenomenon is probably due to the decreased renin release by the prolonged-treatment with drug. On the basis of these results, we could not obtain any clear evidence that the antihypertensive action exerted by beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents resulted from some interference with the function of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "21": "The effects of prenalterol infusion, 0.5 microgram/kg/min, on renal function were studied in 10 male volunteers. Systolic blood pressure increased by 22 mmHg (P less than 0.01) and diastolic pressure decreased by 11 mmHg (P less than 0.01). Heart rate increased by 11 beats/min (P less than 0.01). Plasma catecholamine levels and plasma renin activity were not altered. Renal haemodynamics were unchanged. Urine flow rate and fractional free water excretion decreased by 29% and 45%, respectively (P less than 0.01). Fractional sodium excretion increased by 19% (P less than 0.01) and fractional potassium excretion fell by 33% (P less than 0.05).", 
    "22": "Forty-eight chronically (greater than 3 months) beta-receptor-blocked patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or hypertension were studied on 49 occasions after random distribution to a 4-day, gradual preoperative withdrawal (n = 26) or a continuation (n = 23) of beta-receptor blockers. The patients were scheduled for either a cholecystectomy (n = 28) or a carotid thrombendarterectomy (n = 21) under neurolept anaesthesia. Three patients were excluded from the randomized part of the study due to complications (tachycardia, hypertension, severe angina) after therapy withdrawal. In subgroups, central haemodynamics (beta-receptor blockers withdrawn n = 6, continued n = 8) and creatinine-kinase B (beta-receptor blockers withdrawn n = 9, continued n = 11) were studied. Withdrawal of beta-receptor blockers was associated with high heart rates, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and a hyperkinetic circulation during pain stimuli. Significantly more postoperative ECG changes (P less than 0.02) indicative of myocardial ischaemia were found than in beta-receptor blocked patients. These patients had low heart rates but also pronounced increases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, which in single patients could be associated with myocardial damage. These results imply that beta-receptor blockers should be continued before surgery and that a concomitant vasodilatatory therapy is likely to avoid the drawbacks of an increased cardiac afterload.", 
    "23": "Twenty-six patients on chronic (greater than 3 months) beta-receptor blocking therapy due to ischaemic heart disease and/or hypertension were randomly distributed to a 4-day gradual withdrawal (n = 13) or a continuation of ordinary therapy until a planned cholecystectomy under neurolept anaesthesia (n = 13). Plasma-adrenaline, -noradrenaline, -potassium, -glycerol, -FFA, -insulin and b-glucose were determined perioperatively. The metabolic response to surgery was as expected with hyperglycaemia and depressed insulin levels, which did not differ significantly between the two groups of patients. Plasma-catecholamines showed the highest mean values during emergence from anaesthesia. Plasma-adrenaline and -potassium were constantly highest in the beta-receptor-blocked patients, who also showed indices of a relatively depressed lipolysis compared to patients in whom beta-receptor blockers had been withdrawn. These discrepancies between withdrawal versus continuation of preoperative beta-receptor blockade seemed to be of small clinical importance and did not oppose the present view that beta-receptor blockers should generally be continued during surgery. However, findings in individual patients suggest that beta-receptor blockade may maintain hypoglycaemia in catabolic patients.", 
    "24": "In the present study, investigations were performed to determine the subtype(s) of beta-receptor-mediating relaxation in K+-depolarized guinea pig uterine preparations, and inhibition of twitches in field-stimulated rat vas deferens preparations. The relative activities of (-)-isoprenaline, salbutamol, terbutaline, noradrenaline, and RO363, and the affinity constants determined for the beta 1-receptor antagonist atenolol, and the beta 2-receptor antagonist lCl 118551, indicated that all the inhibitory responses in both preparations were mediated solely through beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation. In the uterine preparations there was a small population of alpha-receptors which were of little consequence when assessing beta 2-receptor-mediated activity. During K+-induced contractures, both neuronal and extraneuronal uptake systems were inactivated. In rat vas deferens preparations, it was necessary to pretreat the tissues with phenoxybenzamine in order to prevent alpha-receptor actions and neuronal and extraneuronal uptake systems interfering with beta-receptor-mediated activity. In both tissues, 6-8 highly reproducible concentration-effect curves to (-)-isoprenaline could be established. However, the uterine preparation responded more robustly to repeated washings, required less sensitive recording apparatus, and showed responses to individual concentrations of drugs that were more readily quantified. However, in general, both preparations appear to be suitable as tissues for assessing the beta 2-adrenoceptor actions of drugs.",

In contrast to previous findings with beta-blockers based on heterocyclic moieties and with either an isopropylamino or tert-butylamino substituent on the side chain, several compounds proved to be cardioselective when further examined in anesthetized cats.

Aryloxypropanolamino derivatives N-substituted with alpha 2-benzodioxanylmethyl group showed a favourable alpha/beta ratio and a high selectivity towards beta 1 receptors. Substitution with different aralkyl groups afforded compounds with a low alpha-activity, although with a high potency and selectivity towards beta 1 receptors.

    "29": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage, following rupture of an intracranial aneurysm, affects about 25 000 people in the U.S. each year. Less than half the patients who survive until hospital admission have an overall favorable outcome. This high morbidity and mortality rate is a result of serious complications following the initial subarachnoid hemorrhage, the most significant of these being rebleeding and cerebral ischemia secondary to vasospasm. While surgical clipping of the aneurysm is the most definitive therapy, this procedure may be postponed for a week or two after the initial hemorrhage, depending on the patient's clinical condition. Pharmacological therapy is a critical part of the preoperative care of these patients and of the postoperative management of complications. This article discusses the syndromes of rebleeding and vasospasm and reviews the current pharmacologic therapy for each.", 
    "30": "1 The effects of K-351 on the electrical and mechanical responses were investigated in the canine mesenteric artery by isometric tension recording and the use of intracellular microelectrodes. The results were compared to the responses observed with other alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents. 2 K-351 (greater than 3 X 10(-7)M) consistently inhibited the contraction evoked by perivascular nerve stimulation; however, K-351 had no effect on the contraction evoked by direct muscle stimulation, after pretreatment with 3 X 10(-7)M tetrodotoxin. 3 Phentolamine enhanced and prazosin had no effect on the amplitude of contraction evoked by perivascular nerve stimulation at a high frequency (over 1.0 Hz). Pretreatment with phentolamine inhibited the contraction evoked by lower frequencies of perivascular nerve stimulation (below 0.5 Hz). 4 The potency for the inhibition of the response to perivascular nerve stimulation was in the order of K-351 greater than phentolamine greater than prazosin, while the contractions induced by exogenously applied noradrenaline (5 X 10(-7)M) were inhibited in the order: prazosin greater than phentolamine greater than K-351. 5 K-351 (less than 3 X 10(-5)M) did not modify the resting membrane potential or the membrane resistance, as estimated from the change in the amplitude of electrotonic potentials in the smooth muscle cell membranes. 6 K-351 (greater than 3 X 10(-7)M) inhibited the amplitude of the first e.j.p. and e.j.ps after completion of the facilitation process following stimulation at frequencies over 0.25 Hz. 7 K-351 (less than 3 X 10(-5)M) did not modify the compound action potentials recorded from peripheral nerve bundles distributed on the mesenteric artery. 8 Phentolamine (greater than 1 X 10(-8)M) inhibited the first e.j.p. but this agent either inhibited or enhanced the amplitude of e.j.p. after completion of the facilitation process produced by repetitive stimulation below or over 1.0 Hz stimulus frequencies, respectively. Prazosin (1 X 10(-6)M) had no effect on e.j.ps evoked by perivascular nerve stimulation, at any stimulus frequency applied. 9 These results indicate that K-351 inhibits the extra-junctional adrenoceptor with a slightly weaker potency than prazosin or phentolamine, but that this agent has a potent action as an intra-junctional adrenoceptor blocking agent. Phentolamine acts mainly on the extra-junctional adrenoceptors and also has weak actions on intra-junctional adrenoceptors, as a blocking agent. This agent also inhibits the presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor. Prazosin inhibits only the extra-junctional alpha 1-adrenoceptor.", 
    "31": "Haemodynamic effects of a cold pressor test (foot immersion for 6 min in water at 5 degrees C) without medication and after the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol and the selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker metoprolol were studied in 17 volunteers. In the control study as well as in the study with the beta-adrenoceptor blockers cold exposure caused comparable changes, namely a blood pressure rise and a reduction of forearm blood flow. The increase in heart rate during cold exposure was clearly and equally reduced by both beta-adrenoceptor blockers. Plasma noradrenaline rose significantly by 47%, plasma adrenaline did not change. It is concluded, that as to this kind of stress, beta 1-selective-adrenoceptor blockade confers no important advantage over non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "32": "1 Eight hundred patients were approached by questionnaire to give details of side effects of their antihypertensive medications. The response rate was 72.8%. The percentage of those questioned who were taking beta-adrenoceptor antagonists at the time was 54.6%. 2 Raynaud's phenomenon (P less than 0.05) and complaints of cold extremities (P less than 0.001) were significantly more frequent in women than in men, 74.8% of women complained of cold extremities. 3 Exposure to beta-adrenoceptor antagonists did not increase the prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon in either men or women in the study, but did increase the prevalence of cold extremities in men (P less than 0.001). Propranolol, labetalol, oxprenolol and possibly atenolol were likely to produce such side effects. Smoking and the addition of vasodilators did not alter the effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockers on peripheral vascular symptoms. Complaints of cold extremities were not associated with an excess of complaints of other side effects.", 
    "33": "1 We have assessed the efficacy of Viskaldix, a combination of pindolol 10 mg and clopamide 5 mg using continuous intra-arterial ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. 2 Fourteen of the sixteen patients entered were studied on no therapy and following a minimum of 6 weeks at a constant dosage of Viskaldix. 3 Viskaldix produced a marked and consistent reduction of the blood pressure over the 24 h. The diurnal variation in the heart rate was decreased. 4 The results were compared with those of a similar study with once-daily pindolol where there was control during the day but not in the early morning when the blood pressures rose rapidly.", 
    "34": "Ventricular ectopy occurs commonly. Its significance is related to the degree of complexity and the associated cardiac substrate. Coronary artery disease is the most frequent underlying cause, followed by cardiomyopathy and valvular disease. Symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias require treatment, whereas benign simple ventricular ectopy does not; however, the treatment of asymptomatic high-grade ventricular ectopy remains controversial. Therapy first must be directed toward the cardiac disease. Evaluation of the patient includes Holter monitoring, echocardiography, radionuclide studies, exercise testing, cardiac catheterization, and electrophysiologic testing. Programmed stimulation is useful in the diagnosis and prognosis of ventricular tachycardia, as well as in the evaluation of drug regimen efficacy. After treatment of ischemia and/or failure, specific antiarrhythmic agents, conventional and investigational, alone or in combination, are systematically selected. Should medical therapy alone be insufficient, consideration is given to surgical procedures such as subendocardial resection or ventriculotomy, often in combination with bypass grafting, aneurysmectomy, or valvular replacement. Electronic devices, including pacemakers or automatic internal defibrillators, may also be useful in certain selected cases. Suggested guidelines are proposed for a standardized approach, although therapy for each patient must still be individualized.", 
    "35": "Captopril was administered (50 mg orally) to 88 untreated hypertensive patients (70 with essential hypertension, eight with renal arterial disease, 10 with renal parenchymal disease) and to 25 hypertensive patients treated with sympatholytic or beta-blocking agent (20 with essential hypertension, five with renal arterial disease). In the former group, captopril caused a decrease in heart rate (HR) in 18 patients and an increase in only two. As a whole, captopril caused significant decreases in blood pressure without increase in HR. Significant negative correlation was observed between change in HR and plasma renin activity obtained before captopril administration (n = 79, r = -0.425, p less than 0.0001). Hypotensive and chronotropic effects of captopril were almost identical in untreated and treated patients. Hypotensive effects caused by captopril and nifedipine (20 mg orally) were almost identical. Nifedipine caused reflex tachycardia, while captopril caused slight bradycardia. Absence of compensatory tachycardia appears to be related to reduction of endogenous angiotensin II by captopril.U", 
    "36": "The effects of perfusion of postulated direct- and indirect-acting sympathomimetics on evoked potentials in the CA1 region of the in vitro rat hippocampus were examined. A selective alpha agonist, 6-fluoronorepinephrine, produced depressions of population spike amplitude which were antagonized by the alpha antagonist phentolamine, but not by the beta antagonist timolol. The selective beta agonist, 2-fluoronorepinephrine, produced increases in population spike amplitude which were antagonized by timolol but not by phentolamine. Weak and variable responses were seen to the indirect-acting sympathomimetic tyramine, with lower doses producing increases and higher doses producing decreases in population spike amplitude, respectively. As with 2-fluoronorepinephrine, increases in spike amplitude elicited by tyramine were blocked by timolol but not by phentolamine. Another indirect-acting sympathomimetic, d-amphetamine, produced only increases in population spike amplitude which were blocked by timolol. Phencyclidine, an agent which may produce some of its central effects via noradrenergic synapses, was virtually ineffective in producing catecholamine-like responses in this system. Only nonspecific, local anesthetic effects were observed. Taken together with previous studies, these results support the hypothesis that activation of alpha and beta receptors decreases and increases, respectively, pyramidal cell excitability. Furthermore, although both alpha and beta receptors appear to be capable of interacting with endogenously released norepinephrine, the beta response may predominate.", 
    "37": "Previous studies have documented that leukocytes from atopic individuals show reduced cyclic AMP (cAMP) responsiveness to isoproterenol, histamine, and prostaglandin E1. We questioned whether this blunted response was due to rapid enzymic breakdown of cAMP. We measured cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity in mononuclear leukocytes of patients with atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis and noted consistent, significantly elevated levels. Kinetic studies showed differences in two of three leukocyte enzyme forms between normals and patients. Isolated lymphocytes from atopic dermatitis patients lacked a low Km phosphodiesterase form and showed an increase in the high Km, high-activity form seen in normal monocytes. The increased phosphodiesterase activity provides an explanation for the blunted cAMP responsiveness in atopic leukocytes and may reflect a basic biochemical characteristic relevant to abnormal immunocellular regulation in atopic disease.", 
    "38": "The purposes of this study were to evaluate the beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptor blocking properties of acebutolol and propranolol and measure the plasma levels of acebutolol, its acetylated metabolite and propranolol. Ten patients with reversible obstructive airways disease and hypertension received two separate dose levels of acebutolol and propranolol for five days each. Cardioselective properties were assessed by determining the beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic-stimulating effects of terbutaline 5 mg before and at the end of each five-day treatment period. Both acebutolol and propranolol were clinically well tolerated. Following study drug there was a 100 percent inhibition of the beta 1 terbutaline effect, and an approximate 83 percent inhibition of the beta 2 terbutaline effect. There were no clinically significant differences between acebutolol and propranolol. The acetylated acebutolol metabolite accumulated levels two to three times higher than the parent compound, and its effects may have destroyed the cardioselectivity of acebutolol. Thus, acebutolol did not demonstrate clinically relevant cardioselectivity.", 
    "39": "The natural history of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy was assessed in relation to clinical features, treatment with propranolol and prognosis in 100 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who were followed 5--20 years (mean 8 years). Seventy-one patients received propranolol, 120--800 mg/day (mean 240 mg). At diagnosis, the voltage measurement from SV1 + RV5 was 37 +/- 20 mm, the R wave in aVL was 12 +/- 6 mm and the mean frontal plane voltage was 15 +/- 10 mm. After 5 years, these values were increased to 43 +/- 22 mm (p less than 0.0002), 14 +/- 6 mm (p less than 0.003) and 17 +/- 10 mm (p less than 0.01), respectively. Neither a left ventricular outflow tract gradient nor propranolol treatment influenced these voltage changes. Twenty patients had an increase of more than 10 mm in SV1 + RV5, which was associated with exertional chest pain (p less than 0.006) and death (p less than 0.02). Four patients had a decrease of more than 10 mm in SV1 + RV5. Two of these received high-dose propranolol, one 720 mg/day for 12 years and another 800 mg/day for 12 years. No other patient received more than 480 mg of propranolol daily. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy there is electrocardiographic evidence of progressive hypertrophy, which is associated with poor prognosis and is not influenced by treatment with propranolol in moderate dosage. Regression of hypertrophy is rare and may be related to long-term treatment with high-dose propranolol.", 
    "40": "Long-term treatment with timolol in patients ages 65--75 years who survived myocardial infarction was related to a significant reduction, compared with placebo, in overall mortality (p less than 0.05), total cardiac death (p less than 0.01), sudden death (p less than 0.05) and reinfarction (p less than 0.01). The analyses were based on 732 patients (384 taking placebo and 348 timolol) from a cohort of 1884 patients in the Norwegian multicenter timolol study. The dosage of timolol was 10 mg twice daily and the patients were followed for 12--33 months (mean 17 months). There were 83 deaths in the placebo group and 52 deaths in the timolol group, a reduction of 35.5%. There were 69 initial reinfarctions in the placebo group and 38 in the timolol group, a reduction of 39.2%. There was no difference in the reduction of mortality and reinfarction between patients 65--75 years of age and patients less than 65 years of age. The incidence of side effects, the number of withdrawals and the reasons for withdrawal were similar in older and younger patients. We conclude that age should not be a decision-making factor concerning timolol therapy in postinfarct patients.", 
    "41": "The large arteries at the base of the brain in the pig were studied in vitro for their responsiveness to neurogenic and humoral stimuli. Helical strips of these cerebral vessels tonically contracted consistently following application of resting force. The development and maintenance of this tone were not influenced by prior treatment of strips with tetrodotoxin (5 x 10(-7) M), 6-hydroxydopamine (300 micrograms/ml) guanethidine (5 x 10(-6) M), or antagonists of known vasoactive autacoids (i.e., phentolamine, propranolol, atropine). Once tone reached an equilibrated plateau, transmural nerve stimulation and exogenously applied norepinephrine evoked a relaxation. The relative potency of beta-adrenergic agonists in producing a relaxation was isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than epinephrine much greater than terbutaline. The response to norepinephrine, but not that to transmural nerve stimulation, was abolished by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. The neurogenic response, but not the relaxation to exogenous catecholamines, was blocked by tetrodotoxin and 6-hydroxydopamine and diminished by guanethidine. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and adenosine were also potent relaxant agents. These responses, but not the response to transmural nerve stimulation were blocked by alpha-chymotrypsin (1.5 U/ml) and aminophylline (3 x 10(-5) M), respectively. These results suggest that porcine cerebral vessels develop myogenic tone which allows one to examine neural and/or humoral dilator responses without prior spasmogen addition. The vascular beta-receptors appear to be of the beta 1-subtype which is consistent with that found in other species. The nature of the dilator neurotransmitter is unknown, but the functional integrity of the adrenergic nerve terminals appears important for the neurogenic relaxation.", 
    "42": "During in situ perfusion of rat liver stimulation of nerve bundles around hepatic artery and portal vein resulted in an increase of glucose output, a switch from lactate uptake to output and in a decrease of portal flow. These effects remained essentially the same during 3 stimulation periods at 20 min intervals; norepinephrine overflow, however, was strongly decreased during the second and third period. The metabolic and hemodynamic effects were not correlated to norepinephrine overflow during repetitive stimulations and during stimulations in the presence of norepinephrine, phentolamine, propranolol or desipramine.", 
    "43": "In the light of reports that beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs seem to be ineffective in Black hypertensives, the effects of penbutolol on exercise-induced tachycardia were assessed in 6 Black and 6 White healthy volunteers. After a standardized breakfast at 08h00 the subjects received either intravenous penbutolol or placebo at 08h45, on a randomized double-blind basis. At each test session subjects were exercised for 5 minutes on a bicycle ergometer, the load predetermined to increase their heart rates to +/- 130/min. Recordings, spaced at 30-minute intervals, commenced 45 minutes after the injection. The results indicate that Black volunteers require a higher dose of penbutolol than Whites to achieve a similar degree of beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade. It also appears that the maximal response is lower in Blacks.", 
    "44": "This report presents the final results (follow-up 5--8 years) of a prospective study in 768 men aged under 65 with mild to moderate angina, 50% or greater stenosis in at least two major coronary arteries, and good left ventricular function. 395 were randomised to coronary artery bypass surgery, 373 to no treatment; 1 patient in the surgery group was lost to follow-up. These original groups were compared, whatever subsequently happened to the patients. Survival was improved significantly by surgery in the total population, in patients with three-vessel disease, and in patients with stenosis in the proximal third of the left anterior descending artery constituting a component of either two or three vessel disease, and non-significantly in patients with left main coronary disease. An abnormal electrocardiogram at rest, ST-segment depression greater than or equal to 1.5 mm during exercise, peripheral arterial disease, and increasing age independently point to a better chance of survival with surgery. In the absence of these prognostic variables in patients with eigher two or three vessel disease the outlook is so good that early surgery is unlikely to increase the prospect of survival. In terms of anginal attacks, use of beta-adrenergic blockers and nitrates, and exercise performance the surgical group did significantly better than the medical group throughout the 5 years of follow-up, but the difference between the two treatments tended to decrease.", 
    "45": "Beta-Adrenergic receptors were studied in intact cells of chick, rat and mouse embryo brain in primary cultures, by the specific binding of [3H]dihydro-L-alprenolol ([3H]DHA). The results were compared to the receptor binding of broken cell preparations derived from the cell cultures or from the forebrain tissues used for the preparation of the cultures. Detailed analysis of [3H]DHA binding to living chick brain cells revealed a high-affinity, stereoselective, beta-adrenergic-type binding site. Equilibrium measurements indicated the apparent positive cooperativity of the binding reaction. By direct fitting of the Hill equation to the measured data, values of Bmax = 12.01 fmol/10(6) cells (7200 sites/cell), Kd = 60.23 pM and the Hill coefficient n = 2.78 were found. The apparent cooperative character of the binding was confirmed by the kinetics of competition with L-alprenolol, resulting in maximum curves at low ligand concentrations. The rate constants of the binding reaction were estimated as k+ = 8.31 X 10(7) M-1 X min-1 and k- = 0.28 min-1 from the association results, and k- = 0.24 min-1 from the dissociation data. The association kinetics supported the cooperativity of the binding, providing a Hill coefficient n = 1.76; Kd, as (k-/k+)1/n was found to be 101 pM. Analysis of the equilibrium binding of [3H]DHA to rat and mouse living brain cells resulted in values of Bmax = 13.04 fmol/10(6) cells (7800 sites/cell), Kd = 43.85 pM and n = 2.52, and Bmax = 8.08 fmol/10(6) cells (4800 sites/cell), Kd = 46.70 pM and n = 1.63, respectively, confirming the apparent cooperativity of the beta-receptor in mammalian objects, too. The [3H]DHA equilibrium binding to broken cell preparations of either chick, rat or mouse brain cultures or forebrain tissues was found to be non-cooperative, with a Hill coefficient n = 1, Kd in the range 1-2 nM, and a Bmax of 10(3) - 10(4) sites/cell. Our findings demonstrate that cell disruption causes marked changes in the kinetics of the beta-receptor binding and in the affinity of the binding site, although the number of receptors remains unchanged.", 
    "46": "In this study we compared characteristics of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) binding sites in crude membrane preparations of human peripheral blood lymphocytes with those of intact, viable cells. A valid determination of specific beta-adrenergic receptor binding in both preparations was obtained by defining non-specific [3H]DHA binding with 10(-6) M l- or dl-propranolol or 10(-3) M l-isoproterenol. Higher concentrations of propranolol were used in prior reports on lymphocyte membranes. We showed that these concentrations may inhibit non-specific binding, causing non-saturability and inhomogeneity of the estimated 'specific' binding. In the intact cell preparations, inclusion of 10(-4) M phentolamine was necessary to reduce the high degree of non-specific binding. By contrast, phentolamine (10(-4) M) showed no effect on the [3H]DHA binding to membrane preparations. At 37 degrees C the [3H]DHA binding to beta-adrenergic receptor sites in both intact and broken cell preparations was rapid and reversible. The sites were stereoselective, as l-propranolol was about two orders of magnitude more potent to inhibit [3H]DHA binding than was the d-isomer. In both preparations, agonists competed for specific binding with a rank order of potency isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine, which indicated a beta 2-type of adrenergic receptor. The specific [3H]DHA binding was saturable and Scatchard analysis revealed comparable numbers of homogeneous, non-cooperative binding sites (approximately 1250 receptors/cell in the membrane preparations and 1700 receptors/cell in the intact cells). In spite of these similarities the membrane sites showed a lower affinity for the antagonists [3H]DHA and propranolol than did the intact cell sites, whereas their affinity for the agonists was increased. These differences indicate that the membrane system might be less suited to provide physiologically significant information about the beta-adrenergic receptor system.", 
    "47": "We carried out a randomized double-blind controlled secondary-prevention trial of oxprenolol over seven years. Forty milligrams of oxprenolol or placebo was given twice daily to 1103 men 35 to 65 years old who had an acute myocardial infarction between 1 and 90 months previously. Overall, there was no difference in mortality or cardiac events between the placebo and oxprenolol groups. The major influence on prognosis was the time at which treatment was started after infarction. In 417 patients in whom treatment was started within four months of infarction oxprenolol increased the six-year cumulative survival rate from 77 to 95 per cent (P less than 0.001). In 274 patients with treatment starting between 5 and 12 months of infarction the survival rate was similar in the two groups, but in 412 patients entered between 1 and 7 1/2 years after their first infarction oxprenolol reduced the six-year survival rate from 92 to 79 per cent (P = 0.002). The increased mortality in this latter group mainly occurred late after withdrawal from active treatment. The value of low-dose oxprenolol in secondary prevention appears to be confined to patients treated relatively soon after myocardial infarction.", 
    "48": "16 patients suffering from hypertension and angina pectoris (class II according to the NYHA) are treated with 100 mg atenolol once daily for three weeks. A good decrease of the blood-pressure values and a clinical improvement of the anginous symptomatology are observed. The bicycle ergometer exercise test showed an increase of the effort tolerance. The addition of 30 mg nifedipine for other three weeks, decreased further on the values of the blood-pressure and of the double product. The ergometric exercise showed an increase of total work and of the maximum working capacity reached by patients. This association (atenolol + nifedipine) was particularly useful in patients who presented symptoms of intolerance toward other drugs (nitroderivate f. es.), because of less collateral effects and easy administration.", 
    "49": "The binding of some acidic drugs to alpha 1-AGP was studied by equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees, pH 7.4. Certain acidic drugs bound to alpha 1-AGP at one binding site with a high affinity. Though the alpha 1-AGP plasma concentration is far lower than the HSA concentration, the association constants of some acidic drugs with alpha 1-AGP are high enough to suggest that binding to alpha 1-AGP will contribute significantly to the total plasma binding of these drugs.", 
    "50": "Pharmacokinetics of metoprolol, propranolol, and atenolol were investigated in six healthy volunteers following 7 days of oral monotherapy with these drugs, and after 7 days concurrent administration of each of these betareceptor antagonists with cimetidine. Application of cimetidine did not lead to any interaction with atenolol, whereas mean peak plasma levels of metoprolol were increased by 70%, and those of propranolol by 95% due to concurrent administration of cimetidine (P less than 0.05). The plasma level time curve (AUC) of the two above-mentioned beta blockers behaved similarly (P less than 0.05). Other kinetic parameters of these two drugs were not influenced to a statistically significant extent by cimetidine, despite the tendency for the elimination half-life of metoprolol and propranolol to be prolonged when cimetidine is added. Measurement of exercise-induced tachycardia on the sixth day of administration showed no differences between monotherapy with the beta blockers and combined treatment with each of them together with cimetidine. Apart from one volunteer who complained of anxiety, weakness, and sweating on the sixth day of cimetidine/metoprolol administration, no adverse effects could be observed during the combination therapy with cimetidine and the beta blockers, nor during monotherapy with beta blockers.", 
    "51": "Chronic catecholamine stimulation in vivo of brown adipose tissue during acclimation of hamsters to cold does not result in any alteration of beta-adrenergic receptor number or affinity when determined in isolated adipocytes by (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding. Norepinephrine displacement of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol showed the same Ki for both groups. However, the slope of the displacement curve was shallower for cells from cold-acclimated animals than for controls. Cyclic AMP accumulation was stimulated by norepinephrine in cells from both groups of animals, although the dose-response curve for cells from cold-acclimated animals was shifted to the right and the maximum value obtained was less than half that found in cells from control animals. The slope of the curve was again lower. Other catecholamines stimulated cAMP accumulation with an order of potency in agreement with a response mediated through beta 1-adrenergic receptors. The dose-response curve for norepinephrine-stimulated oxygen consumption was also shifted to the right for cells from cold-acclimated animals, although the maximal respiration was only slightly reduced. The slope factor was again decreased. The results are interpreted in terms of a reduced coupling between the beta-receptor and the metabolic response in isolated brown adipocytes from cold-acclimated animals as a result of chronic catecholamine stimulation in vivo.", 
    "52": "Beta-Adrenergic agonists cause adenylate cyclase activation via a conformational change of their receptor. This was earlier revealed by the use of N-ethylmaleimide as a structural probe: agonist-bound receptors are rapidly inactivated by 0.1 mM N-ethylmaleimide while free and antagonist-bound receptors remain unaffected. Furthermore, the beta-adrenergic receptors only change conformation when coupled to the guanine nucleotide regulatory component of the adenylate cyclase system. It is shown in this report that treatment of turkey erythrocyte membranes with the sulphydryl-specific agent 2,2'-dinitro-5,5'-dithiodibenzoic acid and elevated concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide (1-10 mM) do not affect the total receptor number, but prevent the ability of beta-adrenergic agonists to mediate conformational changes. This effect is mimicked by GTP. These three compounds cause also a two- to four-fold decrease in agonist affinity. Both phenomena may be explained by the ability of the reagents to prevent, and of GTP to reverse, the functional coupling between the receptors and the regulatory component of the adenylate cyclase system. Removal of Mg2+ from the incubation medium (i.e. presence of 1 mM EDTA) produces a similar decrease in agonist affinity, but does not impair the ability of agonist/N-ethylmaleimide to inactivate the receptors. This suggests that Mg2+ increases the agonist affinity for the receptor-regulatory component complex, but is not required for its formation.", 
    "53": "Intra-arterial ambulatory blood pressure was measured over 24 hours, in 34 patients with newly diagnosed hypertension, both before and after double-blind randomisation to treatment with atenolol (n=9), metoprolol (n=9), pindolol (n=9), or propranolol in its slow-release form (n=7). The dosage of each drug was adjusted at monthly clinic visits until satisfactory control of blood pressure was achieved (140/90 mm Hg or less by cuff) or the maximum dose in the study protocol was reached. A second intra-arterial recording was made after these drugs had been taken once daily at 0800 for three to eight months (mean 5.0+/-SD 1.4) and was started four hours after the last dose.At the end of the 24-hour recordings blood pressure was significantly lower with all four drugs. The extent to which the drugs reduced blood pressure, however, differed over the 24 hours. Atenolol lowered mean arterial pressure significantly throughout all 24 recorded hours, metoprolol for 12 hours, pindolol for 15 hours, and slow-release propranolol for 22 hours. Neither metoprolol nor pindolol lowered blood pressure during sleep. A significant reduction in heart rate was observed over 20 hours with atenolol, 20 hours with metoprolol, 10 hours with pindolol, and 24 hours with slow-release propranolol. Atenolol, metoprolol, and slow-release propranolol continued to slow the heart rate 24 hours after the last tablet was taken; this effect on heart rate, however, was not sustained throughout the second morning in those patients taking atenolol. Pindolol, the only drug studied that has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, increased heart rate and did not lower blood pressure during sleep.Atenolol and slow-release propranolol are effective as antihypertensive agents over 24 hours when taken once daily, whereas metoprolol and pindolol may need to be taken more frequently. At times of low sympathetic tone, however, such as during sleep, beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may raise heart rate and attenuate the fall in blood pressure with treatment.", 
    "54": "The extent of phosphorylation of protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 in skeletal muscle rose about 2.5-fold during 60 min of perfusion of the rat hemicorpus preparation and then did not change over the following 30 min. Addition of insulin at 60 min resulted in a 35% fall in inhibitor-1 phosphorylation by 90 min. The rise in inhibitor-1 phosphorylation was due to the presence of catecholamines as evidenced by an accumulation of epinephrine in the perfusate. Removal of the adrenal glands or cannulation of the vena cava prevented the accumulation of epinephrine and the rise in inhibitor-1 phosphorylation. Insulin did not alter the phosphorylation state of inhibitor-1 in the presence of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol where the degree of phosphorylation was low (less than 10%) or at concentrations of isoproterenol (10 nM) where inhibitor-1 was highly phosphorylated (greater than 60%). In preparations with the adrenal glands removed, 0.5 nM isoproterenol produced a 2-fold rise in inhibitor-1 phosphorylation, an effect that was completely prevented by the addition of insulin. The antagonism of 0.5 nM idoproterenol by insulin correlated with a decrease in the muscle content of cyclic AMP. These results suggest that the dephosphorylation of inhibitor-1 may play an important role in the metabolic effects of insulin in vivo.", 
    "55": "In anesthetized dogs. YM-09538, a new sulfonamide-substituted phenylethylamine, competitively antagonised the phenylephrine-induced vasopressor response with a DR10 of 0.50 mg/kg i.v. and the isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic response with a DR10 of 0.66 mg/kg i.v., indicating that YM-09538 blocks both alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptors and almost to the same extent. YM-09538 was 4 times more potent than phentolamine in blocking alpha 1-adrenoceptors and 3 times less potent than propranolol in blocking beta 1-adrenoceptors. YM-09538 non-selectively blocked cardiac beta 1- and vascular beta 2-receptors and was devoid of intrinsic beta-sympathomimetic and local anesthetic activities. In anesthetized closed-chest dogs, YM-09538 resembled propranolol in reducing heart rate, cardiac output, max. dLVP/dt and left ventricular cardiac work but differed from propranolol in decreasing total peripheral resistance, in increasing femoral blood flow, in causing larger falls in arterial blood pressure and in decreasing pulmonary arterial pressure. In anesthetized open-chest dogs, YM-09538 reduced heart rate, myocardial contractile force and arterial blood pressure. In non-ischemic myocardium, transmural flow and coronary vascular resistance were respectively strongly increased and decreased and the endo/epi flow ratio was slightly but not significantly reduced. In ischemic myocardium, YM-09538 also increased transmural flow and since endocardial and epicardial flows were augmented to the same extent, the endo/epi flow ratio remained unchanged. All these hemodynamic and coronary effects of YM-09538 can be accounted for the drug's combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors blocking properties.", 
    "56": "We assessed the effects of exercise and beta-adrenoceptor blockade on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured by radionuclide ventriculography in nine patients with uncomplicated hyperthyroidism. Patients were studied in both the hyperthyroid and euthyroid states. The hyperthyroid state was characterized by a high LVEF at rest but--paradoxically--by a significant fall (P less than 0.01) in LVEF during exercise. At the same workload and at the same heart rate, patients had a restoration of the normal rise in LVEF during exercise when they were euthyroid. The LVEF was greater during exercise (P less than 0.02) when the patients were euthyroid than when they were hyperthyroid. Pretreatment with propranolol caused similar reductions in resting LVEF in the hyperthyroid and euthyroid states; the drug attenuated the rise in LVEF during exercise when the patients were euthyroid, but did not influence the exercise-induced reduction in LVEF in hyperthyroidism. The abnormal left ventricular function observed during exercise in hyperthyroidism suggests a reversible functional cardiomyopathy, independent of beta-adrenoceptor activation, that is presumably a direct effect of an excess in circulating thyroid hormones.", 
    "57": "In rabbits anesthetized with urethane, blood flow in the iris and the eye lid was 104.0 to 120.0 and 96.6 to 112.4 ml/min/100 g tissue (determined by the hydrogen clearance method), respectively. Dl-propranolol (1.0 mg/kg, i. v.) or phentolamine (0. 5 mg/kg, i. v.) decreased blood flow in both iris and eye lid to a similar degree, and also decreased blood pressure. Neither saline solution (0.5 ml/kg, i. v.) nor d-propranolol (1.0 mg/kg, i. v.) changed blood flow in both iris and eye lid and blood pressure. Labetalol (1.0 mg/kg, i. v.) decreased blood flow in the iris markedly and that in the eye lid moderately with a moderate decrease in blood pressure ; blood pressure/iris blood flow ratio increased significantly without changes in blood pressure/eye lid blood flow ratio. None of the drugs tested changed pupil size of the anesthetized rabbits. It is suggested that labetalol decreases iris blood flow because of blood pressure decrease plus other mechanisms that might be different from alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "58": "In rats, the pineal gland has a rhythm in the activity of the enzyme, N-acetyltransferase (NAT), which is thought responsible for daily cycles of melatonin synthesis. Neonatal rat pineal glands, but not those of adult rats, have a single cycle that is observed in vitro during the first day of organ culture. The neural regulation of the cycle was investigated using neonatal rats with adult rats used for comparison. Prior treatment of rat pups with constant light did not abolish the cycle in vitro though it did abolish the in vivo rhythm. Removal of the superior cervical ganglia did not abolish the in vivo rhythm that was measured the first day after surgery, but ablation of the ganglia did abolish the rhythm if several days or more elapsed after surgery. Extirpation of the superior cervical ganglia abolished the in vitro NAT cycle in pup pineal glands as did the pharmacological equivalent, injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. Propranolol, a beta blocking agent, prevented the occurrence of the cycle in vitro."
