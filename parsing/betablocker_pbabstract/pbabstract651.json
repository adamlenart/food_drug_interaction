The present study has investigated the effects of kynuramine and 5-hydroxykynuramine on the cardiovascular system of pithed rats and attempted to correlate effects seen on adrenergic and serotonergic receptors with ligand binding experiments done in vitro using rat brain membranes. Kynuramine was found to release cardiac catecholamines and to act as a weak partial agonist on vascular alpha-adrenoceptors. Hydroxylation in the 5-position (5-hydroxykynuramine) did not alter cardiac potency but increased pressor activity 100-fold. Vasopressor responses to 5-hydroxykynuramine were mediated via a dual agonistic action on both postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors and vascular serotonin2 receptors. These findings were supported by ligand binding studies, in which both kynuramine and 5-hydroxykynuramine showed affinity for cortical [3H]spiroperidol and [3H]clonidine binding sites. Overall, the results show that kynuramines can exert peripheral (and possibly central) actions which may prove to be of physiological and/or pharmacological significance.", 
    "1": "This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a timolol/bendrofluazide combination (Prestim) in mild to moderate essential hypertension in patients not achieving control of blood pressure on a variety of drugs used alone or in combination (methyldopa, diuretics, beta-blockers, etc.). Normotension (diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg) was achieved in sixty-eight out of eighty-four (81%) patients with a mean daily dose of 1.9 tablets. Seven patients stopped therapy because of adverse reactions and eight patients did not respond to the maximum dose of four tablets daily. One other patient, initially controlled on two tablet daily, was uncontrolled at the final assessment. The change-over from previous therapy to Prestim was easily managed and no reports of metabolic disturbance were received. Prestim proved an effective alternative in patients not responding satisfactorily to other antihypertensive therapies.", 
    "2": "An irreversible beta-adrenergic blocker, bromoacetylalprenololmenthane (BAAM), was administered both peripherally and centrally to turkey poults, Meleagris gallopavo. Peripheral administration of BAAM (60 mg/kg body weight) effected a significant reduction in blood pressure and heart rate. Twenty minutes postinjection, mean blood pressure and heart rate were reduced 34.5 and 24.2%, respectively. Two days later, mean blood pressure values remained significantly depressed at 17.3% below preinjection determinations. Biochemical analysis of heart tissue following peripheral (intraperitoneal) injections of BAAM (60 mg/kg body weight) showed a significant decrease in beta-adrenergic receptors (BAR). Little or no change in the number of BAR in brain tissue was observed. Central (intraventricular) administration of BAAM (0.72 mg/g brain weight) resulted in no change in mean blood pressure or heart rate during a 20 min postinjection period. Biochemical analysis of heart tissue following central injections of BAAM showed little or no change in the number of BAR. There was, however, a significant decrease in the number of BAR in brain tissue.", 
    "3": "In the spontaneously beating axolotl atrium, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) produced initial excitation followed by inhibition and then by a secondary excitation. This third phase of the ATP response was only seen in electrically driven preparations in the presence of 8-phenyltheophylline (8-PT), an adenosine receptor antagonist. alpha,beta-Methylene ATP (APCPP), a stable analogue of ATP, produced only excitatory effects, while adenosine and beta,gamma-methylene ATP (APPCP), a slowly degradable ATP analogue, produced inhibition or inhibition followed by excitation. 2-Chloroadenosine produced inhibition. The excitatory effects were not antagonized by 8-PT, indomethacin or propranolol and phentolamine. The negative inotropic responses of these compounds were antagonized by 8-PT and, with the exception of 2-chloroadenosine, potentiated by dipyridamole, an adenosine uptake blocker. In the ventricle, ATP, APCPP and APPCP produced positive inotropic effects, which were not affected by 8-PT, indomethacin or propranolol and phentolamine. Adenosine produced a negative inotropic effect which was not antagonized by 8-PT nor atropine nor potentiated by dipyridamole. The effects of adenyl compounds on the axolotl (urodele) heart suggest that, like the frog (anuran) heart, both P1- and P2-purinoceptors are present in the axolotl atrium and that only P2-purinoceptors are present in the axolotl ventricle, although adenosine does produce an inhibitory effect on the ventricle which is probably mediated via the release of a neurotransmitter other than acetylcholine.", 
    "4": "To study the mechanisms of the development of resistance to trauma, we examined the survival of a tumbling trauma using a Noble-Collip drum (40 rpm) by rats conditioned by sublethal drummings with and without prior administration of propranolol. The drum conditioning that consisted of four consecutive sublethal drummings (200, 350, 500, and 650 revolutions) induced increased resistance to an otherwise lethal drumming (800 revolutions) in rats without pretreatment of propranolol. Rats administered with propranolol 4 mg/kg intraperitoneally (ip) prior to each sublethal drumming showed a mortality of 22% after the lethal drumming which was significantly less than the mortality of 92% in nonconditioned rats pretreated with propranolol. This increased resistance to a lethal trauma in rats conditioned by drummings with concurrent administration of propranolol was confirmed in another lot of rats. These results indicated that prior administration of propranolol 4 mg/kg ip did not inhibit the induction of trauma resistance by repeated sublethal drummings, suggesting the existence of a mechanism unaffected by this dose of propranolol.", 
    "5": "The regulation of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen breakdown in human skeletal muscle has been investigated using the needle biopsy technique. Preliminary studies showed that the activity of phosphorylase in vitro was dependent upon the concentration of inorganic phosphate (Pi) used in the assay system. The Km of phosphorylase a for Pi was found to be 26.2 mmol/l, and that of (a+b) (assayed in the presence of saturating AMP) was 6.8 mmol/l. Because of the difference in Km the apparent percentage of a to (a+b) activity varies with the Pi concentration used in the assay system. Phosphorylase a and (a+b) activities were therefore adjusted to saturating Pi concentrations. The ratio of the activities in this case is independent of the Pi concentration and constitutes a minimal estimate of the fraction of phosphorylase molecules in the a form. The fraction of phosphorylase in the a form in resting muscle was as a mean 22%. Despite nearly a quarter of the phosphorylase being in the a form glycogenolytic activity is extremely low. It is proposed that the concentration of Pi at the active site of the enzyme is low compared to the Km for this of either form of the enzyme, and is limiting to activity. A Pi concentration in resting muscle of 1-3 mmol/l was calculated. During epinephrine infusion at rest 90% of the phosphorylase was transformed to the a form but only a moderate increase in the glycogenolytic rate occurred. This rate approximated to 5-10% of the maximum rate of the enzyme (Vmaxa). During prolonged epinephrine infusion the glycogenolytic rate decreased despite the continuance of 90% or more of the phosphorylase in the a form. In contrast to epinephrine infusion prolonged ischemia resulted in a decrease in the mole fraction of phosphorylase a and simultaneously in an increase of the glycogenolytic rate. During isometric and dynamic exercise there was a rapid transformation of phosphorylase b to a paralleled by pronounced increase in the rate of glycogen breakdown. The increased rate of glycogenolysis during isometric exercise was close to the Vmax of phosphorylase a in vivo. When either form of exercise was continued to fatigue/exhaustion, a re-transformation of phosphorylase a to b was observed. During dynamic exercise cAMP in the muscle increased two fold. This increase was blocked by the prior administration of propranolol.+", 
    "6": "The effects of iontophoretically applied putative neurotransmitters and their antagonists on the responses of retinal ganglion cells were studied in the optically intact eye of anaesthetized cats. L-aspartate enhanced and a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blocker, 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, blocked visual excitations of \"sustained\" cells, whereas acetylcholine enhanced, and the nicotinic receptor blocker, dihydro-beta-erythroidine, blocked those of \"transient\" cells. GABA enhanced and bicuculline blocked inhibitions of on-centre cells, but glycine enhanced and strychnine blocked those of off-centre cells, whether the cells were \"sustained\" or \"transient\". The possibility that: (A) aspartate may be an excitatory transmitter at both \"on-\" and \"off-sustained\" cells and acetylcholine, at both \"on-\" and \"off-transient\" cells; (B) GABA may be an inhibitory transmitter for on-centre, and glycine, for off-centre cells, is discussed.", 
    "7": "The effects on central hemodynamics and skeletal muscle metabolism during surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm were compared in 6 patients given a preoperative adrenergic block (group B) and in 6 patients who additionally had a temporary brachio-femoro-femoral by-pass during the aortic clamping (group B + S). The cardiac output, heart rate, arterial and pulmonary artery pressures and the cardiac filling pressure were studied. Biopsy specimens from the lateral vastus muscle and blood samples from the radial artery and the iliac vein were taken before aortic clamping and also before and 30 minutes, 4 and 16 hours after the aortic declamping. Intramuscular temperature and pH were measured. The glycogen, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, ATP, ADP, AMP, phosphocreatine (PCr) and creatine (Cr) contents of the muscle and the lactate and pyruvate concentration in iliac venous and radial arterial blood were determined, using enzymatic fluorometric techniques. In group B, aortic clamping induced severe temporary incomplete ischemia with a 300% increase in lactate/pyruvate (L/P) ratio and a fall in intramuscular pH (pHm). The adenylate energy charge (EC) decreased, but the creatine (PCr + CR) and the adenylate (ATP + ADP + AMP) pool remained unchanged. After aortic declamping, the L/P ratio, EC and pHm regained their preclamping values, but the pools of energy phosphate compounds were reduced, indicating dysfunction or damage of the muscle cells. In group B + S there were no major muscle metabolic changes during clamping or after declamping of the aorta. In group B the systemic vascular resistance (SVR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and left ventricular stroke work (LVSW) increased during the occlusion. On release of the clamp, cardiac output rose, possibly due to the sudden reduction of SVR. A temporary marked fall of MAP occurred. In group B + S, no increase of SVR, MAP or LVSW was observed during aortic clamping. After the declamping, only a minor MAP drop was observed. In both groups, a brief rise in pulmonary vascular resistance after the aortic declamping suggested transient pulmonary microembolism. If a high-risk patient is to undergo reconstructive surgery of the abdominal aorta and/or technical difficulties can be expected to necessitate prolonged cross-clamping during the operation, a temporary extracorporeal by-pass may be a favorable adjuvant, improving cardiac performance and preventing derangement of muscle metabolism.", 
    "8": "There is now evidence that infarct size in man can be reduced by early treatment and that some cases of threatened infarction can be aborted. Beta blockade, given intravenously within about 6-8 hours after the onset of pain can reduce infarct size and abort some infarctions. So far we have no conclusive data on mortality. Beta blockers may act by a number of mechanisms, namely reduction of cardiac contractility, heart rate and blood pressure thus reducing cardiac work and oxygen requirement, prevention of cardiac rupture by the same mechanism, and by an early effect on R on T ectopic beats and hence serious ventricular arrhythmia. Early myocardial revascularization either by coronary graft, percutaneous angioplasty or intracoronary streptokinase are all promising but so far unproven by adequate clinical trial. Randomized trials suggest that intravenous streptokinase may be effective and hyaluronidase appears promising, possibly by promotion of collateral vessel flow. Calcium channel blockade may also be helpful and there are some early studies which support this. Lowering work by sodium nitroprusside also reduces infarct size. Heparin may have a place in the treatment of threatened infarction. After recovery it now appears established that beta 1-blockade will lower mortality. We do not know how long this effect persists. Other agents are less well established perhaps because the trials have been too small. Anticoagulants may have a place but their use is not widespread. Anti-platelet agents are also controversial. Studies of dipyridamole and sulphinpyrazone have been suggestive but not conclusive; the studies of aspirin are moderately encouraging, when all trials are pooled. Anti-arrhythmic therapy after infarction has been disappointing, with the exception of beta blockade. Perhaps more emphasis should also be put upon changes in lifestyle, notably stopping smoking, reduction of fat intake and encouraging regular exercise.", 
    "9": "Evidence is reviewed showing that calcium-channel blockers can be added to beta-blockers in patients with ischaemic heart disease providing that the patients have a reasonable left ventricular function. The combination may prove useful in treating hypertension.", 
    "10": "The acute and long-term haemodynamic effects of pindolol, practolol, alprenolol, oxprenolol, acebutolol, penbutolol, metoprolol, atenolol, propranolol and timolol in patients with uncomplicated hypertension as reported in the literature were analysed. The long-term effects of these beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on plasma renin activity and the concentration of noradrenaline in plasma were also reviewed. In spite of the many pharmacological and physicochemical differences the drugs appeared to have a hypotensive effect of approximately equal magnitude. The degree of cardiodepression and the suppression of plasma renin activity as exerted by the different beta-blockers were inversely correlated with their pharmacologically defined degree of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). The increments in vascular resistance acutely after administration of a beta-blocker are proportional to the degree of cardiodepression, suggesting that increased vasoconstrictor nerve activity mediated through the baroreflex had prevented an acute fall in arterial pressure in response to a given fall in cardiac output. After long-term therapy the inverse correlation between changes in cardiac output and changes in vascular resistance is shifted to a lower level of vascular resistance. Plasma renin activity and vascular resistance are inversely correlated during long-term beta-blocker therapy for hypertension. Consequently, the fall in vascular resistance underlying the hypotensive effect of beta-blockers cannot be explained by suppression of plasma renin activity. Thus, cardiodepression and renin suppression are not essential for the hypotensive effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. The accessibility of the central nervous system to the different beta-blockers neither determines the time of onset of blood pressure reduction nor the magnitude of this effect. If it is neither the blockade of postsynaptic beta-adrenoceptors in the heart or on juxtaglomerular cells, nor the blockade of central beta-receptors that can be held responsible for the blood pressure lowering efficacy of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, one is left with the remaining possibility that blockade of presynaptic beta-receptors underlies the vasodilator and antihypertensive action of these drugs. Changes in the concentrations of noradrenaline in plasma are compatible with this supposition, provided that changes in clearance of noradrenaline from plasma are taken into account.", 
    "11": "Angina pectoris can be classified from the history into several different entities such as exercise-induced angina, angina at rest and nocturnal angina. Angina is a symptom with many causes. Several groups of drugs and cardiac surgery can provide effective treatment. Exercise-induced angina usually responds to treatment with beta-blockers and nitrates. A calcium-channel blocker or nitrate is probably the best initial treatment for angina associated with vasoconstriction of the coronary arteries. No simple relationship exists between the clinical presentation, the pathological cause and the appropriate treatment.", 
    "12": "The dose-response curves of the beta-adrenergic agonists isoprenaline (mixed beta 1 and beta 2), prenalterol (beta 1-selective), noradrenaline (more beta 1 than beta 2) and salbutamol (beta 2-selective) were studied on adipose cells of the rat, in vitro. The observed lipolytic potencies were in the order: isoprenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than salbutamol greater than prenalterol. The effects of beta-adrenergic antagonists betaxolol (beta 1-selective) propranolol (non-selective) and ICI 118551 (beta 2-selective) on lipolysis stimulated by the various beta-adrenergic agonists showed that in each case propranolol was the most potent blocking agent. These observations are not compatible with the concept that regulation of lipolysis in adipose tissue is mediated exclusively either by adrenergic receptors of the classical beta 1 type, or of the classical beta 2 type. We propose therefore, that this beta-adrenergic receptor, because of its non-compliance with the current classification system, be termed a 'beta-3' or beta-hybrid' adrenoceptor. Thus cardio-selective beta-adrenergic blocking agents, like betaxolol, may offer a hitherto unrecognized clinical advantage in obese patients undergoing anti-hypertensive therapy by offering a reduced impediment to hormone-induced utilization of calorie stores in adipose tissue.", 
    "13": "Administration of a beta-blocker, pindolol, was utilized in the premedication of patients selected for tonsillectomies (dissection), to study anxiolytic effects. A curious result observed was that bleeding during and after operation in patients on pindolol was remarkably reduced compared to those not on beta-blocker treatment. This effect was further explored in a small controlled study. Nineteen patients were given pindolol, 5 mg the evening before and on the morning, an hour prior to surgery. Seventeen controls were on placebos. The amount of bleeding was measured in both groups. Patients on pindolol show significantly reduced bleeding when compared to controls (1.77 +/- 1.15 ml versus 7.30 +/- 6.05 ml; p less than 0.005). Coagulation and fibrinolytic profiles were studied in a number of patients in both groups attempting to clarify the cause of the reduced bleeding. The results will be reported. This preliminary study shows that pindolol is a useful drug for controlling bleeding in tonsillectomies. To our knowledge the haemostatic properties of pindolol have been reported before.", 
    "14": "Heart rate (HR), blood pressure and systolic time intervals (STI), including total electromechanical systole (QS2), left ventricular ejection time (LVETc), pre-ejection period (PEPc), the PEP/LVET index and the time to the peak of carotid upstroke (Ut), were measured in 24 patients with moderate essential hypertension after 15 days of treatment with oral furosemide (F), hydrochlorothiazide (H), propranolol (P), atenolol (A), furosemide + propranolol (F + P) and hydrochlorothiazide + propranolol (H + P). Except F, all treatments significantly reduced blood pressure; maximal reductions were brought about by A and H + P. The heart rate was most reduced by A. THe QS2c interval was reduced only after F and H, LVETc was significantly reduced by H, A and H + P. Drug combinations prolonged PEPc, while the PEP/LVET index was increased only by H + P. Beta-blockers significantly prolonged the Ut. It is concluded that diuretics shorten QS2c mainly through reduction in blood volume. The H + P combination diminishes contractility and cardiac output and should not be employed in heart failure.", 
    "15": "Adrenalin (5.0 X 10(-5) M) increases gill vascular resistance up to 23.2 +/- 6.8% in the isolated and perfused head of the european eel (Anguilla anguilla L.). This vasoactive response is nearly abolished by the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent phentolamine mesylate (5.0 X 10(-5) M), while it is increased by the beta-blocker propranolol (5.0 X 10(-4) M). From these results it may be inferred that, in our experimental conditions, the major response to the catecholamine is a vasoconstriction mediated via alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "16": "Octopamine and synephrine were observed to effect the spontaneous rhythmic contractions displayed by the isolated ventral nerve cord of the earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris. octopamine and synephrine produced dose-dependent significant changes in the frequency, amplitude and basal tonus of the spontaneous contractions. Application of adrenergic receptor antagonists suggested the octopamine receptors to have some similarity to vertebrate alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. The spontaneous contractions were not abolished by tetrodotoxin (TTX) which suggested a myogenic origin for the contraction of the ventral nerve cord sheath muscles. Octopamine, in the presence of TTX, increased the basal tonus and maximum force of the spontaneous contractions.", 
    "17": "Research over the last 25 years established the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system's important role in electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis as well as in the pathophysiology of hypertension for which renin suppressive drugs, angiotensin antagonists and converting enzyme inhibitors provided selective pharmacological tools. Pharmacological interference with the renin-angiotensin axis in addition to reducing angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction reduces angiotensin's effect on aldosterone, alpha-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction and central activation of sympathetic nerve activity. Renin measurements serve as an endocrine marker for the activity and reactivity of the sympathetic nervous system reflecting a beta-adrenoceptor mediated response which tends to decrease with older age. Therefore, as younger the patient and as higher pretreatment renin as better the antihypertensive response to converting enzyme inhibitors and betablockers is. As lower renin and as older the age diuretic agents and calcium antagonists are more effective, the hyporesponsive renin being a co-determinant of pressure response in these patients.", 
    "18": "In 32 patients with angina of effort, the antianginal effects and action duration of propranolol, atenolol, labetalol and nadolol were compared during the exercise test after a single dose of the drug. Atenolol and nadolol have been ascertained to be effective long acting antianginal drugs. Except the antianginal effect duration, the above mentioned beta-blockers have not been found to be superior to propranolol, including to atenolol, to its effect on the total peripheral vascular resistance. Labetalol provided a sufficient antianginal effect in a number of patients, including those in whom propranolol was not effective enough. It have been found that high incidence of side effects makes it inexpedient to use high doses of labetalol (more than 200 mg) in patients with angina pectoris who have normal blood pressure.", 
    "19": "A complex study of changes of hemodynamics and myocardial performance was conducted while treating 215 hypertensive patients with obsidan (propranolol), corgard, a cardioselective beta-blocker tenormine and alpha- and beta-blocker trandate. Different hypotensive efficiency and varying hemodynamic mechanisms of its action were found. Obsidan and corgard were mainly efficient in moderate hypertension and marked hypersympathicotonia. Tenormine and trandate produce the most marked hypotensive effect (due to reduction in the vascular tone). The signs of increase in venous blood return to the heart during trandate and obsidan therapy and decrease in venous return after long-term tenormine therapy were established. Myocardial contractility indices decreased after obsidan therapy to the more extent than after corgard and tenormine, and they did not change after trandate. The possibility of myocardial hypertrophy regression was shown (especially in the long-term treatment with tenormine and trandate). A reduction in intramyocardial tension has been stated to depend mainly on hemodynamic factors (reduction in volume or pressure overload on the myocardium) whereas the diminution of the myocardial mass also depends on neurohumoral effects.", 
    "20": "It is known that the heart will adapt to actual demand by increasing or decreasing its size through different mechanisms. In this presentation, the possible role of catecholamines in regulating heart protein synthesis and developing cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy is discussed. Injecting animals with catecholamines has been found to induce cardiac hypertrophy. In vitro perfusion of rat heart in the presence of catecholamines has been found to induce a time-dependent and dose-dependent stimulation of amino acid transport and incorporation into proteins. Acute haemodynamic effects of catecholamines increase cardiac performance while long-term treatment seems to cause depression of cardiac function, especially during ischaemic conditions. Chronic beta-blockade in patients with primary congestive cardiomyopathy improved both cardiac function and clinical condition in more than half the patients. Furthermore, a beneficial effect on survival was also found, when compared with a matched control group. It is hypothesised that catecholamines may play a role in developing cardiac hypertrophy as well as congestive cardiomyopathy.", 
    "21": "Three long-term, randomised trials examining antihypertensive treatment with either diuretics or beta-blockers are in progress. On the basis of these, the following conclusions may be drawn regarding metabolic side-effects. Diuretics decrease whereas beta-blockers increase serum potassium. Neither drug has any obvious influence on total body potassium. Serum urate increases on both drugs but more so in those taking diuretics. Serum triglycerides increase while total serum cholesterol is unchanged in both treatments. It is still a matter of controversy whether there is a decrease in glucose tolerance and an increase in the incidence of diabetes in patients on diuretics. The possible negative influence of metabolic side-effects on morbidity and mortality may limit the beneficial effects of blood pressure reduction, especially in patients with low pressures before treatment. Thus, it seems crucial to minimise theses side-effects. Since they are dose-related for both diuretics and beta-blockers, the use of low doses and, if needed, combination treatment is preferable.", 
    "22": "The radioligand binding technique has been proven useful in the study of altered responsiveness after exposure to adrenergic agents. A reduction in receptor number has generally been reported after interventions serving to increase the stimulatory input to the receptors prior to assay. Conversely a decrease in receptor stimulation has been demonstrated to induce an elevation in receptor density. These phenomena have been described for alpha- as well as for beta-adrenoceptors in various tissues under a variety of experimental conditions such as prolonged agonist exposure, chronic receptor blockade, denervation and interference with catecholamine turnover. A number of clinically relevant cardiovascular experimental models have been characterized by altered adrenoceptor densities, possibly reflecting a compensatory resetting of sympathetic tone in response to an aberrant haemodynamic pattern. The mechanisms underlying receptor density changes as those discussed have been suggested to involve an internalization process which may involve phospholipase and transglutaminase activation in the cell membrane.", 
    "23": "The use of beta-blockers in diabetes mellitus has largely been restricted because of the reported adverse effects. Clinical investigations aimed at elucidating the possible reactions associated with the use of beta-blockers have disclosed no evidence of masking or signs or insulin-induced hypoglycaemia or potentiation of the insulin effect. Prolonged hypoglycaemia may develop, however, as a result of physical effort. There is no proof that during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia the concentrations of counter-regulatory hormones are depressed, but that of glycerol, a gluconeogenic precursor, is slightly diminished. Intensification of the hypertensive reaction during hypoglycaemia is less likely to occur during treatment with beta-selective blockers. In insulin-dependent diabetics receiving beta 1-blockers there is no evidence of any change - either deterioration or improvement - in metabolic control. In one small controlled trial there was no sign of impairment of the peripheral arterial circulation over a short period of administration of a non-selective beta-blocker. In general, for patients suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes, cardioselective agents are preferable. Since cardioselectivity is a dose-dependent property, reasonable caution should also be observed when using this type of drug in diabetes.", 
    "24": "The metabolic effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents during hypoglycaemia in patients prone to hypoglycaemia are of interest as diabetics are often treated with these drugs because of hypertension or angina pectoris. Compared with non-diabetics these patients also have impaired glucose compensation after hypoglycaemia, partly secondary to deficient release of glucagon. This makes the diabetics more dependent on adrenergic mechanisms to recover from low blood glucose concentrations. Non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol) significantly impairs the glucose recovery rate after hypoglycaemia in insulin dependent diabetics, whereas selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade (metoprolol) does not have this side effect. The mechanism of the effect of propranolol is probably an attenuation of the gluconeogenesis secondary to deficient release of the important gluconeogenic substrates lactate and glycerol.", 
    "25": "This paper assesses mechanisms that may contribute to the higher incidence of increased muscle fatigue during exercise and reduced exercise performance as observed with selective compared with non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Published data and the results obtained in 8 healthy subjects (mean age 23 years) studied before and after acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade with pindolol (nonselective, 10 mg) and metoprolol (beta 1-receptor selective, 100 mg) suggest that the differences in the cardiovascular and respiratory effects between the 2 types of antagonists are marginal and cannot explain the discrepancies concerning exercise perception and performance. Conversely, basic differences between the 2 types of antagonists were shown in different groups of hypertensive men (mean age 32 years) studied before and after 4 weeks of treatment with pindolol (15 mg), and with metoprolol (200 mg) and acebutolol (cardioselective, 500 mg), by single crossover technique. Whereas lipolysis was similarly inhibited by both selective and non-selective antagonists, hypoglycaemia occurred only under non-selective blockade. It apparently reflects the inhibition of glycogen breakdown; concomitant rises in plasma adrenaline and ACTH probably reflect counter-regulatory mechanisms.", 
    "26": "beta-adrenoceptor antagonists influence almost all haemodynamic and metabolic actions in the body. High levels of sympathetic stimulation accompany aerobic exercise and it is known that beta-blockade results in a decreased working capacity. Furthermore it has also been questioned whether beta-blockade inhibits the normal response to physical training. Although adrenergic mechanisms are involved in muscle and liver glycogen breakdown, beta-blockade does not seem to reduce glycogen utilisation during exercise. Both selective and non-selective beta-blockade inhibit lipolysis and result in less free fatty acids being available for muscle utilisation. Surgical and chemical sympathectomy in animals has been shown to inhibit the responses to physical training but results are now available showing that beta-adrenergic blockade does not prevent the effect of physical conditioning in patients treated with propranolol. It is concluded that beta-blockade during prolonged exercise a) does not reduce oxygen uptake by the working muscles b) decreases fat metabolism, which secondarily increases the use of carbohydrates, resulting in earlier hypoglycaemia and/or depletion of muscle glycogen with reduction in working capacity c) does not inhibit central and peripheral adaptation to physical conditioning.", 
    "27": "Adrenergic receptors are ubiquitous and mediate several important effects involving lipid metabolism. Thus, beta-adrenergic stimulation increases lipolysis and inhibits the activity of the lipoprotein lipase. In contrast, alpha-adrenergic stimulation inhibits fat cell lipid mobilisation. Unexpectedly, beta-adrenergic blockade increases plasma triglyceride levels and tends to lower the high density lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol). These effects seem to be prevented or attenuated by concomitant alpha-blockade. Possible mechanisms for the adrenergic effect on lipid metabolism are reviewed.", 
    "28": "This survey discloses the main mechanisms regulating renin release from the kidneys. Stimulation or inhibition of renin at least during a normal sodium intake seems to depend mostly on the sympathetic nervous system and be mediated through beta 1-adrenoceptors. The suppression of renin release is maintained during long-term treatment with both selective (beta 1) and non-selective (beta 1 + beta 2)-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. The role of alpha-adrenoceptors on renin release is less clear, both stimulating and suppressive effects having been described after treatment with alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking therapy (i.e. prazosin). In certain conditions, i.e. when renal vascular resistance is increased or renal perfusion pressure augmented, renal prostaglandins (PG) especially PGE2, may play an important part in renin release. Angiotensin II (A II) and aldosterone generally follow the shifts in renin release. Thus, a decrease in both A II and plasma aldosterone is seen during long-term treatment with beta-adrenoceptor-blockade and may contribute to the blood-pressure lowering effect of these drugs.", 
    "29": "This paper reviews the various possible relationships between thyroid hormones and the adrenergic nervous system. These concern the sympathetic influence on thyroid hormone secretion, thyroid hormone - induced changes of sympathetic activity or adrenoceptor changes - the effects of catecholamines on thyroid hormone metabolism and, finally, the clinical benefits of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs on symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism.", 
    "30": "Insulin release is influenced by the autonomic nervous system. In the periphery the regulation occurs via both alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors. The parasympathetic nervous system is important in the central regulation of insulin secretion. Nevertheless, adrenergic mechanisms are also concerned. This review discusses the mechanisms for the adrenergic regulation of insulin release and some clinical conditions where these mechanisms are concerned.", 
    "31": "A moderate increase in serum potassium concentrations has been observed in several controlled clinical trials with beta-blockers. This increase cannot be explained by the retention of potassium in the organism, and is probably caused by the redistribution of potassium from intracellular to extracellular compartments. beta-adrenergic mechanisms seem to be concerned in the extrarenal handling of the potassium-load in man, presumably by inducing an increased uptake of potassium in muscular cells and liver cells. These beta-adrenergic mechanisms are probably of the beta 2-type. In theory there are several conditions in which it is important to have a defence against hyperkalaemia from exogenous or endogenous sources for example, during heavy physical exercise, after a potassium-rich meal, or after traumatic tissue damage. Available data indicate that non-selective beta-blockade increases serum potassium concentrations during and after heavy exercise and during coronary bypass. The clinical implications of these findings are unknown.", 
    "32": "Catecholamines induce hypokalaemia via stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors, primarily in skeletal muscle but also in other tissues. This is the result of increased active Na+-K+-transport, leading to a rise in the intracellular K+/Na+-ratio and hyperpolarisation in muscle cells. These effects are mediated by 3', 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate, can be detected down to physiological concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline, and are seen both in vitro and in vivo. Catecholamines released from the adrenal medulla as well as sympathetic nerve endings are of importance in clearing K+ from the extracellular water space during K+-loading or exercise. beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists can be used in the treatment of hyperkalaemia, and beta-adrenoceptor blockade may induce hyperkalaemia, in particular during exercise. The effects of catecholamines on the contractile performance of skeletal muscles are partly due to stimulation of the active electrogenic Na+-K+-transport across the sarcolemma.", 
    "33": "Micturition difficulties and urinary retention are common complications after abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. Adrenergic receptors are located in the bladder neck and proximal urethra, and blocking these receptors with alpha-blockers such as phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline) may improve micturition and prevent postoperative urinary retention. In a randomized clinical trial, 51 patients who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, received a prophylactic dose of Dibenzyline 10 micrograms orally 6-8 hours after operation and again the next day about 18 hours later. Only 2 of the 51 patients were found to have urinary retention, in comparison with 9 of 48 patients in the control group (p less than 0.05). Another group of patients who underwent vaginal hysterectomy were treated according to the same protocol. Eight of the 30 patients in this study group required catheterization to drain the overdistended bladder, in comparison with 16 of 26 patients in the control group (p less than 0.025). It seems from this clinical trial that prophylactic treatment with Dibenzyline is recommended after abdominal hysterectomy or vaginal operation in order to improve micturition and prevent urinary retention.", 
    "34": "Beta adrenoceptor blocking drugs are relatively well tolerated and adverse reactions to them are not common. The ones that do occur are reviewed in this paper under the following headings: Short term adverse reactions, drug interactions, long term adverse reactions, risks in pregnancy and hazards of abrupt withdrawal. Predictable short term effects may be caused either by the actions of these drugs on the beta 1- or beta 2-receptors. The beta 1 adverse effects are hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure; these are best avoided by not giving beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs to susceptible patients with cardiac disease. The beta 2 adverse effects on the bronchi, the peripheral arteries and various metabolic functions may be reduced to some extent by using a relatively cardioselective drug. Unpredictable short term effects such as fatigue, sexual dysfunction and gastrointestinal symptoms may occur but are not common problems with this group of drugs. Similarly, serious drug interactions are infrequent. Under the heading of long term adverse effects the practolol problem and the risk of causing malignant disorders have been considered. There is no evidence that any of the currently available drugs will cause either a practolol syndrome or malignant disease in man. However, the need for careful appraisal by drug regulatory bodies and continued vigilance by all prescribers of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs remains. The possible adverse effects of treatment during pregnancy are also considered. It now appears that beta-adrenoceptor drugs can be used safely in pregnancy but since neonatal bradycardia and hypoglycemia may occur, care should be taken to look for these complications. A serious deterioration may occur when beta-adrenoceptor drugs, given to patients with significant ischemic heart disease, are suddenly stopped. This is a rare occurrence but prescribers should be aware of it.", 
    "35": "It has been found that ATP-ase activity increases considerably in the heart after intravenous administration of adrenaline, noradrenaline, phenylephrine (50 micrograms/kg), phentolamine, atropine, and also after vagotomy and adrenaline given after vagotomy. In the skeletal muscle ATP-ase activity increases considerably after noradrenaline, isoprenaline, phenylephrine (50 micrograms/kg), adrenaline given after phentolanine and Ach given after denervation of the muscle. A decrease in the activity of the enzyme in the heart was found after propranolol hexamethonium and Ach given after vagotomy, whereas in the skeletal muscle after Ach, hexamethonium and after muscle denervation. No changes or weak actions in the skeleton muscle are evoked by phenylephrine (10 micrograms/kg), propranolol, atropine, tubokurarine as well as adrenaline given after muscle denervation. In the heart, however, isoprenaline, Ach, adrenaline after propranolol, Ach after atropine and Ach after hexamethonium. A very low involvement of the enzyme studied in utilization of ATP reserves in the heart and skeletal muscle was found. However, of significant importance in this process may be the reactions catalized by extramembrane ATP-ases. The autonomic nervous system effects ATP-ase activity, and stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptor causes an increase in the enzyme activity in both muscles, whereas stimulation of the muskarine receptor decreases the enzyme activity in the heart. Moreover, it was found that stimulation of N2 receptor of the motor plate results in increased ATP-ase activity in the skeletal muscle. The present studies have not brought enough evidence accounting for participation of alpha-adrenergic receptor in regulation of the enzyme studied.", 
    "36": "A review of the relevant literature indicates that the effects of beta-blockers on cardiac output and plasma renin or penetration of these drugs into the brain and cerebrospinal fluid are not essential for their antihypertensive effect. Reduction in blood pressure during long-term beta-blocker therapy is always associated with reduction of total peripheral resistance. Evidence is presented which suggests that blockade of presynaptic beta-receptors underlies this vasodilator effect of beta-blockers.", 
    "37": "Comparison of hypertensive patients receiving no treatment with subjects of the same age reveals the presence of antinuclear antibodies in twice as many of the former as the latter. Various antihypertensive drugs increase this prevalence. They may induce iatrogenic lupus. Alpha-methyldopa: the frequency of antinuclear bodies is three times greater than in untreated hypertensive patients. However there are no reported cases of clinical symptomatology of induced lupus. Beta-blockers. Practolol, acebutolol, labetalol, atenolol, timolol, metoprolol, pindolol and oxprenolol are suspected of increasing antinuclear antibodies. These drugs may be weak inducers of iatrogenic lupus when compared with major drugs: procainamide, high doses of hydralazine and D-penicillamine.", 
    "38": "Simultaneous treatment with antidiabetic drugs and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents is frequent on account of the high incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The effects of oral doses of pindolol, metoprolol, and propranolol on the response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and an oral glucose load were investigated. During hypoglycemia metoprolol and propranolol inhibited the clearance of insulin (2 p less than 0.01) and caused a delay of glucose nadirs. This was not observed after pindolol. Epinephrine secretion and the counterregulatory response of growth hormone, ACTH and cortisol during hypoglycemia was significantly increased following metoprolol and propranolol but not after pindolol. The hypoglycemic symptoms and signs showed a prevalence of sweating and prolonged changes in skin conductivity while palpitations were not observed during beta-blockade. Asymptomatic hypoglycemia did not occur.", 
    "39": "Early trials of beta-blocking drugs in angina indicated an increase in symptoms above pretreatment levels when placebo was substituted for active drug. In addition there were reports of sudden death after beta-blockade withdrawal. There is evidence of increased beta-receptor sensitivity as demonstrated by increased responsiveness to isoprenaline after propranolol withdrawal. This may be due to increased beta-receptor population. Other factors may be a reversal of the reduced free triiodothyronine levels or of the favourable rightward shift of oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, or increased platelet aggregation when the beta-blocking drug is stopped. Also, progression of the disease process may have taken place during treatment which is unmasked on withdrawal. Studying different beta-blocking agents we have observed that in normal volunteers withdrawal of pindolol, which has partial agonist properties, was not associated with post blockade increase in response to isoprenaline. The beta-blocker withdrawal syndrome is a real phenomenon, although overall the incidence is probably not high. Exertion may be a prerequisite for the development of significant clinical sequelae, therefore exercise should be restricted on withdrawal of beta-blocking drugs. The dosage should be reduced gradually, particularly the final decrement.", 
    "40": "A review is presented of the effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents on lipolysis in adipose tissue. Considerable species differences appear to exist between the pharmacological characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors in adipocytes of rat, guinea pig, dog, cat, swine and man. Human adipocyte beta-adrenoceptors probably consist of two subtypes; insufficient data are available to ascertain whether they represent \"classical\" beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors or atypical receptors similar but not identical to those in the rat. In vivo studies in man suggest that non-cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents are more effective antilipolytic agents than cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. No clinical evidence could be found to suggest that the quantitative differences in antilipolytic potency between cardioselective and non-cardioselective agents have more than speculative significance.", 
    "41": "Several studies show that many selective and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs and beta-blockers with weak intrinsic sympathomimetic activity increase serum total cholesterol and triglyceride and decrease HDL-cholesterol and free fatty acid concentrations. The concentrations of serum free fatty acids and triglycerides remained about constant during twelve months treatment of hypertensive patients with pindolol. The level of HDL-cholesterol was increased after the first month of treatment, but there were no significant differences between the concentrations of HDL-cholesterol before the treatment and after three, six and twelve months of treatment. The ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol increased from 0.18 to 0.20 during treatment, and this increase was statistically significant at six month. The concentration of apolipoprotein A-I and the ratio of A-I to apoprotein A-II increased slightly but not significantly during pindolol treatment. Lecithin cholesterol acyl-transferase activity was significantly higher during pindolol treatment than after three weeks break of treatment. Comparing the results of the study of pindolol with previous reports of other beta-blockers pindolol might have fewer untoward effects on lipid metabolism than beta-blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.", 
    "42": "It is certain that atherosclerosis is multi-factorial. Amongst the numerous risk factors two are particularly important: hypertension and primary or secondary abnormalities of plasma lipids and lipoproteins (high levels of total cholesterol, LDL and VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides or VLDL triglycerides, apoprotein B, low levels of HDL cholesterol, apoprotein A1 and probably HDL2). On the basis of a general review of the literature, the authors evaluate the changes in lipids, lipoproteins and apoproteins induced by different beta-blockers. Overall, the most constant and most obvious (particularly in hyperlipidaemic patients) disturbances combine an increase in total triglycerides or VLDL triglycerides and a fall in HDL cholesterol. There is little change in total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol. Side effects seen with most beta-blockers, cardioselective or not, differ in degree from one drug to another. They are particularly marked with some (propranolol) while they are virtually absent with others (pindolol). The mechanism of action is discussed (essentially inhibition of extra-hepatic lipoprotein lipase activity). These findings would seem to lead to the following practical conclusions: 1) Before starting antihypertensive treatment it is important to confirm lipid and lipoprotein levels, particularly bearing in mind the epidemiological links between moderate essential hypertension and lipoprotein abnormalities, especially those with a component of hypertriglyceridaemia. 2) Lipid profile including estimation by precipitation of HDL cholesterol must be studied during antihypertensive therapy and if there is a marked and confirmed deterioration towards an \"increased atherogenicity\", it is reasonable to envision a change of the antihypertensive agent. With the some efficacy on blood pressure levels and general tolerance, the choice should favour drugs having the least unfavourable effects on lipoprotein metabolism.", 
    "43": "At the present time, the mortality during the first year following an acute myocardial infarction is in the order of 10%. It subsequently drops to 4 or 5% per year. In more than one half of cases, the death of a postinfarct patient is sudden, with the major cause being ventricular fibrillation. These patients are also threatened by another risk: recurrent infarction. For Kannel, its incidence is 13% in men and 40% in women within 5 years of the first infarct. Its mortality is higher than that of the first infarct. Beta-blockers and calcium blockers reduce the myocardial oxygen consumption by a variety of mechanisms: beta-blockers block the beta-adrenergic receptors and calcium blockers inhibit the entry of calcium into the myocardial cells. Apart from their action on the process of excitation-contraction of myocardial fibres, the calcium blockers have also an action on the coronary vessels where they suppress or prevent spasm, and on peripheral arteries, where they cause vasodilatation thereby reducing the left ventricular afterload. The anti-ischaemic activity of these molecules is demonstrated by the reduction or elimination of angina, by the improved cardiac performance during stress test and by myocardial isotopic scans. The beta-blockers have other beneficial effects, in particular, antiarrhythmic and antiplatelet aggregation related to the neutralisation of catecholamines. Their antihypertensive action is also useful in coronary patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "Intravenous beta-blocking drugs are being increasingly used in early myocardial infarction but little is known of the comparative haemodynamic effects of drugs with different ancillary pharmacological properties. In patients with stable coronary heart disease all intravenous beta-blocking drugs reduce left ventricular pumping function in a dose-response fashion. The reduction in cardiac mechanical activity is directly related to the dose and inversely related to the degree of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity possessed by each drug; it is independent of the property of 'cardioselectivity'. The lesser depression of left ventricular pumping performance after beta-blocking drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity is probably due to two primary pharmacodynamic effects: a) increased myocardial contractile activity due to stimulation of post-synaptic beta 1- and presynaptic beta 2-adrenoceptors in the sinus node and ventricular myocardium; b) reduction in left ventricular afterload consequent upon the fall in systemic vascular resistance resulting from stimulation of vasodilator beta 2-adrenoceptors in peripheral resistance vessels. A similar but less marked haemodynamic separation of beta-blocking drugs with and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity is observed in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The quantitative difference in the haemodynamic effects of intravenous beta-blocking drugs in angina pectoris compared to their effects in acute myocardial infarction is probably due to the higher level of sympathetic stimulation and sensitivity to beta-blockade in the latter. It has yet to be shown by formal clinical trial that the haemodynamic advantages attributable to the possession of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity by a beta-blocking drug are translated into clinical benefit.", 
    "45": "The use of beta-blocking drugs in the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy has been the subject of controversies on the basis of theoretical hazards due to the pharmacology and pharmacokinetic characteristics of these drugs. A review of the literature on the subject shows that: The danger of premature contractions, abortion or premature delivery does not seem to increase with the use of beta-blockers. The blood supply is not more impaired with beta-blockers than with other antihypertensive drugs according to fetal growth, birth-weight, frequency of perinatal deaths or APGAR score. Although beta-blocking drugs pass into fetal circulation, neonatal bradycardia, respiratory distress or hypoglycemia do not seem more frequent with beta-blockers. Beta-blockers pass from maternal plasma into milk but the 24 hour dose brought to the newborn by maternal feeding is so slight as to be negligible. Thus, the cumulative data and the favorable opinions of many authors, the greater efficiency of beta-blockers authorizes the use of these drugs in the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy, where it seems to improve the outcome of the pregnancy and the state of the fetus at birth.", 
    "46": "Four beta-blockers: atenolol 15 mg i.v., metoprolol 25 mg i.v., acebutolol 45 mg i.v. and labetalol 50 mg i.v. were administered to 106 patients suffering from hypertension and with normal or disturbed renal function. During an identical test protocol, measurements of clearance of inulin, of PAH, urine sodium and the fraction of sodium excreted were recorded one hour before and four or five hours after administration of the antihypertensive. Mean blood pressure and heart rate were also recorded. The three pure beta-blockers reduced inulin and PAH clearance and lowered urine sodium. These modifications were the same for all three drugs. Labetalol, which also possesses alpha-blocking properties, did not reduce renal function values or urine sodium. While a slight fall in blood pressure occurred with all the antihypertensives, heart rate was reduced only by the three pure beta-blockers. The action of the four drugs was very similar whatever the state of the subject's renal function. The study of the renal effects of the beta 1-selective atenolol and metoprolol, and acebutolol which has a higher intrinsic sympathomimetic activity does not demonstrate any significantly different renal action among these three drugs, but the effects of labetalol on renal function values and urine sodium are slighter. The renal action of the beta-blockers cannot be fully explained. Though the fall in the renal plasma flow and in the glomerular filtration rate can be related partly to the decrease in the cardiac output consequent to induced bradycardia, stimulation of renal alpha-receptors must be considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "Hemodynamic parameters, after administration of three different beta-blockers, were measured in fifteen hypertensive, and five normotensive, subjects. The non-invasive hemodynamic measurements were made prior to drug administration, after the first dose, and after prolonged treatment with either: metoprolol (M) 100 mg b.i.d., propranolol (Pr) 80 mg b.i.d., or pindolol (P) 10 mg b.i.d. With the parameters of blood pressure (B.P.), pulse rate (H.R.), blood flow in the leg at rest were determined with the plethysmographic impedance technique; venous compliance (V.C.), and flow in the leg after reactional hyperemia (F.R.H.) were evaluated by the mercury gauge technique. The pneumoplethysmographic technique was used to measure digital flow (D.F.). During administration of metoprolol, the B.P. and H.R. decreased significantly in the first few hours, and remained so during the prolonged treatment period of 4 weeks; the other parameters did not change significantly. Propranolol, after short-term treatment, decreased H.R. and blood flow in the leg at rest. Also, modifications in the venous compliance occurred but are difficult to interpret. After administration of pindolol, except for a decrease in H.R. and reactional hyperemia that occurred during the 2nd hour, no significant changes occurred in the other parameters. The digital flow showed non-significant variations. These preliminary results demonstrate that the changes registered through non-invasive techniques, although very small, affect pindolol less than metoprolol or propranolol.", 
    "48": "A new method of evaluating quantitative cytotoxicity in cell culture was demonstrated using Chang's cultured human conjunctival cells. Time-dependent cytotoxicity of some beta-adrenergic blocking agents was shown and expressed by exposure time, causing 50% cell damage (50% cell damage time CDT50). Pure timolol maleate maleate of 0.25% and 0.5% concentration caused no cytotoxicity within a 64-min exposure. Pure befunolol hydrochloride of 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% inhibited 10%-30% of cell growth at 64-min exposure. Pure bupranolol of 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% showed evident cytotoxicity and CDT50 at 66 min 48 s, 38 min 54 s, 3 min 46 s and 1 min 18 s, respectively. Commercial preparations, which contained benzalkonium chloride as a preservative, indicated more rapid cytotoxicity. Timolol preparations of 0.25% and 0.5% showed CDT50 at 48.1 s and 2 min 4 s, respectively. Befunolol preparations of 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% showed CTD50 at 43.4% s, 4 min 38 s and 58 s, respectively, Bupranolol preparations of 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% demonstrated CDT50 at 1 min 11 s, 3 min 24 s, 22.3 s and 13.7 s, respectively.", 
    "49": "Isolated corneas were mounted in Ussing-Zerahn-type chambers and short circuit current (SCC) was measured before and after application of drugs (5 X 10(-5) mol X 1(-1)) interfering with adrenergic receptors. Epinephrine increased SCC in the rabbit cornea and decreased SCC in the human cornea. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation or inhibition did not affect SCC. The increase in SCC observed after terbutaline (beta 2-agonist) was similar to the increase after isoproterenol (beta 1- and beta 2-agonist). SCC was not influenced by the beta 1-antagonist atenolol but was modified, although differently in rabbit and man, by the beta 1- and beta 2-antagonist propranolol. Thus, the catecholamine response of the rabbit and human cornea is mainly mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors. However, species differences were observed when testing the effect of propranolol on the transcorneal flux of 22Na and 36Cl. In the rabbit cornea the net Cl flux (directed from the aqueous to the tear side) was inhibited by propranolol, whereas net Na flux (from the tear to the aqueous side) was not influenced by the drug. In the human cornea propranolol reduced unidirectional Na flux from the aqueous to the tear side. Thus, the regulatory effect of propranolol on corneal transparency is different in man and the rabbit.", 
    "50": "After an initial placebo period of four weeks 24 patients with primary hypertension were treated with prizidilol, a hydrazinopyridazine derivative with combined vasodilator and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking actions, for a dose titration period of 14 weeks. Prizidilol 200 to 800 mg was given once daily to achieve a target supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) less than 90 mmHg. Supine and standing BP recorded 24-27 h after drug intake decreased from 172 +/- 17/106 +/- 6 mmHg (mean +/- SD) and 167 +/- 18/111 +/- 8 mmHg, respectively, after placebo to 159 +/- 16/99 +/- 8 and 154 +/- 18/101 +/- 9 mmHg after active treatment for six weeks (mean dose 447 mg), and to 154 +/- 16/97 +/- 7 and 148 +/- 14/97 +/- 7 mmHg after treatment for 14 weeks (mean dose 687 mg/day). A slight reduction in HR was seen after treatment for six weeks and in plasma renin activity and urinary methoxycatecholamine excretion after treatment for 14 weeks. A sustained decrease in BP was observed for 10 h after prizidilol 800 mg (n = 9), with a maximum antihypertensive effect (mean reduction in supine BP 33/18 mmHg) 2.5 h after dosing, which coincided with the mean peak plasma concentration. The plasma elimination half-life of the drug was 3.9 h (range 2.0-8.9 h). Changing to a twice daily regimen in 17 patients (mean daily dose 748 mg at six months) did not produce any further reduction in the BP (recorded 12-15 h after dosing) as compared to the once daily regimen at 14 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "The structure of the wall of the lung from the toad (Bufo marinus) has been examined using scanning and transmission electron microscopy and the presence of smooth muscle cells in the septal-alveolar walls detected. Responses of toad isolated lung parenchyma strip to agonists causing relaxation and contraction were measured and the potencies of adrenoceptor and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonists were determined. Results indicated the presence of populations of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in toad lung alveoli, both of which mediate relaxation responses. Stimulation of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors was required to cause complete relaxation. 5-Hydroxytryptamine also caused complete relaxation. A population of alpha-adrenoceptors mediating contraction may also exist in pulmonary vascular and or septal edge smooth muscle.", 
    "52": "The catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, when placed on the toad urinary bladder in vitro, at a final concentration of 50 microM, caused a significant increase in H+ and NH+4 excretion by the bladder. Isoprenaline in a final concentration of 50 microM also increased H+ and NH+4 excretion in the bladder. Propranolol at a concentration of 50 microM blocked the stimulation of H+ excretion by isoprenaline but propranolol at 100 microM was required to block the stimulation of NH+4 by isoprenaline. The dose-response analysis indicates that the concentration of epinephrine used (50 microM) is at or near the maximal effective dose. These findings indicate that catecholamines stimulate H+ and NH+4 excretion in the toad urinary bladder and evidence suggests this may be mediated via the beta receptor mechanism.", 
    "53": "Once the diagnosis of chronic hypertension in pregnancy has been made, many centers in the United States treat moderate to severe cases of chronic hypertension pharmacologically, hoping to delay or obviate the onset of superimposed preeclampsia and to improve perinatal outcome. Methyldopa, which is most often used, is the only antihypertensive drug for which there is no evidence of adverse effects in long-term follow-up studies of fetuses exposed to it. Newer beta-blocker drugs such as atenolol and labetalol are receiving much attention abroad. These newer drugs have fewer maternal side effects and, as yet, no adverse effects on fetuses have been seen. Clinical trials of labetalol will soon start in the United States.", 
    "54": "4-(2-Hydroxy-3-[(1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl)amino] propoxy)benzeneacetamide (KF-4317) differs from conventional adrenoceptor antagonists in producing a competitive blockade at both alpha- and beta 1-adrenoceptors. In blocking beta 1-adrenoceptors, KF-4317 is as active as labetalol in both in vitro and in vivo experiments, and 22 times less potent (in vitro) and 2 times less potent (in vivo) than propranolol. In blocking beta 2-adrenoceptors, KF-4317 is 776 times less potent (in vitro) and 83 times less potent (in vivo) than propranolol. The ratio of beta 1-blocking activity to beta 2-blocking activity is 33 to 145 for practolol, 37 for KF-4317, 1 for propranolol and 0.16 to 1 for labetalol, respectively. In blocking alpha-adrenoceptors, KF-4317 is 55 times less potent than phentolamine and 6 times less potent than labetalol in in vitro experiments, but as active as labetalol in in vivo experiments. These results show that KF-4317 possesses a novel type of adrenoceptor antagonistic property.", 
    "55": "The alcohol preference has been used as a model of drug habituation in animal experiments in order to examine the influence of altered synaptic efficiency of central transmission systems following acute receptor reactions with agonists or antagonists as well as by alterations of receptor sensitivity in mice. Ethanol in 10 per cent solution as the only beverage over 4 weeks produces an ethanol preference quotient 1 in the free choice of ethanol solution and water. Control animals without ethanol exposure before the preference test are only drinking water and refuse ethanol. A single injection of haloperidol increases the preference, apomorphine as well as a long term haloperidol administration producing a dopaminergic supersensitivity diminishes the preference. Moreover the preference is enhanced by atropine, isoprenaline and pholedrine and is decreased by arecoline, propranolol and phenoxybenzamine. Cyproheptadine and picrotoxine do not influence the preference. The results point to a preference promoting influence of the alpha- and beta-adrenergic transmission and to an inhibition by dopaminergic and cholinergic activity. An influence by the 5-HT and GABA system could not be observed. Additionally the paper describes the decrease of the ethanol preference by the nootropics piracetam, meclofenoxane, methylglucamine orotate and nicergoline.", 
    "56": "We summarize the findings of 18 clinical studies carried out over a decade to ascertain the effect of 14 pharmacological agents on lung mucociliary clearance. These studies were carried out on a total of 172 subjects/patients and amounted to 443 individual assessments. The objective, in vivo radioaerosol technique was used to measure clearance. Bromhexine, aerosolized hypertonic saline and aminophylline enhanced the clearance of lung secretions. There was some indirect evidence of a speeding up of mucociliary clearance following the administration of prednisolone and the synthetic anticholinergic bronchodilator ipratropium, while hyoscine was found to reduce clearance. There was no effect on clearance of single doses of the beta blockers propranolol and atenolol, the beta 2 adrenergic drug terbutaline, the cholonergic drug bethanecol and the expectorants 2-mercapto-ethane-sulphonate (aerosol) and glycerol guaiacolate. Long term administration (4 - 7 days) of the beta 2 adrenergic drugs terbutaline and clenbuterol also failed to show any effect on lung mucociliary function.",

Plasma and urine drug concentrations were measured by an HPLC method. The pharmacokinetic parameters after intravenous dosing were obtained by a two-compartment analysis: elimination or beta-phase t1/2 4.7 +/- 0.3 h; Vc, 0.74 +/- 0.101/kg; Vd, 4.05 +/- 0.48 l/kg; Cl, 10.13 +/- 0.94 ml/min/kg; ClR, 6.56 +/- 0.58 ml/min/kg; and ClNR, 3.57 +/- 0.40 ml/min/kg. The absolute bioavailability obtained from plasma data was 83.7 +/- 8.0%, which was consistent with that derived from analysis of urine of 82.7 +/- 4.2%. The amounts excreted unchanged in urine up to 48 h after the intravenous and oral doses were 65.0 +/- 1.5% and 53.8 +/- 3.2% of the administered doses, respectively. The t1/2 for removal of the drug derived from plasma and urine findings after intravenous and oral dosing were similar, which indicates that the main route of elimination of carteolol is via the kidneys. As the ClR of carteolol exceeded the Cl of creatinine there may be renal tubular secretion of the drug.", 
    "58": "14 patients with refractory hypertension did not respond either to captopril, an angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor, combined with a diuretic, a beta-blocker and hydralazine or minoxidil, a potent vasodilator, but they did respond to the combination of captopril, minoxidil, furosemide and a beta-blocker. There were no disturbing side effects from this combination. There may be a synergistic effect between captopril and minoxidil in the treatment of refractory hypertension. The combination is an interesting and novel method of treating patients with refractory hypertension.", 
    "59": "Subcutaneous and skeletal muscle blood flow in the forearm during 30 degrees head-up tilt was studied in 15 healthy subjects before and during treatment with propranolol. Relative blood flow was estimated by the local 133Xe washout technique. Head-up tilt elicited greater vasoconstriction in both tissues during beta-receptor blockade as compared to the pretreatment period. Proximal nerve blockade with lidocaine prevented the vasoconstrictor response in subcutaneous tissue to the tilt. In skeletal muscle injection of a low dose of propranolol had no effect on the vasoconstrictor response to tilt. Therefore, the augmented vasoconstrictor response to head-up tilt during beta-receptor blockade is most probably due to centrally elicited (baroreceptor) and neurogenically mediated impulses to resistance vessels in peripheral tissues and not to \"unmasking\" of peripheral alpha-receptors.", 
    "60": "Twenty-six patients (average age 50 years) with essential hypertension were treated for 4 months with 2.5 mg indapamide per day, alone or in combination with other drugs. Before treatment, the average blood pressure was 208/128 mmHg, and each patient had undergone at least 6-months' therapy with hydrochlorothiazide alone (6 patients), in combination with reserpine (11 patients), or with methyldopa, hydralazine, propranolol, metoprolol or guanethidine (9 patients). Indapamide was prescribed to replace hydrochlorothiazide, the other antihypertensive drugs being continued in those patients receiving combination therapy. The average supine blood pressure decreased from 148/93 mmHg with hydrochlorothiazide to 143/92 mmHg during an intermediate 4-week placebo period, and to 135/86 mmHg with indapamide. Effects on blood pressure and all other parameters were the same, whether indapamide was used alone or in combination with other drugs. Serum potassium levels at the end of treatment averaged 3.6 mmol/l, a value similar to that obtained with hydrochlorothiazide. Plasma bicarbonate was unchanged (27.5 mmol/l), serum uric acid averaged 7.4 mg/dl, and renal function remained normal. Other parameters showing no change included blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, total bilirubin, transaminases, platelets, etc. All the patients reported a sensation of well-being during treatment with indapamide; this drug shows clinical and biochemical effects similar to those of the thiazide-type diuretics.", 
    "61": "The results of the majority of the on-going large-scale studies in patients with hypertension underline the importance of lowering diastolic blood pressure to levels below 90 mmHg and the benefits, in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality, of the treatment even of those with mild hypertension. Because the patient with mild hypertension is generally asymptomatic, treatment must not only be effective but also have minimal side-effects and a simple regimen to ensure patient compliance. The step-care approach to the treatment of such patients and the drugs of choice are reviewed briefly.", 
    "62": "A prospective evaluation was started in 1976 to study the influence of diuretics alone or combined with beta-blockers on serum lipoproteins in normal or hypertensive subjects. Compared to placebo conditions, 4 or 6-weeks' monotherapy with various diuretics significantly (p less than 0.05) increased the beta-lipoprotein fraction (furosemide, 80 mg/day or chlorthalidone, 100 mg/day; n = 16) or low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (chlorthalidone, 100 mg/day, n = 27 men; tienilic acid, 250 mg/day, n = 16 men, clopamide, 5 mg/day, n = 17 men; or muzolimine, 20 to 40 mg/day, n = 13 men or post-menopausal women). No increase in LDL-C was noted in 43 men (32 normal, 11 with mild hypertension) treated with indapamide, 2.5 mg/day. Serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and apoproteins A1, A2 and B were not consistently changed by any of these agents. In women, chlorthalidone (100 mg/day) significantly increased LDL-C in the (100 mg/day) significantly increased LDL-C in the post-menopausal (n = 18) but not in the pre-menopausal (n = 22) state. Increases in LDL-C caused by chlorthalidone monotherapy were prevented or reversed by the addition of a beta-blocker, usually propranolol or atenolol (n = 18); increases in LDL-C during clopamide monotherapy were reversed after the addition of the beta-blocker pindolol (10 mg/day, n = 17). In all studies, variations in beta-lipoprotein or LDL-C levels could not be explained by changes in blood volume, serum glucose or insulin and did not correlate with alterations in blood pressure, plasma potassium, renin, aldosterone, adrenaline or noradrenaline. These observations indicate that various diuretics may increase serum LDL-C in men or post-menopausal women. Pre-menopausal women may often be protected from this side-effect. Long-term studies are now needed to clarify the pathogenic and prognostic relevance of lipoprotein changes induced by diuretics. In the meantime, it is of clinical interest that indapamide had no significant effect on serum lipoproteins and that certain beta-blockers appear to prevent or reverse increases in LDL-C during diuretic treatment in men and post-menopausal women.", 
    "63": "Ten patients with severe hypertension and unsatisfactory blood pressure control during combined therapy with beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, diuretics, and vasodilators were treated with gradually increasing doses of captopril. Vasodilators were discontinued 24 hours prior to captopril administration. Six patients had essential, two renal, and two renovascular hypertension. Mild renal impairment was observed in four patients. Captopril effectively decreased blood pressure for 3 hours in all patients after the first dose. The antihypertensive effect appeared to be triphasic and was sustained in all but one patient during 12 months of observation. Captopril doses of 25-75 mg t.i.d. were sufficient to achieve acceptable blood pressure control (RR less than or equal to 160/100 mmHg) when given in the above mentioned combination. Side-effects were few and tolerable and discontinuation of captopril was not required.", 
    "64": "This case report describes a schizophrenic patient who developed akathisia and tremor following neuroleptic pharmacotherapy with fluphenazine decanoate. The patient also suffered from familial (benign essential) tremor. The patient's neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects were not relieved by anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs or by phenobarbital. The patient was started on propranolol 10 mg b.i.d. She was also started on diazepam 5 mg t.i.d. for anxiety. The diazepam dose was held constant and propranolol was gradually increased to 40 mg q.i.d. The patient's extrapyramidal symptomatology gradually resolved over the course of one month, during which time the propranolol dose was being steadily increased. Propranolol also effectively controlled her familial tremor. After nine months as an outpatient, during which time the patient was neuroleptic-free, she developed psychotic decompensation for which she was treated with thiothixene. Akathisia or tremor did not develop, possibly because the patient was taking propranolol simultaneously. Propranolol may be useful for treating neuroleptic-induced akathisia. This requires systematic investigation with open and controlled trials.", 
    "65": "Although propranolol antagonized CaCl2-induced arrhythmias in the rat due to its local anaesthetic properties, arrhythmias-protected animals died because of respiratory failure. To assess the relative role played by beta 2-adrenoreceptor blocking and local anaesthetic properties in the genesis of this phenomenon, five beta-blockers with different degrees of local anaesthetic properties have been tested at their respective ED50 against CaCl2-induced arrhythmias in the rat and their respective surviving/arrhythmias-protected animals ratio (SAPAR) calculated. A highly significant correlation exists between local anaesthetic properties and SAPAR but not between SAPAR and beta 2-adrenoreceptor blocking properties. Further studies showed that (a) assisted ventilation but not picrotoxin or terbutaline pretreatment protected rats against propranolol-CaCl2-induced respiratory failure, and (b) intracerebroventricular propranolol failed to antagonize CaCl2-induced arrhythmias while producing a dose-dependent inhibition of breathing rate. These results suggest that, in this test model, local anaesthetic properties of beta-blockers are responsible for their antiarrhythmic effect at peripheral level, and superimpose to the effects of CaCl2 in inducing respiratory failure at central level.", 
    "66": "The role of calcium for the function of vascular smooth muscle in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) was investigated, employing calcium blockers as a pharmacological tool. In the aorta of the SHR there was evidence for an increased dependency on extracellular calcium as the diseased vessels exhibited a faster membranal turn-over of calcium than vessels from normotensive control rats. In accordance with that, the effect of nifedipine appeared to be stronger in SHR vessels than in the normotensive one. Long-term treatment of SHRs with verapamil caused significant blood pressure reductions and regression of cardiac hypertrophy. In pilot studies in man both verapamil and nifedipine proved effective in lowering blood pressure. Nifedipine appeared the better suited. Hypertensive patients responded with a dose-related drop in blood pressure 10-30 min after the sublingual administration of nifedipine whereas normotensive subjects hardly showed any change of blood pressure. Following the acute administration of nifedipine a reflex increment of sympathetic tone was seen as reflected by increase in heart rate, circulating noradrenaline and plasma renin activity. An acute diuretic and natriuretic effect was seen together with a rise in urinary uric acid excretion. During long-term therapy nifedipine was effective in lowering blood pressure but side effects were common during monotherapy. When combined with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent side effects were few but concomitant diuretic therapy was often necessary.", 
    "67": "Treatment of angina with a single drug often proves unsatisfactory because of dose-related unwanted effects or occasionally an adverse effect on the angina. A combination of a beta-blocking agent and a calcium antagonist drug might achieve satisfactory control of angina at acceptable doses of each drug. Widespread application of combination therapy would, however, be inappropriate if the beta-blocker component were to have adverse effects among patients with rest pain as a prominent symptom, suggestive of coronary 'spasm'. The reported adverse effects of beta-blocking agents are likely to be related to bradycardia and are not apparent if excessive slowing is avoided by individual dose adjustment or if bradycardia is corrected by pacing. Supposed failure of these agents to control cardiac pain not infrequently results from inadequate dosage. Combination therapy will attenuate the increases in heart rate and contractility resulting from stress while coronary perfusion will be maintained and the associated level of arterial blood pressure reduced. The theoretical benefits have been confirmed in clinical investigations in which the effect of combination therapy has been compared with that of one or both of the constituent drugs given alone. Reports of bradycardia (specific to inclusion of verapamil in the combination), hypotension or cardiac failure developing during combination therapy emphasize the need for careful dose titration of both beta-blocker and calcium antagonist in each patient. The possible additional role of nitrates is undefined, but inclusion of these agents is likely to prove especially valuable where left ventricular function is grossly impaired and in the management of unstable angina.", 
    "68": "To explore beneficial and harmful effects of various combinations of antianginal drugs, we compared antianginal and cardiorespiratory effects of nifedipine and isosorbide dinitrate in low and high doses in combination with nadolol, a long acting beta-adrenoceptor blocker in a double-blind study in 19 patients with stable angina pectoris. Nadolol alone and in combination with the other two drugs reduced anginal attack rate and glyceryl trinitrate consumption; the high dose isosorbide dinitrate showed a further significant (P less than 0.05) reduction in both but the high dose nifedipine did not show such a trend. sigma ST depression (all leads) was significantly (P less than 0.05) more reduced by the high dose nifedipine than by the same dose of isosorbide dinitrate in combination with nadolol. Nadolol reduced forced expiratory volume in one sec (FEV1) slightly and this effect was reversed both by isosorbide and nifedipine. Isosorbide dinitrate in combination with nadolol reduced the basal and post-exercise arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) whereas nifedipine did not reduce the mean SaO2 below the pre-trial level. A significantly greater sigma ST depression was associated with a lower post-exercise SaO2 (less than or equal to 92%) during all treatment periods but the fall of SaO2 occurred more often during isosorbide than during nifedipine treatment periods. These studies show that both isosorbide dinitrate and nifedipine enhance antianginal efficacy of nadolol. Isosorbide dinitrate, unlike nifedipine, reduces SaO2 which is associated with a greater sigma ST depression.", 
    "69": "Twenty patients with essential hypertension difficult to control on a combination of beta blocker, diuretic and vasodilator (mainly hydralazine) drugs were subject to an open study. Replacement of the vasodilator by nifedipine appeared to produce a satisfactory antihypertensive response and a reduction in side effects.", 
    "70": "The oxidative metabolism of bufuralol is under the same genetic control as that of debrisoquine and sparteine. 154 fasting volunteers received a 30 mg tablet of bufuralol and a blood sample was taken 3 h later. In poor metabolizers (8% of the sample) the plasma bufuralol concentrations were very high and the metabolite concentrations were low. The genetic oxidative status is a major source of interindividual variation in the plasma concentration of drugs that undergo oxidative metabolism.", 
    "71": "The effects on specific airway conductance (sGaw) of placebo, betaxolol and propranolol following the inhalation of salbutamol were studied in 8 healthy volunteers by whole body plethysmography. Each subject received placebo and single oral doses of betaxolol 40 mg and 80 mg, and propranolol 160 mg, and 320 mg. sGaw was measured before dosing and after 2 h, just before salbutamol was inhaled. It was then measured again after 15 min and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 h. sGaw 2 h after the beta-blockers did not differ from the value whilst on placebo. The peak response to salbutamol after placebo and both doses of betaxolol was almost identical, whereas it was significantly reduced after propranolol. The AUC of the response to salbutamol over 6 h showed a reduction of 11% after betaxolol and of 19% after propranolol (p less than 0.01 between beta-blockers). The results indicate that, after betaxolol and in contrast to propranolol, a proportion of the bronchial beta 2-receptor population remains available to a beta 2-agonist.", 
    "72": "Beta adrenergic antagonists are a complex group of agents. The profusion of newer agents will allow us to discover nuances of difference between them, but that will be a future development. Currently, our concerns should be obtaining extensive experience with propranolol, controlling intraoperative and postoperative tachycardia; using beta blockade as adjunctive therapy during vasodilator administration; using beta blockade as part of \"balanced\" anesthesia, especially in patients with coronary artery disease; and learning sophisticated ways of preoperatively and intraoperatively evaluating hemodynamics so as to be able to decide when and how to best utilize the drugs. Beta agonists recently introduced include dopamine and dobutamine. Differences and similarities are numerous. Overriding in adults, at least, may be the ability of dopamine to stimulate renal dopaminergic receptors to increase renal blood flow.", 
    "73": "A total of 758 consecutive patients attending three hypertension clinics answered a questionnaire designed to assess the prevalence and severity of complaints of cold extremities among patients on various antihypertensive drugs. Forty-four per cent claimed to have had complaints of cold extremities and about 50% of these had had symptoms already prior to antihypertensive treatment. Among the newly symptomatic patients the prevalence of symptoms was 18% of those on diuretics and 40% of those on beta-blockers (p less than 0.01). No significant association was found between the prevalence of symptoms and age, sex, use of vibrating tools, smoking or history of various conditions associated with atherosclerosis. No significant difference was found in the prevalence of symptoms among patients on propranolol, alprenolol, pindolol, atenolol and metoprolol. It is concluded that cold hands and feet are common among hypertensive patients and may be aggravated by treatment with not only beta-blockers but also diuretics.", 
    "74": "Does the pharmaceutical industry perform LD50-determinations in animals just because it is required by the authorities or are there any scientific benefits from counting dead animals and calculating and index of lethal toxicity? This is an important question when discussing LD50 and possible alternatives. We will try to answer this question by presenting data and some views collected during almost ten years at a Swedish pharmaceutical company. We will describe how we have made use of the LD50-values in the safety evaluation process. We will compare LD50-values with the dose levels used in longterm toxicity both after single or repeated administration and with therapeutical dose levels in man for different classes of drugs. These data will enable us to demonstrate the value of the LD50-determinations. As we are of the opinion that the LD50-value itself has a limited value for the total safety evaluation of drugs we will look into the possibility of replacing the LD50-determination with something else as an indication of lethal toxicity. In order to minimize the number of animals used and the number of animals dying because of dosing in studies on lethal toxicity we will try to support a proposal to use the maximal nonlethal dose (MNLD) as an indication of lethal toxicity in small animals.", 
    "75": "The posttraining IP administration of adrenaline (epinephrine) HCl (5.0 micrograms/kg) or tyramine HCl (1.0 mg/kg) causes retrograde amnesia for a one-way step-down inhibitory avoidance task in rats. The effect is cancelled by the simultaneous injection of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine HCl (2.0 mg/kg) or of the beta 1 - beta 2 blocker propranolol HCl (2.0 mg/kg). The amnestic effect of posttraining adrenaline or tyramine is counteracted by the administration of adrenaline or tyramine prior to testing: each drug has a greater antiamnestic effect against itself than against the other drug. The antiamnestic effect of tyramine and adrenaline is antagonized by the simultaneous administration of prazosin or yohimbine, but not by that of propranolol. We conclude that the posttraining amnestic effect of adrenaline and tyramine is mediated by alpha 2 receptors (probably postsynaptic) and that it does not reflect a storage deficit, since memory can be restored by an appropriate treatment given before the test session. The antiamnestic effect of adrenaline and tyramine is mediated both by alpha 1 and by alpha 2 receptors, and probably reflects the dependency of mechanisms that make stored information available for retrieval on circulating catecholamines. The present findings provide no clue as to the anatomical distribution of the adrenergic receptors involved in the amnestic or antiamnestic actions of adrenaline and tyramine.", 
    "76": "In order to study the effect of epinephrine on potassium (K) metabolism, an epinephrine infusion (0.1 micrograms/kg/min for 30 min) was carried out in 12 essentially anuric and usually hyperkalaemic haemodialysis patients, 72 hr post-dialysis. Two groups emerged, group I (five patients) serum K decreased at least 0.75 mEq/L (from 6.6 +/- 0.2 to 5.4 +/- 0.1 mEq/L) and there were increases in heart rate, serum glucose and insulin values, group II (seven patients), serum K did not decrease and heart rate remained unchanged, but serum glucose and insulin increased slightly. Plasma renin, aldosterone and arterial pH did not change in either group. Propranolol blocked the epinephrine induced decrease in serum K in group I patients. Patients from group II had higher pre-infusion endogenous epinephrine concentrations than patients from group I. In haemodialysis patients beta adrenergic stimulation enhances extrarenal K disposal but about 50 per cent of patients fail to respond, perhaps because of receptor occupancy due to higher endogenous epinephrine concentrations."
