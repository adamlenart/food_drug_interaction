    "0": "1. Two unstable high molecular weight toxins have been isolated from tentacles of Chironex fleckeri by exclusion chromatography. Both are cardiotoxic; the lower molecular weight fraction is also a potent haemolysin.2. Both toxins reduce the rate, amplitude of contraction and coronary flow in the isolated, perfused guinea-pig heart. Relative to the mouse lethal dose the haemolytic fraction is less potent in this preparation than the purely cardiotoxic fraction.3. Both toxins cause a rise in arterial pressure in anaesthetized rats and rabbits by a direct action on the vascular musculature. This is followed by hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac irregularity. An increase in respiratory rate is followed by apnoea of variable duration, which is associated with a rise in arterial pressure. Animals frequently show arterial pressure oscillations with periods of apnoea interspersed with hyperpnoea.4. The carotid occlusion reflex is depressed during hypotensive periods after both toxins, although (-)-noradrenaline can still elicit a marked pressor response. Bilateral cervical vagotomy has but little effect on the response to either toxin, save to prevent hyperpnoea, but radical denervation of sinoaortic afferents reduces the arterial pressure fall after the initial hypertensive response, suggesting that this fall is due to a combination of baroreceptor stimulation and a fall in cardiac output. Blood pressure oscillations are still seen, possibly due to central stimulation by hypercapnia.5. Interference with the efferent arm of the vasomotor reflex arc with hexamethonium, bretylium or phenoxybenzamine either abolishes or markedly reduces the blood pressure oscillations without affecting the initial hypertensive response.6. The cardiovascular effects of the two toxins are thought to be due to direct vasoconstriction, cardiotoxicity, baroreceptor stimulation and possibly depression of the vasomotor centre. The resultant disordering of the feed-back system regulating vasomotor tone leads to the characteristic arterial pressure oscillations.", 
    "1": "1. Propranolol augmented the bronchoconstrictor response to methacholine or histamine, recorded by air overflow in the anaesthetized, vagotomized guinea-pig.2. After adrenalectomy, propranolol was still active, though less so than before.3. In the pithed guinea-pig, there was no augmentation of the effect of bronchoconstrictors on air overflow. The action of propranolol could thus be due to the beta-adrenoceptor blockade of compensatory sympathetic bronchodilator activity, as concluded by McCulloch, Proctor & Rand (1967).4. Electrical stimulation of the thoracic region of the spinal cord of the pithed guinea-pig reduced the effect of bronchoconstrictors on air overflow. This reduction could be blocked by propranolol; practolol was much less effective.", 
    "2": "1. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity of 3-methoxyisoprenaline, the O-methylated metabolite of isoprenaline, was studied on isolated driven atrial strip and tracheal chain preparations of the guinea-pig and on the hind limb blood flow of the dog.2. On both the atrial strip and tracheal chain preparations the blockade of responses to isoprenaline fulfilled the criteria for simple competitive inhibition.3. 3-Methoxyisoprenaline decreased the vasodilator response to isoprenaline in the dog hind limb, but did not affect the response to noradrenaline.4. 3-Methoxyisoprenaline had about 1/3,700 of the potency of propranolol as a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist on the tracheal chain preparation, 1/1,000 on the atrial strip preparation and less than 1/400 on the hind limb blood flow.5. The antagonist activity of 3-methoxyisoprenaline showed a slight specificity for cardiac beta-adrenoceptors, being 4.3 times more active on guinea-pig atria than on trachea.6. Although 3-methoxyisoprenaline antagonized the actions of isoprenaline in the three preparations, its activity was extremely weak. It is unlikely that the formation of 3-methoxyisoprenaline from isoprenaline, administered therapeutically, could lead to beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "3": "The hemodynamic effects of tachycardia induced by atrial pacing were investigated in left ventricular failure of acute and healing experimental myocardial infarction in 20 intact, conscious dogs. Myocardial infarction was produced by gradual inflation of a balloon cuff device implanted around the left anterior descending coronary artery 10-15 days prior to the study. 1 hr after acute myocardial infarction, atrial pacing at a rate of 180 beats/min decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 19 to 8 mm Hg and left atrial pressure from 17 to 12 mm Hg, without change in cardiac output. In the healing phase of myocardial infarction 1 wk later, atrial pacing decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 17 to 9 mm Hg and increased the cardiac output by 37%. This was accompanied by evidence of peripheral vasodilation. In two dogs with healing anterior wall myocardial infarction, left ventricular failure was enhanced by partial occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery. Both the dogs developed pulmonary edema. Pacing improved left ventricular performance and relieved pulmonary edema in both animals. In six animals propranolol was given after acute infarction, and left ventricular function deteriorated further. However the pacing-induced augmentation of cardiac function was unaltered and, hence, is not mediated by sympathetics.The results show that the spontaneous heart rate in left ventricular failure of experimental canine myocardial infarction may be less than optimal and that maximal cardiac function may be achieved at higher heart rates."
