    "0": "In 21 of 23 patients with hypertension unresponsive to other treatment minoxidil, a new antihypertensive drug acting via peripheral vasodilatation, lowered their blood pressure from 191 +/- 19/117 +/- 12 MM Hg to 147 +/- 13/117 +/- 12 mm Hg. The drug causes a reflex tachycardia and must therefore be combined with beta-blockers. Furthermore, an effective diuretic must also be used because minoxidil causes sodium retention. Hypertrichosis is an important side-effect for which the drug may have to be discontinued, especially in young women. Orthostasis did not occur in the reported series. The authors recommend that the drug be made available for the treatment of malignant hypertension.", 
    "1": "To determine whether halothane and morphine, commonly used during anesthesia for cardiac operations, potentiate the beta blocking activity of propanolol, hemodynamic changes induced by five incremental doses of propranolol (10, 20, 50, 120, 200 microgram/kg) were measured during halothane, 1 per cent, in oxygen, and morphine, 4 mg/kg. Against a background of contant beta stimulation by infusion of isoproterenol, 0.1 microgram/kg/min, and vagal blockade by atropine, 3 mg, propranolol produced significant dose-related decreases in heart rate, cardiac index, stroke volume index, and left ventricular dp/dtmax and significant increases in mean aortic pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Compared with basal anesthesia with pentobarbital, 15 mg/kg, neither morphine nor halothane increased sensitivity to any measured effect of propranolol expressed as the slope of the log dose-response relationship. It is concluded that the beta blocking activity of propranolol is not potentiated by morphine and halothane anesthesia but, rather, their effects are additive.", 
    "2": "The tissue distribution of propranolol after i.v. administration (1.5 and 7.5 mg/kg) was studied in rats. Lung, brain and kidney showed extensive propranolol tissue binding. Propranolol uptake by lung seemed to be a saturable process. In contrast to the above tissues, liver propranolol concentrations remained low over the time period of study. An increase in the propranolol T1/2 was noted at the high dose and seemed to result from reduced systemic clearance and an increase in the apparent volume of distribution. Microsomal and mitochondrial fractions from several tissues contained substantial amounts of propranolol after i.v. administration and in vitro incubation with homogenates. Cytosol proteins did not bind significant amounts of propranolol. Equilibrium dialysis studies with rat liver mitochondrial and microsomal fractions revealed both high affinity, low capacity propranolol binding sites and low affinity, high capacity sites. At low concentrations, propranolol interaction with rat liver microsomes produced a type I difference spectrum with high affinity binding of similar magnitude to that observed with equilibrium dialysis. Higher concentrations of propranolol produced a saturable shift in the difference spectra with reduced binding affinity for propranolol. Results from these studies indicate that particulate fractions from several tissues contribute to the extensive tissue binding of propranolol.", 
    "3": "The effect of propranolol on serum levels of total and free thyroxine, total and free triiodothyronine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was investigated in 15 clinical euthyroid patients with essential hypertension. Oral propranolol in dosages from 80 to 480 mg/day for a 30-day period induced an average increase in total serum thyroxine of 15.5 +/- 2.2% (mean +/- SEM, 2 p = 0.00002) and in free thyroxine of 17.7 +/- 3.5% (2 p = 0.00009). The oral dose of propranolol correlated positively with serum propranolol (r = 0.70, 2 p = 0.007). No significant correlation between serum propranolol and changes in serum thyroxine could be demonstrated. Total and free triiodothyronine, as well as TSH, remained unchanged during propranolol treatment. The most likely explanation is a propranolol-induced decreased degradation of thyroxine. A practical consequence is that in patients with an uncertain clinical picture and slightly elevated serum thyroxine, propranolol intake should be considered.", 
    "4": "Propranolol serum levels during a 24-hr period were determined every 2 hr in 9 hospitalized patients with angina pectoris after oral administration of 40 mg of propranolol 3 times a day. After the first, second, and third tablets the mean maximum serum propranolol concentrations averaged 118 +/- 71 ng/ml, 134 +/- 97 ng/ml, and 118 +/- 94 ng/ml and the mean minimum concentrations averaged 21 +/- 18 ng/ml, 45 +/- 25 ng/ml, and 54 +/- 34 ng/ml (+/-SD), respectively. These data show a very wide inter- and intraindividual variation in serum propranolol levels. No relationship was found between serum level and blood pressure or dose (related to body weight).", 
    "5": "The effect of ouabain on left ventricular function in nonfailing hearts was assessed in 14 chronically instrumented dogs during graded treadmill exercise. At rest, ouabain increased the maximum first derivative of the left ventricular pressure (dp/dtmax) and stroke volume by 38% and 16%, respectively. No change occurred in end-diastolic left ventricular diameter or peak systolic left ventricular pressure. During exercise, ouabain reduced maximum running speed and limited the increments in heart rate and systolic pressure but did not alter dp/dtmax, stroke volume, or end-diastolic diameter. When atropine and ouabain were given and severe exercise was performed, there were no differences from controls in running speed, heart rate, dp/dtmax, or other parameters. When ouabain and propranolol were given dp/dtmax increased at rest and during exercise, compared with results with propranolol alone. It is concluded that the inotropic effect of ouabain is negligible during strenuous physical activity because of the presence of high levels of sympathetic stimulation. However, during exercise in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade, increases in myocardial contractility do occur in response to ouabain.", 
    "6": "Patients with early symptomatic mitral stenosis usually suffer from pulmonary congestion on the basis of left atrial and pulmonary venous hypertension. They are often in sinus rhythm, and cardiac output is usually well maintained. Symptoms occur most often when heart rate, cardiac output, or both are increased. In this study, intravenous propranolol administered to patients with pure mitral stenosis in sinus rhythm resulted in significant reductions in mitral diastolic gradient (-7.1 mm. Hg +/- 1.6 SED), mean pulmonary wedge pressure (--6.9 mm. Hg +/- 1.2) and mean pulmonary artery pressures (--9.0 mm. Hg +/- 1.2). This was due to simultaneous reduction of heart rate (--13.0 beats/minute +/- 2.6 and cardiac output (--0.5 L./minute +/- 0.2). A small associated reduction of left ventricular systolic pressure (--5.1 mm. Hg +/- 2.6) was not accompanied by adverse clinical effects. A potential role for propranolol in medical management of pure mitral stenosis in the presence of sinus rhythm is suggested.", 
    "7": "The concentration of both plasma renin and plasma arginine vasopressin rose in normal subjects after an 85 degrees head-up tilt. Plasma renin activity, which increased 70-80% above the supine value, was maximal at 15 or 30 min, whereas the six- to seven-fold increase of plasma arginine vasopressin concentration was observed between 30 and 45 min. Intravenous propranolol administered just before tilt was used to investigate the possibility that the delayed rise of arginine vasopressin was stimulated by renin. Although the response of plasma renin was completely abolished by propranolol, the response of vasopressin was unaffected. These findings suggest that the release of vasopressin that follows isosmolar hypovolemia achieved by orthostasis may occur independently of changes in the renin-angiotensin system in the presence of propranolol.", 
    "8": "In a small group of hypertensive patients studied at home, once daily early morning sotalol therapy effectively decreased lying, standing, and post-exercise blood pressure and pulse rate. A dose-response relationship was seen. Adverse effects were mild and transient. The once daily regimen is easy to administer and appears to give precision in blood pressure reduction. Providing there is no subsequent escape from control, once daily beta-blocking therapy should aid long-term hypertension treatment in general practice.", 
    "9": "Cessation of long-term treatment of rats with propranolol 10 mg/kg/day subcutaneously produced no alteration in the myocardial noradrenaline content estimated 12, 24, 48 and 96 hours after the last propranolol injection; nor did the myocardial acetylcholine content change. These results do not support the idea that the withdrawal-rebound phenomenon caused by abrupt cessation of propranolol therapy is associated with an accumulation of the autonomic neurotransmitters in myocardial tissue.", 
    "10": "Four patients suffering form familial periodic paralysis with hypokalaemia (FPP) were subjected untreated to standardized induction of paralysis. The induction was repeated after pre-treatment with the beta receptor blocker propranolol (Inderal). In three of the patients propranolol had no or even a negative effect upon the development of paralysis or upon the fall in serum potassium. In one patient a slight prophylactic gain was achieved. It was not possible to demonstrate any difference in the serum level of glucose or insulin during the induction of paralysis according to whether the patients were untreated or treated with propranolol. Short-lasting out-patient treatment of the patient who had apparently had some slight prophylactic benefit from propranolol had to be discontinued after 11 days because of an unusually severe and long-lasting attack. It is concluded that propranolol has no major effect in the treatment of FPP-unlike its favourable effect in thyrotoxic familial periodic paralysis (TFPP).", 
    "11": "The effects of intravenous dl-propranolol (5 mg/kg), 1- and d-alprenolol (5 mg/kg), on blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were investigated in normotensive and spontaneously, renal or neurogenic hypertensive rats. The animals were either awake or anaesthetized with urethane, chloralose or pentobarbital. Anaesthesia may induce hemodynamic changes in hypertensive rats; thus urethane decreased peripheral vascular resistance in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In anaesthetized rats, dl-propranolol, 1- and d-alprenolol caused significant falls in blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. The hypotensive activity was related to the initial blood pressure. Peripheral vascular resistance remained unchanged except in spontaneously hypertensive, chloralose anaesthetized rats. 1-Alprenolol had less cardiac effects than dl-propranolol. The decrease of blood pressure was shorter and/or smaller after d-alprenolol than after 1-alprenolol. In normotensive and renal hypertensive awake rats, dl-propranolol induced a short fall of blood pressure, due to a decrease of heart rate and cardiac output. These effects, except bradycardia, were not observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats. These results suggest that differences in the initial vascular state, in the hypertensive models and in the anaesthetics used can explain the variability of the responses to beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Moreover, beta-blocking as well as quinidine-like activities are involved in the cardiovascular responses to dl-propranolol, d-alprenolol and 1-alprenolol studied here.", 
    "12": "Effects of several drugs on the automaticity of blood-perfused canine sino-atrial node preparation were examined by injecting drugs into the sinus node artery. All drugs produced a dose-dependent decrease in sino-atrial rate, although dl-alprenolol in low doses produced a slight increase, and their relative potencies determined on the basis of the molar doses producing a decrease by 15 beats/min (ED 15) were in the descending order: SK&F24260 greater than or equal to nifedipine greater than or equal to adenosine greater than quinidine greater than dl-propranolol greater than or equal to dl-alprenolol greater than procaine, and 1:1/1.2:1/2.0:1/28.8:1/114.2:1/123.8:1/704.2. Potencies of dl- and d-alprenolol and propranolol in causing a negative chronotropic action were almost equal. In higher doses, SK&F24260 and nifedipine (3-10 microgram), quinidine (0.3-1 mg), dl-propranolol and alprenolol (0.3-1 mg), and procaine (1-3 mg) caused a sino-atrial arrest. The order of potency in causing arrest was approximately similar to that in causing arrest was approximately similar to that in causing a negative chronotropic action (ED 15). Adenosine showed a profound negative chronotropic effect but did not cause a sino-atrial arrest. The negative chronotropic action and sino-atrial arrest caused by dl- and d-alprenolol and propranolol, quinidine and procaine maybe due mainly to their calcium antagonistic properties, but it is considered that their action sites are individually different. Furthermore, we suggest that in conscious dogs the tachycardia produced by the systemic administration of dl-alprenolol is not entirely due to its intrinsic sympathomimetic effect.", 
    "13": "The response of the rabbit perfused oviduct in vivo to phenylephrine (PE), isoproterenol (ISO) and epinephrine (EPI) was studied to determine if a purported change from alpha-adrenergic receptor dominance to beta-adrenergic receptor dominance during early gestation occurs (i.e. prior to implantation). The response of the tissue to PE did not change during early gestation, even in the presence of beta-receptor blockade by propranolol. The response to ISO of the PE-stimulated oviduct also did not change. However, the dose-response curve to EPI was shifted horizontally to the right 4 days after mating suggesting a tissue desensitization. It was concluded that the decreased oviductal sensitivity to EPI observed during early gestation could not be attributed to a change from alpha-receptor dominance to beta-receptor dominance.", 
    "14": "The positive inotropic effect of dopamine has been studied in isolated ventricular strips of guinea-pig heart. The concentration-inotropic response curve for dopamine was significantly shifted to the right by pretreatment with reserpine. In preparations obtained from animals pretreated with reserpine (2.5 mg/kg, 24 h prior to the experiment) the dose-response curve was not significantly affected by haloperidol, a dopamine vascular receptor antagonist (10(-6)-3X10(-6) M). The inotropic effect of dopamine was antagonized by practolol (3X10(-7)-10(-6) M), but not by phentolamine (3X10(-6)-10(-5) M); moreover the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drug (10(-5) M) did not affect the curve for dopamine in the presence of practolol (3X10(-7) M). In preparations in which fast sodium channels were blocked by K+ -rich medium, slow electrical responses (calcium-mediated action potentials) as well as contractions were induced by high concentrations of dopamine (10(-4)-3X10(-4) M); again these responses were unaffected by phentolamine or haloperidol, but were blocked by practolol. It was concluded that in the guinea-pig ventricular muscle dopamine induced a positive inotropic effect through both indirect and direct action, and that the latter is due to the activation of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "15": "1. To study the function of the left ventricular mechanoreceptors, a working left ventricle preparation was devised in dogs which permitted control of pressure and flow of the isolated perfused coronary circulation and of the flow of the isolated, separately perfused systemic circulation. The systemic circulation was perfused at a constant rate so that changes in systemic pressure reflected changes in systemic resistance.2. Increases in myocardial contractility produced by injection of catecholamines into the isolated, perfused coronary circulation produced a fall in the pressure (resistance) of the isolated, separately perfused (at a constant rate) systemic circulation.3. Completeness of isolation of the coronary and systemic circulations was shown by the marked difference in appearance times between the reflex hypotensive responses from catecholamine injections into the isolated coronary circulation and the direct hypertensive response from a similar injection when the circulations were connected as well as by the marked difference between the pressure pulses recorded simultaneously on both sides of the aortic balloon separating the two circulations.4. Myocardial beta receptor blockade produced by injection of propranolol into the isolated coronary circulation abolished or attenuated the changes in left ventricular myocardial contractility as well as the subsequent hypotensive responses following the similar injection of catecholamines.5. Electrical stimulation of a sympathetic nerve innervating the heart resulted in increases in left ventricular myocardial contractility and subsequent systemic hypotensive responses indistinguishable from those following injection of catecholamines.6. That distortion of the mechano- or stretch receptors in the left ventricular myocardium was the cause of the hypotensive responses was demonstrated by increasing left ventricular myocardial contractility by mechanically obstructing the left ventricular outflow which produced hypotensive responses similar to those following the injection of catecholamines or nerve stimulation.7. Bilateral high cervical vagotomy abolished the hypotensive responses following injection of catecholamines into the isolated coronary circulation or following left ventricular outflow obstruction in all but one instance, indicating the importance of vagal fibres to the afferent arm of the reflex.8. It is suggested that the left ventricular mechanoreceptors function normally to reduce the peripheral resistance in order to prepare the systemic circulation to receive the left ventricular output and, especially during exercise, to prepare the systemic circulation to receive the augmented cardiac output with a minimum alteration in the systemic blood pressure and to distribute this augmented output preferentially to the skeletal muscles.", 
    "16": "1. In dogs i.v. injection of serotonin caused a rise in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary arteriocapillary resistance that persisted even after alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade; pulmonary venous resistance also increased, but this was abolished by pretreatment with either propranolol or phenoxybenzamine. 2. The injection of serotonin into the ascending aorta produced an immediate rise in systemic, pulmonary arterial and pulmonary venous pressures and pulmonary venous resistance. After phenoxybenzmine, the rise in systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures remained unchanged, but previously observed increases in pulmonary venous pressure and resistance were blocked. In contrast, propranolol failed to abolish the rise in pulmonary venous resistance after serotonin injection into the ascending aorta. 3. These results confirm the observation that the vasoconstrictor effect attributed to intravenously injected serotonin on the arterial side of the pulmonary circulation is independent of the known sympathetic pathways. The data suggest that the pulmonary venoconstriction induced by intravenous serotonin is of reflex origin, abolished by alpha and beta receptor blockade, whereas the efferent arm of the reflex pulmonary venoconstriction following injection of serotonin into the ascending aorta is mediated via alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "17": "1. Distension of the pulmonary vein-left atrial junctions caused an increase in heart rate and a transient decrease in mean arterial pressure. 2. Section of the brain stem at the level of the inferior cerebellar peduncle (rostral medulla) caused a decrease in mean arterial pressure. 3. Section of the rostral medulla had no effect on either the magnitude or the time course of the reflex response to pulmonary vein distension. 4. Administration of propranolol after section in the rostral medulla reduced the reflex increase in heart rate in response to pulmonary vein distension by an amount similar to that previously described in intact and decerebrate animals. 5. Bilateral cervial vagotomy prevented the reflex response to pulmonary vein distension.", 
    "18": "The effects of norepinephrine and acetylcholine on smooth muscle cells of isolated strips of gastric arteries were studied. The gastric arteries revealed small sensitivity to acetylcholine. The norepinephrine effects on smooth muscle cells can be realized through electrogenic and pharmacomechanical activation. The adrenergic control of gastric arteries is fulfilled mainly with alpha-adrenoreceptors participation.", 
    "19": "1. Noradrenaline, isoprenaline, and phenylephrine have been applied my microiontophoresis to neurones in the guinea pig cerebral cortex. All three compounds produced depression of neuronal firing, and all could be antagonized to some extent by phentolamine or propranolol. 2. The responses to isoprenaline were substantially reduced in size after a few applications. Noradrenaline and phenylephrine responses were partially reduced at the time of isoprenaline insensitivity, and the responses could now be blocked completely by phentolamine. 3. The results suggest that two kinds of receptors are present in the guinea pig cerebral cortex, with properties similar to alpha and beta receptors in the periphery. A single receptor with intermediate properties would not readily explain the present results. 4. The results are not consistent with the proposal that alpha receptors mediate neuronal excitation, and beta receptors inhibition in the cerebral cortex. 5. It is also suggested that the failure of some previous studies on guinea pig cortex in vitro to demonstrate the presence of beta receptors may be due to the particularly rapid desensitization of these receptors.", 
    "20": "Infusion of pentagastrin (5-G) into the femoral vein of anaesthesized dogs, in doses of 0.20 microgram/kg/min for 30 minutes, causes a prompt and significant increase in plasma IRI. The insulin-secretory effect of the peptide was not affected by 0.5 mg/kg i.v. of propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocking agent) or by 1.3 mg/kg i.v. of practolol (a selective beta1-adrenergic blocking agent). These results show that the action of 5-G on the pancreatic beta-cells could be not related to the beta-adrenergic system.", 
    "21": "The effects of i.v. infusions of catecholamines on the plasma levels of uric acid and allantoin were investigated in the conscious rat. Isoproterenol and epinephrine, in this decreasing order of potency, remarkably elevated both uric and allantoin levels. Norepinephrine did not affect these purine metabolite levels. These effects of isoproterenol and epinephrine were completely abolished by propranolol. Phentolamine, on the contrary, slightly potentiated the effects of epinephrine. In contrast to i.v. fusion, s.c. injection of epinephrine had no effect, but, after prior treatment of animals with phentolamine, elicited striking increases in the plasma purine metabolite levels. Catecholamines thus caused hyperuricemia with a rise in plasma allantoin, both effects being mediated via beta-adrenoceptors and alpha-adrenergic mechanism sometimes functions in such a manner as to mask or inhibit this beta-mediated response.", 
    "22": "The haemodynamic responses to minimum equipotent concentrations of halothane and enflurane were compared in seven dogs. The haemodynamic responses to increasing concentrations of enflurane, and to induced hypovolaemia during enflurane anaesthesia, were studied in the same dogs, both before and after administration of propranolol 0.3 mg kg-1 i.v. In equipotent concentrations, enflurane caused marginally greater impairment of left ventricular function than halothane, and caused a dose-dependent reduction of arterial pressure, cardiac output and myocardial contractility. Following administration of propranolol, these haemodynamic effects of enflurane were marked, and withdrawal of 20% of estimated blood volume was tolerated poorly.", 
    "23": "In six dogs chronically implanted with flow and pressure transducers, equipotent inspired concentrations of halothane and isoflurane were determined as the minimum inspried concentration of each agent which would abolish an individual dog's response to paw clamping. In equipotent concentration, isoflurane (1.2%, SD 0.2%) caused less myocardial depression than halothane (1.0%, SD 0.1%). Dose-response studies were possible up to a mean inspired isoflurane concentration of 3.0%, both before and after propranolol 0.3 mg kg-1, i.v. After propranolol, sensitive indices of myocardial contractility were depressed at all concentrations of isoflurane, indicating a moderate degree of beta-receptor activation by isoflurane. The haemodynamic response to hypovolaemia during isoflurane anaesthesia was not modified by propranolol.", 
    "24": "The pathophysiology of angina pectoris is best understood as an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand. The primary determinants of myocardial oxygen demand are heart rate, arterial pressure, heart size, myocardial contractility, and myocardial mass. The medical therapy of angina pectoris is directed toward reducing myocardial oxygen demand by reducing the workload of the heart and the specific determinants listed. The most common medications used in the treatment of angina pectoris are nitroglycerin and propranolol. Nitroglycerin reduces myocardial oxygen demand primarily by reducing heart size and arterial pressure. Propranolol reduces oxygen demand primarily by reducing heart rate. Medical therapy is generally effective in controlling the symptoms of angina pectoris in 80% or more of the patients and allows them to lead useful and productive lives.", 
    "25": "The nature and mechanisms of pulmonary vascular responses which follow miliary pulmonary embolism were examined in intact dogs in which the isolated left lower lobe was perfused at constant blood flow. Embolization of the lung with plastic microspheres increased total pulmonary vascular resistance, whereas, in contrast, vascular resistance of the isolated perfused left lower lobe which was protected from embolization was decreased. This vasodilation was prevented by chronic denervation of the lobe and by ganglionic blockade. Cervical vagotomy also blocked the response but atropine failed to alter the vasodilation. The response, which appeared to be reflex in origin and involve efferent sympathetic pathways, was prevented by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade produced by propranolol. Since the lobar vascular response to norepinephrine was significantly enhanced by propranolol, it was concluded that embolization of the lung evokes pulmonary vascular reflex vasodilation which is mediated over the sympathetic nervous system via a beta-adrenergic receptor mechanism.", 
    "26": "The metabolism of l-bunolol, a new beta-blocking drug, was studied in man after single oral 3-mg doses of 3H-labeled compound. Absorption from the gut was rapid and virtually complete. Peak levels of bunolol and of dihydrobunolol, an active metabolite, were observed at 1 hr. Excretion of the administered radioactivity was mainly into the urine (78% in 4 days), with only 3% appearing in the feces. Bunolol, bunolol glucuronide, bunolol sulfate, dihydrobunolol, and dihydrobunolol glucuronide were identified and quantified in the plasma. These compounds represented 82% of the radioactivity in plasma at 30 min and 55% at 24 hr. Plasma half-lives (+/-S.D.) were estimated to be 6.1 +/- 0.3 hr for bunolol, 9.1 +/- 1.9 hr for bunolol glucuronide, 17.4 +/- 2.5 hr for bunolol sulfate, 7.1 +/- 0.5 hr for dihydrobunolol, and 7.7 +/- 0.8 hr for dihydrobunolol glucuronide.", 
    "27": "It has recently been suggested that adenylate cyclase activity is controlled by a regulatory cycle consisting of two reactions: a hormone induced formation of the active adenylate cyclase-GTP complex, and a subsequent turn-off reaction in which hydrolysis of the bound nucleotide reverts the system to the inactive state. To test this model each of the two reactions was measured separately and their rate constants were used to estimate the steady state adenylate cyclase and GTPase activities. The first order rate constants were kon = 3 min-1 for the activation reaction and koff = 15 min-1 for the turn-off reaction. Substitution of these rate constants in the steady state equation of the regulatory cycle gave values of hormone stimulated adenylate cyclase and GTPase activities similar to those determined by direct measurements. Treatment of the adenylate cyclase with cholera toxin caused a decrease of 96% in the rate constant of the turn-off reaction. In this case too the activities calculated from the steady state equation were in good agreement with those determined directly.", 
    "28": "To assess in man the effects of autonomic blockade on the response of catecholamines in the coronary circulation to dynamic exercise, arterial and coronary sinus catecholamine concentrations were measured in six patients during supine cycling exercise, following atropine 1.8 mg and oxprenolol 0.2 mg/kg iv. Although arterial concentrations did not increase significantly, coronary sinus catecholamine concentrations increased from 2.54 +/- 0.59 nmol/1 at rest 4.44 +/- 1.3 nmol/1 during exercise (P less than 0.05; one-tailed test) and were associated with a small increase in heart rate and coronary sinus cyclic AMP concentrations from 9.4 +/- 0.7 nmol/1 (rest) to 11.6 +/- 1.1 nmol/1 (exercise) (0.05 greater than P greater than 0.01). Although autonomic blockade may have increased catecholamine release, this was not reflected in an increased efflux of catecholamines from the heart, because similar increases in coronary sinus catecholamine concentrations occurred in the absence of autonomic blockade.", 
    "29": "1 Noradrenaline (0.1-3.0 muM) inhibited the twitch responses to single pulse field stimulation of the isolated vas deferens of the mouse. The higher concentrations of noradrenaline (ca. 0.3-3.0 muM) were required to make the tissue contract.2 Phentolamine (10 muM) abolished the contractor response to higher concentrations of noradrenaline and antagonized the inhibitory effect of lower concentrations on the twitch response.3 Propranolol (10 muM) potentiated both the contractor and the inhibitory effect of noradrenaline on the twitch response.4 Isoprenaline (0.1-3.0 muM) and salbutamol (1.0-3.0 muM) both inhibited the twitch response. Their effects were antagonized by propranolol (10 muM), but not by practolol (10 muM).5 The effects of uptake(1) and uptake(2) blocking agents were determined. Cocaine (10 muM) reduced the size of the twitch response in 2 out of 4 experiments. Imipramine (0.18 muM) also reduced the size of the twitch, as did oestradiol (3.7 muM) and a combination of cocaine and oestradiol.6 Contractor responses to exogenous noradrenaline showed tachyphylaxis, but when this was not very marked, the response could be shown to be potentiated by uptake blocking agents.7 The inhibitory effect of noradrenaline on the twitch response was greatly potentiated by cocaine (10 muM) and much less so by oestradiol (3.7 muM).8 It is concluded that the transmitter responsible for the twitch response is either an unknown substance released from the sympathetic neurone, or noradrenaline acting upon a receptor with none of the characteristics of known alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors. In either case, noradrenaline can inhibit the output, probably by stimulation of presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "30": "Rabbit uterine muscle may contract or relax with adrenergic stimulation depending on the hormonal milieu. This difference in contractile activity has been shown to be due to alteration of adrenergic response between alpha-adrenergic (contraction) and beta-adrenergic (relaxation). When rabbits are treated with estrogen followed by progesterone, norepinephrine produces myometrial relaxation. This effect is blocked by propranolol, indicating that it is mediated by beta receptor activation. A subcellular preparation of this myometrium has adenylate cyclase activity that can be stimulated by isoproterenol + guanyl-5'-yl-imidodi-phosphate (Gpp(NH)p). The radioligand [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol binds to the same preparation. The binding is rapid, 80% maximal in 10 min, and readily reversible (t1/2 = 5 min). The binding is high affinity (Kd = 0.12 nM), low capacity (15 fmol/mg protein), and is to a single class of binding sites. Binding is competed for stereoselectively by beta adrenergic agonists and antagonists. The competition of beta adrenergic agonists for binding, isoproterenol = ritodrine greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine, is consistent with interactions at a beta2-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "31": "Alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors were studied by measuring the binding of 3H-dihydroergocryptine and 3H-dihydroalprenolol, respectively, to membranes prepared from homogenized rabbit iris--ciliary bodies. The binding of 3H-dihydroergocryptine appears to be specific for alpha-adrenergic receptors, since adrenergic agents displace this radioligand with the following order of potency: phentolamine greater than epinephrine greater than or equal to norepinephrine greater than or equal to isoproterenol = propranolol. The binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol appears to be specific for beta-adrenergic receptors, since adrenergic agents displace this radioligand with the following order of potency: propranolol greater than or equal to isoproterenol greater than or equal to epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than or equal to phentolamine. Clonidine and dopamine bind to the alpha-adrenergic receptor but have little activity at the beta-adrenergic receptor. Timolol, d-isoproterenol, and dipivalyl epinephrine bind to the beta-adrenergic receptor but have little activity at the alpha-adrenergic receptor. The results demonstrate that in vitro binding assays for alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors are useful for studying the mechanism of drug action.", 
    "32": "Antianginal drugs were evaluated on the basis of their ability to protect against subepicardial electrogram changes induced by local ventricular ischemia in anesthetized dogs. Sch 11973 [N-(2-phenylisopropyl)-N-p-toluene sulfonyl urea], a potential new antianginal agent, was also effective against local ventricular ischemia with its maximum effect appearing at 1mg/kg, i.v. or i.d. and with a duration of at least 2 hours. Nitroglycerin, at a dose of 0.04 mg/kg given bucally, exerted less protection, lasting on the average less than 15 minutes. Protection by propranolol at 1 mg/kg, i.v., was not better than nitroglycerin, but lasted up to one hour, while dipyridamole was ineffective when given in a dose range of 0.1-10 mg/kg, i.v. Sch 11973 differed from standard antianginal agents which may act via beta-adrenergic blocking activity or alteration of cardiac or circulatory dynamics since no acute pharmacological changes were observed after Sch 11973 was administered.", 
    "33": "The synthesis of two high-affinity fluorescent beta-adrenergic blockers is described: dl-N(1)-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl]-N(2)-(9-acridyl)-1,2-propanediamine (9-aminoacridylpropanolol, 9-AAP) and dl-N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl]-N'-dansylethylenediamine (dansyl analogue of propranolol, DAPN). Both 9-AAP and DAPN inhibit competitively the l-epinephrine-dependent adenylate cyclase activity [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] in turkey erythrocyte membranes without affecting the fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Similarly, 9-AAP and DAPN inhibit in a competitive manner the binding of [(125)I]-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol to these beta-adrenergic receptors. The two fluorescent beta-adrenergic blockers 9-AAP and DAPN probe specifically beta-adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system as well as in other organs when injected into rats. The fluorescence pattern can be monitored by fluorescence microscopy performed on cryostat slices of these organs. The appearance of the characteristic fluorescence pattern can be blocked in a stereospecific fashion by a prior injection of l-propranolol and not by a prior injection of d-propranolol. These compounds therefore offer a powerful means to map beta-adrenergic receptors in vivo. The stereospecific displacement of 9-AAP from the beta-adrenergic receptors of turkey erythrocyte membranes by l-propranolol and by l-epinephrine can be detected in vitro using front-face fluorescence. The potential use of these compounds to probe beta-receptors in vitro and in vivo is discussed.", 
    "34": "Subtetanic contractions of the isolated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) of the guinea-pig, a fast-contracting muscle, were evoked by transmural field stimulation. Isoprenaline, adrenaline, terbutaline, and noradrenaline each caused a dose-dependent increase in the force of contraction, their potencies decreasing in that order. Tyramine was without effect in this respect. Curare depressed the contractions of EDL by about 20% but did not appreciably change the response to the beta-adrenoceptor agonists. The effects of isoprenaline and noradrenaline were blocked by propranolol (unselective) and H 35/25 (1-(p-tolyl)-2-isopropylamino-1-propanol, beta2-selective) but not by practolol (beta1-selective). Moreover, the increase in the force of subtetanic contractions of EDL produced by noradrenaline was unaffected by phentolamine. It is concluded that the adrenoceptor mediating the increase in the force of contraction of the isolated EDL is of the beta2-type and that the site of action is direct on the muscle. Its similarity to the receptor mediating the inverse effect on the slow-contracting soleus-muscle is pointed out.", 
    "35": "In human cerebral cortex slices noradrenaline, isoproterenol (a beta-adrenergic agonist), dopamine, apomorphine (a dopaminergic agonist), and serotonin stimulated cyclic AMP formation: noradrenaline greater than or equal to isoproterenol greater than dopamine = apomorphine = serotonin. Clonidine (and alpha-adrenergic agonist) was ineffective in stimulating cyclic AMP formation in temporal cortex slices. The stimulatory effect of noradrenaline and isoproterenol was blocked by propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocker) but not by phentolamine (an alpha-adrenergic blocker). Pimozide (a selective dopaminergic antagonist) inhibited the increase of cyclic AMP formation induced by dopamine or apomorphine but not that induced by noradrenaline, isoproterenol, or serotonin. Neither propranolol or phentolamine had any effect on dopamine- or serotonin-stimulated cyclic AMP formation. Chlorpromazine blocked the increase of cyclic AMP formation induced by noradrenaline, dopamine or serotonin, while cyproheptadine, a putative central serotonergic antagonist, was ineffective. These observations suggest that there may be at least two monoamine-sensitive adenylate cyclases in human cerebral cortex which have the characteristics of a beta-adrenergic and a dopaminergic receptor, respectively, and also possibly a serotonergic receptor.", 
    "36": "1. The beta-adrenoceptor stimulant properties of 5-(1-hydroxy-2-isopropylaminobutyl)-8-hydroxy-carbostyril hydrochloride hemihydrate (OPC-2009) were compared with those of isoprenaline and salbutamol on guinea-pig isolated tissues. 2. In producing tracheal relaxation, OPC-2009 was approximately 7 times more potent and salbutamol 5 times less potent than isoprenaline. Both compounds were less potent than isoprenaline in increasing either the rate of beating of isolated right atria or the contractile force of left atria, OPC-2009 being 4 and 127 times and salbutamol being 100 and 700 times less potent on the respective preparations. 3. Selectivity calculated from EC50 ratio indicates that OPC-2009 was approximately 26 times and salbutamol approximately 21 times more selective than isoprenaline for tracheal smooth muscle as compared to right atrial muscle, whereas OPC-2009 was approximately 850 times and salbutamol 140 times more selective than isoprenaline for tracheal smooth muscle as compared to left atria. 4. The responses to OPC-2009 on trachea and right atria were not altered by treatment of animals with reserpine 24 h previously. Propranolol was a competitive antagonist of OPC-2009 on these tissues. 5. OPC-2009 at high concentrations competitively antagonized the positive chronotropic and inotropic responses to isoprenaline, indicating that OPC-2009 like salbutamol, may be classified as a partial agonist. 6. The results indicate that the action of OPC-2009 is more selective for tracheal smooth muscle than cardiac muscle and are interpreted in the light of subdivisions of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "37": "A new series of beta-adrenergic blocking amines containing an oximino-propanolic chain linked to an aromatic nucleus was synthesized. Most of the derivatives are characterized by beta2-selectivity. The structure-activity relationship are discussed. One of the compounds, selected for further studies, was more active on the trachea than on the atria of guinea pig, 155 times in vitro and 26 times in vivo. In comparison, butoxamine's beta2-selectivity is 13 in vitro and only 2 in vivo. With a series of 30 acetophenone oxime derivatives, no quantitative structure-activity relationships could be detected.", 
    "38": "The synthesis is described of a series of derivatives of 1-phenoxy-3-phenoxyalkylamino-2-propanols and 1-alkoxyalkylamino-3-phenoxy-2-propranols. The compounds were investigated for their beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties and many showed a surprising degree of cardioselectivity when tested in vivo in anesthetized cats for their effects on an isoproterenol-induced tachycardia and depressor response. The structure-activity relationship shown by this series of compounds is related to that of known cardioselective analogues and a possible reason for their cardioselectivity is discussed.", 
    "39": "Carbuterol is a beta-adrenergic bronchodilator with selectivity for bronchial smooth muscle relative to cardiac and vascular tissues of several species including man. The present studies were undertaken to further characterize its adrenergic profile. In vitro studies demonstrated that carbuterol was a direct acting beta-adrenergic agonist, not dependent on endogenous catecholamine release, and was devoid of alpha-adrenergic agonist activity. The activity of the racemate was shown to reside primarily in the l-enantiomer. Carbuterol inhibited immunologically induced release of histamine and slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis from passively sensitized fragmented rhesus monkey lung and also inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats. The relatively weak stimulant activity of carbuterol on beta1 receptors mediating both rate and force of contraction was confirmed in anesthetized open-chest dogs. In the anesthetized cat, carbuterol was significantly less potent than isoproterenol in decreasing diastolic blood pressure, increasing heart rate, and decreasing the tension and degree of fusion of incomplete tetanic contraction of the soleus muscle.", 
    "40": "Recent advances in alcohol withdrawal states are described. New concepts of classification, the development of the syndrome and its management are outlined. In the light of recent research, more optimistic results for this much maligned but common condition may be achieved.", 
    "41": "Rats maintained on diets containing 6.5% ethanol or equicaloric sucrose solutions were challenged at weekly intervals with 1.5 or 2.0 g/kg ethanol or isotonic saline 14 h after withdrawal from the diet. Tolerance developed to both the hyperactivating (increased line crossings and time active) and discoordinating (disrupted rotarod performance) effects of the 1.5 g/kg dose of ethanol, but was less obvious with the 2.0 g/kg dose. Chlorpromazine (2.5 mg/kg) had a greater depressant effect in animals chronically treated with ethanol, suggesting that some alterations in the functioning of noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic systems may accompany chronic ethanol treatment. However, amphetamine and propranolol did not appear to affect ethanol- and sucrose-treated rats differently. The present studies have therefore shown a parallel development of tolerance to the discoordinating and hyperactivating effects of ethanol and have implicated an underlying noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic mechanism, although the precise nature of the mechanism has not been clarified.", 
    "42": "In 30 healthy volunteers after an oral administration of 50 mg metoprolol basal and 150 min platelet counts were determined. A significant negative correlation (p less than 0.01) between the baseline platelet count and the percentage increase at 150 min was shown to be present. It is postulated that this observation reflects interindividual differences between the magnitude of the exchangeable splenic platelet pool."
