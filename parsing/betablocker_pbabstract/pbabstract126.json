Twenty-one patients with dilated cardiomyopathy who were treated with carvedilol adjacent to standard heart failure therapy were enrolled in the study. Echocardiographic assessment was obtained before and during carvedilol therapy, and left ventricular fractional shortening and left ventricular ejection fraction were determined in order to estimate left ventricular function. At a follow-up of six months, left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening significantly improved from 38 +/- 10% to 53 +/- 13% and from 19 +/- 6 % to 27 +/- 8%, respectively, following carvedilol treatment. The results of the present study indicate that carvedilol is well tolerated in children with dilated cardiomyopathy and there is a significant improvement in the clinical status and left ventricular ejection fraction in patients not responding to conventional therapy. Patient selection criteria, optimal timing of carvedilol therapy, its dosage and its long-term effects need to be investigated with multi-institutional trials and large numbers of patients.",

The anti-contractile effect of matrine was not reduced by the highly selective ATP-dependent K+ channel blocker glibenclamide (10(-5) mol/L), either by the non-selective K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (10(-3) mol/L), or by the beta-antagonist propranolol (10(-5) mol/L). In either \"normal\" or \"Ca(2+)-free\" bathing medium, the phenylephrine-induced contraction was attenuated by matrine (3.3 x 10(-3) mol/L), indicating that the vasorelaxation was due to inhibition of intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ mobilization.",

Several in vitro metabolism assays have been developed over the last two decades, to replace time-consuming and expensive animal studies. These have the potential to speed up drug development and increase drug safety, as they can be used to improve the prediction of the effects of drugs on humans. The key factors to be identified in metabolism are: a) the enzymes involved, and b) the metabolites produced by these enzymes. Cytochromes P450 (CYP-450s) are the key enzymes in drug metabolism. Cloning the genes encoding the CYP-450s, and the genetic engineering of suitable cells for heterologous expression, have provided new cell lines for studies on drug metabolism in vitro, under highly defined conditions. The V79 cell line, derived from Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, was found to be suitable for heterologous expression, as these cells themselves do not express CYP-450s, thus providing a clean background for genetically engineering for the stable expression of any cloned CYP-450. In this way, V79 cell lines were created which specifically express CYP-450s from human, mouse, rat, and fish. These recombinant V79 cells have been applied in several drug metabolism and toxicity studies.", 
    "6": "This study investigated whether improvement in cardiac function and attenuation of cardiac remodeling by some beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) antagonists were associated with a depression in sympathetic activity in congestive heart failure (CHF) due to myocardial infarction (MI). Although cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy and dilatation as well as increased plasma level of catecholamines are known to occur in CHF, the relationship between these parameters is poorly understood. Three weeks after occlusion of the coronary artery, rats were treated daily with 20 and 75 mg/kg of either atenolol or propranolol for 5 weeks. Sham-operated rats served as controls. Both atenolol and propranolol at 20 and 75 mg/kg doses attenuated the MI-induced cardiac hypertrophy, increases in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure, LV end-systolic volume and LV end-diastolic volume as well as depressions in LV systolic pressure, LV fractional shortening and cardiac output. PR interval was decreased and QT( c ) interval was increased in CHF; these alterations were ameliorated by both atenolol and propranolol. The increased level of plasma epinephrine in CHF was also depressed by both low and high doses of atenolol and propranolol whereas the increased level of plasma norepinephrine was reduced by high but not low doses of these drugs. The results indicate that the beneficial effects of beta-AR antagonists on cardiac remodeling and heart dysfunction in CHF may be due to the blockade of beta-ARs in the myocardium and a depression in the sympathetic activity.",

Although her history failed to reveal any cardiac disease, her pre-operative electrocardiogram (ECG) showed an extremely prolonged QT interval of up to 528 msec. Repeated history-taking after admission revealed three syncopal episodes associated with both physical and emotional stress, and because the two-dimensional echocardiography and exercise ECG test were normal except for the prolonged QT interval, an epinephrine test was done to assess QT interval changes after an epinephrine infusion. Immediately after a bolus injection of epinephrine (0.1 microg/kg), marked prolongation of the QT interval developed, followed by polymorphic ventricular tachycardia which was immediately terminated with direct current shock, resulting in the diagnosis of a long QT syndrome (LQTS), probably type 1. Gene studies were recommended, but declined by the patient and her family. She was instructed to avoid competitive sports, and a beta-blocker was prescribed after which she remained symptom-free.", 
    "8": "The United States spends more on health care than other nations, yet our health outcomes remain inferior to those of many countries. Change is therefore necessary. One approach to health care reform is to identify and eliminate practices associated with high cost and limited benefit. Recent research has shown that many perioperative practices meet this definition. An opportunity thus exists for rational reduction of perioperative expenditure. Perioperative tests and treatments improve outcomes only when targeted at specific patient subsets. For example, routine perioperative stress testing provides no incremental diagnostic yield in patients at low risk for cardiac events, and indiscriminate perioperative therapy with beta-blockers can increase mortality in otherwise stable patients. Thus, many \"accepted\" perioperative practices conflict with the evidence and can be safely discontinued while preserving outcomes and reducing costs. Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association perioperative guidelines ensures cost-effective management and promises the greatest benefit for our patients. Our society demands better care at lower cost; in perioperative medicine, it is time for us to throttle back.", 
    "9": "The objective of this study was to determine if sex influences the pharmacokinetics and hemodynamics of the CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol and its interaction with diphenhydramine (CYP2D6 inhibitor) in healthy young participants with high (extensive metabolizer [EM]) or low (poor metabolizer [PM]) CYP2D6 activities. A prespecified comparative analysis of data from 2 sequential clinical trials that included 16 EM and 4 PM women and 10 EM and 6 PM men was performed. The participants in the 2 trials were administered a single oral dose of 100 mg metoprolol in the presence of steady-state diphenhydramine or placebo. Serial plasma and urine samples were obtained for 48 hours, and hemodynamic data was obtained for 12 hours after metoprolol. In the placebo arm, EM and PM women had 62% and 59% higher S-metoprolol AUC(0-infinity) and 26% and 71% lower CL/F, respectively, compared to men with the same phenotype (all Ps < .05 women compared to men). These differences dissipated on body weight (WT) correction. Women (especially PMs) experienced greater negative chronotropic effects of metoprolol than men (P < .0001 women compared to men). Diphenhydramine coadministration increased S-metoprolol AUC by 84% in EM women and 45% in EM men (P < .009 women compared to men). In the diphenhydramine arm, sex differences in pharmacokinetics persisted even after WT correction, resulting in greater negative chronotropic effects in women (all Ps < .05 women compared to men). Metoprolol dose should be adjusted for body weight, particularly in women. Coadministration of a CYP2D6 inhibitor such as diphenhydramine, by a patient at similar doses in the 2 sexes, could result in a greater inhibition of clearance of CYP2D6 substrates with a resulting higher risk of pronounced pharmacological and adverse effects in women compared to men.",

Signalling through this receptor molecule regulates inflammatory mediator secretion by many cell types. The work has been performed in healthy subjects and the authors studied, by cellular culture, flow cytometric analysis and ELISA assay, the expression of CD40 and PGE2 (prostaglandin E2) generation on gingival fibroblasts stimulated by beta-AR (beta-adrenoceptor) agonists. Herein, the authors demonstrate that beta-AR subtype activation via their own specific agonists markedly increased CD40 expression on human gingival fibroblasts. This effect was prevented by beta-AR subtype-specific antagonists. In addition, gingival fibroblast beta-AR stimulation resulted in an increase in PGE2 generation. The inhibition of PLA2 (phospholipase A2) and COX-1 (cyclo-oxygenase-1) but not COX-2 impaired beta-AR increase of PGE2, an effect that was restored by the addition of low concentrations of PGE2, suggesting that PGE2 generation is implicated in the mechanism underlying beta-AR-agonist-mediated CD40 overexpression.

Four types of CM including ioxitalamate (high osmolar and ionic), ioxaglate (low osmolar and ionic), iohexol (low osmolar and nonionic), and iodixanol (iso-osmolar and nonionic) were given iv (1600 mg I/kg body weight) to urethane-anesthetized female Wistar rats. We measured RENA by electrophysiologic recording techniques, renal blood flow with Doppler ultrasound, PRA by radioimmunoassay, and ROS by an in vivo chemiluminescence method. We graded the severity of CM-induced vacuoles in cortical tubular cells stained by hematoxylin and eosin and apoptosis production in outer medulla by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Besides, the effects of pretreatment with iv beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (10 mg/kg body weight), antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg body weight), and renal denervation on CM-induced pathophysiologic parameters were determined. Ioxitalamate significantly increased RENA and renal vascular resistance, PRA, renal ROS production within 1 h, and formation of vacuoles and TUNEL apoptosis in renal tubular cells 2 h later; other CM had less effect on these parameters. On the other hand, propranolol, N-acetylcysteine, or renal denervation partially attenuated the ioxitalamate-aggravated responses on RENA, PRA, ROS production, and vacuole and TUNEL apoptosis formation in renal tubular cells. In conclusion, we suggest that ioxitalamate may induce acute tubular injury via aggravation of RENA, adrenergic signaling, PRA, and ROS production.", 
    "20": "Among increasingly used pharmaceutical products, beta-blockers have been commonly reported at low concentrations in rivers and littoral waters of Europe and North America. Little is known about the toxicity of these chemicals in freshwater ecosystems while their presence may lead to chronic pollution. Hence, in this study the acute toxicity of 3 beta-blockers: metoprolol, propranolol and atenolol on fluvial biofilms was assessed by using several biomarkers. Some were indicative of potential alterations in biofilm algae (photosynthetic efficiency), and others in biofilm bacteria (peptidase activity, bacterial mortality). Propranolol was the most toxic beta-blocker, mostly affecting the algal photosynthetic process. The exposure to 531microg/L of propranolol caused 85% of inhibition of photosynthesis after 24h. Metoprolol was particularly toxic for bacteria. Though estimated No-Effect Concentrations (NEC) were similar to environmental concentrations, higher concentrations of the toxic (503microg/L metoprolol) caused an increase of 50% in bacterial mortality. Atenolol was the least toxic of the three tested beta-blockers. Effects superior to 50% were only observed at very high concentration (707mg/L). Higher toxicity of metoprolol and propranolol might be due to better absorption within biofilms of these two chemicals. Since beta-blockers are mainly found in mixtures in rivers, their differential toxicity could have potential relevant consequences on the interactions between algae and bacteria within river biofilms.",

Adrenergic stimulation of beta(1) receptors in the kidney results in the release of plasma renin, the conversion of peptide precursors to angiotensin II (a2), and ultimately the production of aldosterone. beta(1)-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone receptor antagonists all act by inhibiting the activity of critical protein of this core pathway: the beta(1) receptor, ACE, the a2 receptor, and aldosterone synthase. Investigation of the pharmacogenetic interactions of the ACE D/I polymorphism and heart-failure therapy demonstrates the power of genomics to target therapeutics.

    "24": "Current therapeutic guidelines for chronic heart failure (HF) recommend high (if possible, maximum) target doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers. This is based on \"evidence\" from large-scale trials in selected patient populations. In \"real life\", however, many patients receive doses below defined targets, which is usually classified as \"under-treatment\". When considering whether everyday practice is suboptimal, an important question arises: is more always better and should dosage recommendations be followed in all patients? The superiority of high vs. low-to-moderate doses of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers in reducing mortality from chronic HF has not been documented convincingly. In large trials with beta-blockers, the efficacy of below-target doses was not significantly different from that of high doses. With high-dose lisinopril, a reduction in the rate of hospitalizations was achieved at the cost of more adverse events. A combination of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in chronic HF may also cause more problems than benefits. The risks of high doses of spironolactone, digoxin and diuretics are well-known. Sicker elderly and multimorbid patients often do not tolerate the recommended targets but can still have a good clinical response with an improved outcome at lower doses. Therefore lower-than-target doses may not necessarily be wrong in certain patients and are better than \"no doses\", for example, failure to prescribe essential heart-failure drugs. Individualized doses of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers (best in combination) are indicated in most patients with chronic HF. Less rigid application of guideline recommendations may improve their acceptance.",

The CS-HA-NPs were evaluated for size, shape, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, and mucoadhesive strength. The in vitro release study was also performed in PBS pH 7.4. The ocular irritation potential of CS-HA-NPs was estimated using draize test on albino rabbits. A significant reduction in IOP level was obtained using CS-HA-NPs as compared to plain solution of drug and a comparable higher reduction in IOP level was observed as to CS-NPs. These results suggest that HA potentialy enhance the mucoadhesiveness and efficiency of CS-NPs and may be promising carrier for ocular drug delivery.",

    "47": "Many of the quality measures for patients with heart failure (HF) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) require the completion of comprehensive discharge instructions, including instructions about medications to be taken after discharge. To improve compliance in a tertiary care teaching hospital with these evidence-based quality measures, a clinical-decision-support system (CDSS) that uses an electronic checklist was developed. The CDSS prompts clinicians at every training level to consistently create comprehensive discharge instructions addressing quality measures. The authors compared compliance during the 15-month preintervention and postintervention periods. Compliance with discharge measures for AMI (i.e., aspirin, beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI], or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB] use) and for HF (i.e., discharge instructions, left ventricular systolic function [LVSF] evaluation, and ACEI/ARB use) was assessed. The delivery of discharge instructions showed significant improvement from the preintervention period to the postintervention period (37.2% to 93.0%; P < .001). Compliance with prescription of ACEI or ARB also improved significantly for HF (80.7% to 96.4%; P < .001) and AMI (88.1% to 100%; P = .014) patients. Compliance with the remaining measures was higher before intervention, and, thus, the modest improvement in the postintervention period was not statistically significant (AMI patients: aspirin, 97.5% to 98.8%; P = .43; and beta-blocker, 97.9% to 98.7%; P = .78; HF patients: LVSF, 99.3% to 99.1%; P = .78). Implementation of a CDSS with computerized electronic prompts improved compliance with selected cardiac-care quality measures. The design of quality-improvement decision-support tools should incorporate educational missions in their message and design.", 
    "48": "Previous work has demonstrated post-retrieval impairment in associative learning paradigms, including those mediated by drugs of abuse, using nonspecific beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) antagonists. Remarkably little is known about the role of the specific beta-AR subtypes, or other adrenergic receptors, in these effects. The current study examined the effects of beta(1) and beta(2), as well as alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonism following retrieval of a cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP). We found that rats administered the beta(2) antagonist ICI 118,551 (8 mg/kg intraperitoneal [IP]) or the alpha(1) antagonist prazosin (1 mg/kg IP) following a drug-free test for CPP showed attenuated preference during a subsequent test, while the beta(1) antagonist betaxolol (5 or 10 mg/kg IP) and a lower dose of prazosin (0.3 mg/kg IP) had no effect. Furthermore, post-test microinfusion of ICI 118,551 (6 nmol/side) or prazosin (0.5 nmol/side) into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) also impaired a subsequent preference. Systemic or intra-BLA ICI 118,551 or prazosin administered to rats in their home cages, in the absence of a preference test, had no effect on CPP 24 h later. ICI 118,551 also attenuated the FOS response in the BLA induced by the CPP test. These results are the first to demonstrate a role for alpha(1)- and beta(2)-specific adrenergic mechanisms in post-retrieval memory processes. These systemic and site-specific injections, as well as the FOS immunohistochemical analyses, implicate the importance of specific noradrenergic signaling mechanisms within the BLA in post-retrieval plasticity.", 
    "49": "The purpose of this study was to examine how resting electrocardiographic (ECG) and other clinical variables, which can be included in a routine clinical examination, predict walking ability in older women. Three hundred and twenty women (63-75 years) without overt cardiac diseases and apparent mobility limitations were studied. Measurements performed were clinical examination (standard 12-lead resting ECG, assessment of physical activity level, presence of chronic diseases, use of beta-blockers, body mass index (BMI), ability to squat, resting blood pressure) and six-minute walking test. Participants walked 533+/-75 m in the six-minute walking test. The best electrocardiographic predictors of long walking distance were high TV(5) and TII, but their explanation rates were small (4.5% and 3.8%, respectively). In hypertensive participants (systolic blood pressure=SBP> or =160 mmHg), the respective values were 9.3% and 5.8%. The best predictors of long walking distance were ability to squat without limitations and low BMI (15.5% and 13.6%, respectively). Altogether the studied variables explained 36% of the variation in walking distance. The data gathered in clinical examination give useful information for the assessment of walking ability in relatively healthy older women. Resting ECG does not give clinically significant additional information for the assessment in subjects without overt cardiac disease.", 
    "50": "Branchial artery vasoreactivity and nerve density were measured in teleosts of different phylogenetic relatedness from cold (-1.86 degrees to +1 degrees C) and temperate ( approximately 13 degrees C) environments. Polar Notothenia coriiceps and temperate Paranotothenia angustata are closely related Southern Hemisphere nototheniids, and polar Boreogadus saida and temperate Myoxocephalus scorpius are Northern Hemisphere species that are phylogenetically distant from each other and the nototheniids. Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss was used as a temperate comparison of different activity patterns. Cumulative dose-response curves for efferent branchial arteries (EBAs) revealed a lack of alpha-adrenergic (noradrenaline [NOR]) vasoactivity in M. scorpius and a lack of cholinergic (carbachol [CARB]) vasoactivity in B. saida, while responses in N. coriiceps and P. angustata were irregular. Oncorhynchus mykiss vessels were responsive to both constrictors, suggesting either receptor absence or spatial heterogeneity among species. The sensitivity (pEC(50)) of NOR or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) vasoconstriction showed little interspecific variation, while maximal tension varied among species for NOR but not 5-HT. Acute cooling did not affect agonist-independent vascular contraction induced by KCl or in response to NOR or 5-HT. The CARB sensitivity of EBAs increased with cooling in P. angustata alone. Each species possessed a unique pattern of innervation on both branchial arteries, distal and proximal to their respective aortas, that partially differentiated between nototheniids and nonnototheniids. We conclude there is little evidence for cold adaptation of branchial artery contractility, and mechanisms of vascular control likely reflect phylogeny rather than thermal history.",

The chromatographic conditions were 10% - 30% (v/v) ethanol-hexane containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid or triethylamine as the mobile phase at the flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with the detection at 254 nm. The lower enantioselectivities and the shorter retention times on amylose derived CSPs (Chiralpak AD and Chiralpak IA) using the mobile phase with acid additive than those with base additive were shown, except for slightly longer retention times of metoprolol and propranolol on Chiralpak AD. The greater enantioselectivities and the shorter retention times on cellulose derived CSPs (Chiralcel OD and Chiralpak IB) using the mobile phase with acid additive than those with base additive were shown, especially, Chiralcel OD showed dramatically enhanced enantioselectivites using the mobile phase with acidic additive. Also, it was shown that the greater enantiomer separation of beta-blockers on Chiralcel OD was achieved using the mobile phases with the higher concentration acid additive.",

The new method is based on the use of an internal standard (compound similar in nature and pKa value to the analyte), and offers several benefits, since it has all the advantages of capillary electrophoresis. In addition, it is very fast, because the exact measure of the pH of the separation electrolytes is not needed, and only a few electrophoretic runs are required to perform a pKa determination. The acidity constants of some monoprotic weak acids and bases were determined by this fast method, yielding a very good agreement with literature values.",

Primary end point was all-cause mortality or heart transplantation. Altogether 456 patients were studied; 27 (5.9%) were submitted to heart transplantation and 202 (44.3%) died. Chagas etiology was present in 68 (14.9%) patients; they had lower body mass index (24.1+/-4.1 versus 26.3+/-5.1, P=0.001), smaller end-diastolic left ventricle diameter (6.7+/-1.0 mm versus 7.0+/-0.9 mm, P=0.001), smaller proportion of beta-blocker therapy (35.8% versus 68%, P<0.001), and higher proportion of spironolactone therapy (74.6% versus 57.8%, P=0.003). Twenty-four (35.8%) patients with Chagas disease were under beta-blocker therapy and had lower serum sodium (136.6+/-3.1 versus 138.4+/-3.1 mEqs, P=0.05) and lower body mass index (22.5+/-3.3 versus 24.9+/-4.3, P=0.03) compared with those who received beta-blockers.

    "63": "Bacterial sensing of environmental signals plays a key role in regulating virulence and mediating bacterium-host interactions. The sensing of the neuroendocrine stress hormones epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) plays an important role in modulating bacterial virulence. We used MudJ transposon mutagenesis to globally screen for genes regulated by neuroendocrine stress hormones in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. We identified eight hormone-regulated genes, including yhaK, iroC, nrdF, accC, yedP, STM3081, and the virulence-related genes virK and mig14. The mammalian alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine reversed the hormone-mediated effects on yhaK, virK, and mig14 but did not affect the other genes. The beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol had no activity in these assays. The virK and mig14 genes are involved in antimicrobial peptide resistance, and phenotypic screens revealed that exposure to neuroendocrine hormones increased the sensitivity of S. Typhimurium to the antimicrobial peptide LL-37. A virK mutant and a virK mig14 double mutant also displayed increased sensitivity to LL-37. In contrast to enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), we have found no role for the two-component systems QseBC and QseEF in the adrenergic regulation of any of the identified genes. Furthermore, hormone-regulated gene expression could not be blocked by the QseC inhibitor LED209, suggesting that sensing of hormones is mediated through alternative signaling pathways in S. Typhimurium. This study has identified a role for host-derived neuroendocrine stress hormones in downregulating S. Typhimurium virulence gene expression to the benefit of the host, thus providing further insights into the field of host-pathogen communication.", 
    "64": "Postsystolic shortening (PSS), a positive myocardial velocity after aortic valve closure as assessed by Doppler tissue imaging, is a common pathologic finding in patients with myocardial disease. Beta-blocker therapy can improve global and regional myocardial function. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the beta-blocker carvedilol might reduce the incidence and magnitude of PSS in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Before and 2 months after carvedilol therapy, 19 patients (7 men, 12 women; mean age 59 +/- 13 years) underwent conventional echocardiographic assessment and Doppler tissue imaging. Time-velocity curves were constructed at the 12 basal and mid myocardial segments of the left ventricular (LV) walls. PSS was defined if positive myocardial velocity after aortic valve closure was greater than the ejection peak. The number of segments showing PSS was assessed before and after carvedilol therapy. Carvedilol decreased LV end-diastolic dimension (from 66 +/- 5 to 62 +/- 7 mm, p <0.01), increased the LV ejection fraction (from 28 +/- 9% to 36 +/- 8%, p <0.01), and increased early diastolic mitral annular velocity (Ea) (from 5.0 +/- 1.6 to 5.5 +/- 1.7 cm/ms, p <0.01). This was associated with significant reductions in the number of segments showing PSS (from 2.8 +/- 3.0 to 0.8 +/- 1.4, p <0.01). There was a correlation between changes in the number of segments showing PSS and changes in Ea (r = -0.56, p = 0.01). In conclusion, PSS may reflect the severity of LV diastolic function during pharmacologic reverse remodeling in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms by which carvedilol improves cardiac function and symptoms in these patients.", 
    "65": "The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) showed that the angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan 80 mg was not inferior to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril 10 mg, and the combination no more effective than ramipril alone, in decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease or high-risk diabetes. Although therapy targeting angiotensin II is known to decrease left ventricular (LV) mass and volume, the relative influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker, and their combination, on the heart remains unclear in this population. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 287 patients enrolled in ONTARGET, across 8 centers in 6 countries, at randomization and after 2-year treatment (90, 100, and 97 patients in the ramipril, telmisartan, and combination therapy groups, respectively). Baseline patient characteristics showed higher frequencies of coronary artery disease, Asian ethnicity, and use of statins and beta blockers than the main ONTARGET trial. LV mass decreased in all groups (p <0.0001 for each), but there were no significant differences in change in LV mass or volume among groups, except that LV mass index decreased more on combination versus telmisartan (p = 0.04). Key determinants of LV mass decrease were a history of hypertension (p = 0.03), baseline mass (p <0.0001), and decrease in systolic blood pressure (p <0.0001). The best magnetic resonance imaging predictor of composite events was end-systolic volume (p <0.0001). In conclusion, telmisartan and ramipril had similar effects on LV mass and volume, and combination therapy was not more effective, in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. These results are consistent with the major outcome findings of the main ONTARGET study.", 
    "66": "The antihypertensive drug atenolol was found to induce chromosome loss, detected as micronuclei in the peripheral lymphocytes of treated patients. The fundamental question which chromosomes the micronuclei were derived from remains to be answered. Analysis of structural chromosomal aberrations (CAs) and expression of fragile sites (FS) were pursued in this study. They revealed a significantly higher incidence of chromosomal aberrations (chromatid and chromosome breaks) in patients compared with controls, where 10 FS emerged as specific. Also, the band 17q12-21, where known fragile sites have not been reported, was only expressed in atenolol-treated patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using chromosome-specific probes revealed the preferential involvement of chromosomes 7, 11, 17 and X in the micronuclei (MN) of patients. The results also suggest a correlation between chromosomal fragility and content of MN, and support the findings for a linkage between hypertension and a locus on chromosome 17.", 
    "67": "The interaction of calf thymus deoxyribonucleic acid (ct-DNA) with betaxolol (BET) in aqueous buffer solution (pH 7.40) has been investigated using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), ultraviolet absorption (UV), fluorescence spectroscopy (FS) and circular dichroism (CD). Thermodynamic parameters, i.e., equilibrium constants, standard changes of enthalpy (DeltaH degrees ), Gibbs free energy (DeltaG degrees) and entropy (DeltaS degrees ), for the binding process of the drug to the bio-macromolecules have been derived from the calorimetric data. Analysis of the thermodynamic data indicates that there are two classes of binding sites on the DNA molecules being able to coordinate with BET molecules. One class of binding takes place at the sites formed by base pairs, which is synergistically driven by enthalpy and entropy, while the other one takes place on phosphate groups and shown as an entropy driven process. The thermodynamic behavior of the DNA-drug supramolecular system has been discussed in the light of the important weak interactions, hydrophobic force, hydrogen bond and electrostatic force, according to the UV, FS and CD spectra.",

    "69": "In this study, an experimental rat ligated heart model was used to observe the effect of treatment with carvedilol, metoprolol and metoprolol plus a highly selective alpha(1)-adrenergic blocking agent, bunazosin, after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Compared with an untreated MI group, all drug-treated groups demonstrated attenuation of inflammatory mediators, activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and increased levels of mRNA and active protein for the collagenases matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-8 and MMP-13 in the non-infarct zone of the ventricle, as well as inhibition of the increase of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Supplementation of metoprolol with bunazosin did not add greatly to the effects of metoprolol alone. Of the three drug treatments, carvedilol showed a uniquely potent antioxidant activity that may strengthen its capacity to inhibit oxidative stress, the release of inflammatory mediators and activation of NF-kappaB. This study may help provide a mechanistic explanation for the greater benefits shown by carvedilol compared with metoprolol in treating heart failure.", 
    "70": "Beta-1-adrenoreceptor antagonists, Ca(2+) antagonists, and benzodiazepines negatively affect platelet aggregation in vitro. Few data exists on whether platelet function in vivo is relevantly influenced by exposure to any these substances. We analysed in three cohorts of 100 patients each treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), autologous HSCT, and intensive chemotherapy, respectively, whether treatment with these drugs was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Cumulative incidences of bleeding in the three cohorts were 47 +/- 5% after allogeneic transplants, 30 +/- 5% after autologous transplant, and 46 +/- 5% after chemotherapy (p = 0.008). Exposure to beta-blockers (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, p = 0.32), Ca(2+) antagonists (HR 0.90, p = 0.73), and benzodiazepines (HR 1.18, p = 0.29) did not significantly increase the risk of bleeding in any cohort. Instead, bleeding risk was determined by platelet count, presence of inflammation, azotemia, presence of graft-versus-host disease and treatment with low-molecular weight heparin. After correcting for these factors, no differences in bleeding risk were seen between the three cohorts. In conclusion, therapy with Beta-1-adrenoreceptor antagonists, Ca(2+) antagonists, and benzodiazepines did not appear to significantly increase the risk for hemorrhagic complications in patients with iatrogenic severe thrombocytopenia.", 
    "71": "The antipsychotic properties of dilept, a new drug representing substituted dipeptide based on a beta-rotational structure of the main metabolite of endogenous neuroleptic NT8-13, have been studied using the test for prestimulus inhibition (PSI) of the acoustic startle reflex in rats. It is established that dilept eliminates the PSI deficiency caused by the introduction of a noncompetitive NMDA receptor blocker ketamine, which is evidence for pronounced neuroleptic properties of the drug. Effective doses of dilept for intraperitoneal administration were 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4 mg/kg, the maximum antipsychotic effect being produced at 1.6 mg/kg. Dilept also prevented the PSI deficiency upon peroral administration in rats. In this case, the drug administration per os in the form of a tabletization mixture with poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) and lactose was more effective compared to a mixture of the parent substance with Tween-80, which can be explained by the favorable effect of additives on the bioavailability of dilept. The maximum antipsychotic effect of dilept upon oral administration was observed for a dose of 16 mg/kg. The ability of dilept to eliminate the PSI deficiency in the acoustic startle reflex test on the model of glutamate-negative psychosis in rats can be considered as a prognostic sign for the drug efficiency with respect to the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia and autism manifestations. The antidopamine activity of dilept allows us also to predict the drug efficiency with respect to the positive manifestations of schizophrenia.",

    "76": "The present study was designed to characterize the neurogenic contraction of rat radial artery. Electrical field stimulation (EFS) evoked frequency-dependent contraction that was abolished by tetrodotoxin (neuronal Na(+) channel blocker), guanethidine (sympathetic neuron blocker), or phentolamine (alpha-adrenoceptor blocker). The alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin inhibited endothelium-independent contractions to EFS, noradrenaline (NA), and the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. Rauwolscine, an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, augmented nerve-mediated contractions and reduced sensitivity to NA and the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist BHT-920. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol diminished EFS-elicited contractions, while sensitivity to NA was enhanced by propranolol. Relaxations evoked by isoproterenol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, were abolished by propranolol. N(G)-Nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, increased both nerve-mediated and NA-induced responses in endothelium-intact, but not in endothelium-denuded arteries. Moreover, endothelium-dependent responses to BHT-920 and isoproterenol were modified by L-NOARG. Tetraethylammonium (TEA) or 4-aminopyridine, the Ca2+-activated (K(Ca)) or voltage-dependent K+ (K(V)) channel blockers, respectively, enhanced the neurogenic contractions observed. TEA but not 4-aminopyridine increased NA-induced contractions. The ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP))-channel blocker glibenclamide failed to modify adrenergic contractions. Blockade of capsaicin-sensitive primary afferents increased EFS-induced contractions. In conclusion, adrenergic contractions are predominantly mediated by muscular alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, while endothelial alpha(2)- and beta-adrenoceptors play a minor role. Presynaptic alpha(2)- and beta-adrenoceptors cannot be precluded. Noradrenergic neurotransmission in rat radial artery seems to be modulated by both stimulation of endothelial NO, K(Ca), and K(V) channels and sensory C-fiber activation.",

In intact tissue methods, Kt:b followed the order choroid-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) > trabecular meshwork > retina > sclera approximately optic nerve; propranolol > betaxolol > pindolol approximately timolol approximately metoprolol > sotalol approximately atenolol approximately nadolol. Intact tissue, wet weight log (Kt:b) correlated positively with log D for all tissues (R(2) of 0.7-0.9). Log (melanin binding capacity) correlated positively with choroid-RPE log (Kt:b) (R(2) of 0.5). With an increase in concentration, Kt:b decreased in trabecular meshwork for all beta-blockers and for some lipophilic beta-blockers in choroid-RPE and sclera. With an increase in drug lipophilicity, in vivo tissue distribution increased in choroid-RPE, iris-ciliary body, sclera, and cornea but exhibited a declining trend in retina, vitreous, and lens. In vitro bovine intact tissue, wet weight Kt:b correlated positively with rat in vivo tissue/vitreous humor distribution for sclera, choroid-RPE, and retina (R(2) of 0.985-0.993). In vitro tissue partition coefficients might be useful in predicting in vivo drug distribution after trans-scleral delivery.

The method involves the use of easily available inexpensive laboratory reagents. The separation was achieved on an Inertsil ODS 3V (25cmx4.6mm) 5microm column with isocratic flow. The mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0mLmin(-1), consisted of 0.1M potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer and acetonitrile (70:30, v/v). The UV detection was carried out at 228nm. A linear response was observed over the concentration range 2.5-50microgmL(-1) of bisoprolol fumarate and the concentration range 6.25-125microgmL(-1) of hydrochlorothiazide. Limit of detection and limit of quantitation for bisoprolol fumarate were 0.01 and 0.03microgmL(-1), respectively and for hydrochlorothiazide were 0.01 and 0.05microgmL(-1), respectively. The method was successfully validated in accordance to ICH guidelines acceptance criteria for specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, robustness, ruggedness and system suitability. Individual drugs (bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide), their combinations and the tablets were exposed to thermal, photolytic, hydrolytic and oxidative stress conditions. The resultant stressed samples were analyzed by the proposed method. The method gave high resolution among the degradation products and the analytes. The peak purity of analyte peaks in the stressed samples was confirmed by photodiode array detector. The method was used for accelerated stability study on marketed and in-house formulations. The analysis concluded that the method was selective for simultaneous estimation of bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide and was stability-indicating.",

During apnea, programmed pacing was performed with S1-S2 = 5 to 10 ms earlier than the atrial refractory period. Neural activity was monitored from the ganglionated plexi (GP) adjacent to the right pulmonary veins. Protocol 2 (n = 16): Electrical stimulation identified the GP at the right pulmonary artery (RPA). Programmed pacing was again instituted, below atrial refractory period, during 2 min of apnea. After radiofrequency ablation of the RPA GP, continuous programmed pacing was again repeated during 2 min of apnea. In 5 dogs, blood gases were determined at baseline and at 2 min of apnea.",

    "89": "Multiple clinical trials support the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with heart failure (HF). Unfortunately, several complicating issues have arisen from the universal use of ICDs in HF patients. An estimated 20% to 35% of HF patients who receive an ICD for primary prevention will experience an appropriate shock within 1 to 3 years of implant, and one-third of patients will experience an inappropriate shock. An ICD shock is associated with a 2- to 5-fold increase in mortality, with the most common cause being progressive HF. The median time from initial ICD shock to death ranges from 168 to 294 days depending on HF etiology and the appropriateness of the ICD therapy. Despite this prognosis, current guidelines do not provide a clear stepwise approach to managing these high-risk patients. An ICD shock increases HF event risk and should trigger a thorough evaluation to determine the etiology of the shock and guide subsequent therapeutic interventions. Several combinations of pharmacologic and device-based interventions such as adding amiodarone to baseline beta-blocker therapy, adjusting ICD sensitivity, and employing antitachycardia pacing may reduce future appropriate and inappropriate shocks. Aggressive HF surveillance and management is required after an ICD shock, as the risk of sudden cardiac death is transformed to an increased HF event risk.", 
    "90": "Propranolol, a beta adrenergic blocker prevents the blood alcohol (BAL) cycle in rats fed ethanol intragastrically at a constant rate by preventing the cyclic changes in the metabolic rate caused by fluctuating levels of norepinephrine released into the blood. The change in the rate of metabolism changes the rate of alcohol elimination in the blood which causes the BAL to cycle. Microarray analysis of the livers from the rats fed ethanol and propranolol showed similar changes in clusters of functionally related gene expressions. The controls and the trough of the cycle differed dramatically from the cluster pattern seen in the rats at the peaks of the blood alcohol cycle. The changes in gene expression induced by ethanol were similar when propranolol was fed without ethanol especially with the changes in the kinases and phosphatases, Toll-like receptor signaling and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction were also changed. The changes in gene expression caused by ethanol and propranolol feeding are alike probably because both drugs induce beta adrenergic receptor desensitization.",

Cells were grown either within flexible, circular collagen gels or as monolayer on top of respective 1-mum thin silicone membranes. Membrane and cells were bulged outwards by air pressure. This biaxial strain distribution is rather similar the beating, blood-filled heart. The setup allowed presetting the mechanical residual stress level externally by adjusting the centre deflection, thus, mimicking hypertension in vitro. Tension was measured as oscillating differential pressure change between chamber and environment. A 0.5-mm thick collagen-cardiac myocyte tissue construct induced after 2 days of culturing (initial cell density 2 x 10(4) cells/ml), a mechanical tension of 1.62 +/- 0.17 microN/mm(2). Mechanical load is an important growth regulator in the developing heart, and the orientation and alignment of cardiomyocytes is stress sensitive. Therefore, it was necessary to develop the CellDrum technology with its biaxial stress-strain distribution and defined mechanical boundary conditions. Cells were exposed to strain in two directions, radially and circumferentially, which is similar to biaxial loading in real heart tissues. Thus, from a biomechanical point of view, the system is preferable to previous setups based on uniaxial stretching.", 
    "96": "Both mRNA and protein levels of the carboxylesterase (CES) isozymes, hCE1 and hCE2, in Caco-2 cells increase in a time-dependent manner, but hCE1 levels are always higher than those of hCE2. In human small intestine, however, the picture is reversed, with hCE2 being the predominant isozyme. Drugs hydrolyzed by hCE1 but not by hCE2 can be hydrolyzed in Caco-2 cells, but they are barely hydrolyzed in human small intestine. The results in Caco-2 cells can be misleading as a predictor of what will happen in human small intestine. In the present study, we proposed a novel method for predicting the absorption of prodrugs in the absence of CES-mediated hydrolysis in Caco-2 cells. The specific inhibition against CES was achieved using bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (BNPP). The optimal concentration of BNPP was determined at 200 microM by measuring the transport and hydrolysis of O-butyryl-propranolol (butyryl-PL) as a probe. BNPP concentrations of more than 200 microM inhibited 86% of hydrolysis of butyryl-PL, resulting in an increase in its apparent permeability. Treatment with 200 microM BNPP did not affect paracellular transport, passive diffusion, or carrier-mediated transport. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation system was tested for ethyl fexofenadine (ethyl-FXD), which is a superior substrate for hCE1 but a poor one for hCE2. CES-mediated hydrolysis of ethyl-FXD was 94% inhibited by 200 microM BNPP, and ethyl-FXD was passively transported as an intact prodrug. From the above observations, the novel evaluation system is effective for the prediction of human intestinal absorption of ester-type prodrugs.",

HG activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p42/p44 and protein kinase C (PKC) signals, whereas BK only activated MAPK. Tubular expression of these mediators and tissue kallikrein 1 (KLK1) was confirmed in human diabetic kidney biopsies. Inhibition of MAPK p42/p44 by PD98059 partially reduced HG and BK induction of IL-6, CCL-2 and TGF-beta, whereas inhibition of PKC by staurosporine partially reduced HG- but not BK-induced overexpression of these cytokines and that of VEGF. Staurosporine and PD98059 synergistically reduced the effect of HG on IL-6, CCL-2 and TGF-beta expression. The B(2)KR blocker, icatibant, downregulated BK- and HG-induced MAPK p42/p44 but not HG-induced PKC activation and partially reduced both HG- and BK-induced IL-6, CCL-2 and TGF-beta secretion. HG stimulated expression of KLK1 and low-molecular-weight kininogen (LMWK) and its downstream effects were attenuated by aprotinin (tissue kallikrein inhibitor). The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, rosiglitazone, attenuated HG-induced PKC but not HG- or BK- induced MAPK p42/44 activation and reduced HG-stimulated VEGF, along with IL-6, CCL-2 and TGF-beta secretion.

In urethane-anesthetized rats, NPFF and related peptides (5-40 nmol, i.t.) produced significant pressor and tachycardic responses at the spinal cord level. These effects were dose-dependent and similar with respect to time-course for the three peptides. Furthermore, i.t. injection of RF9 (20 nmol), a selective NPFF antagonist, significantly antagonized the cardiovascular responses to 20 nmol NPFF and related peptides (i.t.). Moreover, pretreatment of the rats with alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (1mg/kg, i.v.) significantly reduced the pressor effects of NPFF. Nevertheless, pretreatment with muscarinic receptor and adrenoceptor antagonists (i.v.) could block the tachycardic effects induced by NPFF.

In the presence of NE, sudden fast rhythms were initiated by large Vos that entered a more negative oscillatory zone and initiated a large ThVos. Recovery from NE exposure involved the converse changes. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol had similar actions. Increasing calcium load by decreasing high [K+]o, by fast drive or by recovery in Tyrode solution led to growth of Vos and ThVos which abruptly fused when a fast sudden rhythm was induced. Low [Ca2+]o antagonized the adrenergic actions. Cesium (a blocker of If) induced spontaneous discharge in quiescent SAN through ThVos.

Good correlations were observed between strain measurements by 3D-STI and those by sonomicrometry (LS: r=0.89, P<0.001; RS: r=0.84, P<0.001; CS: r=0.90, P<0.001). In each segmental study, significant correlations of the 3 strain components were observed (LS: r=0.65 to 0.68, P<0.001; RS: r=0.59 to 0.70, P<0.001; CS: r=0.71 to 0.78, P<0.001).", 
    "129": "The newly developed 3D-STI technique can estimate LV regional circumferential, longitudinal, and radial strain components with reasonable correlation to sonomicrometry data. This methodology could be applied clinically to assess alteration of myocardial function by accurately measuring strain in basal, mid, and apical LV segments, even during pharmacological and ischemic interventions. Therefore, 3D-STI appears to be a reliable tool to assess LV regional wall function.",

Use of HF medication and antidepressants (divided into tricyclic antidepressants [TCA] and SSRI) was determined by prescription claims. Risk of overall and cardiovascular death associated with antidepressants, HF medication, and coadministration of these 2 drug classes was estimated by Cox proportional hazard analyses. Propensity adjusted models were performed as sensitivity analysis. During the study period, there were 53 988 deaths, of which 83.0% were due to cardiovascular causes (median follow-up, 1.9 years; 5, 95% fractiles, 0.04 to 7.06 years). Use of beta-blockers was associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.79). Antidepressants were prescribed to 19 411 patients, and both TCA and SSRI were associated with increased risk of overall and cardiovascular death (TCA: HR, 1.33; CI, 1.26 to 1.40; and HR, 1.25; CI, 1.17 to 1.32; SSRI: HR, 1.37; CI, 1.34 to 1.40; and HR, 1.34; CI, 1.30 to 1.38, respectively).

Intervention included randomization to 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide or 100 mg of atenolol monotherapy followed by their combination. Fasting glucose, insulin, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and uric acid levels were measured at baseline and after monotherapy and combination therapy. Outcomes included new occurrence of and predictors for new cases of glucose > or =100 mg/dL (impaired fasting glucose), triglyceride > or =150 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein < or =40 mg/dL for men or < or =50 mg/dL for women, or new-onset diabetes mellitus according to the presence or absence of abdominal obesity. Abdominal obesity was present in 167 (58%) of 395 patients. Regardless of strategy, in those with abdominal obesity, 20% had impaired fasting glucose at baseline compared with 40% at the end of study (P<0.0001). Proportion with triglycerides > or =150 mg/dL increased from 33% at baseline to 46% at the end of study (P<0.01). New-onset diabetes mellitus occurred in 13 patients (6%) with and in 4 patients (2%) without abdominal obesity. Baseline levels of glucose, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein predicted adverse outcomes, and predictors for new-onset diabetes mellitus after monotherapy in those with abdominal obesity included hydrochlorothiazide strategy (odds ratio: 46.91 [95% CI: 2.55 to 862.40]), female sex (odds ratio: 31.37 [95% CI: 2.10 to 468.99]), and uric acid (odds ratio: 3.19 [95% CI: 1.35 to 7.52]).

    "139": "G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane signaling molecules, with a majority of them performing important physiological roles. beta(2)-Adrenergic receptor (beta(2)-AR) is a well-studied GPCRs that mediates natural responses to the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. Analysis of the ligand-binding region of beta(2)-AR using the recently solved high-resolution crystal structures revealed a number of highly conserved amino acids that might be involved in ligand binding. However, detailed structure-function studies on some of these residues have not been performed, and their role in ligand binding remains to be elucidated. In this study, we have investigated the structural and functional role of a highly conserved residue valine 114, in hamster beta(2)-AR by site-directed mutagenesis. We replaced V114 in hamster beta(2)-AR with a number of amino acid residues carrying different functional groups. In addition to the complementary substitutions V114I and V114L, the V114C and V114E mutants also showed significant ligand binding and agonist dependent G-protein activation. However, the V114G, V114T, V114S, and V114W mutants failed to bind ligand in a specific manner. Molecular modeling studies were conducted to interpret these results in structural terms. We propose that the replacement of V114 influences not only the interaction of the ethanolamine side-chains but also the aryl-ring of the ligands tested. Results from this study show that the size and orientation of the hydrophobic residue at position V114 in beta(2)-AR affect binding of both agonists and antagonists, but it does not influence the receptor expression or folding.", 
    "140": "AIMS: Genetic determinants of variability in response to beta-blockers are poorly characterized. We defined changes in mRNA expression after a beta-blocker to identify novel genes that could affect response and correlated these with inhibition of exercise-induced tachycardia, a measure of beta-blocker sensitivity. METHODS: Nine subjects exercised before and after a single oral dose of 25mg atenolol and mRNA gene expression was measured using an Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array. The area under the heart rate-exercise intensity curve (AUC) was calculated for each subject; the difference between post- and pre-atenolol AUCs (Delta AUC), a measure of beta-blocker response, was correlated with the fold-change in mRNA expression of the genes that changed more than 1.3-fold. RESULTS: Fifty genes showed more than 1.3-fold increase in expression; 9 of these reached statistical significance (P < 0.05). Thirty-six genes had more than 1.3-fold decrease in expression after atenolol; 6 of these reached statistical significance (P < 0.05). Change in mRNA expression of FGFBP2 and Probeset ID 8118979 was significantly correlated with atenolol response (P = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSION: The expression of several genes not previously identified as part of the adrenergic signaling pathway changed in response to a single oral dose of atenolol. Variation in these genes could contribute to unexplained differences in response to beta-blockers.",

However, the subtype of I(2)R for agmatine-induced blood glucose lowering effect remains obscure. In the present study, agmatine treatment increased beta-endorphin secretion and this effect was blocked by I(2)R antagonist (BU224) in the isolated adrenal medulla. We further used amiloride, an established blocker of I(2A)R, to identify the subtype of I(2)R in adrenal gland. Results showed that agmatine-induced beta-endorphin release from adrenal gland was blocked by 0.1muM amiloride indicating the mediation of I(2A)R. It was further confirmed that agmatine-induced plasma glucose decrement and plasma beta-endorphin increment in STZ rats were blocked by amiloride. However, amiloride failed to modify the action of guanidine, an agonist of I(2B)R, at the sufficient dose to block beta-endorphin secretion. Taken together, the increase of plasma beta-endorphin by agmatine in STZ rats through activation of imidazoline I(2)R was mainly induced by the I(2A) subtype located in adrenal gland. Thus, imidazoline I(2A) receptor in the adrenal gland might be applied as a new target for induction of opioid secretion.",

Timolol is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) in the liver. The aim of the present study was to characterize further the metabolism of timolol in vitro. Especially the effect of several drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the metabolism of timolol was evaluated. In human liver microsomes, four timolol metabolites were identified, in cryo-preserved hepatocytes nine. In both in vitro experiments, the hydroxy metabolite M1 was the main metabolite. The in vivo half-life predicted for timolol was 3.7 hr. in cryo-preserved hepatocytes, corresponding to the half-life of timolol in humans in vivo. Fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram and fluvoxamine inhibited the formation of M1 in microsomes with IC(50) values of 1.4, 2.0, 3.5, 21 and 20 microM, respectively. In human cryo-preserved hepatocytes, the IC(50) values for fluoxetine, paroxetine and fluvoxamine were 0.7, 0.5 and 5.9 microM, respectively. In conclusion, compounds known to be potent CYP2D6 inhibitors inhibited timolol metabolism in in vitro experiments. The present results strongly suggest that fluoxetine and paroxetine may significantly affect the metabolism of timolol also in vivo and may thus potentiate the adverse cardiovascular effects of topically administered timolol.",

The tumor was completely resected, but after the surgery the patient experienced prolonged hypertension and tachycardia. Postoperative MR imaging showed a small injury at the dorsocaudal medulla that was located at the caudal site of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS).

In the present study, we aimed to determine the cardiovascular effect of peripherally injected melittin and the involvement of the central cholinergic system on these effects in the normotensive conscious rats. For this reason, 250, 500 or 1000microg/kg doses of melittin were injected intraperitoneally to normotensive male Sprague Dawley rats. Melittin produced dose- and time-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). Both peripheral (5mg/kg; i.p.) and central (500microg; i.c.v.) pretreatment with indomethacin, nonselective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2, totally abolished cardiovascular effect of melittin. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) pretreatment with propranolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, completely abolished the tachycardic response to melittin. Also, the pressor effect of melittin was partially attenuated in these rats. In order to test the mediation of the central cholinergic system on the pressor and tachycardic effects of melittin, the rats were pretreated with atropine sulfate (10microg; i.c.v.), a cholinergic nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist, mecamylamine (50microg; i.c.v.), a cholinergic nonselective nicotinic receptor antagonist, methyllycaconitine (10microg; i.c.v.) or alpha-bungarotoxin (10microg; i.c.v.), selective antagonists of alpha7 subtype nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7nAChRs) 15min prior to melittin (500microg/kg; i.p.) injection. Pretreatment with mecamylamine, methyllycaconitine or alpha-bungarotoxin partially diminished the pressor and tachycardic response to melittin in the normotensive conscious rats whereas pretreatment with atropine sulfate had no effect. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that peripherally administered melittin exerts a clear pressor and tachycardic effect by activating COX pathway. The activation of central cholinergic nicotinic receptors, predominantly alpha7nAChRs, appears to be involved in the pressor and tachycardic effects of the drug.", 
    "171": "To examine the role of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin in regulation of renin release, we assayed exocytosis using whole-cell patch clamp of single juxtaglomerular cells in culture. The calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine A (CsA), significantly increased juxtaglomerular cell membrane capacitance, an index of cell surface area and an established measure of exocytosis in single-cell assays. This effect was mimicked by intracellular delivery of a calcineurin inhibitory peptide, the calcium chelator ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), or the calmodulin inhibitor W-13. Simultaneous exposure to EGTA and CsA had no additive effect. The protein kinase A (PKA) blocker RpcAMPs had no effect on the CsA-induced increase in membrane capacitance. Intra- and extracellular application of tacrolimus did not alter membrane capacitance. A calmodulin antagonist (calmidazolium) and CsA, but not tacrolimus, significantly stimulated renin release from cultured juxtaglomerular cells. Juxtaglomerular cells expressed the calcineurin isoforms A-beta and A-gamma but not A-alpha. Plasma renin concentrations (PRCs) were not different in wild-type, calcineurin A-alpha, or A-beta knockout mice but increased after CsA treatment of the A-alpha knockout, while renin mRNA was suppressed. We conclude that calcineurin and calcium/calmodulin suppress exocytosis of renin from juxtaglomerular cells independent of PKA.",
