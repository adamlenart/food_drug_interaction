    "0": "The effects of histamine were studied in atria obtained from untreated and reserpine-pretreated rats. At high doses, histamine caused a positive chronotropic response that was not antagonized by either promethazine or cimetidine. In the presence of propranolol or in atria from reserpine-pretreated rats histamine caused an atropine-sensitive negative chronotropic response. Large doses of histamine also caused a positive inotropic response in left atria that were antagonized by the beta adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Reserpine pretreatment abolished the inotropic response of histamine in the rat heart. The results indicate that in large doses histamine causes an indirect stimulation of beta adrenoceptors (right and left atrium) by releasing endogenous noradrenaline and of muscarinic receptors (right atrium) by releasing acetylcholine.", 
    "1": "The case of a 12 2/12-year-old boy with an HGH secreting eosinophilic adenoma is presented. The histologic investigation included conventional and ultrastructural techniques. The pre- and postoperative (1, 7, 11, and 20 months) hormonal controls are analyzed, indicating the persistence of HGH anteropituitary activity, even though surgical sectioning of the pituitary stalk was performed and the activities of thyroid, corticoadrenal and gonadotropin functions decreased. It is suggested that the hypothalamo-pituitary relationship may be maintained by extraportal venous circulations.", 
    "2": "1 Indoramin, an alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking agent has been given as a third agent to patients with severe hypertension treated with adequate doses of a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug and a thiazide diuretic. 2 A further fall in blood pressure followed the addition of indoramin. With 75 mg twice daily this was on average a fall of 12% of mean arterial pressure in the supine position, 16% standing an 17% after exercise. 3 The rise in blood pressure caused by isometric exercise was not altered by indoramin. 4 Indoramin slowed the heart rate. On 75 mg twice daily the reduction was 14% at rest and 19% after exercise. 5 Side effects of indoramin were sedation, sleep disturbance and vivid dreams.", 
    "3": "The tritiated muscarinic cholinergic antagonist quinuclidinyl benzilate, [3H]QNB, was used as a direct probe for the detection and characterization of muscarinic cholinergic receptors associated with the particulate fraction of isolated and purified rat gastric muscosal parietal cells. Specific binding is saturable (Bmax = 55 fmol/mg protein, KD = 0.78 nM), shows a single population of binding sites, and has appropriate pharmacological specificity. Nanomolar concentrations of muscarinic cholinergic antagonists, such as atropine and scopolamine, inhibit [3H]QNB binding by 50%, whereas micromolar concentrations are needed for agonists, such as acetylcholine, oxotremorine, and carbamylcholine. Binding is also stereoselective as shown by the more than 1,000-fold difference in inhibitory potencies of the stereoisomers of benzetimide. Noncholinergic agents, including pentagastrin, histamine, and the H2-receptor antagonists cimetidine and metiamide, have little or no effect on [3H]QNB binding at concentrations of 100 microM. These data support the existence of specific parietal cell muscarinic cholinergic receptors with which the secretagogue acetylcholine may directly interact to initiate gastric acid secretion.", 
    "4": "The effects of phentolamine alone or in combination with propranolol, atenolol and chlorisondamine were studied on the concentration and turnover of noradrenaline in the heart of light-dark (L:D = 12:12 h) synchronized rats. In order to detect possible circadian phase-dependent variations in the drug effects, the same experiments were performed in the light-period and dark-period, respectively. The parameters of the turnover were calculated from the exponential decline of i.v. injected 3H-(-)-noradrenaline. Phentolamine significantly decreased the noradrenaline concentration during L, but not during D. Reduction in 3H-noradrenaline accumulation by phentolamine was 42.3% during L and 22.2% during D. Phentolamine increased the turnover rate of cardiac noradrenaline more than 3-fold in either photoperiod. Chlorisondamine reversed all the effects of phentolamine studied. Propranolol, but not atenolol, antagonized the effects of phentolamine in a dose-dependent and stereospecific way, being more effective when applied during D. Thus, the chronopharmacological studies in unrestrained rats show a circadian phase-dependency of the effects of adrenoceptor blocking drugs. It is concluded that a central site of action is responsible for the antagonism by propranolol of the phentolamine-induced increase in the turnover of the cardiac noradrenaline in vivo.", 
    "5": "The effects of butropium on chronotropic and inotropic activity were investigated in 10 isolated atrial preparations which were suspended in a bath and perfused with arterial blood led from a carotid artery of heparinized support dog. Butropium injected into the cannulated sinus node artery in a dose range of 3 to 100 microgram produced a dose-dependent positive chronotropic and inotropic effect. At relatively higher doses above 30 microgram, slight and brief initial negative chronotropic and inotropic effect followed by a long-lasting positive effect was observed. The positive effect of butropium was markedly suppressed by propranolol or carteolol, but it was not affected by tetrodotoxin or desmethylimipramine. From these results, a large amount of butropium may induce positive chronotropic and inotropic effect through cholinergic blockade and in part stimulation of adrenergic beta-receptors.", 
    "6": "Six subjects performed a breathholding maneuver during facial cooling and immersed their foot in cold water, without drugs and after the intravenous administration of propranolol plus atropine (P + A). Cardiac interval (INT), mean interval for longest consecutive 5 cycles (L5INT/5); systolic time intervals including electromechanical systole (EMS), left ventricular ejection time (LVET), pre-ejection period (PEP), and PEP/LVET; and systolic (SP) and diastolic pressures (DP) were monitored during supine rest, during apnea with a plastic bag of ice water on the face, and from 16-30th and 46-60th sec of 1-min periods of foot immersion in 4 degrees C water. P+A administration induced reduction in INT, L5INT/5, and LVET and increase in PEP, PEP/LVET, and DP. INT, L5INT/5, PEP, SP, and DP increased during facial cooling without drugs. Only the increases in INT and L5INT/5 were abolished by P+A and thus considered to result from reflexes mediated by vagal or sympathetic outflow to the heart. Reductions in INT, L5INT/5, EMS, PEP, and PEP/LVET at 16-30 sec of foot immersion without drugs were not observed after P+A; 46-60 sec responses neared resting values, however, with and without P+A. These results indicate an initial cardiac reflex response to foot immersion may be overpowered by the ventricular afterload and the foot immersion may be overpowered by the ventricular afterload and the baroreceptor response due to the increased arterial pressure.", 
    "7": "Analysis of the protein composition of the thyroid colloid was performed in 28 patients operated on for hyperthyroidism. Fifteen of the patients were treated before the operation with carbimazole combined with thyroxine and 13 were treated with propranolol alone. Colloid was collected by micropuncture of single follicles in peroperative thyroid biopsies. The protein composition was analysed by microgel electrophoresis and densitometry, both in the colloid samples and in the supernatant fraction of homogenates of microbiopsies from the thyroid specimens. The analyses showed that, during treatment with carbimazole and thyroxine, the relative amount of the larger thyroglobulin aggregates (S-TG) was decreased compared with the relative amount observed in the colloid from normal thyroid tissue. In the hyperfunctioning thyroid tissue from the propranolol-treated patients the protein composition of the colloid was similar to that observed in normal tissue and the relative amount of the S-TG fractions was significantly higher than in the carbimazole- and thryoxine-treated group. It may be concluded that the increased release of thyroid hormones in hyperthyroidism is not combined with changes in the protein composition of the thryoid colloid. The decreased relative amount of the S-TG fractions in the thyroid colloid from patients treated with carbomazole and thryoxine was probably due to an insufficient capacity to iodinate thyroglobulin.", 
    "8": "The i.v. infusion or i.m. injection of 30 micrograms x kg-1 of glucagon into pigs aged 3--9 d, 24--30 d and 42--56 d was followed by a rise in the rate of oxygen consumption. In pigs aged 3--28 d pretreatment with 3 mg/kg of the beta-blocker propranolol prevented the rise in oxygen consumption after glucagon. Glucagon also caused a rise in plasma glucose which persisted for 60 min in 3--9 d old pigs. In older animals the glucose concentration first increased and then decreased below the control value after 45 min before rising again. The plasma concentration of free fatty acids did not change. In older pigs glucagon often induced shivering which occurred after the initial rise in metabolic rate. This effect which was accompanied by an increase in body temperature could be blocked with indomethacin, but the initial rise in metabolic rate, which was not associated with shivering, persisted.", 
    "9": "Nonachlazin in doses of 1 and 6 mg/kg provoked a rise in the arterial pressure of cats by 7--20 mm Hg. Administration of 1 mg nonaclazin into the IV ventricle induced a similar elevation of arterial pressure. Premedication with propranolol (1--3 mg/kg) did not prevent the pressor reaction. In half of the experiments, nonachlazin (6 mg/kg) produced an appearance of Meyer's waves and inhibition of the cardiac component of the barorecptor reflex that is not related to the potentiation of the sympathetic effects on the heart.", 
    "10": "Sotalol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, was administered to 12 hypertensive pregnant women. The concentration of the drug was assayed in samples of maternal plasma, amniotic fluid and mixed umbilical cord plasma at delivery and, in five mothers who elected to breast feed, in paired samples of maternal plasma and breast milk. Sotalol reduced blood pressure effectively at a mean daily dose of 433.1 +/- 54.1 mg but crossed the placental barrier. The mean maternal: fetal plasma concentration ratio was 1:1.05 and the mean amniotic fluid concentration was 7.0 +/- 2.7 microgram/ml. Delivery occurred at mean gestational age of 37.7 +/- 0.7 weeks; 12 infants were liveborn with a mean weight of 2.8 +/- 0.1 kg and eight of them had no significant neonatal problems. Of the other four, two died from severe congenital anomalies, one had perinatal asphyxia and one mild transient hypoglycaemia. High sotalol concentrations were found in breast milk (mean plasma: milk ratio was 1:5.4) raising the possibility of pharmacological effect in the newborn infant. The results suggest that sotalol adequately controls blood pressure in hypertension complicating pregnancy but because, unlike results from the pregnant ewe, it crosses the human placental barrier it offers no apparent advantages over other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "11": "Propranolol, a widely used beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drug extracted mostly by the liver, plays an important role in the various aspects of managment of hyperthyroidism. If the elimination of this drug is enhanced in thyrotoxic patients, one may consider necessary a modification of the dosage regimien when treating patients with this dysfunction. We examined the disposition profiles of propranolol in four patients with hyperthyroidism before and after their thyroid states became euthyroid and compared them to those of the seven control subjects. The data indicated that the values (mean +/- SEM) of half-life (3.34 +/- 0.81 hr) and systemic availability estimated (28.2 +/- 3.5%) in the hyperthyroid state were comparable to those in the euthyroid state (2.98 +/- 0.32 hr and 29.2 +/- 5.1%) and these in the control subjects (3.20 +/- 0.32 hr and 29.0 +/- 4.0%). Although our observations were obtained from a small number of subjects, there appears to be no considerable difference in propranolol elimination from the plasma of hyperthyroid and euthyroid states or healthy subjects, and therefore adjustment of the dosage regimen seems unwarranted. Adjustment of propranolol therapy based on individual plasma levels might be useful in thyrotoxic patients who respond inadequately until additional data relating more precisely to propranolol disposition becomes available.", 
    "12": "The tremor of a patient with debilitating essential tremor who could not take propranolol (because of severe asthma) was dramatically reduced when metoprolol tartrate was administered in standard doses. Metoprolol appears to be an excellent alternative antitremor drug to propranolol in such patients.", 
    "13": "Exercise-induced coronary arterial spasm is an infrequently recognized phemonemon whose mechanism and management are not well established. In two patients with reproducible exercise-induced S-T segment elevation and angina pectoris thallium-201 scintigraphy showed areas of reversible anteroapical hypoperfusion, and gated radionuclide ventriculography revealed anteroapical hypokinesia with a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction at peak exercise. During coronary arteriography supine exercise provoked occlusive spasm of the left anterior descending coronary artery, which at rest had only minimal plaques. Consequently, treadmill testing was performed with five different pharmacologically provoked interventions: direct vasodilatation (nitrates), alpha adrenergic blockade (phenmoxybenzamine), beta adrenergic blockade (propranolol), calcium flux blockade (verapamil), and prostaglandin inhibition (indomethacin). Exercise-induced coronary arterial spasm, manifested as S-T segment elevation and angina, was prevented by nitrates, but was not eliminated by short-term oral administration of an alpha or beta blocking agent, a calcium antagonist or a prostaglandin inhibitor. Further, beta adrenergic blockade appeared to be detrimental. Thus, this study demonstrates (1) that coronary arterial spasm may be the underlying mechanism of at least some cases of exertional angina associated with transient perfusion deficits and left ventricular dysfunction, and (2) that it may be prevented by oral nitrates.", 
    "14": "Three new iodobenzoyl derivatives of acebutolol, a cardioselective beta antagonist, were synthesized and labeled with iodine-125. The biodistributions of these labeled compounds were determined in normal rats and compared with that of thallium-201. Fifteen minutes following i.v. administration, the iodine-125-labeled meta- and para-iodobenzoyl acebutolols possessed the greatest ventricular uptake and the highest ventricle-to-blood and ventricle-to-lung ratios of the new agents. The corresonding values for thallium-201 were 2.5 to 3.0 times as high. The data in this study suggest that more lipophilic derivatives of the cardioselective beta antagonists will possess increased uptake and cardioselectivity, and thereby will compare more favorably with thallium-201 as myocardial imaging agents.", 
    "15": "Eighteen thyrotoxic patients receiving chronic treatment with propranolol (160 mg/day) were studied to determine the relationship between plasma propranolol concentration and drug effect. There was a considerable interindividual variability in both the plasma propranolol steady state concentration and the degree of beta-adrenergic blockade. The plasma propranolol steady state concentration correlated significantly with both beta-adrenergic blockage and weight change but not with the degree of subjective improvement. In a group of 40 patients, including 10 severely thyrotoxic patients, who had the dosage of propranolol titrated objectively preoperatively to bring about a greater than 25% reduction in exercise heart rate at the end of a dosage interval, no case of thyroid storm was encountered. Many patients, the younger and severely thyrotoxic in particular, require doses in excess of 160 mg/day to achieve this degree of beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "16": "The effects of caffeine (250 mg orally) on plasma free fatty acids (FFA), urinary catecholamines, and drug binding were studied in 16 normal subjects (six men, five women on oral contraceptives, and five women not on oral contraceptives). FFA doubled 1 hr after caffeine, and remained elevated for at least 4 hr. with elevation of each FFA. Urinary excretion of epinephrine and dopamine increased (p<0.05) in the first 2 hr. returning to baseline in the next 2 hr. Plasma binding of chlordiazepoxide, diaxepam, and propranolol was estimated in each of the hourly plasma samples after caffeine; there was no change in percent unbound drug in any of the samples. In vitro addition of oleic acid to plasma samples of four subjects caused a step-wise increase in percent unbound fraction of all three drugs whereas in vitro addition of caffeine did not further alter drug binding. In our study circulating plasma FFA and urinary catecholamine levels were elevated after caffeine ingestion. In spite of a rise in FFA, there was, however, no change in plasma binding of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, or propranolol.", 
    "17": "Blood and urine levels of atenolol were measured in 12 subjects--2 anephric and 10 with creatinine clearances ranging from 0 to 122 ml/min/1.73 m2. In a single-dose study subjects were given atenolol 100 mg by mouth, and blood and urine levels were measured during the subsequent 72 hr. In a repeated-dose study 10 subjects were given atenolol 100 mg for 20 days, and blood and urine levels were measured before and for 72 hr after the final dose on day 21. In the single-dose study the peak blood level occurred later and the 24-hr plasma concentrations increased as creatinine clearance decreased. The range in peak blood level was sixfold throughout this range of creatinine clearance. The blood atenolol half-life (t1/2) increased from about 6 hr to more than 100 hr with progressive renal failure and there was a corresponding decrease in elimination rate constant and increase in area under the curve. In the repeated-dose study there was good correlation between predose blood level of atenolol and both logarithm creatinine clearance and serum creatinine, and the elimination rate constant correlated with creatinine clearance and the logarithm of serum creatinine. In the single-dose study minimum heart rates were observed just after the peak atenolol level. Blood pressure response did not correlate closely with serum atenolol levels. Dosing recommendations are suggested for patients with renal failure to take account of the effects of renal function on atenolol kinetics.", 
    "18": "Acebutolol (ABL) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) were compared in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and low or normal peripheral renin activity. ABL reduced mean supine blood pressure from 151/97 to 140/87 mm Hg and HCT reduced the mean supine blood pressure from 153/98 to 143/92 mm Hg. ABL reduced heart rate from 73 to 67 beats/min; during HCT therapy it rose from 74 to 77 beats/min. Although the same proportion of patients achieved normal diastolic pressures with ABL (11/19) and with HCT (10/19), tension-time indices were lower during ABL than during HCT therapy. The average daily dose was 621 mg of ABL and 168 mg of HCT. Stimulated peripheral renin activity increased with HCT and was the same or lower with ABL. ABL did not induce adverse effects on serum potassium or uric acid. ABL was as effective in lowering blood pressure HCT but induced larger reductions in tension-time index as a result of the lowerered heart rate.", 
    "19": "The kinetics of distribution of di-propranolol (P) to various organs and tissues were studied in the rat after an i.v. dose of 2 mg/kg. The disposition of the drug can be adequately described by a two-compartment open model with a distribution half-life of 4.8 min, a terminal blood half-life of 63 min and an apparent volume of distribution beta of 8.5 liters/kg. Higher tissue concentrations were found to be present in heart, brain and kidney. Although the disappearance rate of P from abdominal aorta, muscles, adipose tissue and whole brain paralleled that of blood, the elimination rate constant for atria and kidney was significantly reduced suggesting a specific binding of P. After an i.v. dose of 5 mg/kg, P distributed rapidly to various brain areas following a vascularity pattern with higher concentrations in cortical areas of earlier times. An equilibrium between various brain areas was observed at 2 to 3 hr after dosing. There was a parallel decay of P concentrations in the blood and in cortical areas, whereas the elimination constants were significantly reduced for hypothealamic nuclei and the medulla (C1 and C2), suggesting again a specific binding. The data show that distribution, uptake and tissue binding of P in various peripheral organs and discrete brain areas is not a uniform process and they could give a partial explanation on the discrepancies observed clinically between the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. The data also suggest the possibility of specific P binding sites in heart, kidney and brain which could be of relevance for its mode of action.", 
    "20": "The effect of the beta-1-adrenoceptor blocking agent, atenolol, on serum levels of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) and reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) was studied in twelve hyperthyroid patients. While all patients improved symptomatically after treatment with atenolol 100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, there were no significant changes in the serum T3 or rT3 concentrations. The serum T4 level showed a small but statistically significant fall. These data do not support the hypothesis that the beneficial clinical effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in thyrotoxicosis are mediated by an action on the peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones.", 
    "21": "The characteristics of [3H]GABA transport were investigated in preparations greatly enriched in different classes of cerebellar cells. In contrast to observations in situ, isolated Purkinje cells readily accumulated [3H]GABA. In comparison with astrocytes, the Vmax of the high-affinity uptake process was sixfold higher (0.31 vs. 0.05 nmol/min/10(6) cells) and the apparent Kt twofold greater (2 vs. 1 microM). In contrast to these cell types, uptake was very low in granule cell-enriched preparations. cis-1,3-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid was a potent inhibitor of [3H]GABA uptake by the Purkinje cells and a weak blocker in astrocytes, while the converse was the case for beta-alanine. Diaminobutyric acid strongly inhibited uptake in both cell types. [3H]GABA transport was Na+ dependent in both cell classes. However, veratridine and ouabain selectively blocked [3H]GABA accumulation in the Purkinje cells, which were also more sensitive than the astrocytes to the glycolysis inhibitor, NaF. The results indicated, therefore, marked differences between Purkinje cells and astrocytes in the properties of both the [3H]GABA transport systems and the underlying metabolic processes.", 
    "22": "In dogs and rabbits anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium or urethane, respectively, the gastric mucosal blood flow was measured by the thermoelectrical method after intravenous administration of 3-(3, 4, 5-trimethoxybenzamido)piperidine(KU-54), an antiulcer drug. In the gastric corpus of rabbits, the maximal mucosal blood flow (11.9%) was attained within 1 min after KU-54(5 mg/kg i.v.) dosing and there was a prolonged increase during 8 min. Administration of KU-54 produced a transitory depression of the blood pressure by about 20%, and induced a beta-adrenergic-like action, presumably because both the blood pressure depression and the gastric mucosal blood flow increment were simultaneous in rabbits. This phenomenon was however, not abolished by pretreatment with propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, therefore KU-54 may not be a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Administration of gefarnate, a standard antiulcer drug, produced a slight increase in gastric mucosal blood flow and response to this drug was less than that seen with KU-54. Sulpiride, a standard antiulcer drug, two peaks on the gastric mucosal blood flow increment in rabbits and the pattern of blood flow increment differed from that seen with KU-54. The increment of gastric mucosal blood flow produced by KU-54 (5 mg/kg i.v.) was more successive in the gastric antrum than that in the gastric corpus. In fasting rabbits, the main period of gastric mucosal blood flow increment produced by KU-54 (5 mg/kg i.v.) was more successive than that seen in the non-fasting animals. In dogs, the maximal blood flow (16%) was observed at 7 min after KU-54 (5 mg/KG i.v.) dosing and there was a prolonged increase during 6 min.", 
    "23": "1. Abrupt termination of chronic propranolol therapy has baeen suggested to cause a 'rebound' phenomenon. To investigate this possibility guinea pigs were given propranolol orally for 21 days. 2. At various times over a 10 day period after the last dose hearts were removed and subjected to aerobic perfusion, ischaemia and reperfusion. Rhythm disturbances were measured and compared with corresponding values in control hearts from the control untreated animals. 3. Three to 6 days after termination of drug administration a pronounced increase in myocardial electrical instability was observed. During pre-ischaemic aerobic perfusion the incidence of arrhythmias was increased and during reperfusion the incidence of ventricular fibrillation rose dramatically.", 
    "24": "A summary is given of the common methods of treating glaucoma medically, beginning with the introduction of pilocarpine over 100 years ago and ending, for the time being, with the application of the beta-blocker Timolol Maleat (Chibro-Timoptol). The authors have been using Chibro-Timoptol for over a year and have treated more than 300 patients by this method so far. Timolol proved to have significant advantages over all other pressure-lowering drugs used in the past. It was just as effective or more effective than the substances used previously. For a newly diagnosed glaucoma, the authors therefore recommend using Timolol in all initial attempts at pressure regulation.", 
    "25": "Pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of daily oral doses of 100 mg and 200 mg atenolol, respectively, were studied in patients with angina pectoris by means of a double-blind cross-over randomized study. Half-lives and areas under the curve were of the same magnitude as described earlier for healthy volunteers and hypertensive patients. However, a steady state level was built up during 4-week medication of 100 mg or 200 mg atenolol daily. Intra-patient correlations of plasma levels and reductions in exercising heart rate were moderate (r = 0.56-0.85). Only plasma levels and exercising heart rates revealed significant differences after a 100 mg and 200 mg dose. These findings, together with the remaining clinical observations, demonstrated that a single daily dose of 100 mg atenolol is useful in patients with exercise-induced angina pectoris.", 
    "26": "1. Ten patients with mild essential hypertension and nine with severe treatment-resistant hypertension were treated with captopril. 2. Supine blood lpressure was controlled in 9/10 patients with mild hypertension (four with addition of propranolol). 3. There was no correlation between blood pressure fall and initial plasma renin concentration in patients with mild hypertension. 4. Captopril (plus diuretic and/or propranolol) controlled only 4/9 patients with severe hypertension. 5. Four patients developed reversible dysgeusia and one a skin rash.", 
    "27": "Tremor, the commonest of the involuntary movement disorders, is characterized by rhythmical oscillatory movement that occurs at rest or during activity; all tremors cease during sleep. Physiologic tremor is present in normal persons and is asymptomatic. Tremor is considered pathologic when it impairs a patient's function. Clinically, the pathologic tremors may be classified as accentuated physiologic, parkinsonian, essential, and cerebellar. We review here the basic mechanisms and clinical features of various tremors and emphasize recent advances in pathophysiology and management.", 
    "28": "The influence of carotid sinus pressure (CSP) on plasma renin activity (PRA) was studied in vagotomized, alpha-chloralose-anesthetized salt-deprived (<1 meq Na+/day) or salt-loaded (100-125 meq Na+day) cats. Changes in renal vascular resistance were produced by varying the pressure in the isolated perfused carotid sinus while maintaining renal blood flow constant in one kidney. Renal flow-pressure determinations were made at high, medium, and low CSP. Venous blood samples were withdrawn for PRA determination by radioimmunoassay after 10 min at each CSP. Low CSP resulted in an increased renal resistance and a dramatic elevation of the PRA in both groups. High CSP also resulted in an increase in PRA (due to contralateral variable-flow kidney) accompanied by a decrease in renal vascular resistance. No difference was found between PRA during medium CSP ad initial control PRA. Propranolol blocked the increase in PRA during low CSP but had no effect on the elevated PRA during high CSP. It is concluded that low CSP produced an increase in PRA that was associated with a reflex activation of renal sympathetic nerves.", 
    "29": "Heart rates of surgeons rise when they carry out operations and this rise is abolished by beta-blockade. In an assessment of the effect of oxprenolol on surgical performance a group of surgeons took double blind either oxprenolol 40 mg or a matching placebo. Oxprenolol abolished increases in heart rate (P < 0.001) but had no effect on a profile of performance test assessing tremor, suturing accuracy and co-ordination. Reaction time of the surgeons was significantly slowed by oxprenolol (P < 0.01). Using a self-administered visual analogue scoring system the surgeons recorded no subjective changes in mood after beta-blockade and were surprisingly unaware of whether they had taken oxprenolol or placebo.", 
    "30": "We present a patient with essential iris atrophy who was normotensive and yet had corneal edema and bullous keratopathy which cleared upon lowering the intraocular pressure. It is proposed that in this patient the endothelial functional status was so compromised that it could not handle the amount of fluid driven into the cornea by a normal intraocular pressure. A more favorable balance between intraocular pressure and endothelial functional status was obtained by lowering the intraocular pressure with acetazolamide and timolol.", 
    "31": "In rats, administration of the diphtheric toxin and propranolol after acute hemorrhage decreased production of the erythrocyte chalone. In vitro, adrenalin or ephedrine addition to erythrocytes increased excretion of the erythrocyte chalone. There is a direct correlation between production of chalone and depression of the bone marrow mitotic activity. The mechanism of the chalone release under the effect of the sympathetic transmitters, is discussed.", 
    "32": "Evidence based on the following three observations suggests the existence of a calcium transport system in the mammalian lens: calcium levels in the lens are lower than that measured in the aqueous humor; calcium efflux is temperature-dependent and is reduced by inhibitors of Ca++ transport; and there exists a calcium-acivated, magnesium-dependent ATPase. In rat, bovine, dog, and rabbit lenses, the concentration of total calcium was found to be approximately 0.2 mM, at least an order of magnitude lower than that found in the aqueous humor. To determine the nature of the mechanism responsible for maintaining these low levels, calcium fluxes were measured. During the initial rapid phase of 45Ca efflux, the rate at 4 degrees C was reduced by 85% compared with that found at 37 degrees C. Efflux was not altered in the absence of external Na+. Calcium efflux was reduced, however, by lanthanum and propranolol, inhibitors of Ca/Mg ATPase. The presence of Ca/Mg ATPase was also demonstrated in the rat, bovine, and rabbit lens and was likewise inhibited by both lanthum and propranolol.", 
    "33": "Muscular exercise was shown to reduce glycogen level in the skin of the rat. This process was fully prevented by blockade of beta adrenergic receptors with propranolol.", 
    "34": "The effects of clonidine (1.5 mcg/kg of body weight), L-DOPA (4 mg/kg) and propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) on the reflex bradycardia caused by stimulation of the arterial baroreceptors were studied in 46 waking cats in encephale isole preparations. The drugs were administered into the vertebral artery. They increased the gain of the cardiovagal reflex from the arterial baroreceptors by 162%, 162.5%, 150% respectively with regard to the control values. A similar effect of clonidine and propranolol was manifested also in cats with spinal cord destroyed between the segments C1 to Th12. The effects of clonidine and L-DOPA on the cardiovagal component of the reflex were abolished by aceperon (4 mg/kg) injected into the vertebral artery.", 
    "35": "The changes in the response of adrenergic receptors alpha and beta in the blood vessels in the working muscles in a hindlimb in cats were studied after intra-arterial administration of noradrenaline, isoprenaline and during electric stimulation of the sympathetic trunk. The experiments were carried out during alpha-adrenergic receptors blockade with dihydroergotamine (0.3 mg/kg) beta-adrenergic receptors blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg) and blockade of acetylcholine M receptors with atropine (0.5 mg/kg). The investigations were performed at rest, during exercise (electric stimulation of the sciatic nerve) and after the exercise. The following results deserve attention: 1) beta-adrenergic receptors blockade reduced significantly the alpha-adrenolytic effect of exercise restoring the ability of blood vessel to constriction in response to noradrenaline; 2) the vasodilator effect of isoprenaline evident in resting state and maintained to some extent during exercise was abolished completely by preceding alpha-adrenergic blockade. The changes in the reactivity of resistance vessels in working skeletal muscles to noradrenaline, with abolition of its vasoconstrictor effect, have been shown by Rein [7] and others authors [2, 5]. Similarly, it is well known that the resistance vessels contain two types of adrenergic receptors alpha and beta, and that the response of the vessels to stimulation of these receptors are different [1]. In view of the recently published observations of Jarhult and Lundvall suggesting that the beta-adrenergic receptors play an important physiological role [6] in the arterial part of the microcirculation [6] and in view of the hypothesis put forward by Kunos and Szentivanyj that alpha and beta receptors can be transformed depending on the intensity of tissue metabolism [8] it seemed worth while to study more systematically the changes of the reactivity of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors in the vascular bed of the skeletal muscles during and after muscle exercise.", 
    "36": "The hypothesis that modifications in beta-adrenergic receptors may be responsible for age-dependent change previously observed in vivo, has been investigated. Beta-adrenoceptor characteristics of submandibular glands of mice were studied by using the beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol. Data from such studies indicated the presence of two functional populations of binding sites in membrane preparations from young animals, displaying high and low affinity, respectively. Experiments performed on old mice membrane preparations revealed a 50% decrease in the high-affinity population receptor number when compared to the preparations from young animals. However, the affinity did not change significantly with advancing age. With regard to the low-affinity population, no statistically significant changes were observed. From these data it can be reasonably assumed that beta-adrenoceptor alteration during ageing may play a major role in the age-dependent impairment of beta-adrenergic responses in vivo.", 
    "37": "1. ACTH (20 microgram/kg per day) produced an elevation in blood pressure associated with an increase in cardiac output in conscious sheep, due in the first 72 h to a rise in heart rate. Stroke volume did not rise until the fourth day of ACTH treatment. 2. Calculated total peripheral resistance did not change. 3. Intreavenous administration of acebutolol prior to and during ACTH administration did not modify the rise in blood pressure, but this was associated with a rise in total peripheral resistance. 4. These studies show that while ACTH-induced hypertension is usually associated with increased cardiac output, rather than total peripheral resistance it still occurs, but is associated with a rise in total peripheral resistance if the rise in cardiac output is prevented by beta-adrenoreceptor blockade.", 
    "38": "The effects of left stellate ganglion stimulation (LSGS) on regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) and epicardial S-T segment were investigated in the normal and ischemic myocardium of anesthetized dogs. In nonischemic myocardium LSGS decreased calculated coronary resistance, increased RMBF, and reduced the endocardial-to-epicardial (endo-to-epi) ratio. These effects were reversed after atenolol (1 mg/kg) and abolished after combined atenolol and phenoxybenzamine (3 mg/kg) treatments. In ischemic myocardium LSGS did not change RMBF but increased S-T segment. However, after atenolol, LSGS increased ischemic RMBF and the ischemic-to-nonischemic areas flow ratio (reverse coronary steal phenomenon), these effects being abolished by phenoxybenzamine. We conclude that 1) LSGS increases RMBF and decreases endo-to-epi ratio in nonischemic areas by beta 1-adrenergic stimulation through metabolic autoregulation, 2)beta 1-adrenergic blockade in nonischemic areas unmasks alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction inducing a redistribution of flow towards ischemic areas, and 3) further elevation of S-T segment by LSGS is due to oxygen requirements enhancement by beta 1-adrenoceptors stimulation.", 
    "39": "The location of beta-adrenoceptors in human parathyroid gland was studied using an immunohistochemical method. Frozen sections of human parathyroid glands, taken from surgical samples, were treated with (-)-alprenolol, washed and exposed to (-)-alprenolol antibodies conjugated with fluorescent dyes. The (-)-alprenolol was bound to the parathyroid principal cells and to the main blood vessels. On the contrary, adrenergic nerve fibres, demonstrated with formaldehyde fluorescence technique, were only located within the walls of main blood vessels. The findings are discussed.", 
    "40": "A method of reproducibility measuring human leukocyte beta-adrenergic receptor density and affinity has been developed and applied to the study of receptor regulation in man. The method has the advantages of using a membrane preparation which binds highly specifically and employing techniques such as using low concentrations of [3H]dihydroalprenol, analyzing the data by computer modelling techniques, and providing data from both granulocytes and lymphocytes in the same individual to minimize measurement errors. Using this methodology, human beta-adrenergic receptor regulation is examined. Cortisone acetate was found to induce an acute rise in granulocyte beta-adrenergic receptor density and adenylate cyclase activity and an acute fall in lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptor density. This potentially differential regulation of a single receptor subtype in two lines of leukocytes has important implications for the study of receptor regulation in man using leukocyte models.", 
    "41": "The present study was undertaken in order to investigate the possibility of cardiac hypersensitivity to norepinephrine (NE) after propranolol withdrawal in rats. The effect of NE was studied on heart rate and left intraventricular pressure development (maximal dP/dt) in the isolated perfused heart at various time periods after termination of the propranolol feeding. Also, the influence of propranolol withdrawal on vulnerability to aconitine-induced arrhythmias in vivo was evaluated in anesthetized rats. No hypersensitivity to NE was seen in the perfused rat heart 1 and 3 days after propranolol withdrawal. Rather, a depressed response to NE was registered suggesting a long half-life for the disappearance of beta adrenoceptor blockade. Increased vulnerability to aconitine-induced arrhythmias was observed 1 and 3 days after treatment with propranolol had ceased. Rats receiving propranolol continuously until experimentation exhibited an elevated threshold to aconitine-induced arrhythmias. These data indicate that a hypothetical rebound phenomenon after withdrawal of propranolol is not associated with an increase in mechanical performance of the heart in response to NE. A decreased threshold for development of arrhythmias appears, however, to be at hand, perhaps due to an inbalance in the transmembrane sodium flux in the heart in the early time course after propranolol withdrawal.", 
    "42": "Dextran (9 mg/ml incubate) was found to induce a serotonin (5-HT) release from isolated rat peritoneal mast cells of about 10% within an incubation period of 5 min. at 37 degrees. The extent of release was not increased by using higher concentrations of dextran or by increasing the incubation period from 5 to 20 min. The dextran-induced release of 5-HT was increased to 50-60% when the mast cells were preincubated with phosphatidylserine (PS) in doses of 2.6-4.3 microgram/ml incubate. Higher concentrations of PS alone induced a rapid 5-HT release of approximately 50-60%. The 5-HT release process studied was found to possess both similarities and dissimilarities with the previously described dextran-induced release process of histamine, also studied in isolated rat peritoneal mast cells. The results supported previous indirect evidence of a 5-HT release from mast cells in the early phase of the dextran-induced anaphylactoid reaction in the rat.", 
    "43": "The effects of dopamine on the force of contraction and on cylic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels were investigated in isolated electrically driven left atria (32 degrees C, 1 Hz) and papillary muscles (37 degrees C, 0.5 Hz) of the rabbit. In both preparations only the combined application of phentolamine (10(-6) M) and pindolol (3 X 10(-8) M) shifted the entire dose-response curves for the positive inotropic effect of dopamine to the right, while either antagonist used separately had no effect. Similar results were obtained when the indirect action of dopamine via the release of endogenous noradrenaline was inhibited by cocaine (3 X 10(-5) M) or by pretreatment of the rabbits with reserpine (6 mg/kg, s.c., 16 hr). Increases in cyclic AMP induced by dopamine (10(-4) M in atria and 3 X 10(-4) M in papillary muscles) were prevented by cocaine or by pretreatment with reserpine, indicating that these increases are mainly evoked by released endogenous noradrenaline. It is concluded that both alpha- and beta- adrenoceptors may play roles in the direct positive inotropic action of dopamine in the rabbit heart. The failure of the direct action of dopamine to increase cyclic AMP may be due to a cyclic-AMP-decreasing effect of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation, which may counteract cyclic AMP increases induced by dopamine via beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "44": "Atrial and sinoatrial conduction intervals were measured in patients before and after the intravenous administration of one of four cardioactive drugs: procainamide, atropine, ouabain, and propranolol. Procainamide uniformly prolonged atrial conduction and shortened sinoatrial conduction. Atropine also shortened sinoatrial conduction but did not significantly alter atrial conduction. Ouabain prolonged sinoatrial conduction in patients with normal control sinoatrial conduction intervals and did not affect atrial conduction. Propranolol did not significantly alter sinoartrial conduction and only prolonged interatrial conduction in patients with normal base line atrial conduction intervals. Of the cardioactive drugs tested, only procainamide and propranolol significantly altered the atrial conduction intervals; furthermore, the effects of these cardioactive drugs on sinoatrial conduction were disparate from their effects on atrial conduction.", 
    "45": "The effects of acute renovascular hypertension on the sympathetic nervous system, regional blood flow and cardiac function were studied in conscious dogs submitted to renal artery occlusion by inflation of a cuff implanted previously around one renal artery. We then compared the alterations in plasma renin and catecholamine levels and in the various hemodynamic parameters induced by those maneuvers in intact dogs, to those in dogs pretreated with alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers. Subsequently, the converting enzyme inhibitor teprotide was administered to inhibit angiotensin formation in both experiments. Our results suggest that both the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic system contribute to the rise in blood pressure. The hemodynamic changes and alterations in regional blood flows accompanying this acute hypertension appear to be due mostly to the increase in plasma angiotensin, since prior adrenoceptor blockade only attenuated their magnitude but did not alter their direction. However, angiotensin-induced coronary vasoconstriction was observed only in adrenergically blocked but not intact animals, probably because of the protective effect of baroreceptor-mediated reflex sympathetic coronary vasodilation.", 
    "46": "Aggressive behavior in the footshock induced fighting test (FIFT) was studied after treatment with benzodiazepines (diazepam, nitrazepam, temazepam, medazepam) given alone or in combination with beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists (propranolol, oxprenolol, practolol). With the combinations of those drugs it was found that diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) with propranolol, oxprenolol, and practolol (20 mg/kg); nitrazepam (0.25 mg/kg) with propranolol (10 mg/kg) and nitrazepam (0.1 mg/kg) with practolol (20 mg/kg); temazepam (0.5 mg/kg) with propranolol (10 mg/kg) and temazepam (1 mg/kg) with oxprenolol and practolol (20 mg/kg); medazepam (1.5 mg/kg) with propranolol (10.mg/kg) and medazepam (1 mg/kg) with practolol (20 mg/kg) produced a statistically significant decrease in frequency of fighting episodes in mice as compared with benzodiazepines alone and with control animals. The results demonstrate that beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists potentiate the antiaggressive action of benzodiazepines when given in doses which by themselves do not suppress aggression.", 
    "47": "The effects of acute hypercalcaemia on arterial pressure and vascular tone have been poorly understood. We analysed the effect of a bolus of calcium chloride (15 mg . kg-1 iv) on arterial pressure, total peripheral resistance, and left ventricular function in 25 conscious dogs studied with or without pharmacological autonomic blockade. Without autonomic blocking drugs, the maximum response to calcium included increases of +139.4 kPa . s-1 (+1046 mmHg . s-1) in maximum rate of change of left ventricular pressure, +2.2 cm3 in stroke volume, +2.6 kPa (+ 19.2 mmHg) in aortic systolic pressure, and +0.6 kPa (+4.4 mmHg) in mean aortic pressure, but total peripheral resistance was unchanged. During beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, calcium again increased maximum rate of change of pressure and stroke volume, increased mean aortic pressure (2.2 kPa [+16.5 mmHg]), and increased resistance by 35%. When calcium was given during alpha-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine, mean aortic pressure did not rise, and resistance fell by 19%. The calcium-induced rise in resistance during beta-adrenergic blockade was abolished by surgical adrenalectomy. We conclude that excess extracellular calcium ion may influence vascular resistance by increasing autonomic nervous system excitation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic vascular receptors. A major mechanism by which the sympathetic nervous system effects occur is through increased release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla.", 
    "48": "Hypertension of any degree is associated with an increased mortality and morbidity. Patients with severe hypertension are at serious risk from heart failure, stroke, irreversible renal failure and retinal damage, and must be treated promptly. Failure to control the blood pressure suggests an underlying renal or endocrine cause, which may be correctable and which should be investigated.", 
    "49": "To acquire data on the mechanism of central effects of adrenergic beta-blockers as antihypertensive agents, experiments were done on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Each group included 5 animals. Propranolol (5 mg/kg), pindolol (0.3 mg/kg), alprenolol (5 mg/kg) or bupranolol (5 mg/kg) were given subcutaneously to the respective groups, once daily for 7 days, while the control group were given no treatment. All the rats were sacrificed 12 hours after the last injection, and the concentrations of the following materials were measured: noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in the brain; NA in the heart muscle; adrenaline and NA in the adrenal glands. As compared with the control group, all rats on the beta-blockers showed an increase in NA concentration in the brain. Both pindolol and alprenolol, which have an intrinsic sympathomimetic action (ISA), increased DA concentrations in the brain. Both propranolol and bupranolol, which have no ISA, either decreased DA concentrations or showed no effect. No marked change was seen in 5-HT concentration in the brain and of NA in the heart muscle. Catecholamine concentrations in the adrenal glands showed a tendency toward decrease. These results suggest that the mechanism of antihypertensive effects of beta-blockers may be due to depression of the peripheral sympathetic activity, as induced by the central inhibitory effects of beta-blockers.", 
    "50": "Effects of atenolol on the cardiovascular system were studied in rats and dogs. Atenolol (10 microgram/kg - 3 mg/kg) did not increase heart rate significantly in rats pretreated with reserpine (5 mg/kg), while a significant increase occurred with practolol (30 microgram/kg - 3 mg/kg). Atenolol (100 microgram/kg) inhibited the response of canine heart (heart rate and myocardial contractile force) to isoproterenol to a similar degree as seen with propranolol (100 microgram/kg) did. The ability of atenolol to inhibit vasodilating action of isoproterenol, however, was about 1/12 of that of propranolol. Atenolol (0.5 mg/kg) did not inhibit hemodynamic responses to ouabain and CaCl2 in dogs, while this drug inhibited these responses to isoproterenol. Atenolol decreased heart rate, myocardial contractile force, left ventricular pressure, and rate of rise of the left ventricular pressure (dp/dt LV max) dose-dependently. Atenolol (1 mg/kg) decreased coronary venous outflow and myocardial oxygen consumption in dogs, but did not alter the myocardium to a more reduced state, as determined by coronary arterial and venous lactate and pyruvate levels. These results confirmed that atenolol is a potent cardioselective beta-blocker devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic action. The results also suggest that atenolol inhibits cardiac function without disturbing the intracellular redox state of the myocardium.", 
    "51": "KWD 2131 (1-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-(1,1dimethyl-2-hydroxyethyl-amino/ethanol sulphate) is a beta-adrenoceptor stimulating compound that has been shown to be equipotent to terbutaline with regard to inhibition of anaphylactic histamine release from guinea pig lung tissue but less potent than terbutaline as a cardioaccelerator in this species. In the present study KWD 2131 was found to be about 5-10 times less potent than terbutaline as a cardioaccelerator, tremorogenic and bronchodilator agent on subcutaneous (s.c.) injection in man. S.c. injection of KWD 2131 in a subthreshold dose for bronchodilation, i.e. 0.3 mg or 0.6 mg, given prior to a bronchial provocation test with specific allergen had no protective effect on the changes in specific airway conductance and peak expiratory flow in a double-blind cross-over study in 12 patients with allergic asthma. It is concluded that KWD 2131 probably has a less selective antiallergic activity in man as compared to guinea pig and that the methodology employed for the evaluation is useful for the characterization of antiallergic drugs with bronchodilator properties.", 
    "52": "The present survey paper, concerning newer drugs used in the treatment of arterial hypertension, deals with the following types of agents: centrally acting drugs, such as clonidine nd alpha-methyl-DOPA; vasodilator drugs with a direct action on smooth muscle, such as minoxidil; diuretic agents, with special reference to the choice of a drug from the vast number of compounds; beta-sympatholytic drugs (beta blockers) and which drug to choose; prazosin, with special reference to its considerable theoretical interest; drugs that influence the renin-angiotensin system, such as saralasin (P 113), an angiotensin II-antagonist; and inhibitors of the converting enzyme, such as teprotide (SQ 20,881) and captopril (SQ 14,225). Finally, a general schedule for the treatment of hypertension, issued as a guideline by the Dutch Institution of General Practitioners, is presented.", 
    "53": "1. The response of plasma renin activity to frusemide 40 mg given intravenously, was examined before and after oral propranolol 160 mg daily for 7 days in normal and hypertensive subjects. 2. Although basal renin levels were often reduced, the increase following frusemide was essentially unaltered by propranolol therapy. 3. These findings indicate that enhanced renin activity associated with diuretic use may not be prevented by concurrent propranolol administration. Limitation of hypotensive action of combined beta-blocker diuretic therapy can therefore be anticipated. 4. Preservation of the renin stimulatory effect of frusemide during beta blockade confirms the value of this procedure in the investigation of mineralocorticoid and renovascular hypertension were discontinuation of treatment may be undesirable.", 
    "54": "1. In rat isolated tail arteries and atria in which transmitter stores are labelled with (3H)-noradrenaline, isoprenaline in low concentrations facilitates the stimulation-induced efflux of tritium. 2. This effect is dependent on the frequency and duration of electrical stimulation, being observed only at low frequency (2 Hz) and short duration (10 s in atria and 30 s in arteries) or at high frequency (5 Hz) and long duration (1 min in atria and 4 min in arteries). 3. In atria, phenotlamine enchances tritium efflux with stimulation at 5 Hz for 1 min but not at 2 Hz for 10 s. Conversely, propranolol reduces tritium efflux with stimulation at 2 Hz for 10 s but not at 4 Hz for 1 min. 4. The results can be interpreted in terms of the selective operation, depending on the frequency and duration of electrical stimulation, of inhibitory and facilitatory feedback loops for transmitter release involving prejunctional alpha -and beta-adrenoceptors, respectively.", 
    "55": "1. Echocardiographic haemodynamic and left ventricular parameters were determined in twenty-one normontensives and thirty-six hypertensives during the last trimester of pregnancy. 2. Equivalent blood pressure control was obtained in hypertensives with bet rest only, oxprenolol or methyldopa, but remained above normotensive levels. 3. Cardiac output was elevated in the last trimester of pregnancy in normotensivves and hypertensives. 4. Left ventricular mass was increased in normal pregnancy, but displayed an exaggerated increase in hypertensives. 5. Total peripheral resistance was inappropriately elevated in hypertensive pregnancy, but was normalized in the oxprenolol-treated group. 6. There was no reduction in heart rate or cardiac output in the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker-treated group. This feature, in combination with lowered peripheral resistance, may contribute to the improvement in foetal outcome observed in maternal hypertension of pregnancy treated with oxprenolol.", 
    "56": "Bucindolol (MJ 13105), administered to conscious, normotensive dogs (a) attenuated the positive chronotropic and diastolic depressor response elicited by isoproterenol, (b) increased heart rate and (c) elevated plasma renin activity (PRA). Repeated daily administration of bucindolol caused a cumulative reduction in isoproterenol-elicited cardiac and vascular responses. The increase in heart rate was not blocked by atropine and only partially attenuated by propranolol. To study the effect of bucindolol on erect blood pressure, dogs were tilted rapidly through 90 degrees from the supine to a head-up erect position, a maneuver that reflexly increases blood pressure. Following the administration of bucindolol, blood pressure in the erect position was lower than before drug but was still higher than blood pressure in the supine position suggesting the compensatory reflex response to this postural change is still functional. Bucindolol had no significant effect on P wave and QRS durations or P-R and corrected Q-T intervals of the EKG.", 
    "57": "Phenylephrine (PE) in presence of propranolol evokes an alpha-adrenergic inotropic response in rat heart. The time course of this response is characterized by a transient decrease in maximal developed tension (Tmax) to subcontrol levels (negative phase of the inotropic response) followed by an increase which reaches maximum after 4-5 min. (positive phase of the inotropic response). Prazosin (PRZ), a selective alpha 1-receptor blocker, inhibited preferentially the positive phase of the inotropic response and displaced the dose-response curve of PE to the right in nanomolar concentrations, indicating a competitive mechanism of inhibition. Phentolamine, a non-selective alpha-blocker, blocked both the negative and the positive phase of the inotropic response to about the same degree. PRZ appears to be a competitive alpha-adrenergic antagonist with high affinity in rat heart. Two populations of alpha-adrenergic receptors may be present: one stimulatory (alpha 1) and one inhibitory.", 
    "58": "1. The disposition of a new beta-blocking agent, chloropractolol, labelled with 14C and with 3H, has been studied in rats and mice. 2. After i.v. administration to the rat (25 mg/kg) of a mixture of [14C]- and [3H]chloropractolol, urinary and faecal excretion, biliary elimination and tissue distribution were similar for the two labelled species. However, 3% of the dose was recovered as 14CO2. 3. Chloropractolol and/or metabolites did not show high cardioselectivity. Uptake by heart of the two labelled species was very close to that found for [14C]practolol and [14C]propranolol. 4. Preliminary metabolic studies using h.p.l.c. have shown that in the rat chloropractolol is extensively metabolized, which contrasts with the more limited metabolism of practolol in the same species. Deacetylation is a minor route of metabolism. A structure for the main urinary metabolite is suggested.", 
    "59": "Beta-blocking agents have been used for many years in psychiatry. But many are suspicious about their mechanisms and therapeutic effects. In this review, the most part of clinical trials is reported and criticized. With the exception of anxiolytic effects, the other therapeutic effects are still questionable for many reasons, such as the methodology of clinical trials. In this paper, others agents which interact with the noradrenergic system are envisaged. It is taking into account all these factors (alpha and beta receptors, alpha and beta agents) that we can looking for award for a real progress in the field of biochemical psychiatry.", 
    "60": "Anxiety has three essential elements: the subjective experience, autonomic symptoms and avoidance behaviour. Various theories are considered which highlight the psychic and somatic aspects of anxiety. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs have been used with advantage to treat everyday stresses. These include the anxiety produced by the civil disturbances in Northern Ireland, performing surgery, dentistry, musical instruments or speaking in public, as well as examination nerves. The profile of symptoms such as tachycardia, palpitations and tremor which are most likely to respond to beta-blockers are discussed as well as their side-effects. Their mode of action is different from other anxiolytics, with which they can be combined.", 
    "61": "The contribution of beta-adrenoceptor activation to renin release was examined in anaesthetized dogs using renal nerve stimulation (RNS) at different discharge rates in the presence of i.v. beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The animals were divided into 2 groups, which received either low or high level of RNS, defined by the frequency of stimulation producing decrease in renal blood flow of 5 and 50%, respectively. Low level RNS increased renin release tenfold. The renin release response was almost abolished by 0.5 mg/kg of metoprolol or dl-propranolol but unaffected by 0.5 mg/kg of d-propranolol. The increase in renin release to high level RNS was equally reduced by 33% by 0.5 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg of metoprolol. dl-propranolol, 0.5 mg/kg, reduced the renin release response to about the same extent, 44%, while 2.0 mg/kg reduced it somewhat more, 59%. This was probably due to its membrane stabilizing properties as d-propranolol, 2.0 mg/kg and lidocaine 2.0 mg/kg + 0.1 mg x kg-1 x min-1, also reduced the renin release response. These data suggest that the renin release response to low level RNS is almost completely mediated by beta-adrenoceptors which are of the beta-1 subtype. High level RNS results in a renin release, which is only partly mediated by beta-1-adrenoceptors. The remainder is apparently related to other mechanisms activated by high level RNS and is probably a consequence of the associated renal vasoconstriction.", 
    "62": "By use of an XAD-2 sample purification procedure, the quantitative patterns of the in vitro metabolism of propranolol and four of its metabolites have been examined by a GC/MS/DATA procedure. Supernatant fractions (10,000g) from both dog and rat livers have been used to degrade propranolol, 4-hydroxypropranolol, N-deisopropylpropranolol, propranolol glycol, and alpha-naphthoxylactic acid. There were both qualitative and quantitative differences in dog and rat metabolism; rat 10,000g supernatant fraction produced more hydroxylation than that of the dog. alpha-Naphthol is not produced from propranolol directly, but rather from alpha-naphthoxylactic acid with an intermediate step requiring NAD+ as a cofactor. We observed no degradation of 4-hydroxypropranolol from the 10,000g supernatant preparations. Thus, 1,4-naphthalenediol is more likely a product of 4-hydroxypropranolol glycol."
