Propensity analysis was used as a substitute for randomization in a study comparing the survival of revascularized and medically treated patients with ischemic dysfunction. Dobutamine echocardiography was performed in 274 patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction (mean ejection fraction 32%), with 32% having viability in > or =25% of the myocardium. Clinical, angiographic, and echocardiographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups except for multivessel disease, hyperlipidemia, and the percentage of nonviable myocardium. A propensity score, reflecting the probability of receiving revascularization, was derived for each patient from baseline variables. After stratification by propensity scores, there were no differences between groups. Patients were followed for cardiac death. Revascularization was performed in 130 patients, and 144 were medically treated. There were 114 cardiac deaths (42%) over 4.5 years of follow-up. After propensity score adjustment, survival was better with revascularization (mean survival 5.9 vs 3.3 years, hazard ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 027 to 0.65, p <0.0001). Medical and device therapy during follow-up was similar between treatment groups, except that beta-blocker use was more common in revascularized patients. After adjustment for beta-blocker use and propensity score, survival remained better in revascularized patients (hazard ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.72, p = 0.0006). In conclusion, revascularization improves long-term survival in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and a wide range of viability.",

Rupture accounted for 7.6% (45/589) of all deaths occurring in the first 30 days of follow-up and 24% (33/138) of deaths in which autopsies were obtained. Compared with survivors, rupture was associated with increased age, hypertension, increased Killip class, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and Q wave MI, and inversely related to beta-blocker and diuretic use. Compared with patients who died of other causes within 30 days, patients with myocardial rupture were more likely to have had an inferior MI, Q wave MI, or hypertension; to have used oral anticoagulants; or to have received thrombolytic therapy.",

An undetermined hepatopathy also was found at presentation and resolved after metronidazole antimicrobial treatment. Cardiopulmonary medical treatment, including a loop diuretic, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, and a bronchodilator provided improvement of the clinical signs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of antemortem diagnosis and treatment of congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy in a member of the family Procyonidae, suggesting that HCM should be considered as a differential diagnosis in kinkajous displaying clinical signs of dyspnea and exercise intolerance.",

On arrival his blood pressure was 60/40 mm Hg, and he was in a cardiogenic shock. The electrocardiogram showed broad QRS-complexes and large T waves. Serum-potassium was 9.1 mmol/L and he had acute renal failure with oliguria, probably caused by reduced cardiac output due to hypovolemia combined with taking an ACE inhibitor and spironolactone. Haemodialysis was started and during dialysis QRS complexes became more narrow and heart rate and blood pressure normalized. The patient was discharged 10 days later with normal potassium and creatinine levels. Patients treated with ACE-inhibitors and spironolactone should be monitored closely. During intercurrent illness dehydration may occur and this can lead to renal failure and hyperkalemia which can be life-threatening.

Poor evidence exists for neutrophil infiltration in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques, and its association with plaque morphology has not yet been described. A set of 355 human carotid plaques was stained for the neutrophil marker CD66b. High neutrophil numbers were found in plaques with a large lipid core, high macrophage numbers, and low collagen amount and smooth muscle cell numbers. High neutrophil numbers were associated with high interleukin 8 (P<0.001) and matrix metalloproteases 8 (P=0.005) and 9 (P<0.001) plaque levels. High microvessel density within plaques was correlated with high neutrophil numbers (P=0.01). In addition, low numbers of neutrophils were associated with female sex and use of beta-blockers.",

It is not clear if the reduction in SV is due primarily to hyperthermia or if it is a secondary effect of an elevation in HR reducing ventricular filling. In the present study, the upward drift of HR during prolonged exercise was prevented by a very small dose of the \u03b21-adrenoreceptor blocker (atenolol; \u03b2B), thus allowing SV to be compared at a given HR during normothermia and hyperthermia. Eleven men cycled for 60 min at 57% of peak O2 uptake after receiving placebo control (PL) or a low dose (0.2 mg/kg) of \u03b2B. Hyperthermia was induced by reducing heat dissipation during exercise. Four experimental conditions were studied: normothermia-PL, normothermia-\u03b2B, hyperthermia-PL, and hyperthermia-\u03b2B. Hyperthermia increased skin and core temperature by 4.3 degrees C and 0.8 degrees C (P<0.01), respectively. \u03b2B prevented HR elevation with hyperthermia: HR values were similar at minute 60 during normothermia-PL and hyperthermia-\u03b2B (155\u00b111 and 154\u00b113 beats/min, respectively, P=0.82). However, SV was increased by 7% during the final 20 min of exercise during hyperthermia-\u03b2B compared with normothermia-PL (treatment\u00d7time interaction, P=0.03). In conclusion, when matched for HR, mild hyperthermia increased SV during exercise. Furthermore, the reduction in SV throughout prolonged exercise under normothermic and mildly hyperthermic conditions appears to be due to the increase in HR.",

Clenbuterol increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which resulted in inhibition of myocardial apoptosis as indicated by the reduction of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase end labelling-positive staining, Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA and caspase-3 protein expression. The G(i)-protein inhibitor pertussis toxin blocked the clenbuterol-induced improvement in cardiac function and infarct size. Pretreatment with ICI 118551(a selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) inhibited the effects of clenbuterol mentioned above.

In a retrospective cohort study, all diabetic-hypertensive patients attending The Al-Watani Medical Governmental Center from August 01, 2006 until August 01, 2007 were enrolled in the study. Patients with congestive heart failure and/or end-stage renal disease were excluded from the study. The proportion of use of five different anti-hypertensive drug classes were compared for all patients receiving 1, 2, 3, or 4 drugs, and separately among patients with and without reduced renal function. Over 60% of patients were receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), followed by diuretics (40.8%), calcium channel blockers (25.1%) and (beta-blockers (12.5%). The majority of patients (> 55%) were either on mono or no drug therapy. Patients on monotherapy were mostly receiving ACEI/ARB (60%). In patients with reduced renal function, use of diuretics, but not ACEI/ARB or CCB, was higher and 41.8% of the patients were on monotherapy compared to 46.6% in patients with normal renal function. The proportion of patients achieving good BP control was 20% with mono-therapy and 28% with combination therapy. Our study suggests that the pattern of anti-hypertensive therapy was generally consistent with inter-national guidelines.

In this study, WT and Cav-1 KO mice were treated with angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), telmisartan (Telm), and cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography. Treatment of Cav-1 KO mice with Telm significantly improved cardiac function compared with age-matched vehicle-treated Cav-1 KO mice, whereas Telm did not affect cardiac function in WT mice. Both left ventricular (LV) weight to body weight ratios and LV to tibial length ratios were also reverted by Telm in Cav-1 KO but not in WT mice. LV hypertrophy was associated with increased expression of natriuretic peptides A and B, \u03b2-myosin heavy chain and TGF-\u03b2, and Telm treatment normalized the expression of these genes. Telm reduced the expression of collagen genes (Col1A and Col3A) and associated perivascular fibrosis in intramyocardial vessels in Cav-1 KO mice.

Overall effect sizes vs. placebo were significant for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (-0.08 [-0.14; -0.02]), and a trend was found for beta-blockers (-0.09 [-0.19; 0.01]). The data did not allow other direct comparisons vs. placebo. Significant benefits were found for calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) compared to both ACE inhibitors (0.37 [0.20; 0.54]), as well as for angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) compared to beta-blockers (0.42 [0.29; 0.55]). Diuretics were less efficient than CCBs (-0.09 [-0.16; -0.02]). Indirect comparisons with network meta-analysis showed significant effects of CCBs and ARBs vs. placebo (both P < 0.05) and vs. diuretics (both P < 0.001). The CIMT decrease with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers was greater than with diuretics (both P < 0.05) but was not different from the placebo effect. In subgroup analyses, significant benefits occurred with lower baseline CIMT values and shorter treatment durations but were unrelated to the size of the blood pressure decrease. In conclusion, among antihypertensive drugs, CCBs and ARBs have the greatest effect on CIMT.", 
    "56": "Beta-blockers may have a negative impact on survival in patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the administration of beta-blockers on long-term survival in patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites. We performed a single-center, observational, case-only, prospective study of patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites who did or did not receive beta-blockers for the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding; 151 patients were included. The mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was 18.8 +/- 4.1. All patients regularly underwent large-volume paracentesis and intravenous albumin administration. Seventy-seven patients (51%) were treated with propranolol (113 +/- 46 mg/day). The median follow-up for the whole group was 8 months. The median survival time was 10 months [95% confidence interval (CI) = 8-12 months]. The probability of survival at 1 year was 41% (95% CI = 33%-49%). The clinical characteristics and laboratory values at enrolment were not significantly different between patients who were receiving propranolol and those who were not. The median survival time was 20.0 months (95% CI = 4.8-35.2 months) in patients not treated with propranolol and 5.0 months (95% CI = 3.5-6.5 months) in those treated with propranolol (P = 0.0001). The 1-year probability of survival was significantly lower in patients who received propranolol [19% (95% CI = 9%-29%)] versus those who did not [64% (95% CI = 52%-76%), P < 0.0001]. The independent variables of mortality were Child-Pugh class C, hyponatremia and renal failure as causes of refractory ascites, and beta-blocker therapy.",

    "58": "The adrenergic beta-1 receptor gene (ADRB1) Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly variants differentially affect blood pressure response to beta-blocker therapy. Binding site prediction results for fluoxetine and paroxetine in a bioinformatics model estimated that each of these particular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have high receptor affinity as an \"Adrenergic (beta) Blocker,\" which was confirmed in vitro. This pilot study was conducted to understand the relationship between these \"beta-blocking\" SSRIs (fluoxetine and paroxetine) and cardiac vital signs (systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR)), when subjects are stratified by ADRB1 genotype. Previously ascertained DNA and clinical data was examined from 122 subjects recruited for a cross-sectional study of health and well being during SSRI pharmacotherapy. A multivariate linear regression analysis was used to determine which variables affected cardiac vital signs. There was a significant interaction between Arg389Gly variant status and \"beta-blocking\" SSRIs [p = 0.0353] in relation to SBP. Specifically in homozygous Arg389 subjects, those receiving \"beta-blocking\" SSRIs had significantly lower SBP (mean 104 mmHg) compared to the group taking other SSRIs (mean 122 mmHg) [p = 0.0437]. In these same homozygous Arg389 subjects, those receiving \"beta-blocking\" SSRIs also had lower HR (mean 60 bpm) compared to the other SSRIs (mean 79 bpm) [p = 0.00877]. Future prospective studies of this phenomenon are necessary to identify all genetic markers that can predict SSRI-associated cardiovascular effects that may be related to the SSRI discontinuation syndrome and potentially influence pharmacotherapy decisions.",

All the peptides exhibit a strong and prolonged antidiuretic activity. Additionally, analogues II, III and IV display antiuterotonic activity and analogue II is also a weak V(1a) receptor blocker. The conformational analysis has shown that beta-turns at positions 2,3 and/or 3,4 are characteristic of OT antagonists. In turn, the beta-turn in the Cys(6)-Gly(9) fragment seems to be crucial for enhancement of the antidiuretic activity. The high accessibility of aromatic side chains at positions 2 and 3 plays a crucial role in antagonist-receptor binding. Moreover, orientation of the Phe(3) side chain is claimed to be important for V(1a) receptor affinity.",

Here we present evidence that chronic oral administration of carvedilol, a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker, significantly attenuates brain oligomeric \u03b2-amyloid content and cognitive deterioration in 2 independent AD mouse models. We found that carvedilol treatment significantly improved neuronal transmission, and that this improvement was associated with the maintenance of number of the less stable \"learning\" thin spines in the brains of AD mice. Our novel observation that carvedilol interferes with the neuropathologic, biochemical, and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive deterioration in AD supports the potential development of carvedilol as a treatment for AD.", 
    "65": "Prior studies demonstrated sex-related differences in many aspects of chronic heart failure (HF), and in the appropriate use, individual response or complication rates with non-pharmacological treatment, too. There is seasonal variability in morbidity and mortality of HF with significant gender differences, partially due to respiratory diseases, which may be potentionally preventable by vaccination. Quitting smoking is associated with substantial decrease in morbidity and mortality in HF patients which is similar in magnitude to the effect of an appropriate beta-blocker use. Yet little emphasis has been placed on smoking cessation strategies in women with HF and should be adopted as vigorously as proven medical therapy. Complications of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation were more frequent in females. Gender disparity exists in the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy, although they are beneficial for both women and men. Smaller women have limited access to left ventricular assist device (LVAD) because these devices require a minimum body surface to fit properly. Women were more likely than men to develop severe right ventricular failure after implantation of LVAD. Lower cut-off level of peak oxygen consumption was suggested for women to determine optimal timing for heart transplantation. Disease management programs probably narrows gender differences in quality of care and survival among HF patients. Women with HF have less access to cardiologists, although this consultation is associated with better quality of care, particularly for women. Despite these known sex differences, recommendations for HF are the same for women and men, because prospective sex-specific clinical trials have not been performed.", 
    "66": "The present study explored the feasibility of a differential setup for the in situ perfusion technique with mesenteric cannulation in rats to assess drug interactions at the level of intestinal absorption. In contrast to the classic, parallel in situ perfusion setup, the differential approach aims to identify intestinal drug interactions in individual animals by exposing the perfused segment to a sequence of multiple conditions. First, the setup was validated by assessing the interaction between the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor verapamil and the transport probes atenolol (paracellular transport), propranolol (transcellular) and talinolol (P-gp mediated efflux). While transport of atenolol and propranolol remained constant for the total perfusion time (2 h), a verapamil-induced increase in talinolol transport was observed within individual rats (between 3.2- and 5.2-fold). In comparison with the parallel setup, the differential in situ perfusion approach enhances the power to detect drug interactions with compounds that exhibit strong subject-dependent permeability. This was demonstrated by identifying an interaction between amprenavir and ketoconazole (P-gp and CYP3A inhibitor) in five out of seven rats (permeability increase between 1.9- and 4.2-fold), despite high inter-individual differences in intrinsic permeability for amprenavir. In combination with an increased throughput (up to 300%) and a reduced animal use (up to 50%), the enhanced power of the differential approach improves the utility of the biorelevant in situ perfusion technique with mesenteric blood sampling to elucidate the intestinal interaction profile of drugs and drug candidates.",

This study was conducted to evaluate the effects and safety of combining nadolol with ligation. Cirrhotic patients with high-risk esophageal varices but without a bleeding history were considered for enrolment. Eligible patients were randomized to receive band ligation plus nadolol (Combined group, 70 patients) or nadolol alone (Nadolol group, 70 patients). In the Combined group multiligators were applied. Patients received regular ligation treatment at an interval of 4 weeks until variceal obliteration. Nadolol was administered at a dose to reduce 25% of the pulse rate in both the Combined group and the Nadolol group. Both groups were comparable in baseline data. In the Combined group 50 patients (71%) achieved variceal obliteration. The mean dose of nadolol was 52 +/- 16 mg in the Combined group and 56 +/- 19 mg in the Nadolol group. During a median follow-up of 26 months, 18 patients (26%) in the Combined group and 13 patients (18%) in the Nadolol group experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (P = NS).

    "77": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a frequent complication of cardiac surgery that increases patient morbidity, length of stay, and hospital costs. A substantial body of evidence exists evaluating various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods to decrease the occurrence of POAF in an effort to decrease its burden on the health care system. Evidence-based guidelines support the use of beta-blockers as standard prophylaxis of POAF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Traditional prophylactic therapy for POAF targets the sympathetic nervous system, refractory period, and atrial conduction. However, associations between the development of POAF and the inflammatory process, oxidative stress, and atrial remodeling have prompted the investigation of novel therapies targeting these processes. To evaluate the role of pharmacologic strategies beyond beta-blockers in the prevention of POAF, we conducted a search of the PubMed database to identify studies published from 1950-February 2009. Emphasis was placed on how these therapies could be used in patients intolerant to beta-blockers or as additive therapy in high-risk patients. We found that sufficient evidence exists to recommend the use of amiodarone, sotalol, and possibly magnesium as monotherapy in patients unable to take beta-blockers or as add-on therapy for the prevention of POAF. Currently, available evidence does not support the use of propafenone, procainamide, digoxin, thiazolidinediones, triiodothyronine, or calcium channel blockers in the prevention of POAF. Preliminary evidence suggests that dofetilide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, omega-3 fatty acids, ascorbic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and sodium nitroprusside may be effective in preventing POAF. Additional large-scale, adequately powered clinical studies are needed to determine the benefit of these agents before they can be considered for routine use.",

Significant and clinically meaningful treatment-time differences in the beneficial and/or adverse effects of at least six different classes of hypertension medications are now known. Generally, calcium channel blockers are more effective with bedtime than morning dosing, and in the case of dihydropyridine derivatives bedtime dosing significantly reduces the risk of edema. Scheduling angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at bedtime, as opposed to awakening, increases the proportion of patients with properly controlled BP, enhances the sleep-time relative BP decline towards a normal dipping pattern and best reduces urinary albumin excretion, a marker of functional renal status. The chronotherapy of conventional BP-lowering medications entails their correct scheduling with reference to the body's circadian rhythms, not only to achieve control of daytime and night-time systolic and diastolic BP but to normalize the dipping status of the 24 h pattern. Chronotherapy constitutes a cost-effective strategy for enhancing BP control during both nocturnal sleep and daytime activity and for potentially reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and end-organ injury of the blood vessels and tissue of the heart, brain, kidney, eye and other organs.",

Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in the CA1 region of the hippocampus from carvedilol- or vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide-treated slices, and differences in basal synaptic transmission and LTP were assessed. Carvedilol treatment produced a significant increase in basal synaptic transmission and LTP in TgCRND8 mice, as compared to their vehicle-treated slices, in which basal neuronal transmission and LTP decreased. Interestingly, carvedilol significantly suppressed spontaneous seizure activity in TgCRND8 mice as measured by the number of slices showing epileptic discharges as well as the number of spikes within these and the amplitude of the second spike, measured at baseline and end of recording. In contrast, vehicle-treated slices in TgCRND8 mice did not show a significant decrease in epileptic discharges.

The ability of the model to predict cardiac complications was assessed within a validation cohort of 1873. Significant predictors were converted to an integer score to create a practical cardiac risk prediction formula.", 
    "102": "The overall incidence of major cardiac events in the VSGNE cohort was 6.3% (2.5% MI, 3.9% arrhythmia, 1.8% CHF). The RCRI predicted risk after CEA reasonably well but substantially underestimated risk after LEB, EVAR, and OAAA for low- and higher-risk patients. Across all VSGNE patients, the RCRI underestimated cardiac complications by 1.7- to 7.4-fold based on actual event rates of 2.6%, 6.7%, 11.6%, and 18.4% for patients with 0, 1, 2, and >or=3 risk factors. In multivariate analysis of the VSGNE cohort, independent predictors of adverse cardiac events were (odds ratio [OR]) increasing age (1.7-2.8), smoking (1.3), insulin-dependent diabetes (1.4), coronary artery disease (1.4), CHF (1.9), abnormal cardiac stress test (1.2), long-term beta-blocker therapy (1.4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.6), and creatinine >or=1.8 mg/dL (1.7). Prior cardiac revascularization was protective (OR, 0.8). Our aggregate model was well calibrated (r = 0.99, P < .001), demonstrating moderate discriminative ability (ROC curve = 0.71), which differed only slightly from the procedure-specific models (ROC curves: CEA, 0.74; LEB, 0.72; EVAR, 0.74; OAAA, 0.68). Rates of cardiac complications for patients with 0 to 3, 4, 5, and >or=6 VSG risk factors were 3.1%, 5.0%, 6.8%, and 11.6% in the derivation cohort and 3.8%, 5.2%, 8.1%, and 10.1% in the validation cohort. The VSGNE cardiac risk model more accurately predicted the actual risk of cardiac complications across the four procedures for low- and higher-risk patients than the RCRI. When the VSG Cardiac Risk Index (VSG-CRI) was used to score patients, six categories of risk ranging from 2.6% to 14.3% (score of 0-3 to 8) were discernible.", 
    "103": "The RCRI substantially underestimates in-hospital cardiac events in patients undergoing elective or urgent vascular surgery, especially after LEB, EVAR, and OAAA. The VSG-CRI more accurately predicts in-hospital cardiac events after vascular surgery and represents an important tool for clinical decision making.",

The latter is an independent predictor of HF prognosis. beta-Blockers improve the prognosis of HF patients. We evaluated the effect on the efficiency of VE of a beta(1)-beta(2) unselective (carvedilol) versus a beta(1) selective (bisoprolol) beta-blocker.",

Data about reimbursed prescriptions of beta-blockers (BBs), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACE/ARBs) and statins for these patients was obtained from the database of the Estonian Health Insurance Fund. Data were mainly analysed using frequency tables and, where appropriate, the Pearson's chi2 test, the Mann-Whitney U-test and the t-test were used. A logistic regression method was used to investigate the relationship between drug allocation and age and gender. We presented drug utilization data as defined daily dosages (DDD) per life day in four age groups and described proportions of different combinations used in men and women.",

Of the 4025 inpatients who survived more than 30 days, 3799 (94.4%) were treated at least by the one of drug groups studied. Median daily dosages differed significantly between men and women in the age group 60-79 years for BBs and ACE/ARBs, respectively. Various combinations of the drugs studied were not allocated in equal proportions for men and women, although the same combinations were the most frequently used for both genders. The logistic regression analysis adjusted to gender and age revealed that some combinations of drugs were not allocated similarly in different age and gender groups.",

Only 40% of them were treated by combinations of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers and statins, which is inconsistent with guideline recommendations in Estonia. Standards of training and quality programs in Estonia should be reviewed and updated aiming to improve an adherence to guidelines of management of acute myocardial infarction in all age and gender groups.",

Here, we describe the case of a 58 year old woman with metastatic rectal carcinoma who developed severe gastrointestinal toxicity when the thus far well-tolerated intravenous 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin containing chemotherapeutic regimen was replaced by the same chemotherapeutic regimen in combination with the oral 5-FU prodrug capecitabine. This increased toxicity is probably due to the intracellular retention of polyglutamated folates induced by prior leucovorin therapy which, upon subsequent administration of capecitabine, will result in an enhanced and prolonged inhibition of the, for DNA synthesis important, enzyme thymidylate synthase, essentially creating a situation equivalent to overdosing.", 
    "113": "Infantile haemangiomas, common benign vascular tumours of childhood, are characterized by rapid growth during the first year of life and a slow regression that is usually completed at 7-10 years of age. These tumours are composed of endothelial cells with high mitotic rates and stromal components such as fibroblasts, mast cells and pericytes. Haemangiomas become a challenge when they are part of a syndrome, are located in certain areas of the body or when complications develop. The above-mentioned factors also influence the treatment modality used. However, although there remain many uncertainties regarding management, the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol is a promising new candidate for first-line systemic therapy. It produces such a dramatic and rapid response that the appearance of an infantile haemangioma should impart expeditious consideration of the risks and benefits of its use.", 
    "114": "One of the major problems of cancer chemotherapy is the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. Among the numerous mechanisms of MDR, a prominent one is the increased expression of membrane transporter proteins, the action of which leads to decreased intracellular drug concentration and cytotoxicity of drugs. Among them, P-gp and MRP1, encoded by MDR1 and MRP1 genes, respectively, have been associated with MDR phenotype. Chemical modulators can be used to reverse MDR. These chemicals can either modulate MDR due to their substrate analogy (such as calcium channel blocker verapamil) or interact with phospholipid membranes (such as antihistaminic drug promethazine). This study focuses on the effect of verapamil and promethazine on the expression levels of MDR1 and MRP1 genes and the drug transport activity in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line.", 
    "115": "Doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/Dox) cells were incubated with either verapamil or promethazine, and total RNA was isolated.

Intracellular doxorubicin accumulation was also examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy in treated cells.", 
    "116": "Results demonstrated a significant decrease in both MDR1 and MRP1 expression levels after promethazine applications. It has also been shown that treatment of the cells with verapamil results in significant decrease in MDR1 mRNA levels. Confocal laser scanning microscopy images demonstrated that the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin was increased after verapamil treatment in MCF-7/Dox cells.",

    "121": "The clinical and demographic characteristics were similar in the two groups at baseline. Individualized propranolol dose adjustment ensured a similar degree of beta-blockade, as assessed by resting heart rate and chronotropic reserve. The mean propranolol dose used was 109 +/- 43 mg/day. Only one patient presented with intolerance to propranolol, thus carvedilol was reintroduced. One death was recorded in group propranolol. Ejection fraction significantly increased in the propranolol group. No significant change was observed in the other cardiovascular variables after betablocker replacement.",

Conventional methods for HRV analysis in rats rely on conscious state electrocardiogram (ECG) recording based on prior invasive surgical procedures for electrodes/transmitters implants. The aim of the present study was to test a noninvasive and inexpensive method for ECG recording in conscious rats, assessing its feasibility for HRV analysis. A custom-made elastic cotton jacket was developed to fit the rat's mean thoracic circumference, with two pieces of platinum electrodes attached on its inner surface, allowing ECG to be recorded noninvasively in conscious, restrained rats (n=6). Time- and frequency-domain HRV analyses were conducted, under basal and autonomic blockade conditions. High-quality ECG signals were obtained, being feasible for HRV analysis. As expected, mean RR interval was significantly decreased in the presence of atropine (p <0.05) and increased in the presence of propranolol (p<0.001). Also, reinforcing the reliability of the method, low- and high-frequency HRV spectral powers were significantly decreased in the presence of propranolol (p <0.05) and atropine (p< 0.001), respectively. In summary, the present work describes a novel, inexpensive and noninvasive method for surface ECG recording in conscious rats.", 
    "124": "Recently, an intravenous formulation of sotalol has been approved by the food and drug administration for substitution for oral therapy in patients who are unable to take oral sotalol. The purpose of this randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, crossover study was to develop a safe dosing regimen for intravenous sotalol that provides similar blood levels and therefore similar efficacy and safety to orally administered sotalol. Fifteen healthy subjects received 75 mg intravenous sotalol infusion administered over 2.5 hours and 80 mg oral sotalol. Standard pharmacokinetic methods were used to obtain maximum serum concentrations (Cmax) and areas under the concentration-time curves (AUC). Individual pharmacokinetic parameters were used in simulation studies to determine the optimal intravenous administration regimen. Intravenous sotalol administered over 2.5 hours resulted in a significantly greater Cmax than oral administration (830 +/- 391 vs. 601 +/- 289 ng/mL, P < 0.001). With increasing the length of infusions to 3, 4, and 5 hours, simulation studies showed that the Cmax decreased to 128%, 113%, and 102% of the oral Cmax. The length of infusion did not affect AUC. Based on these studies, a safe intravenous regimen for the replacement of 80-mg oral therapy requires 75 mg intravenous sotalol administered as a 5-hour infusion. Because the pharmacokinetics of sotalol are linear and dose proportional, 150 mg intravenous sotalol administered over 5 hours will provide similar Cmax and AUC as 160 mg oral sotalol. The food and drug administration-approved dosing regimen is 75 mg intravenous sotalol to replace 80 mg oral sotalol and 150 mg intravenous sotalol to replace 160 mg oral sotalol, both administered over 5 hours.", 
    "125": "A close interaction between adrenergic nerves and angiotensin systems has been documented. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanisms of angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) suppression of beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Chronic isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy was inhibited in wild-type mice and AT1aR(-/-) mice treated with the ARB Candesartan (CV11974). Acute ISO-induced increase in phosphorylation levels of ERK MAPK was completely inhibited and increases in phosphorylation levels of p38 and JNK MAPKs were partially suppressed in both types of mice. Analysis of the activity of the small GTPase-regulating protein Raf indicated that the mechanisms by which ARB inhibits the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway under beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation basically depended on changes in the binding activities of Ras (stimulatory to Raf cascade) and Rap-1 (inhibitory to Raf cascade). Binding activities of Ras and Rap-1 in the heart were markedly augmented by ISO, whereas ARB suppressed only Ras, but not Rap-1, binding activity. Raf immunoprecipitation results confirmed that ISO-induced increases in its association with total and phosphorylated forms of MEK were completely normalized by ARB. These results might provide a molecular basis for the beneficial effects of AT1-receptor antagonists on cardiac remodeling and functions in patients with sympatho-excitatory heart failure.",

The study population was divided into 2 groups according to the median baseline (65.9 ml/min) of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. eGFR significantly decreased in the higher eGFR group (P=0.04), but did not in the lower eGFR group. Left ventricular ejection fraction significantly increased in both groups with lower eGFR (P=0.01) and higher eGFR (P<0.01). There was an interaction between plasma norepinephrine concentration and eGFR in terms of beta-blocker treatment (P=0.02, ANOVA). eGFR significantly decreased in patients who received metoprolol (from 75.7+/-33.5 to 59.5+/-20.0 mlxmin(-1).1.73 m(-2), P<0.01), but did not change in those who received carvedilol (from 67.1+/-27.7 mlxmin(-1).1.73 m(-2) to 65.6+/-23.2 mlxmin(-1).1.73 m(-2)).",

TJ0711 hydrochloride and verapamil hydrochloride (the internal standard) were separated on Knauer Eurospher C(18) (250 mm x 4.0 mm i.d., 5 microm) column at 50 degrees C. The mobile phase was methanol:perchloric acid (12 nM, aq) (56:44, v:v), with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The wavelengths of FD were set at 246 nm for excitation and 300 nm for emission. For plasma samples of rats, the analytes were extracted with acetic ether from alkalinized plasma, and then back-extracted into 10 mM dilute sulfuric acid. The linearity was over a concentration range of 20-10,000 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precisions referred by relative standard deviation were less than 2.0% and 4.3%, respectively. The mean analytical recoveries of TJ0711 hydrochloride at different concentrations (50, 1000 and 8000 ng/mL) ranged from 88.3% to 92.9%. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 20 ng/mL.

To illustrate the utility of coupling a separation with this direct liquid extraction based surface sampling approach, four different organs (brain, lung, kidney, and liver) from whole-body thin tissue sections of propranolol dosed and control mice were examined. The parent drug was observed in the chromatograms of the surface sampling extracts from all the organs of the dosed mouse examined. In addition, two isomeric phase II metabolites of propranolol (an aliphatic and an aromatic hydroxypropranolol glucuronide) were observed in the chromatograms of the extracts from lung, kidney, and liver. Confirming the presence of one or the other or both of these glucuronides in the extract from the various organs was not possible without the separation. These drug and metabolite data obtained using the LMJ surface sampling/HPLC-MS method and the results achieved by analyzing similar samples by conventional extraction of the tissues and subsequent HPLC-MS analysis were consistent. The ability to directly and efficiently sample from thin tissue sections via a liquid extraction and then perform a subsequent liquid phase separation increases the utility of this liquid extraction surface sampling approach.",

Other control and TP hearts were perfused with either sotalol (\u03b2-adrenergic blocker) or H-89 (PKA inhibitor). Some hearts were pre-treated with either isoproterenol (\u03b2-adrenergic agonist) or adenosine (PKC activator) that were given alone, simultaneously, or sequentially. Pre-treatment with isoproterenol, adenosine, and the consecutive isoproterenol/adenosine treatment was also combined with the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine. Cardioprotection was evaluated by haemodynamic function recovery, lactate dehydrogenase release, measurement of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, and protein carbonylation during reperfusion. Cyclic AMP and PKA activity were increased in TP hearts. H-89 and sotalol blocked the cardioprotective effect of TP and TP-induced PKC activation. Isoproterenol, adenosine, and the consecutive treatment increased PKC activity during pre-ischaemia. Isoproterenol significantly reduced myocardial glycogen content. Isoproterenol and adenosine, alone or simultaneously, protected hearts but the consecutive treatment gave the highest protection. Cardioprotective effects of adenosine were completely blocked by chelerythrine but those of the consecutive treatment only attenuated.",

    "142": "Aversive olfactory learning was established in young rats after odor exposure paired with foot shock through a classical conditioning paradigm. Using behavioral pharmacology and Western blotting, we previously reported that plasticity in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) underlies aversive olfactory learning. Since long-term potentiation (LTP) observed in the hippocampus is believed to be a cellular substrate for aspects of memory, we attempted to induce LTP in the MOB. Using brain slices containing the MOB, we found that five tetani of the lateral olfactory tract evoked LTP that was blocked by the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist AP5. Although three tetani induced no significant changes in control slices, with noradrenaline (NA) application they produced clear LTP (NA-mediated LTP), which was not dependent on NMDA receptors. NA's facilitating effect on LTP induction was blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist timolol but not by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine, and was mimicked by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol. The l-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine completely blocked LTP as well as NA-mediated LTP. In addition, we found that aversive olfactory learning was impaired by beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, timolol but not by alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine, and only odor training established olfactory learning by isoproterenol infusion. Moreover, we found that nifedipine but not AP5 prevented olfactory learning formation. These common properties provided evidence for neural correlates between NA-mediated LTP aversive olfactory learning in young rats.", 
    "143": "Star-shaped poly(epsilon-caprolactone) oligomers functionalized with succinic anhydride were used as prepolymers to prepare photocrosslinked poly(ester anhydride) to evaluate their in vivo drug delivery functionality and biocompatibility. Thus, in this work, erosion, drug release and safety of the photocrosslinked poly(ester anhydride) were examined in vitro and in vivo. A small water-soluble drug, propranolol HCl (M(w) 296 g/mol, solubility 50 mg/ml), was used as the model drug in an evaluation of the erosion controlled release. Drug-free and drug-loaded (10-60% w/w) poly(ester anhydride) discoids eroded in vitro (pH 7.4 buffer, +37 degrees C) linearly within 24-48 h. A strong correlation between the polymer erosion and the linear drug release in vitro was observed, indicating that the release had been controlled by the erosion of the polymer. Similarly, in vivo studies (s.c. implantation of discoids in rats) indicated that surface erosion controlled drug release from the discoids (drug loading 40% w/w). Oligomers did not decrease cell viability in vitro and the implanted discoids (s.c., rats) did not evoke any cytokine activity in vivo. In summary, surface erosion controlled drug release and the safety of photocrosslinked poly(ester anhydride) were demonstrated in this study.",

We report three cases of subglottic hemangioma treated with the cardioselective beta-blocker acebutolol, 8 mg/kg/day. Treatment was efficient in two cases while an open procedure was necessary in the third child. In our experience, acebutolol could be easily administered in oral form twice-a-day only with a dose that was adaptable according to the growth of the child and showed no side effects. We also report a case of rebound growth after beta-mimetic drug use and the efficiency of propranolol treatment in such a recurrence. Considering the lack of side effects and the advantages in terms of administration, we suggest acebutolol as a first-line treatment of subglottic hemangiomas for which intervention is required.", 
    "145": "The Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) guidance issued by the FDA allows waivers for in vivo bioavailability and bioequivalence studies for immediate-release (IR) solid oral dosage forms only for BCS class I drugs. However, a number of drugs within BCS class III have been proposed to be eligible for biowaivers. The World Health Organization (WHO) has shortened the requisite dissolution time of BCS class III drugs on their Essential Medicine List (EML) from 30 to 15 min for extended biowaivers; however, the impact of the shorter dissolution time on AUC(0-inf) and C(max) is unknown. The objectives of this investigation were to assess the ability of gastrointestinal simulation software to predict the oral absorption of the BCS class I drugs propranolol and metoprolol and the BCS class III drugs cimetidine, atenolol, and amoxicillin, and to perform in silico bioequivalence studies to assess the feasibility of extending biowaivers to BCS class III drugs. The drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract was predicted using physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of test drugs provided by GastroPlus (version 6.0). Virtual trials with a 200 mL dose volume at different drug release rates (T(85%) = 15 to 180 min) were performed to predict the oral absorption (C(max) and AUC(0-inf)) of the above drugs. Both BCS class I drugs satisfied bioequivalence with regard to the release rates up to 120 min. The results with BCS class III drugs demonstrated bioequivalence using the prolonged release rate, T(85%) = 45 or 60 min, indicating that the dissolution standard for bioequivalence is dependent on the intestinal membrane permeability and permeability profile throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The results of GastroPlus simulations indicate that the dissolution rate of BCS class III drugs could be prolonged to the point where dissolution, rather than permeability, would control the overall absorption. For BCS class III drugs with intestinal absorption patterns similar to those of cimetidine, atenolol or amoxicillin, the dissolution criteria for extension of biowaivers to BCS class III drugs warrants further investigation.",

    "162": "Over the course of more than a century, visible T-wave alternans (TWA), defined as a beat-to-beat alternation in the morphology and amplitude of the ST segment or T wave, has been observed to occur in close association with life-threatening arrhythmias in patients with acute myocardial ischemia and infarction, heart failure, Prinzmetal's angina, and channelopathies, including Brugada and long QT syndromes. Over 100 studies enrolling a total of more than 12,000 patients support the predictivity of TWA testing for cardiovascular mortality and sudden cardiac death during both exercise and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring. To date, the main intended application has been to aid decision-making for cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. The prospect that TWA could be used to guide pharmacologic therapy has not received adequate attention. The literature supporting the utility of TWA as a therapeutic marker of antiarrhythmic effects and proarrhythmia is reviewed for each of the major antiarrhythmic drug classes. Beta-adrenergic and sodium channel blocking agents are the most widely studied drug classes in clinical TWA investigations, which report reductions in TWA magnitude. Patients with Brugada syndrome constitute a significant exception, because sodium channel blockade provokes the diagnostic electrocardiogram changes as well as macroscopic TWA. Calcium channel blockers have undergone extensive research in several animal models, but, surprisingly, no clinical studies on TWA with this class of drugs have been performed. Interestingly, TWA may help to detect the beneficial effects of nonantiarrhythmic agents such as the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan, which exert their protective effects through putative indirect actions on myocardial remodeling. There is also suggestive evidence that the proarrhythmic effects associated with cardiovascular and noncardiovascular agents may be disclosed by elevated levels of TWA. Thus, the emerging collective evidence indicates the broad utility of TWA in estimating antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic effects of diverse agents across differing pathologies. We conclude that quantitative analysis of TWA has considerable potential to guide pharmacologic therapy.", 
    "163": "Dietary methionine restriction (MR) limits fat deposition and decreases plasma leptin, while increasing food consumption, total energy expenditure (EE), plasma adiponectin, and expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown and white adipose tissue (BAT and WAT). beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) serve as conduits for sympathetic input to adipose tissue, but their role in mediating the effects of MR on energy homeostasis is unclear. Energy intake, weight, and adiposity were modestly higher in beta(3)-AR(-/-) mice on the Control diet compared with wild-type (WT) mice, but the hyperphagic response to the MR diet and the reduction in fat deposition did not differ between the genotypes. The absence of beta(3)-ARs also did not diminish the ability of MR to increase total EE and plasma adiponectin or decrease leptin mRNA, but it did block the MR-dependent increase in UCP1 mRNA in BAT but not WAT. In a further study, propranolol was used to antagonize remaining beta-adrenergic input (beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs) in beta(3)-AR(-/-) mice, and this treatment blocked >50% of the MR-induced increase in total EE and UCP1 induction in both BAT and WAT. We conclude that signaling through beta-adrenergic receptors is a component of the mechanism used by dietary MR to increase EE, and that beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs are able to substitute for beta(3)-ARs in mediating the effect of dietary MR on EE. These findings are consistent with the involvement of both UCP1-dependent and -independent mechanisms in the physiological responses affecting energy balance that are produced by dietary MR.", 
    "164": "Endocytosis modulates EGFR function by compartmentalizing and attenuating or enhancing its ligand-induced signaling. Here we show that it can also control the cell surface versus intracellular distribution of empty/inactive EGFR. Our previous observation that PKA inhibitors induce EGFR internalization prompted us to test phosphatidic acid (PA) generated by phospholipase D (PLD) as an endogenous down-regulator of PKA activity, which activates rolipram-sensitive type 4 phosphodiesterases (PDE4) that degrade cAMP. We found that inhibition of PA hydrolysis by propranolol, in the absence of ligand, provokes internalization of inactive (neither tyrosine-phosphorylated nor ubiquitinated) EGFR, accompanied by a transient increase in PA levels and PDE4s activity. This EGFR internalization is mimicked by PA micelles and is strongly counteracted by PLD2 silencing, rolipram or forskolin treatment, and PKA overexpression. Accelerated EGFR endocytosis seems to be mediated by clathrin-dependent and -independent pathways, leading to receptor accumulation in juxtanuclear recycling endosomes, also due to a decreased recycling. Internalized EGFR can remain intracellular without degradation for several hours or return rapidly to the cell surface upon discontinuation of the stimulus. This novel regulatory mechanism of EGFR, also novel function of signaling PA, can transmodulate receptor accessibility in response to heterologous stimuli.",

In this study, Baltic Sea blue mussels, Mytilus edulis trossulus, were exposed to diclofenac, ibuprofen and propranolol, three pharmaceuticals that are produced and sold in large quantities and have a widespread occurrence in aquatic environments. The mussels were exposed to pharmaceuticals in concentrations ranging from 1 to 10,000 microg l(-1). The pharmaceuticals were added both separately and in combination. Mussels exposed to high concentrations of pharmaceuticals showed a clear response compared to controls. Firstly, they had a significantly lower scope for growth, which indicates that the organisms had a smaller part of their energy available for normal metabolism, and secondly, they had lower byssus strength and lower abundance of byssus threads, resulting in reduced ability to attach to the underlying substrate. Mussels exposed to lower concentrations showed tendencies of the same results. The concentration of diclofenac and propranolol was quantified in the mussels using both liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The measurements showed a significantly higher concentration in the organisms as compared to the water the mussels were exposed to; the uptake reached concentrations two orders of magnitudes higher than found in sewage treatment plant effluents.

In rats, a validated approach to QT correction is lacking. In this study, we tested the normalization of QTc using normalization factor according to rat's cardiac cycle length (RR). Standard 12-lead ECG was measured in anesthetized rats at basal conditions and at various pharmacological conditions such as beta-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol or medication with clarithromycin (single- or repeated dosing for seven days), bisoprolol or ivabradine. For QT correction, standard Bazett's formula (QTc-B=QT/(RR)(1/2)) and Bazett's formula normalized to average rat RR (QTc(n)-B=QT/(RR/f)(1/2), f=150ms) were compared. Duration of QT showed a positive correlation with RR duration (Pearson r=0.7645, P<0.001). Calculated QTc-B gave 2-2.5 fold of values of uncorrected QT, whereas values of normalized QTc(n)-B were in the physiological range. QTc(n)-B was unrelated to RR (Pearson r=0.1122, not significant) but the relationship between QTc(n)-B and QT remained preserved (Pearson r=0.7216, P<0.001). Both single and repeated administration of clarithromycin prolonged QT as compared to the controls but a significant dose-dependent difference between clarithromycin applications was revealed only when QTc(n)-B was used. Beta-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol prolonged, while beta-blockade with bisoprolol shortened QTc(n)-B. Ivabradine dose-dependently induced bradycardia without altering QT. However, QTc(n)-B showed false positive shortening at sustained bradycardia. Therefore, adjusted formula for QTc(n)-B is suitable for QT correction in rats but its use should be considered carefully in case of very low heart rate.",

    "204": "Consecutive patients with NCPH with a history of variceal bleeding in the past 6 weeks were assigned randomly to groups treated every 3 weeks with EVL (n = 51) or propranolol (until they had a resting heart rate of 55 beats per minute or to a maximum of 320 mg/day; n = 50). Primary end points were recurrence of variceal bleeding or death. Secondary end points were complications of EVL in patients given EVL, variceal eradication after EVL, variceal recurrence after EVL, or a decrease in variceal grade in patients given propranolol.", 
    "205": "After a median follow-up period of 23 months, rates of recurrence of bleeding were similar between the groups (EVL, 23.5%; propranolol, 18%; P = .625). The actuarial probability of remaining free of bleeding recurrence was similar between the groups. No deaths occurred in either group. Of the patients given propranolol, 47% had a decrease in the grade of varices and none experienced bleeding. Adverse events were minor and comparable between groups (EVL, 12%; propranolol, 18%; P = .635).", 
    "206": "EVL was not more effective than the \u03b2-blocker propranolol for the secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in patients with NCPH.", 
    "207": "The aim of this study is to investigate whether variation in mortality at hospital level reflects differences in quality of care of peripheral vascular surgery patients.", 
    "208": "Observational study.", 
    "209": "In 11 hospitals in the Netherlands, 711 consecutive vascular surgery patients were enrolled.", 
    "210": "Multilevel logistic regression models were used to relate patient characteristics, structure and process of care to mortality at 1 year. The models were constructed by consecutively adding age, sex and Lee index, then remaining risk factors, followed by structural measures for quality of care and finally, selected process of care parameters.", 
    "211": "Total 1-year mortality was 11%, ranging from 6% to 26% in different hospitals. Large differences in patient characteristics and quality indicators were observed between hospitals (e.g., age>70 years: 28-58%; beta-blocker therapy: 39-87%). Adjusted analyses showed that a large part of variation in mortality was explained by age, sex and the Lee index (Akaike's information criterion (AIC)=59, p<0.001). Another substantial part of the variation was explained by process of care (AIC=5, p=0.001).", 
    "212": "Differences between hospitals exist in patient characteristics, structure of care, process of care and mortality. Even after adjusting for the patient population at risk, a substantial part of the variation in mortality can be explained by differences in process measures of quality of care.", 
    "213": "Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) formed from l-cysteine by multiple enzymes including cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) is now considered a gasotransmitter in the mammalian body. Our previous studies have shown that H(2)S activates/sensitizes Ca(v)3.2 T-type Ca(2+) channels, leading to facilitation of somatic and visceral nociception, and that CSE-derived endogenous H(2)S participates in inflammatory pain. Here, we show novel evidence for involvement of the endogenous H(2)S-Ca(v)3.2 pathway in neuropathic pain. In the rat subjected to the right L5 spinal nerve cutting (L5SNC), a neuropathic pain model, i.p. administration of dl-propargylglycine (PPG) and beta-cyanoalanine, irreversible and reversible CSE inhibitors, respectively, strongly suppressed the neuropathic hyperalgesia/allodynia. The anti-hyperalgesic effect of PPG was reversed by intraplantar administration of NaHS, a donor for H(2)S, in the L5SNC rat. Intraplantar administration or topical application of mibefradil, a T-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, reversed hyperalgesia in the L5SNC rat. The protein levels of Ca(v)3.2, but not CSE, in the ipsilateral L4, L5 and L6 dorsal root ganglia were dramatically upregulated in the L5SNC rat. Finally, silencing of Ca(v)3.2 in DRG by repeated intrathecal administration of Ca(v)3.2-targeting siRNA significantly attenuated the neuropathic hyperalgesia in the L5SNC rat. In conclusion, our data suggest that Ca(v)3.2 T-type Ca(2+) channels in sensory neurons are upregulated and activated/sensitized by CSE-derived endogenous H(2)S after spinal nerve injury, contributing to the maintenance of neuropathic pain. We thus propose that Ca(v)3.2 and CSE could be targets for the development of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of neuropathic pain.", 
    "214": "Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established treatment option for symptomatic chronic heart failure (CHF) patients with pharmacological baseline therapy, but not all patients benefit from device therapy. One reason for this may be inadequate device settings. In real-world practice, echocardiographic evaluation of atrioventricular (AV) delay is not performed in a high proportion of patients, as the effect of electrical optimization of CRT is an issue open for investigation.", 
    "215": "We performed a retrospective observational study analysing the effect of AV-interval evaluation with echocardiography on long-term [32 (23?43) months] clinical outcome in 205 CHF patients. A stepwise Cox regression model including a co-morbidity score, failed AV-interval evaluation, satisfactory device function after the first implantation attempt, failure to reach 100% of the recommended renin-angiotensin system inhibitor and beta-blocker dose at follow-up and CRT device implantation compared with CRT in combination with an implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was applied.", 
    "216": "In the total study cohort, 124 (60.5%) patients had reached the primary combined endpoint death or cardiac hospitalization and 59 (28.8%) had died. Cox regression analysis revealed that failed AV-interval evaluation [HR = 1.72 (1.19-2.49), P = 0.004] non-optimized CHF pharmacotherapy dosages [HR = 2.12 (1.32-3.42), P = 0.002], the presence of a CRT/ICD combination device [HR = 1.87 (1.28-2.71), P = 0.001] and satisfactory device function after the first implantation attempt [HR = 0.44 (0.25-0.77), P = 0.004] were associated with the primary endpoint.", 
    "217": "Echocardiographic evaluation of the AV-interval in patients with CRT was independently associated with improved clinical outcome, impacting on daily clinical practice of HF patient care.", 
    "218": "Development of intraventricular gradients (IVG) on exertion seldom occurs in an unselected population. We performed exercise stress echocardiography (SE) in a 23-year-old athlete with a positive treadmill ECG and normal resting echocardiogram, but without angiographically demonstrable coronary disease (cardiac syndrome X), during which he developed an IVG of 102 mmHg and systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve. Subsequently, we performed SE in 91 patients, 44 of whom were women, mean age 51.4 +/- 12.1 years (20-72), under similar circumstances--positive treadmill testing and no angiographically demonstrable coronary disease. In 33 (36%) of these, SE disclosed IVG with a mean end-systolic peak of 86 +/- 34 mmHg (30-165), together with mitral valve SAM in 23. The 20 patients who repeated SE under beta-blocker therapy constitute the study population. Seven (35%) of them were women, mean age 50.7 +/- 13.4 years (23 to 72).", 
    "219": "To assess the effect of beta-blockers on the occurrence of IVG and mitral valve SAM in patients with cardiac syndrome X.", 
    "220": "We repeated SE in 20 of the 33 patient that developed IVG on exertion, under beta-blocker therapy. They all underwent 2D and Doppler echocardiographic assessment before, during and after treadmill exercise.", 
    "221": "Mean IVG in the 20 patients in the study population was 971 +/- 31 mmHg on the first SE assessment. In the assessment performed under beta-blocker therapy, 11 did not develop IVG, and in 9 the gradient was significantly reduced, to a mean of 46 +/- 13 mmHg. Mean heart rate at peak exercise was 161 +/- 17 bpm in the first SE assessment and 143 +/- 12 bpm under treatment with beta-blockers (p < 0.0001). Fifteen of these patients showed clinical improvement during follow-up, while no change in clinical status was seen in the other five.", 
    "222": "In patients with cardiac syndrome X and IVG on exertion, treatment with oral beta-blockers prevented the occurrence of IVG or significantly reduced their magnitude. These changes were associated with significant reduction in heart rate at peak exercise and with clinical improvement in 75% of the study population.", 
    "223": "Building reliable structural models of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a difficult task because of the paucity of suitable templates, low sequence identity, and the wide variety of ligand specificities within the superfamily. Template-based modeling is known to be the most successful method for protein structure prediction. However, refinement of homology models within 1-3 A C alpha RMSD of the native structure remains a major challenge. Here, we address this problem by developing a novel protocol (foldGPCR) for modeling the transmembrane (TM) region of GPCRs in complex with a ligand, aimed to accurately model the structural divergence between the template and target in the TM helices. The protocol is based on predicted conserved inter-residue contacts between the template and target, and exploits an all-atom implicit membrane force field. The placement of the ligand in the binding pocket is guided by biochemical data. The foldGPCR protocol is implemented by a stepwise hierarchical approach, in which the TM helical bundle and the ligand are assembled by simulated annealing trials in the first step, and the receptor-ligand complex is refined with replica exchange sampling in the second step. The protocol is applied to model the human beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) bound to carazolol, using contacts derived from the template structure of bovine rhodopsin. Comparison with the X-ray crystal structure of the beta(2)AR shows that our protocol is particularly successful in accurately capturing helix backbone irregularities and helix-helix packing interactions that distinguish rhodopsin from beta(2)AR."
