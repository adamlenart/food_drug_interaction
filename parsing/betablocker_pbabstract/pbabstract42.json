Separation and determination of the analytes were performed on a Pinnacle II Cyano column as the stationary phase using the mobile phase consisted of aqueous solution (4.15\u00d710(-2) mol/L sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.02 mol/L sodium dihydrogen phosphate) with 10% (v/v) of 1-propanol at pH 7.0. This method was validated by linearity, lower limit of quantification, extraction recovery, stability, precision, and accuracy. The main analytical parameters were linearity (r>0.9950), intra- and inter-day precisions (intra-day RSD 2.2-3.5%, and inter-day RSD 3.7-9.5%), lower limit of quantification (20 ng mL(-1) for isosorbide mononitrate, metoprolol tartrate and diltiazem hydrochloride). The extraction recovery was 63.3% (0.1 \u03bcg/mL), 65.6% (1.0 \u03bcg/mL), and 69.5% (25 \u03bcg/mL) for isosorbide mononitrate; 65.1% (0.1 \u03bcg/mL), 69.5% (1.0 \u03bcg mL) and 73.5% (2.5 \u03bcg/mL) for metoprolol tartrate; 67.1% (0.1 \u03bcg/mL), 68.8% (1.0 \u03bcg/mL) and 73.8 % (2.5 \u03bcg/mL) for diltiazem hydrochloride.

Aside from the DECREASE trials, all other RCTs initiated beta blockade within 1 day or less prior to surgery. Among RCTs, beta blockade decreased nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (RR: 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58 to 0.82) but increased nonfatal stroke (RR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.91), hypotension (RR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.34 to 1.60), and bradycardia (RR: 2.61; 95% CI: 2.18 to 3.12). These findings were qualitatively unchanged after the DECREASE and POISE-1 trials were excluded. Effects on mortality rate differed significantly between the DECREASE trials and other trials. Beta blockers were associated with a trend toward reduced all-cause mortality rate in the DECREASE trials (RR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.15 to 1.22) but with increased all-cause mortality rate in other trials (RR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.64).

    "16": "Atrial anti-arrhythmic effects of \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists (\u03b2-blockers) may involve both a suppression of pro-arrhythmic effects of catecholamines, and an adaptational electrophysiological response to chronic \u03b2-blocker use; so-called 'pharmacological remodelling'. In human atrium, such remodelling decreases the transient outward (Ito) and inward rectifier (IK1) K(+) currents, and increases the cellular action potential duration (APD) and effective refractory period (ERP). However, the consequences of these changes on mechanisms of genesis and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF) are unknown. Using mathematical modelling, we tested the hypothesis that the long-term adaptational decrease in human atrial Ito and IK1 caused by chronic \u03b2-blocker therapy, i.e. independent of acute electrophysiological effects of \u03b2-blockers, in an otherwise un-remodelled atrium, could suppress AF.",

Chronic \u03b2-blockade remodelling prolonged atrial cell APD and ERP. The incidence of small amplitude APD alternans in the CRN model was reduced. At the 1D tissue level, \u03b2-blocker remodelling decreased the maximum pacing rate at which APs could be conducted. At the three-dimensional organ level, \u03b2-blocker remodelling reduced the life span of re-entry scroll waves.",

Over a mean follow-up of 16 months, 101 patients (21.6%) permanently discontinued dabigatran. The mean time-to-discontinuation was 8 months. The most common reason for discontinuation was dyspepsia (30.7%), followed by other adverse events (17.8%) such as minor bleeding (8.9%), major gastrointestinal bleeding (7.9%), and intracranial hemorrhage (1%). Other reasons included dosing frequency (5.9%), fear of side effects (4.0%), lack of laboratory monitoring (1.0%), and cost (1.0%). Multivariable analysis revealed that low baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (p = 0.02), absence of hypertension (p = 0.01), and prior use of a proton-pump inhibitor (p = 0.02) and H2-receptor blocker (p = 0.01) were independent predictors of drug discontinuation.

We hypothesized that the pharmacological disruption of memories activated during reconsolidation might reverse established stress-induced increases in depression-like behaviors and cocaine reward. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to repeated social defeat stress (SDS), and examined for time spent immobile in a subsequent forced swim test (FST). An additional set of SDS-exposed mice were place-conditioned with cocaine, and tested for cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP). All stress-exposed mice were then subjected to a single additional trial of SDS while under the influence of propranolol or cycloheximide to disrupt memory reconsolidation, then given one additional FST or CPP test the next day. Mice subjected to repeated SDS subsequently demonstrated increases in time spent immobile in the FST or in the cocaine-paired chamber. Vehicle-treatment followed by additional SDS exposure did not alter these behaviors, but propranolol or cycloheximide treatment reversed each of the potentiated responses in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, these results demonstrate that while repeated exposure to a social defeat stressor subsequently increased depression-like behavior and cocaine-CPP, disruption of traumatic memories made labile by re-exposure to SDS during reconsolidation may have therapeutic value in the treatment of established post-traumatic stress disorder-related behaviors.",

    "31": "The regulation of metabolism of glucose is billions years older than system of insulin and biological function of locomotion (function of motion). Hence hypoglycemic effect of hormone is mediated by alteration of metabolism of fatty acids. The insulin in physiological way deprives mitochondrions a possibility to metabolize ketone bodies, short chain, medium chain and long chain fatty acids and 'forces\" them to oxidize glucose which phylogenetically is not an optimal substrate. The relationships between fatty acids and glucose in the Rendle cycle have an effect only on autocrine level (in cell) determining alternation of biological reactions of exotrophia (after food intake) and endotrophia (beyond food intake) in biological function of alimentation (trophology). The most anti-diabetic pharmaceuticals are as insulin hyperlipemic by their mechanism of action. The decrease content of lipid substrates of oxidation in cytosol of cells and mitochondrions \"are forced\" to oxidize glucose. In these conditions, insulin enhances absorption of glucose by cells through glucose carriers--GLUT4. The derivatives of sulfonil-urea increase secretion of insulin by beta-cells of islets. The biguanidines bond in cytosol covalently and irreversibly ketone bodies taking them away from oxidation in mitochondrions. The fibrates, glitazones, flavonoids and flavones, lipoic tio-fatty acids. The endogenous eicosanoids, derivatives omega-3 and omega-6 of essential polyolefinic fatty acids and conjugated unsaturated fatty acids are the antagonists of receptors of activation of proliferation of peroxisomes. In peroxisomes, they enhance alpha-, beta- and omega-oxidation of all exogenous a physiological fatty acids and excess of palmitic saturated fatty acid forming hypolipidemia in cytozol. The hypolipidemic pharmaceuticals with effect of beta-blocker of oxidation stop absorption of fatty acids by mitochondrions. The omega-3 essential polvolefinic fatty acids, simultaneously with hypolipidemic effect, activate function of GLUT4. In patients of middle age, the diabetes mellitus type II is a symptom of syndrome of atherosclerosis. The reason is that in cells the deficiency of essential polyolefinic fatty acids and is determined by derangement of synthesis of phospholipids and function of GLUT4. It is valid to consider diabetes mellitus primarily as a pathology of metabolism of fatty acids and secondly as a pathology of content of glucose. It is necessary to take into account both under treatment (tactic activities) and strategic program of prevention of diabetes mellitus in population.",

The chickens were randomly allocated to 4 treatment groups with 8 replicates in each group. A cannula was surgically implanted into the lateral ventricle of the brain. In experiment 1, chickens received the \u03b21 adrenergic receptor antagonist (24 nmol) before injection of the ghrelin (0.6 nmol). In experiment 2, chickens received the \u03b22 adrenergic receptor antagonist (5 nmol) before injection of the ghrelin (0.6 nmol). In experiment 3, birds were injected with ghrelin (0.6 nmol) after the \u03b23 adrenergic receptor antagonist (20 nmol). Cumulative food and water intake were recorded 3-h post injection and analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. According to the results, ghrelin injection reduced food and water intake by broiler cockerels (p\u22640.05). The effect of ghrelin on food intake was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with the \u03b22 receptor antagonist (p\u22640.05). Furthermore, the \u03b22 receptor antagonist had no effect on water intake induced by ghrelin. Also, pretreatment with the \u03b21 and \u03b23 receptors antagonists had no effect on ghrelin-induced food and water intake. These results suggest that the effect of ghrelin on cumulative food intake by cockerels is mediated via \u03b22 adrenergic receptors.",

However, in vivo proofs of the functional effects of B2R-\u03b22AR heterodimerisation are missing. Both BK and adrenergic stimulation are known inducers of tPA release. Our goal was to demonstrate the existence of B2R-\u03b22AR heterodimerisation in myocardium and to define its functional effect on cardiac release of tPA in vivo. We further investigated the effects of a non-selective \u03b2-blocker on this receptor interplay. To investigate functional effects of B2R-\u03b22AR heterodimerisation (i.\u2009e. BK transactivation of \u03b22AR) in vivo, we induced serial electrical stimulation of cardiac sympathetic nerves (SS) in normal pigs that underwent concomitant BK infusion. Both SS and BK alone induced increases in cardiac tPA release. Importantly, despite B2R desensitisation, simultaneous BK infusion and SS (BK+SS) was characterised by 2.3 \u00b1 0.3-fold enhanced tPA release compared to SS alone. When \u03b2-blockade (propranolol) was introduced prior to BK+SS, tPA release was inhibited. A persistent B2R-\u03b22AR heterodimer was confirmed in BK-stimulated and non-stimulated left ventricular myocardium by immunoprecipitation studies and under non-reducing gel conditions. All together, these results strongly suggest BK transactivation of \u03b22AR leading to enhanced \u03b22AR-mediated release of tPA. Importantly, non-selective \u03b2-blockade inhibits both SS-induced release of tPA and the functional effects of B2R-\u03b22AR heterodimerisation in vivo, which may have important clinical implications.",

    "69": "Insect prophenoloxidase (PPO) is an important innate immunity protein due to its involvement in cellular and humoral defense. It belongs to a group of type-3 copper-containing proteins that occurs in almost all organisms. Insect PPO has been studied for over a century, and the PPO activation cascade is becoming clearer. The insect PPO activation pathway incorporates several important proteins, including pattern-recognition receptors (PGRP, \u03b2 GRP, and C-type lectins), serine proteases, and serine protease inhibitors (serpins). Due to their complexity, PPO activation mechanisms vary among insect species. Activated phenoloxidase (PO) oxidizes phenolic molecules to produce melanin around invading pathogens and wounds. The crystal structure of Manduca sexta PPO shows that a conserved amino acid, phenylalanine (F), can block the active site pocket. During activation, this blocker must be dislodged or even cleaved at the N-terminal sequence to expose the active site pockets and allow substrates to enter. Thanks to the crystal structure of M. sexta PPO, some domains and specific amino acids that affect PPO activities have been identified. Further studies of the relationship between PPO structure and enzyme activities will provide an opportunity to examine other type-3 copper proteins, and trace when and why their various physiological functions evolved. Recent researches show that insect PPO has a relationship with neuron activity, longevity, feces melanization (phytophagous insects) and development, which suggests that it is time for us to look back on insect PPO beyond the view of immunity in this review.",

Healthy adult subjects were randomized to arm A (n = 26) or arm B (n = 30), with the arm A subjects administered 100 mg metoprolol tartrate in the first period, 100 mg metoprolol tartrate with the third of three daily doses of PA in the second period, and three daily doses of PA alone in the 90-day redosing period. The arm B subjects received the three-day PA regimen in the first period, with redosing of the regimen after 60 days in the second period. The noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were computed for metoprolol, its metabolite alpha-hydroxymetoprolol, and pyronaridine. The coadministration of metoprolol and PA was associated with an average 47.93% (90% confidence interval [CI], 30.52, 67.66) increase in the maximum concentration of metoprolol and a 25.60% (90% CI, 15.78, 36.25) increase in the metoprolol area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration obtained (AUC0-t); these increases most likely resulted from pyronaridine-mediated CYP2D6 inhibition. No interaction effect of metoprolol with pyronaridine was apparent. Following dosing with PA, some subjects experienced rises in liver function tests above the upper limit of normal during the first few days following PA administration. All such elevations resolved typically within 10 days, and up to 30 days at most. In subjects who were redosed, the incidences of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) level elevations were similar on the first and second administrations, with no marked difference between the 60-day and 90-day redosing.", 
    "71": "We investigated the regulation of mitochondrial poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) by the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) system during oxidative stress in U937 monocytes. Oxidative stress induced an early (10 minutes) mitochondrial DNA damage, and concomitant activation of PARP1 in the mitochondria. These early events were followed by a progressive mitochondrial oxidant production and nuclear PARP1 activation (by 6 hours). These processes led to a functional impairment of mitochondria, culminating in cell death of mixed (necrotic/apoptotic) type. \u03b2-Adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol or inhibition of its downstream cAMP/PKA signaling attenuated, while \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonists and cAMP/PKA activators enhanced, the oxidant-mediated PARP1 activation. In the presence of cAMP, recombinant PKA directly phosphorylated recombinant PARP1 on serines 465 (in the automodification domain) and 782 and 785 (both in the catalytic domain). Inhibition of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor/cAMP/PKA axis protected against the oxidant-mediated cell injury. Propranolol also suppressed PARP1 activation in peripheral blood leukocytes during bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation in mice. We conclude that the activation of mitochondrial PARP1 is an early, active participant in oxidant-induced cell death, which is under the control of \u03b2-adrenoceptor/cAMP/PKA axis through the regulation of PARP1 activity by PARP1 phosphorylation.",

Though carvedilol, a \u03b2-adrenergic blocker, has been shown to produce cytoprotective effects against cardiomyocyte apoptosis, the mechanisms are not fully understood. The present study was designed to investigate whether the beneficial effects of carvedilol are related to microRNAs which have emerged as critical players in cardiovascular pathophysiology via post-transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes. In vivo, we demonstrated that carvedilol ameliorated impaired cardiac function of infarct rats and restored miR-133 expression. In vitro, carvedilol protected cardiomyocytes from H2O2 induced apoptosis detected by TUNEL staining and MTT assays, and increased miR-133 expression in cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of miR-133, a recognized anti-apoptotic miRNA, produced similar effects to carvedilol: reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content and increment of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) level, so as to protect cardiomyocytes from apoptosis by downregulating caspase-9 and caspase-3 expression in the presence of H2O2. Transfection with AMO-133 (antisense inhibitor oligodeoxyribonucleotides) alone abolished the beneficial effects of carvedilol. Caspase-9-specific inhibitor z-LEHD-fmk, caspase-3-specific inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk, caspase-9 siRNA and caspase-3 siRNA were used to establish caspase-3 as a downstream target of miR-133. In conclusion, our data indicated that carvedilol protected cardiomyocytes by increasing miR-133 expression and suppressing caspase-9 and subsequent apoptotic pathways.",

Atenolol administration to mature rats was followed by a slight deceleration of cardiac rhythm, a tendency to heart rate variability decrease in the HF range, and moderate increase in centralization of regulation. In 6-week-old rats, increased variability of cardiointervals and significant increase of centralization of the heart rhythm regulation due to an increase in the power of low-frequency waves (specifically VLF) were observed. In both mature and young rats, changes of heart rate frequency and variability in response to atenolol administration were more pronounced in females. Phenylephrine administration was followed by a significant heart rate deceleration, increase in cardiointerval variability and centralization of heart rate regulation in mature rats and by a decrease in heart rate variability in all frequency ranges in 6-week-old rats.

    "82": "Current data support that pharmacological modulators of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) have therapeutic potential for diabetic individuals. Therefore, we aimed to examine whether timolol, having free radical-scavenger action, besides being a \u03b2-blocker, exerts a cardioprotective effect via inhibition of ERS response in diabetic rats in a comparison with an antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Histopathological data showed that either timolol- or NAC-treatment of diabetic rats prevented the changes in mitochondria and nucleus of the cardiac tissue while they enhanced the cellular redox-state in heart as well. The levels of ER-targeted cytoprotective chaperones GRP78 and calnexin, unfolded protein response signaling protein CHO/Gadd153 besides the levels of calpain, BCL-2, phospho-Akt, PUMA, and PML in the hearts from diabetic rats, treated with either timolol or NAC, are found to be similar among these groups, although all these parameters were markedly preserved in the untreated diabetics compared to those of the controls. Taken into consideration how important a balanced-ratio between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins for the maintenance mitochondria/ER function, our results suggest that ERS in diabetic rat heart is mediated by increased oxidative damage, which in turn triggers cardiac dysfunction. Moreover, we also demonstrated that timolol treatment of diabetic rats, similar to NAC treatment, induced a well-controlled redox-state and apoptosis in cardiac myocardium. We, thus for the first time, report that cardioprotective effect of timolol seems to be associated with normalization of ER function due to its antioxidant action in cardiomyocytes even under hyperglycemia.",

    "84": "Nicotinic systems have been shown by a variety of studies to be involved in cognitive function. Nicotinic receptors have an inherent property to become desensitized after activation. The relative role of nicotinic receptor activation vs. net receptor inactivation by desensitization in the cognitive effects of nicotinic drugs remains to be fully understood. In these studies, we tested the effects of the \u03b17 nicotinic receptor antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA), the \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptor antagonist dihydro-\u03b2-erythroidine (DH\u03b2E), the nonspecific nicotinic channel blocker mecamylamine and the \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic receptor desensitizing agent sazetidine-A on learning in a repeated acquisition test. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained on a repeated acquisition learning procedure in an 8-arm radial maze. MLA (1-4mg/kg), DH\u03b2E (1-4mg/kg), mecamylamine (0.125-0.5mg/kg) or sazetidine-A (1 and 3mg/kg) were administered in four different studies either alone or together with the NMDA glutamate antagonist dizocilpine (0.05 and 0.10mg/kg). MLA significantly counteracted the learning impairment caused by dizocilpine. The overall choice accuracy impairment caused by dizocilpine was significantly attenuated by co-administration of DH\u03b2E. Low doses of the non-specific nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine also reduced dizocilpine-induced repeated acquisition impairment. Sazetidine-A reversed the accuracy impairment caused by dizocilpine. These studies provide evidence that a net decrease in nicotinic receptor activity can improve learning by attenuating learning impairment induced by NMDA glutamate blockade. This adds to evidence in cognitive tests that nicotinic antagonists can improve cognitive function. Further research characterizing the efficacy and mechanisms underlying nicotinic antagonist and desensitization induced cognitive improvement is warranted.", 
    "85": "In vitro studies have demonstrated that \u03b22-adrenergic receptor activation stimulates glycogen degradation in astrocytes, generating lactate as a potential energy source for neurons. Using in vivo microdialysis in mouse cerebellar white matter we demonstrate continuous axonal lactate uptake and glial-axonal metabolic coupling of glutamate/lactate exchange. However, this physiological lactate production was not influenced by activation (clenbuterol) or blocking (ICI 118551) of \u03b22-adrenergic receptors. In two-photon imaging experiments on ex vivo mouse corpus callosum subjected to aglycemia, \u03b22-adrenergic activation rescued axons, whereas inhibition of axonal lactate uptake by \u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4-CIN) was associated with severe axonal loss. Our results suggest that axonal protective effects of glial \u03b22-adrenergic receptor activation are not mediated by enhanced lactate production.", 
    "86": "The ontogeny of carbon dioxide (CO2) sensing in zebrafish (Danio rerio) has not been examined. In this study, CO2-mediated increases in heart rate were used to gauge the capacity of zebrafish larvae to sense CO2. CO2 is thought to be detected via neuroepithelial cells (NECs), which are homologous to mammalian carotid body glomus cells. Larvae at 5 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.) exhibited tachycardia when exposed for 30 min to 0.75% CO2 (~5.63 mmHg); at 7 d.p.f., tachycardia was elicited by 0.5% CO2 (~3.75 mmHg). Based on pharmacological evidence using \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) antagonists, and confirmed by \u03b21-AR translational gene knockdown using morpholinos, the reflex tachycardia accompanying hypercapnia was probably mediated by the interaction of catecholamines with cardiac \u03b21 receptors. Because the cardiac response to hypercapnia was abolished by the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium, it is probable that the reflex cardio-acceleration was mediated by catecholamines derived from sympathetic adrenergic neurons. Owing to its likely role in facilitating intracellular acidification during exposure to hypercapnia, it was hypothesized that carbonic anhydrase (CA) is involved in CO2 sensing, and that inhibition of CA activity would blunt the downstream responses. Indeed, the cardiac response to hypercapnia (0.75% CO2) was reduced in fish at 5 d.p.f. exposed to acetazolamide, a CA inhibitor, and in fish experiencing zCAc (CA2-like a) knockdown. Successful knockdown of zCAc was confirmed by CA activity measurements, western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Co-injection of embryos with zCAc morpholino and mRNA modified at the morpholino binding site restored normal levels of CA activity and protein levels, and restored (rescued) the usual cardiac responses to hypercapnia. These data, combined with the finding that zCAc is expressed in NECs located on the skin, suggest that the afferent limb of the CO2-induced cardiac reflex in zebrafish larvae is initiated by coetaneous CO2-sensing neuroepithelial cells.", 
    "87": "The mixed micelles and vesicles present in the intraluminal environment of the postprandial state exhibit suitable solubilizing capacities for lipophilic drugs. This increase in solubility, however, is accompanied by a decrease in the free fraction caused by micellar entrapment of these lipophilic compounds. In this study, both simulated and aspirated human intestinal fluids of fasted and fed state conditions were used to evaluate the influence of food on the intestinal disposition of a series of structurally related \u03b2-blockers, with varying logP values. Using the in situ intestinal perfusion technique with mesenteric blood sampling in rats, it was demonstrated that fed state conditions significantly decreased the absorptive flux of the more lipophilic compounds metoprolol, propranolol and carvedilol, whereas the influence on the flux of the hydrophilic \u03b2-blocker atenolol was limited. The solubility of BCS class II compound carvedilol was found to increase significantly in simulated and aspirated media of the fed state. Intestinal perfusions using intestinal media saturated with carvedilol, revealed a higher flux in the fasted state compared to the fed state, despite the higher solubility in the fed state. This study underscores the importance of addressing the complex nature of the behavior of compounds in the intraluminal environment in fasted and fed state conditions.

Their blocking activities against \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening were evaluated by JC-1 assay which measured the change of mitochondrial membrane potential. Seven compounds showed better inhibitory activities than the standard Cyclosporin A (CsA). The most active analogues were tested by MTT assay to evaluate their toxicity on the cellular survival; they revealed excellent cellular viability. To explain the difference in inhibitory activity, molecular docking study using (GOLD) program was performed for selected sets of the most active and inactive compounds on cyclophilin D (CypD) receptor as a major component of mPTP. Moreover, ADME profiling, in silico toxicity, drug-likeness, and drug-score studies were discussed. From these results, we report compound 31 as the most active nonpeptidyl mPTP blocker possessing quinazoline-urea scaffold; 2 folds of CsA activity, which would constitute a new direction for the design of novel mPTP modulators.", 
    "108": "Our previous work showed that implanting a sensory nerve or vascular bundle when constructing vascularized and neurotized bone could promote bone osteogenesis in tissue engineering. This phenomenon could be explained by the regulatory function of neuropeptides. Neuropeptide substance P (SP) has been demonstrated to contribute to bone growth by stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs). However, there have been no prior studies on the association between Wnt signaling and the mechanism of SP in the context of BMSC differentiation. Our results have shown that SP could enhance the differentiation of BMSCs by activating gene and protein expression via the Wnt pathway and by translocating \u03b2-catenin, which can be inhibited by Wnt signaling blocker treatment or by the NK-1 antagonist. SP could also increase the growth factor level of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Additionally, SP could enhance the migration ability of BMSCs, and the promotion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression by SP has been studied. In conclusion, SP could induce osteoblastic differentiation via the Wnt pathway and promote the angiogenic ability of BMSCs. These results indicate that a vascularized and neurotized tissue-engineered construct could be feasible for use in bone tissue engineering strategies.",

This sol-gel process incorporates a synthetic sol-gel precursor which contains a macrocyclic antibiotic, vancomycin, to form a porous silica network inside a fused-silica capillary. To avoid degradation of vancomycin during the column fabrication, a mild step was adopted into the sol-gel process. The performance of the vancomycin chiral stationary phase was investigated by CEC in both the reversed-phase mode and the normal-phase mode. The vancomycin chiral stationary phase was optimized with respect to vancomycin loading in the reversed-phase mode for chiral separation of thalidomide enantiomers. The best efficiency and resolution values of 94600plates/m and 5.79, respectively, were achieved. The optimized column was further applied to chiral separation of alprenolol enantiomers. A plate height of less than 7\u03bcm for the first eluted enantiomer of alprenolol was obtained in an aqueous mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.74mm/s. Using enantiomers of seven \u03b2-blockers and some other basic enantiomers as test analytes, separation efficiencies of up to 148100plates/m in the reversed-phase mode and up to 138100plates/m in the normal-phase mode were achieved.",

An efficient control of virus infections requires the coordinated actions of both innate and adaptive immune responses. In order to define the role of innate immunity effectors against HBV, viral clearance was studied in a panel of immunodeficient mouse strains by the hydrodynamic injection approach. Our results demonstrate that HBV viral clearance is not changed in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR), RIG-I, MDA5, MYD88, NLRP3, ASC, and IL-1R knock-out mice, indicating that these innate immunity effectors are not required for HBV clearance. In contrast, HBV persists in the absence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) or in mice treated with the soluble TNF receptor blocker, Etanercept. In these mice, there was an increase in PD-1-expressing CD8+ T-cells and an increase of serum HBV DNA, HBV core, and surface antigen expression as well as viral replication within the liver. Furthermore, the induction of TNF-\u03b1 in clearing HBV is dependent on the HBV core, and TNF blockage eliminated HBV core-induced viral clearance effects. Finally, the intra-hepatic leukocytes (IHLs), but not the hepatocytes, are the cell source responsible for TNF-\u03b1 production induced by HBcAg. These results provide evidences for TNF-\u03b1 mediated innate immune mechanisms in HBV clearance and explain the mechanism of HBV reactivation during therapy with TNF blockage agents.",

Expression of PRR is increased in the heart and kidney of hypertensive and diabetic animals, but its causative role in organ damage is still unclear. To determine whether increased expression of PRR is sufficient to induce cardiac or renal injury, we generated a mouse that constitutively overexpresses PRR by knocking-in the Atp6ap2/PRR gene in the hprt locus under the control of a CMV immediate early enhancer/chicken beta-actin promoter. Mice were backcrossed in the C57Bl/6 and FVB/N strain and studied at the age of 12 months. In spite of a 25- to 80-fold renal and up to 400-fold cardiac increase in Atp6ap2/PRR expression, we found no differences in systolic blood pressure or albuminuria between wild-type and PRR overexpressing littermates. Histological examination did not show any renal or cardiac fibrosis in mutant mice. This was supported by real-time PCR analysis of inflammatory markers as well as of pro-fibrotic genes in the kidney and collagen in cardiac tissue. To determine whether the concomitant increase of renin would trigger fibrosis, we treated PRR overexpressing mice with the angiotensin receptor-1 blocker losartan over a period of 6 weeks. Renin expression increased eightfold in the kidney but no renal injury could be detected. In conclusion, our results suggest no major role for PRR in organ damage per se or related to its function as a receptor of renin.",

The predictive value of currently used in silico methods, in vitro cell lines, ex vivo intestinal tissue and/or in vivo animal studies for human intestinal absorption, however, is often insufficient, especially when food-drug interactions are evaluated. Ideally, for this purpose healthy human intestinal tissue is used, but due to its limited availability there is a need for alternatives. The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of healthy porcine intestinal tissue mounted in a newly developed InTESTine\u2122 system to predict human intestinal absorption of compounds with different chemical characteristics, and within biorelevant matrices. To that end, first, a representative set of compounds was chosen of which the apparent permeability (Papp) data in both Caco-2 cells and human intestinal tissue mounted in the Ussing chamber system, and absolute human oral bioavailability were reported. Thereafter, Papp values of the subset were determined in both porcine jejunal tissue and our own Caco-2 cells. In addition, the feasibility of this new approach to study regional differences (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) in permeability of compounds and to study the effects of luminal factors on permeability was also investigated. For the latter, a comparison was made between the compatibility of porcine intestinal tissue, Caco-2 cells, and Caco-2 cells co-cultured with the mucin producing HT29-MTX cells with biorelevant samples as collected from an in vitro dynamic gastrointestinal model (TIM). The results demonstrated that for the paracellularly transported compounds atenolol, cimetidine, mannitol and ranitidine porcine Papp values are within 3-fold difference of human Papp values, whereas the Caco-2 Papp values are beyond 3-fold difference. Overall, the porcine intestinal tissue Papp values are more comparable to human Papp values (9 out of 12 are within 3-fold difference), compared to Caco-2 Papp values (4 out of 12 are within 3-fold difference). In addition, for the selected hydrophilic compounds a significant increase in the permeability was observed from duodenum to ileum. Finally, this study indicated that porcine jejunal tissue segments can be used with undiluted luminal samples to predict human intestinal permeability and the effect of biorelevant matrices on this. In conclusion, viable porcine intestinal tissue mounted in the InTESTine\u2122 system can be applied as a reliable tool for the assessment of intestinal permeability in the absence and presence of biorelevant samples. This would enable an accessible opportunity for a reliable prediction of human intestinal absorption, and the effect of luminal compounds such as digested foods, early in drug development.", 
    "122": "In this work we investigated the moving boundaries and the associated drug release kinetics in matrix tablets prepared with two complexes between \u03bb-carrageenan and two soluble model drugs, namely, diltiazem HCl and metoprolol tartrate aiming at clarifying the role played by drug/polymer interaction on the water uptake, swelling, drug dissolution, and drug release performance of the matrix. The two studied complexes released the drug with different mechanism indicating two different drug/polymer interaction strengths. The comparison between the drug release behaviour of the complexes and the relevant physical mixtures indicates that diltiazem gave rise to a less soluble and more stable complex with carrageenan than metoprolol. The less stable metoprolol complex afforded an erodible matrix, whereas the stronger interaction between diltiazem and carrageenan resulted in a poorly soluble, slowly dissolving matrix. It was concluded that the different stability of the studied complexes affords two distinct drug delivery systems: in the case of MTP, the dissociation of the complex, as a consequence of the interaction with water, affords a classical soluble matrix type delivery system; in the case of DTZ, the dissolving/diffusing species is the complex itself because of the very strong interaction between the drug and the polymer.",

Here we analyzed the key components of myocardial AC signaling in the developing chick embryo and assessed the impact of selected \u03b2-blocking agents on this system. Application of metoprolol and carvedilol, two commonly used \u03b2-blockers, at embryonic day (ED) 8 significantly downregulated (by about 40%) expression levels of AC5, the dominant cardiac AC isoform, and the amount of Gs\u03b1 protein at ED9. Activity of AC stimulated by forskolin was also significantly reduced under these conditions. Interestingly, when administered at ED4, these drugs did not produce such profound changes in the myocardial AC signaling system, except for markedly increased expression of Gi\u03b1 protein. These data indicate that \u03b2-blocking agents can strongly derange AC signaling during the first half of embryonic heart development.",

Ion suppression effect was firstly compared between electrospray ionization (ESI) and conventional SSI, and more severe ion suppression effect was observed with SSI. Ion suppression effect of SSI was also found difficult to be alleviated by simply optimizing major parameters. Alternatively, we found that with the assistance of an alternating current (AC) voltage with low amplitude, the ion suppression effect was greatly alleviated (comparable with conventional ESI). That AC voltage was applied outside the SSI spray tip, and no direct contact between the electrode and spray solution was necessary. Besides the alleviation of the ion suppression effect, this newly-developed method, termed as induced electrosonic spray ionization (IESSI), appeared to preserve similar charge state distribution with SSI for protonated cytochrome c, hemoglobin, and bradykinin. IESSI could also obtain significantly improved ion intensities (~1000-fold over conventional SSI).

Blocking the overexcitation of the neural network, with levetiracetam (LEV), a sodium channel blocker applied in the treatment of epilepsy, prevented synaptic and cognitive deficits in human amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. This study has brought the potential use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in AD therapy. We showed that the chronic treatment with lamotrigine (LTG), a broad-spectrum AED, suppressed abnormal spike activity, prevented the loss of spines, synaptophysin immunoreactivity, and neurons, and thus attenuated the deficits in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory in APP and presenilin 1 (PS1) mice, which express human mutant APP and PS1. In contrast with LEV, which failed to reduce the generation of amyloid \u03b2, the chronic LTG treatment reduced the cleavage of APP by \u03b2-secretase and thus the numbers and the size of amyloid plaques in the brains of APP and PS1 mice. Moreover, the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) were enhanced in the brains of APP and PS1 mice by the chronic LTG treatment. Therefore, these observations demonstrate that LTG attenuates AD pathology through multiple mechanisms, including modulation of abnormal network activity, reduction of the generation of amyloid beta and upregulation of BDNF and NGF.",

Postmenopausal women have low plasma estrogen, but have high levels of conjugated steroids, particularly estrone sulfate (E1S) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). Conversion of these precursors to active estrogens may help maintain bone density in postmenopausal women. The enzyme steroid sulfatase (STS) converts sulfated steroids into active forms in peripheral tissues. STS occurs in bone, but little is known about its role in bone function. In this study, we investigated STS activity and expression in the human MG-63 pre-osteoblastic cell line. We also tested whether sulfated steroids can stimulate growth of these cells. MG-63 cells and microsomes both possessed STS activity, which was blocked by the STS inhibitors EMATE and 667 Coumate. Further evidence for STS in these cells was provided by RT-PCR, using STS specific primers, which resulted in cDNA products of the predicted size. We then tested for growth of MG-63 cells in the presence of estradiol-17\u03b2, E1S and DHEAS. All three steroids stimulated MG-63 cell growth in a steroid-free basal medium. We also tested whether the cell growth induced by sulfated steroids could be blocked using a STS inhibitor (667 Coumate) or using an estrogen receptor blocker (ICI 182,780). Both compounds inhibited E1S-induced cell growth, indicating that E1S stimulates MG-63 cell growth through a mechanism involving both STS and the estrogen receptor. Finally, we demonstrated using RT-PCR that MG-63 cells contain mRNA for both estrogen receptor alpha and estrogen receptor beta. Our data reveal that STS is present in human pre-osteoblastic bone cells and that it can influence bone cell growth by converting inactive sulfated steroids to estrogenic forms that act via estrogen receptor alpha or beta.",

In this study, Eruca sativa L. and Zea mays L. were selected to determine the potential uptake and accumulation of eight different PACs (Salbutamol, Atenolol, Lincomycin, Cyclophosphamide, Carbamazepine, Bezafibrate, Ofloxacin and Ranitidine) designed for human use. To mimic environmental conditions, the plants were grown in pots and irrigated with water spiked with a mixture of PACs at concentrations found in Italian wastewaters and rivers. Moreover, 10\u00d7 and 100\u00d7 concentrations of these pharmaceuticals were also tested. The presence of the pharmaceuticals was tested in the edible parts of the plants, namely leaves for E. sativa and grains for Z. mays. Quantification was performed by liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC/MS/MS). In the grains of 100\u00d7 treated Z. mays, only atenolol, lincomycin and carbamazepine were above the limit of detection (LOD). At the same concentration in E. sativa plants the uptake of all PACs was >LOD. Lincomycin and oflaxacin were above the limit of quantitation in all conditions tested in E. sativa. The results suggest that uptake of some pharmaceuticals from the soil may indeed be a potential transport route to plants and that these environmental pollutants can reach different edible parts of the selected crops. Measurements of the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals in plant materials were used to model potential adult human exposure to these compounds. The results indicate that under the current experimental conditions, crops exposed to the selected pharmaceutical mixture would not have any negative effects on human health. Moreover, no significant differences in the growth of E. sativa or Z. mays plants irrigated with PAC-spiked vs. non-spiked water were observed.",

The treatment of tardive dyskinesia, dystonia, myoclonus, tourettism, tremor and akathisia is challenging for both psychiatrists and neurologists. Lack of randomized and controlled examinations for many routinely applied clinical therapeutic options make the development of clinical guidelines difficult. The present review article summarizes the available evidence for the treatment of tardive syndromes. According to the treatment guideline published by the American Academy of Neurology in 2013, the usage of clonazepam, ginkgo biloba, amantadine and tetrabenazine has enough evidence to draw conclusions. Although lowering or stopping the eliciting agent, changing to atypical antipsychotics, and adding anticholinergics are widely used techniques, there are no convincing controlled studies available to support their efficacy. The usage of Vitamin E, levetiracetam, propranolol, botulinum toxin and deep brain stimulation may be promising treatment options in the future.",

IDN5706 has shown numerous beneficial effects when administered to wild-type and double transgenic (APPswe/PSEN1\u0394E9) mice that model Alzheimer's disease. However, its mechanism of action is currently unknown. Toward this end, we analysed field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in mouse hippocampal slices incubated with IDN5706 and in the presence of the TRPC3/6/7 activator 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), the TRPC channel blocker SKF96365, and neurotoxic amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2) oligomers. To study spatial memory, Morris water maze (MWM) behavioural tests were conducted on wild-type mice treated with IDN5706 and SKF96365. In silico studies were conducted to predict a potential pharmacophore. IDN5706 and OAG had a similar stimulating effect on fEPSPs, which was inhibited by SKF96365. IDN5706 protected from reduced fEPSPs induced by A\u03b2 oligomers. IDN5706 improved spatial memory in wild-type mice, an effect that was counteracted by co-administration of SKF96365. Our in silico studies suggest strong pharmacophore similarity of IDN5706 and other reported TRPC6 activators (IDN5522, OAG and Hyp9). We propose that the effect of IDN5706 is mediated through activation of the TRPC3/6/7 channel subfamily. The unveiling of the drug's mechanism of action is a necessary step toward the clinical use of IDN5706 in Alzheimer's disease.",

Peripartum cardiomyopathy is diagnosed in women without a history of heart disease 1 month before delivery or within 5 months postpartum. About half of all women will have full myocardial recovery within 6 months of diagnosis, but complications such as severe heart failure or death are not rare. African-American women have higher rates of diagnosis and adverse events. Women with preexisting cardiomyopathy, such as dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, followed closely during pregnancy often tolerate pregnancy and delivery. Risk factors for adverse outcomes include functional status at baseline, severity of systolic dysfunction or outflow tract gradient, or history of prior cardiac event, such as arrhythmia or stroke. The level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to risk stratify women for adverse events. Pregnant women with cardiomyopathy should be followed closely by a multidisciplinary team comprised of nurses, obstetricians, neonatologists, cardiologists, anesthesiologists, and cardiac surgeons.", 
    "175": "There is increasing interest in guiding Heart Failure (HF) therapy with Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP), with the goal of lowering concentrations of these markers (and maintaining their suppression) as part of the therapeutic approach in HF. However, recent European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and American Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines did not recommend biomarker-guided therapy in the management of HF patients. This has likely to do with the conceptual, methodological, and practical limitations of the Natriuretic Peptides (NP)-based approach, including biological variability, slow time-course, poor specificity, cost and venipuncture, as well as to the lack of conclusive scientific evidence after 15\u00a0years of intensive scientific work and industry investment in the field. An increase in NP can be associated with accumulation of extra-vascular lung water, which is a sign of impending acute heart failure. If this is the case, an higher dose of loop diuretics will improve symptoms. However, if no lung congestion is present, diuretics will show no benefit and even harm. It is only a combined clinical, bio-humoral (for instance with evaluation of renal function) and echocardiographic assessment which may unmask the pathophysiological (and possibly therapeutic) heterogeneity underlying the same clinical and NP picture. Increase in B-lines will trigger increase of loop diuretics (or dialysis); the marked increase in mitral insufficiency (at baseline or during exercise) will lead to increase in vasodilators and to consider mitral valve repair; the presence of substantial inotropic reserve during stress will give a substantially higher chance of benefit to beta-blocker or Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT). To each patient its own therapy, not with a \"blind date\" with symptoms and NP and carpet bombing with drugs, but with an open-eye targeted approach on the mechanism predominant in that individual patient. A monocular, specialistic, unidimensional approach to HF can miss its pathogenetic and clinical complexity, which only can be overcome with an integrated, versatile and tailored approach.", 
    "176": "Beta-blockers are established drugs in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but their role in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is not established. Hence, we undertook a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of beta-blockers on mortality and morbidity in HFpEF patients. A systematic search using PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane databases was performed to identify all relevant studies on beta-blockers and HFpEF. A random-effects model was performed to assess the role of beta-blockers on all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization. Overall 15 observational studies and two randomized control trial involving a total of 27,099 patients were included in the analysis. In the observational studies, beta-blocker therapy was associated with lower all-cause mortality [RR 0.81 (0.72-0.90), p < 0.001], but not HF hospitalization [RR 0.79 (0.57-1.10), p < 0.001]. However, in the two RCTs, the use of beta-blocker was not associated with all-cause mortality [RR 0.94 (0.67-1.32), p = 0.72] or HF hospitalization [0.90 (0.54-1.49), p = 0.68]. The results were consistent by geographic region (USA vs. rest of world) and ejection fraction subgroups. Subgroup analysis revealed that the beneficial survival effect of beta-blocker was limited to studies with mean age <75 years. Observational studies showed a significant benefit from the use of beta-blockers for all-cause mortality, but not for HF hospitalization. Beta-blockers in the two RCTs were not associated with significant reduction in all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization; however, both the trials were not adequately powered and had high loss to follow-up rates. Further large sampled well-conducted randomized trials are warranted to confirm the effects of beta-blockers on mortality and hospitalization.", 
    "177": "Currently, there are no available approaches to cure or slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposits and intraneuronal tangles that comprised hyperphosphorylated tau. The \u03b22 adrenergic receptors (\u03b22ARs) are expressed throughout the cortex and hippocampus and play a key role in cognitive functions. Alterations in the function of these receptors have been linked to AD; however, these data remain controversial as apparent contradicting reports have been published. Given the current demographics of growing elderly population and the high likelihood of concurrent \u03b2-blocker use for other chronic conditions, more studies into the role of this receptor in AD animal models are needed. Here, we show that administration of ICI 118,551 (ICI), a selective \u03b22AR antagonist, exacerbates cognitive deficits in a mouse model of AD, the 3xTg-AD mice. Neuropathologically, ICI increased A\u03b2 levels and A\u03b2 plaque burden. Concomitantly, ICI-treated 3xTg-AD mice showed an increase in tau phosphorylation and accumulation. Mechanistically, these changes were linked to an increase in amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein processing. These results suggest that under the conditions used here, selective pharmacologic inhibition of \u03b22ARs has detrimental effects on AD-like pathology in mice. Overall, these studies strengthen the notion that the link between \u03b22ARs and AD is likely highly complex and suggest caution in generalizing the beneficial effects of \u03b2 blockers on AD.",
