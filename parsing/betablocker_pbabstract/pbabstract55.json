    "1": "A prospective, multicenter, randomized, parallel group, single-blind clinical trial was performed in 33 patients with ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma who had not been previously treated. The ocular surface was evaluated prior to and three months after treatment, with a daily drop instillation of one of the three medications. The main outcome measurements included the tear film break-up time, Schirmer's test, Lissamine green staining, the Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire, impression cytology using HE and PAS and immunocytochemistry for interleukin-6 and HLA-DR. Ensaiosclinicos.gov.br: UTN - U1111-1129-2872 RESULTS: All of the drugs induced a significant reduction in intraocular pressure. Decreases in the Schirmer's test results were observed with all of the drugs. Decreases in tear-film break-up time were noted with travoprost/timolol and latanoprost/timolol. An increase in the Lissamine green score was noted with travoprost/timolol and bimatoprost/timolol. The Ocular Surface Disease Index score increased after treatment in the travoprost/timolol group. Impression cytology revealed a significant difference in cell-to-cell contact in the same group, an increase in cellularity in all of the groups and an increase in the number of goblet cells in all of the groups. The fixed combinations induced an increase in IL-6 expression in the travoprost/timolol group, in which there was also an increase in HLA-DR expression.", 
    "2": "All of the fixed combinations induced a significant reduction in intraocular pressure, and the travoprost/timolol group showed increased expression of the inflammatory markers HLA-DR and interleukin-6. All three tested medications resulted in some degree of deterioration in the ocular surface after three months of glaucoma treatment.", 
    "3": "The noradrenergic activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) was reported to be involved in the regulation of object recognition memory. As the BLA expresses high density of receptors for Neuropeptide S (NPS), we investigated whether the BLA is involved in mediating NPS's effects on object recognition memory consolidation and whether such effects require noradrenergic activity. Intracerebroventricular infusion of NPS (1nmol) post training facilitated 24-h memory in a mouse novel object recognition task. The memory-enhancing effect of NPS could be blocked by the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Furthermore, post-training intra-BLA infusions of NPS (0.5nmol/side) improved 24-h memory for objects, which was impaired by co-administration of propranolol (0.5\u03bcg/side). Taken together, these results indicate that NPS interacts with the BLA noradrenergic system in improving object recognition memory during consolidation.", 
    "4": "The amount of organic micropollutants detected in surface waters increases steadily. Common waste water treatment plants are not built to remove these substances. Thus there is a need for new technologies. A promising technology is the use of advanced oxidation processes through which organic micropollutants can be removed from waste water. However, the formation of oxidation by-products is likely and needs to be investigated since the by-products not only differ from their parent compounds in regard to their chemical and physical properties but they can also differ in toxicity. Therefore this study was designed to combine chemical and toxicological analyses of the advanced oxidation (O3 [5mg/L] or UV/H2O2 [Hg-LP lamp; 15W; 1g/L H2O2]) of waste water treatment plant effluents and pure water. Effluent samples from conventional activated sludge waste water treatment (mechanical treatment, activated sludge basin, and primary as well as secondary treatment steps) and high-purity deionized water (pure water) were spiked with Bisphenol A, Ciprofloxacin, Metoprolol or Sulfamethoxazole and treated with O3 or UV/H2O2. For the toxicological analyses mammalian cells (CHO-9, T47D) were exposed to the water samples for 24h and were tested for cytotoxicity (MTT Test), genotoxicity (Alkaline Comet Assay) and estrogenicity (ER Calux(\u00ae)). The results indicate that the oxidative treatment (O3 or UV/H2O2) of Bisphenol A, Metoprolol, Sulfamethoxazole or Ciprofloxacin in waste water did not result in toxic oxidation by-products, whereas the UV/H2O2 treatment of Bisphenol A and Ciprofloxacin in pure water resulted in by-products with cytotoxic but no estrogenic effects after 60min.", 
    "5": "Increasingly, apparent treatment-resistant hypertension has been recognized. However, much of the prevalence, predictors, and outcomes are largely unknown, especially in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "6": "We evaluated 10,001 patients with coronary artery disease who were enrolled in the Treating to New Targets trial. Apparent treatment-resistant hypertension was defined as blood pressure \u2265 140 mm Hg despite 3 antihypertensive agents or <140 mm Hg with \u2265 4 antihypertensive agents. The primary outcome was major cardiovascular events (composite of fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and stroke).", 
    "7": "Among the 10,001 patients in the trial, 1112 (11.1%) had apparent treatment-resistant hypertension. In a multivariable model adjusting for baseline differences, the treatment-resistant hypertension group had a 64% increase in primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-1.94; P < .001), driven by a 69% increase in coronary heart disease death (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.22, 2.34; P = .001) and 73% increase in nonfatal myocardial infarction (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.39-2.16, P < .0001) when compared with the no apparent treatment-resistant hypertension group. In addition, patients with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension had a 71% increase in major coronary event (P < .0001), 45% increase in death (P = .001), 33% increase in heart failure (P = .05), 53% increase in any cardiovascular event (P < .0001), 60% increase in any coronary event (P < .0001), 68% increase in angina (P < .0001), and 51% increase in coronary revascularization (P < .0001) when compared with the no apparent treatment-resistant hypertension group. Results were largely similar whether the definition of apparent treatment-resistant hypertension was based on a blood pressure \u2265 140 mm Hg despite 3 agents or a blood pressure <140 mm Hg with \u2265 4 agents.",

    "9": "Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited disorder associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. An understanding of the relationship between the genotype and phenotype characteristics of LQTS can lead to improved risk stratification and management of this hereditary arrhythmogenic disorder. Risk stratification in LQTS relies on combined assessment of clinical, electrocardiographic, and mutations-specific factors. Studies have shown that there are genotype-specific risk factors for arrhythmic events including age, gender, resting heart rate, QT corrected for heart rate, prior syncope, the postpartum period, menopause, mutation location, type of mutation, the biophysical function of the mutation, and response to beta-blockers. Importantly, genotype-specific therapeutic options have been suggested. Lifestyle changes are recommended according to the prevalent trigger for cardiac events. Beta-blockers confer greater benefit among patients with LQT1 with the greatest benefit among those with cytoplasmic loops mutations; specific beta-blocker agents may provide greater protection than other agents in specific LQTS genotypes. Potassium supplementation and sex hormone-based therapy may protect patients with LQT2. Sodium channel blockers such as mexiletine, flecainide, and ranolazine could be treatment options in LQT3.",

    "11": "An Ovid MEDLINE (up to May 2013) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (up to May 2013) search was conducted to identify emerging pharmacological therapies for the treatment of traumatic brain injury. The search was limited to English language and humans. Pharmacological agents that were evaluated with respect to survival as an outcome were included.", 
    "12": "Based on the search, the investigators identified the following new therapies: beta-receptor antagonists, erythropoiesis stimulating agents, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and progesterone. With the exception of progesterone, which was studied in several small, randomized, controlled trials, the remaining agents were primarily studied in observational retrospective cohorts. For each of the agents identified, a potential increase in survival was noted.", 
    "13": "Emerging pharmacological agents represent promising treatment options for traumatic brain injury to improve survival. Most of these agents are commercially available for other indications. However, limitations in study design, sample size, duration of treatment, timing of treatment and inclusion of heterogeneous patient populations make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from the literature.",

Measurements were recorded pre- and post-esmolol and first dose exposure to 10 mg, 20 mg, and 80 mg of propranolol. Tiotropium was given concurrently with propranolol. Bronchoconstriction was reflected as a fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) or increase in total airway resistance at 5 Hz (R5).", 
    "18": "12 patients completed the trial. There were no adverse effects on FEV1% or R5% following intravenous esmolol. There were significant reductions at 2 min post-esmolol in heart rate (-4.7 beats/min (bpm), 95% CI -7.9 to -1.3 bpm; p=0.002) and systolic blood pressure (-5.9 mm Hg, 95% CI -11.4 to -0.4 mm Hg; p=0.03). No bronchoconstriction was seen during up titration following the first dose of 10 mg, 20 mg or 80 mg of propranolol in the presence of tiotropium. No difference in the asthma control questionnaire at 80 mg propranolol was seen versus placebo in the presence of tiotropium.", 
    "19": "Intravenous esmolol was administered without any adverse effects on pulmonary function in selected, stable, mild-to-moderate asthmatics controlled on inhaled corticosteroids.

    "24": "The present study investigated the analgesic effect of a novel synthetic cyclohexanone derivative, 2,6-bis-4-(hydroxyl-3-methoxybenzilidine)-cyclohexanone or BHMC in a mouse model of chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain. It was demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of BHMC (0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0mg/kg) exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain in mice, when evaluated using Randall-Selitto mechanical analgesiometer. It was also demonstrated that pretreatment of naloxone (non-selective opioid receptor blocker), nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI, selective \u03ba-opioid receptor blocker), but not \u03b2-funaltrexamine (\u03b2-FN, selective \u03bc-opioid receptor blocker) and naltrindole hydrochloride (NTI, selective \u03b4-opioid receptor blocker), reversed the anti-nociceptive effect of BHMC. In addition, the analgesic effect of BHMC was also reverted by pretreatment of 1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ, soluble guanosyl cyclase blocker) and glibenclamide (ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker) but not N\u03c9-nitro-l-arginine (l-NAME, a nitric oxide synthase blocker). Taken together, the present study demonstrated that the systemic administration of BHMC attenuated chronic constriction, injury-induced neuropathic pain. We also suggested that the possible mechanisms include \u03ba-opioid receptor activation and nitric oxide-independent cyclic guanosine monophosphate activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channel opening.",

    "29": "Topical ocular medications have been widely prescribed and successfully used in children for the management of different ophthalmic disorders. We present 2 infants admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit who developed altered state of consciousness, hypotonia, hypothermia, bradycardia, and apnea after instillation of ophthalmic drops. The second infant also had hypotension and broncho-obstruction. Few days before admission, both infants were diagnosed with congenital glaucoma, and topical antiglaucoma treatment was initiated. Ophthalmic drops with brimonidine and brinzolamide were prescribed to both patients, whereas the second infant also received topical timolol. After elimination of other possible causes, the diagnosis of intoxication with topical antiglaucoma medications was established. After discontinuation of eye drops and vigorous symptomatic treatment, both infants recovered without sequels. Topically applied ophthalmic drops may cause life-threatening systemic adverse effects in infants, such as central nervous system depression and cardiogenic shock. Moreover, these 2 patients illustrate the importance of careful evaluation of all topical medications and their consideration as possible causes of the derangements in critically ill infants.",

    "31": "Ang II, NA, MMP-2, MMP-9 of the aorta sample obtained during operation from aortic dissection patients were detected by High Performance Liquid Chromatography and ELISA and compared with controls. Isotope labelling method was used to test the impact of exogenous Ang II and noradrenaline on the NA release and MMP-2, MMP-9 expression on Sprague Dawley (SD) rat aorta rings in vitro. Two kidneys, one clip, models were replicated for further check of that impact in SD rats in vivo.",

Exogenous Ang II enhanced while exogenous NA restrained NA release from aortic sympathetic endings. The Ang II stimulated NA release and the following MMP-2 up-regulation could be weakened by Losartan and chemical sympathectomy. Beta blocker did not influence NA release but down-regulated MMP-2. Long term in vivo experiments confirmed that Ang II could enhance NA release and up-regulate MMP-2.",

This group received fewer secondary prevention drugs at discharge compared to younger patients (P < 0.01 for \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and statins). By 6 weeks post-PPCI, there was a small drop-off in evidence-based therapy; \u03b2-blocker and statin use in those >75 years fell from 90% to 86% and 96% to 93%, respectively. CKD (eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) was seen in 17.6%. Declining renal function was associated with age, female sex and lower use of ACE inhibitor/ARB. At discharge 83.5% of patients with eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) were receiving ACE inhibitors/ARB, dropping to 77.5% at 6 weeks (compared with 95% and 92%, respectively, in patients with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)).",

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of general practitioners (GPs) and patients regarding discontinuation of SP medication after MI and reasons for discontinuation.", 
    "39": "In this observational study, GPs of patients who had suffered acute MI provided information on discontinuation of SP medication 6 and 12 months after hospital discharge. A questionnaire-based approach was used (a) to assess the consistent use of SP medication after MI, (b) to determine reasons for stopping SP medication, (c) to quantify the involvement of GPs and patients regarding discontinuation, and (d) to analyse potential factors that are associated with discontinuation of medication.", 
    "40": "Of 204 subjects 6 and 12 months after hospital discharge 83% and 75% patients, respectively, were still on recommended SP medication. Overall, one or more SP medications were stopped (53 medications) or modified (15 medications) in 52 (25%) patients. Adverse side effects were the main reason for stopping medication (63%). GPs reported being responsible for initiating discontinuation or modification more frequently than patients (62% vs 38%, p = 0.065).",

    "42": "Angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) is thought as an important regulatory target during antihypertensive treatment but its role in vasomotor regulation remains controversial. The interactional relationship between the sympathetic nervous systems and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) has been revealed but poorly investigated. This work was designed to explore the effect of metoprolol (MET) treatment on the RAS, especially the expression and vasomotor function of AT2R, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The results showed that upregulated renin activity and Ang II concentration of plasma in SHR were inhibited by MET treatment. In isolated superior mesenteric arteries from both Wistar-Kyoto rats and SHR, Ang II perfusion induced vasodilatation after AT1R inhibition by telmisartan, although the vasodilatation was harmed in SHR. Furthermore, AT2R inhibitor PD123319 arrested the vasodilatation induced by Ang II. SHR received MET exerted improved vasodilatation mediated by AT2R (47.29% \u00b1 5.16% vs. 24.99% \u00b1 4.93% for MET and SHR, respectively; P < 0.05). Western blot analysis showed that MET restored expression of AT2R in SHR, which may contribute to MET's antihypertensive effect. These results suggested an impact of \u03b2-adrenergic blocker on RAS and supported an important role of AT2R in antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "43": "The perioperative use of beta-blockers (BBs) with the aim of decreasing perioperative adverse cardiac events has been strongly supported, especially after the publication of two small trial (McSPI and DECREASE I) that showed major benefits. However, some later trials did not confirm these benefits. The POISE trial, with 8351 patients, showed reduced primary outcomes (cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal cardiac arrest) at the expense of significant harm, increasing all-cause and sepsis-related deaths, and doubling the incidence of stroke. These results led to revised American and European guidelines. The American guideline recommended a substantial narrowing of indication for perioperative BBs, while the European guideline remained far more liberal. Since the publication of the results of POISE, meta-analyses and new studies have been published. In this review the most recent available evidence, the changes in the guidelines and the criticism on POISE results are discussed together with reasons why recent meta-analyses may not have greater certainty. This is explained by the huge numeric influence of the POISE trial and the heterogeneity in the design of the trials on perioperative BBs. Thus all the evidence available must now be taken into consideration to develop more appropriate guidelines to minimise the risks and enhance the benefits of perioperative beta-blockade.", 
    "44": "To explore the pharmacogenetic effects of the cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 genotype in patients with systolic heart failure treated using controlled/extended-release (CR/XL) metoprolol, this study assessed the CYP2D6 locus for the nonfunctional *4 allele (1846G>A; rs3892097) in the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomised Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF; n = 605). Participants were characterized as extensive, intermediate, or poor metabolizers (EMs, IMs, or PMs, respectively), based on the presence of the CYP2D6*4 allele (EM: *1*1, 60.4%; IM: *1*4, 35.8%; and PM: *4*4, 3.8%). Plasma metoprolol concentrations were 2.1-/4.6-fold greater in the IM/PM groups as compared with the EM group (P < 0.0001). Metoprolol induced significantly lower heart rates and diastolic blood pressures during early titration, indicating a CYP2D6*4 allele dose-response effect (P < 0.05). These effects were not observed at maximal dose, suggesting a saturable effect. Genotype did not adversely affect surrogate treatment efficacy. CYP2D6 genotype modulates metoprolol pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics during early titration; however, the MERIT-HF-defined titration schedule remains recommended for all patients, regardless of genotype.",

    "46": "Initial therapy of hypertension with \u03b2-blockers is not associated with reduced all-cause mortality but is associated with modest reductions in cardiovascular events compared with placebo or no treatment. Calcium channel blockers and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are associated with greater reductions in cardiovascular event rates than \u03b2-blockers. This evidence derives from trials of traditional \u03b2-blockers (eg, atenolol and propranolol), because there are currently no mortality and cardiovascular event data on the new vasodilating \u03b2-blockers (eg, carvedilol and nebivolol).",

Three quality metrics were selected: Adverse events (in-hospital complications or mortality), optimal medical therapy (OMT), and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). OMT was defined as prescription of \u03b2-blocker and either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in eligible patients. CRT eligibility was determined by QRS \u2265120 ms, left ventricular ejection fraction \u226435%, and New York Heart Association class III/IV. Observation periods were divided into four 12-month intervals. We analyzed changes over time and used hierarchical logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders. Adverse events decreased over time (3.7% to 2.8%, P<0.001). Among eligible patients, rates of OMT and CRT increased over time (OMT: 69.0% to 74.3%, P<0.001; CRT: 80.5% to 84.2%, P<0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, patients were significantly less likely to experience adverse events in year 4 than in year 1 (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.79) and significantly more likely to receive OMT (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.32) and CRT (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-1.49).",

Signs and symptoms are sometimes subtle and atypical, and a high index of suspicion is useful to guide the diagnostic evaluation. Uncontrolled hypertension remains the most significant treatable risk factor. Immediate management involves blood pressure reduction. \u03b2-Blockers are the first drugs of choice. Although future directions should involve the evolution of operative and endovascular techniques and the development of sophisticated risk prediction tools, risk factor modification by addressing the burden of uncontrolled hypertension cannot be overlooked.", 
    "52": "There is a need to identify novel agents that elicit small airway relaxation when \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonists become ineffective in difficult-to-treat asthma. Because chronic treatment with the synthetic peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone (RGZ) inhibits airway hyperresponsiveness in mouse models of allergic airways disease, we tested the hypothesis that RGZ causes acute airway relaxation by measuring changes in small airway size in mouse lung slices. Whereas the \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonists albuterol (ALB) and isoproterenol induced partial airway relaxation, RGZ reversed submaximal and maximal contraction to methacholine (MCh) and was similarly effective after precontraction with serotonin or endothelin-1. Concentration-dependent relaxation to RGZ was not altered by the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and was enhanced by ALB. RGZ-induced relaxation was mimicked by other synthetic PPAR\u03b3 agonists but not by the putative endogenous agonist 15-deoxy-PGJ2 and was not prevented by the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662. To induce airway relaxation, RGZ inhibited the amplitude and frequency of MCh-induced Ca(2+) oscillations of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). In addition, RGZ reduced MCh-induced Ca(2+) sensitivity of the ASMCs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that acute bronchodilator responses induced by RGZ are PPAR\u03b3 independent, additive with ALB, and occur by the inhibition of ASMC Ca(2+) signaling and Ca(2+) sensitivity. Because RGZ continues to elicit relaxation when \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonists have a limited effect, RGZ or related compounds may have potential as bronchodilators for the treatment of difficult asthma.",

Follow-up showed improvement in the patient's clinical status, with a dramatic disappearance of the electrical storm and reductions in cyanosis and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Low-dose colchicine may be safe and effective in patients with Naxos disease and may reduce related complications.", 
    "54": "An 83-year-old woman with a possible history of myocardial infarction presented with acute chest pain and dyspnoea. The electrocardiogram showed no signs of acute coronary syndrome, but Q waves in the anteroseptal leads. The blood tests showed an important elevation of troponin T level. Emergency coronary angiography revealed normal epicardial arteries, but the left ventriculogram demonstrated anterior akinesis and ballooning with normal apical and basal function. An atypical takotsubo cardiomyopathy was suspected and the patient received beta blocker and ACE inhibitor treatment. Two days later the echocardiogram evolved to a classical pattern of apical ballooning with normalization on the follow-up examination 5 weeks from the acute episode. To our knowledge, this is the first case report describing an evolving pattern of wall motion abnormality from an anterior wall ballooning to an apical form.", 
    "55": "Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a newly developed, less invasive treatment for esophageal achalasia that requires general anesthesia under positive pressure ventilation. In this retrospective case series, we describe the anesthetic management of 28 consecutive patients who underwent POEM for esophageal achalasia. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil under positive pressure ventilation through a tracheal tube. Retained contents in the esophagus were evacuated just before anesthesia induction to prevent regurgitation into the trachea. The POEM procedure was performed using an orally inserted flexible fiberscope. Elevation of end-tidal carbon dioxide after initiating esophageal carbon dioxide insufflation was observed in all patients and was treated by minute adjustments to the ventilation volume. Scopolamine butylbromide-induced tachycardia in one patient was treated with landiolol hydrochloride, which is a short-acting beta 1-selective blocker. Minor subcutaneous emphysema around the neck was observed in one patient. POEM was successfully completed, and tracheas were extubated immediately after the procedure in all patients. Our findings suggest that prevention of aspiration pneumonia during anesthesia induction, preparation for carbon dioxide insufflation-related complications, and treatment of scopolamine butylbromide-induced tachycardia play important roles in safe anesthesia management of POEM for esophageal achalasia.",

Pretreatment with SQ29548 and apocynin prevented U46619 induced increase in NADPH oxidase activity, PKC-\u03b1 activity and Gi\u03b1 phosphorylation. However, pretreatment with CZI, a PKC-\u03b6 inhibitor, markedly, but not completely, inhibited U46619 induced increase in NADPH oxidase activity, PKC-\u03b1 activity, Gi\u03b1 phosphorylation and also significantly eliminated U46619 caused attenuation of isoproterenol stimulated adenyl cyclase activity. Pretreatment with Go6976 inhibited U46619 induced increase in Gi\u03b1 phosphorylation, but not PKC-\u03b6 activity and NADPH oxidase activity. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin eliminated U46619 caused attenuation of isoproterenol stimulated adenyl cyclase activity without any discernible change in PKC-\u03b6, NADPH oxidase and PKC-\u03b1 activities. Transfection of the cells with Tp, PKC-\u03b6 and PKC-\u03b1 siRNA duplexes corroborate the findings observed with their respective pharmacological inhibitors on the responses produced by U46619. Taken together, we suggest involvement of PKC-\u03b6 in U46619 caused attenuation of isoproterenol stimulated \u03b2-adrenergic response, which is regulated by NADPH oxidase-PKC\u03b1-Gi\u03b1 axis in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells.", 
    "62": "As no suitable radioligand exists for the detection of \u03b23-adrenoceptors, we have explored the radioligand binding properties of a tritiated version of the selective \u03b23-adrenoceptor antagonist L 748,337. Kinetic and equilibrium saturation and competition binding experiments were performed with [(3)H]-L 748,337 on membrane fractions of HEK and CHO cells stably transfected with human and rat \u03b2-adrenoceptor subtypes. Based on both association/dissociation kinetic and equilibrium saturation binding studies in transfected HEK cells, [(3)H]-L 748,337 exhibited an affinity of approximately 2 nM for human \u03b23-adrenoceptors. Competition studies with agonists and subtype-selective antagonists validated its binding to \u03b23-adrenoceptors. In CHO cells transfected with human \u03b23-adrenoceptors similar saturable high-affinity of [(3)H]-L 748,337 was observed. While some isoprenaline-sensitive [(3)H]-L 748,337 binding was also observed in CHO cells transfected with human \u03b21- or \u03b22-adrenoceptors, this was not saturable in a similar concentration range and/or not sensitive to the antagonists propranolol and SR 59,230, indicating that it did not primarily involve \u03b2-adrenoceptors. In CHO cells transfected with rat \u03b23-adrenoceptors [(3)H]-L 748,337 exhibited a considerably lower affinity than with the human subtype (12-95 nM). Low affinity for the rat \u03b23-adrenoceptor was also found with unlabelled L 748,337 in rat bladder strip relaxation experiments. We conclude that L 748,337 apparently has lower affinity for the rat than the human \u03b23-adrenoceptors and that [(3)H]-L 748,337 can bind to a low-affinity site distinct from the orthosteric pocket of \u03b2-adrenoceptors. Nevertheless, [(3)H]-L 748,337 appears to be the most promising radioligand for the selective labelling of human \u03b23-adrenoceptors reported to date.",

However, they might produce bothersome symptoms and, in select individuals with a high PVC burden, they might contribute to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Workup of patients with very frequent PVCs consists of a thorough history and physical examination to screen for underlying cardiac disease and potential triggers. Routine investigations include a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, as well as an echocardiogram. A Holter monitor should be performed in those with severe symptoms, a history of syncope, or a malignant family history. Exercise stress testing has a role in evaluating for ischemia and in the assessment of patients with exertional symptoms. More advanced testing is not warranted if these initial investigations are reassuring. Referral to an arrhythmia specialist should be considered in patients with LV dysfunction whose PVC burden exceeds 15%. Frequent ventricular ectopy represents a rare, but reversible cause of LV dysfunction and these patients should be further evaluated for possible catheter ablation.",

Objectives. To assess the possible protective potential of MK-886 and 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid DITPA against global myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury after heart transplantation. Materials and Methods. Adult albino rats were randomized into 6 groups as follows: group I sham group; group II, control group; groups III and IV, control vehicles (1,2); group V, MK-886 treated group. Donor rats received MK-886 30\u2009min before transplantation, and the same dose was repeated for recipients upon reperfusion; in group VI, DITPA treated group, donors and recipients rats were pretreated with DITPA for 7 days before transplantation. Results. Both MK-886 and DITPA significantly counteract the increase in the levels of cardiac TNF- \u03b1 , IL-1 \u03b2 , and ICAM-1 and plasma level of cTnI (P < 0.05). Morphologic analysis showed that both MK-886 and DITPA markedly improved (P < 0.05) the severity of cardiac injury in the heterotopically transplanted rats. Conclusions. The results of our study reveal that both MK-886 and DITPA may ameliorate global myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury after heart transplantation via interfering with inflammatory pathway.",

His repeat thyroid function tests showed persistently elevated fT4 ranging 25-35.7 pmol/L and non-suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations of 6.78-22.1 mIU/L. He had a smooth, firm and non-tender goitre.

    "124": "Although a reduction in the high-frequency (HF) component of heart rate variability (HRV) is a major complication of diabetes and a risk factor for sudden death, its relationship to ventricular tachycardia (VT) is unknown. We developed a mouse model for the study of VT and its relationship to changes in HRV in the Akita type 1 diabetic mouse. Programmed ventricular stimulation of anesthetized mice demonstrated that Akita mice were more inducible for VT compared with wild-type mice: 78.6% versus 28.6% (P = 0.007). Optical mapping of perfused hearts demonstrated multifocal breakthroughs that occasionally gave rise to short-lived rotors consistent with focal initiation and maintenance of VT. Treatment of Akita mice with pravastatin, which had been previously shown clinically to decrease ventricular ectopy and to increase HRV, decreased the inducibility of VT: 36.8% compared with 75.0% with placebo treatment (P = 0.022). The HF fraction of HRV was reduced in Akita mice (48.6 \u00b1 5.2% vs. 70.9 \u00b1 4.8% in wild-type mice, P = 0.005) and was increased compared with placebo treatment in pravastatin-treated mice. Pretreatment of Akita mice with the muscarinic agonist carbamylcholine or the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol decreased the inducibility of VT (P = 0.001). In conclusion, the increased inducibility of focally initiated VT and reduced HF fraction in Akita mice were partially reversed by both pravastatin treatment and pharmacologic reversal of parasympathetic dysfunction. In this new animal model for the study of the pathogenesis of VT in type 1 diabetes, pravastatin may play a role in the prevention of VT by attenuating parasympathetic dysfunction.",

The concept of medical treatment is to prevent abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from rupture and avoid surgical treatment by preventing aneurysm enlargement or even reducing aneurysm size. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are structurally related metalloendopeptidases that can degrade the extracellular matrix and is thought to play important roles in AAA. There are many proposed pharmacological treatments including: \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors), angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB), statins, macrolides and, doxycycline, an inhibitor of the MMP.

More specifically, social stressors may play a mediating role in the association between mood disorders and cardiovascular dysfunction. This study investigated the hypothesis that the disruption of established social bonds between male and female prairie voles would produce depressive behaviors and cardiac dysregulation, coupled with endocrine and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. In Experiment 1, behaviors related to depression, cardiac function, and autonomic nervous system regulation were monitored in male prairie voles during social bonding with a female partner, social isolation from the bonded partner, and a behavioral stressor. Social isolation produced depressive behaviors, increased heart rate, heart rhythm dysregulation, and autonomic imbalance characterized by increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic drive to the heart. In Experiment 2, behaviors related to depression and endocrine function were measured following social bonding and social isolation in both male and female prairie voles. Social isolation produced similar levels of depressive behaviors in both sexes, as well as significant elevations of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone. These alterations in behavioral and physiological functioning provide insight into the mechanisms by which social stressors negatively influence emotional and cardiovascular health in humans.",

The selective \u03b23-adrenoceptor antagonist S-(-)-cyanopindolol (Syc) counteracted the effect of NEB on these miRNAs. Atenolol (ATN, a pure \u03b21-blocker) combined with specific \u03b23 agonist BRL37344 restored the expression of all three miRNAs, similar to NEB, while ATN alone had only a partial effect on miR-320 expression. Computational analysis found Insulin Growth Factor-1 Receptor (IGF1R) as a putative target of miR-320, and Phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome ten (PTEN) as a putative target of miR-26b and -21. The targets were verified by luciferase reporter assays. Inhibition of miR-320 by an antisense inhibitor or NEB increased IGF1R expression, while miR-320 overexpression reversed the effect of NEB. Overexpression of miR-26b or -21 or NEB decreased PTEN levels, while inhibition of miR-26b or -21 attenuated the effect of NEB. HS diet induced downregulation of IGF1R and upregulation of PTEN in the aorta. NEB normalized the aberrant expression of IGF1R and PTEN and also improved the impairment of vascular AKT/eNOS signaling.

When cirrhosis is diagnosed, varices are present in about 30-40% of compensated patients and in 60% of those who present with ascites. Once varices have been diagnosed, the overall incidence of variceal bleeding is in the order of 25% at two years. Variceal size is the most useful predictor for variceal bleeding, other predictors are severity of liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh classification) and the presence of red wale marks on the variceal wall. The current consensus is that every cirrhotic patient should be endoscopically screened for varices at the time of diagnosis to detect those requiring prophylactic treatment. Non-selective beta-adrenergic blockers (NSBB) and endoscopic band ligation (EBL) have been shown effective in the prevention of first variceal bleeding. The current recommendation for treating acute variceal bleeding is to start vasoactive drug therapy early (ideally during the transferral or to arrival to hospital, even if active bleeding is only suspected) and performing EBL. Once bleeding is controlled, combination therapy with NSBB\u00a0+\u00a0EBL should be used to prevent rebleeding. In patients at high risk of treatment failure despite of using this approach, an early covered-TIPS within 72\u00a0h (ideally 24\u00a0h) should be considered. Data on management of gastric variceal bleeding is limited. No clear recommendation for primary prophylaxis can be done. In acute cardiofundal variceal bleeding, vasoactive agents together with cyanoacrylate (CA) injection seem to be the treatment of choice. Further CA injections and/or NSBB may be used to prevent rebleeding. TIPS or Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration when TIPS is contraindicated may be used as a rescue therapy.",

Although the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors compared with ARBs did not reach statistical significance, ACE inhibitors consistently showed higher probabilities of being in the superior ranking positions among all three outcomes. Although the protective effect of an ACE inhibitor plus calcium channel blocker compared with placebo was not statistically significant, the treatment ranking identified this combination therapy to have the greatest probability (73.9%) for being the best treatment on reducing mortality, followed by ACE inhibitor plus diuretic (12.5%), ACE inhibitors (2.0%), calcium channel blockers (1.2%), and ARBs (0.4%).",

Calcium channel blockers might be the preferred treatment in combination with ACE inhibitors if adequate blood pressure control cannot be achieved by ACE inhibitors alone.", 
    "170": "The study was undertaken considering that: i) androgens affect \u03b22-adrenoceptor (AR)-mediated catecholamine (CA) action in many tissues; and ii) peripubertal changes in both circulating androgen and thymic CA levels are implicated in rat thymic involution. Its aims were to: i) explore putative effects of the late prepubertal orchidectomy on thymic CA:\u03b22-AR complex in young adult rats, and ii) delineate the direct effects of testicular hormone withdrawal on the CA:\u03b22-AR complex from those elicited secondarily through altered influence of this complex components on each other's availability. Upon showing that prepubertal orchidectomy augmented the efficacy of thymopoiesis through increasing the thymocyte surface density of Thy-1, whose expression is negatively regulated by \u03b22-AR-mediated signaling, we examined the effects of orchidectomy and 14-day-long propranolol (PROP) treatment in orchidectomized (ORX) and sham-ORX rats on thymic norepinephrine (NE) concentration and metabolism and \u03b22-AR expression. Orchidectomy, despite an increase in the average NE amount per thymocyte and total thymocyte NE content, diminished thymic NE concentration. This decrease reflected the diminished density of CA-synthesizing nerve fibers, CD68+ macrophages, cortical (aminopeptidase A+), and medullary (UEA-1+) thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and their CA content (probably due to lessened TH expression accompanied by increased MAO-A expression). Moreover, orchidectomy decreased the surface \u03b22-AR expression on thymocytes, CD68+ macrophages and OX-62+ dendritic cells, but increased its expression on the TECs. In sham-ORX rats, PROP reduced thymic NE concentration by diminishing TH expression in the thymic cells. Additionally, PROP in thymocytes and thymic stromal cells diminished and enhanced the \u03b22-AR mRNA expression, respectively. However, in ORX rats PROP did not significantly affect CA(NE):\u03b22-AR complex components. This indicated that prepubertal orchidectomy affects ability of young adult rats to respond to \u03b2-AR blockade by altering thymic NE and \u03b22-AR availability. Collectively, the results showed that testicular hormones contribute to alterations in thymus/thymopoiesis during the critical peripubertal period by shaping modulatory sympathetic influence and CA autocrine/paracrine action within the organ.",

In the current study, we further explored the roles of TLR4 and its adaptors, MD-2 and MyD88, as well as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), in anti-\u03b22GPI/\u03b22GPI-induced the activation of THP-1 cells, especially on the expression of some proinflammatory molecules. The results showed that treatment of THP-1 cells with anti-\u03b22GPI (10\u03bcg/ml)/\u03b22GPI (100\u03bcg/ml) complex could increase IL-6 (interleukin-6), IL-8 (interleukin-8) as well as TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor alpha) expression (both mRNA and protein levels). These effects could be blocked by addition of TAK-242 (5\u03bcM), a blocker of signaling transduction mediated by the intracellular domain of TLR4, and also by NF-\u03baB inhibitor PDTC (20\u03bcM). Overall, our results indicate that anti-\u03b22GPI/\u03b22GPI complex induced IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 expression involving TLR4/MD-2/MyD88 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways and this might be associated with pathological mechanisms of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).",

Inadvertently combining potassium sparing medications can result in profound hyperkalemia which may result in cardiac dysrhythmias, especially in the setting of chronic kidney disease. An 85 year-old woman on a drug regimen of sotalol, valsartan, spironolactone, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole presented to the emergency department with hypotension and bradycardia. Presumptive treatment for hyperkalemia was started based on her initial electrocardiogram. This diagnosis was later confirmed with a serum potassium value of 10.1 mmol/L. Following pharmacologic treatment, emergency hemodialysis was performed and the patient subsequently recovered. It is known that several drug classes can cause hyperkalemia, with elderly patients at a higher risk of developing this side effect. It is believed that this was a major contributor to the degree of hyperkalemia seen in this patient.",

A list of medications was retrieved from the records of patients aged > 65 years filed in the database of the largest health maintenance organisation in our country (> two million members). Proliferation and mineralisation assays were performed on the following drugs: rosuvastatin (statin), metformin (antidiabetic), metoprolol (\u03b2-blocker), citalopram (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI]), and omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor (PPI)). All tested drugs significantly stimulated DNA synthesis to varying degrees, with rosuvastatin 5 \u00b5g/ml being the most effective among them (mean 225% (SD 20)), compared with metformin 10 \u00b5g/ml (185% (SD 10)), metoprolol 0.25 \u00b5g/ml (190% (SD 20)), citalopram 0.05 \u00b5g/ml (150% (sd 10)) and omeprazole 0.001 \u00b5g/ml (145% (SD 5)). Metformin and metoprolol (to a small extent) and rosuvastatin (to a much higher extent) inhibited cell mineralisation (85% (SD 5)). Our results indicate the need to evaluate the medications prescribed to patients in terms of their potential action on osteoblasts. Appropriate evaluation and prophylactic treatment (when necessary) might lower the incidence and costs associated with potential medication-induced osteoporosis.", 
    "174": "Two functionally important \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (\u03b21AR) polymorphisms have been identified. The R389G polymorphism influences coupling to the Gs-cAMP pathway. R(389)-\u03b21ARs display enhanced activation of cAMP/PKA; they provide short-term inotropic support but also cause a predisposition to cardiomyopathic decompensation. A second S49G polymorphism is implicated in the evolution of heart failure, but the mechanism remains uncertain. This study shows that position 49 and 389 polymorphisms function in a coordinate manner to influence agonist-dependent cAMP/PKA and ERK responses. cAMP/PKA and ERK responses are more robust in HEK293 cells that heterologously overexpress G(49)-\u03b21ARs, compared with S(49)-\u03b21ARs. However, this phenotype is most obvious on a G(389)-\u03b21AR background; the more robust agonist-dependent cAMP/PKA and ERK responses in R(389)-\u03b21AR cells effectively obscure the effect of the S49G polymorphism. We also show that isoproterenol (Iso) and carvedilol activate ERK via a similar EGFR-independent mechanism in cells expressing various \u03b21AR haplotypes. However, Iso activates ERK via an Src-independent pathway, but carvedilol-dependent ERK activation requires Src. Since the S49G polymorphism has been linked to changes in \u03b21AR trafficking, we examined whether \u03b21AR polymorphisms influence partitioning to lipid raft membranes. Biochemical fractionation studies show that all four \u03b21AR variants are recovered in buoyant flotillin-enriched membranes; the distinct signaling phenotypes of the different \u03b21AR variants could not be attributed to any gross differences in basal compartmentalization to lipid raft membranes. The allele-specific differences in \u03b21AR signaling phenotypes identified in this study could underlie interindividual differences in responsiveness to \u03b2-blocker therapy and clinical outcome in heart failure.",

The IVIVP was established by plotting the observed and predicted plasma drug concentrations. For IVIVP, convolution approach was employed to estimate plasma drug concentrations from in vitro dissolution profiles. The IVIVP for T1S exhibited a good correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.963) followed by the T2 (R2 = 0.682), T3 (R2 = 0.665), T1 (R2 = 0.616), and Mepresso (R2 = 0.345). Establishing an IVIVP, based on the convolution approach, can be more useful and practicable in the biowaiver studies, rather than present not useful practice of IVIVC estimated via deconvolution approach.

PLC inhibition abolishes bladder contraction via P2Y6 but not that via M3 muscarinic receptors, indicating a receptor-dependent role of PLC. Therefore, we explored the role of PLC in rat bladder contraction by bradykinin. The PLC inhibitor U 73,122 [1-(6-[([17\u03b2]-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5[10]-trien-17-yl)-amino]hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione] did not affect the bradykinin response to a significantly greater degree than its inactive analog U 73,343 [10 \u03bcM each; 1-(6-[-([17\u03b2]-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5[10]-trien-17-yl)-amino]hexyl)-2,5-pyrrolidinedione], whereas the phospholipase D inhibitor butan-1-ol relative to its inactive control butan-2-ol caused a weak but significant inhibition (0.3% each). The cytosolic phospholipase A2 inhibitor arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (300 \u03bcM) and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 \u03bcM) caused strong inhibition of the bradykinin response. The L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nifedipine (10-100 nM) concentration-dependently caused strong inhibition, whereas only a small but significant inhibition was seen with SK&F 96,365 [10 \u03bcM; 1-[\u03b2-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-imidazole HCl], an inhibitor of receptor-operated Ca(2+) channels. Several protein kinase C inhibitors yielded an equivocal picture (inhibition by 10 \u03bcM bisindolylmaleimide I and 1 \u03bcM calphostin but not by 10 \u03bcM chelerythrine). The rho kinase inhibitor Y 27,632 [1-10 \u03bcM; trans-4-[(1R)-1-aminoethyl]-N-4-pyridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide] caused a strong and concentration-dependent inhibition of the bradykinin response. Our data support that not only M3 but also bradykinin receptors cause bladder contraction by a largely PLC-independent mechanism. Both responses strongly involve L-type Ca(2+) channels and rho kinase, whereas only the bradykinin response additionally involves the phospholipase A2/cyclooxygenase pathway.",

However, the mechanisms of that vascular effect have not been precisely established. \u03b2(3)-Adrenoceptors have been shown to be involved in the relaxation per se of various vascular beds, including coronary vessels. Thus, we evaluated (i) the presence of \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptors in the PCA and (ii) their role in celiprolol-induced vasodilatation. PCA rings were placed in organ baths and preconstricted with KCl. All experiments were performed in the presence of nadolol (a \u03b2(1)/\u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist). Cumulative concentration-response curves to SR 58611A and ICI 215001 (2 \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor agonists) and to celiprolol were constructed. We also used semiquantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction, which clearly showed the presence of \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor transcripts. SR 58611A, ICI 215001, and celiprolol induced concentration-dependent relaxations in PCA rings. SR 58611A-induced relaxation was almost abolished after removal of endothelium or pretreatment with L-NAME (a NO synthase inhibitor). The vasorelaxations induced by SR 58611A and celiprolol were inhibited in the presence of SR 59230A and L-748337 (2 selective \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor antagonists). We showed (i) that PCAs possess functional \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptors mediating endothelium- and NO-dependent relaxation, and (ii) that celiprolol exerts a \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor agonistic activity in this vascular bed.",

In this chapter, we describe the protocols used in our laboratory for the crystallization of rhodopsin and the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22-AR). For bovine rhodopsin, we developed a new purification strategy including a (NH4)2SO4-induced phase separation that proved essential to obtain crystals of photoactivated rhodopsin containing parallel dimers. Crystallization of native bovine rhodopsin was achieved by the classic vapor-diffusion technique. For \u03b22-AR, we developed a purification strategy based on previously published protocols employing a lipidic cubic phase to obtain diffracting crystals of a \u03b22-AR/T4-lysozyme chimera bound to the antagonist carazolol.",

    "205": "Antiarrhythmic prophylaxis does not affect the number of AF recurrences during the first 2 months after ablation. SR maintenance during a blanking period after AF ablation is a positive prognostic factor in long-term follow-up. Persistent AF and hypertension are independent risk factors for late AF recurrence after pulmonary vein isolation.", 
    "206": "Nebivolol, a beta-blocker, has been widely used for the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases; but has drawbacks like poor solubility and bioavailability requiring frequent dosing. The present study attempts to overcome these issues through nanoparticulate delivery system using widely used carrier Eudragit(\u00ae) RS100. The solvent evaporation (single emulsion) technique was used for developing nanoparticles. The impact of formulation and process variables on particle size and entrapment efficiency was studied to optimize the formulation. The physico-chemical characterization confirmed the particle size in nano range with smooth and spherical morphology. Further, Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies confirm compatibility of drug-polymer combination. The in vitro drug release study of the prepared nanoparticles showed prolongation of drug release with reduced burst release in comparison with pure drug powder.", 
    "207": "Adrenergic control of cardiovascular function is a common component of regulation in embryonic birds studied to date. Our goal was to investigate adrenergic and cholinergic cardiovascular regulation in two goose species, the Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and the related domestic goose (Anser anser domesticus) to determine if these species possess similar regulation during embryonic development. We determined mean arterial pressure (Pm) and heart rate (fH) responses to serial blockade of cholinergic, \u03b2-adrenergic and \u03b1-adrenergic receptors in B. canadensis and A. domesticus at 70 and 90% of total incubation (28days). Both species possessed cholinergic and \u03b2-adrenergic tone on fH at 70% of incubation that increased in intensity with development. In addition, a constant \u03b1-adrenergic tone on Pm was present in both species. Our findings indicate that these geese species possess both cholinergic and adrenergic cardiovascular regulation providing information needed for speculation regarding the commonalities in the ontogeny of these cardiovascular regulatory elements in birds.", 
    "208": "The incidence of heart failure (HF) is stable in industrialized countries, but its prevalence continues to increase, especially due to the ageing of the population, and mortality remains high.", 
    "209": "To estimate the incidence in France and describe the management and short-term outcome of patients hospitalized for HF for the first time.", 
    "210": "The study population comprised French national health insurance general scheme beneficiaries (77% of the French population) hospitalized in 2009 with a principal diagnosis of HF after exclusion of those hospitalized for HF between 2006 and 2008 or with a chronic disease status for HF. Data were collected from the national health insurance information system (SNIIRAM).", 
    "211": "A total of 69,958 patients (mean age 78 years; 48% men) were included. The incidence of first hospitalization for HF was 0.14% (\u2265 55 years, 0.5%; \u2265 90 years, 3.1%). Compared with controls without HF, patients more frequently presented cardiovascular or other co-morbidities. The hospital mortality rate was 6.4% and the mortality rate during the 30 days after discharge was 4.4% (3.4% without readmission). Among 30-day survivors, all-cause and HF 30-day readmission rates were 18% (< 70 years, 22%; \u2265 90 years, 13%) and 5%, respectively. Reimbursements among 30-day survivors comprised at least a beta-blocker in 54% of cases, diuretics in 85%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in 67%, a diuretic and ACEI/ARB combination in 23% and a beta-blocker, ACEI/ARB and diuretic combination in 37%.", 
    "212": "Patients admitted for HF presented high rates of co-morbidity, readmission and death at 30 days, and there remains room for improvement in their drug treatments; these findings indicate the need for improvement in return-home and therapeutic education programmes.", 
    "213": "Antihypertensive agents may, even within the same class, exert variable effects on arterial stiffness variables. Nebivolol could have a better impact than atenolol on arterial stiffness, by increasing the bioavailability of endothelium-derived nitric oxide. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increase plasma renin activity (enhancing the production of angiotensin II via non-ACE-related pathways) whereas aliskiren does not, potentially affecting central hemodynamics differently. We compared the effects of two renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (quinapril and aliskiren) and 2 beta-blockers (atenolol and nebivolol) on arterial stiffness variables. Treatment-na\u00efve patients (n = 72; 68.1% males; age, 47.6 \u00b1 10.6 years) with uncomplicated stage I-II essential hypertension were randomly assigned to quinapril, aliskiren, atenolol, or nebivolol for 10 weeks. Central systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), central pulse pressure (PP), augmentation index (AIx), and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were measured at baseline, 2, and 10 weeks. The same measurements were performed in 20 normotensive subjects (65.0% males; age, 40.0 \u00b1 8.9 years). Peripheral and central systolic and diastolic BP, peripheral PP, and PWV were significantly and similarly reduced by all agents. However, PWV continued to decline between the second and last visit in patients on quinapril and aliskiren but did not change in those on nebivolol or atenolol. Central PP and AIx decreased in patients on quinapril, aliskiren, and nebivolol but did not change in those taking atenolol. The decrease in central PP and AIx did not differ between patients on quinapril, aliskiren, and nebivolol. Despite similar reductions in peripheral BP, atenolol is less effective than nebivolol and RAAS inhibitors in improving central pulsatile hemodynamics. Aliskiren exerts similar effects on markers of arterial stiffness as quinapril. The clinical relevance of these differences remains to be established.", 
    "214": "To date, racial differences in the long-term survival of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients who receive preoperative \u03b2-blockers have not been specifically examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of preoperative \u03b2-blockers on long-term survival among black CABG patients and to compare the magnitude of this effect with white patients.",

A total of 1,448 (62%) black and 6,094 (55%) white patients had a history of preoperative \u03b2-blocker use. Among black patients, those receiving \u03b2-blockers survived longer than those not receiving \u03b2-blockers (adjusted HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.67-0.88). The survival advantage was comparable to that observed among white patients (adjusted HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.82-0.93).",

    "221": "Historical cohort study. A total of 18,117 women who gave birth in a Saskatchewan hospital between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 2005 with a diagnosis of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy were identified and included in the analysis.", 
    "222": "The rate of treatment with antihypertensive drugs for pregnant women with chronic hypertension rose from 19.94% in 1980-1984 to 37.63% in 2000-2005. There were similar increases in antihypertensive drug use from 1.51% to 14.47% for gestational hypertension/non-severe preeclampsia, and from 1.56% to 20.86% for severe preeclampsia/eclampsia. Methyldopa was the most frequently used drug, followed by beta-blockers, with other antihypertensive drugs accounting for about 18.43% of total uses. The use of both methyldopa and labetalol has increased in recent years while the use of other antihypertensive drugs has decreased. Other antihypertensive drugs were more commonly prescribed in earlier gestation, while methyldopa and labetalol were generally prescribed in later gestation.", 
    "223": "The use of antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy is relatively common and is increasing, with the liberal use of methyldopa and (especially) labetalol contributing appreciably to this increase."
