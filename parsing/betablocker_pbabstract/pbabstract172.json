Electronic Veterans Affairs pharmacy data, clinical data, and laboratory data from routine clinical care were used to compare the new measure, ReComp, with standard reference measures of medication gaps (MEDOUT) and adherence or oversupply (MEDSUM) in 3 different repeated measures medication adherence-response analyses. These analyses examined the change in low density lipoprotein (LDL) with simvastatin use, blood pressure with antihypertensive use, and heart rate with beta-blocker use for 30- and 90-day intervals. Measures were compared by regression based correlations (R2 values) and graphical comparisons of average medication adherence-response curves.",

After extensive in vitro testing of the pump in a passive-filling, mock circulatory loop, an acute animal study was performed to obtain data with a contracting ventricle. The objectives were to determine the range of pneumatic pressures and time required to completely fill and empty the pediatric ventricular assist device under various physiologic conditions, simulate reductions in ventricular contractility and blood volume, and provide data for validation of the mock circulatory loop. A 15-kg goat was used. The cannulation was achieved via left thoracotomy from the left ventricle to the descending aorta. The pump rate and systolic duration were controlled manually to maintain complete filling and ejection. The mean ejection time ranged from 280 ms to 382 ms when the systolic pressure ranged from 350 mm Hg to 200 mm Hg. The mean filling time ranged from 352 ms to 490 ms, for the diastolic pressure range of -60 mm Hg to 0 mm Hg. Esmolol produced a decrease in left ventricular pressure, required longer pump filling time, and reduced LVAD flow.",

Although the device has been shown to effectively restore circulatory parameters in acute heart failure sheep, the impact of device inflation on left ventricular geometry is yet to be elucidated. This study used sonomicrometer crystal transducers to examine three orthogonal left ventricular dimensions under various cardiac states and assessed the feasibility of determining stroke volume from these dimensions. Seven sheep (weight, 51 +/- 5 kg) were implanted with six sonomicrometer crystals, and a heart patch was placed on each of the ventricles. The crystals were positioned to measure anterior-posterior, septal-lateral, and apex-base (long-axis) dimensions. Sheep were studied under both awake and anesthetized conditions. Septal-lateral shortening was increased with direct cardiac compression assist, whereas anterior-posterior and long-axis dimensions were either unchanged (awake) or decreased (anesthetized). Estimation of stroke volume, using the ellipsoid volume model, correlated well with stroke volume measured from an aortic flow probe; however, absolute stroke volumes were lacking in agreement.",

However, whether beta-blockers actually reduce the myocardial infarction size is still in dispute. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can accurately depict the left ventricular (LV) ischemic myocardium at risk (T2-weighted hyperintense region) early after myocardial infarction, as well as the extent of necrosis (delayed gadolinium enhancement). The aim of this study was to determine whether early administration of metoprolol could increase myocardial salvage, measured as the difference between the extent of myocardium at risk and myocardial necrosis.",

They were randomized to metoprolol (7.5 mg during myocardial infarction) or placebo.

Despite similar extent of myocardium at risk in metoprolol- and placebo-treated pigs (30.9% of LV versus 30.6%; P=NS), metoprolol resulted in 5-fold-larger salvaged myocardium (32.4% versus 6.2% of myocardium at risk; P=0.015). The LV ejection fraction significantly improved in metoprolol-treated pigs between days 4 and 22 (37.2% versus 43.0%; P=0.037), whereas it remained unchanged in pigs treated with placebo (35.1% versus 35.0%; P=NS). The extent of myocardial salvage was related directly to LV ejection fraction improvement (P=0.031) and regional LV wall motion recovery (P=0.039) at day 22.",

    "13": "Gastric cancer was detected in a 71-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis. According to ACC/AHA guidelines, aortic stenosis in the patient was so severe that noncardiac surgery was considered appropriate only after aortic valve replacement. However, due to uncontrollable hemorrhage from gastric cancer, total gastrectomy was urgently required. Surgery was performed under epidural and general anesthesia. Blood pressure and heart rate were stable during anesthetic induction, tracheal intubation and skin incision. Just after peritoneal incision, however, ST decreased significantly following hypertension and sinus tachycardia, which were controllable by deepening of the anesthetic level. This ST depression was dependent on heart rate but not blood pressure. Therefore, in order to control the heart rate and prevent myocardial ischemia, low dose landiolol was infused prophylactically. This agent regulated the heart rate below 85 beats per minute without inducing hypotension and prevented myocardial ischemia during the remaining anesthetic course including extubation and recovery from anesthesia. Although beta blocker is not generally recommended in patients with aortic stenosis, present case suggests that landiolol is effective and useful to prevent cardiac ischemia even in a patient with severe aortic stenosis.", 
    "14": "Anxiety has been indicated as one of the main symptoms of the cocaine withdrawal syndrome in human addicts and severe anxiety during withdrawal may potentially contribute to relapse. As alterations in noradrenergic transmission in limbic areas underlie withdrawal symptomatology for many drugs of abuse, the present study sought to determine the effect of cocaine withdrawal on beta-adrenergic receptor (beta(1) and beta(2)) expression in the amygdala.", 
    "15": "Male Sprague Dawley rats were administered intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of cocaine (20 mg/kg) once daily for 14 days. Two days following the last cocaine injection, amygdala brain regions were micro-dissected and processed for Western blot analysis. Results showed that beta(1)-adrenergic receptor, but not beta(2)-adrenergic receptor expression was significantly increased in amygdala extracts of cocaine-withdrawn animals as compared to controls. This finding motivated further studies aimed at determining whether treatment with betaxolol, a highly selective beta(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist, could ameliorate cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety. In these studies, betaxolol (5 mg/kg via i.p. injection) was administered at 24 and then 44 h following the final chronic cocaine administration. Anxiety-like behavior was evaluated using the elevated plus maze test approximately 2 h following the last betaxolol injection. Following behavioral testing, betaxolol effects on beta(1)-adrenergic receptor protein expression were examined by Western blotting in amygdala extracts from rats undergoing cocaine withdrawal.", 
    "16": "Animals treated with betaxolol during cocaine withdrawal exhibited a significant attenuation of anxiety-like behavior characterized by increased time spent in the open arms and increased entries into the open arms compared to animals treated with only saline during cocaine withdrawal. In contrast, betaxolol did not produce anxiolytic-like effects in control animals treated chronically with saline. Furthermore, treatment with betaxolol during early cocaine withdrawal significantly decreased beta(1)-adrenergic receptor protein expression in the amygdala to levels comparable to those of control animals.", 
    "17": "The present findings suggest that the anxiolytic-like effect of betaxolol on cocaine-induced anxiety may be related to its effect on amygdalar beta(1)-adrenergic receptors that are up-regulated during early phases of drug withdrawal. These data support the efficacy of betaxolol as a potential effective pharmacotherapy in treating cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety during early phases of abstinence.", 
    "18": "Erectile function is critically dependent upon the activation of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the smooth muscle cells of penile corpus cavernosum tissue. Nebivolol is a beta(1)-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker (beta-ARB) with additional vasodilating properties, which have been attributed to eNOS-activation. Our study investigated whether nebivolol is able to increase eNOS activity in erectile tissue. Murine penile tissue was incubated in an organ bath under control conditions and in the presence of nebivolol or metoprolol. Immunofluorescence staining was performed using specific antibodies against eNOS-activation or eNOS-serine 1177 phosphorylation. Corpus cavernosum smooth muscle tissue was identified using a smooth muscle actin antibody. In addition, slices of murine erectile tissue were incubated with diaminofluorescein (DAF), a specific fluorescence marker for NO-liberation. Under control conditions and after application of metoprolol, we observed a small eNOS-activation and serine 1177-phosphorylation in murine corpus cavernosum tissue. A significant increase in eNOS-activation and serine 1177-phosphorylation of eNOS was observed only in the presence of nebivolol (10 muM). These alterations of the eNOS protein induced after application of nebivolol were associated with a time-dependent increase in DAF fluorescence in murine erectile tissue. We conclude that beta-adrenoceptor blockers differentially influence erectile tissue. Since cardiovascular diseases are often associated with the development of erectile dysfunction, the nebivolol-induced eNOS-activation in corpus cavernosum may be beneficial when treating patients suffering from cardiovascular disease.", 
    "19": "Although dopamine (DA) has been implicated in the psychostimulant properties of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), there is no detailed information on its modalities of action on single ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons.", 
    "20": "We examined the actions of MDMA on intracellularly recorded dopaminergic neurons maintained in slices.", 
    "21": "At 1 micromol/L, MDMA depolarized and excited the cells; at 3 micromol/L, either excited or inhibited the neurons. Interestingly, higher concentrations (10-30 micromol/L) inhibited firing through membrane hyperpolarization or caused an outward current. Whereas MDMA's excitatory effects were antagonized by pindolol, indicating involvement of 5-HT 1B receptors, the inhibitory effects were counteracted by sulpiride indicating involvement D2 receptors. Treatment of the cells with carbidopa eliminated MDMA-induced firing inhibition and membrane hyperpolarization. MDMA enhanced DA-induced cellular responses but reduced those of amphetamine. Cocaine-induced outward currents were not affected by MDMA. These actions are consistent with inhibition of the DA transporter. Moreover, MDMA depressed the GABA(B) IPSP by activating 5-HT 1B receptors.", 
    "22": "Our data demonstrate that 3-30 micromol/L MDMA preferentially inhibits the dopaminergic cells via indirect activation of D2 autoreceptors due to increased extracellular concentration of DA. In contrast, reduction of the GABA(B) IPSP could partially account for excitation caused by 1-3 micromol/L drug.", 
    "23": "Apoptosis is a contributing cause of dopaminergic neuron loss in Parkinson disease. Recent work has shown that erythropoietin (EPO) offers protection against apoptosis in a wide variety of tissues. We demonstrate that exposure of PC12 cells to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+)) with recombinant human EPO, significantly decreased apoptosis as measured by TUNEL and caspase-3 activity when compared to MPP(+) treatment alone. EPO induced sustained phosphorylation of Akt and its substrate, GSK-3beta, reduced caspase-3 activities in PC12 cells. The anti-apoptotic effect of EPO was abrogated by co-treatment with LY294002, the specific blocker of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The effects of EPO on GSK-3beta and caspase-3 activities were also blocked by LY294002. LiCl, the inhibitor of GSK-3beta, downregulated the caspase-3 activity and blocked the apoptosis induced by MPP(+). Finally, we determined that EPO transiently activated the ERK signaling pathway, but PD98059, a specific inhibitor of ERK, does not alter the survival effect of EPO in this model system. Thus, these findings indicate that EPO protects against apoptosis in PC12 cells exposed to MPP(+), through the Akt/GSK-3beta/caspase-3 signaling pathway, but the ERK pathway is not involved in the EPO-dependent survival enhancing effect in this model system.",

Fifteen formulations were developed with varying concentrations of polymers. Formulations of the BC or BD series were composed of HPMC K4M or HPMC K15M in ratios of 1:1 to 1:5 whereas in the BE series Carbopol 934 was used (1:0.25 to 1:1.50). The formulations were tested for in vitro drug release, in vitro bioadhesion, moisture absorption and in vitro drug permeation through porcine buccal mucosa. Formulation BC3 showed maximum release of the drug (88.7 +/- 0.4%) with the Higuchi model release profile and permeated 21.5 +/- 2.9% of the drug (flux 8.35 +/- 0.291 microg h(-1)cm(-2)) permeation coefficient 1.34 +/- 0.05 cm h(-1)) through porcine buccal membrane. BC3 formulation showed 1.62 +/- 0.15 N of peak detachment force and 0.24 +/- 0.11 mJ of work of adhesion. FTIR results showed no evidence of interaction between the drug and polymers. XRD study revealed that the drug is in crystalline form in the polymer matrix. The results indicate that suitable bioadhesive buccal tablets with desired permeability could be prepared.",

Moisture vapour transmission through the patches followed zero-order kinetics. In vitro permeation studies were performed using a K-C diffusion cell across hairless guinea pig skin and followed the super case II transport mechanism. The effects of non-ionic surfactants Tween 80 and Span 80 on drug permeation were studied. The nonionic surfactants in the patches increased the permeation rate, Span 80 exhibiting better enhancement relative to Tween 80. The patches were seemingly free of potentially hazardous skin irritation.",

Such medication reduces cardiac output and cerebral blood flow. It is unknown whether the beta(1)-adrenergic blockade-induced reduction of cardiac output in the presence of an exercise-induced reduction in cardiac-arterial baroreflex gain affects cerebral blood flow variability. This study evaluated the influence of cardiac output variability on beat-to-beat middle cerebral artery mean blood velocity (MCA V(mean)) during exercise with and without cardiac beta(1)-adrenergic blockade.",

The relationship between changes in cardiac output or mean arterial pressure (MAP) and MCA V(mean) as well as cardiac-arterial baroreflex gain were evaluated using transfer function analysis.", 
    "30": "Both exercise intensities decreased the low frequency (LF) transfer function gain between cardiac output and MCA V(mean) (P < 0.05) with no significant influence of beta(1)-blockade. In contrast, the LF transfer function gain between MAP and MCA V(mean) remained stable also with no significant influence of metoprolol (P > 0.05). The LF transfer function gain between MAP and HR, an index of cardiac-arterial baroreflex gain, decreased from rest to heavy exercise with and without beta(1)-blockade (P < 0.05).", 
    "31": "These findings suggest that the exercise intensity related reduction in cardiac-arterial baroreflex function at its operating point does not influence the dynamic control of MCA V(mean), even when the ability of exercise-induced increase in cardiac output is reduced by cardiac beta(1)-adrenergic blockade.",

    "36": "Progressive, irreversible fibrosis is one of the most clinically significant consequences of ionizing radiation on normal tissue. When applied to lungs, it leads to a complication described as idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and eventually to organ fibrosis. For its high mortality, the condition precludes treatment with high doses of radiation. There is widespread interest to understand the pathogenetic mechanisms of IPS and to find drugs effective in the prevention of its development. This report summarizes our experience with the protective effects of L 158,809, an angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor blocker, and two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the development of IPS and the role of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and of alpha-actomyosin (alpha SMA) in pathogenesis of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis in an experimental model of bone marrow transplant (BMT). Male WAG/Riji/MCV rats received total body irradiation and a regimen of cyclophosphamide (CTX) in preparation for bone marrow transplant. While one group of animals remained untreated, the remainders were subdivided into three groups, each of them receiving either the ANG II receptor blocker or one of the two ACE inhibitors (Captopril or Enalapril). Each of the three drugs was administered orally from 11 days before the transplant up to 56 days post transplant. At sacrifice time the irradiated rats receiving only CTX showed a chronic pneumonitis with septal fibrosis and vasculitis affecting, in particular, small caliber pulmonary arteries and arterioles. Their lung content of hydroxyproline was also markedly elevated in association with the lung concentrations of thromboxane (TXA2) and prostaglandin (PGI(2)), (two markers of pulmonary endothelial damage). A significant increase of alpha actomyosin staining was observed in vessels, septa and macrophages of the same animals which also overexpressed TGF-beta. When L 158,809, Captopril and Enalapril were added to the radiation and cytoxan treatment, a significant amelioration of the histological damage as well as the overexpression of alpha SMA was observed. Lung concentrations of hydroxyproline, PGI(2), TXA2 and TGF-beta were also observed in these animals so that the values of these compounds were closer to those measured in untreated control rats than to their irradiated and cytoxan treated counterparts. Angiotensin II plays an important role in the regulation of TGF-beta and alpha SMA, two proteins involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. The finding that ACE inhibitors or ANG II receptor blockers protect the lungs from radiation induced pneumonitis and fibrosis reaffirms the role that ANG II plays in this inflammatory process and suggests an additional indication of treatment of this condition, thus opening a new potential pharmacologic use of these drugs.", 
    "37": "Several epidemiological studies showed that heart rate is associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate in the general population and in subjects affected by different cardiovascular diseases. Particularly relevant is the role of heart rate in patients with stable angina, a clinical condition that affects mainly 40 000 patients per one million people. The treatment of stable angina is focused more on symptom improvement than on decrease of mortality. In this context, beta-blockers are usually recommended for these patients, since, reducing heart rate and blood pressure, favorably influence clinical symptoms. However, data from registries show that nearly one third of patients with stable angina do not receive beta-blockers for specific contraindications or intolerance. For these patients, new perspectives of treatment might be available with the use of a new class of drugs, the inhibitors of the I(f) channels, which selectively reduce heart rate without interfering with other pathophysiological mechanisms.", 
    "38": "The use of cardiovascular medications can have a variety of neuropsychiatric consequences. Many cardiovascular agents cause higher rates of fatigue and sedation than placebo, and case reports of medication-induced mood syndromes, psychosis, and cognitive disturbances exist for many cardiovascular drugs. Depression has been associated with P3-blockers, methyldopa, and reserpine, but more recent syntheses of the data have suggested that these associations are much weaker than originally believed. Though low cholesterol levels have been associated with depression and suicide, lipid-lowering agents have not been associated with these adverse effects. Finally, cardiovascular medications may have beneficial neuropsychiatric consequences; for example, the use of clonidine in patients with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, the use of prazosin for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder; and the use of propranolol for performance anxiety and akathisia.",

    "43": "Norepinephrine (NE) uptake and NE receptor mechanisms play important modulating roles in the discriminative stimulus and stimulant effects of cocaine. The present study investigated the role of NE mechanisms in cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of extinguished drug seeking. Squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) were trained to stability under a second-order fixed interval, fixed ratio schedule of drug self-administration in which operant responding was maintained jointly by i.v. cocaine injections and presentations of a cocaine-paired stimulus. Drug seeking was then extinguished by replacing cocaine with vehicle and eliminating the cocaine-paired stimulus. In test sessions during which the cocaine-paired stimulus was reintroduced but only vehicle was available for self-administration, priming with cocaine, the dopamine transport inhibitor 1-[2-[bis-(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine (GBR 12909), and the NE transport inhibitors nisoxetine and talsupram induced dose-dependent reinstatement of drug seeking. The maximum effect of the NE transport inhibitors was less than half that of cocaine. Both nisoxetine and talsupram augmented the priming effects of a low but not a high dose of cocaine. The priming effects of nisoxetine were blocked by the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, but not by the dopamine receptor antagonist flupenthixol. The priming effects of cocaine were antagonized by clonidine and flupenthixol. Neither nisoxetine nor cocaine increased physiological (salivary cortisol) or behavioral (self-directed behaviors) markers of stress. These findings suggest that NE transporter inhibition and alpha2-adrenoceptor mechanisms play a significant role in cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug seeking that is not secondary to activation of brain stress pathways.", 
    "44": "Glucagon, secreted from pancreatic islet alpha cells, stimulates gluconeogenesis and liver glycogen breakdown. The mechanism regulating glucagon release is debated, and variously attributed to neuronal control, paracrine control by neighbouring beta cells, or to an intrinsic glucose sensing by the alpha cells themselves. We examined hormone secretion and Ca(2+) responses of alpha and beta cells within intact rodent and human islets. Glucose-dependent suppression of glucagon release persisted when paracrine GABA or Zn(2+) signalling was blocked, but was reversed by low concentrations (1-20 muM) of the ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channel opener diazoxide, which had no effect on insulin release or beta cell responses. This effect was prevented by the KATP channel blocker tolbutamide (100 muM). Higher diazoxide concentrations (>/=30 muM) decreased glucagon and insulin secretion, and alpha- and beta-cell Ca(2+) responses, in parallel. In the absence of glucose, tolbutamide at low concentrations (<1 muM) stimulated glucagon secretion, whereas high concentrations (>10 muM) were inhibitory. In the presence of a maximally inhibitory concentration of tolbutamide (0.5 mM), glucose had no additional suppressive effect. Downstream of the KATP channel, inhibition of voltage-gated Na(+) (TTX) and N-type Ca(2+) channels (omega-conotoxin), but not L-type Ca(2+) channels (nifedipine), prevented glucagon secretion. Both the N-type Ca(2+) channels and alpha-cell exocytosis were inactivated at depolarised membrane potentials. Rodent and human glucagon secretion is regulated by an alpha-cell KATP channel-dependent mechanism. We propose that elevated glucose reduces electrical activity and exocytosis via depolarisation-induced inactivation of ion channels involved in action potential firing and secretion.",

In this study, we investigated the role of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in fluid absorption in normal human middle ear epithelial (NHMEE) cells, as well as the effects of Interleukin (IL)-1beta on ENaC expression and fluid absorption in NHMEE cells. We confirmed that ENaC alpha, beta and gamma were predominantly expressed on the apical surface of the NHMEE cells by immunocytochemistry. Addition of amiloride, a potent ENaC blocker, to apical membranes of NHMEE cells decreased the fluid absorption rate in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with 10 ng/ml IL-1beta for 24 h suppressed ENaC beta expression, the ENaC-dependent short-circuit current (Isc), and ENaC-dependent fluid absorption. When the NHMEE cells were pretreated with a phospholipase C (PLC)inhibitor (U73122, 10 microM), a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (Calphostin C, 0.1 microM), or extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 inhibitor (PD98059, 10 microM), the amiloride-sensitive currents in IL-1beta-treated cells were reversed to control levels; an effect not seen with SB202190 (an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase) or SP600125 (a reversible inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase). In this study we showed that ENaC is essential for fluid absorption in NHMEE cells and that IL-1beta suppresses the ENaC-dependent current via the PLC-PKC-ERK1/2 pathway. These results suggest that IL-1beta may contribute to fluid retention in otitis media with effusion by changing electrolyte transport and reducing middle ear epithelial fluid absorption.", 
    "74": "Adaptations to the chronic administration of opioids reduce the utility of these drugs in treating pain and support addiction. Recent genetics-based approaches have implicated the beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) in controlling some of these responses. We do not know, however, whether this receptor can modulate tolerance, dependence or changes in gene expression caused by chronic opioid administration. For our studies we used C57BL/6 mice and beta2-AR knockout mice in the FVB background. Morphine dose-response relationships were established both prior to and after chronic morphine treatment. In some cases, the selective beta2-AR antagonist butoxamine was administered along with or after morphine. Physical dependence was assessed using naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. The expression of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) were measured in spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissues using both real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Both the co-administration of butoxamine with morphine and the administration of butoxamine after chronic morphine reversed morphine tolerance. Morphine failed to cause tolerance in beta2-AR knockout mice. Physical dependence was reduced under the same circumstances. The chronic administration of butoxamine with morphine reduced or eliminated the normally observed up-regulation of CGRP and SP in spinal cord and DRG tissues. Our results suggest that the beta2-AR modulates both opioid tolerance and physical dependence. Activation of beta2-ARs appears to be required for some of the key neurochemical changes which characterize chronic opioid administration. Therefore, beta2-AR antagonists show some promise as agents to enhance chronic opioid analgesic therapy.",

How to select the right agent to provide the most beneficial results in terms of efficacy and improvement of quality of life as well as to decrease clinical symptoms and minimize adverse reactions is an important therapeutic challenge. It has been suggested that clinical usage of pattern (Zheng) diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine may improve the accuracy in selecting the right antihypertensive agents with improved efficacy and deceased adverse effects. Limited research in this area suggested the calcium channel blocker may work better in treating phlegmatic damp excess pattern and blood stasis pattern while beta-blockers may be more beneficial in the liver yang rising pattern.

This, together with limited trade-off between sensitivity and resolving power plus a wide dynamic range for mass accuracy, suggested that the LTQ/Orbitrap is an ideal analytical tool for structural elucidation of metabolites. The application of the LTQ/Orbitrap to identification of human liver microsomal metabolites of carvedilol was evaluated, using parent mass list triggered data-dependent multiple-stage accurate mass analysis, at a resolving power of 60,000 in external calibration mode. A metabolite identification workflow was developed to utilize chemical formulas from high-resolution accurate mass measurements to confirm structures of product ions of a drug proposed by Mass Frontier, illustrated by identification of structures used to establish lineage of product ions of carvedilol, which later served as a template for identification of its metabolites. A total of 58 in vitro metabolites of carvedilol were detected using 5-ppm mass tolerance filters for theoretical m/z of protonated molecules of predicted metabolites in addition to product ions and neutral mass losses diagnostic of carvedilol. The chemical formulas with unsaturation numbers calculated from the accurate m/z of precursor and product ions can be used to assign, with a high degree of confidence, the structures of metabolites and the sites of metabolism. The mass accuracies obtained for all full scan MS and MSn spectra were <2 ppm.

In patients with NCS, beta- and alpha- sensitivity were higher and beta-activity and beta- and alpha-secretion lower than in control subjects. In patients with NCS, the increased basic beta-sensitivity may contribute to induce strong cardiac contractions and augment ventricular mechanoreceptor response, and a compensatory state against diminished neuronal sympathetic activity is suggested by the increased alpha-sensitivity.",

Western blot analysis showed that CD38, an enzyme responsible for the production of cADPR, was abundant in As4.1 cells. Using cADPR cycling assay, it was found that NaCl stimulated cADPR production in these cells, which was blocked by inhibition of ADP-ribosyl cyclase with nicotinamide. HPLC analysis showed that the conversion rate of beta-NGD into cGDPR was dramatically increased by NaCl, which was attenuated by nicotinamide. Using fluorescent microscopic imaging analysis, NaCl (100 mM) was demonstrated to stimulate a rapid Ca(2+) increase from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which was inhibited by a cADPR antagonist, 8-bromo-cADPR (30 microM), an inhibitor of ADP-ribosyl cyclase, nicotinamide (6 mM), the ryanodine receptors blocker, ryanodine (30 microM), or a Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release inhibitor, tetracaine (10 microM) by 70-90%. Finally, NaCl was found to significantly lower the renin production and release levels in As4.1 cells, which was accompanied by decreases in renin mRNA levels. Pretreatment of these cells with various inhibitors or blockers above significantly blocked the inhibitory effect of NaCl on renin production and release. These results indicate that cADPR-mediated Ca(2+) signaling pathway is present in As4.1 cells and that this signaling pathway may play a contributing role in the regulation of renin production and release.",

Both afterload reduction and beta-adrenergic blockade have been suggested as methods for preventing LV dysfunction in asymptomatic patients with MR and normal LV function, who are therefore not yet candidates for surgical intervention. The objective of this study was to determine if afterload reduction reduces progression of LV dysfunction in patients with severe MR. The reports of echocardiographic studies performed 20 +/-14 months apart were compared in a retrospective cohort of 134 asymptomatic patients with moderate-severe chronic MR and baseline ejection fraction (LVEF) >50%. Groups were defined by exposure to any afterload-reducing drug: Group 0, no exposure; Group 1, exposure beginning after the first echocardiogram; and Group 2, drug exposure beginning before the baseline echocardiogram. The groups differed importantly only in treatment duration. In 72 patients not exposed to beta-adrenergic blockade, LVEF decreased by a relative -3.2% in Group 0, while Group 1 increased by 3.4% and Group 2 increased by 5.1%, p <0.01. Among 62 patients exposed to beta-adrenergic blockade, LVEF consistently worsened (Group 0, 4.8%; Group 1, -3.3%; Group 2, -1.7%; p = 0.71) compared to the 72 patients without beta-adrenergic blockade. In a multivariate model that included treatment duration and exposure to other medications, the beneficial effect of afterload reduction (p <0.03) and the deleterious effect of beta-adrenergic blockade (p < 0.02) were significant. Afterload reduction halted or reversed the progressive worsening of left ventricular function while beta-adrenergic blockade had a deleterious effect.",

Early studies suggested that the prophylactic perioperative beta-blockade could also reduce perioperative and long-term morbidity and mortality. The administration of beta-blockers to patients with coronary artery disease or with risk factors who undergo major noncardiac surgery is now recommended in the published guidelines. However, one recent meta-analysis and several new studies have not confirmed the postulated beneficial effects of perioperative betablockade and gave rise to an animated controversy. Until the finalization of ongoing large trials in the next two years, the decision to start prophylactic perioperative beta-blockade remains at the discretion of the responsible physicians. This decision should be based on the patient's risk, the type of surgery and on the consideration of potential interactions and side-effects of the selected beta-blocker.",

The probability of at least 10% lower risk (risk ratio </= 0.90), which could be considered to be of clinical interest, was 0.69.", 
    "114": "Taken together with the other observations of differences in effects, we conclude that the claim that all beta-adrenergic blockers are inferior drugs for hypertensive patients should be rejected. Atenolol is not representative of the beta-adrenergic blocker class of drugs as a whole and is thus not a suitable drug for comparisons with other antihypertensive drugs in terms of effect. The non-atenolol beta-adrenergic blockers should thus continue to be fundamental in antihypertensive drug treatments.", 
    "115": "For half a century, controlled hypotension has been used to reduce bleeding and the need for blood transfusions, and provide a satisfactory bloodless surgical field. It has been indicated in oromaxillofacial surgery (mandibular osteotomy, facial repair), endoscopic sinus or middle ear microsurgery, spinal surgery and other neurosurgery (aneurysm), major orthopaedic surgery (hip or knee replacement, spinal), prostatectomy, cardiovascular surgery and liver transplant surgery. Controlled hypotension is defined as a reduction of the systolic blood pressure to 80-90 mm Hg, a reduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 50-65 mm Hg or a 30% reduction of baseline MAP. Pharmacological agents used for controlled hypotension include those agents that can be used successfully alone and those that are used adjunctively to limit dosage requirements and, therefore, the adverse effects of the other agents. Agents used successfully alone include inhalation anaesthetics, sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, trimethaphan camsilate, alprostadil (prostaglandin E1), adenosine, remifentanil, and agents used in spinal anaesthesia. Agents that can be used alone or in combination include calcium channel antagonists (e.g. nicardipine), beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) [e.g. propranolol, esmolol] and fenoldopam. Agents that are mainly used adjunctively include ACE inhibitors and clonidine. New agents and techniques have been recently evaluated for their ability to induce effective hypotension without impairing the perfusion of vital organs. This development has been aided by new knowledge on the physiology of peripheral microcirculatory regulation. Apart from the adverse effects of major hypotension on the perfusion of vital organs, potent hypotensive agents have their own adverse effects depending on their concentration, which can be reduced by adjuvant treatment. Care with use limits the major risks of these agents in controlled hypotension; risks that are generally less important than those of transfusion or alternatives to transfusion. New hypotensive drugs, such as fenoldopam, adenosine and alprostadil, are currently being evaluated; however, they have disadvantages and a high treatment cost that limits their development in this indication. New techniques of controlled hypotension subscribe to the use of the natural hypotensive effect of the anaesthetic drug with regard to the definition of the ideal hypotensive agent. It must be easy to administer, have a short onset time, an effect that disappears quickly when administration is discontinued, a rapid elimination without toxic metabolites, negligible effects on vital organs, and a predictable and dose-dependent effect. Inhalation agents (isoflurane, sevoflurane) provide the benefit of being hypnotic and hypotensive agents at clinical concentrations, and are used alone or in combination with adjuvant agents to limit tachycardia and rebound hypertension, for example, inhibitors of the autonomic nervous system (clonidine, beta-blockers) or ACE inhibitors. When they are used alone, inhalation anaesthetics require high concentrations for a significant reduction in bleeding that can lead to hepatic or renal injury. The greatest efficacy and ease-of-use to toxicity ratio is for techniques of anaesthesia that associate analgesia and hypotension at clinical concentrations without the need for potent hypotensive agents. The first and oldest technique is epidural anaesthesia, but depending on the surgery, it is not always appropriate. The most recent satisfactory technique is a combination treatment of remifentanil with either propofol or an inhalation agent (isoflurane, desflurane or sevoflurane) at clinical concentrations. In light of the current literature, and because of their safety and ease of use, these two techniques are preferred.", 
    "116": "Studies are scant on the effects of short-term carvedilol treatment as an adjuvant to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. The objective of this study was to find the effects of short-term treatment of carvedilol on patients with ischemic LV systolic dysfunction (defined as LV ejection fraction (LVEF) <or=30% on 2D echocardiography) undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). There were 74 patients that received ACE inhibitor without any beta-blocker (control) and 67 patients that received carvedilol in addition to ACE inhibitor following CABG (carvedilol group). After 1 month of drug administration following CABG, the control group was found to have significantly greater percent improvement in LVEF (29.1% +/- 5.39%) as compared with the carvedilol group (15.3% +/- 4.89%). However, after 3 and 6 months, LVEF levels were found to be significantly greater in the carvedilol group as compared with the control group. Further, at 6 months of drug administration, LV end systolic diameter was significantly less in the carvedilol group (39.11 +/- 1.10 mm) as compared with the control group (43.49 +/- 1.39 mm). Thus, carvedilol produces beneficial effect on short-term administration in terms of LV contractility when given along with ACE inhibitor as compared with ACE inhibitor therapy alone.",

However, the rates of discontinuation increased significantly during follow-up and, in men, reached 27% by 2 years and 42% by 5 years for beta-blockers. The rates of discontinuation of all four study drugs had a parabolic shape with the youngest and oldest patients having the highest rates.",

    "122": "Ten pigs received a 0.5 mg/kg bolus of propranolol IV followed by a continuous infusion. At the point of toxicity 20 ml/kg normal saline was rapidly infused and the propranolol drip continued at 0.125 mg/kg/min over four hours of resuscitation. Each pig was randomized to either IN/G or V/E. The V/E group began with epinephrine at 10 mcg/kg/min titrated up by 10 mcg/kg/min every 10 min to 50 mcg/kg/min or until baseline was obtained. Simultaneously, these pigs received vasopressin at 0.0028 units/kg/min, titrated upwards every 10 min to 0.014 units/kg/min or until baseline was obtained. The IN/G group began with a 2 units/kg/hr drip and increased by 2 units every 10 minutes to 10 units/kg/hr, or until baseline hemodynamics were obtained. CO, SVR, systolic blood pressure, HR, MAP, glucose, and potassium were monitored. Glucose was given for values <60 mg/dl.", 
    "123": "The study was terminated early due to marked survival differences after five pigs were entered in each group. All IN/G group pigs survived four hours. All V/E group pigs died within 90 min. CO in the IN/G group increased throughout the four hours, rising above pre-propranolol levels, while MAP, SBP, and SVR all trended slightly downward. CO in the V/E group dropped until death, while MAP, SBP, and SVR rose precipitously until 30-60 minutes when these dropped abruptly until death. Glucose was required in the IN/G group.", 
    "124": "In this swine model, IN/G is superior to V/E to treat beta-blocker toxicity. IN/G has marked inotropic properties while the vasopressor effects of V/E depress CO and contribute to death. Increasing SVR in this condition is detrimental to survival.", 
    "125": "Our previous study demonstrated that periostin, an extracellular matrix protein, plays an important role in left ventricular remodeling through the inhibition of cell-cell interactions. Because the gene regulation of periostin has not yet been examined, we focused on the effects of angiotensin (Ang) II and mechanical stretch, because Ang II and mechanical stretch are related to cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction. First, we examined the effects of Ang II on periostin in myocytes and fibroblasts in vitro. Ang II significantly increased periostin through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathways in myocytes and fibroblasts (P<0.05). On the other hand, mechanical stretch also significantly increased periostin expression (P<0.05). This increase was inhibited partially, but significantly, by an Ang II receptor blocker, valsartan, and inhibited almost completely by valsartan with the neutralization antibodies for transforming growth factor-beta and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (P<0.05). Therefore, we further examined periostin expression in vivo. Periostin expression was significantly increased in infarcted myocardium (P<0.05), and treatment with valsartan significantly attenuated it at 4 weeks after myocardial infarction (P<0.05), accompanied by a significant improvement in cardiac dysfunction (P<0.05). Overall, the present study demonstrated that Ang II, as well as mechanical stretch, stimulated periostin expression in both cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, whereas valsartan significantly attenuated the increase in periostin expression. The inhibition of periostin by valsartan might especially contribute to its beneficial effects on cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction.",

Payment is subsequently based on where a hospital or physician ranks among peers. This study examines the variability of ranking hospitals on quality of care measures and its impact on comparing hospital performance. Variability in the ranks of 3 quality of care measures was examined: discharge instruction for congestive heart failure, use of beta-blockers at discharge for heart attack, and timing of initial antibiotic therapy within 4 hours of admission to the hospital for pneumonia. The data are available on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Web site as part of the Hospital Quality Alliance project. We found that considerable uncertainty exists in ranking of hospitals on these measures, which calls into question the use of rank ordering as a determinant of performance.",

Cardiac ultrasonography shew an apical akinesis. Coronary angiography didn't show significant coronary lesion. A moderate elevation of troponine was noted but no significant elevation of CPK. The prognosis has been excellent for these 2 patients. We observed a ventricular tachycardia due to QT lengthening in 1 case treated anteriorly by Fleca\u00efn which spontaneously resolved. The first month, the electrocardiogram and cardiac ultrasonography anomalies disappeared totally. The treatment is based on beta-blockers, aspirin, statines, ACE. In the two cases, we didn't find arguments for myocarditis, recanalized thrombosis, coronary spasm, pheochromocytomas, but a risk factor is inboth: emotional stress.

    "132": "Airway submucosal gland cell (SMGC) secretions are under the control of various neurotransmitters and hormones. Interactions between different pathways, such as those mediated by cAMP and Ca(2+), in controlling mucus or electrolyte secretions are not well understood. Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) or forskolin has been shown to enhance acetylcholine (ACh)-induced short circuit current (I(SC)) in SMGC mucous cell monolayers. We show that PGE(2), by activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), enhanced ACh-induced, Ca(2+)-mediated current and changes in [Ca(2+)](i) in mucous cells. PGE(2) pretreatment sensitized ACh-induced I(SC) (DeltaI(SC)) by activating endoprostanoid (EP(2)) receptors. PKA inhibitors 14-22 amide PKI (PKI) and Rp-diastereomer (Rp) of cAMPs prevented the effect of PGE(2). Removing external Ca(2+) or pretreatment with the Ca(2+) entry blocker, SKF96365 [1-[beta-(3-(4-methoxyphenyl) propoxy)-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-imidazole hydrochloride1-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl) propoxy] ethyl] imidazole], shifted the concentration-response relationships for ACh to the right but did not abolish PGE(2)-induced sensitization of the ACh response. An inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptor antagonist and Ca(2+) entry blocker, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, abolished the ACh-induced response. Charybdotoxin, but not iberiotoxin (IbTX), inhibited the ACh-induced DeltaI(SC). Clotrimazole, but not IbTX, inhibited the ACh-induced serosal K(+) current. Under whole-cell patch clamp, ACh-induced K(+) and Cl(-) currents were coincident with increases in [Ca(2+)](i) in single mucous cells. PGE(2) or forskolin pretreatment did not induce current or [Ca(2+)](i) changes but enhanced ACh-induced currents, membrane hyperpolarization, and [Ca(2+)](i) changes. Intra-cellular dialysis with the PKA-catalytic subunit enhanced ACh-induced whole-cell current as well. These findings demonstrate that PGE(2), via EP(2) receptors and the cAMP/PKA pathway, activates Ca(2+) entry-independent mechanisms, possibly by increasing IP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) release, resulting in the sensitization of ACh-induced currents.",

    "134": "Laxative effects of Senna preparations are mainly mediated by rheinanthrone, a metabolite formed in the intestinal flora from dianthrones. Nevertheless, it was not clear whether dianthrones are bioavailable at all and contribute to the overall effects of this important medicinal plant. Using the Caco-2 human colonic cell line as an in vitro model of the human intestinal mucosal barrier, the bioavailability of dianthrones was studied in apical to basolateral (absorptive) and basolateral to apical (secretive) direction. Permeability coefficients (P(c)) and percent transport were calculated based on quantitations by HPLC. From the data obtained it was concluded that sennosides A and B, as well as their aglycones sennidine A and B are transported through the Caco-2 monolayers in a concentration-dependent manner and their transport was linear with time. The absorption in apical to basolateral direction was poor and P(c) values were comparable to mannitol. The transport was higher in the secretory direction, indicating a significant efflux (e.g. by efflux pumps) of the (poorly) absorbed compounds in the intestinal lumen again. Our findings support the general understanding that the laxative effects of Senna are explainable mainly by metabolites and not by the natively present dianthrones.", 
    "135": "A growing number of studies show strong associations between stress and altered immune function. In vivo studies of chronic and acute stress have demonstrated that cognitive stressors are strongly correlated with high levels of catecholamines (CT) and corticosteroids (CS). Although both CS and CT individually can inhibit the production of T-helper 1 (TH1, type-1 like) cytokines and simultaneously promote the production of T-helper 2 (TH2, type-2 like) cytokines in antigen-specific and mitogen stimulated human leukocyte cultures in vitro, little attention has been focused on the effects of combination CT and CS in immune responses that may be more physiologically relevant. We therefore investigated the combined effects of in vitro CT and CS upon the type-1/type-2 cytokine balance of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as a model to study the immunomodulatory effects of superimposed acute and chronic stress. Results demonstrated a significant decrease in type-1 cytokine production (IFN-gamma) and a significant increase in type-2 cytokine production (IL-4, IL-10) in our CS+CT incubated cultures when compared to either CT or CS agents alone. Furthermore, variable enhancement of type-1/type-2 immune deviation occurred depending upon when the CT was added. The data suggest that CS can increase the sensitivity of PBMC to the immunomodulatory effects of CT and establishes an in vitro model to study the combined effects of in vivo type-1/type-2 cytokine alterations observed in acute and chronic stress.", 
    "136": "In this work, six amino acid derived (L-leucinol, L-leucine, L-isoleucinol, L-isoleucine, L-valinol, and L-valine) polymeric chiral surfactants with carboxylate and sulfate head groups that were recently synthesized in our laboratory [30, 33, 35] are compared for the simultaneous enantioseparation of several groups of structurally similar analytes under neutral and basic pH conditions. The physicochemical properties of the monomers and polymers of both classes of sulfated and carboxylated surfactants are compared. In addition, cryogenic high-resolution electron microscopy showed tubular structures with distinct order of the tubes of 50-100 nm width. A Plackett-Burmann experimental design is used to study the factors that influence the chiral resolution and analysis time of ten structurally related phenylethylamines (PEAs). It is observed that increasing the number of hydroxy groups on the benzene ring of the PEAs resulted in deterioration of enantioseparation using any of the six polymeric surfactants. For all three classes of PEAs, polysodium N-undecenoxycarbonyl-L-amino acidate (poly-L-SUCAA)-type surfactants provided enhanced resolution compared to that of polysodium N-undecenoxycarbonyl-L-amino acid sulfates (poly-L-SUCAASS). Several classes of basic and neutral chiral compounds (e.g., beta-blockers benzoin derivatives, PTH-amino acids, and benzodiazepines) also provided improved chiral separations with poly-L-SUCAA. Among the poly-L-SUCAAs, polysodium N-undecenoxycarbonyl-L-isoleucine sulfate (poly--SUCL) exhibited overall the best enantioseparation capability for the investigated basic and neutral compounds, while among the poly-L-SUCAASs, polysodium N-undecenoxycarbonyl-L-isoleucine sulfate (poly-L-SUCILS), and polysodium N-undecenoxycarbonyl-L-valine sulfate (poly-L-SUCVS) proved to be equally effective for enantioseparation. This work clearly demonstrates that variation in the head group of polymeric alkenoxy amino acid surfactants has a significant effect on chiral separations.",

    "141": "In cultured human intimal SMCs, histamine increased NO production, iNOS expression, and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, which were inhibited by histamine H1 blocker and NF-kappaB inhibitor. Luciferase assay using -8.3 kb upstream of human iNOS promoter region and electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggested that a NF-kappaB motif located at -3922 to -3914 would be necessary for histamine-inducible promoter activity. In addition, H1 blocker, NF-kappaB inhibitor, and dominant negative IkappaB alpha or IkappaB kinase beta downregulated the histamine-induced iNOS promoter activity. In the human aorta, histamine content was estimated to be 310+/-66 pmol/mg protein in the atherosclerotic intima, while that was to be 43+/-22 pmol/mg protein in the media (P<0.001).",

    "143": "Although much is known about the value of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) at rest, the significance of the responsiveness of BNP during exercise in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) without coronary artery disease remains to be established. A role of BNP release during exercise in the functional disability of patients with chronic HF and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) was hypothesized. One hundred five consecutive patients with an established diagnosis of HF and IDC who underwent symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing were studied. BNP was measured immediately before exercise and within 1 minute of the end of exercise. BNP at rest increased significantly at peak exercise (median from 66.5 (first, third quartiles 18, 168) to 72.0 pg/ml (26, 208), p <0.001), but BNP response was not uniform. BNP response increased in 63% of patients, did not change in 22%, and decreased in 15%. BNP at rest and BNP response showed an inverse correlation (p <0.001, r = -0.523). Aging and low left ventricular ejection fraction were independent predictors of higher BNP levels at rest, but lower BNP response. Beta-blocker therapy did not influence BNP response. BNP at rest correlated negatively with functional capacity (p <0.001, r = -0.516), whereas BNP response correlated positively (p = 0.002, r = 0.326). Patients with BNP release (vs patients without) had higher maximum oxygen consumption (19.2 +/- 5.1 vs 15.9 +/- 3.6, p <0.001), better functional capacity (59 +/- 13% vs 50 +/- 15%, p = 0.002), and lower minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope (33.6 +/- 4.8 vs 36.5 +/- 7.7, p = 0.026) independent of other clinical parameters. In conclusion, BNP release during exercise could be a determinant of functional capacity in patients with chronic HF and IDC.", 
    "144": "Heart failure (HF) in the community differs meaningfully from that in clinical trials, particularly the higher prevalence of patients with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) typically excluded from clinical trials, thus limiting knowledge of their responsiveness to beta-blocker therapy. From a community-based registry of 4,280 patients with HF starting treatment with the beta blocker carvedilol, we compared characteristics, carvedilol titration, and outcomes of patients according to LVEF >40% or <40% (as in clinical trials) and across the spectrum of LVEF <21%, 21% to 30%, 31% to 40%, and >40%. Patients with preserved EF (LVEF >40%) were older and more often women and hypertensive. Lower LVEF was associated with worse functional class and more HF hospitalizations in the previous year. Carvedilol dose decreased with increasing LVEF. Hospitalization rates for HF related inversely to LVEF before starting carvedilol therapy and decreased from the previous year in all LVEF groups during follow-up. Although 1-year mortality rate decreased from 8% with LVEF < or =20% to 6% with LVEF >40%, adjusted hazard ratios were not significantly different across LVEF groups. Thus, characteristics of community patients with HF vary across the spectrum of LVEF. Patients with HF and preserved EF treated with carvedilol in the community improve symptomatically and experience fewer HF hospitalizations after initiating carvedilol. In conclusion, without a control group, the effect of carvedilol on outcomes is not conclusive and trials of carvedilol in patients with HF and preserved EF should be undertaken.", 
    "145": "The prognostic effect of beta-blocker treatment on ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) is controversially discussed in the era of reperfusion therapy. From the German multicenter registry Maximal Individual Therapy of Acute Myocardial Infarction PLUS (MITRA PLUS), 17,809 consecutive patients with STEMI treated with a guideline-recommended therapy with aspirin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor were investigated; the prognostic effect of additional acute beta-blocker treatment was analyzed. Patients with cardiogenic shock were excluded. Of included patients, 77.6% received additional acute beta-blocker treatment and 22.4% did not. Patients with beta-blocker treatment were younger and more often received reperfusion therapy. Acute beta-blocker treatment was associated with a lower hospital mortality (univariate analysis 4.9% vs 10.8%, p <0.001; multivariate analysis odds ratio [OR] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61 to 0.81). Acute beta blockade was significantly associated with a lower hospital mortality in patients without (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.79) and with (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98) reperfusion therapy. The greatest benefit of acute beta-blocker treatment, measured by the number needed to treat to save 1 life, was found in patients with anterior MI, a heart rate > or =80 beats/min, no reperfusion therapy, female gender, and age > or =65 years. In conclusion, acute beta-blocker therapy in the clinical practice of treating patients with STEMI, in addition to aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, was independently associated with a significant decrease in hospital mortality in patients with and without reperfusion therapy. High-risk patients with STEMI, such as elderly patients and patients without reperfusion therapy, showed a greater benefit of acute beta-blocker therapy than low-risk patients with STEMI.", 
    "146": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the antidepressant-like effects of the methylene chloride fraction of Albizzia julibrissin (MCAJ) using a tail suspension test in mice. MCAJ was orally administered at 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg to mice, 1 h before the tail suspension test. Acute treatment with MCAJ at 200 mg/kg significantly reduced the immobility time compared with the control group, and thus showed an antidepressant-like effect. This effect was comparable to that of imipramine at 10 mg/kg. This antidepressant-like effect was reversed by treatment with WAY-100635 (a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist) or pindolol (a 5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist). However, the antidepressant effect of MCAJ was not effected by treatment with GR55562 (a 5-HT1B receptor antagonist) or ketanserin (a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist). Therefore, our findings suggest that MCAJ exerts its antidepressant-like effect via the 5-HT1A receptor system.",

A control group constituted 39 normotensive patients with coronary artery disease (mean age: 59.4 +/- 1.3 years). The both observed groups differ from each other only with values of left ventricle mass index and drug regimen established at least three months prior to the follow-up onset. During the rehabilitation cycle, no treatment corrections were made and no new preparations were added. The all patients were enrolled to the six-month cardiac rehabilitation program. The program comprised 45-minute training with cycle ergometer, three times a week, and generally improving gym exercises, two times a week. The analyses concerned systolic and diastolic pressure values, measured just before each training (resting pressure) and just after peak exercise interval (peak pressure), at the beginning and at the end of the rehabilitation cycle. At the initial stage, the patient group with hypertension demonstrated the higher pressure values (resting and peak), as compared with the control group.",

As to the mean peak pressure in this group, systolic diminished slightly (NS), but diastolic was reduced significantly (p < 0.01). In the control group, after six-month rehabilitation the values appeared to be lowered insignificantly in relation to systolic and diastolic resting pressure, likewise diastolic peak pressure, and contrarily systolic peak pressure increased slightly. Assessing an interrelation between the final outcome of the rehabilitation program, expressed as delta of arterial pressure, and terminal training workload and delta of training workload, only for delta of systolic pressure and final training workload, a positive correlation of statistical significance was found out, which is considered an implication of physiological reaction against an increase of training workload.",

MSNA was recorded by microneurography. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. The four-month training program consisted of three 60-min exercise/week on a cycloergometer. Baseline parameters were similar between groups. Exercise training reduced MSNA (-14+/-3.3 bursts/100 HB, p=0.001) and increased forearm blood flow (0.6+/-0.1 mL/min/100 g, p<0.001) in HF patients on carvedilol. In addition, exercise training improved peak VO(2) in HF patients (20+/-6%, p=0.002). MSNA, FBF and peak VO(2) were unchanged in untrained HF patients on carvedilol.",

    "156": "Hypertension and type-2 diabetes are frequently observed concomitantly in a same patient. There are possibilities to delay the onset of type-2 diabetes, especially in patients already managed for hypertension. Trials on renin-angiotensin blockers show that compared to other drug therapies, there is a lower incidence of diabetes in patients treated by an ACE-inhibitor or an Angiotensin 11 antagonist and the benefit can be estimated at 22% (relative risk at 0.78 with a confidence interval from 0.74 to 0.83). A higher risk of occurrence of type-2 diabetes is particularly noted in those under beta-blocking therapy combined to diuretics. In ALLHAT, the comparison of a thiazide diuretic, an ACE-inhibitor and a calcium antagonist showed that the incidence of new cases of diabetes was the highest in the diuretic group and the lowest in the ACE-inhibitor group. Hypertensive patients under calcium antagonists presented an incidence in between the two other groups. According to a recent hypothesis, the insulin-resistance decrease as a consequence of renin-angiotensin system blocking is related to the recruitment of pre-adipocytes. The NAVIGATOR and ONTARGET trials will probably confirm the preliminary results obtained in this topic. Their results are expected within the 2 next years.",

Using oleic acid as oil, Tween-80 as surfactant and propylene glycol as cosurfactant, a series of mixtures comprising oleic acid, propylene glycol and Tween 80 were prepared and their self-emulsifying properties were studied. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed to identify the efficient self-emulsification region and particle sizes of the resultant emulsions were determined using a laser diffraction sizer. From these studies, an optimized formulation consisting of oil (17.5%), Tween-80 (34.5%) and cosurfactant (34.5%) was selected and its absolute bioavailability in beagle dogs after oral administration was about 24.8%. The data suggest the use of SEDDS to provide a potential way of puerarin administered orally.",

OBJECTIVE OF WORK: Find out the 24-hour effect of betaxolol hydrochloride administered once a day by determining the smoothness index. Cohort and methodology: Examination of 30 newly diagnosed hypertonics prior to and after 3-month treatment with betaxolol hydrochloride at an average dose of 15 mg once a day. BP measurement using sphygmomanometer and ABPM (SpaceLabs 90207) according to European Society for Hypertension criteria. Determining the smoothness index from individual average hourly changes in BP after treatment by dividing the hourly values average by standard deviation. Calculation of average SI from individual patient data with standard deviation and 95% confidence interval (95% CI).",

    "165": "The Second Australian National Blood Pressure Trial reported better prognosis for hypertensive subjects randomly assigned to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) compared with a diuretic-based regimen despite no difference in brachial blood pressure control. A possible explanation is that there was a difference in central aortic pressures despite similar brachial pressure reductions. We examined this hypothesis in a subset of the Second Australian National Blood Pressure Trial cohort evaluated both before and after 4 years of treatment. The average age of the 479 subjects was 71.6+/-4.7 years (mean+/-SD), and 56% were women. Brachial systolic and pulse pressures after treatment were 145+/-1 (mean+/-SEM), 143+/-1, 72+/-1, and 70+/-1 mm Hg for diuretic and ACE-I groups, respectively. The respective changes from pretreatment values were -17+/-2, -16+/-2, -9+/-1, and -7+/-1 mm Hg. None of the differences between diuretic and ACE-I groups were significant. Central arterial pressure waveforms were acquired from carotid tonometry and calibrated from brachial pressures. Central systolic and pulse pressures posttreatment were 144+/-2, 144+/-2, 71+/-2, and 72+/-2 mm Hg for diuretic and ACE-I groups, respectively. The respective changes from pretreatment values were -15+/-2, -17+/-2, -6+/-2, and -8+/-2 mm Hg. None of the differences between diuretic and ACE-I groups were significant. The similarity of central and brachial pressures in this cohort of older hypertensive subjects is most likely because of the influences of age and hypertension in increasing arterial stiffness. There is no evidence that the better prognosis for patients randomly assigned to ACE-I in Second Australian National Blood Pressure Trial resulted from a disproportionate lowering of central blood pressure.",

The Cox proportional hazards survivorship model was used to evaluate the independent contribution of clinical and genetic factors to the first occurrence of time-dependent cardiac events from birth through age 40 years. The clinical characteristics, distribution of mutations, and overall outcome event rates were similar in patients enrolled from the 3 geographic regions. Biophysical function of the mutations was categorized according to dominant-negative (> 50%) or haploinsufficiency (< or = 50%) reduction in cardiac repolarizing I(Ks) potassium channel current. Patients with transmembrane versus C-terminus mutations (hazard ratio, 2.06; P<0.001) and those with mutations having dominant-negative versus haploinsufficiency ion channel effects (hazard ratio, 2.26; P<0.001) were at increased risk for cardiac events, and these genetic risks were independent of traditional clinical risk factors.",

    "169": "The hepatic uptake of quinine, fluvoxamine, and fluoxetine (0.1-10 microM) was investigated with freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. The cell-to-medium concentration ratios (K(p)) were concentration-dependent: the mean maximum K(p) values (at 0.1 microM) were 150 (quinine), 500 (fluvoxamine), and 2000 (fluoxetine). There was also a large capacity site that was not saturable over the concentration range used (possibly partition into the phospholipid component of membranes); representing this site, the mean minimum K(p) values (at 10 microM) were 30 (quinine), 200 (fluvoxamine), and 500 (fluoxetine). To eliminate concomitant metabolism, cells were pretreated with the irreversible P450 inhibitor, aminobenzotriazole. The saturable uptake was substantially eliminated after exposure to carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (ATP inhibitor). The difference between the maximum and minimum K(p) for these three amine drugs, as well as for dextromethorphan, propranolol, and imipramine, was within a limited range of 3-fold, indicating a common magnitude of saturable uptake. Basic, permeable drugs are expected to be sequestered into lysosomes, which actively maintain their low internal pH (approximately 5) using ATP, and this process is predictable from the combined effects of pH-driven ion accumulation and unsaturable binding representing partition into membranes. The resultant predicted maximum K(p) correlated strongly with the observed maximum K(p). Thus, at low substrate concentrations, the fraction of drug unbound in the hepatocyte incubation (critical for assessing drug clearance and drug-drug interaction potential) may be dependent upon saturable as well as unsaturable binding, and for lipophilic, basic drugs, this can be readily estimated assuming a common degree of uptake into lysosomes.", 
    "170": "Polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) gene are a major cause of pharmacokinetic variability in human. Although the poor metabolizer phenotype is known to be caused by two null alleles leading to absence of functional CYP2D6 protein, the large variability among individuals with functional alleles remains mostly unexplained. Thus, the goal of this study was to examine the intrinsic enzymatic differences that exist among the several active CYP2D6 allelic variants. The relative catalytic activities (enzyme kinetics) of three functionally active human CYP2D6 allelic variants, CYP2D6.1, CYP2D6.10, and CYP2D6.17, were systematically investigated for their ability to metabolize a structurally diverse set of clinically important CYP2D6-metabolized drugs [atomoxetine, bufuralol, codeine, debrisoquine, dextromethorphan, (S)-fluoxetine, nortriptyline, and tramadol] and the effects of various CYP2D6-inhibitors [cocaine, (S)-fluoxetine, (S)-norfluoxetine, imipramine, quinidine, and thioridazine] on these three variants. The most significant difference observed was a consistent but substrate-dependent decease in the catalytic efficiencies of cDNA-expressed CYP2D6.10 and CYP2D6.17 compared with CYP2D6.1, yielding 1.32 to 27.9 and 7.33 to 80.4% of the efficiency of CYP2D6.1, respectively. The most important finding from this study is that there are mixed effects on the functionally reduced allelic variants in enzyme-substrate affinity or enzyme-inhibitor affinity, which is lower, higher, or comparable to that for CYP2D6.1. Considering the rather high frequencies of CYP2D6*10 and CYP2D6*17 alleles for Asians and African Americans, respectively, these data provide further insight into ethnic differences in CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism. However, as with all in vitro to in vivo extrapolations, caution should be applied to the clinical consequences.",
