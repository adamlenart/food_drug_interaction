Human iPS cell-derived embryonic bodies (EBs) were treated with a combination of activin-A, bone morphogenetic protein-4 and wnt-3a for one day in serum-free suspension culture, and were subsequently treated with noggin for three days. Thereafter, the EBs were subjected to adherent culture in media with 5% serum. All EBs were differentiated into spontaneously beating EBs, which were identified by the presence of striated muscles in transmission electron microscopy and the expression of the specific cardiomyocyte markers, NKX2-5 and TNNT2. The beating rate of the beating EBs was decreased by treatment with a rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (Ikr) channel blocker, E-4031, an Ikr trafficking inhibitor, pentamidin, and a slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (Iks) channel blocker, chromanol 293B, and was increased by treatment with a beta-receptor agonist, isoproterenol. At a low concentration, verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, increased the beating rate of the beating EBs, while a high concentration decreased this rate. These findings suggest that the spontaneously beating EBs were myocardial cell clusters. This simple protocol for myocardial differentiation would be useful in providing a sufficient number of the beating myocardial cell clusters for studies requiring human myocardium.",

In the patients using Cosopt (Group A) and Cosopt with PGs (Group B), Cosopt was switched to its generic counterpart (Batidor(\u00ae); Bausch & Lomb, Inc.). The intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured before the switch and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the switch in both groups. The questionnaire on the discomfort symptoms and on the discomfort score for the use of eye drops was answered by the patients in both groups before the switch and 12 weeks after the switch.",

The IOPs before the switch and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the switch showed no statistical difference in both groups (P>0.05). There were higher incidences of bitter taste and blurring with Cosopt, and there was a higher incidence of headache with Batidor in both groups, but no significant differences (P>0.05) were noted. There was, likewise, no significant difference in the discomfort score between 2 drugs in both groups (P>0.05).",

    "5": "Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) play an important role in the inflammatory response in obese animals. How ATMs are regulated in lean animals has remained elusive, however. We now show that the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is necessary to maintain the abundance of the mRNA for the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 at a low level in ATMs of lean mice. Intracerebroventricular injection of agouti-related neuropeptide increased the amount of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA in epididymal (epi) white adipose tissue (WAT), but not in interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT), through inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity in epiWAT. The surgical denervation and \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist propranolol up-regulated TNF-\u03b1 mRNA in both epiWAT and BAT in vivo. Signaling by the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (AR) and protein kinase A down-regulated TNF-\u03b1 mRNA in epiWAT explants and suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced up-regulation of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA in the stromal vascular fraction of this tissue. \u03b2-AR-deficient (\u03b2-less) mice manifested an increased plasma TNF-\u03b1 concentration and increased TNF-\u03b1 mRNA abundance in epiWAT and BAT. TNF-\u03b1 mRNA abundance was greater in ATMs (CD11b(+) cells of the stromal vascular fraction) from epiWAT or BAT of wild-type mice than in corresponding CD11b(-) cells, and \u03b22-AR mRNA abundance was greater in ATMs than in CD11b(-) cells of epiWAT. Our results show that the SNS and \u03b22-AR-protein kinase A pathway maintain an anti-inflammatory state in ATMs of lean mice in vivo, and that the brain melanocortin pathway plays a role in maintaining this state in WAT of lean mice via the SNS.", 
    "6": "In heart failure syndrome, myocardial dysfunction causes an increase in neurohormonal activity, which is an adaptive and compensatory mechanism in response to the reduction in cardiac output. Neurohormonal activity is initially stimulated in an attempt to maintain compensation; however, when it remains increased, it contributes to the intensification of clinical manifestations and myocardial damage. Cardiac remodeling comprises changes in ventricular volume as well as the thickness and shape of the myocardial wall. With optimized treatment, such remodeling can be reversed, causing gradual improvement in cardiac function and consequently improved prognosis.",

Rabbits were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, pacing (P7), \u03b23-AR antagonist (L748337), and \u03b23-AR agonist (BRL37344) groups. Atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and AF induction rate were measured. Atrial concentrations of adenine nucleotides and phosphocreatine were quantified through high-performance liquid chromatography. Mitochondrial DNA content was determined. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to examine the expression levels of signaling intermediates related to mitochondrial biogenesis.", 
    "14": "After pacing for 7 days, \u03b23-AR was significantly upregulated, AERP was reduced, and the AF induction rate was increased. The total adenine nucleotides pool was significantly reduced due to the decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The P7 group showed decreased activity of F0F1-ATPase. Mitochondrial DNA content was decreased and mitochondrial respiratory chain subunits were downregulated after pacing. Furthermore, expression of transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), was lower in the P7 group in response to \u03b23-AR activation. Further stimulation of \u03b23-AR with BRL37344 exacerbated these effects, together with a significant decrease in the levels of phosphocreatine. In contrast, inhibition of \u03b23-AR with L748337 partially restored mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism of atria in the paced rabbits.",

    "22": "Stress-induced impairments in extinction learning are believed to sustain posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Noradrenergic signaling may contribute to extinction impairments by modulating medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) circuits involved in fear regulation. Here we demonstrate that aversive fear conditioning rapidly and persistently alters spontaneous single-unit activity in the prelimbic and infralimbic subdivisions of the mPFC in behaving rats. These conditioning-induced changes in mPFC firing were mitigated by systemic administration of propranolol (10 mg/kg, i.p.), a \u03b2-noradrenergic receptor antagonist. Moreover, propranolol administration dampened the stress-induced impairment in extinction observed when extinction training is delivered shortly after fear conditioning. These findings suggest that \u03b2-adrenoceptors mediate stress-induced changes in mPFC spike firing that contribute to extinction impairments. Propranolol may be a helpful adjunct to behavioral therapy for PTSD, particularly in patients who have recently experienced trauma.",

All subjects were genotyped. Pharmacokinetic profiles of the probe drugs and their main metabolites and metabolic ratios 2, 4, 6, and 8\u00a0h after probe drug application were determined in plasma and compared with the corresponding area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) ratios.",

Good correlations of metabolic ratios with AUC ratios of the corresponding probe drugs and their metabolites for all three conditions (baseline, CYP inhibition, and CYP induction) were found at 2\u00a0h after probe drug administration for CYP3A4, at 4\u00a0h for CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, and at 6\u00a0h for CYP2B6 and CYP2D6. While CYP inhibition significantly changed AUC ratios and metabolic ratios at these time points for all six CYP isoforms, CYP induction did not significantly change AUC ratios for CYP2C9. For CYP3A4, total 1'-hydroxymidazolam concentrations after pretreatment of samples with \u03b2-glucuronidase were needed to obtain adequate reflection of CYP induction by the metabolic ratio.",

    "27": "Shortness of breath (dyspnea) is a common symptom in left-sided heart disease but clinically, patient symptoms show a high variability. Echocardiography is the mainstay for evaluating whether left-sided heart disease is the cause of dyspnea. If left-sided heart failure is diagnosed, this symptom complex must then be subjected to further etiological evaluation. Hypertensive, ischemic and valvular heart diseases are common, as well as atrial fibrillation. If the patient does not have angina pectoris, testing for ischemic heart disease should be done non-invasively by coronary computed tomography or testing for regional myocardial ischemia. Coronary revascularization is indicated only when a prognostically relevant ischemia of more than 10\u2009% of the left ventricle is diagnosed. Diuretics are important for the relief of dyspnea but do not improve the prognosis of patients. In patients with reduced left ventricular function, combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers and aldosterone antagonists improve the symptoms and prognosis. For treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction evidence-based measures are still lacking. In this case the recommended therapy consists of optimal treatment of comorbidities, regulation of heart rate and blood pressure and participation in structured exercise programs. Angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone antagonists can be given in patients with more severe symptoms even though the available data are very sparse.",

The imbalance between prospective studies' size (10 to 144 patients) and the differences in their design disfavor a meta-analysis. One retrospective study showed improved hemodynamics combining metoprolol and milrinone in septic patients, and another retrospective study found no association between beta-blocker administration and mortality. We also found three case series.

We sought to understand the predictors of receiving OMT in stable CHD and its impact on clinical outcomes. All patients with stable CHD based on coronary angiography from October 2008 to September 2011 were identified in Ontario, Canada. OMT was defined as concurrent use of \u03b2 blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, and statin. Aspirin use was not part of the OMT definition because of database limitations. Multivariable hierarchical logistic models identified predictors of OMT in the 12\u00a0months after angiography. Cox proportional hazard models with time-varying covariates for OMT and revascularization status examined differences in death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). In these models, patients transitioned among 4 mutually exclusive treatment groups: no OMT and no revascularization, no OMT and revascularization, OMT and no revascularization, OMT and revascularization. Our cohort had 20,663 patients. Over a mean period of 2.5\u00a0years, 8.7% had died. Only 61% received OMT within 12\u00a0months. The strongest predictor of receiving OMT at 12\u00a0months was OMT before the angiogram (odds ratio 14.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 13.17 to 15.75, p <0.001). Relative to no OMT and nonrevascularized patients, patients on OMT and revascularized had the greatest reduction in mortality (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.60, p <0.001) and nonfatal MI (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.84, p\u00a0<0.001). In conclusion, our study highlights the low rate of OMT in stable CHD. Patients who received both OMT and revascularization achieved the greatest reduction in mortality and nonfatal MI.",

Our purpose was to document this relationship in a transgenic (TG) strain of mice with fibrotic cardiomyopathy. TG mice with cardiac overexpression of \u03b22-adrenoceptors (\u03b22-AR mice) and non-TG (NTG) littermates were studied at 4-12 mo of age. VTA was quantified by ECG telemetry. The effect of pharmacological blockade of \u03b22-ARs on VTA was examined. Myocardial collagen content was determined by hydroxyproline assay. NTG and TG mice displayed circadian variation in heart rate, which was higher in TG mice than in NTG mice (P <0.05). Frequent spontaneous ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) were prominent in TG mice but not present in NTG mice. The frequency of VEB and VT episodes in TG mice increased with age (P < 0.01). Ventricular collagen content was greater in TG mice than in NTG mice (P <0.001) and correlated with age (r = 0.71, P < 0.01). The number of VEBs or VT episodes correlated with age (r = 0.83 and r = 0.73) and the content of total or cross-linked collagen (r = 0.62\u223c0.66, all P <0.01). While having no effect in younger \u03b22-TG mice, \u03b22-AR blockade reduced the frequency of VTA in old \u03b22-TG mice with more severe fibrosis. In conclusion, \u03b22-TG mice exhibit interstitial fibrosis and spontaneous onset of VTA, becoming more severe with aging. The extent of cardiac fibrosis is a major determinant for both the frequency of VTA and proarrhythmic action of \u03b22-AR activation.",

Subjects with hypertension (systolic blood pressure >140 or diastolic blood pressure >90; n\u00a0=\u00a026) were studied in a double-blinded, double-dummy, forced-titration, crossover design with 3 random-order experimental periods: VAL 320 mg, NEB 40 mg, and NEB/VAL 320/40\u00a0mg daily. After 4\u00a0weeks of each drug, ambulatory pulse wave analysis (MobilOGraph) was performed every 20 minutes for 24 hours. All three treatments resulted in nearly identical brachial and central systolic blood pressures. NEB alone or in combination with VAL resulted in lower ACRPP (by 11%-14%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 each) and heart rate (by 18%-20%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 each) compared with VAL, but stroke work (ACRPP per beat) was lower with VAL. Relative and adjusted variability (standard deviation and coefficient of variation) of heart rate were also lower with NEB and NEB/VAL than VAL. Results in African Americans, the majority subpopulation, were similar to those of the entire treatment group. We conclude that the rate-slowing effects of NEB cause ambulatory cardiac myocardial oxygen consumption to be lower with NEB monotherapy or NEB/VAL combination therapy than with VAL monotherapy. NEB/VAL is not superior to NEB alone in controlling heart rate, blood pressure, or ACRPP. Heart rate variability but not ACRPP variability is reduced by NEB or the combination NEB/VAL. There is no attenuation of beta-blocker-induced rate-slowing effects of in African Americans.",

This work describes a Bayesian network (BN)-based socio-ecological impact assessment of a set of measures aimed at reducing the entry of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. The measures investigated were selected across three sectors: public health market, environmental politics and drug design innovation. The BN model was developed for two drugs, Metformin and Metoprolol, and it models the distribution of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) values as a function of different measures. Results show that the sensitivity of the PEC for the two drugs to the measures investigated reflects the distinct drug characteristics, suggesting that in order to ensure the successful reduction of a broad range of substances, a spectrum of measures targeting the entire lifecycle of a pharmaceutical should be implemented. Furthermore, evaluation of two scenarios reflecting different emission management strategies highlights that the integrated implementation of a comprehensive set of measures across the three sectors results in a more extensive reduction of the contamination. Finally, the BN provides an initial forecasting tool to model the PEC of a drug as a function of a combination of measures in a context-specific manner and possible adaptations of the model are proposed.",

Current strategies to treat pathological MDMA-induced hyperthermia in humans are palliative and marginally effective, and there are no specific pharmacological treatments to counteract this potentially life-threatening condition. Here, we tested the efficacy of mixed adrenoceptor blockers carvedilol and labetalol, and the atypical antipsychotic clozapine, in reversing MDMA-induced brain and body hyperthermia. We injected rats with a moderate non-toxic dose of MDMA (9 mg/kg) during social interaction, and we administered potential treatment drugs after the development of robust hyperthermia (>2.5\u2009\u00b0C), thus mimicking the clinical situation of acute MDMA intoxication. Brain temperature was our primary focus, but we also simultaneously recorded temperatures from the deep temporal muscle and skin, allowing us to determine the basic physiological mechanisms of the treatment drug action. Carvedilol was modestly effective in attenuating MDMA-induced hyperthermia by moderately inhibiting skin vasoconstriction, and labetalol was ineffective. In contrast, clozapine induced a marked and immediate reversal of MDMA-induced hyperthermia via inhibition of brain metabolic activation and blockade of skin vasoconstriction. Our findings suggest that clozapine, and related centrally acting drugs, might be highly effective for reversing MDMA-induced brain and body hyperthermia in emergency clinical situations, with possible life-saving results.",

Seventy-two hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned to receive either losartan 50\u2009mg qd (n\u2009=\u200936) or \u03b2-blocker bisoprolol 5\u2009mg qd (n\u2009=\u200936). At the start and at month 12, ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements, and carotid artery ultrasound were performed, and homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was determined. During the study period, bioimpedance method was used to evaluate volume status every 3 months. Home-monitored BPs were measured at least monthly. Ambulatory BP decreased significantly and similarly by either losartan or bisoprolol.

We aimed to study the effects of \u03b23-adrenoceptor activation on glucose, insulin and the expression of pancreatic adrenoceptors and angiotensin II receptors. Ten C57BL/6J mice at the age of 10 weeks served as normal control, and forty age-matched apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE(-/-)) mice were randomly divided into hyperlipidaemia model group, low-dose and high-dose \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonist group and \u03b23-adrenoceptor antagonist group. After 26 weeks of high-fat diet, treatments were given for 12 weeks. Serum glucose and insulin levels in 48 weeks old mice were measured using an automatic biochemical detector.

We found that \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonist could decrease serum glucose and insulin levels in aged ApoE(-/-) mice (P<0.01) and down-regulate the expression of \u03b11A-adrenoceptor and angiotensin II type 1 receptor which were significantly increased in model mice (P<0.05, P<0.01). Compared with the model mice, \u03b12A-, \u03b22-, \u03b23-adrenoceptor and angiotensin II type 2 receptor expression were up-regulated in \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonist treat mice (P<0.05, P<0.01). These results suggest that chronic \u03b23-adrenoceptor activation regulated the expression of adrenoceptors and angiontensin II receptors towards contrary direction, which indicates that there are interactions between \u03b23-adrenoceptor and subtypes of adrenoceptor and angiotensin II receptor, and these interactions may play a protective role in pancreas and improve glucose metabolism disorders.",

However, the topical mode of administration (eyedrops) is far from optimal because of the issues of low bioavailability, high drug wastage, and lack of patient compliance. Suboptimal control of the IOP leads to disease progression and eventually to blindness. Ideally, TM is delivered to the patient so that its action is both localized and sustained for 3 months or more. In this work, we developed a subconjunctival TM microfilm for sustained, long-term delivery of TM to the eyes, using the biodegradable elastomer poly(lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLC). The copolymer is biocompatible and has flexibility and mechanical characteristics suitable for a patient-acceptable implant. Controlling the release of TM for 3 months is challenging, and this work describes how, by using a combination of multilayering and blending with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) copolymers, we were able to develop a TM-incorporated biodegradable film that can deliver TM at a therapeutic dose for 90 days in vitro.

Following solid-phase extraction on Phenomenex Strata-X cartridges using 100\u2009\u03bcL human plasma sample, the analytes and ISs were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 (50\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20092.1\u2009mm, 1.7\u2009\u00b5m) column using a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid-acetonitrile (25:75, v/v). A tandem mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray ionization was used as a detector in the positive ionization mode for both analytes. The linear concentration range was established as 0.50-500\u2009ng/mL for atenolol and 0.25-150\u2009ng/mL for chlorthalidone. Extraction recoveries were within 95-103% and ion suppression/enhancement, expressed as IS-normalized matrix factors, ranged from 0.95 to 1.06 for both the analytes. Intra-batch and inter-batch precision (CV) and accuracy values were 2.37-5.91 and 96.1-103.2%, respectively. Stability of analytes in plasma was evaluated under different conditions, such as bench-top, freeze-thaw, dry and wet extract and long-term. The developed method was superior to the existing methods for the simultaneous determination of atenolol and chlorthalidone in human plasma with respect to the sensitivity, chromatographic analysis time and plasma volume for processing.

    "139": "Elucidating reaction mechanisms is important for advancing many areas of science such as catalyst development. It is often difficult to probe fast reactions at ambient conditions with high temporal resolution. In addition, systems involving reagents that cross-react require analytical methods that can minimize interaction time and specify their order of introduction into the reacting system. Here, we explore the utility of transmission mode desorption electrospray ionization (TM-DESI) for reaction monitoring by directing a microdroplet spray towards a series of meshes with micrometer-sized openings coated with reagents, an approach we call multistage reactive TM-DESI (TM (n) -DESI, where n refers to the number of meshes; n\u2009=\u20092 in this report). Various stages of the reaction are initiated at each mesh surface, generating intermediates and products in microdroplet reaction vessels traveling towards the mass spectrometer. Using this method, we investigated the reactivity of iron porphyrin catalytic hydroxylation of propranolol and other substrates. Our experimental results indicate that TM (n) -DESI provides the ability to spatially separate reagents and control their order of introduction into the reacting system, thereby minimizing unwanted reactions that lead to catalyst deactivation and degradation products. In addition, comparison with DESI-MS analyses (the Zare and Latour laboratories published results suggesting accessible reaction times <1 ms) of the reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol by L-ascorbic acid suggest that TM (1) -DESI can access reaction times less than 1 ms. Multiple meshes allow sequential stages of desorption/ionization per MS scan, increasing the number of analytes and reactions that can be characterized in a single experiment.",

A retrospective chart review was performed on adult patients at an academic county hospital with an ejection fraction \u226440% and a diagnosis of HF, seen by a single provider type (HF team, cardiologist, or PCP) at least twice within a 12-month period. Utilization rates of any ACEI/ARB and any beta blocker were robust across provider types, though evidence-based ACEI/ARB and beta blocker were greatest from the HF team. Doses of evidence-based therapies dropped markedly in the non-HF team groups. The percent of patients prescribed optimal doses of an evidence-based ACEI/ARB AND beta blocker was 69%, 33%, and 25% for the HF team, cardiologists and PCPs, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.0167).

    "152": "In the present study, the direct drug effects of nicotine and its effects on the cholinergic twitch responses of the electrically stimulated longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus strip from the ileum of guinea pig were investigated. Nicotine dose-dependently (0.3-10 \u00b5mol/l) evoked the well-known contractile responses on its own. Whereas the interposed twitch responses remained present without a change in height at 1 \u00b5mol/l nicotine, a nicotine concentration of 3 \u00b5mol/l slightly and a concentration of 10 \u00b5mol/l markedly diminished the twitch during their presence. After the washout of 1-10 \u00b5mol/l nicotine, the height of the twitch response was also temporarily and significantly reduced by 30-77%. The P2X purinoceptor agonist \u03b1\u03b2-methylene ATP (1-10 \u00b5mol/l) dose-dependently induced contractions on its own and reduced the twitch response during its presence in the organ bath; however, it did not diminish the twitch responses after washout of the drug as nicotine did. The P2X antagonist pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2'-4'-disulphonic acid, the NMDA channel blocker MK-801 and the inhibitor of small conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (SK) channels apamin reduced the contractile effect of 1 \u00b5mol/l nicotine. Apamin also significantly prevented the 'post-nicotine inhibition of the twitch' following the washout of 1-3 \u00b5mol/l nicotine. As a conclusion, we provide evidence for a functional interaction between nicotinic receptors and the P2X receptors in the ileum of the guinea pig. The 'post-nicotine inhibition of the twitch' is not due to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor desensitization or transmitter depletion, but most probably the secondary effects of nicotine on SK channels determine the reduced cholinergic motor neuron excitability.", 
    "153": "Nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading type of lung cancer and has a poor prognosis. We have shown that chronic stress promoted NSCLC xenografts in mice via stress neurotransmitter-activated cAMP signaling downstream of beta-adrenergic receptors and incidental beta-blocker therapy was reported to improve clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients. These findings suggest that psychological stress promotes NSCLC whereas pharmacologically or psychologically induced decreases in cAMP may inhibit NSCLC. Cancer stem cells are thought to drive the development, progression and resistance to therapy of NSCLC. However, their potential regulation by stress neurotransmitters has not been investigated. In the current study, epinephrine increased the number of cancer stem cell like cells (CSCs) from three NSCLC cell lines in spheroid formation assays while enhancing intracellular cAMP and the stem cell markers sonic hedgehog (SHH), aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH-1) and Gli1, effects reversed by GABA or dynorphin B via G\u03b1i -mediated inhibition of cAMP formation. The growth of NSCLC xenografts in a mouse model of stress reduction was significantly reduced as compared with mice maintained under standard conditions. Stress reduction reduced serum levels of corticosterone, norepinephrine and epinephrine while the inhibitory neurotransmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and opioid peptides increased. Stress reduction significantly reduced cAMP, VEGF, p-ERK, p-AKT, p-CREB, p-SRc, SHH, ALDH-1 and Gli1 in xenograft tissues whereas cleaved caspase-3 and p53 were induced. We conclude that stress neurotransmitters activate CSCs in NSCLC via multiple cAMP-mediated pathways and that pharmacologically or psychologically induced decreases in cAMP signaling may improve clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients.", 
    "154": "\u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockers (\u03b2-blockers) are widely detected in the aquatic environment; however, the effects of these pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms remain uncertain. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to two different \u03b2-blockers, propranolol and metoprolol, for 96\u00a0h. After exposure, the transcriptional responses of genes encoding the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (i.e., adrb1, adrb2a, adrb2b, adrb3a and adrb3b), genes involved in detoxification and the stress response (i.e., hsp70, tap, mt1 and mt2), and genes related to the antioxidant system (i.e., cu/zn-sod, mn-sod, cat and gpx) were examined in the brain, liver and gonad. Our results show that both propranolol and metoprolol exposure changes the mRNA level of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, indicating clear pharmacological target engagement of the \u03b2-blockers. The transcription of genes related to antioxidant responses and detoxification process were induced, suggesting that \u03b2-blocker exposure can activate the detoxification process and result in oxidative stress in fish. Moreover, the transcriptional responses displayed substantial tissue- and gender-specific effects. Considering the environmental concentrations of propranolol and metoprolol, these results suggest that these pharmaceuticals are unlikely to pose a risk to fish. However, the impacts in prolonged exposure, along with other possible side effects due to \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockade, should be further assessed.",

Due to the high morbidity and mortality a standardized and evidence-based therapy is essential. The present article gives an overview of the innovations from 2014 based on the current guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. First, improvements of established medication regimens regarding beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and treatment options for heart rate reduction and disease management programs will be explained. Second, new pharmacological developments, such as the new substance class of angiotensin receptor blockers and neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), will be presented. Finally, new insights into common comorbidities of chronic heart failure patients, such as atrial fibrillation and hyperkalemia will be discussed.",

    "157": "Recent research has demonstrated that propranolol is a more effective and safer treatment for infantile hemangiomas than previous therapeutic options. It is most effective when initiated during the tumor's proliferative phase. Other oral beta-blockers such as atenolol and nadolol are less studied, but may offer similar efficacy. Topical beta-blockers such as timolol appear to be effective in treating small, superficial infantile hemangiomas. Beta-blockers have shown variable results for the treatment of other vascular tumors of childhood, such as pyogenic granulomas, kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas, and tufted angiomas.", 
    "158": "Propranolol has revolutionized the treatment of infantile hemangiomas, and other beta-blockers provide promising alternatives. Unanswered questions remain about the optimal choice of agent, delivery mechanism, dosage, need for pretreatment evaluation or ongoing monitoring, and duration of therapy. The role of beta-blockers in treating other types of vascular tumors requires further study.", 
    "159": "An increasing number of patients are presenting for major surgery with cardiovascular comorbidities. Evidence of myocardial injury was found in 8% of all noncardiac surgery patients older than 45 years and was associated with adverse outcome. For this reason, there has been a lot of interest in finding and evaluating effective cardioprotective interventions.", 
    "160": "Current evidence suggests that statins, volatile anesthetic agents, and propofol are cardioprotective. Beta blockers reduce myocardial injury, but the resultant hypotension may contribute to the increased all-cause mortality and stroke risk seen. Likewise, alpha 2 agonists can be a cause of cardiac injury if hypotension is not promptly managed. Continuation of aspirin perioperatively can increase the risk of major bleeding with or without the benefit of reduced myocardial risk. Contrary to the initial Evaluation of Nitrous Oxide in the Gas Mixture for Anaesthesia study, nitrous oxide does not seem to increase the risk of myocardial injury.", 
    "161": "It is recommended that patients already on statins or beta blockers should have them continued perioperatively. If beta blockers are initiated, the dose should be titrated to heart rate and blood pressure. The decision regarding continuation of aspirin should be on a case-to-case basis based on patient and surgical risk factors.", 
    "162": "Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A\u03b2 may exert its neurotoxic effects via multiple mechanisms and in particular through degradation of excitatory synaptic transmission associated with impaired synaptic plasticity. In contrast, much less is known about A\u03b2 effects at inhibitory synapses. This study investigates the impact of acute A\u03b21-42 application on GABAergic synaptic transmission in rat somatosensory cortex in vitro. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from layer V pyramidal cells, and monosynaptic GABA(A) receptor-mediated IPSCs were elicited. Bath-applied A\u03b2 (1 \u03bcm) depressed the IPSCs on average to 60% of control, whereas a reversed sequence control peptide was ineffective. Paired-pulse stimuli indicated a postsynaptic site of action. This was further corroborated by a decreased postsynaptic responsiveness to local puffs of the GABAA receptor agonist isoguvacine. The A\u03b2-induced IPSC decline could be prevented with intracellular applications of p4, a blocker of GABA(A) receptor internalization. It is concluded that A\u03b2 weakens synaptic inhibition via downregulation of GABA(A) receptors.",

    "168": "Although both beta-blocker treatment and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) have been established as the standard therapeutic strategy to achieve left ventricular reverse remodeling (LVRR) and improve prognosis in heart failure (HF) patients with systolic LV dysfunction, some patients do not respond to such treatments. We here report a HF patient with left bundle branch block due to nonischemic cardiomyopathy who did not respond to 20 mg/day of carvedilol in terms of LVRR. Subsequent CRT only achieved insufficient LVRR, and we further titrated carvedilol up to 40 mg/day. Marked LVRR was accomplished at a fixed 70 bpm heart rate under CRT, and therefore it was considered as heart rate-independent. Up-titration of beta-blocker after CRT may be necessary to induce optimal LVRR in some populations.",

    "173": "Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), a solvent frequently used in industry, can cause acute liver failure and liver fibrosis. Infliximab (Ib), a potent tumor necrosis factor alpha blocker, has a protective effect on the liver. Therefore, we investigated the protective effect of Ib against CCl4-induced acute liver injury. In this study, 24 male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: the control group (n = 8), the CCl4 group (n = 8), and the CCl4 + Ib group (n = 8). A single dose of 2 mL/kg CCL4 was administered to the CCL4 group. The CCl4 + Ib group was injected with a single dose (7 mg/kg) of Ib 24 h before CCl4 was administered. In the CCl4 group, the serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and the liver tissue levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), and adenosine deaminase (ADA) were significantly higher than the levels of these same substances in the control and CCl4 + Ib groups. The histopathological investigation revealed that although there was excessive liver injury in the CCl4 group, there was reduced injury in the CCl4 + Ib group. In addition, the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS-I) and carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II) levels in the CCl4 group were significantly lower than those in the control and CCl4 + Ib groups. The results show that during CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity, Ib prevents liver injury by suppressing TGF-\u03b21 and IL-1\u03b2 levels, decreasing ADA levels, and regulating CPS-I and CA-II enzyme levels.",

    "179": "Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac electrophysiologic disorder, characterized by QT prolongation and T-wave abnormalities on the ECG and the ventricular tachycardia torsade de pointes (TdP). TdP is usually self-terminating, thus causing a syncopal event, the most common symptom in individuals with LQTS. Syncope typically occurs during exercise and high emotions, less frequently at rest or during sleep, and usually without warning. In some instances, TdP degenerates to ventricular fibrillation and causes aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is defibrillated) or sudden death. Approximately 50% of individuals with a pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with LQTS have symptoms, usually one to a few syncopal spells. While cardiac events may occur from infancy through middle age, they are most common from the pre-teen years through the 20s. Some types of LQTS are associated with a phenotype extending beyond cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to the prolonged QT interval, associations include muscle weakness and facial dysmorphism in Andersen-Tawil syndrome (LQTS type 7), hand/foot, facial, and neurodevelopmental features in Timothy syndrome (LQTS type 8) and profound sensorineural hearing loss in Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome.", 
    "180": "Diagnosis of LQTS is established by prolongation of the QTc interval in the absence of specific conditions known to lengthen it (for example, QT-prolonging drugs) and/or by molecular genetic testing that identifies a diagnostic change (or changes) in one or more of the 15 genes known to be associated with LQTS, of which KCNQ1 (locus name LQT1), KCNH2 (LQT2) and SCN5A (LQT3) are the most common. Other, less frequently involved genes are ANK2 (LQT4), KCNE1 (LQT5), KCNE2 (LQT6), KCNJ2 (LQT7), CACNA1C (LQT8), CAV3 (LQT9), SCN4B (LQT10), AKAP9 (LQT11), SNTA1 (LQT12), KCNJ5 (LQT13), CALM1 (LQT14), and CALM2 (LQT15). Approximately 20% of families meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for LQTS do not have detectable pathogenic variants in one of the above genes. LQTS associated with biallelic pathogenic variants or heterozygosity for pathogenic variants in two different genes (i.e., digenic pathogenic variants) is generally associated with a more severe phenotype with longer QTc interval and a higher incidence of cardiac events.", 
    "181": "Treatment of manifestations: Beta-blocker medication is the primary treatment for LQTS; possible implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) and/or left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) for those with beta-blocker-resistant symptoms, inability to take beta blockers, and/or history of cardiac arrest. Sodium channel blockers can be useful as additional pharmacologic therapy for patients with a QTc interval >500 ms. Prevention of primary manifestations: Beta blockers are clinically indicated in all asymptomatic individuals meeting diagnostic criteria, including those who have a pathogenic variant on molecular testing and a normal QTc interval. In general, ICD implantation is not indicated for individuals with LQTS who are asymptomatic and who have not been tried on beta blocker therapy. Prophylactic ICD therapy can be considered for individuals with LQTS who are asymptomatic but suspected to be at very high risk (e.g., those with \u22652 pathogenic variants on molecular testing). Surveillance: Regular assessment of beta-blocker dose for efficacy and adverse effects in all individuals with LQTS, especially children during rapid growth; regular periodic evaluations of ICDs for inappropriate shocks and pocket or lead complications. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs that cause further prolongation of the QT interval or provoke torsade de pointes; competitive sports/activities associated with intense physical activity and/or emotional stress for most individuals. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment is warranted in relatives at risk to prevent syncope and sudden death. Other: For some individuals, availability of automatic external defibrillators at home, at school, and in play areas.", 
    "182": "LQTS is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. An exception is LQTS associated with sensorineural deafness (known as Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome), which is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most individuals diagnosed with LQTS have an affected parent. The proportion of LQTS caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is small. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant LQTS has a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Penetrance of the disorder may vary. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible once the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in the family.", 
    "183": "Many uncertainties surround the syndrome of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which was the topic reviewed in an Expert Meeting at the University of Ferrara. This concluded that the absence of clear diagnostic clinical criteria was the major barrier to progress. There was general agreement that symptoms or signs of heart failure, normal LVEF despite an elevated plasma concentration of natriuretic peptides, and signs of abnormal LV relaxation, LV filling, LV hypertrophy, or left atrial enlargement, or diastolic dysfunction supported the diagnosis. However, HFpEF, like all heart failure syndromes, is heterogeneous in aetiology and pathophysiology, rather than being a single disease. HFpEF may account for about half of all patients with heart failure. The classical risk factors for developing HFpEF include age and co-morbidities, notably hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and the metabolic syndrome. When complicated by increasing congestion requiring hospital admission, the prognosis is poor; 30% or more of patients will die within 1 year (nearly two-thirds die from cardiovascular causes). Patients with chronic stable symptoms have a much better prognosis. Despite many clinical trials, there is no solid evidence that any treatment alters the natural history of HFpEF. Several treatments have shown promising early results and are now being tested in substantial randomized clinical trials. Further basic research is required to better characterize the disease and accelerate progress. Our review highlights the many difficulties encountered in performing randomized clinical trials in HFpEF, often due to difficulties in characterizing HFpEF itself.", 
    "184": "A patient presented with loss of consciousness and conversion. During an exercise test, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) resulted in cardiac arrest. He started taking medication (a beta-blocker and flecainide) and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was inserted, but the ventricular tachycardia did not resolve. Left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) was then performed under general anesthesia, and the patient was discharged on the second postoperative day without complications. One month after the operation, no shock had been administered by the ICD, and an exercise stress test did not induce ventricular tachycardia. Although beta-blockers are the gold standard of therapy in patients with CPVT, thoracoscopic LCSD is safe and can be an effective alternative treatment option for patients with intractable CPVT.", 
    "185": "A novel approach for automation of Micro-Extraction by Packed Sorbent (MEPS), a solid phase extraction technique, is presented, enabling precise and repeatable liquid handling due to the employment of sequential injection technique. The developed system was used for human urine sample clean-up and pre-concentration of betaxolol before its separation and determination. A commercial MEPS C-18 cartridge was integrated into an SIChrom\u2122 system. The chromatographic separation was performed on a monolithic High Resolution C18 (50\u00d74.6 mm) column which was coupled on-line in the system with Micro-Extraction using an additional selection valve. A mixture of acetonitrile and aqueous solution of 0.5% triethylamine with acetic acid, pH adjusted to 4.5 in ratio 30:70 was used as a mobile phase for elution of betaxolol from MEPS directly onto the monolithic column where the separation took place. Betaxolol was quantified by a fluorescence detector at wavelengths \u03bb(ex)=220 nm and \u03bb(em)=305 nm. The linear calibration range of 5-400 ng mL(-1), with limit of detection 1.5 ng mL(-1) and limit of quantification 5 ng mL(-1) and correlation r=0.9998 for both the standard and urine matrix calibration were achieved. The system recovery was 105\u00b15%; 100\u00b14%; 108\u00b11% for three concentration levels of betaxolol in 10 times diluted urine - 5, 20 and 200 ng mL(-1), respectively.",

    "194": "Betablockers are one of the most successful drug classes in cardiology. They have many indications - starting with treatment of arterial hypertension, continuing with secondary prevention post myocardial infarction up to the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Recently, many analysis and information were published which are questioning yet unshakable role of betablockers in some cardiovascular diagnosis. This review article summarizes the controversies, which have accumulated around betablockers in the treatment of hypertension, secondary prevention of coronary artery disease, perioperative administration in patients undegoing non-cardiac surgery and treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Some of these controversies already led to guidelines modifications, other will probably lead to guidelines changes in near future.Key words: arterial hypertension - betablockers - heart failure - perioperative care - secondary prevention.", 
    "195": "Oxidative imbalance, alterations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and mitochondrial dysfunction are implicated in bipolar disorder (BD) pathophysiology and comorbidities, for example, cardiovascular conditions. Carvedilol (CVD), a nonselective beta-blocker widely used for the treatment of hypertension, presents antioxidant and mitochondrial stabilizing properties. Thus, we hypothesized that CVD would prevent and/or reverse mania-like behavioral and neurochemical alterations induced by lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX). To do this, male Wistar rats were submitted to two different protocols, namely, prevention and reversal. In the prevention treatment the rats received daily oral administration (mg/kg) of CVD (2.5, 5 or 7.5), saline, valproate (VAL200), or the combination of CVD5 + VAL100 for 7 days. From the 8th to 14th day LDX was added. In the reversal protocol LDX was administered for 7 days with the drugs being added from the 8th to 14th day of treatment. Two hours after the last administration the behavioral (open field and social interaction) and neurochemical (reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation, and BDNF) determinations were performed. The results showed that CVD prevented and reversed the behavioral and neurochemical alterations induced by LDX. The administration of CVD5 + VAL100 potentiated the effect of VAL200 alone. Taken together these results demonstrate a possible antimanic effect of CVD in this preclinical model.", 
    "196": "The noradrenergic (NA)-system is an important regulator of cognitive function. It contributes to extinction learning (EL), and in disorders where EL is impaired NA-dysfunction has been postulated. We explored whether NA acting on beta-adrenergic-receptors (\u03b2-AR), regulates EL that depends on context, but is not fear-associated. We assessed behavior in an \"AAA\" or \"ABA\" paradigm: rats were trained for 3 days in a T-maze (context-A) to learn that a reward is consistently found in the goal arm, despite low reward probability. This was followed on day 4 by EL (unrewarded), whereby in the ABA-paradigm, EL was reinforced by a context change (B), and in the AAA-paradigm, no context change occurred. On day 5, re-exposure to the A-context (unrewarded) occurred. Typically, in control \"AAA\" animals EL occurred on day 4 that progressed further on day 5. In control \"ABA\" animals, EL also occurred on day 4, followed by renewal of the previously learned (A) behavior on day 5, that was succeeded (on day 5) by extinction of this behavior, as the animals realised that no food reward would be given. Treatment with the \u03b2-AR-antagonist, propranolol, prior to EL on day 4, impaired EL in the AAA-paradigm. In the \"ABA\" paradigm, antagonist treatment on day 4, had no effect on extinction that was reinforced by a context change (B). Furthermore, \u03b2-AR-antagonism prior to renewal testing (on day 5) in the ABA-paradigm, resulted in normal renewal behavior, although subsequent extinction of responses during day 5 was prevented by the antagonist. Thus, under both treatment conditions, \u03b2-AR-antagonism prevented extinction of the behavior learned in the \"A\" context. \u03b2-AR-blockade during an overt context change did not prevent EL, whereas \u03b2-AR were required for EL in an unchanging context. These data suggest that \u03b2-AR may support EL by reinforcing attention towards relevant changes in the previously learned experience, and that this process supports extinction learning in constant-context conditions.", 
    "197": "There is a wide practice gap between optimal care and actual care for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in China. Indicators of quality of care for AMI patients have already been developed by a modified Delphi process. Our aim was to assess the association between those indicators and in-hospital mortality in AMI patients. We hypothesized that an association exists between quality-of-care indicators and in-hospital mortality in AMI patients. Based on the data of 2128 AMI patients at 20 tertiary hospitals in Heilongjiang Province from January 1, 2009 to October 31, 2010, we estimated the compliance rates of indicators. Association between indicators and in-hospital mortality was assessed using hierarchical generalized linear models. Among 2128 patients, 163 (7.66%) died during their hospital stay. The compliance rates were 71.6%, 41.3%, 82.5%, 63.5%, 80.4%, 5.1%, 28.9%, and 41.2% for the use of aspirin, \u03b2-blocker, clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, statin, thrombolytic, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary angiography, respectively. Aspirin, clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, statin, and percutaneous coronary intervention were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality after adjustment for potential confounding factors. We found some disparities between guidelines and clinical practice for AMI patients in China and a significant association between indicators and in-hospital mortality. Our findings are potentially helpful for assessing and improving the quality of care for AMI patients in China.", 
    "198": "It is known that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the development of insulin resistance as well as pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction both of which are often observed in type 2 diabetes. In this study, we evaluated the effects of azelnidipine, a calcium channel blocker, on ROS-mediated insulin resistance in adipocytes. When 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to ROS, insulin-mediated glucose uptake was suppressed, but such phenomena were not observed in the presence of azelnidipine. Phosphorylation of insulin receptor and phosphorylation of Akt were suppressed by ROS, which was mitigated by azelnidipine treatment. Activation of the JNK pathway induced by ROS was also reduced by azelnidipine. Various inflammatory cytokine levels were increased by ROS, which was also suppressed by azelnidipine treatment. In contrast, adiponectin mRNA and secreted adiponectin levels were reduced by ROS, which was refilled by azelnidipine treatment. In conclusion, azelnidipine preserves insulin signaling and glucose uptake against oxidative stress in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",

Circulating malondialdehyde was significantly lower in pretreated animals administered esmolol or esmolol and amikacin compared with that in controls and in treated animals administered both agents compared with in controls (P = 0.020). In these groups, the bacterial load of the lung was significantly lower compared with controls. Serum tumor necrosis factor alpha did not change. Amikacin was increased in serum of esmolol-treated animals at levels which inhibited the in vitro growth of the studied isolate. Esmolol did not modify the in vitro growth of P aeruginosa and the oxidative burst of neutrophils.",

Both the short- and long-term bupivacaine treatment suppressed ACh-induced vasodilation. Incubation of the aortic rings with 0.2%-0.6% lipid emulsion (LE) for 100 min significantly increased the pD2 and Emax values of Phe-induced vasoconstriction, and incubation with 0.4% LE for 100 min reversed the inhibition of bupivacaine on vasoconstriction induced by Phe (30 \u03bcmol/L).

Wnt signal pathway blocker Dickkopf-1 (DDK-1, 100 \u03bcg/L) was added in ox-LDL 72-h group. The expression of a-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteogenic transcription factor Cbfa-1 was detected by Western blotting, and that of \u03b2-catenin, a key mediator of Wnt signal pathway by immunocytochemical staining method. The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin was observed and the transformation of myofibroblasts to the osteoblast-like phenotype was examined. The expression of \u03b1-SMA, BMP2, ALP and Cbfa-1 proteins in the control group was weaker than in the ox-LDL-treated groups. In ox-LDL-treated groups, the protein expression of a-SMA, BMP2, ALP, and Cbfa-1 was significantly increased in a time-dependent manner as compared with the control group, and there was significant difference among the three ox-LDL-treated groups (P<0.05 for all); \u03b2-catenin protein was also up-regulated in the ox-LDL-treated groups in a time-dependent manner as compared with the control group (P<0.05), and its transfer from cytoplasm to nucleus and accumulation in the nucleus were increased in the same fashion (P<0.05). After addition of DKK-1, the expression of \u03b1-SMA, bone-related proteins and \u03b2-catenin protein was significantly reduced as compared with ox-LDL 72-h group (P<0.05).

    "212": "The autonomic control of heart rate was studied throughout development in embryos of the green iguana, Iguana iguana by applying receptor agonists and antagonists of the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems. Acetylcholine (Ach) slowed or stopped the heart and atropine antagonized the response to Ach indicating the presence of muscarinic cholinoceptors on the heart of early embryos. However, atropine injections had no impact on heart rate until immediately before hatching, when it increased heart rate by 15%. This cholinergic tonus increased to 34% in hatchlings and dropped to 24% in adult iguanas. Although epinephrine was without effect, injection of propranolol slowed the heart throughout development, indicating the presence of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors on the heart of early embryos, possibly stimulated by high levels of circulating catecholamines. The calculated excitatory tonus varied between 33% and 68% until immediately before hatching when it fell to 25% and 29%, a level retained in hatchlings and adults. Hypoxia caused a bradycardia in early embryos that was unaffected by injection of atropine indicating that hypoxia has a direct effect upon the heart. In later embryos and hatchlings hypoxia caused a tachycardia that was unaffected by injection of atropine. Subsequent injection of propranolol reduced heart rate both uncovering a hypoxic bradycardia in late embryos and abolishing tachycardia in hatchlings. Hypercapnia was without effect on heart rate in late stage embryos and in hatchlings.",

    "217": "Glaucoma patients frequently instill eye drops multiple times each day, which is a cause for reduced compliance. Additionally, eye drops suffer from other limitations including low bioavailability, which can lead to side effects. We propose to develop drug-eluting contact lenses for managing glaucoma with increased bioavailability and improved compliance. Contact lenses are developed for extended simultaneous release of timolol and dorzolamide, both of which are commonly prescribed hydrophilic drugs. The extended release is achieved by loading lenses with vitamin E barriers. In vitro release studies are performed with control and vitamin E loaded lenses for both drugs loaded separately and then together in the same lens. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy by contacts are demonstrated in a Beagle model of glaucoma. Simultaneous loading of timolol and dorzolamide increases the release duration of both drugs. Also vitamin E incorporation is highly effective in increasing the release durations of both drugs to about 2-days. The lenses loaded with both drugs exhibited superior IOP reduction compared to eye drops with about 6-fold lower drug loading. More importantly, combination therapy by continuous wear of vitamin E loaded contact for 2-days, followed by a new set of contacts for another two days, reduced IOP during the 4days of wear time and for another 8days after removal of the contacts. Vitamin E loading is very effective for providing combination therapy by contact lenses due to the increase in release durations of several drugs. The contact lens based therapy reduces IOP with lower drug dose compared to eye drops and may significantly improve the compliance as the effect of the therapy lasts significantly longer than the wear-duration.", 
    "218": "It is known that cadmium (Cd) induces cytotoxicity in hepatocytes; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we studied the molecular mechanisms of Cd-induced hepatotoxicity in rat liver cells (BRL 3A) and in vivo. We observed that Cd treatment was associated with a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in the cell index (CI) of BRL 3A cells and cellular organelle ultrastructure injury in the rat liver. Meanwhile, Cd treatment resulted in the inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Gap junction blocker 18-\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), administered in combination with Cd, exacerbated cytotoxic injury in BRL 3A cells; however, GA had a protective effect on healthy cells co-cultured with Cd-exposed cells in a co-culture system. Cd-induced cytotoxic injury could be attenuated by co-treatment with an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (U0126) and a p38 inhibitor (SB202190) but was not affected by co-treatment with a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor (SP600125). These results indicate that ERK and p38 play critical roles in Cd-induced hepatotoxicity and mediate the function of gap junctions. Moreover, MAPKs induce changes in GJIC by controlling connexin gene expression, while GJIC has little effect on the Cd-induced activation of MAPK pathways. Collectively, our study has identified a possible mechanistic pathway of Cd-induced hepatotoxicity in vitro and in vivo, and identified the participation of GJIC and MAPK-mediated pathways in Cd-induced hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, we have shown that salidroside may be a functional chemopreventative agent that ameliorates the negative effects of Cd via GJIC and MAPK pathways.",
