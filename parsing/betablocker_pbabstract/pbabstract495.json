During atrial pacing the patient experienced chest pain which was accompanied by lactate production. Atenolol, but not nifedipine, did ameliorate the symptoms. The anatomical types and the embriogenesis of coronary microfistulas along with possible mechanisms of ischemia are discussed.", 
    "1": "Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) in young rats overeating a \"cafeteria\" (CAF) diet of palatable human foods is characterized by a chronic, propranolol-inhibitable elevation in resting metabolic rate (VO2) and is associated with various changes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) that have been taken as evidence for BAT as the effector of DIT. But direct evidence for participation of BAT in DIT has been lacking. By employing a nonocclusive cannula to sample the venous effluent of interscapular BAT (IBAT) for analysis of its O2 content and measuring tissue blood flow with microspheres, we accomplished direct determination (Fick principle) of the O2 consumption of BAT in conscious CAF rats. In comparison with normophagic controls fed chow, the CAF rats exhibited a 43% increase in metabolizable energy intake, reduced food efficiency, a 22% elevation in resting VO2 at 28 degrees C (thermoneutrality) or 24 degrees C (housing temperature), and characteristic changes in the properties of their BAT (e.g., increased mass, protein content and mitochondrial GDP binding). They also exhibited the greater metabolic response to exogenous noradrenaline characteristic of CAF rats and the near elimination by propranolol of their elevation in VO2. By the criterion of their elevated VO2, the CAF rats were exhibiting DIT at the time of the measurements of BAT blood flow and blood O2 levels. However, BAT O2 consumption was found to be no greater in the CAF rats than in the controls at either 28 or 24 degrees C. At 28 degrees C it accounted for less than 1% of whole body VO2; at 24 degrees C it increased to about 10% of overall VO2 in both diet groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "Vasopressinergic pathways within the spinal cord have been implicated in the control of cardiovascular function. This study was undertaken to determine the mechanisms whereby intrathecally administered arginine vasopressin (AVP) increases blood pressure and heart rate in anesthetized rats. The cardiovascular responses to intrathecal AVP administration were significantly attenuated after intravenous administration of the ganglionic blocking agent, chlorisondamine chloride, as were the pressor responses following alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade with phentolamine and the heart rate responses following beta-receptor blockade with propranolol. Intrathecal administration of the V1 vasopressin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP completely blocked the cardiovascular responses to intrathecal AVP injections, but did not significantly alter the responses to intrathecal substance P injections. There was no evidence for the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the pressor responses to intrathecal AVP, as (i) an angiotensin II receptor blocking agent, [Sar1, Val5, Ala8]angiotensin, failed to significantly alter the responses to intrathecal AVP, and (ii) plasma renin levels did not change following administration of the peptide. Intrathecal injections of [3H]AVP suggest that only small amounts of the peptide may cross into the plasma during the time in which the cardiovascular variables are changing. These data provide evidence that intrathecally administered AVP discretely activates the sympathetic outflow to the heart and vasculature, and confirm the neurally mediated nature of the response.", 
    "3": "Zero-order release of oxprenolol hydrochloride was obtained by controlling the swelling and erosion of the matrix. This formulation involves only mixing of drug, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Na CMC) at the ratio of 1:0.4:1.6, respectively, and compressing the mixture directly into tablets. The in vitro release pattern from this optimized matrix tablet was reproducible. Accelerated stability studies revealed that the optimized formulation remains stable for an approximately 2-year shelf life. This sustained-release (SR) tablet was evaluated in dogs, and for comparison a conventional (CV) formulation was also given at the same dose level. Plasma oxprenolol levels were monitored by a sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. Significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters, i.e., lower Cmax, higher values of tmax, MRT, AUC, and plasma concentration at 24 hr, and nearly constant plasma levels over 12 hr, indicated that the SR matrix tablet is superior to the CV rapid-releasing formulation. The in vitro release parameters and in vivo pharmacokinetics correlated well.", 
    "4": "1. Dilatation of the rat right atria caused a stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol turnover pathway as measured by an increase in the accumulation of inositol phosphates in isolated, perfused hearts. 2. In right atria, increases were detected after 1 min dilatation and maximal increases were observed after 10 min. Dilatation for 10 min caused an increase in inositol monophosphate inositol bisphosphate and inositol trisphosphate from 23.3 +/- 0.9, 15.4 +/- 0.4, and 9.5 +/- 0.3 (mean and s.e.m., n = 7 ct/min per mg tissue) to 74.6 +/- 2.3, 20.2 +/- 1.3 and 13.6 +/- 1.5 (n = 8), respectively (P less than 0.01 for all inositol phosphates.) 3. These results show that the myocardium can respond to dilatation by an activation of the phosphatidylinositol turnover pathway.", 
    "5": "1. The effects of low oxygen tension on tone and on the responsiveness to contractile and relaxant agents were examined on circumflex coronary artery rings isolated from sheep. 2. When artery rings (2-2.5 mm o.d.) were set at their optimal resting tension, introduction of hypoxia (0% O2) caused a sustained contraction which was reversible on washing with oxygenated Krebs solution. In precontracted (40 mM KCl) arteries, hypoxia caused a similar response except that it was preceded by a transient relaxation. 3. The hypoxia-induced contraction was potentiated by the combination of phentolamine (1 microM) and propranolol (1 microM), markedly reduced by verapamil (10 microM) and either abolished or reduced by indomethacin (1 microM). Indomethacin itself caused a contraction. 4. Under hypoxic conditions, the contractile effects of U46619 (a stable thromboxane analogue) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and the vasodilator effects of noradrenaline, iloprost (a prostacyclin mimetic) and adenosine were markedly potentiated. In contrast, vasoconstriction to potassium or acetylcholine was depressed. 5. Changing the gases from 95% O2 to 12% O2 had no significant effect on the contractile effects of U46619. However, the maximum contractile effect of U46619 was significantly enhanced by changing the gases from 12% O2 to 0% O2. 6. Rings from a smaller branch (0.6-1.3 mm o.d.) of the circumflex coronary artery of the sheep, in the presence of hypoxia, exhibited qualitatively similar changes in the responsiveness to U46619, 5-HT and adenosine to those observed in the large artery. However, the effect of potassium was potentiated rather than depressed. 7. It is concluded that hypoxia-induced contraction may involve a modified release of cyclooxygenase products and be partly dependent upon the availability of extracellular calcium. 8. The change in the responsiveness of coronary arteries, under hypoxia, to both constrictor and dilator mediators may have clinical relevance to myocardial ischaemia and angina pectoris.", 
    "6": "In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study 24 healthy volunteers were examined before and 2 h after oral administration of 80 mg (R,S)-, 40 mg (R)- and 40 mg (S)-propranolol.HCl; 8 of them received placebo in an additional run. During exercise on a bicycle ergometer and a rest period the rate pressure product was decreased by 80 mg (R,S)-propranolol.HCl (-32.8% p less than 0.0001) and 40 mg (S)-propranolol.HCl (-32.3%; p less than 0.0001), whereas 40 mg (R)-propranolol.HCl as well as placebo showed no effect. Corresponding binding inhibition experiments using (-)-(125I)iodocyanopindolol in a sarcolemma-enriched cardiac membrane preparation yielded a eudismic ratio of 179 for (S)- over (R)-propranolol. 2 h after oral application, stereospecific HPLC analysis revealed different individual concentrations in plasma of (R)- 22.3 +/- 21.7 ng/ml) and (S)-propranolol (30.4 +/- 26.9 ng/ml) when 80 mg of (R,S)-propranolol.HCl was administered. The plasma levels were similar when 40 mg of the pure enantiomer of (R)- (22.7 +/- 20.3 ng/ml) or (S)-propranolol.HCl (28.7 +/- 22.5 ng/ml) was applied. (R)- and (S)-propranolol are two substances with different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. As there are methods available to produce the optically pure enantiomers, they should be used rather than the racemic mixture.", 
    "7": "Iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine [131I]MIBG has proven to be an effective radiopharmaceutical for the scintigraphic localization of pheochromocytomas. Uptake of MIBG is inhibited by blockade of the neuronal uptake pathway for catecholamines (\"uptake-1\") and by depletion of catecholamine storage vesicle contents, but is not significantly affected by conventional alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs. Labetalol is an antihypertensive agent with combined alpha- and beta-blocking properties that has been used to manage patients with suspected pheochromocytomas. We report eight patients in whom concurrent or recent therapy with labetalol significantly reduced the uptake of [131I]MIBG into salivary glands, liver, spleen, and general body background. Tumor uptake of MIBG was also reduced in two of the three patients who were proven to have pheochromocytomas. In one case, the effect of labetalol persisted for 36 hr after the drug had been discontinued. The inhibitory effect of labetalol on MIBG uptake in sympathomedullary tissues is likely to be a result of the drug's little-known, additional properties of uptake-1 blockade and depletion of storage vesicle contents, rather than its alpha- or beta-blocking effects. Additionally, labetalol would also appear to hasten clearance of MIBG from other tissues. Labetalol therapy should be discontinued for several days (possibly up to 1 wk) before undertaking [131I]MIBG scintigraphy. A comprehensive list of drugs that should be avoided in patients undergoing MIBG scintigraphy is appended.", 
    "8": "Vagal, nonadrenergic inhibitory system (NAIS) innervation to airway smooth muscle has been demonstrated in adults of several species, including humans. However, the functional status of this system in newborns is not known. The NAIS of intestinal smooth muscle has been demonstrated in newborns and develops in parallel with cholinergic innervation (14). Since the lung is derived embryologically from the foregut and cholinergic innervation is operative at birth, we tested the hypothesis that NAIS innervation to the airways is functional in newborn cats. Nineteen cats (2-11 days of age) were anesthetized with chloralose-urethan, and a tracheal cannula was inserted. The chest was opened and the animals were mechanically ventilated. The cervical vagus nerves were separated from the sympathetics, cut, and placed on stimulating electrodes. Mean inspiratory resistance (RL, I) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn, L) were measured on a breath-by-breath basis. Atropine and propranolol were administered (2 mg/kg iv) to block cholinergic and adrenergic pathways, respectively. Subsequently, serotonin infusion was used to increase RL, I approximately 150%. Stimulation (10 s) at frequencies ranging from 2 to 20/s caused a slow-onset (30 s to peak) long-lasting decrease in RL, I and a much smaller increase in Cdyn, L. The magnitude and duration of the bronchodilation increased with stimulus frequency to a plateau at approximately 15/s. At a stimulus frequency of 2/s, RL, I decreased 11 +/- 1.9 vs 36 +/- 4.8% (SE) at 20/s, whereas Cdyn, L increased 2 +/- 1.1 vs. 6 +/- 1.7%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Pre- and post-task measures of dark focus (DF) were used to assess accommodative adaptation induced by brief near-vision tasks in 10 late-onset myopes (LOM's) and 10 emmetropes. The degree of adaptation was examined after tasks of 15, 30, and 45 s duration. Accommodation was measured after the task at 1 s intervals over a 90 s period using an objective infrared optometer. Emmetropic subjects showed a significant increase in DF during the first 10 s of post-task recording, which regressed to the pre-task value within a further 20 to 30 s. No significant difference in post-task accommodative regression was observed after the three task durations. Similar findings were observed for LOM's after the 15 and 30 s tasks. However, after the 45 s task, LOM's exhibited a marked negative shift in DF during the 10 to 50 s post-task period. Instillation of a beta adrenergic antagonist attenuated this negative shift, suggesting that it was mediated via beta adrenergic innervation to the ciliary muscle.", 
    "10": "The actions of metaraminol on the secretion of fluid and glycoproteins from rat submandibular glands were investigated using phentolamine, propranolol and reserpine. Metaraminol at doses from 1 to 8 mg/kg (i.p.) increased the salivation and the amounts of protein in submandibular saliva in a dose-dependent manner. The salivation induced by metaraminol at 2 mg/kg was inhibited strongly by pretreatment with propranolol, whereas the salivation induced by metaraminol at 8 mg/kg was inhibited strongly by phentolamine. Reserpine inhibited the secretion of fluid caused by both doses of metaraminol. The electrophoretic profiles of saliva evoked by metaraminol at 2 mg/kg revealed two main bands of glycoprotein, I and IV, which originated from the acinus, and the intensities of these bands were decreased by treatment with propranolol, whereas the major band in saliva induced by 8 mg/kg of metaraminol was glycoprotein III, which originated from the granular tubules. The intensity of band III was decreased by pretreatment with phentolamine. These results suggest that metaraminol, at small doses, stimulates mainly the beta-adrenoceptor in the acinus, whereas at large doses, it prominently stimulates the alpha-adrenoceptors in the granular tubules, although metaraminol at small and large doses is able to stimulate alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in rat submandibular gland.", 
    "11": "A 6-month oral toxicity test of practolol was carried out in beagle dogs as a reference control for a newly developed beta blocker. No significant drug-induced changes were detected in any animals by various ophthalmological examinations such as ERG, tear flow, lysozymal activity in tears, etc. However, an unusual pathological change was detected in the lacrymal gland of all five dogs treated with practolol and not in control animals. Macroscopically, the lacrymal glands assumed a blackish brown to deep black colour on both the outside and the cut surface. Microscopically, fine, dark-brown pigment granules were present in the apical and supra-nuclear portion of the cytoplasm of predominantly serosal type epithelial cells. These pigments reacted positively to Schmorl's method for lipofuscin, but gave a negative PAS reaction for polysaccharide, Prussian blue for iron and Ziehl-Neelsen method for ceroid pigment. They were detected as membrane-bound electron-dense bodies by electron microscopy. Similar pigments were also deposited in the cytoplasm of the apocrine sweat gland. Although the mechanism of the accumulation of these granules is far from clear, concentration of practolol in the lacrymal gland is considered to be very closely related to the presence of these granules. A possible mechanism for ocular toxicity by practolol, involving this change, is discussed.", 
    "12": "Models of adrenergic arrhythmias were produced on isolated rat heart under the adrenalin concentration in the perfusion solution of 5.10(-5) M. The rhythm disturbances were accompanied by a pronounced depression of contractile function. It was shown that preliminary adaptation of animals to short-term stress exposures reduced the duration of arrhythmias more than sixfold the contractile function, being maintained at a higher level than in control. The adaptation cardioprotective effect was compared with the effects of adaptation and propranolol appeared similar.", 
    "13": "The significance of neurogenic influences upon the distribution of systemic and coronary fraction during rise of aortic pressure by step occlusion of ascending aorta was studied in anesthetized cats. Under elevation of aortic pressure up to 60 mm Hg the increase in systemic fraction and less pronounced rise of coronary fraction were observed. When aortic pressure elevation was more than 60 mm Hg commensurable increase of both fractions occurred. Under beta-adrenoreceptor blockade elevation of aortic pressure more than 60 mm Hg evoked the significant increase in systemic fraction and reduction in coronary fraction.", 
    "14": "The influence of age on the stereoselective serum protein binding of propranolol was investigated. Serum was obtained from 10 young (mean age 23 +/- 2 years) and ten elderly (mean age 68 +/- 2 years) healthy male volunteers. The free fraction of propranolol (fu) was measured by equilibrium dialysis, using tritium labeled (+/-)- and (-)-propranolol. The fu values were 0.159 +/- 0.049 and 0.148 +/- 0.028 (+/-), 0.135 +/- 0.041 and 0.136 +/- 0.04 (-), 0.174 +/- 0.056 and 0.161 +/- 0.028 (+) in the young and elderly subjects, respectively. Serum alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) concentrations were 81.4 +/- 33.0 and 81.0 +/- 21.6 mg 100 ml-1 in young and elderly respectively (P greater than 0.05). Variability in AAG concentration accounted for most of the observed intersubject variability in the binding of both propranolol isomers. The stereoselective binding of propranolol does not appear to be affected by age.", 
    "15": "1. Quinidine is a potent inhibitor of the genetically-determined debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation. Oxidation reactions of several other drugs, including the 5-hydroxylation of the new antiarrhythmic drug propafenone, depend on the isozyme responsible for debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation. 2. The effect of quinidine on the debrisoquine phenotype-dependent 5-hydroxylation and the pharmacological activity of propafenone was studied in seven 'extensive' metabolizers and two 'poor' metabolizers of the drug receiving propafenone for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. 3. In patients with the extensive metabolizer phenotype, quinidine increased mean steady-state plasma propafenone concentrations more than two fold, from 408 +/- 351 (mean +/- s.d.) to 1096 +/- 644 ng ml-1 (P less than 0.001), decreased 5-hydroxypropafenone concentrations from 242 +/- 196 to 125 +/- 97 ng ml-1 (P less than 0.02) and reduced propafenone oral clearance by 58 +/- 23%. 4. Despite these changes in plasma concentrations, electrocardiographic intervals and arrhythmia frequency were unaltered by quinidine coadministration, indicating that 5-hydroxypropafenone contributes to the pharmacologic effects of propafenone therapy in extensive metabolizers. 5. In contrasts, plasma concentrations of propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone remained unchanged in the two patients with the poor metabolizer phenotype. 6. Biotransformation of substrates for the debrisoquine pathway can be markedly perturbed by even low doses of quinidine; interindividual variability in drug interactions may have a genetic component.", 
    "16": "1. The metabolism of orally administered timolol (T) to its ring cleavage ethanolamine (TE) and glycine (TG) products was studied in 108 unrelated hypertensive patients. 2. Statistically significant correlations between the 0-8 h urinary debrisoquine/4-hydroxy-debrisoquine ratio and the T/TE (rs = 0.74, P less than 0.001), T/TG (rs = 0.42, P less than 0.001) and T/TE + TG (rs = 0.49, P less than 0.001) ratios were found. 3. The log10 T/TE, T/TG and T/TE + TG ratios from poor metabolisers of debrisoquine (PMs) were grouped at the upper end of a unimodal distribution. 4. These results indicate that timolol metabolism is partly under monogenic control of the debrisoquine-type. 5. The mean +/- s.d. plasma timolol concentration in PMs (82 +/- 43 ng ml-1) was double that in extensive metabolisers (45 +/- 19 ng ml-1) (P = 0.011). The clinical significance of this observation remains to be established.", 
    "17": "The efficacy of oral atenolol in increasing the capacity and duration of exercise in 43 patients in sinus rhythm with mitral stenosis was evaluated and compared with that of oral verapamil in an open-label cross-over design. It was observed that although oral atenolol (100 mg per day) caused significant reductions in heart rate while resting and during exercise (P less than 0.001), the increases in capacity and duration of exercise were not significant. Oral verapamil (80 mg three times per day) also caused significant reductions in the heart rates at rest and during exercise (P less than 0.05) but the increases observed, although greater than that with atenolol, failed to reach the level of statistical significance. Occasional side effects occurred with both the drugs. Subjective symptoms of dyspnoea at rest and on exertion were relieved with both the drugs. We conclude that, although both drugs reduce the symptoms of dyspnoea, they cause only minor increases in the objective parameters. They do not, therefore, provide an alternative to surgery and have only a temporary place in the management of patients in sinus rhythm with mitral stenosis who are awaiting surgery.", 
    "18": "A well-studied case of intermittent long QT syndrome in a 21-year-old female is presented. Electrophysiologic investigation repeated three times revealed changing sinoatrial and atrioventricular dysfunction and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient died 29 months after first hospitalization in a stage of electromechanical dissociation after runs of torsade de pointes although she had been treated with repeated anti-inflammatory therapy as well as high doses of propranolol. Postmortem examination demonstrated active inflammation of stellate ganglia. Myocardium appeared normal.", 
    "19": "When an 18 month old girl who had tetralogy of Fallot and episodes of severe cyanosis with loss of consciousness was treated with propranolol there was some improvement. But when the dose was increased she had further episodes of near syncope. Holter monitoring showed extreme intermittent bradycardia with pauses of up to 2.6 seconds. The episodes of near syncope and the bradycardia resolved after propranolol was stopped. Apparent failure of propranolol treatment may on rare occasions be related to drug induced bradycardia rather than to continued episodes of severe cyanosis.", 
    "20": "Thyroid hormones and beta-blockers both affect energy balance and the heart. The interaction of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) and the beta-blocker atenolol on some cardiac and energy balance parameters was therefore investigated. Stock-fed male Wistar rats (approximately 400 g) received 5 micrograms (expt 1) or 1.5 micrograms (expt 2) T3.100 g body wt-1.day-1 for 3 wk, with or without atenolol. In expt 3, rats were overfed with a \"cafeteria\" diet before and during the experiment and otherwise treated as in experiment 2. Compared with stock-fed (expt 1 and 2) or overfed (expt 3) controls, T3 caused an increase in food intake in experiments 1 and 2 but not in experiment 3. There was a large loss of body fat in all experiments, disproportionately greater than the body weight loss. Protein loss was significant only in experiment 1 and negligible in cafeteria rats. Heart rate and weight were increased, although heart composition remained unchanged. Atenolol, in a dose that abolished T3-induced tachycardia, did not modify any of the other T3 effects investigated, including the hypertrophy of the heart. These results indicate that T3-induced tachycardia can be abolished by concomitant treatment with a beta-blocker without altering parameters connected with energy balance, whereas protein loss caused by T3 can be attenuated by lowering the dose of T3 used and can be further blunted by dietary manipulation (cafeteria overfeeding).", 
    "21": "Propranolol prevents or delays the formation of aortic aneurysms in both the lathyritic turkey and the Blotchy mouse models. This finding in the turkey is reported to be a direct effect on crosslinking of aortic collagen and elastin, independent of effects on pulse and blood pressure. The present work was performed to evaluate this hypothesis in the mouse model by studying the effect of propranolol on the insolubility of matrix proteins of skin, which would isolate the phenomenon from direct hemodynamic effects. Eight 6- to 8-week-old Blotchy mice were fed a diet containing 0.10% (w/w) propranolol for 12 weeks, and six Blotchy controls ate regular chow. At sacrifice the skins were extracted with 8 M urea, and the soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed for hydroxyproline to determine the collagen contents. The elastin was estimated by subtracting the collagen from the insoluble fraction. There was a 147% increase in insoluble elastin with propranolol and a lesser increase of 54% in insoluble collagen. These results suggest that propranolol has a direct effect on crosslinking of matrix components.", 
    "22": "Postabsorptive resting metabolic rate (RMR), measured by indirect calorimetry, and the effect of iv propranolol administration were studied in 12 nonseptic patients with severe head injury by means of indirect calorimetry. Before propranolol RMR was moderately increased (126 +/- 10.4% of predicted values) whereas urinary excretion of catecholamines was markedly elevated (p less than .01 vs. normal values). RMR was significantly correlated with both resting heart rate (HR) (r = .72, p less than .01) and 24-h urinary N excretion (r = .85, p less than .001). The administration of iv propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) produced a rapid decrease in HR (-10 +/- 4%, p less than .001) and in RMR (-6.1 +/- 2.3%, p less than .001). Further administration of propranolol produced no additional reduction in either HR or RMR. We conclude that severely head-injured patients are moderately hypermetabolic in resting and postabsorptive conditions, and that acute iv propranolol administration induces a reduction of about one quarter of the resting hypermetabolism.", 
    "23": "The effects of rifampin (600 mg) once daily for 22 days on the total and fractional metabolic clearances of propranolol were determined in a group of six genetically extensive (EM) and six poor metabolizers (PM) of debrisoquin. The impaired ability of PMs to metabolize propranolol to the ring-oxidized metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol was confirmed. The total oral clearance of propranolol increased about fourfold in both phenotypes from 219.2 +/- 52.8 to 976.7 L/hr in the EMs and from 75.0 +/- 12.6 to 289.8 +/- 78.2 L/hr in the PMs. The extent of induction of glucuronidation was similar in the two groups. 4-Hydroxylation was induced in both phenotypes but the increase was fifteenfold greater in EMs than in PMs. This would imply that the cytochrome P-450 determined by the debrisoquin allele or some coinherited 4-hydroxylase(s) was induced to a greater extent in EMs than PMs.", 
    "24": "A number of studies have demonstrated that lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, eliminated almost exclusively by hepatic metabolism, are stereoselectively metabolized in human beings. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent of intermediate lipophilicity that is eliminated by both hepatic metabolism and renal excretion, is eliminated stereoselectively in the kidney. In the present study we examined the pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers of atenolol, a hydrophilic cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent that is eliminated almost exclusively by the kidney. A single 100 mg oral dose of racemic atenolol was administered to six healthy adult men. Concentrations of d- and l-atenolol in plasma and urine were measured by a stereospecific HPLC analytic procedure. In each subject the peak concentration of d-atenolol was greater than the peak concentration of l-atenolol (mean +/- SD of 420 +/- 81 ng/ml vs 366 +/- 61 ng/ml; p less than 0.05). The peak concentration of both enantiomers was reached at the same time in each subject (between 2 and 3 hours). The renal clearances of d- and l-atenolol were not significantly different (109.7 +/- 33.5 ml/min vs 112.5 +/- 36.7 ml/min), probably because the major route of renal elimination is glomerular filtration. The half-lives of d- and l-atenolol were not significantly different (mean +/- SD of 4.6 +/- 1.1 hours vs 5.2 +/- 0.9 hours). However, both the AUC and the amount excreted unchanged in the urine in 24 hours Ae [0-24]) were significantly greater for d-atenolol than for l-atenolol (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Healthy young black men and white men received single intravenous doses of metoprolol (0.07 mg/kg) or participated in an isoproterenol sensitivity study before and after metoprolol (0.07 mg/kg followed by 50 micrograms/min) in a randomized, crossed-over fashion. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The dose of isoproterenol versus change in heart rate response curves were constructed, and comparisons of dose ratio, ED50, Emax, and Ka, with the apparent association constant for metoprolol binding to beta 1-receptors, were made. There were no pharmacokinetic differences observed between the groups. The predicted Emax for the black group was 52.7 +/- 8.7 beats/min at a metoprolol concentration of 29.8 +/- 6.1 ng/ml, which was higher (p less than 0.05) than that in the white group, i.e., 43.7 +/- 7.3 beats/min at a concentration of 27.6 +/- 9.1 ng/ml. There were no differences in dose ratio, ED50, or Ka. The racial differences in beta 1-receptor responses to exogenous isoproterenol following metoprolol can simply be explained by an increase in beta 1-receptor activity in the black subjects, assuming homogeneity in cardiac beta 2-receptor responses.", 
    "26": "The hemodynamic effects of phasic variations in intrathoracic pressure (ITP) timed to the cardiac cycle were predicted by a mathematical model and were compared with data from canine experimental studies. The model was used to predict the hemodynamic effects of changing the onset of the ITP rise relative to the start of cardiac systole, as well as the hemodynamic effects of changes in the duration and amplitude of the ITP rise. The predictions of the model were compared with hemodynamic data from seven anesthetized dogs. Cardiac function was depressed with large doses of verapamil and propranolol, and the hearts were atrioventricular sequentially paced at a rate of 72 beats/min. Phasic ITP variations were generated by a perithoracic vest and were electronically timed to the cardiac cycle. The model predicted, and the experimental data confirmed, that phasic intrathoracic pressure variations generated by vest inflation, timed to the cardiac cycle, can augment both peak and mean aortic flow. The following predictions of the model were also confirmed by the experimental data: 1) Maximum flow augmentation occurs when the onset of the ITP rise is simultaneous with the onset of left ventricular isovolumic contraction, and the ITP rise has a duration of 400 msec. 2) The magnitude of the flow augmentation is a function of the amplitude of the ITP rise. The experimental data showed that there was little further flow augmentation when the ITP rise was greater than 30-40 mm Hg. 3) The magnitude of flow augmentation was inversely proportional to the peak left ventricular elastance (Emax). The best fit between the measured and predicted flow augmentations was obtained for an assumed Emax of 0.5 mm Hg/ml, while Emax measurements in three dogs, using a volume conductance catheter and transient vena caval occlusion, yielded values of 0.4-1.6 mm Hg/ml. Thus, both the mathematical model and canine experiments showed that relatively low-amplitude ITP variations, rising synchronously with the onset of cardiac systole and having an optimal duration, assist the failing heart by augmentation of aortic flow. The degree of cardiac assistance decreases if the ITP variations do not rise synchronously with the onset of systole, or if their duration is not optimal. Thus, properly applied ITP variations may be used as an efficient, noninvasive method to temporarily assist the failing heart.", 
    "27": "Cyclic replacement therapy using estrogen and progesterone was instituted in 28 patients with gonadal dysgenesis and 13 patients with hypopituitarism. When estriol was given at a dose of 2 mg per day, 10 patients (9 gonadal dysgenesis and 1 hypopituitarism) developed hyperreninemia and 3 of the 10 patients (all gonadal dysgenesis) were associated with hypertension. These side effects subsided within 6 months when the therapy was discontinued or the dose of estriol was decreased to 1 mg per day in addition to beta-blocker. Hypercholesterolemia was observed in 8 patients, but not related to high blood pressure. Attention should be paid to plasma renin activity and blood pressure when estrogen and progesterone are given for the development of genitalia in patients with gonadal dysgenesis.", 
    "28": "Quality of life was evaluated in a four-month randomised double-blind trial of verapamil compared with propranolol in the treatment of hypertension in 94 patients in the UK. Scores on a health status index, measuring activity and perceived health, increased in verapamil patients compared to a decrease in propranolol patients (P = 0.01). Measures of psychiatric morbidity also tended to improve with verapamil and deteriorate with propranolol. Propranolol patients reported more symptoms overall compared with verapamil (P less than 0.05). The prevalence of certain symptoms--headaches, weak limbs and slower walking pace, increased significantly with propranolol compared with verapamil, but constipation was more common in verapamil patients (P less than 0.05). After four months, diastolic blood pressure averaged 86.2 mmHg with verapamil and 90.3 mmHg with propranolol (P = 0.02). However, this difference in final blood pressure did not explain the more favourable quality of life scores with verapamil, and the data suggest that health-related well-being is higher with this drug.", 
    "29": "The antiischemic effects of the beta-1 selective beta-blocker metoprolol were studied in 9 hospitalized patients with rest angina in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. After 3 days of placebo treatment, the patients were randomized to metoprolol 100 mg or placebo bid for 2 days, followed by 2 days on the alternative treatment. During the last 24 hours of each period, Holter monitoring was performed. The patients marked angina attacks and NTG consumption on diary cards. Metoprolol significantly reduced the mean number of ST-changes (run-in: 5.7 +/- 0.6; metoprolol: 2.2 +/- 0.9; p = 0.013), the mean maximal ST-change during the attacks (run-in: 3.0 +/- 1.2 mm; metoprolol: 1.5 +/- 0.4 mm; p = 0.015), the mean duration of the ST-changes (run-in: 7.0 +/- 0.6 min; metoprolol: 3.2 +/- 1.0 min; p = 0.015), and the total ischemic time/24 (run-in: 41.1 +/- 7.6; metoprolol: 13.1 +/- 7.2 min; p = 0.008). None of these parameters was modified by placebo. However, the difference between metoprolol and the randomized placebo did not reach statistical significance. Metoprolol also reduced the number of chest pain attacks (p = 0.008), the duration of the attacks (p = 0.051), the severity score of the attacks (p = 0.008), and NTG consumption (p = 0.018) with respect to the run-in period. Six of the patients showed marked improvement on metoprolol while 3 showed only slight improvement or no change. No patients experienced worsening of angina or ST-changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "Thirty-one patients admitted with the first bleeding episode from oesophageal varices were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive oral propranolol, 160 mg daily, for 6 months (n = 15) or matching placebo (n = 16) for the same period. Endoscopy was performed each month during the 6 months and additionally after a further 3 months. The oesophageal varices were injected paravariceally with 2% aethoxysclerol until obliteration. If rebleeding occurred, additional sclerotherapy was performed. In the group treated with sclerotherapy and propranolol 3 patients rebled (20%; 95% confidence limits, 4%-48%), whereas 12 patients treated with sclerotherapy and placebo rebled (75%; 95% confidence limits, 48%-93%; p less than 0.05). There were no side effects to treatment in either of the groups, and it is concluded that administration of propranolol reduces the frequency of variceal rebleeding before variceal obliteration during a course of endoscopic sclerotherapy.", 
    "31": "In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study in 23 diabetic patients, insulin treated (N = 11) or noninsulin treated (N = 12), with mild to moderate hypertension, the hypotensive effects of captopril and atenolol were compared. Five patients had overt diabetic nephropathy. All patients received 50 mg twice daily of either drug. Treatment periods lasted 6 weeks and were preceded and separated by a placebo period. Two patients dropped out, one because of intermittent claudication during atenolol, one with cardiac arrhythmia during placebo. Blood pressure was reduced from 165 +/- 5/96 +/- 1 to 154 +/- 5/89 +/- 2 mmHg (mean +/- SEM: P less than 0.01) during captopril and from 171 +/- 5/98 +/- 1 to 159 +/- 6/89 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.01) during atenolol. These antihypertensive effects are not significantly different. There was a wide inter- and intraindividual variation in hypotensive response to both drugs, which may have important consequences for treatment strategies. No consistent differences between insulin and noninsulin treated patients were seen. Parameters of glycemic control did not change during any therapy, neither in insulin treated nor in non-insulin treated patients. Albuminuria and renal function did not change. During captopril treatment one patient complained of a non-productive cough. Two patients experienced a severe hypoglycemic reaction during atenolol. No other major side-effects were seen. In conclusion, this study showed equal hypotensive effectivity of 100 mg captopril and 100 mg atenolol daily in hypertensive diabetics, without evident effect on glycemic control.", 
    "32": "The influence of indomethacin on a reduction in forearm blood flow (FBF) induced by propranolol was investigated in eight healthy subjects. Indomethacin was orally administered (75 mg daily for 3 days) in a randomized cross-over design. Blood pressure (BP) was slightly decreased after a single oral administration of propranolol (40 mg) alone. However BP was slightly increased after the drug with indomethacin pretreatment. FBF was significantly decreased after propranolol with or without indomethacin. No significant difference was observed in FBF before or after propranolol between both groups. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was reduced by indomethacin pretreatment. These results suggest that the reduction in FBF induced by propranolol is not augmented with indomethacin.", 
    "33": "The clinical efficacy of flunarizine and of propranolol for the prevention of migraine attacks was assessed in a multicenter double-blind study lasting four months which was preceded by a single-blind placebo period of one month. For both drugs, more than half of the patients judged the effect to be good or very good. When considering the patients' daily logs, both drugs produced a significant reduction of the number of attacks. Propranolol furthermore significantly reduced the severity of attacks and the number of analgesics used during the attacks. In both groups no severe side effects were observed.", 
    "34": "We conducted a randomized open-labeled study of nifedipine versus propranolol for the initial prophylaxis of migraine. Propranolol was effective in 67% of patients (12/18) and well tolerated. Nifedipine was effective in only 30% of patients (6/20). The lack of overall efficacy of nifedipine was attributable to a high incidence of side effects, including an unusual symptom complex resembling erythromelalgia. These side effects led 45% (9/20) of the nifedipine patients to withdraw from the study within two weeks. By contrast, no patient (0/18) withdrew from the study within the first 2 weeks of propranolol therapy. We conclude that nifedipine is not an agent of first choice for the prophylaxis of migraine.", 
    "35": "Hemodynamic theories of atherogenesis suggest that the endothelial injury that initiates the process, as well as complications such as dissection and embolism, may be caused by arterial flow disturbances. Although treatment of high blood pressure prevents arteriolar complications such as brain haemorrhage and nephrosclerosis, little progress has been made in prevention of atherosclerotic events such as myocardial infarction. It is therefore desirable to develop methods for measuring the effects of antihypertensive drugs on the occurrence of such flow disturbances. We have evaluated quantitative spectral analysis of carotid Doppler signals in normals and in patients with carotid stenosis, in crossover studies of metoprolol vs placebo. Twenty healthy volunteers and 20 patients with carotid stenosis were treated in two double-blind placebo-controlled complete crossover studies, in which each subject took metoprolol 100 mg per os, and matching placebo, 1 hr before carotid scanning. In normals, peak frequency, mean frequency, and window index (WI) were measured at each of 2 sites in the left common, external and internal carotid arteries. Spectral broadening index (SBI), the ratio (peak-mean)/mean, was computed for comparison with window index (WI), the ratio of the area under the first 100 msec of the 25th percentile velocity curve to the area under the 75th percentile curve. Peak frequency, SBI and WI measure the extent of disturbance of arterial flow patterns, i.e. the extent to which flow has become non-laminar. Heart rate was reduced significantly by metoprolol, and in the external carotid artery, metoprolol significantly reduced both peak and mean frequency. Window index was not significantly changed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "We have previously shown that diphenylhydantoin (DPH)-stimulated renin release is mediated by, or requires the presence of, the renal nerves. In the present study, we examined the effects of adrenergic blockers in DPH-stimulated renin release in five groups of anesthetized dogs. In vehicle-treated dogs, DPH at a dose of 0.18 mg/kg-min increased renin secretion rate (RSR) from 56 +/- 14 to 269 +/- 60 and returned to 84 +/- 30 ng of angiotensin (ANG) l/hr-min (P less than 0.01, analysis of variance). In metoprolol-treated dogs, DPH produced no significant changes in RSR (90 +/- 28 to 144 +/- 67 to 100 +/- 51 ng of ANG l/hr-min). Likewise, in atenolol-treated dogs, RSR was 34 +/- 10 before, 59 +/- 15 during, and 23 +/- 8 ng of ANG l/hr-min after the infusion of DPH. In contrast, after pretreatment with ICI 118,551 (a beta 2 adrenoceptor antagonist), RSR was 37 +/- 9 before, 151 +/- 57 during, and 47 +/- 12 ng of ANG l/hr-min after the infusion of DPH (P less than 0.01). In phentolamine-treated dogs, RSR was 69 +/- 20 before, 295 +/- 53 during, and 95 +/- 17 ng of ANG l/hr-min after the infusion of DPH (P less than 0.01). Changes in renal blood flow, renal vascular resistance, and UNa V were in the same directions in all groups. These data suggest that DPH-stimulated renin release is mediated by beta 1 adrenoceptors since both beta 2 and alpha adrenoceptor antagonists have no effects on DPH-stimulated renin release.", 
    "37": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of metoprolol were studied in adult male rabbits given 3.2 mg/kg i.v. before and during liver failure. The partition of metoprolol between blood cells and plasma averaged 1.14 in both conditions. Plasma protein binding, concentration-independent, was 32% and 17% in normal and pathological status, respectively. With normal liver function the terminal elimination half-life for the drug was 0.54-0.96 h, rising to 1.0-2.1 h in liver failure. Differences of the same order were observed for total plasma drug clearance (average 3.7 vs 1.5 1/h/kg), MRT (0.77 vs 1.92 h), AUC (0.9 vs 2.2 mg h/l) and k10 (3.17 vs 1.80 h-1). Liver impairment did not affect the volume of distribution of the central compartment, the steady-state volume of distribution and the other intercompartmental rate constants. Although metoprolol was eliminated in the urine, the amount excreted was low (1.5% of the administered dose) in both conditions. The pharmacokinetic model was extended by an 'effect compartment', which has no influence on the predetermined mass of drug in the body, to analyse the relationship between heart rate fall and changes in metoprolol plasma concentrations. After drug administration, heart rate fell rapidly about 90 beats in both states. The mean unbound plasma concentration producing 50% of this reduction was double during liver failure compared to normal condition (0.03 vs 0.07 mg/l), but the temporal aspects of drug equilibration with site of action were similar.", 
    "38": "The use of antihypertensive drugs (AHD) in the area n degrees 5 of the Institut Catal\u00e0 de la Salut was evaluated for the period October 1986-December 1987. The unit of measure was the DDD (daily defined dose) per 1,000 population individuals per day. The overall use of AHD in 1987 was 49.31 DDDs/1,000 individuals/day; it was distributed among diuretics (53.5% of all AHD), beta-blockers (11.3%), and other AHD (35.2%). The most commonly prescribed drugs, by decreasing frequency order, were combinations of low ceiling diuretics with potassium sparing drugs, and of rauwolfia alkaloids with diuretics, followed by nifedipine, chlortalidone and furosemide. The interannual evaluation disclosed an increase of 18.6% in 1987 as compared with the preceding year, mostly at the expense of beta-blockers. On the other hand, there was a tendency to refrain from the use of fixed dose drug associations. This is a criterion of better use of antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "39": "In the present study, the molecular structure of xenobiotics has been successfully linked to their effect on the oxidase activity of cytochrome P-450, determined as microsomal hydrogen peroxide formation. A homologous series of 5-alkyl-5-ethyl barbiturates and a heterologous series of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was used. The logarithm of the rate of microsomal hydrogen peroxide formation could be correlated with the logarithm of the apparent partition (n-octanol/buffer) coefficient for the barbiturate derivatives according to a parabolic function. The statistics of the correlation improved considerably by applying a bilinear model in order to fit the data. This probably indicates that both transport of the substrate to cytochrome P-450 and interaction with hydrophobic substrate binding sites of cytochrome P-450 are involved in the modulating effect of substrates on the oxidase function of cytochrome P-450. With the series of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists no clear-cut structure activity relationship with regard to the oxidase activity was apparent at first sight. However, when the inhibitory effect of the beta-antagonists on the 'cytochrome P-450 metabolic intermediate (MI) complex' formation that occurs during the microsomal biotransformation of 33 microM tofenacine was studied a relationship with the lipophilicity could be demonstrated. It is known that MI complex formation occurs with specific subforms of cytochrome P-450. By using this inhibitory activity of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, the interaction of the compounds becomes restricted to these specific subforms of cytochrome P-450. In both the oxidase activity as well as the MI complex formation phenobarbital induced cytochrome P-450 is involved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "To elucidate the role of alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic activities in pressure overload hypertrophy, changes of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors were measured by radioligand binding assay, and the preventive effects of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade on cardiac hypertrophy were assessed in guinea pigs after aortic banding. Five days after banding, dry weight of left ventricle had not increased, though wet weight increased due to marked intercellular oedema. In this period, the maximum binding capacity of [3H] prazosin increased to 31.1 (SEM 2.2) fmol.mg-1 from (sham operation) 17.0(2.1) fmol.mg protein-1, p less than 0.01, whereas the maximum binding capacity of [3H]dihydroalprenolol did not increase: 143(16) fmol.mg-1 (banded) v 153(13) fmol.mg-1 (sham). Three weeks after aortic banding, the maximum binding capacity of both ligands increased to 45.6(5.5) fmol.mg-1 and 232(21) fmol.mg-1, respectively, accompanied by a significant increase in left ventricular dry weight, from 0.46(0.02) mg.g-1 (sham) to 0.62(0.08) mg.g-1 (banded), p less than 0.01. Continuous subcutaneous administration of the alpha 1-blocker bunazosin (0.1 mg.kg-1.d-1) significantly attenuated the increase in left ventricular dry weight whereas the beta-blocker propranolol (5 mg.kg-1.d-1) did not: 0.55(0.03) v 0.66(0.04) mg.g-1 respectively, after 3 weeks. These results show that pressure overload elicited an increase in myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptors before the onset of cardiac hypertrophy, and that an alpha 1-blocker could prevent the development of hypertrophy in the pressure overloaded heart.", 
    "41": "The influence of lactate on human adipocytes lipolysis and the possible relationship between lactate-induced metabolic effects and beta-adrenoceptor binding sites were investigated. beta-sites were identified in membranes with (125I)-cyanopindolol and in intact cells with (125I)-cyanopindolol and (3H)-CGP 12177. Lactate reduced isoproterenol-induced lipolysis in a dose-response fashion and such inhibition became significant only at 16 mmol/l lactate. Exposure of human fat cells to 16 mmol/l lactate significantly reduced beta-adrenoceptors density on crude membranes. When the binding assay was performed on intact cells using (125I)-cyanopindolol at 37 degrees C, the radioligand identified the same number of receptors, regardless of the presence of lactate in the preincubation medium. When (3H)-CGP 12177 was used, it bound to about 35% less receptors in lactate pre-treated cells than in control. Seemingly, at 37 degrees C, because of its lipophilicity, (125I)-cyanopindolol can cross the plasma membrane and bind to intracellular sites whereas, (3H)-CGP 1277, due to its hydrophilicity, identifies surface receptors only. Thus, the present in vitro study provides evidence that high levels of lactate, similar to the concentrations usually achieved in overt lactic acidosis, are able per se to inhibit human lipolysis and to redistribute beta-adrenoceptors from cell surface to a domain not accessible to hydrophilic ligands.", 
    "42": "The influence of the central adrenergic system on basal prolactin secretion was investigated in the rat. Several selective adrenoceptor blockers were centrally administered and their effects on prolactin secretion were observed. Blockade of beta-1 receptors by practolol, beta-2 receptors by IPS 339 and alpha-2 receptors by DG-5128 did not modify basal prolactin secretion, but alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade by prazosin strongly enhanced prolactin plasma levels. These findings suggest that noradrenergic pathways in the central nervous system exert inhibitory tone on basal prolactin secretion, and that this effect seems to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenoceptors.", 
    "43": "203 patients with a diastolic blood pressure higher than 100 mmHg were included in a randomized, double-blind trial to compare the antihypertensive efficacy of different daily dosages of bopindolol (Wandonorm) (0.05 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg) and nifedipine (2 x 20 mg). After 4 weeks of therapy blood pressure normalization could be achieved in 23.7% (0.05 mg), 32.5% (0.5 mg), 67.5% (1 mg), 64.1% (2 mg) and 59.0% (nifedipine) of the patients, respectively. In a subgroup of 159 patients the study was continued with an 8-week dose titration and a 16-week observation. At the end of the study blood pressure normalization was achieved in 91% and 94% of the patients treated with nifedipine and bopindolol, respectively. Most patients of the bopindolol-group needed 1 mg once daily as compared to those on the nifedipine who required 20 mg b.i.d. Because of intolerable side effects therapy was discontinued in 3 out of 162 patients on bopindolol and in 3 out of 41 patients on nifedipine. As compared to nifedipine the tolerance of bopindolol was judged significantly superior because tiredness and dizziness (32% vs 9%) and leg edema (20% vs. 6%) were recorded much more frequently in nifedipine treated patients. In 135 elderly patients \"quality of life\" was assessed upon by use of the \"Nuremberg-Alters-Selbstbeurteilungs-Skala\" (NAS), which refers to social contacts, mental and physical performance, sleep disturbances and general well-being.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "Cardiohemodynamic effects and the beta-blocking action of a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, bopindolol (Sandonorm) were compared with those of pindolol in conscious unrestrained dogs. The intravenous injection of pindolol (3-100 micrograms/kg) increased the heart rate and decreased the total peripheral resistance dose-dependently and markedly, while the same doses of bopindolol had no effect on the heart rate and decreased the total peripheral resistance only at the maximum dose (100 micrograms/kg). These changes were antagonized by propranolol (3 mg/kg). Isoprenaline (isoproterenol, 0.1 microgram/kg)-induced tachycardia was inhibited dose-dependently by both beta-blockers to similar degrees. While the decrease in the total peripheral resistance by isoprenaline was inhibited by pindolol dose-dependently, the inhibition by lower doses of bopindolol was not so marked; the inhibition became greater as the doses of bopindolol were increased. These results indicate that bopindolol is a beta 1-selective beta-blocker with an affinity to this subtype of the beta-adrenoceptor comparable to that of pindolol. Unlike pindolol, it exerted no partial agonist activity at the beta-adrenoceptor. Instead it produced the partial agonist activity at the beta 2-adrenoceptor at the highest dose tested.", 
    "45": "The lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blocking (BAB) drugs metipranolol, propranolol and exaprolol significantly decreased 48/80- and A23187-induced 32P incorporation into rat mast cell phospholipids. Exaprolol was the most active, followed by propranolol and metipranolol. Atenolol and metipranolol significantly decreased the 48/80-stimulated, and metipranolol and exaprolol the A23187-stimulated 3H-arachidonic acid liberation from isolated mast cells.", 
    "46": "In dogs anaesthetized with pentobarbital, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was occluded for 90 min. so that about 1/2 of the original flow was allowed to flow (partial occlusion). Bevantolol (a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) or propranolol (a reference drug) was injected intravenously 30 min. after partial occlusion. Regional myocardial pH was measured by a micro glass pH electrode inserted in the LAD area. Partial occlusion decreased myocardial pH by 0.62 to 0.74. Bevantolol (1.0 mg/kg) or propranolol (1.0 mg/kg) significantly increased myocardial pH, that had been decreased by partial occlusion, within 60 min. after the injection. Restoration of myocardial [H+] (defined as return towards a lower [H+] to the preocclusion level) (calculated from the pH data) induced by bevantolol and that induced by propranolol were 64.0 and 66.4% (measured 60 min. after the injection), respectively. Bevantolol or propranolol decreased heart rate also. Even in the paced heart, bevantolol restored the myocardial [H+] that had been increased by partial occlusion. These results suggest that bevantolol has a favorable effect on the ischaemic myocardium as has propranolol, and that the pH effect of bevantolol is not primarily due to a decrease in heart rate.", 
    "47": "Lungs isolated from 7-week-old rats were perfused with pH 7.4, oxygenated Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer solution containing 2.5 micrograms mL-1 of propranolol and 3 to 5% BSA at the recirculation rate of 4 to 16 mL min-1, at 37 degrees C for 60 min. The extent of propranolol metabolism after 60 min was less than 2.3% of the initial load under any in-vitro perfusion condition. Therefore, the amount disappearing from the perfusion medium was considered as being predominantly that taken up by tissue. Under all experimental conditions, perfusate drug level declined bi-exponentially with time. Apparent in-vitro pulmonary clearance of propranolol was not affected by the increase of BSA level from 3 to 5%. When the perfusate BSA level was fixed at 3%, the lowest recirculation rate (4 mL min-1) yielded the smallest clearance (about 0.15 mL min-1 g-1) but almost constant clearance value (about 0.40 mL min-1 g-1) was obtained at the rate ranging from 8 to 16 mL min-1. The tissue to medium concentration ratio of propranolol, after the perfusion with 3 to 5% BSA at the rate of 8 to 16 mL min-1, was approximately 35, whereas that with 3% BSA at 4 mL min-1 was reduced to about 20. The findings suggest evidence for flow-dependent in-vitro pulmonary clearance of propranolol.", 
    "48": "1. 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and flesinoxan, agents which show high affinity and selectivity for 5-HT1A receptors, were administered intravenously in doses of 0.003 to 0.1 and 0.01 to 0.3 mg kg-1 respectively to 5 rabbits each. Their effects were compared with those of the centrally acting agent and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, guanfacine, 0.01-0.3 mg kg-1, administered to a group of 5 rabbits. Five further rabbits were used as controls and treated with the vehicle of the active agents. 2. Both flesinoxan and 8-OH-DPAT induced similar systemic and regional haemodynamic changes. Both lowered mean arterial pressure and heart rate. The principal blood pressure lowering mechanism was vasodilatation; cardiac output changed minimally despite the falls in heart rate and myocardial contractile force. 3. With guanfacine the maximal fall of blood pressure was comparable to that obtained with the 5-HT1A receptor ligands; however, in contrast to the latter, the dose-response curve was U-shaped, the highest dose eliciting a pressor effect with reversal of the vasodilatation. 4. Widespread peripheral vasodilatation was found with all the agents in the splanchnic circulation and also in the brain and skeletal muscle. A weak tendency towards vasodilatation was found in the kidneys where the dose-response curve was bell-shaped for guanfacine. 5. This spectrum of activity is different from that of peripheral vasodilators, such as calcium antagonists, potassium channel activating agents or hydralazine; it is, however, consistent with the putative mechanism of action of these compounds to reduce peripheral sympathetic tone by a central mechanism of action.", 
    "49": "1. The distribution of sympathetic adrenergic nerves on the rat middle cerebral artery and on the arterioles which originated from it was determined by use of gloxylic histochemistry. 2. Whereas the middle cerebral artery and proximal arterioles arising from this artery received a sympathetic innervation, the distal regions of the same arterioles were devoid of innervation. 3. The arteries and arterioles which were innervated were depolarized by noradrenaline in the combined presence of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Those which were not innervated were not depolarized by noradrenaline. 4. ATP depolarized all arteries and arterioles examined. 5. These observations are discussed with respect to the similarities and differences between gamma-adrenoceptors and P2 purinoceptors.", 
    "50": "To study beta-adrenoceptor antagonist-induced changes in human vascular beta-adrenoceptors, we determined the effects of chronic treatment with different beta-adrenoceptor antagonists without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) on beta 2-adrenoceptor density (assessed by (-)-[125I]-iodopindolol binding) in human saphenous vein membranes obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. In patients chronically treated with the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol or sotalol, the density of saphenous vein beta 2-adrenoceptors was significantly higher than in control (i.e. patients not treated with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists), whereas in patients chronically treated with the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists metoprolol or bisoprolol it was not different from control. It is concluded that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists without ISA increase human saphenous vein beta 2-adrenoceptors in a subtype-selective fashion.", 
    "51": "The effects of arterial chemoreceptor activation by nicotine on coronary artery diameter was studied in anaesthetized, artificially ventilated dogs. Left circumflex coronary artery diameter, coronary blood flow, calculated mean coronary resistance, systemic arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured. In control dogs (n = 10) the injection of nicotine (100 micrograms) into the carotid artery evoked an increase of arterial pressure (+22 +/- 9 mm Hg) and a decrease in heart rate (-36 +/- 13 beats/min), and tended to increase coronary blood flow (+7 +/- 4 ml/min). Intracarotid nicotine had no effect on large coronary artery diameter (+0.02 +/- 0.03 mm) or total coronary resistance (+0.04 +/- 0.09 mm Hg min/ml) under these conditions. When heart rate was controlled by (1) beta-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol, 1 mg/kg i.v.) plus pacing of the right ventricle (n = 4) or (2) beta-adrenoceptor blockade plus bilateral vagotomy (n = 7), the chemoreflex-induced constriction of the large coronary artery (-0.07 +/- 0.02 mm and -0.12 +/- 0.03 mm, respectively; p less than 0.05). In contrast, there was no chemoreflex-induced change in total coronary resistance after beta-adrenoceptor blockade plus pacing (+0.01 +/- 0.09 mm Hg min/ml, but after beta-adrenoceptor blockade plus vagotomy coronary resistance was increased (+0.75 +/- 0.31 mm Hg min/ml; p less than 0.05). The constriction of both large and small coronary arteries was abolished by phentolamine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.). These results suggest that carotid body chemoreceptor stimulation by nicotine can produce reflex alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated constriction of both large and small coronary arteries, and that the constriction of the small vessels is balanced by vagally-mediated dilatation.", 
    "52": "On the example of a 63-year-old neurotic patient dependent on alcohol and anxiolytic drugs the author draws attention to the risk of the development of a tardive dyskinesia after the long-term administration of \"neurotic doses\" of neuroleptics to non-psychotic patients. The author emphasizes the greater danger in the group of patients dependent on alcohol. He describes an attempt of concurrent treatment of neurosis, tardive dyskinesia and hypertension by a non-selective beta-blocker metopranolol (Trimepranol Spofa) administered for eight months. This drug was according to the author's information administered for the first time in tardive dyskinesia. It seems that it improves tardive dyskinesia in much smaller doses than anxiety and sleep disorders.", 
    "53": "Haemodynamic changes in 81 patients undergoing surgery for renal transplantation were studied. They were allocated to three groups depending on whether or not they had chronic hypertension and which drugs were used to control it. The patients in Group I (N = 18, 22%) were normotensive and were not receiving antihypertensive therapy, those in Group II (N = 21, 26%) were taking beta-blockers and those in Group III (N = 42, 52%) both beta-blockers and vasodilating agents. Antihypertensive medication was continued as prescribed until surgery. No anticholinergic premedication was given. All patients received a standardized anaesthesia which included thiopentone, fentanyl, vecuronium and isoflurane. Mean arterial blood pressure and mean heart rate were lowest in Group I compared with the other groups immediately before induction, following vecuronium and thiopentone administration, and after tracheal intubation (P less than 0.05). After the 10-min induction period, blood pressure and heart rate values did not differ between the groups. Although before and during surgery and anaesthesia central venous pressure did not differ between the groups, CVP was higher in Group I postoperatively compared with the other groups (P less than 0.05). No serious anaesthesia-related complications occurred.", 
    "54": "In a placebo-controlled, randomized, prospective, parallel, double-blind trial, corneal sensitivity was studied in 35 people with healthy eyes before and 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after application of carteolol 2% (20 eyes) and metipranolol 0.6% (20 eyes). Oxybuprocain 0.4% (local anesthetic, 10 eyes) served as a positive control substance, NaCl 0.9% (20 eyes) as a negative one (placebo). The test subjects assessed subjective tolerance of the test drugs on a four-step scale. Carteolol 2% did not decrease corneal sensitivity. There was no statistically significant difference between this group and the placebo group. Metipranolol 0.6% led to a decrease in corneal sensitivity of up to 14 mg (median), lasting up to 15 minutes. The decrease brought about by metipranolol 0.6% is about one-half of that caused by betaxolol 0.5%, but greater than that caused by timolol 0.5%. Oxybuprocain 0.4% causes corneal sensitivity to decrease below the measuring range of Cochet and Bonnet's esthesiometer (200 mg) for about 10 minutes. All but three eyes had returned to their initial corneal sensitivity values after 30 minutes. NaCl 0.9% eye drops do not decrease corneal sensitivity. On the contrary, a gradual increase in sensitivity (exercise effect) was found, which differed significantly from the initial value as of the 10th minute after drug application. These results confirm that it is necessary to check corneal sensitivity during topical beta-blocker therapy. \"Responders,\" \"sensitives,\" contact lens wearers, and patients with decreased corneal sensitivity (e.g., patients suffering from open-angle glaucoma with disk excavations, after cataract extraction or corneal transplantation) need frequent supervision.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "55": "1. The effects on heart rate, blood pressure and pulmonary function of single oral doses of celiprolol hydrochloride (400 mg), and propranolol (40 mg) were compared with placebo in 12 healthy volunteers, in a double-blind three-period crossover study. 2. Celiprolol had no effect on heart rate while propranolol caused a significant reduction compared with placebo. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by propranolol but not celiprolol, whereas standing diastolic blood pressure was lowered by both drugs. 3. The maximal expiratory flow at 50% vital capacity (MEF.50), was significantly lower after propranolol compared with placebo and celiprolol. Celiprolol had no effect on the flow-volume loop parameters. 4. Effective pulmonary blood flow was significantly increased by celiprolol, but reduced by propranolol. 5. A high incidence of subjective side-effects were experienced on celiprolol (10/12; particularly unpleasant in 5). Side-effects were experienced to a lesser extent on placebo (8/12). Only one volunteer experienced a side-effect on propranolol. 6. Oral celiprolol exerts its hypotensive effect by vasodilatation without reflex tachycardia. It does not cause airways obstruction in healthy subjects.", 
    "56": "1. The interaction between the vascular renin-angiotensin system and presynaptic beta-adrenoreceptors was examined in male and female normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats, using the in vitro perfused mesentery preparation. 2. Enhancement of the pressor response to periarterial nerve stimulation by isoprenaline was shown to be significantly greater in preparations from male and female spontaneously hypertensive rats compared to corresponding preparations from normotensive Wistar rats. 3. In preparations from normotensive and hypertensive animals, the potentiating effect of isoprenaline was prevented by pretreatment with propranolol or ICI 118 551, but not atenolol, implicating a beta 2-adrenoreceptor. 4. Angiotensin II enhanced the responses to peripheral nerve stimulation in preparation from normotensive and hypertensive animals. Enhancement was significantly greater in preparations from hypertensive animals. 5. The potentiation caused by isoprenaline was blocked by the angiotensin II receptor antagonist [Sar1-Ile8] angiotensin II, and by captopril. The potentiation following angiotensin II was unaffected by ICI 118 551. 6. These results suggest that stimulation of presynaptic beta 2-adrenoreceptors activates a localized angiotensin II system. No significant differences in this facilitatory system were observed between male and female animals, but the potentiation caused by activation of this system was considerably greater in the spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "57": "The biliary elimination of the beta-1-receptor blocking agent talinolol was investigated after intravenous administration of 30 mg in 6 patients with a T-tube drain after cholecystectomy. Serum concentration decreased in a biexponential manner with a median terminal half-life time of 4.4 h (range: 3.0-6.2 h). In some patients a second peak of the serum level was found. Concentration-time curves in bile paralleled serum profiles. The bile:serum concentration ratio (b:s-ratio) ranged from 24 to 98. The biliary clearance amounted to 43 ml/h.kg (range: 13-212 ml/h.kg). The median of the amount of talinolol eliminated by bile was 2.8 mg (range: 1.1-7.4 mg). It is concluded that talinolol undergoes an enterohepatic circulation. However, the amount eliminated cannot provide a sufficient explanation for the second peak, observed in some patients.", 
    "58": "We studied the competitive interaction of terbutaline and two beta blockers, metoprolol and oxprenolol, with different cardioselectivity for the beta-2 adrenoceptor. Using pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling in nonsteady-state conditions, of the antagonism by the beta blockers of the terbutaline-induced hypokalemia, the beta blocker beta-2 selectivity was quantitated in the terms of IC50 values representing plasma concentrations resulting in half-receptor occupancy. Six healthy subjects were given an 0.5-mg s.c. dose of terbutaline on three occasions: 1) 1 hr after p.o. administration of a placebo; 2) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p.o.; and 3) 1 hr after 80 mg of oxprenolol p.o. During 7 hr after terbutaline administration drug concentrations and effects were monitored. Oxprenolol decreased both terbutaline volume of distribution (-69%) and clearance (-63%) and increased its area under plasma concentrations vs. time curve (+157%). Such effects of metoprolol on terbutaline pharmacokinetics were not observed. The dynamic model offered a good description of the observed effects. The apparent IC50 values varied between 42 and 68 ng/ml (mean, 54 ng/ml) for metoprolol and between 3.6 and 4.7 ng/ml (mean, 4.1 ng/ml) for oxprenolol. In view of these results, and comparing them with apparent beta-1 IC50 values as reported in the literature, metoprolol can be considered a relatively beta-1 selective agent. Pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling of the interaction of beta-2 sympathicomimetics and beta blocking agents after single dosing, seems to be a suitable method for the determination of the relative beta-2 selectivity of the antagonist.", 
    "59": "The effects of acute in vitro epinephrine treatment (40 nM, 1 hr) on stimulus-induced neurotransmitter overflow from the isolated perfused kidney were examined. This treatment resulted in the release of both norepinephrine and epinephrine upon nerve stimulation but no increase in fractional stimulus-induced overflow. Experiments utilizing beta and/or alpha adrenoceptor blockade revealed that beta adrenoreceptor blockade alone had no effect on overflow but that a dose-dependent decrease in stimulus-induced overflow was produced by beta adrenoceptor blockade after alpha adrenoceptor blockade. Thus, under normal conditions the facilitatory influence of epinephrine via prejunctional beta adrenoceptors is masked by the prejunctional alpha adrenoceptor negative feedback loop. The effects of extraneuronal presentation of isoproterenol, salbutamol and epinephrine on stimulus-induced neurotransmitter overflow also were examined. In the absence of alpha adrenoceptor blockade, only epinephrine failed to enhance neurotransmitter overflow. After competitive alpha adrenoceptor blockade, all three agents produced significant increases in stimulus-induced neurotransmitter overflow from the rat kidney, although alpha adrenoceptor stimulation appeared to limit this effect at high agonist concentrations. We conclude that the dominance of prejunctional alpha adrenoceptors in the rat kidney results in the inability of epinephrine to produce beta adrenoceptor-mediated facilitation of neurotransmitter overflow even when it is incorporated into renal neurotransmitter stores and coreleased with endogenous norepinephrine upon nerve stimulation.", 
    "60": "The importance of sympathetic neural influences in regulating coronary blood flow has been well established. However, central nervous system pathways responsible for these effects are largely unknown. In a feline model, we have identified a site in medullary reticular formation that may play a role in neural control of the coronary circulation. Changes in heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (AP), Doppler coronary flow velocity (CBFV), and femoral flow velocity (FBFV) were measured in 67 anesthetized cats. Electrical stimulation in a specific region of the right medullary lateral reticular formation produced elevations in HR (12 +/- 2% from 156 beats/min), AP (41 +/- 6% from 83 mmHg), CBFV (33 +/- 7%), and femoral vascular resistance index (136 +/- 27%). After beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol), a transient (5-15 s) stimulus-induced decrease in CBFV was observed in 67% of animals, with a 55 +/- 6% increase in coronary vascular resistance index, not the result of autoregulation. Ipsilateral stellate ganglionectomy or systemic alpha 1-adrenergic blockade abolished the CBFV decrement. Microinjection of L-glutamate into this medullary region failed to elicit either pressor or coronary vasomotor responses. It is concluded that electrical stimulation in a specific site within medullary reticular formation produces neurogenic coronary vasoconstriction as part of a more generalized activation of central sympathetic fibers. This brain stem site may play an important role in reflex or behaviorally mediated coronary responses.", 
    "61": "PURPOSE AND SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The advisability of treating isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) in the elderly is a matter of debate. We therefore surveyed current clinical practices for ISH among members of the New Jersey Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians-New Jersey Chapter (n = 1,514). To our knowledge, no such survey focusing on ISH had previously been reported. Two rounds of questionnaires were mailed three weeks apart in April and May of 1985, followed by a phone survey of non-respondents in June and July. A third mailing was performed where appropriate.", 
    "62": "The response rate was 87 percent. For ISH in patients aged 60 and older, 89 percent of the 1,318 respondents reported using drug therapy. A diuretic was chosen as the first-line drug by 67.5 percent of respondents. The most common second-line drug choices were a beta blocker (28 percent), a central alpha agonist (19 percent), and a diuretic (18.5 percent). The patient's age entered strongly into decisions on drug use. Although 55 percent of respondents would use drug therapy at a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or less for persons aged 60 to 69, only 35 percent would do so for persons aged 70 to 79, and 26 percent for persons aged 80 and older. For all patient age groups, older physicians were more likely to consider drug therapy than were younger physicians. Among specialty groups, general practitioners were the most likely to consider drug therapy and cardiologists the least likely to do so for all patient age groups. Family physicians and general internists appeared to have very similar practice patterns regarding definition and treatment of ISH.", 
    "63": "The overall message of the survey results is that the majority of physicians questioned use drug therapy, usually a diuretic or a beta blocker, for some patients with ISH. However, no widely accepted standard practice on the definition and management of ISH in persons aged 60 and older was observed.", 
    "64": "To determine the effects of beta blockade on hemodynamics during increasing levels of treadmill exercise, 10 healthy volunteers were studied after 1 week of placebo, and then after 1 week of treatment with oral propranolol, 80 mg twice daily, or dilevalol, 400 mg once daily. The study was randomized and double-blind, with a crossover sequence. Hemodynamics were measured by CO2 rebreathing at rest and at 25, 50, 75 and 100% of VO2 max. After placebo, cardiac output increased from 5.8 +/- 2.1 (rest), to 19.4 +/- 6.4 liters/min (100% VO2 max), mainly due to an increase in heart rate from 84 +/- 6 to 169 +/- 15 beats/min. Stroke volume increased from 70 +/- 27 (rest), to 137 +/- 65 ml (25% VO2 max), and then leveled off to 116 +/- 41 at 100% VO2 max. After both beta blockers, exercise cardiac output was maintained at 100% VO2 max: 20.1 +/- 9.3 liters/min with propranolol and 19.1 +/- 8.6 with dilevalol. However, a significant reduction versus placebo values was observed for cardiac output at 25% VO2 max, from 13.7 +/- 5.9 during placebo, to 9.4 +/- 2.5 during propranolol, and to 9.6 +/- 2.3 during dilevalol (both p less than 0.01 vs placebo). Maintenance of cardiac output with both beta blockers at higher levels of exercise came from an increased stroke volume (p less than 0.05 vs placebo), while heart rate (in beats/min) was greatly reduced (propranolol 61.6 +/- 9.4 rest, 90.1 +/- 10.7 at 100% VO2 max; dilevalol 70.8 +/- 6.4 rest, 99.2 +/- 11.8 at 100% VO2 max, p less than 0.01 vs placebo for each).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "Sotalol is unique among beta-adrenergic blocking drugs in possessing significant class III antiarrhythmic actions. The present study was designed to assess the relative concentration dependence of beta-blocking and class III actions of sotalol and to relate the findings to concentrations achieved during oral sotalol therapy in humans. Measurements were made in anesthetized dogs under control conditions, and then in the presence of a series of stable sotalol plasma concentrations produced by sequential loading and maintenance infusions. Beta-blocking effects of sotalol, determined by attenuation of the chronotropic actions of isoproterenol, were seen at the lowest dose used. Increases in atrial and ventricular refractory periods (observed in dogs with autonomic blockade to exclude beta-receptor-mediated or reflex autonomic effects) required much larger doses of sotalol. Half-maximal beta-blocking effects occurred at an average sotalol concentration of 0.8 +/- 0.3 mg/liter, an order of magnitude lower than the concentrations required for half-maximal effects on atrial (6.9 +/- 1.2 mg/liter, p less than 0.01) and ventricular (6.8 +/- 2.8 mg/liter, p less than 0.05) refractoriness. These results show that substantially higher concentrations are needed for the class III effects of sotalol than for its beta-blocking action. These pharmacodynamic differences need to be considered in evaluating the antiarrhythmic efficacy and mechanisms of this unusual drug.", 
    "66": "The beta-adrenergic and calcium channel blocking agents are known to reduce heart rate and alter myocardial contractility. More recent evidence suggests that both agents affect the metabolic consequences of ischemia, independent of their effects on heart rate and contractility. We used a low-flow model of ischemia in swine with heart rate held constant by atrial pacing. Blood was shunted from the carotid artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery through a controlled-flow roller pump to assess the threshold flow for the rise in extracellular potassium ([K+]e) and fall in extracellular pH (pHe) associated with ischemia during control situations and after the administration of either propranolol or verapamil. We also measured the changes in activation delay and contractility associated with graded flow reductions in the presence and absence of these drugs. We found that when heart rate is held constant, 1) verapamil shifts the threshold flow for [K+]e and pHe to lower levels, but propranolol does not; 2) verapamil lessens activation delay, while propranolol aggravates the delay; and 3) verapamil reduces afterload and selectively depresses contractility in the reperfused ischemic zone. We conclude that the calcium channel blockers and the beta-adrenergic-blocking agents have different effects and possibly different modes of action and should not be considered interchangeable when evaluating therapeutic options for patients with ischemic heart disease.", 
    "67": "Our purpose was to determine if there are basal adrenergic influences on the coronary circulation in humans. We studied 56 patients with denervated hearts after cardiac transplantation and 19 normally innervated patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries. Coronary blood flow velocity was measured during cardiac catheterization with a subselective 3F intracoronary Doppler catheter. Heart rate was controlled by atrial pacing. Epicardial coronary artery diameter was measured by automated analysis of digital coronary angiograms. Coronary flow reserve was assessed by intracoronary papaverine hydrochloride (12 mg) injections. Regional sympathetic blockade was produced by intracoronary injections of phentolamine (3 mg, alpha) and propranolol (2 mg, beta) or metoprolol (3 mg, beta 1). After alpha-blockade, mean arterial pressure fell significantly (p less than 0.05) in both the denervated transplant (-5.8 +/- 1.5%) (mean +/- SEM) and normally innervated patients (-12.6 +/- 3.2%). Reductions in coronary flow velocity also were observed in these groups (-8.2 +/- 2.3% and -9.2 +/- 5.8%, respectively). Calculated coronary vascular resistance was unchanged. Similar changes were seen when patients were pretreated with beta-blockade before alpha-blockade. Nonspecific beta-blockade did not affect mean arterial pressure but decreased coronary velocity (innervated, -11.6 +/- 3.9%; denervated, -9.3 +/- 2.4%) and increased coronary vascular resistance (innervated, 15.4 +/- 6.7%; denervated, 10.2 +/- 3.7%). Coronary vascular resistance did not rise in either group after selective beta 1-blockade with metoprolol. Coronary flow reserve did not change in either patient group after either alpha- or beta-blockade. Changes in epicardial coronary artery diameter were small and generally not significant. These data suggest that alpha-receptor-mediated vascular tone is negligible in both denervated transplant patients and normally innervated patients. Additionally, the increase in vascular resistance after nonselective beta-blockade is the result of direct beta 2 vascular effects. Our data further suggest that there is little adrenergically mediated epicardial artery tone (either humoral or neural) at rest and that maximal vasodilator responses are not limited by adrenergically mediated vasomotor tone.", 
    "68": "Adrenaline was effective in aggregating the melanosomes both in innervated as well as denervated melanophores. Isotonic KCl could induce pigment aggregation only in innervated melanophores. Adrenaline- and K+-induced pigment aggregation response in these melanophores was blocked by phentolamine: propranolol failed to do so. It is suggested that the chromatic nerves in the fish, Labeo rohita are adrenergic and via post-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptors, control the melanosome aggregation.", 
    "69": "Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms of [125I]-iodopindolol was used to characterize beta-adrenoceptor density (Bmax) and affinity constant (Kd) in female and male hamster Harderian glands. Single-point experiments were also completed in intact females, intact males, and castrated or superior cervical ganglionectomized males. Scatchard analysis described a single population of binding sites with a Bmax of 292.2 +/- 45.1 fmol/mg protein (X +/- SEM, n = 6) in females and 18.2 +/- 3.0 fmol/mg protein (n = 6, P less than .001) in males. The affinity also varied significantly (P less than .05) with a Kd of 1.08 +/- 0.18 versus 0.26 + 0.05 nM (n = 6) in the Harderian gland of females and males, respectively. Single-point [125I]-IPIN (400 pM) binding values in females were 67.3 +/- 4.0, in intact males were 12.8 +/- 3.2, and in castrated males were 31.2 +/- 4.2 fmol/mg protein (n = 7-9). Superior cervical ganglionectomy induced no significant changes in receptor binding. The results indicate pronounced sexual differences in the density and affinity of beta-adrenoceptors in the hamster Harderian gland, which may be sex hormone dependent.", 
    "70": "The effect of ovarian steroids on the concentration of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in the hypothalamus was studied in ovariectomized rats. Ovariectomized rats exhibited a lower cAMP concentration than intact rats. The administration of a single dose of estradiol benzoate (50 micrograms/kg body weight) resulted 3 days later in a rise of cAMP values, but levels did not reach those observed in estrous rats. Progesterone (2 mg/rat) injected 3 days after the priming dose of estradiol benzoate produced 4 h later no further changes in hypothalamic cAMP. The changes in hypothalamic cAMP concentration induced by estrogen treatment depend, at least in part, on noradrenergic inputs, since they were prevented by the injection of the norepinephrine synthesis inhibitor, diethyldithiocarbamate. In addition, administration of the beta-blocking agent, propranolol, to estradiol- and estradiol-progesterone-treated rats lowered the concentration of cAMP in the hypothalamus in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the administration of an alpha-blocking agent, phenoxybenzamine, had no effect at the tested concentration. The results of this study indicate that estrogen increases cAMP concentration in the hypothalamus by a noradrenergic mechanism involving beta-receptors. Moreover, the findings suggest that estrogen induces an increase in the number of beta-receptor sites, whereas progesterone increases the apparent propranolol sensitivity for these receptor sites.", 
    "71": "We have studied the effect of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism on the lactating rat mammary gland number of beta-adrenergic receptors and basal intracellular cyclic AMP levels. We also describe the effects of isoproterenol, cholera toxin and forskolin challenge on these parameters. Using cyclic AMP levels as an indication of receptor functionality our results indicate that both thyroid states are accompanied by a decrease in the response to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation.", 
    "72": "Glutamate activation of the locus coeruleus (LC) and norepinephrine (NE) have both been shown to potentiate the perforant path (PP)-evoked population spike. This potentiation may be short-lasting, the population spike returning to baseline levels within minutes after NE-application or LC activation, or can be long-lasting, persisting 20 minutes or more after termination of the NE or glutamate manipulation. In the present study LC electrical stimulation (333 Hz, 15 msec) initiated 40 msec prior to a PP stimulus reliably caused short-lasting potentiation of the dentate gyrus population spike amplitude (mean maximal = 161%, N = 22). With 50 LC-PP pairings a long-lasting potentiation (greater than 30 min after offset of LC stimulation) was seen in 10/22 experiments. Propranolol (20-30 mg/kg IP) did not block the potentiating effect of LC electrical simulation but completely suppressed the potentiating effect of glutamate activation of the LC in the same animals (N = 5). The beta receptor dependence of short-and long-lasting hippocampal NE potentiation has been previously demonstrated. The inability of a beta receptor antagonist to attenuate the potentiation induced by LC electrical stimulation suggests there are two distinct systems. Both the beta-NE-dependent and the beta-NE-independent system are capable of inducing long-lasting potentiation of the PP-evoked potential.", 
    "73": "To study the development of beta 2-adrenoceptor function during childhood we assessed beta 2-adrenoceptor density by (-)-125 iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding and responsiveness (cyclic AMP responses to 10 microM/l (-)-isoprenaline stimulation) in lymphocytes derived from 76 children aged 1 month to 18 years. The mean number of beta 2-adrenoceptors was 732 +/- 33 (231-1830) ICYP binding sites/cell: there was no difference between males and females. Calculation of the data of all children resulted in a significant positive correlation between lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density and age (p less than 0.05). This age-dependent increase in beta 2-adrenoceptor density was significantly correlated with the 10 microM/l (-)-isoprenaline-induced increase in the intracellular level of cyclic AMP (p less than 0.01), indicating that with age not only beta 2-adrenoceptor responsiveness increases. Infants below 2 years of age had a significant lower beta 2-adrenoceptor density (588 +/- 63 ICYP binding sites/cell; n = 8) when compared with the beta 2-adrenoceptor density in children older than 2 years (763 +/- 38 ICYP binding sites/cell; n = 68). This reduced beta 2-adrenoceptor density might be one of the reasons that treatment with beta-adrenoceptor sympathomimetic drugs is less effective at this age than in children of older age.", 
    "74": "A muscle slice technique was used to compare the development changes in binding of the beta-adrenergic antagonist, [3H]CGP-12177 (CGP), in right ventricles of male Canadian Hybrid Farms CHF 147 cardiomyopathic hamsters and two strains of control healthy animals, golden Syrian (GH) and CHF 148 albino noncardiomyopathic (AH) hamsters. CGP binding to myocardial slices was saturable, reversible, stereospecific, proportional to slice number and of high affinity. Bmax in GH and AH myocardium was not altered with age although there was a tendency to decrease between 16 and 30 days of age in both strains. In the cardiomyopathic ventricles, receptor number decreased between 30 (7.07 +/- 0.74 fmol/mg wet weight) and 60 days of age (4.58 +/- 0.52) (P less than 0.05) and remained at the lower level thereafter. Bmax in cardiomyopathics was slightly higher than that of either GH (5.01 +/- 0.88) or AH (5.05 +/- 0.82) at 30 days of age (P less than 0.05) but was not different at the other ages tested. Kd was decreased in GH at 30 days of age but was unaltered during postnatal development in either the AH or cardiomyopathic hearts. The elevated level of cell surface beta-adrenergic receptors in the cardiomyopathic ventricle at a time when necrotic lesions are developing may be important with respect to the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in these animals.", 
    "75": "1. It has been suggested that beta 2-adrenoreceptors in skeletal muscle regulate plasma potassium. The possibility that alterations in the function and/or density of these receptors occurs in perinephritis hypertension in rabbits was studied. 2. Intravenous infusion of adrenaline (0.2 micrograms kg-1 min-1) caused a fall in potassium while intravenous bolus injection of propranolol (0.75 mg kg-1) resulted in an increase in serum potassium which was of similar magnitude in both perinephritis hypertensive and sham-operated normotensive rabbits. 3. Binding studies with the radioligand [125I] cyanopindolol (ICYP) showed that there were no significant differences between the hypertensive and normotensive rabbits in the density (Bmax) or affinity (KD) of the skeletal muscle beta 2-adrenoreceptor. 4. The results suggest that function and density of skeletal muscle beta 2-adrenoreceptors are not altered in rabbits with perinephritis hypertension.", 
    "76": "The effects of long-term endogenous catecholamine exposure on the regulation of leukocyte and adipocyte beta adrenoceptor subtypes were studied through an experimental model of chronic neurogenic hypertension in the dog. Chronic sinoaortic denervation (SAD) is associated with a significant increase in plasma catecholamine levels, a reduction in the total beta adrenoceptor number of the leukocytes (52%) as well as of the omental adipocytes (59%). Using highly selective beta antagonists (bisoprolol for beta-1; ICI 118,551 for beta-2 adrenoceptors) we demonstrate that the normal dog fat cell possess both beta-2 and beta-1 adrenoceptors in proportions of 67 and 33%, respectively. SAD-induced catecholamine enhancement promotes a strong reduction of beta-2 (but not beta-1) adrenoceptor number (from 237 +/- 28 to 52 +/- 13 fmol/mg of protein) leading to a new relative distribution in fat cell membranes: 36% for beta-2 and 64% for beta-1 adrenoceptors. Such a different regulation provokes major consequences in the associated-biological effect on adipocytes when evaluating the lipolytic process. Lipolysis induced by epinephrine or isoproterenol (two mixed agonists) is weakly but significantly reduced whereas lipolysis induced by procaterol (a highly selective beta-2 agonist) is strongly reduced. These data fit with the results of the binding studies and demonstrate the loss in beta-2 adrenoceptor number and efficiency in SAD dogs. The present study demonstrates a differential regulation of beta adrenoceptors: beta-2 but not beta-1 adrenoceptors are decreased by long-term exposure to high plasma levels of endogenous catecholamines in the dog.", 
    "77": "Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), 750 mg/kg, was administered to rats to determine its effect on propranolol binding and beta blockade. Anesthetized rats received [3H]propranolol i.v., followed in 15 min by human AAG or bovine serum albumin, 750 mg/kg. AAG treatment produced a human AAG concentration in serum of 7.76 +/- 1.17 mg/ml, several times higher than the endogenous serum AAG concentration in stressed rats. AAG treatment significantly increased the heart rate response to isoproterenol, compared to albumin (95.4 +/- 19.6 vs 28.3 +/- 16.7% of baseline value, measured 45 min after propranolol, P less than 0.001). AAG-treated rats had greater [3H]propranolol binding in serum (93.0 +/- 3.2 vs 76.7 +/- 3.0%, P less than 0.01) and a lower calculated unbound [3H]propranolol concentration in serum (2.7 +/- 1.3 vs 7.4 +/- 3.1 X 10(6) dpm/ml, P less than 0.001) than albumin-treated rats. These data demonstrate that AAG can alter propranolol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics even when administered after the propranolol effect is evident. Because the reported affinity of propranolol for cardiac beta receptors is 10,000 times greater than its affinity for AAG, these data suggest that AAG acted by altering propranolol disposition rather than by directly competing with beta receptors for drug.", 
    "78": "Erythrocytes of rainbow trout respond to adrenergic stimulation by activation of a Na+-H+ exchange. When red blood cells are suspended in their own plasma and equilibrated with a convenient gas mixture in a tonometer, the extrusion of H+ induces a fast, very strong acidification of the blood (by 0.5-0.7 pH units), explained as follows. Excretion of H+ into a medium containing HCO3- causes the formation of H2CO3. The uncatalyzed dehydration of H2CO3 is slow so that H+ accumulates above the level that would prevail at equilibrium, promoting a strong acid disequilibrium pH. Then the blood pH progressively returns to a value close to its initial value because of the slow uncatalyzed dehydration of H2CO3 and washout of the CO2 so produced. The period of acid disequilibrium pH, however, is lengthened because part of the CO2 generated by the spontaneous dehydration is not washed out by tonometry but diffuses into the red cells where it is rapidly converted into HCO3- and H+ by carbonic anhydrase and then excreted by Na+-H+ and Cl-HCO3- exchangers. This recycling process \"refuels\" the ionic reaction, increasing the time needed to reach equilibrium. The anion exchanger does not sense this strong acid disequilibrium pH, since the external HCO3- concentration is practically unchanged at that time. During the extracellular pH (pHe) recovery period, simultaneously extracellular HCO3- content decreases and intracellular Cl- content increases. Thus intracellular pH and pHe appear to be uncoupled. This overall interpretation is confirmed by experiments using carbonic anhydrase and drugs such as propranolol and amiloride.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "Serotonin (5-HT) binds with nearly identical affinity at the various central 5-HT binding sites. Few agents bind with selectivity for 5-HT1A sites. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol binds stereoselectively both at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B sites (with a several-fold selectivity for the latter) and, whereas it is a 5-HT1A antagonist, it appears to be a 5-HT1B agonist. As such, it could serve as a lead compound for the development of new 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B agents. The purpose of the present study was to modify the structure of propranolol in such a manner so as to reduce its affinity for 5-HT1B and beta-adrenergic sites while, at the same time, retaining its affinity for 5-HT1A sites. Removal of the side-chain hydroxyl group of propranolol, and conversion of its secondary amine to a tertiary amine, reduced affinity for 5-HT1B and beta-adrenergic sites. In addition, shortening the side chain by one carbon atom resulted in compounds with affinity for hippocampal 5-HT1A sites comparable to that of racemic propranolol, but with a 30- to 500-fold lower affinity for 5-HT1B sites and a greater than 1000-fold lower affinity for beta-adrenergic sites. The results of these preliminary studies attest to the utility of this approach for the development of novel serotonergic agents.", 
    "80": "To determine the effect of a topically applied antiviral agent on shedding of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) into the tear film and corneal epithelial lesions, ten rabbits latently infected with HSV-1 were subjected to transcorneal iontophoresis of 0.01% timolol once a day for 3 consecutive days to induce viral shedding and lesions. Iontophoretic induction was performed similarly in five uninfected rabbits as controls. Half of the infected rabbits and all of the uninfected controls received topical 1.0% trifluridine five time a day for 9 days, beginning the day after the first iontophoresis. All eyes were examined daily for 10 days by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and tear film samples collected on swabs were analyzed for virus. In the infected rabbits, the eyes treated with trifluridine had significantly fewer swabs positive for HSV-1 than the untreated eyes (P less than 0.001); however, there was no significant difference in the numbers of lesions in the treated and untreated eyes. The uninfected controls had no positive swabs and developed no lesions. These results suggest that topical treatment with trifluridine may reduce recovery of HSV-1 from the tear film, but does not affect the incidence of iontophoretically induced corneal epithelial lesions.", 
    "81": "Short-term therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for hypertension is effective and well tolerated, and compared with beta blockers, may cause fewer adverse reactions. Furthermore, enalapril has been observed to have a greater effect on systolic blood pressure than beta blockers. We therefore decided to compare the ACE inhibitor enalapril and the beta blocker atenolol as monotherapy in a double-blind study of patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "82": "After a four-week placebo run-in period, 162 patients were allocated randomly to receive atenolol (50 to 100 mg daily) or enalapril (20 to 40 mg daily) for 12 weeks. To assess the influence of these drugs on quality of life, a series of psychologic tests was performed, and a subset of patients also underwent treadmill exercise and pulmonary function tests.", 
    "83": "In 147 patients who completed the study, enalapril reduced supine blood pressure by 19/12 mm Hg, compared with 9/7 mm Hg for atenolol (p less than 0.001/p less than 0.005). The modest blood pressure response to atenolol was not due to poor compliance. A target blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or less was achieved by 35 percent of enalapril-treated atenolol (p less than 0.01). The frequency and severity of adverse effects with the two drugs were similar, and few important differences emerged from the quality-of-life assessments.", 
    "84": "At the doses used, enalapril induced a greater short-term blood pressure response than atenolol; long-term studies of its safety and efficacy are required.", 
    "85": "In the present study, we characterized the distribution and the pharmacological properties of the different components of the GABAA receptor complex in the brain of the eel (Anguilla anguilla). Benzodiazepine recognition sites labeled \"in vitro\" with [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNT) were present in highest concentration in the optic lobe and in lowest concentration in the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. A similar distribution was observed in the density of gamma-[3H]aminobutyric acid ([3H]GABA) binding sites. GABA increased the binding of [3H]FNT in a concentration-dependent manner, with a maximal enhancement of 45% above the control value, and, vice versa, diazepam stimulated the binding of [3H]GABA to eel brain membrane preparations. The density of benzodiazepine and GABA recognition sites and their reciprocal regulation were similar to those observed in the rat brain. In contrast, the binding of the specific ligand for the Cl- ionophore, t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS), to eel brain membranes was lower than that found in the rat brain. In addition, [35S]TBPS binding in eel brain was less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of GABA and muscimol and much more sensitive to the stimulatory effect of bicuculline, when compared with [35S]TBPS binding in the rat brain. Moreover, the uptake of 36Cl- into eel brain membrane vesicles was only marginally stimulated by concentrations of GABA or muscimol that significantly enhanced the 36Cl- uptake into rat brain membrane vesicles. Finally, intravenous administration of the beta-carboline inverse agonist 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester (20 mg/kg) and of the chloride channel blocker pentylenetetrazole (80 mg/kg) produced convulsions in eels that were antagonized by diazepam at doses five to 20 times higher than those required to produce similar effects in rats. The results may indicate a different functional activity of the GABA-coupled chloride ionophore in the fish brain as compared with the mammalian brain.", 
    "86": "The present studies were undertaken to explore further the mechanism by which T3 increases adenylate cyclase activity and the uptake of the sugar analog 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in freshly isolated rat thymocytes. In studies of cells preloaded with the fluorescent probe quin-2, whose fluorescence intensity increases linearly with increases in cytoplasmic free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i), we have now demonstrated that T3 increases [Ca2+]i in thymocytes suspended in buffer containing 1 mM Ca2+. This effect was extremely prompt, becoming evident much less than 1 min after the addition of T3 and reaching maximal values in about 5-8 min. The subsequent time course of the T3 effect was obscured by an increase in fluorescence intensity in control thymocytes not exposed to T3, beginning after about 8 min of incubation. However, the T3 effect, after reaching its peak, appeared to remain stable for about 5 min and then to decline, abating completely in 18-30 min. No effect of T3 on [Ca2+]i was observed when thymocytes were suspended in Ca2+-free medium. The effect of T3 on [Ca2+]i was concentration dependent, and as with its actions on thymocyte adenylate cyclase activity, cAMP concentration and 2-DG uptake, the lowest effective concentration of T3 was 1 nM. Among several thyronine analogs studied, L-T3 was the most potent, followed in decreasing order of potency by L-T4, D-T3, 3,5-diiodo-3'-isopropyl-L-thyronine, and D-T4. rT3, 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine, and D,L-thyronine were without effect. l-Alprenolol alone (10 microM) produced a modest increase in thymocyte [Ca2+]i, but, as it does with the effect of T3 on cellular cAMP concentration and 2-DG uptake, it markedly inhibited or abolished the stimulatory effect of T3 on [Ca2+]i. From these observations we conclude that T3 initiates the increase in thymocyte [Ca2+]i by enhancing the influx of extracellular calcium, though the possibility that it also releases calcium from an intracellular calcium pool cannot be excluded. Since the effects of T3 on thymocyte adenylate cyclase activity, cAMP concentration, and 2-DG uptake occur subsequent to these effects on calcium metabolism and require the presence of Ca2+ in the extracellular fluid, we suggest that an increase in [Ca2+]i, due at least partly to an influx of extracellular calcium, is the initiating event in these plasma membrane-mediated responses of the rat thymocyte to T3.", 
    "87": "The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol is used in the therapy of hypertension and ischemic heart disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of this drug on platelet aggregation and on synthesis of thromboxane B2 (the stable metabolite of Thromboxane A2) from platelet rich plasma (PRP), whole blood samples and during spontaneous clotting. The results indicate that propranolol at concentrations near the therapeutic range, significantly inhibit collagen and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and TxB2 synthesis from PRP. Furthermore the drug demonstrates inhibitory activity on B-TG release and TxB2 production from whole blood samples and on spontaneous clotting. The results suggest that some benefits of propranolol in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease or cardiovascular conditions associated with platelet hyperaggregability may also be related to interference with platelet activation \"in vivo\" and with TxA2 generation."
