    "0": "Acute bleeding from esophageal varices is a medical emergency. It requires a structured therapeutic strategy which is adapted to the local resources. The primary goal is to stop bleeding, preferably by endoscopic sclerotherapy or ligation. In situations where endoscopic intervention is not possible as a first-line treatment, therapy with balloon tamponade or vasoactive drugs (terlipressin or octreotide) are options to be followed as soon as possible by sclerotherapy or ligation. After successful hemostasis, the next goal is to prevent rebleeding. This is achieved primarily by eradicating sclerotherapy or ligation. In special situations, long-term therapy with a non-cardio-selective beta receptor blocker is an alternative. The combined approach of sclerotherapy or ligation plus beta receptor blocker has no significant advantage. Primary prophylaxis of bleeding from esophageal varices by long-term beta receptor blocker therapy is advised in patients with medium-sized or large varices. Apart from strategies aimed at the therapy or prophylaxis of bleeding from esophageal varices, measures to prevent and treat chronic liver diseases should be implemented in order to reduce the development of liver cirrhosis as the leading cause of esophageal varices.", 
    "1": "1. The effects of distension of the urinary bladder on heart rate, maximum rate of change of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt max) and hindlimb vascular resistance together with their modulation at different carotid sinus pressures were studied in dogs anaesthetized with a mixture of chloralose and urethane and artificially ventilated. 2. When the carotid sinus mean perfusion pressure was raised in randomly selected steps from 60 to 210 mmHg, it caused a progressive bradycardia, and a reduction in left ventricular dP/dt max and in arterial blood pressure, together with vasodilatation in the perfused hindlimb. Distension of the bladder at each level of carotid sinus pressure resulted in tachycardia, a small but significant increase in left ventricular dP/dt max (160 +/- 30 mmHg s-1) and hindlimb vasoconstriction. 3. When heart rate and arterial blood pressure were held constant to exclude these secondary effects on left ventricular dP/dt max, raising the carotid sinus pressure caused a progressive reduction in left ventricular dP/dt max and hindlimb vasodilatation. Superimposition of tests of bladder distension at each level of sinus pressure resulted in variable responses, but overall there was a significant increase in left ventricular dP/dt max of 190 +/- 54 mmHg s-1. Hindlimb vasocontriction, however, was a consistent finding. 4. The gain of the relationship between the carotid sinus perfusion pressure and left ventricular dP/dt max was unaffected by distension of the bladder. 5. It is concluded that, when changes secondary to increases in heart rate and blood pressure are prevented, distension of the bladder causes a small but significant reflex increase in left ventricular dP/dt max. The responses, however, are variable and the possible reasons for this are discussed.", 
    "2": "Sample pretreatment using solid-phase extraction (SPE) on cartridges filled with small-particle Styrosorb porous polystyrene-based sorbent has been used in the analysis of propranolol enantiomers in human serum by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescent detection. SPE on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges was used as a reference pretreatment method. The propranolol content of the samples was determined by achiral normal-phase HPLC and the enantiomeric ratio of propranolol (S/R) was then determined by chiral HPLC on a column with silica-bonded cellulose-tris(3,5-dimethylphenyl carbamate). Recoveries of propranolol from serum using SPE on Styrosorb and C18 phases were 97 +/- 5% and 96 +/- 5%, respectively. Detection and quantification limits for propranolol enantiomers were 4 and 7 ng/ml, respectively.", 
    "3": "A stereospecific capillary electrophoresis assay for oxprenolol enantiomers and their basic metabolites in human urine has been developed using hydroxypropyl-beta-CD as a chiral selector in the mobile phase. The bioassay method has been validated and the detection limit from spiked urine samples is 0.2 micrograms/ml. The calibration curves are linear from 0.4 to 16 micrograms/ml. Extraction recovery ranged from 84.7 to 96.4% for all the compounds studied. The influence of various parameters on the chiral separation of oxprenolol and its basic metabolites have been investigated. Urinary excretion profiles of oxprenolol enantiomers and those of two metabolites have also been studied, following a single oral dose of racemic oxprenolol.", 
    "4": "While evidence has been presented for the receptor-mediated activation of phospholipases A2, C and D, the activation of phospholipase A1 subsequent to receptor activation has not been established. Phospholipase A1-catalysed hydrolysis of 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE) by guinea-pig heart microsomes was stimulated 40-60% by isoprenaline. This isoprenaline-mediated increase in activity was blocked by propranolol and butoxamine, a specific beta 2-adrenergic antagonist, but not by atenolol, a specific beta 1-adrenergic antagonist. Neither clonidine nor phenylephrine, alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic agonists respectively, had a stimulatory effect on the hydrolysis of the PE substrate. Guanosine 5'(-)[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]) and guanosine 5'(-)[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate, but not guanosine 5'(-)[beta-thio]diphosphate (GDP[S]) or adenosine 5'(-)[gamma-thio]triphosphate, stimulated the hydrolysis of 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPE by phospholipase A1. GDP[S] inhibited the isoprenaline-mediated stimulation of phospholipase A1 activity. Phospholipase A1 hydrolysis of 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPE was not dependent on cations; however, the stimulatory effects of isoprenaline and GTP[S] on the hydrolytic activity were abolished by cation chelators. The above data suggest that phospholipase A1 activity in guinea-pig heart microsomes is activated by the binding of isoprenaline to beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore the stimulation of phospholipase A1 activity by the agonist may be mediated via activation of G-proteins.", 
    "5": "This study was undertaken to determine whether receptor and non-receptor components of the adenylate cyclase (AC) cascade were altered in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of 14-day-old pre-obese (fa/fa) rats, before endocrine status is strongly modified by fa gene expression. Activity of the AC catalytic subunit did not differ between the two genotypes. In fa/fa rats compared with control Fa/fa rats, there was a 50% decrease in the activity of alpha Gs (stimulated by NaF or guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate) but no change in protein content (Western blotting). alpha Gi function, assessed by the inhibitory action of low concentrations of guanosine 5'-[beta gamma-imido]triphosphate upon 10(-4) M forskolin-stimulated AC activity, was equally low in both genotypes. Analysis of dose-response curves for different beta-agonists revealed that (i) both the basal and the maximally stimulated activity of AC were 2-fold lower in fa/fa rats than in Fa/fa rats; (ii) BRL37344 and CGP12177 (beta 3 agonists) were less potent in fa/fa than in Fa/fa rats (Kact. multiplied by 2); (iii) noradrenaline and isoprenaline (Iso), at the low-affinity site (beta 3-AR), were less potent in fa/fa than in Fa/fa pups (Kact. increased by 30 and 20% respectively). At the high-affinity site (mainly beta 1) these two agonists were more potent in fa/fa than in Fa/fa rats (Kact. decreased by 40 and 80% respectively). In good agreement with the latter result, the beta 1-adrenergic receptor (beta 1-AR)-selective antagonist CGP20712A had more effect on the Iso-stimulated AC activity in pre-obese than in lean pups (2-fold decreased in IC50). Binding experiments with [3H]CGP12177 show that in BAT of suckling rats, beta 3-ARs represent 80% of the total beta-ARs. Bmax values for the two sites were not affected by the genotype, although the beta 3-AR mRNA concentration in BAT (quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR) was 3-fold lower in fa/fa rats than in Fa/fa pups. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for alterations in beta 1- and beta 3-AR signalling in BAT of 14-day-old suckling pre-obese Zucker rats with a decreased activity of alpha Gs. The impaired AC responsiveness to catecholamines might be a primary contributor to the development of this genetic obesity.", 
    "6": "Physical exercise and mental work cause alterations in cardiac autonomic control. beta-Blockers protect the heart against stress, and this effect may be in part centrally mediated. In this context, the lipophilicity of the drug would be clinically relevant.", 
    "7": "Thirty postinfarct patients were randomized to receive 100 mg atenolol or 200 mg metoprolol CR in a double-blind, crossover manner, each for a 6-week period. Heart rate (HR) variability was used to study autonomic effects during mental and physical stress and to study circadian variations. Mean 24-hour HR decreased from 77 +/- 7 to 60 +/- 6 beats per minute after atenolol and to 62 +/- 6 beats per minute after metoprolol (P = .046). At baseline, mental performance tasks did not affect HR, but decreased HR variability (SDNN index from 51 +/- 26 to 30 +/- 13 milliseconds [ms], P < .001; high-frequency power from 130 +/- 143 to 110 +/- 125 ms2, P = .046; and low-frequency power from 538 +/- 447 to 290 +/- 275 ms2, P < .001). Both beta-blockers decreased HR during mental performance tasks (P < .001) and increased SDNN index and high-frequency power. Before treatment, bicycle exercise decreased HR variability; root-mean-square of successive difference decreased from 21 +/- 8 to 15 +/- 10 ms (P = .004). beta-Blockade could not prevent this decrease. No differences between atenolol and metoprolol were observed for absolute high- and low-frequency power or after adjustment for HR. Vagal blockade with methylatropine during chronic beta-blocker treatment nearly abolished all components of spectral power. HR was found to be the parameter most strongly affected by beta-blockade but not by an influence on vagal tone. No differences were found between atenolol and metoprolol.", 
    "8": "In stable postinfarct patients, chronic treatment with metoprolol and atenolol attenuates the reduction in HR variability induced by mental performance tasks, but the effects during exercise are limited. beta-Blockers do not appear to increase vagal tone in this stable patient group. The point of action in these patients is mainly a reduction in HR, probably due to a reduction in stress-induced sympathetic activation. Clinically significant differences between atenolol and metoprolol were absent, indicating that the degree of lipophilicity does not distinguish among the beta-blockers what their salutary effects are on HR variability during the specific challenges used.", 
    "9": "Electrophysiological properties of guinea pig ambiguus (AMB) neurons were studied in a brainstem slice preparation. During subthreshold depolarization AMB neurons displayed an early slow depolarization and a late outward rectification both of which were blocked by replacing Ca2+ with Co2+ in the extracellular solution. AMB neurons showed hyperpolarizing inward rectification which was blocked by extracellular Cs+ and is likely caused by the activation of Ih: In 58% (n = 49) of AMB neurons spike firing was restricted to the early phase of a long-lasting depolarizing current injection (phasic firing). The remaining AMB neurons showed repetitive firing throughout the depolarization (tonic firing). A Ca(2+)-mediated K+ current (IK(Ca)) caused an afterhyperpolarization that followed both single and repetitive spike firing. IK(Ca) also controlled the firing pattern in both types of firing, especially in the phasic firing. Norepinephrine (NE) blocked both the hyperpolarizing inward rectification and the Ca(2+)-dependent AHP. These effects of NE were antagonized by propranolol. It is proposed that the blockade of IK(Ca) and Ih contribute to the improvement of the 'signal-to-noise ratio' by NE in AMB neurons.", 
    "10": "The effects of U50488, kappa-opioid agonist on P-type Ca2+ channels, were studied. U50488 inhibited depolarization-induced Ca2+ uptake into rat brain synaptosomes, which was sensitive to omega-Agatoxin IVA (omega-AgaIVA; P-type Ca2+ channel blocker) and inhibited P-type Ca2+ channel currents recorded from rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons by the whole-cell patch clamp method. Dynorphin A also inhibited P-type Ca2+ channel currents. The inhibition by U50488 was biphasic; high affinity component (21%, IC50 = 8.9 x 10(-8) M) and low affinity component (79%, IC50 = 1.1 x 10(-5) M). At low concentrations of U50488 (10(-6) M), P-type Ca2+ channel current inhibition was attenuated by norbinartorphimine (nor-BNI), kappa-opioid antagonist, and by dialysis of cells with a pipette solution containing guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP-beta S). At high concentrations of U50488 (10(-5) M), P-type Ca2+ channel current inhibition was frequency-dependent. Thus U50488-induced current inhibition is mediated by two mechanisms. Its high affinity component is produced by activation of kappa-opioid receptors, whereas the low affinity component is due to its direct action on the P-type Ca2+ channel.", 
    "11": "The present study demonstrated cardiorespiratory effects of a synthetic phosphorus-containing ichthyotoxic metabolite elaborated by the marine dinoflagellate Ptychodiscus brevis in anaesthetised cats. The metabolite at a dose of 0.25-1.5 mg/kg i.v., resulted in a dose-dependent fall in blood pressure and such vasodepressor effect was associated with bradycardia. There is initial respiratory apnoea followed by increased rate and depth of respiration (hyperapnoea) following the administration of the toxin. The hypotensive response was accompanied by a decrease in aortic baroreceptor activity. The ECG showed atrioventricular conduction block, arrhythmia and depression of S-T segment and T wave which indicated coronary insufficiency. Vasodepressive property of the toxin is presumably muscarinic in nature as atropine counteracted the vasodepression.", 
    "12": "Somatostatin is known to be a potent inhibitor of pancreatic exocrine secretion, but the mechanism of its effect is not fully understood. The mechanism of the inhibition by centrally administered somatostatin was examined in conscious rats. Rats were prepared with cannulae draining bile and pancreatic juice separately, and with a duodenal cannula, an extrajugular vein cannula and a cerebroventricular cannula. Somatostatin was injected into the left lateral ventricle, and the inhibitory mechanism was examined using vagotomized rats and various drugs that affect sympathetic neurons. Intracerebroventricular administration of somatostatin significantly inhibited pancreatic exocrine secretion stimulated by bile-pancreatic juice diversion. The inhibitory effect was not abolished by vagotomy, pretreatment with propranolol, but was abolished by pretreatment with hexamethonium or phentolamine. The plasma level of somatostatin after its intracerebroventricular administration increased 3-fold, but its intravenous infusion at a rate giving a similar plasma somatostatin level to that produced by its intracerebroventricular injection, had no significant effect on pancreatic secretion. These results suggest that somatostatin inhibits pancreatic exocrine secretion centrally via sympathetic efferent nerves and that alpha-adrenergic receptors have an important role in its inhibitory action.", 
    "13": "Spontaneous neuronal activity in the solitary tract nucleus was recorded extracellularly in a brain slice preparation during bath-application of 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor-selective agonists and antagonists. The 5-HT1A/5-HT1B agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine depressed activity in 20 of 25 neurons studied. The remaining five neurons were unaffected. The 5-HT1A/5-HT1B antagonist pindolol prevented the 5-carboxamidotryptamine-induced changes, whereas the 5-HT1A antagonist spiroxatrine and the 5-HT2 antagonists ketanserin and mianserin were ineffective. Application of the 5-HT1/5-HT2 agonist alpha-methylserotonin depressed activity in 16 of 19 neurons, whereas the remaining three neurons were unresponsive. Pindolol blocked alpha-methylserotonin-induced changes of activity, but spiroxatrine, ketanserin and mianserin were ineffective. Finally, the 5-HT2 agonist DOI was applied to seven neurons. Six were unresponsive to DOI, and one responded with a depression of activity. These data provide electrophysiological evidence for the presence of 5-HT1 receptors in the nTS, presumably of the 5-HT1B subclass, but cast further doubt on the contribution of 5-HT2 and 5-HT1A receptors to the actions of serotonin in the nucleus.", 
    "14": "Small electrolyte additions to a nonionic contrast medium reduce the risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF) during wedged catheter injection of a contrast medium. The current study was designed to further investigate contrast-medium-induced VF by studying the effect of pretreatment with different antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "15": "During a simulated wedged catheter situation, iohexol was injected into the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery in five open-chest, anesthetized dogs pretreated with lidocaine, propranolol, amiodarone, almokalant, or verapamil.", 
    "16": "Wedging the catheter for 60 sec did not induce VF. However, all 15 wedged catheter injections with iohexol induced VF within 28 sec (19 +/- 1 [mean +/- standard error of the mean]) despite pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs. Prior to VF, conduction was slowed and monophasic action potential duration lengthened in the contrast-medium-perfused myocardium, although no significant changes occurred in the control area.", 
    "17": "The combination of catheter wedging and long-lasting contrast medium injection has a high risk of causing VF. Although adding a small amount of electrolytes to nonionic contrast media can reduce the risk of VF, antiarrhythmic drug therapy may not have a protective effect.", 
    "18": "We have previously described the isolation of a complementary DNA (cDNA) from the freshwater mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis encoding a polypeptide that exhibits approximately 50% identity to the beta-subunits of vertebrate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A (GABAA) receptor. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes from in vitro-transcribed RNA, the snail subunit forms functional homo-oligomeric receptors possessing chloride-selective ion channels. In recordings from voltage-clamped oocytes held at -60 mV, GABA induced an inward current, whereas application of the chloride-channel blocker picrotoxin (in the absence of agonist) elicited an apparent outward current. Single channel recordings obtained from cell-attached patches have revealed a single population of approximately 20 pS channels, with an open probability greater than 90% (at a pipette potential of -100 mV) in the absence of GABA. The relationship between single channel current and pipette potential was linear over the studied range (-100 mV to +60 mV), but the open probability was less for hyperpolarizations than for depolarizations. The spontaneous channel openings were blocked by micromolar concentrations of picrotoxin. Functional hetero-oligomeric receptors were formed when the molluscan subunit was co-expressed in oocytes with the bovine GABAA receptor alpha 1-subunit, but the channels gated by these receptors did not open spontaneously.", 
    "19": "To compare the effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) and side effects of 0.005% latanoprost applied once daily, morning or evening, with 0.5% timolol applied twice daily.", 
    "20": "A 6-month randomized, double-masked, multicenter study with three parallel groups was undertaken. Two hundred sixty-seven patients were randomized, 84 to timolol, 89 to latanoprost in the morning for 3 months and then in the evening for another 3 months, and 94 to latanoprost with the treatment schedule reversed.", 
    "21": "After 6 months, timolol reduced diurnal IOP from 24.6 to 17.9 mmHg (27%); latanoprost applied in the morning, from 25.5 to 17.7 mmHg (31%); and latanoprost applied in the evening, from 24.8 to 16.2 mmHg (35%). The efficacy of latanoprost applied in the evening was statistically superior to latanoprost applied in the morning and to timolol (P < 0.001). Latanoprost induced a slight increase in conjunctival hyperemia in 31.4% of treated patients, compared with 15.9% for timolol. Sporadic episodes of mild punctate corneal epithelial erosions were three times as frequent in latanoprost-treated eyes as in timolol-treated eyes. The most significant ocular side effect was increased pigmentation of the iris observed in five and suspected in seven more latanoprost-treated eyes. All these eyes had a mixed green-brown or blue/gray-brown iris color. Timolol reduced heart rate by 3 beats/minute (P < 0.005).", 
    "22": "The effect on diurnal IOP of latanoprost applied once daily in the evening is superior to that of timolol. The main difference in side effects is increased pigmentation of the iris induced by latanoprost, most likely due to stimulation of melanogenesis in iris stromal melanocytes.", 
    "23": "Inotropic effects of histamine were examined in isolated ventricular preparations from late embryonic and hatched chick hearts. In 19 day-old embryonic preparations, histamine had little effect on the contractile force. In preparations from 1 to 2 day-old hatched chick, histamine produced a transient decrease in contractile force followed by a sustained increase. The negative and positive responses were antagonized by atropine and propranolol, respectively, but not by histamine antagonists terfenadine, cimetidine or thioperamide. Acetylcholine produced positive inotropic responses in the embryo while negative responses were observed after hatching. In myocardium of hatched chicks, compound 48/80, which releases histamine from mast cells, produced a transient decrease in contractile force followed by a sustained increase with a similar magnitude and time course to the case of exogenously applied histamine. The negative and positive responses were inhibited by atropine and propranolol, respectively, but not by terfenadine, cimetidine or thioperamide, which was similar to the case with the responses to histamine. The present results suggest that histamine, either applied exogenously or released from myocardial store sites, produces negative and positive inotropic responses in hatched chick myocardium which are due to release of acetylcholine and norepinephrine, respectively, from autonomic nerve terminals.", 
    "24": "The beta 2-adrenergic agonist, clenbuterol, was administered to lactating rats (4 mg/kg diet) from post-partum day 1 to day 19, or directly injected into neonate rats (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg body weight) from post-partum day 3 until day 15. Changes in body weight and the skeletal muscles soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) were studied in both dams and suckling offspring. Drug treatment consistently increased body weight in dams whilst significantly reducing the growth of their suckling pups. In dams treated with clenbuterol (4 mg/kg of diet) muscle weights and protein contents were significantly increased. Total protein content increased by 16% in SOL and 47% in EDL after 19 days of treatment. In contrast, in their suckling pups, there was a 22% and 26% reduction in protein content of SOL and EDL respectively. Administration of the beta 2-antagonist ICI118551 to these pups failed to prevent these reductions in body and muscle weights. Hence, if clenbuterol did reach the pups via the milk from treated mothers it did not act via conventional beta 2-receptors. Injection of pups with clenbuterol (1.0 mg/kg every 12 h) from litters suckling from untreated dams also resulted in significant reductions in muscle weights and protein contents. Protein content was reduced by 10% in SOL and 13% in EDL after 12 days of treatment. No alteration in fibre type proportion in SOL or EDL resulted from this treatment. Further work is required to determine whether the growth suppression in the two situations occurs via the same mechanism.", 
    "25": "The effect of atenolol and reserpine on incidence of strokes, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality was assessed in 4736 persons aged 60 years and older with isolated systolic hypertension. Participants were randomized to either chlorthalidone (2371), with step-up to atenolol, or reserpine if needed, or placebo (2365). The average baseline SBP/DBP was 170/77 mm Hg. In the active treatment group, step 1, dose 1 was chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/day; dose 2 was 25 mg/day. For step 2, dose 1 was atenolol 25 mg/day (or reserpine 0.05 mg/day if atenolol was contraindicated); dose 2 was 50 mg/day (reserpine, 0.10 mg/day). During 4.5 years average follow-up, 32% (757) of the active treatment group were on atenolol, with an average exposure of two years and 8% (193) were on reserpine with an average exposure of 1.7 years. Overall there were 96 strokes, 140 CHD events and 289 CVD events among the 2365 active group participants. Using time-dependent lifetable regression with adjustment for several variables, the addition of either atenolol or reserpine to chlorthalidone did not substantially alter the risk ratios for chlorthalidone alone. The relative risk for CHD events for atenolol versus no atenolol was 1.04 (95% confidence interval: 0.58, 1.86) and for reserpine versus no reserpine was 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.29, 2.96). The relative risk for atenolol were 0.84 (95% confidence interval: 0.54, 1.30) for death, 1.34 (95% confidence interval: 0.80, 2.28) for stroke, and 1.07 (95% confidence interval: 0.71, 1.61) for CVD. For reserpine, the corresponding relative risks and confidence intervals were 0.65 (0.26, 1.59) for death, 0.27 (0.04, 2.26) for stroke, and 0.55 (0.20, 1.49) for CVD. Thus, the beneficial effects in several outcomes in Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) were due to the treatment regimen of lowering blood pressure based on low-dose chlorthalidone (plus atenolol or reserpine as required to meet blood pressure criteria). Additional (independent) benefits attributable to atenolol or to reserpine were not identified. However, a greater number of patients might have been necessary to adequately evaluate potential differential effects of these drugs, especially for reserpine.", 
    "26": "26 patients with hypertension while on hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for end-stage renal diseases were treated first with enalapril and then changed to metoprolol. Both drugs were shown to be similarly effective in controlling blood pressure. There was no difference between the two drugs in their effects on renal function, potassium balance, lipid profile, cardiac function, exercise tolerance, and quality of life. Mild worsening of anemia was observed during treatment with enalapril. No serious side effects were reported. Use of enalapril is safe in the treatment of hypertension in dialysis patients.", 
    "27": "We investigated the effects of dietary red pepper on the energy metabolism in male subjects. In the first experiment, after having a standardized dinner on the previous evening, the subjects consumed a breakfast (650 kcal) either with or without 10 g of red pepper. For 150 min after the meal, they took a rest and their expired gas was collected. During the initial 30 min after the meal, the energy expenditure tended to be higher in the red-pepper diet period than in the control diet period. For the remaining 120 min, no difference in the energy expenditure was found between the red-pepper diet period and the control diet period. However the carbohydrate oxidation was significantly higher in the red-pepper diet period than in the control diet period while the lipid oxidation was lower in the red-pepper diet period than in the control diet period for 150 min after the meal. In the second experiment, the subjects consumed a breakfast with 10 g of red pepper after an oral administration of propranolol or a placebo. The propranolol abolished the increase in energy expenditure during the initial 30 min due to the meal containing red pepper. For the remaining 120 min, no difference in energy expenditure was found between the propranolol period and the placebo period. These results suggest than an increase in the energy expenditure after the meal containing red pepper appeared only immediately after the meal ingestion and a red-pepper diet increases the carbohydrate oxidation without increasing total energy expenditure for 150 min after the meal. And an increase in the energy expenditure immediately after the meal containing red pepper is considered to be caused by beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "28": "The acute administration of drugs that block norepinephrine (NE) reuptake suppresses rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in cats and other mammals. The mechanism is presumed to involve NE acting on cells in a pontine REM sleep-generator region. Postsynaptic noradrenergic receptor mechanisms have not been identified. In the present experiments, we tested the ability of the alpha-1 antagonist prazosin and the beta antagonist propranolol to reverse the REM sleep suppression produced by the NE reuptake blocker desipramine (DMI) in the cat. DMI reduced the number of REM sleep episodes, the REM percentage (REM sleep time/total sleep time), and the average REM sleep episode duration. The co-administration of prazosin, but not propranolol, increased the REM percentage and the average REM sleep episode duration toward the placebo level. The co-administration of the peripherally-acting, anti-hypertensive agent hydralazine did not reverse the DMI-induced REM sleep suppression. While the identity of the brain region(s) involved in mediating the alpha-1 noradrenergic suppression of REM sleep by DMI remains unclear, there is reason to consider forebrain structures including the amygdala as well as the pontine areas that generally have been implicated in REM sleep control.",

    "30": "Aortic, left ventricular (LV), and pulmonary (Ppa) pressures and LV stroke volume (Svlv; derived from aortic flow probe) were measured after thoracotomy in eight anesthetized dogs. LV area or volume changes were measured using either an epicardial echocardiography (n = 6) or a conductance catheter (n = 2). LV end-systolic elastance (Eeslv) and preload recruitable stroke force (PRSFlv) relations, as estimates of contractility, were generated by transient inferior vena cava occlusion. Simultaneous stroke volume to arterial pressure relations during the occlusions were used to measure arterial elastance (Ea), and steady-state systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were used as measures of arterial tone. Graded doses of pyruvate (8, 16, and 32 mg/kg/min), dobutamine (positive control) and propranolol (negative control) and placebo (volume control) were sequentially given.", 
    "31": "Dobutamine increased Eeslv, PRSFlv, whereas propranolol had the opposite effect on Eeslv and PRSFlv. Pyruvate at 32 mg/kg/min increased heart rate, Ppa, and SVlv and decreased LV end-diastolic area, and systemic vascular resistance without changing arterial pressure, Eeslv, PRSFlv, or Ea.",

Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with either (--)-tertatolol (50 micrograms kg-1 hr-1), (--)-propranolol (250 micrograms kg-1 hr-1) or vehicle (1 mM HCl) for 14 days with osmotic minipumps implanted subcutaneously. 2. The mean daily systolic blood pressure and heart rate of rats treated with either (--)-tertatolol (108 +/- 1 mmHg/330 +/- 3 bpm) or (--)-propranolol (103 +/- 1 mmHg/330 +/- 2 bpm) were lower than in the control (126 +/- 1 mmHg/405 +/- 3 bpm, P < 0.001, n = 8-10) indicating the effectiveness of drug delivery. 3. Autoradiographic studies in areas of heart, lung and skin showed that beta-adrenoceptor populations were not significantly affected by the drug treatment (all regions P > 0.05). Nevertheless, the receptor population in the homogenates of (--)-tertatolol treated lung were halved (194 +/- 28 fmol mg protein-1 compared with a control value of 388 +/- 54 fmol mg protein-1, P < 0.01, n = 6). 4. In the presence of CGP 20712A, the left atrial inotropic and right atrial chronotropic responsiveness to (--)-isoprenaline were hypersensitive in both (--)-tertatolol and (--)-propranolol-treated groups (P < 0.005, ANCOVA). 5. (--)-Propranolol treated left ventricular free wall had lower basal [3H]-forskolin binding to adenylate cyclase (14.45 +/- 1.20 fmol mg protein-1 compared with a control value of 18.91 +/- 0.78 fmol mg protein-1, P = 0.01, n = 6). (--)-Tertatolol treatment had no effect on the basal binding. In the presence of the G-protein activators NaF and Gpp(NH)p, the enhancement of [3H]-forskolin binding did not differ between control and the drug treated groups. 6. Chronic (--)-tertatolol or (--)-propranolol treatment therefore did not produce an increase in receptors in heart, lung or skin but the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses were enhanced. In addition, [3H]-forskolin binding did not increase suggesting that the hypersensitivity was not due to changes in the number of receptors or adenylate cyclase. Hypersensitivity following beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist administration may therefore involve enhanced coupling of receptors to G-proteins.",

In nephrectomized SHR, Hoe 140 alone or cilazapril in combination with Hoe 140 (7 or 70 mu g/kg per day) induced no changes in these parameters, other than those associated with the effects of cilazapril alone. In nephrectomized WKY rats, cilazapril in combination with Hoe 140 (70 mu g/kg per day) slightly, but not significantly, attenuated the antihypertensive effect of cilazapril but did not affect the other parameters. These results were confirmed by morphological analysis of kidneys. All the drug regimens provided effective protection against an increase in focal glomerular sclerosis. Enalapril did not modify the antihypertensive and renoprotective effects of losartan in nephrectomized SHR.",

    "38": "The effects of losartan on blood pressure and on renal function have mainly been attributed to AT1 receptor blockade. Experimental evidence suggests that these effects could also be related to the actions of angiotensin II through AT2 receptors or to vasodilatory systems. The present study was therefore designed to investigate the manner in which the acute effects of losartan on renal excretory function are affected during simultaneous administration of an AT2 receptor antagonist, a kinin B2 receptor antagonist, a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor or a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor.",

The decrease in mean arterial pressure was blocked in the presence of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine but not during concurrent administration of PD 123319, Hoe 140 or meclofenamate. The increase in glomerular filtration rate induced by losartan was blunted by Hoe 140, meclofenamate and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Co-administration of PD 123319, Hoe 140 or meclofenamate, but not of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, partially blunted the diuresis and natriuresis induced by losartan.",

    "42": "This study was designed to investigate (1) whether norepinephrine is released in response to glucopenia in vitro, thereby stimulating glucagon secretion and, (2) the modulating effects of norepinephrine on insulin and glucagon secretion, using isolated perfused rat pancreas preparations. Simultaneous addition of the adrenergic receptor antagonists yohimbine, prazosin and propranolol, each at a concentration of 10-(5) mol/l, significantly potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (6.23 +/- 0.76 vs. 2.11 +/- 0.72 (control) nmol/min, P < 0.01), and suppressed glucopenia-induced glucagon secretion (0.59 +/- 0.10 vs. 1.34 + 0.18 (control) ng/min, P < 0.05). Also, 10-(5) mol/l yohimbine alone significantly potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (4.86 +/- 0.50 nmol/min, P < 0.05). The norepinephrine release inhibitor, guanethidine, significantly inhibited tyramine-induced secretion of both norepinephrine (7.86 +/- 0.77 vs. 49.7 +/- 2.3 nmol/min, P < 0.01) and glucagon (0.31 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.21 +/- 0.15 ng/min, P < 0.01), but exerted no effects on glucopenia-induced secretion of either norepinephrine or glucagon. We conclude that these results further support the concept that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine is released in response to glucopenia in vitro, and modulates insulin and glucagon secretion. Our data do not, however, provide evidence indicating that glucopenia-induced glucagon secretion is mainly mediated by activation of sympathetic nerve terminals around the alpha-cells in the isolated perfused rat pancreas.", 
    "43": "Repin is a sesquiterpene lactone found in Centaurea solstitialis, a plant responsible for Parkinson-like disease in horses. Repin, on intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, produces a dose-dependent and highly significant hypothermia in naive rats. The hypothermia is long-lasting with a peak 3 h after the injection and a return to normal temperature after more than 8 h. The effects of atropine sulfate, atropine methylbromide, propranolol, metergoline, ketanserin, diphenhydramine and apomorphine pretreatment on repin-induced hypothermia were investigated. None of the pretreatments directly antagonized repin's hypothermic effect. However, partial but significant reversals of hypothermia by atropine sulfate, metergoline, ketanserin, diphenhydramine and apomorphine were observed 2-4 h after the repin injection. These late-onset effects are probably due to secondary physiological mechanisms. On the other hand, propranolol, at 20 mg/kg i.p., clearly accentuated both the early-onset (30-90 min) and late-onset (2-4 h) hypothermic effects of repin.", 
    "44": "Eleganolone (1) and elegandiol (2), two linear diterpenes isolated from Cystoseira brachycarpa var. balearica, were tested on guinea-pig intestinal preparations. Both these compounds inhibited the contractile activities of acetylcholine (Ach) and histamine (Hist) on ileum musculature; the relative pIC50 values of eleganolone were found to be 4.60 +/- 0.03 and 4.84 +/- 0.20, respectively, while those of elegandiol were 4.71 +/- 0.18 and 5.18 +/- 0.01, respectively. Furthermore, 1 and 2 dose-dependently relaxed the same preparations precontracted with 300 microM BaCl2(pIC50 = 4.34 +/- 0.18 for 1 and pIC50 = 4.34 + 0.02 for 2) or with 60 mM KCl (pIC50 = 4.73 +/- 0.18 and 4.47 +/- 0.06, respectively). On colon smooth muscle, the diterpenes inhibited the spontaneous contractile tone and this effect was reversed by both methylene blue (3 x 10(-6) M) and haemoglobin (3 x 10(-6) M). Tetraethylammonium (TEA), furosemide, N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), indomethacin, alpha-chymotrypsin, and metoprolol were unable to block the eleganolone and elegandiol relaxing action on colonic musculature, but rather potentiated this response. On the contrary, the beta 2-blocker butoxamine partially inhibited the diterpenes activity. These results suggest that Cystoseira diterpenes act at a second messenger cyclase system rather than at a receptor level.",

These effects, which are seen with thiazide diuretics and loop diuretics but not with spironolactone, are independent of body weight but are strongly dose-related. beta-BLOCKING AGENTS: beta-Blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have adverse effects on lipid metabolism, but beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity do not. From the metabolic point of view, the latter type of beta-blockers represent the ideal choice, but they are rarely used today. All types of beta-blockers can cause an increase in fasting blood glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME (ACE) INHIBITORS AND CALCIUM ANTAGONISTS: Neither ACE inhibitors nor calcium antagonists show any negative effects on glucose and/or lipid metabolism. ACE inhibitors have even been shown to improve insulin sensitivity. ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are metabolically neutral, and there is evidence that combining an ACE inhibitor or calcium antagonist with a diuretic can reduce the adverse effects of the latter. ANTI-OXIDATION: Some calcium antagonists show a dose-dependent anti-oxidative activity. Lacidipine has the greatest anti-oxidative activity of the commonly used calcium channel blockers.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether these effects have any relevance in humans in vivo. Thirteen healthy individuals were studied in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study on five separate days. The subjects were pre-treated orally with either propranolol 400 mg in order to block beta-adrenoceptor mediated effects or placebo. Two hours after drug intake, three increasing doses of salmeterol (25 + 50 + 100 micrograms), salbutamol (100 + 200 + 400 micrograms) or placebo were given from matched meter dose inhalers at 1-h intervals between doses. Specific airway conductance (sGAW) was measured in a body plethysmograph at the beginning of the experiment and 30 and 60 min after each inhaled dose of the beta-agonists. Salmeterol and salbutamol produced the same maximal increase in sGAW and had the same area under the dose-response curves. Pre-treatment with propranolol totally inhibited the effect of both drugs. In conclusion, salmeterol at clinically used doses did not produce any non-beta-mediated bronchodilating effect in normal individuals, measured as sGAW. Salmeterol and salbutamol showed the same efficacy but salmeterol was four times more potent than salbutamol.",

CP-94,253 (5.0-10.0 mg/kg) significantly increased waking and reduced slow wave sleep (SWS) and REM sleep (REMS). At 2.0-4.0 mg/kg (+/-)pindolol reduced REMS. Pretreatment with (+/-)pindolol (2.0-4.0 mg/kg) reversed the effect of CP-94,253 on waking and SWS, while REMS remained suppressed.

However, the mortality on the 28th day revealed an excess hospital mortality in Lille compared to Strasbourg and Toulouse (p < 0.001). Toulouse infarct patients were younger. The emergency management of coronary patients subsequently admitted to hospital also differed (16.7% patients in Lille vs 40% in Strasbourg and 24.3% in Toulouse) (p < 0.01). In Lille, 41.6% of patients had known coronary heart disease vs 30.4% in Toulouse and 38.4% in Strasbourg (p < 0.05). These three characteristics influenced the mortality. During admission, considerable differences were observed in the therapeutic strategies in the 3 centres: in Toulouse, angioplasty was predominant (51.4%) together with prescription of calcium channel blockers (65.5%) and aspirin (82.5%). In Lille, there were a high prescription (20.3%) of antiplatelets other than aspirin during the acute phase compared to Toulouse (0.6%) and Strasbourg (7.3%). In Strasbourg, the cardiologists of the department rarely used angioplasty during the acute phase, but were the leading prescribers of beta-blockers. Fibrinolysis was performed in 4 out of 10 patients in the three centres. Aspirin was used in more than 7 out of 10 patients during the acute phase in all MONICA centres, but at a variable dosage: doses greater than or equal to 250 mg per day were prescribed in Toulouse (97.6%) and Strasbourg 82.8%), while, in Lille, only one out of 2 patients received this dosage (50.6%).",

Oxprenolol enantiomers were determined in plasma and urine by an enantioselective HPLC method. Oxprenolol glucuronides were measured in plasma and urine after enzymatic hydrolysis.", 
    "65": "The disposition of the oxprenolol enantiomers in rabbits is stereoselective, mainly due to a difference in metabolism. Renal excretion is only a minor elimination route for unchanged oxprenolol, and the renal clearances of the enantiomers are similar. Pretreatment with probenecid did not affect the plasma concentrations of the oxprenolol enantiomers, but there was a slight decrease in their urinary excretion. The plasma concentrations of the oxprenolol glucuronides are much higher than those of the parent enantiomers, and those of (S)-glucuronide are about twice those of its antipode. About 10% of the oxprenolol dose is excreted in the urine as glucuronides. The renal clearances of both glucuronides are similar, and markedly higher than the creatinine clearance. After probenecid, the mean glucuronide plasma levels were markedly higher, with for both glucuronides a more than twofold increase in mean AUC. Probenecid decreased the renal clearance of both glucuronides to about 30%. Moreover, it decreased slightly the formation clearance of (S)-glucuronide, while the formation clearance of (R)-glucuronide was not significantly influenced.",

    "67": "The effects of varying the electrical stimulation voltage on the noradrenergic tone and systolic and diastolic cardiac function of isolated rat cardiac preparations is unknown. If a wide range of voltages substantially alters the basal noradrerengic tone of isolated cardiac preparations, highly variable responses may complicate the interpretation of the cardiac effects of interventions, such as drugs or toxins. This study was designed to determine whether field or punctate electrode stimulation altered systolic and diastolic cardiac function of isolated rat atrial and ventricular muscle preparations through a beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated mechanism. Isolated left atria and right ventricular papillary muscles from adult Sprague-Dawley rats were stimulated to contract isometrically in Krebs bicarbonate buffer (30 degrees C, pH 7.4, 0.5 Hz). Cardiac muscle function was assessed by determining cardiac contractility (dF/dt), relaxation (80% relaxation time), and muscle stiffness (changes in resting force). Muscles were electrically stimulated to contract using either punctate or field electrodes. Basal values of cardiac function were determined at threshold voltages, and voltage was increased in stepwise fashion, over a wide range, to obtain a voltage response-relation to cardiac function. In left atrial preparations, both punctate and field electrical stimulation caused a 200% increase in cardiac contractility. The greatest changes in contractility occurred at near threshold voltages (less than 5 volts for punctate and 19 volts for field stimulation). The voltage-dependent increases in cardiac contractility were attenuated or abolished by pretreatment with atenolol (10 micromol/L; selective beta 1-antagonist) or reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p., 24 hr before euthanasia). In contrast to left atrial preparations, neither field or punctate electrical stimulation had any effect on the cardiac contractility of papillary muscle preparations. Neither field or punctate electrical stimulation had any effect on cardiac relaxation (80% relaxation time) or muscle stiffness (changes in resting force) of left atrial or papillary muscle preparations. This study demonstrates that punctate and field electrical stimulation can significantly increase cardiac contractility of rat left atrial preparations at near threshold voltages by increasing noradrenergic tone. Thus, control of the voltage range may be required to reduce variation in cardiac function of isolated rat left atrial preparations.", 
    "68": "Continuous perifusion of quartered anterior pituitary glands from juvenile and adult chickens of both sexes with chicken gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-I (cGnRH-I) stimulated a spike-plateau profile of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. When perifused in Ca(2+)-free medium, pituitary glands from juveniles of both sexes and from adult cockerels but not those from laying hens, released LH in response to cGnRH-I. This release occurred at the same time as the spike phase of the response seen in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and was not accompanied by a plateau phase of secretion. The magnitude of the plateau but not the spike phase of LH secretion from pituitary glands from adult males and females was reduced by the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine. This suggests that the mechanism of cGnRH-I-induced LH release from pituitary glands from laying hens is independent of mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, and that entry of Ca2+ during the spike phase of LH secretion occurs through non-L-type Ca2+ channels. Both non-L-type and L-type Ca2+ channels operate during the plateau phase of secretion in adults of both sexes. The duration of the spike phase of LH release from pituitary glands from adult cockerels was curtailed in the presence of nifedipine. The spike phase of LH release from the adult cockerel pituitary therefore involves three modes of Ca2+ flux, comprising an intracellular Ca(2+)-dependent component and extracellular components involving Ca2+ entry through L-type and non-L-type Ca2+ channels. The finding that the extracellular Ca(2+)-independent component of cGnRH-I-stimulated LH release from pituitary glands from juvenile hens is not present in adult hens suggests that this difference is related to sexual maturation. The maturational and sexual differences in the LH response to cGnRH-I could be mediated through the high concentrations of plasma 17 beta-oestradiol in adult hens which suppress the mobilization of intracellular stores of Ca2+ in the gonadotrophes.", 
    "69": "Effects of beta-agonists isoproterenol (Isp) and adrenaline (Adr) and beta-adrenoblocker obsidan (Obs) on the voltage-dependent calcium currents in cultured embryonic skeletal myocytes were studied at various stages of development ranging from day 2 to 10, using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique at 19-21 degrees C. Adr (or Isp) in concentrations 0.1-10 mumol/l increases the amplitude of both the slow dihydropyridine(DHP)-sensitive calcium current (ICa) and the fast-activated DHP-insensitive ICa. From day 2 to 6 after myoblast plating, Adr and Isp did not change the amplitude of ICa at all or slightly increased it. Obvious strong positive effects (an approximately twofold amplitude increase) on the calcium channels have been observed in 7-10-day-old myocytes only. beta-adrenoblocker obsidan known to abolish the positive beta-agonist effect, had a positive effect on membrane calcium currents. It may have been a result of the immaturity of the beta-adrenergic regulatory system of the myocytes. It is concluded that the beta-adrenergic regulatory complex can stimulate the activity of the fast and the slow voltage-dependent calcium channels of the frog skeletal myocytes, and that there is a distinct developmental stage at which a functioning beta-adrenergic regulatory complex appears in the membrane of skeletal myocytes.", 
    "70": "We have recently reported that class III antiarrhythmic drugs inhibit the muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor-operated K+ current (IK,ACh) in guinea-pig atrial cells by different molecular mechanisms. The data obtained from the patch-clamp study suggest that D,L-sotalol inhibits IK,ACh by blocking the muscarinic receptors, whereas MS-551 inhibits the K+ current by blocking the muscarinic receptors and depressing the function of the K+ channel itself and/or the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein). This study was undertaken to determine whether the class III antiarrhythmic drugs D,L-sotalol and MS-551 interact with the muscarinic receptors of cardiac and peripheral tissues. Both drugs inhibited concentration dependently the specific [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]-NMS) binding to membrane preparations obtained from guinea-pig atria and submandibular glands. The competition curves of these drugs for [3H]-NMS binding to glandular membranes were monophasic, suggesting competition with [3H]-NMS at a single site. Although the competition curve of D,L-sotalol for [3H]-NMS binding to atrial membranes was monophasic, that of MS-551 was biphasic and showed high- and low-affinity states of binding. D,L-Sotalol showed slightly, but significantly, higher affinity for cardiac-type muscarinic receptors (M2) than for glandular-type muscarinic receptors (M3). The inhibition constant (Ki) for MS-551 in glandular membranes was also slightly greater than the high-affinity Ki value for the drug in atrial membranes. In guinea-pig left atria and ilea, D,L-sotalol shifted the concentration-response curves for the negative inotropic effect and the contracting effect of carbachol in a parallel manner. The slopes of Schild plot were not significantly different from unity, suggesting competitive antagonism, and the pA2 for D,L-sotalol in left atria was slightly greater than that in ilea. MS-551 also shifted the concentration response curve for the negative inotropic effect of carbachol in atrial preparations to a greater extent than that for the contracting effect in ileal preparations, although MS-551 failed to show a pure competitive antagonism. These results suggest that both D,L-sotalol and MS-551 interact with cardiac M2 and peripheral M3 receptors, and that at high concentrations they exert anticholinergic activity in cardiac and peripheral tissues.",

PGE2 mucosal generation was significantly increased in both the antrum (9.8, 19.5, 19.7 ng/mg proteins, p<0.05, respectively) and in the corpus (8.1, 14.0, 20.2 ng/mg proteins, p<0.05, respectively). PGE2 generation was not related to potential difference. Glucagon serum levels were related to the grade of gastropathy. A 1-week administration of 160 mg/d long-acting propranolol, 35 micro g/d enprostil or placebo did not significantly modify basal potential difference.", 
    "74": "Portal hypertensive gastropathy is characterized by a decreased potential difference proportional to the endoscopic severity. The gastric mucosa of patients with cirrhosis seems to be more susceptible to aspirin than that of healthy subjects. It appears that the role of PGE2 is controversial in portal hypertensive gastropathy. Propranolol and enprostil do not improve this decreased potential difference.", 
    "75": "We present a detailed review of the medications used in the USA, Canada, and the United Kingdom for the prevention of migraine and the potential ocular adverse effects associated with the use of these medications. Those drugs that are administered for the purpose of reducing the frequency or severity of migraine attacks are classified according to whether they act on the cerebral vasculature primarily at serotonin (5-HT2) receptors (e.g., methysergide, cyproheptadine, and pizotyline), beta adrenergic (primarily beta-2) receptors (e.g., propranolol and timolol), via central nervous system (CNS) adrenergic (alpha-2) receptors (e.g., clonidine), or calcium channels (e.g., flunarizine). The roles and mechanisms of action of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the prophylactic management of migraine are also discussed, along with possible pharmacogenetic differences in the kinetics of action of some of these drugs. The general indications, contraindications, and potential ocular and systemic adverse effects of each class of drugs is reviewed and presented along with the references to original literature on these effects.", 
    "76": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method with electrochemical detection has been developed for the determination of six beta-blockers: atenolol, nadolol, timolol, metoprolol, oxprenolol, and alprenolol. The chromatographic separation was performed using a mu Bondapack C18 column, a mobile phase of acetonitrile-water (40:60), containing 5 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4 proved to be optimal at a 1.3 ml/min flow-rate, and a pH of 6.5. The temperature was optimized at 30 +/- 0.2 degrees C. The amperometric detector, equipped with a glassy carbon electrode, was operated at 1300 mV versus Ag/AgCl in the direct current mode. The method was applied to the determination of these compounds at two concentration levels: ppm and ppb (ng/ml), obtaining relative standard deviations lower than 5% at ppm levels and lower than 10% at ppb levels, and quantitation limits ranging from 15 ppb to 500 ppb. The method was applied to the screening of beta-blockers in spiked urine samples, with a total elution time lower than 12 min, obtaining the best recoveries for timolol and metoprolol (never greater than 93%). These recoveries together with the low limits of quantitation achieved, allows its application to doping analysis in human urine.", 
    "77": "A simple and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of (+)-(S)-sotalol and (-)-(R)-sotalol in biological fluids was established. Following extraction with isopropyl alcohol from biological samples on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge, the eluent was derivatized with 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate (GITC). The diastereoisomeric derivates were resolved by HPLC with UV detection at 225 nm. Calibration was linear from 0.022 to 4.41 micrograms/ml in human plasma and from 0.22 to 88.2 micrograms/ml in human urine for both (+)-(S)- and (-)-(R)-sotalol. The lower limit of determination was 0.022 microgram/ml for plasma and 0.22 microgram/ml for urine. The within-day and day-to-day coefficients of variation were less than 7.5% for each enantiomer at 0.09 and 1.8 microgram/ml in plasma and at 0.44 and 4.4 micrograms/ml in urine. The method is also applicable to other biological specimens such as rat, mouse and rabbit plasma.", 
    "78": "Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of high doses of theophylline decreased memory acquisition dose dependently. Low but not high doses of the dopamine receptor D2 antagonist sulpiride and the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 decreased the theophylline response. Pimozide and the beta-adrenoreceptor propranolol also decreased the drug response. The anti-muscarinic agent atropine, the alpha-adrenoceptor phenoxybenzamine and the 5-HT antagonist metergoline did not affect the response induced by theophylline. It is concluded that dopamine and beta-adrenergic receptor mechanisms may be involved in the theophylline-induced attenuation of memory acquisition.", 
    "79": "The present study was undertaken to compare the effects of first-line antihypertensive drugs in Japanese patients. Four antihypertensive drugs were studied: trichlormethiazide (TCT), nifedipine retard (NIF), atenolol (ATN), and enalapril malate (ENP). Thirty-eight patients (16 men and 22 women; age, 53.3 +/- 8.8 years, mean +/- SD) were enrolled in the study. After a control period of 2 to 4 weeks, the four drugs were administered according to a randomized, cross-over design, the duration of each treatment period being 8 to 12 weeks. The initial dose of each drug was increased until blood pressure (BP) fell to less than 150/90 mmHg. The maximum doses of TCT, NIF, ATN, and ENP were 4, 40, 50, and 20 mg/day, respectively. The protocol was completed in 25 of the 38 patients. The BPs (SBP/DBP) at the end of each period were 168 +/- 3 (mean +/- SEM)/105 +/- 1 (control), 149 +/- 4/ 98 +/- 2 (TCT), 138 +/- 3/89 +/- 2 (NIF), 151 +/- 4/94 +/- 2 (ATN), and 152 +/- 4/97 +/- 2 mmHg (ENP). The BP during NIF treatment was significantly lower than during the other treatments. This finding suggests that the calcium antagonist had a greater hypotensive effect than the other first-line antihypertensive drugs studied. The subjects seem to more closely resemble black rather than white populations with respect to their response to antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "80": "1. The effects of dopamine on the slow Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current (IAHP; AHP, afterhyperpolarization) and spike frequency adaptation were studied by whole cell voltage-clamp and sharp microelectrode current-clamp recordings in rat CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices. 2. Dopamine suppressed IAHP in a dose-dependent manner, under whole cell voltage-clamp conditions. Similarly, under current-clamp conditions, dopamine inhibited spike frequency adaptation and suppressed the slow afterhyperpolarization. 3. The effect of dopamine on IAHP was mimicked by a D1 receptor agonist and blocked by dopamine receptor antagonists only in a minority of the cells. 4. Dopamine suppressed IAHP after blocking or desensitizing the beta-adrenergic receptors and, hence, did not act by cross-reacting with this receptor type. 5. The effects of dopamine on IAHP and spike frequency adaptation were suppressed by blocking the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent kinase (PKA) with Rp-cAMPS and, hence, are probably mediated by the activation of this kinase. 6. We conclude that dopamine increases hippocampal neuron excitability, like other monoamine neurotransmitters, by suppressing IAHP and spike frequency adaptation, via cAMP and protein kinase A. The receptor type mediating this effect of dopamine remains to be defined.", 
    "81": "To obtain large quantities of pure human beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2-AR) needed for structural studies, an efficient method for beta 2-AR purification was developed using a recombinant receptor with an eight amino acid epitope at its C-terminus. This epitope is recognized by KT3-monoclonal antibody. The epitope tagged beta 2-AR was expressed in Sf9 cells with a specific activity of 5-20 pmol/mg of membrane protein. The epitope-tagged and wild-type receptors had identical ligand binding properties. The tagged receptor was solubilized using dodecyl-beta-maltoside with a quantitative yield. Solubilized epitope-tagged receptors were partially purified by KT3-mAb immunoaffinity in 60-70% yield. Further purification of the receptors on an alprenolol-affinity column resulted in a homogenous preparation with an overall yield of > 30%. The purified receptor was concentrated to > 1 mg/ml without loss of ligand binding activity.", 
    "82": "1. The effect of bupranolol on CGP 12177-induced relaxation and cAMP accumulation in the guinea pig taenia caecum was examined. 2. The relaxant response to CGP 12177 was unaffected by propranolol (approximately 10(-6) M), whereas that to CGP 12177 was antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner by bupranolol; Schild plot of the data revealed the pA2 value of 5.61. 3. CGP 12177 significantly increased cyclic AMP level in this preparation. Bupranolol (10(-4) M) significantly decreased the cyclic AMP level that was elicited by CGP 12177, whereas propranolol (10(-5) M) produced no effect. 4. These results suggest that bupranolol appears to be an efficient beta3-antagonist in the guinea pig taenia caecum and confirm that the response to CGP 12177 is mediated by beta3-adrenoceptors.", 
    "83": "In cardiac failure, continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic recording for 24 hours (Holter system) enables detection of 60 to 80% of complex ventricular arrhythmias, 15 to 40% of atrial arrhythmias and sudden death accounts for about 40% of fatalities but its causes are multiple and sometimes unrelated to arrhythmias. Abnormalities of cardiac structure, metabolic and neuro-hormonal changes and some drug therapies are implicated in the genesis of these arrhythmias, the management of which is discussed in two different situations with respect to the functional incapacity: in paucisymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias in patients with cardiac failure, class I antiarrhythmics and d-sotalol should be avoided and betablockers prescribed with caution; the indications of amiodarone have not yet been determined. When the arrhythmia is symptomatic (sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation), class I antiarrhythmics are not effective enough in the prevention of sudden death; betablockers and amiodarone may give good results but should be compared with implantable defibrillators in the future. The multiplicity and complexity of the mechanisms of arrhythmias in cardiac failure, and the inadequate results obtained with classical antiarrhythmics necessitate the development of new antiarrhythmics based on blockade of non-selective channels probably activated in cardiac failure by the stretching of myocardial fibres.", 
    "84": "Sympathetic beta-adrenergic influences on cardiovascular responses to 50 degrees head-up tilt were evaluated with metoprolol (beta 1-blockade; 0.29 mg kg-1) and propranolol (beta 1 and beta 2-blockade; 0.28 mg kg-1) in eight males. A normotensive-tachycardic phase was followed by a hypotensive-bradycardic episode associated with presyncopal symptoms after 23 +/- 3 min (control, mean +/- SE). Head-up tilt made thoracic electrical impedance (3.0 +/- 1.0 omega), mean arterial pressure (MAP, 86 +/- 4-93 +/- 4 mmHg), heart rate (HR, 63 +/- 3-99 +/- 10 beats min-1) and total peripheral resistance (TPR, 15 +/- 1-28 +/- 4 mmHg min L-1) increase, while central venous oxygen saturation (74 +/- 2-58 +/- 4%), cardiac output (5.7 +/- 0.1-3.1 +/- 0.3 L min-1), stroke volume (95 +/- 6-41 +/- 5 mL) and pulse pressure (55 +/- 4-49 +/- 4 mmHg) decreased (P < 0.05). Central venous pressure decreased during head-up tilt (7 +/- 2-0 +/- 1 mmHg), but it remained stable during the sustained tilt. At the appearance of presyncopal symptoms MAP (49 +/- 3 mmHg), HR (66 +/- 4 beats min-1) and TPR (15 +/- 3 mmHg min L-1) decreased (P < 0.05). Neither metoprolol or propranolol changed tilt tolerance or cardiovascular variables, except for HR that remained at 57 +/- 2 (metoprolol) and 55 +/- 3 beats min-1 (propranolol), and MAP that remained at 87 +/- 5 mmHg during the first phase with metoprolol. In conclusion, sympathetic activation was crucial for the heart rate elevation during normotensive head-up tilt, but not for tilt tolerance or for the associated hypotension and bradycardia.", 
    "85": "The stroke patient often suffers additional medical complications related to age, heart and artery damage and immobility. Pulmonary embolism is one condition that can sometimes be prevented. Heart disease must be detected and treated, as it is the principal cause of death after stroke. Recent data describing the physiology of stroke suggest that hypotension, hyperglycemia and hyperthermia should be prevented, as these conditions increase the likelihood of death or sequelae. Stroke is no longer a \"wait and see\" disease.", 
    "86": "1. The effects of 4 week treatment with rilmenidine or atenolol on tests of mental stress, dynamic exercise, autonomic function and psychometric tests were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. 2. After a 4 week placebo run-in, 12 patients with essential hypertension (blood pressure [BP] 160/95 +/- 15/7 mmHg) received rilmenidine 1-2 mg day-1, and atenolol 50-100 mg day-1, each for 4 weeks, with a 4 week placebo wash-out between drug treatments. 3. Both agents produced a comparable reduction in supine and erect BP. During the mental arithmetic test, BP and heart rate (HR) responses were similar for rilmenidine and atenolol. 4. During bicycle exercise, the increase in HR was significantly greater after rilmenidine (+50 vs 41 beats min-1, P = 0.04). During recovery, the areas under the curve for diastolic BP (46,450 vs 51,400 mmHg s, P = 0.02) and HR (49,445 vs 63,597 beats min-1 s, P = 0.001) were significantly less with atenolol than rilmenidine. 5. Neither rilmenidine nor atenolol affected mental performance as judged by arithmetic and psychomotor tests. Physiological responses to autonomic function tests (deep breathing, facial immersion, isometric handgrip and cold pressor) were preserved with both drugs. The standing to lying ratio was higher on atenolol (P = 0.01) and Valsalva ratio was higher on rilmenidine (P = 0.03). 6. In conclusion, rilmenidine and atenolol exerted comparable antihypertensive effects both at rest and during mental and dynamic stress. Atenolol attenuated HR responses to dynamic exercise and the Valsalva manoeuvre; rilmenidine did not interfere with the physiological responses of BP and HR during autonomic function tests.", 
    "87": "The use of Beta-blockers for treatment of chronic heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy has now begun to be accepted among cardiologists after having been used sporadically for 19 years. Pooled data from several minor controlled trials performed during the last 13 years which have shown consistent improvement of myocardial function, specifically in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, have recently been confirmed by two major trials using the selective beta-blockers metoprolol (MDC trial) and bisoprolol (CIBIS trial). There was a decrease of 34% in the combined number of deaths and patients needing a heart transplantation (P = 0.058) in the MDC trial. Bisoprolol, as well as reducing the overall mortality significantly, was found, in a retrospective subgroup analysis, to reduce mortality in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The MDC trial showed improvement in ejection fraction by 7 units compared with placebo and 13 units compared with baseline after 12 months treatment (P < 0.0001). There was also an increase in exercise time compared with placebo at 12 months follow-up. There was a 39% reduction in the number of readmissions to hospital due to heart failure and arrhythmias (P < 0.04) and a 32% reduction in the CIBIS trial (P < 0.01). Possible mechanisms for improvement after beta-blockers are improvement in myocardial energetic balance, protection against calcium overload or normalization of myocardial catecholamine kinetics. The role of upregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors remains controversial since this could not be seen in the action of all beta-blockers. The question of whether mortality can be reduced remains unsolved and will require large prospective trials which are now in progress.",

    "89": "Patients in western Sweden on whom coronary artery bypass grafting was performed between June 1988 and June 1991 were evaluated for inclusion during the first 3 weeks after surgery. Major exclusion criteria were age > 75 years, concomitant valve surgery, traditional contraindications to beta-blockers and unwillingness to participate. Patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to 100 mg of metoprolol/placebo daily for 2 weeks and thereafter 200 mg daily for 2 years.", 
    "90": "Of 2365 patients who were operated on, 967 were randomized to either metoprolol (n = 480) or placebo (n = 487). Primary end points (death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, need for coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty), were reached by 42 patients in the metoprolol group (8.8%), as compared with 39 in the placebo group (8.0%) (P = 0.73). Of all the patients randomized to metoprolol, 34% withdrew from blind treatment prematurely compared with 44% for placebo (P < 0.01).", 
    "91": "Prophylactic treatment with metoprolol over a 2-year period after coronary artery bypass grafting did not reduce death or the development of cardiac events. However, the 95% confidence limits ranged from the possibility of a 30% reduction in events to a 68% increase in events if patients were treated with metoprolol as compared with placebo.", 
    "92": "The purpose of this trial was to study the additional anti-ischaemic effects of amlodipine in coronary patients with ambulant ischaemia despite beta-blocker therapy. Beta-blockers are the most effective drug therapy for reducing the frequency and duration of ambulatory ischaemic episodes. However, the therapeutic advantage of combined calcium antagonist-beta-blocker treatment remains questionable. Three hundred and thirteen patients with documented coronary artery disease, a positive exercise test within 6 months before entry and background beta-blocker therapy, were screened. Inclusion criteria (> or = 4 episodes of transient ST segment depression of > or = 1.0 mm and/or > or = 20 min of ischaemia) were demonstrated in a 48 h ECG during the placebo run-in period in 84 (25%) of the patients. Eighty-nine percent of the ischaemic episodes were silent. The eligible patients were then randomized in a 2-week, double-blind, parallel group study comparing placebo to amlodipine 10 mg daily added to the beta-blocker. The anti-ischaemic efficacy of the combination therapy was assessed by 48 h ECG monitoring and exercise tests. Compared to placebo, amlodipine did not significantly reduce either the frequency (3.7 +/- 4.3 vs 4 +/- 4.8 episodes in the amlodipine group) or the duration of ambulatory ischaemia (mean duration: 43.9 +/- 57.1 vs 39.6 +/- 65.7 min, total duration 3.1 +/- 6.7 vs 2.8 +/- 6.1 h). Exercise-induced ST segment depression tended to decrease with amlodipine (58% vs 73% in the placebo group) and the ischaemia-free workload capacity was increased (+1.7 stage vs 0.7 stage in the placebo group, P = 0.08). These results suggest that 2 weeks treatment with amlodipine may not provide any additional anti-ischaemic benefit in patients with ambulant ischaemia resistant to a beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "93": "After the diazepines, new agents have appeared: sleep-inducing cyclopyrrolones, pure anxiolytic serotoninergic agents such as buspirone or 5HT2 antagonists such as ritanserine, there is also renewed interest for beta-blockers and alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, calcium blocking agents and some NMDA blockers.", 
    "94": "The beta-adrenergic modulation of the inwardly-rectifying K+ channel (IK1) was examined in isolated human ventricular myocytes using patch-clamp techniques. Isoproterenol (ISO) reversibly depolarized the resting membrane potential and prolonged the action potential duration. Under the whole-cell C1- -free condition, ISO applied via the bath solution reversibly inhibited macroscopic IdK1. The reversal potential of the ISO-sensitive current was shifted by approximately 60 mV per 10-fold change in the external K+ concentration and was sensitive to Ba2+. The ISO-induced inhibition of IK1 was mimicked by forskolin and dibutyrl cAMP, and was prevented by including a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor (PKI) in the pipette solution. In single-channel recordings from cell-attached patches, bath applied ISO could suppress IK1 channels by decreasing open state probability. Bath application of the purified catalytic sub-unit of PKA to inside-out patches also inhibited IK1 and the inhibition could be antagonized by alkaline phosphatase. When beta-adrenergic modulation of IK1 was compared between ventricular myocytes isolated from the failing and the nonfailing heart, channel response to ISO and PKA was significantly reduced in myocytes from the failing heart. Although ISO inhibited IK1 in a concentration-dependent fashion in both groups, a half-maximal concentration was greater in failing (0.12 microM) than in nonfailing hearts (0.023 microM). These results suggest that IK1 in human ventricular myocytes can be inhibited by a PKA-mediated phosphorylation and the modulation is significantly reduced in ventricular myocytes from the failing heart compared to the nonfailing heart.", 
    "95": "The physiological changes occurring during pregnancy and labour may reveal or exacerbate the symptoms of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). We describe the management of labour in a patient with severe HOCM during which esmolol, a short-acting beta adrenergic antagonist, was used together with extradural analgesia and invasive cardiovascular monitoring to achieve an assisted vaginal delivery with minimal haemodynamic disturbance. The effects on the infant are described and the literature on the use of esmolol in pregnancy is reviewed.", 
    "96": "We conducted a randomized, double-blind investigation to determine whether enoximone affects the actions of dobutamine in patients taking beta adrenoceptor antagonists. We studied sixteen patients with good ventricular function after coronary artery bypass operations. All patients were taking a beta adrenoceptor antagonist. The patients received a standardized intravenous anaesthetic, which was maintained throughout the investigation. They received a masked infusion, containing either normal saline or enoximone. Haemodynamic data were recorded before, during, and after an infusion of dobutamine, which was given at three different rates. Patients receiving enoximone had a greater cardiac output, a higher heart rate and a lower systemic vascular resistance than patients receiving saline. They also required an average of 1500 ml more intravenous colloid in the immediate postoperative period to achieve haemodynamic stability. Dobutamine produced a consistent, significant peripheral vasoconstriction, but no inotropic or chronotropic effect. There was no significant difference in this effect between the two groups, and it was not influenced by concurrent therapy with enoximone. The alpha adrenergic action of dobutamine prevented us from using high enough rates of infusion to explore any interaction between the inotropic actions of dobutamine and enoximone.", 
    "97": "This prospective study was designed to compare the effectiveness of esmolol (either 100 mg or 200 mg) with a placebo in blunting the haemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation. Seventy-five patients of ASA I or II scheduled for routine-surgery were selected and entered into a placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomly allocated to receive placebo, 100 mg or 200 mg of esmolol IV as part of an anaesthetic induction technique. There were no significant differences in the demographic distribution of the patients in the study. There was no statistical difference in the baseline heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) between the three groups. One minute after the administration of the drug (prior to intubation) the differences in HR between the placebo group and both the 100 mg and 200 mg groups were significant (p < 0.05), and also at 1 min and 2 min following intubation for the 200 mg group (p < 0.05). In the 200 mg group there was a significant decrease, compared with placebo, in SBP at 1 min (p < 0.05) and at 2 min (p < 0.05) after intubation. In this study, adequate haemodynamic control following was obtained with the administration of 200 mg of esmolol.", 
    "98": "The clinician prescribing beta-blockers for his or her patients is faced with an often difficult situation. There are many beta-blockers, each with its own pharmacological profile. Patients are often taking multiple medications, thus increasing the risk of both anticipated and unexpected drug interactions. Reports of drug interactions are frequently anecdotal. The prescriber may not be aware of the patient's other medications or lifestyle habits. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions involving beta-blockers are documented in the literature, but these studies often examine small numbers of patients. For these reasons, it is difficult for the practitioner to distill guidelines for the administration of beta-blockers in conjunction with other medication. In general, beta-blockers are well tolerated, and symptomatic drug interactions are relatively infrequent. It is incumbent upon the clinical practitioner to have knowledge of his or her patient's drug profile and to be aware of the various drug interactions as well as each patient's unique pathophysiological profile when prescribing any medication, including beta-blockers. beta-Blockers may interact with a large number of commonly prescribed drugs, including antihypertensive and antianginal drugs, inotropic agents, anti-arrhythmics, NSAIDs, psychotropic drugs, anti-ulcer medications, anaesthetics, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, warfarin, oral hypoglycaemics and rifampicin (rifampin).", 
    "99": "This study was designed to examine the effects of the drugs ketamine, morphine, pentobarbital, and propranolol on fetal chemoreceptor responsiveness. Eleven fetal lambs (gestational age 125-133 d) were chronically instrumented with a catheter in a hindlimb artery and vein and a forelimb artery; a carotid arterial oximeter catheter was placed in six of these fetuses. An inflatable cuff occluder was placed around the maternal hypogastric artery. Acute fetal hypoxemia was induced repeatedly by reducing uterine blood flow. Fetal heart rate, arterial pressure, and carotid arterial oxygen saturation were monitored continuously before and after administering ketamine, morphine, pentobarbital, or propranolol to the fetus. The ratio delta heart rate/delta O2 saturation has been shown previously to be a reproducible index of chemoreflex response. The differences in baseline values and changes with drugs were compared by multiple regression analysis coded by effects. Chemoreflex response was markedly attenuated by ketamine and morphine but not by pentobarbital or propranolol. Because the cardiovascular response to hypoxemia is blunted by some drugs, caution should be exercised in interpreting heart rate responses to hypoxemia in the fetus when these drugs have been administered to the mother.", 
    "100": "The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between minute ventilation (VE) and plasma concentrations of epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE) during incremental cycling (20 W.2 min-1) performed under conditions of beta-adrenergic blockade (80 mg of propranolol) and placebo in six untrained male subjects. No significant differences existed between treatments in O2 uptake, CO2 output, blood lactate, pH, or VE during the submaximal work stages of incremental exercise common to both treatments (20 - 220 W). During exercise with beta-blockade, EPI, and NE concentrations were both significantly elevated compared with control levels at every submaximal work stage. Significant positive correlations between VE and plasma levels of EPI and NE were found during both beta-blockade (r = 0.98 and 1.00) and control conditions (r = 0.98 and 0.96). Although the high correlations were unchanged during exercise with beta-blockade, the slopes of the regression lines for the VE-EPI and the VE-NE relationships were both significantly reduced compared with control conditions. Beta-blockade resulted in elevated plasma levels of both EPI and NE compared with control conditions without causing a change in exercise VE. These findings suggest that catecholamines may not be important substances in regulating breathing during exercise.", 
    "101": "Cardiac rehabilitation after a myocardial infarction has been shown to improve exercise capacity. Beta blockade has been shown to be effective in treating angina and reducing mortality, but studies are controversial as to whether beta-blockade therapy attenuates the effects of training. We attempted to study the effects of beta blockade (metoprolol) on the response to training in patients enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program after an uncomplicated myocardial infarction. We studied 27 patients with a recent uncomplicated myocardial infarction who were subdivided in two groups: Group 1 (13 patients) not taking a beta blocker, and Group 2 (14 patients) taking metoprolol (mean 142 +/- 57 mg daily). All patients underwent a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test before and after a 3-month training program. The training intensity was designed to approximate the ventilatory threshold. Results showed an increase in peak VO2 in both Group 1 (27%, p < 0.01) and Group 2 (33%, p < 0.001), and an increase in VO2 at the ventilatory threshold (39% in Group 1 and 28% in Group 2, p < 0.01). The mean changes in exercise capacity were not different between groups. It was concluded that metoprolol did not influence the beneficial effects of a cardiac rehabilitation program in postmyocardial infarction patients.", 
    "102": "Twelve healthy subjects were investigated on six separate occasions at least 1 week apart when they either received a single oral dose of 80 mg propranolol; 25, 50, 100, or 400 mg talinolol; or placebo (double-blinded, period-balanced six-way cross-over design). The subjects were investigated during supine rest and performed supine bicycle ergometry 0200, 0500, 0730, 1000, and 2400 h after dosing. Isoprenaline (ISO) and epinephrine (EPI) were infused intravenously (i.v.) at a constant infusion rate of 1 microgram/min for 10 min, at 0315 and 0400 h after dosing, respectively. At various timepoints, blood was drawn for the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) determination of the plasma concentrations of talinolol's enantiomers and for the ex vivo in vitro determination of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor binding and related concentrations by radioreceptor assay (RRA). Talinolol was confirmed to bind to beta-adrenoceptors with moderate affinity but to act as a highly selective and efficient beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist in terms of the relative degree and duration of its ergometric effects. At doses < or = 100 mg talinolol hardly altered the reduction of estimated vascular total peripheral resistance (TPR) in response to the intravenous infusion of ISO and EPI. Only at doses of 400 mg did talinolol more closely approximate the effects of propranolol, which lead to a loss of the vasodilatory actions of EPI (\"EPI reversal\"). On the average, there was a smoothly linear relationship between the ergometric treatment effects and log-transformed dose, the logtransformed concentrations of the S(-)-enantiomer measured by HPLC, and the RRA-derived estimated occupancies beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "103": "The value of K+ channel blockade in preventing lethal arrhythmias, and specifically those triggered by acute myocardial ischemia and sympathetic hyperactivity, remains unproven. To address this issue, we tested the antifibrillatory effect of d-sotalol, and Ikr blocker, d,l-sotalol, its racemic compound which blocks Ikr, and beta-adrenoreceptors, and propranolol. Ten dogs with a healed anterior myocardial infarction (MI) had ventricular fibrillation (VF) during a 2-min occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery performed toward the end of a submaximal exercise stress test. In successive trials in the same animals, d-sotalol (three injections of 8 mg/kg, one every 12 h), d,l-sotalol (8 mg/kg), and propranolol (1 mg/kg) were tested. All three interventions significantly reduced heart rate (HR) response to exercise, but only d,l-sotalol and propranolol also blunted the reflex HR increase during acute myocardial ischemia. With d-sotalol, HR at 30 s of coronary occlusion was similar (253 +/- 28 beats/min) to that observed in the control tests (259 +/- 35 beats/min). d-Sotalol prevented recurrence of VF in only 1 of 10 dogs tested. One dog was lost to the continuation of the study after occurrence of VF with d-sotalol. Six of 9 dogs (67%) tested with d,l-sotalol and 5 (56%) of the same 9 dogs tested with propranolol were protected from VF. d-Sotalol does not reduce risk of VF during acute myocardial ischemia associated with sympathetic hyperactivity, and lethal events can be prevented by antiadrenergic interventions.", 
    "104": "The metabolic effects of captopril 25 mg twice daily and atenolol 50 mg daily on glucose, insulin and lipids were compared in 83 otherwise healthy mild-to-moderate hypertensive between the ages of 25 and 60 years in a randomised double-blind trial. Hourly glucose and insulin levels were measured during a 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Lipid profiles including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, HDL2, HDL3, triglycerides, apoprotein (Apo)A1, ApoB, and Apo(a) were obtained before and after the treatment period. Blood pressure decreased significantly and equivalently in both treatment groups. The glucose and insulin levels and glucose x insulin product at 2 hours after the glucose load increased after 12 weeks of treatment with atenolol compared with the baseline values, but these parameters all decreased after the treatment period with captopril compared with their baseline values. These results indicate an improvement in insulin sensitivity with captopril and a deterioration with atenolol. HDL-cholesterol and HDL3 decreased in the atenolol group but increased in the captopril group. We conclude that captopril has more favourable effects than atenolol on glucose, insulin and lipid metabolism in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension.", 
    "105": "New South African guidelines are proposed by the Hypertension Society of Southern Africa for the management of hypertension by primary health care services in South Africa. Specific South African guidelines are appropriate for hypertension, which is now recognised as one of the five major diseases that must be given priority by the new Government. Furthermore, patient participation and empowerment in blood pressure (BP) control become feasible through the new concept of lifestyle modification. This article gives the rationale underpinning these guidelines. The correct methods to measure blood pressure (BP), with patients sitting for 5 minutes, correct cuff-size and repeated readings, are emphasised to eliminate the 'white coat' effect and ensure accurate BP readings. The rationale for the overall management of all atherosclerosis-related risk factors is given, as are the principles of non-drug hypertension treatment and patient education. We emphasise that patients must understand hypertension to be a risk factor and not a disease. Patients should also be empowered to contribute to effective BP control. The justification for the chosen BP levels at which specific action is required by the primary health care team is given. The BP levels span the range from mild hypertension, requiring conservative treatment schedules, to possible malignant hypertension, which requires urgent management and referral to the appropriate level of care. The motivation for cost-effective antihypertensive drug therapy is provided. The recommended initiation of drug therapy is with effective, safe low-cost drugs. Suggested first-line therapy comprises lifestyle management and low-dose diuretics. The second-line drugs, in order of increasing price, are low-dose reserpine, or a beta-blocker, or a calcium blocker, or an ACE inhibitor. For third-line therapy hydralazine is chosen, or other second-line drugs could be added. Where possible, the examples of specific drugs given are those for which a generic is available, to ensure cost-containment. The motivation for drug choices for hypertension in special cases such as pregnancy, the elderly, blacks and patients with diabetes and renal disease is given. The management of malignant hypertension receives special attention.", 
    "106": "Primary writing tremor (PWT) is considered to be a type of task-specific tremor in which tremor predominantly occurs and interferes with handwriting. We describe the clinical and neurophysiological features of 21 patients (20 male and one female) with PWT. Mean age at tremor onset was 50.1 years. A family history of PWT was obtained from seven patients. Ten patients obtained benefit from drug treatment (mainly propranalol or primidone) and seven responded to alcohol. The writing speeds of the patients (mean +/- SEM: 73.1 +/- 6.6 letters per minute) when using their preferred hand were significantly reduced (Student's t test: P < 0.001) compared with those of healthy control subjects (mean +/- SEM: 127.7 +/- 6.4). Surface polymyography performed during writing showed 4.1-7.3 Hz rhythmic activity predominantly in the intrinsic hand and forearm muscles. Alternating, extensor activation alone, skipping from alternating to extensor activation, and co-contracting EMG patterns were recorded from the flexor and extensor muscles of the forearm. There was no evidence for excessive 'overflow' of this rhythmic EMG activity, as similar activity was detected in comparable muscle groups of healthy control subjects. Accelerometry confirmed that the frequency of PWT ranged from 4.1-7.3 Hz (median 5.5 Hz) and that normal subjects wrote with a 4.0-7.7 Hz oscillation (median 4.6 Hz). Forearm reciprocal inhibition was normal in PWT (n = 13), and thus patients with PWT can be distinguished from those with writer's cramp in whom decreased presynaptic inhibition has been found. Patients were sub-classified as having either type A (n = 11) or B (n = 10) PWT depending on whether tremor appeared during writing (type A: task induced tremor) or whilst writing and adopting the hand position used in writing (type B: positionally sensitive tremor). However, the only differences between these two groups were that a co-contracting EMG pattern and tremor induced by tendon taps to the volar aspect of the wrist were present in type B but not type A cases.", 
    "107": "Elevated expression and activity of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) have been indicated in various renal diseases, implicating the potential involvement of this growth factor in the accumulation of extracellular matrix. To assess its potential role on protein turnover in tubule cells, we investigated in LLC-PK1 cells the effects of TGF-beta 1 on the activities of lysosomal cysteine proteinases cathepsins B, H, and L + B, which play a major role in the degradation of both cellular protein and extracellular matrix. The results show that 1-10 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 exerted inhibitory effects on cathepsin B and L + B activities, when applied to either the basolateral or apical membrane of these cells (basolateral side: B -23.2%, L + B -19.9%; apical side: B -28.2%, L + B -22.6%). Application of TGF-beta 1 to both sides enhanced suppression of the enzyme activities (B -37.8%, L + B -37.4%). This suppression of cathepsin activities was accompanied by a reduction of cellular protein degradation rate by 20.0% after 24 h and 51.7% after 48 h. Furthermore, TGF-beta 1 stimulated cellular protein synthesis by 50.0% after 48 h. The combined effects on protein turnover resulted in cellular hypertrophy: increases of both protein content and cell size after 48 h. Concerning the underlying mechanism, TGF-beta 1 did not induce a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration nor did Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil (10(-6) M) ameliorate the TGF-beta 1-induced inhibition of cathepsin activities. However, TGF-beta 1 raised the pH in lysosomes, which obviously impaired the acidic cysteine proteinases. In conclusion, the TGF-beta 1-induced cellular hypertrophy is caused by both enhanced protein synthesis and reduced protein breakdown. Suppression of cathepsin B and L + B activities mediated probably by an alkalinization in lysosomes is involved in the decreased protein degradation.", 
    "108": "The liver is the major organ involved in the metabolism and elimination of xenobiotics. Evaluating accurately hepatic clearance is very important for predicting the pharmacological effect and/or side-effects of drugs, as well as changes in drug disposition during disease. Recently, for many endogenous and exogenous compounds (including drugs), it has been reported that carrier-mediated transport contributes to hepatic uptake and/or biliary excretion. In particular, primary active transport mechanisms have been shown to be responsible for the biliary excretion of anticancer drugs, endogenous bile acids and organic anions including glutathione and glucuronic acid conjugates. We have found that a rate-limiting step for several drugs in terms of the hepatic clearance was the membrane transport process. For these drugs, such a saturable transport process can be one of the major determinants which influence not only hepatic clearance itself but also disposition (in other words, plasma elimination) in the whole body. We reviewed the carrier-mediated transport mechanisms involved in the hepatic uptake and biliary excretion processes, the multiplicity of transport systems, and further, the physiological meaning of these complex transport systems in the body.", 
    "109": "For the prebypass period various authors have shown that patients on oral or intravenous beta blocking therapy respond to catecholamine treatment with marked increase in afterload and no change in cardiac index. Since positive inotropic therapy is usually not necessary until, but after termination of cardiopulmonary bypass, the question arises as to whether beta-blocking agents administered orally on the morning of the operation, can still have negative effects during this phase of the procedure.", 
    "110": "20 patients (NYHA classification II to III) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, half of them having been on chronic beta-adrenoceptor blocking therapy, were treated with 0.1 micrograms/kg/min adrenaline as an infusion, when following cardiopulmonary bypass cardiac index was < 2.4 l/min/m2 with left and/or right ventricular filling pressures being normal or raised. Haemodynamic monitoring consisted of ECG, direct arterial pressure, a pulmonary artery catheter and of an additional thermodilution catheter placed directly into the coronary sinus. The parameters looked at were mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), total peripheral resistance (TPR), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pressure work index (PWI), myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). Arterial and myocardial lactate levels were measured and from that myocardial lactate extraction and production were calculated. Measurements were made immediately following termination of cardiopulmonary bypass and then after 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes under continuous infusion of adrenaline. In addition left ventricular pressure was measured via transseptal needle for calculation of myocardial contractility dp/dtmax directly after termination of cardiopulmonary bypass and 15 minutes later with adrenaline therapy. Prior to induction of anaesthesia and following termination of cardiopulmonary bypass blood samples were taken to measure plasma levels of the beta blocking drug.", 
    "111": "All 10 patients on oral beta blocking therapy had plasma levels within the therapeutic range prior to induction of anaesthesia. Following cardiopulmonary bypass the plasma levels had fallen by 50% on average, but with 2 exceptions, they were still within the therapeutic range (Table 2). Irrespective of the fact whether preoperatively beta blockers had been taken, adrenaline caused a significant increase in contractility (Table 3), mean arterial pressure (Figure 1), heart rate (Table 3) and cardiac index (Figure 2). There was a comparable increase of pressure work index (Figure 5), myocardial blood flow (Figure 6) and myocardial oxygen consumption (Figure 7) in both groups. Effect on afterload was significantly different. In both groups MAP was increased but that was more marked in the presence of beta blockade (Figure 1). Total peripheral resistance fell in the group without preoperative beta blockade whereas in patients on preoperative beta blockade TPR increased by 100 dyn.s.cm-5 on average (Figure 4). As a consequence adrenaline infusion caused an increase in CPP only in the presence of beta blockade (Figure 3). In both groups adrenaline infusion caused an increase in arterial and myocardial lactate levels (Tables 6 and 7). Some patients without preoperative beta blockade showed myocardial lactate production whereas in the presence of beta blockade myocardial lactate extraction was found at all points of measurement (Figure 8).", 
    "112": "Our results show, that observations made by various groups in the prebypass period on patients treated with beta blocking agents, which demonstrate dramatic increases in afterload with no improvement in cardiac index following catecholamine administration do not hold true for the post-bypass period. The reason could be a wash out effect of the Bretschneider cardioplegia on cardiac beta receptors.",

These changes were independent of heart rate.", 
    "119": "Treatment with low dose sotalol reduces high frequency P wave energy but does not change P wave duration.

The approach used in this study may prove useful for developing new drugs applicable in pain management.", 
    "124": "The effect of cardiovascular drugs on the results of the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SA-ECG) was studied in healthy young subjects. Cardiovascular drugs may confound the analysis of SA-ECG, but the effect of drugs on time-domain analysis and on spectral temporal mapping (STM) in healthy subjects has not been investigated under standardized conditions. Also, the reproducibility of the various spectral area measurements of STM has not been assessed simultaneously. Short-term drug effects on the SA-ECG were studied in 20 healthy young men (age 23.5 +/- 2.5 years) in an observer-blinded, crossover design on separate days. Each subject was randomly assigned to four drugs. The SA-ECG was recorded at baseline and during i.v. administration of stepwise increased doses of adenosine, atropine, isoproterenol, lidocaine, norepinephrine, propranolol, verapamil and placebo. Low amplitude signal duration was significantly and dose-dependently shortened by isoproterenol, whereas no consistent effect on the filtered QRS duration or on the root mean square voltage in the terminal 40 ms of time-domain analysis was noted for any of the other drugs. Only lidocaine significantly and dose-dependently decreased the parameters of STM at QRS offset and +20 ms, even though short-term reproducibility and day-to-day reproducibility of spectral area measurements were low. Interpretation of \"normal\" results from SA-ECG is not relevantly influenced by the studied drugs at clinical doses. STM may prove a useful technique for detection of the actions of sodium channel-blocking drugs. Reproducibility of STM measurements is substantially lower than that of time-domain parameters.", 
    "125": "The objective of this study was to characterize the adenosine receptor (AdoR) antagonistic properties of a newly synthesized alkylxanthine, 1,3-dipropyl-8[2-(5,6-epoxy)norbornyl]xanthine (ENX), and compare them to those of 1,3-dipropyl-8-(cyclo-pentyl)xanthine (CPX), 1,3-dipropyl-8-(3-noradamantyl)xanthine (NAX) and (+/-)-N6-endo-norbornan-2-yl-9-methyladenine (N-0861). The potencies and selectivities of ENX, CPX, NAX and N-0861 were determined by functional studies of guinea pig isolated perfused hearts, and by radioligand binding assays for A1 and A2a AdoRs in the guinea pig forebrain and striatum. ENX competitively antagonized A1 AdoR-mediated prolongations of atrioventricular nodal conduction time caused by Ado or by 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine, but not those caused by carbachol (0.14 microM) or MgCl2 (3 mM). Schild analysis of 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine-antagonist competition curves yielded pA2 values for ENX, CPX and NAX of 8.45 +/- 0.19, 8.55 +/- 0.28 and 8.79 +/- 0.15, respectively. ENX (30 microM) and N-0861 (30 microM) did not attenuate the A2 AdoR-mediated increase in coronary conductance caused by adenosine. CPX and NAX attenuated the coronary vasodilation caused by adenosine with IC50 values of 1.5 and 7.1 microM, respectively. Radioligand binding assays revealed that ENX, CPX and NAX and N-0861 had a 400-, 209-, 110- and 10-fold greater affinity, respectively, for A1 than for A2a AdoRs of guinea pig brain membranes. Thus, ENX was equipotent with CPX and NAX and more potent than N-0861 (pA2 = 6.2) as an antagonist at A1 AdoRs, but had lower affinity for A2 AdoRs in guinea pig hearts and brain striatum than did either CPX or NAX. In DDT1 MF-2 cells, all three alkylxanthines had similar affinities for A1 AdoRs, whereas the affinity of N-0861 for A1 AdoRs was significantly lower. ENX appears to be the most A1 AdoR subtype-selective of the alkylxanthine class of AdoR antagonists reported to date.", 
    "126": "Neurotoxic doses of methamphetamine (METH) can cause hyperthermia in experimental animals. Damage sustained to dopaminergic nerve terminals by this stimulant can be reduced by environmental cooling or by pharmacological manipulation which attenuates the hyperthermia. Many pharmacological agents with very diverse actions protect against METH-induced neuropathology. Several of these compounds, as well as drugs which do not protect, were investigated to determine if there was a relationship between protection and METH-induced hyperthermia. Mice received METH with or without concurrent administration of other drugs and core (i.e., colonic) temperature was monitored during treatment. The animals were sacrificed > or = 5 days later and neostriatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity and dopamine were measured. Core temperature was significantly elevated (> or = 2 degrees C) in mice treated with doses of METH which produced > or = 90% losses in striatal dopamine but not in mice less severally affected (only 50% loss of dopamine). Concurrent treatment of mice with METH and pharmacological agents which protected partially or completely from METH-induced toxicity also prevented the hyperthermic response (i.e., dopamine receptor antagonists, fenfluramine, dizocilpine, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, phenytoin, aminooxyacetic acid and propranol). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the hyperthermia produced by METH contributes to its neuropathology. However, studies with reserpine, a compound which dramatically lowers core temperature, demonstrated that hyperthermia per se is not a requirement for METH-induced neurotoxicity. Although core temperature was elevated in reserpinized mice treated with METH as compared with reserpinized control mice, their temperatures remained significantly lower than in nonreserpinized control mice. However, the hypothermic state produced in the reserpinized mice did not provide protection from METH-induced toxicity. These data demonstrate that hyperthermia per se contributes to but is not solely responsible for the METH-induced neuropathology.",

Patients with normal systolic function were older, were more often women, were less likely to have a history of coronary artery disease, and were more likely to have a history of hypothyroidism than patients with systolic dysfunction. However, the prevalence of clinical characteristics overlapped considerably between the two groups. Among patients with systolic dysfunction, 79% were discharged on a therapeutic regimen of digoxin, 65% on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and 26% on either a beta-blocker or a calcium channel blocker. Among patients with normal systolic function, 50% were discharged on a regimen of a beta-blocker or a calcium channel blocker and 38% were discharged on digoxin. Twenty-six percent of patients with normal systolic function and without a history of atrial fibrillation were discharged on a digoxin regimen.",

    "137": "In most patients with stable angina pectoris, severe eccentric atherosclerotic narrowing of coronary arteries is responsible for chest pain and myocardial ischemia. If myocardial infarction or death occurs, it is usually the consequence of a ruptured plaque. About 10% to 20% of patients with stable angina have normal coronary arteries, and their long-term prognosis is excellent. In patients with angina secondary to atherosclerotic lesions, the annual mortality rate is 1.6% to 3.2%; prognosis is determined by systolic left ventricular function and the extent of coronary artery disease. Patients can be stratified into low- and high-risk groups by medical history, left ventricular function at rest, and results of physical examination and stress testing. Coronary angiography should be reserved for high-risk patients. Risk-factor modification and appropriate use of antianginal drugs are successful in most patients, but those who fail to respond should be considered for angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery; patients with left main coronary artery disease or three-vessel disease and poor left ventricular function should be considered for coronary artery bypass surgery.", 
    "138": "Esophageal and gastric varices develop as a consequence of portal hypertension and advanced chronic liver disease. Bleeding from these varices causes high mortality and morbidity. The exact mechanism leading to rupture of varices is unknown, but portal pressure, intravariceal pressure, and increased variceal wall tension may be factors. Large varices are most likely to bleed, and some studies suggest that red wales on varices may predict bleeding risk. Surgery and endoscopic sclerotherapy are not useful for preventing initial variceal bleeding, but nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking drugs have been shown to be beneficial in primary prophylaxis. Proper selection of patients and careful monitoring of side effects during treatment enhance successful outcomes.", 
    "139": "Acute and chronic exercise decrease peripheral sympathetic nerve activity, but the effect of exercise training of varying intensity on the sympathetic control of heart rate of spontaneously hypertensive rats has not yet been described. The effect of low and high intensities of exercise training on the vagal and sympathetic activities that control heart rate at rest and during dynamic exercise at 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 mph for 4 minutes per stage was investigated in sedentary (SED, n = 11), high-intensity (HT, n = 12), and low-intensity exercise-trained (LT, n = 13) spontaneously hypertensive rats. Exercise training was performed on a treadmill for 60 minutes, 5 days per week for 18 weeks, at 55% maximum oxygen consumption for the LT group and 85% for the HT group. Vagal and sympathetic activities were studied after administration of methylatropine (3 mg/kg) and propranolol (4 mg/kg), respectively. The LT group had a significantly lower heart rate (at 0.5, 0.8, 1.0 mph versus rest: 410 +/- 7, 464 +/- 9, and 295 +/- 6 beats per minute [bpm], respectively) than the HT (440 +/- 6, 453 +/- 7, 474 +/- 5, and 315 +/- 4 bpm) and the SED (474 +/- 11, 500 +/- 11, 523 +/- 10, and 327 +/- 3 bpm) groups. Sympathetic effect (LT: 84 +/- 10, 88 +/- 12, 105 +/- 12, and 9 +/- 4; HT: 123 +/- 8, 125 +/- 7, 133 +/- 7, and 34 +/- 7; SED: 130 +/- 13, 143 +/- 12, 150 +/- 10, and 38 +/- 7 bpm) and sympathetic tonus (LT: 125 +/- 6, 121 +/- 5, 112 +/- 6, and 91 +/- 6; HT: 145 +/- 9, 136 +/- 6, 142 +/- 8, and 118 +/- 7; SED: 136 +/- 6, 129 +/- 6, 132 +/- 7, and 118 +/- 8 bpm) were significantly decreased by low-intensity exercise training. In conclusion, low- but not high-intensity exercise training causes resting bradycardia and attenuation of tachycardiac response during progressive dynamic exercise in spontaneously hypertensive rats. This effect can be attributed to a significantly decreased beta-adrenergic tone that controls heart rate.", 
    "140": "Previous data showed that diabetes induced by streptozotocin for 5 days causes changes in arterial pressure control and baroreflex regulation of heart rate in male Wistar rats. The impairment of baroreflex may be related to autonomic neuropathy as described by several investigators. The aim of this study was to identify autonomic changes in short-term experimental diabetes in rats (induced for 5 days with streptozotocin 65 mg IP). Intra-arterial blood pressure signals were obtained from 6 control group and 7 diabetic group rats and processed in a data acquisition system (CODAS, 1 kHz). Both vagal and sympathetic function were assessed through intravenous injections of methylatropine and propranolol. Streptozotocin induced hyperglycemia (18.9 +/- 1.8 versus 5.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/L) and reductions in mean arterial pressure (102 +/- 2 versus 117 +/- 3 mm Hg) and resting heart rate (298 +/- 14 versus 332 +/- 2 beats per minute). Sodium and potassium levels were not different between groups. The intrinsic heart rate was reduced in the diabetic group (302 +/- 10 versus 398 +/- 6 beats per minute). This group also exhibited depressed vagal and sympathetic tone (50% and 22%, respectively), reduction of vagal effect (42%), and no change in sympathetic effect. In conclusion, early autonomic dysfunction in short-term streptozotocin-induced diabetes seems to be related to changes in arterial pressure and baroreflex control."
