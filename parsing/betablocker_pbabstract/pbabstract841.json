Effects of inhibitors of DOPA decarboxylase, dopamine beta-hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase, and haloperiodol on the secretion of pancreatic juice induced by L-DOPA and dopamine were studied in preparations of the isolated blood-perfused canine pancreas.2. The increased secretion induced by the infusion of L-DOPA (100 mug/min) was completely antagonized by Ro 4-4602 (300 mug), a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor.3. The secretogogue effect of dopamine (1-10 mug) intra-arterially was not affected by Ro 4-4602, but was enhanced by the infusion of fusaric acid (100 mug/min), a dopamine beta-hydroxylase inhibitor.4. The increase in the secretion induced by dopamine (1-10 mug) was enhanced by treatment with nialamide (100 mg/kg), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, given intravenously.5. Haloperidol (1 mg) intra-arterially attenuated the dopamine-induced pancreatic secretion.6. It is concluded that L-DOPA is converted to dopamine in the acinar cells which causes an increase in the secretion of pancreatic juice, thus the intracellular level of dopamine may be controlled by enzymatic equilibrium.", 
    "1": "1. Caffeine, 0.6-20.0 mM, altered the duration of the action potential recorded from kitten papillary muscles; low concentrations shortened and high concentrations prolonged the action potential.2. Caffeine, 20 mM, prolonged the action potential by delaying the final phase of repolarization.3. Caffeine, 2.0-20.0 mM increased the tension developed and the duration of the isometric contraction.4. When large stimulating electrodes were used, all concentrations of caffeine increased the duration of the action potential; this effect was probably due to the interactions of caffeine and released endogenous catecholamines.5. Concentrations of caffeine and isoprenaline, which separately caused little change in the duration of the action potential, greatly prolonged the action potential when used together.6. The effects of caffeine may be due to an increase in membrane calcium current in addition to an action on intracellular calcium stores.", 
    "2": "Both at rest and during transmural stimulation acetylcholine output from isolated longitudinal and circular muscle strips is significantly higher in the spastic segment than in the proximal dilated bowel. No difference has been found in the tissue concentration of acetylcholine between ganglionic and aganglionic specimens. The pattern of response to transmural stimulation is also similar in the spastic and dilated bowel. However, after cholinergic and adrenergic blockade transmural stimulation fails to induce relaxation in aganglionic specimens, as it does in normal colon. The hypotheses are advanced that the increase in acetylcholine output may be partly dependent on a failure of the intrinsic modulating mechanisms and that an alteration of the non-adrenergic inhibitory neurons may be involved in the motor disturbances of the aganglionic tract.", 
    "3": "Studies were performed to define the mechanisms involved in the redistribution of renal cortical blood flow to inner cortical nephrons which occurs during hemorrhagic hypotension in the dog. The radioactive microsphere method was utilized to measure regional blood flow in the renal cortex. Renal nerve stimulation decreased renal blood flow 40% but had no effect on the fractional distribution of cortical blood flow. Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine, propranolol, or atropine did not alter the redistribution of cortical flow during hemorrhage. A reduction in renal perfusion pressure by aortic constriction caused a qualitatively similar alteration in regional blood flow distribution as occurred during hemorrhage. When perfusion pressure was kept constant in one kidney by aortic constriction followed by hemorrhage, no redistribution occurred in the kidney with a constant perfusion pressure while the contralateral kidney with the normal perfusion pressure before hemorrhage had a marked increase in the fractional distribution of cortical flow to inner cortical nephrons. Additionally, retransfusion had no effect on the fractional distribution of flow in the kidney in which perfusion pressure was maintained at the same level as during hemorrhage while in the contralateral kidney in which pressure increased to normal there was a redistribution of flow to outer cortical nephrons. These studies indicate that the redistribution of renal cortical blood flow which occurs during hemorrhage is not related to changes in adrenergic activity but rather to the intrarenal alterations which attend a diminution in perfusion pressure.", 
    "4": "The purpose of this study was to determine the physiological mechanism of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. Circular muscle of the esophagus, LES, and stomach were evaluated for their inhibitory response to electrical stimulation during a maintained tonic contraction produced by a superfusion of acetylcholine and physostigmine. Only the circular muscle of the distal esophagus showed an inhibitory response to electrical stimulation. The maximal inhibition of LES muscle was 63.9+/-5.9 (mean+/-SE)% of the acetylcholine produced tension and occurred at 80 V. Upper esophageal and gastric muscle were not inhibited. The inhibitory response of the LES muscle was antagonized by tetrodotoxin and hexamethonium but not by other specific antagonists. Adrenergic nerve destruction following 6-hydroxydopamine also did not abolish the LES inhibition. These data indicate that the distal esophagus, at the zone of the manometrically determined LES, is characterized by a nonadrenergic neural inhibitory system. We suggest that these nerves may mediate LES relaxation."
