    "0": "To determine whether vagal activity during myocardial ischemia functions to stabilize the heart, the left anterior descending coronary artery in dogs was occluded for periods of 3 1/2 minutes with and without concurrent vagal stimulation. Bipolar electrograms were measured from the surface of the canine left ventricle within and outside the regions of intended ischemia. Ischemia in the absence of vagal stimulation depressed both the electrogram amplitude and the upstroke velocity of the electrogram signal. Vagal stimulation significantly decreased the absolute magnitude of the ischemia-induced decrease of the electrogram signal, which indicates that it tended to stabilize the insulted heart. This stabilizing influence however, was seen only in the presence of adrenergic blockade with practolol. The vagal response was only partially blocked by atropine, whereas it was abolished by lidocaine. These results suggest that a vagally mediated stabilization of the ischemic canine ventricle can occur and is unmasked only in the absence of sympathetic neural activity.", 
    "1": "In 101 hypertensive gravidae the selective beta-blocking agent metoprolol alone or in combination with hydralazine has been used. The effects of the mother and fetus have been compared with those of 97 hypertensive gravidae treated with hydralazine. In both groups a small dose of a thiazide was added. Perinatal mortality was lower in the metoprolol group (2.0%) than in the hydralazine group (8.0%). The rate of fetal growth retardations also was lower when using metoprolol (11.7 and 16.3% respectively). No abnormal effects of the beta-blocker was noticed on the fetus.", 
    "2": "The respiratory stimulant doxapram hydrochloride has long been shunned in the United States because of a perpetuated fear of the alleged side effects of hypertension and tachycardia with attendant hypermetabolism and increased oxygen consumption. This study reports the results of the administration of doxapram alone, and of doxapram in conjunction with the beta-blocker propranolol on the blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate of 12 healthy unanesthetized volunteer subjects. Results showed an augmentation in blood pressure (especially diastolic), a significant decrease in heart rate, and an unexpected actual increase in respiratory rate in the doxapram/propranolol group. Subtleties of sympathetic balance, as well as proposed future studies are discussed.", 
    "3": "The hemodynamic mechanism of the hypotensive effect of propranolol was studied by quantitative radiocardiography in 8 patients with dialysis-resistant hypertension. Propranolol treatment brought about a decrease in mean arterial pressure and peripheral vascular resistances. The cardiac index was slightly reduced only in the early stage of the treatment. No significant difference was found between patients on treatments lasting longer than 3 months and patients with dialysis-controlled hypertension. The results show that propranolol can be used safely as the sole antihypertensive agent in patients with dialysis-resistant hypertension.", 
    "4": "The effects of catecholamines on the circular muscle of myometria in pregnant rats at term (21st and 22nd days) were investigated by recording electrical and mechanical responses. Slow potentials were found to be the dominant activity in the morning on the 21st day of pregnancy, and spike potentials were manifested on the 22nd day. The alpha-excitation of catecholamines in the circular muscle was represented by mechanical potentiation, prolongation of the slow potential and depolarization of the membrane. In contrast, the beta-inhibition was mechanical inhibition, depression of the slow potential and hyperpolarization. Noradrenaline at a concentration of 6 X 10(-6M caused excitatory action in the circular muscle on the 21st day of pregnancy, while the effect became inhibitory on the 22nd day of pregnancy. Results obtained by the use of adrenergic agonists and antagonists led to the conclusion that the reversal of the effect of noradrenaline could be ascribed largely to the enhancement of the beta-action, the mechanism of which was brought about probably through the endogenous change in the steroid hormone secretion at the very end of pregnancy.", 
    "5": "The blood pressure responses following infusions of angiotensin II (ANG II) into the brain ventricles (i.v.t.) have been tested in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats and in normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WK) rats. The mean arterial blood pressure increases were significantly higher in SH rats than in WK rats. Propranolol treatment reduced blood pressure increases to i.v.t. ANG II in WK, but not in SH rats. The higher sensitivity to i.v.t. ANG II in SH rats supports a role of central ANG II in the maintenance of high blood pressure in SH rats.", 
    "6": "The haemodynamic effects produced by intravenous infusions of the beta-blocking agents metoprolol and propranolol in doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/10 min were compared in anaesthetized dogs. When administered in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/10 min, metoprolol caused a longer-lasting increase in pulmonary-arterial pressure and total pulmonary resistance, a greater increase in pulmonary capillary pressure and a more marked decrease in O2 partial pressure in the arterial blood than propranolol. These differences are probably due to differences in the pharmacokinetics of the two drugs. The effects of the two beta-blockers in a dose of 1 mg/kg/10 min were similar. At neither of the dose-levels tested were the changes induced by the compounds in the various parameters studied clearly dose-related.", 
    "7": "The effects of three concentrations of halothane or ketamine were investigated on isolated rabbit hearts, which were perfused with hydralazine, clonidine, propranolol or methyldopa. In hearts not subjected to the influence of an anaesthetic, clonidine was the only drug stimulating myocardial function. In those perfused with halothane or ketamine alone, both anaesthetics exerted a negative chronotropic and inotropic action in a dose-related manner. Ketamine markedly increased the coronary flow. Clonidine distinctly reduced the myocardial depression caused by halothane or ketamine. Hydralazine had no marked effects with either of these anaesthetics, except that it sensitized the hearts to the arrhythmic action of a high concentration of halothane. Propranolol, when combined with halothane, aggravated myocardial depression and decreased coronary flow. With ketamine, propranolol caused no other harmful interactions, apart from inhibiting the increase in coronary flow caused by this anaesthetic. Methyldopa intensified the myocardial depression induced by halothane, but tended to diminish that caused by ketamine. The results suggest that clonidine has a stimulatory cardiac action when combined with either of these anaesthetics. Disadvantageous interactions may exist between methyldopa or propranolol and halothane.", 
    "8": "The effects of hydralazine, clonidine, propranolol and methyldopa medications on the cardiovascular response to ketamine anaesthesia were studied in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. Except in propranolol- and methyldopa-treated animals, blood pressure was increased by ketamine in all groups. The heart rate was increased only in the normotensive control rats, whereas it was reduced in both the unmedicated and all of the medicated SH rats. Plasma renin activity under ketamine anaesthesia was markedly higher in normotensive control rats than in any of the SH groups. The pressor responses to dopamine and metaraminol were not altered by propranolol medication, but hydralazine suppressed these responses, while they were markedly intensified by clonidine and methyldopa treatment. Similarly, small additional doses of ketamine caused a pressor response only in clonidine- and methyldopa-treated animals, whereas in the other groups the response was depressive. The tolerance to haemorrhagic shock during ketamine anaesthesia was notably improved by hydralazine and methyldopa medication, but impaired by propranolol treatment. The results suggest that, with special reference to shock tolerance, hydralazine and methyldopa, and to a lesser extent also clonidine, have a favourable effect on the circulation under ketamine anaesthesia, whereas the action of beta-blockade may be harmful.", 
    "9": "The Vo2, VCO2, RQ, blood flow and developed tension of in situ dog gastrocnemius muscle were studied during contractions at 2.5 tw/sec for both normoxic and hyperoxic breathing conditions. Vo2 and developed tension were not significantly altered by the breathing gas changes. CaO2 rose by 11% during O2-breathing, however, a significant decrease of 15% in muscle blood flow resulted in no significant change in O2-transport (CaO2 X Q) to muscle comparing hyperoxia to normoxia. Hyperoxia resulted in a significant decrease in muscle VCO2 and RQ. The cause of the RQ change with breathing gas O2 content is not certain, however, evidence is presented indicating that infused epinephrine and propranolol can effect the response.", 
    "10": "Sixty-two patients with hypertension who were treated with a free combination of Slow Trasicor or Trasicor and Navidrex K were transferred to a fixed combination tablet, Trasidrex (slow oxprenolol 160 mg + cyclopenthiazide 0.25 mg). Blood pressure control was marginally improved and there was no increase in side-effects.", 
    "11": "The activity of hexobarbital metabolising enzymes of the liver is decreased as a consequence of both acute and chronical carbon tetrachloride damage. Simultaneous administration of estrogens was followed by more severe morphological and functional impairment although estrogens are not burdening the healthy liver. The beta receptor blocking propranolol prevented functional lesion, moderated fatty degeneration and liver cell necrosis in chronic carbon tetrachloride injury. A simultaneous estrogen administration decreased the therapeutic efficacy of beta blockade, however functional and morphological protective effects were not completely abolished. Estrogen medication should be rather avoided in hepatic damage.", 
    "12": "15 patients who had benign, uncomplicated essential hypertension, were treated with chlorthiazide (500 mg twice a day) with or without propranolol (10--20 mg 4 times a day), and the effect of the treatment on plasma renin activity (PRA), urinary aldosterone excretion, total body potassium (TBK) and plasma sodium and potassium was evaluated. TBK depletion was significant mathematically (more than 5% of TBK lost) in 7 patients, but not significant physiologically (less than 15% of TBK lost) in any except in one, who may have had other reason for TBK depletion. Although propranolol prevented the increase in PRA and aldosterone excretion, it did not prevent the modest TBK depletion. Dietary potassium intake may have some importance in the maintenance of normal body potassium during chronic treatment with thiazides for hypertension.", 
    "13": "An open study was carried out in general practice to assess the effectiveness and tolerance of labetalol in the treatment of 53 difficult hypertensive patients, most of whom had failed to respond to previous hypotensive therapy. The results showed that in the 49 patients receiving treatment for more than 3 months good blood pressure control was readily achieved, and with labetalol alone in all but 6 of them. The majority were controlled on doses ranging from 300 to 600 mg per day. Treatment was discontinued in 3 patients because of severe side-effects. Mild, tolerable side-effects, similar to those found with beta-adrenergic blocking agents, were reported by 35 patients.", 
    "14": "To determine quantitatively organ blood flow distribution as the result of lifelong beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, 23 and 24 normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats, respectively, were treated from conception with tap water (control; 10 WKY and 8 SHR), propranolol (0.5 mg/ml drinking water; 6 WKY and 8 SHR), or timolol (0.5 mg/ml drinking water; 7 WKY and 8 SHR) via placental circulation, mothers' milk, and drinking water. At 12 weeks of age all six groups were studied hemodynamically under ether anesthesia using an electromagnetic flowmeter and radioactive carbonized (15 micrometer) microspheres. Untreated SHR demonstrated normal cardiac output (CO) and CO distribution to all organs except for myocardium and testes, thereby confirming our previous work. With either propranolol or timolol treatment the course of development and maintenance of arterial pressure was no different than the pure-tap-water-fed WKY and SHR despite an approximate 30% reduction in CO. Further, with both beta-receptor antagonists CO distribution was significantly reduced to skeletal muscle (p less than 0.001), unchanged to the heart, and increased (p less than 0.05) to the remaining organs (including kidneys and brain) in both groups. Thus, as a result of lifelong beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, CO was reduced; and this was associated with a redistribution of blood flow so that flow to the kidney, brain, and splanchnic organs could be maintained at the expense of skeletal muslce perfusion.", 
    "15": "Cardiac rate (CR) and systolic arterial blood pressure (ABP) response to the intravenous injection of one, two, or three mg propranolol were recorded in 77 patients with traumatic, neoplastic, or haemorrhagic intracranial lesions and sinus tachycardia. In most patients tachycardia occurred with no cause except the intracranial lesion; in the other patients induction of general anaesthesia or surgical procedures on the brain appeared to have an initiating role. A central imbalance, with increased sympathetic cardiotropic influences is suggested and discussed. (I) First administrations of propranolol always reduced CR but had different effects on ABP from case to case; in all the patients 2.05 +/- 0.84 mg of drug lowered CR by 28 +/- 14/min (P less than 0.01), and ABP by 4.7 +/- 11 torr. CR decrease and ABP changes were without relation to the injected dose. Previous digitalization (desacetyllanatoside C) did not modify CR response to propranolol but reduced (P less than 0.05) its arterial hypotensive action. Positive correlations were found between basal CR and CR decrease (P less than 0.01), basal CR and ABP changes (P less than 0.01), CR decrease and ABP changes (P less than 0.05). Halothane appeared to potentiate CR response (P less than 0.01). (II) CR effect was less when the same dose of propranolol was repeated within 90 min (P less than or equal to 0.05). Usefulness and the mode of use of propranolol were critically evaluated.", 
    "16": "The mechanism of hyperglycemia produced by L-dopa was studied in normal trained dogs with 3-3H-glucose infusion to measure rates of hepatic glucose output (production) and overall glucose uptake (utilization). Infusion of L-dopa (20 mg/kg/h) increased glucose production causing hyperglycemia. Despite the hyperglycemia plasma insulin did not increase nor did glucose uptake, indicating a relative inhibition of glucose utilization. These effects resemble those produced by epinephrine infusion. Pretreatment with a decarboxylase inhibitor, carbidopa, prevented the L-dopa effect to increase glucose production and no hyperglycemia occurred. Hyperglycemia was not prevented by pimozide, a dopamine receptor blocker, nor by propranolol but was prevented by phentolamine. L-Dopa also increased plasma growth hormone levels without affecting plasma cortisol. The effect on growth hormone was prevented by carbidopa and by phentolamine but not by pimozide; propranolol potentiated the rise in growth hormone. The data suggest that the L-dopa-induced hyperglycemia is due to a peripheral action, whereas stimulation of growth hormone secretion may be due to a central action of a L-dopa metabolite.", 
    "17": "This investigation was undertaken to clarify the lipolytic response caused by K+ and norepinephrine in brown adipose tissues. 1. Lipolytic response was obviously observed at the concentration of 50 mM in the K+-induced stimulation, and at 1.0 microgram/ml in the norepinephrine-induced stimulation, respectively. 2. K+- and norepinephrine-stimulated lipolysis were inhibited in the Ca2+-deficient tissues, and were inhibited by the addition of Mg2+, Mn2+ and La3+. 3. In the K+-stimulated lipolysis Ca2+ could be substituted only by Sr2+, while in the norepinephrine-stimulated lipolysis the substitution was possible with both Sr2+ and Ba2+. 4. K+- and norepinephrine-stimulated lipolysis were inhibited by the addition of propranolol and procaine. Accordingly, these positive results suggest that K+- and norepinephrine-stimulated lipolysis are dependent on the presence of Ca2+, and are related to the movements of Ca2+ and cyclic AMP system in the cells.", 
    "18": "The cardiovascular responses to autonomic blockade were investigated in 15 late-gestation fetal lambs in utero. 4 animals had normal brains and 11 had hydranencephalic-like cerebral injury secondary to bilateral carotid artery obstruction (BCO). Following atropine administration, heart rate increased only 0.7 +/- 0.7% in the BCO lambs compared to 25.7 +/- 5.2% in the controls. alpha-Blockade with phentolamine resulted in a small decrease in systolic (2.2 +/- 0.8%) and diastolic (1.8 +/- 1.4%) blood pressure, and beta-blockade with propranolol produced a small decrease in heart rate (2.5 +/- 0.8%) as compared to control fetuses. Post mortem examination revealed extensive destruction of the cerebrum but normal hypothalamus and brain stem. These data suggest that supramedullary modification of autonomic cardiovascular control involves the cerebrum.", 
    "19": "Hemodynamic changes were studied in ten patients with uncomplicated transmural myocardial infection during 24 hours on beta-blockade. The cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking drug metoprolol was injected (15 mg i.v.) within the first 24 hours after onset of chest pain and was followed by oral therapy (25-50 mg at 6-hour intervals). There was a decrease in heart rate, systolic BP, and cardiac output, which was most marked after the injection. The stroke volume and diastolic BP for the whole group of patients remained unchanged. The pulmonary artery end diastolic pressure did not change significantly after the injection but a continuous fall was obtained in three out of four patients with initially elevated values. The preejection period, measured from the ECG and carotid pressure curve, as initially short and was prolonged in all patients after administration of the beta-blocking drug. It is concluded that the cardioselective beta-blocking drug metoprolol may be used in selected patients in the acute phase of myocardial infarction without danger of hemodynamic deterioration during the first 24 hours of therapy. The selection of patients can be based on clinical criteria. In this study signs of left heart failure, hypotension, poor peripheral circulation, bradycardia, and AV block were regarded as contraindications.", 
    "20": "Excretion of lithium in urine was studied in 2 healthy males while recumbent and while upright, either walking or standing quietly. An oral dose of 24.3 mmol of Lit was taken as three lithium carbonate tablets 13 h before clearance tests. Renal lithium clearance decreased and lithium fractional reabsorption increased while upright. Standing immersed to the neck in water, which prevents the fall in plasma volume upon changing posture from recumbent to upright, prevented the fall in renal lithium clearance as well as the rise in lithium fractional reabsorption while upright. Oral doses of guanethidine (total dose of 200 mg) or oxprenolol (total dose of 140 mg) taken to prevent high levels of sympathetic nervous system activity and plasma renin, respectively, failed to prevent the fall in renal lithium clearance or the rise in lithium fractional reabsorption upon changing posture from recumbent to upright. The findings indicate that the fall in renal lithium clearance and the rise in lithium fractional reabsorption upon changing posture from recumbent to upright is related to the fall in plasma volume but not to high levels of sympathetic nervous system activity or plasma renin activity.", 
    "21": "We studied the effect of catecholamines on the adenylate cyclase activity of myogenic cells of the L6 line during the differentiation process. The enzyme of mononucleated myoblasts was found to be activated by adrenaline L, noradrenaline L, and to a small extent, by adrenaline D and dihydrocymandelic acid. The adenylate cyclase of the differentiated cells responded to adrenaline L and noradrenaline L but not to adrenaline D or dihydroxymandelic acid. This activation could be inhibited by the addition of DOPA and propranolol, a specific beta adrenergic blocker. alpha adrenergic compounds such as phentolamine did not have any effect. It is concluded that beta adrenergic receptors are present on myogenic cells before and after differentiation.", 
    "22": "The effect of propranolol (40 mg t.d.s.) on the peripheral levels of T4, T3 and reverse-T3 was studied in 26 patients with hyperthyroidism. The compounds were measured by specific radioimmunoassay techniques. The levels were followed for five weeks and compared with the levels before treatment. The results show that propranolol had no significant effect on the peripheral levels of T4 despite a rapid amelioration of clinical symptoms. A significant reduction of T3 levels was obtained during the first to fourth week of treatment. No significant decrease was obtained after the fourth week. A significant elevation in reverse-T3 levels was obtained during the second to fourth week of treatment. No significant change was obtained either during the first week or after the fourth week. Inconsistent fluctuations in hormone levels, both before and during treatment, could be seen in individual cases. The results suggest that the reduction of clinical symptoms must be caused by an extrathyroidal action of propranolol which does not seem to involve the pituitary gland.", 
    "23": "Cardiovascular adaptation to the sudden inflation of a balloon in the descending aorta was investigated in intact awake, standing dogs. The balloon inflation raised pressure in the arterial bed proximal from the balloon. Initially, it lowered heart rate and cardiac output. After 4 sec, heart rate and cardiac output began increasing again and within the next 14 sec, these functions returned almost to the control values. The restoration of cardiac output was associated with a further rise in aortic pressure. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the prime circulatory adaptation to a hindrance to arterial flow is restoration of blood flow even though this requires a further elevation of arterial pressure. The demands of the tissues for an adequate supply of blood appear to override the inhibitory baroreceptor reflexes. The circulatory changes observed under conditions of attenuated parasympathetic inhibition and under conditions of attenuated beta-adrenergic stimulation were consistent with this interpretation. The findings suggest that arterial hyertension may involve a comparable adaptation of cardiac output in patients whose blood flow is hindered by pathologically narrowed arterioles.", 
    "24": "The vasomotor response of dopamine and dopaminergic agonists was studies on feline isolated middle cerebral arteries in vitro and pial arterioles in situ following microapplication. The action of various inhibitors was tested to define the receptors involved. The contractile response could be blocked by alpha-receptor as well as serotonin receptor antagonists. The mode of inhibition suggested that serotonin receptors rather than alpha-adrenoceptors mediated the dopamine-induced contraction. A dose-dependent dilation could be evoked by the dopaminergic agonists on actively contracting pial arteries in vitro and by apomorphine in situ. The relative potency for the agonists together with blocking experiments indicated that the vasodilation was mediated by specific dopamine receptors.", 
    "25": "Blood samples were taken every 5 min for a 3-h period from ovariectomized (OVX) adult rats bearing chronic venous catheters. After 1 h of sampling, an experimental drug was injected through the sampling catheter. The neuroleptics, chlorpromazine and haloperidol, blocked pulsatile discharges of luteinizing hormone (LH) in some animals, for periods of 65-120 min, as did the alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers, phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine. Pimozide, a more specific dopaminergic blocking agent, had less effect, while neither the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, propranolol, nor the control treatments had any influence on the pulsatile LH patterns. The temporal pattern of inhibition of pulsatile discharges of LH by these drugs is more rapid than the inhibition caused by estrogen treatment in the OVX rat. These results suggest the presence of alpha, but not beta, adrenergic elements in the pulsatile mode of LH release in the OVX rat. They do not support the presence of dopaminergic elements, but neither do they conclusively deny it.", 
    "26": "The ambulatory management of hypertension is relatively simple. A key factor in the success of any program is motivation of both the physician and the patient. Workup should be limited to a few simple tests as outlined; need rarely, if ever, involve hospitalization; and can be completed in one or two office or clinic visits. Treatment of hypertion over a long-term period involves the use of specific drug therapy, although some slight modification of lifestyle or diet is occasionally helpful. There are numerous drugs available, and in over 80 to 85 percent of cases, an effective combination can be found. Drug therapy must be continuous; it is rare, in our experience, that medication can be completely discontinued. Data available from the Veterans Administration study, as well as my own, clearly indicate that effective lowering of blood pressure over a long period of time is cost-effective and delays or prevents numerous complications that are frequently noted in untreated patients.", 
    "27": "In 16 patients with hypertension, BP could not be controlled satisfactorily by treatment with propranolol alone (mean dosage 325 mg/day). Plasma volume (PV) (T-1824) and extracellular fluid volume (ECV) (82Br-distribution space) were determined in these patients before and after the addition of hydralazine for three months (mean dosage 135 mg/day). After the addition of hydralazine, PV and ECV increased significantly, by 9% and 3%, respectively. Systolic and diastolic BPs decreased, by 15% and 13%. The mechanisms inducing fluid retention during treatment with hydralazine and the clinical significance of the problem are discussed. It is concluded that the addition of a diuretic to propranolol-hydralazine treatment is often well indicated.", 
    "28": "Adrenergic (alpha and beta), cholinergic (m and n) and gabanergic (gamma) influences on the regulation of basal hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenocortical (HHA) activity, as assessed by plasma cortisol levels, were investigated in non-stressed conscious cats. Alterations in neurotransmitter activities were induced by perfusing the cerebroventricles for 60 min with mock cerebrospinal fluid containing alpha, beta, m, n and gamma antagonists given along or in various combinations. Neither gamma, m nor n blockers altered basal HHA activity, whereas both alpha and beta blockers given alone or together, or combined with m, n and gamma blockers markedly elevated plasma cortisol. These responses were inhibited by the addition of dexamethasone to the perfusion fluid. These data suggest that basal HHA activity in the cat is maintained by a central inhibitory action of the adrenergic system on spontaneously discharging corticotropin-releasing factor neurons, and not via an adrenergic-cholinergic-gabanergic neural chain.", 
    "29": "The role of autonomic nervous system and non-autonomic components in hemodynamic abnormalities of young patients with borderline hypertension was examined by comparing the effects of sequential pharmacological autonomic blockade on hemodynamics between 8 patients with borderline hypertension (mean age 20.0 +/- 0.2) and 10 normotensive subjects (mean age 19.3 +/- 0.2). Propranolol (0.2 mg/Kg), atropine (0.04 mg/Kg), and phenotolamine (10 or 15 mg) were given intravenously in that order to produce \"total\" autonomic blockade. Increased cardiac index, heart rate, and mean arterial blood pressure with normal peripheral vascular resistance were noted at rest in patients with borderline hypertension. Cardiac index and heart rate in patients with borderline hypertension were normalized by propranolol, but after \"total\" autonomic blockade mean arterial blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance were higher in patients with borderline hypertension as compared to those in normotensive subjects. These results suggest that, although autonomic nervous system control of circulation is abnormal, non-autonomic components play an important role in maintaining increased peripheral vascular resistance in borderline hypertension in young men.", 
    "30": "Effects of propranolol (10(-9) to 10(-4) Gm/ml) on various electrophysiologic properties of human papillary muscles obtained from patients undergoing corrective open heart surgery were studied to have an insight into the mechanism of its antiarrhythmic activity in man. Propranolol (10(-8) to 10(-6) Gm/ml) produced significant decreases in the action potential duration, effective refractory period and dv/dt of depolarization phase of action potential without significantly affecting the resting potential and amplitude of action potential. These effects were concentration dependent. High concentration (10(-4) Gm/ml) of propranolol not only produced greater decreases in the above parameters but also reduced the resting potential and amplitude of action potential. Although propranolol decreased both the action potential duration and effective refractory period, the shortening of the action potential duration was greater than the shortening of the effective refractory period. It shifted the membrane responsiveness curve to the right and down. It produced frequency dependent decreases in the dv/dt of phase 0 of action potential and the rate of repolarization. Propranolol also increased the threshold of stimulation. Propranolol produced electrophysiologic changes in the human myocardium qualitatively similar to those in canine myocardium. The probable mechanism of its antiarrhythmic activity in man has been discussed.", 
    "31": "In an open dose titration study we evaluated the antihypertensive effect of the concomitant administration of timolol and hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride, administered on a b.i.d. basis. Twenty-eight out of 39 patients completed the study. Supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulse rate were significantly lower at the end of the titration period than at the end of the diuretic period.", 
    "32": "The inotropic responsiveness of the developing myocardium to dopamine and isoproterenol was evaluated using isolated, perfused ventricles and atrial strips from puppies ages 15 hr to 33 days. Responses were compared to those in adult animals. The maximum percentage of increase of left ventricular dF/dt increased from 12 +/- 5 (mean +/- SEM) at 0-7 days (n = 6) to 100 +/- 40 at 21-33 days (n = 3) of postnatal age. At 7-14 days (n = 4) and 15-20 days (n = 5) of age the maximum percentage of increase of left ventricular dF/dt was 28 +/- 10 and 39 +/- 17, respectively. Puppy ventricle responded to isoproterenol at all ages equally (maximum percentage increase of left ventricular dF/dt = 46 +/- 13). Atrial muscle strips from puppies, ages 15 hr to 35 days (n = 22), and adult dogs (n = 19) demonstrated equal responsiveness to dopamine as well as to isoproterenol. The maximum percentage of increase of dF/dt was 117 +/- 18 with dopamine. Maximum percentage of increase of dF/dt with dopamine after propranolol (10(-7) M) was 52 +/- 18. Haloperidol (1.10(-7)-2.10(-6) M) did not alter responsiveness of atria to dopamine.", 
    "33": "The interrelationship between drug-induced changes in heart rate and drug-induced alterations in ventricular automaticity was studied in dogs with intact conduction systems and dogs with surgically-induced complete heart block. The effects of epinephrine (0.5 microgram-kg-1-min-1) and propranolol (1.0 mg-kg-1) on ventricular automaticity were shown to be partially concealed by heart rate changes produced by these agents. Partial concealment of ventricular automaticity changes was shown to result from an alteration in the degree of overdrive suppression secondary to rate changes. Changes in the degree of overdrive suppression have a masking effect on drug-induced alterations in ventricular automaticity and only when the degree of suppression was held constant could the full extent of drug effects on ventricular automaticity be determined. Following vagal stimulation or rapid pacing, the rate of recovery from overdrive suppression as measured by the number of ventricular beats in 30 s was shown to be a dependable index of ventricular automaticity. It was concluded that determinations of drug effects on ventricular automaticity should take into account changes in heart rate produced by the drug. A method for determining ventricular automaticity is described which matches overdrive suppression during the control period to that during drug action in order to cancel out the influence of changes in heart rate on ventricular automaticity.", 
    "34": "Isoproterenol (0.1-500 mg/kg) decreased the myocardial creatine kinase (CK) activity in rats. The maximum effect was already reached with 10 mg/kg, decreasing the enzyme activity to 58.5% of the control values. The beta-blocking agents propranolol and practolol, and also glucocorticosteroids inhibited the isoproterenol effect. The relative CK isoenzyme composition of the myocardium was not grossly altered by isoproterenol, as shown by DEAE-Sephadex A-50 macrocolumn chromatography. --Serum CK was increased significantly after the administration of the excessive dose of 500 mg isoproterenol/kg.", 
    "35": "The objective of this investigation was to determine whether or not autonomic receptors are involved in the chronotropic responses to 1-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) and congeners (1-alpha-acetylnormethadol, norLAAM; 1-alpha-acetyldinormethadol, dinorLAAM). The effects of atropine were studied in vitro using isolated guinea-pig right atria and in vivo in anesthetized dogs. The effect of d,l-propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent was studied in vitro only. Atropine attenuated, but did not block completely, the negative chronotropic responses to the narcotic agonists. Propranolol blocked completely the positive chronotropic response to norLAAM and appeared to increase the negative chronotropic response to dinorLAAM. It is concluded that: 1) muscarinic cholinergic receptors play a role in the negative chronotropic response; 2) the positive chronotropic response to norLAAM involves activation of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "36": "The effects of hydralazine, clonidine, propranolol and methyldopa medication on the control of the circulatory system during halothane anaesthesia were studied in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. Special attention was directed to the problem of circulatory emergencies. Under 1 and 3% halothane anaesthesia, the mean arterial pressure was lowest in methyldopa-treated rats. During 3% anaesthesia, plasma renin activity was markedly increased in the methyldopa group and decreased in the propranolol group. Hydralazine medication suppressed the pressor responses to dopamine and metaraminol, whereas clonidine, propranolol and methylopa increased the response to dopamine. These sympathetic agents induced more cardiac arrhythmias in SH controls than in normotensive ones. These arrhythmias were antagonized by hydralazine. The SH controls also tolerated haemorrhagic shock more poorly than did normotensive control rats. Among the pretreated animals, tolerance to this shock was highest in hydralazine-and clonidine-treated animals and lowest in the methyldopa group. The results suggest that during halothane anaesthesia SH rats are more prone to disturbances in the control of circulation than are normotensive controls. Hydralazine and, to a lesser extent, clonidine have a protective action against these disturbances, but the effect of methyldopa seems to be disadvantageous.", 
    "37": "To twenty six patients with angina at rest (including 13 patients with Prinzmetal's variant angina), propranolol 40--50 mg, dilitiazem 60--90 mg, dipyridamole 50 mg, atropine sulfate 0.6 mg and phenoxybenzamine 10--20 mg were given at 9:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. (except phenoxybenzamine which was given only at 9:00 p.m.) to examine the effect of these drugs on the attack. Propranolol was not only ineffective in suppressing the attack but rather tended to aggravate it in all the cases of Prinzmetal's variant angina. It was effective to some degree in 5 of 13 cases of angina at rest other than Prinzmetal's variant angina. Diltiazem suppressed the attack completely and dramatically in all the cases of angina at rest (including Prinzmetal's variant angina). Dipyridamole was ineffective in all the cases except one in suppressing the attack. Atropine sulfate and phenoxybenzamine suppressed the attack in 13 of 21 cases and in 6 of 12 cases respectively. Coronary arteriography was done before and after the intravenous administration of 10 mg of diltiazem in 8 patients and it was demonstrated that diltiazem dilates large coronary arteries in all these patients. It is concluded that diltiazem, a calcium antagonistic drug, is specifically effective in suppressing the attack of angina at rest by dilating large coronary arteries and that the autonomic nervous system plays a role in the genesis of the attack probably by constricting large coronary arteries by way of alpha adrenergic receptors.", 
    "38": "The effect of antikaliuretic agents (spironolactone, amiloride) and antiprostaglandin agents (indomethacin, ibuprofen) on plasma renin activity and potassium metabolism was studied in a patient with familial Bartter's syndrome. The decrease in renal potassium clearance in response to antikaliuretic treatment was only of a temporary nature, in contrast to the marked potassium retention seen after indomethacin therapy. Plasma renin activity showed a consistent increase after kaliuretics and a marked decrease in response to antiprostaglandin agents. The opposite effect of the drugs on plasma renin activity, due to their different sites of action on the pathophysiologic chain of events in Bartter's syndrome, given an explanation for the contrasting therapeutic results.", 
    "39": "Significant numbers of fourth larval stage Trichostrongylus colubriformis from sheep donors are expelled from the small intestine of T. colubriformis-immune guinea pigs within 8 h of transplantation into this organ. This model system for the immune expulsion of gastrointestinal nematode parasites was used in the current experiments to examine the effect of drugs recently shown to modify the release of histamine. The experiments showed that worm expulsion was inhibited by the beta-adrenergic agonists salbutamol and isoprenaline, the phosphodiesterase inhibitors aminophylline and ICI 63,197, the antiallergic drug ICI 74,917 and the antihistamine mepyramine. The beta-blocker propranolol prevented inhibition of worm expulsion following salbutamol treatment and there was some evidence of synergistic action between salbutamol and ICI 63,197. The results support previous findings suggesting an important role for histamine release in the effector mechanism of the immune response of guinea pigs against the parasitic nematode T.colubriformis.", 
    "40": "One hundred and two patients with essential hypertension, managed in hospital out-patient clinics in the United Kingdom on a drug regime of beta-receptor antagonist alone, or in combination with a diuretic were successfully transferred to once daily sustained release oxprenolol. Where a diuretic was prescribed the dose remained unchanged. Improved control of blood pressure was recorded in the majority of patients with one or two morning tablets of sustained release oxprenolol. Preference for once daily therapy, enthusiasm for the calendar pack, and a net increase in the mean daily dosage of a beta-receptor antagonist were the probable factors contributing to the improvement recorded. Once daily sustained release oxprenolol would appear, in most hypertensive patients, to be an effective substitute for multi-dose treatment with beta-receptor antagonists in conventional formulation.", 
    "41": "The hemodynamic effect of mepindolol-sulfate, a new non-cardioselective beta-receptor blocking agent, was compared with the hemodynamic effect of propranolol at rest and during exercise in five patients with coronary artery disease during an eight week double blind cross-over study.", 
    "42": "1. The beta-receptor blocking effect of mepindolol-sulfate is 25 times higher than that of propranolol. 2. No hemodynamic difference between mepindolol-sulfate and propranolol was seen at rest. 3. The increase of blood pressure during exercise was less pronounced during mepindolol-sulfate-medication compared to propranolol. 4. Propranolol seems to achieve a more pronounced negative inotropic effect than mepindolol-sulfate.", 
    "43": "The effects of pindolol and sotalol on neuromusclar transmission were tested using intracellular microelectrode recording of resting membrane potentials, miniature end-plate potentials and end-plate potentials, and recording of muscle contractions upon nerve stimulation of rat phrenic nerve-hemidaphragm preparations. Both pindolol and sotalol reduced the amplitudes of miniature end-plate potentials and end-plate potentials in a dose-dependent manner without significantly affecting their time-courses. Pindolol, but not sotalol, also increased the frequency of the miniature end-plate potentials and decreased th number of acetylcholine quanta released by nerve impulses. Neither of the drugs significantly affected resting membrane potentials of the muscle fibres or excitability of the motor nerve to electric stimulation.", 
    "44": "The oxidation of the naphthalene ring system of propranolol by the rat liver 9000g supernatant has been studied by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two dihydroxy metabolites, one of which possibly catechol-like, and four monophenols were identified based on the mass fragmentation pattern and retention times of their trimethylsilyl and d9-trimethylsilyl derivatives. These observations emphasize the complex oxidation pattern of this drug. All metabolites identified are proposed to be associated with significant biological activity.", 
    "45": "1. The effects of noradrenaline on the secretion of renin and on the efflux of Ca have been investigated in the isolated cat kidney perfused with Locke solution containing the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, phenoxybenzamine, to block increases in renal vascular resistance. 2. Noradrenaline elicited a marked increase in renin secretion in the absence of any discernible alterations in renal arterial pressure, and prolonged perfusion with Ca-free Locke solution failed to depress noradrenaline-evoked renin secretion. 3. Noradrenaline caused an increase in the efflux of 45Ca from prelabelled kidneys perfused with Ca-free solution. Increasing the noradrenaline concentration produced graded increases in 45Ca efflux and renin release, and the peak rise in efflux preceded or coincided with peak renin secretion. 4. DL-Propranolol inhibited the increase in 45Ca efflux and renin release resulting from noradrenaline stimulation. 5. Electrical stimulation of the renal nerve enhanced 45Ca efflux and renin release from prelabelled kidneys perfused with noraml Locke solution. 6. These findings provide further support for the view that the process of catecholamine-induced renin secretion involves mobilization of Ca from a cellular site.", 
    "46": "18 patients with uncomplicated angina pectoris were studied to ascertain the relative significance of individual hemodynamic factors in the production of angina pectoris. Each hemodynamic determinant of myocardial oxygen consumption (heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, LVEDP, and LV dp/dt max) were either altered or controlled as discretely as possible with the use of right atrial pacing, propranolol, phentolamine and ouabain, and the effects of these changes were observed on the onset and total duration of pain. Only heart rate correlated closely with the precipitation of angina. The systemic arterial pressure, LVEDP and LV dp/dt max did not correlate with the production and abolition of angina pectoris. The results indicate that drugs acting only against the effect of sympathetic stimulation of the sinus node would be a major advantage in the treatment of patients with angina pectoris. The unexpected finding that phentolamine did not ameliorate pain in patients with angina pectoris casts doubts as to whether nitroglycerine relieves anginal pain by lowering the systemic arterial pressure.", 
    "47": "Twelve hypertensive patients had measurements of body weight, blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and plasma volume during periods of normal sodium intake and acute sodium depletion. After receiving propranolol orally for four to 14 weeks, repeat measurements were obtained under identical conditions of sodium intake. During normal sodium intake, propranolol therapy was associated with a decrease in plasma renin activity, a variable tendency to an increase in body weight and plasma volume, and a decrease in mean arterial pressure of 5 mm Hg (NS). During sodium restriction, blood pressure was decreased significantly from that observed during normal sodium intake and propranolol added a further significant decrease of 8 mm Hg (P less than .01). Blood pressure reductions obtained with sodium depletion and acute diuretic therapy were approximately the same with or without propranolol. The increase in plasma renin activity expected with sodium depletion and diuretic therapy was not blunted by propranolol.", 
    "48": "Through direct research on isolated human esophagus muscle systems in achalasia patients we found a deviation in the distribution pattern of the contractory alpha-receptors and dilatory beta-receptors in the region of the lower esophagus sphincter in favour of the alpha-receptors. Consequently, the motility of the lower esophagus sphincter was extremely impaired. On the basis of these results, we treated achalasia patients with the alpha receptor blocking drug phentolamine. All patients were soon symptom-free subjectively and improved objectively. Surgical intervention was avoidable in all cases.", 
    "49": "1. UK 14,275 (Pfizer) an inotropic agent with cardiac phosphodiesterase inhibitory activity, was administered to ten healthy male volunteers. 2. The inotropic activity was assessed by non-invasive measurement of systolic time intervals (STI). 3. The compound had significant inotropic activity in the doses administered, as judged by the shortening of pre-ejection period (PEP), without any significant chronotropic activity. 4. The inotropic effect was abolished when measurements were repeated following beta-adrenoceptor blockade with oral propranolol. 5. The inotropic activity was compared to that of intravenous isoprenaline.", 
    "50": "Isolated rat hearts were perfused with buffer containing noradrenaline 10(-7) to 10(-4) M. A dose-dependent depletion of glycogen and ATP were seen together with a leakage of ASAT and creatine phosphokinase (CK). The damage induced by noradrenaline could be prevented by addition of a beta-blocker (metoprolol), verapamil, or lidocaine to the perfusion medium. When the endogenous myocardial stores of noradrenaline are rapidly depleted by perfusion with tyramine a similar cell damage was demonstrated. Electron micrographs from hearts subjected to noradrenaline showed three different types of cell damage that could be correlated to earlier described findings. The importance of noradrenaline for the ischemic injury was demonstrated. It was hypothesized that acute myocardial infarction may start because of a sudden release of endogenous noradrenaline.", 
    "51": "The cardiovascular responses to isometric and dynamic exercise have been studied in six normal subjects, before and after intravenous propranolol, using the amplitude of the first heart sound (S1), measured from an ultra-low frequency phonocardiogram, as an index of left ventricular mechanical performance. Dynamic exercise caused significant increases in heart rate and S1 amplitude which were largely inhibited by beta-adrenergic blockade. Isometric exercise also produced increases in heart rate and blood pressure, but a decrease in S1 amplitude. Propranolol had no significant effect on the cardiovascular response to isometric exercise. These results confirm previous suggestions that, in contrast to dynamic exercise, the normal cardiovascular responses to isometric exercise are relatively independent of the beta-adrenergic nervous system. Possible reasons why the improvement in left ventricular performance, which has previously been shown to occur during isometric handgrip, was not reflected in the phonocardiogram, are also discussed.", 
    "52": "High doses of isoprenaline or orciprenaline decreased the rate of transfer of tritium-labelled water from mother to fetus. The effect was blocked by propranolol. Maternal blood spaces of the placental labyrinth in the treated animals were congested with masses of red blood cells. These observations suggest that the placental circulation is impaired by high doses of beta-sympathomimetic drugs.", 
    "53": "Myocardial uptake of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and its inhibition by digoxin and propranolol were studied in paced, isolated perfused cat hearts using tritiated doxorubicin. Contractility was studied using a Walton-Brody strain gauge arch and its first derivative. Coronary blood flow was measured by collecting the effluent from the heart. The myocardial content of doxorubicin was 0.069 +/- 0.101 nmol/mg after 30 minutes. Combined administration of doxorubicin and digoxin reduced the myocardial content of doxorubicin to 0.025 +/- 0.010 nmol/mg (P less than .02). The combination increased contractility compared with doxorubicin alone and increased coronary blood flow compared with digoxin alone. The reduction in the myocardial content of digoxin by doxorubicin was not significant. Propranolol also reduced the myocardial uptake of doxorubicin (P less than .05) without changing coronary blood flow and without further reducing contractility. Thus, both propranolol and digoxin merit evaluation in preventing doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.", 
    "54": "To determine the effectiveness of oral propranolol in children, we administered 0.5 to 4.0 mg/kg/day of the drug to 64 children (age one day to 20 years); 41 with cardiac dysrhythmias, six with isiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, and 17 with paroxysmal hypoxemic spells associated with right ventricular infundibular obstruction. A new liquid form of propranolol (10 mg/ml) was administered to 37 of the younger patients, and tablets were given to the other 27. Propranolol improved the dysrhythmia in 31 of 41 patients, being notably effective in supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia associated with a prolonged QT interval. The drug also eliminated symptoms attributed to IHSS in six of six patients and abolished hypoxemic spells in 12 of 17. The liquid and tablets were equally effective; and the liquid had the advantage of allowing for accurate dose changes in younger children. We conclude that oral propranolol is an excellent drug for use in pediatric patients with certain types of cardiac disease.", 
    "55": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive Kyoto Wistar controls were divided into 3 groups of 10 animals each and treated with phenoxybenzamine (5 mg/kg once daily), propranolol (25 mg/kg twice daily) or saline (once daily). After 5 weeks the in vitro incorporation of D-[U-14C]-glucose into aortic lipids and glycogen was measured in the presence and absence of insulin (1 mU/ml). In both normotensive and hypertensive rats treated with propranolol 14C-incorporation into triglycerides was reduced. Furthermore, insulin significantly stimulated 14C-incorporation into triglycerides, phospholipids and glycogen in propranolol-treated hypertensive rats. This effect was not statistically significant (0.05 less than p less than 0.1) in propranolol-treated normotensives. Phenoxybenzamine treatment did not significantly modify aortic lipogenesis or glycogen synthesis from glucose. Chronic propranolol treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats resulted in aortic tissue becoming sensitized to insulin. Possible mechanisms and explanations for this are discussed."
