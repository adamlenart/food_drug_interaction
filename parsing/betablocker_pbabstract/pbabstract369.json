    "0": "Timolol maleate, a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker, has been used to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension for almost two decades. Recently a new preparation, timolol hemihydrate, has been described which eliminates the maleate buffer and simplifies the purification step for the R-enantiomer. The ocular pharmacology of the two medicines is expected to be similar. Ocular bioavailability as well as toxicity for timolol hemihydrate is similar to that which has been shown previously for timolol maleate. In a multicenter trial in the United States, timolol hemihydrate was shown to reduce the intraocular pressure to a similar extent as timolol maleate. At the week 12 visit intraocular pressure was 19.5 and 19.5 mm Hg for the hemihydrate and maleate groups respectively for the 0.25% concentration and 18.3 and 18.6 mm Hg respectively for the 0.5% concentration. Following a nine month open-label portion where patients were treated with timolol hemihydrate only intraocular pressure was 19.9 and 19.1 mm Hg for the 0.25% and 0.5% concentrations respectively. Ocular and systemic adverse events, as well as vital signs, were similar between timolol hemihydrate and maleate. In conclusion, timolol hemihydrate appears to be a safe and effective medicine in the treatment of ocular hypertension and chronic open-angle glaucoma.", 
    "1": "Adaprolol maleate is a new beta-adrenergic antagonist that is being developed to treat glaucoma. The soft drug was designed to minimize systemic activity through facile inactivation to an inactive metabolite. Studies with other potent beta-adrenergic antagonists indicated that tissue specific receptor differences might be more stringent for selected beta-adrenergic blocking activities and suggested that R enantiomers of traditional beta-blockers should be developed for controlling glaucoma. The present studies demonstrate that the potent ocular hypotensive effects of adaprolol are not stereoselective. In contrast, cardiac effects could be detected after intravenous S(+) adaprolol, but not R(-) adaprolol. The studies confirm that adaprolol functions as a potent beta-adrenergic antagonist. The negligible systemic beta-blocking activity detected with opthalmic administration of adaprolol is consistent with soft drug design.", 
    "2": "The objective of the present study was to determine the basis for dosing time-dependent changes in the ocular and systemic absorption of topically applied timolol in pigmented rabbits. The gamma scintigraphic technique was used to monitor the changes in precorneal solution retention following instillation. Changes in timolol concentration in the plasma over 120 min and in various anterior segment eye tissues at 30 min following the topical instillation of 25 microliters of 0.65% timolol maleate solutions at various dosing times were monitored using reversed phase HPLC. Corneal and conjunctival permeability at various dosing times was evaluated in the modified Ussing chamber. The results indicated that precorneal solution drainage was slowest at noon. Suppressing tear production by anesthesia led to an increase in ocular timolol absorption at 6 a.m. but not at other dosing times, in spite of the lowest corneal permeability then. There was no statistically significant dosing time influence on systemic timolol absorption following nasal or conjunctival dosing. In conclusion, possible diurnal changes in precorneal solution clearance may be the main factor underlying the diurnal changes in ocular as well as systemic timolol absorption in rabbits. In addition, diurnal changes in corneal permeability may also contribute to diurnal changes in ocular timolol absorption.",

    "7": "Timolol maleate, levobunolol, metipranolol, and carteolol have similar effectiveness in lowering intraocular pressure; however, levobunolol and timolol gel forming solution may have an advantage of once-daily dosing. Studies have not been published comparing the clinical efficacy of timolol hemihydrate with that of other ocular beta-blockers. Metipranolol is cost effective in treating primary open-angle glaucoma; however, it has been associated with more ocular burning, stinging, and granulomatous anterior uveitis than other agents. The intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of carteolol has not yet displayed a definite advantage over the other agents in terms of optic disk perfusion and systemic adverse effects. The control of intraocular pressure with betaxolol has not always been as good as with timolol; however, betaxolol has some advantages over timolol and the other topical beta-blockers in terms of systemic adverse effects.",

    "9": "Corinfar-retard as a base of different combinations with triampur, Cordanum, Capoten were studied in 52 patients with stable arterial hypertension (systolic pressure > 180 mm Hg, diastolic pressure > 105 mm Hg). In the above combinations pharmacokinetics of corinfar-retard did not change. Good response was noted in corinfar-retard combination with Cordanum in patients with moderate hemodynamic changes, hypertonicity of sympathoadrenal system, tachycardia. In patients with impaired myocardial contractility, elevated total peripheral vascular resistance, noticeable hypotensive effects was registered in combination with triampur. The absence of hypotensive effect in the above combination required the addition of Capoten which was absolutely indicated in patients with stable increase in plasma renin activity.", 
    "10": "CGP 12177A originally was developed as a hydrophilic antagonist to detect cell surface beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors, and subsequently was found to be a partial agonist for the atypical or beta 3-adrenergic receptor. Using hamster cells stably expressing either the human beta 1-, human beta 2- or rat beta 1-adrenergic receptor, we found that CGP 12177A behaved as an agonist of beta 1-adrenergic receptors. Whereas at low concentrations, CGP 12177a behaved as an antagonist and inhibited isoproterenol stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, at higher concentrations, it stimulated a response even in the absence of isoproterenol. The agonistic properties of CGP 12177A were positively correlated with the level of beta 1-adrenergic receptor expression. Thus, at low receptor of densities, CGP 12177A behaved as a weak, partial agonist whereas as high receptor densities, the drug was a full agonist. At similar high densities of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor, CGP 12177A acted only as a partial agonist. Competition binding studies to membranes from cells expressing beta 1-adrenergic receptors indicated that approximately 90% of the receptors were in a high affinity, guanine nucleotide-insensitive state for CGP 12177A whereas approximately 10% of the receptors were in a lower affinity, guanine nucleotide-sensitive state for CGP 12177A. We propose that the latter receptors are precoupled to stimulatory G proteins and recognize CGP 12177A as an agonist whereas the high affinity, uncoupled receptors recognize CGP 12177A as an antagonist.", 
    "11": "Changes in the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptors in two subcellular fractions, the sarcolemma and the light vesicle, of rat heart during sepsis were studied, using [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) binding and photoaffinity labeling with [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP). Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Septic rat hearts exhibit an initial hypercardiodynamic (9 h after CLP; early sepsis) and a subsequent hypocardiodynamic (18 h after CLP; late sepsis) state. [3H]DHA-binding studies show that, during early sepsis, the maximum binding capacity (Bmax) was increased by 35% in sarcolemma but was decreased by 25% in light vesicles, whereas during late sepsis, the Bmax was decreased by 39% in sarcolemma but was increased by 30% in light vesicles. Photoaffinity labeling studies show that the incorporation of [125I]ICYP into 64,000-Da peptide during early sepsis was increased by 32% in sarcolemma but was decreased by 27% in light vesicles, whereas during late sepsis, the incorporation was decreased by 30% in sarcolemma but was increased by 35% in light vesicles. These data indicate that beta-adrenergic receptors in the rat heart were externalized from light vesicles to sarcolemma during the hyperdynamic phase but were internalized from surface membranes to intracellular sites during the hypodynamic phase of sepsis. Because beta-adrenergic receptors mediate adrenergic control of cardiac muscle contraction, a biphasic intracellular redistribution of beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart may contribute to the development of the initial hypercardiodynamic and subsequent hypocardiodynamic states during sepsis.", 
    "12": "The proportion of slow-twitch, fatigue-resistant type 1 skeletal muscle (SM) fibers is often reduced in heart failure (HF), while the proportion of fatigue-sensitive type-II fibers increases. This maladaptation may be partially responsible for the exercise intolerance that characterize HF. In this study, we examined the effects of early monotherapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibor, enalapril, and the beta-blocker, metoprolol, on SM fiber type composition in 18 dogs with moderate HF produced by intracoronary microembolizations. HF dogs were randomized to 3 mo therapy with enalapril (10 mg twice daily), metoprolol (25 mg twice daily), or no treatment. Triceps muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline, before randomization, and at the end of 30 mo of therapy. Type I and type II SM fibers were differentiated by myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase (pH 9.4). In untreated dogs, the proportion of type I fibers was 27 +/- 1% before randomization and decreased to 23 +/- 1% (P < 0.05) at the end of 3 mo of follow up. In dogs treated with enalapril or metoprolol, the proportion of type I fibers was 30 +/- 4 and 28 +/- 2% before randomization and 33 +/- 4 and 33 +/- 1%, respectively, after 3 mo of therapy. In conclusion, in dogs with moderate HF, early therapy with enalapril or metoprolol prevents the progressive decline in the proportion of type I SM fibers.", 
    "13": "Endogenous norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) were demonstrated in lymphocytes isolated from peripheral venous blood. In 13 young subjects lymphocyte NE and E averaged 14.3 and 1.9 pg per 10(7) cells, respectively. The ratio NE/E was similar in plasma and in lymphocytes. Highly significant correlations were obtained between lymphocyte NE and E on the one hand and cAMP in lymphocytes on the other both in the basal state and after stimulation with isoproterenol. In a group of elderly subjects lymphocyte NE concentration was significantly reduced in long-term smokers as compared to non-smokers (7 and 35 pg/10(7) cells, respectively), whereas plasma NE was increased in smokers. Addition of exogenous NE or propranolol to blood samples did not change lymphocyte NE concentration in in vitro experiments. Variability in endogenous lymphocyte concentration of E in 9 young subjects, correlated with concomitant changes in number of NK(CD3-CD56+) cells and cAMP. It is concluded that endogenous lymphocyte NE and E concentrations in healthy subjects reflected basal cAMP production in lymphocytes and lymphocyte subset composition.", 
    "14": "A prospective, randomized, cross-over trial comparing the antihypertensive efficacy and biochemical changes during treatment with either hydrochlorothiazide (HTZ: 25 mg o.d.) or propranolol (PRO: 40 mg t.i.d.), included 55 mild to moderate hypertensives (diastolic blood pressures ranged from 90 to 110 mmHg), aged 25-65 years. Forty patients completed the study; during the first six months 20 of them (12 males and 8 females) were taking HTZ, and the remaining 20 (13 males and 7 females) PRO. After a one-week wash-out period, for the next six months the alternative drug was administered. Antihypertensive efficacy of both drugs was nearly equal: systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased already after the first month (approximately by 10%), and kept unchanged until the end of the study. The analyzed biochemical parameters, i.e. blood glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides did not increase significantly, while serum potassium level remained almost unchanged during the trial. Furthermore, during PRO in group B, cholesterol significantly decreased (3rd month), as well as blood glucose during HTZ treatment (10th month). Only the uric acid level, although unsignificantly, increased in group A (from 326.2 to 365.3 +/- 125.2 on HTZ, and to 391.4 +/- 120.0 mumol/l on PRO). It is concluded that HTZ and PRO are comparably effective antihypertensives. During the long-term treatment in small doses these drugs do not induce significant biochemical disturbances.", 
    "15": "The influence of cytotoxic agents adriamycine (AD) and ethydium bromide (EB) on Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels of erythrocytes was investigated. The incubation of erythrocytes with agliconic part of AD (without aminosugar residue) increased Ca(2+)-dependent K+ efflux induced by low concentration of propranolol, while EB suppressed the activating effect of propranolol. EB, verapamil and triphluoroperazine inhibited Ca(2+)-dependent K+ efflux induced by high doses of propranolol. The incubation of erythrocytes with AD took off the inhibitory action of EB and verapamil but did not influence the blocking effect of triphluoroperazine. Both AD and EB did not influence Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels induced by Ca(2+)-ionophore A23187, and Pb(2+)-dependent K+ efflux from erythrocytes. It is suggested that opposite effects of AD and EB on Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels are due to activation by AD and inhibition by EB of system of Ca2+ transport into cells, but not on their action directly on K+ channel.", 
    "16": "Catecholamines are known to stimulate calcitonin secretion in C-cells by a receptor mediated pathway, but details regarding the postreceptor events are unknown. Since norepinephrine (NE) influences intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]i and cAMP levels in C-cells, we used different adrenergic agonists and antagonists to investigate the effect of NE on [Ca2+]i and cAMP accumulation, and on calcitonin secretion in rat MTC-6-23 cells. NE stimulated intracellular cAMP accumulation and calcitonin secretion dose-dependent, with 10(-7) mol/l causing maximal stimulation. The NE induced increase in cAMP accumulation/calcitonin secretion could be decreased to baseline by equimolar amounts of the beta-adrenergic blocker propanolol. The alpha-blocker phentolamine did not significantly influence NE stimulated calcitonin secretion even at high concentrations. The beta-adrenergic agonist fenoterol proved to be as effective as NE in stimulating cAMP accumulation/calcitonin secretion. Activation of inhibitory G-proteins by the adenosine A1 receptor analogue N6-phenylisopropyladenosine at 10(-6) mol/l completely blocked NE stimulated calcitonin secretion. NE stimulated calcitonin secretion was also completely blocked by the cAMP antagonist RpcAMPs. The calcium channel blocker verapamil significantly inhibited NE stimulated calcitonin secretion, but interestingly increased NE stimulated cAMP accumulation. We conclude that NE induced calcitonin secretion is mediated through beta-receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase via G-proteins. cAMP and changes in [Ca2+]i are necessary for NE induced calcitonin secretion. There seems to be a complex interaction between the two pathways even regarding events occurring distal to cell membrane.", 
    "17": "The effects of carteolol 2% and a fixed combination of carteolol 2% and pilocarpine 2% (CBS 341 A) eye-drops on intraocular pressure (I.O.P.) were compared in a multicenter double-blind, cross-over prospective trial. Twenty-eight patients were initially selected after at least three weeks of carteolol 2%, with a morning I.O.P. greater than 21-mmHg. They received 2 drops a day (b.i.d.), in a random order, alternating two weeks of carteolol 2% alone or two weeks of CBS 341 A. After each two-week period a 12-h I.O.P. curve was plotted. Compared to carteolol the combination reduced I.O.P. on average by around 20% (4 mmHg), with maximum effect 4h after instillation. The effectiveness was confirmed after twelve hours. Some side effects were reported with CBS 341 A, due to the well known pharmacological effects of pilocarpine. The new combination could be useful for second-line therapy in glaucoma.", 
    "18": "This study aimed at clarification of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying bronchial obstruction in 28 18-71-year-old patients with chronic bronchitis (CB) diagnosed 2-8 years before. The patients had moderate obstructive disorders in distal parts of the bronchial tree. Investigations revealed a group of patients with paradoxical response to beta-blockers manifesting as lowering of bronchial resistance and high speed. Bronchial obstruction in these patients proved to arise primarily from early expiratory collapse of small bronchi. Administration of beta-mimetic and beta-blocking agents may serve as pharmacological tests able to discover mechanisms of bronchial obstruction and help in the choice of adequate therapy for chronic bronchitis.", 
    "19": "1. The effects of two extracts from Sabal serrulata fruits [total lipidic (L) and saponifiable (S)] on smooth muscle contractions have been assayed. 2. Both extracts (0.1-1 mg/ml) relaxed the tonic contraction induced by norepinefrine (30 nM) on rat aorta [EC50, 0.53 +/- 0.05 mg/ml (L) and 0.5 +/- 0.04 mg/ml (S)] and by KCl (60 mM) on rat uterus. The Sabal extracts (0.3-1 mg/ml) also antagonized the dose-response curve of contractions induced by acetylcholine (0.1-100 microM) on urinary bladder. 3. dL-Propranolol (1 microM) but not the inactive (R)-(+)-propranolol(1 microM) potentiated the Sabal extracts relaxant effect by lowering the EC50 (0.35 +/- 0.2 vs 0.20 +/- 0.01 mg/ml for L and 0.43 +/- 0.02 vs 0.19 +/- 0.02 mg/ml, P < 0.01, for S extract). 4. Cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml) antagonized the effect of extracts from Sabal. However, actinomycin D (5 micrograms/ml) significantly (P < or = 0.01) antagonized the effect of the total lipidic extract without modifying that of the saponifiable extract. 5. The relaxant effect of both extracts was not modified by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (10 microM) or the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor alpha-difluoromethyl-ornithine (10 mM).", 
    "20": "1. This study examines the effect of Hoe 140, a bradykinin (BK) 2 receptor antagonist, indomethacin and prednisolone on chronic adjuvant arthritis of the knee in rats. We also evaluated the influence of Hoe 140 on BK-forming enzymes in the synovial and paw tissues. 2. Adjuvant arthritis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats in the right knee by injecting 0.05 ml of a fine suspension of heat-killed Mycobacterium tubercle bacilli in liquid paraffin (5 mg/ml). 3. Hoe 140 (1.5 mg/kg i.p.), indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg orally) and prednisolone (3.0 mg/kg orally) administration for 9 days resulted in significant suppression of knee joint swelling. Plasma and tissue kallikrein levels were raised (P < 0.01) in the synovial and paw tissues of adjuvant arthritic rats. Hoe 140 treatment reduced (P < 0.05) tissue kallikrein but increased (P < 0.01) plasma kallikrein levels in synovial tissue. 4. Hoe 140 treatment did not alter (P > 0.05) the raised plasma and tissue kallikrein levels in the paw tissue. The findings indicate that Hoe 140 may be a useful anti-inflammatory agent and BK plays a major role in this adjuvant-induced arthritis model.", 
    "21": "1. Inotropic and chronotropic effects of beraprost sodium (beraprost), a chemically stable prostacyclin analogue, were examined in isolated myocardial preparations of guinea pigs. 2. In the left atria, 10(-9) - 10(-7) M beraprost had no significant effect on the contractile force, but 10(-6) and 10(-5) M produced a concentration-dependent positive inotropic response. This effect was antagonized by S-145, a potent and selective thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor antagonist, but not by propranolol. 3. Beraprost, from 10(-9) to 10(-5) M, had no significant inotropic effect in the right ventricular papillary muscles. 4. In the right atria, 10(-9) and 10(-8) M beraprost had no significant effect, but 10(-7) - 10(-5) M caused an increase in beating rate; this effect was not affected by S-145. 5. The present study demonstrates that beraprost has positive inotropic and chronotropic effects at high doses on isolated guinea pig atria. The inotropic effect may be mediated by the TXA2 receptor, but some mechanism other than the TXA2 receptor is responsible for the chronotropic effect.", 
    "22": "Overt congestive heart failure (CHF) has a prevalence of 1% of the population. The predominant symptoms of patients with CHF are fatigue and dyspnoea. Fatigue is thought to result from changes in peripheral muscle metabolism secondary to decrease vasodilative capacity and physical inactivity. An increase of peripheral perfusion by vasodilator therapy and physical activity are therefore recommended. Beside overt decompensation, where dyspnoea results from acute pulmonary congestion due to backward failure, increased physiological dead space ventilation caused by pulmonary ventilation/perfusion mismatch accounts, to a large degree, for dyspnoea, and can be improved by vasodilator therapy. According to the pathophysiology of CHF, normalisation of loading conditions and myocardial inotropy are the parameters addressed by various pharmacological agents in order to alleviate symptoms and slow progression of the disease. Diuretics are rapidly acting and effective agents to improve congestion and decrease filling pressures. Digitalis improves haemodynamics and symptomatology by increasing inotropy and slowing resting heart rate in atrial fibrillation; however, prognostic effects have yet to be proved. The introduction of vasodilators has significantly improved the prognosis of the disease, and the administration of ACE inhibitors in particular has been shown to slow progression of CHF. This results in a substantial decrease in morbidity and mortality. The present article appraises the role of the currently used drugs in the treatment of CHF, considering effects on pathophysiology and clinical outcome and provides an approach to a differential drug regimen.", 
    "23": "Nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) contraction has been demonstrated in animal urinary bladder. However, the exact nature of the NANC innervation is still unclear. 1,1-Dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP), which generates action potentials in the cell body of the postganglionic neuron and causes neurotransmitter release (both acetylcholine and noradrenaline), was given intravenously (0.1-0.7 mg/kg) to 3-month-old female Wistar rats under anesthesia (n = 20). Intravesical pressure, heart rate and blood pressure of the rats were monitored on Gould polygraph. Monophasic dose-dependent contractile response was observed upon administration of DMPP in 12 of 20 rats. After total adrenergic and cholinergic blockade with atropine, guanethidine, phentolamine and propranolol, the contractile response was reduced, not completely, in the animals. At the dose of 0.7 mg/kg, the contraction was reduced to about 48% of the original response. The study provides in vivo evidence for NANC contraction in the rat urinary bladder, moreover, the neurotransmitter is released from the postganglionic neurons.", 
    "24": "The comparison of the anti-ischemic activity of trimetazidine and propranolol was evaluated by multiple end points (clinical, exercise test, and ambulatory electrocardiogram [ECG] monitoring criteria) in 149 male patients with effort angina who received either trimetazidine 20 mg tid or propranolol 40 mg tid during a period of 3 months. The distribution of the standardized differences between the two treatments for each variable was obtained by a permutation method. The medians (estimation of the actual difference between the two treatments) and the 5, 25, 75 and 95% quantiles were represented on the same diagram for all end points. The pattern of the standardized distribution of the differences showed a similar activity of both drugs on symptoms and nitrates consumption, on exercise tolerance and increase in ischemic threshold at exercise, and on ischemia recorded at ambulatory ECG monitoring. Conversely, only propranolol decreased heart rate and rate pressure product at rest as well as at exercise, underlining the difference in the mode of action of the two drugs. This descriptive technique is an attractive method to evaluate the differences between drugs considering multiple criteria favouring the estimation of these differences together with their variability.",

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed lymphocytic and neutrophilic alveolitis. The lack of another etiologic factor and the spontaneously favorable course after withdrawal of the drug support the hypothesis of a labetalol induced pulmonary fibrosis.",

The MAP measured with a radial catheter, the ICP obtained with a lumbar subarachnoid catheter and the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP, calculated from MAP and ICP) were assessed before induction of anaesthesia, before esmolol or lidocaine injection, and before intubation, during the maximal change in MAP, as well as 2 and 5 minutes after intubation.",

Following intubation, CPP increased significantly (P < 0.05) to 99 +/- 23 mmHg after esmolol and to 99 +/- 17 mmHg after lidocaine. The ICP increased also significantly (P < 0.05) after intubation from 11 +/- 6 to 17 +/- 10 mmHg in the esmolol group, and from 10 +/- 6 to 16 +/- 9 mmHg in the lidocaine group.",

    "32": "The aim of this study was to assess plasma ammonia levels during acute treadmill exercise in dogs after intravenous administration of a single dose of different cardioselective (atenolol) and non-selective (sotalol and propranolol) beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. The experiments were performed on 6 male mongrel dogs (20-25 kg) trained to run on a motor driven treadmill. After administration of saline or atenolol, there was no significant increase in plasma ammonia during exercise; propranolol and sotalol however, both non-selective beta-blockers, produced a significant increase in plasma ammonia. Plasma levels of alanine and glutamine were not altered during exercise compared with resting values, and were not modified by the administration of beta-blockers. It is not clear whether the different effects on exercise induced hyperammonemia are due to different effects on muscle ammonia formation or on the ammonia clearance by the liver.", 
    "33": "Angiotensin II may contribute to the altered structure and function of small arteries. We proposed that angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment could induce a regression of vascular remodeling. A double-blind trial was performed comparing effects of the ACE inhibitor cilazapril with the beta-blocker atenolol on small arteries obtained from biopsy specimens of subcutaneous gluteal fat. Nine patients with essential hypertension were randomized to cilazapril and eight to atenolol. Blood pressure was below 140/95 mm Hg under treatment for the duration of the study in all patients. Media-to-lumen ratio of small arteries of the patients, which before treatment was significantly higher than in normotensive subjects, was corrected after 1 year of treatment in the cilazapril group. There was no change in the increased media-to-lumen ratio of small arteries in the atenolol group, even after 2 years of treatment. Attenuated constrictor responses to endothelin-1 returned to normal only in the patients treated with cilazapril. Endothelium-dependent relaxation responses to acetylcholine were slightly depressed in hypertensive patients and improved in the cilazapril-treated group, but remained blunted in the arteries of the atenolol-treated patients. Treatment with cilazapril corrects small artery remodeling and endothelium-related functional abnormalities of gluteal subcutaneous small arteries in hypertensive patients. It remains to be demonstrated whether these apparently beneficial effects translate into reduced morbidity and mortality in hypertension.", 
    "34": "Fasting plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apoprotein (apo) B were elevated in 214 nondiabetic renal transplant recipients when compared to a reference group. Apo (a) was slightly but not significantly lower in transplant recipients (median 118 mg/dl, range 16-1680 vs 130 mg/dl, 10-1176) and this difference could be predicted from Lp (a) isoform analysis. Cholesterol, triglyceride, apo B and apo (a) concentrations correlated negatively with creatinine clearance but none of these parameters showed a significant association with proteinuria. Patients treated with steroids had higher plasma HDL concentrations than those receiving cyclosporin monotherapy (P < 0.01). The use of diuretics was associated with raised triglycerides (P < 0.001) and cholesterol (P < 0.01) and with reduced HDL (P < 0.01) whilst patients receiving beta-blockers had significantly higher triglycerides (P < 0.01) and lower HDL levels (P < 0.02). In multiple regression analysis, age (P < 0.01), creatinine clearance (P < 0.05) and diuretic therapy (P < 0.005) were independent risk factors for increased cholesterol whilst apo (a) levels correlated negatively with creatinine clearance (P < 0.005). These results suggest that impaired renal function, steroids and non-immunosuppressive drugs contribute to lipid abnormalites in renal transplant recipients.", 
    "35": "The effects of an endothelin (ET)-receptor B-specific antagonist, RES-701-1, on ET-induced contraction of guinea-pig trachea and on ET-induced bronchoconstriction in anaesthetized guinea-pigs were investigated. In the epithelium-removed tracheal preparation, 1 x 10(-5) M RES-701-1 inhibited contractions induced by the ETB-specific agonist sarafotoxin S6c (pKB = 6.10). In the epithelium-intact tracheal preparation, RES-701-1 (1 x 10(-5) M)inhibited the ET-3-induced contraction (pKB = 5.27), but enhanced the ET-1-induced contraction significantly and shifted the concentration-response curve to the left. The maximal responses of ET-1- and ET-3-induced contraction were augmented by epithelium removal by 1.5 and 1.8-fold, respectively. Against ET-3-induced contraction in the tracheal preparation without epithelium, RES-701-1 (0.3-10 x 10(-6)M) antagonized the contraction in a concentration-dependent manner (pA2 = 5.9). On the other hand, RES-701-1 (1 x 10(-5)M) did not affect ET-1-evoked responses in the trachea without epithelium. The intravenous administration of ET-1 (1.5 nmol/kg-1) or ET-3 (1.5 nmol/kg-1) evoked a biphasic, fast and sustained bronchoconstriction in anaesthetized guinea-pigs pretreated with propranolol (1.0 mg/kg-1). when administered intravenously, RES-701-1 (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg-1) showed significant reduction in both phases of bronchoconstriction induced by ET-3. As in the case of ET-1-induced bronchoconstriction, rES-701-1 augmented the sustained phase although a significant reduction of the fast phase was observed. These results indicate that RES-701-1 can inhibit the ET-3 induced airway responses not only in-vitro but also in-vivo.", 
    "36": "There is growing interest in the evaluation of drugs (prescription only medicines and over-the-counter medicines) as antioxidant prophylactics. Although free radical mechanism in human degenerative diseases is now generally recognised, the mechanisms of tissue injury in humans are very complex and it may not be possible to clearly identify the role played by free radicals in the process. This review examines the current evidence to support the notion that drugs for a particular therapeutic category might possess useful antioxidant capacity hence minimising tissue injury due to free radicals.", 
    "37": "1. The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and beta-blockade on collagen in the heart and on plasma catecholamines and tissue angiotensin (Ang) I and II were examined in Bio 14.6 Syrian hamsters. Male hamsters (76-79 days old) were given low-dose enalapril (3 mg/kg per day), high-dose enalapril (30 mg/kg per day), atenolol (50 mg/kg per day) or vehicle for 65 days. Age and sex matched healthy F1b hamsters were used as controls. Collagen concentration was determined by measuring hydroxyproline content and the relative proportion of type I, III, and V collagens was obtained by non-interrupted sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Per cent collagen area (PCA) was measured by pixel counting in myocardial tissue by a personal computer. 2. Although heartweight (HW) and bodyweight (BW) in F1b controls were significantly higher compared with drug-treated groups and vehicles, the HW/BW ratio in cardiomyopathic Bio 14.6 hamsters tended to be high compared with F1b controls and was decreased by each drug treatment. 3. Collagen concentration, total collagen content and PCA in the heart of Bio 14.6 hamsters were significantly higher than F1b controls. Collagen concentration and total collagen content were significantly decreased in all drug-treated groups compared with vehicles. 4. The proportion of type I collagen tended to decrease while that of type III collagen tended to increase in all drug-treated groups compared with vehicles. Type V collagen in vehicle-treated group was significantly higher than in F1b controls, while it tended to decrease in all drug-treated groups compared with vehicles. 5. Plasma concentrations of catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline) were decreased significantly by atenolol and high-dose enalapril, but not by low-dose enalapril. Tissue AngI remained unaltered in any of the drug-treated hamsters. Tissue AngII was decreased by the high-dose enalapril and beta-blockade, and tended to be decreased by low-dose enalapril treatment. 6. These results reveal that enalapril and atenolol produced similar beneficial effects on collagen remodelling in Bio 14.6 hamsters by decreasing the total amount of collagen, and also by changing collagen phenotypes through the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Both drugs also improved myocardial morphological integrity.", 
    "38": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is associated with dramatic increases in arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) that may precipitate new left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs) suggestive of myocardial ischemia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of pretreatment with esmolol on the incidence of RWMAs after ECT. Thirteen patients served as their own controls and, in a random fashion, received a standard succinylcholine/methohexital anesthetic for one of two ECT sessions, and an identical anesthetic with esmolol 1 mg/kg for their other ECT session. Systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), mean arterial pressures (MAP) and HR were recorded after drug administration and before ECT and at 1-, 2-, 4-, 5-, 10-, and 15-min intervals after ECT. Echocardiograms were obtained at baseline, after drug administration, 1 min after ECT, and at recovery 15 min later. All patients had significant increases in SBP, DBP, and MAP at 1, 2 and 4 min after ECT versus baseline, whereas HR was significantly faster at all times in the control sessions. HR was significantly slower after anesthetic induction until 2 min after ECT in the esmolol versus the control group (P < 0.05). New RWMAs were seen in only 1 of 26 (4%) ECT sessions, despite the presence of baseline RWMAs in 31% of the patients. We conclude that contrary to previously reported data, new RWMAs after ECT are uncommon. Consequently, this study was unable to demonstrate any beneficial effect of pretreatment with esmolol on the incidence of ECT-induced RWMAs.",

    "45": "The cases of two young patients with repetitive syncopal attacks due to idiopathic long QT syndrome (ILQTS) are reported. Both had been primarily misdiagnosed for seizures. In one of the cases the QT interval in the ECG at rest was normal. The same patient had a previous episode of cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation. The treadmill stress test was of great value, revealing polymorphic ventricular tachycardia induced by exercise, and evaluating the efficacy of beta-blocking therapy in the follow-up. The ILQTS should be considered a possible etiology in any patient presenting with new onset seizures, especially in the young. The treatments were different in both cases. In the first one, the treatment with nadolol (100 mg od) revealed to be very effective with total remission of symptoms. The treadmill stress test performed 15 days after the beginning of treatment did not show any ventricular arrhythmias, and it was assumed that the patient was effectively protected against ventricular arrhythmias. After 4.5 months of follow up, no syncopal episodes occurred. In the second case due to young age, the frequency, and the severity of the attacks (cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation), and the inefficacy of beta-adrenergic-blocking agents, the implantable cardioversor-defibrillator was the treatment chosen, although the beta blocking therapy was maintained to reduce the number of arrhythmic events. The ILQTS is a rare anomaly related to sudden cardiac death. The ILQTS is characterised by the association of several distinctive electrocardiographic features, among which prolongation of the QT interval is the best known. Life-threatening arrhythmia occurs usually under conditions of physical or psychological stress. Relatively effective therapies do exist and are represented by antiadrenergic interventions: beta-adrenergic-blocking agents are the treatment of choice. When they fail, left sympathetic denervation or the automatic implantable cardioversor-defibrillator have also proved to be effective.",

Psychotropic medications appropriate for the treatment of anxiety disorders in these medical-psychiatric populations (benzodiazepines, cyclic antidepressants, and buspirone) as well as beta-adrenergic blocking agents and antihistamines are discussed with an emphasis on pharmacokinetic and drug interactions of major clinical importance for the medically ill patient.",

    "48": "Changes in the release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and vasopressin (VP) may contribute to the final outcome of beta-adrenoceptor blocking therapy. Therefore, we administered 2 hours before a bicycle exercise test (a 30-minute exercise with 100 W work load) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study orally 50 mg atenolol, 80 mg propranolol or 10 mg pindolol to 15 healthy volunteers. Hormone release and sympathoadrenal activation were estimated by measuring plasma ANP-, VP-, adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations. beta-blockade and -antagonism were estimated by measuring the reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia and the extent to which the drugs occupied rabbit lung beta 1- and rat reticulocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors in the circulating plasma. We noticed clear differences in the animal beta 1- and beta 2-receptor occupancy between these agents. The agents and placebo during the exercise augmented plasma ANP level similarly, on average by 34-72%. Pindolol administration enhanced the decline of plasma ANP level after exercise (ANCOVA rep meas, pindolol vs placebo, p < 0.05). Although pindolol increased the mean plasma VP level by 25% (ANCOVA rep meas for the increase, pindolol vs placebo, p < 0.05), drug effects on plasma VP-level were generally negligible. In conclusion, in healthy volunteers beta 1- and beta 2-antagonism by pindolol, atenolol and propranolol do not markedly potentiate plasma ANP- and VP-responses to physical exercise. The responses are, however, slightly influenced presumably by the beta-agonist activity of pindolol.", 
    "49": "The present study was designed to determine whether abnormalities in serotonin receptor binding co-exist with the presynaptic serotonergic deficits that have previously been identified in the genetically epilepsy-prone rat (GEPR) brain. In vitro binding of [3H]8-OH-DPAT (0.16-10.3 nM) to 5-HT1A receptor sites was found to be decreased in the hippocampus of severe seizure GEPRs (GEPR-9s) when compared to nonepileptic control rats, while no difference in [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding was observed in the GEPR-9 corpora quadrigemina or midbrain tegmentum. The decreased binding of [3H]8-OH-DPAT to hippocampal membranes was due to a decrease in Bmax (P < 0.001), rather than to a change in the Kd. Conversely, in vitro binding of [125I]cyanopindolol (2-400 pM) to 5-HT1B receptor sites was increased in the GEPR-9 hippocampus, corpora quadrigemina and midbrain tegmentum when compared to nonepileptic control rats. The increased binding of [125I]cyanopindolol in all three regions resulted from an increase in the Bmax (P < 0.05), rather than a change in the Kd. These finding suggest that in addition to the innate reduction in 5-HT presynaptic markers, GEPR-9s also exhibit abnormalities in the density of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors in some regions of the brain. Inasmuch as serotonin acts to attenuate audiogenic seizures in GEPRs, these abnormalities in 5-HT receptor binding may contribute to the seizure susceptibility exhibited by these animals.",

The availability of PBL from both POAG and control patients makes this a useful system for studying the association of decreased 3 alpha-HSD activity with POAG. PBL were isolated from the venous blood of 17 POAG patients and 22 non-glaucoma controls and assayed for 3 alpha-HSD activity with tritiated 5 beta-dihydrocortisol as a substrate. The mean 3 alpha-HSD activity +/- S.E.M., expressed in comparable units of specific activity, of the POAG derived PBL was 13.8 +/- 1.3 U as compared to 32.8 +/- 2.0 U for control cells. This reduction (> 50%) was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Quantitative immunoblot analysis of PBL indicated that the POAG and control cells, despite their difference in 3 alpha-HSD activity, had nearly identical amounts of 3 alpha-HSD protein. The molecular weight of PBL 3 alpha-HSD from both groups of patients was 38,000, the same as previously reported for human liver. The results of this study show an association of decreased PBL 3 alpha-HSD activity and POAG which was not related to antiglaucoma therapy. The reduced levels of 3 alpha-HSD activity in the readily obtainable PBL may serve as a marker for POAG or those at risk for developing the disease.", 
    "78": "Rats are resistant to Toxoplasma infection, and in contrast to mice do not form cysts in their tissues. Because rats treated with beta adrenergics, corticosteroids or 60cobalt are more susceptible to toxoplasmosis, we conducted experiments to investigate if the impaired resistance of drug-treated rats is related to macrophage function or induction of cystogenic capacity. Our experiments in 0.7 or 1.2 mg/kg-corticosteroid or 12 Gy-60cobalt-treated rats indicated that the decreased survival rate (P < 0.001 to P < 0.0001, compared to infected-untreated or infected-unirradiated animals) was associated with a decrease of both macrophage toxoplasmastatic activity and intracellular killing (P < 0.05 each group), compared to infected-untreated or infected-unirradiated rats. However in 9 Gy-60cobalt-treated animals the decreased survival rate (P < 0.001, compared with control rats) was accompanied only by a decrease of the toxoplasmastatic activity in comparison to macrophages of the control animals. Moreover in these animals, the release of NO2- by these macrophages was poorly detectable (P < 0.05) or completely inhibited (P < 0.01) in comparison with infected-untreated or infected-unirradiated rats. In contrast, in all groups of rats treated with high doses of beta adrenergic, the decreased survival (P < 0.001 to P < 0.0001, compared with untreated rats) was accompanied by values of intracellular killing and intracellular proliferation of Toxoplasma parasites that did not significantly (P = ns each group) differ from macrophages of infected-untreated rats. Furthermore in the high beta adrenergic treated groups only small amounts of NO2- were detectable (P < 0.05) in comparison with control animals. In addition, our data in rats treated with 0.7 or 1.2 mg/kg of corticosteroid or 12 Gy of 60cobalt indicated that the increased mortality was correlated to the presence of a small number of cysts in their brains (P < 0.05; P = ns; P < 0.01 respectively) in comparison to infected-untreated or infected-unirradiated rats. These results suggest that the susceptibility of drug-immunosuppressed rats is not due exclusively to a deficient macrophage function, but is probably also linked to immune mechanisms involved in the process of cystogenesis.", 
    "79": "These experiments examined the involvement of the amygdaloid complex as a site of interaction of adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic influences on memory storage. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (60 days old; 250-300 g) were given a single training trial in an inhibitory avoidance task and a retention test trial 48 h later. Immediately after training buffer control or drug solutions (0.5 microliter) were infused into the amygdala and, in the first experiment only, other drugs were administered intraperitoneally (ip). The first experiment examined the effects of post-training systemic injections of the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine (100.0 micrograms/kg) administered alone or together with intraamygdala injections of either the muscarinic antagonist atropine (1.0 microgram) or the beta-noradrenergic antagonist propranolol (0.3 microgram). Oxotremorine enhanced retention and atropine, but not propranolol, attenuated the effects of oxotremorine. In the second experiment intraamygdala infusions of the beta-noradrenergic agonist clenbuterol (10.0 ng) were administered either alone or together with atropine (1.0 microgram). Clenbuterol enhanced retention and atropine blocked the effects of clenbuterol. In the third experiment intraamygdala infusions of oxotremorine (3, 10, 30, or 100 ng) were administered either alone or together with propranolol (0.3 microgram). Oxotremorine (3.0 and 10.0 ng) enhanced retention and propranolol did not block the effects of oxotremorine. These findings are consistent with the view that memory storage is regulated by an interaction of beta-noradrenergic and cholinergic influences and suggest that the noradrenergic influences are mediated by the release of acetylcholine and activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors within the amygdala.", 
    "80": "The present study demonstrated that calcium ions were accumulated in nuclei of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells after arsenite treatment.

In contrast, ethylene glycol-bis[beta-aminoethylether] N,N, N1,N1,-tetraacetic acid (EGTA, a calcium-specific chelator), or calcium-free conditions significantly reduced the cytotoxicity or arsenite. Similarly, the strategy of lowering extracellular calcium concentration by modifying the medium or lowering intracellular calcium concentration by administration of the intracellular calcium chelator quin 2, protected cells from arsenite-induced micronuclei formation. These data indicate that the disturbances in intracellular calcium homeostasis maybe involved in arsenite-induced cytotoxicity and micronuclei formation.",

Both norepinephrine and the beta 3-specific adrenergic agonist CGP-12177 induced a high rate of nonshivering thermogenesis. However, neither CGP-12177 nor other beta 3-selective agonists (BRL-37344, ICI-D7114) could induce nonshivering thermogenesis fully to the extent induced by norepinephrine. It was further observed that an apparent \"thermogenic refractoriness\" was induced by certain adrenergic agents (isoprenaline, CGP-12177) but not by others (norepinephrine, BRL-37344, ICI-D7114).

Concomitantly, Ep of the ascending aorta decreased with cilazapril from a median of 2,234 10(3)dyn/cm2 (interquartile range, 866-3,740) to 868 10(3)dyn/cm2 (515-1,486) and with atenolol from a median of 1,611 10(3)dyn/cm2 (895-2,790) to 1,054 10(3)dyn/cm2 (616-1,860). In repeated-measurements analysis of variance, the change in Ep with time was statistically significant (p < 0.001) but the group x time interaction was not. We conclude that 6 months of treatment with either cilazapril or atenolol reduces the stiffness of the ascending aorta in essential hypertension. No statistically significant differences between the effects of the two drugs were observed. The mechanisms and clinical significance of improved aortic distensibility with antihypertensive therapy deserve further study.", 
    "94": "We investigated the mechanism of vascular relaxation produced by dobutamine, a positive inotropic agent with beta 1-adrenergic action. Dobutamine concentration-dependently (10 nM-10 microM) relaxed ring segments of rabbit aorta partially precontracted with 1 microM phenylephrine (PE) but did not relax those precontracted with 40 mM K+ or 5 microM prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). The relaxation was not completely inhibited by pretreatment with 10 microM propranolol. Dobutamine did not significantly increase tissue cyclic AMP levels concomitantly with relaxation as does isoproterenol (ISO) in rabbit aorta. Dobutamine produced a parallel rightward shift in concentration-response curves to PE. The Schild plot analysis resulted in a linear regression of a slope of 1.077 +/- 0.077, which was not significantly different from unity. The pA2 value of dobutamine as compared with PE in rabbit aorta was 6.81 +/- 0.03. Dobutamine causes arterial dilatation mediated not only through a beta-adrenergic action but also through an alpha-adrenergic blocking action in rabbit aorta.", 
    "95": "The secretion of melatonin by the pineal has been promoted as a direct monitor of adrenergic function in depressive illness. However, discrepant findings have been reported, possibly reflecting a complex adrenergic regulation of pineal output. In order to clarify the anatomical localization and relative density of beta-adrenergic receptors and their subtypes in human pineal, quantitative autoradiographic analysis was conducted of beta-adrenergic receptors in postmortem specimens using the high affinity radioligand 125I-pindolol. Dense specific binding was found throughout the gland. beta 1 -adrenergic receptors were more numerous, but beta 2-receptors were present in an overlapping anatomical distribution with beta 1-receptors.", 
    "96": "Several findings suggest that serotonin dysfunction may play at least a partial role in the etiology of social phobia. The cortisol response to fenfluramine, a serotonin agonist, is enhanced in patients with social phobia. Serotonin may be a common denominator between the blushing commonly seen in social phobics and the cutaneous flushing occurring in patients with carcinoid syndrome, although this is unlikely. Drugs that have demonstrated effectiveness in social phobia include the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), clonazepam (a benzodiazepine that potentiates serotonin function and synthesis), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (which block the oxidative deamination of serotonin), and beta-adrenoceptor blockers (which control the synthesis of melatonin from serotonin). A variety of beta-blockers, some acting centrally and some peripherally, have been effective in the treatment of performance anxiety, a specific form of social phobia.", 
    "97": "The effects of a single instillation of 2% carteolol or 0.1% dipivefrine on the tissue circulation in the human optic nerve head (ONH) was studied using a laser speckle tissue circulation analyser in 12 healthy volunteers. In the first experiment, normalized blur (NB), a quantitative index of peripheral blood velocity, was measured every 0.125 sec in an area located in the temporal site of ONH free of visible surface vessels and averaged over 5 pulses (mean NB) in both eyes before, 1.5, 3, and 4.5 hours after a 30 microliters instillation of placebo to serve as a control. Intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure (BP), and pulse rate (PR) were also measured. In the second experiment, a 30 microliters drop of 2% carteolol (n = 6) or 0.1% dipivefrine (n = 7) was instilled in one randomly chosen eye and the placebo for each drug in the other eye, and the above parameters were measured according to the same time schedule as in the first experiment in a double masked manner. After topical carteolol, carteolol concentration in the plasma (CC) was also measured. In the control experiments, none of the parameters showed any significant change. After topical carteolol, the IOP was significantly lower between 1.5 and 4.5 hrs in the carteolol-treated eyes and at 1.5 and 4.5 hrs in the fellow eyes as compared with that obtained in the control experiment. The mean NB was significantly higher at 3 hrs (23.1%) in carteolol-treated eyes, and at 3 hrs (17.2%) in the fellow eyes, as compared with that obtained in the control experiment (p < 0.05). BP and PR showed little change. The maximum CC at 3 hrs averaged 522 pg/ml. Thus a single instillation of carteolol may increase the tissue blood velocity in ONH in the human eye. After topical dipivefrine, the IOP was significantly lower at 4.5 hr in the dipivefrine-treated eyes than that obtained in the control experiment (p < 0.05). Mean NB, BP and PR showed no significant change.", 
    "98": "Protacyclin biosynthesis was investigated in 133 untreated newly diagnosed patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. Urinary excretion of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha and of 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha, stable breakdown products of prostacyclin, was measured following a 1 month run-in period. To determine whether lowering blood pressure (BP) influenced prostacyclin biosynthesis, 106 consenting patients with diastolic pressure 90-120 mm Hg were allocated randomly to treatment with bendrofluazide, metoprolol, quinapril or amlodipine in an open parallel group design. Dose was increased to reduce diastolic arterial pressure to <90 mm Hg. Terazosin was added if this target BP was not achieved, and its dose increased if necessary. Urinary excretion rates of prostaglandins were measured after 1 year in patients in whom the target diastolic pressure was achieved. Mean arterial pressure varied from 106-168 mm Hg in untreated patients and excretion of both prostacyclin-derived products varied from <5 to >350 ng/g creatinine. Arterial pressure and prostaglandin excretion were not significantly correlated. In 57 patients in whom target pressure was achieved, BP before treatment was 166 +/- 2/100 +/- 1 at baseline and 144 +/- 2/86 +/- 1 mm Hg at 1 year. Excretion rates of each prostacyclin-derived product were similar before treatment and at 1 year, with no significant differences between the drugs. These findings do not support the hypothesis that deficient prostacyclin biosynthesis contributes to the pathogenesis of essential hypertension, or that increased prostacyclin biosynthesis plays a part in the response to treatment with antihypertensive medication.", 
    "99": "In chickens CCK-8s induces defecation and causes an inhibition of rectal electrical activity (EA) and an increase in cecal motility. In contrast, CCK-4 inhibits the motility of both rectum and ceca. The cecorectal responses to CCK-8s and CCK-4, given intravenously (i.v.), were studied in conscious chickens prepared with electrodes for electromyography; the influence of atropine, phentolamine plus propranolol, hexamethonium and L-NAME on such responses was determined. Atropine and phentolamine plus propranolol did not cause any change in the response to CCK-8s or CCK-4 in the cecorectal area. Hexamethonium only induced a significant decrease in the number of defecations (ND) induced by CCK-8s. L-NAME slightly modified the decrease in rectal EA due to CCK-8s. The effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of CCK-8s and CCK-4 were also studied. CCK-8s and CCK-4, given i.c.v., caused, in conscious chickens, a slight decrease in cecal EA, in the 15 minutes following administration. This effect was similar to that seen after i.v. administration of CCK-4. In conclusion, our results suggest that the inhibitory action of CCK on chicken rectum is mediated, at least in part, through nitric oxide release. In addition, nicotinic receptors mediate the increase in the ND caused by CCK-8s. Ganglionic, muscarinic, adrenergic and nitrergic blockade were not able to modify the excitatory cecal response to CCK-8s, which may indicate that the receptor mediating this effect is located on the cecal smooth muscle. Finally, the inhibitory action of i.v. CCK-4 on chicken cecum seems to be centrally mediated, as suggested by the fact that i.c.v. administration of either CCK-8s or CCK-4 induce a similar effect.", 
    "100": "Effects of long-term therapy with beta 1-selective antagonists (metoprolol, bisoprolol) on beta-adrenoceptors in lymphocytes of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) were examined. There was a significant reduction in the number of lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors in patients with DCM compared to that in healthy volunteers, as demonstrated by a selective decrease in maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) for (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol (CYP). A therapy with metoprolol and bisoprolol in these patients caused a marked increase in lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor density. The significant increase was observed from 2 or 3 months after the start of therapy with these drugs, and it was maintained during the therapy for 24 months. The left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with DCM was improved by the long-term therapy with metoprolol and bisoprolol, and this effect seems to be correlated with an observed enhancement of lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors in the time course. Also, the increase in lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors appears to be correlated with a gradual amelioration in circulating catecholamine levels by the long-term therapy with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in patients with DCM. Thus, the present study suggests that beta-adrenoceptors in lymphocytes of patients with DCM are up-regulated by a long-term therapy with metoprolol and bisoprolol.",

Although this promising and frequently controversial treatment is not accepted universally so far, partial data in the mentioned investigations indicate that when a more accurate dosage pattern is established and indications are specified in more detail, the use of beta-blockers is one way how to approach - in addition to the use of diuretics, cardiotonics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors - a comprehensive therapeutic control of chronic heart failure.",

All except ten patients from each group successfully completed the study.",

Comparing 6-month with baseline diurnal IOP values, the IOP reduction (mean +/- standard deviation) achieved with latanoprost (-6.7 +/- 3.4 mmHg) was significantly (P<0.001) greater than that produced with timolol (4.9 +/- 2.9 mmHg). Four patients treated with timolol and none treated with latanoprost were withdrawn from the study because of inadequate IOP control. Pulse rate was significantly reduced with timolol, but not with latanoprost. Slightly more conjunctival hyperemia appeared in latanoprost-treated compared with timolol-treated eyes. Fewer subjective side effects occurred in latanoprost-treated eyes. Both eyes of a patient with a characteristic, concentric iris heterochromia (darker centrally) at baseline showed a definite, photographically documented increase in pigmentation during latanoprost treatment, making the irides uniformly darker. Three additional patients treated with latanoprost were suspects for this color change. Otherwise, no significant difference between treatment groups occurred visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, blood pressure, and laboratory values.",

The primary objective of the study is to compare the IOP-reducing effect of lantanoprost with that of timolol at the end of the 6-month treatment period. A total of 294 patients were included: 149 were in the latanoprost group and 145 were in timolol group. Latanoprost was administered in the evening.",

No upward drift in IOP occurred with either drug during the treatment period. Latanoprost caused a somewhat more conjunctival hyperemia than timolol and more corneal punctuate epithelial erosions. However, both drugs were generally well tolerated. The most significant side effect of latanoprost was increased pigmentation of the iris which was observed in 15 patients (10.1%). Timolol caused more systemic side effects than latanoprost.",

    "113": "The role of adrenergic receptors in regulation of rat thymus type II thyroxine 5'-deiodinase (5'-D) activity was investigated. Our results show that norepinephrine, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist elicited an increase in thymus 5'-D activity. Isoproterenol, beta-adrenergic agonist, also increased the enzyme activity, being less effective than norepinephrine. Moreover, alpha-adrenergic agonists, i.e., methoxamine, an alpha1-agonist, and clonidine, an alpha2-agonist, did not increase 5'-D activity. The effect of isoproterenol was potentiated by methoxamine, but the potentiating effect was observed only at doses of isoproterenol which induce submaximal activation of the enzyme. Administration of propranolol, beta-adrenergic blocker, and prazosin, an alpha1-adrenergic blocker, inhibited significantly the activation of the enzyme induced by norepinephrine. However, yohimbine, an alpha2-adrenergic blocker, had small effect. These results show, in hypothyroid rats, a clear regulation by adrenergic mechanisms of 5'-D activity in the thymus, where alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors might be involved.",

At temporary study the mean (SD) left ventricular outflow tract gradient was 38 (24) mm Hg with a median (range) optimised sensed AV delay of 65 (25-125) ms. Fifty three patients were implanted and followed up for a mean (SD) of 11 (11) months. The median (range) programmed sensed AV delay was 60 (31-200) ms. Left ventricular outflow tract gradient at follow up was 36 (25) mm Hg. Forty four patients had improved functional class.

    "122": "This study examines the early effects of 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone on cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i in primary cultures of fetal rat hypothalamic neurons. Microspectrofluorimetry of fluorescent Ca2+(-)sensitive indicator Fura-2 was used to quantify these changes. Allopregnanolone (1 pM to 100 nM) increased [Ca2+]i within 2-3 sec, in a dose dependent manner, with an EC50 of 10 +/- 4 nM. The stimulatory effect of allopregnanolone was attributable principally to a Ca2+ influx, as shown by the strong inhibition of external Ca2+ removal or by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine. The effect was stereospecific because the allopregnanolone isomer 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one had no effect on [Ca2+]i. Among two other steroids examined, progesterone had no effect on [Ca2+]i, but 17 beta-estradiol evoked a rise in [Ca2+]i, although to a lesser extent than allopregnanolone. The allopregnanolone-induced [Ca2+]i rise was inhibited by picrotoxin and bicuculline but was unaffected by tetrodotoxin or by pretreatment of neurons with pertussis toxin. These results are consistent with a membrane site of action for allopregnanolone associated with GABAA receptors, leading to rapid changes in [Ca2+]i in fetal rat hypothalamic neurons.", 
    "123": "The ability of agents that increase or mimic cAMP to affect muscarinic receptor mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was investigated in the rat parotid gland. Forskolin (10 microM) and isoproterenol (10 microM) elevated cAMP in the parotid gland by 2-fold and 7-fold, respectively, and these agents also inhibited oxotremorine-M (3 microM) mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis by 14% and 26%, respectively. Forskolin (1, 4.3, 18, and 75 microM) increased cAMP accumulation and inhibited PIP2 hydrolysis in a concentration-dependent manner. Forskolin (75 micrometers) shifted the concentration-response curve for the full agonist oxotremorine-M rightward by 4.2-fold. Pre-treatment with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (1 mM) reduced the maximum effect of oxotremorine-M by 31%. The inhibitory effect of isoproterenol and forskolin on muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was unaffected by the removal of extracellular Ca2+. Moreover, isoproterenol and forskolin dampened sodium fluoride and oxotremorine-M mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis to the same extent suggesting that the inhibitory effect of cAMP is downstream from the muscarinic receptor.", 
    "124": "The aims of this study were to determine whether endothelin-1 (ET-1), a positive inotropic agent, altered the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in adult feline cardiac myocytes and to characterize the effect with respect to G-protein-coupling and calcium regulation of adenylyl cyclase. ET-1 inhibited basal and/or stimulated cAMP accumulation in the intact cardiac myocyte and in membrane preparations in a dose-dependent manner. In intact cells, maximal inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was 90-95% with an EC50 of 5 x 10(-10) M. Inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP was biphasic with maximal inhibition of 70% observed by 10(-11)M; at higher doses inhibition was not consistently observed. The inhibitory response to ET-1 occurred in the absence or presence of isobutylmethylxanthine suggesting that activation of cAMP phosphodiesterases was not the means for reducing cAMP levels. Prior exposure of cardiac myocytes to 100ng/ml pertussis toxin blocked the inhibitory action of ET-1, indicating that this response is mediated through the involvement of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein such as Gi. Studies carried out in the absence of extracellular calcium and under conditions of cell-loading with the intracellular calcium chelator, 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM), suggest that the mechanism by which ET-1 inhibits cAMP accumulation is not calcium-dependent. Thus, inhibition of cAMP accumulation by ET-1 appears to be mediated through a pertussis toxin sensitive protein rather than by activation of phosphodiesterases or calcium inhibition of cardiac forms of adenylyl cyclase. Though unlikely to play a role in the positive inotropic effect of ET-1, transduction of ET-1 responses through Gi suggests another means for regulation of growth in these adult cardiac myocytes.", 
    "125": "Increases in catecholamines have been shown to induce changes in migration of lymphocytes, in particular NK cells. To analyze the mechanisms of catecholamine-induced NK cell trafficking, normal healthy male human subjects and splenectomized individuals were infused with either adrenaline (0.10 microgram/kg/min), noradrenaline (0.15 microgram/kg/min), or NaCl i.v. for 20 min. Lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+) transiently increased after administration of both catecholamines, with most pronounced increases (up to 600%) in NK cell numbers (CD16+ or CD56+) after infusion of adrenaline. These changes in NK cell numbers and function were accompanied neither by alterations in expression of adhesion molecules (CD11a), CD11b, CD31, CD43, CD44, CD62L) on NK cells nor by changes in plasma concentrations of soluble (s) adhesion molecules (sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, sE-selectin). Comparable increases in lymphocyte subsets were observed in splenectomized subjects, suggesting lymphocyte recruitment from other sources than the spleen. Furthermore, catecholamine-induced increases in lymphocyte subsets could be inhibited by pretreatment with the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, but not by the beta1-selective antagonist bisoprolol. These data demonstrate that adrenaline and noradrenaline modulate the migratory capacity of human NK cells via spleen-independent beta 2-adrenoceptor mechanism.", 
    "126": "An enantioselective gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric assay is developed for alprenolol and its metabolite, 4-hydroxy-alprenolol, in saliva and plasma. The procedure is based on a two-step derivatization technique with N-heptafluorobutyryl-l-prolylchloride and N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide, followed by a gas chromatographic separation with mass spectrometric detection of the diastereomeric derivatives. A selected ion chromatogram extracted from full scan data shows that the respective enantiomers of alprenolol, 4-hydroxy-alprenolol, and the internal standard (ions at m/z 481) are well-separated in saliva and plasma. Linear and reproducible calibration curves are obtained over the concentration ranges 1.67-13.33 ng/mL and 2.50-20.00 ng/mL enantiomer in saliva and plasma, respectively. The performance of the method for alprenolol, in terms of accuracy and precision, fits well within the generally accepted criteria for validation. The enantioselective assay is successfully used in a study involving a single oral dose of alprenolol administered to two healthy volunteers. Stereoselective differences are observed in the saliva and plasma concentrations following an oral dose of 50 mg (R,S)-alprenolol hydrochloride.", 
    "127": "Conflicting results have been reported in literature about the influence of beta-adrenergic stimulation on the fast cardiac sodium current (INa+). To elucidate these mechanisms in multicellular preparations we used the loose-patch-clamp technique to evaluate the effect of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol 1-1000 nmol/l. Isoproterenol enhanced INa+ at all membrane potentials by elevation of the maximal available INa+ . Only at the high concentration of 1 micromol/l was INa+ slightly depressed after depolarizing conditioning clamps. The most marked increase of the maximal available INa+ was 30+/-9% after application of 100 nmol/l isoproterenol. To learn about the mechanisms in view of sodium channel modulation we combined isoproterenol with the sodium channel blocker lidocaine (47 micromol/l). Under these circumstances the effects of both drugs were completely independent. This investigation shows clearly that low concentrations of isoproterenol increase INa+ in multicellular preparations by a gating-independent mechanism.", 
    "128": "beta3-Adrenergic-stimulated thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is diminished with age. beta3-Adrenergic receptors are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase in BAT. To determine whether thermo- genesis, in response to direct activation of adenylyl cyclase, is also impaired with age, we examined whole body oxygen consumption, mitochondrial guanosine diphosphate (GDP) binding and BAT mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UPC) mRNA levels in 4- and 24-month-old F-344 rats following forskolin administration. We also examined the forskolin-induced change in body temperature in 4-month-old rats. In some instances, the results were compared with administration of the specific beta3-adrenergic agonist, CGP-12177. Forskolin (3.5 mg/kg) increased oxygen consumption but decreased body temperature. In subsequent experiments the BAT was unilaterally denervated. In these rats, the forskolin-(1.8 mg/kg) stimulated increase in oxygen consumption was similar in young and old rats. Forskolin increased GDP binding and UCP mRNA levels in both the denervated and innervated BAT pads. The increases were equal or greater in the BAT from senescent rats. These findings, coupled with our previous report of an impaired CGP-12177-stimulated increase in GDP binding in senescent rats, suggests beta3-adrenergic-stimulated, but not post-receptor-stimulated, thermogenesis is diminished with age.", 
    "129": "The SS-enantiomer 3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahy dronaphth-1-ylaminol]-(2S)-2-propanol oxalate (SR 59230A) is proposed to be the first beta 3-adrenergic receptor antagonist. The present work shows that SR 59230A, unlike its inactive RR-enantiomer (SR 59483), antagonized a typical beta 3-adrenergic response in vitro, i.e., SR 58611A, the ethyl-[(7s)-7-[[(2R)-2-(3- chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxethyl]amino]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphth- 2- yl]oxyacetate hydrochloride- or (-)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)benzimidazol-2-one (CGP 12177)-stimulated synthesis of cAMP in rat brown adipose tissue membranes, with pKB values of 8.87 +/- 0.12 and 8.20 +/- 0.15. In addition, SR 59230A had no antagonistic effect on forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in rat interscapular brown adipose tissue. SR 59230A, in contrast to the selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists (+/-)[2-(3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxyphenoxy)-ethylamino]- 3-[4(1-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)-phenoxy]-2 propanol and erythro-(+/-)-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminob utan- 2-ol-hydrochloride did not counteract the cAMP production induced by (-)-isoprenaline or norepinephrine (NE) in rat brain areas rich in beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors, such as frontal cortex and cerebellum. Moreover, in proliferating brown fat cells, in which the beta 1-adrenoceptor is the only beta-adrenergic subtype coupled to cAMP production, SR 59230A did not modify the production of cAMP induced by NE, whereas CGP 12177 did. In confluent brown fat cells, in which the beta 3-adrenoceptor is the functional beta-adrenergic subtype coupled to adenylyl cyclase, SR 59230A antagonized the NE-induced cAMP accumulation and glycerol release without affecting their basal values, whereas CGP 12177, which per se stimulated cAMP accumulation and glycerol release, did not change the NE-induced increase of either parameter. Finally, SR 59230A concentration-dependently counteracted the NE-stimulated synthesis of uncoupling protein gene in confluent brown fat cells, which is considered mainly a result of selective stimulation of beta 3-adrenoceptors. These results provide evidence that the new selective beta 3-adrenoceptor antagonist can contribute considerably to functional characterization of the beta 3-adrenoceptors.", 
    "130": "Although the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (-)-propranolol binds with relatively low affinity at human 5-hydroxytryptamine1D beta receptors (Ki = 10,200 nM), it displays significantly higher affinity (Ki = 17 nM) at its species homolog, 5-HT1B receptors, and at a mutant 5-HT1D beta receptor (Ki = 16 nM), where the threonine residue at position 355 (T355) is replaced with an asparagine residue (i.e., a T355N mutant). Propranolol contains two oxygen atoms, an ether oxygen atom and a hydroxyl oxygen atom, and it has been speculated that the enhanced affinity of propranolol for the T355N mutant receptor is related to the ability of the asparagine residue to hydrogen bond with the ether oxygen atom. However, the specific involvement of the propranolol oxygen atoms in binding to the wild-type and T355N mutant 5-HT1D beta receptors has never been addressed experimentally. A modification of a previously described 5-HT1D beta receptor graphic model was mutated by replacement of T355 with asparagine. Propranolol was docked with the wild-type and T355N mutant 5-HT1D beta receptor models in an attempt to understand the difference in affinity of the ligand for the receptors. The binding models suggest that the asparagine residue of the mutant receptor can form hydrogen bonds with both oxygen atoms of propranolol, whereas the threonine moiety of the wild-type receptor can hydrogen-bond only to one oxygen atom. To test this hypothesis, we prepared and examined several analogues of propranolol that lacked either one or both oxygen atoms. The results of radioligand binding experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that both oxygen atoms of propranolol could participate in binding to the mutant receptor, whereas only the ether oxygen atom participates in binding to the wild-type receptor. As such, this is the first investigation of serotonin receptors that combines the use of molecular modeling, mutant receptors generated by site-directed mutagenesis, and synthesis to investigate structure/affinity relationships.", 
    "131": "The relaxation of tracheal smooth muscle by the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) agonist salmeterol displays several unusual properties: (i) slow onset of action (t1/2 = 5-15 min), (ii) prolonged activation (t1/2 = 8-14 hr), and (iii) the ability to recover from beta AR blockade. These properties led to the hypothesis that salmeterol binds with very high affinity to an exosite in addition to the beta AR activating site. Despite extensive characterization of salmeterol-induced bronchodilation, little is known about the molecular actions of salmeterol. We report the unique properties of salmeterol binding to the beta AR, activation of adenylyl cyclase, and desensitization of the hamster beta AR expressed in L cells. First, we found that salmeterol activation of adenylyl cyclase, although rapid and potent (low EC50 relative to epinephrine), was nevertheless remarkably inefficient relative to the full agonist epinephrine. Reduced coupling efficiency of salmeterol was demonstrated using formulations recently introduced by our group. Second, we found that pretreatment of L cells with salmeterol led to a stable activation of adenylyl cyclase that survives extensive wash procedures and sucrose step gradient purification of plasma membrane fractions. This activation of basal adenylyl cyclase did not require salmeterol binding to the classic active site during pretreatment, as it occurred in the presence of an excess of a beta AR antagonist. Third, we found that the rapid phase of salmeterol-induced desensitization was much reduced relative to epinephrine, consistent with its poor coupling efficiency and with its prolonged activation of adenylyl cyclase. These unique properties of salmeterol support the proposal that it binds reversibly to the activating or active site and as well to an extremely high affinity exosite from which it has access to the active site.",

Conditions were tightly controlled so that calculated VO2 would be as accurate as possible. \"True\" VO2 was measured simultaneously with a water-sealed spirometer (spirometry VO2). Calculated VO2 and spirometry VO2 were determined and analyzed during the four physiologic states listed above. Pooled data also were evaluated. Mean spirometry VO2 and calculated VO2 differed significantly during all four physiologic states and when data were pooled (spirometry VO2 273 +/- 70, calculated VO2 178 +/- 58 mL/min; p < .01). Calculated VO2 consistently underestimated spirometry VO2, as demonstrated by the large, positive bias in pooled data (95 +/- 59 mL of oxygen/min) and in the four physiologic states. Linear regression of data from all four states yielded slopes that were indistinguishable from 1, but y intercepts that varied from -152 to +182. For pooled data, the following equation was used: calculated VO2 = 0.5 x (spirometry VO2 + 46); r2 = .35. Precision in pooled data was 22% of the mean spirometry VO2. Data analysis for the four physiologic states demonstrated results similar to those results obtained when data were pooled.",

If true VO2 changes, the magnitude and direction of change will be reflected by calculated VO2 but with approximately 20% error in the absolute value. Heart failure, acute lung injury, and their combination did not affect the accuracy of calculated VO2. Therefore, calculating VO2 using the Fick relationship is too inaccurate to be used for research purposes. Because assessment of the directional change of VO2 may be clinically useful, calculated VO2 can be employed with discretion during clinical oxygen transport evaluation, bearing in mind the calculation's inherent imprecision.",

Basal and stimulated concentrations of second messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), were also assessed. Production of cAMP during isoproterenol stimulation tested the integrity of the beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated signal transduction. Forskolin, which stimulates adenylate cyclase enzyme directly (bypassing the receptor and G protein) to produce cAMP, tested the efficacy of the enzyme itself. Maximal binding capacity was unaltered between the experimental and control groups, but the affinity (mean +/- SEM) was significantly decreased in burned animals at 7 days (125.4 +/- 15.5 picomoles [pmol]; p = .01) and at 14 days (216.7 +/- 50.7 pmol; p = .001) compared with controls (75.5 +/- 8.4 pmol).

    "146": "To assess the efficacy and safety of current pharmacologic therapy for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in infants, we reviewed 112 infants treated between July 1985 and March 1993. The SVT mechanism was determined by esophageal electrophysiologic study and involved an accessory pathway in 86, atrioventricular (AV) node reentry in 10, atrial muscle reentry in 11, and an ectopic atrial tachycardia in 5 patients. Of six infants not treated, none had clinical recurrences of SVT. Of the 106 patients treated, 70% remained free of tachycardia while receiving digoxin, propranolol, or both. Class I antiarrhythmic agents were necessary for 13 patients, and class III agents were required for another 13 infants. Verapamil was used in one infant with AV node reentry tachycardia. Nine infants with complex clinical presentations were believed to have failed medical management and underwent radiofrequency ablation. Five patients died, four of complications related to structural heart disease and one shortly after radiofrequency ablation was performed. No deaths appeared to be related to antiarrhythmic medications. No drug-related side effects requiring medication change occurred, and no proarrhythmia was observed. Thus medical therapy appears to be effective and safe in infants with SVT. Radiofrequency ablation should be reserved for rare infants who fail aggressive medical regimens or when the situation is complicated by ventricular dysfunction, severe symptoms, or complex congenital heart disease.",

Testing included Holter monitoring (91% had VT), exercise test (69% had VT), Adrenergic responsiveness of VT was graded according to diurnal variation, response to exercise, isoproterenol infusion, and response to beta-blockers. beta-Blockers were effective and well tolerated in this population. There was also a predictable relation between changing adrenergic tone and the arrhythmia response to beta-blocker therapy.",

The authors assessed autonomic system activity by power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability in 21 elderly hypertensive men with and without angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease and compared the results with those from an age-matched control group. In the analysis an autoregressive algorithm was used to determine the power spectrum from an electrocardiographic recording of 512 consecutive RR intervals. The autonomic nervous system induces two distinct sinusoids: a low-frequency signal attributable to sympathetic activity and a high-frequency vagal response. In the hypertensive patients with coronary disease the authors also evaluated sympathetic activation after double-blind, placebo-controlled administration of metoprolol (100 mg/day), followed by amlodipine (10 mg/day), quinapril (20 mg/day), and amlodipine (5 mg/day) plus quinapril (10 mg/day).", 
    "149": "Beta blockers modify cardiovascular neural regulation, which may contribute to their protective effect against sudden cardiac death. To evaluate the effects of beta blockade on cardiovascular autonomic reactions caused by acute coronary occlusion in humans, heart rate (HR) variability was analyzed in the time and frequency domains immediately before and during balloon occlusion of a coronary artery in 116 patients randomly assigned to either chronic beta-blocker therapy (beta-blocker group) or no beta blockade (control group) during elective 1-vessel coronary angioplasty. Coronary occlusion (mean 112 seconds) caused a significant increase in both the high- and low-frequency components of HR variability in the control group (n = 58), from 2.7 +/- 1.6 to 3.4 +/- 1.7 (logarithmic units, p < 0.001) and from 4.3 +/- 1.3 to 4.8 +/- 1.5 (p < 0.01), respectively, whereas in the beta-blocker group (n = 58), the high-frequency power did not change during occlusion, but the low-frequency power increased from 3.9 +/- 1.4 to 4.4 +/- 1.4 (p = 0.01). Changes in high- and low-frequency components and HR were related to the change in systolic blood pressure during occlusion in the beta-blocker group (r = 0.53, p < 0.001; r = 0.34, p < 0.05; and r = -0.41, p < 0.01, respectively), but not in the control group (r = -0.17, r = -0.14, and r = 0.24, respectively). Thus, beta blockade attenuates the initial vagal activation associated with acute coronary occlusion and seems to maintain baroreflex-mediated cardiovascular control. The maintained integrity of baroreflex regulation and the alleviation of extreme autonomic reactions during beta blockade may modify the clinical outcome of acute coronary occlusion in a beneficial way.", 
    "150": "Several members of the neurotrophin (NT) family, including nerve growth factor (NGF), NT-3, and NT-4/5, are expressed in the mammalian ovary. As their respective receptor tyrosine kinases are also found in the gland, the possibility exists that NTs act directly on the gonads to exert effects unrelated to their support of the ovarian innervation. We now report that trkA, the NGF receptor tyrosine kinase, is involved in the acute activational process that leads to the first ovulation. The trkA gene becomes transiently expressed in periovulatory follicules at the time of the first preovulatory surge of gonadotropins at puberty; the increase in trkA messenger RNA (mRNA) content is dramatic ( > 100-fold), but transient (approximately 9 h). No such changes in trkB or trkC mRNA were observed; the abundance of these mRNAs, which encode the receptor tyrosine kinase for NT-4/5 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and NT-3, respectively, remained at very low levels throughout puberty. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that the activation of trkA gene expression is brought about by the proestrous discharge of LH. The increase in trkA mRNA levels is mainly localised to cells of the follicular wall and interstitial tissue of the ovary. NGF mRNA abundance also increases at proestrus, with peak values detected about 5 h before ovulation; as in the case of trkA mRNA, NGF mRNA was found in thecal-interstitial cells. Both trkA and NGF protein, detected by immunohistochemistry, were localized to this same ovarian compartment. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), a putative mediator of LH action, enhances both trkA and NGF gene expression in ovarian cells, an effect prevented by IL-1ra, a natural IL-1 beta receptor antagonist. Il-1 beta also stimulates PGE2 release, and this effect was inhibited by both NGF antibodies and a trk receptor blocker, NGF antibodies administered in vivo attenuated the increase in ovarian PGE2 synthesis that antedates ovulation. Immunoneutralization of NGF action or pharmacological blockade of trk tyrosine kinase activity targeted to one ovary resulted in the ipsilateral inhibition of ovulation. The remarkably narrow time frame of trkA gene activation at the completion of follicular growth suggests that NGF acting as a neuroendocrinotrophic factor in a developmentally restricted manner contributes to the acute cytodifferentiation process that leads to the first ovulation in mammals.",

    "156": "Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells oxidize low-density lipoproteins (LDL), assessed as increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substance formation and oxidized LDL-induced cytotoxicity (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release). Endothelial cell-generated oxidized also enhances the adhesiveness of endothelial cells to monocytes. Carvedilol, a new vasodilating beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibits the oxidation of LDL by endothelial cells and reduces oxidized LDL-induced LDH release from endothelial cells in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 2.56 and 1.38 microM, respectively. Moreover, carvedilol inhibits oxidized LDL-induced adhesion of monocytes to the endothelial cells in a similar concentration-dependent manner. Under the same conditions, propranolol, atenolol, pindolol and labetalol had only weak or no consistent effects on both LDL oxidation by endothelial cells and adhesion of monocytes to the endothelial cells. Monoclonal antibodies against human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) or E-selectin (ELAM-1) partially blocked oxidized LDL-stimulated adhesion of endothelial cells to monocytes. The inhibitory effects of carvedilol on LDL oxidation and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells may protect blood vessels from atherosclerotic processes associated with oxidized LDL-induced injuries.", 
    "157": "Numerous studies have clearly shown that the turnover and release of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) are increased under acute stressful conditions. Inasmuch as this latter process is under the control of a feedback mechanism involving the stimulation of presynaptic 5-HT1B autoreceptors, we have investigated the possible effects of acute restraint (40 min) on the functional properties of 5-HT1B receptors. The efficacy of the selective 5-HT1B receptor agonist 3-[1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyrid-4-yl]pyrrolo-[3,2-b]pyrid-5-one (CP-93,129) in inhibiting in vitro the K+-evoked release of [3H]5-HT, was significantly reduced in stressed rats as compared to naive animals. Similarly, the responsiveness of 5-HT1B receptors inhibiting the release of [3H]acetylcholine (presynaptic 5-HT1B heteroreceptors), was reduced by restraint. These effects were observed in the hippocampus, but using the inhibitory effect of CP-93,129 on forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity as an index of 5-HT1B receptor function, it could be shown that the 5-HT1B receptors located in the substantia nigra are also desensitized by stress. The number as well as the apparent affinity constant of 5-HT1B binding sites labelled by [125I]iodocyanopindolol, as measured by quantitative autoradiography and membrane binding, were similar in naive and restraint-stressed rats suggesting that the stress-induced desensitization of 5-HT1B receptors is not due to a reduced number of 5-HT1B binding sites. As stress is thought to be a causal factor for the etiology of anxiety and depression, these results support the potential involvement of 5-HT1B receptor dysfunction in the development of these neurological disorders.", 
    "158": "An overview of the 17 completed randomised trials of antihypertensive treatment demonstrates that a 5-6 mm Hg reduction in DBP reduced stroke risk by 38% (SD 4) and CHD risk by 16% (SD 4). These results indicate that a few years' treatment with diuretic- or beta-blocker-based therapy produces most or all of the long-term stroke avoidance and much of the long-term CHD avoidance that would be predicted from observational epidemiological studies, given the blood pressure reductions that were achieved in the trials. The relative risk reductions were similar in trials of older and younger patients, although the absolute reduction in events was more than twice as great in the trials in older patients. From these results it can be estimated that in fully compliant patients at similar risk of vascular disease to those included in the trials, antihypertensive treatment for 5 years would prevent one major vascular event among every 20 older patients and one major vascular event among every 60 younger patients. Obviously the benefits of treatment will be greater among those at higher risk than the patients included in the previous trials. The greatest benefits are likely to be achieved in those with a history of vascular disease since their risk of future events is particularly high. Among such patients it is possible that blood pressure reduction will confer worthwhile benefits in those without hypertension, as well as those with hypertension. It is also possible that the benefits of treatment will be determined by the size of the blood pressure reduction and by the choice of the anti-hypertensive agent. However, each of these possibilities requires confirmation in large scale randomised controlled trials.", 
    "159": "In studies of isometric contractions in prostatic portions of rat vas deferens evoked by single pulse electrical stimulation, the K+ channel blockers 4-aminopyridine, tetraethylammonium and charybdotoxin, but not apamin, significantly reduced the prejunctional inhibitory potency and the maximum inhibitory effect of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist xylazine. The protein kinase C activator phorbol dibutyrate had similar effects to 4-aminopyridine against xylazine. However, 4-aminopyridine, tetraethylammonium, charybdotoxin and phorbol dibutyrate, but not apamin, significantly increased the magnitude of the isometric contraction to a single stimulus. 4-Aminopyridine and phorbol dibutyrate significantly reduced, while tetraethylammonium did not affect, isometric contractions to noradrenaline, and 4-aminopyridine failed to affect contractions to alpha,beta-methylene-ATP, so that the effects of these agents on the isometric contraction to a single stimulus were presumably by a prejunctional action. The Ca2+ entry facilitator Bay K 8644 (1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-[2-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]-3-pyrid ine carboxylic acid methylester) increased stimulation-evoked contractions by a postjunctional action and reduced the inhibitory effects of xylazine. When the isometric contraction following 4-aminopyridine was reduced by decreasing the stimulation voltage or by reducing the Ca2+ concentration from 2.5 to 0.9 mM, 4-aminopyridine significantly reduced the potency of xylazine. However, tetraethylammonium and Bay K 8644 failed to affect the inhibitory potency of xylazine in low Ca2+. It is concluded that the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine reduces the prejunctional inhibitory potency of xylazine, and this action is independent of increased neurotransmitter release. These results suggest that prejunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition in rat vas deferens involves K+ channels sensitive to block by 4-aminopyridine."
