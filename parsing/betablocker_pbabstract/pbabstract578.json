It is shown that nitroglycerin increases the contractility of the border zone and decreases the compensatory hyperfunction of intact myocardial zones. Obsidan reduces the contractility of all the zones and adrenaline suppresses the border zone contractility despite the marked growth of contractile function of the intact zones and of the heart on the whole. The central-ischemic myocardial zone responded weakly to drug action.", 
    "1": "Eighteen patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia underwent serial electrophysiological studies to establish the therapeutic efficacy of sotalol as compared to other available anti-arrhythmic agents. One or more acutely effective drug was found in 14 of the 18 patients (78%). Sotalol was tested in all 18 patients and was effective in 12 of them (67%). For assessment of the prophylactic efficacy of other anti-arrhythmic agents, an average of 3.5 additional studies per patient were performed resulting in successful prevention of ventricular tachycardia in a total of 10 of 63 (16%) additional trials. Nine patients were placed on chronic oral therapy with sotalol. In these nine patients long-term prophylaxis against ventricular tachycardia was documented over a mean follow-up period of 9.6 months (range 2-18 months). The study suggests that sotalol can provide effective prophylaxis against ventricular tachycardia in a significant proportion of patients refractory to other available drugs and that this prophylactic efficacy is predominantly due to its Class III anti-arrhythmic properties. Experimental studies were performed in eight conscious dogs 3-7 days following proximal LAD ligation. Epicardial recordings were obtained using implanted composite electrodes. Sotalol prevented sustained VT by a predominant increase in refractoriness of the infarcted zone. In vitro, sotalol caused a significant prolongation of the action potential of epicardial and endocardial fibres within both the infarcted and noninfarcted myocardium. Refractoriness of epicardial ventricular fibres was significantly more prolonged in ischemically damaged cells as compared to normal fibres.", 
    "2": "The effect of intravenous pindolol (0.0256 mg/kg) on changes in plasma arachidonic acid (AA), some of its metabolites, and catecholamines induced by submaximal exercise was studied in six healthy male volunteers. Exercise resulted in markedly increased plasma concentrations of thromboxane B2 (TxB2) from 0.13 +/- 0.01 to 0.27 +/- 0.02 pmol/ml (mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.05) and AA from 4.1 +/- 0.6 to 8.0 +/- 0.9 mumol/l (p less than 0.005). No significant changes were seen in plasma concentrations of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha or PGE2 during exercise. A marked increase in plasma noradrenaline was seen already at 15 min of exercise, while the adrenaline concentration increased significantly at 30 min of exercise and a very marked increase in the adrenaline concentration was seen at exhaustion. A positive correlation (r = 0.54; p less than 0.05) was seen between plasma TxB2 and plasma adrenaline during exercise. The peak increase in both of these parameters was seen simultaneously at exhaustion. Pindolol treatment resulted in almost total inhibition of the increase in plasma TxB2 and AA during exercise. Pindolol treatment also resulted in a significantly higher adrenaline level at exhaustion. These data seem to indicate that an increased sympathetic tone may result in an increased release of arachidonic acid in the formation of vasoconstrictive thromboxane A2.", 
    "3": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate changes in urinary micro-albumin and in serum and urinary beta 2-microglobulin during treatment with captopril at low doses in a group of hypertensive outpatients without any sign of renal impairment. Thirty-four patients with essential hypertension entered the study, all having been treated for at least one year with beta-blockers and diuretics. None had proteinuria (by Albustix) and creatinine clearance was normal. The patients were randomly allocated to two groups: the first group was maintained on the previous regimen (group BD) and the second received captopril 50 mg twice daily instead of the beta-blocker (group CD). During the year of observation blood pressure values and serum and urinary beta 2-microglobulin were not significantly different between the two groups. There was, however, a significant reduction in albumin excretion rate (AER) in the CD group at both 3 and 6 months. Since arterial measures did not differ between the two groups, it is proposed that the reduction of AER was due to a diminution of the transcapillary hydraulic pressure due to the inhibition of the intrarenal angiotensin II induced by captopril.", 
    "4": "High performance liquid chromatography has acquired great importance recently for an analysis of the drugs in biological fluids of the body. Phase inversion sorbents are particularly widely used today. However, the use of ion-exchange sorbents is fairly promising for an analysis of the drugs capable of ionizing in an aqueous solution. The authors illustrate the use of the latter ones for determination in the blood, urine and saliva of man of a number of the cardiologic drugs (etmozine, nonachlazine, verapamil, prazosin, propranolol, nadolol). Ion-exchange sorbents make it possible to attain better results than inverse phase ones, since they retain the drugs selectively and do not retain the endogenous substances of lipid nature. As regards verapamil, prazosin and propranolol, the unchanged drug and polar metabolites could be determined jointly, with such a determination being not feasible with the use of phase inversion sorbents. Separation of the diastereoisomers of nadolol was achieved in the blood and urine of patients who received the drug.", 
    "5": "We have been studying the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from adult male rat medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) utilizing a continuous flow superfusion system. This model system allows for direct application of modifying substances into the superfusion chambers and for continuous collection of effluent for radioimmunoassay of GnRH levels. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone is rapidly released in response to specific chemical stimuli. As demonstrated by others, pulses of KCl or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) result in sharp peaks of GnRH release followed by rapid return to baseline. Forty millimolar KCl increases [GnRH] 3- to 4-fold, consistent with a membrane-associated secretory process for GnRH release. A 50-micrograms bolus of PGE2 results in a 2-fold rise in GnRH. Norepinephrine stimulates the release of GnRH in a log-linear dose-dependent manner in the range of 10(-9) to 10(-5) M norepinephrine (NE). At 10(-11) M, NE does not increase GnRH release above baseline, whereas at 10(-9) M NE GnRH release is increased 2-fold. The alpha-receptor blocker phentolamine significantly inhibits the NE-induced rise in GnRH. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, does not inhibit the GnRH response to NE. This study demonstrates a direct, dose-dependent, alpha-mediated stimulatory effect of NE on GnRH release from superfused male rat MBH, and establishes the potential of this system for the investigation of the GnRH response to other aminergic agents and their extraneural modifiers, including steroid hormones.", 
    "6": "The antihypertensive effect of carteolol, a new potent nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist, was investigated in a double-blind, parallel study of 35 patients with mild-to-moderate, essential hypertension whose blood pressures were not adequately controlled with a diuretic. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo, carteolol 5 mg, or carteolol 20 mg once a day in addition to hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg for six weeks. Thirty-four patients completed the study: 11 patients received placebo (group 1), 12 patients received carteolol 5 mg (group 2), and 11 patients received carteolol 20 mg (group 3). After six weeks of treatment, the two groups that received carteolol had significant reductions in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure from baseline in both the supine and standing positions. In group 2, mean SBP decreases for supine and standing positions were 11 +/- 2.1 and 11 +/- 1.9 mm Hg, respectively (P less than .01) and 8 +/- 1.2 and 9 +/- 1.3 mm Hg, respectively, for DBP (P less than .01); whereas in group 3, values were 8 +/- 2.8 and 12 +/- 3.0 mm Hg for SBP, in 5 +/- 1.9 and 9 +/- 3.1 mm Hg, respectively, for DBP (P less than .01). The hypotensive effect was associated with slight but significant decreases in heart rate (P less than .01 in group 2 and P less than .05 in group 3). Reductions in SBP and DBP with the 20-mg dose were not significantly different from those with the 5-mg dose.2+ moderate hypertension.", 
    "7": "Twenty patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension completed this double-blind cross-over randomized clinical trial of propranolol and acebutolol. Acebutolol was found to be as effective and safe as propranolol in lowering the systolic and diastolic blood pressure both in supine as well as in standing positions. However, the difference between the two drugs was not statistically significant. No significant change was produced in serum electrolytes, uric acid, fasting blood sugar with either drug. The accepted dose ratio of 1:2.5 propranolol and acebutolol, respectively, was found to be true only in 50% of the patients. Therefore, for optimal effect, the dose of acebutolol should be individualized depending upon the response.", 
    "8": "Twenty-four patients with classical angina of effort completed this double-blind cross-over clinical trial of acebutolol and propranolol. Both acebutolol (100-400 mg) and propranolol (40-160 mg) three times a day produced a significant reduction in the incidence of anginal attacks, consumption of nitroglycerine tablets and increased exercise tolerance. Both drugs produced mild and tolerable side effects which did not require any reduction of doses of the drugs being used. No change in laboratory parameters assessing the function of the liver, the kidneys and the hemopoietic system was found. The commonly accepted dose ratio of 1:2.5 propranolol and acebutolol, respectively, was found to be true in less than 50% of the patients. Therefore, for optimal effect, the dose of acebutolol should be individualized depending upon the response.", 
    "9": "The aim of the study was to clarify whether antihypertensive treatment with a selective beta blocker would have an effect on the progression rate of kidney disease in patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy. Six male patients with juvenile-onset diabetes with incipient nephropathy (urinary albumin excretion above 15 micrograms/min and total protein excretion below 0.5 g/24 hr) were treated with metoprolol (200 mg daily). At the start of the antihypertensive treatment the mean age was 32 years +/- 4.2 (SD). The patients were followed a mean 5.4 years +/- 3.1 (SD) with repeated measurements of urinary albumin excretion before and during 2.6 years +/- 1.0 (SD) of treatment. The blood pressure was depressed by the treatment (systolic blood pressure from 135 mm Hg +/- 8.6 to 124 mm Hg +/- 6.2, NS; mean blood pressure from 107 mm Hg +/- 7.6 to 97 mm Hg +/- 3.4, 2p less than 0.05; diastolic blood pressure from 93 mm Hg +/- 9.1 to 84 mm Hg +/- 3.6, 2p less than 0.05. Albumin excretion decreased (131.0 micrograms/min X/divided by 2.9 [geometric mean X/divided by tolerance factor] to 56.1 micrograms/min X/divided by 3.7, 2p less than 0.02). The mean yearly increase in urinary albumin excretion before treatment was 18 +/- 17 (mean +/- SD). Albumin excretion decreased during treatment: 17% +/- 15 per year (mean +/- SD, 2p less than 0.02). No changes were seen in glomerular filtration rate or renal plasma flow (149 ml/min +/- 5.8 vs 144 ml/min +/- 11.1, and 516 ml/min +/- 31.0 vs 541 ml/min +/- 68.5 respectively [n = 5]).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "Pancreatic alpha and beta cell hormone secretion was studied in 11 patients with thyrotoxicosis before and in 7 patients after thyroid function was normalized with either prophylthiouracil or methimazole and propranolol (R). All had IV arginine and IV glucose infusions. Forty control subjects had IV arginine; 21 had IV glucose tests. After arginine, untreated patient had blunted serum insulin at both 15 and 30 minutes (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.001) compared to control subjects, blunted glucagon at 30 minutes (p less than 0.05) and blunted glucose at both 15 and 30 minutes (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.01) compared to control subjects. After glucose, untreated patients had lower nadir glucagon than in the studies with both arginine and glucose infusions. These data document blunted glucagon, suppressed glucose and insulin peaks after arginine in thyrotoxicosis, indicate that both alpha and beta cell hormone secretion may be abnormal, and that the preferential abnormality follows protein rather than carbohydrate loading.", 
    "11": "The efficacy and safety of intravenous esmolol infusion was compared to that of intravenous propranolol injection in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVT) in a multicenter double-blind parallel study. A total of 127 patients were randomized to either the esmolol (n = 64) or propranolol (n = 63) group. Therapeutic response was achieved in 72% of esmolol and 69% of propranolol patients (p = NS). The average dose of esmolol in responders was 115 +/- 11 micrograms/kg/min. Therapeutic response was sustained in the 4-hour maintenance period in 67% of esmolol and 58% of propranolol patients (p = NS). Rate of conversion to normal sinus rhythm was similar in the two treatment groups. After discontinuation, rapid recovery from beta blockade (decrease in heart rate reduction) was observed in esmolol patients (within 10 minutes) compared to propranolol patients (no change in heart rate up to 4.3 hours). The principal adverse effect was hypotension, reported in 23 esmolol (asymptomatic in 19) and four propranolol (asymptomatic in three) patients. In the majority of esmolol patients, hypotension resolved quickly (within 30 minutes) after esmolol was discontinued. It was concluded that esmolol was comparable in efficacy and safety to propranolol in the treatment of patients with SVT. Unlike propranolol, because of the short half-life of esmolol, rapid control of beta blockade is possible with esmolol in clinical conditions when required.", 
    "12": "Our study was undertaken to assess whether the effect of intrarenal infusion of adenosine on renal blood flow and renin release in dogs is modified by the degree of stimulation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system. This system was modified by sodium deprivation, extracellular volume expansion, beta-adrenergic blockade and stimulation, angiotensin II infusion, and inhibition of converting enzyme by captopril. In addition, the effect of blocking slow calcium channels with verapamil on the vasoconstrictor effect of adenosine was also studied. Results demonstrate that the vasoconstrictor effect of adenosine was not modified by the status of stimulation or inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system or by the status of expansion of the extracellular volume. In all cases adenosine inhibited the renal secretion of renin. Verapamil abolished the vascular actions of adenosine, but it had no effect on the inhibition of renin release. We conclude that plasma renin or angiotensin II levels are not a necessary determinant of the renal vasoconstriction induced by adenosine. This effect seems to be mediated by the entry of calcium into the cell.", 
    "13": "Between October 1981 and December 1983, 46 consecutive unselected cirrhotic patients who had been admitted for variceal hemorrhage were assigned to propranolol for the prevention of variceal rebleeding and followed for a mean period of 13.3 months (ranges: 1 day, 45 months). At the time of inclusion, 87 p. 100 of patients had alcoholic cirrhosis: ascites was present in 43 p. 100, jaundice in 43 p. 100 and encephalopathy in 33 p. 100 of cases. The goal of this retrospective study was to assess the effectiveness of propranolol in these unselected patients and to determine variables associated with a high rebleeding rate. Twenty-four patients (52 p. 100) rebled from esophageal varices within a mean time of 8.2 months (range: 6 days, 39 months) and 12 of these patients died. The percentage of patients who rebled from varices was 27 p. 100 at 6 months, 43 p. 100 at 1 year, 52 p. 100 at 18 months. Patients with ascites at the time of inclusion were 3.5 times more likely to rebleed than patients without ascites (p = 0.007). Patients with jaundice (total bilirubin greater than or equal to 50 mumol/l) were 3.1 times more likely to rebleed than patients without jaundice (p = 0.01). One year after the beginning of this treatment, the probability of rebleeding was 19 p. 100 in the 17 Pugh-Child class A cirrhotic patients, 60 p. 100 in the 15 class B patients, 55 p. 100 in the 14 class C patients. Neither proper acceptance in taking propranolol nor alcohol withdrawal were associated with significantly modified risks of rebleeding in these unselected alcoholic patients.", 
    "14": "Rabbit ovaries were isolated surgically before the ovulatory gonadotrophin stimulation and perfused in vitro. Untreated, control ovaries never ovulated. Ovaries treated in vitro with ovine LH ovulated 10-14 h later and the oocytes had undergone germinal vesicle breakdown (GVB). LH induced increases in progesterone secretion from the treated ovaries. A 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase blocker ('Compound A') effectively reduced progesterone secretion into the perfusate and follicular fluid to very low levels but had no effect on ovulation rate or on oocyte maturation. Excessively high progesterone levels were obtained artificially in perfusates by addition of exogenous steroid; the number of ovaries ovulating was markedly reduced but there was no effect on oocyte maturation. It is concluded that the rise in progesterone that normally occurs immediately after the LH surge is not a prerequisite for ovulation in the rabbit. However, progesterone may have a modifying effect on LH-induced follicle rupture when at a pharmacologically high level.", 
    "15": "The anticonvulsant activity of propranolol was investigated in mice and rats using the electroshock seizure test (MES) and in special cases the electrically evoked hippocampal afterdischarges as a model. The results show that racemic propranolol as well as the two enantiomers were effective against MES. (+)-propranolol, the isomer with negligible beta-adrenoceptor blocking capacity revealed the stronger effect, its efficacy was comparable with the potency of phenobarbital, an overadditive synergism could be demonstrated. Subchronic administration of the two enantiomers led to a significantly reduced ED50 value of (-)-propranolol 24 h after the last application, the (-)-isomer became more effective. The (+)-propranolol did not reveal significant differences. In unrestrained rats with chronically implanted electrodes propranolol increased the stimulation threshold and reduced the duration of electrically evoked hippocampal afterdischarges. Investigations with drugs affecting monoaminergic systems in the CNS demonstrated that the noradrenergic system might play a predominant role in modulating the anticonvulsant effectiveness of propranolol. Pharmacological suppression (6-hydroxydopamine, reserpine, phenoxybenzamine) or stimulation (maprotiline, yohimbine, clenbuterol) reduced or enhanced the activity of propranolol against MES. On the other hand, manipulation of the serotonergic or dopaminergic system seemed to be less effective. In general, the findings confirm the results of previous studies that the membrane stabilizing property and not the blocking action on beta adrenergic (or serotonergic) receptors accounts for the anticonvulsant activity of propranolol.", 
    "16": "We studied mineral metabolism in 15 thyrotoxic patients and 15 controls matched for sex, age, and weight. Thyrotoxic subjects showed significantly higher serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and globulin and lower serum creatinine, magnesium, and albumin. Parathyroid hormone immunoreactivity (iPTH) was measured with three different antisera. Thyrotoxic patients showed markedly reduced iPTH values in the most sensitive assay, a midregion-specific assay based on homologous antiserum BG-6. Antiserum 211/32 gave slightly reduced iPTH values, but antiserum NG-1 gave values that were increased by 65%. The limited sensitivity of these later two antisera, like that of others used earlier for such studies, may have blunted the apparent fall in iPTH (antiserum 211/32) or predisposed the assay to a systematic artifact (antiserum NG-1). These results show that for use in the evaluation of hypercalcemia in thyrotoxic patients, a PTH assay must first be characterized as to the expected result in uncomplicated thyrotoxicosis. Twelve of the thyrotoxic subjects entered a random order cross-over study in which propranolol and placebo were given in double-masked fashion for 6 consecutive days each. Overall, the drug did not alter calcium, phosphate, or magnesium metabolism. It lowered serum calcium only in two overtly hypercalcemic subjects, whose urinary calcium excretion did not decline. These results confirm that propranolol may reduce elevated serum calcium levels in thyrotoxicosis and suggest that in this setting the drug may have a direct or indirect effect on renal calcium metabolism.", 
    "17": "It is now well accepted that graphic methods are a poor choice of analytical technique for analyzing radioligand binding data given the complexity of some radioligand-binding sites interactions; this is true not only for studies performed at equilibrium but also for those examining kinetic properties of the radioligand. As a consequence the computer plays an important role in all forms of radioligand binding experiments because it reduces the labor-intensive calculations associated with such experiments and it allows the use of more appropriate weighted nonlinear curve-fitting techniques that more accurately describe the radioligand-binding site interaction. This paper describes a collection of four programs (KINETIC, EBDA, LIGAND, and LOWRY) that can be used to analyze most forms of radioligand binding experiments. The programs have been adapted for use on an IBM PC, which is a popular, inexpensive microcomputer and which is well suited to the analysis of radioligand binding data.", 
    "18": "Despite extensive testing of ethanol, there has been little research on the reproductive effects of other alcohols. We investigated the behavioral teratogenicity of inhalation exposures to ethanol and n-propanol. Groups of 18 male (approximately 450 g) and 15 pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed 7 hours/day for six weeks or throughout gestation, respectively, to 16 000, 10 000, or 0 ppm ethanol or to 7 000, 35 000, or 0 ppm n-propanol. Pregnant females exposed to 7 000 ppm n-propanol, but not to ethanol, showed reduced weight gain, and female offspring also had reduced weight gain through three weeks of age; there was also slight teratogenicity observed at this concentration. Exposed males were mated with unexposed females; fertility was reduced in males exposed to 7 000 ppm n-propanol (two viable litters from 17 matings), but there were no differences from controls in maternal weight gain, feed intake, or water consumption in any other groups. In both maternally- and paternally-exposed groups, litters were culled to four pups of each sex and fostered to untreated females. One female and one male pup per litter were administered tests of neuromotor coordination (ascent on wire mesh screen, rotorod), activity levels (open field, running wheel), or learning ability (avoidance, operant conditioning), but no significant differences from controls were found with either alcohol, despite the reduction in maternal and female offspring body weight and minimal teratogenicity with 7 000 ppm n-propanol. Calculations for predicting blood ethanol levels with inhalation exposure are also presented.", 
    "19": "The effects of different pharmacological agents on the isometric developed tension (IDT) of right ventricles isolated from chronic chagasic C3HS mice were studied. The IDT in ventricles of chagasic animals was lower than in ventricles of normal mice (P less than 0.01). Chagasic ventricles exhibited hyperreactivity to norepinephrine but not to epinephrine. This hyperreactivity was masked by propranolol and not by dibenamine. Acetylcholine produced a reduction of IDT to similar values in normal and chagasic myocardia. The possibility that the effect of the drugs tested might not result from specially beta adrenoceptor-mediated reactions, but from alterations at other cellular sites is discussed.", 
    "20": "Rapid cyclic fluctuations of blood pressure in patients with a pheochromocytoma have rarely been reported. The suitable conditions to induce this phenomenon are not adequately known. We report here a patient with an adrenal pheochromocytoma who showed this phenomenon after oral administration of labetalol.", 
    "21": "The efficacy of denopamine, an orally active beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, in improving cardiac failure was assessed in dog heart-lung preparations. Cardiac functions depressed by pentobarbital (118 +/- 28 mg; mean value +/- SD) such that cardiac output and maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dt max) had been reduced by about 35% and 26% of the respective controls were improved by denopamine (10-300 micrograms) in a dose-dependent manner. With 100 micrograms denopamine, almost complete restoration of cardiac performance was attained, associated with a slight increase in heart rate. No arrhythmias were induced by these doses of denopamine. The results warrant clinical trials of denopamine in the treatment of cardiac failure.", 
    "22": "As both hormonal and hemodynamic alterations similar to those occurring during exercise can also be produced in humans by hypoglycemia, the present study explored changes in hemodynamic parameters during hypoglycemia and the effects of the alpha 1-adrenergic blocker, prazosin, on those responses in hypertensive patients. In the control group, which did not receive prazosin, plasma epinephrine, plasma norepinephrine and plasma renin activity (PRA) all increased along with a rise in blood pressure during hypoglycemia. On the other hand, the blood pressure decreased despite similar increases in plasma catecholamine levels and PRA in the prazosin treated group. The hemodynamic parameters, analyzed using M-mode echocardiography, changed in both the control and prazosin groups during hypoglycemia; stroke volume and cardiac output showed similar increases. However, while the total peripheral resistance did not change significantly in the control group, it decreased in the prazosin group during hypoglycemia. In accord with the changes in total peripheral resistance, the increment in mean-velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (m-Vcf) during hypoglycemia was greater in the prazosin group than in the control. These results suggest that: hypoglycemia stimulates the sympatho-adrenal axis which then releases catecholamines leading to a rise in blood pressure and tachycardia; In contrast, the blood pressure decreases during hypoglycemia in the prazosin group despite an increase in plasma catecholamines, because the alpha-receptors are blocked by prazosin and the unopposed beta-adrenergic effects of the catecholamines are pronounced enough to reduce the total vascular resistance.", 
    "23": "Patients with coronary artery disease exhibit a reduced coronary vasodilator reserve in response to exercise testing. Drugs which block coronary beta adrenergic receptors could exacerbate this abnormality leaving the vasoconstrictor alpha tone unopposed and/or counteracting the beta 2-mediated vasodilation elicited by the increase in myocardial oxygen demand. To test this hypothesis we administered propranolol 40 mg qid and placebo, using a cross over randomized single blind protocol, to 14 patients each with effort angina and critical coronary stenosis (greater than or equal to 75%). We performed computer-assisted multistage bicycle ergometer testings (25 W increments at 2 min intervals) after 2 weeks open label placebo (control) and at 2 week intervals following daily administration of propranolol and placebo. Compared to placebo, propranolol reduced significantly (p less than 0.001) peak heart rate (x +/- SD: 114 +/- 6 vs 150 +/- 11 beats/min) and rate pressure product (20.1 +/- 2.1 vs 28.0 +/- 3.9 X 10(-3)) and increased exercise duration (462 +/- 91 vs 355 +/- 85 sec). Conversely 0.1 mV ST segment depression was observed at lower heart rate (106 +/- 9 vs 127 +/- 8 beats/min, p less than 0.001) and rate pressure product (16.9 +/- 3.6 vs 22.4 +/- 2.4 X 10(-3), p less than 0.001). No significant differences were found between placebo and control. Moreover, we assessed the regression lines of the relationship between ST segment depression (ST) and heart rate (HR) during exercise. These have been shown to be shifted to the right after surgical revascularization and are an indirect measure of coronary reserve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "Oral treatment of rats with Ginkgo biloba extract (Gb) elicited a biphasic effect on normetanephrine (NMN) content of cerebral cortex; an initial decrease was evident after 45 minutes, followed by a marked increase that was evident after 14 days. Chronic treatment with Gb led to decreases in the density of 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding (after 27 days or 2 months) and in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity (after 2 months) of the cerebral cortex. Taken together, these results indicate that the effects of Gb on the central beta-adrenergic system might be involved in its therapeutic actions.", 
    "25": "Two prospective multi-centre randomized trials were initiated to compare the relative efficacy and influence on quality of life of captopril, alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, against either methyldopa, alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, or oxprenolol in combination with chlorothalidone. The complaint rate, activity index and psychiatric morbidity were evaluated as indices of quality of life. Captopril was associated with a significantly (P less than 0.05) greater reduction in complaint rate compared with methyldopa and a tendency for less symptoms of depression compared with oxprenolol (P = 0.06), the latter drug being associated with an increase in depression scores. The trends in quality of life indices in the captopril-treated patients would suggest the need for double-blind placebo-controlled trials to investigate these apparent benefits.", 
    "26": "Topography of alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors and their significance for smooth muscle cells of various links of the arterial division of the cat kidney blood channel were studied by means of alpha- and beta-adreno-stimulators and adrenoblockers administration under the control of general arterial pressure. The initial divisions of the major arteries and arterioles and their primary branches of the kidney fibrous capsule, distal divisions of afferent glomerulus vessels and their corresponding precapillary arterioles as well as the initial divisions of the straight arterioles of the kidney substance medullaris were shown to contain beta-adrenoreceptors. Alpha-adrenoreceptors are present in all other extra-parenchymatous and parenchymatous arteries and arterioles.", 
    "27": "The possible involvement of arachidonic acid (AA) or its metabolites in beta-adrenoceptor desensitization has been studied in rat lung parenchyma both from a functional and a biochemical point of view. In vitro perfusion of rat lungs with AA (3 X 10(-5)M for 20 min) reduced the relaxant effect of isoproterenol (ISO) on lung parenchymal strips, shown by a shift to the right of ISO dose-response curve, similar to that obtained using desensitizing concentration of specific beta-agonist. Moreover, AA treatment reduced the capacity of ISO to stimulate adenylate-cyclase activity, whereas the number of beta-receptor binding sites was not significantly modified. Inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase pathway by indomethacin (INDO) (1.5 X 10(-5)M) prevented both the loss of ISO-relaxing capacity and the decrease of adenylate-cyclase activity induced by AA treatment. In order to support the role of eicosanoids in beta-adrenoceptor desensitization, changes of endogenous free AA levels have also been studied in lung homogenates. Perfusion of rat lung with ISO (10(-6)M for 20 min) decreased by about 50% the levels of free AA and the pretreatment with BW755C (9 X 10(-5)M), a lipo- and cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, prevented this phenomenon. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the activation of AA cascade is actually involved in beta-adrenoceptor desensitization in lung tissues with a possible interference at the site beyond the drug-receptor interaction.", 
    "28": "In immature ducklings injected with hypertonic saline the volume of extrarenal salt gland secretion was unaffected by prior treatment (immediately or 4 hr before salt loading) with long-lasting adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH 100 iu/kg, im) or exogenous corticosterone (1.0 mg/kg, im). Pretreatment with metyrapone, an 11-beta-hydroxylase blocker, (80 mg/kg, im) 4 hr before salt loading did not effect the volume of salt gland secretion but delayed the onset of extrarenal excretion. Salt gland function was suppressed in birds pretreated with metyrapone immediately prior to salt loading. The intravenous administration of metyrapone after salt loading immediately reduced salt gland activity, which remained suppressed for at least 40-50 min thereafter. The inhibitory effect of metyrapone on salt gland activity was not counteracted by the subsequent or simultaneous administration of exogenous corticosterone to salt-loaded ducks. These results suggest that acute alterations in adrenocortical activity are not causally responsible for changes in salt gland function.", 
    "29": "The sites of specific binding of 3H-L-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) were identified on the surface of ascites sarcoma 37 cells, using competitive displacement and binding of the beta-adrenergic antagonists, 3H-DHA and L-propranolol. These binding sites possessed the properties of beta-adrenergic receptors coupled with adenylate cyclase. Analysis of 3H-DHA binding by the Scatchard method revealed the presence of beta-adrenergic receptors of two types, i. e., with a high (Kd = 0.9-1.0 nM) and low (Kd = 15-20 nM) affinity for 3H-DHA. The number of high affinity receptors was (5.0-7.5) X 10(3); that of low affinity receptors was (20-30) X 10(3) on a per cell basis. Sarcolysine at concentrations of 1-10 microM displaced receptor-bound 3H-DHA, competed with the ligand for the common binding sites and caused, similar to isoproterenol, a short-term elevation of the intracellular cAMP content. Sarcolysine within the same concentration range (2.5-25 microM) caused non-competitive inhibition of the cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE2) activity of plasma membranes isolated from ascites sarcoma 37 cells. The data obtained point to the functional coupling between beta-adrenergic receptors, adenylate cyclase and membraneous PDE2 of tumour cells as well as to its possible role in the antitumour effect of sarcolysine.", 
    "30": "The effects of clonidine (CLO) on reflexly activated bladder motility have been examined in urethane-anesthetized rats and compared to its effects on field stimulation-induced contractions of isolated urinary bladder. Intravenous CLO suppressed micturition reflex transiently in a yohimbine-sensitive manner. The suppressive effect of i.v. CLO was greater after surgical sympathectomy (bilateral section of the hypogastric nerves). Intracisternal CLO was more effective than topical (on the bladder dome) or intracerebroventricular CLO in suppressing micturition. When tested in experimental conditions involving activation of both excitatory and inhibitory reflexes to the bladder CLO produced either inhibitory and/or excitatory effects on bladder motility in dependence of factors such as dose, route of administration and integrity of the sympathetic (inhibitory) innervation to the bladder. CLO suppressed bladder contractions produced by dimethylphenilpiperazinium, a ganglionic stimulant, and reduced those produced by postganglionic nerve stimulation. CLO inhibited, in a yohimbine-sensitive manner, amplitude of field stimulation-induced contractions of isolated rat bladder, and its effectiveness was inversely related to the frequency of stimulation. Our findings are suggestive that the inhibitory action of CLO on micturition reflex is counteracted, in normal animals, by a negative feedback on sympathetic inhibitory influences carried out through the hypogastric nerves.", 
    "31": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propranolol in rats 2 days after laparotomy were compared to control animals. The apparent volumes of distribution and the systemic clearance of propranolol were decreased to about 20 to 40 and 70% of control values, respectively. The area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC) of propranolol after p.o. administration showed a marked elevation after surgery and its availability increased about 2-fold at doses of 5.0 and 12.5 mg/kg. These changes were associated with a decreased plasma unbound fraction of propranolol after surgery. Immunological determination of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) revealed a marked increase after laparotomy and a linear relationship was found between the plasma AGP concentration and the binding capacity of high-affinity binding site for propranolol in plasma (r = 0.961, P less than .001). AUC of p.o. administered propranolol was also correlated with plasma AGP concentration. The beta-blocking activity of propranolol assessed by the reduction in the isoproterenol-induced tachycardia was decreased in rats after laparotomy when it was evaluated in terms of the total plasma concentration of propranolol. In contrast, its activity evaluated by the unbound plasma concentration showed no difference between control and laparotomized rats, suggesting the dependence of the pharmacological activity of propranolol on its unbound level in plasma. Thus, laparotomy-induced changes in both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics could be considered largely due to an increase in its binding to the increased plasma level of AGP.", 
    "32": "A newly synthesized compound, N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA-1004), was shown to be a potent inhibitor of two cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and the Ki values were 1.4 and 2.3 microM, respectively. HA-1004 relaxed rabbit aortic strips contracted by various agonists and with similar ED50 values. Phenotolamine, propranolol and atropine did not affect this HA-1004-induced relaxation, thereby suggesting that this compound does not act through these membrane receptor associated mechanisms. HA-1004 shifted the dose-response curve for CaCl2 to the right in a competitive manner in depolarized rabbit renal arterial strips. This compound also relaxed the A-23187 and phenylephrine-induced contractions elicited in Ca++-free solution. These findings suggest that HA-1004 exerts its action at the intracellular or submembranal level. This vasodilator has little effect on actomyosin adenosine triphosphatase and Ca++-calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase. Studies using its derivatives with various lengths of alkyl chain (C0-C6) indicated that the potencies of these compounds, as vasorelaxants, correlated well with their potential to inhibit cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase. HA-1004 should be a useful tool for investigating in smooth muscle, regulatory mechanism(s) by second messengers, cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP.", 
    "33": "Isoproterenol (ISO) increases contractility and cyclic AMP content in ventricles of embryonic and hatched (H) chicks. A transient decrease in beta agonist sensitivity for both effects (10-fold shift in ISO EC50) is seen in 18-day embryos (18 E) (Pappano and Biegon, 1982). Beta adrenoceptor-coupled adenylate cyclase (AC) and receptor binding were characterized in 14,000 X g ventricular particulates from 10 to 11E, 17 to 19E and 1-week-old chicks (5-6H). The concentration for half-maximal enzyme activation (Kact) for ISO [+100 microM 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p)]-stimulated AC is greatest in the 17 to 19E (1.6 microM vs. 0.1-0.2 microM in the 5-6H and 10-11E). Maximal enzyme activity in the presence of ISO + Gpp(NH)p (picomoles of cyclic AMP/20 min X mg of protein), however, is greatest in the 10 to 11E (2018 +/- 80 vs. 1020 +/- 80 and 1120 +/- 60 in the 17 to 18E and 5 to 6H, respectively). The Kact values for NaF and Gpp(NH)p are the same for all three ages (2.4 mM and 8 microM, respectively), whereas maximal activity with these effectors of the regulatory and catalytic protein-dependent AC decreases with increasing age. Neither the Kact nor maximal activity of catalytic AC, assessed with MnCl2 and forskolin, changes with age. The respective Kact values for MnCl2 and forskolin are 0.3 mM and 4 microM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and LV systolic pumping function of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated for 40 weeks with hydralazine (n = 8), metoprolol (n = 8) and both metoprolol and hydralazine (n = 9) were compared with those of 25 age-matched untreated SHR. LV pressure (PLV), peak systolic wall stress (SWS), cardiac index (CI), LV ejection fraction (EF), LV muscle mass to body weight ratio (LV/BW) and the mass volume ratio (M/V) were determined. In the rats treated with hydralazine and metoprolol and hydralazine combined PLV was 28.7% (129 +/- 19 mm Hg) and 31.5% (124 +/- 17 mm Hg) lower compared to the untreated control group (181 +/- 18 mm Hg). In spite of the same amount of blood pressure reduction, LV hypertrophy was less expressed after treatment with metoprolol and hydralazine than after hydralazine only (LV/BW: 2.48 +/- 0.17 versus 2.67 +/- 0.24 mg/g, p less than 0.01; M/V: 2.43 +/- 0.59 versus 3.09 +/- 0.47 mg/microliter, p less than 0.05 respectively). In the group treated with metoprolol and hydralazine LV systolic ejection function parameters (CI, EF) did not differ from those untreated due to an unchanged LV afterload as demonstrated by identical systolic wall stress values (169 +/- 43.4 X 10(3) versus 171 +/- 26.0 X 10(3) dyn/cm2, ns). The identical systolic wall stress values indicate that cardiac hypertrophy had regressed in proportion to the reduced LV peak systolic pressure. Following hydralazine therapy systolic wall stress was even lower (140 +/- 26.5 X 10(3) dyn/cm2) in comparison to the untreated group (171 +/- 26.0 X 10(3) dyn/cm3, p less than 0.05). This reflects an inappropriate low muscle mass reduction in relation to blood pressure reduction. In conclusion (I) antihypertensive therapy with an arteriolar vasodilator in combination with a beta-receptor blocker is more effective in preventing cardiac hypertrophy than therapy with a vasodilator only. (II) Myocardial working capacity remained unaltered after prevention of cardiac hypertrophy as well as LV pumping function.", 
    "35": "Increased defatted dry wt of the heart and increased heart calcium content were observed in subtotally nephrectomized male Sprague-Dawley rats compared with sham-operated pairfed controls. Increased heart wt contrasted with no change of the weight of viscera (liver, spleen) and markedly decreased weight of striated muscle. Heart wt was unchanged after 5 days of renal insufficiency, but significantly increased after 14 or 21 days. Increased heart wt persisted despite effective beta adrenoreceptor blockade (2 X 10 mg metroprolol/kg/day i.p.) or effective alpha-1-adrenoreceptor blockade (2 X 2 mg prazosin/kg/day i.p.). Increased heart wt was also demonstrable despite normalization of basal blood pressure (intraarterial blood pressure measurement in conscious animals): blood pressure was lowered in one series with hydralazine/nadolol in drinking water (calculated to deliver 20 and 2 mg/kg/day, respectively) and in another series with furosemide in drinking water (15 mg/kg/day) combined with metoprolol (2 X 10 mg/kg/day i.p.). Increased heart wt was also noted despite correction of anemia by blood transfusion (Hct greater than 40%) and after parathyroidectomy in animals kept eucalcemic with high dietary calcium. Micromorphometry of left ventricular myocardium in perfusion-fixed tissue showed no significant change of the relative proportion of connective tissue and myocardial fibers. Myocardial isomyosin pattern was changed with an increase of fast-migrating V1 isomyosin in animals with renal insufficiency compared to sham-operated pairfed controls.", 
    "36": "Immediate post-training administration of the central acting opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (0.01-1.00 mg/kg) facilitated 48-h retention of a one-trial inhibitory avoidance task. An inverted-U dose-response curve was obtained. In this dose range naltrexone did not significantly affect response latencies of mice not given a footshock during the training. However, higher doses of naltrexone (3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) increased latencies of both shocked and unshocked mice. The peripheral-acting opioid receptor blocker, naltrexone methyl bromide (MR 2263) (0.01-10.00 mg/kg), did not significantly influence retention latencies of either shocked or unshocked mice. Further, MR 2263 (0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 mg/kg) did not block the retention impairment produced by concurrently administered morphine (3.0 mg/kg) or beta-endorphin (0.1 microgram/kg). These findings indicate that the effect of these agonists on memory are not due to a peripheral influence. However, MR 2263 does prevent the memory-impairing effect of both metenkephalin (1.0 microgram/kg) and leu-enkephalin (0.3 microgram/kg) on retention. Those results suggest that enkephalins affect retention through influences initiated peripherally. Thus, different sites and mechanisms of action for beta-endorphin and the enkephalins are proposed.", 
    "37": "The renin-angiotensin system has been shown to play a significant role in maintaining blood pressure and sodium balance in health and disease states. The development of various pharmacologic probes that inhibit the RAS at different and specific points in the renin-angiotensin cascade has facilitated the elucidation of the role of angiotensin II in renovascular hypertension. In a clinical regard, inhibitors of the RAS have been instrumental in screening patients for renovascular hypertension, and in predicting curability with a high degree of reliability. Moreover, use of these drugs in an out-patient setting has been determined to be safe, practical, and reliable, making the work-up for renin-dependent hypertension cost effective and accurate.", 
    "38": "The new inotropic agent, forskolin, is thought to act by stimulation of adenyl cyclase at a site remote from the beta-receptor. In this study we have characterized the action of forskolin in isolated, perfused rat and guinea-pig hearts. In both species, forskolin increased heart rate, left ventricular pressure and tissue cyclic AMP in a concentration-dependent manner. Significant responses were obtained with a minimum concentration of 2 X 10(-9)M forskolin in the rat and 2 X 10(-8)M in the guinea-pig. In both species maximal effects were observed with 2 X 10(-6)M forskolin. For any given forskolin concentration, the increases in cyclic AMP were greater in the rat heart than in the guinea-pig heart. In the rat heart, two beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (1.6 X 10(-6)M propranolol or 2.6 X 10(-6)M timolol) were both able to reduce the increases in function and tissue cyclic AMP content caused by forskolin (2 X 10(-7) and 2 X 10(-8)M). However, no inhibition by beta-blockade was observed in hearts from catecholamine-depleted (reserpinized) animals or in hearts treated with high concentrations (2 X 10(-6)M) of forskolin. These results indicate that catecholamines may in some way be able to potentiate the actions of forskolin.", 
    "39": "The effect of some beta-adrenoceptor agonists, such as clenbuterol, salbutamol, isoprenaline and formoterol on the NA turnover (estimated on the basis of NA disappearance after inhibition of its synthesis by FLA-63) in various regions of the rat brain was examined. All the used beta-agonists (given ip) accelerated the FLA-63 induced disappearance of NA in the cortex, limbic system and brain stem. That effect of the beta-agonists was antagonized by propranolol. The obtained results indicate that beta-adrenoceptors are involved in regulation of the NA turnover. After chronic treatment with salbutamol (5 mg/kg, twice a day for 10 days, the last dose--10 mg/kg), tolerance to acute affects of that substance developed. In turn, salbutamol given chronically prevented the clonidine-induced deceleration of NA disappearance. The effects observed after chronic salbutamol treatment may be due to developed adaptive changes in beta-, as well as in alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "40": "The inhibitory action of PN 200-110, a novel calcium antagonist, on alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated pressor effects elicited by selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and catecholamines was studied in pithed rats. The pressor effects of the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist cirazoline were only slightly influenced by PN 200-110 (0.1 mg/kg). On the other hand, PN 200-110 efficiently inhibited the hypertensive effects of the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist B-HT 920 in a dose-dependent way, thereby reducing the maximal response considerably (pD2' = 7.30). The alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediated pressor responses of adrenaline and noradrenaline, obtained after pretreatment with propranolol and the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine, were slightly inhibited by PN 200-110, without influencing maximal responses. PN 200-110 inhibited the alpha 1-adrenergic pressor effects of noradrenaline better than those of adrenaline. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated pressor effects of the cathecholamines obtained after pretreatment with propranolol and the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, were highly susceptible to blockade by PN 200-110 except for the high doses (300 micrograms/kg) of adrenaline. The present study establishes the pronounced calcium entry inhibitory potency of PN 200-110 and confirms and extends previous observations that blockade of calcium entry preferably impairs alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction in vivo, when compared to that elicited by alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "41": "Nipradilol competitively antagonized norepinephrine- or phenylephrine-induced contractile responses of guinea-pig thoracic aorta. These actions of nipradilol were about 6 times less potent than those of phentolamine. Nitroglycerin showed a non-competitive antagonistic action on norepinephrine-induced contractions of aorta. Furthermore, nipradilol competitively inhibited norepinephrine-induced contractions of rat vas deferens and dose-dependently reduced the phenylephrine-induced inhibitory responses in rabbit ileum. These antagonistic actions of nipradilol were 30 to 100 times less potent than those of phentolamine. Nitroglycerin did not appreciably affect these alpha-adrenoceptor mediated responses in rat vas deferens and rabbit ileum. The inhibitory action of clonidine on the twitch contraction of rat vas deferens produced by intramural stimulation was only slightly antagonized by nipradilol (pA2 = 5.4). Nipradilol and nitroglycerin showed a non-competitive antagonistic action on clonidine-induced contractions of canine saphenous vein after the exposure to phenoxybenzamine, while phentolamine competitively inhibited the clonidine responses. These results suggest that nipradilol possesses an alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking action; it possesses very weak or practically no presynaptic alpha 2-blocking activity but shows a non-competitive antagonistic action on postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated contractile responses.", 
    "42": "Dose-related effects of ritodrine and ritodrine combined with metoprolol on urinary excretion rate were studied in anesthetized dogs. Urine production was abruptly reduced after a total dose of 4 micrograms.kg-1 of ritodrine. This effect could not be antagonized by metoprolol, although the ritodrine-induced decrease of mean arterial pressure and renal arterial blood flow was significantly inhibited. The possible role of fluid retention during tocolytic treatment, even with beta-adrenergic blockade, in the etiology of pulmonary edema is discussed with a review on recent literature.", 
    "43": "The age of patients is an essential factor in the development, duration and severity of hypertension. In essential hypertension there is a change in sympathetic cardiovascular control; during the initial phase, there is an increased response of the beta-adrenergic receptors, i.e. increased cardiac output and plasma renin activity. This response then becomes attenuated and vasoconstriction due to alpha-adrenergic stimulation is observed, accompanied by an increase in intracellular sodium and free calcium. The physiopathological concept of essential hypertension has pharmacotherapeutic implications. In young patients, who often have high renin levels, a better response is observed to monotherapy with betablockers and to treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors. Older patients, who usually have low renins, do not respond as well to betablockers but good results are obtained with calcium antagonists as an alternative to diuretic therapy. Betablockers and calcium antagonists are now the corner store of antihypertensive therapy aimed at protecting the heart.", 
    "44": "Propranolol, timolol and sotalol were compared regarding their toxicological effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory system. Each drug was administered intravenously to anaesthetized spontaneously breathing and artificially ventilated rats. After the start of infusion in spontaneously breathing rats each drug induced an expected decrease in arterial blood pressure and heart rate. An increase in PQ, QRS and QT interval was observed. From 5/8 of the survival time onwards these changes were accentuated. PaO2, pH and respiratory rate decreased and PaCO2 increased. The rats died as a result of respiratory arrest. Artificial ventilation of rats infused with the same doses increased the survival time significantly. The total doses administered before the animals died as a result of cardiovascular failure were significantly higher for each drug. The initial decreases in arterial blood pressure and heart rate were similar to those in spontaneously breathing rats. Thereafter, significantly smaller decreases were observed. The increases in PQ, QRS and QT interval were significantly less than in spontaneously breathing rats. Blood gases remained unchanged except for a decrease in pH in case of timolol.", 
    "45": "The affinity and efficacy of a number of sympathomimetic amines structurally related to prenalterol and the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist RO363 were determined using a combination of radioligand binding and organ bath techniques. Affinity of the molecules (pKD) was calculated from their ability to displace the radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) from beta-adrenoceptor sites in left atrial (beta 1) and uterine (beta 2) membrane homogenates. These pKD values were used to calculate efficacy from the positive inotropic and uterine relaxant responses elicited by the drugs in organ bath experiments. The drugs studied were either arylethanolamines i.e., (-)-isoprenaline (ISO), p-hydroxyisoprenaline (pOH-ISO), compounds XIV and XVI or aryloxypropanolamine-derivatives, i.e., oxymethylene-isoprenaline (OM-ISO), prenalterol and Compound XI which possessed a p-phenol or catechol ring and an isopropyl or a homoveratryl amine substituent. Only ISO, OM-ISO, pOH-ISO and Compound XVI were active as agonists in both tissue preparations. These drugs were partial agonists which exhibited a wide range of pD2 values and did not display any marked selectivity for either beta-adrenoceptor subtype. Compound XI and prenalterol were inactive as agonists and together with the partial agonists behaved as competitive antagonists to ISO in the two preparations. All drugs tested displaced [125I]CYP from beta-adrenoceptor sites, however, there was also a wide range of potency amongst the drugs. Analysis of the structure-affinity and structure-efficacy relationships indicated that removal of the 3-hydroxyl group from the catechol ring reduces both affinity and efficacy without altering the selectivity of the drug for either beta-adrenoceptor subtype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "Effective antihypertensive therapy has recently been shown to reduce not only the incidence of stroke, but also myocardial infarction irrespective of the drug(s) used. The well-documented preventive effect of beta-blockers in patients who suffered a myocardial infarction (secondary prevention) cannot be extended to patients with hypertension without overt coronary artery disease (primary prevention), except perhaps for non-smoking men. Despite strong experimental evidence, information on a possible secondary preventive effect of calcium antagonists in man is scant, and two double-blind placebo-controlled trials in secondary prevention with verapamil (320 mg) in a total of 1436 patients and nifedipine (30 mg) in 2279 patients did not reveal an overall treatment benefit. There are another six on-going trials. In the management of hypertension, large-scale trials may never help in selecting a particular drug for cardiac event reduction, and probably for many years the goals will be to normalize blood pressure with increased emphasis on the need to remedy other cardiovascular risk factors, in particular smoking.", 
    "47": "The decision to treat a hypertensive patient is usually based on the level of the blood pressure and some consideration of epidemiological risk factors. The implicit assumption is that all patients derive the same benefit from a particular type of drug. Recent evidence suggests that benefits are influenced by many factors, both positive and negative, which include age, sex, race, tobacco smoking and many diseases that can be provoked or aggravated by commonly used drugs, e.g. asthma, claudication, diabetes and gout. Risk factor analysis no longer seems the most appropriate technique on which to base treatment decisions. Analysis of potential benefits from different treatment strategies in an individual patient seems a better way.", 
    "48": "A radioligand binding technique was used to study beta-adrenergic binding sites on rodent Leydig cells. Beta-Adrenergic binding sites were found on Leydig cells in both the rat and mouse. Binding of [3H]CGP-12177 [4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-[5,7-3H]benzimidazole-2-one] to purified rat Leydig cells was found to be saturable, temperature and time dependent, stereospecific, and readily reversible by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Scatchard analysis revealed the presence of high-affinity sites with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.79 +/- 0.22 nM and maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of 1716 +/- 245 sites per rat Leydig cell. Competition of various beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists with [3H]CGP indicates an order of potency of L-isoproterenol greater than epinephrine = salbutamol greater than norepinephrine greater than D-isoproterenol and dl-propranolol = ICI 118,551 much greater than atenolol, respectively. These observations suggest that the binding sites are predominantly of the beta 2-receptor subtype. Incubation of freshly isolated rat Leydig cells with luteinizing hormone (100 ng/ml) caused consistent stimulation of androgen production, but only occasional stimulation by the beta-agonist isoproterenol (10 microM) was observed. However, these cells consistently responded to the beta-agonist after 3 h in primary cultures. These findings indicate that rodent Leydig cells possess beta-adrenergic binding sites and point out a possible dissociation between receptor recognition and physiologic response.", 
    "49": "Previous investigations on guinea-pig airways indicate that the excitatory, cholinergic neurotransmission can be inhibited via prejunctional alpha-2-adrenoceptors. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a similar inhibition of the cholinergic neurotransmission is present in human airways. Ring preparations of human bronchi were mounted for recording of isometric tension and immersed in oxygenated Krebs solution. Electrical field stimulation of the preparations elicited atropine-sensitive twitch contractions. Exogenous noradrenaline (in the presence of cocaine and propranolol) inhibited the electrically evoked contractions. The noradrenaline-induced inhibition could be antagonized by yohimbine whereas prazosin was ineffective, indicating that the inhibition was mediated by alpha-2-adrenoceptors. Contractions evoked by exogenous acetylcholine (in the presence of cocaine and propranolol) was unaffected by the addition of noradrenaline, which suggests that the alpha-2-adrenoceptors have a prejunctional localization. In conclusion, this report gives evidence that the human bronchial, cholinergic neurotransmission can be inhibited by stimulation of prejunctional alpha-2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "50": "The influence of pre-operative treatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent, phenoxybenzamine, on the incidence of adverse cardiovascular reactions during anaesthesia and surgery for phaeochromocytoma was evaluated in a series of 62 patients. Fifty-one of them received pre-operative treatment with phenoxybenzamine and eight of these were also treated with beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. The median final daily dose of phenoxybenzamine was 160 mg and the median period of treatment 23 days. The evening before surgery and in the early morning on the day of surgery, intravenous infusion of phenoxybenzamine was given to 42 of the patients. Eleven patients operated on between 1956 and 1963 received no specific pre-operative treatment and served as a reference group. The alpha-adrenoceptor blocking treatment resulted in a considerably smoother peroperative course, as evidenced by a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of excessive blood-pressure variations. The blockade was not complete since 69% of the patients had systolic peaks greater than 175 mmHg during surgery. Pre-operative blood transfusions did not significantly affect the incidence of hypotensive episodes. Pre-operative beta-adrenoceptor blockade did not reduce the incidence of peroperative arrhythmia. On the basis of our experience, we recommend that all phaeochromocytoma patients be treated pre-operatively with alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents.", 
    "51": "Elevated oestradiol (E2) levels may be a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease in men, although the mechanisms for the elevation of oestrogen and for its adverse effects remain unclear. We have studied 100 Caucasian males undergoing elective coronary angiography for ischaemic chest pain and measured serum oestradiol, a profile of haemostatic tests, extent of coronary artery disease and evidence of previous myocardial infarction in order to assess any relationships which could explain the effect of elevated serum oestradiol levels. Levels were significantly higher in men with a history of myocardial infarction compared to those without (p less than 0.01), but were unrelated to the extent of coronary disease or to the haemostatic tests. These results suggest that the association of oestradiol with coronary events relates to myocardial infarction, not to atherogenesis, and is not due to any currently measurable alterations of haemostasis. Current beta-adrenoceptor blocker treatment was associated with lower oestradiol and thromboxane B2 concentrations (both, p = 0.06). These incidental findings suggest that further studies of the effects of beta-blockade on oestradiol and thromboxane metabolism are indicated.", 
    "52": "(-)-Pindolol (4 mg/kg, i.p.) stereospecifically and selectively inhibited rat brain 5-HT synthesis. The DA and NA synthesis remained unaffected by pindolol (either enantiomer) treatment, and the (-)-pindolol-induced decrease in 5-HT synthesis was not prevented by reserpine pretreatment. The results indicate that, in addition to its beta-adrenergic properties, (-)-pindolol may act as an agonist at synthesis-controlling 5-HT receptors (autoreceptors ?) in the rat CNS.", 
    "53": "Gastrointestinal first-pass elimination of propranolol and the effect of dose (1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg kg-1) on its systemic availability were studied in male Wistar rats which received the drug intravenously, orally or intraportally. The plasma elimination half-life was not altered either by the route of administration or the dose. There was no gastrointestinal first-pass metabolism of propranolol, since the same systemic availability was obtained after oral and intraportal administration. Hepatic clearance was estimated to be constant at any dose. In contrast, the hepatic intrinsic clearance was found to be largely dependent on the portal dose.", 
    "54": "The absorption rate of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, exaprolol, from the gastrointestinal tract was studied using in-situ methods in the rat and dog. Exaprolol was rapidly absorbed from the small and large intestine of rats and from the ileum of dogs. The cardiac output and regional blood flow decreased in rats to approximately one half of the original values within 30 min of the in-situ experiment. The logarithm of the amount vs time plots from dogs were linear, whereas with rats a curvilinearity appeared apparently because of the blood flow-limited absorption kinetics of this highly lipophilic drug. The data obtained suggest that exaprolol is suitable for administration in sustained release form.", 
    "55": "Experimental results of plasma concentration determinations and lowering of exercise heart rate for six subjects taking a conventional tablet and a sustained release preparation of oxprenolol have been analysed by a comprehensive computer simulation model. Individual plasma values were simulated using a lest squares procedure and the results were applied to evaluate individual release patterns following dosage with the sustained release preparation. Application of the model to the lowering of exercise heart rate indicated that the response is in a steady state with the plasma values and that the response-concentration relation is of the saturable, Emax, type. The parameters for this were evaluated for each subject for the results after a dose of a conventional tablet. These parameters were applicable to the results after dosage with a sustained release preparation. The method should be applicable to other sustained release preparations.", 
    "56": "Labetalol is a unique antihypertensive agent which is a competitive peripheral antagonist at both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor sites. Clinically, it possesses about one fourth of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity of propranolol and one half of the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity of phentolamine with a beta- to alpha-blocking ratio of approximately 7:1. Nowadays, the clinical profile of labetalol is clearly defined. Perorally, it has often been used in the treatment of mild, moderate and severe hypertension and intravenously in the management of hypertensive emergencies. It offers many advantages over beta-blockers with no prominent side-effects. Hemodynamically, labetalol reduces blood pressure, heart rate and, first of all, peripheral resistance with almost no change in resting cardiac output or stroke volume. Labetalol appears to be useful particularly in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by beta-blockers alone or combined with a diuretic, but sometimes at the expense of postural hypotensive side-effects. It has proved to be safe in patients with coronary artery disease or after acute myocardial infarction and in pregnant patients, but in phaechromocytoma further clinical experience is needed. In induced hypotension during anesthesia and surgery no invasive blood pressure measurements are needed. The most frequent adverse effects include fatigue, postural hypotension, headache and gastrointestinal complaints. On the whole, labetalol expands the armamentarium of the practising physician in the treatment of hypertension of different origin.", 
    "57": "The antihypertensive activity of a new arterial dilator, cadralazine, was evaluated in 40 patients with mild-to-moderate arterial hypertension. Cadralazine was given once daily over 6 weeks, and blood pressure and heart rate were recorded 24-26 hours after dosing. Cadralazine dose was 10 mg daily initially, and 15 or 20 mg daily from the 3rd or 5th trial week according to a target diastolic pressure reduction to 95 mmHg or below. Slow-release metoprolol 200 mg once daily was added when heart rate increase exceeded 25% of the pretreatment value. Blood pressure showed a significant and progressive reduction throughout the study period, both in the patients receiving cadralazine as monotherapy (19 patients) and in those who added metoprolol (21 patients). The target diastolic pressure reduction was reached in 2 patients with the 10-mg dose, in 19 of the remaining 38 patients with the 15-mg dose, and in 13 of the other 19 patients with the 20-mg dose. Considering only those patients who did not add metoprolol, the target was reached in the 2 patients with the 10-mg dose, in 10 of the 19 patients with the 15-mg dose and in 7 of the 19 patients with the 20-mg dose. None of the laboratory tests showed clinically relevant changes. Neither LE cells nor antinuclear antibodies were found. In conclusion, cadralazine is a promising long-acting antihypertensive vasodilator. A clinically satisfactory antihypertensive effect is achieved mostly by a 15-mg or a 20-mg dose given once daily.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "58": "Clinical studies on the use and activity of drugs often rely on data generated from a relatively small number of patients, and definitive conclusions are drawn that are assumed to represent the population at large. Similarly, interpretation and comparison of studies are made difficult when end points of effectiveness, particularly with antihypertensive agents, are arbitrarily chosen. The results from a clinical study of more than 1400 hypertensive patients after indapamide therapy for 3 months, alone or in combination with a beta blocker, are presented using a different graphic approach. This is based on the assumption that the magnitude of the fall in blood pressure after hypertensive therapy is dependent on initial blood pressure. Diastolic and systolic pressures were plotted as a scattergram against the change in blood pressure. Predetermined response lines were drawn with a slope of 1 and intercepts on the initial blood pressure axis of 90 mm Hg for diastolic and 140 mm Hg for systolic pressures with tolerance limits of +/- 10 mm Hg drawn about it. Subdivisions of response can be achieved by counting the number of patients above and below these lines. This allows a drug to be \"finger-printed\" in terms of its pattern of activity in all degrees of severity of hypertension and, more relevant, direct comparisons with other drugs can be made. Similarly, the potential activity of the drug can be determined by computing the slope and intercept of the actual regression line through the data points.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "Hypertension in diabetic patients is more common than in controls, contributes substantially to their increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and should be treated as accurately as diabetes mellitus itself. After appropriate exclusion of secondary forms, the first therapeutic step consists of reduction of overweight, salt intake, and smoking; the omission of interfering drugs; and adequate instruction. Step 2 has usually been the prescription of a diuretic drug, in spite of its known side effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. A new possible alternative may be a calcium antagonist. Results in 10 hypertensive diabetic persons suggest that at a dose that normalizes blood pressure, neither carbohydrate nor lipid metabolism is altered, uric acid decreases, the exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity toward norepinephrine becomes normal, and the pressor dose for angiotensin II tends to rise. Body weight, blood volume, exchangeable sodium, as well as plasma and urinary sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels were unchanged. The third therapeutic step is the addition of a cardioselective beta blocker in a moderate dose. This avoids the disadvantages of beta 2-adrenergic blockade such as decreased insulin output, prolonged hypoglycemia, diminished glucagon secretion, and increased vasospasticity during hypoglycemic states, as well as aggravation of peripheral vascular disease. Alternatives are other sympatholytics with their known tendency to cause or increase orthostatic and sexual problems or, again, a calcium antagonist. In step 4, a hydralazine-type drug or prazosine is added. The fifth step, which adds minoxidil or captopril to the previous drugs, should only be taken after a specialist reevaluates the overall situation.", 
    "60": "To evaluate the short-term and long-term effectiveness of propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy for hypertension, 683 hypertensive men were randomized to treatment with either propranolol or hydrochlorothiazide. Both drugs increased the average fasting plasma glucose level by approximately 5 mg/dl after 10 weeks (p less than 0.001) and 1 year (p less than 0.001) of treatment, but the elevation persisted only in the propranolol-treated group 1 month after discontinuing the year-long treatment (p less than 0.01). A subset of 191 patients had 2-hour glucose tolerance tests. Hydrochlorothiazide increased the average 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result by 18.0 mg/dl after 10 weeks (p less than 0.001), an increase significantly higher than that induced by propranolol (p less than 0.012). After 1 year of treatment, however, propranolol also increased the average 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result (p less than 0.05) and there was no significant difference between drugs. The hyperglycemic effects were dose-related, which suggests that both drugs should be administered at their lowest effective dosage. The clinical importance of the persistent fasting plasma glucose elevation in propranolol-treated patients 1 month after discontinuing treatment is unknown.", 
    "61": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) induced by drugs, primarily hydralazine and procainamide, is reviewed and compared with idiopathic SLE, and the use of these drugs in patients with idiopathic SLE is discussed. The etiology of SLE is unclear, but genetic predisposition is an important factor. Although more than 25 drugs have been suggested as causes of SLE, the majority of confirmed cases of drug-induced SLE involve hydralazine or procainamide. Parts of these chemical compounds apparently interact with nucleoproteins, causing stimulation of antinuclear antibody (ANA) production. The average age of patients with drug-induced SLE is nearly twice that of patients with idiopathic SLE. Approximately half the patients with drug-induced SLE are women, compared with 92% of patients with idiopathic SLE. For SLE induced by hydralazine or procainamide, musculoskeletal symptoms (especially arthritis in the hands and wrists) are the most common clinical manifestation. In patients with SLE induced by these drugs, ANAs and LE cells are present, erythrocyte sedimentation rate is often elevated, and a false-positive serologic test for syphilis is seen more frequently than in idiopathic SLE. Baseline ANA status should be determined before therapy with these drugs, and patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of SLE. Hydralazine-induced SLE may be dose related; limiting the daily dose to 200 mg is recommended. Some drugs have been shown to exacerbate idiopathic SLE; these include estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and ibuprofen. Hydralazine and procainamide are probably safe for use in patients with idiopathic SLE, but alternative therapy should be considered. The clinical and laboratory manifestations of drug-induced SLE are similar to those of idiopathic SLE, but central nervous system and renal involvement are rare in drug-induced SLE.", 
    "62": "The selection, use, and potential adverse effects of antihypertensive agents in patients with glucose intolerance are reviewed. Thiazide diuretics frequently impair glucose tolerance, but this deterioration is usually modest and should not preclude use of these agents in most patients with glucose intolerance. The loop diuretics furosemide and ethacrynic acid have also been associated with decreased glucose tolerance. The beta-adrenergic blocking agents may inhibit insulin secretion, but few patients will experience clinically important elevations in blood glucose. Rather than producing glucose intolerance, these agents may delay recovery from hypoglycemic episodes and may mask catecholamine-induced symptoms of hypoglycemia. In certain cases, use of cardioselective beta blockers or avoidance of beta-blocker therapy may be indicated, especially in insulin-dependent diabetics. The calcium-channel blocking agents nifedipine and verapamil have been reported to produce diabetogenic effects in a few studies, but further investigations are needed to define the extent of these effects. Available evidence indicates that sympatholytic agents such as guanethidine and reserpine, alpha 2-adrenergic agonists such as methyldopa and clonidine, the alpha 1-blocking agent prazosin, and the vasodilators captopril and hydralazine produce few, if any, clinically important changes in glucose tolerance. While no antihypertensive agents are absolutely contraindicated in patients with glucose intolerance, patients with glucose intolerance who are receiving thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, and calcium-channel blocking agents should be monitored with extra care for hyperglycemia or deterioration in glucose tolerance.", 
    "63": "The R-enantiomer of timolol, L-714,465, is considerably less potent as a beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist in animals than timolol, whilst only slightly less potent in reducing intraocular pressure. If the same was true in man L-714,465 would have potential benefits over timolol in the treatment of glaucoma. The extent of bronchial beta-adrenoceptor blockade following one eyedrop in each eye of timolol 1% and L-714,465 1% was compared in six normal subjects, by measuring the displacement of the bronchodilator dose-response curve to isoprenaline following each drug compared to the isoprenaline dose-response curve after placebo eyedrops (methyl-cellulose). There was no significant difference between the dose-response curves to L-714,465 and placebo, but a significant displacement of the dose-response curve following timolol. The geometric mean dose ratio following timolol (21) differed significantly from that following L-714,465 (1.6). Heart rate at the end of the isoprenaline dose-response study was lower after timolol, despite the fact that subjects had received higher doses of isoprenaline. The trend was in the same direction after L-714,465 when compared with placebo though less marked. L-714,465 clearly causes less beta-adrenoceptor blockade than timolol when given as 1% eyedrops. The effects of L-714,465 1% on the airways and heart rate did not differ significantly from placebo in these six subjects but the pattern of response would be most consistent with L-714,465 having some beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity though considerably less than timolol.", 
    "64": "The symptoms associated with performance anxiety, or the so-called stage fright syndrome, are similar to those of alpha and beta adrenergic stimulation. Suppression of symptoms and improvement in instrumentalist's performance after beta blockade suggest that this modality would be of benefit for singers as well. To evaluate the dose-effect relationship of beta blockade upon singing performance and the possible effect of these agents upon performance maturation, we studied 34 singing students during end of semester juries, using a double-blind crossover paradigm. Students performed once with either placebo, 20, 40, or 80 mg of nadolol, and again 48 hours later, with placebo. There was a significant dose-related, limiting effect upon intraperformance cardiac rate. A small, but statistically significant, dichotomous effect upon performance rating was noted: low-dose nadolol tended to enhance performance, whereas larger doses impaired performance. We conclude that the effects of low dose beta blockade upon singing are minimally helpful and high doses may detract from performance ability.", 
    "65": "beta-Adrenoceptor blockers (beta-blockers) are common first-choice drugs in the treatment of various cardiovascular disorders. Physical exercise performed during single-dose administration of beta-blockers, however, is associated with an increased rate of perceived exertion; an effect which appears to be partly reduced with long term treatment. Although clinical doses of beta-blockade may reduce heart rate by 30 to 35%, during maximal exercise cardiac output is not equally reduced. Accordingly, most studies have demonstrated increased stroke volume after beta-blockade. This reduction in heart rate is typically accompanied by a decreased VO2max (5 to 15%) in both patients and healthy, trained subjects. This smaller reduction in VO2max, as compared with the decrease in cardiac output, is the result of a partly compensating increased arteriovenous O2 difference. Work capacity as reflected by the ability to perform intense short term or more prolonged steady-state exercise is also impaired following beta-blockade. beta-Adrenoceptors can be subdivided into types beta 1- and beta 2. Blockers which are specific for either beta 1-receptors (beta 1-selective blockers) or both beta 1- and beta 2 receptors (non-selective blockers) differ with regard to their effect on exercise performance. Exercise performance ability, irrespective of exercise intensity and duration, is impaired to a greater extent following non-selective than beta 1-selective blockade at equal reductions in heart rate. This response stems from a decreased energy flux through glycogenolysis during non-selective blockade treatment. Individuals receiving beta-blockade medication therefore show greater adaptive response to physical conditioning during treatment with beta 1-selective than non-selective blockade probably because of greater training intensity with the former therapy. Neither psychomotor performance nor muscular strength and power is negatively affected by beta-blockade. Nevertheless, the ability to perform athletic events requiring high levels of motor control under emotional stress but not high levels of aerobic or anaerobic energy release, is probably increased during beta-blockade.", 
    "66": "An affinity label for beta-adrenoceptors, N-(bromoacetyl)-N'-[3-(o-allylphenoxy)-2-hydroxypropyl]-1,8-dia min o-p-menthane, has been extensively used in the form of a mixture of four isomers. In the present study, all four isomers were isolated, their structures elucidated, and their interactions with beta-adrenoceptors characterized. The isomer with the aromatic (pharmacophore) group on carbon 1 of p-menthane and with the Z configuration (Z-1) predominates in the mixture and has the highest affinity for beta-adrenoceptors of rat heart (KD = 3 X 10(-8) M) and lungs (KD = 2 X 10(-8) M). This isomer acts as a ligand that binds irreversibly at the drug binding site of the receptor (i.e., after treatment and extensive washing of the membrane preparation, the concentration of the receptors is decreased in a dose-dependent manner), while binding characteristics of the remaining receptors are not changed. The corresponding E diastereomer (E-1) also binds irreversibly to the drug binding site of the receptor. The isomer with the aromatic group on carbon 8 and the Z configuration (Z-8) modifies the receptor noticeably only at higher concentrations and then on a site apparently different from the drug-binding site, i.e., affinity of receptors after the treatment and washing is changed. The corresponding E diastereomer (E-8) modified both the drug-binding and alternative binding site. The results suggest that there is some flexibility in the conformation of the beta-adrenoceptor that enables pairs of ligands, differing by axial or equatorial positions of critical groups, to alkylate the receptor in an analogous manner.", 
    "67": "The stereoisomers of 2-[(tert-butylamino)methyl]-7-methyl-2,7-benzofurandimethanol (2) and 2-[2-(tert-butylamino)-1-hydroxyethyl]-7-benzofuranyl methyl ketone (3), the alcohol and ketone metabolites of bufuralol, have been prepared and examined for beta-adrenoceptor activity in rats. All the stereoisomers with the S configuration hydroxylamine side chain showed potent beta 2-antagonist activity comparable to (S)-bufuralol (1a). In contrast, a wide range of antagonist potencies was observed at the beta 1-receptor; only alcohol diastereomer 9a was more active than 1a. This suggests that the shape of the 7-substituent in these benzofurans influences the degree of interaction with the beta 1-receptor much more than with the beta 2-receptor. Partial beta 1-agonist activity was associated not only with all the stereoisomers with the S configuration hydroxylamine side chain but also with some of the R configuration derivatives, especially (R)-ketone 3b. The results suggest that the margin of difference in beta-adrenoceptor activity between compounds epimeric at the hydroxylamine side chain can be significantly influenced by a suitable substituent in the aromatic nucleus.", 
    "68": "Hyperglycaemia lasting for hours, has been produced in unanesthetized cats, rabbits and rats by injection into the cerebral ventricles or the cisterna magna of a variety of drugs (morphine, etorphine, pethidine, beta-endorphin, enkephalin, bombesin, TRH, cholecystokinin, naloxone, propranolol, phentolamine, chloralose, magnesium chloride and GABA). These drugs probably act at the ventral surface of the brainstem and initiate a sympathetic discharge to the adrenals which results in a prolonged release of relatively small amounts of adrenaline. When adrenaline is released in this way hyperglycaemia may be the only effect. The mechanism of the piq\u00fbre hyperglycaemia of Claude Bernard may be the same, although Bernard assumed that it resulted from an effect on the floor of the fourth ventricle, i.e. on the dorsal surface of the brainstem. However, it is clear from his description that his trochar not only pricked the floor of the fourth ventricle but penetrated to the ventral surface of the brainstem. Release of adrenaline from the adrenals is usually regarded as a stress response, as in fight, flight, fear or rage when it is suddenly released in large amounts and produces its typical cardiovascular and ocular reactions. The results now obtained with drugs injected intraventricularly or intracisternally suggest an additional physiological role for adrenaline when it is released over prolonged periods and in relatively small amounts producing only hyperglycaemia. Such a release may play a role in the day-to-day control of blood glucose, and its disturbance might underlie non-insulin-dependent diabetes.", 
    "69": "There is preliminary evidence suggesting that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction may be mediated by slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), which is comprised of leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4. We studied the effects of the SRS-A antagonist FPL 57231 (FPL) on the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor response and on systemic vascular resistance in awake, chronically instrumented young lambs. Two other studies were performed to ascertain whether FPL's vasodilation was specific for hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction: the effect of FPL infusion in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance was measured in six normoxic lambs, and the effect of FPL on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-mediated vasoconstriction was determined. In seven lambs, mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 21 mmHg in room air and 28 mmHg in hypoxia (Po2 = 43 Torr). During hypoxia, FPL infusion (2 mg X kg-1 X min-1) reversibly decreased pulmonary arterial pressure to 15 mmHg; pulmonary arteriolar resistance also fell below normoxia levels with FPL. FPL also caused a fall in aortic pressure and systemic vascular resistance in these hypoxic lambs, but the decrease in systemic resistance was less than the fall in pulmonary resistance. beta-Adrenergic blockade using propranolol (1 mg/kg) did not affect the pulmonary vasodilation caused by FPL. In six normoxic lambs, FPL infusion also significantly decreased pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance (29% in each case). These data are consistent with the idea that leukotrienes may be involved in adjusting both pulmonary and systemic vascular tone, but further work is necessary to establish whether FPL's vasodilation is mediated via its leukotriene antagonism or is a nonspecific effect of FPL.", 
    "70": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, an independent coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factor, is inversely associated with CHD. Whether interventions to increase concentrations of HDL--particularly the HDL2, HDL3, and apolipoprotein A1 subfractions--will reduce the incidence of CHD in high-risk patients is thus an area of intense speculation. Both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic regimens will raise HDL concentrations. Nonpharmacologic approaches include habitual high-level aerobic exercise and weight loss--both of these somewhat more effective in men than in women--cessation of cigarette smoking, and changing of dietary habits. A number of drugs have been found to elevate HDL cholesterol. These include the bile acid-binding resin cholestyramine, nicotinic acid, gemfibrozil, phenytoin, exogenous estrogens, and alcohol. Terbutaline has also been reported to raise HDL cholesterol. It is not yet known whether, and to what degree, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic elevation of HDL cholesterol will retard or reverse the progression of atherosclerosis. Conversely, HDL cholesterol is lowered by a broad variety of drugs, including anabolic--androgenic steroids, exogenous progestins, and probucol, which are used therapeutically to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Some agents used to treat hypertension also reduce HDL cholesterol, especially thiazide diuretics and the beta blockers, with the possible exception of pindolol. In the antiadrenergic class of antihypertensive agents, reserpine and methyldopa lower HDL cholesterol, but the alpha blocker prazosin does not appear to affect HDL cholesterol. The alpha agonist guanabenz has no effect on HDL cholesterol, and the vasodilator carprazidil has been reported to raise HDL cholesterol. In light of these facts, investigations should be undertaken to determine whether the metabolic effects of antihypertensive agents blunt their beneficial effects on CHD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Bitemporal injections of puromycin that primarily affect the hippocampal-entorhinal area induce amnesia of aversive maze-learning in mice for 3 days after training but are ineffective 6 or more days after training. At these later times, additional puromycin sites covering widespread forebrain areas are necessary to induce amnesia, a result that we attribute to the cerebral spread of the engram during the 6-day period. We have reported that blockade of about 60% of cerebral beta-adrenergic receptors by a single, subcutaneous injection of (-)-propranolol, a nonselective beta-receptor antagonist, inhibited engram spread for 60-90 days, at which time engram spread spontaneously occurred. In the present experiments using single doses of antagonists that appeared to block 60% of beta 2- or beta 1-adrenergic receptors, it was found that the selective beta 2 antagonist ICI 118,551 was without effect on engram spread, whereas the selective beta 1 antagonist betaxolol inhibited the spread for at least 3 months. Propranolol's effect consequently appears to be accounted for by its blockade of beta 1 receptors.", 
    "72": "After reviewing the available data on drug-induced hyperkalemia, we conclude that the situation has not improved since Lawson quantitatively documented the substantial risks of potassium chloride over a decade ago (90). As discussed, the risk of developing hyperkalemia in hospital remains at least at the range of 1 to 2% and can reach 10%, depending on the definition used (Table 2). Potassium chloride supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics remain the major culprits but they have been joined by a host of new actors, e.g., salt substitutes, beta-blockers, converting enzyme inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, and heparin, among others. Readily identifiable risk factors (other than drugs) for developing hyperkalemia are well-known but seem to be consistently ignored, even in teaching hospitals. The presence of diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, hypoaldosteronism, and age greater than 60 years results in a substantial increase in the risk of hyperkalemia from the use of any of the drugs we have reviewed. If prevention of hyperkalemia is the goal, as it should be, the current widespread and indiscriminate use of potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics will need to end. We remain intrigued by Burchell's prescient pronouncement of over a decade ago that \"more lives have been lost than saved by potassium therapy\" (28).", 
    "73": "Effects of intrarenal infusions of prazosin (0.7 microgram/kg/min), yohimbine (1 microgram/kg/min), propranolol (4 micrograms/kg/min) and sulpiride (20 micrograms/kg/min) on renal prostaglandin (PG) E2 and renin release in response to renal nerve stimulation (RNS) were examined in anesthetized dogs. RNS (2.5-5 Hz, for 10 min) decreased renal blood flow and increased both PGE2 and renin secretion rates. The blood flow response was inhibited by prazosin but not by other antagonists. Prazosin and propranolol, but not yohimbine or sulpiride, attenuated the renin response. However, none of these antagonists affected the PGE2 response. The results suggest that the RNS-induced renin release is mediated by alpha adrenoceptors, which seem to be alpha-1 type, and beta adrenoceptors, but the RNS-induced PGE2 release is not mediated by these adrenoceptors. Renal dopaminergic component may play no significant role in the RNS-induced PGE2 or renin release.", 
    "74": "Short-term food deprivation (FD) of preweanling rat pups causes a marked and specific suppression of liver ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) induction by alpha and beta adrenergic agonists that is mediated by postreceptor mechanisms. In the present study, we demonstrate that FD also affects the ability of adrenergic agonists to induce hepatic ODC in older animals and that these changes differ from those occurring in neonates in the duration of FD associated with changes, the subcellular mechanisms involved and the organ specificity of the effect. FD (48 hr) of 30-day-old rats caused a specific suppression of liver ODC induction by the alpha agonist phenylephrine whereas the effect of the beta agonist isoproterenol was not changed. ODC induction by vasopressin or angiotensin was unaffected, whereas the effect of aminophylline was potentiated. FD of 30-day-old rats caused a marked suppression of both alpha and beta agonist action in the heart. FD of mature (60-day-old) rats was associated with an enhanced hepatic ODC response to phenylephrine and isoproterenol. Whereas the number of receptors in heart assessed by the binding of [3H]prazosin and [125I]pindolol to alpha and beta receptors, respectively, decreased in parallel with changes in responsivity, liver ODC responses did not correlate well with receptor changes. These findings support previous findings of altered sympathetic responsivity in heart, liver and fat during FD and indicate that the sympathetic nervous system responds to FD with a complex series of changes in both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms.", 
    "75": "The effect of intravenous nicardipine, a new calcium antagonist, on haemodynamics, left ventricular function and angina induced by atrial pacing has been investigated in patients with coronary artery disease. Patients were treated with beta-blockers and measurements were made at a fixed heart rate. Nicardipine produced a 24% fall in mean systemic blood pressure (P less than 0.02) and a 37% increase in cardiac index (P less than 0.02). Cardiac filling pressures, dp/dt max and left ventricular ejection fraction were unaltered. The time to pacing induced angina was prolonged (P less than 0.05) when the dose of nicardipine (0.75 mg X min-1) was selected not to cause an excessive fall in blood pressure. Nicardipine is a powerful arteriodilator without detectable negative inotropic effects and prolongs the time to pacing induced angina."
