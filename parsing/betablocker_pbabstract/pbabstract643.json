    "0": "During summer months high doses of acetylcholine produced positive inotropic and chronotropic actions in 19 out of 22 preparations of atropinised perfused heart of the frog. Hexamethonium failed to block both the positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of Ach. Interestingly another ganglion blocking agent mecamylamine as well as beta adrenergic blocking agent propranolol blocked the positive inotropic action but not the positive chronotropic action.", 
    "1": "Minute pieces of rat parotid gland were used in studies of adrenergic regulation of K+ efflux using 86Rb+ as a probe for K+. Noradrenaline induced a concentration-dependent RB+ efflux, whereas the beta 1-selective agonist prenalterol was without effect. On the other hand, the beta 2-selective drug, terbutaline, at high concentrations displayed a small enhancement of Rb+-secretion. The selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor drug, phenylephrine, was as potent as noradrenaline, whereas the alpha 2-agonist clonidine had only a small effect. The noradrenaline-induced Rb+-efflux was effectively inhibited in the presence of prazosin, an alpha 1-blocker, whereas the alpha 2-antagonist, yohimbine, was roughly 50 times less potent. The results suggest that catecholamine-induced K+-secretion from the rat parotid gland is mediated via activation of post-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptors of the alpha 1-subtype.", 
    "2": "To examine the factors contributing to the rise in systemic blood pressure during alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation, phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, and norepinephrine, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist, were infused intravenously to anesthetized dogs until mean aortic blood pressure was raised equally by 40-60 mmHg. Changes in preload were estimated by changes in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or segment length recorded by an ultrasonic technique. By obstructing the inferior vena cava (IVC), the increase in preload could be reduced to control level during phenylephrine and norepinephrine infusions without altering peripheral resistance (mean aortic blood pressure/cardiac output). Normalization of preload reduced the pressure response by 2/3 during phenylephrine infusion and by 1/4 during norepinephrine infusion. However, after beta-adrenergic blockade by propranolol, normalization of preload reduced the pressure response by 2/3 during both phenylephrine and norepinephrine infusions. Thus, during alpha-adrenergic stimulation, the increase in preload is a more important factor than the increase in peripheral resistance. Norepinephrine raised stroke volume by 24 +/- 5%. When the increase in stroke volume was prevented by IVC obstruction, the pressure response to norepinephrine was halved. Thus, during norepinephrine infusion the rise in stroke volume caused by beta-adrenergic stimulation is as important as alpha-adrenergic stimulation for the pressure response.", 
    "3": "The effect of Chinoin-103 (CH-103) was examined on the electrophysiological and mechanical properties of the isolated guinea-pig atrial and ventricular myocardium and on membrane ionic currents of the frog atrial trabeculae using glass-microelectrode and voltage clamp techniques. In the guinea-pig atrial and ventricular myocardium, CH-103 had no effect on the resting membrane potential, but decreased the action potential overshoot and maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax). CH-103 exerted a negative inotropic effect on both preparations. The drug (10(-5) M) consistently shifted the membrane responsiveness curve to more negative potentials. CH-103 rapidly abolished the membrane electrogenesis in myocardial preparations pretreated with 5 mM MnCl2. The slow action potentials induced in K+-depolarized preparations by caffeine were slightly reduced, whereas the isoproterenol-induced ones were markedly depressed by the drug. In voltage clamp experiments, CH-103 strongly reduced the fast inward Na+ current, but hardly decreased the slow inward Ca2+ current and the delayed outward K+ current. These results suggest that CH-103 has both membrane stabilizing and beta-blocking effects, and can explain the antiarrhythmic action of CH-103.", 
    "4": "In the present study the role of beta-receptors in the behavioral action of somatostatin was investigated. Somatostatin inhibited extinction of the active avoidance behavior. Propranolol alone had no action on this behavior but significantly inhibited the peptide-induced effect. In the open-field test somatostatin induced locomotor activation; propranolol did not influence this effect of the peptide. Somatostatin inhibited electroconvulsive shock-induced amnesia. Propranolol alone had no action in this test, but significantly decreased the antiamnesic effect of the peptide. These results suggest that the central beta-receptors play an important role in the behavioral action of somatostatin.", 
    "5": "In a short-term study the pressure-lowering effects of Metipranolol 0.3% and Timolol 0.25% were compared in eyes with open-angle glaucoma by means of one-drop curves, diurnal pressure curves and tonography. It appears that these two drugs may be regarded as equal in respect of extent and duration of action. Aqueous humor outflow was facilitated slightly by both drugs, although increase was only statistically significant with Metipranolol.", 
    "6": "A study of adrenal mineral corticoid function in adolescents with primary arterial hypertension, stage Ib, revealed hyperaldosteronism in more than half of the patients (57%). Treatment with beta-blocking agents (anaprilin and obsidan) was only effective (producing a drop in arterial pressure) in patients with initial high plasma aldosterone levels. beta-blocking agents administered to patients with normal blood aldosterone content did not result in arterial pressure change (failure of treatment). The results obtained suggest that the effect of beta-blocking agents on adrenal mineral corticoid activity in adolescent patients with primary arterial hypertension depends on its baseline level; they are also indicative of a dependence of the hypotensive effect of beta-adrenoreceptor blockers on the state of mineral corticoid function.", 
    "7": "1 During the three years 1978--1980 the Swedish Poison Information Centre received reports of 184 patients hospitalized due to beta-adrenoceptor blocker overdosage. Of the 35 patients who developed signs of severe cardiac dysfunction (HR less than 50 beats/min, systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg), 23 had ingested propranolol, 10 metoprolol and 2 alprenolol. 2 The mean value of the defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day in Sweden during these years were 11.97 for propranolol, 8.02 for alprenolol and 7.74 for metoprolol. The incidence of severe poisoning due to alprenolol overdosage is lower than expected according to DDD. 3 During 1979 19 persons died from overdosage with beta-adrenoceptor blockers in Sweden: 15 due to propranolol (non-selective, lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic activity), 2 to metoprolol (cardioselective, lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic activity). These findings indicate that severe and even fatal poisoning may occur regardless of the type of beta-blocking agent. 4 The usefulness of prenalterol, a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor partial agonist, in reversing unwanted cardiac effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents is illustrated by two cases of massive propranolol intoxication (maximal plasma concentrations of propranolol 7.2 and 7.8 mumol/l respectively). Prenalterol in high doses (130 and 280 mg/24 h respectively) restored cardiac function.", 
    "8": "Effects of some vasodilating (dipyridamole, nifedipine and verapamil) and antihypertensive (propranolol, hydralazine) drugs on arachidonic acid metabolism in isolated rat aorta and lung have been studied. Dipyridamole significantly increased the formation of PGI2 in aorta and lung. Nifedipine and verapamil decreased the formation of PGI2 in aorta, these drugs though significantly increased the formation of PGI2 in lung. Nifedipine showed no appreciable effect on the generation of TxA2 in rat aorta but in lung both nifedipine and verapamil reduced TxA2 formation though significantly only in the latter case. Dipyridamole showed no effect. The beneficial effect of dipyridamole, seems, at least in part, to be due to its ability to enhance the production of PGI2 both in the aorta and lung, and probably in other tissues as well. Nifedipine and verapamil may show their antianginal effect by a combined effect of enhanced PGI2 and reduced TxA2 formation in lung. In lung, whereas hydralazine reduced the formation of both PGI2 and TxA2, propranolol increased the formation of PGI2. Hydralazine reduced the formation of TxA2 and increased PGI2 formation in aorta. The effect of the drugs on the ability of rat aorta to inhibit collagen induced platelet aggregation of human blood platelets was also examined.", 
    "9": "The effects of 90 min intravenous histamine (10 micrograms base . kg-1 . min-1) with and without beta (propranolol)-receptor blockade on lung water and hemodynamics were studied. In anesthetized dogs cold 3% saline was used as the indicator to determine cardiac index, central blood volume, and lung extravascular thermal volume. Propranolol alone decreased stroke volume and cardiac index but increased central blood volume, total peripheral resistance, and mean pulmonary arterial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures. Pulmonary vascular resistance, mean arterial pressure, and lung extravascular thermal volume were not changed. Histamine with propranolol further reduced stroke volume and cardiac index, whereas mean pulmonary arterial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures returned to control values. Mean arterial pressure, central blood volume, and total peripheral resistance decreased, pulmonary vascular resistance increased, and lung extravascular thermal volume remained unchanged. In all experiments postmortem extravascular lung water-to-dry weight ratio was unchanged. We conclude that histamine does not increase lung water content and that beta-receptor blockade does not modify this response.", 
    "10": "Changes in cardiorespiratory variables and perceived rate of exertion (RPE) were studied in 13 trained men performing cycling exercise before and after beta-adrenergic blockade. Propranolol (Inderal, 80 mg) was administered orally 2 h prior to standardized maximal and submaximal exercises. Muscle biopsies were obtained from vastus lateralis at rest for subsequent histochemical analyses of muscle fiber type distribution and capillary supply. During submaximal exercise O2 consumption decreased from 2.76 to 2.59 l . min-1 following blockade (P less than 0.01), whereas heart rate decreased from 157 to 113 beats . min-1 (P less than 0.001). Maximal O2 uptake was lowered from 3.79 to 3.26 l . min-1 (P less than 0.001) and maximal heart rate was reduced from 192 to 142 beats . min-1 (P less than 0.001) as a result of the blockade. Pulmonary ventilation was unaltered in both exercise conditions. \"Local\" RPE was higher (P less than 0.001) than \"central\" RPE after beta-blockade in both submaximal and maximal exercise. During normal condition this difference did not appear. Changes in both local and central RPE during submaximal exercise were positively correlated to changes in O2 uptake. Individual variations in the metabolic profile of the exercising muscle had no influence on beta-blockade-induced changes in O2 uptake. It is concluded that blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors reduces O2 consumption during submaximal (approximately 73% maximal O2 uptake) and maximal exercise in habitually trained men.", 
    "11": "The adsorption of beta-adrenoceptor blockers and the partial beta-adrenoceptor agonist prenalterol was studied in an in vitro haemoperfusion (HP) model. Metoprolol, alprenolol, propranolol and prenalterol adsorb well from the blood to the resin with extraction ratios nearing 1.0. Extraction ratio for practolol was 0.68 and for atenolol 0.49. Protein binding has little effect on the degree of adsorption, which is more dependent on water solubility.", 
    "12": "As the number of military pilots over the age of 40 increases, open-angle glaucoma becomes an important aeromedical problem. Epinephrine ophthalmic solution is the only antiglaucomatotic agent in use among flying personnel. Timolol maleate, a new antiglaucomatotic agent, is a nonselective beta-blocker. This drug has a potent hypotensive effect on intraocular pressure with a minimal effect on visual functions. Our data show that it significantly decreases the pulse rate and may eventually be a basis for cardiac dysrythmias.", 
    "13": "Pregnancy increases the work demands on the heart by increasing blood volume and thereby cardiac output. Therefore, in pregnant patients with organic heart disease, arrhythmias may have significant hemodynamic consequences to the mother with harm to the fetus. As a result of improved medical therapy, an increasing number of women with cardiac diseases or rhythm disorders reach their reproductive years and require medication. Information on the effect of antiarrhythmic agents on the human fetus as well as the possible changes in therapeutic response during the altered state of pregnancy is limited. In principle, the approach to the treatment of arrhythmias in pregnant patients is similar to that in nonpregnant patients. Special consideration, however, must be given with regard to drug selection and dosage in order to avoid adverse effects on the mother and fetus.", 
    "14": "Ventricular ectopy that is bothersome to the patient warrants treatment, but the asymptomatic cases present the physician with a dilemma of whether or not treatment is justified. In patients free of organic heart disease, antiarrhythmic therapy does not appear to be necessary. Post myocardial infarction (MI) patients should be considered for beta-blocker therapy regardless of the presence of ventricular ectopy. In the post-MI patient with risk factors for sudden death, treatment of complex dysrhythmia may be warranted, despite the lack of documented benefit.", 
    "15": "The beta blocker DL-1-(2-nitro-3-methyl-phenoxy)-3-tert-butylamino-propan-2-ol (ZAMI 1305), hepatocarcinogenic to the female rat, and the nononcogenic beta blockers DL-1-(2-nitro-5-methyl-phenoxy)-3-tert-butylamino-propan-2-ol (ZAMI 1327), DL-propranolol, and DL-atenolol were tested for their capacity to damage liver DNA in vitro and in vivo. As revealed by alkaline sucrose gradient analysis, all the beta blockers tested, with the exception of DL-atenolol, caused a dose-dependent DNA fragmentation when they were added in vitro to nuclei isolated from livers of both male and female Wistar rats. Analysis of the DNA sedimentation patterns in neutral sucrose gradients demonstrated the absence of DNA fragmentation, thus indicating that the drugs did not induce double-strand DNA breaks. When the beta blockers were administered in vivo, liver DNA damage was observed only in female Wistar rats treated with ZAMI 1305. A single injection of ZAMI 1305 caused the onset of two distinct episodes of DNA damage. The first episode occurred within 5 minutes, and the damage was repaired within 1 hour after the injection; the second, apparently spontaneous, episode occurred 14 hours after the injection, and the damage was more pronounced than that seen in the first episode and took a much longer time to subside. However, a second injection of ZAMI 1305 into female Wistar rats 8 hours after the first injection did not induce the immediate short-lived episode of DNA damage but, like the first injection, it caused late DNA damage that peaked about 16 hours after drug administration.", 
    "16": "The effects of ketamine and its interaction with naloxone were studied on the transmurally stimulated guinea-pig ileum preparation. Ketamine (at concentrations between 10(-4) and 10(-3) M) depressed the contractions of the ileum, showing a very steep log concentration-effect curve. Naloxone partially reversed the depressant effect of ketamine at slightly higher concentrations (between 10 nM and 1 microM) than those normally required to reverse opiate depression in this tissue. Naloxone did not affect pentobarbitone-induced depression, suggesting that ketamine has specific actions on opiate transmission. Phentolamine and propranolol did not affect the ketamine-induced depression, whereas acetylcholinesterase inhibition did not alter the action of naloxone on this depression. Ketamine showed some reversal effect on the depressant action of morphine and caused contractions of the morphine-tolerant ileum, suggesting that it may have opiate antagonist activity. Inhibition of peptidase enzymes by a mixture of dipeptides potentiated the depression after high-frequency stimulation of the ileum, but did not affect the action of ketamine. The results suggest that ketamine may interact with opiate mechanisms in the ileum to produce part of its depressant action and may also have some opiate antagonist activity.", 
    "17": "Graded doses of norepinephrine and methoxamine were given to rabbits over a standard 90-minute infusion period to assess their potential for inducing myocardial injury. Lesions of myofiber necrosis and leukocytic infiltration were graded semiquantitatively in animals killed 2 days later. A close correlation was found between the dose of norepinephrine and the histological score (r = 0.912, P less than 0.001). Mean arterial pressure rose from 100 mm Hg to a maximum of 129 mm Hg, and averaged 115 mm Hg during infusion of 2 micrograms/min per kg. However, heart rate fell from 287 beats/min to average 208 beats/min. The pressure-rate product, an index of metabolic demand, showed no significant change and did not differ from saline-infused controls. Beta-adrenergic blockade with practolol (4 mg/kg) or propranolol (1 mg/kg) failed to significantly reduce cardiac injury with norepinephrine. However, alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine (10 mg), alone or in combination with either of the beta-antagonists, markedly reduced lesion formation as reflected by the histological score (P less than 0.02). Administration of the alpha-agonist methoxamine produced dose-related increases in the intensity of myocardial injury (r = 0.938, P less than 0.01), morphologically identical with those resulting from norepinephrine. Hemodynamic changes also were comparable. Phentolamine markedly reduced methoxamine injury. It may be concluded from these studies that norepinephrine cardiomyopathy results in large part from activation of the alpha-adrenergic system in the rabbit model. Ischemia or a supply-demand mismatch are unlikely mechanisms. We speculate that alterations in myofiber Ca++ translocation, uptake, and binding induced by alpha 1-receptor activation may contribute to membrane damage.", 
    "18": "It has been shown in experiments on anesthetized guinea-pigs that (+/-) and (+) propranolol produced a dose-dependent increase in the resistance of the air ways. Meanwhile oxprenolol, trimepranol and atenolol had a poor bronchoconstrictor effect, and labetalol evoked no changes in the tone of the bronchi. On an isolated trachea of the guinea-pig both forms of propranolol, as well as trimepranol and oxprenolol produced contractions, atenolol did not cause any changes in the tone of the smooth muscles, while labetalol made the smooth muscles relax. It has been also demonstrated on an isolated trachea that pretreatment with atropine, diphenhydramine, and diethylamide of lysergic acid did not lead to any noticeable changes in the bronchoconstrictive action of propranolol. At the same time verapamil and Ca2+-free Krebs solution reversed the propranolol effect.", 
    "19": "Elevated peripheral vascular resistance is usually significant in patients with arterial hypertension. Peripheral vasodilation is caused by calcium antagonists and thus elevated blood pressure can be lowered effectively. Primarily verapamil (i.v.) and nifedipine (sublingual) have been proved to be effective in hypertensive crises. A similar effect of lowering the blood pressure is caused in chronic arterial hypertension by the calcium antagonists verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine, which seems to correspond to the effect of beta-blockers. Side effects are rare and in most cases innocuous and passing.", 
    "20": "The stimulation of cyclic AMP and lipolysis by LY79771, a phenethanolamine antiobesity compound, and its 3 stereoisomers in adipose tissue of obese viable yellow mice and normal mice were studied. Both activities were stereo-specific with LY79771, the R,S isomer, and LY79730, the R,R isomer, being more potent than LY103085, the S,S isomer, and LY103672, the S,R isomer. Propranolol, a nonspecific beta-antagonist, completely inhibited the elevation of cyclic AMP and lipolysis whereas atenolol, a specific beta 1 antagonist, inhibited the elevation of cyclic AMP but did not completely inhibit lipolysis. These findings indicate that the elevation of cyclic AMP was mediated by the beta 1-receptor whereas the stimulation of lipolysis was mediated by both the beta 1 and beta 2 receptors. The adipose tissue of the obese viable yellow mice responded to these compounds less than that of the normal mice.", 
    "21": "50 patients with confirmed hypertension were treated with endralazine, a new peripheral vasodilator, in addition to the beta-blocker, pindolol, to which they had not responded adequately. The blood pressure was lowered from 173/115 mm Hg to 143/87 mm Hg in the 34 slow acetylators and from 175/111 mm Hg to 140/84 mm Hg in the 16 fast acetylators. The dosages of both pindolol and endralazine were the same in both groups. It is concluded that the acetylator phenotype does not affect the therapeutic efficacy or dosage requirement of endralazine. It is suggested that this is because endralazine is metabolised mainly by hydrazone formation and only to a minor extent by acetylation.", 
    "22": "A new, hydrophilic beta-adrenergic receptor radioligand, (+/-)-[3H]CGP-12177 (4-(3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazole-2-on hydrochloride), was synthesized and radiolabeled to 40 Ci/mmol. The nonspecific binding of this compound to turkey erythrocyte ghosts and C6 glioma cell membranes was less than 5% of the total binding at five times the appropriate KD. Binding assays of intact C6 glioma cells also showed low nonspecific binding, less than 20% of the total binding at five times the appropriate KD. The affinities of the antagonists (-)- and (+)-propranolol as well as of the agonist (-)-isoproterenol were examined by their potency to displace various radioligands from intact C6 glioma cell and membrane preparations. With membrane preparations, both [3H] CGP-12177 and [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) were displaced stereospecifically by the antagonists (-)- and (+)-propranolol and the agonist (-)-isoproterenol. With whole cells, [3H]CGP-12177 and [3H]DHA behaved differently. [3H]DHA and [3H]carazolol could be stereospecifically displaced by antagonists but only partially displaced by agonists, while [3H]CGP-12177 could be completely displaced by both antagonists and agonists as in membranes. In contrast to [3H]CGP-12177, the lipophilic ligand [3H]DHA is actually taken up by cells. The inability of agonists to displace lipophilic radioligands from receptors on intact cells may not be due to a low affinity of agonists for receptors on cells, but to an agonist-induced change in the receptors which renders them inaccessible to hydrophilic agonists and antagonists. This change is likely to be their internalization into the cell.", 
    "23": "The effectiveness of fixed combination tablets of timolol 10 mg. hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and amiloride 2.5 mg (Moducrin) once daily in the control of blood pressure has been assessed in fully ambulant hypertensives by the technique of continuous intra-arterial recording. Highly significant blood pressure reduction (p less than 0.001) was obtained consistently throughout the whole day, confirming the potency and usefulness of the preparation for those patients who need more than one drug to control their blood pressure. 2. Blood pressure responses to both isometric and dynamic forms of exercise were also significantly lowered by combination therapy. 3. The addition of a diuretic to a beta-adrenoceptor blocker appears to be an advantage if the aim of treatment in hypertension is 24 h blood pressure control.", 
    "24": "During a double-blind trial in which patients with suspected myocardial infarction received metoprolol or placebo, we analyzed the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Metoprolol (15 mg intravenously) was given as soon as possible after admission, and thereafter 200 mg was given daily for three months. Antiarrhythmic drugs were given only for ventricular fibrillation and sustained ventricular tachycardia (greater than 60 beats per second). Definite acute myocardial infarction developed in 809 of the 1395 participants, and probable infarction in 162. Metoprolol did not influence the occurrence of premature ventricular contractions or short bursts of ventricular tachycardia. However, there were 17 cases of ventricular fibrillation in the placebo group (697 patients) and only 6 in the metoprolol group (698 patients, P less than 0.05). During the hospital stay significantly fewer patients receiving metoprolol (16) than placebo (38) (P less than 0.01) required lidocaine. In a separate analysis of 145 patients, metoprolol did not influence the occurrence of premature ventricular contractions or short bursts of ventricular tachycardia during the first 24 hours of treatment. Despite a lack of effect on less serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias, metoprolol had a prophylactic effect against ventricular fibrillation in acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "25": "1. The alpha-adrenergic agonists noradrenaline (in the presence of beta-blocker) and phenylephrine cause a transient stimulation of the respiration in isolated rat hepatocytes. After a lag period of 12s, this activation first attains its maximal value (+24%) for about 1 min and then falls to a sustained value (+15%). The effect is blocked by the alpha-antagonists phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine. It is dose-dependent, with an half-maximal stimulation by 16 nM-noradrenaline, which is similar to that found for other cell responses to the hormone. 2. Vasopressin and ATP, which in common with alpha-agonists are believed to increase intracellular [Ca2+], induce similar activation in the respiration rate. 3. The alpha-adrenergic-mediated respiration depends on extracellular Ca2+. The activation is decreased or abolished when extracellular [Ca2+] is decreased by adding EGTA, or when the Ca2+ antagonists Mn2+ and La3+ are present in the incubation medium. 4. It is suggested that the activation of the mitochondrial respiration rate results from the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, presumably via Ca2+ influx or Ca2+ release from the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum.", 
    "26": "Binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol to human platelet lysates is inhibited by (+/-)-propranolol and (+/-)-butoxamine, but less effectively by (+/-) practolol. (-)-Isoprenaline causes no significant inhibition of binding where stimulation of adenylate cyclase can be shown. Binding of [3H]-acetobutolol is also inhibited by (+/-)-propranolol. \"Specific\" binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol and [3H]-acetobutolol defined by (+/-) propranolol shows a non-classical saturation curve. 50% maximal binding is observed in the range 15-25 mM. The extent of \"specific\" binding is 2-fold greater for [3H]-dihydroalprenolol. Similar and rapid rates of binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol are observed at 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C. No stereoselectivity is observed for inhibition of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding by (+) and (-)-propranolol. Binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol and [3H]-acetobutolol may relate to the lipophilic character of these radioligands and does not represent interaction with beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "27": "It is now possible to record numerous ambulatory blood pressures by a noninvasive method using the Remler, a portable semi-automatic device. The blood pressure profiles obtained with this recorder in hypertensive patients during customary daily activities have revealed the existence of a circadian blood pressure variation. Thus, blood pressure is highest in the morning, lowest early in the afternoon and tends to increase again late in the afternoon. This circadian variation is not modified by treatment with diuretics and/or betablockers. These blood pressure recordings also made it possible to establish that antihypertensive therapy with these agents does not modify blood pressure variability over the day.", 
    "28": "A method for the determination of therapeutic levels of metoprolol in human plasma is presented. Metoprolol and the internal standard are extracted from the buffered plasma sample to an organic phase containing 4 X 10(-3) M phosgene. After 10 min the organic phase is taken to dryness. The residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate and the formed oxazolidine derivatives are analyzed by gas chromatography with nitrogen-selective detection. With packed columns, rectilinear standard curves through the origin were obtained down to 80 nmoles/l of plasma. The precision of the method at 200 nmoles/l was 1.5% (n = 8). The sensitivity of the method was improved by using capillary column gas chromatography. Linear standard curves were obtained down to 10 nmoles/l of metoprolol in plasma. The precision of the method at the 50 nmoles/l level was 2.2% (n = 7). With this simple and straightforward method using extractive derivatization 30 samples can be handled in a day.", 
    "29": "32 patients (13 women and 19 men) with slight to severe hypertension were treated during an open medium term study with acebutolol, a beta-antagonist which is cardioselective and at the same time has an intrinsic sympatheticomimetic effect. The average daily dose of the drug was 743 mg. In about 69% of the cases results were excellent or good, in 21% fair and in the remaining 9% no improvement was observed. Average cardiac frequency was 93 beats per minute before treatment started and about 90 days later this had fallen to 70.6 beats per minute. Almost no side effects were observed.", 
    "30": "Circadian adrenoceptor rhythms were measured in the cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum and pons-medulla of WKY and SHR rats. The 24-h mean binding to alpha 1-, and beta-adrenoceptors was higher in SHR than WKY in all regions:greatest differences were found at the end of the dark phase. The most consistent and large amplitude circadian rhythms in adrenoceptor binding occurred in the hypothalamus; strain differences in wave form of the rhythm were the most noticeable phenomenon. In the pons-medulla SHR rats showed decreased rhythm amplitudes. In the cerebellum, beta-adrenoceptor binding was higher in SHR rats at all time points, with an identical rhythm to that in WKY rats. Thus regional differences between SHR and WKY rats were expressed in changes in many circadian rhythm parameters. There were no differences between SHR and WKY in the ratios of pre-synaptic: post-synaptic receptors. High affinity binding to alpha-adrenoceptors showed similar circadian rhythms to total specific binding, indicating that the short-term fluctuations cannot be attributed to change in affinity state. Whether these modifications in circadian rhythm characteristics are related to the development or maintenance of hypertension in the SHR strain remains to be investigated.", 
    "31": "The antihypertensive effect of debrisoquine (20 mg/day), methyldopa (100 mg/day) and propranolol (160 mg/day) was compared to that obtained with a placebo in a controlled trial carried out by a group of 14 internists. Forty-eight patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were included. Mefruside (25 mg/day) was first given alone for 6 weeks (\"open phase\" of the trial) and to this diuretic was then added in double-blind fashion and randomized sequence a placebo or an active drug. Each of the 4 blind phases lasted 4 weeks. At the end of the \"open phase\", blood pressure in seated position averaged 168/111 +/- 19.6/13.5 mm Hg (mean +/- SD). A significant blood pressure decrease was observed after 4 weeks of treatment with the placebo as well as with the investigated compounds. With the placebo blood pressure was reduced to 158/102 +/- 19.6/13.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The magnitude of the additional blood pressure decrease induced by the active drugs was relatively small and varied from 4 (debrisoquine) to 10 mm Hg (methyldopa, p less than 0.01) for the systolic and from 3 (debrisoquine, p less than 0.05) to 5 mm Hg (propranolol, p less than 0.05) for the diastolic. The percentage of patients with systolic pressure of less than or equal to 140 mm Hg and with diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg during administration of either drug was not greater than 40 to 20% respectively. Propranolol appeared to be better tolerated than the other antihypertensive agents. These rather disappointing blood pressure results suggest that the efficacy of antihypertensive agents in private practice cannot be extrapolated from studies carried out in specialized hypertension clinics.", 
    "32": "The antifibrillatory properties of UM-272 (dimethylpropranolol; Pranolium) were evaluated in a conscious canine model of sudden coronary death. The initial preparation of the animal model was carried out under surgical anesthesia and involved the intraluminal implantation of a Teflon-coated silver wire into the circumflex coronary artery so that 3 mm of the bared electrode was in contact with the endothelial surface. The left anterior descending coronary artery then was occluded for a period of 90 min and reperfused in the presence of a critical stenosis. Three days after myocardial infarction, they were randomized into two groups. One group (n = 10) served as controls and received saline. The second group (n = 10) received UM-272 in a dose of 5 mg/kg every 6 h. On day 4, a 150 microA current was applied to the intimal surface of the left circumflex coronary artery, resulting in transient or permanent alterations in circumflex coronary blood flow accompanied by electrocardiographic evidence of regional myocardial ischemia. The time to onset of ST-segment changes in the saline control group was 99 +/- 34 min and was followed by the appearance of premature ventricular complexes (111 +/- 34 min) and subsequent ventricular tachycardia (131 +/- 37 min) which terminated in ventricular fibrillation in each of the 10 dogs. Animals treated with UM-272 likewise developed ST-segment changes (156 +/- 28 min) and premature ventricular complexes (168 +/- 29 min), but 4 of 10 animals failed to develop ventricular fibrillation (P less than 0.05 vs. saline). These results demonstrate that UM-272, the dimethyl quaternary analog of propranolol, is effective in reducing the incidence of ventricular fibrillation in a conscious canine model in which the superimposition of a transient ischemic event upon an already jeopardized heart leads to the development of sudden death.", 
    "33": "A case of a nonfatal acebutolol intoxication in a 15 year old female is described. Ingestion of 7600 mg acebutolol resulted in a plasma acebutolol concentration of 15 mg/1 one hour after ingestion. The patient remained conscious, had a severe hypotension and the electrocardiogram showed a 1st degree AV-block and severe intraventricular conduction disturbances at a rate of 70 bpm. After the administration of calcium gluconate and plasma the blood pressure gradually increased to normal values in 2 hours time. Plasma halflife of acebutolol was 8 hours. Pathophysiology of acebutolol intoxication is discussed.", 
    "34": "The present study was designed to investigate the mechanisms of smooth muscle relaxant effects of propranolol. The relaxant effects of the drug on potassium (K+)-contracture or lanthanum (La3+)-contracture were studied using smooth muscle preparations of dog coronary artery and colon in comparison with those of nitroglycerin, nifedipine and papaverine. Nitroglycerin relaxed the coronary artery preparations under K+-contracture as well as La3+-contracture, but did not relax the colon preparations under K+- and La3+-contracture. Papaverine relaxed both types of smooth muscles under K+- and La3+-contracture. Nifedipine relaxed the coronary artery and the colon preparations under K+-contracture, but did not relax them under La3+-contracture. Propranolol produced the same relaxant effects on both preparations as nifedipine. Furthermore, propranolol concentration-dependently inhibited the calcium-induced contractions of the coronary arterial preparations. The results suggest that propranolol, like nifedipine, may have a calcium antagonistic action in the cell membrane of smooth muscles.", 
    "35": "The aim of this double-blind crossover study was to compare the prophylactic effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) with that of propranolol (PRP) in the treatment of migraine. Plasma concentrations of the two drugs were measured in order to investigate a possible relationship to the clinical effect. Compared to the pretreatment period, PRP and ASA reduced migraine index, frequency, duration, severity of attacks and headache days. Due to the limited number of patients, our results should be cautiously interpreted, however relevant the clinical improvement seemed. Improvement of migraine index was not related to different plasma levels of the two drugs.", 
    "36": "The interaction of chlorpromazine, DL-propranolol, and imipramine with isolated alpha 1-acid glycoprotein is characterized by relatively high association constants and only one binding site per protein molecule. The mutual displacement between the three drugs indicates that all three compounds are bound to the same binding site. Several other basic drugs from different pharmacological and chemical classes also displace chlorpromazine, DL-propranolol, and imipramine with potencies, one would predict from their association constants or from the degree of their plasma binding in humans. It is concluded that displacement phenomena like those observed in this study in vitro are likely to occur also in vivo.", 
    "37": "Ten patients with chronic intermittent claudication were included in a double-blind, randomized cross-over study of placebo, propranolol 80 mg b.i.d. and metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d., each given for two months. At the end of each treatment period, the patients were tested on a treadmill and the time to first claudication pain and to intolerable claudication pain was noted. There was no decrease in time to first claudication pain or to intolerable pain with either propranolol or metoprolol as compared to placebo.", 
    "38": "A method is described for the measurement of the rate of the triacylglycerol/fatty-acid cycle in adipose tissue of the mouse in vivo, which depends upon the incorporation of tritium from [3H]H2O into the glycerol and fatty-acid moieties of triacylglycerol. The rate of the cycling is increased two-fold by feeding, an effect that is completely abolished by the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. The beta-adrenergic agonist fenoterol increased the rate of cycling five-fold in white adipose tissue and three-fold in brown adipose tissue. Cold exposure had no effect on the rate of cycling in white adipose tissue but increased the rate almost two-fold in brown adipose tissue. The increased rate of cycling during feeding, which may be due to increased sympathetic nervous activity, is consistent with the view tha the role of cycling is to increase sensitivity of metabolic control systems when required.", 
    "39": "A new direct, simple, and sensitive spectrofluorometric method is described for the assay of pindolol and its tablets at room temperature, using ethanol (96% v/v) as solvent. The drug exhibits intrinsic fluorescence. Working wavelengths are 263 nm for excitation and 305 nm for emission. The calibration curve is linear in the range 1.0 X 10(-7) to 1.5 X 10(-6)M pindolol.", 
    "40": "We evaluated the effects of oral metoprolol, 200 mg daily, on cardiac and pulmonary function in 6 patients with chronic reversible airways obstruction and no cardiac dysfunction. The patients were clinically stable. In all patients, baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was less than 60% predicted, and increased at least 15% after isoproterenol inhalation. Resting control first pass right and left ventricular radionuclide ejection fractions were normal or only slightly depressed. Compared to placebo, metoprolol did not significantly affect FEV1 or forced vital capacity. Metoprolol did not significantly alter left or right ventricular ejection fraction, measured by first pass radionuclide technique. On patient experienced increased dyspnea on metoprolol, which was not accompanied by changes in clinical exam, spirometry, or ejection fraction. We conclude that metoprolol may be safely administered to a subset of stable patients with chronic reactive airways disease.", 
    "41": "In six healthy subjects a 250 g steak significantly increased the systemic clearance of indocyanine green. During a steady-state infusion of propranolol there was a rapid decrease (mean 35%) in blood propranolol concentrations within 5 min of feeding and levels were reduced for 30 min before gradually returning towards the pre-feeding. These results suggest that the systemic clearance of high extraction drugs may be increased immediately following food.", 
    "42": "To investigate the possible protective effect of Ca2+ blockers in ischemic acute renal failure (ARF), verapamil, in a dose of 10 micrograms/kg body wt/min was administered for 100 min, starting 15 min before the total occlusion of the left renal artery after right nephrectomy in rats. Mean 24-hr creatinine clearance, blood urea, and serum creatinine levels, 24 hr after declamping, were used as a measure of kidney function. These values which were 135 +/- 1.9 microliter/min, 231 +/- 22 mg%, and 2.25 +/- 0.22 mg%, respectively, in the untreated rats, were found to be significantly different, i.e., 326.3 +/- 33.2 microliter/min, P less than 0.001, 112 +/- 25 mg%, P less than 0.001, and 1.26 +/- 0.28 mg%, P less than 0.01, respectively, in the verapamil-treated animals. Increased 24-hr total urine creatinine, sodium, osmolality, and a lower fractional excretion of sodium were also observed in the verapamil-treated rats with ARF. The combination of propranolol 1 mg/kg body wt/min and verapamil 10 micrograms/kg body wt/min for 100 min had no additive effect on renal function. In another group of ARF rats in which verapamil was started after declamping, no alleviating effect was observed. It is concluded that verapamil, an inhibitor of cellular membrane transport, when given prior to the renal ischemia, offers a partial but significant protection in this model of ischemic ARF.", 
    "43": "The fast component of the ventilatory changes that occur at the transition phases of exercise was studied in awake dogs trained to run on a treadmill. Two questions were examined: firstly, is the fast ventilatory component modified by changes in venous return to the lungs, such as those consecutive either to increased work loads or to beta adrenergic blockade?, and secondly, is this component altered by central ventilatory depressants? The results showed that at the onset of exercise, there is no correlation between the instantaneous increment in ventilation and the intensity of exercise, but at the end of the treadmill run, the fall in ventilation is closely linked to the power of the work performed. Ventilatory transients observed either at the start or at the end of exercise remain unaffected by administration of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. But central depressant effects on ventilation caused by narcotic analgesics or hypnotic drugs altered the breathing pattern of the fast component of exercise-induced ventilatory changes. It is concluded that the instantaneous changes in ventilation occurring at the transition phases of exercise are controlled by mechanoreceptor mechanisms, but cerebral control is superimposed on the reflex control in regulating both tidal volume and breathing rate.", 
    "44": "The cardiovascular instability in some cases of severe tetanus is due to increased circulating catecholamines. In 15 patients with this complication of tetanus, labetalol, a drug with alpha- and beta-peripheral adrenergic blocking properties, was used in management. The drug was administered orally, by i.v. bolus or by continuous infusion. Wide variation in dosage was needed both from case to case and in the same patient during the course of his disease. In most cases the pulse and blood pressure were reduced by labetalol, although their variability was not much improved. The effect on the cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance ranged from modest reduction in both, to marked effect on cardiac output without any change in systemic vascular resistance. The alpha-adrenergic blockage of labetalol is known to be less powerful than the beta-blocking effect, and this property could be a disadvantage in the management of sympathetic overactivity in tetanus.", 
    "45": "A sub-population of beagles with abnormal behavioral patterns has been identified, isolated and tested for responsively to selected classes of psychoactive drugs. The abnormal behavior was ameliorated by anxiolytics and antidepressants but not by antipsychotics, an antihistaminic, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, a beta-adrenergic blocker, or an anticholinergic drug. Improvement occurred after a single dose of the anxiolytic drugs but did not occur until 10-18 days after daily dosing with standard tricylic antidepressants and the MAO inhibitor isocarboxazid. This delayed onset in beagles resembles that seen on use of these drugs in humans. The results with these drugs suggest that the abnormal behaviors of the beagles are related to anxiety and are in part depressive in nature. This colony provides an animal model of abnormal behavior which allows evaluation of the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of drugs and estimates of the onset of action of antidepressant drugs.", 
    "46": "The laryngeal chemoreflex and the trigeminal diving reflex were studied in unanesthetized newborn lambs. Water stimulation of the laryngeal chemoreflex resulted in apnea, bradycardia, hypertension, and blood flow redistribution in the dive pattern. This response was significantly reduced after treatment with beta-adrenergic agonists, e.g., terbutaline. The response to laryngeal saline stimulation was not significantly altered by beta-adrenergic agonists. A similar response to trigeminal dive reflex stimulation elicited through cooling of the snout was also significantly reduced by terbutaline. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, reversed the terbutaline-induced effect on the laryngeal chemoreflex response. Stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve resulted in a reflex response comparable to that from laryngeal water stimulation. The reflex response was also attenuated by terbutaline, which indicates that the action of terbutaline is not on the laryngeal chemoreceptors. A possible direct effect from beta-adrenergic agonists on the respiratory center is suggested by a latency of 15-30 min before the reflex response was reduced after intravenous but not intrathecal administration. An effect of terbutaline via the arterial chemoreceptors is also possible.", 
    "47": "The effect of 5 mg pindolol on stress-induced disturbances of performance were assessed in 30 professional musicians. An overall inverse relationship was found between anxiety and musical performance. Reduction in anxiety by administration of pindolol was associated with a subjective improvement in performance. A stress-related tachycardia and increase in systolic blood pressure were attenuated. Pindolol had no effect on peak flow measurements.", 
    "48": "The outflow system was studied by light microscopy in nine human eyes that were treated with topical timolol maleate (0.5%) prior to enucleation for malignant melanoma of the choroid. The frequency of \"giant vacuoles\" in the lining endothelium of Schlemm's canal and the diameter of these structures was the same in a control group of eyes as in the timolol-treated series. There was no qualitative difference between the architecture of the meshwork in the control and treated groups. These morphologic findings suggested that timolol had no direct action on the outflow apparatus and did not reflect the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect of the drug. The effects of anesthesia, surgical manipulations, and fixation by immersion may have masked any subtle drug effects.", 
    "49": "The antiarrhythmic effects of the calcium blocker verapamil and the beta adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol were examined in aminophylline toxic dogs. Eighteen dogs were intubated and ventilated after induction of anaesthesia (pentobarbitone 30 mg/kg and paccuronium 0.1 mg/kg). All animals were rendered toxic by aminophylline infusion; an initial dose of 50 mg/kg over five minutes with subsequent doses of 10 mg/kg over 30 seconds. Twenty minutes after each aminophylline infusion, the dog was challenged with phenylephrine (10 to 20 micrograms/kg). This resulted in short duration hypertension and reproducible emergence of ventricular arrhythmias. The dogs were divided into three groups of six animals each. Group I (control) received no antiarrhythmics whereas Group II received verapamil 0.2 mg/kg and Group III received propranolol 0.1 mg/kg for the treatment of persistent ventricular arrhythmias. Both verapamil and propranolol exerted an antiarrhythmic effect in aminophylline induced ventricular arrhythmias. The efficacy of verapamil was independent of the accompanying reduction in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance as subsequent phenylephrine induced hypertension could not reinstitute these arrhythmias. Propranolol appeared less effective since it did not completely suppress the arrhythmias in three dogs and could not prevent emergence of PVC's in four following repeat phenylephrine challenge. Further development of this animal model may be useful for the better understanding of ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "50": "The steady-state concentration of adenosine in pericardial superfusates, [Ado]SS, may estimate the concentration in the cardiac interstitium. As reaching a steady state may sometimes require many minutes, the concentration at an earlier time is often used as an index of [Ado]SS. The latter assumes that the rate of approach to [Ado]SS is uniform and insensitive to perturbations of cardiac oxygen usage (MVO2). In 11 open-chest dogs superfusate adenosine rose at a rate (+/- SD) of 0.53 +/- 0.99/min to an [Ado]SS of 68 +/- 32. The mean rate of equilibration has a very large coefficient of variation, indicating substantial dog-to-dog variation. In five dogs the rate of equilibration during the second of successive superfusions was significantly lower than the first. Raising MVO2 by cardiac pacing or isoproterenol infusion changed neither the rate of equilibration nor [Ado]SS. Aortic constriction or propranolol slowed equilibration but had no effect on [Ado]SS. Thus superfusate adenosine concentration early in the course of equilibration seems an unreliable index of [Ado]SS. That interventions that change MVO2 do not change [Ado]SS from control means either that [Ado]SS fails to reflect the concentration in the vicinity of the coronary resistance vessels or, alternatively, that adenosine does not regulate coronary blood flow.", 
    "51": "The cardiovascular effects of prenylamine (P), verapamil (V), and nifedipine (N) were studied in open-chest, anesthetized dogs and in isolated, isovolumic dog hearts perfused at constant coronary blood flow (CBF). These drugs significantly decreased left ventricular pressure (LVP) and its maximal rates of rise (+P) and fall (-P). The tension developed by an isometric segment of the left ventricle and its maximal rates of rise (+T) and fall (-T) also decreased, whereas heart rate (HR) did not show statistically significant differences. Maximal rates of fall (-P and -T) were proportionally more depressed than maximal rates of rise (+P and +T), producing significant increments in the ratios between both maximal velocities (+P/-P and +T/-T). The time constant of LVP isovolumic decay tau was significantly prolonged, either in the whole animal or in isolated perfused hearts. The afterload reduction produced by the compounds can account in part for the increase in +P/-P but not for the increase in +T/-T or for the prolongation of tau. These relaxation indices remained unchanged after comparable myocardial depressions elicited by d,l-propranolol or pentobarbital sodium. It is concluded that calcium antagonist compounds are characterized by an \"antirelaxant\" effect, not explained by changes in HR, CBF, or loading conditions, and independent from their negative inotropic action.", 
    "52": "Exercise-induced increases in radionuclide-determined pulmonary blood volume (PBV) and thallium lung uptake have been described in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and have been shown to correlate with transient exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction. To compare these 2 techniques in the same patients, 74 patients (59 with and 15 without significant CAD) underwent supine bicycle exercise twice on the same day--first for thallium myocardial and lung imaging and then for technetium-99m gated blood pool imaging for the PBV ratio determination. Thallium activity of lung and myocardium was determined to calculate thallium lung/heart ratio. Relative changes in PBV from rest to exercise were expressed as a ratio of pulmonary counts (exercise/rest). Previously reported normal ranges for thallium lung/heart ratio and PBV ratio were used. The PBV ratio and thallium lung/heart ratio were abnormal in 71 and 36%, respectively, of patients with CAD (p less than 0.01). Both ratios were normal in all patients without CAD. Although the resting ejection fractions did not differ significantly in patients with normal versus those with abnormal PBV ratios or thallium lung/heart ratios, abnormal PBV ratios and thallium lung/heart ratios were associated with an exercise-induced decrease in ejection fraction. Propranolol use was significantly higher in patients with abnormal than in those with normal thallium lung/heart ratios (p less than 0.01). No significant difference in propranolol use was present in patients with abnormal or normal PBV ratios.", 
    "53": "(1) the prevalence of an abnormal thallium lung/heart ratio is less than that of the PBV ratio in patients with CAD; (2) both tests are normal in normal control subjects; (3) propranolol does not cause abnormal results in normal control subjects; however, propranolol may influence lung thallium uptake in patients with CAD; and (4) when both tests are abnormal, there is a high likelihood of multivessel disease.", 
    "54": "Drug effects were examined on cumulative norepinephrine (NE) concentration-response curves in ring segments of right extrapulmonary artery, intrapulmonary artery (IPA) and intrapulmonary vein (IPV) isolated from rabbit lung. Phentolamine (0.1 and 1.0 microM) caused concentration-dependent nonparallel rightward shifts in NE concentration-response curves and decreased maximal tension development in IPA by as much as 84%. Propranolol (3 microM) significantly increased the maximal developed tension to NE in IPA and IPV by 49 and 27%, respectively, and also abolished the relaxation response to higher (10(-6) to 10(-4) M) concentrations of NE observed in control experiments. These data suggested that responses of pulmonary vessels to NE, in particular IPA and IPV, consisted of an initial contractile response (alpha adrenergic receptor mediated) followed by beta adrenergic receptor-mediated relaxation which functionally opposed the contractile response to NE. Contractile response to high concentrations of NE (greater than 10(-4) M) were unaffected. Inhibition of neuronal uptake of NE by cocaine (10 microM) significantly potentiated NE contractile response in right extrapulmonary artery, IPA and IPV. Inhibition of extraneuronal uptake of NE by hydrocortisone (30 microM) or monoamine oxidase inhibition by harmaline (1 microM) did not alter contractile response to NE. Although the catechol-O-methyl-transferase inhibitor U-0521 (100 microM) also failed to potentiate NE contractile effects, this drug significantly decreased the initial contractile response to low concentrations of NE and greatly attenuated contractile responses to high concentrations of NE (greater than 10(-4) M) in IPA and IPV. These results indicate that rabbit intrapulmonary vessels show enhanced beta adrenergic receptor-mediated effects when compared with extrapulmonary vessels.", 
    "55": "Adenylate cyclase in microvessels isolated from rat cerebral cortex was stimulated by guanine nucleotides, catecholamines, prostaglandin E1, prostaglandin E2, and 2-chloroadenosine. Catecholamine stimulation was mediated by interaction with beta-adrenergic receptors. The order of relative potency was: isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. Activation of microvessel adenylate cyclase by prostaglandins E1 and E2 as well as by 2-chloroadenosine was dose related. Twenty-two peptides were tested for possible effects on the microvessel adenylate cyclase. Only vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) was stimulatory. No inhibitory action was observed. Activation by VIP required guanosine triphosphate and was dose dependent from 10 nM to 1 microM (ED50 = 0.1 microM). At 30 degrees C, stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the peptide increased linearly with time for up to 15 min. The effect of VIP was not inhibited by phentolamine or propranolol, suggesting that its action was not elicited by interaction with alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors. Activation achieved by VIP and isoproterenol, prostaglandin E1, or 2-chloroadenosine was the sum of the individual stimulations, suggesting that receptors for VIP were distinct from those for isoproterenol, prostaglandin E1, and 2-chloroadenosine.", 
    "56": "Atenolol kinetics were investigated in six healthy subjects after 100 mg orally, as monotherapy a 6-day treatment began 48 hr later. After a therapy-free interval of 4 wk, the same subjects received the same dose of atenolol with 1 gm ampicillin, 500 mg aspirin, and with 300 mg allopurinol. Allopurinol and aspirin did not substantially alter the kinetics of atenolol. After a single oral dose of 100 mg atenolol combined with 1 gm ampicillin, the bioavailability of atenolol was reduced to 36 +/- 5% compared to 60 +/- 8% after monotherapy. During long-term treatment with atenolol and ampicillin the bioavailability of atenolol fell to 24% (P less than 0.01). Mean peak plasma levels were lowered from 511 +/- 59 ng/ml on monotherapy to 344 +/- 33 ng/ml after the combination with ampicillin. The area under the plasma level-time curve, mean steady-state concentration, and urinary recovery were reduced, also. Twelve hours after 100 mg atenolol and 1 gm ampicillin, exercise tachycardia was significantly higher than after atenolol alone. During the 4-wk treatment in six hypertensive patients blood pressure levels of those on atenolol alone were not different from those on the combination therapy with ampicillin.", 
    "57": "In chronically instrumented, conscious dogs, rapid injection of equihypotensive doses of three calcium channel-blocking agents, verapamil (250 micrograms/kg), diltiazem (200 micrograms/kg) and nifedipine (50 micrograms/kg), produced disparate chronotropic and inotropic responses. Although they all decreased mean arterial pressure by about 10%, heart rate (93 +/- 4 beats/min) was markedly increased to 175 +/- 12 with nifedipine, to 163 +/- 15 with verapamil, and only slightly increased to 118 +/- 7 with diltiazem. Contractile responses measured before (left ventricular dP/dtmax, 2749 +/- 131 mm Hg/sec) and during left ventricular ejection (endocardial dimension dD/dtmax, 57 +/- 4 mm/sec) were increased by 24% and 14% with nifedipine, decreased by 26% and 22% with verapamil, and were unchanged with diltiazem. These chronotropic and inotropic responses to rapid intravenous administration of the three drugs were increased in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results also were observed after slow infusion of these drugs. To determine the extent to which autonomic reflexes participated in these cardiac responses, propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) or propranolol plus atropine (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) was administered prior to injection of each calcium channel-blocking agent. Propranolol abolished the positive inotropic response to nifedipine and potentiated the negative inotropic response to verapamil. Positive chronotropic responses to verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem were attenuated by propranolol plus atropine. These results suggest that equihypotensive doses of the three prominent calcium channel-blocking agents exert different degrees of autonomic reflex activation in awake, unsedated dogs. These reflexes, which modulate the direct effects of calcium channel-blocking agents on chronotropic and inotropic variables of the heart, may have important clinical implications.", 
    "58": "The hemodynamic, hormonal and electrolyte effects of prenalterol, a synthetic selective beta 1 agonist, were studied in six patients with New York Heart Association functional class II and III heart failure. Prenalterol was infused incrementally at 60, 120 and 240 nmol/min, each rate for 24 hours, producing steady-state plasma prenalterol levels of 52 +/- 3, 121 +/- 6 and 194 +/- 9 nmol/1, respectively (mean +/- SEM). Hemodynamic and hormonal measurements were performed before, during and after prenalterol administration under conditions of constant body posture and a regulated intake of dietary sodium and potassium. Prenalterol induced a statistically significant increase in cardiac index (from 2.6 +/- 0.2 to 3.1 +/- 0.3 1/min/m2), with parallel increases in stroke index (from 28 +/- 2 to 34 +/- 2 ml/beat/m2). Forearm blood flow measurements increased (from 2.9 +/- 0.5 to 4.1 +/- 0.6 ml/min/100 g), while calculated systemic vascular resistance fell, as did pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (from 13.7 +/- 1.6 to 10.5 +/- 1.7 mm Hg). The drug did not alter heart rate, arterial pressure, right heart pressures or the frequency of ventricular premature beats. Prenalterol increased plasma renin activity (from 2.9 +/- 0.8 to 6.6 +/- 1.8 nmol/1/hour), angiotensin II (from 59 +/- 12 to 89 +/- 22 pmol/1), urinary aldosterone excretion (from 41 +/- 10 to 78 +/- 34 nmol/day) and plasma insulin (from 10.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.8 +/- 3.9 mU/1). Circulating catecholamines, cortisol, glucose, glucagon or pancreatic polypeptide did not change. Dose-response studies in five patients showed dose-dependent increments in hemodynamic variables, while hormonal changes plateaued at the second dose level. We conclude that prenalterol infusion augments myocardial contractility, reduces systemic vascular resistance, and stimulates insulin release and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "59": "The contractility of the right atrium, a heart region known to be unaffected by ischemia, was studied in rats with experimental left ventricular infarction. The study of the isolated atrium established reduced right-atrial myocardial tensility, depressed Starling's curve and, as a result, a two-fold decrease in maximum systolic tension within 24 hours after the coronary occlusion. The resistance of atrial myocardium to hypoxia and calcium excess was also diminished. This set of changes could be reproduced completely in the absence of myocardial infarction through emotional-painful stress, on one hand, and it could be to a great extent prevented by a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol, on the other hand, i.e. a stress-related origin is postulated.", 
    "60": "High fidelity measurements of left ventricular pressure were made at increasing pacing rates in 21 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a control group of 11 patients investigated for chest pain who proved to have normal hearts. In both groups the fall in pressure during isovolumic relaxation from the point of min dp/dt approximated closely to a monoexponential, and could be described by a time constant and asymptote. The time constant shortened and the asymptote increased as heart rate rose in both groups. The time constant was longer and min dp/dt less in the cardiomyopathy group than controls at all heart rates. In the cardiomyopathy patients min dp/dt, but not the time constant, was related to systolic pressure. During pacing, eight cardiomyopathy patients developed metabolic evidence of myocardial ischaemia, but indices of relaxation did not differ between these eight and the other 13 either at basal heart rate or the highest pacing rate. In 10 cardiomyopathy patients measurements were repeated at comparable pacing rates after propranolol (0.2 mg/kg). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and indices of contractility decreased after the drug, but the time constant did not change. Eight patients received verapamil (20 mg) after which there were substantial reductions in systolic pressure and contractility. Min dp/dt decreased in proportion to systolic pressure, but the time constant was unchanged. At the highest pacing rate before drug administration three patients had abnormal lactate extraction which was corrected by either propranolol (one patient) or verapamil (two patients). Despite abolition of metabolic evidence of ischaemia, relaxation did not improve. It is concluded that abnormal isovolumic relaxation is common in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but its severity correlates poorly with other features of the disease. Abnormal relaxation is not the result of ischaemia, and pressure derived indices of relaxation do not improve after the administration of propranolol or verapamil.", 
    "61": "This report focuses on recent applications of capillary column GLC to the analysis of drugs and metabolites, other xenobiotics, natural products, and environmental contaminants in samples of biological origin. The increasing use of selected ion monitoring, combined with stable isotope methods as a means of GLC detection and quantification, is emphasized. Specific topics covered include the use of capillary column GLC for 1) determining the pharmacokinetics of timolol (BLOCADREN) in human volunteers by simultaneous oral and intravenous administration of this beta-blocker and its 13C3-labeled analog; 2) measuring residue levels of the forced molting agent, xylonidine, in yolk and albumen of chicken eggs; 3) monitoring animal plasma and tissues for the depletion of 5-hydroxy-1,3-dioxane and 4-hydroxymethyl-1,3-dioxolane (isomeric components of glycerol formal, an animal drug formulation component); 4) detecting 13C, 15N-methyltryptamine (a biosynthesis product from 13C, 15N-tryptamine) in human urine; and 5) measuring estradiol levels in biological samples.", 
    "62": "A 48-year-old woman with a known history of hypothyroidism was admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of thyroid storm secondary to acute thyroid hormone poisoning and the possible hyperfunction of a singular thyroid nodule. Her clinical manifestations included pyrexia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, RUQ abdominal pain, psychotic behavior, and pharyngitis. She was successfully treated with sodium iodide, PTU, propranolol, antibiotics, and a hypothermia mattress, with her serum T4 level returning to normal range prior to discharge. The patient was discharged 9 days after admission in good medical health with no medication. This article clearly shows that the functions of the endocrine system remain a frontier in today's medicine. With research, perhaps one day we might fully understand the intricate pathophysiology that results in thyroid storm. The potential problem format has been utilized in the development of the nursing care plan to assist the nurse with identifying and defining her patient's problems, as well as directing her assessment and nursing intervention. As more is learned about thyroid storm, nurses should update their knowledge so that they will be prepared to care for the patient with these difficult nursing problems.", 
    "63": "The activity of ornithine decarboxylase was monitored in situ by perfusing rat heart with (1-14COOH)-ornithine. Infusion of isoproterenol or noradrenaline caused after 15-20 min an activation of the ornithine decarboxylation 5 fold above control hearts; less evident was the effect of adrenaline. Isoproterenol induced ornithine decarboxylation was prevented by difluoromethyl-ornithine. Also propranolol produced a significative reduction of the flux of 14CO2 collected from the perfusate. The measurement of the ornithine decarboxylase activity in heart homogenates by confirming the above results, indicated that the in situ monitor of ornithine decarboxylation can represent an accurate method which reveals rapid activation of the enzyme.", 
    "64": "A double-blind, cross-over study was performed in 23 consecutive patients with unstable angina at rest in order to compare the efficacy of verapamil (480 mg/day) and propranolol (240 mg/day) in reducing the number of anginal crises and nitroglycerin (NTG) consumption. Twenty patients, 15 men and five women, mean age 59.7 (range 45-68) years completed the study. The mean daily number of attacks was 3.1 in the two-day run-in period and 2.9 in a subsequent two-day placebo period immediately preceding the treatment periods. Propranolol reduced the number of attacks to 1.6 (P less than 0.01 compared to the run-in and placebo periods). Verapamil reduced the crises to 0.2/day (P less than 0.01 compared to the run-in placebo and propranolol periods). The NTG consumption behaved in a similar way. Adverse reactions to verapamil were observed in two patients. Although there are objective difficulties in performing correct trials in these kinds of patients, the results of this study indicate the efficacy of verapamil in preventing anginal pains during the \"warm phase' of the unstable form and stress the superiority of this calcium antagonist when compared to propranolol.", 
    "65": "It is established that in the majority of patients at the height of left ventricular insufficiency (LVI) low cardiac output is not recorded, it is within the normal limits and at times even higher than normal. In isolated LVI present only with pulmonary hypertension, despite the absence of insufficiency of the right heart considerable disorders of peripheral haemodynamics are present in the shape of decreased volume of tissue blood flow, venous capacity and extensibility of the peripheral veins. The degree of this decrease is proportional to the severity of LVI and upset of the pulmonary circulation. The more persistent and considerable effect correcting decreased capacity and extensibility of the peripheral veins and enhancing the perfusion of tissues with isolated LVI is exerted by furosemide, nitroglycerine is somewhat less effective. Strophanthin exerts such effect in roughly 50% of cases, and obsidan is unreliable in its effect."
