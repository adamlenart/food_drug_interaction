The computerized measure for T-wave morphology (morphology combination score, MCS) was based on asymmetry, flatness and notching, which are typical ECG patterns in LQT2. Blinded to labels, the new morphology measures were tested in a third group of 39 healthy subjects receiving sotalol. Over 3 days the sotalol group received 0, 160 and 320 mg doses, respectively, and a 12-lead Holter ECG was recorded for 22.5 hours each day. Drug-induced prolongation of the heart rate corrected QT interval (QTcF) was compared with changes in the computerized measure for T-wave morphology.

At maximum serum-plasma concentrations and at maximum individual change from baseline, the effect sizes for QTcF were less than half the effect sizes for MCS, p < 0.001.

The development of postinfarction cardiosclerosis led to a reduction of the postextrasystolic potentiation and of potentiation induced by periods of rest. Preliminary blocking of beta(1)-adrenoreceptors stimulated the postextrasystolic contractions and contractions after periods of rest in the myocardium of rats with postinfarction cardiosclerosis. These results suggest that blocking of beta(1)-adrenoreceptors promotes an improvement of calcium-accumulating function of the cardiomyocyte sarcoplasmatic reticulum in the myocardium of rats with postinfarction cardiosclerosis.",

These changes persisted during blockade of muscarinic receptors, nicotinic receptors, alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, and beta(1)/beta(2) adrenoceptors. A stress-induced decrease in gastric motor activity was mediated by the nonadrenergic noncholinergic mechanism. It resulted from the influence of a hormonal stress factor on the stomach, which was probably realized through nonadrenergic inhibitory neurons of the enteric nervous system.", 
    "16": "Beta (beta) blockers are widely used for treatment of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, their mechanism of action is not fully understood and differs significantly among agents in this class. Chronic increases in adrenergic activity in heart failure result in desensitization of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor signal transduction and adverse effects on myocytes. By reducing heart rate and decreasing myocardial workload, the pathologic remodeling of the heart may be reversed with beta-blocking agents. Among beta-blockers, there are clear differences in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. Newer beta-blockers differ from older agents with respect to beta-adrenoceptor affinity and selectivity and partial agonist activity, which may affect their mechanism of action and be important in clinical use.The first beta-antagonist compounds were nonselective; the next generation of beta-blockers was selective for beta1-receptors. The most recent beta-blockers may be nonselective or selective, and they have the additional ancillary property of vasodilation. Nebivolol is among the newer third-generation beta-blockers. It is unique in the class, since apart from its cardioselectivity, it also produces nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation. As a result, its hemodynamic profile is clearly different from those of traditional beta-blockers. This review will evaluate this class of agents and the basis for their differences in clinical use.", 
    "17": "Changes in the retinal microcirculation are associated with hypertension and predict cardiovascular mortality. There are few data describing the impact of antihypertensive therapy on retinal vascular changes. This substudy of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial compared the effects of an amlodipine-based regimen (373 patients) with an atenolol-based regimen (347 patients) on retinal microvascular measurements made from fundus photographs. The retinal photographs were taken at a stage in the trial when treatments were stable and blood pressure was well controlled. Amlodipine-based treatment was associated with a smaller arteriolar length:diameter ratio than atenolol-based treatment (13.32 [10.75 to 16.04] versus 14.12 [11.27 to 17.81], median [interquartile range]; P<0.01). The association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index, smoking, and statin treatment. This effect appeared to be largely attributable to shorter retinal arteriolar segment lengths in the amlodipine-treated group and is best explained by the vasodilator effects of amlodipine causing the visible emergence of branching side vessels. Photographic assessment of the retinal vascular network may be a useful approach to evaluating microvascular structural responses in clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy.",

    "23": "Fractal frequency scaling of heart period variability is used as a concise index of overall cardiac control. However, no prior study has assessed within-individual reproducibility of fractal indices of heart period, or reported how the estimated indices respond to autonomic blockade. Therefore, we examined fractal properties of the heart period from ten young, healthy individuals during three separate experimental sessions under control (saline) conditions and twice under combined autonomic blockade (atenolol and atropine sulfate) conditions. Under each condition, R-R intervals were recorded with the subject in the supine and the 40 deg upright tilt positions during 20 min of controlled breathing in each position. We calculated the fractal scaling exponent using detrended fluctuation analysis and estimated confidence intervals of the scaling exponents for each R-R interval time series within each individual. In the control condition, upright tilt significantly increased the scaling exponents (from 0.73 +/- 0.11 (+/-S.D., session 1), 0.72 +/- 0.10 (session 2) and 0.75 +/- 0.13 (session 3) to 0.82 +/- 0.12, 0.82 +/- 0.11 and 0.84 +/- 0.10; Student's paired t-test, t = 2.79, P = 0.02; t = 2.80, P = 0.02; and t = 2.07, P = 0.07). However, neither the absolute scaling exponents nor their change in response to upright tilt were reproducible (Lin's concordance coefficient less than 0.9, P > 0.1 for all comparisons). Following autonomic blockade, the scaling exponents were significantly increased (supine: 1.08 +/- 0.13 and 1.08 +/- 0.14; tilt: 1.07 +/- 0.21 and 1.08 +/- 0.14) for both experimental sessions (two-way repeated-measures ANOVA; F(17,1) = 40.89, P < 0.001 and F(17,1) = 42.72, P < 0.001) regardless of position. However, within individuals, the scaling exponents failed to distinguish between control and blockade for half of the subjects in at least one experimental session. Thus, fractal scaling exponents are not reproducible within individuals and do not reliably reflect the autonomic mechanisms responsible for heart period variability. In fact, data from combined blockade suggest that physiological effects of autonomic outflow may mask intrinsic fractal behaviour of the sinoatrial node.",

The pharmacological modulation of autonomous nervous systems alters the effects of ley-enkephalin on cholesecretions. Opioid peptide in the presence of antagonists of alpha-adrenoreceptors stimulates the processes of bile acids conjugation, in the presence of antagonists of beta-adrenoreceptors it cancels the effects of ley-enkephalin. The antagonists M-holinoreceptors reverse the effects of ley-enkephalin for the opposite ones: the synthesis and transport of free bile asides and cholisterine are suppressed.",

After anesthesia induction with propofol (2-2.5 mg/kg), the mean arterial pressure was aimed to be between 50 mm Hg and 65 mm Hg for controlled hypotensive anesthesia in both groups. In group RP, a remifentanil infusion of 0.1-0.5 microg/kg/min was titrated, following a bolus of 1 microg/kg; for group RP-E, an esmolol infusion of 100-300 mg/kg/min was titrated, following a bolus of 500 microg/kg; to achieve a target blood pressure.

    "40": "To elucidate the involvement of the noradrenergic system in the regulation of spinal microglial activity, we examined the effects of noradrenaline (NA) on the phosphorylation of three MAP kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)) stimulated by ATP in rat cultured spinal microglia using Western blotting. ATP (100 microM) quickly induced the phosphorylation of three MAP kinases and MKK3/6, which are upstream kinases of p38. Under these conditions, NA inhibited only the ATP-stimulated phosphorylation of p38 in a time (30-60 min)- and dose (10-100 microM)-dependent manner, but did not affect those of ERK, JNK, or MKK3/6. The inhibitory action of NA was completely reversed by pretreatment with propranolol, an antagonist for beta-adrenoceptors, or both atenolol and ICI118551, selective antagonists for beta1 and beta2, respectively. Treatment with dibutyryl cAMP or the selective activator of PKA mimicked the inhibitory effect of NA. Furthermore, treatment with KT5720, an inhibitor of protein kinase A, completely blocked the action of NA. These data suggest that NA could control the activation of p38 through the beta1/2-adrenergic pathways, which include the production of cAMP and the activation of PKA. Simultaneously, we found that NA also markedly inhibited the ATP-induced increase in the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA through beta-adrenergic pathways. Furthermore, preincubation with either actinomycin D or cyclohexamide, general inhibitors of transcription or protein synthesis, respectively, almost completely blocked the inhibitory action of NA on the ATP-stimulated phosphorylation of p38. These results suggest that de novo synthesis of certain factors by NA through beta-adrenoceptors would participate in the modulation of p38 activity. Thus, the inhibitory system via beta1/2-adrenergic pathways in spinal microglia appears to have an important role in the modulation of microglial functions through the downregulation of p38 activity.", 
    "41": "The ICH S7A and S7B guidelines require that effects of test substances on the cardiovascular system be assessed with respect to blood pressure, heart rate and electrocardiogram intervals. Where adverse effects are identified additional supplemental studies, including ventricular contractility, should be conducted as deemed appropriate. However, there is an absence of definitive guidance regarding when to pursue supplementary studies, in part due to ill-defined criteria of what constitutes an adverse effect and to surgical/technical monitoring limitations of study designs. However with advances in technology it is now feasible to develop models for assessing LVP and contractility in conjunction with standard assessments. The objectives of this study were to 1) develop a model for chronic evaluation of LVP and contractility, 2) illustrate changes in LV contractility without concurrent proportional changes in heart rate and/or systemic blood pressure and 3) determine if the QA interval, the time between the Q on the ECG and the beginning of the upstroke on the arterial blood pressure, can be used as a indicator of altered LV contractility.",

Common issues encountered in this population are high defibrillation thresholds and inappropriate shocks. In order to resolve these problems, the addition of a class III antiarrhythmic such as sotalol is often considered. Given the emerging issue of polypharmacy and medication compliance in the heart failure population, the question of the efficacy of sotalol in reducing inappropriate shocks, defibrillation thresholds, and its ability to replace conventional beta-blockers is often raised. Current literature review suggests that sotalol is a useful adjunct to the contemporary heart failure regimen. It has the ability to reduce inappropriate shocks and defibrillation thresholds, but appears not to fully reproduce the pleiotropic beneficial effects of the beta-blockers more commonly employed for their mortality/remodeling benefits in heart failure patients.",

The main GP in the atrial fat pads or the ganglia along the ligament of Marshall (LOM) were then ablated. Ablation of the anterior right GP and inferior right GP significantly increased the AF threshold by HFS at the right atrium and PVs. The AF threshold at left atrium and PVs was significantly increased by ablation of the superior left GP and inferior left GP, and was further increased by ablation of the LOM. Ablation of left- or right-sided GP on the atria had a significant effect on contralateral PVs and atrium.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with clonidine and the dose-effect or time-effect relationship of clonidine on CGRP production was examined. Yohimbine (a alpha(2)-adrenoceptor blocker) and L-NAME (an antagonist of nitric oxide synthase, NOS) were chosen to explore the role of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor and nitric oxide pathway in the effect of clonidine on endothelial cell-derived CGRP production. The level of CGRP mRNA or protein was detected by Real Time-PCR or radioimmunoassay. Nitric oxide content was measured by nitroreduction assay. The study showed that clonidine was able to induce CGRP mRNA (alpha- and beta-isoforms) expression in a dose-dependent manner in endothelial cells. The effect of clonidine on endothelial cell-derived CGRP synthesis and secretion was attenuated in the presence of yohimbine. L-NAME treatment could also inhibit clonidine-induced CGRP synthesis and secretion concomitantly with the decreased NO content in culture medium. These results suggest that clonidine could stimulate CGRP synthesis and secretion in endothelial cells through the activation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor, which is related to the NO pathway.",

The aims of the ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) substudy of ASCOT were to examine the impact of the two blood pressure (BP)- lowering regimens on ambulatory pressures, test to what extent the between-treatment differences in cardiovascular outcome could be attributed to differences in ABP and assess whether ABP provides predictive information additional to that of clinic blood pressure (CBP) in treated hypertensive patients.",

As in the whole ASCOT population, CBP values were lower in amlodipine-perindopril-treated patients compared with those treated with atenolol-thiazide [between-regimen difference [95% confidence intervals (CIs)]]: [-1.5 (-2.4 to -0.5)/-1.2 (-1.8 to +0.5) mmHg]. Daytime BP during follow-up was higher in patients treated with amlodipine-perindopril therapy [+1.1 (0.1-2.1)/+1.6 (0.8-2.3) mmHg]; night-time systolic, but not diastolic BP, was lower in patients treated with amlodipine-perindopril therapy [-2.2 (-3.4 to +0.9)/+0.8 (0.0-1.6) mmHg]. The relative risk of a cardiovascular event associated with a 1 SD increment in accumulated mean BP was 1.35 (1.18-1.53) for clinic systolic BP, 1.30 (1.14-1.49) for daytime systolic BP and 1.42 (1.24-1.62) for night-time systolic BP. With adjustment for baseline variables, treatment regimen and clinic systolic BP, the hazard ratios were 1.17 (1.00-1.36) and 1.25 (1.08-1.47) for daytime and night-time systolic BP, respectively. The between-regimen adjusted hazard ratio for cardiovascular events (amlodipine-perindopril therapy versus atenolol-thiazide therapy) was 0.74 (0.55-1.01) and increased to 0.81 (0.60-1.10) after further adjustment for clinic systolic BP.

Both CBP and ABP were significantly associated with rates of cardiovascular events. ABP nocturnal pressures provided complimentary and incremental utility over CBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risk in treated hypertensive patients. These data support the use of ABP to assess the effect of antihypertensive treatment in clinical practice.", 
    "69": "Fish exposed to hypoxia develop decreased heart rate, or bradycardia, the physiological significance of which remains unknown. The general muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine abolishes the development of this hypoxic bradycardia, suggesting the involvement of muscarinic receptors. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the hypoxic bradycardia is mediated specifically by stimulation of the M(2) muscarinic receptor, the most abundant subtype in the vertebrate heart. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were reared at two levels of hypoxia (30 and 40 Torr PO(2)) from the point of fertilization. In hypoxic fish, the heart rate was significantly lower than in normoxic controls from 2 to 10 days postfertilization (dpf). At the more severe level of hypoxia (30 Torr PO(2)), there were significant increases in the relative mRNA expression of M(2) and the cardiac type beta-adrenergic receptors (beta1AR, beta2aAR, and beta2bAR) at 4 dpf. The hypoxic bradycardia was abolished (at 40 Torr PO(2)) or significantly attenuated (at 30 Torr PO(2)) in larvae experiencing M(2) receptor knockdown (using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides). Sham-injected larvae exhibited typical hypoxic bradycardia in both hypoxic regimens. The expression of beta1AR, beta2aAR, beta2bAR, and M(2) mRNA was altered at various stages between 1 and 4 dpf in larvae experiencing M(2) receptor knockdown. Interestingly, M(2) receptor knockdown revealed a cardioinhibitory role for the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor. This is the first study to demonstrate a specific role of the M(2) muscarinic receptor in the initiation of hypoxic bradycardia in fish.", 
    "70": "Pharmaceuticals in the environment (PIE) are of importance since these compounds are designed to affect biological receptors/enzymes that are often conserved across vertebrate families. Across-species extrapolation of these therapeutic targets suggests potential for impacting amphibia and fish in the aquatic environment. Due to the scarcity of relevant ecotoxicological data, the long-tem impact of PIE remains a research question. Efficient use of mammalian data has been proposed to better understand and predict the potential for a given pharmaceutical to impact the environment. Using a model cardiovascular pharmaceutical (propranolol, a non-specific beta(1)/beta(2)-adrenergic antagonist), the hypothesis that mammalian data can be used to predict toxicity in fish was tested. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum)) have beta-adrenergic signalling mechanisms analogous to human cardiovascular receptors that respond to pharmacological doses of agonists and antagonists. Trout absorbed propranolol from water such that after 40 days of exposure, the linear relationship was [plasma] - 0.59[water] (n - 31, r - 0.96). Growth rate was affected only at very high aqueous concentrations (10-day (growth)NOEC - 1.0 and (growth)LOEC - 10 mg/l). Growth recovered with time (40-day (growth)NOEC - 10 mg/l), suggesting possible adaptation to the pharmaceutical, although the internal plasma concentration in trout exposed to 10mg propranolol/l of water was higher than the mammalian therapeutic plasma concentration. Additional endpoints suggested subtle changes of liver and heart size at much lower concentrations may have occurred, although these were not concentration-related. There was, however, a dose-dependent effect upon overall body condition. The trout plasma concentrations at these effective aqueous concentrations fell within the range of mammalian effective plasma concentrations, supporting the potential for developing 'read-across' from mammalian pharmacology safety data to fish ecotoxicology. Despite these effects at relatively high concentrations, propranolol is not expected to pose a risk to fish at the concentrations considered to be present in the aquatic environment.", 
    "71": "The number of fixed associations to treat intraocular pressure has increased over the recent years, to improve patient's treatment adherence. They are generally considered as comparable to the same components administered separately with, in some cases, less side effects. It could thus be appealing to combine fixed associations to reduce these side effects and retain efficacy. However, almost all fixed associations contain timolol, a beta blocker, with a risk of an excessive beta blocking dose and related systemic adverse drug reactions. Several fixed-associations contain a prostaglandin analogue. Their combination would not have a superior efficacy to one fixed combination taken alone. Furthermore, an increased risk or incidence of adverse drug reactions would appear. Specific clinical studies are required before recommending their use in daily clinical practice.",

    "73": "The male gonad receives nerve fibres from the autonomic ganglionic system. These fibres converge on the testis along two pathways, the superior and the inferior spermatic nerves. The superior spermatic nerve runs from the superior mesenteric ganglion alongside the testicular artery, whereas the inferior spermatic nerve originates in inferior mesenteric ganglion, accompanies the vas deferens and penetrates the inferior pole of the testis. The aim of this work was to evaluate androgen release after the addition of noradrenaline or adrenoreceptor antagonists (propranolol or phentolamine) to the ganglionic compartment. An ex vivo system used in a previous work was incubated in two separate containers, one for the testis and the other for the ganglion. Both organs remain interconnected (as in vivo) by the respective spermatic nerve. When noradrenaline was added to the inferior mesenteric ganglion, testosterone release in the gonad container underwent a progressive and significant increment. Propranolol diminishes and phentolamine increases the androgen release. When using the superior mesenteric ganglion, no changes were observed. These results indicate that the ganglionic stimulation of the autonomic system clearly participates in testosterone release from the testis. This effect depends on the ganglion involved. These results make it evident that not only the classical and well-known hypothalamus-hypophysial axis, but also the peripheral nervous system, via the autonomic ganglia, are directly involved in the endocrine control of the testis.", 
    "74": "Site-directed mutagenesis guided by evolutionary trace analysis revealed that substitution of V179 and W183 within a cluster of evolutionarily important residues on the surface of the fourth transmembrane domain of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR) significantly reduced the propensity of the receptor to self-assemble into homodimers as assessed by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer in living cells. These results suggest that mutation of V179 and W183 result in conformational changes that reduce homodimerization either directly by interfering with the dimerization interface or indirectly by causing local misfolding that result in reduced self-assembly. However, the mutations did not cause a general misfolding of the beta(1)AR as they did not prevent heterodimerization with the beta(2)AR. The homodimerization-compromised mutants were significantly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and could not be properly matured and trafficked to the cell surface. Lipophilic beta-adrenergic ligands acted as pharmacological chaperones by restoring both dimerization and plasma membrane trafficking of the ER-retained dimerization-compromised beta(1)AR mutants. These results clearly indicate that homodimerization occurs early in the biosynthetic process in the ER and that pharmacological chaperones can promote both dimerization and cell surface targeting, most likely by stabilizing receptor conformations compatible with the two processes.",

    "76": "Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death in the world and is responsible for about 5 million deaths each year. Several trials have raised the possibility that blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may be beneficial in patients with stroke. The recently reported Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes (PRoFESS) study evaluated the effect of lowering blood pressure with the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), telmisartan, initiated early after stroke. A total of 80 patients (8.7%) in the telmisartan group and 934 patients (9.2%) in the placebo group had a subsequent stroke, a nonsignificant 5% relative risk reduction in the telmisartan group. Major cardiovascular events occurred in 1367 patients (13.5%) in the telmisartan group and in 1463 patients (14.4%) in the placebo group, a 6% nonsignificant relative risk reduction. The mean follow-up in the PRoFESS study was only 2.5 years, which was too short to assess the impact of treatment on atherosclerotic disease. Stroke prevention aimed at the atherosclerotic process has repercussions on the entire cardiovascular system. The Kaplan-Meier curve of the incidence of major cardiovascular events in PRoFESS has a striking similarity with the Kaplan-Meier curves of Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE), EURopean trial On reduction of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) and Telmisartan Randomised AssessmeNt Study in ACE iNtolerant subjects with cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND) trials for a similar endpoint. It is highly probable that with a longer follow-up, the difference between telmisartan-treated and placebo-treated patients would become significant. In 2008, patients with cardiovascular disease are considerably better treated than 10 years ago. By omitting one class of drugs from the cocktail used for prevention in these high-risk patients (statins, beta-blockers, antiplatelet drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or ARBs), part of the benefit obtained by the complete treatment will be lost. PRoFESS seems to be a negative trial at first sight, but if considered together with the available data from other clinical trials, it clearly shows that it would be a mistake to withhold drugs that counteract the effect of angiotensin II in patients with stroke or other atherosclerotic disease.", 
    "77": "Experiments with rats showed that ionophoretic delivery of alpha1-adrenoblocker into the skin does not change effects of superficial and deep cooling and did not affect the amount of the antibody producing cells in spleen and a blood level of circulating antibodies under thermoneutral conditions. Meanwhile alpha1-adrenoblocker abolished inhibitory effect of fast deep cooling on antigen-binding properties of spleen cells and peritoneal extraction cells, and markedly stimulated it. beta-Adrenoblocker had no effect on immunogenesis under thermoneutral conditions and changes modulating effect of cooling on immune response. It abolished immunosuppressive effect of deep cooling and enhanced the stimulating effect of superficial cooling. It was true both for antigen-binding processes in spleen and peritoneal cavity and for antibody production in spleen. The results obtained indicate an involvement of alpha1--and beta-adrenoreceptors in immune response inhibition after deep cooling. Adrenoblockers effects on various immune competent cells are ambiguous and depend on temperature.",

Bisoprolol and metoprolol affected heart rate and heart rate variability in less extent, and nebivolol normalized a part of heart rate variability parameters.",

    "92": "The overall purpose of hypertension treatment is 2-fold. First, patients often have symptoms that are related to their high blood pressure and although subtle in many instances may be improved dramatically by blood pressure control. The main reason for blood pressure treatment, however, is to reduce the burden of cardiovascular complications and end organ damage related to the condition. This may be considered the ultimate goal of blood pressure treatment. In this respect, actual blood pressure measurements may be seen as surrogate end points as the organ protective effects of two antihypertensive agents may differ significantly even though their blood pressure lowering effects are similar. Thus beta-blockers, once seen as first-line treatment of hypertension for most patients, now are considered as third- or fourthline agents according to the latest NICE guidelines (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, www.nice.org.uk/CG034). On the other hand, agents that inhibit the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) system are being established as safe, effective and end organ protective in numerous clinical trials, resulting in their general acceptance as first-line treatment in most patients with stage 2 hypertension. This shift in emphasis from beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics is supported by numerous clinical trials and has proven safe and well tolerated by patients. The impact of this paradigm shift will have to be established in future long-term randomized clinical trials. The optimal combination treatment with respect to end organ protection has yet to be determined. Most combinations will include either a RAAS active agent and calcium channel blocker or two separate RAAS active agents working at different levels of the cascade. In this respect direct renin inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers seem particularly promising but the concept awaits evaluation in upcoming randomized clinical trials. Although safety data from the randomized clinical trials to date have been promising, we still lack data on the long-term effect of aliskiren on mortality and there still are patient groups where the safety of aliskiren is unexplored.",

Reperfusion injury after myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with inflammation lasting 24-48 h that contributes to ongoing myocyte injury. We previously showed that an ATL-146e infusion, starting just before reperfusion, decreased inflammation and infarct size in dogs examined 2 h after MI without increasing coronary blood flow. In the present study, adult dogs underwent 90 min of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Thirty minutes before reperfusion, ATL-146e (0.01 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1); n = 21) or vehicle (n = 12) was intravenously infused and continued for 2.5 h (protocol 1) or 24 h (protocol 2). At 48 h after reperfusion hearts were excised and assessed for histological risk area and infarct size. Infarct size based on triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining as a percentage of risk area was significantly smaller in ATL-146e-treated vs. control dogs (16.7 +/- 3.7% vs. 33.3 +/- 6.2%, P < 0.05; protocol 1). ATL-146e reduced neutrophil accumulation into infarcted myocardium of ATL-146e-treated vs. control dogs (30 +/- 7 vs. 88 +/- 16 cells/high-power field, P < 0.002).

Because it can simultaneously extract and derivatize compounds of interest by methylbenzol and N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) in HF-LPME, the approach overcomes the drawbacks of considerable time-consuming and tedious operation, meanwhile improves enrichment multiple. The optimized conditions were extraction for 20 min at 35 degrees C with 5.0 microL of mixed extraction solvent (methylbenzol/MSTFA=1:1, v/v) with stirring speed of 925 rpm in 5.0 mL sample under pH 12.0 and 14% (w/v) NaCl. The method provided very wide linear ranges (0.25-400 ng mL(-1)) and low detection limits in the range of 0.08-0.10 ng mL(-1) for clenbuterol, metoprolol and propranolol while enrichment factors reached up to 256. The analytes could be determined in spiked urine by the method with high extraction efficacy (93.79-109.04% recoveries) and precision (<9.70% RSD). It has a satisfactory result for metoprolol in practical human urine samples for a single-dose administration of 50 mg after 36 h. The proposed method only needs few microliters of organic solvent and derivatizing agent; the operation is simple, convenient and rapid for the trace analysis of beta-agonists and beta-blockers in biological fluids; it can be readily generalized for high sample throughput.

In addition, we evaluated the effect of therapy on plasma visfatin levels in 16 hypothyroid and in 25 hyperthyroid patients. Markedly low visfatin levels were found in hyperthyroid patients [9.44 (8.07- 10.8) ng/ml] compared with the hypothyroid [49.93 (40.72- 59.1) ng/ml] and control groups [38.6 (30.6-46.6) ng/ml] (p<0.001, p<0.001). Plasma visfatin levels in patients with hypothyroidism decreased significantly following treatment [58.58 (10.21-190.7) ng/ml vs 40.00 (10.01-102.6) ng/ml; p=0.001]. Plasma visfatin levels increased significantly after antithyroid therapy in patients with hyperthyroidism [7.86 (1.02-19.23) ng/ml vs 12.63 (3.48-110.9) ng/ml; p<0.001]. There were negative correlations between visfatin levels with free T3 (r=-0.719, p<0.001), and free T4 (r=-0.716, p<0.001) levels. There was a positive correlation between visfatin and TSH levels (r=0.701, p<0.001). There was a negative correlation between delta visfatin levels with delta free T3, delta free T4 (r=-0.686, p<0.001; r=-0.624, p<0.001). Visfatin thus seems to be regulated by thyroid hormones. While the influence of thyroid dysfunction on adipocytokine production and release is still poorly understood, the results of our study suggest that the effects of hyper- and hypothyroidism on various metabolic parameters may be partly mediated by visfatin.", 
    "101": "Adrenergic activation of electrogenic K+ secretion in isolated mucosa from guinea pig distal colon was desensitized by peptide-YY (PYY). Addition of PYY or neuropeptide-Y (NPY) to the bathing solution of mucosae in Ussing chambers suppressed the short-circuit current (Isc) corresponding to electrogenic Cl- secretion, whether stimulated by epinephrine (epi), prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), or carbachol (CCh). Neither peptide markedly inhibited the large transient component of synergistic secretion (PGE2 + CCh). Sustained Cl- secretory Isc was inhibited approximately 65% by PYY or NPY, with IC50s of 4.1 +/- 0.9 nM and 9.4 +/- 3.8 nM, respectively. This inhibition was eliminated by BIIE0246, an antagonist of the Y2-neuropeptide receptor (Y2-NpR), but not by Y1-NpR antagonist BVD10. Adrenergic sensitivity for activation of K+ secretion in the presence of Y2-NpR blockade by BIIE0246 was (EC50s) 2.9 +/- 1.2 nM for epi and 13.3 +/- 1.0 nM for norepinephrine, approximately fourfold greater than in the presence of PYY. Expression of mRNA for both Y1-NpR and Y2-NpR was indicated by RT-PCR of RNA from colonic mucosa, and protein expression was indicated by immunoblot. Immunoreactivity (ir) for Y1-NpR and Y2-NpR was distinct in basolateral membranes of columnar epithelial cells in the crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn as well as intercrypt surface epithelium. Adrenergic nerves in proximity with crypts were detected by ir for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, and a portion of these nerves also contained NPY(ir). BIIE0246 addition increased secretagog-activated Isc, consistent with in vitro release of either PYY or NPY. Thus PYY and NPY were able to suppress Cl- secretory capacity and desensitize the adrenergic K+ secretory response, providing a direct inhibitory counterbalance against secretory activation.", 
    "102": "A combination of tyrosine, capsaicin, catechins, and caffeine has been shown to possess a thermogenic effect in humans. The present objective was to investigate whether the thermogenic response to the bioactive combination (BC) could be diminished or abolished by propranolol. Twenty-two men (age, 29.0 +/- 7.1 years; body mass index, 26.0 +/- 3.6 kg/m(2); mean +/- SD) participated in a 4-way, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. The effect of the following was tested: (1) placebo, (2) BC, (3) BC + 5 mg propranolol, and (4) BC + 10 mg propranolol. Resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and the thermogenic response were measured for 5 hours postintake. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate, and appetite ratings were assessed every half hour. The BC increased resting metabolic rate by 5% (73 [36; 110] kJ/5 h, mean [95% confidence interval], P < .0001) compared with placebo. Both propranolol doses blunted the thermogenic response by 50% compared with placebo (P < .01). The BC increased SBP by 3% (4 +/- 1 mm Hg, P = .003) compared with placebo. The effect of BC on SBP was reduced by 25% by propranolol (P = .07). The BC (with or without propranolol) increased DBP by 6% (4 +/- 1 mm Hg, P </= .0002). Propranolol decreased heart rate by 5% (3 +/- 1 beats per minute, P < .0001) compared with placebo and BC. No effects were observed on appetite ratings. In conclusion, the study confirms the thermogenic properties of BC. The 50% reduction of the thermogenic response by propranolol indicates that beta-adrenergic pathways are partly responsible for the thermogenic response.",

    "109": "Harmaline-induced tremor in rodents is a model of essential tremor. We utilized a novel assay to quantify tremor activity in mice and found that tremor activity was dependent on harmaline dose. The first-line clinical essential tremor treatments propranolol, primidone and gabapentin and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) significantly attenuated harmaline-induced tremor. The anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine and the mood stabilizer lithium suppressed harmaline-induced tremor. The gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) receptor subtype A receptor agonist muscimol attenuated harmaline-induced tremor. By contrast, the GABA(B) receptor agonist R-baclofen increased tremor at the lowest dose tested, but had no effects at higher doses. Administration of the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists phencyclidine or 5R,10S-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (MK-801) attenuated harmaline-induced tremor. The competitive NMDA antagonist D-4-[(2E)-3-phosphono-2-propenyl]-2-piperazinecarboxylic acid (d-CPPene) dose-dependently blocked harmaline-induced tremor, as did the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide disodium salt (NBQX). The metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 (mGlu5) receptor antagonist 6-methyl-2-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) was inactive against tremor. The dopamine reuptake inhibitor GBR12909 and the dopamine D(1)/D(2) receptor agonist apomorphine attenuated harmaline-induced tremor. Follow-up studies indicated that dopamine D(2)/D(3) but not dopamine D(1) receptor activation likely mediates the effects of apomorphine and GBR12909. Administration of compounds with sedative side-effects had no effect on tremor activity. In summary, the present data confirm the pharmacological validity of harmaline-induced tremor in mice, quantified via a novel assay, as an animal model of essential tremor. Further, these data provide additional evidence for the roles of ionotropic glutamate, GABA(A) and dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors in the neurobiology of harmaline-induced tremor.", 
    "110": "High blood pressure is often difficult to control. Resistant hypertension is blood pressure above goal despite adherence to a combination of at least three antihypertensive medications of different classes, optimally dosed and usually including a diuretic. The approach to blood pressure that is apparently difficult to control begins with an assessment of the patient's adherence to the management plan, including lifestyle modifications and medications. White-coat hypertension may need to be ruled out. Suboptimal therapy is the most common reason for failure to reach the blood pressure goal. Once-daily fixed-dose combination pills may improve control through the synergism of antihypertensive agents from different classes and improved adherence. Truly drug-resistant hypertension is commonly caused by chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, or hyperaldosteronism, all of which can lead to fluid retention. Higher doses of diuretics (or a change to a loop diuretic) are usually needed. Other strategies include adding an alpha blocker, alpha-beta blocker, clonidine, or an aldosterone antagonist (e.g., spironolactone). Particularly in patients with diabetes or renal disease, combining a long-acting nondihydropyridine with a dihydropyridine calcium channel . blocker can also be considered. Obesity, heavy alcohol intake, high levels of dietary sodium, and interfering substances (especially nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) contribute to hypertension that is resistant or difficult to control.",

    "115": "The negative motivational aspects of withdrawal include symptoms of both anxiety and depression, and emerge after termination of chronic drug use as well as after acute drug exposure. States of acute withdrawal are an inherent part of intermittent drug use in humans, but the contribution of acute withdrawal to the development of addiction has received limited systematic investigation, because of a lack of preclinical models for withdrawal states that emerge spontaneously after acute drug exposure. Here, we have characterized a spontaneous increase in the magnitude of the acoustic startle reflex (ie, spontaneous withdrawal-potentiated startle) that emerges after acute morphine administration in rats, and compared the time course of startle potentiation and place conditioning. We find that startle potentiation seems to be related to a decrease in opiate receptor occupancy and reflects an anxiety-like state with a pharmacological profile similar to other signs of opiate withdrawal. Spontaneous startle potentiation emerges before the rewarding effects of morphine have subsided, even though naloxone administration after a single morphine exposure causes both startle potentiation and conditioned place aversion (CPA). These results show that negative emotional signs of withdrawal develop after just one exposure to morphine, and are likely a recurrent aspect of intermittent drug use that may contribute to the earliest adaptations underlying the development of addiction. Furthermore, the dissociation between spontaneous startle potentiation and CPA suggests anxiogenic and dysphoric manifestations of opiate withdrawal may be mediated by distinct neural mechanisms that are progressively engaged as withdrawal unfolds.",

Homogenized tissue samples were extracted with acetonitrile and purified using a NH2 solid-phase extraction cartridge. An Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column was used to separate the analytes, followed by tandem mass spectrometry using an electrospray ionization source in positive mode.

    "124": "Elective temporary cardiac arrest (cardioplegia) is often required during cardiac surgery. In the 1970 s, the development of hyperkalaemic cardioplegic solutions revolutionised cardiac surgery by offering effective chemically-induced cardiac arrest and myocardial protection during global ischaemia. Despite remaining the most widely-used cardioplegic technique, hyperkalaemia can have detrimental effects due to the Na and Ca loading of the cardiac cell induced by depolarisation of the cell membrane. Efforts over the last two decades to establish better cardioplegic agents have mainly remained limited to animal experiments. The failure of these approaches to progress to clinical trials may be due to a lack of clear criteria that a cardioplegic agent should meet at a cellular level and, more importantly, at a system level. In this review we attempt to define the criteria for the optimal cardioplegic agent. We also assess the suitability and clinical potential of previously-studied cardioplegic agents and suggest cellular targets, particularly those involved in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, that may prove to be attractive options for the development of new cardioplegic drugs. Finally, we propose a multicellular target approach using a combination of pharmacological agents in order to offer better cardioplegic solutions.", 
    "125": "In order to improve the understanding of the fate and behaviour of pharmaceuticals in the environment there is a need to investigate in-stream depletion mechanisms, e.g. phototransformation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in natural surface waters. In this study, abiotic and biotic degradation of selected beta-blockers was measured simultaneously in non-sterilised and sterilised river waters and deionised water (DIW) under simulated sunlight (lambda: 295-800 nm) and dark conditions, and at environmentally relevant concentrations, i.e.<or= ppb levels. Results suggested that the overall degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics under the solar simulation conditions and was between two and ten times faster in river waters than in DIW. There was a significant correlation (p < 0.07) between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and overall first order degradation rate constants for the tested beta-blockers (n = 4-6), suggesting coloured DOC triplet-induced or reactive transient mediated oxidation mechanisms in river waters. Phototransformation was the main depletion mechanism for the beta-blockers tested over a 2 to 7 day period. Slow hydrolysis was observed for metoprolol only. Loss due to biodegradation in river waters was not observed for propranolol but was found for metoprolol and atenolol at a very slow rate within the study period. However, biodegradation of metoprolol was accelerated under the light conditions, implying that photo-induced intermediates could be more easily biodegraded in river waters.", 
    "126": "A 65-year-old woman presented to the hospital with weight loss and diarrhea. A diagnosis of thyroid storm was established by the presence of fever, lethargy, tachycardia, heart failure (HF), and abnormal thyroid function tests. An acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was suspected because of anteroseptal ST-segment elevations on electrocardiogram and severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with apical dilation on echocardiogram. The ejection fraction (EF) was 25%. Treatment for ACS and HF was begun. Coronary arteriography revealed normal coronaries. Propylthiouracil and corticosteroids were added to treat thyrotoxicosis. On Day 4, repeat echocardiography confirmed an EF of 65% and complete resolution of LV dysfunction and cavity dilation. Reversible LV dysfunction and apical cavity dilation is consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. While commonly associated with psychological trauma, its association with thyroid storm has only been reported twice before. Knowledge of this possible association is of importance in establishing the diagnosis and instituting a proper treatment plan.", 
    "127": "Are all beta-blockers alike? This is an important question with the recent controversy surrounding their role as a first-line treatment of hypertension. This class of drugs is heterogeneous. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS)--the presumed main target of beta-blocker activity--is one of the central pathways in the pathophysiology of hypertension, both through its own effects on the heart and vasculature and through its interactions with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The beta-blockers are defined by, and exert their influence through, blocking catecholamine binding to the beta1-, beta2-, and alpha1-adrenergic receptors. Traditional beta-blockers (eg, atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol) affect only the beta-adrenergic receptors, whereas carvedilol and labetalol mediate vasodilation through blockade of the alpha1-adrenergic receptor. Other drugs like nebivolol may exert vasodilation via stimulation of nitric oxide. Vasodilation may be important not only for blood pressure reduction, but also for tolerability. The importance of SNS activation in the pathogenesis of hypertension and the utility of beta-blockers in certain compelling indications for cardiovascular disease indicate that these drugs still have an important role for many patients in the management of hypertension.", 
    "128": "One of the goals of pharmacogenomics is the use of genetic variants to predict an individual's response to treatment. Although numerous candidate and genome-wide associations have been made for cardiovascular response-outcomes, little is known about how a given polymorphism imposes the phenotype. Such mechanisms are important, because they tie the observed human response to specific signaling alterations and thus provide cause-and-effect relationships, aid in the design of hypothesis-based clinical studies, can help to devise workaround drugs, and can reveal new aspects of the pathophysiology of the disease. Here we discuss polymorphisms within the adrenergic receptor network in the context of heart failure and beta-adrenergic receptor blocker therapy, where multiple approaches to understand the mechanism have been undertaken. We propose a comprehensive series of studies, ranging from transfected cells, transgenic mice, and ex vivo and in vitro human studies as a model approach to explore mechanisms of action of pharmacogenomic effects and extend the field beyond observational associations.", 
    "129": "Previous studies have shown that the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat, a nonobese type 2 diabetes model, has an increased white adipose tissue (WAT) and islet blood flow when compared with control rats. The aim of the study was to examine if these increased blood flow values in GK rats could be affected by the beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist SR-59230A. We measured organ blood flow with a microsphere technique 10 min after administration of SR-59230A (1 mg/kg body wt), or the corresponding volume of 0.9% NaCl solution (1 ml/kg body wt) in rats anaesthetized with thiobutabarbital. The GK rat had an increased blood flow in all intra-abdominal adipose tissue depots except for the sternal fat pad compared with Wistar-Furth (WF) rats. However, no differences were seen in the blood perfusion of subcutaneous white or brown adipose tissue. The blood flow was also increased in both the pancreas and in the islets in the GK rat compared with WF rats. SR-59230A treatment affected neither WAT nor pancreatic blood flow in WF rats. In GK rats, on the other hand, SR-59230A decreased both WAT and islet blood flow values to values similar to those seen in control WF rats. The whole pancreatic blood flow was not affected by SR-59230A administration in GK rats. Interestingly, the brown adipose tissue blood flow in GK rats increased after SR-59230A administration. These results suggest that beta(3)-adrenoceptors are involved in regulation of blood flow both in islet and in adipose tissue.", 
    "130": "Reflex vasoconstriction (VC) is attenuated in aged skin resulting in greater skin blood flow and heat loss during cold exposure. We hypothesized that adrenergic function is compromised due to depletion of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), an essential cofactor required for catecholamine synthesis, and therefore local BH(4) supplementation would functionally augment reflex and pharmacologically induced VC elicited by gradual whole-body cooling (skin temperature (T(sk)) = 30.5 degrees C) and tyramine infusion, respectively. Four microdialysis (MD) fibres were placed in the forearm skin of 11 young (Y) and 11 older (O) human subjects for infusion of (1) Ringer solution (control), (2) 5 mM BH(4), (3) 5 mM BH(4) + 10 mM ascorbate, and (4) 5 mM BH(4) + adrenoreceptor blockade (5 mM yohimbine + 1 mM propranolol). Laser Doppler flux (LDF) was measured over each MD site and cutaneous vascular conductance was calculated as CVC = LDF/MAP and expressed as per cent change from baseline (% DeltaCVC(base)). The VC response was lower at the control site in O during cooling (Y: -34 +/- 2% DeltaCVC(base), O: -17 +/- 2% DeltaCVC(base); P < 0.001) and tyramine infusion (Y: - 33 +/- 4% DeltaCVC(base), O: -15 +/- 3% DeltaCVC(base); P < 0.001). BH(4) infusion normalized O to Y values during both cooling (Y: -34 +/- 4% DeltaCVC(base), O: -34 +/- 2% DeltaCVC(base); P < 0.001) and tyramine (Y: -38 +/- 4% DeltaCVC(base), O: -35 +/- 3% DeltaCVC(base); P < 0.001), however, adding adrenoreceptor blockade abolished VC in aged skin indicating that BH(4) acts through adrenergic, not cotransmitter, mechanisms. Local BH(4) supplementation augments reflex and tyramine-induced VC in aged skin, suggesting that reduced BH(4) bioavailability may contribute to attenuated VC during whole-body cooling.", 
    "131": "The objective of this study was to produce sustained-release matrix tablets by means of injection moulding and to evaluate the influence of matrix composition, process temperature and viscosity grade of ethylcellulose on processability and drug release by means of a statistical design. The matrix tablets were physico-chemically characterized and the drug release mechanism and kinetics were studied. Formulations containing metoprolol tartrate (30%, model drug), ethylcellulose with dibutylsebacate (matrix former and plasticizer) and L-HPC were extruded and subsequently injection moulded into tablets (375mg, 10mm diameter, convex-shaped) at different temperatures (110, 120 and 130 degrees C). Dissolution tests were performed and tablets were characterized by means of DSC, X-ray powder diffraction studies, X-ray tomography, porosity and hardness. Tablets containing 30% metoprolol and 70% ethylcellulose (EC 4cps) showed an incomplete drug release within 24h (<50%). Formulations containing L-HPC and EC in a ratio of 20/50 and 27.5/42.5 resulted in nearly zero-order drug release, while the drug release rate was not constant when 35% L-HPC was included. Processing of these formulations was possible at all temperatures, but at higher processing temperatures the drug release rate decreased and tablet hardness increased. Higher viscosity grades of EC resulted in a faster drug release and a higher tablet hardness. The statistical design confirmed a significant influence of the EC and L-HPC concentration on drug release, while the processing temperature and EC viscosity grade did not affect drug release. Tablet porosity was low (<5%), independent of the formulation and process conditions. DSC and XRD demonstrated the formation of a solid dispersion. The hydration front in the tablets during dissolution was visualized by dynamic X-ray tomography, this technique also revealed an anisotropic pore structure through the tablet.",

Cox analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with the first cardiac event (syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, or death). Patients were subcategorized into tertiles by their adjusted Shannon entropy scores. The lowest tertile (score 0-0.469; n = 146) was used as a reference group; patients with intermediate tertile scores (0.470-0.665; n = 150) had no increased risk of cardiac events (HR = 1.19, P = 0.42) or aborted cardiac arrest/sudden cardiac death (HR = 1.58, P = 0.26), and those with the highest tertile scores (>0.665; n = 196) showed significantly increased risk of cardiac events (HR = 3.32, P <0.001) and aborted cardiac arrest/sudden cardiac death (HR = 2.62, P = 0.04).

This study aimed to investigate the enhanced attenuation of myocardial fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) possibly induced by joint treatment with benazepril and candesartan and the possible involvement of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1)-Smad signaling pathway. SHRs were treated with benazepril at 10 mg.kg.d, candesartan at 4 mg.kg.d, and a combination of 2 drugs at half dose, respectively, for 12 weeks. Echocardiography and histology indicated that joint treatment with 2 drugs more significantly inhibited myocardial fibrosis in SHRs than either monotherapy, as evidenced by the changes in cardiac structural parameters, ultrasonic integrated backscatters, collagen volume fraction, and perivascular collagen area. The collagen analyses further revealed that significant decreases in total collagen concentration, the ratio of collagen type I to type III, and collagen cross-linking were found after the enhanced attenuation of myocardial fibrosis. Western blot analysis showed that the protein expression of TGF-beta1 and Smad3 was significantly decreased after joint treatment with 2 drugs. We conclude that synergistic attenuation of myocardial fibrosis in SHRs is produced by combined use of benazepril and candesartan possibly through the modulation of TGF-beta/Smad signaling proteins.",

Although various drug therapies are used to lower peripheral blood pressure (BP) in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, the effects of the 4 major classes of antihypertensive agents on central BP, pulse pressure (PP) amplification, and arterial stiffness in this condition are not clear. Fifty-nine patients over the age of 60 years with untreated isolated systolic hypertension (systolic BP > or =140 mm Hg and diastolic BP <or =90 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to receive 1 of the following 4 antihypertensive agents: perindopril, atenolol, lercanidipine, or bendrofluazide. BP was measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer, and augmentation index and carotid-femoral (aortic) pulse wave velocity were measured at baseline, after 2 weeks of placebo therapy, and at the end of 10 weeks of active therapy. Peripheral systolic BP and peripheral PP were reduced similarly after treatment with all 4 classes of drug. However, central PP was only reduced significantly by perindopril, lercanidipine, and bendrofluazide, whereas atenolol had no effect. Lercanidipine reduced the augmentation index, whereas atenolol increased it. Aortic pulse wave velocity was not changed by any of the drugs. In summary, despite similar reductions in peripheral systolic and PPs with the 4 classes of drug, changes in central pressure and augmentation index varied. Because central PP and increased wave reflections are considered important risk factors in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, the choice of therapy may be influenced by these findings in the future.",

Cardiomyocytes were also isolated from the biopsies to measure active force (F(active)), resting force (F(passive)), and calcium sensitivity (pCa(50)). Myocardial effects of beta-blocker therapy were either shared by HFNEF and HFREF, unique to HFNEF or unique to HFREF.

As the population lives longer with chronic diseases, researchers estimate that the incidence of PAD will increase, likely increasing myocardial infarction, stroke and death. This paper reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, risk factors, treatment and management of PAD. With improved understanding of the disease process, risk factors and treatment, clinicians will be able to detect PAD earlier, provide diagnosis, treat and manage this disease. PAD is associated with reduced quality of life, and persons with PAD are also at risk of developing coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease. Better clinical evaluation and routine screening are important in identifying and treating patients at risk for PAD. All patients with PAD should receive risk-factor modification, such as treatment and education, about smoking cessation, blood pressure control and lowering of cholesterol. Appropriate pharmacological management includes antiplatelet therapy of aspirin, use of clopidogrel for those individuals who are sensitive to aspirin. Patients who have had bypass surgery or stent placement require dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel. The American Heart Association (AHA) states that treatment with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors is appropriate pharmacotherapy to treat PAD.

Although ACE-Is and BBs remain the therapies of choice for patients with HF-LVSD, many clinicians have attempted to further reduce patient morbidity and mortality by adding another inhibitor or blocker of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to an ACE-I or BB.

The girl had unstable gait with incoordination of limb movements, impairment of position and vibratory senses, dysarthria, pes cavus, positive Babinski sign and scoliosis. At the age of fourteen the girl was referred in a comatose condition, in a severe diabetic ketoacidosis. Ataxia and hypoactive knee and ankle jerks prompted the analysis of the frataxin gene (FXN; 606829). The most common molecular abnormality: GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in intron 1 was found with + 300 GAA repeats (1490bp) (normal individuals have 5 to 30 GAA repeat expansions, whereas affected individuals have from 70 to more than 1,000 GAA triplets). Electrocardiogram showed diffuse T wave inversion with sinus bradycardia, while ultrasound revealed concentric, symmetric hypertrophy of left ventricle leading to the diagnosis of hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy. At the age of 14 years, the patient was bound to the wheel-chair, unable to walk. Her brother started to show ataxia at the age of 8 years, and subsequent analysis showed hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy, too.

    "161": "Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) is a well-recognized assessment technique in patients with HF. Ventilatory efficiency, aerobic capacity and heart rate recovery are several parameters obtained from CPX that accurately reflect physiologic function and provide robust prognostic information. Pharmacotherapy is a vital component to the management of patients with HF. Numerous pharmacologic interventions, such as ACE inhibition and beta-blockade have demonstrated significant physiologic and prognostic improvement in this population. Furthermore, a number of investigations demonstrating a positive change in the CPX response resulting from a pharmacologic intervention now exist. Because CPX variables reflect pathophysiologic processes differently, their response to a given pharmacologic is unique. For example, beta-blockade has been shown to significantly improve ventilatory efficiency, one of the most powerful prognostic markers obtained from CPX, while not altering aerobic capacity or heart rate recovery. Conversely, ACE and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition appears to improve ventilatory efficiency and aerobic capacity. Given the prognostic value of CPX, gauging its improvement from pharmacotherapy may be advantageous in facilitating optimal titration of medications. A comprehensive review describing the physiologic and prognostic importance of CPX in the context of pharmacotherapy does not exist. This mini review will: 1. Identify key CPX variables obtained from CPX including aerobic capacity, ventilatory efficiency and heart rate recovery, 2.

    "163": "We report the first combined use of analytical spectroscopy, guest-host chemistry, and multivariate regression analysis for determination of enantiometric composition of multicomponent samples of chiral analytes. Sample solutions containing multicomponent analytes of ephedrine, tryptophan, propranolol, and proline of varying enantiomeric composition with beta-cyclodextrin (BCD) or methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (Me-BCD) as chiral host molecules were investigated using ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy. The interactions of enantiomers of chiral analytes with chiral hosts resulted in the formation of transient diastereomeric inclusion complexes with varying spectral properties. Multivariate analysis using partial-least-square (PLS) regression was used to correlate subtle changes in the UV-visible spectra of the guest-host complexes with the enantiomeric composition of the calibration samples. These PLS regressions were carefully optimized and then used to predict the enantiomeric composition of multicomponent chiral analytes of validation samples. The results of these validation studies demonstrate the predictive ability of the regression models for determination of future enantiomeric composition of samples. The accuracy of the models to correctly predict the enantiomeric composition of samples, evaluated by use of the root mean square percent relative error (RMS%RE) was analyte and chiral host dependent. In general, better prediction of enantiomeric composition of samples and low RMS%RE values were obtained when Me-BCD was used as the chiral host. The analyses procedure reported here is simple, rapid, and inexpensive. In addition, this approach does not require prior separation of chiral analytes, thus reducing analysis time and eliminating the need for expensive chiral columns.",

Oral Metoprolol alone was given to control ventricular rate. Spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm within 36 hours is in favor of new onset lightning induced AF.", 
    "165": "Nicotine stimulates presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in perivascular adrenergic nerves and releases unknown transmitter(s) that activate transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) located on calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-containing (CGRPergic) nerves, resulting in vasodilation. The present study investigated a potential transmitter transmitting between perivascular adrenergic nerves and CGRPergic nerves. Rat mesenteric vascular beds without endothelium were contracted by perfusion with Krebs' solution containing methoxamine, and the perfusion pressure and pH levels of the perfusate were measured. Nicotine perfusion for 1 min induced concentration-dependent vasodilation and lowered pH levels, which were abolished by cold-storage denervation of preparations, guanethidine (adrenergic neuron blocker), and mecamylamine (nicotinic alpha(3)beta(4)-acetylcholine receptor antagonist). Capsazepine (TRPV1 antagonist) blunted nicotine-induced vasodilation, but had no effect on the reduction of pH. Injection of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and perfusion of Krebs' solution at low pH (6.0-7.2) induced vasodilation. HCl-induced vasodilation was inhibited by cold-storage denervation, capsazepine, capsaicin (CGRP depletor), and CGRP(8-37) (CGRP receptor antagonist). Perfusion of adrenergic transmitter metabolites (normetanephrine and 3-methoxydopamine), but not of other metabolites, induced vasodilation, which was not inhibited by capsaicin treatment. Immunohistochemical staining of mesenteric arteries showed dense innervation of CGRP- and TRPV1-immunopositive nerves, with both immunostainings appearing in the same neuron. Mesenteric arteries were densely innervated by neuropeptide Y-immunopositive nerves, which coalesced with CGRP-immunopositive nerves. Scanning and immunoscanning electron microscopic images showed coalescence sites of different perivascular fibers before they intruded into smooth muscles. These results indicate that nicotine initially stimulates adrenergic nerves via nicotinic alpha(3)beta(4)-receptors to release protons and thereby induces CGRPergic nerve-mediated vasodilation via TRPV1.",

The inhibitory effects of MMP-2 were reversible by washing the tissue with Krebs or in the presence of the MMP inhibitors TIMP-1 (1 microg/mL), Ro 28-2653, and BB-94 (10(-6) M), and were not associated with changes in IVC structure, demonstrating specificity. Angiotensin II (AngII, 10(-6) M) caused a monophasic contraction (114.2 +/- 12.2), that was also inhibited by MMP-2 (66.0 +/- 7.4), suggesting a post-receptor effect on the downstream mechanisms of VSM contraction. To test the role of Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, IVC was incubated in Ca(2+)-free 2 mM ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethyl ether-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid (EGTA) Krebs with or without MMP-2. In Ca(2+)-free Krebs, caffeine did not cause contraction, suggesting a limited role of the Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)-release mechanism, and Phe and AngII caused a small contraction (7.2 +/- 1.7 and 14.9 +/- 2.8) that was slightly increased by MMP-2 (10.4 +/- 3.0 and 33.8 +/- 10.0), suggesting little effect on IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) release. To test the role of Ca(2+) entry through membrane channels, after eliciting a transient Phe contraction in nominally 0 Ca(2+) Krebs, increasing concentrations of CaCl(2) (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 2.5 mM) were added and the extracellular Ca(2+) concentration [Ca(2+)](e)-contraction relationship was constructed. The [Ca(2+)](e)-contraction relation was reduced in MMP-2 treated IVC, suggesting inhibition of Ca(2+) entry. In IVC treated with MMP-2, the Ca(2+) channel blocker diltiazem (10(-5)M) did not cause any further inhibition of Phe contraction, suggesting that Ca(2+) entry is already inhibited by MMP-2. To test whether MMP-2 actions involve generation of RGD and modulation of integrin receptors, experiments where repeated in IVC segments saturated with RGD (10(-5) M), or pretreated with the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin blocker cyclo(Ala-Arg-Gly-Asp-3-aminomethylbenzoyl) (cyclo-RGD). RGD-peptide caused only small relaxation of Phe contracted IVC (6.4 +/- 3.4%), and addition of MMP-2 to RGD-treated IVC caused further relaxation (69.7 +/- 3.0%). Pretreatment of IVC with cyclo-RGD did not significantly affect MMP-2 induced relaxation (55.0 +/- 5.0%).", 
    "169": "In rat IVC, MMP-2 attenuates [Ca(2+)](e)-dependent VSM contraction without affecting Ca(2+) release from intracellular Ca(2+) stores. MMP-2 induced VSM relaxation may not involve RGD generation or activation of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptor. MMP-2 induced inhibition of the Ca(2+) entry mechanism of VSM contraction may play a role in the venous dilation associated with varicose vein formation."
