    "0": "Depression is prevalent in patients with heart failure, and the two conditions share underlying physiologic mechanisms. The prevalence of depression increases sharply with the severity of heart failure symptoms, an important consideration when confronting patients with worsening heart failure. Depression leads to poorer outcomes in patients with heart failure, including increased risk of poor functional status, hospital readmission, and death. Although beta-blockers are often implicated in the development and exacerbation of depression, evidence for this association is lacking, so withholding beta-blocker therapy is not recommended for patients with heart failure and depression. Evidence on whether therapy for depression also improves cardiac outcomes in heart failure patients is inconclusive, and further research on this question is needed. Nevertheless, early identification of depression in heart failure patients is imperative, as it can facilitate intervention attempts.",

All-cause mortality was not different between first-line CCBs and any other first-line antihypertensive classes. CCBs reduced the following outcomes as compared to beta-blockers: total cardiovascular events (RR 0.84, 95% CI [0.77, 0.92]), stroke (RR 0.77, 95% CI [0.67, 0.88]) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI [0.81, 0.99]). CCBs increased total cardiovascular events (RR 1.05 , 95% CI [1.00, 1.09], p = 0.03) and congestive heart failure events (RR 1.37, 95% CI [1.25, 1.51]) as compared to diuretics.

Endothelial function is influenced by various factors, including hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, renal dysfunction and anemia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate which risk factor is the strongest effector of MPR in subjects without regional myocardial ischemia. We studied 110 patients (66 years \u00b110, male 68%, hypertension 76%, diabetes mellitus (DM) 40% and dyslipidemia 65%) without regional myocardial ischemia. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) stress and rest first-pass perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired with a 1.5-T MR system, and MPR was calculated as the ratio of stress to rest myocardial blood flow (MBF). Average rest MBF in 110 patients was 1.07\u00b10.62\u2009ml\u2009min\u207b\u00b9\u2009g\u207b\u00b9, whereas stress MBF was 3.15\u00b11.93\u2009ml\u2009min\u207b\u00b9\u2009g\u207b\u00b9 and the MPR was 3.33\u00b11.82. Rest MBF correlated significantly with hematocrit, whereas stress MBF showed a strong correlation with estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR). MPR was associated with hypertension, age, e-GFR, hematocrit and left ventricular mass index (LVMI). In multiple regression analysis, hypertension (P=0.003, \u03b2=-0.274) showed the strongest correlation with MPR among other risk factors, such as diabetes (P=ns), dyslipidemia (P=ns), e-GFR (P=ns), LVMI (P=0.007, \u03b2=-0.248) and hematocrit (P=ns) after adjusting age and gender. Hypertension is the most important effector of MPR in subjects without myocardial ischemia.", 
    "9": "The psychotomimetic drug D-amphetamine (AMPH), disrupts prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response, an operational measure of sensorimotor gating that is deficient in schizophrenia patients. Historically, this effect has been attributed to dopaminergic substrates; however, AMPH also increases norepinephrine (NE) levels, and enhancement of central NE transmission has been shown recently to disrupt PPI. This study examined the extent to which NE might participate in AMPH-induced disruptions of PPI and increases in locomotor activity, another classic behavioral effect of AMPH, by determining whether antagonism of postsynaptic NE receptors blocked these effects. Separate groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats received either the \u03b11 receptor antagonist, prazosin (0, 0.3, 1 mg/kg), or the \u03b2 receptor antagonist timolol (0, 3, 10 mg/kg) before administration of AMPH (0 or 1 mg/kg) before testing for PPI or locomotor activity. As an initial exploration of the anatomical substrates underlying possible \u03b11 receptor-mediated effects on AMPH-induced PPI deficits, the \u03b11 receptor antagonist terazosin (0 or 40 \u03bcg/0.5 \u03bcl) was microinfused into the nucleus accumbens shell (NAccSh) in conjunction with systemic AMPH administration before startle testing in a separate experiment. Prazosin, but not timolol, blocked AMPH-induced hyperactivity; both drugs reversed AMPH-induced PPI deficits without altering baseline startle responses. Interestingly, AMPH-induced PPI deficits also were partially blocked by terazosin in NAccSh. Thus, behavioral sequelae of AMPH (PPI disruption and hyperactivity) may be mediated in part by NE receptors, with \u03b11 receptors in NAccSh possibly having an important role in the sensorimotor gating deficits induced by this psychotomimetic drug.", 
    "10": "Carvedilol is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist used for treating chronic heart failure (CHF). Two clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of R- and S-carvedilol, and associated covariates, in patients with CHF. Fifty-eight patients (male=45, female=13) with New York Heart Association class I-IV CHF were enrolled in two clinical studies. R- and S-carvedilol concentrations were measured using HPLC at steady-state after oral administration of carvedilol at 1.25-20 mg o.d. or b.i.d. The data from both studies were used to estimate the population pharmacokinetic parameters and covariates using the nonlinear mixed effects model program. For 40 patients evaluated in one clinical study, the cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 *1, *10, and *5 genotypes were determined using allele-specific primer PCR, and individual patients' oral clearance (CL/F) of both enantiomers were estimated by the empirical Bayes method. A one-compartment model with a first-order absorption rate was established, in which body weight and alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein were significant covariates. Individual CL/F values for carvedilol were significantly lower in Japanese CHF patients with the CYP2D6 *1/*5, *5/*10 and *10/*10 genotypes. Estimation of the population pharmacokinetic parameters and their covariates for each enantiomer in Japanese patients with CHF showed that the CL/F values for R- and S-carvedilol were dependent on body weight, alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein, and CYP2D6 genotype. Prediction of exposure to free plasma carvedilol is important for dosage adjustment of beta-blocker therapy in patients with CHF.", 
    "11": "The cardiovascular system is under the control of the circadian clock, and disturbed circadian rhythms can induce cardiovascular pathologies. This cyclic regulation is probably brought about by the circadian expression of genes encoding enzymes and regulators involved in cardiovascular functions. We have previously shown that the rhythmic transcription of output genes is, in part, regulated by the clock-controlled PAR bZip transcription factors DBP (albumin D-site binding protein), HLF (hepatic leukemia factor), and TEF (thyrotroph embryonic factor). The simultaneous deletion of all three PAR bZip transcription factors leads to increased morbidity and shortened life span. In the present study, we demonstrate that Dbp/Tef/Hlf triple knockout mice develop cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction associated with a low blood pressure. These dysfunctions are exacerbated by an abnormal response to this low blood pressure characterized by low aldosterone levels. The phenotype of PAR bZip knockout mice highlights the importance of circadian regulators in the modulation of cardiovascular functions.",

    "16": "The rate of rebleeding from esophageal varices remains appreciably high after cessation of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Many measures have been developed to prevent the occurrence of rebleeding. Endoscopic therapy plays a central role in the prevention of variceal bleeding. In the 1980s sclerotherapy played a pivotal role in the prevention of variceal rebleeding, but now yields to endoscopic variceal ligation. Compared with sclerotherapy, a lower incidence of complications and rebleeding is associated with banding ligation. On the other hand, beta-blockers are also noted to be able to reduce portal pressure, leading to the reduction of variceal rebleeding. The reduction of variceal rebleeding with beta-blockers plus nitrates is as effective as banding ligation. The combination of beta-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation has proven to be more efficacious than banding ligation alone in the reduction of variceal rebleeding and is the treatment of choice for patients with failure in either medical or endoscopic therapy. Patients with repeated rebleeding despite endoscopic therapies may require transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt or shunt operation as a rescue therapy.", 
    "17": "Portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia may cause gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with portal hypertension. Whereas the former presents exclusively in patients with portal hypertension, gastric antral vascular ectasia can also be observed in patients with other conditions. Diagnosis is established with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, although some cases may require a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. The most frequent manifestation is ferropenic anemia, which may become transfusion dependent. Treatment in portal hypertensive gastropathy is focused on portal pressure reducing drugs, mainly nonselective beta-blockers, whereas in gastric antral vascular ectasia treatment is based on endoscopic ablation. More invasive options can be used if first-line therapies fail, although these should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.",

From a clinical standpoint, the most significant consequence of portal hypertension is the development of esophageal varices. Despite the many advances in the management of variceal bleeding, it remains a life-threatening complication of portal hypertension. Primary prophylaxis to prevent the first bleeding episode in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices is therefore critically important in the management of patients with cirrhosis.",

This technique requires little or no sample preparation prior to the actual analysis. Along with other application areas, DESI-MS is used to obtain chemical images of different biomolecules in biological tissue sections. In the case of biological tissue analysis, only preparation of the tissue slices is necessary. Furthermore, the method does not require the use of an ionization matrix preventing the redistribution of analytes prior to the analysis. Chemical images are obtained by monitoring the mass spectrometric signals of compounds while moving the sample relative to the DESI sprayer.",

    "25": "A novel method was developed for the analysis of four beta-blockers, namely sotalol, carteolol, bisoprolol, and propranolol, in human urine by coupling carrier-mediated liquid phase microextraction (CM-LPME) to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). By adding an appropriate carrier in organic phase, simultaneous extraction and enrichment of hydrophilic (sotalol, carteolol, and bisoprolol) and hydrophobic (propranolol) drugs were achieved. High enrichment factors were obtained by optimizing the compositions of the organic phase, the acceptor solution, the donor solution, the stirring rate, and the extraction time. The linear ranges were from 0.05 to 10.0 mg L(-1) for sotalol and carteolol, and from 0.05 to 8.0 mg L(-1) for bisoprolol and propranolol. The limits of detection (S/N=3) were 0.01 mg L(-1) for sotalol, carteolol, and bisoprolol, and 0.005 mg L(-1) for propranolol. The relative standard deviations were lower than 6%. The developed method exhibited high analyte preconcentration and excellent sample clean-up effects with little solvent consumption and was found to be sensitive and suitable for simultaneous determination of the above four drugs spiked in human urine. Furthermore, the successful analysis of propranolol in real urine specimens revealed that the determination of beta-blockers in human urine is feasible using the present method.", 
    "26": "A large body of evidence indicates that endothelial dysfunction is a characteristic of patients with arterial hypertension. As functional abnormalities lead to impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, this early step of atherogenesis is potentially reversible. In addition to reducing blood pressure, the major families of anti-hypertensive drugs have a number of pleiotropic effects that could improve endothelial function. In particular, the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of both arterial hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, and so drugs capable of limiting the dangerous effects of this hormonal axis, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and renin inhibitors, could help prevent/delay/reverse the atherosclerotic process. New third-generation \u03b2-blockers and 5-phosphodiesterase inhibitors may affect endothelial function. Furthermore, the HMGCoA-reductase inhibitors currently used to reduce cholesterol levels have major pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive effects. The preservation or recovery of endothelial function in hypertensive patients is crucial to inhibit the development of atherosclerosis and the onset of cardiovascular events. This review focuses on the ancillary effects of hypertensive drugs and HMGCoA-reductase inhibitors that go beyond lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels.", 
    "27": "Patients with cirrhosis develop varices at a rate of 5% per year, and a third of patients with high-risk varices will bleed. The mortality associated with variceal haemorrhage is typically 20%, and still exceeds that of myocardial infarction. Current options to prevent the first variceal bleed include noncardioselective beta-blockers or variceal band ligation. In patients with medium-to-large esophageal varices, both therapies reduce the risk of bleeding by 50% or more. The choice of therapy should take into account patient choice and local availability; although for most patients drug therapy is the preferred first-line treatment. There has been recent interest in carvedilol, with promising initial data. Further studies are necessary before universal recommendation. There is no role for drug therapy in patients without varices, and the use of beta-blockers for patients with small varices is controversial.", 
    "28": "Coexistence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, factors associated with future development of DM have not been well elucidated in patients already having essential hypertension. This study prospectively included 168 patients (mean age 41 +/- 7 years, 112 men) with essential hypertension. All patients did not have DM and vascular or renal complications initially. Baseline demographic data, blood pressure, body mass index, and antihypertensive agents were carefully evaluated and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured at the beginning of the study. All of the patients were followed for at least 6 months. The study endpoint was occurrence of new DM. After a mean follow-up period of 32 +/- 10 months, 22 subjects (13.1%) developed new DM. Patients with new DM had higher baseline glucose (105.2 +/- 11.8 vs 94.2 +/- 8.0 mg/dl, P < 0.001), triglyceride level (213.7 +/- 112.4 vs 155.6 +/- 83.2 mg/dl, P = 0.04), log hsCRP (0.31 +/- 0.44 vs 0.19 +/- 0.25 mg/dl, P = 0.016), and lower high-density lipoprotein (40.2 +/- 7.8 vs 46.6 +/- 14.4 mg/dl, P = 0.045). Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, homeostasis model assessment index, and adiponectin were not different in patients with or without new DM. Among antihypertensive agents, only use of beta-blocker was significantly associated with new DM (P = 0.008). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed log hsCRP (hazard ratio [HR] 9.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.97-32.10, P < 0.001), age (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06-1.38, P = 0.004), and baseline glucose level (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.15, P < 0.001) to be independent predictors for occurrence of new DM. High-sensitivity CRP was an independent factor for future development of DM in essential hypertensive patients.

    "45": "Chymase plays a crucial role in angiotensin II formation in various tissues. Angiotensin II induces gene expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 precursors, and chymase can convert precursors of TGF-beta and MMP-9 to their active forms. In cultured fibroblasts, significant increases in cell growth and TGF-beta levels were observed after chymase injection; these increases were inhibited by a chymase inhibitor, but not by an angiotensin II-receptor blocker. In apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development depends on an increase in MMP-9 activities induced by angiotensin II infusion, but the inhibition of MMP-9 activation by a chymase inhibitor resulted in attenuation of the angiotensin II-induced AAA development. The upregulation of MMP-9 and TGF-beta levels is involved in damage to various organs, but these gene expressions are not completely induced by angiotensin II alone. Therefore, chymase inhibition may be useful for attenuating MMP-9 and TGF-beta levels, in addition to reducing angiotensin II formation, and this function may provide powerful organ protection. In this review, we propose the possible use of chymase inhibitors as agents to prevent organ damage.",

Previously, the X-ray crystal structure of beta(2)AR has been determined in complex with two partial inverse agonists, but the global impact of additional ligands on the structure or local impacts on the binding site are not well-understood. To assess the extent of such ligand-induced conformational differences, we determined the crystal structures of a previously described engineered beta(2)AR construct in complex with two inverse agonists: ICI 118,551 (2.8 A), a recently described compound (2.8 A) (Kolb et al, 2009), and the antagonist alprenolol (3.1 A). The structures show the same overall fold observed for the previous beta(2)AR structures and demonstrate that the ligand binding site can accommodate compounds of different chemical and pharmacological properties with only minor local structural rearrangements. All three compounds contain a hydroxy-amine motif that establishes a conserved hydrogen bond network with the receptor and chemically diverse aromatic moieties that form distinct interactions with beta(2)AR. Furthermore, receptor ligand cross-docking experiments revealed that a single beta(2)AR complex can be suitable for docking of a range of antagonists and inverse agonists but also indicate that additional ligand-receptor structures may be useful to further improve performance for in-silico docking or lead-optimization in drug design.",

Simultaneous electroencephalogram, electromyogram and locomotor activity were examined to analyze the sleep-wake state. We also examined heart rate, blood pressure and echocardiographic findings to verify the presence of hypertension. Hypertension with impaired ventricular contraction was observed in the rats with high-salt-chow consumption whereas normal-chow rats did not show these disorders. Although rats with the normal diet showed a standard daily rhythm with normal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep duration and locomotor activity, the high-salt-diet group exhibited an impaired daily rhythm with suppressed REM sleep and significant abnormal locomotor activity. Bisoprolol significantly improved the daily sleep-wake rhythm and locomotor activity. We showed that an impaired daily rhythm was closely related to the development of hypertension.

Sixteen Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats served as a control group. Echocardiography and cardiac catheterization were carried out to record the mitral flow velocity ratio of E wave to A wave (E/A), LV mass index (LVMI), maximal rising (dp/dt(max)) and falling (-dp/dt(max)) rate of the LV pressure and LV relaxation time constant (\u03c4). The mRNA and protein expression levels of AR, protein kinase(PK) and G-protein subtypes, intracellular free calcium (Ca) concentration and cardiocyte apoptoisis rate were determined. Three drug-treated groups showed higher velocity ratio of E wave to A wave (E/A) and -dp/dt(max) and lower systolic blood pressure (SBP), LVMI, \u03c4, apoptosis rate and intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration than the no treatment group.

In this study, the effects of beta-adrenergic compounds on the extinction of contextual conditioned fear responses were evaluated. Rats were trained with footshock in a conditioning box. In the 3 days following the training, the animals were re-exposed to the apparatus and received either a single or repeated intraperitoneal injections of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, or saline 30 min before (acquisition of extinction) or immediately after (consolidation of extinction) the extinction sessions. A drug-free session was performed on the last day. While repeated isoproterenol treatment facilitated the consolidation of contextual fear extinction, repeated propranolol administration impaired the acquisition and the consolidation of this process. Further, the role of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in the extinction of contextual conditioned fear was tested with an immunohistochemistry assay. Our results show a reduction in Fos-protein expression between the first and the last extinction session. In a follow-up experiment, intra-vmPFC microinjection of isoproterenol before the first extinction session facilitated the extinction of contextual fear. This facilitation was antagonized by pre-treatment with atenolol, suggesting that this change is mediated by beta-1-adrenergic activity. Our results reinforce the role of the vmPFC in fear extinction mechanisms, suggesting that vmPFC-beta-1-adrenergic receptor activation underlies part of the facilitation of the fear extinction processes.",

Recent studies have shown that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system plays an important role in NASH. The aim of our current study was to elucidate the effects of aldosterone (Ald) inhibition on the progression of NASH. In the choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined diet-induced rat NASH model, the effects of a clinically used selective Ald blocker (SAB) were elucidated in conjunction with the activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and neovascularization, which are both known to play important roles in liver fibrosis development and hepatocarcinogenesis, respectively. Liver fibrosis development and the glutathione-S-transferase placental form-positive pre-neoplastic lesions were both markedly attenuated by SAB along with the suppression of the activated HSC and neovascularization. SAB inhibited the hepatic expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 and also that of the vascular endothelial growth factor. Our in vitro study showed that SAB also inhibited the Ald-induced HSC proliferation and in vitro angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicated that Ald plays a pivotal role in the progression of NASH. Considering that SAB is already widely used in clinical practice, this drug could represent a potential new strategy against NASH in the future.",

The adrenergic system is the major regulator of minute-by-minute cardiovascular function. Inhibition of adrenergic signaling with pharmacological beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) is first-line therapy for heart failure and hypertension. Advances in pharmacology, molecular biology, and genetics of adrenergic signaling pathways have brought us to the point where personal genetic differences in adrenergic signaling factors are being assessed as determinants of risk or progression of cardiovascular disease. For a few polymorphisms, functional data generated in cell-based systems, genetic mouse models, and pharmacological provocation of human subjects are concordant with population studies that suggest altered risk of cardiovascular disease or therapeutic response to beta-blockers. For the majority of adrenergic pathway polymorphisms however, published data conflict, and the clinical relevance of individual genotyping remains uncertain. Here, the current state of laboratory and clinical evidence that adrenergic pathway polymorphisms can affect cardiovascular pathophysiology is comprehensively reviewed and compared, with a goal of placing these data in the broad context of potential clinical applicability.",

While their benefit is considered indisputable there is no consensus on the most suitable patients' population where benefits would prevail over the risks most significantly. Present trends suggest the shift from the frequent widespread use to the more targeted medication, where the general status of the patient as well as the nature of the operation is being considered. Individual dose should be targeted to the specific therapeutic end-points. While the non-therapeutic use of beta-blockers by lay public is possible there is growing interest in their therapeutic use in severely septic patients. Favourable clinical experience results mostly from their use in the burned patients, where the natural course of the illness has many similarities with the protracted course of severe sepsis. Favourable influence of beta-blockers on monotonous tachycardia with minimal reflex variability of heart rate and on the resulting mortality has been demonstrated. Clinical experience has accumulated up to date reflecting the use of propranolol mostly; the experience with the more cardioselective beta-blockers is mostly experimental. Although there are legitimate worries about possible circulatory depression by beta-blockers empirical data do not support this.

    "113": "Fibrosis is the final common pathway for various tissue lesions that lead to chronic progressive organ failure, and consequently effective antifibrotic drugs are strongly desired. However, there are few animal models in which it is possible to evaluate fibrosis sensitively in a short period of time. We therefore generated two transgenic rats harboring a firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of the 5'-flanking region of rat \u03b1(1)(I) collagen (Col1a1-Luc Tg rats) and \u03b1(2)(I) collagen (Col1a2-Luc Tg rats). The luciferase activities of these transgenic rats were highly correlated with the hydroxyproline content in various organs. In unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), a well-characterized model of renal fibrosis, the luciferase activity in obstructed kidneys showed a significant increase after even 3 days of UUO, while the hydroxyproline content showed little increase. In addition, the renal hydroxyproline content had a higher correlation with the luciferase activity than \u03b1(1)(I) collagen mRNA level for over 2 wk after UUO. Although both an ANG II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB), olmesartan, and a transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) type I receptor kinase (ALK5) inhibitor, SB-431542, inhibited renal luciferase activities in UUO, only SB-431542 inhibited luciferase activity induced by TGF-\u03b21 in isolated glomeruli. Double immunostaining for luciferase and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) revealed that some \u03b1-SMA-positive tubular epithelial cells and tubular interstitial cells produced type I collagen, which would lead to renal fibrosis. Thus collagen reporter transgenic rats would be very useful for the evaluation of antifibrotic effects and analysis of their mechanisms.",

Extracellular sucrose space (as a measure of sinusoidal relaxation) in perfused rat liver before and after propranolol or propranolol and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor) treatment were examined. The results showed that propranolol induces sinusoidal relaxation in the perfused liver and this effect could be abolished by NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME. 3. Two bolus injections of propranolol were given to the isolated perfused rat liver and outflow concentration-time profiles of intact propranolol were determined. A two-phase physiologically based organ pharmacokinetic model was applied to estimate hepatocellular influx, efflux, binding, ion-trapping and metabolic elimination pharmacokinetic parameters for propranolol. The recovery of propranolol in the second injection was approximately 54% of that in the first injection. The permeability-surface area product, the binding and the intrinsic clearance all increased significantly after prior exposure of the rat liver to the first bolus of propranolol (P < 0.05). 4. Based on the findings of the present study, we propose that the most likely explanation for the reduced availability of a second propranolol dose (after administration of a priming dose) in the perfused liver is a consequence of the NO-mediated sinusoidal relaxation effect of propranolol, arising from the priming dose. This observation supports the view that the pharmacokinetics of some drugs might be altered by the pharmacodynamic effects of the same drug given earlier in the perfused liver.",

Switching patients from \"not recommended\" beta adrenoblockers to bisoprolol was associated with significant improvement of clinical status with increase of 6 min walk distance, betterment of parameters of quality of life, and significant rise of LV EF combined with lowering of mean CHF functional class (all <0.01 compared with baseline). There was no significant dynamics of NT proBNP level in the whole group but in the subgroup with NT proBNP values above median significant lowering we noted its significant lowering (<0,05). No significant association between dynamics of main clinico-laboratory parameters and decrease of heart rate was observed. Switch of patients with moderate CHF to bisoprolol from therapy with beta adrenoblockers not recommended for application in this disease was associated with improvement of quality of life, clinical status, and LV systolic function.

In patients with unstable angina or non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) who are eligible for PCI, routine stenting is the recommended treatment strategy, based on the opinion of experts. Provisional stenting may provide a viable alternative by retaining the early benefits of stenting without its potential late hazards.Method. Patients with NSTE-ACS were randomised to provisional or routine stenting after coronary angiography. Patients were followed for up to ten years. The occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was recorded.Results. 237 consecutive patients with NSTE-ACS were randomly assigned to routine stenting (n=116) or provisional stenting (n=121). No difference in the incidence of MACE at 30 days was observed. At six months, angiographic restenosis was lower in the routine stenting group (41 vs. 20%, p=0.02), paralleled by more MACE in the provisional stenting group at one year (40.5 vs. 27.6%, p=0.036). At complete follow-up the difference in MACE was not significant (61.2 vs. 50%, p=0.084) because of relatively more target lesion revascularisations in the routine stent group. There was no difference in the incidence of very late stent thrombosis (1.7 vs. 3.4%, p=0.439). The only independent predictor of MACE was beta-blocker use (RR 0.62 [0.431; 0.892] p=0.010).Conclusion. In selective patients with NSTE-ACS, routine stenting was more beneficial than provisional stenting for a period of up to five years, driven by a reduction in repeat revascularisation procedures. After this period, the benefit was no longer significant. Beta-blocker use was the only independent predictor of MACE throughout the complete follow-up period. (Neth Heart J 2010;18:307-13.).",

Like the skin, the sclera supports a net negative charge under physiological pH conditions and has a pI between 3.5 and 4. Equally, the principles of trans-scleral iontophoretic transport of low molecular weight compounds are consistent with those observed for skin. Iontophoretic delivery of timolol and dexamethasone phosphate was proportional to applied current and drug concentration, and trans-scleral iontophoresis in rabbits led to enhanced intraocular levels of these compounds compared to passive delivery. The behaviour of higher molecular weight species such as peptide drugs and other biopharmaceuticals (e.g., proteins and oligonucleotides) has not been fully characterised. Further work has been undertaken, therefore, to examine the trans-scleral iontophoresis of vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic with a relatively high molecular weight of 1448 Da.

Clinical significance of drug interactions varies. * Studies which only identified drug interactions of potentially major clinical significance found lower prevalence, of between 2 and 16%. * Prevalence of drug interactions defined 'potentially hazardous' has had limited study, with no publications identified for the Australian population. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS * In the study population of 287 074, 1.5% of subjects were dispensed potentially hazardous interacting drug pairs. * However, limited to populations on specific medicines, it was found that for patients dispensed verapamil, methotrexate, amiodarone, lithium, warfarin, cyclosporin and itraconazole, potentially hazardous interactions occurred at a rate greater than 5%. * These patients should be the focus of medication review programmes to avoid potentially serious adverse drug events. BACKGROUND Up to 21% of adverse drug event-related hospital admissions are due to drug interactions. Clinical significance of drug interactions varies, and drug interactions defined 'potentially hazardous' are more likely to contribute to morbidity and mortality. AIM The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of potentially hazardous drug interactions in an elderly Australian veteran population. METHODS This study assessed the prevalence of potentially hazardous drug interactions, where hazardous was defined in three or more international drug interaction references, using Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme pharmacy claims data. Analysis was limited to patients who received regular concurrent dispensings of potentially hazardous interacting medicines. RESULTS Of the 287 074 subjects included in the study, 1.5% were dispensed potentially hazardous interacting drug pairs. For patients dispensed cyclosporin, concomitant use of a statin was common (47%); as was statin use with those dispensed itraconazole (31%). Of those dispensed methotrexate, 24% also received a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; of those on lithium, 18% also received an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin 2 receptor blocker; of those on warfarin, 7.2% and 5.9% were co-dispensed an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antiplatelets respectively; for those on verapamil, 5.3% were co-dispensed a beta-blocker, while for those on amiodarone 6.2% were co-dispensed digoxin. CONCLUSIONS Overall prevalence of potentially serious drug interactions appears to be low in the Australian veteran population. However, patients taking cyclosporine, itraconazole, methotrexate, lithium, warfarin, verapamil and amiodarone appear to be most at risk and their medicine use should be regularly reviewed to prevent potentially hazardous drug interactions.",

Interferon \u03b3-inducible protein (IP)-10/CXCL 10 is a T-helper type 1 (Th1) cell-related chemokine which is important in the recruitment of Th1 cells involved in host immune defense against intracellular pathogens such as viral infection. Regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES)/CCL 5 is a chemokine which plays a role in attractant of eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils toward the site of allergic inflammation. Bronchial epithelial cells are first-line barriers against pathogen invasion. However, whether SABAs have regulatory effects on the expression of IP-10 and RANTES in bronchial epithelial cells is unknown. BEAS-2B cells, the human bronchial epithelial cell lines, were pretreated with procaterol (one of the SABAs) or dibutyryl-cAMP (a cyclic AMP analog) at different doses for 1 h and then stimulated with poly I:C (10 \u03bcg/mL).

The study population consisted of 30 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II and III, aged 65-77\u00a0years, who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were randomly divided into two groups (n\u00a0=\u00a015 each): a control group, receiving normal saline, and a landiolol group, receiving landiolol at 30\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/min. After oxygenation, 1\u00a0\u03bcg/kg of fentanyl was injected intravenously, followed by continuous infusion of normal saline or landiolol for 5\u00a0min. General anesthesia was induced and maintained with target-controlled infusion of propofol at a blood concentration of 4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and tracheal intubation was performed 3\u00a0min after vecuronium injection. Heart rate, blood pressure, and bispectral index were measured before and after tracheal intubation. Results showed that low-dose continuous infusion of landiolol is an effective and relatively safe method of preventing an intubation-induced adrenergic response in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease.",

This compelling linkage prompted development of quantitative techniques leading to FDA-cleared commercial methodologies for measuring nonvisible levels of TWA in the frequency and time domains. The first aim of this review is to summarize evidence from more than a hundred studies enrolling a total of >12,000 patients that support the predictivity of TWA for cardiovascular mortality and sudden cardiac death. The second focus is on the usefulness of TWA in guiding therapy. Until recently, TWA has been used primarily in decision making for cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Its potential utility in guiding pharmacologic therapy has been underappreciated. We review clinical literature supporting the usefulness of TWA as an index of antiarrhythmic effects and proarrhythmia for different drug classes. Beta-adrenergic and sodium channel-blocking agents are the most widely studied drugs in clinical TWA investigations, with both reducing TWA magnitude; the exception is patients in whom sodium channel blockade discloses the Brugada syndrome and provokes macroscopic TWA. An intriguing possibility is that TWA may help to detect beneficial effects of nonantiarrhythmic agents such as the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan, which indirectly protects from arrhythmia through improving myocardial remodeling. We conclude that quantitative analysis of TWA has considerable potential to guide pharmacologic intervention and thereby serve as a therapeutic target.",

Therefore, our aims were to investigate: (a) the influence of CVR on CVW during repeated rest-exercise transitions; and (b) the influence of the sympathetic activity on CVR and CVW. Fifty-eight healthy men (22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years) performed 20 rest-exercise transitions interspaced by 30\u00a0s.

Cardiac vagal reactivation was assessed by a HR variability index (RMSSD) and CVW by the HR increase at the onset of a valid and reliable cycling protocol. The CVR and CVW responses were associated (partial r ranged from 0.60 to 0.66; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Participants with higher CVR over transitions maintained their CVW over repeated transitions [first transition (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM)\u00a0=\u00a01.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04 vs. 20th\u00a0=\u00a01.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 (a.u.), p\u00a0=\u00a00.24], while participants with lower CVR had a CVW decrease over repeated transitions [first transition (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM)\u00a0=\u00a01.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04 vs. 20th\u00a0=\u00a01.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 (a.u.), p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

    "201": "BK channels are large unitary conductance K(+) channels cooperatively activated by intracellular calcium and membrane depolarisation. We show that BK channels regulate electrical activity in \u03b2-cells of mouse pancreatic islets exposed to elevated glucose. In 11.1 mM glucose, the non-peptidyl BK channel blocker paxilline increased the height of \u03b2-cell action potentials (APs) by 21 mV without affecting burst- or silent-period durations. In isolated \u03b2-cells, paxilline increased AP height by 16 mV without affecting resting membrane potential. In voltage clamp, paxilline blocked a transient component of outward current activated by a short depolarisation, which accounted for at least 90% of the initial outward K(+) current. This BK current (I(BK)) was blocked by the Ca(2+) channel blockers Cd(2+) (200 \u03bcM) or nimodipine (1 \u03bcM), and potentiated by FPL-64176 (1 \u03bcM). I(BK) was also 56% blocked by the BK channel blocker iberiotoxin (100 nM). I(BK) activated more than 10-fold faster than the delayed rectifier I(Kv) over the physiological voltage range, and partially inactivated. An AP-like command revealed that I(BK) activated and deactivated faster than I(Kv) and accounted for 86% of peak I(K), explaining why I(BK) block increased AP height. A higher amplitude AP-like command, patterned on an AP recorded in 11.1 mM glucose plus paxilline, activated 4-fold more I(Kv) and significantly increased Ca(2+) entry. Paxilline increased insulin secretion in islets exposed to 11.1 mM glucose by 67%, but did not affect basal secretion in 2.8 mM glucose. These data suggest a modified model of \u03b2-cell AP generation where I(BK) and I(Kv) coordinate the AP repolarisation.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether specific genetic polymorphisms in ADRB1 (encoding the beta1-adrenergic receptor), CYP2D6, and UGT1A1 correlated with dose of, or response to, metoprolol or carvedilol treatment in patients with heart failure. A cohort of patients with heart failure (n = 93), characterized as responders or nonresponders to metoprolol (n = 19) or carvedilol (n = 74) therapy, was retrospectively identified. Individual genotyping was performed for a panel of polymorphisms in the ADRB1, CYP2D6, and UGT1A1 genes. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare the genotype to the metoprolol or carvedilol response status and dose. A nonresponse was identified in 10 of 19 patients taking metoprolol and 32 of 74 patients taking carvedilol. None of the polymorphisms in ADRB1, CYP2D6, and UGT1A1 were associated with a response or nonresponse. However, a significant relation between the carvedilol (but not metoprolol) dose and the ADRB1 and CYP2D6 genotype was observed. Patients homozygous for the ADRB1 389Gly variant or who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers achieved a significantly higher dose of carvedilol (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). In conclusion, polymorphisms in ADRB1, CYP2D6, and UGT1A1 were not associated with a response to metoprolol or carvedilol therapy in our cohort of patients with heart failure.

    "204": "Recent experiments to derive a thermally stable mutant of turkey beta-1-adrenergic receptor (beta1AR) have shown that a combination of six single point mutations resulted in a 20 degrees C increase in thermal stability in mutant beta1AR. Here we have used the all-atom force-field energy function to calculate a stability score to detect stabilizing point mutations in G-protein coupled receptors. The calculated stability score shows good correlation with the measured thermal stability for 76 single point mutations and 22 multiple mutants in beta1AR. We have demonstrated that conformational sampling of the receptor for various mutants improve the prediction of thermal stability by 50%. Point mutations Y227A5.58, V230A5.61, and F338M7.48 in the thermally stable mutant m23-beta1AR stabilizes key microdomains of the receptor in the inactive conformation. The Y227A5.58 and V230A5.61 mutations stabilize the ionic lock between R139(3.50) on transmembrane helix3 and E285(6.30) on transmembrane helix6. The mutation F338M7.48 on TM7 alters the interaction of the conserved motif NPxxY(x)5,6F with helix8 and hence modulates the interaction of TM2-TM7-helix8 microdomain. The D186-R317 salt bridge (in extracellular loops 2 and 3) is stabilized in the cyanopindolol-bound wild-type beta1AR, whereas the salt bridge between D184-R317 is preferred in the mutant m23. We propose that this could be the surrogate to a similar salt bridge found between the extracellular loop 2 and TM7 in beta2AR reported recently. We show that the binding energy difference between the inactive and active states is less in m23 compared to the wild-type, which explains the activation of m23 at higher norepinephrine concentration compared to the wild-type. Results from this work throw light into the mechanism behind stabilizing mutations. The computational scheme proposed in this work could be used to design stabilizing mutations for other G-protein coupled receptors.",

Despite current guidelines supporting the use of selective beta(1)-blockers in patients with CVD and especially in heart failure (HF), they are still largely underused, mostly as a consequence of the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In primary care, prevalence of COPD in patients with HF is approximately 25%, and it will rise in the next years. In the general population, only 20% of COPD patients with HF are treated with beta-blockers. beta-Blockers may result in pulmonary adverse effects that are relevant to COPD patients. Bronchoconstriction may be the consequence of: absence of cardioselectivity; loss of cardioselectivity at high doses, and unopposed stimulation of cholinergic muscarinic M(2) receptors. The concern of inducing bronchospasm is the more likely explanation of a poor prescription of beta-blockers in patients with CVD also suffering from COPD. However, under carefully controlled conditions, which include close monitoring of lung function and appropriate selection of the drug and titration of the dose on a case-by-case basis, selective beta(1)-blockers can be safely administered to most patients with COPD. Pneumologists and cardiologists should develop a detailed and standardized protocol to guide the use of selective beta(1)-blockers in everyday practice, which could significantly reduce the physicians' mistrust of beta-blockers in COPD patients."
