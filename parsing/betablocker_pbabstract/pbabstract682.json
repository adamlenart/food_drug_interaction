This drug-induced secretion is blocked by alpha-adrenergic (phenoxybenzamine, yohimbine; 10(-5) M) but not beta-adrenergic (propranolol, 10(-5) M) antagonism. Gel filtration (Sephadex G-50) reveals that beta-END-LI released from anterior lobe cells consists of 2 major forms of immunoreactivity which coelute with beta-lipotropin or beta-endorphin standards. Conversely, beta-END-LI released spontaneously from neurointermediate lobe cells almost entirely corresponds to beta-endorphin. The data show that alpha-adrenergic stimulation by clonidine releases beta-END-LI selectively from cells of anterior but not neurointermediate lobe in vitro and suggests that the clonidine-induced release of pituitary beta-END-LI we have observed in vivo occurs in part by direct action on the corticotrophs of the pars distalis.", 
    "1": "A fixed combination preparation consisting of a betablocker and diuretics was tested in 25 outpatients suffering from essential hypertension grades I and II (WHO). The raised blood pressures of the placebo phase fell highly significantly to normal values in th course of the 8 weeks' treatment. The ergometric load testing under standardized conditions showed a significant reduction of blood pressure increase, a significant rise in load capacity, and a decrease in the pressure rate product. Apart from the increase in serum acid in one case, no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory values were observed. Tolerance was good. The side effects mentioned by 10 patients were mild and did not influence the course of treatment. Patient compliance, measured twice in th course of the trial by means of urine fluorescence, was very high (95%).", 
    "2": "The maturing rat reticulocyte was used as a model system in which to study developmental changes in the protein components of hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase. Plasma membranes from rat erythrocytes display 10 to 20% of the adenylate cyclase activity and 30 to 50% of the beta-adrenergic receptors which are measured in membranes from rat reticulocytes, as noted by others. Reticulocyte membranes also display equal activities in response to (-)-isoproterenol in the presence of either GTP or GTP gamma S, whereas erythrocyte membrane adenylate cyclase is twice as active in the presence of isoproterenol plus GTP gamma S as in the presence of isoproterenol plus GTP. We have studied this system in greater detail by developing or applying independent assays for the catalytic protein (C) and the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G/F) of adenylate cyclase. C was assayed in membranes by its intrinsic Mn2+-stimulated activity. It was also measured by reconstituting membranes with saturating amounts of GTP gamma S-activated G/F, yielding an operationally defined Vmax for the catalyst. By either assay, reticulocytes display about 3-fold greater C activity than do erythrocytes. G/F was assayed by its ability to confer GTP gamma S-stimulated activity upon C (which was supplied by membranes of cyc- S49 lymphoma cells). This assay indicates that reticulocyte membranes contain about 3 times as much G/F as do erythrocyte membranes. Cholera toxin and [32P]NAD were used to [32P]ADP-ribosylate the 45,000- and 52,000-dalton subunits of G/F. Total incorporation of 32P into these subunits decreased 3- to 4-fold with reticulocyte maturation. The ratio of label in the 52,000-dalton peptide to that in the 45,000-dalton peptide decreased from 0.29 in reticulocyte membranes to 0.14 in erythrocyte membranes. The apparently coordinate decrease in the amounts of C, G/F, and beta-adrenergic receptors suggest that the stoichiometry between these components is maintained during maturation, and may account for the decrease in adenylate cyclase in the membranes. However, the qualitative changes in responsiveness to hormones in the presence of GTP or GTP gamma S may be related to loss or proteolysis of the 52,000-dalton subunit of G/F.", 
    "3": "To assess the incidence and severity of cardiac arrhythmias in the acute period following a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), 30 patients with a CVA in a stroke intensive care unit had 24 hours of dynamic ECG recordings. Twenty consecutive patients electively admitted for cataract surgery served as a control group and also had recordings. Fifteen (50%) of 30 CVA patients had serious ventricular ectopy, compared with only three (15%) of the 20 control subjects. Among the patients with CVA, two had ventricular tachycardia, two had complete atrioventricular block, and two had asystole, all occurring in CVAs involving the anterior circulation. None of the control subjects experienced these arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are common in patients with acute CVAs, especially those involving the anterior circulation. Dynamic ECG recordings may detect such arrhythmias and provide data for therapeutic consideration.", 
    "4": "In a recently published study, timolol lowered the overall mortality by 43% and the reinfarction rate by 37% during an average duration of treatment of 17 months after myocardial infarction. Although the timolol study is the best and most convincing of the post-infarction therapy studies yet presented, some important questions remain unanswered; in particular, the effect of other measures (eg the control of risk factors) is not clear. The future role of timolol will depend on further analysis of the study and on the definition of its significance as part of a comprehensive management plan of post-infarction patients.", 
    "5": "Number and affinity of beta-adrenoceptors in human polymorphonucleates (PMN's) have been studied in patients with essential hypertension (n = 12) and in normal subjects of the same range of age and sex (n = 16). (-)Diidroalprenolol-H3 has been utilized as ligand. Membranes preparation was performed according to Galant (5). Number of beta-adrenoceptor is significantly decreased compared with controls (p less than 0.05), both with saturation curves and Scatchard analysis. Affinity of beta-adrenoceptors toward (-)diidroalprenolol-H3 is lightly increased but not significantly. These data could be explained on the basis of the desensitization occurring in hypertensive subjects by altered plasma catecholamines level, as in experimental in vitro systems.", 
    "6": "On 9 patients with acute myocardial infarction the influence of talinolol (cordanum) on haemodynamic parameters in intravenous administration and after this in oral application was examined. Talinolol led to a slight decrease of the heart rate, of the arterial blood pressure and of the cardiac output as well as to a more distinct reduction of the contractility in nearly uninfluenced left-ventricular filling pressure. In comparison to a conventionally treated control group (n = 11) the decrease of the heart rate as well as of the contractility was somewhat more distinct. The changes found are to be explained in the sense of a heart exoneration. In one patient possibly by talinolol a deterioration of the pumping function developed 56 hours after the acute event. In another patient a depressive effect on the sinus node is not to be excluded. Ventricular fibrillation and disturbances of the atrioventricular conduction did not appear in contrast to the control group. The influence on supraventricular and ventricular cardiac dysrhythmias was distinctly favourable in other 9 patients with acute myocardial infarction despite clinical signs of cardiac decompensation. Only in one patient a further deterioration of the pumping function developed despite control of the disturbance of rhythm. According to the experimental and up to now existing clinical experiences beta-receptor blockers are indicated above all in the early phase of the acute myocardial infarction, if shock, acute heart insufficiency and bradycardiac disturbances of the heart rhythm are not existing. Here paticularly at the beginning of the therapy is a proved change in the first 2-4(-8) hours to prevent the expansion of the infarct size or the onset of large infarctions.", 
    "7": "In these studies we have characterized differences between spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar/Kyoto (WKY) rats with respect to rates of neuronal uptake of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA), and beta-adrenergic receptor (dihydroalprenolol; [3H]DHA) binding in the central nervous system. We find that SHR have greater rates of NE uptake in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus and pons-medulla during early development, and that these changes are accounted for, at least in the cerebral cortex, by an increased Vmax of the NE uptake mechanism. In addition, we find a decrease in the Bmax for [3H]DHA binding, suggestive of down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors of this region. In contrast to the results for NE uptake, we have measured significant decreases in DA uptake in the frontal cortex of the SHR at several postnatal ages. Decreases in DA uptake were also observed in the striatum of SHR although these changes were found only in animals approximately 6 weeks of age. From these results we have suggested that NE neurons projecting to a number of brain regions have elevated functional activity, while more regionally selective decreases in dopaminergic functional activity are characteristic of the SHR. We have further proposed that these changes in catecholamine neurons of the central nervous system may play an important role in the development of both the hypertension and behavioral hyperactivity exhibited by these animals.", 
    "8": "Participants in the Medical Research Council treatment trial for mild hypertension are randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups: bendrofluazide, propranolol, or a placebo for either of these drugs. The trial is single-blind. 23 582 patient-years of observation have been completed so far, 10 684 on active drugs and 12 898 on placebos. The results show an association between bendrofluazide treatment and impotence, and impotence also occurred more frequently in patients taking propranolol than in those taking placebos. Other adverse reactions significantly linked with active drugs include impaired glucose tolerance in men and women and gout in men, associated with bendrofluazide treatment, and Raynaud's phenomenon and dyspnoea in men and women taking propranolol. No corneal disease is known to have occurred in the propranolol group. Mean serum potassium level fell, and urea and uric acid levels rose, in men and women taking bendrofluazide. In the propranolol group, serum potassium and uric acid levels rose in both sexes, but the urea level rose significantly in women only.", 
    "9": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of the alpha,beta-adrenoceptor blocker 5-(1-hydroxy-2-[2-(o-methoxyphenoxy)ethylamino]ethyl]-2-methyl-benzenesulphonamide hydrochloride (YM-09538) in plasma, using 5-di-n-butylaminonaphthalene-1-sulphonyl chloride as a reagent for fluorescence labelling is described. The detection limit is 20 ng/ml, which is sensitive enough to determine YM-09538 plasma levels after the oral administration of effective doses to dogs and human.", 
    "10": "An attempt was made to antagonize the stimulatory effect of ATP on insulin secretion from the isolated perfused rat pancreas. The insulin secretory effect of ATP does not seem to be mediated by cholinergic or beta-adrenergic receptors since neither atropine 0.3 micro mol/1 nor propranolol 1 micro mol/1 had any antagonistic action on insulin secretion induced by ATP (16.5 micro mol/1). Theophylline (50 micro mol/1) did not antagonize the insulin secretion evoked by ATP (16.5 micro mol/1). Apamin (10 nmol/1) was also without antagonistic action. 2-2'Pyridylisatogen tosylate (5 micro mol/1) had not effect on insulin secretion induced by glucose )8.33 mmol/1) or acetylcholine (0.5 micro mol/1 and 0.1 micro mol/1) but inhibited the insulin secretory effect of ATP (16.5 micro mol/1). Thus, the antagonism of 2-2'pyridylisatogen for ATP seems selective. We conclude that a purinoceptor of the P2-type is likely to be present on the B-cell of the rat pancreas.", 
    "11": "Trimazosin, a quinazoline related to the antihypertensive agent prazosin, was studied in anesthetized animals and isolated tissue preparations for effects related to cardiovascular activity. In cats, there was no evidence for ganglion-, adrenergic neurons-, or beta -adrenoceptor blockade, but the pressor effect of epinephrine was reversed. In dogs, the hypotensive effect to trimazosin was due to selective blockade of vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Trimazosin competitively antagonized norepinephrine-induced contraction of rabbit aorta, and in rabbit pulmonary artery it selectively blocked postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptors. In spinal-pithed dogs and rats trimazosin lowered blood pressure, in contrast to the lack of such activity reported for prazosin in pithed rats. It is concluded that trimazosin lowers blood pressure by selective blockade of alpha 1-adrenoceptors, and has, in addition, a hypotensive effect in pithed animals which is not due to alpha -adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "12": "Vasopressin, phenylephrine, and A23187 cause an accumulation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in hepatocytes from fed rats, but not in Ca2+-depleted hepatocytes from fed rats or in phosphorylase kinase-deficient hepatocytes from (gsd/gsd) rats. The effect of vasopressin and phenylephrine is not found in hepatocytes from overnight-starved rats. Thus, the accumulation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate by these agents may depend on the stimulation of glycogenolysis and on the resulting accumulation of hexose 6-phosphate. In support of this hypothesis, conditions are described for the enzymatic synthesis of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate from fructose 6-phosphate and Mg-ATP in liver extracts. Half-maximal activity (0.8 nmol/min.g) is obtained with about 60 microM fructose 6-phosphate, and the activity can be separated fom phosphofructokinase by ammonium sulfate fractionation. Treatment of rats or isolated hepatocytes with glucagon results in a 4-5-fold decrease in the maximal activity of this enzyme.", 
    "13": "The combination of prazosin (3-21 mg/day) and oxprenolol (60-360 mg/day) was used to treat 25 pregnant women with severe essential hypertension and 19 women with the hypertension-oedema-proteinuria syndrome. In the group with essential hypertension control of blood pressure was sufficient to avoid addition of hydralazine infusions in all but one patient. No patient developed late proteinuria and exacerbation of hypertension once control was established using this regimen. The birthweights of 58 percent of infants were above the 50th percentile of birthweights for the same ages of gestation in normal pregnancies; two intrauterine deaths occurred. In the hypertension-oedema-proteinuria group, blood pressure control was more difficult to sustain, necessitating additional hydralazine infusions in 11 patients. Pregnancy had to be terminated urgently because of progression of the disorder in 13 patients. There were three intrauterine deaths in this series and one infant was lost eight hours after delivery at 27 weeks following five weeks of antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "14": "The 125I-labeled iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (IHYP) binding to beta-receptors on brain micro-vessels is inhibited by isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine, with Ki values of 2 X 10(-7) M, 2.5 X 10(-6) M and 1.2 X 10(-5) M, respectively. A modified Scatchard analysis of the inhibitory effects of practolol, metroprolol and zinterol on IHYP binding has shown that the proportion of beta 2-receptors in our preparation is about 80% of the total beta-adrenergic receptor population. Our data indicate that the beta-adrenergic receptors located on cerebral microvessels are of both beta 1 and beta 2 types, with a predominance of the beta 2 type.", 
    "15": "Since a high risk of coronary heart disease is associated with high serum total cholesterol levels and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, the effects of labetalol (Trandate; Allen & Hanburys) and oxprenolol (Trasicor; Ciba-Geigy) on blood lipids were studied. Eight normal volunteers, mean age 25,8 years, were involved in a randomized cross-over trial; all received each of the drugs for a 3-week period, separated by a wash-out period of 1 week. Both labetalol and oxprenolol reduced total serum cholesterol levels; these changes are statistically highly significant; Since the drugs had no significant effect on HDL cholesterol levels, the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol was significantly decreased. Changes in triglyceride levels after both labetalol and oxprenolol administration were slight and did not reach statistical significance. The alpha-blockade caused by labetalol does no materially affect changes in blood lipid values brought about by beta-blockade. This study does not support previous reports, which have directed attention towards the possibility that, owing to alterations in lipid transport, adrenergic blocking agents might accelerate atherogenesis.", 
    "16": "The antihypertensive effect of propranolol, in fixed combinations with two dosages of triamteren and hydrochlorothiazide (Dociteren), was evaluated in a double-blind test on 19 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. No significant differences between the two dosages were found with respect to heart rate, as well as systolic and diastolic pressures on lying and standing up. Mean systolic and diastolic pressures were within the normotensive range with both dosages after four weeks. Increasing the diuretic component increased the type and frequency of side effects, without any additional therapeutic advantage. In seven of nine patients the previously present signs of left ventricular hypertrophy disappeared. In 9 patients the mean value of the Sokolow-Lyon index (RV5 + SV1) decreased from 4.078 mV before to 3.31 mV after an eight-week period of treatment. The results of various laboratory tests, except for a transient hyperuricaemia, did not change significantly.", 
    "17": "In an acute trial on the bicycle ergometer, the beta-receptor blocker atenolol in single morning doses of 50 mg produced a significant reduction in blood pressure, heart rate and ischaemic changes in the ECG. Parallel to this there was an increase in the load resistance of the patients. The majority of the parameters show no further changes at double the dosage. In the chronic trial with treatment periods of four weeks each, the substance is distinctly superior to placebo with regard to the frequency of angina.", 
    "18": "Treatment of female mice with testosterone propionate led to a pronounced, but gradual increase in kidney beta-adrenergic receptor complement. The specific binding of [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol rose 2-3-fold above the control levels after 8-12 days of the treatment. No significant changes were detected prior to the fourth day of androgen administration. No gross changes in either the binding strength or cooperativity of the binding were apparent in membrane preparations from treated animals. Averages of the high-affinity binding constant estimates were 1.3 +/- 0.3 nmol in controls, vs. 1.6 +/- 0.5 nmol in treated animals (15 groups each) in competition with pindolol, with the Hill slope factors of 0.98 +/- 0.08 for controls, and 0.91 +/- 0.07 for the treated animal membrane preparations. Scatchard estimates of the binding constants in self-competed [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol binding were about 160 pmol in both control and treated animals. Competition experiments using isoproterenol also indicated similar dissociation constants (151 +/- 16 nmol) for control and treated groups. Na+/K+-activated ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) was also found to be increased at the 12th day of the androgen treatment (to 74% above control levels).", 
    "19": "The amplitude of temporal artery pulsation was monitored at rest, after standing from the sitting position and after exercise in 23 normal controls, 10 patients subject to chronic tension headache and 107 migrainous patients. The pulses of migrainous patients did not differ from normal at rest or on standing. On exercise, the temporal artery on the habitually affected side of migrainous patients dilated more than the headache-free-side, while exercise-induced changes in tension headache patients were less than those in normal controls. The responses were not influenced by previous or current medication.", 
    "20": "The electromyograms of canine external urethral sphincter were recorded and analysed with microcomputer ATAC 450 (Nihon Koden Co.). Its electromyographic responses to the alpha-blocker (phentolamine) and beta-blocker (propranolol) were not recognized, although, the action potentials of the external sphincter disappeared by administration of suxamethonium and pancuronium. The opinions that alpha-adrenergic system acts dominantly on the external urethral sphincter can not be supported by our data obtained from this study.", 
    "21": "Eight patients with typical Prinzmetal's angina and angiography proven coronary artery spasm are reviewed. In all cases the angina pain appeared at rest and was accompanied by a simultaneous ST-segment elevation. The coronary angiography results varied from severe multivessel disease (3 cases) to single vessel disease (3 cases), and normal coronary arteries (2 cases). In all patients a coronary spasm was documented, in five cases induced by ergonovine and in three spontaneously; in all patients but in one, the localization of the spasm was concordant with the ST-segment elevation localization. One case with a severe proximal left anterior descending stenosis was grafted; however the pain was not relieved despite treatment with large amounts of propranolol. This patient died after an episode of severe chest pain. Treatment with nifedipine was given to six patients, with excellent results in four cases, and regular response in two. The main physiopathologic diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of the variant angina syndrome are reviewed.", 
    "22": "In experiments performed on male Wistar rats in was shown that i.v.c. administered homovanillic acid (HVA) in a dose of 50 micrograms exerted an inhibitory effect on the locomotor activity. In this dose HVA potentiated also the cataleptogenic effect of haloperidol and amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity. On the other hand, the higher dose HVA (200 micrograms) increased locomotor activity, potentiated amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity, but antagonized apomorphine-induced stereotypy. HVA in a dose of 50 micrograms enhanced the turnover of dopamine, and in a dose of 200 micrograms the turnover of noradrenaline in rat brain. The obtained results indicate that the effects of HVA on animal behaviour are connected with its action on catecholaminergic systems in the brain, especially on the dopaminergic receptors. The inhibitory effect of small dose of HVA appears to be presynaptic and the stimulatory effect of a high dose of HVA seems to be postsynaptic. Moreover, the experiments with a high dose of HVA suggest that it may act in the central nervous system either by altering the distribution of endogenous monoamines or by mimicking the action of monoamines on specific synaptic receptors.", 
    "23": "The effect of concurrent administration of antacids on the relative bioavailability of sotalol has been examined in five healthy volunteers. Each subject received an oral 160 mg dose after an overnight fast in four different experimental schedules. Venous blood samples were drawn 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 24, and 32 hours after the drug administration, and sotalol concentrations were determined fluorometrically. The results show that concurrent administration of calcium carbonate or aluminum hydroxide with sotalol has negligible pharmacokinetic consequences. The adsorption of sotalol onto magnesium hydroxide leads to somewhat decreased bioavailability but in long term use the phenomenon is not likely to be of clinical importance.", 
    "24": "The selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol is eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism and usually less than 5% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. The effects of impaired liver function on the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol were studied in 10 patients with hepatic cirrhosis. All subjects were given single doses of 20mg intravenously and 50mg orally on separate days. The mean fraction of the drug available systematically was 84 +/- 10% in patients and 50 +/- 11% in a control group of 6 healthy subjects (p less than 0.05). The total body clearance of metoprolol in the cirrhotics was 0.61 +/- 0.13L/min and in the controls 0.80 +/- 0.11L/min. These values correspond to elimination half-lives of 7.2 +/- 1.2 and 4.2 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The differences were not statistically significant. Impaired liver function had no effect on the volume of distribution of metoprolol. Total clearance was weakly but linearly related to galactose clearance (r2 = 0.52; p less than 0.05), and the half-life was related to serum bilirubin (r2 = 0.74; p less than 0.01).", 
    "25": "The binding of the basic drugs quinidine, propranolol and amitriptyline, the neutral drug digitoxin and the acidic drug phenytoin to heparinised normal plasma, to orosomucoid (alpha 1-acid glycoprotein)-deficient plasma and to purified orosomucoid and albumin was studied in both the presence and absence of tris (2-butoxyethyl)-phosphate (TBEP) and de-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP). The addition of TBEP and DEHP to heparinised plasma in concentrations up to 2.5 mmol/L markedly increased the unbound fractions of quinidine and propranolol, but the increase was less for amitiriptyline, TBEP being the most potent displacer. In orosomucoid-deficient plasma, which was prepared by immunoprecipitation, the free fraction of quinidine was similar to that of normal plasma in which maximal displacement with TBEP was obtained. The addition of the displacers to orosomucoid-deficient plasma caused no further reduction in the binding, nor was the plasma binding of digitoxin and phenytoin significantly affected. When combining purified albumin and orosomucoid in concentrations found in normal plasma, quinidine binding approached that of heparinised normal plasma. This study confirms the dominant role of orosomucoid in the variable plasma binding of basic drugs, and underlines the value of using immunologically prepared orosomucoid-deficient plasma and TBEP or DEHP as model displacers.", 
    "26": "Twelve paired samples of breast milk and blood were obtained, between the 2nd and 5th days after she had given birth, from a 30-year-old woman who was a 8-hourly propranolol (20 mg) and mexiletine (200 mg). Propranolol was detected in 9 of the samples of blood and in only 4 of the milk samples. Mexiletine was measurable in all samples, and the milk : plasma ratio varied between 0.79 and 1.89 with a mean of 1.45. However, the large volume of distribution of mexiletine makes it unlikely that the small dose of the drug received from the milk would be detrimental to the health of infants.", 
    "27": "In the isolated rat atria the effects of phenylephrine (alpha-agonist) and isoproterenol (beta-agonist) on the contractile force and heart rate were studied either in presence or not of alpha- and/or beta-blockade. Phentolamine 10(-6) M and propranolol 10(-8) M were used as alpha- and beta-antagonists, respectively. The chronotropic dose-response curves were made in both spontaneously beating atria while inotropic effects were derived from left atria driven at 1 Hz, 5 msec and voltage about 20 percent above threshold. Both agonists induced an inotropic effect that could be significantly blocked by phentolamine, propranolol and both antagonists given together. The chronotropic dose-response curve of isoproterenol (pD2 = 10.70 +/- 0.11) was blocked by phentolamine (pD2 = 9.27 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.001) and propranolol (pD2 = 9.21 +/- 0.19, p less than 0.001). Contrarily, pentolamine was unable to shift to the right the chronotropic dose-response curve for phenylephrine (pD2 = 6.48 +/- 0.07 and 6.63 +/- 0.10, respectively). This action of phenylephrine on the heart rate was significantly blocked by propranolol (pD2 = 6.21 +/- 0.13, p less than 0.05) and by propranolol plus phentolamine (pD2 = 6.07 +/- 0.04, p less than 0.001). From the present results it is concluded that in the rat's atrial myocardium there exist alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol and phenylephrine. Yet, the chronotropic action seems to behave in a different way: while isoproterenol triggered either type of receptors; phenylephrine is only mediated by beta-adrenoceptors.U", 
    "28": "To examine the relative importance of 1) reduced blood viscosity, 2) vasodilation mediated through beta-adrenergic receptors, and 3) sympathetic nerve activity on the regulation of limb blood flow during anemia, norepinephrine (NE) was infused in 10 anesthetized-paralyzed dogs at normal and reduced hematocrit (Hct). Cardiac output (QT), limb and total oxygen uptake (VO2)n and limb venous flow (QL) were determined. After a control period, NE (2 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1) was infused followed by another control period. The Hct was then reduced to 9% by isovolemic hemodilution with dextran, and data were obtained during anemia, anemia plus NE, and after isovolemic reinfusion of red blood cells (Hct 25%) during NE. Another 10 dogs were treated identically after propranolol (1.0 mg/kg) administration. At normal Hct, NE increased limb resistance (RL) (P less than 0.01) in the beta-block group; a decrease in RL (P less than 0.05) and a rise in QL (P less than 0.01) occurred in the no block group. QL and VO2 (limb and total) were not changed by NE. During anemia, RL was not altered in either group by NE; QT fell (P less than 0.05) in both, and QL decreased in the no block group. After reinfusion of cells, NE produced an increase in RL and total peripheral resistance (P less than 0.01) and a fall in QL (P less than 0.01) and QT (P less than 0.01) in both groups; limb and total VO2 rose in the no block group. We conclude that the reduction in viscosity prevented an increase in both RL and redistribution of QL during severe anemia (Hct 9%).", 
    "29": "Ventricular arrhythmias due to myocardial infarct were produced in 14 dogs, and the antiarrhytmic effects of quinidine (Qd), lidocaine (Lid), aprindine (Apr), and dl-propranolol (dl-Prop) were investigated. While recording the blood pressure and lead II ECG, a coronary cannula was inserted into a coronary orifice via the left carotid artery and a glass bead (diameter, 1.5 mm) was flushed into the left coronary artery. Beads were found at the descending branches in 12 and circumflex branches in 2 out of 14 gods, at autopsy. Using a telemetry system to record the lead II ECG of conscious, non-restricted dogs, the antiarrhythmic effects of Qd, Lid, Apr, and dl-Prop on ventricular arrhythmias 24 hours after coronary occlusion were compared. Apr and dl-Prop were about three times more potent than Qd and Lid. Although the durations of the antiarrhythmic effects of Apr, Lid, and dl-Prop were 20 to 30 min, that of Qd lasted longer. Since stable ventricular arrhythmias can be obtained by surgical intervention and the antiarrhythmic effects of standard compounds with glass beads can be used to study antiarrhythmic effects.", 
    "30": "The effects of chronic twice daily s.c. injections of dlpropranolol, metoprolol and d-propranolol on systolic blood pressure and heart rate were assessed in conscious DOC-saline hypertensive rats. Measurements were taken (tail-cuff) 4 hr after the morning injection and 16-18 hr after the afternoon injection during 11 of 19 consecutive treatment days. Only dl-propranolol and metoprolol at 5 mg/kg lowered blood pressure and heart rate significantly relative to the changes occurring in control saline-injected animals. At the lower dose of 0.2 mg/kg, both agents tended to decrease heart rate while having little or no effect on blood pressure. The overall blood pressure and heart rate changes produced by propranolol at 5 mg/kg differed significantly from those of the control group at both the 4 and 16-18 hr post-dosing intervals. Metoprolol at 5 mg/kg produced significant overall changes in blood pressure and heart rate only at the 4 hr post-doing interval. D-propranolol had no effect on either blood pressure or heart rate. The results indicate tha s.c. propranolol and metoprolol lower systolic blood pressure in conscious DOC-saline hypertensive rats only at the higher dose of 5 mg/kg and that cardioselectivity does not afford increased antihypertensive activity in this model.",

The action of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) on the electrical and mechanical activity of strips of longitudinal myometrial smooth muscle from rabbits and guinea-pigs treated with oestradiol was studied in the sucrose-gap apparatus. 2. In myometrial strips which spontaneously exhibited regular contractions, or which were induced to contract rhythmically to the application of oxytocin, VIP reduced both the frequency and the force of contraction. 3. Contractions were associated with bursts of action potential discharge. In guinea-pig, the membrane potential reached its most negative value shortly following a burst and a slow decay of negativity followed (\"generator potential'). VIP inhibited the decay of this negativity and increased the duration of the period between bursts. In rabbit myometrical strips, electrical discharges occurred less regularly but VIP also had an inhibitory action. The inhibitory action of VIP was not affected by the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol, by tetrodotoxin, or by apamin. 4. Using the double sucrose-gap apparatus, bursts of action potentials and contractions were elicited with depolarizing electrical pulses in the absence of oxytocin. Changes in membrane resistance were also estimated by eliciting hyperpolarizing electrotronic potentials. VIP hyperpolarized the membrane and inhibited contractions as depolarizing pulses now failed to reach threshold for action potential discharge or fewer action potentials were discharged. A small (about 10%) reduction in membrane resistance was freqeuently observed during the hyperpolarization. 5. If a single action potential was elicited in the presence of VIP, the tension generated by the muscle was less than in its absence. 6. In a calcium-free high-potassium (126 mM) solution, readmitting calcium produced contraction; VIP inhibited this contraction. Activation of beta-receptors by means of isoprenaline had a similar effect but unlike isoprenaline the action of VIP was not blocked by propranolol. 7. It is suggested that the primary action of VIP is on the calcium economy of the myometrial smooth muscle cell, possibly to accelerate sequestration and/or extrusion of calcium from the cell. In some way this is associated with inhibition of the generator potential, hyperpolarization, and with a small increase in permeability of the membrane to potassium.", 
    "32": "The acute effects of various drugs on the release of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in goats were studied by local infusions in vivo. Infusions of Ca2+ or Sr2+ reduced the PTH secretion rate, whereas hypocalcemia induced by EDTA increased the PTH release. Blockers of voltage sensitive Ca2+ channels (verapamil, D-600 and nifedipine) lowered the PTH secretion rate, while infusion of 4-aminopyridine, which is a blocker of voltage sensitive K+ channels, increased the PTH release. These effects were not due to altered beta-adrenergic tonus, since the effects persisted when the drugs were administered during continuous infusion of the beta-blocker propranolol. We suggest that the parathyroid cells possess voltage sensitive K+ and Ca2+ channels, and that exocytosis of stored PTH depends on the influx of extracellular Ca2+ as in other secretory cells. In order to explain the inverse relationship between the plasma Ca2+ level and the PTH release, we postulate a suppressive effect of the plasma Ca2+ on the membrane permeability to Ca2+ in parathyroid cells.", 
    "33": "Tetrapolar chest rheography was used to study the blood circulation in healthy males and in patients with hypertensive disease of the I-II stage during mental activity and under conditions of emotional stress; 15 patients were given 40 mg anapriline 80-90 min before the examination. A progressing increase in the peripheral resistance was characteristic for all the patients with hypertensive disease in the rehabilitation period after emotional stress. Hemodynamic reaction to the emotional stress in the presence of beta-receptor block is characterized by an intensive growth of the peripheral resistance. Beta-blockers inhibit and shorten the hypertensive reaction during the rehabilitation period.", 
    "34": "The great extramural coronary stem arteries (as well as extramural collaterals and anastomoses) deserve particular interest with respect to their peculiar susceptibility to autonomic neurotransmitters and drugs. Obviously these arteries, preferentially affected by atherosclerotic processes, are most responsive to such vasodilators which block vascular tone and contractility by interference with Ca-dependent excitation-contraction coupling. This applies first of all to the new pharmacological family of Ca-antagonists but also to the classical nitrites. As we have emphasized in 1971. Ca-antagonism is a new principle of coronary vascular dilation with profound clinical implications (5). In fact, the Ca-antagonists have become, within a few years, the drugs of choice for the treatment of all spastic forms of angina. By contrast adenosine, dipyridamole, chromonar and theophylline preferably dilate the small intramural resistance vessels, but do not significantly reflex the extramural stem arteries. Therefore, in coronary heart disease, the latter drugs do usually not produce major circulatory improvement.", 
    "35": "Collateral vessels from dogs showed good mechanical responses, with well-developed inhibitory responses, for example to noradrenaline. Endogenous inhibitory processes, which resulted in a low spontaneous basal tone, were also well-developed in most tissues. However, signs of hyperactivity were observed in some cases - and this might be the most interesting result. This hyperactivity was characterized by a strong phasic spontaneous activity. This might be an abnormality associated with the rapid proliferation of smooth muscle cells in collateral vessels. It is quite possible that such states of hyperactivity may play a role in human pathology, Producing coronary spasm and leading to angina or infarction, perhaps even in hearts with well developed collaterals.", 
    "36": "Delayed postischemic brain hypoperfusion and hypermetabolism are likely detrimental factors to neurologic recovery after transient global brain ischemia and may be mediated by catecholamines acting via adrenergic receptors. We evaluated the effects of alpha and beta receptor blockade on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism after 16 min transient global brain ischemia. Ischemia was induced by arterial hypotension and a high pressure neck tourniquet in 13 anesthetized cats. Six cats were untreated, 4 received propranolol 1 mg/kg, IV and 3 a combination of propranolol and phentolamine, one mg/kg injected one min before recirculation. Total CBF was measured by continuous monitoring of cerebral venous 133Xe clearance after bolus intra-arterial injection. Arterial and cerebral venous oxygen, glucose and lactate were measured. Cerebral cortex glucose and lactate were measured 3 hours post-ischemia after in situ freezing with liquid N2. The cerebral cortex of 3 cats anesthetized, but not subjected to ischemia, was similarly frozen and analyzed for glucose and lactate. Total CBF was relatively constant for up to 3 h post-ischemia in all groups, but significant changes in fast and slow-flow rates and compartment sizes were observed. In untreated cats, the normal 60/40 percent relative weight of the fast and slow-flow compartments was reversed to 30/70 percent by 1 hr post-ischemia. Propranolol attenuated the size of the fast-flow compartment in the first 30 min post-ischemia which was partially restored by phentolamine. Brain oxygen consumption increased 2 to 3-fold by 1 h post-ischemia in all groups. Propranolol compromised CBF and impaired glucose and lactate oxidation which was partly reversed by phentolamine. We concluded that within the first 30 min post-ischemia, beta, and to a lesser extent, alpha receptors predominate in the modulation of cerebrovascular tone. By 1 h post-ischemia, however, adrenergic modulation of cerebrovascular tone is lost. Delayed post-ischemic hypermetabolism unlike stress-induced, but like hypoxia-induced hypermetabolism is only partially affected by beta blockade. Propranolol apparently compromises brain oxygen consumption secondary to a reduction in brain O2 supply while phentolamine improves perfusion and oxygen consumption.", 
    "37": "A comparative study of the intraocular pressure-lowering effects of timolol and phospholine iodide in cases of aphakic glaucoma was carried out. The authors compared the I.O.P.-lowering effect of these two drugs in 30 eyes (30 patients) with aphakic glaucoma over an eight-month observation period. The following was established after a statistical analysis of the material: 1. The I.O.P.-lowering effect of timolol in aphakic glaucoma cases is almost identical with the effect of the drug in cases of chronic open-angle glaucoma. 2. The administration of phospholine iodide in such cases leads to a stable I.O.P. regulation and it seems that this therapy should be preferred to treatment with timolol. 3. Timolol therapy in cases of aphakic glaucoma should be considered an enrichment of the known treatment methods. 4. The administration of timolol requires constant follow-up and if this is not possible therapy with pilocarpine or phospholine iodide should be preferred.", 
    "38": "The influence of antihypertensive therapy on plasma norepinephrine (NE) was examined in 58 patients with moderate chronic renal failure (CRF). Six normotensive patients not receiving antihypertensive medicines (mean serum creatinine 2.4 +/-.2 mg/dl) had a modest but significant increase in NE compared to normals in both supine (230 vs. 173 pg/ml, P greater than .05) and upright (482 vs. 377 pg/ml, P less than .05) positions. A striking increase in NE (supine 673 +/- 55, P less than .001; upright 1089 +/- 88 pg/ml, P less than .001) was observed in 34 CRF patients receiving antihypertensive regimens containing diuretic, beta-blocker, or vasodilator drugs either individually or in combination. Vasodilator therapy was associated with the highest levels of NE. In 17 further CRF patients receiving the sympathetic suppressants clonidine or methyldopa in addition to other medicines, NE values were similar to untreated, normotensive patients (supine NE 254 +/- 40 pg/ml; upright NE 474 +/- 61 pg/ml). The age, degree of renal impairment, plasma renin activity, and number and dosage of antihypertensive medicines did not account for these differences in NE. The results suggests that NE levels are modestly increased in normotensive, untreated CRF patients, but are dramatically increased by antihypertensive therapy, particularly vasodilator therapy. Clonidine or methyldopa therapy, however, is associated with significantly lower NE values in these patients despite the concomitant use of vasodilator agents.", 
    "39": "Thirty-two patients with raised intraocular pressure were treated for 1 year with topical timolol 0.5% twice daily. There was satisfactory pressure reduction on this drug alone in 25 patients. The tear flow (modified Schirmer I test) was measured, and the tear lysozyme concentration was assayed before, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after beginning treatment. No subjective symptoms occurred and no side effects were recorded. The tear flow and tear lysozyme concentration were not significantly reduced.", 
    "40": "1 The rates of noradrenaline spillover to, and removal from, plasma were measured in ten patients with essential hypertension treated with propranolol, to ascertain if long-term administration of this drug reduces sympathetic nervous system tone. 2 The plasma clearance of noradrenaline fell with propranolol, leading to a small rise in the mean plasma noradrenaline concentration. Sympathetic nervous activity in treated patients cannot be reliably gauged from plasma noradrenaline values because these are distorted by the reduction in noradrenaline clearance. 3 There was no consistent effect on noradrenaline spillover rates, which fell in six patients, but rose in the remaining four. The magnitude of the antihypertensive response was unrelated to these changes in noradrenaline release. During propranolol treatment, noradrenaline spillover rates were in every case within the normal range, much higher than in patients treated with the known sympathetic nervous systems suppressant, clonidine. 4 The principal mode of antihypertensive action of propranolol is something often than central suppression of sympathetic tone or pre-synaptic inhibition of noradrenaline release.", 
    "41": "1 Nine hypertensive patients received by mouth daily doses of 400 mg of acebutolol and then, after a 2 week washout period, 80 mg of propranolol for 2 week periods in an open study. 2 Both treatments caused equivalent cardiac blockade as assessed by reduction in exercise tachycardia. 3 Both treatments lowered blood pressure, although this effect on pressure was better maintained in the case of acebutolol. 4 Forearm blood flow, at rest, was significantly reduced at 2 h after dosing with propranolol, but not after acebutolol. 5 This difference between the two drugs is probably due to the cardioselectivity of orally administered acebutolol in man.", 
    "42": "1 In a single blind study seventeen patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension and normal renal function were treated with labetalol alone in increasing doses from 300 via 600 to 1200 mg daily. 2 Average supine BP (systolic/diastolic) was reduced by 24/19 mm Hg. Seven patients attained a diastolic BP less than or equal to Hg. A significant postural fall in systolic BP was recorded, but no symptomatic orthostatic hypotension occurred. 3 In twelve patients measurements of plasma volume (125I-albumin), extracellular volume (82Br-space) and glomerular filtration rate (51Cr-EDTA clearance) on placebo and subsequently labetalol showed no systemic changes. 4 Side effects were few causing two withdrawals because of impotence and arthralgia. 5 It is concluded that monotherapy with labetalol results in clinically relevant, persistent and dose dependent reduction in BP in patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension, apparently without concomitant expansion of body fluid volumes or influence on glomerular filtration rate.", 
    "43": "1 Seven women with hypertension of pregnancy were given the combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug labetalol (50 mg i.v.) in their last trimester. Acute effects were studied for 3 h after administration. 2 Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced from 143 +/- 4 (s.e. mean) to 127 +/- 5 mmHg and from 101 +/- 2 to 88 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively. Maternal heart rate fell significantly from 77 +/- 5 to 68 +/- 3 beats/min. The changes remained during the 3 h of observation. Foetal heart rate was not affected. No side-effects were encountered. 3 Plasma noradrenaline increased significantly from 1.54 +/- 0.16 to a peak value of 2.37 +/- 0.41 nmol/l suggesting sympathetic activation following labetalol. Plasma adrenaline levels were essentially unchanged. Plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide showed only minor changes. No major effects on lipid metabolism were seen except a significant fall of nonesterified fatty acids at 60 min. Plasma cyclic AMP increased significantly throughout the observation period, perhaps indicating beta-adrenoceptor agonist activity of labetalol. 4 The effectiveness of labetalol as an acute hypertensive agent together with apparent absence of metabolic disturbances and other side-effects makes it an interesting drug for the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy.", 
    "44": "1 The effect of a single oral dose of labetalol (100 mg), propranolol (80 mg) and placebo on the pressor response to sexual autostimulation has been studied in six female volunteers. 2 Labetalol but not propranolol significantly reduced the increase in blood pressure that occurred at orgasm. 3 The subjective features of the sexual response were assessed by each subject using visual analogue scales. 4 Subjects reported a significant reduction in vaginal lubrication with labetalol compared to both placebo and propranolol. 5 No other effects were noted.", 
    "45": "We studied aqueous humor dynamics in a group of 21 human subjects, each of whom had third neuron Horner's syndrome in one eye and a normal fellow eye. The diagnosis had been made at least four months before this study began. We estimated the degree of involvement with Lowenstein-Loewenfeld pupillography with and without hydroxyamphetamine. Surprisingly, aqueous humor dynamics were normal in the eyes with Horner's syndrome. The mean intraocular pressure was 1 mm Hg less than that of the normal eyes. Aqueous humor flow and tonographic facility of outflow were normal, as was the response to the beta-blocker timolol. However, the response of the eyes with Horner's syndrome to epinephrine was abnormal. The normal eyes showed an increase in aqueous humor flow after epinephrine administration and the eyes with Horner's syndrome showed a decrease.", 
    "46": "With few exceptions, weakly basic compounds that are sufficiently lipophilic in their neutral forms and sufficiently hydrophilic in their protonated forms accumulate in lysosomes. When the concentration within the lysosomes becomes sufficiently high, osmotic swelling occurs. The cells than take on a vacuolated appearance. The concentrations at which different weak bases cause lysosomal vacuolation vary over almost three orders of magnitude. For any particular weak base, it is the concentration of the neutral form that determines the extent of uptake and the degree of vacuolation. Chloroquine is anomalous in that concentrations greater than approximately 30 microM cause less uptake and less vacuolation than do lower concentrations.", 
    "47": "The onset of electromechanical dissociation during acute cardiac tamponade in mongrel dogs is significantly prolonged by either surgical or pharmacologic sympathectomy. Bilateral vagotomy does not have any apparent effect on the initiation of electromechanical dissociation. Pretreatment with isoproterenol just prior to tamponade does not significantly increase heart rate or the double product. Cardiopulmonary sympathetic efferent stimulation significantly decreases the time to the onset of electromechanical dissociation by increasing the heart rate and double product. The early onset of electromechanical dissociation appears to be related to cardiac work and oxygen consumption.", 
    "48": "The effects of inotropic interventions upon the maximal rate of change of left ventricular (LV) wall thickness and internal diameter during early diastole were measured in nine open-chest dogs by ultrasonic-dimension gauges. Isoproterenol increased the maximal rate of wall thickening during systole from 28 +/- 3 to 48 +/- 5 (SE) mm/s (P less than 0.001), whereas it had no effect on the maximal rate of wall thinning during early diastole, 40 +/- 4 vs. 42 +/- 4 mm/s [not significant (NS)]. Isoproterenol also increased the maximal rate of reduction of the LV diameter during systole from 87 +/- 6 to 125 +/- 8 mm/s (P less than 0.001), whereas it had little effect on the maximal rate of increase of the diameter during early diastole, 79 +/- 6 vs. 87 +/- 4 mm/s (NS). Similarly, propranolol had a direct effect on the maximal rate of wall thickening and LV diameter reduction during systole, but it had little or no effect on their counterparts during early diastole. These observations support the concept that alterations of the contractile state need not be accompanied by a concomitant effect on relaxation.", 
    "49": "This study was performed to compare the relative efficacies of propranolol and verapamil in patients with stable angina pectoris. In 18 patients (16 men, two women, mean age 58 years) with coronary artery disease and angina of effort, the results of low (40 mg every 6 hours) and high-dose (80 mg every 6 hours) propranolol therapy were compared to those of low (80 mg every 6 hours) and high-dose (120 mg every 6 hours) verapamil therapy in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled evaluation which lasted eight weeks: two weeks of placebo therapy, two weeks of propranolol or verapamil (one week low-dose, one week high-dose) therapy, three days of down-titration followed by one week of placebo therapy, two weeks of propranolol or verapamil therapy (whichever was not given earlier in the trial) (one week low-dose, one week hgh-dose) and three days of down-titration. During each period the following were quantitated: (1) chest pains/week; (2) nitroglycerin used/week; (3) transient ischemic S-T segment deviations and highest grade of ventricular ectopic activity on two-channel Holter monitor; (4) S-T segment deviations during supine bicycle exercise; (5) left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction at rest and during exercise (assessed by equilibrium gated blood pool scintigraphy); and (6) pulmonary function studies. Propranolol and high-dose verapamil therapy significantly reduced the frequency of angina, and high-dose verapamil therapy diminished both the need for nitroglycerin and the frequency of transient ischemic S-T segment deviations on Holter monitor. Neither agent exerted a clinically-important deleterious influence on left ventricular volumes or the ejection fraction. Forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume were worsened by propranolol but not by verapamil. Thus, in the patient with angina of effort, verapamil is a satisfactory therapeutic alternative to propranolol.", 
    "50": "The plasma level: time profile for l-propranolol and total propranolol concentrations were examined in normotensive subjects after intravenous and oral dl-propranolol. l-Propranolol concentrations in plasma accounted for about 60% of total propranolol. This was attributed to lower volume of distribution for the isomer. Mean plasma clearance of 1-propranolol was similarly affected while apparent plasma half-life for the l-isomer and total propranolol were of the same order. Oral bioavailability of 1- and total propranolol averaged 40.7 +/- 8.5% and 42.4 +/- 12.9%. Food and hydralazine increased oral bioavailability of total and l-propranolol by similar magnitudes. We conclude that difference in the kinetics of l- and total propranolol concentrations in plasma are small and probably of no clinical significance. Presystemic clearance of propranolol in man does not appear to be stereospecific.", 
    "51": "Right ventricular pacing at progressively increasing rates was performed in 25 patients with complete ventriculoatrial block, before and after autonomic blockade with intravenous propranolol and atropine. At the end of each ventricular pacing stage a right intraatrial electrogram and electrocardiographic leads were simultaneously recorded. The relation between right ventricular pacing and atrial rates was studied from the recordings obtained at each pacing stage in both group I, 8 patients with sick sinus syndrome, and group II, 17 patients with normal sinus function. Right ventricular pacing was associated with an increment in atrial rate that ws significantly smaller (probability [p] less than 0.001) in patients in group I (mean +/- standard error of the mean 8 +/- 6 beats/min) than in group II (mean 25 +/- 10 beats/min). The maximal atrial rate reached during right ventricular pacing exceeded 80 beats/min in all patients in group II but remained less than 74 beats/min in patients in group I. Because autonomic blockade did not significantly influence the preceding results, it is concluded that a mechanical effect on the sinus node may explain this phenomenon.", 
    "52": "The hemodynamic effect of 75 to 225 microgram/kg prenalterol (PNL) intravenously were studied at rest and during exercise in eight patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) after myocardial infraction (three patients), valvular surgery (three patients), and congestive cardiomyopathy (two patients). All head New York Health Association functional class III and IV CHF and were receiving digitalis and diuretics. With PNL at rest, left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) fell from 17 to 12 mm Hg, cardiac index (CI) rose from 2.1 to 2.9 L/min/m2, heart rate (HR) increased mildly, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) declined moderately, and peripheral arterial pressure was unchanged. During PNL exercise compared with control, LVFP rise was less and CI, HR, and SVR responses were similar; dyspnea and angina were reduced in most patients. The eight patients were than given PNL orally, 30 to 200 mg/day, versus placebo for 6 days with comparative evaluation by echocardiogram, systolic time intervals (STI), exercise test, and continuous ECG. With PNL orally five of eight patients improved symptomatically, ejection fraction increased from 0.44 to 0.53, and STI preejection period shortened by 10 msec, without change in resting HR or systemic arterial blood pressure. The incidence of ventricular premature beats was not increased. PNL orally vs placebo exercise capacity increased 10%. Thus PNL may be of value for long-term CHF treatment in addition to conventional therapy.", 
    "53": "Serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) response to beta-adrenergic blockade by propranolol infusion was determined in 11 normal subjects and 6 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) before and again after the surgical removal of abnormal parathyroid tissue. Propranolol infusion in PHPT patients before surgery resulted in no significant decrease in serum iPTH except at 2 h, when the mean value was 83 +/- 4.4% of baseline. After surgery and achieving a euparathyroid state, the same patients showed a significant propranolol-induced decrease in serum iPTH from baseline at all time periods tested, reaching the nadir value of 57 +/- 7.5% of baseline at 2 h after the start of the propranolol infusion. This response in PHPT patients after surgery was very similar to the response seen in normal subjects. Therefore, this impaired suppressibility of serum iPTH in PHPT is corrected after removal of the abnormal parathyroid tissue. The studies indicate that abnormal parathyroid tissue (either per se or via a metabolic state induced by it) is responsible for the impaired response to beta-adrenergic blockade. It therefore appears unlikely that the impaired beta-adrenergic responsiveness is involved in the pathogenesis of PHPT.", 
    "54": "1. Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and the capacity to perform prolonged submaximal physical exercise were studied in six young healthy subjects treated in a randomized double-blind fashion for 2 days with either placebo, the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (80 mg b.i.d.) or the cardioselective agent metoprolol (100 mg b.i.d.). On day 3, 1 h after the last dose, the subjects exercised for 30 min periods followed up 10 min rest up to the point of exhaustion. 2. The capacity to perform exercise was decreased with both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. However, at an equal degree of beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade, all subjects could exercise for a longer period of time on the cardioselective agent as compared with the non-selective drug. 3. Blood glucose levels decreased during exercise irrespective of the type of treatment, but the attenuation occurred most rapidly on propranolol. At exhaustion the average non-esterified fatty acid levels had increased 256% on placebo, 148% on metoprolol and 65% on propranolol. A significant positive correlation was found between changes in non-esterified fatty acid levels during exercise and total working time. It is concluded that beta-adrenoceptor blockade diminishes the capacity for prolonged sub-maximal exercise at least in part by reducing the availability of substrates to the working muscles.", 
    "55": "Reoxygenation of hypoxic isolated cardiac muscle results in prolonged duration of contraction-relaxation. To determine whether similar mechanical changes occur in the intact left ventricle (LV), and especially to assess the influence of prolonged relaxation on LV diastolic stiffness, we examined LV pressure transients (micromanometer) and changes in myocardial segment length (ultrasonic transit time) during reoxygenation in 22 anesthetized dogs following 15 minutes of hypoxia (PaO2 = 21 +/- 2 mm Hg). The time constant (T) of LV isovolumic exponential pressure decline was used as an index of myocardial relaxation; LV end-diastolic stiffness was assessed from stiffness constants derived from multiple coordinates of end-diastolic pressure and segment length (volume loading). During reoxygenation, after LV systolic pressure and segment length measurements had returned to control levels, relaxation was prolonged; T increased from a control of 32 +/- 2 to 44 +/- 3 msec at 5 minutes of reoxygenation (P less than 0.01). Prolonged relaxation resulted in a consistent increase in LV early-diastolic pressures. Furthermore, calculated values for LV end-diastolic stiffness increased during reoxygenation when the next beat began less than 3.5 T after maximum negative dP/dt; this condition was present more frequently at a heart rate of 150 beats/min than at 120 beats/min. Thus, rapid correction of acute hypoxia in the dog results in prolonged LV relaxation; prolonged relaxation can influence LV end-diastolic stiffness when relaxation is sufficiently slow and/or when diastole is sufficiently short.", 
    "56": "1. Groups of mice interacting socially in complex population cages become hypertensive. Some also develop fatal chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis. 2. Long-term administration of the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol controls stress-induced elevation of plasma renin and adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase. It also normalizes blood pressure. Despite the effectiveness of this sympathetic blockade, the incidence of nephritis was not diminished. 3. The fact that stress-induced increases of adrenal weight and plasma corticosterone persist during metoprolol treatment points to the independence of the pituitary-adrenal cortical system and its possible role in the aetiology of renal disease."
