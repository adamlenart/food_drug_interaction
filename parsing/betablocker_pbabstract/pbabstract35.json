Hyperlactatemia may develop when tissue oxygenation is jeopardized such as in shock, its absence having been, however, sometimes reported in sepsis in which interactions between infectious agents and the organism's cells might blunt or disrupt hyperlactatemia development. During the course of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis, a 9-month-old girl developed severe dehydration (capillary-refill time, 5 s) leading to hypovolemic shock without signs of sepsis and with hypotension at 62/21 mmHg Surprisingly, the child failed to develop hyperlactatemia during shock. An etiologic search to understand why hyperlactatemia did not occur revealed that this patient had been receiving propranolol since the age of four months for the treatment of a Cyrano hemangioma. Via its inhibitory action on \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, propranolol antagonizes the stimulation of glycolysis by catecholamines, which may be rationally proposed to have contributed to preventing hyperlactatemia during hypovolemic shock in this patient. Mechanisms by which propranolol can mediate this antihyperlactatemia action are further illustrated and discussed.",

We evaluated the impact of HD duration on clinical outcomes in HD patients with CAD after DES implantation. Between April 2007 and December 2012, 168 angina pectoris patients (320 de novo lesions) on HD were treated with DES. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and target lesion revascularization (TLR) were investigated at 3 years according to the HD duration (\u2264 3 years, 83 patients; >3 years, 85 patients). The incidence of MACE was significantly higher in the long HD duration group (25.3 vs. 50.6 %; P = 0.001). Especially, sudden cardiac death (SCD) was significantly higher in the long HD duration group (3.6 vs. 16.5 %; P = 0.006). On the other hand, the rates of TLR were similar between the two groups (12.0 vs. 14.1 %; P = 0.69). Cox's proportional hazard analysis revealed that HD duration (HR 1.08 per year, 95 % CI 1.03-1.13, P = 0.002), \u03b2-blocker use (0.28, 0.17-0.46, P < 0.001), and diabetes mellitus (2.10, 1.23-3.56, P = 0.007) were independent predictors of MACE.

    "2": "The serendipitous demonstration that the nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) antagonist propranolol promotes the regression of infantile hemangiomas (IHs) aroused interest around the involvement of the \u03b2-adrenergic system in angiogenic processes. The efficacy of propranolol was related to the \u03b22-AR blockade and the consequent inhibition of the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), suggesting the hypothesis that propranolol could also be effective in treating retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a retinal pathology characterized by VEGF-induced neoangiogenesis. Consequent to the encouraging animal studies, a pilot clinical trial showed that oral propranolol protects newborns from ROP progression, even though this treatment is not sufficiently safe. Further, animal studies clarified the role of \u03b23-ARs in the development of ROP and, together with several preclinical studies demonstrating the key role of the \u03b2-adrenergic system in tumor progression, vascularization, and metastasis, prompted us to also investigate the participation of \u03b23-ARs in tumor growth. The aim of this review is to gather the recent findings on the role of the \u03b2-adrenergic system in IHs, ROP, and cancer, highlighting the fact that these different pathologies, triggered by different pathogenic noxae, share common pathogenic mechanisms characterized by the presence of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis, which may be contrasted by targeting the \u03b2-adrenergic system. The mechanisms characterizing the pathogenesis of IHs, ROP, and cancer may also be active during the fetal-neonatal development, and a great contribution to the knowledge on the role of \u03b2-ARs in diseases characterized by chronic hypoxia may come from research focusing on the fetal and neonatal period.",

Nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, is widely used for hypertension and coronary heart disease therapy. In addition, nifedipine is known to exhibit an antiplatelet activity, but the underlying mechanisms involved remain unclear. Several transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) exist in platelets and have an ability to regulate platelet aggregation through a non-genomic mechanism. The present article focuses on describing the mechanisms of the antiplatelet activity of nifedipine via PPAR activation. It has been demonstrated that nifedipine treatment increases the activity and intracellular amount of PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3 in activated platelets. Moreover, the antiplatelet activity of nifedipine is mediated by PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3-dependent upon the up-regulation of the PI3K/AKT/NO/cyclic GMP/PKG pathway, and inhibition of protein kinase C\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1) activity via an interaction between PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3 and PKC\u03b1. Furthermore, suppressing NF-\u03baB activation by nifedipine through enhanced association of PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3 with NF-\u03baB has also been observed in collagen-stimulated platelets. Blocking PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3 activity or increasing NF-\u03baB activation greatly reverses the antiplatelet activity and inhibition of intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, PKC\u03b1 activity, and surface glycoprotein IIb/IIIa expression caused by nifedipine. Thus, PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3- dependent suppression of NF-\u03baB activation also contributes to the antiplatelet activity of nifedipine. Consistently, administration of nifedipine markedly reduces fluorescein sodium-induced vessel thrombus formation in mice, which is considerably inhibited when the PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3 antagonists are administrated simultaneously. Collectively, these results provide important information regarding the mechanism by which nifedipine inhibits platelet aggregation and thrombus formation through activation of PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3- mediated signaling pathways. These findings highlight that PPARs are novel therapeutic targets for preventing and treating platelet-hyperactivity-related vascular diseases.",

However, inappropriate use of landiolol (i.e., failure of evaluating factors that influence hemodynamic changes) may iatrogenically further complicate pathophysiology, and relatively higher doses of landiolol may be dangerous. We recommend that landiolol should not be routinely used to control cardiovascular responses during bronchoscopic endotracheal suctioning in the intensive care unit. Careful evaluation of factors influencing hemodynamic changes and close monitoring of the patient are mandatory following landiolol administration. Furthermore, a lower initiation dose is recommended.",

The same was true for the AR rats treated with carvedilol (30 mg/kg/d). Responses to these interventions were different at the level of gene expression. We measured mRNA levels of a number of genes implicated in the transport of energy substrates and we observed that training did not reverse the general down-regulation of these genes in AR rats whereas carvedilol normalized the expression of most of them.",

Docking studies, followed by the capacity to hasten erythropoiesis, identified todralazine (Binding energy, -8.4 kcal/mol) as a potential HSC-modulating agent. Todralazine (5 \u03bcM) significantly increased erythropoiesis in caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) in wild-type and anemic zebrafish embryos (2.33- and 1.44-folds, respectively) when compared with untreated and anemic control groups. Todralazine (5 \u03bcM) treatment also led to an increased number of erythroid progenitors, as revealed from the increased expression of erythroid progenitor-specific genes in the CHT region. Consistent with these effects, zebrafish embryos, Tg(cmyb:gfp), treated with 5 \u03bcM todralazine from 24 to 36 hours post fertilization (hpf) showed increased (approximately two-folds) number of HSCs at the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region (AGM). Similarly, expression of HSC marker genes, runx1 (3.3-folds), and cMyb (1.41-folds) also increased in case of todralazine-treated embryos, further supporting its HSC expansion potential. Metoprolol, a known beta blocker, also induced HSC expansion (1.36- and 1.48-fold increase in runx1 and cMyb, respectively). Todralazine (5 \u03bcM) when added 30 min before 20 Gy gamma radiation, protected zebrafish from radiation-induced organ toxicity, apoptosis, and improved survival (80% survival advantage over 6 days). The 2-deoxyribose degradation test further suggested hydroxyl (OH) radical scavenging potential of todralazine, and the same is recapitulated in vivo. These results suggest that todralazine is a potential HSC expanding agent, which might be acting along with important functions, such as antioxidant and free radical scavenging, in manifesting radioprotection.", 
    "27": "Adrenaline (epinephrine) is included in dental local anesthesia for the purpose of vasoconstriction. In Japan, adrenaline is contraindicated for use in patients receiving antipsychotic therapy, because the combination of adrenaline and an antipsychotic is considered to cause severe hypotension; however, there is insufficient evidence supporting this claim. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the changes in hemodynamics caused by drug interaction between adrenaline and an antipsychotic and to evaluate the safety of the combined use of adrenaline and an antipsychotic in an animal study. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. A catheter was inserted into the femoral artery to measure blood pressure and pulse rate. Rats were pretreated by intraperitoneal injection of chlorpromazine or chlorpromazine and propranolol, and after 20 minutes, saline or 1 of 3 different doses of adrenaline was administered by intraperitoneal injection. Changes in the ratio of mean arterial blood pressure and pulse rate were measured after the injection of adrenaline. Significant hypotension and tachycardia were observed after the injection of adrenaline in the chlorpromazine-pretreated rats. These effects were in a dose-dependent manner, and 100 \u03bcg/kg adrenaline induced significant hemodynamic changes. Furthermore, in the chlorpromazine and propranolol-pretreated rats, modest hypertension was induced by adrenaline, but hypotension and tachycardia were not significantly shown. Hypotension was caused by a drug interaction between adrenaline and chlorpromazine through the activation of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor and showed a dose-dependent effect. Low-dose adrenaline similar to what might be used in human dental treatment did not result in a significant homodynamic change.",

In this study, we discover that the cell fate of cardiomyocytes switches from survival to death with the increase of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) stimulation. Mathematical simulations combined with biochemical experimentation of \u03b2-AR signalling pathways show that the gradual increment of isoproterenol (a non-selective \u03b21/\u03b22-AR agonist) induces the switching response of Bcl-2 expression from the initial increase followed by a decrease below its basal level. The ERK1/2 and ICER-mediated feed-forward loop is the hidden design principle underlying such cell fate switching characteristics. Moreover, we find that \u03b21-blocker treatment increases the survival effect of \u03b2-AR stimuli through the regulation of Bcl-2 expression leading to the resistance to cell death, providing new insight into the mechanism of therapeutic effects. Our systems analysis further suggests a novel potential therapeutic strategy for heart disease.",

The discovery of highly selective toxins against a specific channel subtype facilitates the development of drugs with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the systemic characterization of a new scorpion short-chain K(+) channel blocker from Mesobuthus martensii, termed mesomartoxin (MMTX). MMTX is synthesized as a precursor comprising a signal peptide and a mature peptide of 29 residues. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis confirmed that recombinant MMTX adopts a typical cysteine-stabilized \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-sheet fold. Electrophysiological experiments showed that MMTX exhibits high affinity for the Drosophila Shaker K(+) channel but differential selectivity on different members of the rat voltage-gated K(+) channel (Kv) family, with nanomolar affinity (IC50=15.6 nM) for rKv1.2, micromolar affinity for rKv1.3 (IC50=12.5 \u03bcM) and no activity on rKv1.1 at >50 \u03bcM. Site-directed mutagenesis of the channel pore identified a key site located on the selectivity filter of the pore, which is directly implicated in toxin binding and controls target's selectivity of the toxin. Given a key role of Kv1.2 in epilepsy, MMTX might serve as a potential drug lead for the disease.",

Donor cell-derived neuronal development with functional synaptic formation with auditory neurons of the cochlear nucleus (CN) in the brainstem is a prerequisite for a successful transplantation. Here a rat auditory brainstem explant culture system was used as a screening platform for donor cells. The explants were co-cultured with human neural precursor cells (HNPCs) to determine HNPCs developmental potential in the presence of environmental cues characteristic for the auditory brainstem region in vitro. We explored effects of pharmacological inhibition of GTPase Rho with its effector Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling on the co-cultures. Pharmacological agents ROCK inhibitor Y27632 and EGFR blocker PD168393 were tested. Effect of the treatment on explant penetration by green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled HNPCs was evaluated based on the following criteria: number of GFP-HNPCs located within the explant; distance migrated by the GFP-HNPCs deep into the explant; length of the GFP+/neuronal class III \u03b2-tubulin (TUJ1)+ processes developed and phenotypes displayed. In a short 2-week co-culture both inhibitors had growth-promoting effects on HNPCs, prominent in neurite extension elongation. Significant enhancement of migration and in-growth of HNPCs into the brain slice tissue was only observed in Y27632-treated co-cultures. Difference between Y27632- and PD168393-treated HNPCs acquiring neuronal fate was significant, though not different from the fates acquired in control co-culture. Our data suggest the presence of inhibitory mechanisms in the graft-host environment of the auditory brainstem slice co-culture system with neurite growth arresting properties which can be modulated by administration of signaling pathways antagonists. Therefore the co-culture system can be utilized for screens of donor cells and compounds regulating neuronal fate determination.",

    "44": "Infantile hemangioma is a benign vascular neoplastic disorder that affects up to 10% of newborns and can lead to deformity or local complications in severe cases. Propranolol, administered alone or in combination with corticosteroids, is increasingly used to treat infantile hemangioma, but its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and potentially cause central nervous system adverse effects has prompted research on alternative \u03b2-blocker therapies for the disorder that have more favorable safety profiles, including nadolol. This article describes the use of nadolol to treat three pediatric patients with a buccal or genital hemangioma who developed adverse reactions (mainly, irritability and sleep disturbances) or resistance to initial treatment with propranolol. The patients were 10 months, 12 months, and 4 years of age, respectively, when hemangioma treatment was initiated. The results of nadolol therapy were favorable, with involution of lesions and gradual disappearance of propranolol-associated adverse effects occurring in all three cases.

In this study, we analyzed the clinical bradycardiac effects and the adverse respiratory effects of five \u03b2-blocking agents (landiolol, esmolol, propranolol, metoprolol and atenolol) used for CCTA. The changes of the occupancy binding to \u03b21 or \u03b22 receptor of these drugs were calculated based on the receptor occupancy theory. Thereafter, we predicted both the rate of heart rate decline (\u25b2HR) as a clinical effect and the rate of decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s (\u25b2FEV1) as an adverse effect, by using the ternary complex model. The results showed that the drugs with \u25b2HR greater than 10\u00a0%, necessary for CCTA, were as follows: landiolol at 13.5\u00a0%, propranolol at 11.0\u00a0%, and atenolol at 22.6\u00a0%. The \u25b2HR values at the end of CCTA for those three drugs were 0.3, 6.7, and 22.9\u00a0%, respectively. It is desirable for the bradycardiac effect to disappear at the end of CCTA. Therefore, landiolol is thought to be a preferable drug. On the other hand, \u25b2FEV1 at start and end of CCTA for those three drugs was 0.04-2.5, 34.9-40.3, and 6.0-6.1\u00a0%, respectively. Our results suggested that landiolol has the most appropriate effect and safety for patients with tachycardia who are undergoing a CCTA procedure.",

To evaluate the effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) of switching from latanoprost and travoprost monotherapy to timolol fixed combinations in Japanese patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). Methods. 27 NTG patients (54 eyes) were compared IOP, superficial punctuate keratitis (SPK) scores, and conjunctival injection scores in eyes treated with prostaglandin (PG) or PG analog/beta-blocker (PG/b) fixed-combination 6 months after the change in therapy.

    "59": "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible enzyme up-regulated in Alzheimer's disease, catabolises heme to biliverdin, Fe2+ and carbon monoxide (CO). CO can protect neurones from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by inhibiting Kv2.1 channels, which mediates cellular K+ efflux as an early step in the apoptotic cascade. Since apoptosis contributes to the neuronal loss associated with amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) toxicity in AD, we investigated the protective effects of HO-1 and CO against A\u03b2(1-42) toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, employing cells stably transfected with empty vector or expressing the cellular prion protein, PrP(c), and rat primary hippocampal neurons. A\u03b2(1-42) (containing protofibrils) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability, attributable at least in part to induction of apoptosis, with the PrP(c)-expressing cells showing greater susceptibility to A\u03b2(1-42) toxicity. Pharmacological induction or genetic over-expression of HO-1 significantly ameliorated the effects of A\u03b2(1-42). The CO-donor CORM-2 protected cells against A\u03b2(1-42) toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. Electrophysiological studies revealed no differences in the outward current pre- and post-A\u03b2(1-42) treatment suggesting that K+ channel activity is unaffected in these cells. Instead, A\u03b2 toxicity was reduced by the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine, and by the CaMKKII inhibitor, STO-609. A\u03b2 also activated the downstream kinase, AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK). CO prevented this activation of AMPK. Our findings indicate that HO-1 protects against A\u03b2 toxicity via production of CO. Protection does not arise from inhibition of apoptosis-associated K+ efflux, but rather by inhibition of AMPK activation, which has been recently implicated in the toxic effects of A\u03b2. These data provide a novel, beneficial effect of CO which adds to its growing potential as a therapeutic agent.",

    "61": "In Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) bucindolol significantly reduced mortality among Caucasians with systolic heart failure (HF) but not among African Americans. Whether this differential effect can be explained by racial differences in baseline characteristics has not been previously examined. Of the 2708 BEST participants, 627 were African Americans. Because African Americans were more likely to be younger and women, we used age-sex-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to estimate their outcomes (vs. Caucasians). A step-wise multivariable-adjusted model using 24 baseline characteristics was used to identify variables associated with between-race outcome differences and propensity-matching was used to determine independence of associations. Age-sex-adjusted HR for all-cause mortality for African Americans during 2 years of mean follow-up was 1.27. African Americans were more likely to have lower right ventricular ejection fraction. African Americans had no association with mortality among propensity-matched patients. The higher risk of death among African Americans in BEST may in part be due to their lower RVEF which may in part explain the lack of response to bucindolol among these patients. Future studies need to examine the role of low RVEF on the effect of beta-blockers in patients with systolic HF.",

A multinomial logistic regression model was created to assess factors associated with using each available AAD compared with using class Ic drugs before and after dronedarone was marketed in the United States. Additionally, we used the Kaplan-Meier method to determine the rates of change in AAD use and discontinuation during the year after AAD initiation. Of 8,562 patients with AF, 35% received class Ic drugs, 34% amiodarone, 24% sotalol, and 7% dronedarone. The median patient age was 56 (interquartile range 49 to 61), and 34% were women. Both before and after dronedarone was marketed, there was a statistically significant lower likelihood of class Ic drug use versus other AAD use with increasing age, inpatient index AF encounter, and previous or concomitant anticoagulation therapy. During the 1 year after AAD initiation, the AAD change rate was 14% for class Ic drugs, 8% for amiodarone, 17% for sotalol, and 18% for dronedarone (p <0.001); the AAD discontinuation rate was 40% for class Ic drugs, 52% for amiodarone, 40% for sotalol, and 69% for dronedarone (p <0.001).

    "68": "The inner ear vestibular system has numerous projections on central brain centers that regulate sympathetic outflow, and skeletal sympathetic projections affect bone remodeling by inhibiting bone formation by osteoblasts and promoting bone resorption by osteoclasts. In this study, we show that bilateral vestibular lesions in mice cause a low bone mass phenotype associated with decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption. This reduction in bone mass is most pronounced in lower limbs, is not associated with reduced locomotor activity or chronic inflammation, and could be prevented by the administration of the \u03b2-blocker propranolol and by genetic deletion of the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, globally or specifically in osteoblasts. These results provide novel experimental evidence supporting a functional autonomic link between central proprioceptive vestibular structures and the skeleton. Because vestibular dysfunction often affects the elderly, these results also suggest that age-related bone loss might have a vestibular component and that patients with inner ear pathologies might be at risk for fracture. Lastly, these data might have relevance to the bone loss observed in microgravity, as vestibular function is altered in this condition as well. \u00a9 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

Separate analyses for thiazides, chlorthalidone and indapamide (all low dose) showed each subclass was associated with significant reduction of some major outcome. Five RCTs (18\u200a,724 patients; SBP/DBP difference -10.5/-7 \u200ammHg) showed beta-blockers significantly reduced stroke, heart failure and major cardiovascular events. In RCTs comparing calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with placebo smaller SBP/DBP differences were achieved, mostly because in the majority of these later RCTs the antihypertensive drug and placebo were added on a background treatment with other antihypertensive agents. Nonetheless, significant reductions of stroke, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular and all-cause death were obtained with calcium antagonists (10 RCTs, 30,\u200a359 patients); stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure and major cardiovascular events by ACE inhibitors (12 RCTs, 35,\u200a707 patients); and stroke, heart failure and major cardiovascular events by ARBs (13 RCTs, 65,\u200a256 patients).",

We also evaluated the responsiveness of steroid-pretreated rat eyes to 5 different classes of antiglaucoma drugs that act by different mechanisms. Up to 80% of dexamethasone treated animals achieved significant and sustained IOP elevation. TM thickness was significantly increased and number of TM cells was significantly reduced in SIOH rats compared to the vehicle-treated rats. Quantitative assessment of retinal morphology showed significantly reduced thickness of ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner retina (IR) in SIOH rats compared to vehicle-treated rats. Estimation of retinal antioxidants including catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione showed significantly increased retinal oxidative stress in SIOH animals. Furthermore, steroid-treated eyes showed significant IOP lowering in response to treatment with 5 different drug classes. This indicated the ability of SIOH eyes to respond to drugs acting by different mechanisms. In conclusion, SIOH was associated with significant morphological changes in TM and retina and retinal redox status.

    "112": "The \u03b21-adrenergic antagonist metoprolol improves cardiac function in animals and patients with chronic heart failure, isolated mitral regurgitation (MR), and ischemic heart disease, though the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Metoprolol has been reported to upregulate cardiac expression of \u03b23-adrenergic receptors (\u03b23AR) in animal models. Myocardial \u03b23AR signaling via neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activation has recently emerged as a cardioprotective pathway. We tested whether chronic \u03b21-adrenergic blockade with metoprolol enhances myocardial \u03b23AR coupling with nitric oxide-stimulated cyclic guanosine monophosphate (\u03b23AR/NO-cGMP) signaling in the MR-induced, volume-overloaded heart. We compared the expression, distribution, and inducible activation of \u03b23AR/NO-cGMP signaling proteins within myocardial membrane microdomains in dogs (canines) with surgically induced MR, those also treated with metoprolol succinate (MR+\u03b2B), and unoperated controls. \u03b23AR mRNA transcripts, normalized to housekeeping gene RPLP1, increased 4.4 \u00d7 10(3)- and 3.2 \u00d7 10(2)-fold in MR and MR+\u03b2B hearts, respectively, compared to Control. Cardiac \u03b23AR expression was increased 1.4- and nearly twofold in MR and MR+\u03b2B, respectively, compared to Control. \u03b23AR was detected within caveolae-enriched lipid rafts (Cav3(+)LR) and heavy density, non-lipid raft membrane (NLR) across all groups. However, in vitro selective \u03b23AR stimulation with BRL37344 (BRL) triggered cGMP production within only NLR of MR+\u03b2B. BRL induced Ser (1412) phosphorylation of nNOS within NLR of MR+\u03b2B, but not Control or MR, consistent with detection of NLR-specific \u03b23AR/NO-cGMP coupling. Treatment with metoprolol prevented MR-associated oxidation of NO biosensor soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) within NLR. Metoprolol therapy also prevented MR-induced relocalization of sGC\u03b21 subunit away from caveolae, suggesting preserved NO-sGC-cGMP signaling, albeit without coupling to \u03b23AR, within MR+\u03b2B caveolae. Chronic \u03b21-blockade is associated with myocardial \u03b23AR/NO-cGMP coupling in a microdomain-specific fashion. Our canine study suggests that microdomain-targeted enhancement of myocardial \u03b23AR/NO-cGMP signaling may explain, in part, \u03b21-adrenergic antagonist-mediated preservation of cardiac function in the volume-overloaded heart.", 
    "113": "The most common inherited cardiac arrhythmia, LQT1, is due to IKs potassium channel mutations and is linked to high risk of adrenergic-triggered cardiac events. We recently showed that although exercise-triggered events are very well treated by \u00df-blockers for these patients, acute arousal-triggered event rate were not significantly reduced after beta-blocker treatment, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying arousal-triggered arrhythmias may be different from those during exercise. IKs is strongly regulated by \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) signaling, but little is known about the role of \u03b11-AR-mediated regulation.",

    "116": "Infarct size and brain edema following ischemia/reperfusion are reduced by inhibitors of the Na+, K+, 2Cl-, and water cotransporter NKCC1 and by \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonists. NKCC1 is a secondary active transporter, mainly localized in astrocytes, driven by transmembrane Na+/K+ gradients generated by the Na+,K+-ATPase. The astrocytic Na+,K+-ATPase is stimulated by small increases in extracellular K+ concentration and by the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Larger K+ increases, as occurring during ischemia, also stimulate NKCC1, creating cell swelling. This study showed no edema after 3\u2009hr medial cerebral artery occlusion but pronounced edema after 8\u2009hr reperfusion. The edema was abolished by inhibitors of specifically \u03b21-adrenergic pathways, indicating failure of K+-mediated, but not \u03b21-adrenoceptor-mediated, stimulation of Na+,K+-ATPase/NKCC1 transport during reoxygenation. Ninety percent reduction of extracellular Ca2+ concentration occurs in ischemia. Ca2+ omission abolished K+ uptake in normoxic cultures of astrocytes after addition of 5\u2009mM KCl. A large decrease in ouabain potency on K+ uptake in cultured astrocytes was also demonstrated in Ca2+-depleted media, and endogenous ouabains are needed for astrocytic K+ uptake. Thus, among the ionic changes induced by ischemia, the decrease in extracellular Ca2+ causes failure of the high-K+-stimulated Na+,K+-ATPase/NKCC1 ion/water uptake, making \u03b21-adrenergic activation the only stimulus and its inhibition effective against edema.",

Recombinant CYP2C9 microsomes of distinguished genotypes were used to characterize the corresponding enzyme activity toward carvedilol. 2-100\u00a0\u03bcM carvedilol was incubated for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The products were detected using high-performance liquid chromatography. CYP2C9 plays a certain role in carvedilol metabolism. Compared with wild-type CYP2C9*1, the intrinsic clearance (V max/K m) values of all variants toward carvedilol O-desmethylation were significantly altered. The variants exhibited significantly decreased values (from 30 to 99.8\u00a0%) due to increased K m and/or decreased V max values. We conclude that recombinant system could be used to investigate the enzymes involved in drug metabolism and these findings complement the database where CYP2C9 polymorphism interacts with biotransformation of exogenous substances like drugs and toxins.",

E2-, PPT-, DPN-, and G1-induced vasodilation and decreased [Ca(2+)]i were not blocked by L-NAME, TEA, apamin plus TRAM-34, iberiotoxin (large conductance Ca(2+)- and voltage-activated K(+) channel), 4-aminopyridine (voltage-dependent K(+) channel), glibenclamide (ATP-sensitive K(+) channel), or endothelium removal, suggesting an endothelium- and K(+) channel-independent mechanism. In endothelium-denuded vessels preconstricted with phenylephrine, high KCl, or the Ca(2+) channel activator Bay K 8644 (1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-[2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid methyl ester), ER agonist-induced relaxation and decreased [Ca(2+)]i were with E2 = PPT > DPN > G1 and not inhibited by the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ [1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one], and showed a similar relationship between decreased [Ca(2+)]i and vasorelaxation, supporting direct effects on Ca(2+) entry in VSM. Immunohistochemistry revealed ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2, and GPR30 mainly in the vessel media and VSM. Thus, in mesenteric microvessels, ER subtypes mediate distinct vasodilation and decreased [Ca(2+)]i (ER\u03b1 > ER\u03b2 > GPR30) through endothelium- and K(+) channel-independent inhibition of Ca(2+) entry mechanisms of VSM contraction.",

Here, we show that amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) double-transgenic (APP/PS1) mice demonstrate improvement in memory after they are cohoused with wild-type mice. The improvement was associated with increased protein and mRNA levels of BDNF in the hippocampus. Concomitantly, the number of BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was significantly elevated after cohousing. Methylazoxymethanol acetate, a cell proliferation blocker, markedly reduced BrdU(+) and BrdU/NeuN(+) cells and abolished the effect of social interaction. Selective ablation of mitotic neurons using diphtheria toxin (DT) and a retrovirus vector encoding DT receptor abolished the beneficial effect of cohousing. Knockdown of BDNF by shRNA transfection blocked, whereas overexpression of BDNF mimicked the memory-improving effect. A tropomyosin-related kinase B agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, occluded the effect of social interaction. These results demonstrate that increased BDNF expression and neurogenesis in the hippocampus after cohousing underlie the reversal of memory deficit in APP/PS1 mice.", 
    "134": "Reactive oxygen intermediers (ROI) play a role in the signal transduction of beta-adrenergic receptors. We investigated whether an antioxidant (limonene) can reduce the beta-mimetic effect of terbutaline in beta-2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22-AR)-regulated smooth muscles. Tissue samples were collected from nonpregnant (trachea) and 22-day-pregnant (myometrium and cervix) rats. Tissue contractility was investigated in an isolated organ bath. In separate groups of animals, the tracheal and uterine \u03b22-AR activities were upregulated by 17-beta-estradiol valerate (E2) and progesterone (P4), respectively. The total oxidant (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS) were also measured. The oxidative stress index (OSI) was defined as the ratio ofTOS and TAS. Terbutaline (10(-10) - 10(-5) M) decreased the spontaneous contractions in the nontreated and the P4-pretreated myometria. The concentration-response curves for terbutaline in the presence of 10-3 M limonene were shifted to the left, but the maximum inhibitory effect was unchanged. Terbutaline (10(-6) M) increased the cervical resistance both in the nontreated and in the P4-treated samples, while limonene reduced this action only in the P4-treated cervices. Terbutaline (10(-9) - 10(-4) M) reduced the tracheal tones both in the nontreated and in the E2-treated tissues, while limonene reduced these effects. The OSI was highest in the trachea and lowest in the pregnant myometrium. Limonene has various influence on terbutaline induced effects in certain tissues. Higher OSI value means, that the antioxidants have greater role in the beta-adrenergic signalmechanism. We assume that the significance of ROI in the signalling process of the \u03b22-ARs are divergent in the various tissues. Our results suggest that the antiasthmatic effect of beta-mimetics may worsen during parallel limonene administration.",

    "140": "Organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are a group of membrane transport proteins that facilitate the influx of endogenous and exogenous substances across biological membranes. OATPs are found in enterocytes and hepatocytes and in brain, kidney, and other tissues. In enterocytes, OATPs facilitate the gastrointestinal absorption of certain orally administered drugs. Fruit juices such as grapefruit juice, orange juice, and apple juice contain substances that are OATP inhibitors. These fruit juices diminish the gastrointestinal absorption of certain antiallergen, antibiotic, antihypertensive, and \u03b2-blocker drugs. While there is no evidence, so far, that OATP inhibition affects the absorption of psychotropic medications, there is no room for complacency because the field is still nascent and because the necessary studies have not been conducted. Patients should therefore err on the side of caution, taking their medications at least 4 hours distant from fruit juice intake. Doing so is especially desirable with grapefruit juice, orange juice, and apple juice; with commercial fruit juices in which OATP-inhibiting substances are likely to be present in higher concentrations; with calcium-fortified fruit juices; and with medications such as atenolol and fexofenadine, the absorption of which is substantially diminished by concurrent fruit juice intake.",

In this study, wild-type CYP2D6, two common allelic variants and 22 newly reported CYP2D6 isoforms were transiently expressed in 293FT cells, and the enzymatic activities of these variants were systematically assessed using dextromethorphan and bufuralol as the probing substrates. Consequently, 19 and 21 allelic variants were found to exhibit significantly decreased enzymatic activities for dextromethorphan and bufuralol, respectively. Of 22 novel CYP2D6 variants, six allelic isoforms (CYP2D6.89, CYP2D6.92, CYP2D6.93, CYP2D6.96, E215K and R440C) exhibited absent or extremely reduced metabolic activities compared with those observed for the wild-type enzyme.

    "143": "Stress stimuli affect the immune system of the mucosa, and in particular IgA secretion. It is well documented that intense psychological and physical stress can increase susceptibility to infection by diverse pathogens in the upper respiratory tract. Our workgroup reported that chronic stress caused by immobilization elicits a decrease in nasal IgA levels in mice. Here, we explore how acute stress (caused by 4h of immobilization) affects IgA secretion in the nasal mucosa, and the possible role of the sympathetic nervous system in this effect. Nine-week-old male CD1 mice were divided into four groups: control, chemical sympathectomy (with 6-OHDA) and treatment with nadolol (5mg/kg) or phentolamine (15mg/kg). All these groups were subdivided into stressed and unstressed animals. The parameters evaluated included plasma corticosterone and epinephrine (only in control groups), SIgA levels (by ELISA) and SIgA expression (by Western Blot) in nasal fluid, percentage of IgA+ plasma cells, and mRNA expression of heavy alpha chain, pIgR, TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2 in nasal mucosa. Acute stress reduced the percentage of IgA+ cells while increasing the levels of IgA, the two hormones, and the mRNA expression of heavy alpha chain, pIgR, TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2, which resulted in greater synthesis and transport of IgA. The treatments with 6-OHDA and \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockers suggest that sympathetic innervation by both types of adrenergic receptors is important for the control of SIgA secretion in nasal mucosa during acute stress. The increase in this parameter depended on the cytokines involved in IgA synthesis and transport.",

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated after 8\u00a0minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation and continued for an additional 8\u00a0minutes. The myocardial function and the serum concentrations of troponin I (Tn I) and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured at baseline and after resuscitation. After resuscitation, both Tn I and NT-proBNP were significantly increased in all groups, especially in the epinephrine and epinephrine pretreated with \u03b12-blocker groups. Significantly better PR myocardial function and neurologic deficit score were observed in epinephrine pretreated with the \u03b11- or \u03b2-blocker with decreased releases of Tn I and NT-proBNP. However, the most significant improvements were observed in the animals pretreated with \u03b2- plus \u03b11-blocker.

Approximately 25% of the U.S. population is served by such facilities. Nevertheless, studies on the treatment efficiency and discharge of organic contaminants through septic effluents are lacking. This pilot study showed the occurrence of organic contaminants including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), perfluoroalkyl surfactants (PFASs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in septic effluents, adjacent lake water samples, household drinking water in homes that use lake water or a well adjacent to the lake as a source of drinking water, and offshore lake water samples. Septic effluent as well as lake and tap water samples were collected from several households with OWTSs around Skaneateles Lake located in central New York. The advanced on-site systems were installed in some households for the purpose of limiting nutrient levels in the effluent to protect the local surface water. Additionally, because many of these systems serve homes with limited land, advanced treatment systems were needed. The median concentrations of ten PPCPs (ranged from 0.45 to 388\u00a0ng/L) and eleven PFASs (ranged from 0.20 to 14.6\u00a0ng/L) in septic water were significantly higher (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01) than in lake water samples.

The median concentrations of \u2211PBDEs in septic, lake, and tap water samples were 7.47, 3.49, and 2.22\u00a0ng/L, respectively, and those for \u2211PCBs were 33.1, 29.2, and 28.6\u00a0ng/L, respectively. The mass flux of PPCPs (i.e. the mass flow of PPCPs per unit area per unit time) through the disposal of treated septic effluent from textile biofilter and aerobic treatments to the dispersal unit ranged from 12 (carbamazepine) to 66900\u00a0\u03bcg/m(2)/day (caffeine) whereas that for PFASs ranged from 7.0 (perfluorobutanesulfonate) to 833\u00a0\u03bcg/m(2)/day (perfluorooctanoic acid). Based on the ratio of measured concentrations and method detection limit, triclocarban, perfluorooctanoic acid, and perfluorooctanesulfonate have the potential to be used as chemical tracers of septic water contamination in Skaneateles Lake.

We followed for five years all patients who were prescribed their first-ever antihypertensive agents between 2001 and 2005 in a public healthcare sector of Hong Kong. The association between antihypertensive drug class and cancer mortality was evaluated by Cox proportional hazard models with propensity score matching. Age, gender, socioeconomic status, service settings, district of residence, proportion of days covered reflecting medication adherence, and the number of comorbidities were adjusted. From 217,910 eligible patients, 9500 (4.4%) died from cancer within five years after their first-ever antihypertensive prescription. Most cancer deaths occurred in the digestive (38.9%) and respiratory system (30.4%); the breast (6.2%); and the lympho-hematopoietic tissues (5.3%). The proportion of patients who died from cancer was the highest in the calcium channel blocker (CCB) group (6.5%), followed by thiazide diuretics (4.4%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (4.2%) and \u03b2-blockers (2.6%). When compared with \u03b2-blockers, patients prescribed CCBs (Adjusted Hazard Ratio [AHR]=1.406, 95% C.I. 1.334-1.482, p<0.001) were more likely to die from cancer. Thiazide users were also more likely to suffer from cancer deaths (AHR=1.364, 95% C.I. 1.255-1.483, p<0.001), but became insignificant in stratified analysis. The association between cancer mortality and use of CCB, and perhaps thaizide, may alert physicians to the need for more meticulous and comprehensive care of these patients in clinical practice. We recommend prospective studies to evaluate cause-and-effect relationships of these associations.",

However, because of risks of complications and mortality, this treatment option is limited to patients with minimal comorbidities. We performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating the impact of pre-HCT systolic dysfunction on outcomes. We identified 49 subjects with systolic dysfunction, defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% and 49 controls (matched by age, gender, conditioning regimen, and HCT donor number; all with LVEF \u2265 50%) undergoing HCT at the University of Minnesota between 2002 and 2012. Treatment complications, use of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and overall survival (OS) after HCT out to 24 months were analyzed. The median LVEF was 45% (range, 27.5% to 49%) for the study group and 60% (range, 50% to 69%) for controls. The majority of patients in both groups (81.6%) received reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). Treatment-related mortality (TRM) at day 100 was identical, with a cumulative incidence of 14% in the study (95% confidence interval [CI], 5% to 24%) versus 14% in controls (95% CI, 5% to 24%) (P = .89). Two-year OS was similar in the study group (53%; 95% CI, 38% to 66%) versus controls (61%; 95% CI, 46% to 73%) (P = .34). LVEF \u2265 43% was associated with improved OS at 1 year (hazard ratio [HR], .36; 95% CI, .15 to .87; P = .02). There was no significant difference in the incidence of non-life-threatening cardiac complications (12.2% in cases versus 8.2% in controls, P = .50) or serious (life-threatening or fatal) cardiac complications (4.1% in cases versus 2.0% in controls, P = .56). Pre-existing coronary artery disease was associated with increased TRM at 100 days (HR, 4.35; 95% CI, 1.24 to 15.32; P = .02). Cardiac medication use had no effect on TRM. Our study demonstrates that patients with asymptomatic borderline systolic dysfunction can safely undergo HCT with RIC. Coronary artery disease remains a risk factor for increased TRM. Patients with borderline systolic dysfunction can safely undergo HCT, but may need particular vigilance for potential hemodynamic or ischemic cardiac complications.", 
    "163": "Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is the main co-transmitter accompanying the release of acetylcholine from motor nerve terminals. Previously, we revealed the direct inhibitory action of extracellular ATP on transmitter release via redox-dependent mechanism. However, the receptor mechanism of ATP action and ATP-induced sources of reactive oxygen sources (ROS) remained not fully understood. In the current study, using microelectrode recordings of synaptic currents from the frog neuromuscular junction, we analyzed the receptor subtype involved in synaptic action of ATP, receptor coupling to NADPH oxidase and potential location of ATP receptors within the lipid rafts. Using subtype-specific antagonists, we found that the P2Y13 blocker 2-[(2-chloro-5-nitrophenyl)azo]-5-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-[(phosphonooxy)methyl]-4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde did not prevent the depressant action of ATP. In contrast, the P2Y12 antagonist 2-methylthioadenosine 5'-monophosphate abolished the inhibitory action of ATP, suggesting the key role of P2Y12 receptors in ATP action. As the action of ATP is redox-dependent, we also tested potential involvement of the NADPH oxidase, known as a common inducer of ROS. The depressant action of extracellular ATP was significantly reduced by diphenyleneiodonium chloride and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, two structurally different inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, indicating that this enzyme indeed mediates the action of ATP. Since the location and activity of various receptors are often associated with lipid rafts, we next tested whether ATP-driven inhibition depends on lipid rafts. We found that the disruption of lipid rafts with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin reduced and largely delayed the action of ATP. Taken together, these data revealed key steps in the purinergic control of synaptic transmission via P2Y12 receptors associated with lipid rafts, and identified NADPH oxidase as the main source of ATP-induced inhibitory ROS at the neuromuscular junction. Our data suggest that the location of P2Y receptors in lipid rafts speeds up the modulatory effect of ATP. Uncovered mechanisms may contribute to motor dysfunctions and neuromuscular diseases associated with oxidative stress.",

Intra- and inter-assay precision values for replicate quality control samples were within 11.4% for all analytes during the assay validation. Mean quality control accuracy values were within \u00b111.5% of nominal values for all analytes. Assay recoveries were high (>91%) and internal standard normalized matrix effects were minimal. The four analytes were stable in rat plasma for at least 24h at room temperature, 89 days at -20 \u00b0C and -80 \u00b0C, and following at least five freeze-thaw cycles. The validated assay was successfully applied to the quantification of carvedilol and its pharmacologically active metabolites in rat pharmacokinetic study. The accurate and simple method we developed could be applied to human pharmacokinetic study in the near future.", 
    "165": "Experimental studies in preclinical mouse models of breast cancer have shown that chronic restraint stress can enhance disease progression by increasing catecholamine levels and subsequent signaling of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. Catecholamines also signal \u03b1-adrenergic receptors, and greater \u03b1-adrenergic signaling has been shown to promote breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. However, antagonism of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors can result in elevated catecholamine levels, which may increase \u03b2-adrenergic signaling, because pre-synaptic \u03b12-adrenergic receptors mediate an autoinhibition of sympathetic transmission. Given these findings, we examined the effect of \u03b1-adrenergic blockade on breast cancer progression under non-stress and stress conditions (chronic restraint) in an orthotopic mouse model with MDA-MB-231HM cells. Chronic restraint increased primary tumor growth and metastasis to distant tissues as expected, and non-selective \u03b1-adrenergic blockade by phentolamine significantly inhibited those effects. However, under non-stress conditions, phentolamine increased primary tumor size and distant metastasis. Sympatho-neural gene expression for catecholamine biosynthesis enzymes was elevated by phentolamine under non-stress conditions, and the non-selective \u03b2-blocker propranolol inhibited the effect of phentolamine on breast cancer progression. Selective \u03b12-adrenergic blockade by efaroxan also increased primary tumor size and distant metastasis under non-stress conditions, but selective \u03b11-adrenergic blockade by prazosin did not. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that \u03b12-adrenergic signaling can act through an autoreceptor mechanism to inhibit sympathetic catecholamine release and, thus, modulate established effects of \u03b2-adrenergic signaling on tumor progression-relevant biology.", 
    "166": "In order to test the influence of the sympathetic nervous system on Leishmania mexicana infection, groups of female BALB/c mice were treated (i.p.) with the non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) antagonist (S)-propranolol (5mg/kg thrice a day), the \u03b22-AR agonist clenbuterol (1mg/kg once a day) or the \u03b12-AR antagonist yohimbine (2mg/kg twice a day) during 5days. During the second day of treatments, mice were inoculated in the footpad with 1\u00d710(6) or 1\u00d710(3) metacyclic promastigotes of L. mexicana mexicana (LV4). The lesion size was measured weekly, and parasite burden on week 12. In mice treated with (S)-propranolol, the percentage of splenic T lymphocytes producing IFN-\u03b3 after antigen challenge was determined by flow cytometry. In mice infected with 1\u00d710(6) parasites, only (S)-propranolol caused a reduction of footpad swelling (p<0.05, weeks 11-12), without effects on parasite burden, or in the percentage of IFN-\u03b3-immunopositive CD4(+) or CD8(+) T lymphocytes. In mice infected with 1\u00d710(3) parasites, the effects of treatments vs. control group were as follows: (a) inhibition of footpad swelling by (S)-propranolol (p<0.01, weeks 3-12), clenbuterol (p<0.05, weeks 7-10), and yohimbine (p<0.01, week 7); (b) a decrease of the parasite burden by (S)-propranolol (p<0.01) and yohimbine (p<0.05); (c) in control mice the percentage of CD4(+) T-cells producing IFN-\u03b3 was 6.2\u00b10.5%, while in those treated with (S)-propranolol it increased to 8.7\u00b10.6% (p<0.01); (d) in control mice the percentage of CD8(+) T-cells producing IFN-\u03b3 was 3.1\u00b10.4%, while in those treated with (S)-propranolol it increased to 10.4\u00b10.2% (p<0.01). These results indicate that the blockade of \u03b2-ARs during infection of BALB/c mice with an inoculum of L. mexicana mexicana similar to that delivered by the bite of a sand fly produces a Th1 bias in the immune response, favoring an increment of T lymphocytes secreting IFN-\u03b3, which correlated with a reduced parasite burden (p<0.05, Spearman's test). We suggest that \u03b2-AR antagonists could be of therapeutic value, either as treatment or as adjuvant of vaccines for L. mexicana.", 
    "167": "Since clinical application of MSCs requires long-term ex vivo culture inducing senescence in MSCs and reducing the therapeutic activity of transplanted MSCs, numerous efforts have been attempted to sustain the active state of MSCs. Substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide that functions to activate the cellular physiological responses of MSCs, including proliferation, migration, and secretion of specific cytokines. In this study, we explored the potential of SP to restore the weakened immune modulating activity of MSCs resulting from long-term culture by measuring T cell activity and interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion of CD4(+) Jurkat leukemic T cells and primary CD4(+) T cells. As the number of cell passages increased, the immunosuppressive function of MSCs based on T cell activity decreased. This weakened activity of MSCs could be restored by SP treatment and nullified by co-treatment of an NK1 receptor blocker. Higher levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) secretion were noted in the medium of SP-treated late passage MSC cultures, but IL-10 levels did not change. SP-treated MSC-conditioned medium decreased T cell activity and IL-2/Interferon gamma (IFN-g) secretion in T cells even in the activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or CD3/CD28 antibodies, both of which were successfully blocked by inhibiting the TGF beta signaling pathway. This stimulatory effect of SP on late passage MSCs was also confirmed in direct cell-cell contact co-culture of MSCs and CD4(+) Jurkat T cells. Collectively, our study suggests that SP pretreatment to MSCs may recover the immunosuppressive function of late passage MSCs by potentiating their ability to secrete TGF-\u03b21, which can enhance the therapeutic activity of ex vivo expanded MSCs in long-term culture.", 
    "168": "The occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater treatment plants and surface waters has been detected worldwide, constituting a potential risk for aquatic ecosystems. Adult zebrafish, of both sexes, were exposed to three common pharmaceutical compounds (atenolol, ketoprofen and diclofenac) and their UV photolysis by-products over seven days. The results show that diclofenac was removed to concentrations<LOD after 5 min of UV irradiation. The oxidative stress response of zebrafish to pharmaceuticals and their photolysis by-products was evaluated through oxidative stress enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase) and lipid peroxidation. Results suggest that the photolysis by-products of diclofenac were more toxic than those from the other compounds tested, showing an increase in GST and CAT levels, which are also supported by higher MDA levels. Overall, the toxicity of waters containing atenolol and ketoprofen was reduced after the parent compounds were transformed by photolysis, whereas the toxicity increased significantly from the by-products generated through diclofenac photolysis. Therefore, diclofenac photolysis would possibly necessitate higher irradiation time to ensure that the associated by-products are completely degraded to harmless form(s).", 
    "169": "The present study was performed to investigate the peripheral cardiovascular effects of opiorphin in anesthetized rats. Intravenous (i.v.) injection of opiorphin (50-500nmol/kg) caused marked dose-dependent increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The pressor and tachycardic responses induced by opiorphin (300nmol/kg, i.v.) were significantly decreased by pretreatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist valsartan, which suggested that endogenous angiotensin may be involved in the response to opiorphin. Pretreatment with \u03b1-adrenoreceptor antagonist phentolamine and \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol respectively attenuated the pressor response induced by opiorphin. Propranolol, but not phentolamine, inhibited the tachycardic response. Moreover, reserpine blocked both responses to opiorphin. These findings indicated that the effects of opiorphin to increase blood pressure and heart rate might be due to the stimulation of sympathetic ganglia. Additionally, studies with bilaterally adrenalectomized rats showed that adrenal medulla may be involved in the cardiovascular regulation of opiorphin. In addition, pretreatment with nonselective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone did not modify the cardiovascular responses to opiorphin, suggesting that the effects of opiorphin were not related to the opioid system. Furthermore, radioimmunoassay (RIA) showed that opiorphin significantly increased endogenous levels of angiotensin II and angiotensin III. In summary, all the results indicate that the cardiovascular effects induced by opiorphin are mediated through the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), the sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla, but not the opioid system."
