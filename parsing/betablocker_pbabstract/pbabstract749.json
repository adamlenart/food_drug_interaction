    "0": "Because the mechanism of adverse reactions to abrupt withdrawal of propranolol in patients with coronary disease is an enigma, we studied the effect of cessation of propranolol on beta receptor reactivity to catecholamine stimulation. Heart rate and maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressur (dP/dt max) during isoproterenol infusions and plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) after epinephrine infusions were measured in six conscious dogs before, during and after four weeks of oral propranolol (40 mg p.o. q8h). Rises in heart rate, dP/dt max and FFAs were blocked during propanolol administration. Twenty-four hours after withdrawal from propranolol, heart rate and dP/dt max responses remained significantly attenuated, although FFA responses were at premedication levels. The 72-hour, 96-hour and one week postmedication responses did not differ from premedication values. Thus, partial beta blockade of the heart was still present at 24 hours and no evidence of heightened beta receptor sensitivity was detected on repeated study one week after withdrawal from a long-term, high dose propranolol regimen.", 
    "1": "Timolol is a beta-adrenergic blocking agent that produces a significant decrease in intraocular pressure. Timolol ophthalmic solution 0,25% and 0,5% was compared to pilocarpine 1%, 2% and 4% in a randomized, double-masked study involving 40 patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Each patient was followed for 6 months. Timolol lowered the 1OP 30% compared to the pretreatment pressure, Pilocarpine 20%. Timolol was well tolerated in general, but 3 patients showed a superficial keratopathy. 30 other glaucoma patients with previously unsufficient pressure control received Timolol alone or in combination with a topical cholinergic agent or/and a systematic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. The results are presented in detail.", 
    "2": "Warm ischemia is a potential problem during the harvesting of cadaveric kidneys for transplantation purposes. This ischemia can cause impaired renal function following transplantation. The purpose of our study was to determine whether the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol was effective in improving renal function after ischemia. Dog kidneys were subjected to 30 minutes of warm ischemia followed by hypothermic pulsatile preservation for 24 hours. The kidneys then were autotransplanted with immediate contralateral nephrectomy. In this model only 50% of the untreated control group survived. Three different protocols using propranolol were tested. Administration of propranolol to dogs before the ischemic period, or installation of propranolol into the renal artery at the start of the ischemia, or addition of propranolol to the preservation perfusate lessened the severity of acute tubular necrosis and resulted in 100% long-term survival. Although the mechanism was not investigated, it has been suggested that propranolol is acting through its blockade of beta-mediated renin release and/or through its so-called membrane-stabilizing effect.", 
    "3": "Incubation of hamster isolated fat cells with the ionophore A23187 and calcium for 20 minutes caused 30-40% increases in the cyclic 3':5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.17) activity of adipocyte homogenates when either 0.6 micron cyclic AMP or 0.6 micron cyclic GMP was the enzyme substrate. The stimulation of adipocyte cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity by A23187 and calcium was not antagonized by the adrenergic receptor blocking agents phentolamine and propranolol. The changes in enzyme activity produced by the ionophore and calcium were not associated with elevated intracellular cyclic AMP levels. Furthermore, A23187 and calcium acted to enhance adipocyte phosphodiesterase activity before, but not after, homogenization of the fat cells. These data suggest that the phosphodiesterase activity of hamster isolated fat cells may, at least in part, be regulated by fluctuations in intracellular calcium concentrations.", 
    "4": "The effect of phenylephrine (30 micron) in the presence of propranolol (1 micron) on electrically induced isometric twitches and on KCl-contractures was studied in papillary muscles from reserpine-pretreated cats at 25 degrees C. Under these conditions phenylephrine has previously been shown to act solely via alpha-adrenoceptors and not to increase c-AMP. Phenylephrine increased force of contraction, time to peak tension and relaxation time. Contracture tension remained unaffected. These data indicate that the stimulation of cardiac alpha-adrenoceptors, in contrast to beta-adrenergic stimulation, does not lead to so-called relaxant effects. This qualitative difference between the two responses is probably due to the different capacity of both stimuli to increase c-AMP.", 
    "5": "A method is described which allows quantitative comparison of cAMP content determined by immunocytochemical procedures. This technique was then employed to localize cAMP in lungs of normal and pertussis-vaccinated mice following saline, histamine, or epinephrine challenge. All primary pulmonary compartments were shown to contain some immunoreactive (cAMP) material. However, epinephrine and histamine challenge selectively increased the cAMP content of the vasculature. No effect of epinephrine or histamine was detected in bronchial smooth muscle or interstitial tissue. This increased cAMP accumulation was observed in both normal and pertussis-vaccinated mice following epinephrine challenge but only in pertussis-vaccinated mice after histamine administration. These results demonstrate that histamine and epinephrine stimulate cAMP accumulation in the same pulmonary compartments supporting earlier speculation that histamine acts indirectly through epinephrine release. Further, primary involvement of the vasculature supports a more prominent role for this tissue in pertussis mediated histamine hypersensitivity.", 
    "6": "Three colonic and three ileal loops were prepared in six rabbits pretreated with propranolol (PR) 4 mg./kg. I.V. and in five untreated rabbits. In random order, 1 ml. of either deoxycholic acid (DCA) 6 mM., prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) 20 microgram./ml., or saline was placed in each colonic loop and 1 ml. of either cholera enterotoxin (CE) 10 microgram./ml., PGE1 20 microgram./ml., or saline was placed in each ileal loop. In untreated animals, DCA and PGE1 in the colon and CE and PGE1 in the ileum stimulated (P less than 0.01) adenylate cyclase (AC) and net secretion. In the colon, PR abolished DCA-stimulation of AC and net secretion and decreased PGE1-stimulated AC (P less than 0.01) and net secretion. In conclusion, at the doses and times studied, colonic-AC and net secretion stimulated by PGE1 or DCA was distinguished from small bowel-AC and net secretion stimulated by PGE1 or CE.", 
    "7": "Apressin (2.5 mg/kg), obsidan (10 mg/kg), and diprazine (10mg/kg) caused an increase in the content of NAD + NAD.H2, without affecting their ratio, in the liver and brain of intact animals. These drugs, taken in the same doses, especially when used together, caused an increase in the NAD + NAD.H2 level; as to NAD/NAD.H2 ratio--it decreased in the state of hypoxia. The authors believe the antihypoxic action of apressin, obsidan, and diprazine to be connected with the rise in the total nicotinamide adenine denucleotide content and with increase of its oxidized form.", 
    "8": "A new fluorescent beta-adrenergic antagonist, 9-amino-acridin propranolol (9-AAP), was administered intravenously to living mice. In the cerebral cortex, the highest concentration of 9-AAP was noted in the hippocampal formation, where it distinctly labeled the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer and the granule cell layer of the dentate gryus. High uptake occurred in the pyramidal cell layer of the piriform cortex. In the neocortex, fluorescence was less dense and more diffuse but confined to the basal layers. A similar pattern was observed in the basal layers of the cingulate cortex, but an additional high-density dotted fluorescence labeled its layer II. In the cerebellar cortex, 9-AAP was localized within the Purkinje cell layer. In the spinal cord, the highest density of fluorescence was observed in the nuclear collections of alpha-motoneurons. The findings were similar to those observed in the central nervous system of the rat and support the reproducibility of the method. 9-AAP may be used in vivo as a fluorescent probe to map out the central beta-adrenergic receptor system.", 
    "9": "The ability of isoproterenol, glucagon, PGE1 and cholera toxin to stimulate the synthesis of cAMP and protein kinase activity in line of liver cells (BRL) and a line of rat hepatoma cells (H35) has been determined. The concentration of cAMP in BRL cells (approximately 10 pmoles/mg protein) is in the range reported for other cultured cell lines but H35 cells contain extraordinarily low amounts of this cyclic nucleotide (approximately 0.05 pmoles/mg protein). Isoproterenol and PGE1 caused an increase in cAMP content, and protein kinase activation in BRL cells, although glucagon was ineffective. H35 cells, in contrast, were completely insensitive to all hormonal agonists. Despite this fact, cholera toxin was able to produce a marked increase in cAMP content, adenylate cyclase activity and protein kinase activation in H35 cells. binding studies with [125 I]-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol, a specific beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, revealed that each H35 cell possesses fewer than 10 beta-adrenergic receptors whereas BRL cells contain 2-5,000 receptors per cell. The low level of cAMP in H35 cells appears to result from a combination of totally unstimulated adenylate cyclase and apparently elevated phosphodiesterase activities.", 
    "10": "In a pharmaceutical industry, several cases of allergic contact eczema caused by the beta-adrenergic blocking agent alprenolol (Aptin) have appeared. This report deals with 12 men and two women who developed eczema during work with the substance. In 13 of the 14 cases, the induction time for sensitization was less than 1 year. The skin reactions were very florid. After healing they could be reproduced by very small quantities of the substance. In one case, eczema could also be produced after ingestion of Aptin tablets. All the cases were transferred to other work within the factory. An intensive programme was implemented to remove dust from the working areas. Despite this, isolated new cases still appear. Some employees in contact with the substance also experienced mucous membrane symptoms. These symptoms could not be shown to have an allergic aetiology, but were considered to be irritant reactions. Alprenolol must be considered a very strong contact allergen.", 
    "11": "Pre-infarction angina, in the absence of coronary artery disease, was found in a 62 year-old man with severe calcific aortic stenosis. After application of intraaortic balloon pump counter-pulsation, the condition was stabilized, and coronary arteriograms were safely carried out. Interestingly, an elevated right atrial and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure with an associated Bernheim's effect was demonstrated by cardiac catheterization. The hemodynamics of the right heart returned to normal after surgical correction of the aortic stenosis. The clinical indications for intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation in this setting are discussed.", 
    "12": "Effects of the optical isomers of propranolol on blood pressure in the rat, and in the spinal rat during adrenaline infusion were studied to investigate the mechanism of the pressor action of propranolol. Both isomers of propranolol produced a sustained pressor action in the rat and in the spinal rat infused with adrenaline. The magnitude of the pressor action produced by the d- and 1-propranolol was proportional to their beta-adrenoceptor blocking activities in the heart as was reported by several investigators. It is concluded that the pressor action of propranolol is due to the blockade of the beta-adrenoceptors mediating vasodilation in the skeletal muscle vascular beds.", 
    "13": "Antiarrhythmic effects of oxprenolol, a beta-blocker, were studied quantitatively on arhythmias produced by epinephrine during halothane anesthesia and by two-stage coronary ligation, and were compared to those of other beta-blockers, propranolol and K\u00f6 1400, which have been already reported. Though oxprenolol has potent beta-blocking activity, the antiarrhythmic effect on halothane-epinephrine arrhythmia was significantly weaker than those of propranolol and K\u00f6 1400. The effective dose of oxprenolol was 60 +/- 18 microgram/kg (mean +/- S.E., N = 6), which is in the range of the so-called beta-adrenergic blocking dose. The weaker antiarrhythmic effect of oxprenolol as compared to propranolol and K\u00f6 1400 is probably due to the intrinsic positive chronotropic effect, which is most clearly observed in oxprenolol as compared to the other two drugs. As for two-stage coronary ligation arrhythmia, oxprenolol suppressed only that observed 48 hours after coronary ligation using higher doses (5 to 10 mg/kg). Other beta-blockers also showed similar effects. Because of the high doses necessary for the antiarrhythmic effects on the coronary ligation arrhythmia, the mechanism for suppressing the arrhythmia is probably due to the local anesthetic action of the beta-blockers.", 
    "14": "The effects of a new beta-blocking agent (CI 778) were studied in 8 patients in whom non-invasive data suggested absence of significant organic heart disease. The left ventricular hemodynamics at rest and during bicycle exercise were measured before and after intravenous administration of 0,9 mg/kg body weight. With exercise there was a significantly smaller increment of heart rate (18%) after beta-blockade. Stroke volume index at rest was significantly lower (17%) after administration of CI 775; the difference disappeared with exercise. There was an 18% decrease of the resting cardiac output after CI 775 and a 23% decrease with exercise. Significant changes at rest and with exercise indicating a negative inotropic action of CI 775 were noted for max dP/dt and peak measured velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (Vpm). The left ventricular enddiastolic pressure with exercise increased with borderline significance by 41% after CI 775. Also left ventricular stroke work index at rest and with exercise decreased moderately (n.s.), the systemic arterial resistance changed to the same extent as cardiac output decreased. Also the arterial venous oxygen difference increased after CI 775 only according to the decrease of cardiac output. The data suggest the hemodynamic properties of CI 775 are located between propranolol and practolol within the spectrum of available beta-blockers.", 
    "15": "A case of a newborn infant with clinical and angiocardiographic signs of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is presented. The baby died after a short therapy with beta-blockers. Light- and electron-microscopic investigations showed severe disorganization of muscular cellular arrangement and disturbances of intracellular structures of the interventricular septum. HOCM is a genetically determined disease which can present clinically in the newborn period and may simulate congenital cardiac malformations.", 
    "16": "VIP stimulates lipolysis and adenyl cyclase activity in the rat adipose tissue. VIP-induced lipolysis and adenyl cyclase activity are not affected by phenoxybenzamine. VIP-induced lipolysis is inhibited by propranolol but VIP-induced adenyl cyclase activity is not.", 
    "17": "Measurement of the blood volume in cases of essential hypertension has shown a negative correlation with increase in blood pressure. We have been able to distinguish a group of moderate hypertensives who are hypervolemic, and whose systemic effect is more marked than in the moderate hypovolemic type. Such cases respond poorly to single drug therapy with beta blockers, but well to diuretics. The authors propose a general treatment scheme for essential hypertension: single therapy (beta blockers or diuretics) in mild cases of hypertension; single therapy by diuretics in the moderate types with the increased volume; single therapy by beta blockers in the moderate types with low volume, multiple treatment with the drugs together in cases of severe hypertension.", 
    "18": "The glucagon-releasing activity of adenosine-5'-ethyl-carboxamide (744-96) was studied in conscious dogs pretreated either with aminophylline or with bupranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug. The adenosine antagonist, aminophylline, inhibited both the glucagon-releasing and the blood pressure lowering effects of 744-96 (10 microgram/kg i.v.). The actions of the adenosine analogue on glucagon release and haemodynamics were not affected by bupranolol pretreatment. These results indicate that the adenosine analogue mediates glucagon release by interaction with so-called adenosine receptors. A beta-adrenoceptor mediated release secondary to 744-96-induced hypotension and baroreceptor-activation can be excluded.", 
    "19": "Three beta1-selective beta-blocker (metoprolol, practolol and H 87/07) were compared in 29 patients with stable angina pectoris. The main pharmacological difference between the three beta-blockers was their intrinsic stimulating activity (I.S.A.), metoprolol being devoid of I.S.A., practolol having moderate I.S.A. and H 87/07 having high I.S.A. Each drug was given in randomized order and the length of each cross-over period was 2 weeks. Daily activity was measured by an automatic step-counter, and subjective symptoms and nitroglycerin consumption were registered on a diary-card. Objective data, such as ECG changes and exercise capacity, were obtained by bicycle ergometer tests performed at the end of each period. At rest, the heart rate was significantly lower on metoprolol than on practolol or H 87/07. During exercise, the heart rate was significantly higher on H 87/07 than on practolol or metoprolol. No other haemodynamic differences were found between the three beta-blockers. No differences were found between the three test periods with regard to daily activity, expressed as the number of steps walked, while on the beta-blocker with high I.S.A., H 87/07, the attack rate and nitroglycerin consumption were significantly higher than when the patients were on metoprolol and practolol. No difference was found between the three beta-blockers with regard to total work or exercise time until 1 mm of S-T segment depression. Except for one patient who experienced a severe exanthema on practolol, the three beta-blockers were equally well tolerated.", 
    "20": "1. Dogs absorbed [14C]nadolol almost completely (88--104%) after oral administration of 10--75 mg/kg. In contrast, mice, rats, hamsters, and rabbits, given oral doses of 20 mg/kg, absorbed, at most, 25%. After administration of oral doses of 2--75 mg/kg, monkeys absorbed no more than an average of 30%. Six monkeys given oral doses of 10 mg/kg absorbed 12--44%. 2. In rats, [14C]nadolol was orally absorbed to an average of 13.7--17.5%, whether given in suspension or in solution, indicating that absorption was not limited by rate of dissolution nor by solubility. 3. Mildly hypertensive humans given single doses of [14C]nadolol (2 or 80 mg, orally) and normal subjects given single doses (10 mg, orally) absorbed an average of 20.4--33.3%.", 
    "21": "Mouse thymus cells possess a B2-adrenergic receptor and, when centrifuged through a solution of propanolol at 5 degrees and washed three times, will produce reduced amounts of cyclic AMP during a 5 minute challenge with isoproterenol at room temperature. Depending on the concentration and nature of the antagonist, the retained inhibition may be greater or less than that seen when it is added with the agonist. This retained inhibition is readily reversed at 37 degrees even in the absence of the agonist. These effects can also be demonstrated with rat erythrocytes and with their subsequently prepared ghosts making it most likely that they result from the specific and tight binding of the antagonist to the beta receptor.", 
    "22": "Iodinated analogues 2, 7, and 8 were prepared from propranolol, practolol, and acebutolol in 30--50% yields. Radioisotopic exchange between carrier-free Na125I and the molten iodinated beta-adrenergic antagonist yielded the corresponding 125I-labeled product. The biodistribution in rats, determined at 15 and 60 min postinjection, indicated that the radioiodinated analogues of the cardioselective drugs practolol and acebutolol localized to a greater degree in the liver and heart than the analogue of propranolol. Conversely, [125I]iodopropranolol (2) was concentrated to a greater extent in the lungs than [125I]iodopractolol (7) or [125I]iodoacebutolol (8). Therefore, 123I- or 131I-labeled cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonists, such as 7 or 8, may prove useful as radiodiagnostic agents for the external imaging of the myocardium.", 
    "23": "The synthesis is described of a seris of derivaties of 1-(aryloxy)-3-(arylthioalkylamiho)propan-2-ols and 1-(alkylthioamino)- and 1-(aralkylamino)-3-(aryloxy)propan-2-ols. These compounds were investigated for their beta-adrenoreceptor blocking properties and their selectivity of action for the cardiac beta1 receptor. The structure-activity relationships are discussed with particular reference to the effects of the sulfur, sulfoxide, and sulfone groups on beta-adrenoreceptor blocking potency and selectivity.", 
    "24": "The effects of the beta-receptor blocking agent propranolol (100 microgram/kg i.v.) and of the alpha-receptor blocking agent dihydroergotamine (50 microgram/kg i.v.) on hemodynamic responses to isoproterenol and norepinephrine (both 1--1024 ng/kg) were investigated in anesthetized dogs. The effects studied were: (1) flow in the ascending aorta and the coronary, common hepatic, gastroduodenal, splenic, cranial mesenteric, renal and femoral arteries: (2) maximal flow acceleration in the splenic, cranial mesenteric and femoral arteries; (3) maximal rate of change of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dt max). Propranolol shifted the dose-response curves for the isoproterenol-induced flow increases in the common hepatic, gastro-duodenal, and cranial mesenteric arteries to the right. It did not influence the flow responses to isoproterenol in the ascending aorta or the coronary, splenic, renal and femoral arteries. Propranolol prevented the decrease of arterial pressure evoked by isoproterenol. Propranolol shifted the isoproterenol-induced increase of LV dP/dt max and maximal blood flow to the same extent. Propranolol blocked the flow to the liver and gastrointestinal tract to a greater extent than the LV dP/dt max and maximal flow acceleration. Propranolol had no effect on the norepinephrine-induced increases in flow in the splenic, femoral and coronary arteries, but blocked the norepinephrine-evoked increases of flow accelerations and LV dP/dt max to the same extent. Dihydroergotamine inhibited the norepinephrine-induced increase in flow in the femoral artery and the decreases in flow in the hepatic, splenic, cranial mesenteric and renal arteries, and reversed the reduction of flow in the gastroduodenal artery. It is argued that dihydroergotamine may inhibit the increase in femoral flow through two mechanisms: (1) blocking the flow reduction to norepinephrine in the abdomen, and thereby passively shunting blood from the abdomen in preference to the femoral bed; (2) attenuating the norepinephrine-evoked reflexogenic femoral vasodilatation. It is concluded that: (1) propranolol is a beta-receptor blocking agent with a preference for blockade of isoproterenol-induced vascular effects; (2) norepinephrine-induced flow increases are not direct actions on vascular beta-receptors; (3) the increase of maximal blood flow accelerations after isoproterenol and norepinephrine is mediated by stimulation of cardiac beta-receptors; (4) dihydroergotamine is an alpha-receptor blocking agent particularly in the splanchnic vascular region.", 
    "25": "The convoluted tubular cells of the male mouse submandibular gland contain many serous-like granules in their apical cytoplasm. The autonomic regulation of the secretory process of the contents of these granules was studied by the following two methods: (1) immunochemical method using an antiserum specific to the granular components; and (2) histometric observations using light and electron microscopes. The results obtained by these two methods were well in agreement. When male mice were administered either phenylephrine or norepinephrine, the amount of granules in the glands significantly decreased. These two adrenergic stimulators were very effective, whereas synephrine was less effective. When mice were injected with a beta-adrenergic agent(isoproterenol) or a parasympathomimetic agent (pilocarpine), the amount of granules in the glands did not change. The alpha-adrenergic blockers phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine almost completely neutralized the effect of alpha-adrenergic agents on the glands, whereas another alpha-blocker (ergotamine) was less effective. These facts suggest that the secretion of the granular components is mediated by way of alpha-adrenergic receptor sites in the glands.", 
    "26": "6,7-Dihydroxy-2-dimethylaminotetralin (TL-99), the 5,6-dihydroxy isomer (M-7) and dopamine were studied for cardiovascular activity in the cat and dog. TL-99 was found to be the most active of these compounds. Some of the more striking actions of TL-99 and M-7 were bradycardia, hypotension and complete blockade of norepinephrine-induced reflex activation. A detailed study of these compounds showed that they were most likely exerting their effects by inhibiting sympathetic nervous system activity. Whether these compounds were activating dopamine receptors or alpha adrenergic receptors is not entirely clear from this study.", 
    "27": "Four new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents carrying tyramine as the amino moiety were synthesized and the distribution of their I-125-tagged derivatives evaluated in rats. This distribution was compared with the distribution of various agonists and antagonists labeled with H-3 and C-14, and with the in vitro binding affinity of the new derivatives. A radioiodinated derivative of a cardioselective blocker, alprenolol, showed poor blood clearance and no cardiac selectivity. A derivative of another cardioselective blocker, practolol, showed a promising heart-to-blood ratio (ca. 19) and cardioselectivity with a heart-to-lung ratio of ca. 2. Two additional practolol analogs showed no improvement over the practolol derivative; because of the increased lipophilicity of these derivatives, blood clearance and cardioselectivity were diminished. An inverse correlation is suggested between the dissociation constant for the beta adrenoceptor in the lung and the heart-to-blood and heart-to-lung values. We conclude that polarity plays an important role in the blood clearance and cardioselectivity of these beta-adrenoceptor derivatives.", 
    "28": "A Phase I evaluation of a new adrenoceptor blocker, pamatolol, was performed in 10 healthy male volunteers. Minor reductions in standing and exercise and isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate were observed with the 10-mg oral dose and appeared maximal with the 400-600 mg dose. The rate of decline of effect averaged 1.5% of the exercise heart rate/hr. Neither resting systolic time intervals nor post-exercise pulmonary function was affected by this dose range of pamatolol. Based on the latter responses and the isoproterenol dose response curve, we tentatively conclude that pamatolol is relatively cardioselective in man.", 
    "29": "An open study of the effectiveness of metoprolol in reducing the blood pressures of 13 hypertensive patients was conducted. It was found that metoprolol reduced the patients' blood pressure satisfactorily, and is well tolerated within the dose range of 100 mg to 400 mg daily.", 
    "30": "(+/-)-[3H]Epinephrine binds to beta-receptors in calf cerebellar and rat lung membranes in the presence of 1.0 mM pyrocatechol and 1.0 microM phentolamine, with dissociation constants at 4 degrees C of 11 nM and 24 nM, respectively. (+/-)-[3H]Epinephrine associates to equilibrium within 20 min in both tissues, and over 50% of the binding is rapidly dissociable. Inhibition of binding by agonists and antagonists is highly stereoselective, and the structure-activity relationships of adrenergic agents in inhibiting (+/-)-[3H]epinephrine binding suggest an interaction with beta2 type noradrenergic receptors. (-)-Isoproterenol has an apparent Ki of 2 nM, (-)-epinephrine is 1.5 to 3 times weaker, and (-)-norepinephrine is 30 to 60 times weaker. Salbutamol and terbutaline, selective beta2-agonists, are potent inhibitors of binding, as are several nonspecific antagonists. Properties of the sites labeled by (+/-)-[3H]epinephrine in calf cerebellum and rat lung are closely similar. (-)-[3H]Dihydroalprenolol binding in calf cerebellum and rat lung also shows beta2 characteristics. Antagonists have similar potencies in inhibiting (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol and (+/-)-[3H]epinephrine binding in both tissues, but agonists are in general more potent inhibitors of (+/-)-[3H]epinephrine. Sodium and lithium selectively lower the affinity of (+/-)-[3H]epinephrine at its binding sites and the affinities of agonists, but not antagonists, at the (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol site. Specific (+/-)-[3H]epinephrine binding was not detectable in calf cortex and rat heart, where (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding suggests a beta1-receptor. A physiological significance of (+/-)-[3H]epinephrine binding is suggested by the strong correlation for agonists and antagonists between affinities in inhibiting binding, and in stimulating or inhibiting a beta-receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase in frog erythrocytes.", 
    "31": "1. Cytochrome P/450-dependent mixed function oxidations of hexobarbital, phenyramidol, and alprenolol in intact hepatocytes were examined at different steady state oxygen concentrations. Apparent Kmo2 values were determined to be 6.4 +/- 1.7, 3.6 +/- 0.6, and 9.8 +/- 1.2 micronM, respectively. 2. Apparent Kmo2 values for metabolism of hexobarbital and alprenolol by liver microsomes were 4.3 +/- 0.4 and 8.7 +/- 0.7 micronM, similar to the corresponding values for whole cells. Therefore, no detectable gradient of O2 concentration exists between extracellular space and endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes at these oxygen concentrations. 3. Steady state concentrations of ATP, ADP, AMP, lactate, and pyruvate at different steady state oxygen concentrations were used as indicators of mitochondrial oxygen dependence in intact hepatocytes. Half-maximal changes occurred at [O2] = 12.6 micronM for cytoplasmic [NAD+]/[NADH] (estimated from [lactate]/[pyruvate]), at 7.0 micronM for [ATP]/[ADP], and at 2.8 micronM for adenylate energy charge. The apparent cellular respiratory Kmo2 was 1.90 +/- 0.18 micronM. 4. Comparison of values for oxygen dependence of mitochondrial functions in isolated hepatocytes with published values for isolated mitochondria suggests that a substantial intracellular oxygen gradient exists between the outer cellular membrane and the mitochondrial inner membrane at po2 values below the critical O2 tensions.", 
    "32": "The effects of the muscarinic cholinergic agonist methacholine on affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors for isoproterenol and on isoproterenol-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity were assessed in canine myocardium. GTP and guanyl-5'-yl imidoiphosphate both decreased the affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors for isoproterenol without altering the affinity of these receptors for propranolol. Methacholine (10 nM to 10 micronM) antagonized the guanine nucleotide-induced reduction in beta-adrenergic receptor affinity for isoproterenol. This effect of methacholine was reversed by atropine. The choline ester had no effect on the affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors for isoproterenol in the absence of guanine nucleotides. Likewise, methacholine had no effect on the affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors for propranolol, either in the presence or absence of guanine nucleotides. Methacholine also attenuated GTP-induced activation of adenylate cyclase or isoproterenol-induced activation of the enzyme in the presence of GTP. The effects of methacholine on myocardial adenylate cyclase activity were apparent only in the presence of GTP. These effects were also reversed by atropine. The choline ester had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity in the presence of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate or NaF. The results of the present study suggest that muscarinic cholinergic agonists can regulate both beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase by modulating the effects of GTP.", 
    "33": "The pharmacology of the beta-adrenergic antagonists, particularly their role as competitive antagonists at the receptor site, is discussed. The clinical use of these agents is listed and a detailed outline of their use in angina pectoris, hypertension and conditions associated with increased sympathetic activity is provided. The relative contraindications to the use of beta-adrenergic antagonists are summarized and the pharmacology of those drug interactions involving these agents is discussed. A thorough understanding of the pharmacology and therapeutics of these agents, which interfere with physiological function, is mandatory prior to their clinical use.", 
    "34": "The undecapeptide eledoisin caused vigorous and copious drinking within a minute or two of injection into the pigeon forebrain. Systemic injections of the same doses were ineffective. The relative efficacy of eledoisin and angiotensin II as dipsogens in the pigeon was similar to that of carbachol and angiotensin II in the rat. The related peptides eledoisin hexapeptide, physalaemin and substance P also caused some drinking, but they were less effective than eledoisin. In the rat none of these substances caused drinking. On the contrary eledoisin and substance P were found to depress angiotensin-induced drinking, but carbachol-induced drinking was not depressed to the same extent by these peptides. The preferential depression of angiotensin II-induced drinking resembles the effects of other vasoplegic drugs on this response in the rat, and may be related to the potent vasodilator properties of these peptides.", 
    "35": "Human CSF cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP have been measured as possible indicators of activity of central neurotransmitter-sensitive adenylate or guanylate cyclase. In an attempt to help to identify the specific neurotransmitter systems of origin of human CSF cyclic AMP and GMP, we studied Parkinson patients with and without L-dopa therapy and schizophrenic patients before and after propranolol therapy. No effect of L-dopa or propranolol was found on CSF cyclic nucleotides. However, Parkinson patients had a 40-50% reduction of CSF cyclic AMP and a 80-90% reduction of CSF cyclic GMP compared with the schizophrenic patients. Implications of this finding are discussed.", 
    "36": "The thermoregulatory effects of dopamine (DA), given by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection to sheep, have been examined and compared with those of i.c.v. noradrenaline (NA). At ambient temperatures (Ta) of 20 degrees and 30 degrees C both DA (200 nmol . kg-1) and NA (100 nmol . kg-1) induced constriction of the ear vessels, a decrease in respiratory frequency and an increase in rectal temperature (Tr). At Ta of 10 degrees and 0 degrees C both substances caused a decrease in heat production and a fall in Tr. The DA receptor blocker spiroperone (30 nmol . kg-1, i.c.v.), which itself had a vasodilatatory effect at 20 degrees C Ta, blocked the peripheral vasoconstriction and slightly attenuated the rise in Tr normally caused by i.c.v. DA or NA at this Ta, but did not eliminate the suppression of respiratory frequency. During i.c.v. infusion, at 20 degrees C Ta, with the DA-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor FLA-63, the effect of i.c.v. DA on Tr was attenuated, while that of NA was enhanced. These results suggest that in sheep central thermoregulatory system there are DA receptors which stimulate the pathway that controls peripheral vasomotor tone. The inhibitory effect of NA and DA on heat production and evaporative heat loss is probably mediated by noradrenergic receptors, which can also be activated by DA both directly and after its conversion to NA.", 
    "37": "The effects of phenylephrine on the shape of the contraction curve and on the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (c-AMP) content were studied in electrically driven (frequency 0.2 Hz) cat papillary muscles. All experiments were done in the presence of 1 micron propranolol in order to minimize interference from beta-adrenoceptors. 1. Phenylephrine increased the force of contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. Maximal effects (about 200% of control) occurred at 30 micron phenylephrine. 2. The positive inotropic effect (PIE) of phenylephrine was antagonized by phentolamine. Phentolamine, 5 micron, produced a parallel shift of the concentration-response curve for the PIE of phenylephrine by about two log units to the right. 3. The PIE of 30 micron phenylephrine occurred without any detectable increase in the c-AMP levels of the preparations. 4. The PIE of 30 micron phenylephrine developed about three times more slowly than the PIE of an equieffective concentration of isoprenaline. 5. The PIE of phenylephrine was accompanied by significant, concentration-dependent increases in both time to peak force and relaxation time. 6. It is concluded that the PIE of phenylephrine in the presence of propranolol is mediated mainly by a stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors. It is unlikely to be related to an increase in c-AMP. With respect to time course and influence on the shape of the contraction curve it is qualitatively different from the effects of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. These data are taken to support the hypothesis that the mechanical effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulating agents on the heart are produced by different mechanisms.", 
    "38": "DL-N-(2-Hydroxy-3-napthyloxypropyl)-N'-dansylethylenediamine, dansyl analogue of propranolol (DAPN) is a novel fluorescent beta-adrenergic antagonist with high affinity to beta-receptors. The distribution pattern of DAPN fluorescence was studied in the rat central nervous system subsequent to its intravenous administration to living rats. DAPN distinctly labels specific regions and cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Highly dense DAPN fluorescence was observed in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, the basal layers of the piriform cortex and the neocortex, the cerebellar Purkinje cell layer, and the spinal a-motoneurons. Pretreatment of control rats with DL-and L-propranolol markedly decreased the intensity and density of DAPN fluorescence in the tissue sections, whereas prior administration of D-propranolol had almost no effect. Pretreatment with large doses of reserpine did not alter the pattern of DAPN fluorescence. These findings were identical to those observed with another fluorescent beta-blocker, 9-aminoacridino-propranolol (9-AAP). Our data suggest that fluorescent beta-adrenergic antagonists may be used in vivo for the direct probing of the beta-receptors within the mammalian CNS.", 
    "39": "Hypertonic sodium chloride and tris(hydroxymethyl)amino-methane (Tris) hydrochloride (0.3 mmol/kg.min) were infused intravenously into chloralose-anesthetized dogs over a 20-min period. Cardiac output, maximum left ventricular dP/dt, and (dP/dt)/P increased by 55, 33, and 23%, respectively, during NaCl infusion, but Tris HCl infusion had no effects. NaCl infusion did not change heart rate or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Mean systemic and pulmonry arterial blood pressures increased, whereas total peripheral and pulmonary vascular resistances decreased. Responsiveness of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors, as determined by serial intravenous injections of epinephrine, was not affected by NaCl infusion. Plasma catecholamine concentration, however, increased during NaCl infusion. In addition, the increases in cardiac output, maximum left ventricular dP/dt and (dP/dt)/P were abolished by prior treatment with practolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent. These results suggest that the hemodynamic effects of NaCl infusion were caused, at least in part, by the inotropic action of catecholamines.", 
    "40": "The density but not the affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors declined significantly with age in rat pineal gland, corpus striatum, and cerebellum, as determined by the binding of tritiated dihydroalprenolol. Exposing rats to light for 12 hours increased the binding of this radioligand in 3-month-old but not in 24-month-old rats. The reduced responsiveness to catecholamines seen in aging may be due to a decrease in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors which, in turn, may be caused by an impaired capacity of receptors in aged animals to adapt to changes in adrenergic neuronal input.", 
    "41": "From results of the study of 37 patients with cardiac neurosis, new conceptual relationships to explain this condition are developed. Cardiac neurosis is explained as a disturbance of the \"psycho-neurovegetative self-regulation mechanism\" (servomechanisms). The authors show how such a conception, which has been borrowed from the servomechanism technique, may favourably influence the diagnosis and therapy of this condition. It has been tried in that way to link the two opposites: organic and functional causes. Some therapeutic approaches adapted to the structure of everyday general medical practice are suggested.", 
    "42": "The specific use of psychotropic agents in myocardial infarction has become possible due to interdisciplinary cooperation. Especially the differentiated therapeutic application of benzodiazepine derivatives will take into better account the different psychopathologic states in the various phases. The medicamentous facilities are extended by using the central and peripheral effects of the beta-blockers. After a myocardial infarction there are various somatic and mental symptoms. This requires precise medical and psychological management with reference to a diagnostic and combined-therapeutic schedule of treatment. An intensive co-operation with all medical departments is a conditio sine qua non.", 
    "43": "HeLa cells contain receptors on their surface which are beta-adrenergic in nature. The binding of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol is rapid, reversible, stereospecific and of relatively high affinity. The HeLa cells also contain an adenylate cyclase which is activated by (-)-isoproterenol greater than (-)-epinephrine greater than (-)-norepinephrine. The adenylate cyclase of HeLa is also activated by guanyl-5'-ylimidodophosphate (Gpp(NH)p), a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP. Inclusion of both (-)-isoproterenol and Gpp(NH)p leads to approximately additive rather than synergistic activation of adenylate cyclase. After treatment of HeLa cells with 5mM sodium butyrate there is an increase in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors, but not in their affinity, which is reflected in an increased ability of (-)-isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase. Other properties of the beta-adrenergic receptor including association and dissociation rates, temperature optimum of adenylate cyclase and response to Gpp(NH)p are relatively unaffected by butyrate pretreatment of the cells.", 
    "44": "The regulation of adrenergic receptors in rat heart was measured in rats made hyperthyroid by injection with thyroxine and made hypothyroid by addition of propylthiouracil to the drinking water. Hyperthyroid rats display cardiac hypertrophy and a decrease in epididymal fat pad weight. The maximal beta-receptor level of ventricular membranes, as determined by (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding, was increased 60% by thyroxine treatment and decreased about 30% by propylthiouracil treatment. The affinity of the beta receptor was unchanged after thyroxine or propylthiouracil treatment. The maximal activity of the isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) varied with thyroid state in a manner parallel to the increase in beta-adrenergic binding sites. Thyroxine treatment also increases by 2-fold the beta receptors in isolated rat fat cells. Propylthiouracil treatment lowered the level of alpha receptors in heart by 30% as measured by [3H]dihydroergocryptine binding, but increased the affinity about 2.5-fold. The highest level of alpha receptors was seen in control hearts. These studies indicate that thyroxine may control the turnover of beta-adrenergic receptors in heart and fat cells and regulate physiological responses in these tissues via a hormone-hormone interplay system. Thyroxine treatment reduced the activity of the membrane-bound Mg2+-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) and 5'-mononucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5) but appears to increase the activity of the (Na+ + K+)ATPase (EC 3.6.1.4).", 
    "45": "Racemic and dextro forms of propranolol were equipotent in their anticonvulsant activity in normal rats by the MES test. In an attempt to determine any difference in the anticonvulsant activity of the two forms a variety of adrenergic agents were used, viz. phenoxybenzamine, reserpine, alphamethyl dopa and acetazolamide. There was no difference between the two forms, in the absence or presence of several adrenergic drugs employed. However, racemic but not dextro propranolol reduced MET, in normal as well as in nialamide primed rats.", 
    "46": "Arterial and coronary sinus noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) concentrations, cardiac output, pulmonary artery oxygen saturation (PAO2), coronary sinus oxygen saturation, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and arterial pressure were examined in 21 patients with ischaemic heart disease at rest and during exercise before and after intravenous propranolol. The heart had a net uptake of A and a net release of NA. It can be estimated that at least 50% of NA in the coronary sinus derived from the heart. NA in the coronary sinus and in the arterial blood originated therefore, at least partially, in different tissues. The NA concentration showed close correlation with PAO2, but not with cardiac index or arterial blood pressure. Multiple regression analysis also revealed a relationship between LVEDP and arterial and coronary sinus NA independent of PAO2. A very close correlation between arterial and coronary sinus NA (r = 0.93, P less than 0.001) indicates that they are largely controlled by the same factors.", 
    "47": "Within the rostral diencephalon of the cat, 113 sites were examined for their reactivity to 2.33--14.0 microgram dopamine (DA) or 2.33--14.0 microgram norepinephrine (NE) microinjected in a volume of 0.75 microliter. During each experiment, colonic temperature was monitored and additional physiological measures were recorded continuously. In contrast to CSF controls, an intrahypothalamic injection of either catecholamine at circumscribed sites evoked a dose-dependent fall in the cat's body temperature, with NE ordinarily evoking a more profound hypothermic response. The morphological sites of maximum sensitivity were localized in the anterior hypothalamic, preoptic region. At some but not all sites, a prior microinjection of 3.5--7.0 microgram phentolamine attenuated the magnitude of the DA-induced hypothermia and delayed its onset. Conversely, at all loci, the pretreatment by the injection of this alpha-adrenergic antagonist markedly reduced the absolute magnitude of the NE-induced fall in the cat's temperature. Similar pretreatment of a reactive hypothalamic locus with a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, practolol (3.5 microgram), failed to alter the hypothermia following a microinjection of DA. Either of two DA receptor antagonists, haloperidol (0.04--7.0 microgram) or d-butaclamol (0.48--1.47 microgram), when given in a sufficient dose, effectively delayed the onset of the DA-hypothermia and reduced its absolute magnitude; however, the NE-induced decline in the cat's temperature was unaffected by DA receptor blockade. Endogenous stores of DA and/or NE in the cat's hypothalamus were radio-labeled with either 3H- or 14C-catecholamines or both, microinjected through the implanted guide tube into an identified amine-sensitive site. By using push-pull cannulae, the site was subsequently perfused for 5 min with artificial CSF at a rate of 25 microliter/min with samples collected at 15 min intervals. During either the third or fourth perfusion, the ambient temperature of the cat's chamber of 22--24 degrees C was elevated to 35--45 degrees C and maintained at this level for 15 or 30 min. This environmental warming evoked a release of either DA o; NE or both amines from certain circumscribed sites within the cat's rostral hypothalamus. Overall, these results provide pharmacological, physiological and anatomical evidence for a differential role of DA in the hypothalamic mechanism which mediates the heat loss processes.", 
    "48": "The leakage of enzymes from the myocardial cell can be used as an index of the onset and severity of tissue damage. A study has been carried out using the isolated perfused hypoxic rat heart in which the ability of various doses of isoprenaline, dobutamine, propranolol, glucose, insulin, mannitol, adenosine triphosphate and hydrocortisone to increase or decrease myocardial enzyme leakage has been evaluated.", 
    "49": "The influence of routine administration of the beta adrenoceptor blocking drug practolol on the outcome of acute myocardial infarction has been studied in 94 patients. The study was restricted to patients under the age of 70 experiencing their first myocardial infarction and in whom there was no contraindication to beta blockade. In the treated group an initial dose intravenous practolol 15 mg was followed by five oral doses of practolol 200 mg at 12 h intervals. A significant reduction in heart rate and systolic blood pressure was apparent in the treated group within 2 h. No difference was detectable in the course of the acute stage of the illness between treated and control patients, apart from a significant reduction in the incidence of atrial fibrillation among those receiving practolol. Patients with inferior infarctions showed a tendency to develop potentially harmful bradycardia and hypotension on receiving practolol which lead to withdrawal of the drug in many cases. At regular review over 7 mth no detectable difference emerged between the treated and control groups in the incidence of cardiac failure, death or reinfarction.", 
    "50": "1. Levodopa, dopamine, noraderanaline and adrenaline (in increasing order of potency) depressed the tension and degree of fusion of incomplete tetanic contractions of the slow-contracting soleus muscle in chloralose-anaesthetized cats. 2. The effects of all compounds were antagonized by propranolol (50-20 microgram/kg), but not practolol (1.0-5.0 mg/kg). This indicates that effects are mediated by beta2-adrenoceptor stimulation. 3. The effect of levodopa, but not of the catecholamines, was antagonized by prior administration of the dopa decarboxylase inhibitior benserazide. This indicates that levodopa itself is inactive, whereas its decarbodylated metabolites are active. 4. The depressant action of beta-adrenoceptor agonists on incomplete tetanic contractions of the cat soleus muscle, which are exerted directly on the muscle fibres, is a model for effects exerted on slow-contracting units of human muscles; the latter effects probably underlie the tremor observed after beta-adrenoceptor agonist administration. 5. These results therefore suggest that levodopa, via its decarboxylated metabolites, dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline, may produce or exacerabate tremor in man. Thus in Parkinsonian patients any centrally induced relief of tremor that levodopa may produce may be masked by tremorogenic effects of such metabolites exerted in the periphery.", 
    "51": "Spontaneous electrical activity of the intestine smooth muscle of the cat consisted of slow waves and spikes. The spike activity and the slow wave generation were inhibited by pentagastrin and tetragastrin. Phasic contraction corresponding with the electrical activity was also abolished by pentagastrin and tetragastrin. Adrenaline showed the inhibitory action on the spike activity and phasic contraction, but slow waves persisted against adrenaline. Propranolol depressed this inhibitory action produced by adrenaline, while it did not block the inhibitory action by pentagastrin. The inhibitory effect of pentagastrin was not influenced by caffeine or theophylline. Imidazole depressed slightly the inhibitory action of pentagastrin. Verapamil inhibited the spike activity. Additional application of pentagastrin after verapamil produced further inhibition of both slow wave generation and phasic contraction. These results suggest that the inhibitory action produced by pentagastrin on the electrical and mechanical activities is directly on the smooth muscle cell membrane mediated through a mechanism other than via beta-receptors. It is also suggested that the primary action of pentagastrin is to inhibit the generation of slow waves of the intestinal smooth muscle.", 
    "52": "Tooth germs harvested from 6-day-old rats were incubated in a 45Ca-containing medium for 6 hours. The addition of PTH consistently stimulated the increase in 45Ca uptake, while calcitonin significantly reduced both the PTH-stimulated incorporation and the spontaneous one. Dibutyrul CAMP (3.5 mM) had no effects. Propranolol significantly inhibited the spontaneous and stimulated 45Ca uptake. Results obtained support the concept that the two hormones have a clear influence on calcium entering the tooth germs in full calcification process probably by early membrane effect.", 
    "53": "Pregnant rats, treated with high doses of propranolol, gave birth to small for dates neonates. Litter size was affected in daily doses of 100 and 150 mg/kg/day. Propranolol markedly influenced the gain in weight normally observed in pregnant rats. The placentas of the rats which received the higher doses of propranolol weighed about 30% less than normal placentas. Pregnant rats, treated with propranolol, gave birth to small for dates neonates. This effect is possibly the result of a drug-induced reduction in transport across cellular membranes, resulting in malnutrition. Since similar effects were reported in humans, treatment with propranolol during pregnancy should be further reevaluated in laboratory animals."
