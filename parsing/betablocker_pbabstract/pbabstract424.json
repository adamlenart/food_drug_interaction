Variations in endogenous peroxidase were observed in electron microscopy. The activity of endogenous peroxidase can be used according to our results as tracer of the autonomic innervation of the vocal cord.", 
    "1": "Chronic measurements of systemic arterial blood pressure and heart rate via a chronically implanted telemetric transmitter in unrestrained rats, was validated in a three-phase study. In the first part, week-to-week variability of systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures, and heart rate was found to be minimal over the course of nine weeks. In the second part, the reproducibility of cardiovascular response to three successive administration of sotalol, an antihypertensive agent, was studied. In the last part, cardiovascular parameters determined by telemetry were compared to those obtained by direct arterial catheterization and showed a good linear correlation between those two methods.", 
    "2": "The diffusion of drug substance in a closed three-compartment model through a mucus layer to equilibrium is simulated by available pharmacokinetic programs. The obtained curves conform very well to the values experimentally found. If mucus is replaced by buffer solution an explicit equation from the literature, the method used and the experimental findings give the same results. Examination of the rate constants k1 for the diffusion in, kD through and k2 from the mucus shows the significance of the relation k1/k2 > 1, = 1, < 1 as a measure for the affinity of the active agent to the mucus. The discussion of the kinetic parameters shows, as in previous results, no criterion for assuming specific mucus binding. Because of its unspecifity the usual term \"mucus binding\" should be replaced by \"mucus retention\".", 
    "3": "We determined the effects of continuous cardiac vagal nerve stimulation on atrial contractility and on heart rate in mongrel dogs in which we blocked the muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors. Each dog received atropine, 0.5 mg/kg and propranolol, 0.5-1 mg/kg. We stimulated the cardiac vagus nerves in each dog for three separate 5-min periods at frequencies of 0 (control), 20, and 40 Hz (5 ms, 15 V) and measured the changes in atrial contractility and heart rate. Vagal nerve stimulation increased right atrial contractility from the control value by 27% at 20 Hz and by 19% during stimulation at 40 Hz (P < 0.001). Vagal nerve stimulation also increased the heart rate from 114 +/- 5 beats/min during the control period to 146 +/- 10 beats/min (P < 0.01) during stimulation at a frequency of 20 Hz and to 140 +/- 11 beats/min (P < 0.05) during stimulation at 40 Hz. Injection of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) antagonist, [4Cl-D-Phe6,Leu17]VIP, directly into the dog right coronary artery in concentrations of 0 (control), 2, and 4 micrograms/kg did not influence spontaneous atrial contractility or the heart rate. However, 4 micrograms/kg of the VIP antagonist significantly reduced the augmentation in right atrial contractility and the increase in heart rate during vagal nerve stimulation. Our experiments suggest that cardiac vagal nerve stimulation, during muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, releases VIP or a 'VIP-like substance', that significantly augments atrial contractility and increases heart rate.", 
    "4": "The role of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor-mediated regulation of protein patterns in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes was studied with high resolution two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Spontaneously beating neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured for 72 h at 37 degrees C in serum-free medium, supplemented with either the catecholamine norepinephrine (0.1 microM), or with norepinephrine (0.1 microM) plus the alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin (1 microM), or with neither of these substances. In transmission light, 105 protein spots could be seen in the lysates from control cells, 244 spots were identified in lysates from norepinephrine-treated cells, and 114 protein species were counted in the case of lysates from cardiomyocytes which had been cultured in the presence of norepinephrine plus prazosin. This experimental approach allows a clear classification of alpha- and non-alpha (probably beta)-adrenoceptor-mediated catecholamine effects on protein synthesis in cardiomyocytes. In comparison with previous experiments (Chang et al., Electrophoresis, this issue, pp. 748-754), less protein species were identified in the untreated control cardiomyocytes, as well as in the norepinephrine treated cells. The only actual modification in the experimental setup in these two series was the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide--a substance known for its repressive effect on oncoprotein expression--to the culture medium, as solvent for prazosin.", 
    "5": "Experiments with 13- to 19-day-old chicken embryos maintained at 37 degrees C were conducted using direct registration of embryonic movements and amnion pulsation. It is shown that in the non-innervated and lacking blood vessels non-striated-muscled amnion, motoric activity could be observed nearly up to the end of the embryonic development, not only during 5 to 14 days old interval as it was supposed earlier. In accordance with our previous results indicating important role of biogenic amines (serotonin and noradrenaline) in the regulation of motoric activity of the chicken embryo amnion at earlier and middle ages, this study provides some evidences of the humoral regulatory mechanism even at later embryonic stages. After being injected into amniotic fluid of older embryos, the serotonin stimulates and noradrenaline inhibits amnion motoric activity (the both are taken at final concentration of 10(-7) to 10(-6) M). Serotonin's receptors blocator, the cyprogeptadin, suppress while beta-adrenoreceptors' blocator, the propranolol, activates intact amnion motorics ( both are taken at final concentration of 10(-7) to 10(-5) M).", 
    "6": "We compared the antihypertensive effects of acebutolol and metoprolol during 2-4 weeks of treatment in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Acebutolol (n = 12) significantly decreased conventionally measured blood pressure from 173/100 mmHg to 148/86 mmHg (p less than 0.005), and metoprolol (n = 11) decreased it from 164/106 mmHg to 138/87 mmHg (p less than 0.01). Based on data derived from automated 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, both drugs significantly decreased the blood pressure in the early morning (5:00-10:00). Moreover, in the metoprolol group, there were significant falls in day-time blood pressure (7:30-19:30) and night-time blood pressure (23:00-7:00). In contrast, acebutolol showed significant antihypertensive effect on day-time blood pressure, but not effect on night-time blood pressure. The study confirmed the efficacy and character of metoprolol and acebutolol. We must choose an effective beta-blocker when using an automated 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring system to get adequate blood pressure reduction for the whole 24 hours.", 
    "7": "We measured the permeability ratios (PX/PNa) of 3 wild-type, 1 hybrid, 2 subunit-deficient, and 22 mutant nicotinic receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes for alkali metal and organic cations using shifts in the bi-ionic reversal potential of the macroscopic current. Mutations at three positions (2', 6', 10') in M2 affected ion selectivity. Mutations at position 2' (alpha Thr244, beta Gly255, gamma Thr253, delta Ser258) near the intracellular end of M2 changed the organic cation permeability ratios as much as twofold and reduced PCs/PNa and PK/PNa by 16-18%. Mutations at positions 6' and 10' increased the glycine ethyl ester/Na+ and glycine methyl ester/Na+ permeability ratios. Two subunit alterations also affected selectivity: omission of the delta subunit reduced PCs/PNa by 16%, and substitution of Xenopus delta for mouse delta increased Pguanidinium/PNa more than twofold and reduced PCs/PNa by 34% and PLi/PNa by 20%. The wild-type mouse receptor displayed a surprising interaction with the primary ammonium cations; relative permeability peaked at a chain length equal to four carbons. Analysis of the organic permeability ratios for the wild-type mouse receptor shows that (a) the diameter of the narrowest part of the pore is 8.4 A; (b) the mouse receptor departs significantly from size selectivity for monovalent organic cations; and (c) lowering the temperature reduces Pguanidinium/PNa by 38% and Pbutylammonium/PNa more than twofold. The results reinforce present views that positions -1' and 2' are the narrowest part of the pore and suggest that positions 6' and 10' align some permeant organic cations in the pore in an interaction similar to that with channel blocker, QX-222.", 
    "8": "Depression and sexual dysfunction have been related to side effects of topical beta-blockers. We performed a preliminary study in order to determine any difference between a non selective beta-blocker (timolol) and a selective beta-blocker (betaxolol) regarding CNS side effects. Eight glaucomatous patients chronically treated with timolol 0.5%/12h, suffering from depression diagnosed through DMS-III-R criteria, were included in the study. During the six-month follow up, depression was quantified through the Beck and Zung-Conde scales every two months. In a double blind cross-over study with control group, the patients under timolol treatment presented higher depression values measured through the Beck and the Zung-Conde scales (p < 0.001 vs control). These results suggest that betaxolol could be less of a depression-inducer than timolol in predisposed patients.", 
    "9": "This single-blind, randomized study investigated the effects of unilateral instillation of 0.5% maleate timolol twice a day for 7 days on visual-field parameters of both eyes. Twelve normal, young subjects (30.6 +/- 4.2 years) participated in this study. Using program G1 of the Octopus 500 automated perimeter, the visual fields were measured one week and one day before therapy and a third time one week after beginning therapy. The paired T-test was used for statistical analysis, where a P-value < or = 0.05 indicated significance. Whereas nothing statistically significant was found in the treated eyes, the contralateral, untreated eyes showed a statistically significant decrease of mean sensitivity between the first visual fields and the third ones (P < 0.01) This diminution of mean sensitivity in the untreated contralateral eyes may be due to statistically significant lowering of blood pressure (P < 0.01) and slowing of cardiac frequency, which were not compensated by a local decrease of intraocular pressure. If confirmed, these findings could be of clinical importance in the management of glaucoma patients, since some authors have, in some cases, recommended a unilateral therapy.", 
    "10": "Eyes treated with a topical betablocker may exhibit the phenomenon of longterm drift, leading to loss of intraocular pressure control. It has been suggested that discontinuation of the betablocker may restore sensitivity to betablocker therapy, and that this phenomenon might be enhanced by the administration of an adrenergic agonist during this holiday period. This study was set up to examine further this hypothesis. Nine patients with ocular hypertension receiving treatment with timolol were entered into the study. Timolol was discontinued then re-started after four weeks of treatment with dipivefrin. This treatment cycle was repeated after a further four weeks. IOP was measured every two weeks. Re-introduction of timolol was associated with a significant lowering of IOP at two weeks (3.2 mmHg in the first cycle, p < 0.01, 3.4 mmHg in the second cycle, p < 0.01). Discontinuation of timolol and treatment with dipivefrin was not associated with a significant change in IOP.", 
    "11": "This study reports the findings of one of the stages of a programme for the detection and control of arterial hypertension, started in 1980 in an automobile company with a workforce of 9,782. In the initial screening, 522 hypertensive males were found using epidemiological criteria and 206 of these fulfilled the criteria of definite hypertension. The objective of this study consisted of evaluating, 9 years after the start of the program, the indirect cost in terms of the reduction in the morbidity indicator-temporary work incapacity (TWI). Analysis is based on a comparison of the prevalence of hypertension in the population when the program was begun (6%) and in 1989 (9.8%). It can be observed that the TWI rate of the hypertensive population was significantly higher than that of the rest of the workforce, and that this remained true for the reference group (RG) hypertensives a year after the study was initiated. In contrast, the intervention group (IG) showed significantly lower TWI levels, not only in comparison with the RG but also with the rest of the workers. The estimated reduction in TWI for 1989 was 4.500 days/year, which corresponds to an estimated saving of 76.500.000 pesetas/year.", 
    "12": "1. Glomerular epithelial cells (GEC) were cultured from human kidneys and immunologically characterized. 2. The effect of extracellular nucleotides on the cytosolic free calcium activity [Ca2+]i was investigated with the fura-2 microfluorescence method. Extracellular UTP, UDP, UMP, ATP, adenosine 5'-O-(3-thio)-trisphosphate (ATP-gamma-S), inosine-triphosphate (ITP), guanyltriphosphate (GTP), 2-methylthio-ATP, AMP, alpha,beta-methylene-ATP and adenosine led to a rapid, transient, concentration-dependent increase of [Ca2+]i, followed by a plateau above the baseline level. 3. In a calcium-free extracellular solution, the rapid increase of [Ca2+]i was still present, whereas the plateau level was abolished. 4. ATP and UTP (ED50 both: 10(-5) M) stimulated inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) formation in GEC. 5. The order of potency for the purine nucleotides in stimulating InsP3 formation was ATP = ATP-gamma-S greater than ADP greater than 2-methylthio-ATP greater than AMP = a,beta methylene-ATP = adenosine. 6. The increase of InsP3 induced by ATP (10(-5) M) could be inhibited by the P2 receptor blocker suramin (greater than 10(-4) M). Reactive blue 2 exhibited a weak stimulating effect on the InsP3 formation and only a weak inhibitory effect at a concentration of 10(-3) M was observed. 7. Protein kinase C activation by preincubation of GEC with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 ng ml-1, 15 min) abolished the effect of ATP (10(-5) M) on InsP3 formation. Downregulation of protein kinase C by long term incubation (18 h) with PMA had no significant effect on the phosphoinositol turnover induced by ATP.8. The results indicate that an increase of [Ca2+]i and inositol phosphate breakdown can be mediated via activation of a P2 receptor in human GEC.", 
    "13": "There is now substantial clinical evidence to suggest that portal hypertensive gastropathy is an important source of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with portal hypertension. Although a relatively uncommon presenting feature in such patients, it appears to become progressively more frequent and important the longer such patients with bleeding oesophageal varices survive after treatment by endoscopic sclerotherapy. It is now being increasingly recognized as the most important cause of haemorrhage after oesophageal varices in such patients. The endoscopic and histological characteristics of the condition are now well established but from a clinical point of view it is important to distinguish it from a number of other disorders. The pathogenesis of portal hypertensive gastropathy is poorly understood; venous congestion secondary to portal hypertension undoubtedly plays an important role but this is not thought to account entirely for the condition since abnormalities in the arterial blood supply are also observed. Many abnormalities in gastric mucosal function have been reported but it is unclear whether these are secondary disturbances or whether they play an important primary role in the development of the condition. Animal studies to date have not been helpful due to the lack of a satisfactory experimental model. Portocaval shunt surgery cures portal hypertensive gastropathy but propranolol has been shown to be highly effective in controlling haemorrhage from this condition and should now be considered the treatment of choice. The mechanism of action is unclear, and it remains to be shown whether other beta-blockers, or indeed any other drugs, are useful in treating this disorder.", 
    "14": "Between 1975 and 1985, 454 patients with hypertension were admitted to the Renal Unit of the Hospital for Sick Children. A total of 110 (24%) patients presented with severely raised blood pressures deemed to require emergency management. At presentation 84/110 had symptoms and signs of long standing hypertension with neurological involvement. Between 1975 and 1980 bolus intravenous injections of diazoxide and/or hydralazine were used with the aim of reducing the blood pressure to within the normal range for age in the first 12-24 hours after admission. Of 57 patients treated in this way 13 developed hypotensive complications and four, whose blood pressures returned to normal within 24 hours of admission, suffered irreversible neurological damage. Subsequently, the management changed to the use of intravenous infusions of labetalol (1-3 mg/kg/hour) and/or sodium nitroprusside (0.5-8 micrograms/kg/min) to enable a more gradual controlled reduction of blood pressure over the first 96 hours of admission. Between 1980 and 1985, 53 patients were treated using this regimen. In all cases blood pressure reduction was achieved in a more controlled manner without further neurological impairment or serious irreversible side effects. From our experience, the use of labetalol and sodium nitroprusside by incremental infusion in the critical early phase of management has resulted in improved control of accelerated hypertension without the sudden hypotensive episodes seen when bolus injections are used.", 
    "15": "Effects of L-threo and L-erythro-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine [DOPS, precursor amino acids for noradrenaline (NA)] on the learning performance in a maze paradigm designed to model on the water maze paradigm using a multicomputerized behavioral analysis system were studied. A marked facilitation of learning performance was observed in rats after an intraventricular injection of 5 micrograms L-threo-DOPS (the s-NA precursor), and this effect was inhibited by a simultaneous administration of 1 or 2 micrograms propranolol (a beta-adrenergic antagonist). As concentrations of brain NA, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, and normethanephrine were increased by the injection of 5 micrograms L-threo-DOPS, the effect seemed to be derived from activation of beta-adrenoceptors in the CNS by the formed s-NA. On the other hand, an intraventricular injection of 5 micrograms L-erythro-DOPS (the r-NA precursor) attenuated the learning performance, and this effect was probably caused by the formed r-NA from L-erythro-DOPS.", 
    "16": "The role of the multispecific bile acid transporter for cardiac glycoside uptake is still controversial. This study was designed to examine the inhibitory effects of basic drugs (verapamil, dipyridamole, nifedipine, chlorpromazine, disopyramide, quinidine, propranolol, and lidocaine) on taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes and to compare these effects with inhibition of ouabain uptake. Sodium-dependent taurocholate uptake was significantly reduced, to 50-70% of the control value, by 50 microM verapamil, dipyridamole, and nifedipine. Sodium-independent taurocholate uptake was more extensively inhibited, to 20-40%, by these basic drugs. The inhibition of ouabain uptake correlated better with sodium-independent taurocholate uptake (gamma = 0.918) than with sodium-dependent taurocholate uptake (gamma = 0.714). Taurocholate competitively inhibited ouabain uptake in the absence of sodium. These results indicate that the cardiac glycoside transport system is similar to the sodium-independent taurocholate transport system.", 
    "17": "The effects of ketanserin, atenolol and their association on portal vein pressure (PVP), portal and caval bile acid concentrations (PBA and CBA), and extraction ratio of bile acids (ER) after oral loading with chenodeoxycholic acid were investigated in anaesthetized cirrhotic rats. PVP was significantly reduced by ketanserin and by the association ketanserin plus atenolol; PBA was significantly decreased in all the treated groups, whereas the reduction of CBA was significant only in the rats treated with ketanserin and atenolol alone. ER was increased by atenolol and ketanserin, but it was not modified by their association. Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between PBA and CBA and between PVP and ER. These results suggest that, in anaesthetized cirrhotic rats, ketanserin reduces PVP probably through more complex mechanisms than the simple indirect reduction of portal flow, and that the association of ketanserin plus atenolol has no additive effect in reducing PVP.", 
    "18": "We encountered a 65-year-old female with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and mitral valve prolapse who had infective endocarditis and hemolytic anemia. The infecting organism of endocarditis was group A streptococci. With regard to the etiology of the hemolytic anemia, fragmentation hemolysis was considered because fragmented red cells and elevated lactic dehydrogenase were observed. Haptoglobin was markedly decreased. Coombs' test, Ham's test and abnormal hemoglobin were negative. She had not had a hemolytic attack in the past. Ultrasonic cardiography showed asymmetrical septal hypertrophy, mitral valve prolapse and 285 mmHg of calculated pressure gradient in the left ventricle. Cardiac catheterization showed 115 mmHg of left intraventricular pressure gradient and mitral regurgitation (grade 2). Hemolysis was slightly improved after treatment with propranolol. Thus, fragmentation of the normal red cells seemed to be due to shear stress.", 
    "19": "Calves perorally administered the beta-adrenergic agonist (beta-A) clenbuterol for 28 d were studied before, during, and after a 12-min treadmill exercise. During exercise on d 1 of clenbuterol administration, respiratory rate, respiratory minute volume, and heart rate and blood glucose, lactate, and insulin concentrations increased more in beta-A-treated calves than in controls. Oxygen extraction rate and growth hormone concentrations were lower in clenbuterol-treated calves, whereas oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and blood cortisol concentration increased similarly in the absence and presence of the beta-A. After 2 wk of daily clenbuterol administration, respiratory rate and respiratory minute volume during exercise were still higher and oxygen extraction was still lower, whereas all other measures were similar to those in controls. The increased heart rate in response to isoproterenol after 3 wk of clenbuterol administration was reduced markedly in resting but only slightly in exercising animals, whereas heart rate reduction by propranolol during exercise was similar to that in controls. Seven days after withdrawal of clenbuterol, newly administered clenbuterol evoked the same effects as on d 1. In conclusion, there were marked reactions to the first clenbuterol treatment that were in part enhanced during treadmill exercise. After 2 wk of beta-A administration, animals responded much less to the beta-A and changes were not different from those in controls. Resensitization to the beta-A was observed 7 d after its withdrawal.", 
    "20": "Eight men with stable angina, a positive treadmill test, and demonstrated responsiveness to chronic oral isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) were studied after they had been taking effective doses of ISDN t.i.d. for at least 2 weeks. Exercise tests were performed every 1-2 h until 19.00 hours over one day after the 08.00 hours application of nitroglycerin patches in a previously titrated dose; on another day after the administration of ISDN capsules q5h; and on a third day after placebo patches and capsules. The mean necessary effective patch dose was 125 cm2 (60-220 cm2). The mean exercise duration to angina rose from 271 to 480 s 1 h after nitroglycerin patches (P less than 0.001). Nitroglycerin patches were superior to the placebo throughout the day, but in a declining degree--by 94 s at 19.00 hours (P less than 0.05). ISDN q5h provided peaks of increased walking time to angina 1 h after each dose, but after 3 h exercise time was down to placebo levels. Furthermore, the peaks were of diminishing amplitude: 200 s at 09.00 hours, 150 s at 14.00 hours, but only 70 s at 19.00 hours. Thus, neither nitrate regimen provided continuous near-peak benefit throughout the 11 h period, although nitroglycerin patches had a significantly greater (P less than 0.05) overall effect during the day.", 
    "21": "The efficacy of beta-blockers was tested in 11 patients who avoided sudden death as a result of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation due to coronary artery disease or non-ischaemic underlying heart disease, after implantation of an automatic defibrillator. Ten patients initially tolerated acebutolol despite prior class III or IV heart failure in six cases; nadolol replaced acebutolol in nine cases for long-term therapy. In these 10 patients, periods of treatment with and without beta-blocking agent were available, making possible a crossover comparison, during a follow-up lasting 31.6 +/- 17.8 months. One hundred and ten shocks were delivered: 14 were considered as probably inappropriate and ruled out, leaving the remaining 96 shocks to be analysed. The monthly rate of shocks was lower during beta-blocking treatment: 0.12 +/- 0.24 vs. 1.09 +/- 1.41 (P = 0.03). While taking beta-blockers, only four patients received shocks, compared to 10 (i.e. all cases) not administered beta-blockers (P less than 0.01). Despite the technical limitations of the study, since only a few spontaneous shocks could be documented on ECG recordings, the efficacy of beta-blockers in preventing occurrence of severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias seems likely, and deserves further investigations using new implanted devices with improved memory functions.", 
    "22": "Adrenergic receptor subtypes were localized in situ and in cells isolated from the trigeminal motor nucleus and several other brain regions. To study receptor expression in reactive astrocytes, motor neuron degeneration and a glial reaction were induced in the trigeminal motor nucleus by the injection of the toxic lectin Ricin communis into the trigeminal motor root. Autoradiography following incubation of tissue sections in the alpha 1-ligand 125IBE 2254 (HEAT) or the beta-ligand 125Iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) showed a decrease in alpha 1- and an increase in beta-adrenergic receptor binding in the region of neuronal degeneration and gliosis. Glial hypertrophy, rather than hyperplasia, appears to be mainly responsible for the increased beta-binding, since inhibition of mitosis with cytosine arabinofuranoside only partially blocked elevations of beta-adrenergic receptor binding and GFAP immunolabelling in reactive astrocytes. More direct evidence for the expression of adrenergic receptors in normal and reactive astrocytes was obtained by combined autoradiography and immunohistochemistry of cells dissociated from the cerebral cortex, striatum, cerebellum, and trigeminal motor nucleus of adult rats. More than 88% of GFAP-positive astrocytes showed varying densities of beta-adrenergic receptor binding. In each region, the beta 2-subtype was proportionally greater than the beta 1-subtype. Astrocytes also expressed a significant density of alpha 1-receptors. Trigeminal motor neurons did not show beta-receptor binding, but had a density of alpha 1-receptors tenfold greater than astrocytes. A model for the role of astrocytes in adrenergic receptor-mediated modulation of trigeminal motor neuron excitability is discussed.", 
    "23": "Amphetamine, a neural stimulatory agent with acute effects mimicking those of stress, is shown here to elevate plasma corticosterone levels and suppress spleen and peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) mitogenic responses to concanavalin A (Con A) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) when administered to rats. Pretreatment of the rats with propranolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, totally prevented the amphetamine-induced suppression of lymphocyte mitogenic reactivity to Con A and PHA in the spleen and to PHA in the peripheral blood; however, the PBL mitogenic response to Con A was only partially restored. Although the amphetamine-induced alterations in immune function were prevented by propranolol pretreatment, the elevated plasma corticosterone response was not. This suggests that corticosterone is not modulating the mitogenic activity of splenic lymphocytes or PHA-reactive PBLs. On the other hand, Con A-reactive PBLs may be affected by corticosterone and/or other mechanisms, which may include the catecholamines.", 
    "24": "In order to study the acute effects of pharmacological agents on the vascular resistance of portal-systemic collaterals, a model of total portal vein occlusion with 100% portal-systemic shunts was developed in the conscious rat. The haemodynamic effects of several vaso-active substances were evaluated in this model and compared with those obtained after saline administration. Prazosin (0.5 mg), an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, significantly reduced mean arterial pressure by 29%, portal pressure from 13.8 +/- 1.0(mean +/- s.e.m.) to 10.1 +/- 0.4 mmHg and portal tributary blood flow (radioactive microspheres) from 13.6 +/- 2.1 to 11.7 +/- 1.2 mL/min. It also decreased portal-systemic vascular resistance from 95 +/- 16 to 73 +/- 9 dyn s/cm5 x 10(3). Propranolol (4 mg), a beta-adrenergic antagonist, significantly reduced mean arterial pressure by 12% and portal pressure from 15.5 +/- 1.2 to 13.3 +/- 0.9 mmHg while reducing portal tributary blood flow from 14.6 +/- 1.5 to 11.0 +/- 1.7 mL/min and increasing portal systemic collateral vascular resistance from 88 +/- 7 to 103 +/- 8 dyn s/cm5 x 10(3). Ketanserin (0.25 mg/kg), a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist, reduced portal pressure from 15.8 +/- 1.0 to 13.3 +/- 0.7 mmHg at a dose that did not alter mean arterial pressure or portal tributary blood flow. It achieved this by reducing portal-systemic collateral vascular resistance from 90 +/- 14 to 74 +/- 13 dyn s/cm5 x 10(3). Saline had no significant effect on systemic and splanchnic haemodynamics. This study shows that ketanserin decreases vascular resistance of portal-systemic collaterals while propranolol increases it. Thus, it is suggested that collateral vascular resistance is accessible to pharmacological manipulation.",

In human volunteer studies it has been found to reduce significantly intraocular pressure after single oral doses of 300-1000 mg, and to produce a small but statistically significant miosis. Its maximal ocular hypotensive action was less than that of oral timolol 20 mg.",

    "29": "Compared with the control, nifedipine significantly induced an increase in resting heart rate of (mean (SEM)) 14 (2) beats/min whereas atenolol and the combination significantly reduced it by 24 (2) and 20 (1) beats/min respectively. The number of exercise tests rendered negative after each intervention was five for nifedipine, nine for atenolol, and 11 for the combination. Compared with the control the time to the start of myocardial ischaemia (1 mm ST segment depression) during exercise significantly increased by 3.2 (0.6) min after nifedipine, by 4.6 (0.4) min after atenolol, and by 4.6 (0.5) min after the combination; rate-pressure product (beats/min. mm Hg) at 1 mm ST segment depression increased by 2824 (970) after nifedipine but fell by 4436 (900) and 4501 (719) after atenolol and the combination. The weekly frequency of angina was reduced from a mean of five while taking nifedipine, to three while taking atenolol, and to two while taking the combination. The total ischaemic time during ambulatory monitoring was significantly reduced from 69 (17) min during control to 37.5 (9.8) min during nifedipine, to 15.6 (5.5) min during atenolol, and to 6.5 (2.7) min during the combination.", 
    "30": "The undesirable effect of a high basal heart rate induced by nifedipine was neutralised by its combination with atenolol.

    "31": "Rabbits have circadian rhythms of intraocular pressure (IOP) and aqueous flow. The dark phase increases of IOP and flow are associated with increased aqueous cyclic AMP. If the daily rhythm of aqueous cyclic AMP reflects changes of tissue levels of cyclic AMP which mediate one of the mechanisms which control the rhythms of IOP and aqueous flow, then it must be a circadian rhythm as are the rhythms of IOP and flow. A recent report showed no change in aqueous cyclic AMP from 2 hrs before to 2 hrs after the beginning of subjective dark in animals housed in constant dark. Because the increase of intraocular pressure at the same times did persist in constant dark, the authors concluded that a significant portion of the circadian rhythm of IOP is unrelated to cyclic AMP mediated ocular mechanisms. However, if an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase is added to aqueous samples after harvesting by paracentesis, it is possible to show that most of the increase of aqueous cyclic AMP from mid-light phase to mid-dark phase persists in constant dark and is therefore likely to reflect a circadian rhythm of tissue cyclic AMP.", 
    "32": "A 42-year-old female had suffered from repeated syncope. She had vasovagal syncope with convulsions from vasodilatation and cardiac standstill which lasted for 9.8 sec. The 60 degrees head-up tilt test, nitroglycerin injection and isoproterenol infusion provoked vasovagal reaction. Although a beta blocker was not effective in preventing tilt-induced hypotension and bradycardia, midodrine hydrochloride (alpha-1 stimulant) or atropine prevented it. In this patient, insufficient constriction of capacitance vessels might have played an important role in activation of an inhibitory reflex from cardiopulmonary mechanoreceptors which caused hypotension and bradycardia.", 
    "33": "Regional vascular effects of some adrenergic agents, focussing on brown adipose tissue (BAT), were investigated using tracer microspheres with a reference sample method in the anesthetized rat. Intravenous injections of 0.5 mg/kg BRL-26830A, a beta 3-adrenergic agonist, increased heart rate, but changes in blood pressure and cardiac output were not significant. The drug decreased blood flow in the brain, the spleen and the kidneys, but markedly increased it in BAT. At 2 mg/kg, arotinolol, an alpha/beta-adrenergic blocker, decreased blood pressure by 20 mmHg and increased cardiac output by 95 ml/min/kg. It slightly but significantly decreased blood flow in the liver and the spleen, but markedly increased the flow in BAT. Acebutolol, a beta 1-adrenergic blocker, decreased blood flow in the liver, the spleen, the pancreas, the kidneys, the adrenals, the skeletal muscle and the skin. Bunazosin, an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker, decreased it in all organs and tissue expect the brain and BAT. The pattern of redistribution of blood flow by arotinolol was very similar to that caused by BRL-26830A. Acebutolol and bunazosin rather decreased the blood flow in the BAT. These results indicate that stimulation of beta 3-adrenergic receptors, in BAT results in vasodilation, and that arotinolol may bind to those beta 3-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "34": "Survivors of myocardial infarction with less than 2 PVC/h on 24-h ambulatory electrocardiography were followed up for an average of 25 months (11 to 40 months) while receiving a placebo (1,222 patients) or propranolol, 180 or 240 mg/day (1,234 patients). Three quarters of the participants with PVCs had an average of less than 2 PVC/h. Only 16 percent did not have any ventricular ectopic activity during the 24 h. Analysis of total mortality according to the number of premature ventricular complexes per hour showed that patients who had PVCs with a very low frequency (less than 0.5/h) had 49 percent higher mortality than patients who did not have any PVC. Patients who had greater than 0.5 PVC/h but less than 1 PVC/h had a statistically significant higher mortality rate, 11.7 vs 4.1 percent (p less than 0.0001) than patients who had no PVC. These data indicate that low ventricular ectopic activity frequency is associated with increased mortality in survivors of acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "35": "The nonselective beta-blocker propranolol and the selective beta 1-adrenoblocker flusoxolol were tested for their effects on the activities of acid phosphatase, acid DNAase, cathepsin D, beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase in intact rat ventricular myocardial homogenates. The two drugs were found to have the most noticeable effect on the activity of three enzymes under study: acid phosphatase, beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase. They were able to stabilize lysosomal membranes during long-term homogenate preincubation at 37 degrees S. It is suggested that the mechanism of action of the drugs on intact rat ventricular myocardial lysosomes under the conditions of the study involves the binding of both propranolol and flusoxolol to beta-adrenoceptors on the lysosomes.", 
    "36": "Renin response to nifedipine, verapamil, propranolol and hypothiazide was studied in 133 patients with Stage II hypertensive disease. The common mechanism of action in all these drugs was an increase in baseline plasma renin activity (PRA). In patients with a baseline high RPA, propranolol and nifedipine lowered it, whereas verapamil and hypothiazide unchanged it. Group analysis indicated that enhanced PRA during therapy was unassociated with diminished antihypertensive effects of an agent as compared with patients in whom RPA showed no increase. Propranolol was more effective in patients with high PRA than the other agents. The best nifedipine tolerance was recorded in patients with lower PRA.", 
    "37": "In order to investigate the mechanism and treatment of angina decubitus, 20 patients (18 men and 2 women aged 36-70 years) were studied during hospitalization. All patients were found to have an increased heart rate x systolic blood pressure product before the onset of angina decubitus, indicating that this type of angina pectoris belongs to the category of effort angina. Of the 11 patients investigated by continuous hemodynamic monitoring, 3 had significant progressive increases in pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PADP) before onset: their episodes of angina could not be completely controlled by digoxin and diuretics, but quickly subsided after beta blockers were added. Among the other 8 patients, PADP increased slightly in 5 and remained unchanged in 3 cases before onset: these patients had no manifestations of LV dysfunction, and beta blockers combined with coronary vasodilators produced satisfactory effects. These results indicate that LV failure is not a major factor in the pathogenesis of angina decubitus. The LV diastolic dysfunction seen in 8/11 cases may have been related to LV hypertrophy caused by long-term hypertension or chronic persistent ischemia.", 
    "38": "Beta-blockers have been shown to have a beneficial effect especially regarding secondary prevention in coronary patients. The reduction in global mortality is most noticeable with respect to sudden death, which suggests an antiarrhythmic effect, but other non-lethal ischaemic events are also less frequent. The explanation of this observation is certainly multifactorial: some results point to a potential action on the development of atherosclerotic lesions. This justifies experimental and clinical studies of this hypothesis with this pharmacological group of drugs.", 
    "39": "1. Primary monolayer cultures from adult human epididymis were grown on Petri dishes and previous supports. The epithelia so formed were used for whole-cell patch clamp recording and short-circuit current (ISC) measurement. 2. After 50 days of culture, the cells formed a tight epithelium with transepithelial potential of 5.5 +/- 1.3 mV (mean +/- S.E.M.., n = 16), apical side negative, and a basal ISC of 6.9 +/- 0.9 microA cm-2 (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 16). 3. Adrenaline, when added to the basolateral side, at a concentration of 0.23 mumol l-1 increased the ISC by 3.0 +/- 1.2 microA cm-2 (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 4). This increase was blockable by diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC, 1 mmol l-1). Forskolin (10 mumol l-1) also evoked a similar response to adrenaline. 4. In whole-cell patch clamp experiment, the resting membrane potential of the cells after dialysis with pipette solution containing 135 mmol l-1 KCl was found to be -30 +/- 14 mV (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 15). 5. About 90% of the cells successfully forming patches responded to 1 mumol l-1 adrenaline by an increase in inward current at -70 mV holding potential (delta I = -1600 +/- 900 pA, mean +/- S.E.M., n = 15). This increase in current was accompanied by a shift in reversal potential to -2 +/- 1 mV (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 15). 6. The adrenaline-induced inward current was found to be blockable by the Cl- channel blocker, DPC (0.25 mmol l-1). Ion substitution experiments showed that the adrenaline-evoked current was carried mainly by Cl-. 7. The effect of adrenaline on the whole-cell current was found to be mimicked by forskolin and could be abolished by including GDP beta S or a protein kinase A inhibitor in the pipette solution. Propranolol, but not phentolamine, completely abolished the effect of adrenaline. 8. Inclusion of 20 mmol l-1 EGTA or 2 mmol l-1 BAPTA + 100 mumol l-1 TMB-8 (to inhibit intracellular Ca2+ release) in the pipette did not seem to have any marked effect on adrenaline-evoked whole-cell current. Lowering the pipette Ca2+ concentration to 1 nmol l-1 or raising it to 10 mumol l-1 had no effect on the whole-cell current response to adrenaline. 9. This study shows that adrenaline stimulates Cl- secretion in cultured human epididymal cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "40": "The binding, adenylate cyclase activation, and functional effect of four beta-adrenoceptor agonists were studied in the guinea-pig lung parenchyma preparation and the results were compared with those obtained earlier in guinea-pig left-heart ventricle (beta 1-adrenoceptors) and soleus muscle (beta 2-adrenoceptors) preparations. The pKi-values of the unselective compounds, isoprenaline and orciprenaline, were in good agreement with those obtained in the heart and soleus muscle. The beta 2-adrenoceptor selective compounds KWD 2026 and terbutaline were bound to two sites, one corresponding to the beta 1-adrenoceptors and the other to the beta 2-adrenoceptors. The pKi-value of isoprenaline was in good agreement with its pKact-value indicating that maximum adenylate cyclase activity is obtained when the occupancy of the receptors is maximal. Further, the relative intrinsic efficacy calculated from the functional effect and receptor occupancy agreed well with the relative maximum adenylate cyclase activation by the agonists which was also found earlier for the guinea-pig heart ventricle and soleus muscle preparations. Relative effects were obtained from both functional experiments and from affinity and adenylate cyclase activating studies. There was good agreement between relative effects obtained in these two ways. It is concluded that the guinea-pig lung parenchyma preparation may be useful for the study of the beta-adrenoceptor adenylate cyclase system.", 
    "41": "The early and long-term results of both surgical and nonsurgical therapy for 160 patients with acute aortic dissection in our institution were analyzed. Of the 83 patients with acute type A aortic dissection, 47 received surgery during acute stage, 10 received it in the chronic stage, and 26 received nonsurgical therapy. Of the 77 patients with acute type B aortic dissection, 27 received surgery during acute stage, 22 received it in the chronic stage, and 28 received nonsurgical therapy. Ten-year survival rates for patients receiving surgery during the acute stage were 62% for type A and 64% for type B dissection. This survival rate for type A patients was significantly higher than that for type A patients not receiving surgery, but the corresponding difference for type B patients was not significant. Present data indicate that immediate surgical intervention is indicated in patients with acute type A dissection, and elective operation in the subacute stage in patient with uncomplicated type B dissection following medical therapy in the acute stage.",

The effectiveness of combination therapy for hypertension has been investigated; the results of these studies are reviewed.", 
    "43": "Three-hundred and fifty patients with moderate to severe reversible obstructive airways disease (forced expiratory volume in 1 s or peak expiratory flow rate < or = 50% predicted, a 15% reversibility to inhaled salbutamol and symptomatic) were recruited into a multi-centre, multinational, double-blind, parallel-group randomized study. Two-hundred and eighty-three patients were randomized to receive 50 micrograms salmeterol twice daily or 100 micrograms salmeterol twice daily administered from a metered-dose inhaler for 3 months. Salbutamol (100 micrograms per metered actuation) was provided for symptomatic relief. Morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), day-time and night-time asthma symptoms and additional bronchodilator usage were recorded by the patient on a daily basis. Lung function and patient/physician assessment of treatment efficacy were recorded at scheduled clinic visits. Safety was determined by monitoring adverse events and standard biochemical, haematological and cardiovascular parameters. Salmeterol 100 micrograms twice daily was consistently superior to salmeterol 50 micrograms twice daily in morning and evening PEFR measurements (mean differences between the treatments: 10-14 l min-1 for morning, 95% CI-0, 22 l min-1, P = 0.047; and 10-15 l min-1 for evening, 95% CI 2, 22 l min-1, P = 0.023). The improvement in PEFR was independent of concurrent steroid usage, with the most marked improvement being seen in the more severe asthmatics requiring concurrent oral corticosteroids (mean differences between the treatments: 27-31 l min-1, 95% CI: 3,55 l m-1, P = 0.027).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "The maximum fluxes (Jmax) of beta-blockers through keratinized membranes were determined in vitro and compared with their physiochemical parameters such as lipophilicity (log k'0) and melting point (mp). Rat abdominal skin and hamster cheek pouch mucosa were used as the model membranes. Propranolol, metoprolol, timolol, pindolol, nadolol and agenolol were used as beta-blockers with a variety of physicochemical characters. Linear relations of Jmax with either log k'0 or mp were observed both in intact rat skin and in intact hamster cheek pouch, suggesting that the lipophilicity and thermodynamic activity of a drug in the crystal state primarily affect the drug's permeation through these membranes. However, the slope, dJmax/d(log k'0), for cheek pouch mucosa was greater than that for rat skin, corresponding to the lack of appendigeal shunt pathways in cheek pouch. Penetration studies using the delipidized membranes and the isolated stratum corneum sheet of hamster cheek pouch mucosa clarified that the primary rate-limiting barrier function might exist in the lipid layer of the stratum corneum. Jmax values for the tape-stripped and delipidized skins correlated with both the solubilities of drugs in the vehicle and with the mp, suggesting the polar porous characteristics of both model membranes. However, a theoretical approach confirmed that the contribution of an intracellular or aqueous pore route in the intact membrane to the permeation of drugs with positive lipophilic indexes is negligible.", 
    "45": "The beta-adrenergic receptors present in two human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines were characterized by measuring specific binding of [125I]-cyanopindolol (CYP). Whole, cultured, DiFi (derived from a familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP] patient) and HT-29 cells were used in radioligand binding assays. Scatchard analysis of specific 125I-CYP binding gave KDS of 38.6 +/- 5.7 pM in DiFi cells and 54 +/- 9.1 pM in HT-29 cells. However, binding site density (Bmax) in the DiFi cells was greater than that in HT-29 cells. In DiFi cells, the kinetically determined KD was similar to that calculated from Scatchard analysis. Studies in DiFi cells of the displacement of specific 125I-CYP binding by nonselective (propranolol), beta 1-selective (metoprolol and atenolol), and beta 2-selective (ICI 118-551) antagonists revealed only a single class of beta 2-adrenergic receptors. This provides the first evidence that colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines contain beta-adrenergic receptors and shows that only beta 2-adrenergic receptors are present in DiFi cells. Mechanisms possibly affecting beta-adrenergic-receptor expression in such cells are discussed in relation to colon carcinogenesis.", 
    "46": "The effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on regional blood flows were studied in urethane-anaesthetized rabbits. Experiments were performed both with and without adrenergic antagonist pretreatment. The tracer microsphere method was used to measure blood flow. TRH (0.1 mg kg-1) caused an increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) from 9.8 +/- 1 to 11.8 +/- 0.8; a higher dose (1 mg kg-1) increased the blood pressure to 15.2 +/- 1 kPa (P less than 0.001). Total cerebral blood flow (CBFtot) increased to 137 +/- 10% (P less than 0.05) of control at the lower dose and to 214 +/- 16% (P less than 0.001), at the higher dose. A reduction in blood flow at both doses of TRH in several peripheral organs indicates that the pressor effect was mainly due to an effect on the peripheral vascular resistance. In prazosin-pretreated animals in which the MAP was normalized by ligation of the thoracic aorta, TRH elicited an increase in the CBFtot to 131 +/- 12% (P less than 0.05) of control. In the iris, TRH caused vasodilation in prazosin-pretreated animals. In experiments with combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, a non-adrenergic vasoconstricting effect of TRH was seen in some peripheral organs. The results indicate that TRH activates the sympathetic nervous system thus causing an increased vascular resistance and MAP; these effects are mediated mainly by an alpha 1-adrenergic mechanism. In the spleen, the gastric mucosa and the adrenal glands, the vasoconstriction caused by TRH was partly non-adrenergic. The vasodilation seen in the small intestine and the anterior uvea after TRH treatment and adrenoceptor blockade may be explained by effects on the parasympathetic nervous system. The vasodilating effect of TRH in the brain does not seem to involve alpha 1- or beta-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "47": "The association of hypothyroidism and coronary artery disease is not uncommon. The precipitation of angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, and even myocardial infarction may occur in patients when initiating rapid replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. This is particularly true when replacement therapy is instituted in elderly persons or in patients with preexisting coronary artery disease. A starting daily dose of 12.5 to 25 micrograms and increments of 25 micrograms every 2 to 3 weeks is recommended. Close monitoring of cardiac symptoms is essential to avoid side effects. Medical management of angina pectoris includes administration of beta-blockers, nitrates, or at times combination antianginal therapy may be most effective. Persistence of angina in these patients may require coronary angiography with subsequent angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery.", 
    "48": "Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are common arrhythmias after coronary artery bypass grafting. Although the consequences of the arrhythmia are generally not life-threatening, it constitutes a major clinical problem often requiring conversion to sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation or flutter can result in hypotension, heart failure, pneumonia, and stroke. This article reviews the literature on epidemiology, electrophysiology, risk factors, and preventive trials. The major conclusions are: (1) In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation or flutter is 20-30%, the peak incidence being on the second or third postoperative day. (2) The strongest independent preoperative predictor for atrial fibrillation or flutter is the patients' age. (3) Intra-atrial conduction delay recorded pre and peroperatively may predict development of atrial fibrillation. (4) Peroperative inducibility of atrial fibrillation by pacing the right atrium may identify patients at risk for postoperative atrial fibrillation. (5) Development of postoperative atrial fibrillation or flutter has not been associated with peroperative or postoperative events. (6) The specificity and sensitivity of age and other possible relevant factors for prediction of atrial fibrillation or flutter after coronary artery bypass grafting is low. (7) No effective prophylactic regimen has yet been established.", 
    "49": "1. alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity of bevantolol(NC-1400) was tested in the rat thoracic aorta, comparing with that of labetalol. 2. In alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity, bevantolol(NC-1400) was 1/20th as potent as labetalol. 3. The pA2 values of bevantolol(NC-1400) and labetalol estimated in the rat thoracic aorta were compared with those in the rabbit thoracic aorta, which were reported by Takayanagi et al. [Takayanagi I., Kizawa Y., Iwasaki S. and Nakagoshi A. (1987) Gen. Pharmac. 18, 87-89]. 4. The pA2 values of bevantolol(NC-1400) and labetalol were approximately 1 order of magnitude higher in rat aorta than in rabbit aorta, suggesting that both the drugs distinguish between subtypes of alpha 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "50": "1. Binding sites in guinea pig myocardial tissue labelled by (-)-[125I] cyanopindolol (CYP) were investigated using differential centrifugation and autoradiographic techniques. Autoradiographs of myocardial sections (0.1 microns) indicated (-)-[125I]CYP binding to sarcolemmal membrane. A low density of binding sites was observed to mitochondria. 2. Binding studies were performed in subcellular fractions. The density of binding sites in the mitochondrial fraction (36.1 +/- 9.4 fmol/mg protein) was less than 10% that in the sarcolemmal membrane (371.7 +/- 38.2 fmol/mg protein). The beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype ratio in the mitochondrial fraction (83.3/16.7) was similar to that in the sarcolemmal fraction (87.1/12.9). 3. Ouabain (100 microM), in the presence of sodium azide (0.4 mM), inhibited a Na+K+ stimulated ATPase activity (1.0 +/- 0.2 mumol Pi/mg protein/hr reduction), indicating a low but significant level of sarcolemmal contamination of the mitochondrial fraction. 4. The study showed beta-adrenoceptors in guinea pig heart are located primarily on the sarcolemmal membrane of myocardium. No evidence was obtained for beta-adrenoceptors over mitochondria, as has been suggested in other tissues and species, but that this binding was to sarcolemmal inclusions in the mitochondrial fraction.", 
    "51": "1. Short-circuit current (SCC) technique was used to study the adrenoceptors involved in the electrogenic chloride secretion by cultured cauda epididymal epithelium of rats. Stimulation of the epithelium with noradrenaline (primarily beta 1-adrenoceptor selective agonist), salbutamol (beta 2-adrenoceptor selective agonist) and adrenaline (non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist) led to a rise in SCC. At a low chart-speed (2 mm min-1), the response profile to these agonists consisted of a peak followed by a sustained response considerably higher than the basal SCC. 2. The EC50s (doses of agonist producing 50% maximum response) of noradrenaline, salbutamol and adrenaline were 300, 115 and 10 nM respectively. Pretreating the tissues with 1 microM atenolol (beta 1-selective antagonist) and 10 microM butoxamine (beta 2-selective antagonist) shifted the dose-response curves of noradrenaline (shifted EC50 = 4000 nM) and salbutamol (shifted EC50 = 1050 nM) to the right. Atenolol (1 microM) and butoxamine (10 microM) shifted the dose-response curve of adrenaline to the right with new EC50s of 30 nM and 115 nM, respectively. 3. The rapidly rising phase of the SCC response to noradrenaline and adrenaline observed at low chart-speed consisted of a brief and transient retraction followed by a rebound increase in SCC. At a high chart-speed (1 mm s-1), the retraction and rebound phenomenon manifested as a fast initial spike which could be blocked by phentolamine (non-specific alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist) in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar initial spikes were observed when the tissues were stimulated with phenylephrine (alpha-selective agonist) but not with isoprenaline (non-selective beta-agonist) or forskolin (activator of adenylate cyclase). The response of the initial spike triggered by noradrenaline was dose-dependent and the EC50 was 2000 nM.4. The present study showed that the electrogenic chloride secretion by rat epididymis could be stimulated by (alphaxi-, beta131- and beta2-adrenoceptor agonists. The al-mediated response had a faster onset and more transient action than the 3-counterpart. It is postulated that epididymal chloride secretion might be regulated by neural (noradrenaline-mediated) and humoral (adrenaline-mediated) controls and that the stimulus-secretion coupling mechanisms might involve both Ca2+(alpha-mediated response) and adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (beta-mediated response) as intracellular second messengers.", 
    "52": "Surgical, endoscopic and pharmacological treatment options are available for prophylaxis of first upper intestinal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients. Randomized controlled trials have revealed that a prophylactic portocaval shunt operation should not be performed because its beneficial effect on the bleeding rate is outweighed by a slightly increased mortality. Prophylactic portal non-decompressive surgery (mainly gastro-oesophageal vascular disconnection) has been shown to reduce the bleeding rate and mortality in Japanese cirrhotic patients. However, further trials in different populations must confirm this positive effect. beta-blockers have fewer side-effects and are probably more effective for prophylaxis of the first bleed than sclerotherapy, but survival is only marginally influenced. Nadolol is preferable to propranolol. The effect of sclerotherapy is in part related to the technical experience of the physician. Although sclerotherapy has only minor effects on the bleeding rate, it is associated with a trend towards a prolonged survival. This may be caused by non-specific effects. On the basis of the published trials, only preliminary recommendations can be given. Prophylactic treatment may be useful in cirrhotic patients who are at high risk of bleeding. Life quality may be improved with continuous beta-blocker treatment. Some studies suggest that alcoholics with large varices may also profit from regular prophylactic sclerotherapy performed by experienced physicians.", 
    "53": "Successful pharmacological arrest of haemorrhage might avoid the risk of aspiration associated with tamponade and early studies have suggested that the vasoactive agent somatostatin may be as effective and perhaps safer than tamponade in controlling variceal haemorrhage. In our view, vasopressin has not established a role in management but we retain an open mind regarding the potential use of terlipressin in combination with nitroglycerin. It is unlikely that any of these agents can improve significantly our ability to control variceal haemorrhage when compared to balloon tamponade but they may reduce the incidence of pulmonary complications and thereby reduce subsequent mortality. Tamponade has proved successful in controlling acute haemorrhage from oesophageal varices in our hands. Late complications continue to give cause for concern but until effective safe alternatives to tamponade are developed, we continue to advocate its use for emergency control of acute variceal haemorrhage. Our own studies have shown that the high mortality seen in this patient population may reflect the severity of the underlying liver disease rather than failure of a management policy employing oesophageal tamponade for the initial control of acute variceal haemorrhage.", 
    "54": "This study used 2D Doppler flowmetry to assess the effects on peripheral hemodynamics of effective treatment with nicardipine or atenolol in 40 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. Two groups of 20 patients received treatment with nicardipine or atenolol, respectively, for 8 months. Consequently, those patients considered to be responders (blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg) were monitored for another 4 weeks after the therapy was suspended in order to determine whether the changes, if any, in arterial compliance persisted. Following the 8-month therapy, four patients from each group were excluded from the study because of unsatisfactory blood pressure levels. After the treatment, there was a decrease in blood pressure in both groups (P less than .01). In the nicardipine group, there was a significant increase in diameter and compliance (P less than .01), whereas pulse wave velocity and resistance decreased (P less than .01). In the atenolol group, these parameters did not change significantly. After therapy was ended, blood pressure returned to baseline values in both groups. However, in the nicardipine group, the observed improvement in forearm hemodynamics persisted. This result may indicate that nicardipine is able to induce a regression of functional and/or structural changes in the large arteries of hypertensive patients.", 
    "55": "This study was designed to evaluate the role of different serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes in mediating the effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on rat exploration of a novel environment. The active enantiomer of MDMA, S-MDMA increases forward locomotion and suppresses investigatory behaviors and local movements. Previous studies indicate that S-MDMA-induced hyperactivity depends upon drug-induced 5-HT release. Propranolol and pindolol, beta-noradrenergic antagonists with affinity for 5-HT1 receptors, antagonized the S-MDMA-induced locomotor hyperactivity. The antagonism by propranolol was stereoselective. In contrast, a beta-noradrenergic antagonist that is a weaker antagonist of 5-HT receptors, betaxolol, was much less effective at blocking the behavioral response to S-MDMA. Among nonselective 5-HT antagonists, methiothepin was effective and methysergide and cyproheptadine were ineffective as antagonists of S-MDMA-induced hypermotility. In other systems, methiothepin has been found to be a good antagonist at 5-HT1B receptors where methysergide and cyproheptadine are ineffective. The 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin was ineffective in blocking S-MDMA-induced hypermotility. However, ritanserin, methysergide, and cyproheptadine partially reversed the S-MDMA-induced suppression of investigatory responding, suggesting a contribution of 5-HT2 receptor activation to this component of the behavioral response to S-MDMA. This study indicates that S-MDMA produces a characteristic form of locomotor hyperactivity in rats that depends upon activation of 5-HT1-like receptors, possibly of the 5-HT1B subtype.", 
    "56": "Although intracoronary administration of the complement component, C5a, produces deleterious effects on regional coronary blood flow and segmental ventricular function, it is unclear whether a direct myocardial action contributes to the dysfunction induced by the anaphylatoxin. We therefore evaluated the effects of purified porcine C5a on contractile tension of isolated supported ventricular trabeculae from pig hearts. Muscles were studied in a myograph bath at 30 degrees C, electrically stimulated 12 times per minute, and stretched to produce maximal isometric developed tension. C5a concentrations of 30, 100, and 300 ng/ml increased tension (P less than 0.05) 9.8, 5.5, and 20.9%, respectively. In seven of nine muscles exposed to 300 ng/ml C5a, tension initially decreased 10.5% (P less than 0.05) before the positive inotropic effect. Tachyphylaxis was demonstrated by lack of contractile response to a second administration of C5a greater than 70 min after the initial exposure to the complement fragment. Blockade of histamine H1 receptors with diphenhydramine (10(-6) M) markedly attenuated both the positive and negative contractile responses to C5a. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol (5.6 x 10(-7) M) did not alter the response to C5a. Levels of thromboxane (Tx)B2, the stable metabolite of TxA2, were augmented in the bath after exposure to C5a (59 +/- 27.3 to 104 +/- 28.2 pg/ml, P less than 0.05). Although the TxA2 agonist, U-46619 (50 ng/ml), significantly increased tension, TxA2 receptor blockade with SQ 29548 (50 ng/ml) did not alter the response to C5a.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A low-dosage neuroleptic (flupenthixol) was included as a reference drug. Depending on the clinical assessment scales the placebo treatment resulted in moderate to excellent improvement in 36% to 56% of the patients after four weeks of treatment. The active drugs generally had a higher improvement range (from 31% to 80%). The global improvement scale was found to be better than the other scales in discriminating between placebo (50% improvement) and the active drugs (CGP 361 A brought about 78% improvement and flupenthixol brought about 80% improvement). However, only for flupenthixol was the difference of statistical significance.",

We characterized the beta-adrenergic receptors on human fetal lung type II cells, the cell type responsible for many pulmonary responses sensitive to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Type II cells were isolated from human fetal lung explants, and membrane particulates prepared from these cells were used for radioligand binding studies. 125I-iodocyanopindolol, a specific beta-adrenergic antagonist, bound to a single class of saturable, high-affinity binding sites on type II cell membranes with a receptor concentration of 78 +/- 9 fmol receptor/mg membrane protein, a kd of 79 +/- 18 nM, and 958 +/- 120 receptors per cell. Binding was stereoselective with l-propranolol binding with higher affinity than the inactive d-isomer. The binding site had the characteristics of a beta 2-adrenergic receptor. The order of potency of beta-adrenergic agonists was isoproterenol greater than epinephrine much greater than norepinephrine. The beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 competed for a single class of high-affinity sites. Agonist binding affinity was reduced in the presence of guanyl nucleotides, consistent with receptors coupled to guanine nucleotide binding proteins. beta-Adrenergic agonists also stimulated adenylyl cyclase in these membrane preparations. 125I-iodocyanopindolol binding to membranes prepared from human fetal lung fibroblasts indicated fewer receptors (404 +/- 68) than were present on type II cells. Work by others has suggested a difference in lung function and lung beta-adrenergic receptor concentration between males and females.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "In isolated rat white adipocytes, epinephrine (in the presence of 10 microM propranolol) increased the uptake of [32P]Pi into phosphatidylinositol in a dose-dependent fashion. When the cells were pretreated with the irreversible antagonist chlorethylclonidine, this alpha 1-adrenergic effect was markedly diminished. The effect of epinephrine was dose-dependently antagonized by selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists, with the potency order prazosin greater than 5-methylurapidil greater than or equal to WB4101. Binding studies using crude membrane preparations were performed with the ligands [3H]bunazosin and 125I-HEAT. Both ligands bound to membrane sites with high affinity (Kd values of 0.75 +/- 0.20 nM for [3H]bunazosin and 125 +/- 20 pM for 125I-HEAT), in a rapid, reversible, and saturable (Bmax, 9-12 fmol/mg of protein) fashion, and with the expected pharmacological characteristics for alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Binding displacement studies with these ligands indicated a potency order of prazosin greater than 5-methylurapidil greater than or equal to WB4101. Northern blot analysis using receptor subtype-specific gene probes showed that adipocyte mRNA hybridized with the alpha 1B-adrenergic probe. All these data suggest that the alpha 1-adrenoceptors of rat white adipocytes belong to the alpha 1B subtype.",

    "62": "The high mortality rate from coronary heart disease in hypertensives can only be substantially reduced if sudden coronary death rates can be decreased. The aim of this review is to discuss how treatment may be tailored to reduce the risk of sudden death in high-risk patients. Clinical trials have not yet produced long-term primary prevention data on the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists or alpha-blockers on cardiovascular complications and sudden death in hypertensive patients. Further, the conclusion from large-scale secondary preventive studies presently available on ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists is that their impact on sudden death has been disappointing. By contrast, some beta-blockers have reduced sudden death and other coronary events both in primary and secondary preventive studies. The benefits have been attributed to beta 1-blockade, and seem to be independent of blood pressure control. It cannot be assumed that all beta-blockers are equally effective in preventing ventricular fibrillation, sudden death and other coronary events. To date, the best documented data cover the lipophilic beta-blockers and it is speculated that by increasing levels of cardiac vagal tone and electrical stability in the heart, beta 1-blockade in the brain might contribute to the reduction in sudden death risk seen with these beta-blockers.",

Previous studies showed that the human internal mammary artery (IMA) was capable of weak beta-adrenoceptor mediated relaxation and that alpha-adrenoceptor agonists may induce contraction in the human IMA. 2. We investigated the effects of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), a vasodilator agent often used perioperatively, on alpha-adrenoceptor mediated contraction in the human IMA. 3. Discarded human IMA segments were taken from 37 patients who underwent IMA--coronary artery bypass graft operations and equilibrated in an organ bath. 4. A specially designed technique was used to normalize the vessel segments under the pressure similar to the in vivo situation. Noradrenaline (NA), phenylephrine (PE), and methoxamine (MO) were used to contract the vessel segments. 5. GTN fully relaxed PE or MO (submaximal concentration) induced precontraction. Therapeutic plasma concentration of GTN relaxed 40-90% of the PE induced contraction (2.82 g, EC50 = 7.92 +/- 0.06 -log M) and 20-90% of the MO induced contraction (1.8 g, EC50 = 7.63 +/- 0.16 -log M).

    "66": "Recent investigations of SMI occurring during daily life have advanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia. These contributions have directed our attention away from \"chest pain\" alone and physical exertion as the central provoking factor toward transient myocardial ischemia and its broader triggers and consequences. Transient myocardial ischemic episodes, the majority of which are silent, are found in a subset of patients with any clinical manifestations of CAD (eg, stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden death), as well as in those patients with CAD who are and have been totally asymptomatic. These episodes are an independent predictor of increased risk for future cardiac events. Most medical therapy and revascularization therapies have the potential to prevent or relieve these silent episodes; however, we do not yet know which method is superior in reducing SMI episodes or preventing future cardiac events. Furthermore, the benefit of reducing SMI versus the cost and potential morbidity of these chosen therapies is not known. At least three trials are now underway to examine some of these concerns (Table 2). Focus on pain relief alone does not appear to be an adequate approach to alter outcome in patients with CAD and may prove insufficient to control SMI. Until these issues are resolved, we believe a conservative approach to the management of patients with CAD is warranted. Documentation of ischemia (painful or painless) is essential. Three general principles should be kept in mind. First, the presence of detectable ischemia is of central importance. This information should be used in the overall risk assessment of the patient. Second, the level of concern or aggressiveness of treatment should be based on the risk associated with the ischemic abnormalities documented (Table 3). The exercise stress test is the most useful to begin this process. The detection of ischemic-type ST-segment depression, either silent or painful, at a low workload (eg, less than or equal to 120 beats per minute or less than or equal to 6.5 metabolic equivalents [METS]) implies high risk for adverse outcome. Likewise, these ST-segment changes occurring in leads that reflect multiple coronary artery distribution, of greater than 2 mm in magnitude and persisting for greater than 6 minutes, are all markers for high risk. Thallium redistribution defects occurring at low work loads, in multiple areas, associated with increased lung uptake and enlargement of the cardiac pool all imply high risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "68": "In 2 longitudinal studies with 10 patients each, the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of nitrendipine and the pharmacokinetics of racemic (rac) bisoprolol (both 20mg orally) were investigated during acute febrile infectious diseases and at least 6 weeks later in the healthy state. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of rac-nitrendipine were increased in the infectious state by 89% [95% confidence interval (CI): 24 to 187%] and 95% (95% CI: 22 to 209%), respectively. Similar increases were observed for both S- and R-nitrendipine. Nitrendipine exhibited stereoselective pharmacokinetics in both the healthy state and the infectious state, but the mean ratios of S:R AUC values [healthy: 1.79 (95% CI: 1.36 to 2.11); infectious: 1.87 (95% CI: 1.62 to 2.11)] were not different. The elimination half-life, protein binding and haemodynamic effects of nitrendipine also did not differ between the infectious and the healthy state. The mechanism for the disease effects may be related to suppression of hepatic cytochrome P450 activity by mediators of inflammatory reactions.

Patients were considered refractory only if chest pain continued despite treatment with maximal 5-drug therapy. At the time of transfer to the center, 65 patients continued to have ischemic chest pain at rest and were considered \"medically refractory\" by their referring physicians. A more aggressive medical regimen was used, and 54 patients (83%) were rendered chest pain-free.

In-hospital treatment strategies for the 114 patients stabilized with medical therapy included continued medical therapy (n = 37), coronary angioplasty (n = 46) and bypass grafting (n = 31). The rate of myocardial infarction or death in patients managed medically was 3%. Coronary angioplasty in medically stabilized patients was complicated by an abrupt closure rate of 26%, and a 17% rate of myocardial infarction, death or need for emergency bypass grafting.

    "70": "The release of GnRH evoked by norepinephrine (NE) was studied in GT1 GnRH neuronal cell lines in superfusion and static cultures. GnRH release from static cultured GT1-7 cells was stimulated by NE in a dose-dependent fashion. This effect was mimicked by the nonsubtype-selective beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol and the beta 1-adrenergic subtype-specific antagonist CGP 20712A. However, the stimulation of GnRH release by NE was not affected by the beta 2-, alpha-, alpha 1-, or alpha 2-adrenergic antagonists ICI 118.551, phentolamine, prazosin, or yohimbine, respectively. Superfusion of GT1-1 cells with NE for 60-100 min resulted in rapid and sustained increases in GnRH secretion. The NE-stimulated GnRH release showed a higher amplitude and longer duration than the spontaneous GnRH pulses characteristic of GT1-1 cells. In parallel to the stimulation of GnRH release, NE also rapidly increased (first observed at 60 sec) the intracellular concentration of cAMP in isobutylmethylxanthine-pretreated GT1-1 and GT1-7 cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The stimulation of intracellular cAMP concentration was also mimicked by isoproterenol and blocked by propranolol and CGP 20712A. In addition, GT1 cells express beta 1- but not beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA, as probed by Northern blot analysis. These results demonstrate a direct stimulatory effect of NE on GnRH neurons. The pharmacological evidence and the mRNA analysis are consistent with NE acting through a beta 1-adrenergic receptor positively coupled to adenylate cyclase.",

While in the department the patient developed tonic-clonic activity and was concurrently noted to have developed ventricular tachycardia. A precordial thump was given with the simultaneous cessation of the arrythmia and the seizure. After definitive electrophysiologic study, the diagnosis of long QT syndrome was made.

The purity of the fractions isolated were tested biochemically by considering some marker enzymes, i.e., lactate dehydrogenase, plasma membrane Na+K+ATPase and acetylcholinesterase for the synaptosomes and succinate dehydrogenase for the mitochondrial fraction. The adrenergic receptor properties in the synaptosomal membrane were evaluated by observing the effect of different beta- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists as function of synaptic plasma membrane Na+K+ATPase activity. Isoproterenol (beta-agonist) and yohimbine (alpha 2-antagonist)-induced changes in the synaptosomal Na+K+ATPase activity were counteracted by beta-antagonist propranolol and alpha 2-agonist clonidine, respectively. In the non-synaptic mitochondria the corresponding effects were insignificant.

    "75": "The interaction of cocaine with myocardial and vascular adrenoceptors is incompletely understood. The systemic and coronary hemodynamic effects of intravenous cocaine (1.5 mg/kg) were examined in dogs with and without pretreatment with propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v.) or labetalol (5 mg/kg i.v.) on different days. A total of 24 experiments was completed (three sets of experiments) using eight dogs chronically instrumented for measurement of aortic and left-ventricular pressure, left-ventricular dP/dt, subendocardial segment length, coronary blood flow, and cardiac output. Myocardial oxygen consumption was estimated from the pressure work index (PWI). Cocaine significantly (p < 0.05) increased heart rate (+51 +/- 17 bpm), mean arterial pressure (+72 +/- 10 mm Hg), left-ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressures (+56 +/- 9 and +14 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively), coronary blood flow (+32 +/- 10 ml/min) and the PWI (+10.0 +/- 2.3 ml O2/min/100 g). Significant reductions in stroke volume (-9 +/- 5 ml) and percent segment shortening (-7.1 +/- 1.7) were observed. These changes returned to control after 30 min. After pretreatment with propranolol, the cocaine-mediated increases in mean arterial pressure, left-ventricular systolic pressure, rate-pressure product, and the pressure work index (4.4 +/- 0.7 ml O2/min/100 g) were significantly (p < 0.05) less than those observed with cocaine alone. Cocaine also reduced contractility [dP/dt50 (-341 +/- 80 mm Hg/s)] and increased systemic vascular resistance (+2703 +/- 339 dyn.s.cm-5) in the presence of propranolol. Labetalol abolished the cocaine-mediated increases in heart rate and coronary blood flow and significantly attenuated the increases in mean arterial pressure, left-ventricular systolic pressure, cardiac output, rate-pressure product, and calculated myocardial oxygen consumption when compared to results obtained with cocaine alone. The results demonstrate that a portion of the basic dynamic effects of cocaine is mediated by stimulation of alpha and beta adrenoceptors. Combined alpha and beta adrenergic blockade reduces the hemodynamic effects of cocaine more than beta blockade alone. During antagonism of the sympathomimetic response of cocaine, direct negative inotropic actions of this drug are unmasked.", 
    "76": "Using the radioimmunological assay, renal cAMP content was studied in adrenalectomized and non-adrenalectomized rats with reflex dystrophy resulting from chronic ischiatic nerve stimulation against the background either of organ denervation or of general beta-adreno-blockade with propranolol. It was shown that the surgical denervation of kidney resulted in an increase in renal cAMP both in norm and especially in reflex dystrophy. The beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol was accompanied by a decrease in renal nucleotide being more pronounced in animals with intact ischiatic nerve. Based on own and literature data we have suggested that one cause for the damage to renal aldosterone receptors in reflex dystrophy under pathological stimulation from the focus of damage in ischiatic nerve as well as for their improved functioning in surgical or pharmacological (beta-adrenoceptor blockade) desympathization which discontinues this stimulation, may be change in cAMP content. Via cAMP-dependent protein kinases, this nucleotide triggers a complex system of intracellular metabolic transformations which is able to change the protein spectrum of cytoplasm, nucleus, and chromatin and, therefore, the protein complex of aldosterone receptors. A participation of other biochemical systems of aldosterone stimulus transmission, including cAMP-independent ones, in processes of damage and normalization of tubule cells of the kidneys undergoing reflex dystrophy cannot be excluded.",

    "78": "1. The activity of primary afferent axons was recorded in rats that had received a chronic constriction injury (CCI) to the common sciatic nerve. The CCI gives rise to a painful peripheral neuropathy that is characterized by allodynia, hyperalgesia, and, probably, spontaneous pain (or dysesthesia). In the majority of animals, these neuropathic pain symptoms begin 2 days postinjury; sciatic nerve afferents were examined just before and just after the time of symptom onset, at 1 and 3 days postinjury. 2. We used two stimulating electrodes, one proximal to the injury and the other distal, to activate the injured sciatic nerve while we recorded from individual primary afferent axons in microfilaments teased from the L4-L6 dorsal roots. Measurements of conduction velocities (calculated from the proximal electrode) and evaluation of conduction through the site of injury were made from 181 A beta, 135 A delta, and 60 C-fibers. 3. The percentage of axons that did not conduct through the injury site at 1 day postinjury was 85% for the A beta fibers and 55% for the A delta fibers, but only 9% for the C-fibers. By day 3, these percentages had increased to 89% for the A beta fibers, 87% for the A delta fibers, and 32% for the C-fibers. Some axons were activated from the distal stimulating electrode at currents greater than 5-10 times those required from the proximal electrodes, but their distally evoked responses did not have the longer latencies expected from a more distant site of activation. Control experiments confirmed that such high-threshold responses were due to current spread from the distal electrode to a site proximal to the nerve injury. 4. Spontaneous discharges were observed in 35% of A beta fibers, 15% of A delta fibers, and 3% of C-fibers (data from 1 and 3 days postinjury combined). Of the 55 A beta fibers exhibiting spontaneous discharge, 89% did not conduct through the injury site; the same was true of 65% of the A delta fibers (n = 20). Both of the two spontaneously discharging C-fibers conducted through the injury. The frequency of the spontaneous discharge of the myelinated fibers ranged from 10 to 50 Hz and was usually regular or bursting. 5. Intravenous administration of gallamine triethiodide (Flaxedil), a K+ channel blocker, either induced activity in previously silent fibers or increased the frequency of spontaneous activity in 50% (21/42) of A beta fibers and 19% (3/16) of A delta fibers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Thyroxine increased the number of beta-adrenoceptors in both cardiac and renal cortex membranes prepared with both methods. These results suggest that: i) Enrichment of the membrane fraction may explain the higher number of beta-adrenoceptors found with KCl, ii) Thyroid hormone plays a role in the regulation of beta-adrenoceptors in the renal cortex.",

Agonists competed for specific [125I]cyanopindolol binding, with the following rank order of potencies: (-)-isoproterenol > (-)-epinephrine > (-)-norepinephrine. Beta 2-selective antagonist ICI-118551 was approximately 3 log orders more potent than the beta 1-selective antagonist, betaxolol. These receptors were also coupled to an adenylate cyclase. These results suggest strongly that cultured human retinal pigment epithelial cells possess beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The potential significance of these findings with regard to retinal pigment epithelial functions is discussed herein.", 
    "81": "1. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) stimulated adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) production by cultured GH4ZD10 cells with an EC50 value of about 7 nM. The extracellularly recovered cyclic AMP predominated, and was reduced by co-incubation with 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), whereas dopamine (0.1-30 microM) did not reduce VIP-stimulated cyclic AMP production. 2. The responses to 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT were blocked by (-)-alprenolol and NAN 190. The antagonism by (-)-alprenolol was competitive in nature with a pA2 value of 7.0. 3. The responsiveness of the cells to 5-HT agonists was highly dependent upon the culturing conditions used. Thus, 8-OH-DPAT inhibition of VIP (30 nM)-stimulated cyclic AMP production decreased with increasing passage number of the cells. Reduction of the zinc concentration used to promote expression of the 5-HT1A receptor gene produced a greater sensitivity of the cells to 5-HT agonists. 4. Under such conditions, the following efficacies (5-HT = 100) were found: lisuride 106, (+)-lysergic-acid diethylamide 100, 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine 98, RU 24949 98, 5-carboxamidotryptamine 97, (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT 90, (+)-8-OH-DPAT 87, 1-[2-(4-aminophenyl)ethyl]-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-piperazine 86, flesinoxan 79/88, (-)-8-OH-DPAT 62, buspirone 43/50, ipsapirone 46. Spiroxatrine and spiperone had a low intrinsic activity, but reduced the response to 5-HT. These efficacies are similar to those reported in the literature for post-synaptically localized 5-HT1A receptors in the rat hippocampus. Thus, the GH4ZD10 cells serve as a useful in vitro model system for these receptors.", 
    "82": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been shown to stimulate corticosterone release from the adrenal gland directly, and indirectly through activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The aim of this paper was to determine whether IL-1-stimulated corticosterone release occurs indirectly through the local release of catecholamines from the rat adrenal gland. To accomplish this, experiments were conducted on both quartered rat adrenal glands and primary cultures of dispersed adrenal cells. Incubation of quartered adrenals with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, 10(-12) to 10(-8) M) or IL-1 beta (10(-12) to 10(-8) M) resulted in dose-dependent increases (P less than 0.05) in corticosterone release. Corticosterone release stimulated by 10(-8) M doses of ACTH and IL-1 beta began to rise 30 min after incubation and peaked at 2 h. In primary cultures of adrenal cells, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta elevated corticosterone release after a 24-h incubation period. ACTH elevated corticosterone levels at 4 and 24 h. The stimulatory effect of IL-1 on corticosterone release was mimicked by epinephrine (10(-6) M), and was selectively blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (10(-5) M). The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (10(-5) M) did not change IL-1-induced corticosterone release. Neither phentolamine nor propranolol had an effect on ACTH-stimulated corticosterone release.

    "83": "The density of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1B receptors and their coupling to the inhibition of cAMP accumulation were investigated in opossum kidney cells maintained in culture. The density and properties of the receptor were determined using [125I] iodocyanopindolol as the radioligand. The pharmacological specificity of the binding site was consistent with that expected for a 5-HT1B receptor. Serotonin inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation with an EC50 of 4-8 nM. Compounds known to show selectivity at the 5-HT1B receptor, such as trifluoromethyl-phenylpiperazine and CGS-12066B, also inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, acting as full agonists with efficacies comparable to that of serotonin. Other beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, including (-)-pindolol and (-)-alprenolol, bound to the receptor with high affinity and acted as partial agonists capable of inhibiting forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Exposure of cells to 5-HT resulted in a time- and dose-dependent decrease in the density of 5-HT1B receptors that was not accompanied by a change in the Kd of the binding site for [125I] iodocyanopindolol. A maximum decrease of 60% in the number of 5-HT1B receptors was evident after a 16-hr treatment with 1 microM 5-HT. Concomitant with the observed decrease in the density of receptors was a marked increase in the EC50 for 5-HT-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The EC50 was increased 4-5-fold after a 16-hr exposure to 1 microM 5-HT, and the maximal level of inhibition was markedly decreased. Whereas pretreatment with moderate concentrations of 5-HT (100-300 nM) for 16 hr produced significant decreases in the density of 5-HT1B receptors and increases in the EC50 for inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation, there was little change in the maximal level of inhibition that could be attained. Such a combination of changes could be explained by the presence of \"spare\" 5-HT1B receptors on these cells.",

Blood pressure was measured blindly and serum lipid concentrations assessed at run-in and after 1 year. A computer-based model was used in five cost-effectiveness simulations with different assumptions as to the effect upon coronary heart disease risk from the changes in diastolic blood pressure and cholesterol, both total and high-density lipoprotein. A cost-benefit analysis was also performed, calculated as willingness to pay for treatment, as assessed by questionnaire, minus total cost.",

    "92": "beta-Adrenergic receptors play an integral role in the modulation of cell function in the developing lung. In the rat, there are marked increases in beta receptor density in whole lung during postnatal maturation, but it is now known whether there are differential developmental changes in receptor density in specific cell types. Quantitative light microscopic autoradiography with [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP) was used to determine maturational changes in beta-adrenergic receptor density in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle (ASM), bronchial smooth muscle (BSM), and alveolar lining cells (ALC) in rat lung during postnatal development (1 day to 6 mo). [125I]ICYP binding to whole lung sections revealed a single class of high-affinity receptors; agonist competitive binding studies suggested that the receptors are primarily of the beta 2 subtype. beta-Adrenergic receptor density in newborn (1 day) lung was lowest in ASM cells and was comparable in BSM cells and ALC. In contrast, in lungs from adult rats (3 mo), receptor density was similar in ASM versus BSM cells and was 2-fold greater in ALC. In addition, the maturational pattern of increasing receptor density differed in ASM compared with BSM and ALC. Receptor density in ASM increased 93% from 1 to 13 days, another 92% from 13 to 20 days, and was unchanged thereafter. In contrast, receptor density in BSM cells did not change from 1 to 13 days, but it increased 65% from 13 to 20 days, rose another 47% from 20 days to 3 mo, and increased an additional 24% from 3 to 6 mo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "93": "We studied the mechanisms underlying the increase in automaticity induced by alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation of normal and \"ischemic\" canine Purkinje fibers. Fibers were superfused with a control Tyrode's solution, followed by an ischemic superfusate that included 10 mM KCl, 5 mM NaHCO3, Po2 of 10-25 mm Hg, and pH 6.7. To exclude beta-adrenergic actions, propranolol was added to all solutions. In the presence of phenylephrine, normal automaticity at high membrane potentials usually decreased, whereas the incidence of abnormal automaticity during ischemia was increased from a control value of 10% to 30%. Block of an alpha 1-receptor subtype with chloroethylclonidine in the presence of phenylephrine caused normal automaticity to increase in all fibers studied and significantly increased abnormal automaticity to 70%. The alpha-adrenergic-induced increase in automaticity did not occur in ischemic fibers from animals pretreated with pertussis toxin (PTX), which ADP-ribosylated and functionally inactivated the 41-kd family of GTP regulatory proteins. In contrast, the use of PTX enhanced the increase in automaticity induced by phenylephrine in normally polarized Purkinje fibers. Ryanodine, which blocks sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release, attenuated the increase in normal automaticity in nonischemic fibers but had no effect on abnormal automaticity in ischemic fibers. The increase in abnormal automaticity was, however, blocked by the alpha 1 subtype blocker WB 4101, which also blocks the increase in automaticity in normal fibers. In conclusion, the increase in abnormal automaticity in ischemic Purkinje fibers depends on a WB 4101-sensitive alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtype whose actions are transduced by a PTX-sensitive 41-kd G protein and are not blocked by ryanodine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "94": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nadolol given in a single dose of 80 mg to 17 patients with mild hypertension were studied by echocardiography at rest. The major pharmacokinetic parameters for nadolol did not differ greatly from those reported in the literature and obtained from volunteers. No correlation was found between endogenous creatine clearance and renal nadolol clearance. How the hemodynamic effect developed and whether it was related to blood nadolol concentrations in time after single administration were followed up and discussed. There was a significant decline in blood pressure 2 hours after the drug. There was a clock-wise hysteresis in the relationship between the changes in cardiac output and nadolol levels. Changes in blood pressure were shown to significantly correlate with those in cardiac output.", 
    "95": "Surface activity, biochemical composition and morphology of the rat lungs were studied in norm, under effect of acute hypoxia and after infusion of obsidan (1 mg/100g). The data permit suggesting that under the influence of obsidan and hypoxia a stability index of surfactants and quantity of phospholipids decreased, while the quantity of lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine increased. Morphology studies show that after hypoxia and obsidan infusion oedema and cell destruction developed in the lung. The inhalation of exogenous surfactant increased stability index and quantity of phospholipids, decreased the quantity of lysophospholipids but did not eliminate morphological disorders in the lung induced by hypoxia and obsidan infusion.", 
    "96": "The antihypertensive effects of atenolol (Ate) or nitrendipine (Nit) alone or in combination (Ate+Nit) were studied in conscious experimental hypertensive rats. The hypotensive effects of single ig of Ate 20 + Nit 10 mg.kg-1 were rapid and persistent in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In renovascular hypertensive rats (RVHR) and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats (DHR), Ate+Nit (6 + 3, 20 + 10, 60 + 30 mg.kg-1) given ig once a day for 10 d reduced the blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. But Ate 20 mg.kg-1 or Nit 10 mg.kg-1 alone given ig once a day for 10 d caused no obvious reduction in blood pressure in RVHR, DHR, and SHR q = 1.32. These results revealed that the synergy is present in the antihypertensive action of Ate+Nit.", 
    "97": "Our previous experiments have suggested that besides the receptor cont and/or sensitivity a decrease of intracellular calcium level significantly participates in the mechanism of beta-blocker withdrawal 'rebound' phenomenon. This suggestion initiated studies in which possible changes in myocardial responsibility to cardioactive drugs were investigated in the condition of withdrawal of treatment with calcium entry blockers. The results showed increased cardiotoxicity of ouabain, aconitine and CaCl2, as well as an increased response of the heart to isoprenaline 24 hours after sudden cessation of treatment with verapamil (2 mg.kg-1 x 12 hours-1), diltiazem (3 mg.kg-1 x 12 hours-1) and nifedipine (0.5 mg.kg-1 x 12 hours-1). These results support the hypothesis of a common mechanism of the withdrawal syndrome of beta-lytics and calcium antagonists involving changes in intra-cellular calcium level.

    "98": "The enantioselective oral bioavailability of propranolol (PL) from 0-isovaleryl-PL was determined and compared with parent PL in beagle dogs. The bioavailability of the individual enantiomer from the prodrug increased about 2 fold. The AUC ratio between the S(-)- and R(+)-isomer posed at 0.89 which was statistically not different from that obtained after administration of PL alone. These features indicate that 0-isovaleryl-PL promises to be a potential prodrug of PL from the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic point of view.", 
    "99": "In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that beta-adrenoceptor blockers enhance the airway smooth muscle contraction to antigen, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. In the present work, we corroborated that propranolol (3.9 x 10(-6) M, 30 min incubation) induces hyperreactivity to antigenic challenge (cumulative concentration-response curve to ovalbumin, 0.01 to 100 micrograms/ml) in lung parenchyma strips from sensitized guinea-pigs. This hyperreactivity was enhanced by indomethacin (3.2 x 10(-5) M) and was unaffected by the lipoxygenase/cyclooxygenase inhibitor phenidone (1 x 10(-4) M). However, the histamine H1 receptor antagonist pyrilamine (1 x 10(-6) M) reduced the potentiation effect of propranolol. These results suggest that bronchoconstrictor prostaglandins, thromboxane A2 and leukotrienes, are not involved in the propranolol-induced lung parenchyma strips hyperreactivity to antigen in vitro, and that histamine may account, at least in part, for such propranolol effect.", 
    "100": "Pregnant Wistar rats were given by subcutaneous route 1 of 3 different adrenoreceptor blockers, 2 of them mainly beta-blockers. P5 and P7 group received propranolol (5 and 7 mg/kg respectively), L10 and L20 groups received labetalol (10 and 20 mg/kg) and B5 group received betaxolol (5 mg/kg). Drugs were given daily from the 7th to the 16th day of gestation. A control group received saline injections. 16 out 24 treated mothers delivered prematurely on the 21st day of gestation. Functional renal parameters were studied in neonates on the first day of life. Renal function of the full term rats prenatally exposed were compared with controls. Average body weight was higher in P5 but lower in L10-L20-B5 groups. Diuresis increased in L20. Creatinine clearance, urinary/plasmatic creatinine ratio and urea clearance decreased in L10-L20 groups and fractional excretion of H2O increased in L20. Thus these adreno- and beta-blockers given to pregnant rats induced a shorter gestation. Moderate functional renal effects were observed in all neonates."
