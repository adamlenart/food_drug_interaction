After solid phase extraction of 50.0 \u03bcL rat plasma in 96 well plate, a baseline resolution of arotinolol enantiomers was achieved on a CHIRALPAK AD-H column using the mobile phase of n-hexane and ethanol in 0.02% diethylamine (20:80, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.550 mL/min within 11.0 min. Acquisition of mass spectrometric data was performed on a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode with an ESI source using the transition m/z 372.1 \u2192 316.1 for (\u00b1)-arotinolol and m/z 376.1 \u2192 165.1 for haloperidol. The calibration curves of both enantiomers were linear over the range of 1.00-200.0 ng/mL (r(2)>0.992) and the lower limit of quantification was 1.00 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day precision ranged from 5.6% to 8.9% for R-(-)-arotinolol and 4.6-7.4% for S-(+)-arotinolol. Accuracy varied from 0.0% to 7.0% for R-(-)-arotinolol and 5.0-10.0% for S-(+)-arotinolol. For R-(-)-arotinolol, the recovery ranged from 87.2% to 99.2% and the matrix factor was 1.03-1.09; for S-(+)-arotinolol, the recovery ranged from 88.0% to 92.4% and the matrix factor was 0.84-0.95, both were not concentration dependent. The method was demonstrated with acceptable accuracy, precision and specificity for the determination of arotinolol enantiomers and has been successfully applied to a stereoselective pharmacokinetic study.",

In the first part, the generic use of on-line SPE with direct plasma injection or after protein precipitation was investigated for the quantitative analysis of talinolol. In the second part, pre-trapping and post-trapping dilution for on-line SPE is discussed for generic method development on an oxadiazole and its major metabolite. Finally, the difference of performance between direct plasma injection vs. off-line liquid-liquid extraction is also described for the quantification of buprenorphine and naltrexone down to 50 and 100 pg/ml using a 0.25 ml plasma aliquot. All assays were in human plasma and detection was performed by mass spectrometry detection either on simple or triple stage quadrupoles. Regardless of the tested strategy, assays were found linear, with precision and accuracy with <15% for all quality controls samples and <20% for lower limit of quantitation.",

    "6": "To improve the management of resistant hypertension, the French Society of Hypertension, an affiliate of the French Society of Cardiology, has published a set of eleven recommendations. The primary objective is to provide the most up-to-date information, based on the strongest scientific rationale and which is easily applicable to daily clinical practice for health professionals working within the French health system. Resistant hypertension is defined as uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) both on office measurements and confirmed by out-of-office measurements despite a therapeutic strategy comprising appropriate lifestyle and dietary measures and the concurrent use of three antihypertensive agents including a thiazide diuretic, a renin-angiotensin system blocker (ARB or ACEI) and a calcium channel blocker, for at least four weeks, at optimal doses. Treatment compliance must be closely monitored, as most factors that are likely to affect treatment resistance (excessive dietary salt intake, alcohol, depression and drug interactions, or vasopressors). If the diagnosis of resistant hypertension is confirmed, the patient should be referred to a hypertension specialist to screen for potential target organ damage and secondary causes of hypertension. The recommended treatment regimen is a combination therapy comprising four treatment classes, including spironolactone (12.5 to 25mg/day). In the event of a contraindication or a non-response to spironolactone, or if adverse effects occur, a \u03b2-blocker, an \u03b1-blocker, or a centrally acting antihypertensive drug should be prescribed. Because renal denervation is still undergoing assessment for the treatment of hypertension, this technique should only be prescribed by a specialist hypertension clinic.",

    "12": "A novel approach is described for the quantitative bioanalysis of drugs in blood samples by ionization of the analytes collected on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers by mass spectrometry (MS). The technique combines the attractive features of SPME microsampling using minimal sample volumes with the speed, selectivity, and sensitivity capabilities of MS detection. The method reported in this study involved generating gas-phase ions directly from SPME fibers without the need for any additional sample preparation or chromatographic separation; the entire process was completed within 5 min. Traditionally, analytes extracted by SPME fibers are desorbed by washing with suitable solvents followed by a transfer into a sample vial and subsequent liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis to quantify the amount of analyte extracted and thereby determining the analyte concentration in the matrix. These sample preparation steps are completely eliminated by inserting the SPME fiber directly into the MS. Physiologically relevant concentrations of metoprolol and propranolol in blood samples were measured over several orders of magnitude down to concentration levels of 10 ng/mL. This preliminary assessment of direct SPME-MS showed high sensitivity (ng/mL), acceptable reproducibility (<30%), and lack of carryover. This novel approach simplifies current bioanalytical procedures providing time and cost savings. It demonstrates considerable potential for qualitative and quantitative pharmaceutical bioanalysis as well as other areas of challenging environmental and food analysis.",

The FA-assisted photodegradation of propranolol was observed using UV-A irradiation (where propranolol is stable). Direct evidence indicated that the photodegradation resulted from the static quenching of the FA triplet state by propranolol via the electron transfer mechanism. The triplet state yield (\u03d5T\u22480.6%) and the T-T absorption coefficient (\u025bT(620 nm)\u22485\u00d710(4) M(-1) cm(-1)) were estimated for the first time by modeling the yields of the FA triplet state in the presence of propranolol.

Patients with ischemic cerebral infarction received clopidogrel (75 mg/day) for 7 days and were then subjected to a turbidimetric assay to determine platelet aggregation. Patients were then divided into a CR group and a clopidogrel-sensitive (CS) group. Demographic and clinical data between the two groups were compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors of CR. PCR products were sequenced to assess ABCB1 rs1045642 SNP genotype and allele frequencies in each group. In total, 303 patients were enrolled in the study; this included 51 CR cases (16.83%) and 252 CS cases (83.17%). Several parameters, including hypertension, diabetes, calcium channel blocker (CCB), \u03b2-receptor blocking agent and proton pump inhibitor use, and creatinine, fasting blood glucose, homocysteine (HCY), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in the CR group than in the CS group. Diabetes, hs-CRP-increased use of CCBs, and use of \u03b2-blockers were found to be independent risk factors for CR. However, ABCB1 gene rs1045642 polymorphism was not found to be an independent risk factor for CR. In conclusion, CR in ischemic stroke patients is associated with several independent risk factors, including diabetes, hs-CRP-increased use of CCBs, and use of \u03b2-blockers.

The model-based treatment difference (FC-TAF) was -1.516\u00a0mmHg (95% CI -2.044 to -0.988; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) demonstrating the superiority of FC over TAF. In the TS, related ocular adverse events (AEs) were more frequent for patients treated with FC compared to TIM (16.8% versus 6.4%), whereas related non-ocular AEs were more frequent with TIM compared to FC (2.1% versus 0.0%). In the PS, AEs were similarly distributed between FC and TAF. The frequency of conjunctival hyperemia of FC was low (6.4%).",

    "60": "The dissolving microneedle array (DMNA) offers a novel potential approach for transdermal delivery of biological macromolecular drugs and vaccines, because it can be as efficient as hypodermic injection and as safe and patient compliant as conventional transdermal delivery. However, effective needle drug distribution is the main challenge for clinical application of DMNA. This study focused on the mechanism and control of drug diffusion inside DMNA during the fabrication process in order to improve the drug delivery efficiency. The needle drug loading proportion (NDP) in DMNAs was measured to determine the influences of drug concentration gradient, needle drying step, excipients, and solvent of the base solution on drug diffusion and distribution. The results showed that the evaporation of base solvent was the key factor determining NDP. Slow evaporation of water from the base led to gradual increase of viscosity, and an approximate drug concentration equilibrium was built between the needle and base portions, resulting in NDP as low as about 6%. When highly volatile ethanol was used as the base solvent, the viscosity in the base rose quickly, resulting in NDP more than 90%. Ethanol as base solvent did not impact the insertion capability of DMNAs, but greatly increased the in vitro drug release and transdermal delivery from DMNAs. Furthermore, the drug diffusion process during DMNA fabrication was thoroughly investigated for the first time, and the outcomes can be applied to most two-step molding processes and optimization of the DMNA fabrication.", 
    "61": "Coated pellets offer a great potential as controlled drug delivery systems. However, constant drug release rates are difficult to achieve with this type of dosage forms if the drug is freely water-soluble. This is because diffusional mass transport generally plays a major role and with time the drug concentration within the system decreases, resulting in decreased concentration gradients, which are the driving forces for drug release. Thus, generally \"curve-shaped\" release profiles with monotonically decreasing slopes are observed. This type of release kinetics might be inappropriate for an efficient and safe drug treatment. Despite the great practical importance of this potentially crucial formulation challenge, surprisingly little is yet known on how to effectively address it. In this study, a novel approach is presented based on sequential layers of drug and polymer (initially free of drug) to provide a non-homogeneous initial drug distribution, combined with lag-time effects, and partial initial drug diffusion towards the pellet's core. Sugar and microcrystalline cellulose beads were used as starter cores, metoprolol succinate as freely soluble drug, ethylcellulose, and poly(vinyl acetate) as release rate controlling polymers. The type, number, thickness, and sequence of the drug and polymer layers were varied. Interestingly, a rather simple four layer system (two drug and two polymer layers) allowed providing about constant drug release during 8h. Compared to previously proposed coated pellets aiming at constant release of freely water-soluble drugs based on non-homogeneous initial drug distribution, the total coating level in this study was very much reduced: to only about 20%. Hence, the suggested formulation approach is relatively simple and can help overcoming a potentially major hurdle in practice. Its applicability has also been demonstrated for another type of drug: propranolol hydrochloride.",

Here we investigated the effects of \u03b4-tocopherol on NSC neural differentiation, maturation and its possible mechanisms. Neonatal rat NSCs were grown in suspended neurosphere cultures, and were identified by their expression of nestin protein and their capacity for self-renewal. Treatment with a low concentration of \u03b4-tocopherol induced a significant increase in the percentage of \u03b2-III-tubulin-positive cells. \u03b4-Tocopherol also stimulated morphological maturation of neurons in culture. We further observed that \u03b4-tocopherol stimulation increased the expression of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels. Moreover, a L-type specific Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil reduced the percentage of differentiated neurons after \u03b4-tocopherol treatment, and blocked the effects of \u03b4-tocopherol on NSC differentiation into neurons. Together, our study demonstrates that \u03b4-tocopherol may act through elevation of L-type calcium channel activity to increase neuronal differentiation.", 
    "71": "QT interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a measure of the duration of the ventricular depolarization and repolarization. In humans, prolongation of the QT interval is a known clinical risk factor for the development of ventricular arrhythmias including \u2018Torsades de Pointes\u2019 and possible sudden cardiac death. After oral administration, fluoxetine (FLX), as well as other selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors can affect cardiac autonomic control, including the QT interval. However, the action of centrally administered FLX on the QT interval has never been explored. Consequently, using the unanesthetized trout as an animal model, we sought to compare the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of FLX (5, 15 or 25 \u00b5g) on the QT interval of the ECG with the effects observed following i.c.v. injection of 5-HT (0.05, 0.5 or 5 nmol). The QT interval was corrected for the R\u2013R interval. The highest doses of centrally administered FLX and 5-HT induced a prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval reaching a maximum value of 5\u201310 min after injection (+8% and +6% respectively, P < 0.05). The intra-arterial (i.a.) injections of 5-HT and FLX were without significant effect on the QTc. The i.a. injection of blockers of the autonomic nervous system indicated that the sympathetic nervous system modulated the QTc interval. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that for the first time in any animal species, cardiac electrophysiology is sensitive to central 5-HT and that FLX within the brain may disrupt the autonomic control of ventricular repolarization.",

In untreated SEC, tumor volume (V) exhibited significant negative correlation with IL-10 levels and toll like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression with significant positive correlation with Hsp70 levels and iNOS activity. While propranolol in either doses caused reduction of tumor volume (V), and improved percentage tumor growth inhibition (% TGI) only its high dose exhibited significant impact on survival rate. Propranolol dose-dependent effect was evident for IL-10 and Hsp70, and even only the high dose significantly increased and decreased TLR2 and survivin, respectively. This comes in favor of recommending high dose of propranolol in cancer therapy. Nonetheless, use of low dose cannot be ignored when benefit to risk balance have to be considered.",

However, because of genome size, a proportionately small amount of variation creates ample opportunities for both rare mutations that may cause disease as well as more common genetic variations that may be important in disease modification or pharmacogenetics. Primarily because of the East African origin of modern humans, individuals of African ancestry (AA) exhibit greater degrees of genetic diversity than more recently established populations, such as those of European ancestry (EA) or Asian ancestry. Those population effects extend to differences in frequency of common gene variants that may be important in heart failure natural history or therapy. For cell-signaling mechanisms important in heart failure, we review and present new data for genetic variation between AA and EA populations. Data indicate that: 1) neurohormonal signaling mechanisms frequently (16 of the 19 investigated polymorphisms) exhibit racial differences in the allele frequencies of variants comprising key constituents; 2) some of these differences in allele frequency may differentially affect the natural history of heart failure in AA compared with EA individuals; and 3) in many cases, these differences likely play a role in observed racial differences in drug or device response.",

The feed samples were dispersed by water, then the analytes were extracted with acetonitrile containing 4% (v/v) ammonia and cleaned up by QuEChERS method with 25 mg octadecylsilyl (C18) and 50 mg primary secondary amine (PSA) adsorbents. The separation of compounds was carried on an Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C,8 column (50 mm x 4. 6 mm, 1. 8 \u03bcm) by a gradient elution using methanol-0. 1% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution as mobile phase. The analytes were detected by tandem mass spectrometry under multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) and quantified by the matrix-matched external standard method. The results showed that the calibration curves of the 18 \u03b2-agonists were linear in the range of 5 - 200 \u03bcg/L with correlation coefficients of 0. 9912-0. 9995.

In univariate analysis, male sex, implantation of larger valves, larger left ventricular end-diastolic volume, and beta-blocker or calcium-channel blocker treatment at dismissal were significantly associated with complete mass regression. In the multivariate model, odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) indicated that male sex (3.38 [1.39-8.26]) and beta-blocker or calcium-channel blocker treatment at dismissal (3.41 [1.40-8.34]) were associated with increased probability of complete left ventricular mass regression.

We present a case of a 35-year-old multigravid woman with Nail-Patella syndrome who developed an acute myocardial infarction secondary to spontaneous coronary artery dissection during labor which was not diagnosed until after delivery. We hypothesize that abnormal collagen fiber formation found in Nail-Patella syndrome may have put her at an increased risk of coronary dissection and myocardial infarction. Regardless of etiology, a delay in diagnosis of myocardial ischemia can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. In light of the increasing burden of cardiac disease in the obstetric population, clinicians should remain vigilant for signs of myocardial infarction and prepare for definitive diagnosis and treatment.",

Of these enzymes, PDE2 shapes \u03b21 adrenoceptor-dependent cardiac cAMP signaling, both in the right and left ventricular myocardium, but its role in regulating \u03b22 adrenoceptor-mediated responses is less well known. Our aim was to investigate possible differences in PDE2 transcription and activity between right (RV) and left (LV) rat ventricular myocardium, as well as its role in regulating \u03b22 adrenoceptor effects. The free walls of the RV and the LV were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rat hearts. Relative mRNA for PDE2 (quantified by qPCR) and PDE2 activity (evaluated by a colorimetric procedure and using the PDE2 inhibitor EHNA) were determined in RV and LV. Also, \u03b22 adrenoceptor-mediated effects (\u03b22-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol\u2009+\u2009\u03b21 adrenoceptor antagonist CGP-20712A) on contractility and cAMP concentrations, in the absence or presence of EHNA, were studied in the RV and LV. PDE2 transcript levels were less abundant in RV than in LV and the contribution of PDE2 to the total PDE activity was around 25% lower in the microsomal fraction of the RV compared with the LV. \u03b22 adrenoceptor activation increased inotropy and cAMP levels in the LV when measured in the presence of EHNA, but no such effects were observed in the RV, either in the presence or absence of EHNA. These results indicate interventricular differences in PDE2 transcript and activity levels, which may distinctly regulate \u03b22 adrenoceptor-mediated contractility and cAMP concentrations in the RV and in the LV of the rat heart.", 
    "131": "Plasma renin activity (PRA)-guided therapy has been proposed as a strategy for selecting antihypertensive medications matched to the patient's underlying pathophysiology. To date, there are only a few studies that have sought to compare a PRA-guided strategy to usual care. In one trial of 363 untreated patients, based on home blood pressure (BP) averages, PRA was predictive of responses to beta-blocker and thiazide diuretic as monotherapy and add-on therapy. In another trial of 77 treated but uncontrolled patients, a PRA-guided strategy was superior to clinical hypertension specialist care for guiding add-on or subtraction (stopping an agent that might cause a paradoxical pressor response) therapy. In the ValVET study, PRA-guided therapy was not superior to fixed-dose therapy consisting of an angiotensin receptor blocker and hydrochlorothiazide. One modeling study found a PRA-guided strategy may be cost-effective compared to standard care for younger patients and those with a greater number of cardiovascular risk factors. We conclude that additional, well-designed randomized trials with sufficient sample sizes comparing PRA-guided management to usual care are needed to clarify whether this strategy should be adopted broadly.",

Five of the included studies were parallel studies and the other eight were cross-over studies. The overall risk of bias is high in this review due to the small sample size and high risk of detection bias. Pindolol, celiprolol and alprenolol lowered SBP and DBP compared to placebo. Acebutolol lowered SBP but there was no clear evidence that it lowered DBP. There was no clear evidence that pindolol and oxprenolol lowered SBP or DBP.

Higher dose partial agonists did not appear to provide additional BP lowering effects compared to lower dose. The maximum BP lowering effect of the overall subclass occurred at the starting dose. Partial agonists reduced pulse pressure by 4 mmHg (95% CI, -5 to -2, very low evidence).

Based on the indirect comparison of the results in this review and two Cochrane reviews on angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which also used similar inclusion criteria as this review, the BP lowering effect appeared to be less than the effect in patients with mild to moderate elevated BP who were taking ACE inhibitors and ARBs based on an indirect comparison.

Carvedilol has been shown to possess multiple biological and pharmacological properties. The of the present study was to investigate the possible protective effect of carvedilol in SCI rats. An acute SCI rat model was established and neurological function was tested. After carvedilol (10 mg/kg, oral gavage) treatment for 21 days, the status of osteoporosis, neuron damage, astrocyte activation, inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis were evaluated in rats. Carvedilol significantly improved locomotor activity that was decreased by SCI. In addition, carvedilol promoted bone growth by regulating the expression of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand; RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), inactivating osteoclasts and thereby increasing bone mineral density in tibias. In addition, carvedilol reduced SCI-induced neural damage, increased neuron number and reduced astrocyte activation in the spinal cord. Furthermore, the production and mRNA expression of tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were significantly reduced, reduced glutathione content and superoxide dismutase activity were markedly increased and malondialdehyde content was markedly decreased in the spinal cords of carvedilol-treated rats. These results indicate that carvedilol exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects in SCI rats. In addition, the expression of Fas and Fas ligand was reduced by carvedilol treatment, which, in turn, reduced cleaved caspase 3 expression and finally decreased the number of apoptotic cells in the spinal cord. In conclusion, carvedilol promotes neurological function, reduces bone loss and attenuates cell damage after acute SCI in rats.",

    "161": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate minoxidil as a high permeability reference drug for Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS). The permeability of minoxidil was determined in in situ intestinal perfusion studies in rodents and permeability studies across Caco-2 cell monolayers. The permeability of minoxidil was compared with that of metoprolol, an FDA reference drug for BCS classification. In rat perfusion studies, the permeability of minoxidil was somewhat higher than that of metoprolol in the jejunum, while minoxidil showed lower permeability than metoprolol in the ileum. The permeability of minoxidil was independent of intestinal segment, while the permeability of metoprolol was region-dependent. Similarly, in mouse perfusion study, the jejunal permeability of minoxidil was 2.5-fold higher than that of metoprolol. Minoxidil and metoprolol showed similar permeability in Caco-2 study at apical pH of 6.5 and basolateral pH of 7.4. The permeability of minoxidil was independent of pH, while metoprolol showed pH-dependent transport in Caco-2 study. Minoxidil exhibited similar permeability in the absorptive direction (AP-BL) in comparison with secretory direction (BL-AP), while metoprolol had higher efflux ratio (ER > 2) at apical pH of 6.5 and basolateral pH of 7.4. No concentration-dependent transport was observed for either minoxidil or metoprolol transport in Caco-2 study. Verapamil did not alter the transport of either compounds across Caco-2 cell monolayers. The permeability of minoxidil was independent of both pH and intestinal segment in intestinal perfusion studies and Caco-2 studies. Caco-2 studies also showed no involvement of carrier mediated transport in the absorption process of minoxidil. These results suggest that minoxidil may be an acceptable reference drug for BCS high permeability classification. However, minoxidil exhibited higher jejunal permeability than metoprolol and thus to use minoxidil as a reference drug would raise the permeability criteria for BCS high permeability classification.",

Currently, the dual systems involved in CE chiral separation are mostly dual CDs systems, and the polysaccharides-based chiral dual system was reported in only one paper. To the best of our knowledge, the use of chondroitin sulfate C (CSC)-based dual system for enantiomeric separation has not been reported previously. Herein, four CSC-based chiral dual systems, namely CSC/glycogen, CSC/chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), CSC/hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-CD (HP-\u03b2-CD), as well as CSC/\u03b2-CD (\u03b2-CD), were evaluated for the first time for their enantioseparation capability by CE in this paper. During the course of the work, the influences of chiral selector concentration and buffer pH values on enantioseparation in dual systems were systematically investigated. Under the optimized conditions, the dual system consisting of CSC and glycogen exhibited better separations toward nefopam, duloxetine, sulconazole, atenolol, laudanosine, and cetirizine enantiomers compared to the single CSC or glycogen system. The combination of CSC and HP-\u03b2-CD improved the separation of amlodipine and chlorphenamine enantiomers. However, no synergistic effect was observed in the CSC/CSA and CSC/\u03b2-CD systems.", 
    "163": "The nanoparticles mediated enantioselective recognition of propranolol enantiomers through native cyclodextrin complexation has been investigated by using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The highly efficient chiral recognition mechanism is based on a synergistic interaction between spherical noble metal nanoparticles, propranolol enantiomers and native cyclodextrins (CDs). Amongst the native cyclodextrins, \u03b2-CD has the highest chiral recognition ability for propranolol enantiomers, due to its specific shape and cavity size, thus producing the largest difference between the recorded SERS spectra of the two hosted enantiomers. The molecular interaction mechanism responsible for enantioselectivity was furthermore proven by quantum chemical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The theoretical calculations and experimental SER spectra allowed the assignment of functional moieties involved in the chiral recognition mechanism. The most important factors governing the highly efficient chiral probing by SERS are the fundamentally different mechanism of interaction between the R- and S-enantiomers and \u03b2-CD and the strength of interaction between the nanoparticle surface and the two propranolol-CD complexes. The role of metallic nanoparticles in the enantioselective recognition process has been experimentally evaluated by using silver and gold nanoparticles as SERS substrates, given their ability to interact differently with the complexes. The viability of this new method for chiral discrimination has been demonstrated for both substrates and could open new avenues for these kinds of applications.",

Although hypertrophy is a high-priority target, we found that hiPSC-CMs were systematically unresponsive to hypertrophic signals such as the \u03b1-adrenoceptor (\u03b1AR) agonist phenylephrine (PE) compared to hESC-CMs. We investigated signaling at multiple levels to understand the underlying mechanism of this differential responsiveness. The expression of the normal \u03b11AR gene, ADRA1A, was reversibly silenced during differentiation, accompanied by ADRA1B upregulation in either cell type. ADRA1B signaling was intact in hESC-CMs, but not in hiPSC-CMs. We observed an increased tonic activity of inhibitory kinase pathways in hiPSC-CMs, and inhibition of antihypertrophic kinases revealed hypertrophic increases. There is tonic suppression of cell growth in hiPSC-CMs, but not hESC-CMs, limiting their use in investigation of hypertrophic signaling. These data raise questions regarding the hiPSC-CM as a valid model for certain aspects of cardiac disease.",

Using a Ca(2+)-jump protocol, we measured the effect of the DCM-causing mutation ACTC E361G on the equilibrium and kinetic parameters of Ca(2+) regulation of contractility in single transgenic mouse heart myofibrils. We used propranolol treatment of mice to reduce the level of troponin I and myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C) phosphorylation in their hearts before isolating the myofibrils. In nontransgenic mouse myofibrils, the Ca(2+) sensitivity of force was increased, the fast relaxation phase rate constant, kREL, was reduced, and the length of the slow linear phase, tLIN, was increased when the troponin I phosphorylation level was reduced from 1.02 to 0.3 molPi/TnI (EC50 P/unP = 1.8 \u00b1 0.2, p < 0.001). Native myofibrils from ACTC E361G transgenic mice had a 2.4-fold higher Ca(2+) sensitivity than nontransgenic mouse myofibrils. Strikingly, the Ca(2+) sensitivity and relaxation parameters of ACTC E361G myofibrils did not depend on the troponin I phosphorylation level (EC50 P/unP = 0.88 \u00b1 0.17, p = 0.39). Nevertheless, modulation of the Ca(2+) sensitivity of ACTC E361G myofibrils by sarcomere length or EMD57033 was indistinguishable from that of nontransgenic myofibrils. Overall, EC50 measured in different conditions varied over a 7-fold range. The time course of relaxation, as defined by tLIN and kREL, was correlated with EC50 but varied by just 2.7- and 3.3-fold, respectively. Our results confirm that troponin I phosphorylation specifically alters the Ca(2+) sensitivity of isometric tension and the time course of relaxation in cardiac muscle myofibrils. Moreover, the DCM-causing mutation ACTC E361G blunts this phosphorylation-dependent response without affecting other parameters of contraction, including length-dependent activation and the response to EMD57033.",

The survey was based on a questionnaire sent via the Internet to the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) electrophysiology research network centres. The following topics were explored: patient and treatment selection, techniques and equipment, treatment outcomes and complications. The vast majority of paediatric arrhythmias concerns children older than 1 year and patients with grown-up congenital heart disease. In 65% of the hospitals there is a specialized paediatric centre, and the most commonly observed arrhythmias include Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardias (90.24%). The medical staff performing paediatric catheter ablations in Europe are mainly adult electrophysiology teams (82.05% of the centres). Radiofrequency is the preferred energy source used for paediatric arrhythmia ablation. Catheter ablation is only chosen if two or more antiarrhythmic drugs have failed (94.59% of the centres). The majority of the centres use flecainide (37.8%) or atenolol (32.4%) as their first choice drug for prevention of recurrent supraventricular arrhythmias. While none of the centres performed catheter ablation in asymptomatic infants with pre-excitation, 29.7% recommend ablation in asymptomatic children and adolescents. The preferred choice for pacemaker leads in infants less than 1 year old is implantation of epicardial leads in 97.3% of the centres, which continues to be the routine even in patients between 1 and 5 years of age as reported by 75.68% of the hospitals.

Acute treatment with PYR increased cardiac vagal (86\u00b17 vs. 44\u00b15 beats/min) and decreased sympathetic tone (-31\u00b18 vs. -69\u00b17 beats/min). Different animals were implanted with ECG electrodes and catheters. A large MI was induced via left coronary artery ligation after basal recordings. Rats received PYR (n=14) or saline (n=14) 10-15 min after MI, and the recordings lasted up to 4 h. In part of the animals, hearts were removed for connexin43 quantification after all procedures. MI elicited a fall in AP (-45\u00b15 mmHg), a progressive rise in HR (26\u00b114 beats/min), and an increase in corrected QT interval (33\u00b113 ms). PYR elicited a prompt bradycardia (-50\u00b114 beats/min) that returned to basal levels over time, and it prevented the lengthening of the corrected QT interval. Treatment with PYR increased by \u223c20% the occurrence of rats free of arrhythmias after MI.

    "204": "The contribution of angiotensin II (ANG II) to renal and tubular fibrosis has been widely reported. Recent studies have shown that collecting duct cells can undergo mesenchymal transition suggesting that collecting duct cells are involved in interstitial fibrosis. The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway plays an essential role in development, organogenesis, and tissue homeostasis; however, the dysregulation of this pathway has been linked to fibrosis. In this study, we investigated whether AT1 receptor activation induces the expression of fibronectin and collagen I via the \u03b2-catenin pathway in mouse collecting duct cell line M-1. ANG II (10(-7) M) treatment in M-1 cells increased mRNA, protein levels of fibronectin and collagen I, the \u03b2-catenin target genes (cyclin D1 and c-myc), and the myofibroblast phenotype. These effects were prevented by candesartan, an AT1 receptor blocker. Inhibition of the \u03b2-catenin degradation with pyrvinium pamoate (pyr; 10(-9) M) prevented the ANG II-induced expression of fibronectin, collagen I, and \u03b2-catenin target genes. ANG II treatment promoted the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin protein in a time-dependent manner. Because phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) inhibits \u03b2-catenin degradation, we further evaluated the effects of ANG II and ANG II plus pyr on p-ser9-GSK-3\u03b2 levels. ANG II-dependent upregulation of \u03b2-catenin protein levels was correlated with GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation. These effects were prevented by pyr.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of filler solubility on the drug delivery process of matrix tablets containing drugs with different water-solubility properties and stored at elevated temperature. The results demonstrated that in the case of propranolol HCl (highly water-soluble) tablet matrices, soluble lactose promoted drug release, whereas, a stable release of drug was observed with insoluble DCP. A drug release pattern similar to the propranolol HCl formulation containing DCP was obtained for hydrophilic matrix tablets containing either lactose or DCP for the less water-soluble drug, zonisamide. In the case of the partially water-soluble drug, theophylline, formulated with lower molecular weight PEO 750, drug release increased considerably in the presence of both fillers with increasing storage time, however a stable release rate (similar to fresh samples) was observed in the case of higher molecular weight PEO 303 tablet matrices containing theophylline with either lactose or DCP.

We also compared the effects of isoflurane (2%) inhalation anesthesia, intraperitoneal propofol (50 or 100 mg/kg), and pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) on ECG in mice. Isoflurane inhalation and pentobarbital anesthesia were both associated with an acceptable heart rate (HR) range (ca. 450 - 500 bpm). In contrast, high-dose propofol anesthesia significantly decreased the HR. Importantly, propofol anesthesia led to significantly reduced responses to propranolol, a \u03b2-blocker, suggesting that it affects sympathetic tonus and is not suitable for the evaluation of cardiovascular or sympathetic function. Propofol also reduced the response to atropine, indicative of suppression of mouse parasympathetic nerve activity.

Evaluation of relatives at risk: Hearing evaluation by standard newborn hearing screening programs and electrocardiograms for at-risk sibs; molecular genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis if the pathogenic variants in an affected family member are known. Pregnancy management: Consideration should be given as to whether a mother who has a fetus affected with JLNS herself has long QT syndrome. Other: Train family members in cardiopulmonary resuscitation; wear an ID bracelet explaining the diagnosis; notify local emergency medical services of high-risk persons with JLNS.", 
    "214": "JLNS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Parents of a child with JLNS are usually heterozygotes; rarely, only one parent is a carrier and the other pathogenic variant is de novo. Parents may or may not have the long QT syndrome (LQTS) phenotype. At conception, each sib of an affected individual usually has a 25% chance of being affected with JLNS, a 50% chance of being a carrier of a JLNS pathogenic variant and at risk for LQTS, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.", 
    "215": "Sexual dysfunction is a potential side effect of cardiovascular drugs: this article is a critical review of the current literature. Many studies have been published on this topic. Most of these studies are not methodologically robust, few are RCTs and most did not use a validated rating scale to evaluate sexual functioning. In addition, other methodological flaws limit greatly the conclusions of these studies. Most studies relate to male populations and only a few have been conducted on women. Also, the majority of studies on sexual dysfunction induced by cardiovascular drugs relate to antihypertensive drugs. While there is evidence to suggest that older antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, beta-blockers, centrally acting agents) have a negative impact on erectile function, newer agents seem to have either neutral (ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists) or beneficial effects (i. e., angiotensin receptor blockers, nebivolol). Other cardiovascular drugs analyzed in this review also appear to have an inhibitory action on sexual function. For men, there is some weak evidence supporting the use of specific treatment strategies for sexual dysfunction associated with these drugs.",

    "218": "Aortic-root dissection is the leading cause of death in Marfan's syndrome. Studies suggest that with regard to slowing aortic-root enlargement, losartan may be more effective than beta-blockers, the current standard therapy in most centers.", 
    "219": "We conducted a randomized trial comparing losartan with atenolol in children and young adults with Marfan's syndrome. The primary outcome was the rate of aortic-root enlargement, expressed as the change in the maximum aortic-root-diameter z score indexed to body-surface area (hereafter, aortic-root z score) over a 3-year period. Secondary outcomes included the rate of change in the absolute diameter of the aortic root; the rate of change in aortic regurgitation; the time to aortic dissection, aortic-root surgery, or death; somatic growth; and the incidence of adverse events.", 
    "220": "From January 2007 through February 2011, a total of 21 clinical centers enrolled 608 participants, 6 months to 25 years of age (mean [\u00b1SD] age, 11.5\u00b16.5 years in the atenolol group and 11.0\u00b16.2 years in the losartan group), who had an aortic-root z score greater than 3.0. The baseline-adjusted rate of change in the mean (\u00b1SE) aortic-root z score did not differ significantly between the atenolol group and the losartan group (-0.139\u00b10.013 and -0.107\u00b10.013 standard-deviation units per year, respectively; P=0.08). Both slopes were significantly less than zero, indicating a decrease in the aortic-root diameter relative to body-surface area with either treatment. The 3-year rates of aortic-root surgery, aortic dissection, death, and a composite of these events did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups.", 
    "221": "Among children and young adults with Marfan's syndrome who were randomly assigned to losartan or atenolol, we found no significant difference in the rate of aortic-root dilatation between the two treatment groups over a 3-year period.
