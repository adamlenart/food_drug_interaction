From the evidence of clinical trials, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and calcium channel blockers would be the first choices, and the combination therapy with diuretics or alpha-blockers would be the next choice. However, since the effect of anti-hypertensive drugs on plasma lipids is much less than that of the lipid-lowering drugs, anti-hypertensive drugs should be chosen in consideration of the patient's complicated diseases, because elderly people are often affected with other more serious complications such as ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, renal dysfunction, and chronic lung disease. If hyperlipidemia remains after anti-hypertensive drugs are used, the use of lipid-lowering drugs such as statins is recommended.",

The importance of treating hypertension in the elderly as a means of preventing chronic heart failure was emphasized by recent trials including meta-analysis. Fastidious blood pressure control by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists along with low-doses diuretics as first-line therapy is recommended. However, many elderly patients with hypertension have other risk factors, target organ damages and associated cardiovascular conditions, to which the choice of the first drug should be tailored. In such cases, beta blockers, aldosterone blockers and long-acting Ca antagonists are also recommended.",

The dogs studied were male (29 of 31) and the drugs were given intracoronary. The slope of CPFR during long diastole was evaluated as an index of coronary vascular resistance, during alpha1- or alpha2-adrenergic stimulation or inhibition under anesthesia in the baseline and failing state after 3 weeks of rapid ventricular pacing. Resting coronary blood flow and CPFR did not change in the failing state from the baseline state. Neither alpha1 nor alpha2 stimulation changed the slope of CPFR in the baseline state. However, in the failing state, alpha1 stimulation decreased the slope of CPFR by 23 +/- 5% (P < .05), whereas alpha2 stimulation increased it by 73 +/- 10% (P < .05), which was nearly abolished by pretreatment with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester.",

    "19": "Heart failure represents a major public health problem in the industrialized countries and despite of optimal medical treatment its mortality remains high. The history of its management reflects growth and changes in our understanding of its pathophysiology. In the past, pharmacological treatment of heart failure was aimed only at relieving edema and improving hemodynamics. Today, however, a major aim of treatment is to antagonize the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, to avert harmful effects of neurohormonal activation on the myocardium and peripheral vessels. Currently, the major pharmacological treatments for heart failure are diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and (in NYHA classes III-IV) aldosterone antagonists. Some patients may also require specific treatment with additional drugs (e.g. anti-arrhythmia agents, anticoagulants, or vasodilators) or procedures such as coronary revascularization, or implantable devices such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, or resynchronization devices. Patients with end-stage heart failure may require cardiac transplantation or ventricular assist devices.

The individual time points for intraocular pressures were not statistically different between groups. Both groups statistically reduced the intraocular pressures from baseline for each time point and for the diurnal curve (p < 0.05). Regarding ocular safety and tolerability, there was more conjunctival hyperemia with bimatoprost (n = 15) than with DTFC (n = 7, p = 0.013) and more burning and stinging with DTFC (n = 12) than with bimatoprost (n = 0, p = 0.0005).

    "24": "Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) is well known to terminate cell signaling by sorting activated receptors to the MVB/lysosomal pathway. Here we identify a distinct role of Hrs in promoting rapid recycling of endocytosed signaling receptors to the plasma membrane. This function of Hrs is specific for receptors that recycle in a sequence-directed manner, in contrast to default recycling by bulk membrane flow, and is distinguishable in several ways from previously identified membrane-trafficking functions of Hrs/Vps27p. In particular, Hrs function in sequence-directed recycling does not require other mammalian Class E gene products involved in MVB/lysosomal sorting, nor is receptor ubiquitination required. Mutational studies suggest that the VHS domain of Hrs plays an important role in sequence-directed recycling. Disrupting Hrs-dependent recycling prevented functional resensitization of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor, converting the temporal profile of cell signaling by this prototypic G protein-coupled receptor from sustained to transient. These studies identify a novel function of Hrs in a cargo-specific recycling mechanism, which is critical to controlling functional activity of the largest known family of signaling receptors.", 
    "25": "The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is modulated by various extracellular factors, including Na+, organic or inorganic cations, and serine proteases. To identify the effect of the divalent Ni2+ cation on ENaCs, we compared the Na+ permeability and amiloride kinetics of Xenopus ENaCs (xENaCs) and rat ENaCs (rENaCs) heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We found that the channel cloned from the kidney of the clawed toad Xenopus laevis [wild-type (WT) xENaC] was stimulated by external Ni2+, whereas the divalent cation inhibited the channel cloned from the rat colon (WT rENaC). The kinetics of amiloride binding were determined using noise analysis of blocker-induced fluctuation in current adapted for the transoocyte voltage-clamp method, and Na+ conductance was assessed using the dual electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) technique. The inhibitory effect of Ni2+ on amiloride binding is not species dependent, because Ni2+ decreased the affinity (mainly reducing the association rate constant) of the blocker in both species in competition with Na+. Importantly, using the TEVC method, we found a prominent difference in channel conductance at hyperpolarizing voltage pulses. In WT xENaCs, the initial ohmic current response was stimulated by Ni2+, whereas the secondary voltage-activated current component remained unaffected. In WT rENaCs, only a voltage-dependent block by Ni2+ was obtained. To further study the origin of the xENaC stimulation by Ni2+, and based on the rationale of the well-known high affinity of Ni2+ for histidine residues, we designed alpha-subunit mutants of xENaCs by substituting histidines that were expressed in oocytes, together with WT beta- and gamma-subunits. Changing His215 to Asp in one putative amiloride-binding domain (WYRFHY) in the extracellular loop between Na+ channel membrane segments M1 and M2 had no influence on the stimulatory effect of Ni2+, and neither did complete deletion of this segment. Next, we mutated His416 flanked by His411 and Cys417, a unique site for possible heavy metal ion chelation, and, with this quality, most proximal (approximately 100 amino acids upstream of the second putative amiloride binding site at the pore entrance), was found localized at M2. Replacing His416 with arginine, aspartate, tyrosine, and alanine clearly affected amiloride binding in all cases, as well as Na+ conductance, as expressed in the xENaC current-voltage relationship, especially with regard to aspartate and tyrosine. However, similarly to those obtained with the WYRFHY stretch, none of these mutations could either abolish the stimulating effect of Ni2+ or reverse it to an inhibitory type.", 
    "26": "The use of beta-blockers has emerged as a beneficial treatment for cardiac hypertrophy. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is tightly regulated in the ventricular myocardium. However, the expression of HIF-1alpha in cardiac hypertrophy due to pressure overload and after treatment with beta-blocker is little known. To evaluate the effect of carvedilol on both myocardial HIF-1alpha expression and cardiac hypertrophy, infra-renal aortic banding was performed for 4 weeks in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Carvedilol at 50 mg/kg body weight per day after surgery was given. Heart weight and the ratio of heart weight and body weight increased significantly after aortic banding for 4 weeks in the absence of drug treatment. Mean arterial pressure increased from 80 +/- 9 mmHg in the sham group to 94 +/-5 mmHg (p < 0.001) in the banding group. Echocardiography showed concentric hypertrophy after aortic banding. Mean arterial pressure decreased after treatment with carvedilol. The increased wall thickness and heart weight was reversed to normal by carvedilol. Western blot showed that HIF-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) proteins were up-regulated and nerve growth factor-beta (NGF-beta) down-regulated in the banding group. Treatment with valsartan, doxazosin, or N-acetylcysteine did not significantly affect HIF-1alpha and VEGF proteins expression in the banding groups. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF and BNP increased and mRNA of NGF-beta decreased in the banding group. Treatment with carvedilol reversed both protein and mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, BNP, and NGF-beta to the baseline values. Increased immunohistochemical labeling of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP in the ventricular myocardium was observed in the banding group and carvedilol again normalized the labeling. In conclusion, HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP mRNA and protein expression were up-regulated, while NGF-beta mRNA and protein was downregulated in the rat model of pressure-overloaded cardiac hypertrophy. Treatment with carvedilol is associated with a reversal of abnormal regulation of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, BNP, and NGF-beta in the hypertrophic myocardium.",

Propranolol (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or nadolol (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) administered 30 mins before MDMA had no effect on the thermogenic response. In contrast, carvedilol (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) administered 15 mins before or after MDMA prevented this hyperthermic response.

The MEP beta-chain gene locus on chromosome 18 has been linked to a heightened risk of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in patients with type 2 diabetes. This study evaluated 1) whether MEP-alpha and MEP-beta gene and protein expression are altered in db/db mice before the onset of DN and 2) the role of MEP-alpha in the pathogenesis of DN and the impact of the renin-angiotensin system on this interaction in two experimental models of diabetes. MEP-alpha and MEP-beta gene and protein expression were evaluated in db/db mice, 13-14 wk of age, compared with lean C57BLKS/J littermate animals. A treatment study was then performed in which db/db mice and controls were assigned to one of three groups: control (C) water, no therapy; ACE inhibitor therapy, enalapril (EN)-treated water, 50 mg/l; ANG II receptor type 1 blocker (ARB) therapy, losartan (LOS)-treated water, 500 mg/l. Treatment was started at 8 wk of age and continued for 52 wk. Male Sprague-Dawley rats with diabetes for 52 wk following a single dose of streptozocin (STZ; 60 mg/kg) were also studied. At 13.5 wk of age, MEP-alpha and MEP-beta kidney mRNA abundance and protein expression were significantly lower in db/db mice compared with lean controls, with greater changes in MEP-beta (P < 0.05). In the treatment study, EN ameliorated and LOS exacerbated DN in db/db mice. BBM MEP A enzymatic activity and MEP-alpha protein content were lower in db/db mice vs. control nonobese mice at 52 wk (P < 0.02). EN-treated db/db mice showed increased MEP A activity, MEP-alpha content in BBM, decreased urinary MEP-alpha excretion, and enhanced BBM staining for MEP-alpha protein vs. C and LOS-treated db/db mice. In nonobese mice, EN and LOS treatment had no effect on MEP-alpha expression. In rats with STZ-induced diabetes for 52 wk, urinary MEP-alpha excretion was increased and MEP A activity and MEP-alpha protein content per milligram of BBM protein were decreased compared with age-matched control animals (P < 0.05). These results indicate that db/db mice manifest decreased MEP-alpha and MEP-beta gene and protein expression, before the development of overt kidney disease. Moreover, in db/db mice with DN and rats with STZ-diabetes, there was an inverse relationship between renal MEP-alpha content and the severity of the renal injury. Treatment with an ACE inhibitor was more effective than ARB in ameliorating DN in db/db mice, a change that correlated with alterations in urinary excretion and BBM content of MEP-alpha. MEP-alpha may play a role in the pathogenesis of DN and the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy on the progression of diabetic kidney disease may be related, in part, to its impact on renal MEP-alpha expression.",

The 20 patients of the 1st group were administered nebivolol in a dose of 1.25 to 5 mg per day, the 20 patients of the 2nd group - betalok ZOK in a dose of 12.5 to 100 mg per day. The course therapy lasted 8 weeks. The effects of the treatment were evaluated using paired veloergometry, echoCG, and lipid spectrum analysis. The study found that nebivolol in a mean dose of 4.2 +/- 0.3 mg per day and betalok ZOK in a dose of 46.5 +/- 6.2 mg per day reduced the frequency and severety of angina attacks (by 73.8% and 67.8%, respectively) and daily nitroglycerine uptake (by 78.6% and 69.1%, respectively), and increased activity tolerance (by 7.9% and 25.3%, respectively). None of the preparations displayed any adverse effects on carbohydrate exchange and blood lipid spectrum. Nebivolol, unlike betalok ZOK, significantly (p = 0.02) reduced triglyceride blood level by 29%. Thus, the new generation cardioselective beta1-adrenoblockers nebivolol and metoprolol CR/XL (betalok ZOK) provide anti-ischemic and metabolic effects in patients with CHD and postinfarction LV dysfunction, associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nebivolol is preferable as far as blood lipid spectrum is concerned.",

In reduction of general and cardiovascular mortality in the given category of patients atenolol was not less effective than the lipophilic BAB bisoprolol (in comparison with the results of the CIBIS II study). Sudden death was typical of the patients with DC, whereas most of PC patients died of repeated myocardial infarctions and progressive CHF. There was no significant difference between lethality in DC and PIC groups (p > 0.05).

    "55": "In several water-breathing fish species, beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation by noradrenaline leads to a decrease in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels, as opposed to an increase in air-breathing mammals. We hypothesised that this change in adrenergic control is related to the mode of breathing. Therefore, cannulated air-breathing African catfish were infused for 90 min with noradrenaline or with the nonselective beta-agonist, isoprenaline. To identify the receptor type involved, a bolus of either a selective beta1-antagonist (atenolol) or a selective beta2-antagonist (ICI 118,551) was injected 15 min prior to the isoprenaline infusion. Both noradrenaline and isoprenaline led to an expected rise in glucose concentration. Isoprenaline combined with both the beta1- and beta2-antagonist led to higher glucose concentrations than isoprenaline alone. This could indicate the presence of a stimulatory beta-adrenoceptor different from beta1 and beta2-adrenoceptors; these two receptors thus seemed to mediate a reduction in plasma glucose concentration. Both noradrenaline and isoprenaline led to a significant decrease in FFA concentration. Whereas the beta1-antagonist had no effect, the beta2-antagonist reduced the decrease in FFA concentration, indicating the involvement of beta2-adrenoceptors. It is concluded that the air-breathing African catfish reflects water-breathing fish in the adrenergic control of plasma FFA and glucose levels.",

For EIU, 8-week-old Lewis rats received an intravenous injection of 160 microg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Salmonella typhimurium. GLC756, timolol, or betamethasone, as positive control, were administered either topically (0.4, 0.5, and 0.1%, respectively, 16-times 20 microl eye drops during 48 hr) or systemically (1 mg kg(-1) subcutaneously for 5 days). Protein content, released TNF-alpha, the number of cells as well as cells expressing TNF-alpha were determined in aqueous humor 48 hr after LPS-injection and served as parameters for inflammation. LPS induced an increase of protein content, infiltrating cells and cells expressing TNF-alpha in the aqueous humor. Topical and systemic administration of GLC756 and betamethasone, almost completely suppressed the increase of protein content and betamethasone in addition also suppressed the number of cells in aqueous humor. In conclusion, the almost complete suppression of LPS-induced protein increase in aqueous humor by GLC756 suggests an additional anti-inflammatory potential of dopaminergic compounds in glaucoma treatment.

In both groups, dobutamine infusion did not increase the cardiac index or the heart rate, but was associated with an increase in mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance index and mean pulmonary arterial pressure in a dose-dependent manner. The haemodynamic responses to dobutamine infusion were similar in the two groups. We conclude that pre-operative medication with beta-blockers reduced the inotropic and chronotropic effects of dobutamine infusion.

The administration of nilvadipine did not affect the number of the hippocampal CA1 cells of 40-week-old mice. Age-dependent increases in ubiquitin immunoreactivity were observed in the hippocampal CA1 neurons up to 59 weeks after birth. The administration of nilvadipine prevented dose-dependently the increases in the number of ubiquitin-immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampal CA1 sector of 40-week-old mice. S100,beta immunoreactivity was unchanged in the hippocampal CA1 sector up to 40 weeks after birth. In 59-week-old mice, the level of staining of S100beta-immunoreactive cells increased significantly in the hippocampal CA1 sector. The administration of nilvadipine decreased dose-dependently the number of S 100beta-immunoreactive cells in the hippocampal CA1 sector of 40-week-old mice. The present study demonstrates that age-related increases in ubiquitin system may play a pivotal role in protecting neuronal cell damage during aging. In contrast, our results suggest that expression of S 100beta protein in the hippocampal CA1 sector may play an exacerbating factor in some neuronal cells damaged by aging. Our results also demonstrate that nilvadipine, a dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blocker, can prevent dose-dependently the increases in the ubiquitin immunoreactive neurons and decrease the number of S100beta immunoreactive cells in the hippocampal CA1 neurons of aged mice. These results suggest that nilvadipine may offer a new approach for the treatment of neuronal dysfunction in aged humans.",

Polymorphic forms of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors exist, which might contribute to the variable clinical outcomes that are observed with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. There is evidence for a low-affinity state of beta1-adrenoceptors and ventricular beta3-adrenoceptors, and these are discussed in the context of heart failure.

In the present work, we have cloned a novel GAT from the retina of the skate (Raja erinacea). The clone codes for a 622 amino acid protein whose sequence has highest similarity to the GABA/beta-alanine transporter of the electric ray (Torpedo marmorata) (88% identity) and the GAT-3 isolated from rat brain (75% identity). The protein was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and characterized using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Application of GABA induced a dose-dependent inward current, with 8 muM GABA producing a half-maximal response. The current required the presence of extracellular sodium and was unaffected by the GABA receptor blocker picrotoxin or the GAT-1 specific antagonist NO-711. The high homology between the cloned skate GABA transporter and the GAT-3 equivalents of other species, coupled with the strikingly similar pharmacological profile to GAT-3s of other species, lead us to conclude that we had cloned the GAT-3 homologue for the skate. Polyclonal antibodies specific to GAT-3 and the previously cloned skate GAT-1 transporter were used to examine the distribution of GAT-3 and GAT-1 immunoreactivity in the retina and in isolated cells of the skate.

    "107": "Perioperative cardiac event is relatively high in vascular surgery for arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO), which is a major cause of postoperative death. ACC/AHA guideline and revised cardiac risk index (CRI) were advocated to assess risk factor stratification and to manage risk reduction. ACC/AHA guideline categorized all vascular procedures except carotid endarterectomy as high risk. Because almost all patients with ASO were aged and/or inactive, noninvasive testing was necessary in almost all patients by the stepwise bayesian strategy. Patients with revised CRI less than 1 point dominated about three fourths of all patients, whose prevalence and incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) were 2.5% and 1.3%, respectively. It seemed appropriate to apply noninvasive testing only for patients with revised CRI more than 2 points, and high risk indicated coronary angiography. Electrocardigrams obtained at baseline, immediately, and on the first 2 days after surgery appear to be cost-effective to diagnose IHD. Use of cardiac biomarkers was reserved for patients at high risk and those with clinical, or ECG evidence of myocardial infarction (MI). Beta-blockers or alpha-agonists were effective to reduce incidence of perioperative IHD. Although even optimal preoperative assessment and perioperative management, some patients will have perioperative MI.", 
    "108": "The evaluation and management of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing noncardiac surgery are becoming important medical issues in modern society with the aging of the population and prevalence of CAD. For patients with CAD, medical therapy (beta-blockers, statins), percutaneous coronary artery intervention (PCI) with/without stenting, and coronary artery bypass grafting have been the modalities for management. Although balloon angioplasty is effective in selected patients, bare-metal stents (BMS) require post-PCI antiplatelet therapy for 4-6 weeks delaying noncardiac procedures As recently reported patients with drug-eluting stents (DES) experienced late stentthrombosis due to discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy in the long-term period before noncardiac surgery, suggesting the need for life-long anticoagulant therapy after DES placement. Recently, offpump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) has become a safe and effective procedure for direct coronary revascularization. OPCAB, without cardiopulmonary bypass and its adverse effects, can be performed simultaneously with noncardiac surgery such as carotid endoarterectomy, abdominal aortic aneurysm resection, and peripheral arterial reconstruction. OPCAB is a promising option as a simultaneous or staged procedure for patients with CAD and noncardiac disease.",

In the present study, we studied the cardiovascular effects of injections of L-glutamate into the vMPFC of unanaesthetized rats and the mechanisms of these effects. Male Wistar rats were used and L-glutamate was microinjected in the vMPFC in a final volume of 200 nL. Microinjections of L-glutamate (9, 27, 81, 150 or 300 nmol) caused long-lasting, dose-related pressor and tachycardic responses in unanaesthetized rats. No differences were observed among cardiovascular responses when L-glutamate was injected into the three sub-areas that comprise the vMPFC, namely the prelimbic, the infralimbic and the dorsal peduncular cortices. No responses were observed when the dose of 81 nmol of L-glutamate was microinjected into surrounding structures such as the cingulate cortex area 1, the corpus callosum and the tenia tecta, indicating a predominant action on the vMPFC. The cardiovascular response to L-glutamate into the vMPFC was blocked by intravenous pretreatment with the ganglion blocker pentolinium (10 mg/kg, i.v.) or the beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (1.5 mg/kg, i.v.), supporting the involvement of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system in the response to L-glutamate. Pretreatment with the muscarinic antagonist homatropine methyl bromide (1 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced the latency to the onset of the pressor and tachycardic responses to L-glutamate injected into the vMPFC without significant effects on response duration or maximum effect. We conclude that stimulation of the vMPFC with L-glutamate caused pressor and tachycardic responses in unanaesthetized rats, responses which were dependent on cardiac sympathetic nerve activation and were potentiated by blockade of peripheral muscarinic receptors.",

While vasoactive agents remain the most important pharmacological treatment of esophageal variceal bleeding, antibiotic prophylaxis is also increasingly recognized to play a role in prevention of variceal rebleeding. The benefit of beta-blocker has now been extended to halt the progression of esophageal varices and combination of beta-blocker and band ligation remains the most cost-effective treatment strategy for secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding.

    "134": "Bilateral alternation of muscle contractions requires reciprocal inhibition between the two sides of the hindbrain and spinal cord, and disruption of this inhibition should lead to simultaneous activation of bilateral muscles. At 1 day after fertilization, wild-type zebrafish respond to mechanosensory stimulation with multiple fast alternating trunk contractions, whereas bandoneon (beo) mutants contract trunk muscles on both sides simultaneously. Similar simultaneous contractions are observed in wild-type embryos treated with strychnine, a blocker of the inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR). This result suggests that glycinergic synaptic transmission is defective in beo mutants. Muscle voltage recordings confirmed that muscles on both sides of the trunk in beo are likely to receive simultaneous synaptic input from the CNS. Recordings from motor neurons revealed that glycinergic synaptic transmission was missing in beo mutants. Furthermore, immunostaining with an antibody against GlyR showed clusters in wild-type neurons but not in beo neurons. These data suggest that the failure of GlyRs to aggregate at synaptic sites causes impairment of glycinergic transmission and abnormal behavior in beo mutants. Indeed, mutations in the GlyR beta-subunit, which are thought to be required for proper localization of GlyRs, were identified as the basis for the beo mutation. These data demonstrate that GlyRbeta is essential for physiologically relevant clustering of GlyRs in vivo. Because GlyR mutations in humans lead to hyperekplexia, a motor disorder characterized by startle responses, the zebrafish beo mutant should be a useful animal model for this condition.",

Several experimental conditions and variables affecting the separation such as pH, HSA concentration and plug length, background electrolyte concentration, temperature and voltage were studied. Baseline separation of oxprenolol enantiomers was obtained in less than 8 min under the following selected conditions: electrophoretic buffer composed of 50 mM Tris-(hydroximethyl)-aminomethane (Tris) at pH 8.5; 190 microM HSA solution applied at 50 mbar for 225 s as chiral selector; oxprenolol samples contained 190 microM HSA solution injected hydrodynamically at 30 mbar for 2s and the electrophoretic runs performed at 30 degrees C applying 15 kV voltage. The proposed methodology was applied for the analysis of two pharmaceutical preparations. Resolution, accuracy, reproducibility, speed and cost of the proposed method make it suitable for quality control of the enantiomeric composition of oxprenolol in drugs.

The negatively charged DS can bind to phospholipids via calcium ions. To investigate the mechanism of the adsorption of DS on lipid monolayers, compression isotherms (pi-A) and capacitance-potential curves were measured, and a theoretical model was developed to interpret the capacitance data. The compression of lipid monolayers in the presence of DS led to a more condensed hybrid layer, removing the LE-LC phase transition of DPPC. Lower surface pressures improved the binding of DS on the lipid monolayers via calcium bridges due to the electrostatic attraction. Alternating current voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry were used to monitor the transfer of a cationic beta-blocker (metoprolol) across lipid monolayers in the absence and presence of the polyelectrolyte and to compare with the transfer of the standard probe, tetraethylammonium cation. Results showed a strong dependence on (i) the surface pressure, (ii) the applied potential, and, (iii) in the case of the hybrid layer, the charge of the phospholipid headgroup.

BALB/c mice were inoculated with the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or sham inoculated with saline and followed for 30 days. Epinephrine increased the severity of inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial necrosis induced by EMCV. Gene expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10 was markedly enhanced by epinephrine in EMCV-inoculated mice. Survival rate after 30 days was reduced to 40% in epinephrine-treated EMCV-inoculated mice compared with 70% in untreated EMCV-inoculated mice (P < 0.05). Treatment with the beta-blocker propranolol significantly decreased mortality, myocardial necrosis, and infiltration of inflammatory cells in EMCV-inoculated mice. Propranolol also suppressed gene expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10. A single dose of epinephrine 120 days after EMCV inoculation caused sudden death in 70% of infected mice; propranolol significantly reduced incidence of death to 33%.

Persistence was defined as consistently refilling a new prescription for AHT within 90 days of a previous dispensing. New courses of AHT were also documented in nonpersistent patients. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to compare persistence and new courses of therapy across initial drugs. Compared to the newer angiotensin II antagonists (AIIAs), the likelihood of discontinuing therapy over the 39-month study period was significantly higher for angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors (HR=1.29; 95% CI=1.16-1.43), calcium channel blockers (HR=1.42; 95% CI=1.27-1.60), beta blockers (HR=1.62; 95% CI=1.45-1.80) and diuretics (HR=1.92; 95% CI=1.73-2.14). In the year following treatment discontinuation, between 54 and 75% of patients initiated a second course of treatment. Patients initiated on an AIIA had a significantly higher likelihood of starting a new course of therapy after a first treatment discontinuation, compared to all other agents. In conclusion, hypertensive patients initiated on an AIIA not only had greater persistence to AHT but were also more likely to initiate a new course of AHT after discontinuation than those initiating treatment with other agents.

In conclusion, increases in drug distribution could be explained in part by hemodilution during CPB. On the other hand, the increase of biological half-life can be attributed to changes in hepatic metabolism induced by CPB under moderate hypothermia. These alterations in the pharmacokinetics of propranolol after CABG with hypothermic CPB might induce a greater myocardial depression in response to propranolol than would be expected with an equivalent dose during the postoperative period.",

Here we show an activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) and the downstream nuclear targets Elk-1 and calcium/cAMP response element binding protein, in the hippocampus of cystathionine beta synthase deficient mice, a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia. An ex vivo model of hippocampal slices allowed us to reproduce Hcy -induced ERK activation and to unravel the mechanisms responsible of this activation. Of interest, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA and metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists all blocked Hcy -induced ERK activation. Moreover, the ERK activation was blocked in the presence of Na+-channel blocker tetrodotoxin, indicating the existence of a trans-synaptic activity in ERK activation by Hcy in hippocampal slices. The effects of Hcy on ERK cascade activation were also dependent on calcium influx, CaMK-II, PKC as well as PKA activation. Thus, altogether these data support a role of Hcy on ERK activation, via complex mechanisms, starting with a control of glutamate release, which in turn activates ionotropic and metabotropic receptor subtypes and produces increases in intracellular calcium levels."
