    "0": "1. Longitudinal tension was measured in isolated segments (approximately 20 mm in length and 2 mm in diameter) of bovine mesenteric lymphatic vessels.2. Seventeen out of thirty-nine vessels showed regular spontaneous rhythmic contractions, the most common frequency being about 2/min.3. The strength of each contraction was related to the duration of the preceding pause, a longer pause being associated with a stronger contraction.4. Noradrenaline increased the frequency and decreased the amplitude of the contractions. This effect was abolished by alpha-receptor blockade with phentolamine.5. Isoprenaline slowed the frequency of the contractions. This effect was abolished by beta-receptor blockade with propranolol.6. Acetylcholine had little effect on the rate of spontaneous contractions.", 
    "1": "1. Tendon jerk responses and H reflexes were recorded from conscious human volunteers before and after intravenous injection of methylamphetamine, thymoxamine and propranolol, and during intravenous infusion of noradrenaline.2. Methylamphetamine produced a significant increase in the amplitude of the tendon jerk, whereas noradrenaline had no effect in doses which caused a greater pressor response than methylamphetamine.3. Thymoxamine produced a dose-related reduction in the tendon jerk.4. Propranolol had no significant effect on the jerk.5. None of these drugs significantly affected the H reflex.6. It is suggested that central adrenoceptors, possibly alpha in type, exist in man, and that stimulation of these receptors facilitates tendon jerk reflexes by an action on the fusimotor system.", 
    "2": "1. Changes in cutaneous water loss were followed by continuously monitoring total body weight loss.2. Sweating was induced in normal subjects by raising the environmental temperature or by subjecting them to the emotional stress of mental arithmetic.3. Propranolol in a dosage of 0.15 mg/kg body weight intravenously had no significant effect on either thermal or emotional sweating, whereas thermal sweating was completely blocked temporarily by administration of atropine 2.4 mg intravenously.4. It is concluded that beta-adrenoceptor blockade has no effect on physiological sweating in normal people.", 
    "3": "In the treatment of angina pectoris a double-blind evaluation of verapamil (Cordilox) at two dose levels-namely, 80 mg thrice daily and 120 mg thrice daily-propranolol (Inderal) 100 mg thrice daily, and isosorbide dinitrate (Vascardin) 20 mg thrice daily has been made against a placebo. The assessment was based on relief from daily attacks of angina on effort and the response to a whole-body exercise test. We can find no statistically significant difference between the effects of verapamil (120 mg three times a day) and propranolol (100 mg three times a day) in the treatment of angina of effort. Both of these preparations are more effective than a placebo both in the reduction of daily attacks (P < 0.01) and in the prolongation of exercise test (P < 0.05). Isosorbide dinitrate (20 mg three times a day) appears to be no more effective than a placebo in the treatment of angina on effort, but 14 out of 32 patients experienced headache of such severity that even when the dose was reduced to 10 mg thrice daily this drug therapy had to be withdrawn. Both propranolol (100 mg three times a day) and verapamil (120 mg three times a day) had a significant lowering effect on the diastolic blood pressure as measured with the patient standing (P < 0.01)."
