On the basis of response to intensive medical therapy, patients were classified into a medically controlled, semielective surgery group (54 patients) and a medically uncontrolled, emergent/urgent surgical group (73 patients). There were five operative deaths. 1/54 in the medically controlled group (1.8%) and 4/73 (5%) in the medically uncontrolled group; 4/5 operative deaths occured with left main coronary stenosis. There were five late deaths during a follow-up period of 12 to 84 months, 37.5 with an actuarial survival of 83.5%. If patients with unstable angina can be medically controlled, operation can be delayed and the operative long-term survival is similar to that of elective coronary bypass. Patients who cannot be controlled medically, particularly those with left main coronary lesions, should be operated on urgently with selective use of preoperative balloon support.", 
    "1": "Quinidine pharmacokinetics (half-life, volume of distribution, and clearance) as well as protein binding were evaluated following a single 200 mg. oral dose of quinidine sulfate in eight control patients, in eight patients with moderate to severe cirrhosis, and in seven patients receiving 40 to 400 mg./day of propranolol. Patients with cirrhosis had a significantly longer quinidine half-life (9 +/- 1 hr; p less than .01) when compared to control patients (6 +/- 0.5h). This was not related to a reduced quinidine clearance rate but rather to an increase in quinidine volume of distribution (4.1 +/- .4 L./Kg. in cirrhotic patients vs 2.6 +/- 1 L./Kg. in control patients; p less than .01). Abnormal quinidine binding (greater than 25 per cent unbound fraction) was noted in seven of the eight cirrhotic patients. In contrast, patients receiving propranolol had a normal quinidine half-life of 6 +/- 0.5 hr. However, these patients had a significantly reduced quinidine clearance (3.3 +/- .7 ml./min./Kg. vs. 5.3 +/- .5 ml./min./Kg. in controls; p less than .05) and higher peak concentrations (1.25 +/- .20 micrograms/ml. vs. .80 +/- .5 micrograms/ml. in controls; p less than .05). Therefore in patients receiving propranolol, quinidine levels may be higher than expected shortly after dosage, and therefore a potential for transient toxicity exists in these patients. Maintenance quinidine dosage may have to be reduced in patients with moderate to severe hepatic cirrhosis, but not in patients receiving propranolol. Total quinidine concentration measurement underestimate free quinidine concentrations in most cirrhotic patients.", 
    "2": "Beta-Adrenoceptors of ventricular membranes of kitten heart were labelled reversibly with (--)-3H-propranolol (binding constant 6nM). Bound (--)-3H-propranolol was displaced with beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents and catecholamines. Displacement constants KD(M) of the blockers were of the same of magnitude as their constants KB obtained from the antagonism of inotropic effects of catecholamines in papillary muscles. KD's of catecholamines were, however, 2 orders of magnitude larger than concentrations causing half maximal inotropic effects, indicating large spare beta-adrenoceptor capacity.", 
    "3": "The action of pheprazet, a derivative of amphethamine, and of the pheprazet alkylated analogues on the excitability of the neuron populations in the dorsal and ventral parts of the hippocampus was studied in non-anesthetized rabbits with electrodes and chemotrodes indwelt in the hippocampus and other brain structures. Most active drugs are shown to be pheprazet and (formula: see text). The former affects the beta- and the latter the alpha-adrenoreceptors of the hippocampus. Pheprazet pre-eminently increases while the drug (see formula: see text) reduces the excitability of the neuron populations in the dorsal and ventral parts of the hippocampus. The opposite effects of these drugs are considered by authors from the standpoint of interaction between different mediator systems.", 
    "4": "The effects of glucagon alone or in combination with theophylline on renin section were studied in relation to renal hemodynamic responses in anesthetized dogs. The intrarenal infusion of glucagon (0.5 microgram/kg/min) increased heart rate, renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and urine flow without any effect on renin secretion, but at a higher dose (1.0 microgram/kg/min) it increased renin secretion significantly. Theophylline (0.1 mg/kg/min) did not affect renal hemodynamics but caused a slight increase in renin secretion after 30--60 min infusion. The combined infusion of glucagon (0.5 microgram/kg/min) with theophylline (0.1 mg/kg/min) increased renin secretion markedly, although it produced renal hemodynamic changes similar to those induced by glucagon alone. These effects were not suppressed by d,l-propranolol (1.0 microgram/kg/min). It is suggested that the increase in renin secretion caused by the combined infusion of glucagon and theophylline resulted mainly from an increase in cyclic AMP in the juxtaglomerular cells, and not from stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "5": "Sigmoid renal baroreflex curves relating mean arterial pressure to integrated renal sympathetic nerve activity were obtained in anaesthetized rabbits with previously implanted balloons to raise and lower blood pressure. Propranolol was infused to reach plasma levels averaging 324 ng/ml. This reduced blood pressure by 9.6 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, but had no effect on resting sympathetic discharge. Propranolol lowered the threshold of the renal baroreflex. Median blood pressure was reduced by 15.4 +/- 1.9 mmHg but there was no change in gain or sympathetic activity range. Thus, at a given blood pressure there was diminution of sympathetic discharge compared with control. Similar changes occurred after giving clonidine. However, \"non-specific\" produced by bleeding or nitroprusside infusion produced no resetting of the baroreflex curves, though the resting sympathetic discharge increased. The effects of propranolol (plasma levels 137 and 348 ng/ml) on arterial baroreceptor discharge were studied by deriving mean arterial pressure-integrated aortic nerve activity curves. Propranolol produced a reduction of aortic nerve discharge of about 7% of control. Single unit analysis showed a small reduction in firing frequency/sec near threshold, which was sufficient to explain the changes in integrated aortic nerve discharge. Since the changes in input from the aortic baroreceptors do not account for the reduction in threshold of the renal baroreflex, we conclude that the latter is due to the central nervous action of propranolol.", 
    "6": "Treatment with desmethylimipramine (DMI), a tricyclic antidepressant, for 7 to 21 days resulted in a 35 to 45% decrease in the accumulation of adenosine cyclic 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) in response to a maximally effective concentration of (-)-isoproterenol (ISO) in rat cerebral cortical slices. The EC50 for ISO-stimulated cAMP accumulation was not affected by DMI administration. The diminution in responsiveness to catecholamines was accompanied by a 35 to 40% decrease in the density of beta adrenergic receptors as measured by the binding of [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol. Decreases in ISO-sensitive cAMP accumulation and in beta adrenergic receptor density were temporally correlated, maximal decreases being observed within 5 to 7 days. Within 7 days after cessation of chronic DMI treatment ISO-stimulated cAMP accumulation and beta adrenergic receptor density returned to normal. The role of presynaptic nerve terminals in mediating these phenomena was also investigated. Treatment of newborn rats with 6--hydroxydopamine inhibited the development of noradrenergic nerve terminals in the cerebral cortex and blocked the effects of DMI on cortical cAMP accumulation and on beta adrenergic receptor density. The administration of the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol led to increases in maximal ISO-stimulated cAMP accumulations and beta adrenergic receptor density in the rat cerebral cortex. This increase was not affected by the simultaneous administration of propranolol and DMI. Thus, the effect of DMI appears to be mediated through an action of norepinephrine at beta adrenergic receptors. Chronic treatment with two other clinically effective antidepressants, pargyline and iprindole, led to effects similar to those observed with DMI administration. Pretreatment of neonates with 6-hydroxydopamine blocked the effect of iprindole on beta adrenergic receptors. Preincubation of cortical membranes with guanosinetriphosphate before determination of the density of beta adrenergic receptors had no effect on the decreased number of receptors had no effect on the decreased number of receptors seen in DMI-treated animals. These experiments suggest that antidepressants, acting presynaptically, increase the concentration of transmitter at noradrenergic synapses and induce a compensatory decrease in the density of beta adrenergic receptors.", 
    "7": "[3H]Dihydroergocryptine ([3H]DHE) binds to sites in membranes derived from rat myocardium that have the characteristics expected of alpha-adrenergic receptors. The binding is saturable with 41 fmol [3H]DHE bound per mg of protein and of high affinity with KD = 2.9 nM. The binding is rapid and readily reversible. Adrenergic agonists compete with [3H]DHE for binding in the order: epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than isoproterenol; and adrenergic antagonists compete for binding in the order: phentolamine greater than propranolol. For comparison, (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol [(-)[3h]dha] was used to bind to sites in the same membrane preparations having characteristics of beta-receptors. The number and affinity of beta-receptors were quite similar to those of the alpha-receptors with 46 fmol (-)[EH]DHA per mg protein bound at saturation and KD = 2.5 nM. These techniques allowed identification of both beta- and alpha-adrenergic receptors in membranes derived from isolated atria, right ventricular free walls, and left ventricles including interventricular septa. This is the first report documenting direct identification of myocardial alpha-receptors by radioligand-binding techniques and complements the literature previously reporting myocardial inotopic and electrophysiological responses to alpha-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "8": "By measurement of the specific binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol, the densities of beta-adrenergic receptors on membranes prepared from homogenized corneas and iris--ciliary bodies of rabbits were studied. Sympathetic denervation, as a result of subconjunctival treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine, causes an increase in the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in membranes prepared from the ipsilateral iris--ciliary body but not the cornea. Topical treatment with epinephrine for 5 days causes a decrease in the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in membranes prepared from cornea and iris-ciliary body, whereas similar treatment with timolol causes an increase in the density of beta-adrenergic receptors. In the cornea, the decrease in receptor density that occurs following in vivo treatment with epinephrine is associated with a decreased ability to synthesize cyclic AMP, whereas the increase in receptor density that occurs following in vivo treatment with timolol is not associated with an altered ability to synthesize cyclic AMP. Our results indicate that the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in the anterior segment of the eye is inversely related to the level of adrenergic stimulation to the tissue but that the ability of a tissue to synthesize cyclic AMP does not necessarily parallel the change in receptor density.", 
    "9": "Administration to female rats of 250 micrograms of testosterone propionate (TSP) on the 3rd day of postnatal life led to reduction of estradiol, progesterone, and, to a lesser degree, of lutropin in the blood plasma of these animals at the age of 3 months. There was an increase of the lutropin content in the adenohypophysis and of luliberin in the hypothalamus. Combined with TSP administration of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, p-chlorphenylalanine or droperidol promoted preservation of cyclic changes in the hypothalamic gonadotropin activity and partially prevented disturbances of estradiol and progesteron secretion caused by neonatal androgenization. The mechanisms of participation of biogenic monoamines in sex differentiation of the hypothalamus are discussed.", 
    "10": "A review of 20 consecutive patients with left main coronary artery stenosis operated on in 1976 indicated a general hemodynamic pattern characterized by systolic hypertension and an increase in heart rate that occurred early during the induction phase of anesthesia. From January through August, 1977, 28 patients with this stenotic condition were operated on with hemodynamic monitoring of left ventricular pressure and cardiac output by a Swan-Ganz catheter inserted before induction of anesthesia. Pharmacological interventions to optimize preload with volume, reduce afterload with nitroprusside or nitroglycerine, control heart rate with propranolol, and improve contractility with dopamine resulted in a decrease in mortality from 20% in Group 1 (1976) to 3.5% in Group 2 (1977). We conclude that control of systemic blood pressure, heart rate, and preload has notably reduced the mortality in this group of patients and that hemodynamic monitoring provides precise guidelines for therapeutic interventions.", 
    "11": "Coronary haemodynamic and metabolic effects of propranolol and glyceryl trinitrate were studied in 12 patients with coronary artery disease and 5 without coronary heart disease, at rest and during tachycardia stress. Propranolol-associated reductions in indices of myocardial oxygen demand, left ventricle work, tension time, and left ventricle oxygen utilisation (LVVO2) were reversed when heart rate was controlled by atrial pacing. Adding glyceryl trinitrate at rest also restored heart rate but decreased the left ventricular work index and tension time index as coronary resistance declined paradoxically. Tachycardia-related increases in tension time index and LVVO2 were unchanged after propranolol, and ischaemia (angina, ST depression, and reduced lactate extraction) was not altered in most of the patients. During tachycardia, the addition of glyceryl trinitrate decreased the tension time index and LVVO2; angina recurred in only 4 patients, and ST depression and lactate extraction improved. Similar haemodynamic changes occurred in the patients with normal coronary arteries. In contrast with propranolol administered alone, propranolol plus glyceryl trinitrate enhances tachycardia tolerance and prevents tachycardia-induced manifestations of ischaemia. This action is attributed to glyceryl trinitrate-associated improvement in the adequacy of myocardial perfusion.", 
    "12": "Transmural creatine kinase activity was determined 5 hours after acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in 27 open chest anesthetized dogs. In seven dogs, propranolol, 2 mg/kg, was given intravenously over a 10 minute period 10 minutes after occlusion. In 10 dogs, nitroglycerin, 300 microgram/min, was infused intravenously for 1 hour 10 minutes after occlusion. Methoxamine, 300 to 500 microgram, was administered to return blood pressure and heart rate to prenitroglycerin levels. In untreated dogs, there was a distinct transmural gradient of creatine kinase activity in the ischemic region from subepicardium to subendocardium: nonischemic subepicardium 1,187 +/- 50 international units (IU)/g versus ischemic subepicardium 1,054 +/- 46 IU/g and nonischemic subendocardium 1,170 +/- 53 IU/g versus ischemic subendocard;um 766 +/- 42 IU/g, respectively. Administration of propranolol did not affect the transmural creatine kinase gradient after 5 hours of occlusion. In contrast, nitroglycerin plus methoxamine significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased subendocardial creatine kinase depletion after 5 hours of occlusion (776 +/- 42 versus 978 +/- 47 IU/g). These findings demonstrate the unique capability of nitroglycerin plus methoxamine to protect the subendocardium during ischemic insult.", 
    "13": "The effects of coronary vasodilating agents and alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents on cyclical reductions of blood flow in the partially constricted coronary artery of anesthetized dogs were examined. Intravenous injections of nitroglycerin (50 microgram/Kg), SG 75 (150 microgram/Kg), papaverine (1 mg/Kg), and nicotinic acid (10 mg/Kg) eliminated both cyclical reductions of flow and ST elevation (group 1). Nifedipine (10 microgram/Kg), verapamil (500 microgram/Kg), diltiazem (500 microgram/Kg), and propranolol (500 microgram/Kg) suppressed ST elevation, but they could not eliminate cyclical reductions of flow (group 2). Dipyridamole (1 mg/Kg) and phenotolamine (500 microgram/Kg) augmented both ST elevation and cyclical reductions of flow (group 3). The results indicate that ST elevation due to cyclical reductions of coronary blood flow was eliminated by spasmolytic actions of group 1 on coronary artery, was suppressed by negative chronotropic and/or inotropic actions of group 2, and was augmented by peripheral actions of group 3.", 
    "14": "Using isolated, Langendorff-perfused, electrically-paced guinea-pig hearts, we have investigated the rise in resting tension that occurs when mammalian heart muscle becomes hypoxic. Substrate-depletion, tachycardia, hyperthyroidism, and inotropic interventions (ouabain, isoprenaline, and beta-receptor antagonists at concentrations which increase inotropic state) enhanced the rate of development of this increase in resting tension. 3.86 mumol.litre-1 propranolol, 0.22 to 2.20 mumol.litre-1 verapamil or removing Ca2+ from the extracellular phase at the start of the hypoxic episode prevented (or delayed) the rise in resting tension. Adding these same agents or removing Ca2+ from the extracellular phase after the hypoxia-induced rise in resting tension had started to develop failed to prevent its progression. These results provide some support for an hypothesis that the hypoxia-induced increase in resting tension is independent of an enhanced Ca2+ influx.", 
    "15": "The activity of renin in the blood plasma of 10-, 18--22-day and 2--3-month puppies is higher than in adult dogs. Blocking beta adrenoreceptors in 18--22-day, 2--3 month and adult animals decreases the activity of renin. Hypotensive effect following beta adrenergic block in 10-day puppies and alfa adrenergic block in puppies of all age groups is accompanied by the increase in renin activity. In early ontogenesis, the leading role in regulation of renin secretion belongs to changes in renal hemodynamics.", 
    "16": "The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of adrenergic alpha- and beta-1-receptor stimulation on the peripheral platelet count. The experiments were carried out on 8 healthy male volunteers using radioisotopically labelled platelets. 3 subjects received i.v. infusions of adrenaline (0.09 microgram X kg-1 X min-1) before and after the ingestion of 40 mg propranolol. In response to the first infusion there was an instant increase in the venous platelet-bound radioactivity (PBR) which amounted to 12% over basal value. This effect of adrenaline seemed to be potentiated by propranolol pretreatment. 5 subjects received i.v. infusions of the highly selective beta-1-receptor agonist H 133/22 (prenalterol, H\u00e4ssle, Sweden). In response to a cumulative dose of 4.75 mg prenalterol a slight but significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in PBR occurred. It is concluded that alpha-receptor stimulation causes a depletion of platelets from the exchangeable splenic platelet pool resulting in a concomitant increase in the peripheral platelet count. Beta-receptor stimulation has an opposite effect on the spleen. The trapping of platelets by the spleen is mediated both via beta-1- and beta-2-receptors, but the effect of beta-2-receptor stimulation seems to predominate.", 
    "17": "Twenty outpatients with mild angina were prescribed placebo tablets b.i.d. for 7 weeks followed by acebutolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker, 200 mg b.i.d. for 21 weeks under single-blind conditions. One graded multistage treadmill test was carried out after each treatment period and an angina diary was filled daily for the 6 months of the trial. Attack frequency declined by 71% from 2.59 per week on placebo to 0.76 per week on acebutolol (p less than 0.05). Exercise duration on the treadmill increased by 56%, from 5.95 minutes on placebo to 9.32 minutes on acebutolol (p less than 0.001). A satisfactory clinical response (50% or greater decline in attack frequency per week) occurred in 15 out of 19 patients (79%; a 100% or greater increase in exercise duration on the treadmill was observed in 10 out of 19 cases (53%). Exercise responsiveness was well predicted by exercise duration on placebo (r = 0.91, p less than 0.0005), patients with the least initial tolerance being the most improved. Clinical responsiveness was not well predicted by initial exercise tolerance (r = 0.38, N;S.) or by the improvement in exercise tolerance (r = 0.33, N.S.). It is concluded that acebutolol substantially reduces anginal attack frequency even in patients in whom exercise tolerance is not significantly improved, at the dose of 400 mg/day.", 
    "18": "Bordetella pertussis organisms induce histamine sensitivity and diminish the normal hyperglycemic response to epinephrine in experimental animals. These effects have been attributed to beta-adrenergic blockade. However, under conditions in which the decrease in epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia after B. pertussis administration was demonstrable, there was no change in rat reticulocyte beta-adrenergic receptor number or affinity measured by iodohydroxybenzylpindolol binding or in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Therefore, there was no generalized beta-adrenergic blockade induced by B. pertussis. The observed effects can be explained by the hypersecretion of insulin resulting from B. pertussis administration.", 
    "19": "The antihypertensive effect of the following therapeutic regimens: diuretic alone (DA), diuretic plus sympathetic inhibitor (DSI), diuretic plus betablocker (DB) and diuretic plus, betablocker plus vasodilator (DBV) was studied for 34.1 +/- 5.4 months in 28 patients with resistant essential hypertension (REH). Depending of treatment tolerability and the optimal antihypertensive action of drugs 21, 24, 26 and 10 cases were treated continuously or alternately with DA (9.9), DSI (15.0), DB (4.8), and DBV (14.6), respectively (in paragraph average duration of treatment in months). On admission the 89.3% and 42.8% of population had electrocardiographic signs of left ventricular hypertrophy or past-history of cardio-vascular complications, respectively. Arithmethic average and standard deviation of individual changes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure obtained during DA, DSI, DB and DBV treatment were -32.4 +/- 31.8, -19.3 +/- 27.2, -18.9 +/- 15.9 and -18.2 +/- 21.3 for systolic and -35.8 +/- 20.2, -12.3 +/- 17.2, -15.1 +/- 16.9 and -15 +/- 13.1 (mm. de Hg.) for diastolic blood pressure respectively. Average blood pressure before treatment was 222.4 +/- 30.3/128.0 +/- 20.8 (mm of Hg) and under the most effective treatment was 175.5 +/- 21.8/106.5 +/- 12.1 with a p less than or equal to 0.001 for either sistolic and diastolic pressure. There were not significant regressive electrocardiographic changes during the therapeutic period, neither significant changes in urea and creatinine blood values. 46.4% and 25% of cases exhibited collateral drug symptoms and cardio-vascular no fatal complications, respectively. Three of the last group patients died outside of the Hospital (2 sudden deaths and 1 renal insufficiency death). RH still constitutes a challenge to medical therapy. Nevertheless individualized therapy may modify the natural history of this hypertensive variety.", 
    "20": "The condition of the sympatheticoadrenal system and blood renin activity were studied in healthy children and in children suffering from primary arterial hypertension and treated with beta-blocking agents (Obzidan, Visken). A hypotensive effect was noted in the group of patients suffering from primary arterial hypertension with a high blood renin level and increased excretion of catecholamines in the urine.", 
    "21": "A relationship between the state of adrenergic, cholinergic, and serotoninergic systems, on the one hand, and the acid-alkaline balance of the organism, on the other hand, was revealed in sharp and chronic experiments on dogs. A surplus of each of the mediators was accompanied by respiratory alkalosis, and its deficiency--by combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis.", 
    "22": "Every stress reaction leads to an increased, hormonelly induced mobilisation of fatty acids, the extent of which may be considered as a parameter of the aggression mechanism. In 15 patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia, who were operated under neurolepthypalgesia, the problem of quantitative alterations of the concentration pattern of fatty acids was investigated during the operation. In contrast to some reports of the literature, the increase of the concentration of total fatty acids was due to corresponding increases of all individual fatty acids. By preoperative administration of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent Pindolol the increase of fatty acids was reduced without a qualitative shifting of individual fatty acids.", 
    "23": "Binding of the potent beta-adrenergic antagonist [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol ([125I]IHYP) to particulate preparations from newborn mouse skin was characterized. A number of criteria were used to establish that binding occurred to specific, high affinity beta-adrenergic receptors in the skin preparations. Thus specific binding (that displaced by 10 micrometer concentrations of the beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)propranolol) reached equilibrium in 15--20 min, was saturable (ligand concentration for half-maximal saturation, 0.25 nM) and freely reversible. Stereoselectivity of binding was demonstrated by the observation that displacement of [125I]IHYP by (-)propranolol occurred at concentrations at least 100 times lower than with (+)isoproterenol. Displacement was also observed with the beta-adrenergic agonists (-)isoproterenol, (-)epinephrine and (-)norepinephrine, but not with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine.", 
    "24": "It is possible to predict plasma concentrations of drugs by measurement in saliva, obviating the need for venipuncture. Using a selection of weakly acidic and basic drugs, we have found this prediction reliable for drugs largely nonionized at normal plasma pH (phenytoin, phenobarbital, antipyrine) but unreliable for ionized drugs (chlorpropramide, tolbutamide, propranolol, meperidine). Deliberate alteration of saliva flow rate and pH using different stimuli have produced twofold changes in saliva drug concentrations. Wide interindividual variability of saliva pH is the likely explanation for the inconstancy of saliva to plasma concentration ratios for ionized drugs.", 
    "25": "The effects of the combined alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent labetalol on human blood platelets as estimated by platelet aggregation, platelet count, bleeding time and platelet factor 3 activity were studied in 5 patients. The drug reduced adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation in vitro. However, it did not influence the above platelet function test in therapeutic plasma concentrations in vivo.", 
    "26": "Rats were trained to discriminate between the effects of 4 mg/kg of cocaine HCl and saline (1 ml/kg) in a T-shaped maze. When the animals reliably differentiated the imposed training conditions (cocaine vs. no drug), test sessions were interspersed in between the regular training sessions. Test trials resulted in a median effective dose (ED50) of 1.6 mg/kg of cocaine, and the duration of the discriminable effects of cocaine in producing 50% cocaine-appropriate responding was 57.9 min postinjection. Pretreatment with neuroleptics (pimozide, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine), but not with propranolol, phenoxybenzamine, alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, or physostigmine, attenuated the cocaine discrimination. Data are discussed with reference to previous results from amphetamine discriminations.", 
    "27": "Propranolol 0.1 mg/kg intravenously followed by 320 mg orally over 27 h was given to 20 randomly selected patients within 4 h of the onset of suspected myocardial infarction unaccompanied by diagnostic electrocardiographic changes. Patients given propranolol had fewer completed infarcts as assessed by serial electrocardiograms, a lower frequency of serum-creatine-kinase levels above the normal range, and lower peak serum-creatine-kinase levels than 23 control subjects. This evidence suggests that threatened myocardial infarction can in some cases be prevented by early beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "28": "The effects of intravenously administered labetalol on blood pressure and pulse rate were examined in 17 patients with severe hypertension. Prompt and sustained falls in supine blood pressure and pulse rate occurred in ten patients (responders), but seven patients showed little or no change in either measurement (non-responders). Labetalol had a more marked effect on standing than on supine blood pressure. Only two of the responders, but all of the non-responders were concurrently receiving antihypertensive drugs. Plasma renin activity, plasma renin concentration and plasma angiotensin II concentration fell slightly over the one-hour period of observation in ten patients in whom serial measurements were made, but the changes were independent of the blood pressure response.", 
    "29": "The prescriber needs adequate and concise information about each product that he uses, to allow him to obtain optimal effects while minimising harm. Neither the present UK data sheets nor their equivalents in other countries have succeeded in providing such information clearly or completely. This paper develops the proposals on the arrangement of drug information made in the WHO report \"The selection of essential drugs.\" Three sets of minimum information (on tetracycline, propranolol, and aspirin) which illustrate this approach were compared with the manufacturers' data sheets: the latter were incomplete. The information content of our proposals was worked out with a group of clinical pharmacologists, general practitioners, and specialists, and we suggest that this approach should be extended to other drugs.", 
    "30": "Cardiac functions like heart size, heart rate, and blood pressure were studied at rest in 23 digitalized and 24 not digitalized patinents recovering from a myocardial infarction, in 16 patients with arterial hypertension and in 9 patients with regulatory dysfunctions of the circulation before and after a three week period of treatment with 2 x 50 mg or 2 x 100 mg atenolol per day. The heart rate and the blood pressure of every patient were significantly reduced, whereas the heart size which was determined by X-ray in lying patient showed no clear difference. Furthermore, the determination of the heart size facilitates the decision of the additional digitalization when the start of a long-term treatment with beta-blocking agents seems to be necessary in the aforementioned patient groups.", 
    "31": "In 61 out-patients with essential hypertension, grade I or II, propranolol was administered alone in increasing doses (3 x 40 mg/d or 3 x 80 mg/d) or, if there was insufficient response, with a double or triple combination consisting additionally of spironolactone (50 mg/d)-thiabutazide (5 mg/d) and dihydralazine (3 x 25 mg/d). This treatment schedule achieved normal pressures in 51 patients, in 22 on 40 mg, in 7 on 80 mg propranolol, in 16 after the addition of the diuretic, and in 6 with the triple combination. Four patients had to be excluded from the study because they developed either marked bradycardia or anxiety states or paraesthesias after propranolol (3 x 40 mg/d). On chronic beta-adrenergic blockade the serum potassium level increased slightly, but remained within normal limits. The initial value of plasma-renin activity was highest in the group of those who responded to the propranolol treatment.", 
    "32": "In a field study comprising 678 patients with arterial hypertension efficacy and tolerance of the stable combination VKB 105 consisting of 10 mg Pindolol (Visken) and 5 mg Clopamid (Brinaldix) were investigated. Treatment with 1--2 tablets of VKB per day resulted in a successful therapy in 94% of all patients corresponding on the average to a reduction in blood pressure to 145/85 mm Hg within 14 days. In mean arterial pressures ranging between 120 and 170 mm Hg a positive linear relationship between the individual initial value and the hypotensive effect of the combination could be observed. A controlled omission trial disclosed qualitatively the respective contribution to the effect of the two components Pindolol and Clopamid. With a systematic case control of the serum potassium under the combined therapy with VKB 105 and during a monotherapy with Clopamid and antihypokalaemic effect of Pindolol could be demonstrated diminishing the tendency for potassium loss. The result revealed a far-reaching potassium neutrality of diuresis-depending stimulation of renin by the beta-receptor blocker. In 61 patients altogether subjective side-effects could be recorded, such as vertigo (5%), palpitations (2.8%), fatigue (2%), insomina (1.9%), nausea (1.7%) and vomiting (0.8%). Laboratory controls gave no indication for clinically relevant changes.", 
    "33": "Progesterone reinitiates meiotic maturation in Xenopus oocytes. Evidence is reported which indicates that the steroid acts at the level of the cell surface and suggests that an induced change of Ca2+ distribution triggers in turn a cascade of cytoplasmic events including protein synthesis and germinal vesicle (nucleus) breakdown. These novel features of steroid hormone action in amphibian oocytes are discussed in relation to presently accepted views of the mechanism of action of steroid hormones in somatic cells.", 
    "34": "Considered from the point of view of clinical practice, the treatment of chronic headache may be either symptomatic and etiological or physiopathological. Progress in symptomatic treatment depends first on the reasonable and graduated use of pure analgesics, looking out for the toxic side effects of the usual drugs and then the fairly definite efficacy of certain psychotropic drugs. The discovery of an etiology gives a specific dimension to the treatment: either anti-cerebral oedema drugs with above all tetracosactide, a diagnostic test of cerebral tumours, or antidepressor or tranquillizer drugs, depending on the variety of disturbance to be corrected. An attack of migraine always benefits from ergotamine used occasionally and in limited dosage (not more than 6 mg daily or 10 mg per week). For the basic treatment the drugs act mainly peripherally and fairly regularly in the following order: methysergide, beta-blockaders, pizotifene, cyproheptadine, oxetorone. Other drugs have a central effect, Tiapridal, MAO inhibitors which are too often neglected, and clonazepam which is not very easy to use.", 
    "35": "Effects of phentolamine (13.3, 26.5 and 53.0 micron), alprenolol (3.5, 7.0 and 17.5 micron) and prenylamine (2.4, 4.8 and 11.9 micron) on the transmembrane potential were studied in isolated guinea-pig papillary muscles, superfused with Tyrode's solution. 1. Phentolamine, alprenolol and prenylamine reduced the maximum rate of rise of action potential (.Vmax) dose-dependently. Higher concentrations of phentolamine and prenylamine caused a loss of plateau in a majority of the preparations. Resting potential was not altered by any of the drugs. Readmittance of drug-free Tyrode's solution reversed these changes induced by 13.3 micron of phentolamine and all conconcentrations of alprenolol almost completely but those induced by higher concentrations of phentolamine and all concentrations of prenylamine only slightly. 2. .Vmax at steady state was increased with decreasing driving frequencies (0.5 and 0.25 Hz) and was decreased with increasing ones (2--5 Hz) in comparison with that at 1 Hz. Such changes were all exaggerated by the above drugs, particularly by prenylamine. 3. Prenylamine and, to a lesser degree, phentolamine and alprenolol delayed dose-dependently the recovery process of .Vmax in premature responses. 4. .Vmax in the first response after interruption of stimulation recovered toward the predrug value in the presence of the above three drugs. The time constants of recovery process ranged between 10.5 and 15.0s for phentolamine, between 4.5 and 15.5s for alprenolol. The time constant of the main component was estimated to be approximately 2s for the recovery process with prenylamine. 5. On the basis of the model recently proposed by Hondeghem and Katzung (1977), it is suggested that the drug molecules associate with the open sodium channels and dissociated slowly from the closed channels and that the inactivation parameter in the drug-associated channels is shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction.", 
    "36": "It is reported on a case of Romano-Ward-syndrome in a 40-year-old female patient. The problems of the most frequent false interpretation as idiopathic epilepsy as well as the differential-diagnostic considerations concerning the exclusion of symptomatic QT(U)-elongations in the ECG are entered. The pathomechanisms which perhaps are the basis of the syndrome are discussed.", 
    "37": "The effect of chronic liver disease on the rate of elimination and extent of \"first-pass\" metabolism of labetalol was studied. Pharmacokinetic measurements were made after both oral and intravenous administration to seven healthy subjects and to 10 patients with chronic liver disease. Plasma half life was similar in the two groups. Plasma concentrations were considerably higher in the patients than in the healthy subjects after oral administration but similar after intravenous injection. Thus the bioavailability of labetalol was increased in liver disease due to reduced first-pass metabolism. Bioavailability in the group of patients correlated negatively with serum albumin concentration. There were falls in supine heart rate and blood pressure which tended to be greater after oral administration in the patients with liver disease, suggesting an exaggerated response related to the increased bioavailability. Oral dosage requirements of labetalol and possibly other drugs susceptible to first-pass metabolism are reduced in the presence of liver disease.", 
    "38": "The interaction of a new antihypertensive agent, labetalol was demonstrated in subcellular preparations enriched in alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. This result give direct confirmation of pharmacological data observed in isolated organs and in vivo. It illustrates the value of biochemical studies of receptors in order to define the mechanism of action of drugs.", 
    "39": "Potassium metabolism was studied in a multicentre trial of 174 out-patients with arterial hypertension of mild or moderate degree who were receiving both beta-adenergic blockers and a diuretic (1 tablet Viskaldix, containing 10 mg pindolol and 5 mg clopamide). The antihypertensive effect, heart rate and drug tolerance were also analysed. During the 15-week treatment there were no significant changes in potassium metabolism. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, both on standing and lying, were significantly decreased, while heart rate remained within normal limits. In no instance was it necessary to discontinue the drug because it was not well tolerated.", 
    "40": "The uptake of 28Mg and 45Ca was measured in S49 lymphoma cells. The beta-adrenergic agonist (-)-isoproterenol markedly inhibited the rate of 28Mg accumulation but had no effect on 45Ca accumulation. The effect of (-)-isoproterenol was blocked by (-)-propranolol. In variants of the S49 cell line deficient in adenylate cyclase activity (cyc-) or in hormone receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling (unc), (-)-isoproterenol had no effect on 28Mg accumulation. The S49 lymphoma cells also possess prostaglandin E1 receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase, and, like (-)-isoproterenol, prostaglandin E1 decreased the rate of 28Mg uptake. Experiments with the mouse erythroleukemia cell line GM86 also showed a beta-adrenergic-mediated decrease in the rate of accumulation of 28Mg. Previous work has shown that Mg2+ increases the affinity of agonists for the beta-adrenergic receptor (Bird, S.J., and Maguire, M.E. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, in press). In view of these effects of Mg2+, it is suggested that Mg2+, but not Ca2+, may regulate the sensitivity of S49 cell adenylate cyclase to stimulation by catecholamines.", 
    "41": "Antihypertensive action of timolol (MK 950) was studied in 86 outpatients with essential, uncomplicated hypertension. Timolol is an effective hypotensive drug with significant lowering pressor effect. Timolol was given alone in 53 cases and in association with other hypotensive drugs in 33 cases: the mean dose was 20 mg daily for 8 months. At the end of treatment the mean diastolic pressure recumbert, standing, and after exercise had decreased by 10.2, 9.2 and 11 mmHg. Cardiac frequency had decreased by 13, 24 and 29 p. min lying, standing and after exercise. Side effects were rare, with cessation of treatment only in 4 cases.", 
    "42": "Acebutolol whose hypotensive properties are well established, appears as a most interesting beta-adrenergic blocking agent for simplification of treatment of moderate hypertension in man. Hypertensive patients likely to benefit from treatment with acebutolol can be identified within 5 days after administration of a single initial dose of the product. Long-term treatment with acebutolol can be considered in those patients identified as receptive. In non-responders, acebutolol can be used in combination with a diuretic agent. Such simplification of the therapeutic schedule in hypertension will certainly be helpfull both to the physician and his patient.", 
    "43": "A study was set up to assess the effect on the clinical course of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) of giving propranolol 80 mg eight-hourly plus phentolamine 20 mg three-hourly by mouth for three weeks. Out of the 90 patients studied, 14 died. Two of the deaths occurred in an open pilot study of 10 patients, the remaining 12 deaths occurring in patients in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study. Postmortem examination was carried out on 12 of the patients, six of whom had been receiving placebo and six propranolol plus phentolamine. Necrotic myocardial lesions were present in the hearts of all six patients (age range 30-59 years) who died while taking placebo (all had had abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs). In contrast, no necrotic lesions were found in the hearts of the six patients (age range 28-59) who died while receiving the drugs (all had previously had normal ECGs). We conclude that the necrotic myocardial lesions were induced by catecholamines and that propranolol had a cardioprotective effect. While death from a further haemorrhage in cases of SAH is not affected by propranolol and phentolamine, propranolol may have a beneficial effect in other potentially lethal stresses.", 
    "44": "Repetitive stimulation of the locus coeruleus evoked strong inhibition of the firing rate of about 50% of cells of the cingulate rat cortex. Forty per cent of the cells were not affected and 9% were excited by stimulation of the locus coeruleus. Pretreatment of the rats with reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine drastically reduced the percentage of cells inhibited by locus coeruleus stimulation. The cells inhibited in response to stimulation of the locus coeruleus as well as those not inhibited were depressed by microiontophoretically applied norepinephrine. This inhibitory action of NE was observed in rats anesthetized either with urethane, chloral hydrate or with Nembutal. The transsynaptically elicited, as well as the norepinephrine elicited, depression of the cells' discharge rate was antagonized by the microiontophoretically applied beta-receptor blocking drug MJ 1999. These data suggest that the inhibitory action on cingulate cortical cells of locus coeruleus stimulation is mediated by the dorsal ascending noradrenergic pathway.", 
    "45": "An investigation of the stereospecificity of beta-adrenergic insulin release, its relation to alpha-adrenergic blockade and the adrenergic innervation of the pancreatic islets was performed in the mouse. It was observed that in vivo beta-adrenergic stimulation of insulin release by isopropylnoradrenaline was stereospecific for the L-stereoisomer and selectively blocked by the L-isomer of the beta-adrenergic antagonist L-propranolol. D-propranolol had no effect. Pretreatment of mice with a dose of D-isopropylnoradrenaline devoid of insulin releasing activity, slightly increased the subsequent insulin response to a half-maximal dose of L-isopropylnoradrenaline. Basal insulin secretion was blocked by L-propranolol (beta-adrenergic blockade) and increased by phentolamine (alpha-adrenergic blockade). A beta-blocked insulin response to L-isopropyl-noradrenaline could be overcome by alpha-adrenergic blockade depending on the dose of the beta-agonist, suggesting a close association between the adrenergic receptors. The adrenergic innervation of the islet cells was studied by electron microscopic autoradiography after injection of 3H-L-noradrenaline. It was observed that labelled adrenergic nerve terminals were associated with both A1- (D-), A2- and B-cells. The nerves were mainly distributed in the periphery of the islets either as single axons or as bundles. The majority of the terminals were associated with A2-cells, the most frequent cell type in the islet periphery. However, in all islets examined terminals were found close to B-cells. Adrenergic terminals often caused indentations in the contour of an islet cell and were separated from the islet cell membrane only by a narrow intercellular space, about 20 nm in width. It is concluded that the islet cells of the mouse are equipped with the morphological substrate for direct adrenergic regulation. Further it is suggested that the B-cell is supplied with L-stereospecific beta-adrenergic receptors and that the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors are at least partially interrelated.", 
    "46": "The effect of indomethacin on plasma renin activity (PRA), urinary aldosterone, 17 OH ketogenic steroids and plasma cortisol was studied in twenty-three patients with essential hypertension and compared in eleven patients to oxprenolol effect by 2 x 2 factorial trial. Indomethacin decreased PRA and urinary aldosterone: its effect was maintained when the drug was given for three days and it was related to basal PRA and aldosterone values. Therefore in patients with low PRA (renin-sodium index) PRA and aldosterone were unchanged, while they decreased in the normal high PRA group. Aldosterone changes were related to those of PRA, while 17 OH ketogenic steroids and plasma cortisol were unchanged. Both indomethacin and oxprenolol decreased PRA, but no interaction or additive effect was found between the two drugs. The present data indicate that indomethacin can decrease both PRA and aldosterone to an extent which is related to basal values and that aldosterone changes are mainly explained by those of PRA. The PRA unresponsiveness to indomethacin found in low renin patients may suggest renal prostaglandin deficiency. Finally the lack of interaction or of additive effect between indomethacin and oxprenolol may be explained by postulating either that the two drugs act on a common pathway or that an additive effect on PRA cannot be detected renin being maximally suppressed by full renal beta-receptors blockade.", 
    "47": "Effect of angiotensin II was studied on blood sugar level in dogs. Angiotensins given by intravenous route caused a marked rise in blood sugar level. Indomethacin and propranolol significantly influence the changes in blood sugar level induced by angiotensin. It is suggested that the hyperglycaemia induced by angiotensin appears to be mediated by facilitation of adrenaline and prostaglandin release.", 
    "48": "Minimal cardiac transit times are an expression of the maximal velocity of cardiac blood flow. They are related to the mean velocity, and therefore to the ejection fraction. The transit times are easily measured with the help of short-lived radionuclides and with a fast gamma camera. Sensitivity, reproducibility and clinical usefulness of minimal cardiac transit times were proven in more than 4,000 measurements in patients with ischemic heart disease, with myocardial insufficiency with and without digitalis therapy, in patients with valvular disease after surgical insertions of multiple valvula protheses, and in patients with hypothyroidism. Because of the high sensitivity of the method, minor alterations of cardiac function may be detected which are otherwise clinically not easily obtainable."
