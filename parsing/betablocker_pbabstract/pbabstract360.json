Many of the factors that seem to influence the release of ET are modified by prolonged exercise. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of physical exercise on ET plasma concentrations and the effect of alpha- and beta-blockade on ET concentrations at rest and during exercise. Fifteen young volunteers (age 20-35 years) performed an exercise test on a bicycle ergometer. The starting workload of 50 W was increased by 30 W every 3 min until maximal heart rate was achieved; after a 2 min recovery period at 50 W the test continued for 15 min at 60% maximal work load. Blood samples were taken for ET determination before and after the test. After 1 week, the test was repeated. In the 2 days before either the first or the second test, each volunteer randomly received carvedilol (C) (25 mg), an alpha 1-adrenoceptor and beta-adrenoceptor blocker. There was no significant difference in ET concentrations after exercise with or without C administration (1.24 +/- 0.66, 1.42 +/- 0.83, 1.66 +/- 1.15, 1.61 +/- 0.87 pg/mL), showing that prolonged aerobic exercise does not affect plasma ET levels. Moreover, in our healthy young volunteers, blockade of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors had no effect on ET levels at rest and after exercise.", 
    "1": "The Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), an electronic monitor which records the date and time of bottle cap openings, and pill counts were used to assess patterns of adherence for the primary antihypertensive drug in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Pilot Study (AASK). Blacks with hypertension and moderately reduced renal function were randomized to one of two levels of blood pressure control and to one of three antihypertensive drug regimens: primary therapy with a calcium channel blocker, an angiotension converting enzyme inhibitor, or a beta-blocker. Of the 94 participants in AASK, 91 had MEMS recordings and pill counts for 313 regularly scheduled monthly follow-up visits. The average length of follow-up was 4.6 months. An acceptable level of adherence by pill count was achieved if 80% to 100% of the prescribed pills were not returned to the clinic. Adherence by MEMS to a once-a-day drug dosing schedule was acceptable if 80% of the time intervals between MEMS openings were within 24 +/- 6 h. Acceptable adherence by pill count was observed at 68% of the follow-up visits; MEMS indicated nonadherence at 47% of those visits. Blood pressure was within goal in 50% of the participants who were adherent by both pill count and MEMS throughout their follow-up visits, and only 14% of the participants who were identified nonadherent by one or both methods. These findings suggest that electronic monitoring is a useful adjunct to pill counts in assessing adherence to antihypertensive drugs. Feedback of electronically collected information on dosing intervals to participants and staff may enhance adherence.",

    "5": "A subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy was obtained from the abdominal area. Isolated fat cells were prepared and incubated in vitro with different agents acting on lipolysis at defined steps in the lipolytic cascade. Glycerol (lipolytic index), hormone-sensitive lipase activity and incorporation of glucose into lipids were measured.", 
    "6": "VLCD caused a two-fold rise in basal lipolysis (p < 0.005). In spite of this, the maximal lipolytic response of noradrenaline, isoprenaline (non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist), dobutamine (beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist), terbutaline (beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist), CGP 12177 (beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist), forskolin (stimulating adenylyl cyclase), dibuturyl cyclic AMP and 8-bromo cyclic AMP (cyclic AMP analogues resistant or sensitive to phosphodiesterase, respectively) were maintained. No differences were found in the hormone-sensitive lipase activity before or during VLCD. The specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist UK 14304 was equally effective in inducing antilipolysis both before and during calorie restriction. However, during VLCD, the sensitivity and maximal antilipolytic effect of insulin were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) and the ability of insulin to stimulate lipogenesis was almost completely blunted.", 
    "7": "Four weeks of VLCD induced elevated basal lipolysis, a resistance to the ability of insulin to induce antilipolysis and lipogenesis in subcutaneous fat cells, but preserved lipolytic catecholamine action. These are factors that together promote fat mobilization and thereby weight reduction during long-term calorie restriction.", 
    "8": "1. Presynaptic modulation of noradrenaline release in human atrial tissue specimens was investigated under normoxic and anoxic conditions. 2. Noradrenaline release was induced by electrical stimulation and release during experimental intervention (S2) was compared with release during a preceding control stimulation (S1). The results were expressed as the geometric means and 95% confidence intervals of the S2/S1 ratio. 3. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, UK 14304 (0.1 mumol-1) significantly inhibited noradrenaline release, resulting in a S2/S1 ratio of 0.49 (0.40-0.59), and the a 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (1 mumol l-1) increased noradrenaline release (S2/S1 1.83 [1.43-2.35]) during normoxia. Both compounds were ineffective during anoxia. 4. Adenosine (30 mumol-1) inhibited noradrenaline release with a S2/S1 ratio of 0.54 (0.42-0.66). The adenosine antagonist, 8-phenyltheophylline, alone had no effect during normoxia. During anoxia, neither adenosine nor 8-phenyltheophylline altered noradrenaline release. 5. The beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, terbutaline (1 mumol l-1) increased (1.53 [1.14-2.01]) and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, pindolol (1 mumol l-1) suppressed noradrenaline release (0.62 [0.49-0.79]) under normoxic conditions. During anoxia, pindolol significantly inhibited noradrenaline release with a S2/S1 ratio of 0.66 (0.51-0.85), whereas terbutaline did not influence noradrenaline release. 6. Angiotensin II (0.1 mumol l-1 enhanced noradrenaline release resulting in a S2/S1 ratio of 1.44 (1.34-1.54), while the angiotensin II antagonist, losartan (1 mumol l-1) had no effect on noradrenaline release during normoxia. Conversely, angiotensin II did not increase noradrenaline release and losartan significantly inhibited noradrenaline release to a S2/S1 ratio of 0.60 (0.46-0.77) during anoxia. 7. In conclusion, human cardiac tissue possesses presynaptic inhibitory alpha 2-adrenoceptors and adenosine receptors, as well as facilitatory beta 2-adrenoceptors and angiotensin II receptors regulating noradrenaline release under normoxic conditions. During anoxia the responses to alpha 2-adrenoceptors and adenosine receptor stimulation are lost, whereas facilitatory responses to beta 2-adrenoceptors and adenosine II receptor stimulation are maintained and these receptors appear to be maximally stimulated. This differential presynaptic modulation in anoxia may contribute to enhanced sympathetic activity in ischaemia.", 
    "9": "1. The chronotropic effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) were investigated using injections (50 micrograms in 1 ml of Tyrode solution as bolus over 1 min) directly into the sinus node artery of 21 anaesthetized and vagotomized dogs which had been pretreated with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. The injections were also repeated following: (a) alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism (prazosin) and muscarinic receptor antagonism (atropine); (b) inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (indomethacin); (c) angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonism (losartan); (d) histamine H1 (mepyramine) and H2 (cimetidine) receptor antagonism. 2. The results obtained indicate that ANP had no significant effect on the basal sinus rate, whereas CNP produced a slight but significant increase of 12 +/- 2 beats min-1. The effect of CNP was long-lasting (return to pre-injection levels after maximum effect in 17 +/- 3 min) and was not influenced by the various antagonists mentioned above. 3. During in vitro experiments on spontaneously beating right atria isolated from 6 dogs, the injection of CNP (50 micrograms in 1 ml of Tyrode solution) into the sinus node artery produced an increase in atrial rate of 14 +/- 1 beats min-1. 4. The results of this work indicate that CNP exerts a significant and prolonged positive chronotropic effect both in vivo and in vitro. Other studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of action of CNP on the heart conduction system, to ascertain the presence of natriuretic peptide receptor B in the region of the sinoatrial node and to determine the role of CNP in the control of heart rate.", 
    "10": "1. Previous observations that centrally injected interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) into rabbits induces a sustained rise in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) as well as fever, prompted us to undertake an in vitro study to corroborate the in vivo results and gain insight as to the source and mechanism of IL-1 beta-induced Ca2+ mobilization. 2.IL-1 beta treatment of rat striatal slices preloaded with 45Ca2+ elicited a rise in spontaneous 45Ca2+ release which was dose-dependent, delayed in onset and of extended duration. At concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 ng ml-1, the 45Ca2+ efflux increased by 6.3 +/- 1.3 (s.e. mean), 33.4 +/- 5.0 and 159 +/- 10.5% respectively. 3. At 1 microgram ml-1, the specific IL-1 receptor antagonist, IRAP, antagonised the effect induced by, 10 ng ml-1 IL-1. 4. Caffeine 10 mM,which failed to release calcium on its won, potentiated IL-1-elicited 45Ca2+ release. 5. Perfusion with a Ca(2+)-free medium obtained by use of excess EGTA (3 mM) or in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine (3 x 10(-8 M) abolished the potentiating effect of caffeine without affecting the IL-1-induced 45Ca2+ release. 6. Preincubation of slices for 4 h with Bordetella pertussis toxin (PTX, 1.3 micrograms ml-1) did not change the pattern of Ca2+ efflux in response to IL-1. 7. In conclusion, these data indicate that IL-1 stimulates calcium release from brain tissue by a specific, receptor-mediated mechanism which partly depends on extracellular calcium but does not involve a PTX-sensitive G protein as part of the transducing signal.", 
    "11": "1. Dopamine is assumed to affect the ovary function after its conversion into noradrenaline (NA). 2. To study this bovine luteal slices from 11-14 days of the oestrous cycle were preincubated for 24 h to recover beta-receptors and next they were incubated for 1, 2 or 4 h with (a) different doses of dopamine; (b) dopamine together with a beta-antagonist (propranolol) or with a dopamine receptor blocker (droperidol); (c) dopamine with a dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor. 3. Dopamine stimulated the luteal content of oxytocin (OT) and progesterone. This effect was inhibited by propanolol but not by droperidol. 4. Dopamine added to the medium was followed by an increase of noradrenaline there. This rise was dose and time-dependent. 5. The dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor, inhibited the stimulating effect of dopamine on luteal progesterone and OT content. 6. Bovine corpus luteum can synthesize de novo NA from dopamine as a precursor.", 
    "12": "1. The direct positive chronotropic effects of angiotensin II (AII) and its degradation products angiotensin III (AIII) and angiotensin IV (AIV) were established in pithed rats and in rat spontaneously beating right atria. 2. In pithed rats, AII, AIII and AIV caused dose-dependent tachycardia with similar maximal responses (110 beats min-1). The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (3.37 x 10(-6) mol kg-1) but not the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (2.38 x 10(-7) mol kg-1) significantly reduced these effects (P < 0.05; n = 7-8), but 20-25% of the responses could not be blocked by propranolol. 3. In isolated atria, AII, AIII and AIV caused concentration-dependent increases in beating rate with similar maximal responses to AII and AIII (34.3 +/- 0.4 and 34.7 +/- 0.4 beats min-1; n = 9-10), and a lower maximal response to AIV (26.8 +/- 0.6 beats min-1; P < 0.05; n = 8). AIII was about 9 times less potent than AII, whereas AIV proved approximately 3800 times less potent than AII. Neither propranolol (1 microM) nor prazosin (1 microM) could influence the effects of the angiotensin peptides. 4. In isolated atria, the selective AT1-receptor antagonist, losartan (10, 100 and 300 nM) caused parallel rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves for AII and AIII, whereas the selective AT2- receptor antagonist PD123177 (1 microM) did not influence the effects of AII and AIII. The aminopeptidase-A and -M inhibitor amastatin (10 microM), significantly steepened the slope of the AIII curves and increased the potency of AIII about 6 fold. Amastatin did not influence the responses to AII. 5. Our results indicate that both in vivo and in vitro, exogenous AII and AIII induced a direct dose-dependent chronotropic effect, which is independent of the adrenergic system. This chronotropic effect is mediated by AT1-subtype receptors.", 
    "13": "Nisoldipine coat-core is a long-acting formulation of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium channel blocker) nisoldipine, suitable for once daily administration in the treatment of patients with hypertension. In clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, nisoldipine coat-core has efficacy and tolerability similar to those of other calcium antagonists, and antihypertensive efficacy equivalent to that of agents from various other drug classes including beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Unlike beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics, calcium antagonists (including nisoldipine coat-core) are not associated with clinically significant adverse metabolic effects on the serum lipid profile or glycaemic control. Nevertheless, published guidelines or consensus papers on the pharmacological management of patients with hypertension recommend calcium antagonists (and other drugs) as \"alternative first-line' agents, while beta-blockers and diuretics are generally considered to be first-line therapy because of demonstrated benefits in terms of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this clinical setting. Nisoldipine coat-core maintains consistent plasma drug concentrations and antihypertensive effects throughout the 24-hour dosage interval, thereby attenuating intermittent reflex increases in sympathetic activity. This pharmacological profile may have important clinical implications; recent retrospective data suggest an association between moderate to high dosages of short-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists and adverse cardiovascular events, although this has yet to be confirmed in large prospective trials. In addition, the high degree of vasoselectivity of nisoldipine minimises negative inotropic effects which may be observed with less selective agents such as nifedipine. Nisoldipine coat-core is, therefore, a useful alternative to other antihypertensive agents in the management of patients with hypertension, providing consistent antihypertensive efficacy and good tolerability with once daily administration.", 
    "14": "Despite the growing number of patients discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of unstable angina, the diagnostic procedures and treatment of unstable angina are still greatly debated, as they have been for patients with myocardial infarction. In recent years the definition and classification of the clinical syndrome of unstable angina has been subjected to numerous proposals by distinguished cardiologists. An attempt to clarify and redefine practical guidelines for different subgroups of patients has been developed and carried out by the US Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR). The current medical approach to treatment of patients with unstable angina is discussed in detail, analysing the role of antiplatelet medications, beta-blockers, nitrates, heparin and calcium antagonists. The small subgroup of patients with refractory unstable angina should undergo urgent coronary angiography and revascularisation. Previous and current research on medical treatment with thrombolytic therapy, GPIIb/IIIa platelet receptor blockers and direct thrombin inhibitors is outlined, keeping in mind one of the main aspects of pathophysiology of the disease, that is ongoing thrombus formation. In the future, a more aggressive strategy aimed at normalising the atherogenic lipid profile in this very high risk group of patients should be carried out, based on the positive results of lipid-lowering drug trials both in primary and secondary prevention.", 
    "15": "This study describes the establishment of a rat kidney cortical collecting duct (CCD) clonal cell line (RCCD1 cells) that maintains high transepithelial resistance and specific hormonal sensitivities. Immortalized cells were obtained by infection of primary cultured CCD cells with the wild-type simian virus 40. Grown on Petri dishes, RCCD1 cells are organized as monolayers of cuboid cells separated by tight junctions and form domes. Grown on permeable filters, confluent RCCD1 cells exhibit high transepithelial resistance (Rt: 2390 +/- 140 omega. cm2), transepithelial potential difference (PD) of -10.5 +/- 1.2 mV lumen negative, an associated short-circuit current (Isc) of 4.3 +/- 0.5 microA/cm2, and generated significant Na+, K+, H+ and HCO3- gradients, reflecting Na+ and H+ reabsorption and K+ and HCO3- secretion. RCCD1 cells exhibit features of both principal (PC) and intercalated (IC) cells. Consistent with PC phenotype, about 50% of the cells were positively stained by a PC-specific agglutinin. In situ hybridization studies revealed the presence of alpha, beta and gamma subunit mRNAs of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel and alpha 1 and beta 1 subunits of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase. Moreover, Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase was immunolocalized at the basolateral side of the cells. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) induced a significant increase in both cellular cAMP content and Isc. Amiloride decreased in a dose-dependent manner Isc from untreated and AVP-treated RCCD1 cells. In addition, a barium-sensitive K+ conductance was evidenced in the apical side of the cells. Consistent with IC phenotype, isoproterenol (ISO) provoked a large increase in cellular cAMP and stimulated Isc. The effect of ISO on Isc was blocked by 5 x 10(-3) M DPC, a chloride channel blocker. Finally, AVP plus ISO had additive effect on Isc. Taken together, these results provide evidence that the RCCD1 cell line has maintained many of the original properties of rat CCD from which they were derived.",

    "17": "In this randomised, double-blind placebo controlled study, 45 ASA II patients, treated for essential hypertension with drugs other than beta blockers, were divided into three groups of 15 patients each. Patients in different groups either received 20 ml normal saline (Group P), or 100 mg esmolol (Group E100) or 200 mg esmolol (Group E200) as a single bolus intravenous dose before laryngoscopy and intubation. Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure and heart rate were monitored for up to 10 min following intubation and were compared with respective basal readings as well as across groups.", 
    "18": "Esmolol alone reduced systolic arterial pressure (P < 0.01 in Group E100 and P < 0.001 in Group E200) and heart rate (P < 0.001). Though there was an increase in arterial pressure and heart rate in the control group, esmolol 100 mg maintained arterial pressure and heart rate at levels comparable to basal values throughout the study (P > 0.05). Patients receiving esmolol 200 mg had lower values (P < 0.001) than their basal readings during most of the post-intubation study period.",

    "20": "The effects of noradrenergic and cholinergic receptor agonists on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in single dissociated rat pineal cells were investigated by microfluorimetric measurements in Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2/AM) loaded cells. Noradrenaline (NA) evoked characteristic biphasic increments of intracellular Ca2+ consisting of one or more leading spikes followed by a plateau, resulting from the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and from the influx of Ca2+ from the external medium, respectively. This response was reproduced by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine (PE), in the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, and was abolished when NA or PE was applied in conjunction with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin. The curve relating the peak amplitude of the Ca2+ increments to different PE concentrations (0.5-10 microM) showed a half-maximum response at 0.6 microM PE, and saturation at concentrations greater than 2 microM. Acetylcholine (ACh) also elicited transient Ca2+ increments consisting of an abrupt rise to a maximum value which decayed exponentially to the basal Ca2+ level. A half-maximum response was achieved at 59 microM ACh. The muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist, carbachol (CCh), similarly activated Ca2+ increments while the muscarinic antagonist, atropine, abolished them. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, repetitive stimuli with either alpha 1-adrenergic and muscarinic agonists produced a progressive decrement in the amplitude of the Ca2+ signals because of the depletion of intracellular stores. However, extinction of the response to muscarinic agonists did not preclude a response to adrenergic agonists, while the contrary was not true. These results suggest that these agonists liberate Ca2+ from two functionally distinct, caffeine-insensitive, Ca2+ intracellular stores.", 
    "21": "We present a case in which an anemic patient with religious objections to blood transfusion experienced three episodes of severe myocardial ischemia during the perioperative period. The first episode of ischemia was successfully treated by discontinuing isoflurane and resolving the hypotension. The second and third episodes were successfully treated by heart rate control with esmolol and neostigmine.", 
    "22": "The effectiveness of beta-blockers in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA) suggests that beta-adrenergic overactivity is involved in the manifestation of NIA. As an approach to understanding this postulated overactivity, we investigated the beta 2-receptor density on mononuclear blood cells in 21 patients suffering from NIA as well as in 12 patients without NIA. The beta 2-receptor density in NIA-positive patients was significantly higher than that in NIA-negative patients (t = 2.84; p = .008). The NIA-positive patients were treated with 20 mg propranolol t.i.d. for 5 days. The beta 2-receptor density in treatment responders did not differ significantly from that in non-responders. Our results indicate that beta 2-receptors on mononuclear cells in patients with NIA may be of a certain degree of importance. With the prerequisites of replicability as well as correlation of this parameter with therapeutic success of beta-blockers, it may be considered as a predictor for treatment response.", 
    "23": "Presentations of acute systemic weakness are rare and appear dramatic and frightening to both patients and physicians. Aetiologies are multifactorial and diverse. Morbidity and mortality are associated with the unrecognized disease. One of the underlying disorders is hypokalaemic thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (HTPP), an uncommon disorder. HTPP is characterized by periodic occurrences of muscle weakness during attacks of hyperthyroidism and appears predominantly in Orientals. This article describes a patient of Chinese origin with hyperthyroidism and attacks of paralysis and considers several problems: a lack of familiarity with the syndrome, increasing numbers of patients with this disease in European hospitals as a result of migration of populations, and the importance of patient compliance in therapeutic management. Finally, a review of the literature concerning presentation, differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, and therapeutic management is provided.", 
    "24": "We have used confocal fluorescence microscopy and fluorescent calcium indicators to investigate the relationship between light-induced elevation of intracellular calcium ion concentration (Cai) and depolarization in small volumes of cytosol close to the microvillar plasma membrane of the ventral photoreceptor of Limulus polyphemus. We prolonged the latency of the light response by treatment of cells with hydroxylamine and injection of the G-protein blocker, guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate (GDP-beta S). Such treatment increased the latency of the cell's response from approximately 20 to 50 ms. In both treated and untreated cells we observed a close correlation between the times at which we first detected the electrical response and the elevation of Cai. We obtained 18 out of 54 and 12 out of 22 recordings, in untreated and treated cells respectively, for which the elevation of Cai was detected simultaneous with, or 1-4 ms prior to, the electrical response to light. The prolonged latent period exhibited by treated cells may make possible future investigation of the effects on the initial response to light of local photolytic release of caged compounds at the microvillar membrane.", 
    "25": "The determination of the affinity and efficacy of an agonist in functional (as opposed to radioligand binding) experiments is necessary to explain its potency. Using modeled dose-response data both in their ideal form and with an added average deviation as well as previously published experimental data, a variety of analytical approaches were compared which differed in goodness-of-fit, ease of handling, and range of successful application. A nonlinear curve-fitting algorithm that analyzed several dose-response curves simultaneously and fitted them to an extended version of the operational model of Black and Leff (1983) (Proc R Soc Lond B 220:141-162) was demonstrated to be superior to the other approaches using the above criteria. However, judging from the limitations of the analytical approaches, claims of efficacy or affinity differences between agonists that are based on less than 10-fold numerical differences in the same behavioral paradigm should be viewed with skepticism. It was also found that simple inspection of dose-response curves obtained before and after administration of an insurmountable antagonist give estimates of fair accuracy under most circumstances.", 
    "26": "Over the past 20 years, the concept of chronic heart failure has changed. The activation of neurohumoral system is important in worsening the chronic heart failure. Therefore, it is reasonable to block the effect of the renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system on the heart for treatment of heart failure. Many studies have demonstrated that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce the level of angiotensin II and plasma norepinephrine, and improve long-term hemodynamics and survival in patients with chronic heart failure. However, despite the wide use of ACE inhibitors, the prognosis of chronic heart failure remains poor. Although beta-blockers can block the effect of sympathetic nervous system activity, these agents had not been used for the treatment of chronic heart failure because of its negative inotropic action. In 1975, Waagstein and associates described functional improvement in seven patients receiving beta-blockers. Subsequently, many workers have examined the therapeutic efficacy of beta-blockers in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Eleven studies reported the long-term effect of beta 1-selective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathetic activity including metoprolol and bisoprolol, and 14 studies were performed using beta-blockers with vasodilator properties including bucindolol and carvedilol. These studies predominantly included patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, although some also included patients with ischemic heart disease. Most but not all of these studies showed beneficial effects on symptoms, hemodynamics and morbidity in both dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic heart disease. Vasodilating beta-blockers may provide an additional useful effect compared to beta-blockers without vasodilator properties. However, direct comparisons between beta-blockers with and without vasodilator properties on clinical efficacy have not yet been made. The effect of beta-blockers on survival was investigated in five controlled trials. Although these studies suggested a beneficial effect of beta-blockers on survival in chronic heart failure, the effect has not yet been conclusively determined especially in patients with chronic heart failure due to ischemic heart disease. Some investigators are proposing the use of beta-blockers in chronic heart failure to ameliorate the harmful effect of excess sympathetic stimulation, but the exact mechanisms of beta-blockers are uncertain. Although a large number of studies have demonstrated the usefulness of beta-blocker treatment for chronic heart failure, many unsolved problems such as the exact mechanisms of beneficial effect, usefulness for ischemic heart disease, and the optimal agent and dose for treatment remain. Further studies are needed to establish this treatment.", 
    "27": "Aortic clamp-induced hypertension has long been implicated in the cardiovascular mortality and morbidity following infrarenal aortic operations. We studied the physiologic mechanisms leading to clamp-induced hypertension. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output, heart rate, and left ventricular pressure were measured in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Animals received alpha, beta, both alpha and beta, or no adrenergic blockade (n = 3, 4, 12 and 7, respectively). The infrarenal aorta was clamped following ligation of the infrarenal collateral vessels (lumbar, circumflex iliac, and tail arteries). Statistical analysis used paired t tests within groups, and ANOVA and unpaired t tests between groups, with Bonferroni's correction as indicated. Following placement of the clamp, MAP increased immediately in all groups, with magnitude of the increase related to the extent of adrenergic blockade. MAP increased 5.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg with no blockade (P = 0.0005), 6.7 +/- 0.8 mm Hg with alpha blockade (P = 0.0153), 15 +/- 3.1 mm Hg with beta blockade (P = 0.0163), and 16.7 +/- 1.3 mm Hg with combined alpha and beta blockade (P < 0.0001). The increase in MAP immediately following infrarenal aortic clamping was most pronounced with combined alpha and beta blockade. We suggest that acute intraoperative hypertension associated with infrarenal aortic clamping is caused by the attenuation of compensatory baroreceptor reflex mechanisms.", 
    "28": "Although most of arrhythmia are secondary to cardiac disease, for example, ischemic heart disease and valvular heart disease, some types of arrhythmia are hereditary. Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a hereditary cardiac disorder that causes syncope and sudden death from ventricular tachyarrhythmia. A boy eight years old, who had the familial history of LQTS in his sister and mother, admitted in our hospital. He had some episodes of syncope and markedly prolonged QT interval of 0.58 seconds in electrocardiogram. After follow-up of 12 years, he died suddenly because of interrupted medication including beta-blocker. Another patient with ventricular tachyarrhythmia also admitted. His family tree in which three young men died suddenly, revealed hereditary cardiomyopathy. Hereditary cardiac arrhythmia as shown the above clinically important because of prevention from sudden death, especially in young patients.", 
    "29": "Class III antiarrhythmic drugs prolong action potential duration by blocking cardiac potassium channels. Amiodarone and d-1 sotalol are representative class III drugs commonly used for drug resistant arrhythmias. Amiodarone has miscellaneous properties including potassium, sodium, calcium, and nonspecific sympathetic blocking effects when it is given orally. It mainly blocks sodium channels when it's given intraveneously. Amiodarone requires careful follow up because of its important side effects. Some randomised studies are still ongoing to confirm whether amiodarone can improve mortality in patients with refractoly ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "30": "It has been reported that beta-blocker treatment reduces the incidence of sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction, possibly due to antiischemic and antiarrhythmic effects. Beta adrenoceptor blocking drugs are administered, as an antiarrhythmic agent in patients with hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Even low dose beta-blocker administration reduces the incidence of PVC's. Beta blockers are expected to decrease the ventricular rate of persistent tachyarrhythmias resulting from excessive cardiac sympathetic tone. Existence of denervated areas in myocardium in the cases of ventricular tachyarrhythmias may be shown in the cardiac scintigram as abnormal myocardial uptake of 123I-MIBG.",

In the past 3 decades, substantial advances have been made in the ability to identify and treat anxiety disorders including panic disorder (PD), social phobia (SP), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is now known that these common, usually chronic disorders confer significant disability to untreated sufferers. This overview highlights some of the important advances in pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders. Evidence for efficacy of the various pharmacological agents (including relevant oral dosing and plasma-level data) and of acute and long-term treatment, and the disadvantages of medication treatment are discussed. Finally, some important clinical questions remaining to be addressed by psychopharmacological research are reviewed.", 
    "32": "Mechanism of essential tremor remains unknown. Central oscillators, postulated in thalamus, inferior olive, and spinal cord are thought to be important to form rhythmicity, and finally to stimulate spinal or medullary motor cells, leading trembling muscle contraction, tremor. Among several subtypes of essential familial tremor, including hand tremor, neck tremor, and voice tremor, essential neck tremor is a common disorder, and its pathophysiology seems different from that of typical essential hand tremor, since patients with essential hand tremor are responsive to beta blocker, whereas those with neck tremor are usually not. We experienced a 41-year-old left handed woman with essential neck tremor in whom neck titubation disappeared shortly after pontine base infarct. She was our patient in the outpatient clinic with the diagnosis of essential neck tremor. The tremor developed when she was teenage, and has been localized in the neck muscles. Alcohol intake had apparently diminished it transiently. Her mother also had the tremor in her neck. She was admitted to our hospital with sudden onset of right-sided limb weakness and speech disturbance. Neurological examination showed right hemiparesis including the ipsilateral face, scanning speech, and cerebellar limb ataxia on the same side. In addition, there was no tremor in her neck. Brain MR imaging revealed a pontine base infarct at the level of middle pons, which was consistent with paramedian artery territory. The hemiparesis and speech disturbance improved almost completely after treatment, and her neck tremor has never occurred in one year follow-up. In our patient, efficacy of alcohol imply that essential neck tremor and hand tremor had same central nervous pathway including central oscillator in common, and descending cortical fibers is seemingly associated with diminishing patient's tremor. Pathophysiology of essential neck tremor was discussed with reviewing previous literature.", 
    "33": "To determine whether two topical beta-blockers, timolol and carteolol, differently affect plasma lipids and lipoproteins in normolipidemic Japanese patients with glaucoma.", 
    "34": "Thirty-three normolipidemic patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomly allocated to and completed 16 weeks of bilateral treatment with 0.5% timolol, 1.0% carteolol, or 2.0% carteolol twice daily in a three-center, prospective study. Patients using any drugs affecting plasma lipids or with a history of beta-blocker use of hyperlipoproteinemia were excluded. Fasting blood lipids and lipoproteins, including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and apoproteins, were measured three times before therapy was initiated. These measurements were repeated every 4 weeks during the treatment period.", 
    "35": "The level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly decreased in the timolol treatment group but did not change in the carteolol treatment groups. The ratio of total cholesterol minus high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in the timolol treatment group.", 
    "36": "Topical beta-blockers do affect plasma lipids in Japanese patients with glaucoma. The effects of timolol are greater than those of carteolol.", 
    "37": "The transition from sleep to waking is associated with the abolition of spindle waves in thalamocortical neurons and the GABAergic cells of the thalamic reticular/perigeniculate nuclei. We tested the possibility that norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) may abolish spindle wave generation through an enhancement of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current Ih in thalamocortical neurons. Local application of agents known to enhance Ih, including 5-HT, NE, the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, and the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, to lamina A1 of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus resulted in an abolition of local spindle wave generation in thalamocortical neurons. The abolition of spindle waves was reversed by the local application of the Ih channel blocker, cesium. These results suggest that NE and 5-HT may abolish the generation of spindle waves through the modulation of Ih in thalamocortical neurons.", 
    "38": "The regional hemodynamic changes caused by intracerebroventricular 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were investigated in conscious Long-Evans and Brattleboro rats with chronically implanted Doppler flow probes. In both strains, a low dose of 5-HT (4 nmol/kg) caused a pressor response associated with tachycardia, mesenteric vasoconstriction, and a transient hindquarters vasodilatation. In Long-Evans rats, higher doses of 5-HT (40 and 120 nmol/kg) caused a pressor response, a bradycardia, mesenteric vasoconstriction, and maintained hindquarters dilatation. The bradycardia and mesenteric vasoconstriction caused by 40 nmol/kg of 5-HT in Long-Evans rats were attenuated by d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)arginine vasopressin, a V1-receptor antagonist. In Brattleboro rats the high doses of 5-HT failed to cause a pressor response but caused a delayed depressor response, a transient tachycardia, less mesenteric vasoconstriction, and a larger initial hindquarters dilatation compared with Long-Evans rats. The initial part of the hindquarters vasodilator response caused by 120 nmol/kg of 5-HT in Brattleboro rats was attenuated by the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI-118551. In Long-Evans rats, N,N-di-n-propyl-5-carboxamidotryptamine maleate (DP-5-CT; 3, 30, and 100 nmol/kg icv), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, caused a tachycardia associated with a marked hindquarters vasodilatation. These changes were accompanied by a weak mesenteric vasoconstriction and, for the highest dose of DP-5-CT, a pressor response. These data overall are consistent with the hemodynamic effects of intracerebroventricular 5-HT contingent on vasopressin release and, along with DP-5-CT, sympathoadrenal excitation; however, additional mechanisms are indicated.", 
    "39": "During hypoxia, the heart consumes glycogen to generate ATP. Tolerance of repetitive hypoxia logically requires prompt replenishment of glycogen, a process whose regulation is not fully understood. To examine this, we imposed a defined hypoxic stimulus on the rat heart while varying its workload. In intact rats, hypoxia reduced myocardial glycogen approximately 30% and increased both the fraction of glycogen synthase in its physiologically active (GS I) form (from 0.24 +/- 0.06 to 0.82 +/- 0.07; P < 0.005) and glycogen synthesis (from 0.087 +/- 0.011 to 0.375 +/- 0.046 mumol.g-1.min-1; P < 0.005). Reducing cardiac work (with propranolol or heterotopic transplantation) reduced glycogen breakdown, glycogen synthase activation, and glycogen synthesis in parallel, stepwise fashion in intact rats. Correspondingly, hypoxia increased GS I activity in the perfused heart in vitro, but only under conditions where glycogen was consumed. This suggests myocardial glycogen synthase is activated by systemic hypoxia and catalyzes rapid posthypoxic glycogen synthesis. Hypoxic glycogen synthase activation appears to be a proportionate, wholly intrinsic response to local glycogenolysis, operating to preserve myocardial glycogen stores independent of any extracardiac mediator of carbohydrate metabolism.", 
    "40": "Transgenic mice have been created with 200-fold overexpression of beta 2-adrenergic receptors specifically in the heart. Cardiac function was studied in these transgenic mice and their controls at baseline and during isoproterenol perfusion or sympathetic nerve stimulation. The model used was an in situ buffer-perfused, innervated heart, and the left ventricle maximal derivative of pressure over time (dP/dtmax) and heart rate (HR) were measured. Basal HR and dP/dtmax were 30-40% higher in hearts from transgenic mice than controls. Electrical stimulation of sympathetic nerves (2, 4, and 8 Hz) or infusion of isoproterenol markedly increased HR and dP/dtmax in control hearts. Hearts from transgenic mice did not respond to isoproterenol. However, hearts from transgenic mice retained the HR response to nerve stimulation, and a small increase in dP/dtmax was also detected. Atenolol inhibited the response to nerve stimulation in control hearts but not that in hearts from transgenic mice. ICI-118551 inhibited the response in transgenic hearts. Basal HR and dP/dtmax were decreased by ICI-118551 only in transgenic hearts. Thus overexpression of cardiac beta 2-receptors modifies beta-adrenergic activity, but the responses to endogenous and exogenous adrenergic stimulation are affected differently.", 
    "41": "The cholinergic and beta-adrenergic sweat secretions from human sweat glands differ with respect to secretory rates and their susceptibility to cystic fibrosis (CF). Using the cultured beta-adrenergic-sensitive sweat secretory cell, we sought to determine the intracellular electrophysiological mechanisms underlying these functional differences. We found that the cholinergic agonist methacholine (10(-6) M) induced a Ca(2+)-dependent biphasic membrane potential (Vm) response: an initial hyperpolarization and a secondary depolarization. The initial hyperpolarization was independent of bath Cl- and dependent on transmembrane K+ gradient. However, the secondary depolarization of Vm was dependent on bath Cl-. In contrast, the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10(-5) M) induced a monophasic depolarization of Vm. This depolarization was 1) dependent on bath Cl-, 2) independent of K+ conductance (GK) blocker Ba2+ (5mM), 3) unaffected by the methacholine-induced secondary depolarization of Vm, and 4) absent in cells derived from CF subjects. These results indicated that the cholinergic agonist-induced secretion mainly involves the activation of Ca(2+)-dependent GK and Cl- conductance (GCl), whereas the beta-adrenergic secretion seems to mainly depend on the activation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-GCl.", 
    "42": "The adrenergic regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis and blood flow was investigated in nonobese patients (10 men and 23 women) undergoing cholecystectomy. Two microdialysis probes were inserted into the scadipose tissue and microdialyzed in the absence or presence of 10(-4) mol/L of either nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol or nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine. The catecholamines increased rapidly after intubation and subsequent surgery and extubation (P = 0.0001; F = 11-13). In the middle of surgery, the elevations of the noradrenaline and adrenaline levels were almost 3 times the basal value. At the end of surgery, they dropped in parallel, but increased again, only to reach their absolute maximum in connection with extubation (10- and 3-fold elevation, respectively). Plasma glycerol and free fatty acids started to increase about 30 min after plasma catecholamines. These increases in catecholamines were paralleled by an increase in the dialysate glycerol level (lipolysis index). Propranolol inhibited by two thirds (P = 0.003) and phentolamine further stimulated by 25% (P = 0.04) the increase in glycerol in the tissue dialysate induced by the operation. There was a transient decrease in tissue blood flow (ethanol escape from the microdialysis probe; P < 0.001) at the beginning of the surgical procedure. This was not affected by propranolol or phentolamine. In conclusion, during anesthesia and surgical trauma, endogenous catecholamines modulate adipose tissue lipolysis via alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. However, the vasoconstriction induced by these procedures seems to be independent of the adrenergic system.", 
    "43": "Direct effects of ONO-1101 \u00bf(-)-[(S)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methyl-3-[4-[(S) -2-hydroxy-3-(2-morpholino carbonylamino)ethylamino] propoxy]phenylpropionate monohydrochloride), a novel beta-antagonist, on action potential parameters and membrane currents, and its beta adrenoceptor antagonism were examined in cardiac muscle. Action potential-parameters in papillary muscle of reserpinized animals and membrane currents recorded from single myocytes obtained from guinea pig and rabbit hearts were not affected by 1 to 100 microM ONO-1101. On the other hand, ONO-1101 markedly inhibited the potentiation of Ca current by isoproterenol in single cardiac myocytes of the guinea pig. The concentration-response relationship of Ca current for isoproterenol was shifted to the right. This effect resembled that of esmolol, which is also a beta adrenoceptor antagonist. A Schild plot analysis revealed the slope and pA2 value of each antagonist (ONO-1101, 0.94, 8.0; and esmolol, 0.98, 7.3, respectively) and demonstrated that ONO-1101 is about 5 times more potent than esmolol as a beta-antagonist. Two other effects of isoproterenol: 1) potentiation of delayed rectifier K current and 2) activation of chloride current, were also inhibited by ONO-1101. The time required for 50% removal of beta-antagonism of ONO-1101 and esmolol after the washout was estimated as 4 and 6 min, respectively, in depolarized papillary muscle. These results suggest that ONO-1101 is a potent beta-antagonist whose effects were removed quickly by washout. When applied at what is thought to be a clinical dosage, ONO-1101 had no direct effects on action potential-parameters and membrane currents in cardiac muscle. These characteristics of ONO-1101 suggest that this agent may be effective in clinical use.", 
    "44": "To report the results of two studies on the use of dorzolamide as adjunctive therapy to timolol in patients with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). In the larger study, the additive effect of dorzolamide administered twice daily also was compared with 2% pilocarpine.", 
    "45": "Both studies were parallel, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled comparisons. In the pilot study, 32 patients received 0.5% timolol twice daily plus either 2% dorzolamide twice daily or placebo twice daily for 8 days. In the Pilocarpine Comparison Study, 261 patients received 0.5% timolol twice daily plus 0.7% dorzolamide twice daily, 2% dorzolamide twice daily, 2% pilocarpine four times daily, or placebo (twice daily or 4 times daily) for 2 weeks. Patients then entered a 6-month extension period and received 0.5% timolol twice daily plus either 0.7% dorzolamide twice daily, 2% dorzolamide twice daily, or 2% pilocarpine four times daily.", 
    "46": "In the pilot study, after 8 days, additional mean percent reductions in IOP for 2% dorzolamide and placebo were 17% and 3% at morning trough and 19% and 2% at peak, respectively. In the Pilocarpine Comparison Study, after 6 months, additional mean percent reductions in IOP (morning trough) were 9%, 13%, and 10% for 0.7% dorzolamide, 2% dorzolamide, and 2% pilocarpine, respectively. Patients receiving 2% pilocarpine had the highest rate of discontinuation due to a clinical adverse experience, and the use of dorzolamide was not associated with systemic side effects commonly observed with the use of oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.", 
    "47": "Dorzolamide twice daily was effective and well tolerated by the patients in these studies as adjunctive therapy to timolol. The larger study demonstrated that both concentrations of dorzolamide produce similar IOP-lowering effects to 2% pilocarpine.", 
    "48": "A human homolog of the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel beta subunit (hSlobeta) was cloned, and its effects on a human BK channel (hSlo) phenotype are reported. Coexpression of hSlo and hSlobeta, in both oocytes and human embryonic kidney 293 cells, resulted in increased Ca2+ sensitivity, marked slowing of BK channel activation and relaxation, and significant reduction in slow inactivation. In addition, coexpression changed the pharmacology of the BK channel phenotype: hSlo-mediated currents in oocytes were more sensitive to the peptide toxin iberiotoxin than were hSlo + hSlobeta currents, and the potency of blockade by the alkaloid BK blocker tetrandrine was much greater on hSlo + hSlobeta- mediated currents compared with hSlo currents alone. No significant differences in the response to charybdotoxin or the BK channel opener NS1619 were observed. Modulation of BK channel activity by phosphorylation was also affected by the presence of the hSlobeta subunit. Application of cAMP-dependent protein kinase increased P(OPEN) of hSlo channels, but decreased P(OPEN)of most hSlo + hSlobeta channels. Taken together, these altered characteristics may explain some of the wide diversity of BK channel phenotypes observed in native tissues.", 
    "49": "Numerous studies have demonstrated that subjects with allergic asthma have beta-adrenergic hyporesponsiveness, predisposing these individuals toward bronchospasm, mucous production, and mast cell degranulation. Since sympathetic innervation of the human respiratory tract is sparse, reduced beta-responsiveness probably results from alterations at or beyond the receptor level.", 
    "50": "We therefore examined whether anaphylaxis of human lung tissue acutely modulated the human lung beta-receptor system in ways that might lead to decreased beta-adrenergic responsiveness.", 
    "51": "Fresh thoracotomy peripheral lung samples from 26 patients were incubated with (anaphylaxis) or without (control) anti-IgE (1:100) for up to 90 minutes and histamine release was documented. Lung fragments were quick frozen at various times after anti-IgE for analyses of beta-receptor binding parameters. Antagonist Kd (dissociation constant) and receptor concentration values were determined using (-)[125I]pindolol and agonist IC50 values were determined using isoproterenol.", 
    "52": "In comparison with time O, neither anaphylaxis nor control samples had differences in receptor binding parameters with time. There were also no differences between anaphylaxis and control lung samples at any time point, and ratios of log control binding parameter/log anaphylaxis binding parameter ranged from 0.96 to 1.01.", 
    "53": "Anaphylaxis of lung does not lead to acute changes in antagonist or agonist affinity for beta-receptors or changes in receptor concentration. Under the conditions studied, lung mast cell degranulation does not acutely alter the human lung beta-receptor system in ways that might account for the beta-adrenergic hyporesponsiveness found in allergic asthma.", 
    "54": "The regulation of the expression of beta-adrenoceptor (beta-ARs) is not thoroughly understood. We demonstrate that the rat heart cell-line H9c2 expresses both beta 1- and beta 2-ARs. In radioligand-binding experiments, the maximal binding capacity of (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol was determined as 18 +/- 0.6 fmol/mg of protein with a KD of 35.4 +/- 4.1 pM. Competitive radioligand-binding experiments with subtype-specific beta-antagonists reveal a subtype ratio of beta 1- to beta 2-ARs of 29%: 71%. With competitive reverse-transcriptase PCR we found beta 2-mRNA to be up to 1600 times more frequent than beta 1-mRNA. Treatment of the H9c2 cell-line with the beta-adrenergic agonist (-)-isoproterenol (10(-6) M), the antagonist (-)-propranolol (10(-6) M) and the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (500 nM) induces regulatory effects on both the beta-AR protein and mRNA level. Isoproterenol treatment leads to down-regulation of the total receptor number by 56 +/- 4%, due to a decrease in beta 2-ARs, while maintaining the beta 1-AR number constant. On the transcription level, both beta 1-and beta 2-mRNAs are decreased by 30% and 42% respectively. mRNA stability measurements reveal a reduced half-life of beta 2-mRNA from 9.3 h to 6.5 h after isoproterenol treatment. Incubation of cells with (-)-propranolol does not affect the amounts of beta-ARs and their mRNAs. Dexamethasone induces a 1.8 +/- 0.2-fold increase in beta-AR number over the basal level as well as a 1.9 +/- 0.2-fold increase in the amount of beta 2-mRNA. Because the half-life of beta 2-mRNA was unaffected by dexamethasone, the increased beta 2-mRNA level must be due to an enhanced transcription rate. The beta 1-mRNA levels are unchanged during dexamethasone-incubation of the cells. Our data clearly demonstrate that treatment of H9c2 rat heart cells with isoproterenol and dexamethasone induces alterations in the level of RNA stability as well as gene transcription, leading to altered receptor numbers.", 
    "55": "The effect of sotalol on the rate and the RR interval variability of induced ventricular tachycardia was studied in 26 patients. Sotalol increased the mean cycle length and irregularity of RR intervals, which may affect detection of ventricular tachycardia by implantable cardioverter-defibrillator devices.", 
    "56": "Hemodynamic variables were evaluated in 10 patients during supraventricular tachycardia before and after administration of intravenous propranolol. The drug markedly worsened the already compromised hemodynamic pattern of supraventricular tachycardia.", 
    "57": "beta-Blockers may reduce cardiac sympathetic activity in patients with heart failure by antagonizing beta-adrenergic receptors that facilitate sympathetic outflow to the heart. To explore this possible effect of beta-blockade, we measured cardiac norepinephrine spillover responses in patients with heart failure after the acute administration of either propranolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, or metoprolol, a beta 1-selective agent.", 
    "58": "Eighteen patients were studied. Repeated intravenous doses of propranolol (0.5 mg; nine patients; left ventricular ejection fraction, 14 +/- 2%) or metoprolol (1.0 mg; nine patients; left ventricular ejection fraction, 18 +/- 2%) were administered until one of the following end points was reached: a 15% decrease in heart rate, left ventricular +dP/dt, or mean arterial blood pressure or a 5 mm Hg increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Propranolol (mean dose, 2.0 mg) and metoprolol (mean dose, 3.6 mg) caused similar reductions in heart rate, +dP/dt, and coronary sinus plasma flow. Cardiac norepinephrine spillover was reduced after propranolol (277 +/- 55 to 262 +/- 53 pmol/min, P < .05) but was increased after metoprolol (233 +/- 57 to 296 +/- 82 pmol/min, P < .05). In a comparison of the two groups, the decrease in spillover after propranolol was significantly different than the increase seen after metoprolol (P < .01).", 
    "59": "The administration of a beta 1-selective antagonist was associated with increased cardiac norepinephrine spillover. In contrast, the administration of a nonselective beta-blocker until similar hemodynamic end points were reached caused a reduction in norepinephrine spillover. This suggests that in patients with heart failure, nonselective beta-blockade may have favorable inhibitory effects on cardiac sympathetic activity.", 
    "60": "The negative chronotropic effect of beta-blocking agents is likely to provide hemodynamic and energetic advantages. However, the negative chronotropic effect on cardiac energetics observed on the initiation of beta-blockade therapy has not been fully elucidated.", 
    "61": "In 18 patients with heart failure, left ventricular pressure and volume, external work (EW), myocardial oxygen consumption per beat (total Vo2), mechanical efficiency (EW/total Vo2), and Vo2 for nonmechanical work (total Vo2-2.EW) were measured with the use of conductance catheter and Webster catheter at the following three states: under control conditions and after beta-blockade (0.15 +/- 0.07 mg/kg propranolol IV) with and without atrial pacing to keep the heart rate at control levels. Heart rate decreased after atrial pacing was stopped. EW decreased during beta-blockade with pacing and returned to the control level after pacing was stopped. Total Vo2 did not change during beta-blockade with or without pacing, whereas Vo2 for nonmechanical work increased with pacing and returned to the control level after pacing was stopped. As a result, mechanical efficiency decreased during beta-blockade with pacing and returned to the control level after pacing was stopped.", 
    "62": "The negative chronotropic effect of a beta-blocking agent may offset the mechanoenergetical deterioration resulting from its negative inotropic effect through a reduction in oxygen expenditure for nonmechanical work. These findings suggest that the negative chronotropic effect is an important aspect of beta-blockade therapy.", 
    "63": "The effect of intravenous injection of propranolol, verapamil, terbutaline, calcium, and edrophonium on neuromuscular transmission has been studied with repetitive nerve stimulation and clinical tests in 10 patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). The drugs were given intravenously in doses commonly used in clinical practice. Only minor clinical effects were noted except for edrophonium. The mean decrement of the deltoid muscle was not significantly changed after injection of propranolol (before 31%, 15 min after injection 27%) and verapamil (before 29%, 15 min after injection 26%). Terbutaline applied after propranolol and calcium applied after verapamil improved the decrement substantially. Edrophonium applied after propranolol or verapamil also greatly improved the decrement. We conclude that there is no rapid deterioration of neuromuscular transmission in patients with moderately severe MG after injections with therapeutic doses of propranolol and verapamil. However, we do not know if the most severely disabled MG patient could have reacted otherwise. We consider that, in cardiovascular emergencies, propranolol and verapamil may be used even in severe MG but with resuscitation equipment as well as specific antidotes available.", 
    "64": "We have previously shown that whole-cell L-type Ca2+ current that was stimulated through beta-adrenergic receptors was negatively modulated by alpha 1-adrenergic activation. In the present study, we investigated the kinetic basis of this modulation at the single-channel level in adult rat ventricular myocytes using Ba2+ as the charge carrier. Unitary current sweeps were evoked by 300-ms depolarizing pulses to 0 mV, from a holding potential of -50 mV at 0.5 Hz. During control conditions, the ensemble-averaged current amplitude was 0.18 +/- 0.01 pA (n = 7). To achieve beta-adrenergic stimulation (beta effect), cells were superfused with norepinephrine (10 mumol/L) in the presence of prazosin (10 mumol/L), an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker. beta-adrenergic stimulation enhanced ensemble-averaged current (from 0.18 +/- 0.01 to 0.75 +/- 0.04 pA, P < .05, n = 7), increased the open-time constants, and decreased the closed-time constants. To activate alpha 1-receptors while maintaining the beta-adrenergic stimulation, cells were superfused with norepinephrine alone (alpha 1 + beta effects). alpha 1-adrenergic activation reduced ensemble-averaged current (from 0.75 +/- 0.04 to 0.41 +/- 0.03 pA, P < .05, n = 7), decreased open-time constants, and increased closed-time constants. alpha 1-adrenergic activation also inhibited ensemble-averaged currents stimulated by a low concentration (10 mumol/L) of 8-bromo-cAMP but not by (-)Bay K 8644 (1 mumol/L). Calphostin C (1 mumol/L), a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, attenuated alpha 1-adrenergic inhibition on beta-adrenergic-stimulated unitary currents. We conclude that alpha 1-adrenergic activation exerts an inhibitory effect on beta-adrenergic-stimulated unitary Ba2+ current at the single-channel level. The shortening of the open-time and the lengthening of the closed-time constants and the increase in blank sweeps may explain the inhibition of the Ca(2+)-channel activity and the reduction in whole-cell Ca2+ current previously reported. This inhibition is in part mediated through the protein kinase C pathway.", 
    "65": "A new method has recently been developed to quantify pulmonary beta-adrenergic receptors in vivo using PET. This study used in vitro radioligand binding assay (RLBA) as the gold standard to validate in vivo PET measurements.", 
    "66": "Five male patients with lung cancer aged 57 yr (range 42-67 yr) were studied. PET scanning was performed the day before thoracotomy to determine regional pulmonary beta-receptor density. RLBA was carried out on cell membranes prepared from specimens of lung tissue obtained at the thoracotomy to measure beta-receptor density in vitro. In both cases, the hydrophilic nonselective beta-antagonist radioligand (S)-CGP-12177 was used. For PET studies, this was labeled with 11C and for RLBA with 3H.", 
    "67": "In the PET study, beta-receptor density (Bmax) was 9.43 +/- 1.32 pmole g-1 tissue. In the RLBA study, Bmax was 99.0 +/- 15.5 fmole mg-1 protein, equivalent to 9.90 +/- 1.55 pmole mg-1 tissue. These values are in good agreement with previously reported in vitro measurements on human lung membranes using 125I-iodocyanopindolol. A correlation was found between beta-adrenergic density obtained using PET and beta-adrenergic density obtained using RLBA (r = 0.92; p < 0.05).", 
    "68": "The results support the use of PET as a new method for imaging and the way for studies of physiological and pharmacological regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors through noninvasive serial measurements.", 
    "69": "To investigate the influence of neuropeptide Y (NPY) on heart function in a relatively simple model system, the effects of eel NPY (eNPY) on the eel atrium were examined. Eel NPY enhanced the contractile force of the isolated atrium in a dose-dependent manner, without altering the rate of contraction. Although adrenaline also exerts a positive inotropic effect, the effect of eNPY was not blocked by the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist betaxolol, indicating that eNPY does not act via adrenaline release. When eNPY and adrenaline were applied simultaneously, their effects were additive at lower concentrations but not at higher concentrations. The plateau reached at high concentrations suggests that these two regulators act through a common signal transduction process. One candidate for this is an elevation of the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), since treatment with eNPY or adrenaline enhanced [Ca2+]i, as assessed by fluorescence of Calcium Green-1. The increase in [Ca2+]i after eNPY and adrenaline treatment is presumably due to Ca2+ influx from the external medium, since the effect was greatly reduced in Ca(2+)-free Ringer's solution and after treatment with verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker. Although both eNPY and adrenaline enhanced the atrial contractile force, the time courses were different, with the effect of eNPY being gradual and long-lasting, and that of adrenaline being immediate and transient. It is plausible, therefore, that eNPY and catecholamine(s) act synergistically to cause a long-lasting enhancement of contraction force if the two regulators arrive at the atrium simultaneously. The present study also demonstrates that the eel heart contains eNPY.", 
    "70": "Because various antihypertensive drugs adversely affect lipid metabolism, these drugs may increase associated risks for coronary artery disease and thus offset some of the beneficial effects of blood pressure reduction. In this paper the current literature regarding the effects of antihypertensive agents on serum lipids is reviewed. Differing effects of various classes of antihypertensives are assessed to further our understanding of this very important subject.", 
    "71": "The effect of beta-blockade on heart-rate variability was assessed at different heart rates in 52 patients with heart failure included in the randomized, placebo-controlled, Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS). Scatterplots of R-R intervals display beat-to-beat variability by plotting each R-R interval against the preceding interval. Scatterplot dispersion at different R-R intervals provides a measure of beat-to-beat heart-rate variability at different heart rates. A 24-hour Holter tape was performed at baseline and after 2 months of treatment with bisoprolol or matched placebo. Geometric measurements of scatterplots were used to determine beat-to-beat dispersion for different R-R intervals. Bisoprolol and placebo groups were well matched at base-line. After 2 months of treatment, bisoprolol significantly increased beat-to-beat variability at the longest R-R intervals (p < 0.05); however, there was no change in scatterplot dispersion at the shortest R-R intervals. This suggests that beta-blockade increases parasympathetic or decreases sympathetic tone or both in heart failure patients only at the slowest heart rates.", 
    "72": "Tumorigenic mouse lung-derived type 2 cell lines have large reductions in both beta-adrenergic-stimulated cAMP production and ligand binding to beta-adrenergic receptors. These tumorigenic cells are also relatively insensitive to glucocorticoids. Because glucocorticoids regulate both beta-adrenergic receptor expression and receptor coupling to the stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding protein Gs interactions between the glucocorticoid and beta-adrenergic signalling systems were examined. This study demonstrates that beta-adrenergic ligand binding and agonist sensitivity are increased in a tumorigenic cell line stably expressing a normal glucocorticoid receptor transgene. However, although the transfected tumour cells and non-tumorigenic cells have similar amounts and affinities of beta-adrenergic agonist and antagonist binding, similar amounts of Gs subunits and similar forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities, the former remain much less isoproterenol responsive. Competition binding studies demonstrate that tumour cell beta-adrenergic receptors have both high- and low-affinity agonist binding but are functionally uncoupled from Gs. This uncoupling may involve an alteration in Gs, as guanine nucleotides exhibit a reduced ability to stimulate adenylyl cyclase. Thus, some aspects of tumorigenic cell dysfunction in beta-adrenergic signalling can be ameliorated by interactions with the glucocorticoid pathway, but additional defects are also involved.",

    "85": "We recently demonstrated the mitogenic and secretagogic actions of lithium in the insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cell (Sj\u00f6holm A, Welsh N, Hellerstr\u00f6m C: Lithium increases DNA replication, polyamine content and insulin secretion by rat pancreatic beta-cells in vitro. Am J Physiol 262:C391-C395, 1992). In this study, the influence of lithium on beta-cell signal transduction pathways was monitored and their importance for the stimulated cell replication and hormone secretion was elucidated by selective pharmacological probes. To this end, fetal rat pancreatic islets enriched in beta-cells were isolated and cultured for 3 days with or without 10 mmol/l LiCl. This resulted in a marked mitogenic response by the beta-cells, of similar magnitude to that obtained by pharmacological activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases by forskolin or the Sp-diastereomer of cAMP or protein kinase C stimulation by phorbol ester. However, neither did lithium affect the islet content of cAMP (whereas forskolin did), nor was the mitogenic response to the ion impeded when islets were pretreated with the Rp-diastereomer of cAMP, a specific antagonist of cAMP-dependent protein kinases, or by the Ca2+ channel blocker D-600. The protein kinase C inhibitor 1-(5'-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine prevented the mitogenicity of phorbol ester, but not that of lithium. Conversely, addition of increasing concentrations of inositol along with lithium also did not affect the mitogenicity of the ion, providing indirect evidence against the involvement of protein kinase C in mediating the growth-promoting effect of lithium in this system. It was found that pretreatment of islets with pertussis toxin, which inactivates GTP-binding proteins by ADP-ribosylation, prevented the mitogenicity and part of the secretagogic action of lithium. It is concluded that although specific activation of the cAMP and protein kinase C signaling systems appears sufficient to trigger a mitogenic response of the beta-cell, lithium seemingly does not work through any of these systems nor via Ca2+ influx in promoting beta-cell mitogenesis. Our results, moreover, suggest that the actions of lithium are conveyed by pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding proteins.", 
    "86": "The cellulases cellobiohydrolase 1 (CBH 1) and endoglucanase 1 (EG 1) from the fungus Trichoderma reesei are closely related with 40% sequence identity and very similar in structure. In CBH 1 the active site is enclosed by long loops and some antiparallel beta-strands forming a 40 A long tunnel, whereas in EG 1 part of those loops are missing so that the enzyme has a more common active site groove. Both enzymes were immobilized on silica and these materials were used as chiral stationary phases for chromatographic separation of the enantiomers of two chiral drugs, propranolol and alprenolol. The CBH 1 phase showed much better resolution than did the EG 1 phase, suggesting that the tunnel structure of the protein may play an important role in the chiral separation. The chiral compounds were found to be competitive inhibitors of both enzymes when p-nitrophenyl lactoside (pNPL) was used as substrate. (S)-enantiomers showed stronger inhibitory effects and also longer retention time on the stationary phases than the (R)-enantiomers. The consistency between kinetic data and retention on the stationary phases clearly shows that the enzymatically active sites of CBH 1 and EG 1 are involved in chiral recognition.", 
    "87": "We have investigated the effects of the beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agent, propranolol (9-300 microM) on several pro-inflammatory activities of human neutrophils in vitro. Superoxide production by calcium ionophore (A23187)-activated neutrophils was particularly sensitive to inhibition by low concentrations (9-18.7 microM) of this drug. However, inhibition of superoxide generation by neutrophils activated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), opsonized zymosan (OZ), and arachidonate (AA) only occurred with higher concentrations of propranolol, and coincided with decreased intracellular calcium fluxes, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity and synthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF). Propranolol possessed neither cytotoxic nor superoxide-scavenging properties but, using a haemolytic assay of membrane-stabilizing activity, this agent neutralized the membrane-disruptive effects of the bioactive phospholipids, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), PAF, and lysoPAF(LPAF). A mechanistic relationship between the anti-oxidative and membrane-stabilizing properties of propranolol was suggested by the observation that pretreatment of neutrophils with LPC or PAF eliminated the inhibitory effects of the drug on superoxide generation by PMA-activated neutrophils. Dexpropranolol, a stereoisomer with minimal beta-blocking activity, and propranolol were equally effective with respect to their membrane-stabilizing and anti-oxidative interactions with neutrophils, but several other beta-blocking agents (atenolol, metoprolol, sotalol, and timolol) did not possess these activities. Inhibition of oxidant generation is, therefore, not a common property of beta-blocking agents and, in the case of propranolol, appears to occur as a consequence of membrane-stabilization rather than by beta-receptor-directed effects.", 
    "88": "In humans the last steps in the synthesis of aldosterone and cortisol rely on the activity of two cytochrome P450 genes termed CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase; P450aldo) and CYP11B1 (11 beta hydroxylase; P450cl1). The mechanisms which lead to differential expression of these two genes within the adrenal cortex are not well-defined. The human adrenocortical cell line. H295R, was utilized in this study to examine the intracellular second messenger pathways regulating expression of P450aldo and P450c11. using specific ribonuclease protection assays. Treatment of H295R cells with angiotensin II or potassium (K+) caused a time-dependent induction in the level of P450aldo transcripts. While K+ treatment was more specific for the induction of P450aldo mRNA, treatment with angiotensin II increased levels of both P450aldo and P450c11 transcripts. To define the second messenger systems which influence transcript levels for these enzymes, the effects of agonists of the protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and calcium pathways were tested on the expression of P450aldo and P450c11. Activation of the protein kinase A pathway by the agonists, dibutyryl cAMP or forskolin, preferentially increased the P450c11 transcript to a greater degree than P450aldo. Interestingly, activation of the protein kinase C pathway by tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) did not alter transcripts for either P450aldo or P450c11. The calcium channel agonist BAYK 8644 mimicked the effects of K+ by increasing the transcript for P450aldo. However, the calcium channel blocker nifedipine attenuated the stimulatory effects of angiotensin II and K+ on the levels of P450aldo. However, the calcium channel blocker nifedipine attenuated the stimulatory effects of angiotensin II and K+ on the levels of P450aldo transcripts without affecting the stimulatory effect of dbcAMP. This study demonstrates that the protein kinase A pathway preferentially induces P450c11 mRNA over that of P450aldo. In addition, pharmacologic agents that affect calcium levels provide evidence for an additional regulatory mechanism in modulating the expression of P450aldo. This is of importance since the major physiologic regulators of aldosterone secretion, angiotensin II and K+ are able to increase intracellular calcium but have little effect on intracellular cAMP levels.", 
    "89": "In addition to its well known sedative and teratogenic effects, thalidomide also possesses potent immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory activities, being most effective against leprosy and chronic graft-versus-host disease. The immunomodulatory activity of thalidomide has been ascribed to the selective inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha from monocytes. The molecular mechanism for the immunomodulatory effect of thalidomide remains unknown. To elucidate this mechanism, we synthesized an active photoaffinity label of thalidomide as a probe to identify the molecular target of the drug. Using the probe, we specifically labeled a pair of proteins of 43-45 kDa with high acidity from bovine thymus extract. Purification of these proteins and partial peptide sequence determination revealed them to be alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). We show that the binding of thalidomide photoaffinity label to authentic human AGP is competed with both thalidomide and the nonradioactive photoaffinity label at concentrations comparable to those required for inhibition of production of tumor necrosis factor alpha from human monocytes, suggesting that AGP may be involved in the immunomodulatory activity of thalidomide.",

    "91": "Beta3-adrenoceptors are involved in metabolism, gut relaxation, and vascular vasodilation. However, their existence and role in the human heart have not been documented. We investigated the effects of several beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on the mechanical properties of ventricular endomyocardial biopsies. In the presence of nadolol, a beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, isoprenaline produced consistent negative inotropic effects. Similar negative inotropic effects also resulted from the action of beta3-adrenoceptor agonists with an order of potency: BRL 37344 > SR 58611 approximately CL 316243 > CGP 12177. The dose-response curve to BRL 37344-decreasing myocardial contractility was not modified by pretreatment with nadolol, but was shifted to the right by bupranolol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. Beta3-adrenoceptor agonists also induced a reduction in the amplitude and an acceleration in the repolarization phase of the human action potential. Beta3-adrenoceptor transcripts were detected in human ventricle by a polymerase chain reaction assay. These results indicate that: (a) beta3-adrenoceptors are present and functional in the human heart; and (b) these receptors are responsible for the unexpected negative inotropic effects of catecholamines and may be involved in pathophysiological mechanisms leading to heart failure.",

Similar percent increases occurred in the ventricular effective period at the 2 heart rates at all tested times (p >0.2 in each case), and it was concluded that there is no evidence for reverse-use dependence of intravenous sotalol in its effects on right ventricular refractoriness over this range of heart rates.", 
    "93": "The effect of thyroid hormones on the beta 3-adrenoceptor expression was studied in the preadipose 3T3-F442A cell line. As assessed by molecular and pharmacological analyses, triiodothyronine addition to differentiating 3T3-F442A cells caused a 2.3-fold increase in beta 3-adrenoceptor mRNA levels, which was correlated with a parallel induction of beta 3-adrenoceptor number and of beta 3-adrenoceptor coupling to the adenylate cyclase system. Nuclear transcription experiments showed that triiodothyronine did not significantly alter the transcription rate of the beta 3-adrenoceptor gene. By contrast, the hormone increased by 36% the half-life of beta 3-adrenoceptor mRNA. Triiodothyronine exhibited a discrete effect on beta 3-adrenoceptor expression when added to mature 3T3-F442A adipocytes. This study indicates that thyroid hormones exert a differentiation-dependent and post-transcriptional regulation of beta 3-adrenoceptor expression in adipocytes.", 
    "94": "The thermodynamics and mass transfer kinetics of the retention of the R and S enantiomers of propranolol were investigated on a system comprising an acetic acid buffer solution as the mobile phase and the protein cellobiohydrolase I immobilized on silica as the stationary phase. The bi-Langmuir isotherm model fitted best to each set of single-component isotherm data. The monolayer capacity of the nonchiral type of adsorption sites was 22.9 mM. For the chiral type of sites, it was 0.24 mM for the R enantiomer and 0.64 mM for the S enantiomer. Peak tailing was observed, even at very low concentrations allowing operation of the low-capacity chiral sites under linear conditions. This tailing can be explained on the basis of heterogeneous mass transfer kinetics. At higher concentrations, which are often used in analytical applications, the isotherms on the chiral sites no longer have a linear behavior, and peak tailing is consequently more pronounced. Under those conditions, peak tailing originates from the combined effect of heterogeneous thermodynamics and heterogeneous mass transfer kinetics. These complex phenomena are explained and modeled using the transport-dispersive model with a solid film linear driving force model modified to account for heterogeneous mass transfer kinetics. The rate coefficient of the mass transfer kinetics was found to be concentration dependent.",

Both groups were matched for sex (82 men), age (58 +/- 10 years), ejection fraction (40 +/- 12%), extent of coronary artery disease, presenting arrhythmia, and year that treatment began. In all patients in the sotalol group, VT/VF was inducible in the drug-free electrophysiological study. Induction of sustained VT/VF was suppressed by d,l-sotalol (438 +/- 95 mg/d). In the ICD group, either VT/VF was not inducible (n = 5) or inducible sustained VT/VF was refractory to antiarrhythmic drug treatment (n = 45). Sotalol treatment led to a marked reduction in arrhythmic events. Whereas 83% of the patients in the sotalol group were free of sudden death and nonfatal VT at 3 years, only 33% of the ICD patients did not receive appropriate ICD therapies (P < .005). Actuarial rates for absence of sudden death at 3 years were 85% in the sotalol group and 100% in the ICD group (P < .005). Actuarial rates for overall survival at 3 years were 75% in the sotalol group and 85% in the ICD group (P = .02).",

    "103": "The release of [3H]inositol phosphates from myo-[3H]inositol-prelabeled LA-N-2 cells was measured in the presence of beta-adrenoceptor, metabotropic glutamate and bombesin agonists. Norepinephrine and isoproterenol increased the formation of [3H]inositol phosphates in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 100 microM for norepinephrine and an EC50 of 5 microM for isoproterenol. These stimulations were abolished by propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, with an IC50 in the range of 50-55 microM for both norepinephrine and isoproterenol. The stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate appearance occurred with varying concentrations of trans-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD), a metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist. This release of [3H] inositol phosphates was blunted by its antagonist, 2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (AP-3). Bombesin and neuromedin-B, a bombesin-like peptide, also increased the appearance of [3H]inositol phosphates. This was blunted by the antagonist [Tyr4, D-Phe12] bombesin. The appearance of [3H]inositol phosphates stimulated by t-ACPD was coupled through a cholera toxin-sensitive G-protein and the bombesin-stimulated appearance of [3H]inositol phosphates was coupled through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. The norepinephrine-stimulated appearance of [3H]inositol phosphates was toxin insensitive. The stimulation of the [3H]inositol phosphate appearance by these three agonists was protein kinase and Ca2+ independent.",

Isomeric activity ratios of trimetoquinol isomers [(-)-(S)- > > (+)-(R)-] in esophageal smooth muscle in the presence and absence of 1 microM pindolol were 1995- and 2951-fold, respectively; and were much greater than those in rat atria (282-fold) and rat trachea (107-fold). The atypical beta/beta 3-adrenoceptor partial agonist, ICI D7114, produced concentration-dependent rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves of (-)-isoprenaline, (-)-trimetoquinol and the reference atypical beta/beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, BRL 37344. Schild plot analysis of ICI D7114 against trimetoquinol gave slope and pA2 values of 0.91 and of 7.9, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that the relaxant effects of these agonists in rat esophageal smooth muscle are primarily mediated through the activation of atypical beta/beta 3-adrenoceptors.

    "105": "At least three distinct beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) subtypes exist in mammals. These receptors modulate a wide variety of processes, from development and behavior, to cardiac function, metabolism, and smooth muscle tone. To understand the roles that individual beta-AR subtypes play in these processes, we have used the technique of gene targeting to create homozygous beta 1-AR null mutants (beta 1-AR -/-) in mice. The majority of beta 1-AR -/- mice die prenatally, and the penetrance of lethality shows strain dependence. Beta l-AR -/- mice that do survive to adulthood appear normal, but lack the chronotropic and inotropic responses seen in wild-type mice when beta-AR agonists such as isoproterenol are administered. Moreover, this lack of responsiveness is accompanied by markedly reduced stimulation of adenylate cyclase in cardiac membranes from beta 1-AR -/- mice. These findings occur despite persistent cardiac beta 2-AR expression, demonstrating the importance of beta 1-ARs for proper mouse development and cardiac function, while highlighting functional differences between beta-AR subtypes.",

Structural restraints consisting of 289 interproton distances inferred from NOEs and 9 backbone and 5 side chain dihedral angle restraints from spin-spin coupling constants were used as input for simulated annealing calculations and energy minimization in the program X-PLOR. In addition to the 1H NMR derived information, the 13C resonances of GIIIB were assigned at natural abundance, and hydroxyproline C beta and C gamma chemical shifts were used to distinguish between the cis and trans peptide bond conformations. The final set of 20 structures had mean pairwise rms differences over the whole molecule of 1.22 A for the backbone atoms and 2.48 A for all heavy atoms. For the well-defined region encompassing residues 3-21, the corresponding values were 0.74 and 2.54 A, respectively. GIIIB adopts a compact structure consisting of a distorted 310-helix, a small beta-hairpin, a cis-hydroxyproline, and several turns. The molecule is stabilized by three disulfide bonds, two of which connect the helix and the beta-sheet, forming a structural core with similarities to the CS alpha beta motif [Cornet, B., Bonmatin, J.-M., Hetru, C., Hoffmann, J. A., Ptak, M., & Vovelle, F. (1995) Structure 3, 435-448]. This motif is common to several families of small proteins including scorpion toxins and insect defensins. Other structural features of GIIIB include the presence of eight arginine and lysine side chains that project into the solvent in a radial orientation relative to the core of the molecule. These cationic side chains form potential sites of interaction with anionic sites on sodium channels. The global fold is similar to that reported for mu-conotoxin GIIIA, and the structure of GIIIB determined in this study provides the basis for further understanding of the structure-activity relationships of the mu-conotoxins and for their binding to skeletal muscle sodium channels.", 
    "107": "The effects of adrenergic compounds on the thermoregulation of resting honey bees were investigated using a non-traumatizing approach. Bees fed ad lib were treated orally and kept at an ambient temperature of 22 degrees C; the surface thoracic temperature was monitored by infrared thermography. Bees were treated with the adrenergic agonists epinephrine and ephedrine, and with the beta-blocking agent alprenolol. Low doses of adrenergic agonists had no significant effect on thermogenesis, but high doses caused a hypothermia. Alprenolol triggered a dose-dependent hypothermia that was reversed by low doses of epinephrine and ephedrine. Results are discussed with reference to the metabolic and neural adrenergic pathways that may be involved in bee thermoregulation.", 
    "108": "Proarrhythmia in the form of Torsade de Pointes tachycardia (TdP) is a well-known complication of sotalol treatment. It most often occurs in the setting of sotalol overdosing, renal impairment, bradycardia, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesiaemia or lengthening of the QT-interval due to other drugs. TdP is reported without these predisposing factors. In the described case, TdP might be facilitated by bradycardia and by potassium depletion without concomitant hypokalaemia after diuretic treatment.", 
    "109": "Left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction is associated with an increased risk of death. Other studies have suggested that a potassium-channel blocker might reduce this risk with minimal adverse effects. We investigated whether d-sotalol, a pure potassium-channel blocker with no clinically significant beta-blocking activity, could reduce all-cause mortality in these high-risk patients.", 
    "110": "Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less and either a recent (6-42 days) myocardial infarction or symptomatic heart failure with a remote (> 42 days) myocardial infarction were randomly assigned d-sotalol (100 mg increased to 200 mg twice daily, if tolerated) or matching placebo twice daily.", 
    "111": "After 3121 of the planned 6400 patients had been recruited, the trial was stopped. Among 1549 patients assigned d-sotalol, there were 78 deaths (5.0%) compared with 48 deaths (3.1%) among the 1572 patients assigned placebo (relative risk 1.65 [95% CI 1.15-2.36], p = 0.006). Presumed arrhythmic deaths (relative risk 1.77 [1.15-2.74], p = 0.008) accounted for the increased mortality. The effect was greater in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 31-40% than in those with lower ( <or= 30%) ejection fractions (relative risk 4.0 vs 1.2, p = 0.007).", 
    "112": "Among the 1549 patients evaluated, administration of d-sotalol was associated with increased mortality, which was presumed primarily to be due to arrhythmias. The prophylactic use of a specific potassium-channel blocker does not reduce mortality, and may be associated with increased mortality in high-risk patients after myocardial infarction.", 
    "113": "We examined the effect of HSR-81 ((-)-(R)-alpha-[(tert-butylamino)methyl]-2-chloro-4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol L-tartrate), a newly developed, potent and selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, as well as ritodrine and isoproterenol, on the spontaneous rhythmic contraction in uteri isolated from late pregnant, middle pregnant and non-pregnant (dioestrous and oestrous) rats. The three agonists inhibited the spontaneous rhythmic contraction at all the stages in a concentration-dependent manner. The pD2 value for HSR-81 was greater in late pregnancy than in dioestrus and oestrus. In the uterine preparations of late pregnancy and dioestrus, ICI-118,551 (1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropyl-aminobutan-2-ol , a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) and atenolol (a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) produced a parallel rightward shift of the concentration-response curves for HSR-81. The pKB values for ICI-118,551 and atenolol suggest that the inhibitory effect of HSR-81 was mediated through beta 2-adrenoceptors in the two stages. In the membranes prepared from rat uteri in late pregnancy and dioestrus, the equilibrium dissociation constant for [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding was not significantly different between the two stages. The three beta-adrenoceptor agonists and the two antagonists competed for the specific [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding and the pKi values were not significantly different between the two stages. However, the maximum number of binding sites was significantly greater in late pregnancy than in dioestrus. The configuration of the competition curves and the pKi values for the two antagonists confirmed the fact that these membranes contain predominantly beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype. These results indicate that the potent inhibition of the spontaneous rhythmic contraction by HSR-81 in the pregnant uterus may be due to the increased number of beta 2-adrenoceptors.",

    "116": "Our patient, who had hyperthyroidism and hypercalcemia, was found to have an inappropriately high level of intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) because of a parathyroid adenoma, detected on a parathyroid scan. With propranolol treatment, however, improvement was noted in both laboratory data--intact PTH, ionized calcium, serum total calcium, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], and urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate--and findings on ultrasonography and nuclear parathyroid scanning. Later, the adenoma was removed surgically. The improvement of PHP after administration of a beta-adrenergic blocker suggested that the parathyroid adenoma in this patient was not completely autonomous. The patient also had vitamin D-deficient osteomalacia that was confirmed by a low serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3) and by bone histomorphometry. This coexisting condition was caused by the long-term increase in conversion of 25OHD3 to 1,25(OH)2D3 from hyperparathyroidism in a patient with low stores of vitamin D (which were ascribed to aging, liver dysfunction in hyperthyroidism, a vegetarian diet, deprivation of sunlight, and avoidance of dairy products).", 
    "117": "The complex concurrence of hyperthyroidism, PHP, and vitamin D-deficient osteomalacia is rare but possible.", 
    "118": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether beta-adrenergically mediated cardiovascular functions such as arterial pressure (AP), heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), peripheral resistance (R(p)), arterial impedance (Z(c)), mean arterial compliance (C(m)) and pulse wave reflection (P(b)) were altered in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) compared to the normotensive Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY). In pentobarbital-anesthetized and artificially ventilated rats, the aortic pressure wave was recorded with a high-fidelity Millar sensor, and aortic flow wave with an electromagnetic flow probe. The pressure and flow waves were subjected to Fourier transform so as to analyze impedance spectra. Acute beta-adrenergic blockade was produced by an intravenous injection of propranolol (nonselective) and atenolol (selective beta(1)-blocker) at doses of 2 and 5 mg/kg, respectively. Steady-state parameters were obtained 15-20 min after intravenous administration. The SHR had higher AP, HR, R(p) and Z(c) than the WKY. SV and CO remained unaltered while C(m) was lower. In response to propranolol, the mean AP was increased by 7 mm Hg in the WKY, but did not change in the SHR. Moreover, significant decreases occurred in HR, CO and C(m) in addition to increases in R(p), Z(c) and P(b). These changes between the SHR and WKY were only slight. Atenolol caused decreases in AP, HR and CO in both SHR and WKY, but did not significantly alter the R(p), Z(c), C(m) and P(b). Again, the atenolol-induced changes in AP, HR and CO did not appear to be significantly different between SHR and WKY. The results indicate that beta-adrenergic effects on the heart, Windkessel and resistance vessels are neither greatly enhanced nor impaired during the development of hypertension. In the hypertensive state, significant beta-adrenergic mechanisms still exert tonic vasodilatory effects on the large and small arterial system. Copyright 1996 S. Karger AG, Basel", 
    "119": "To evaluate the interaction between the nonselective beta-blocker, pindolol, and epinephrine contained in a local anesthetic solution, the left ventricular diastolic filling velocity was examined with pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Arterial blood pressure (BP), the R-R interval on the electrocardiogram (RR), and Doppler echo-cardiographic measurements were recorded in seven healthy volunteers after 45 micrograms of epinephrine contained in lidocaine (L-E) was injected in the maxilla after pretreatment with 5 mg of pindolol. The administration of L-E caused the elevation of BP and an increase in RR interval. Peak early (E) and peak atrial (A) filling velocities decreased, whereas isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and diastolic filling period (DFP) were prolonged. Although the ratio of E to A (E/A) remained unchanged, E/A/DFP was reduced. In contrast, when L-E was given without pindolol pretreatment, RR interval was shortened and BP was unchanged. The increase of both E and A velocities and the shortening of both IVRT and DFP were observed. E/A remained unchanged but E/A/DFP was increased. These results suggested that L-E caused opposite effects on the left ventricular filling velocity in the presence or absence of pindolol. We conclude that epinephrine activates the left ventricular relaxation rate but impairs it in the presence of pindolol.",

Maximum mean percent reduction in SBP was 13.3, 9.7, 15.7 and 19.9 and in DBP was 21.2, 13.9, 12.5 and 20.4 with NIF, CAP, MET and NIF + MET respectively. A safe DBP of < or = 110 mm Hg (Kaplan) was achieved in 90, 61, 72.2 and 95.2 percent of patients. A statistically significant fall in DBP was observed at 5 minutes with all regimens except CAP which was at 15 minutes. Mild side effects observed were palpitations and flushing (NIF n = 4), taste disturbances (CAP n = 3), heaviness of head (CAP n = 1) and giddiness (MET n = 2, NIF + MET n = 2). The trial data suggest that hypertensive crisis can be managed, without intensive care facility, with all four regimens; this implies significant cost containment.", 
    "121": "Electrophysiologic investigation was done for ten patients with clinical and ECG criteria for sick sinus syndrome (SSS). Sinus node function was assessed through corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) and sinoatrial conduction time (SACT), before and after autonomic blockade (AB) with propranolol 0.2 mg/kg and atropine 0.04 mg/kg, given intravenously. Four patients having electrophysiologic parameter in normal range before AB were not considered as SSS. In three patients extrinsic sinus node dysfunction (SND) was found, the pathologic values of CSNRT and SACT being normal after AB, and in one patient with sinus bradycardia, the sinus node function was difficult to be appreciated. In two patients only intrinsic SND was found and, in consequence, pacemaker device was implanted.", 
    "122": "The influence of prazosin (1-100 microM), known alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking agent, on the contractility of guinea pig papillary muscle induced by noradrenaline and isoprenaline was studied. In the presence of prazosin (30 microM), the concentration-response curve for isoprenaline, known agonist of beta-adrenoceptor was strongly shifted to the right (about 17-fold). Additionally, the maximum positive inotropic effect of isoprenaline was significantly lower in comparison with that effect obtained without pretreatment with prazosin. The same concentration of prazosin attenuated the positive inotropic action of noradrenaline, known agonist of alpha- and beta 1-adrenoceptor, by about 17-fold, too. However, noradrenaline exerted the same maximum effect before and after pretreatment with prazosin. This findings suggest that prazosin, which is known alpha 1-blocker, can disturb beta-adrenoceptor signalling pathway in the guinea pig heart. The antagonistic effect of prazosin on isoprenaline induced positive inotropic action is nonspecific and uncompetitive. Taking into account the ability of prazosin to be accumulated in the heart muscle, coronary vessels, lung and some other tissue, the relatively high concentration of prazosin (30 microM), which is necessary for aformentioned effect, could be reached. However, further investigations are required to clarify the precise mechanism involved in this phenomenon.", 
    "123": "The stability of atenolol solutions was evaluated under accelerated isothermal degradation conditions at 90 degrees C. A specific and sensitive HPLC method was adopted to study the pH dependence of the stability. The maximum stability of atenolol was achieved at pH 4. The degradation of atenolol followed first-order kinetics at 90 degrees C, pH 4 with k value of 1.1.10(-3) hour-1.", 
    "124": "The effect of a single administration and a 2-week course of obsidan treatment on cardiohemodynamics was studied in patients with an artificial cardiac pacemaker and a fixed rate of electrocardiostimulation. Echocardiography showed that obsidan reduced heart contractility and pump function in patients with an artificial cardiac pacemaker and different types of blood circulation (hyper-, eu-, and hypokinetic). The cardiohemodynamic effects of obsidan were found to be dependent on the initial type of circulation and the features of intracardiac hemodynamics in different modes of cardiac pacing.",

The original algorithm of the choice of the most effective drug or a combination of drugs depending on the initial state of central hemodynamics and coronary venous blood flow is presented.", 
    "126": "There are a number of effective therapies to consider for the patient after myocardial infarction (MI). Careful patient assessment and individualisation of treatment is required for maximum benefit. Key aspects of assessment include consideration of continuing myocardial ischaemia, evaluation of LV function, review of risk factors and patient circumstances relevant to rehabilitation. Thrombolysis for eligible patients and acute aspirin are of proven benefit and the priority is to minimise delay in treatment. Aspirin is indicated long term for all patients. Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and possibly nitrates are also beneficial, but questions remain about optimal timing and combination treatment. Anticoagulants should be considered in selected, high-risk patients. Education-counselling measures should be initiated in hospital and continued with risk-factor modification as part of rehabilitation after discharge. Priority should be given to smoking cessation where applicable, and to reduction of elevated serum cholesterol levels.", 
    "127": "Antiarrhythmic drugs are known to affect depolarization and repolarization time in a different fashion. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of sotalol, flecainide and propafenone on some common (mean QT and QTc, mean JT and JTc), or uncommon (QTc dispersion, T-peak to T-end interval-Tp-Te) electrocardiographic parameters in order to evaluate the effects of these antiarrhythmic drugs on repolarization time. QTc dispersion, defined as the difference between maximum and minimum QTc calculated from the standard 12 ECG leads, and the average Tp-Te interval, reflect regional variation in ventricular repolarization. We have analyzed retrospectively the standard 12-lead electrocardiograms of 28 patients (15 females and 13 males, age 36.11 +/- 16 years, range 11-67 years), recorded in the free-drug state and at the steady state after oral treatment with sotalol (160 mg/ die), flecainide (200 mg/die) and propafenone (450 mg/die). These drugs were prescribed, separately, for the treatment of patients with supraventricular tachycardia without underlying structural heart disease. Sotalol treatment prolongs ventricular repolarization times (QT, p = 0.0001; JT, p = 0.0001 and JTc, p = 0.0001) in an homogeneous fashion, as showed by the significant decrease in QTc dispersion (p = 0.026) and Tp-Te interval (p = 0.011). On the contrary, flecainide treatment is associated with an increase in QTc dispersion (p = 0.039) and Tp-Te interval (p = 0.0001), mean QT (p = 0.0001), QTc (p = 0.0001) and QRS (p = 0.0001), with no significant changes in JT and JTc (NS). Propafenone treatment does not affect repolarization time indexes, affecting only depolarization time as expressed by an increase in QRS (p = 0.046).", 
    "128": "In the present study, hyperglycaemia was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg). Treatment with glibenclamide (GB) in a dose of 0.45 or 0.9 mg/kg significantly decreased plasma glucose level in a dose-related manner. Administration of nadolol (ND) in a dose of 5 or 10 mg/kg did not affect plasma glucose level. Combined administration of ND (10 mg/kg) with GB (0.45 or 0.9 mg/kg) potentiated the hypoglycaemic effect of GB, an effect prominent 4 hours post-treatment. In relevance to the effect of ND and GB interactions towards other aspects of carbohydrate metabolism, co-administration of the two drugs [ND (10 mg/kg) + GB (0.9 mg/kg)] failed to alter the increase in plasma insulin level and the decrease in blood pyruvate and lactate levels induced by GB alone. Concerning liver glycogen, concurrent administration of the two drugs showed a synergistic effect upon its content (257%), while it was 186% for GB treatment, and 179% for ND alone compared to the hyperglycaemic control value. The data revealed that ND potentiates the hypoglycaemic effect of GB, so it is very important to consider this potentiation when the usage of the combined drug regimens is recommended.", 
    "129": "Thus bioequivalence between the two products was established by undertaking this study. From table 1 it can be seen that the standard deviation at the various sampling points is high indicating varying absorption rates in individual volunteers, but this was observed in case of both the products. Also, since the study design was complete crossover, this high standard deviation was not due to any study design variable. As celiprolol shows non-linear1 dose related absorption kinetics this high value of standard deviation may be due to the intersubject variation during the absorption process. However all the pharmacokinetic parameters showed a comparable profile when statistically evaluated for any significant difference between the two products.", 
    "130": "The authors consider that failures in the treatment of phantom pain syndrome (PPS) are explained by the lack of individual approach to the clinical manifestations of the syndrome. Three main clinical forms of PPS are distinguished using McGillow's questionnaire: causalgic, neuralgic, and spastic. Differentiated therapy for each form is proposed: combinations of amitriptyline, propranolol, and phenazepam for the first form, carbamazepine, propranolol, and phenazepam for the second, and tizanidine monotherapy for the third form. The efficacy of such therapy is approximately 75.2%, incidence of relapses during a year's follow up 12.4%.", 
    "131": "The authors assessed the effects of a single instillation and prolonged use of pilocarpine, thymolol maleate, fotyl, and fotyl-forte on the ophthalmic tone and some ocular functions in 118 patients (202 eyes) with glaucoma. The duration of pilocarpine effect is 6-8 h, that of thymolol maleate, fotyl, and fotyl-forte more than 24 h. The most expressed reduction of intraocular pressure was observed after fotyl and fotyl-forte (32-40% of initial level). Moreover, these agents showed the highest hypotensive activity upon prolonged (up to 6 months) use. Intraocular pressure normalized in about 70% patients. The hypotensive effect of fotyl-forte is somewhat higher than that of fotyl, but patients complain of pain after instillation of fotyl-forte 2-3 times more frequently than after fotyl.", 
    "132": "Effects of some drugs on different levels of phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) of human peripheral blood were studied in vitro. The drugs were found to regulate the phagocytic activity of PMNL. This effect depended on the initial level of PMNL phagocytic activity but not on the drug appurtenance to a certain pharmacological group.", 
    "133": "Diabetes-mellitus was induced in rats by single intravenous injection of (45 mg/kg) streptozotocin (STZ). STZ diabetic rats showed hypertension, decreased cardiac functions, cardiomyopathy and hypercholesterolemia observed at the end of six weeks. Chronic treatment with atenolol (10 mg/kg) for six weeks in the diabetic rats reduced the elevated blood pressure, but failed to prevent STZ induced other complications. Chronic treatment with prazosin (1 mg/kg, po) in the diabetic rats, reduced the elevated blood pressure and also partially prevented hypercholesterolemia, cardiac dysfunctions and in particular the cardiomyopathy. The results suggest that prazosin may be a better option as compared to atenolol in hypertension when it is associated with diabetes mellitus.", 
    "134": "The paper is concerned with formulation studies of the transdermal therapeutic system of the matrix type with beta-adrenolytic drug metoprolol. The base of the hydrophobic matrix is the biocompatible polymer-silicone rubber, and the hydrophilic matrix was prepared from the polyacrylate polymer of the Eudragit type. The properties of the silicone matrix were modified by the additive Methocel F 4M, macrogol 600, copolymer p (HEMA) with methacrylic acid and polyacrylamide. The matrices were evaluated on the basis of the results of in vitro liberation of the drug at 32 degrees C. The liberation profiles of metoprolol were evaluated by means of the parameters of Tornquist hyperbolic function calculated by nonlinear regression. Of the composite ingredients of the silicone matrix, Methocel F 4M proved to be the best. Metoprolol was released most from the hydrophilic matrix prepared from Eudragit NE 30D. It released 12.32 mg.cm(-2).24 h-1 of metoprolol.", 
    "135": "Recent studies in the non-ischaemic myocardium indicated that drugs stimulating cAMP formation inhibit alpha 1-mediated inositol phosphate generation, while alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation lowered tissue cAMP levels, implicating cross-talk between alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic signalling pathways in normal physiological conditions. Massive amounts of endogenous catecholamines, predominantly noradrenaline, are released during myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion, causing stimulation of both alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors which, in turn, may contribute to intracellular Ca2+ overload and subsequent cell damage. Since no information is available regarding cross-talk in pathophysiological conditions, the aim of this study was to evaluate the interactions between alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic signalling pathways during different periods of ischaemia and reperfusion. Isolated rat hearts were perfused retrogradely for 30 min before being subjected to (i) 5-25 min global ischaemia and (ii) 1-5 min of reperfusion after 20 min global ischaemia. Drugs (prazosin, 10(-7) M; propranolol, 10(-6) M; phenylephrine 3 x 10(-5) M; isoproterenol 10(-9) M) were added 10 min before the onset of ischaemia and were present during reperfusion. Increasing periods of ischaemia caused an immediate rise and progressive lowering in tissue cAMP and Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels respectively. In contrast, reperfusion caused an elevation in Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels and reduced cAMP. Prazosin elevated cAMP levels during both ischaemia and reperfusion, while propranolol had no effects on tissue Ins(1,4,5)P3. The activity of the alpha 1-adrenergic signal transduction pathway appears to have an inhibitory effect on the activity of the beta-adrenergic system during ischaemia and reperfusion.", 
    "136": "The capacity of the oxidative pentose pathway (PPP) in the heart is limited, since the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), the first and regulating enzyme of this pathway, is very low. Two mechanisms are involved in the regulation of this pathway. Under normal conditions, G-6-PD is inhibited by NADPH. This can be overcome in the isolated perfused rat heart by increasing the oxidized glutathione and by elevating the NADP+/NADPH ratio. Besides this rapid control mechanism, there is a long-term regulation which involves the synthesis of G-6-PD. The activity of G-6-PD was elevated in the rat heart during the development of cardiac hypertrophy due to constriction of the abdominal aorta and in the non-ischemic part of the rat heart subsequent to myocardial infarction. The catecholamines isoproterenol and norepinephrine stimulated the activity of myocardial G-6-PD in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The isoproterenol-induced stimulation was cAMP-dependent and due to increased new synthesis of enzyme protein. The G-6-PD mRNA was elevated by norepinephrine. As a consequence of the stimulation of the oxidative PPP, the available pool of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) was expanded. PRPP is an important precursor substrate for purine and pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis. The limiting step in the oxidative PPP, the G-6-PD reaction, can be bypassed with ribose. This leads to an elevation of the cardiac PRPP pool. The decline in ATP that is induced in many pathophysiological conditions was attenuated or even entirely prevented by i.v. infusion of ribose. In two in vivo rat models, the overloaded and catecholamine-stimulated heart and the infarcted heart, the normalization of the cardiac adenine nucleotide pool by ribose was accompanied by an improvement of global heart function. Combination of ribose with adenine or inosine in isoproterenol-treated rats was more effective to restore completely the cardiac ATP level within a short period of time than either intervention alone."
