    "0": "In order to characterize the beta-adrenoceptor subtype of the venous vessel wall, venous occlusion plethysmograph studies were carried out in 7 healthy volunteers. Venous distensibility (VD) was considered to be a measure of venous tone. Infusion of the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol (I), of the predominantly beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist fenoterol (F) and of the predominantly beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist dobutamine (D) in increasing doses led to a significant increase in VD by I and F but not by D. Administration of the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists betaxolol (B) and metoprolol (M) did not significantly change VD. Neither beta-adrenoceptor antagonist prevented the increase in VD provoked by subsequent administration of I or F. It is concluded that beta-adrenoceptors in the venous vessel wall belong to the beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype.", 
    "1": "The risk of cardiovascular and fatal complications and the antihypertensive effect of a clonidine-beta-blocker combination was studied in 98 patients and was compared with the results for a group of patients treated with other antihypertensive regimens. The profile of complications was similar in the two groups for a total follow-up period of more than 2000 treatment-months. Clonidine in combination either with propranolol or atenolol had a distinct antihypertensive effect. However, clonidine plus atenolol resulted in a more immediate and pronounced fall in blood pressure. It is concluded that the combination of clonidine and a beta-blocker is an effective antihypertensive medication, and that patients treated with it are apparently at no greater risk of serious cardiovascular incidents than are those treated with other regimens.", 
    "2": "In a double-blind, randomized study, the long-term effects of timolol and placebo on FEV1, PEFR, FVC, VC, respiratory rate and heart rate were compared in 32 patients surviving acute myocardial infarction, 17 on timolol and 15 on placebo. The patients were assessed before and after 1, 3 and 6 months of medication, and then every 6 months for up to 2 years; the mean observation period was 17.4 months. Timolol decreased FEV1 significantly (9-17%) throughout the study. PEFR and FVC fell by 4-13% and 9-11%, respectively, on timolol; the reductions were significant at 3, 6 and 24 months, and at 1, 3 and 6 months, respectively. VC showed only small changes and respiratory rate did not change. In only one patient were the changes in pulmonary function of clinical relevance. Thus, significant, persisting airways dysfunction was induced by long-term beta-adrenergic blockade in patients surviving myocardial infarction.", 
    "3": "The beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties and pharmacokinetics of bucindolol 150 mg were compared to those of propranolol 80 mg and a placebo in a double-blind trial in 6 healthy volunteers. Heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at rest and during vigorous exercise, and plasma renin activity (PRA) at rest, were measured before and at intervals up to 24 h after oral administration of the drugs. Bucindolol reduced exercise tachycardia and decreased exercise PEFR, thus behaving as a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug. In contrast to propranolol, bucindolol did not reduce resting HR and PRA, probably because of its intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. It decreased resting DBP in relation to its peripheral vasodilator properties. The effects of bucindolol developed as early as 30 min after administration and lasted up to 24 h, whereas its Tmax and T 1/2 were 1.6 and 3.6 h respectively. Comparison of the time courses of plasma bucindolol and the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade strongly suggests that in man bucindolol undergoes an extensive first-pass effect, leading to the formation of one or more active metabolites.",

    "5": "24 hypertensive patients, who were not satisfactorily controlled (diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg) with beta-blockers alone were randomised to 2 treatment groups where felodipine was administered for 2 weeks in a total daily dose of 15 mg divided in 2 or 3 doses. Following a 2-week placebo washout period, the patients were switched to the alternative dose regimen in a double-blind crossover manner. Blood pressure was measured with standard techniques and was also non-invasively monitored for 24 hours at the end of each dose regimen period and at the end of the intermediate placebo period. Mean arterial blood pressure at the end of the placebo run-in period was 169/105 mm Hg. Felodipine 5 mg thrice daily reduced blood pressure by 20/9 mm Hg and felodipine 7.5 mg twice daily by 17/9 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). The difference between the 2 dose regimens was not statistically significant. When 24-hour blood pressure measurements for the 2 dose regimens were compared, there were no statistically significant differences. Both regimens reduced the 24-hour blood pressure significantly compared with placebo. Two patients were withdrawn during the study, 1 before felodipine treatment started and the other due to diarrhoea and flushing related to felodipine. Otherwise felodipine was generally well tolerated.", 
    "6": "Felodipine, a new dihydropyridine, was given to 58 hypertensive patients in combination with an adrenergic beta-receptor antagonist and a diuretic agent. In all but 2 patients the blood pressure was unsatisfactorily controlled on standard triple therapy, i.e. alpha beta-blocker, a diuretic and a vasodilator. A 48-week follow-up was completed by 54 patients. After an initial dose titration period, the maintenance dose of felodipine was 5 mg twice daily in 14 patients and 10 mg twice daily in 34 patients. In the remaining 6 patients, the dose ranged from 5 mg every morning to 25 mg twice daily. The dosages of beta-blocking agent and diuretic were considerably reduced during the study period. Mean supine blood pressure was reduced from 170/101 mm Hg on triple therapy before felodipine to 145/86 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) after 2 weeks on felodipine. This improvement was sustained throughout the study and was measured at 144/86 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) after 48 weeks. There was no increase in resting heart rate and no orthostatic fall in blood pressure. Bodyweight was not increased and felodipine was generally well tolerated. Three patients were withdrawn owing to side effects and 1 was socially non-compliant. It is concluded that felodipine is a potent and well tolerated vasodilator, and will be useful in the long term combination treatment of previously refractory hypertension.", 
    "7": "The effects of felodipine and placebo on blood pressure, heart rate and tolerability were investigated in 4 different groups of patients. One group had not received previous therapy, whereas the other 3 groups received concomitant antihypertensive compounds (beta-blockers, diuretics or beta-blocker + diuretics). The haemodynamic effects and tolerability were studied after a single dose, as well as during steady-state conditions. After a single dose of felodipine there was a rapid and significant decrease in blood pressure and increase in heart rate with felodipine alone as well as with combination therapy. During long term treatment, blood pressure was significantly decreased after felodipine during the dosing interval (12h), irrespective of concomitant treatment. Heart rate, however, was not increased, even in patients without a beta-blocker. The reduction in blood pressure was correlated with the plasma concentration of felodipine after single-dose administration, but not during long term treatment. Felodipine was generally well tolerated. In the short term, headache was the most common side effect, while swelling of the ankles was the most frequent adverse effect during long term treatment. In conclusion, felodipine is a promising antihypertensive compound, which may be used in the treatment of high blood pressure, either alone or in combination with other agents.", 
    "8": "2-[4-[3-(tert-Butylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy] phenyl]-3-methyl-6-methoxy-4(3H)-quinazolinone (+/-)HX-CH 44 BS) is a new beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist. Affinity for beta 1-adrenoceptors was determined in isolated guinea-pig papillary muscle (pA2 = 7.4), in isoprenaline-stimulated guinea-pig cardiac adenylate cyclase (pA2 = 7.3) and in receptor binding experiments with rat heart membranes (pKi = 8.0). Due to a direct relaxing action of (+/-)HX-CH 44 in smooth muscles its beta 2-affinity could only be estimated from receptor binding experiments (pKi = 5.0). (+/-)HX-CH 44 BS shows an extremely high beta 1/beta 2-affinity ratio of about 800 and therefore appears to be much more selective than atenolol or metoprolol (beta 1/beta 2 = 10-50). In contrast to propranolol or atenolol, (+/-)HX-CH 44 hardly antagonized bronchodilation induced by i.v. isoproterenol in anaesthetized guinea-pigs in vivo. Furthermore, cardiac actions of the beta 1-selective agonist norepinephrine in cats in vivo were competitively antagonized by (+/-)HX-CH 44 whereas inotropic and chronotropic effects of the non-selective beta-agonist epinephrine were not. This phenomenon may be explained by the mixed population of beta 1-and beta 2-adrenoceptors in cat heart and by the high beta 1-selectivity of (+/-)HX-CH 44.", 
    "9": "Koe 3290 (N-[3-cyano-4-[3-[(1, 1-dimethyl-2-propynyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy] phenyl]-2-methyl-propionamide), Koe 4299 (N-[3-cyano-4-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl]-hexanamide+ ++ hydrochloride), Koe 4302 (N-[3-cyano-4-[3-[(1, 1-dimethyl-2-propynyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]phenyl]-hexanamid e hydrochloride) and the well-known compounds propranolol, bunitrolol, atenolol and acebutolol inhibit isoprenaline-stimulated increase of the concentration of free fatty acids (FFA) in the plasma of rats and dogs. In rats, most of the cardioselective blockers (Koe 3290, Koe 4299, Koe 4302, acebutolol) diminish isoprenaline-stimulated lactate, after s.c. injection, in a dose range higher than that required to reduce FFA. With the exception of atenolol, these substances show a relative selectivity between antilipolytic and antiglycolytic activity in favour of the antilipolytic effect. The non-cardioselective substances, propranolol and bunitrolol, either do not or only slightly differentiate between the inhibition of FFA and that of lactate. In dogs, after i.v. injection, only Koe 3290 and acebutolol have a relative metabolic selectivity similar to that seen in rats, but the other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, with and without cardioselectivity, do not differentiate between the inhibition of isoprenaline-stimulated FFA, and that of lactate and glucose. In contrast, a greater antiglycolytic effect is often seen. Interspecies differences between the rat and the dog and variations among the drugs tested are discussed in detail. Koe 3290 is the only highly cardioselective drug with marked antilipolytic activity which markedly differentiates, in both rats and dogs, between the inhibition of FFA and carbohydrates. This substance, therefore, would appear to offer some additional advantages in the therapy of myocardial ischemia.", 
    "10": "The effects of 3-(4-(2-hydroxy-3-((1, 1-dimethylethyl)-amino)-propoxy)-phenyl)-7-methoxy-2-methyl-1 (2H)-isoquinolinone (HI-42), a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with a long duration of action in vivo, on 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) binding of partially purified rat cardiac membranes were investigated. In vitro, HI-42 displaced 3H-DHA from specific binding sites on the membranes in a non-competitive, reversible manner, yielding Ki-values of 43 and 1626 nmol/l for beta 1- and beta 2-receptors, respectively. After pretreatment in vivo with a single dose of 40 mg/kg HI-42 i.p., the apparent number of beta-adrenoceptors (Bmax of specific 3H-DHA binding) was significantly reduced for up to 4 days, whereas the affinity of the 3H-DHA binding sites (KD) remained unaffected. Similarly as in the in-vitro experiments, the beta-adrenoceptor blocking compound could be removed also after in-vivo pretreatment by extensive washing of the membranes. It is proposed that the long duration of action of HI-42 in vivo is due to the formation of a tight complex with beta 1-adrenoceptors; the bulky lipophilic part of the HI-42 molecule may be responsible for its slow dissociation from the receptor.", 
    "11": "The clinical effects of a single dose of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) lasts longer than the respective half-lives in plasma will suggest. This apparent discrepancy is easily explained by a superimposition of the function of plasma concentration kinetics and the function for competitive antagonism at beta-adrenoceptors according to the law of mass action. By taking data from literature as well as those from receptor binding studies and clinical investigations from our laboratories this model was confirmed. Furthermore it can be stated: The plasma concentrations of beta-blockers are representative for the drug concentration at the beta-adrenoceptor in human. \"Tight\" receptor binding is not the reason for the prolonged effects, but rather the relation between drug concentration and the resp. EC50-value at the respective time of measurement. The extent of antagonism of beta-blockers in vivo can be predicted from ligand binding studies in vitro. Using the time-concentration profile in plasma in addition, the time course of clinical effects can be delineated. This holds true for the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol as well as atenolol, which shows selectively higher affinity at the beta 1-subpopulation. Deviations from the model suggested for the correlation between plasma concentration kinetics, time course of clinical effects and interaction between drug and receptor for beta-blockers may be indicative of additional compartments, active metabolites, partial agonist activity, counterregulatory processes, adaptive mechanisms and must be verified if taken for modelling. In general, any drug acting on the basis of the law of mass action should obey to the described relation between the time course of plasma concentrations and clinical effect (e.g. cardiac glycosides).", 
    "12": "The haemodynamic effects of induction of anaesthesia with diazepam (group D) and Althesin (group A) were studied in 25 coronary patients under betablockers with good myocardial function. Haemodynamic variables monitored were vascular pressures, cardiac output and systolic time intervals. The effects of both drugs were observed when used alone (time I) and in combination with fentanyl, pancuronium and nitrous oxide (time II). The results seemed to show that Althesin (12.51% fall in SI and 10.79% increase in PEP/LVET) depressed myocardial function more than diazepam (no significant difference), but the introduction of fentanyl, pancuronium and nitrous oxide removed the differences between the drugs as to their effect on myocardial performance. These drugs added a depressant effect to diazepam (13.83% fall in SI and 15.77% increase in PEP/LVET) without increasing Althesin's negative inotropic effect. However, in group A at time II, the pulmonary arterial pressure, the wedge pressure and the pulmonary vascular resistance were significantly reduced, while they remained stable in the diazepam group.", 
    "13": "Noradrenaline (NA) administered systemically or into the lateral cerebral ventricle (ICV) in appropriate doses increased heat production and colonic temperature in 1-12 day-old guinea pigs. The effect of systemically applied NA could be blocked by systemically applied beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, while beta-blockers administered centrally or alpha-adrenergic blockers injected systemically or centrally had no effect on the action of systemically applied NA. Accordingly, the effect of systemically applied NA was mediated by peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors. The effect of centrally applied NA was blocked by alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists applied into the lateral cerebral ventricle and attenuated by systemically applied phentolamine, but not by phenoxybenzamine or ergotamine. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents applied either ICV or systemically had no effect on the action of centrally applied NA. It is concluded that ICV applied NA acts through central alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "14": "These recommendations for secondary prevention of clinical coronary cardiopathy are the result of a symposium attended by 46 experts belonging to the councils on arteriosclerosis, clinical cardiology, epidemiology, and prevention and rehabilitation of the International Society and Federation of Cardiology. Secondary prevention of coronary cardiopathy refers to measures designed to prevent deterioration or death in patients with clinical manifestations of coronary cardiopathy. Such measures in addition to drugs include health actions that may improve the status of various coronary risk factors: the patient's life style should stress maintenance of proper weight, regular physical exercise, reduction of saturated fats and cholesterol in the diet, and elimination of smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. It is considered reasonable to control hypertension through the most innocuous means possible, but findings of the few existing controlled studies of effects of treatment of hypertension in coronary cardiopathy are complex. Drug treatment may be necessary for most patients, but nondrug measures should be added when possible. Various proofs including results of some controlled studies justify the recommendations for reducing elevated levels of serum cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol through dietary measures. Optimum plasma cholesterol levels are 5.2 mmol/1 or less, and the upper limit is 5.7 mmol/1. The rules for secondary prevention are the same for diabetics as for nondiabetics, but some special precautions are necessary in diabetics. Habitual and vigorous physical activity has been associated with a decline in the incidence of coronary cardiopathy in different population studies, although there has been no demonstration that exercise can alter the progression of atherosclerosis or improve collateral circulation. Stress should be recognized as a risk factor and included in secondary prevention, but the concept that stress is the key risk factor in coronary events is in conflict with a large body of scientific evidence. Oral contraceptives (OCs) tend to increase boood pressure and weight as well as serum triglyceride levels, and to reduce glucose tolerance and high density lipoprotein cholesterol in some formulations. OCs also affect the integrity of the vascular endothelium and alter blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet function. These thrombogenic changes are intensified with age, especially after 35, and with smoking. OCs are innocuous in women under 35 with no history of venous or arterial disease or pulmonary embolism and who have normal blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels. Patients using OCs should control their blood pressure and weight and be alert to any symptoms of thrombotic episodes. The risk/benefit ratio of longterm estrogen treatment in meno- and postmenopausal women with coronary cardiopathy has not yet been established. Apart from 1 study in primates, there is no evidence that vasectomy should be considered either indicated or contraindicated for coronary patients. Beta blockers, platelet function inhibitors, anticoagulants, and other drugs are under active study for secondary prevention of coronary cardiopathy.", 
    "15": "Specific beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic agonists and antagonists were studied for their effects on aqueous humor dynamics in a cat model. Tazolol (beta 1-agonist) reduced formation of aqueous humor more than outflow, while metoprolol (beta 1-antagonist) reduced outflow more than formation. Both salbutamol (beta 2-agonist) and butoxamine (beta 2-antagonist) inhibited aqueous humor formation and aqueous humor outflow to an equal extent. It is concluded that the adrenergic mechanism is functioning only slightly, if at all, in affecting the intraocular pressure. On the other hand, receptor binding experiments on iris-ciliary body showed clearly that there are 40-fold and 281-fold differences in binding affinity of D- and L-isomers of timolol and propranolol, respectively. These results indicate that the adrenergic receptor mechanism does exist in the eye tissues but that it does not control intraocular pressure significantly.", 
    "16": "The left coronary artery of rats was ligated either permanently, or for a period of 40 or 60 min, with subsequent reperfusion. In experiments with permanent occlusion, the hearts were removed and investigated 5 h after the coronary ligation, or immediately after death in animals which died earlier. The hearts from the reperfusion experiments were investigated 60 min after reopening the occluded artery. The extent of the ischaemic and necrotic areas of the hearts was determined. A quantitative photometric method was developed for this purpose, using \"negative staining\" with Evans blue for the ischaemic area, and \"negative staining\" with triphenyltetrazolium chloride for the necrotic area. In experiments in which ligation was permanent, the percentage of the ischaemic area which underwent necrosis increased with the time after coronary occlusion. In reperfusion experiments, myocardial necrosis was detected earlier than in experiments with permanent coronary ligation. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents pindolol, propranolol, and metoprolol significantly decreased the percentage of necrosis in experiments with permanent ligation of the coronary artery. The most selective of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers, i.e. metoprolol was tested in the reperfusion experiments. In these experiments, the amount of necrosis was also significantly decreased.", 
    "17": "A potent irreversible beta-adrenergic derivative of pindolol possessing a chemically reactive group (Br-AAM-pindolol) was synthesized. This compound devoid of agonist properties, competed for all (3H)-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) binding sites in C6 glioma cell and rat cerebellum membranes. Pretreatment of C6 glioma cell membranes with Br-AAM-pindolol and subsequent washing resulted in a time- and dose-dependent blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors. A 50% blockade was achieved in the presence of 1.6 nM Br-AAM-pindolol. This blockade occurs specifically at the beta-adrenergic receptor level, as: 1) it induced a decrease of maximal isoproterenol stimulated adenylate cyclase activity with no modification of basal and sodium fluoride stimulated activity and 2) decreases of (3H)-DHA binding and stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by the agonist were suppressed in the presence of isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist. Furthermore, Br-AAM-pindolol treatment did not affect (3H)-diazepam binding in C6 glioma cell membranes. Pretreatment of C6 glioma cells with Br-AAM-pindolol also reduced the response of adenylate cyclase to isoproterenol and the number of beta-adrenergic receptors. The blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors of C6 glioma cells by Br-AAM-pindolol was non-competitive, whereas the blockade obtained with AM-pindolol, a derivative of pindolol devoid of alkylating properties, was competitive. The irreversible blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors by Br-AAM-pindolol in rat erythrocyte membranes was substantiated by the demonstration that no recovery of beta-adrenergic receptors occurred during long term incubation of the membranes (48 h) following Br-AAM-pindolol treatment and subsequent washing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "The authors offer a scheme of optimizing hypotensive treatment, which combines subjective, objective (the hemodynamics) and social (ability to work) characteristics. It was shown that the criteria of the adequacy and efficacy of hypotensive treatment should include the intensity of the cerebral blood flow and the level of blood pressure in addition to the coefficient of information processing, and an increase in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The use of the offered scheme of optimization in 80 patients with essential hypertension made it possible to cut down the period of hospitalization and improve the efficacy of treatment.", 
    "19": "The mechanism of release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla of neonatal rats was examined, together with the role of these amines in the ability of the organism to withstand acute O2 deprivation. Splanchnic innervation of the rat adrenal is non-functional until the end of the first postnatal week. Nevertheless, hypoxia caused depletion of adrenal catecholamines in 1-day-old rats as well as in 8-day-old animals. Pre-treatment with cholinergic receptor blocking agents did not prevent the catecholamine response at 1 day but did in older animals; these results indicate that the depletion mechanism is not neurogenic in 1-day-old animals but is neurogenic in 8-day-old animals. The proportions of noradrenaline and adrenaline released by hypoxic stress also differed at the two ages, with preferential release of adrenaline by the neurogenic mechanism but not by the non-neurogenic one. The ontogenetic replacement of non-neurogenic adrenomedullary responses by the neurogenic mechanism was directly related to the onset of splanchnic nerve function. Treatments which accelerated the development of neuronal connexions (neonatal hyperthyroidism, maternal stress) caused premature loss of the non-neurogenic response. Prior to the development of sympathetic nerve function, adrenal catecholamines plays a predominant role in enabling the neonate to survive hypoxia. Interference with the release of adrenal amines invariably increased mortality during hypoxia. In contrast, interference with sympathetic neural release of catecholamines did not affect the ability of 1-day-old rats to withstand hypoxia, indicating that survival during low PO2 conditions is not dependent on the sympathetic innervation at that stage of development. After functional development of the sympathetic nerves and disappearance of non-neurogenic adrenomedullary responses, the neonatal rats became partially dependent upon catecholamines derived from sympathetic terminals; administration of bretylium at 8 days significantly compromised survival during hypoxia. Interference with adrenergic receptor function also interfered with the ability of neonatal rats to withstand low PO2. At 1 day of age, either phenoxybenzamine or ICI-118551, but not atenolol, shortened the survival time during hypoxia. At 8 days, only phenoxybenzamine did so.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "20": "Metipranolol (Betamann) is a clinically efficacious ocular hypotensive drug and preclinical experiments were undertaken to characterize this beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. In vitro beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonism was evaluated using the guinea pig atrium and the rat uterus, respectively. The respective pA2 values were 8.3 and 8.4. Topical metipranolol, 0.3% and 0.6%, blocked both the hypotension (beta2-mediated) and the tachycardia (beta1-mediated) elicited in ganglion-blocked, conscious rabbits by isoproterenol, 0.5 microgram/kg, i.v. The Ki for displacement of 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding to rabbit iris + ciliary body homogenates was 34 nM. The effect of metipranolol, 0.3% and 0.6%, was not particularly striking on the intraocular pressure (IOP) of conscious, normotensive rabbits. However, the elevated IOP of the alpha-chymotrypsinized rabbit eye was significantly decreased (maximum reduction of 5.8 mm Hg) following the instillation of metipranolol, 0.3%. IOP recovery in conscious rabbits following hyperosmotic challenge (i.v. infusion of a 20% NaCl solution) was not decreased by a 1-h pretreatment with a 0.3% solution. In contrast, a significant reduction of 41% was elicited by a 0.6% solution. Hence, the ocular hypotensive effect of metipranolol may result from decreased aqueous humor inflow. Metipranolol, 0.6%, was devoid of effect on rabbit pupil diameter. However, corneal local anesthesia was elicited in the rabbit by both 0.3% and 0.6% solutions of the drug, the effect being more marked with the higher concentration.", 
    "21": "The in vivo effect of nicotine bitartrate on mucociliary (mc) activity in the rabbit maxillary sinus was investigated. An animal model was used, which permitted administration of drugs directly into the artery feeding the sinus and simultaneous recording of changes in the mc activity. When nicotine was given ia (0.5-10.0 micrograms/kg) it resulted in a brief (1 min at most) acceleration of the mc wave frequency. The response was dose-dependent and a maximum increase of 34.9% was recorded at a dose of 10.0 micrograms/kg. The response was inhibited by a preceding injection of the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium (0.2 mg/kg) or the cholinergic antagonist atropine (0.2 mg/kg). The alpha and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists phentolamine (0.2 mg/kg) and propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) did not influence the response to nicotine injection. It is concluded that the acceleration of mc wave frequency after nicotine administration is probably mediated via stimulation of nicotinic receptors on postganglionic parasympathetic nerve cells.", 
    "22": "In uveal vessels of isolated arterially perfused rabbit eyes there is direct evidence for the presence of post-junctional alpha 1-receptors and indirect evidence for alpha 2-receptors. Since vasoconstriction by epinephrine could not be blocked by an alpha 1-antagonist, only 30% by an alpha 2-antagonist and almost fully by the combination or by phentolamine, we suggest the presence of an intermediate alpha-type receptor which is neither alpha 1 nor alpha 2 but has characteristics of either. All alpha-types produce vasoconstriction and a fall in IOP. Of the beta-types only beta 1-receptors can be demonstrated. They mediate vasodilatation and a rise in IOP. Neither beta 2- nor non-selective beta-agonists or -antagonists (e.g. timolol) affect IOP or uveal flow.",

    "24": "A marked increase in the coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality of working-age men and women occurred in Finland from the 1950s until the 1960s. Around the year 1970, CHD mortality started to decline and this decline still continues. In the age group 35-64 years the average annual decline of CHD mortality in the 1970s was 1.8% for men and 3.4% for women. Limited data available on trends in CHD morbidity show that the decline in CHD mortality is accompanied by a decline in the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction. CHD mortality and incidence are higher in east Finland than in west Finland and this east-west difference has so far persisted during the declining trend. The decline in CHD mortality and incidence in the 1970s has been preceded and paralleled by changes into favourable direction in dietary fat consumption and population mean levels for serum cholesterol, prevalence of smoking among adult Finnish men, control of hypertension by antihypertensive drug therapy, and management of patients with symptomatic CHD. Both the changes in life-styles and CHD risk factor levels, as well as changes in the management of patients with CHD, appear to have been contributing to the decline in CHD mortality and incidence in Finland.", 
    "25": "Relaxant responses to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, procaterol, have been examined on preparations of guinea-pig pulmonary artery (beta 2-adrenoceptors only), rat and rabbit pulmonary artery and rat aorta (beta 2 greater than beta 1), and these responses have been compared with responses of dog left circumflex coronary artery (beta 1 only). Low concentrations of procaterol (3 nM to 100 nM) relaxed KC1-contracted preparations of rat aorta and pulmonary artery from rat, rabbit and guinea-pig whereas high concentrations (greater than 1 microM) were required to relax preparations of the dog left circumflex coronary artery. The dissociation constant (KP value) for procaterol on beta 1-adrenoceptors was 4.9 microM (determined on dog coronary artery) and on beta 2-adrenoceptors was 0.008 microM (rabbit pulmonary artery). Procaterol therefore had a beta 2:beta 1 selectivity value of 612. KP values obtained on guinea-pig atria for procaterol, on which the concentration-response curve was biphasic, confirmed that both beta 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptors mediate responses of this tissue. The KP values were 0.009 microM (data from the first phase of the control concentration-response curve) and 3.5 microM (data from the concentration-response curve in the presence of the beta 2-selective antagonist, ICI 118,551, 10 nM). Data obtained on rat atria indicated that chronotropic responses of preparations from some rats, but not others, involved a minor population of beta 2-adrenoceptors, but the beta 2-adrenoceptors, when present, were less important than in guinea-pig atria. 6 Procaterol appears to be a particularly useful drug for detecting a functional population of beta 2-adrenoceptors in tissues, whether they are the minor or the predominant receptor sub-type present.", 
    "26": "Intravenous loading with 500 ml of 2.7% saline increased the clearance of PAH and inulin and urine sodium excretion in 14 healthy subjects. Intravenous propranolol (0.075 and 0.15 mg/kg) did not alter PAH or inulin clearance at rest but abolished the increase expected during saline infusion. There was no consistent effect on urinary sodium excretion. Intravenous nadolol (0.05 and 0.75 mg/kg) reduced resting PAH and inulin clearances by up to 25%. Both clearances fell significantly during saline infusion but natriuresis was not significantly reduced in spite of the changes in renal function. There was no evidence from these studies in normal volunteers that nadolol confers any advantages over propranolol in its effects on renal function.", 
    "27": "The effect of oral doses of the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (50 mg), the non-selective antagonist propranolol (40 mg) and placebo was investigated during exercise in a crossover comparison in six healthy but untrained subjects. Descriptors of ventilation, respiratory gas exchange, and arterialized blood lactate and glucose were obtained during steady state bicycle ergometric exercise at 20% and 60% of the subjects' previously determined maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max). At these work intensities, the previously reported increase of respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade was found to be trivial (placebo = 0.96 +/- 0.03 s.e. mean; propranolol = 0.97 +/- 0.01; atenolol = 0.97 +/- 0.04; 60% VO2 max, 10 min exercise) and only present during the early minutes of effort. Oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production did not differ between treatments. Both drugs produced highly significant falls in peak expiratory flow (PEF) rates and tidal volume (VT) which were compensated by an increase in respiratory rate. PEF, 60% VO2 max: placebo = 3.8 +/- 0.3 l/s; propranolol 3.6 +/- 0.3 l/s (P less than 0.03); atenolol 3.1 +/- 0.3 l/s (P less than 0.01). VT, 60% VO2 max: placebo 2.0 +/- 0.1 l; propranolol 1.8 +/- 0.21 (P less than 0.05); atenolol 1.7 +/- 0.1 1 (P less than 0.01). Arterialized lactate was significantly elevated during work at 20% and 60% VO2 max, but rose progressively at the 60% VO2 max load. Ventilation, oxygen uptake and ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide also rose progressively at this workload. Ventilatory equivalent for oxygen showed no significant rise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

There were no significant differences between the two groups with regards to age (53 +/- 10 years for the medical group; 55 +/- 9 years for the surgical group), the length of follow-up (55 +/- 26 vs 61 +/- 28 months), left ventricular end diastolic volumes (87 +/- 27 vs 84 +/- 18 ml/m2) or ejection fraction (62 +/- 8 vs 59 +/- 11 p. 100). There were no deaths in the medical group; two patients developed uncomplicated myocardial infarction 19 days and 7 months after coronary angiography, respectively. 5 patients had recurrent angina and were referred for surgery. This operation of second intention did not pose any special problems. 6 of the 14 patients with stenosis of the LAD before the origin of the first septal artery had complications (infarction in 1 case, recurrent angina in 5 cases). In the surgical group, 1 patient died in the immediate postoperative period, of resistant cardiac arrhythmia; 2 patients developed uncomplicated peroperative myocardial infarction; 21 patients had no complications at all. The surgical patients were heparinised in the immediate postoperative period and anticoagulant therapy was continued with oral vitamin K antagonists for 6 months to 1 year, followed in some cases, by platelet antiaggregant therapy. 20 patients in this group underwent maximal exercise stress testing which was negative in 19 cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

It is evident that endurance sport or training during leisure time can have a greater effect than heavy muscular professional work. The selectively analysed factor \"lack of exercise\" may be less important as a risk factor than the protective influence of endurance training. Directions are given for carrying out a preventive program of training, with contraindications included.", 
    "30": "A simple method to determine the beta-blocker carazolol in swine kidneys is presented. Spiked samples, homogenised under alkaline conditions, were heated. Passage of the ether extracts through C18 and silica Sep-Pak cartridges yielded a fraction containing the carazolol in 88% recovery. In this fraction carazolol was determined by fluorescence spectrophotometry. By this method a level of 1 microgram/kg in spiked samples can be detected. Injection of 10 micrograms/kg body weight, 105 minutes before slaughter, resulted in carazolol contents in kidneys ranging from 11 to 25 micrograms/kg (n = 8).", 
    "31": "Exercise-induced changes in the ST segments of the electrocardiogram were compared with the results of coronary arteriography in 73 consecutive patients referred for preoperative evaluation of coronary artery disease. Eighteen patients had single-, 25 double-, and 30 triple-vessel disease. Thirteen were taking digitalis alone, 28 were taking beta blockers alone, 21 had beta blockers and digitalis and 11 had no cardiac drugs. Exercise induced elevation of the ST segment in 11 patients, all with a predominant lesion in the left anterior descending coronary artery. ST depression with an upsloping ST segment was observed in patients with one-, two-, and three-vessel disease and it was the most common type of ST change in patients with single-vessel disease. Horizontal ST depression was most common in two-vessel disease and downsloping ST segment in three-vessel disease. There was a good correlation between the number of stenosed vessels and ST changes caused by exercise, expressed as the sum of ST segment displacements in twelve leads recorded immediately after the end of exercise (sigma/ST/) or as ST depression per unit increase in heart rate during exercise (\"m\" (ST/HR]. The latter was obtained by linear regression of ST displacement and heart rate measured at three or four different workloads in the lead with the greatest displacement of the ST segment. The mean values of sigma/ST/ were 0.58 +- 0.030 mV in single-vessel, 0.97 +- 0.41 mV in double-vessel and 1.58 +- 0. 46 mV in triple-vessel disease. The mean values of \"m\" (ST/HR) were 0.0024 +- 0.0013 mV X min-1 X beat-1 in single-vessel, 0.0042 +- 0.0012 in double-vessel, and 0.0078 +- 0.0033 in triple-vessel disease. These differences were highly significant (p less than 0.01 - 0.001) and there was only minimal overlap between the single- and triple-vessel groups. Digitalis caused a slight (statistically nonsignificant) increase in sigma/ST/ but not in \"m\" (ST/HR).", 
    "32": "Migraine is considered to be a primarily neurogenic disease. In this common headache syndrome beta-blockers are widely used as prophylactic drugs. In the meantime there is evidence for central beta-receptors. The effect of beta-blockers is considered to be based on a reduction of the increased sympathetic tonus and its influence on the intracerebral vessels. Beta-blockers--such as Atenolol, Metoprolol, Nadolol, Pindolol, Propranolol and Timolol which differ according to their intrinsic activity, their selectiv cardiac effects, their membran stabilizing ability, their hydro- or lipophily as well as according to their plasmaprotein binding capacity are used. Therefore, it is more likely that beta-blockers develop their effect through a stabilisation of the intrasynaptic serotonin-level in the serotonergic neurons of the brainstem.", 
    "33": "By the sequential administration of alpha 1- and alpha 2-blockers it can be shown, in the pithed rabbit, that the dose/pressor response curve to noradrenaline consists of two separate curves, one for each receptor. alpha 2-mediated responses predominate at low doses and alpha 1-mediated responses predominate at high doses. Pressor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation have, similarly, an alpha 2 component at low frequencies and a dominant alpha 1-mediated response at high frequencies: a residual response is resistant to combined alpha 1- plus alpha 2-blockade. This alpha-blocker-resistant pressor nerve response was further analysed in the pithed rat and was found to be partly susceptible to alpha,beta-methylene ATP, which desensitizes purinergic responses. However, reserpine pretreatment produced a greater reduction of nerve-mediated pressor responses than did alpha-blockade, suggesting that part of the 'alpha-blocker resistant' response might be adrenergic. It is concluded that sympathetic vasopressor nerve transmission is mediated for the greater part by alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors but that there is evidence for contributions from non-alpha-adrenergic and 'purinergic' elements. An even greater proportion of the responses to circulating catecholamines is attributable to the alpha-receptors with a relatively small but significant 'resistant' component.", 
    "34": "Ideas about the aetiology and pathology of angina have changed considerably. The \"dynamic\" nature of coronary arteries is now well recognized. Treatment is beginning to respond to these developments. In particular, the old \"medical\" versus \"surgical\" argument is inappropriate--treatment should be tailored to the patient's individual need.", 
    "35": "Regional blood flow distribution (microspheres) and cardiac output (CO, thermal dilution) were measured during the Cushing response in unblocked (UB), beta-receptor-blocked (BB, 2 mg/kg propranolol iv), or alpha-receptor blocked (AB, 0.5 mg/kg + 0.5 mg X kg-1 X min-1 phentolamine iv) chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Intracranial pressure was increased to 150 mmHg by infusion of temperature-controlled artificial cerebrospinal fluid into the cisterna magna. Similar increases in mean arterial pressure were seen in UB and BB, but in AB a Cushing response could not be sustained. In UB, cerebral blood flow (CBF) decreased 50%, coronary blood flow (CoBF) increased 120%, and peripheral tissue blood flow was reduced only in the kidneys (18%) and the intestines (small 22%, large 35%). Blood flow to the other viscera, skin, and skeletal muscle was unchanged. CO (16%) and heart rate (HR, 38%) decreased, and total peripheral resistance (TPR, 68%) and stroke volume (SV, 38%) increased. In BB, CBF decreased 50%, CoBF decreased 20%, and blood flow was reduced 40-80% in all peripheral tissues. CO (69%) and HR (62%) decreased, TPR increased 366%, and SV was unchanged. We conclude that the Cushing response in UB animals combines an alpha-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction with a beta-receptor cardiac stimulation. The beta-mechanism is neither necessary nor sufficient for the hypertension. However, the combination of alpha- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms maintains cardiac output and peripheral tissue blood flow relatively constant while producing a systemic hypertension.", 
    "36": "Functional beta-adrenoceptor populations in the human heart were studied in vitro in electrically-paced strips of the right auricular and ventricular myocardium. The relative potency of selected agonists in producing inotropic responses (Tmax, T'max) in the presence of blockers for neuronal and extraneuronal uptakes was found to be as follows: isoprenaline greater than noradrenaline = adrenaline = salbutamol greater than dobutamine. Prenalterol had a negative inotropic effect in these preparations. The selective beta 1-(practolol) and beta 2-(H 35/25) blockers reduced inotropic responses to adrenaline (Tmax, T'max) and noradrenaline (T'max) in the auricular strips. These results indicate the participation of beta 2-adrenoceptors in inotropic responses in the human auricular and ventricular myocardium. For comparison, inotropic responses of electrically-paced rat myocardium to beta-adrenergic agonists in the presence of blockers for neuronal and extraneuronal uptakes were likewise studied. The relative potencies for Tmax were: noradrenaline = adrenaline greater than prenalterol greater than dobutamine = salbutamol. Given the high relative potency of salbutamol in the human myocardial strips (analogous to that previous shown in the beta 2-dominated atria of the frog and trout) and the low relative potency of salbutamol in the rat tissue, these findings indicate a greater population of functionally active beta 2-adrenoceptors in the human than in the rat myocardium.", 
    "37": "The intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of 100 ng glucagon resulted in more prolonged and pronounced elevations of plasma glucose levels than the intravenous injection of 100 ng glucagon. Insignificant changes in plasma IRI and IRG levels after icv glucagon administration contrasted to marked increases in both IRI and IRG levels after the iv injection. Icv glucagon-induced hyperglycaemia was completely prevented by the prior administration of atropine, phentolamine or hexamethonium, and partially inhibited by bilateral adrenalectomy, but not by propranolol pretreatment. These findings suggested that the hyperglycaemic effect is brought about through cholinergic and alpha-adrenergic neural pathways and partly via the adrenal medulla.", 
    "38": "We studied the acute effects of the inhalation of cigarette smoke on the central and peripheral airways of 35 open-chested and tracheotomized dogs by the direct measurement of central (Rc) and peripheral (Rp) airway resistances. Rc was calculated by dividing the pressure difference between a tracheal catheter and a retrograde catheter by mouth flow, and Rp was obtained by dividing the pressure difference between the retrograde catheter and a pleural capsule by mouth flow. The pleural capsule was attached to the pleural surface for alveolar pressure measurement. Rc and Rp were measured by the 2-Hz forced oscillation method. With lung inhalation of the smoke of two-thirds of one cigarette in vagi intact dogs, Rp increased to 239% of the control value and Rc increased to 112%. After bilateral vagotomy, Rp increased to 143% and Rc increased to 104%. Propranolol did not influence the results. Hexamethonium and atropine both blocked these responses when vagi were intact. When the upper trachea, larynx, and nasopharynx, which were completely blocked by vagotomy, were exposed to the smoke of two-thirds of a cigarette, Rp increased to 155% and Rc increased to 144%. We thus conclude that cigarette smoke causes a major increase in Rp, mainly via the vagal reflex and partially via the stimulation of parasympathetic ganglia (probably nicotine), and a minor increase in Rc via vagal reflex.", 
    "39": "We have recently shown that maintenance of portal hypertension in rats is highly dependent on high portal blood flow. This study attempts to determine whether portal hypertension, induced in the rat by partial constriction of the portal vein, can be reduced by lowering portal blood flow with a beta blocking agent. Portal hypertensive rats treated with propranolol had a reduction in portal blood flow to 0.89 +/- 0.13 ml X min-1 X gm-1 accompanied by reduction in portal pressure to 12.6 +/- 1.00 mm Hg, disproportionately small because of a rise in portal-collateral vascular resistance to 12.52 +/- 1.63 dyne X sec X cm-5 X gm X 10(5) accompanying the portal blood flow reduction. Similarly, portal hypertensive rats receiving beta-blockade with H35-25, an experimental beta-blocker, demonstrated a 49% reduction in portal blood flow accompanied by only a 14% reduction in portal pressure, also disproportionately low because of a complicating 77% rise in portal-collateral vascular resistance. Normal rats were then given saline infusion to achieve similar blood flow elevations to that of portal hypertensive animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "To evaluate the contribution of catecholamines to the fasting-induced lipid mobilization prolonged or acute blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol was applied in dogs during 72 hrs of food withdrawal. Propranolol given orally in a dose of 15 mg twice daily throughout the whole period of fasting failed to modify the increases in the plasma FFA and glycerol concentrations. The acute beta-adrenergic blockade due to i.v. injection of propranolol (0.5 mg/kg b.w.) caused marked decreases in the plasma glycerol concentration both in the dogs fasting for 24 h and 72 hrs, whereas the effects of propranolol on the plasma FFA concentration was found only in the early stage of fasting. Plasma catecholamine concentrations were enhanced significantly by the 72 hrs food withdrawal and neither prolonged nor acute propranolol administration modified significantly this effect. The fasting-induced decreases in the serum insulin concentration were more pronounced in dogs treated with propranolol. Results of this study indicate that catecholamines are involved in the control of lipolysis during short term starvation. However, under these conditions beta-adrenergic blockade did not impair FFA mobilization most probably due to an enhanced contribution of other hormones to the control of this process.", 
    "41": "beta 1- and beta 2-Adrenergic receptors co-exist in the adult rat ventricle. We have employed radioligand binding and cell purification techniques to determine the cellular origin of these receptors. The beta-adrenergic antagonist ligand (+/-)-[125I] iodocyanopindolol binds to 2 X 10(5) receptors per purified adult rat cardiomyocyte, with a dissociation constant of 70 pM. The subtype-selective antagonists betaxolol (beta 1), practolol (beta 1), and zinterol (beta 2) compete for [125I]iodocyanopindolol-binding sites on intact myocytes in monophasic manners with dissociation constants of 46, 845, and 923 nM, respectively. [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding to membranes prepared from nonmyocyte elements of rat ventricle occurs with a dissociation constant of 43 pM and a capacity of 88 fmol/mg membrane protein. Computer analysis of competition of [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding by betaxolol, practolol, and zinterol in nonmyocyte membranes demonstrates biphasic curves that comprise binding to both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors. These data demonstrate that purified adult ventricular myocytes possess only beta 1-receptors, and that the beta 2-receptors found in rat ventricle are located on nonmyocyte cell types.", 
    "42": "A study was made of the changes in the mitotic activity, DNA synthesis, and the number of pathological mitoses after administration of the beta-adrenoblocker propranolol in the corneal and tongue epithelium of white rats kept in pressure chamber for 7 days (4 h daily) at a \"height\" of 9000 meters. The mitotic and the label indices (inclusion of 3H-thymidine by the epithelium nuclei) were analysed for mitotic activity and DNA synthesis, respectively. The experiments showed that the mitotic activity, DNA synthesis, the number of pathological mitoses were stabilized due to the propranolol administration.", 
    "43": "A new class of beta-adrenergic blockers with the pharmacologic property of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) is emerging for use in the treatment of hypertension. These agents decrease blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, while the heart rate and cardiac output at rest are maintained. Beta blockers with ISA may be used in clinical situations where non-ISA beta blockers are relatively contraindicated, such as sinus bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, Raynaud-like symptoms and chronic obstructive lung disease.", 
    "44": "Neuroglucopenia (NGP), which is a serious potential hazard for all insulin-treated diabetics, stimulates many neural and hormonal responses including increased glucagon secretion and activation of beta-adrenergic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. To determine which of these responses is important in recovery from NGP, we induced NGP in baboons by the intravenous (IV) injection of 2-deoxy-D-glucose with and without beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol) and somatostatin. Thirty minutes after the induction of NGP the animals recovered, and the mean (+/- SEM) rise in arterial plasma glucose was 6.6 +/- 0.9 mmol/L, in glycerol 0.106 +/- 0.22 mmol/L, and in beta-hydroxybutyrate 0.091 +/- 0.22 mmol/L. Animal recovery and glucose rise were uninfluenced by the infusion of propranolol (mean 30 minute plasma glucose rise of 6.2 +/- 0.8 mmol/L) and somatostatin (6.8 +/- 0.8 mmol/L). However, the combined infusion of somatostatin and propranolol prevented animal recovery and glucose rise (1.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/L). The glycerol and beta-hydroxybutyrate rises were blocked by the propranolol infusion alone. Thus, recovery from NGP and the associated rise in plasma glucose, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate are prevented by the combination of the suppression of the glucagon and beta-adrenergic response to NGP. Furthermore, if the results of our study are extrapolated to insulin-dependent diabetic patients, most of whom have an impaired glucagon response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia/neuroglucopenia, they would be critically dependent on beta-adrenergic mechanisms for recovery from NGP.", 
    "45": "Prior biochemical studies have suggested that beta adrenergic receptors in the ciliary process are mostly of the beta-2 subtype. The present experiments evaluate a number of beta adrenergic antagonists, including several recently developed drugs, for their ability to block rabbit and human ciliary process and heart beta adrenergic receptors activating adenylate cyclase. Three of these agents (alpha-methylpropranolol, IPS 339 and ICI 118,551) demonstrated a high degree of oculoselectivity in both rabbit and human. The other agents (S 37-429, S 32-468, ICI 78,462,H35/25, butoxamine, propranolol, timolol, atenolol and practolol) showed either modest or no oculoselectivity. Structure-activity studies suggested that, among antagonists of the aryloxymethyl type, methylation of the side-chain alpha-carbon or the aromatic ring may enhance oculoselectivity primarily by decreasing potency at cardiac beta adrenergic receptors. Additional physiological studies of cardiac chronotropic response revealed that, compared with nonselective beta blockers, compounds with biochemical oculoselectivity demonstrate decreased physiological effects on cardiac function. This was true when the selective agents were applied either systemically or topically to the eye. On the other hand, the systemic absorption of topical timolol was sufficient to block cardiac chronotropic effects completely. These findings, identifying relatively specific blockers of rabbit and human ciliary process beta adrenergic receptors, have implications for the development of ocular hypotensive agents with fewer systemic side effects on tissues enriched in beta-1 adrenergic receptors.", 
    "46": "Vascular beta 2-adrenergic blocking effects of the water-soluble drugs atenolol (beta 1-selective) and nadolol (nonselective) were evaluated. Twenty-four healthy young men were studied in three dosing groups (eight subjects per group) before and after 1 wk on placebo, atenolol (50 mg twice a day), or nadolol (40 mg twice a day). Maximal treadmill exercise heart rates were reduced to a similar degree by atenolol (-48 +/- 3 bpm) and nadolol (-48 +/- 4 bpm) but were not affected by placebo. Trough blood levels were 226 +/- 9 ng/ml for atenolol and 43 +/- 9 ng/ml for nadolol. Calf blood flow was measured with a plethysmograph and calf vascular resistance was calculated from blood pressure and flow. beta 2-Adrenergic blockade was determined at rest with epinephrine infused intravenously in graded doses from 0.001 to 0.032 micrograms/kg/min. Mean arterial pressure and calf vascular resistance rose markedly after nadolol but not after atenolol or placebo. Marked bradycardia developed after nadolol, probably by baroreceptor stimulation. Thus at an equivalent, substantial degree of beta 1-adrenergic blockade, nadolol blocks vascular beta 2-adrenergic receptors and atenolol does not. Measurement of the peripheral vascular response to epinephrine infusion is an effective means of assessing the impact of beta-adrenergic blockers on vascular beta 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "47": "This open study of beta blockers in chronic simple glaucoma compared the efficacy of once daily (o.d.) oral nadolol therapy with twice daily (b.d.) topical timolol therapy. Sixty eight patients were randomly assigned to starting doses of either 20, 40, or 80 mg of nadolol o.d. (51 patients) or 0.25% timolol b.d. (17 patients) and were seen at weekly intervals for a four-week (short-term) period. Upward dosage titration (80 mg o.d. maximum, nadolol and 0.5% b.d. maximum, timolol) was permitted if, at any visit, the intraocular pressure (IOP) in either eye was greater than 21 mmHg. At the end of 4 weeks the IOPs of a comparable number of patients were controlled (IOP less than 22 mmHg) with 20 mg nadolol o.d. and 0.25% timolol b.d. The 40 mg and 80 mg o.d. nadolol regimens were comparable with each other, superior to the 20 mg regimen, and (at least) equivalent to 0.5% timolol. The absolute degree of IOP reduction achieved with oral nadolol was equivalent to that with topical timolol. Alterations in blood pressure and heart rate were predictably greater with the orally administered beta blocker. Long-term therapy (up to 24 months) in 28 nadolol patients and 5 timolol patients indicates no more likelihood of tolerance with nadolol therapy. Patient withdrawals from the study due to adverse reactions occurred with nadolol but not timolol. Since oral nadolol administered once daily is as efficacious as b.d. topical timolol, it can be recommended as first-line therapy for certain subsets of the glaucoma clinic population.", 
    "48": "Forty six normal volunteers were randomly assigned in double-blind fashion to once daily orally administered nadolol 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg for five days. Significant and dose related intraocular pressure (IOP) reductions (range 20-40%) were demonstrated both at three hours and 24 hours post dosing (p less than 0.001, all dosages). The reductions in IOP were dose related (p less than 0.05). One subject (in the 10 mg group) failed to show a significant intraocular pressure reduction. Significant reductions in blood pressure and heart rate also were recorded at all dose levels (with the exception of diastolic pressure in the 10 mg group), though considerably less in degree than IOP reductions. Two subjects (20 mg and 80 mg groups) experienced known side effects of beta blocker therapy necessitating termination of the drug, and four others experienced mild side effects but had no difficulty completing the study. The results have prompted further investigation of the usefulness of low doses of oral nadolol as therapy in chronic simple glaucoma patients.", 
    "49": "The Q-T interval and apex of T wave to end of T wave (aT-eT) interval were measured by computer in four age-matched study groups at rest and during exercise to determine whether: the behavior of the aT-eT interval differs in patients with myocardial ischemia when compared with normal subjects, and the behavior of the aT-eT interval differs in subjects with true positive and false positive ST segment responses. Group I consisted of 57 normal subjects. Group II consisted of 41 symptomatic patients with documented coronary artery disease. A group of apparently healthy subjects with asymptomatic ST segment depression during exercise was divided into two additional groups: Group III, those without coronary artery disease; and Group IV, those with coronary artery disease. Subjects were excluded from the study if they had left ventricular hypertrophy or an intraventricular conduction defect or were taking digitalis or type I antiarrhythmic agents. There were no significant differences in the aT-eT interval and aT-eT/Q-T ratio among the four study groups when compared at rest; however, during exercise at similar heart rates, the aT-eT interval was significantly shorter and the aT-eT/Q-T ratio significantly smaller in Groups II and IV, the subjects with coronary artery disease, than in Group I, the normal subjects. The aT-eT interval and aT-eT/Q-T ratio measurements in Group III did not differ from those in Group I at rest or during exercise. In conclusion, the aT-eT interval and aT-eT/Q-T ratio may reflect changes in myocardial repolarization in exercise-induced ischemia and may have potential for future clinical application.", 
    "50": "Electrophysiologic studies were performed in 15 patients with syncope and/or cardiac arrest who had the long QT syndrome and 11 control subjects who had normal QT intervals. The syndrome was familial in five patients and idiopathic in 10. All patients had a prolonged QT (546 +/- 68 msec, mean +/- SD) and corrected QT (550 +/- 51 msec). Incremental atrial pacing at cycle lengths of 600 to 400 msec resulted in shortening of the QT interval, but there was no significant difference in the magnitude or percent of shortening of the QT interval between patients with the long QT syndrome and control subjects. Intravenous propranolol did not influence the QT interval measured at fixed atrial-paced cycle lengths in patients with either the familial or idiopathic form of the syndrome. Programmed right and left ventricular stimulation with up to three extrastimuli before and during isoproterenol infusion did not induce sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in any of the patients. However, rapid polymorphic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was induced in six of the 15 patients (40%). Neither the inducibility of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia nor the results of electropharmacologic testing with beta-blockers proved to be of any prognostic value during the mean follow-up period of 28 +/- 17 months. Electrophysiologic studies are of limited value in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with the long QT syndrome.",

During an average follow-up of 26 months per patient, four patients died suddenly (1.3% per year) and 27 patients had one or more syncopal episodes (8.6% per year). Multivariate analysis identified congenital deafness, history of syncope, female gender, and a documented episode of torsades de pointes or ventricular fibrillation as independent risk factors for postenrollment syncope or sudden death. Two types of treatment (left stellate ganglionectomy and beta-blocker therapy) were associated with a significant reduction in the occurrence of cardiac events during follow-up.", 
    "52": "SCH 19927, the RR isomer of labetalol, has been shown to possess beta-blocking and vasodilator properties. It was compared to timolol for ability to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in conscious rabbits. Its potential for systemic beta-blockade after topical administration was also assessed. Dose-related reductions in IOP followed topically applied SCH 19927 (0.1-1.0%). Timolol in concentrations less than 0.5% was not effective in lowering IOP. Timolol (0.1 and 0.5%) strongly inhibited tachycardia induced by iv isoproterenol. A 1.0% concentration of SCH 19927 was less effective than 0.5% timolol in inhibiting the isoproterenol-induced tachycardia; 0.1% SCH 19927 caused only minor inhibitory actions. Thus, not only is SCH 19927 at least as potent in lowering IOP in conscious rabbits, its topical administration results in less systemic beta-blockade than does timolol.",

STI as well as RNV showed enhanced myocardial contractility which was normalized after antithyroid treatment. Beta-blocker treatment did not influence the hypercontractility in hyperthyroidism. This implies that beta-blockers alone cannot be regarded as satisfactory long-term treatment and that mechanisms other than increased sympathoadrenal drive are involved in the hypercontractility in hyperthyroidism. RNV suggested valvular regurgitation, probably of the mitral valve, in 11 patients. Possible hemodynamic consequences are discussed.", 
    "56": "The effect of noradrenaline on myocardial sodium-pump activity has been studied, using a direct measure of active ion transport via the pump; namely, the ouabain-sensitive uptake of the radioisotope and potassium analogue rubidium-86 into guinea pig ventricular tissue slices. Physiological concentrations of noradrenaline caused a dose-dependent stimulation of rubidium uptake (peak response at 2 X 10(-7) M). With higher concentrations, the uptake fell progressively. At 6 X 10(-5) M, noradrenaline uptake was lower than control. The stimulatory action is not mediated by classic adrenergic mechanisms. It was not blocked by either alpha- or beta-blockade. Indirect actions via changes in membrane permeability to sodium and potassium ions are also considered. The inhibitory effect of high concentrations of noradrenaline, however, was mediated by alpha-receptors. Stimulation of the pump by noradrenaline could stabilize cellular ion concentrations and resting membrane potential. Since the pump is electrogenic, this is one mechanism by which noradrenaline will cause shortening of action potential. This may provide an explanation for the greater Q-T shortening during exercised-induced tachycardia, compared with atrial pacing. At high concentrations, attained locally during maximal sympathetic stimulation, these advantageous effects may be lost.", 
    "57": "We have assessed the ability of several of the main groups of antiarrhythmic agents to modify the incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation in the isolated working rat heart preparation with transient coronary artery occlusion. Hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit medium containing 5 microM epinephrine to provide some level of exogenous catecholamine support. Compounds selected were: the fast sodium channel inhibitors lignocaine (1 and 10 microM) and prenylamine (4 microM) (the latter also possessing slow calcium channel antagonistic actions); the beta-adrenergic blocking agents oxprenolol (1.2 microM), timolol (0.13 microM), metoprolol (1.0 microM), and acebutolol (5.6 microM); and the slow calcium channel antagonist nifedipine (0.05 and 0.5 microM). After 15 min of coronary artery occlusion, over 90% of control hearts fibrillated 30-60 sec after the onset of reperfusion. Drugs reduced this to the following: prenylamine, 0% (p less than 0.001); 1 microM lignocaine, 83%; 10 microM lignocaine, 33% (p less than 0.01); oxprenolol, 92% (NS); timolol, 92% (NS); metoprolol, 42% (p less than 0.01); acebutolol, 67% (p less than 0.05); 0.05 microM nifedipine, 83% (NS); and 0.5 microM nifedipine, 67% (NS). Thus, inhibition of the fast inward sodium channel with agents such as prenylamine and lignocaine, (when begun before coronary-artery occlusion) offers maximal protection against reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation, while beta-blockade with timolol and oxprenolol and slow calcium channel inhibition with nifedipine do not offer any significant protection. The beta-blocking agents metoprolol and acebutolol produce a partial reduction that may be due to a membrane-stabilizing action, rather than to beta-blockade.", 
    "58": "The modulating role of the cholinergic system in epinephrine (EP)-induced ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) was studied in anesthetized (alpha-chloralose and pentobarbitone sodium) dogs. Unifocal VAs were produced by subepicardial infusion of EP (4 X 10(-3)M) in 2.5 X 10(-3) M CaCl2-0.9% NaCl at a rate of 10 microliter/min for a maximum period of 10 min at a time. One of the interacting drugs acetylcholine Cl (ACh), carbachol Cl (CCh), physostigmine salicylate (PHY), DL-propranolol HC1 (PROP), quindine HC1 (QD), lidocaine HC1 (LD), and atropine sulfate (AT) was given in an equimolar concentration (4 X 10(-3)M) along with EP. The effects of bilateral vagotomy (VT) were also studied. The time of onset, frequency, and duration of VAs were recorded. Reproducible cognizable VAs (less than 10%) were produced by EP in 38 of 43 experimental dogs. Focal infusion of the cholinomimetic agent ACh or CCh marketedly inhibited the arrhythmogenic activity of EP at the focal site. The effect of the anticholinesterase agent PHY was similar. These experiments showed that exogenous administration of a cholinomimetic agent or focal facilitation of endogenous cholinergic influence had an antiarrhythmic activity against EP. On the other hand, bilateral VT or focal infusion of AT markedly potentiated the arrhythmogenic potentiality of EP. Thus, it appeared that removal of endogenous influence facilitated EP-induced arrhythmias. The antiarrhythmic activities of the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent PROP and the membrane-stabilizing agents LD and QD against EP were confirmed using the subepicardial infusion technique. These studies show that the presence of cardiovagal tone or its facilitation inhibits, and its blockade increases, the propensity to VAs in situations in which the adrenergic system may be involved primarily or otherwise. The receptors involved appear to be muscarinic in nature.", 
    "59": "Rates of lipolysis in isolated myocardial cells (myocytes) from rat heart, as measured by the release of glycerol and a reduction in endogenous triacylglycerols, can be stimulated by isoproterenol. Myocyte preparations were calcium-tolerant and were quiescent, even in the presence of isoproterenol, so the stimulation of lipolysis by isoproterenol cannot be secondary to a physiological (inotropic) response. N6-Phenylisopropyladenosine did not reduce isoproterenol-stimulated rates of lipolysis. Increasing the calcium concentration in the incubation medium from 0.75 to 3 mM did not increase the basal output of glycerol. Furthermore, incubation of calcium-tolerant myocytes in the absence of calcium had no effect on either basal or isoproterenol-stimulated rates of lipolysis. Therefore, calcium ions must not influence the lipolytic process directly, and so the calcium dependency for lipolysis observed with perfused heart preparations must reflect the effect of calcium on the contractile performance of the heart, which only secondarily produced a change in rates of lipolysis.", 
    "60": "In rat parotid tissue, amylase secretion and accumulation of cyclic AMP were not selective responses to the different beta-subtypes, beta 1 and beta 2. However, the supersensitivity of the amylase secretory response induced by brief pretreatment with beta-agonist was due specifically to a beta 2-adrenergic response.", 
    "61": "The antiviral drug amantadine has anticholinergic effects in the guinea-pig atrium at concentrations greater than 1 X 10(-4)M. It is a competitive inhibitor of [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to the muscarinic receptor, but antagonizes the negative inotropic effect of acetylcholine in a non-competitive manner. It increases the duration of the atrial action potential and also increases the force of atrial contraction. These effects are evident at approximately 10 times lower concentrations than the antimuscarinic effects. The increase in contractility can be reversed by propranolol (5 X 10(-7)M) but the increase in action potential duration is potentiated by propranolol. Shortening of the action potential duration by acetylcholine was reversed by amantadine, but at approximately ten times lower levels than were needed to reduce the negative inotropic effect. Interactions between beta adrenoceptor binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol and amantadine could not be demonstrated. Similarly, binding of [3H]-nitrendipine to the calcium channel is not influenced. It is suggested that amantadine may exert its positive inotropic effect by interaction with the potassium channel, causing a delay in outward current.", 
    "62": "Because captopril alone does not control blood pressure in all patients with essential hypertension, studies were performed to assess the effect of sodium intake and of captopril combined with hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, and nifedipine. Captopril given for 5 days to normotensive subjects having high, normal, and low sodium intakes reduced blood pressure the most in those on the lowest intake; the fall correlated with that in plasma angiotensin II. When 12 patients with moderate hypertension had hydrochlorothiazide added to captopril their blood pressure fell significantly. When propranolol was added to captopril, however, there was no further fall in blood pressure. When propranolol was added to captopril and a diuretic, pressures measured 4 and 6 h after the last dose of captopril showed reduced values compared with placebo; pressures measured 2 and 12 h after did not. Nifedipine added to captopril reduced blood pressure more than either drug alone. When renin and angiotensin are low, as they may be in essential hypertension, captopril is less effective; its effectiveness should increase if sodium is restricted. Both diuretics and nifedipine increase the effectiveness of captopril; propranolol does not, although it may prolong captopril's action. Experience in patients with resistant hypertension suggests that adding nifedipine to captopril may reduce the need for diuretics, while adding captopril to nifedipine may reduce the need for beta-blockers.", 
    "63": "A total of 270 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were evaluated in a multicenter double-blind randomized study that compared the effect of captopril plus a thiazide diuretic with that of propranolol plus a diuretic. All patients were previously uncontrolled with diuretics alone. Following a 4-week placebo control period, during which diuretic was not withdrawn, the patients were treated either with 37.5-75 mg/day of captopril (n = 133) or with 60-120 mg/day of propranolol (n = 137) for 12 weeks, the diuretic being continued in both groups. Blood pressure in both groups was significantly reduced after 2 weeks of treatment. Reduction in systolic but not diastolic blood pressure after 10 and 12 weeks of treatment was significantly greater in the captopril group than in the propranolol group (p less than 0.05). Treatment was considered to be effective in 77% of the captopril patients and in 61% of the propranolol group. The difference was significant (p less than 0.05). Side effects occurred in 6 of the 133 patients (4.5%) treated with captopril and in 16 of the 137 patients (11.7%) treated with propranolol. The difference between the two groups was significant (p less than 0.05). There were few significant changes in laboratory data in either group. The serious side effects previously reported with higher doses of captopril were not observed. The results indicate that low-dose captopril plus a diuretic is more efficacious than propranolol plus a diuretic in mild to moderate essential hypertension previously uncontrolled with a diuretic alone.", 
    "64": "Diuretics have so far enjoyed a prominent position in all stepped-care programs, as the preferred first choice drug in most American schemes or as an alternative first choice drug with respect to beta-blockers in the WHO scheme. Among various reasons for this prominence has been that antihypertensive drugs available until recently all gradually led to sodium and water retention, and therefore required to be combined with a diuretic. This is no longer true: several antihypertensive agents are available now that do not require combination with diuretics, these new agents including not only beta-blockers but also angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium entry blockers. Furthermore, some concern about the metabolic effects of diuretics has recently been raised, especially because of the failure to prevent coronary heart disease by the current diuretic-based antihypertensive regimens. Without denying the importance that diuretics have had in the past in making antihypertensive therapy successful and their continuing essential role in treating severe hypertension, it is likely, in my opinion, that in future years diuretics are going to be more often used as agents of second choice, mostly in combination with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and, perhaps, some of the calcium blockers. In conclusion, although opinions of various experts about the sequence of choices between antihypertensive drugs may obviously differ, there is no doubt that the addition of new classes of effective agents, such as the ACE inhibitors and the calcium entry blockers, is making antihypertensive therapy more flexible and more easily suitable to the needs of individual patients.", 
    "65": "In any therapeutic situation, the choice of drug therapy depends on an estimation of relative risk and benefit. With respect to moderate hypertension, and with less certainty, mild hypertension, the use of drug therapy has resulted in a decrease in overall mortality, a decrease in the incidence of stroke and renal impairment, but little or no change in the incidence of ischemic heart disease. For several years, the choice of first drug in these situations has rested between thiazide diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. There is probably little to choose between these two groups in terms of efficacy, and equally there is little evidence that patient response to one or other agents can be predicted either on demographic or biochemical evidence. There are, however, several studies both in Africa and America suggesting that black patients have a relatively greater hypotensive response to thiazides than to beta-blockers. The adverse reaction profile of these two groups is quite different. There is currently much debate whether the administration of large doses of thiazide diuretics (for example, 10 mg bendrofluazide per day) may cause a constellation of metabolic side effects (hyperlipemia, hypokalemia, abnormal glucose tolerance, and hyperuricemia) which may result in an increase of the risk of developing coronary artery disease in spite of lowering blood pressure. Further, there is no good evidence that the hypotensive effect of diuretics is dose dependent. On the other hand, the evidence that beta-blockers when used as antihypertensive agents have a primary preventive effect for ischemic heart disease is currently very small.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "An important consideration in the choice of initial treatment is race. In a Veterans Administration study nadolol reduced blood pressure more in whites than in blacks, while the reverse was true with hydrochlorothiazide. Combining both drugs enhanced antihypertensive effectiveness and abolished the racial difference. The results of this and other studies suggest that for first drug selection, beta-blockers are indicated in whites and diuretics in blacks. Beta-blockers are also indicated in all patients with prior myocardial infarction or with tachycardia. Thiazides are also used in combination with other antihypertensive drugs and in patients with heart failure. Reluctance to use thiazide diuretics stems from the possibility of hypokalemia-induced arrhythmias and long-term elevations of serum cholesterol. However, a causal relationship between hypokalemia and the incidence of arrhythmias is not well supported by physiologic or clinical evidence. Elevation of cholesterol appears to be transient, reverting back to pretreatment levels after 6-12 months of treatment. An alternative regimen which is both highly effective and well tolerated is the combination of small doses of both a thiazide diuretic and captopril. Perhaps less well tolerated, but useful where cost is the major consideration, is a thiazide followed by small doses of reserpine, if needed; this is an effective, low-cost treatment. Calcium channel blockers appear promising but require further evaluation.", 
    "67": "In patients with acute myocardial infarction the haemodynamic relevance of the ancillary pharmacological properties of cardioselectivity and of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) possessed by beta-blocking drugs is unclear. The dose-response effects of atenolol and acebutolol, two cardioselective compounds, the latter also possessing a degree of ISA, were therefore compared in a single-blind, dose-response, crossover study in patients within 18 h of suffering an uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction. The logarithmic cumulative dosage schedule achieved plasma concentrations in the clinical therapeutic ranges for both atenolol (0.05 +/- 0.04-0.19 +/- 0.03 micrograms/ml) and acebutolol (0.22 +/- 0.14-0.8 +/- 0.29 micrograms/ml). Incremental doses of intravenous atenolol (cumulative, 1-8 mg) resulted in significant decreases in systolic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, and stroke work index (p less than 0.01 for each). Pulmonary artery occluded pressure (p less than 0.05) and systemic vascular resistance (p less than 0.01) increased. Incremental doses of intravenous acebutolol (cumulative, 10-80 mg) also resulted in significant decreases in systolic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, and stroke work index (p less than 0.01 for each). Systemic vascular resistance increased (p less than 0.01); there was no consistent change in the pulmonary artery occluded pressure. Within the limits of the experimental protocol, the additional property of ISA possessed by acebutolol resulted in no statistically significant haemodynamic differences from atenolol. This may reflect either an insufficient degree of ISA possessed by acebutolol to confirm the original hypothesis, or its haemodynamic irrelevance in the presence of the increased sympathetic tone that is frequently present following acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "68": "Serotonin (5HT) constricts large arteries in vitro, an effect which seems contrary to 5HT-induced increases in blood flow observed in vivo. We used angiography to assess large artery responses, and blood flow (Q, electromagnetic flowmeter) to assess arteriolar responses to 5HT, norepinephrine (NE), and antagonists in the femoral circulation of the intact, anesthetized dog. 5HT constricted large arteries at a threshold dose of less than 10 micrograms/min, giving a 45 +/- 3% reduction of popliteal artery diameter at 100 micrograms/min (p less than 0.001). NE failed to constrict large arteries. With 100 micrograms/min 5HT, Q increased (delta Q = 108 +/- 26 ml/min; p = 0.001). NE decreased Q. Ketanserin, a 5HT and alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, exerted a dose-dependent inhibition of 5HT-induced large artery constriction. Methysergide partially blocked the 5HT-induced large artery constriction. Ketanserin potentiated the Q response to 5HT whereas higher doses of methysergide reduced the Q response to 5HT. Neither indomethacin nor propranolol altered either response. Failure of NE to constrict large arteries in vivo and ketanserin antagonism of constriction produced by 5HT suggest the response to 5HT involves the 5HT2 receptor. No role for the 5HT2 receptor in blood flow responses is suggested. These observations may have implications for therapy of occlusive vascular disease.", 
    "69": "We studied interactions between the putative calcium entry promotor Bay k 8644 and alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated increases in diastolic pressure elicited by cirazoline as well as alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated pressor responses induced by B-HT 920 in pithed cats. Bay k 8644 (0.01-1 mg/kg, i.a.) did not affect the log dose-pressor response curve of cirazoline, but slightly potentiated the increase in diastolic pressure elicited by B-HT 920. After attenuation of the B-HT 920-induced pressor effects by the calcium entry blocker nifedipine (0.1 mg/kg, i.a.), Bay k 8644 (0.1 mg/kg, i.a.) strongly enhanced the pressor response. The increase in diastolic pressure elicited by cirazoline was not affected by nifedipine (0.1 mg/kg, i.a.), and the addition of Bay k 8644 (0.1 mg/kg, i.a.) had no effect. We conclude that in contrast to the increase in diastolic pressure elicited by B-HT 920, calcium channels are not involved in the cirazoline-induced pressor responses in the pithed cat. The activation of the calcium channels by B-HT 920 is already so efficient that it cannot be further enhanced by Bay k 8644.", 
    "70": "AR-L57 and AR-L115 have been of interest as inotropic agents for management of heart failure. Although their physiological effects are well documented, their mechanism(s) of action are unclear. Both AR-L57 and AR-L115 increased contractile force of cat papillary muscles in concentration-dependent manners; these effects were independent of either alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. To determine if these effects occurred via a cAMP-dependent mechanism, cardiotonic actions were studied in the presence of carbachol. Muscarinic stimulation of papillary muscles attenuated contractile responses to AR-L115 thus implying a cAMP-mediated response. By contrast, carbachol did not alter the dose-response profile to AR-L57. In addition, AR-L115 potentiated the inotropic actions of isoproterenol whereas AR-L57 was ineffective. Both AR-L57 and ouabain increased diastolic resting tension in papillary muscles--a phenomenon associated with a state of Ca2+ overload; AR-L115 was without effect. In anesthetized dogs, i.v. AR-L57 and AR-L115 increased contractility and heart rate while reducing mean arterial blood pressure. Both agents had similar rates of onset (10-15 s) and durations of action (40-60 min). Although in vitro studies clearly indicate that AR-L57 and AR-L115 enhance inotropic state by distinct mechanisms, their in vivo cardiovascular profiles are comparable.", 
    "71": "Recent observations on sympathetic constriction of the poststenotic coronary bed without dilatory reserve indicate the involvement of postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors, which are commonly regarded as noninnervated, hormonal receptors. Therefore, we characterized the vascular alpha-adrenoceptor activated during the competition between sympathetic constriction and metabolic dilation of the nonstenosed coronary bed by analyzing myocardial oxygen balance. In 39 anesthetized, spinalized open-chest dogs with bilateral cervical vagotomy, the left decentralized stellate ganglion was stimulated while mean aortic pressure was kept constant. Stimulation at 1 and 10 Hz lowered coronary venous oxygen saturation by 2.5 +/- 0.3 (SEM) and by 11.1 +/- 0.8 saturation %, respectively, in experiments under beta-blockade (4 mg/kg nadolol, n = 21). In experiments without beta-blockade (n = 18), the saturation response was similar. Under beta-blockade, alpha 2-blockade by rauwolscine (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) attenuated the decline in saturation induced by 10 Hz stimulation to 0.56 +/- 0.08 (p less than 0.01) of the control response and to 0.30 +/- 0.06 (p less than 0.001), respectively, whereas alpha 1-blockade by prazosin (0.012 and 0.12 mg/kg) modified this response only to 0.94 +/- 0.06 (NS) and to 0.75 +/- 0.08 (0.1 greater than p greater than 0.05). Without beta-blockade, similar attenuations to 0.36 +/- 0.07 (p less than 0.001) by 0.3 mg/kg rauwolscine and to 0.80 +/- 0.09 (NS) by 0.12 mg/kg prazosin were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, administered subcutaneously to conscious adrenalectomized rats made hypertensive by exogenous glucocorticoids, has been shown to induce acutely a marked fall in blood pressure and heart rate. These animals almost completely lacked circulating epinephrine. Because both changes were closely related, it was suggested that in this model of hypertension propranolol acts via a central mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we now administered sotalol (300 micrograms) intracerebroventricularly to unanesthetized adrenalectomized rats with glucocorticoid-induced hypertension (this hydrophilic beta-blocking agent does not cross the blood-brain barrier). The same experiments were also performed in sham-operated glucocorticoid-hypertensive rats. On the day of the study, there was no significant difference between adrenalectomized and sham-operated groups of rats in intraarterial pressure and heart rate. Sotalol increased blood pressure and significantly slowed heart rate during the 60-min observation period, both in adrenalectomized and sham-operated rats. Sotalol's vehicle had no blood pressure effect and caused a transient heart rate acceleration in rats with, as well as without, circulating epinephrine. These results therefore suggest that the previously observed enhanced effect of peripherally administered propranolol in the absence of detectable circulating epinephrine, in this model, is not mediated centrally.", 
    "73": "The effects of S-596 and coarteolol, new beta-adrenergic blockers, were studied by means of the oral fluorescein method. Transfer coefficients by diffusion, kd.pa, and by flow, kfa, were estimated in a total of 11 normal young volunteers, in whom the drug was instilled in one eye and the placebo in the fellow eye. With 0.5% dl-S-596, kd.pa increased to 124 +/- 9% (mean +/- SD) and kfa decreased to 67 +/- 10% of the control eye. With 1% dl-carteolol, kd.pa increased to 121 +/- 4%, and kfa decreased to 84 +/- 11% of the control eye. Both S-596 and carteolol increased iris permeability and decreased the aqueous flow rate significantly. In a group of 13 cases, intracapsular extraction of senile cataract was carried out with postoperative routine instillations, and in another group of 7 cases, it was carried out with additional topical flurbiprofen, a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Flurbiprofen ophthalmic solution (0.1%) was instilled 3, 2, 1, and 0.5 h before the surgery and 4 times a day postoperatively. On the 6th postoperative day, a fluorophotometric study was carried out using oral fluorescein, and a coefficient that reflects the permeability of the blood-aqueous barrier after the cataract surgery was calculated. It was found that additional topical flurbiprofen considerably suppresses the disruption of the blood-aqueous barrier.", 
    "74": "The thermal dilution technique and its suitability for automatic computation of left ventricular volumes were evaluated on 28 anaesthetized dogs. The end-diastolic volume (EDV) was computed from ventricular washout curves in two ways, first utilizing the ratio between the indicator amount and its peak concentration (first ejection method); and secondly the ratio between stroke volume and ejection fraction with the latter obtained by subtracting the residual fraction from 1.0. The residual fraction was determined as the mean of ratios between successive steps of four ventricular ejections on the downslope of the curve (downslope method). The linear correlation coefficient between the EDV determinations (n = 366) was 0.926, and slope y = 1.14 X + 0.5 ml with 4.6 ml as standard error of estimate. The first ejection method gave on average 15% higher EDV values than the downslope method. When heart rate was increased by pacing from 88 to 240/min, both methods showed a reduction of the EDV, but the downslope method to a greater degree. When afterload was increased but heart rate decreased by phenylephrine, the first ejection method but not the downslope method indicated an increase in EDV. Otherwise, when pronounced tachy- or bradycardia were avoided, ventricular volumes yielded by the two methods were comparable. Indicator injection did not substantially affect ventricular pressure dynamics. The first ejection method seems to be a simple means for repeated measurements of EDV even in the case of diseased hearts.", 
    "75": "High lumbar epidural block was induced in seven dogs, causing a fall in mean arterial blood pressure (AP) from 24.5 +/- 2.9 to 12.0 +/- 3.1 kPa owing to reductions in cardiac output (QT) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to 67% and 68% of the pre-epidural values. Volume loading with dextran 10 ml X kg-1 b.w. increased QT nearly to the pre-epidural value. SVR decreased further to 61% of the pre-epidural value and AP was only slightly increased to 14.9 +/- 2.7 kPa. Subsequent administration of prenalterol 20 micrograms X kg-1 b.w. caused a further increase in QT to 17% above the pre-epidural value due to an increase in heart rate of 51 beats/min. AP did not change since SVR decreased further to 49% of the pre-epidural value. The hepatic arterial blood flow (QHA) was essentially unchanged during epidural block as well as during volume loading, while the portal venous blood flow (Qpv) was changed concurrently with (QT). In spite of the decrease in SVR, the preportal and hepatic arterial vascular resistances were not diminished following prenalterol. The increase in OT must therefore have favoured other vascular beds. Hepatic and pre-portal tissue oxygen uptakes were unchanged during the experimental procedure, while whole-body oxygen uptake decreased by 20% following the epidural block and increased nearly to the pre-epidural level following volume loading in combination with prenalterol.", 
    "76": "The dromotropic effect of Bay k 8644 and its interaction with the negative dromotropic effects of nifedipine, verapamil, MnCl2 and tetrodotoxin were investigated by use of isolated, blood-perfused atrioventricular (AV) node preparations of dogs. These agents were injected into the AV node artery. Single injections of Bay k 8644 (0.1-10 micrograms) shortened AV conduction time, but the decrease remained only about 9 msec at 10 micrograms. This effect was not modified by nadolol. Dose-response curves for the negative dromotropic effect of nifedipine were shifted to the right by about 0.5 log units with infusions of Bay k 8644 into the AV node artery at rates of 3 and 10 micrograms/min. A similar shift of dose-response curves to verapamil occurred at 10 micrograms/min of Bay k 8644. However, Bay k 8644 (3 and 10 micrograms/min) failed to modify dose-response curves to MnCl2 and tetrodotoxin. Bay k 8644 (10 micrograms) produced a greater decrease in AV conduction time during the negative dromotropic effect of verapamil (10 or 30 micrograms) and a far greater decrease during the negative dromotropic effect of nifedipine (3 or 10 micrograms) than under control conditions. In contrast, Bay k 8644 (10 micrograms) produced a decrease in AV conduction time nearly to the same extent during the negative dromotropic effect of MnCl2 (10 or 30 mumol) or tetrodotoxin (10 or 30 micrograms) as under control conditions. From these results Bay k 8644 can be described as a rather specific pharmacological antagonist for dihydropyridine slow channel blockers.", 
    "77": "A 12-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of left-sided chest pain. On physical examination she was noted to have an irregular pulse, and an electrocardiogram revealed 30 to 50 premature ventricular contractions per minute with periods of bigeminy. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and treated with antiarrhythmic medication without resolution of her premature ventricular contractions. A diagnostic workup, including echocardiogram, Holter monitoring, and exercise stress testing, was performed. It was determined that the cardiac dysrhythmia, consisting of unifocal premature ventricular contractions with a characteristic configuration on the electrocardiogram, was benign in nature and did not require antiarrhythmic therapy.", 
    "78": "Ca2+ ions are critical to the functions of the various cells involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. Interest has developed regarding the potential use of Ca2+ antagonists in the management of asthma and allergic diseases. The information accumulated to date suggests that Ca2+ entry blockers may decrease airway smooth muscle responses to contractile agonists and may also reduce chemical mediator release from mast cells. Both processes would be expected to modify favorably the pathophysiology of asthma. This seems to have been demonstrated with the findings that certain Ca2+ entry blockers may inhibit exercise-induced bronchospasm and cold air- and antigen-induced airway narrowing. In several but not all experiments a direct bronchodilating effect of nifedipine was found in some subjects. In asthmatic patients with coexistent cardiovascular disease requiring beta-blocker therapy, it would be appropriate to use drugs such as the currently available Ca2+ entry blockers in place of the contraindicated beta-blocking agents. It appears that the currently available Ca2+ entry blockers have not provided a breakthrough class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of asthma. However, it seems highly likely that new Ca2+ antagonist drugs can be expected which will have greater specificity for airway smooth muscle and perhaps other cell types involved in the pathogenesis of asthma.",

Results are compared with those of other vertebrates to estimate the specific pattern of this secretion in birds. The flow of pancreatic juice was greater in conscious chickens than when anaesthetized (Table 1). Amylase activity was greater than that of the other species and was of the same order in anaesthetized and conscious birds (Table 1). A spontaneous exocrine pancreatic secretion was seen to remain after eliminating a large part of the tonic influences (Table 2).", 
    "80": "The responses to a supine rest, norepinephrine (NE) and angiotensin II (Ang II) were investigated in the absence and presence of calcium antagonist nifedipine or diltiazem in essential (genetic, arterial) hypertension and normotension in humans. A supine rest significantly decreased blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), stroke volume index (SI), and cardiac output index (CI). On the contrary, the rest increased total peripheral vascular resistance index (TPRI) in both normotensives and hypertensives. The decrease in BP was significantly greater in hypertensives than in normotensives. NE significantly increased BP and TPRI, whereas it decreased HR, SI, and CI. The increase in BP was greater in hypertensives than in normotensives. Nifedipine and diltiazem inhibited the NE-induced increases in BP and TPRI. Ang II increased BP and TPRI, but it decreased HR, SI, and CI. Diltiazem did not inhibit the Ang-II-induced increases in both BP and TPRI. The increased responses to a rest and NE were observed in the early stage of essential hypertension. The increased responses may contribute to both the increase in BP and the induction of high blood pressure in essential hypertension. The calcium antagonists inhibited the NE-induced increases in BP and TPR. The results suggest that the antagonists inhibit the NE-dependent calcium influx and calcium release in the arterial smooth muscle. The observed responses to Ang II suggest that the antagonists may not inhibit Ang-II-dependent calcium-channel activity in the smooth muscle.", 
    "81": "Age and elevated blood pressure are associated with blunted beta-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiovascular effects. To investigate a possible relationship between beta-adrenoceptor cardiovascular function and receptor density, beta-adrenoceptor binding capacity in mononuclear leucocytes and cardiac isoproterenol sensitivity were compared in 12 essential hypertensive and 17 normotensive subjects of comparable age. The bolus dose of isoproterenol which increased heart rate by 25 beats/min (CD25) as well as plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, and renin activity were measured. In a radioreceptor assay using [3H]dihydroalprenolol, the antagonist binding capacity (Bmax) and the affinity constant (KD) of mononuclear leucocytes were determined. Bmax in patients was higher than in normotensive subjects (66.8 +/- 4.1 versus 48.0 +/- 3.8 SEM fmol/mg, p less than 0.05), and KD was identical in both groups. In hypertensive patients, Bmax correlated positively with age (r = 0.639, p less than 0.05) and CD25 (r = 0.593, p less than 0.05) and negatively with plasma renin activity (r = 0.679, p less than 0.05), while in normotensive subjects, Bmax correlated with CD25 only (r = 0.615, p less than 0.05). Thus, in patients with essential hypertension, a decrease in cardiac isoproterenol sensitivity and plasma renin activity is associated with an age-related increase in antagonist binding capacity. This suggests a defect in the membrane coupling of the beta-adrenoceptor effector system distal to the receptor recognition site in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "82": "Phenylephrine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline have been shown to act on both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors to produce an increase in heart rate in the pithed rat and rat isolated atria. Abolition of these responses requires blockade of both types of adrenoceptors. The rank order of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists to produce positive chronotropic responses was adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than phenylephrine greater than methoxamine. In the case of methoxamine, positive chronotropic responses were largely due to the activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The positive chronotropic responses to activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors developed more slowly than did the response to beta-adrenoceptor activation in the pithed rat. The fact that blockade of one receptor type enhanced the positive chronotropic responses to activation of the other receptor type suggests that there may be an interaction between the cardiac alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors mediating positive chronotropic responses. In the rat isolated atria, the calcium antagonists verapamil (10 nmol/L) and nifedipine (10 nmol/L) also inhibited the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive chronotropic effect of phenylephrine to the same extent as prazosin (10 nmol/L). Prazosin was not a calcium antagonist, as shown by its failure to block the contracture of the depolarized rat isolated aortic strips. Neither verapamil nor nifedipine were alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists at these concentrations.", 
    "83": "The vascular and cardiac effects of bombesin and substance P were evaluated in a \"pithed rat preparation\" in order to study the cardiovascular effects of these neuropeptides in the absence of the central nervous system control mechanisms. Bombesin (0.7, 7.0 and 70 nmol/kg) produced dose-dependent increases in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP): +6 +/- 1, +11 +/- 2 (p less than 0.05) and +22 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), respectively, when injected IV into the pithed rat. Heart rate (HR) responses to bombesin (0.7-70 nmol/kg) were also increased in a dose-dependent manner: +14 +/- 6, +28 +/- 5 (p less than 0.05) and +45 +/- 3 (p less than 0.05) beats/min (bpm), respectively. The blood pressure (BP) and HR responses to bombesin were diminished but not completely abolished by pretreatment with 1 mg/kg of either the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol or the H1-histamine receptor antagonist pyrilamine. Substance P similarly caused a dose-dependent increase in MAP: +7 +/- 1 and +38 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), by 0.7 and 700 nmol/kg, respectively, without altering HR. BP responses to sympathetic stimulation were also examined in the pithed rat utilizing electrical stimulation of the spinal cord (1 Hz, 50 V, 1 msec duration for 30 sec). These responses were potentiated by the low doses (0.7 and 7.0 nmol/kg) of bombesin (p less than 0.01) but tended to be suppressed by the highest dose. The HR response to stimulation was significantly reduced: -25 +/- 8 bpm (p less than 0.05) by the highest dose of bombesin (70 nmol/kg) but not with lower doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
