Forty MI patients were stratified into beta-blocker medication users and non-users and randomly assigned to the experimental or control conditions. The 21 experimental subjects performed a walk/stair climb, and the 19 control subjects, a walk/stand activity protocol. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure from before, to immediately after both the walk/stair and walk/stand activity protocols were clinically small. No significant differences existed in the distribution of hemodynamic signs among the experimental and control subjects. However, proportionately more experimental than control subjects had symptoms of activity intolerance (7/21 vs 1/19; p less than 0.05). No correlation existed between activity (in) tolerance and either days post-MI or time required for stair climbing. Based upon these preliminary findings, assessment of tolerance to stair climbing activities is warranted during the second week post-MI.", 
    "1": "1. Studies were carried out in the rat to investigate the effect of adrenoceptor antagonists on stomach to caecum transit time under control conditions and during ileal infusion of Intralipid. Stomach to caecum transit time (SCTT) of the head of the meal was measured by use of environmental hydrogen analysis and the distribution of the meal was assessed by a scintigraphic technique. 2. Four adrenoceptor antagonists were used in these studies, the alpha 1 antagonist prazosin, the alpha 2 antagonist, idazoxan, the beta 1 antagonist atenolol and the beta 2 antagonist ICI 118551. 3. None of the antagonists affected SCTT of the head of the meal during ileal infusion of saline. However, the alpha 1 and beta 1 antagonists significantly reversed (P less than 0.05) the delay in SCTT induced by ileal infusion of Intralipid whereas the alpha 2 antagonist, idazoxan, potentiated this delay (P less than 0.05). 4. Study of the distribution of the radiolabelled meal showed that the Intralipid delayed SCTT by slowing both gastric emptying (P less than 0.05) and small bowel transit (P less than 0.05). 5. Prazosin delayed gastric emptying under control conditions (P less than 0.001) but did not alter significantly the effect of ileal lipid on the distribution of the meal, 100 min or 200 min after gavage.6. The meal distribution was more compatible with the hydrogen analysis after administration of the ,beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. The reversal of the lipid-induced delay in SCTT caused by atenolol was associated with more radioactivity in the large intestine 200min after the gavage. ICI 118551 had no significant effects on either the distribution of the meal or the SCTT of the head of the meal.7. In conclusion, the data confirm that the sympathetic nervous system normally modulates or mediates the mechanisms that influence gastrointestinal transit in the rat and suggest that these mechanisms may be involved in the ileal brake effect. Nevertheless the data also suggest that simple measurement of the transit of the head of the meal by use of environmental hydrogen analysis may sometimes give a misleading impression of the action of drugs on gastrointestinal transit of the bulk of a test meal.", 
    "2": "The effects of vitamin K3 treatment on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of (+)-propranolol and the consequences of hepatic injury associated with vitamin K3 treatment were examined in groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats. When vitamin K3 (20 mg/kg) in polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG 300) was coinfused with (+)-propranolol (2 mg/kg) into the pyloric vein (a tributary flowing directly into the hepatic portal vein), a significant decrease in the intrinsic clearance of total drug (CLint) from 94.1 +/- 50.1 to 32.9 +/- 11.5 ml/min/kg was observed (p less than 0.01 vs. vehicle control). However, a lower dose of vitamin K3 (2 mg/kg in PEG 300) had little effect on this parameter. Interestingly, the PEG 300 vehicle control group exhibited a significantly (p less than 0.05) higher CLint than that observed in a saline control group (94.1 +/- 50.1 vs. 45.9 +/- 13.7 ml/min/kg). This difference appeared to be due to an increase in the free fraction of propranolol caused by PEG 300, because in vitro addition of this solvent to serum (at estimated in vivo concentrations) with or without added vitamin K3 doubled propranolol free fraction. Furthermore, rats that received the high dose vitamin K3 (20 mg/kg) treatment exhibited a pronounced increase in the serum concentration of enzymes of hepatic origin (alanine aminotransferase and sorbitol dehydrogenase) and in the incidence of hepatic necrosis. It was also observed that high-dose vitamin K3 treatment caused only minor changes in the urinary recovery of propranolol metabolites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "4": "Exercise testing has been shown to be predictive for future cardiac events in patients with established diagnosis of coronary heart disease. Exercise test parameters associated with poor prognosis may be unreliable if patient is receiving beta adrenergic agents. The purpose of this study was: 1) to compare the results of exercise testing performed before and during beta blocking therapy, and 2) to determine the role of beta blockers in the prognostic significance of the ST-segment response recorded during exercise testing. The study population consisted of 518 patients (mean age 52 +/- 7 years) with coronary heart disease. The diagnosis was based on the presence of one of the following three criteria: 1) typical history and significant ST-segment depression on resting or exercise electrocardiogram, 2) history of myocardial infarction, 3) significant coronary angiographic abnormalities. In all patients symptom-limited exercise test was performed before and two weeks after the onset of beta blocker therapy. The data from the first and second tests were estimated for significance of differences between the mean values with following results: maximal heart rate--135 +/- 21 and 123 +/- 19 bpm (p less than 0.001), maximal work load achieved--98 +/- 43 and 109 +/- 44 W (p less than 0.001), maximal systolic blood pressure--171 +/- 28 and 163 +/- 26 mmHg (p less than 0.001). Occurrence of characteristic ST-segment depression was more frequent during the first than during the second test (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The clinical and instrumental findings, including MRI at the wrist, excluded all other possible causes of CTS. The improvement in symptoms and electromyographic findings on discontinuation of the drug suggested that the CTS may have been related to the beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "6": "Adrenergic receptor blockade has been shown to be of benefit in the treatment of adverse cardiovascular changes in patients with burns during the hypermetabolic phase. This article examines the stress response to cold exposure in adults and children with 33% to 95% total body surface area burns with and without beta-blockade. Resting energy expenditures were measured by indirect calorimetry; the test subjects were exposed to mean temperatures of 27.5 degrees C (room temperature) or 24.6 degrees C (cold). The mean resting energy expenditure at ambient room temperature in patients with burns without beta-blockade was 1411 +/- 70 kcal/m2/day (mean +/- SEM). This value was 142% of that predicted for normal control subjects without burns. When placed in a cold temperature, patients with burns significantly increased their resting energy expenditures by 160% of predicted values, whereas patients with similar burns and beta-blockade increased their resting energy expenditures by 156%. Adults with septic burns had a mean resting energy expenditure 198% of the predicted value. These patients did not significantly increase their resting energy expenditures when they were exposed to cold either with or without beta-blockade. Data suggest that patients with septic burns already have a maximal metabolic response and that cold stress does not further increase this response. Males, ages 17 to 54 years, were found to increase their resting energy expenditures by 11.4 kcal/m2/day for each percent total body surface area burn. We conclude that beta-blockade with propranolol in therapeutic doses may be used in patients with burns without adversely affecting the cold stress response.", 
    "7": "The various antihypertensive agents reduce blood pressure by different mechanisms. Alpha-1 receptor blockers reduce vascular resistance and maintain cardiac output. Chronic treatment with beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity produces a fall in blood pressure which is associated with a fall in cardiac index and heart rate. Beta blockers with strong intrinsic sympathomimetic activity showed reduced heart rate during exercise. Labetalol reduces cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance with little or no reduction in peripheral blood flow. Alpha-1 blockers are suitable for patients with active life-styles, with peripheral vascular disorders, or with high blood-cholesterol levels. Beta blockers are useful in patients who have tachycardia, palpitation problems, or angina pectoris, or who have survived a heart attack. They should not be used in patients with bronchial asthma, reduced peripheral blood flow, or heart failure. Labetalol reduces blood pressure in a somewhat larger fraction of patients than the pure alpha- or beta-blocking agents. It is hoped that its long-term results will include regression of cardiovascular damage, improved quality of life, and increased life expectancy.", 
    "8": "In the absence of GTP or its analogues, the beta-adrenoceptor agonist (H), the receptor (R) and the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (GS-protein) form a slowly dissociable complex (HRGSGDP). It is presumed that the agonist in this ternary complex is bound to the receptor with high affinity while its binding to the receptor in the HR-complex is of low affinity. We have studied the effect of Mg2+ on the formation of these two complexes by the displacement of (-)-[3H]CGP-12177 with (-)-isoprenaline in cell membranes prepared from guinea-pig lung parenchyma. In the absence of Mg2+, only monophasic displacement curves were obtained with a dissociation constant not differing from that obtained in the presence of Gpp(NH)p and Mg2+. In the presence of Mg2+ and absence of Gpp(NH)p, a shallow binding curve was obtained that fitted a two site model best. One of the dissociation constants agreed well with that obtained in the presence of Gpp(NH)p and Mg2+ but the other one was 27 times smaller. It was concluded that Mg2+ is necessary for the coupling between the HR-complex and the GS-protein. The two dissociation constants obtained in the absence of Gpp(NH)p represent the dissociation constants of the HR- and HRGSGDP-complexes and may correspond to those named KL and KH in the literature. According to our study, there may be no difference in affinity between the agonist and receptor in the HR- and HRGSGDP-complexes. The two dissociation constants obtained in the absence of GTP or its analogues refer to two consecutive reactions.", 
    "9": "In recent years self-measurement of blood pressure at home has gained increasing importance but there have been only a few studies comparing casual, ambulatory, and self-measured blood pressure determinations during a single clinical trial. We therefore compared treatment-induced blood pressure-reductions in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study design with a single morning dose of either 10 mg bisoprolol (n = 26) or 20 mg nitrendipine (n = 27) with casual blood pressure readings in the morning before the dose, ambulatory 24-h monitoring, and self-recorded measurements in the morning before the dose and in the evening. Mean reductions for systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 4 weeks of therapy were significantly greater for bisoprolol than for nitrendipine. The treatment-induced blood pressure reductions were most pronounced as assessed by casual readings but showed good agreement between casual, ambulatory, and self-measured blood pressure for group comparisons. In some patients, however, marked individual differences between the three methods were observed. Correlation coefficients between ambulatory and self-measured blood pressure were 0.4 for systolic blood pressure (P less than .05) and 0.6 for diastolic blood pressure (P less than .0005). Under the conditions of this parallel study design and the usual statistical risks, a difference of 5 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure can be detected in 118 patients at the clinic, in 70 patients if ambulatory blood pressure is used, or in 56 patients if self-measured blood pressure is used. In conclusion, bisoprolol was more effective over 24 h than nitrendipine at the doses studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "A metaanalysis was performed to determine the effects on quality of life (QL) in hypertension as reported in published clinical trials of antihypertensive drug therapy. All studies included compared active treatment to baseline (placebo or no treatment) with the patients as their own control and used blinded, randomized trials. Change was measured by self and/or interviewer-assisted evaluation, standardized psychomotor/cognitive tests, or sleep laboratory observations. After an exhaustive literature search (1970 to 1990), nine published trials of 27 population groups (n = 1620) using 14 drugs from six pharmacological groups met selection criteria and were analyzed for five QL constructs: sexual function, sleep, psychomotor, general well-being, and mood. Small positive effect size (d) improvement with treatment was seen for sleep (d = 0.106), psychomotor (d = 0.283), general well-being (d = 0.139), and mood (d = 0.167) while no effect could be determined for sexual function (d = -0.030) based on 95% confidence intervals. Either a comparably small improvement with treatment or no effect was seen among various pharmacological drug groups; no negative effect with treatment was identified. A larger positive effect could be postulated if the drug choice was individualized to the patient rather than randomized as in clinical trial methodology. Although none of the drug groups had a clearly superior effect, a more frequent positive effect with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers was seen for all constructs. Narrower demographics and smaller sample sizes may have biased similar positive effects in calcium-channel blockers and diuretics.", 
    "11": "To evaluate the effect of beta 1-blockade (metoprolol) on the plasma glucose thresholds initiating counterregulatory hormone responses and symptoms of hypoglycemia, we used a modified glucose clamp technique to produce a standardized gradual glucose decline from 5.0 to 2.0 mmol/l in nine patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (HbAlc range 6.7-10.3%, duration of diabetes 5-18 years, autonomous neuropathy present in three of the patients). The responses were studied once with metoprolol and once with placebo, in random order. With the beta 1-selective blockade, epinephrine release was triggered at a significantly higher (p less than 0.02) plasma glucose level (3.5 mmol/l) than it was with placebo (3.0 mmol/l). Metoprolol did not change thresholds for growth hormone (3.7/3.5 mmol/l), cortisol (2.9/2.9 mmol/l), glucagon (2.8/2.8 mmol/l) or for pancreatic polypeptide (2.8/2.7 mmol/l). The peak responses of epinephrine and growth hormone were significantly higher (p less than 0.01) with the beta 1-blockade. Metoprolol did not change the thresholds for neuroglycopenic and autonomic symptoms. Six out of the seven patients who answered yes to having hypoglycemia did so at a higher blood glucose with metoprolol than without. In our study, the beta 1-selective blockade altered the responses of counterregulatory hormones, but it did not change the thresholds for hypoglycemic symptoms.", 
    "12": "Variceal formation and rupture are dreaded complications of chronic liver disease and portal hypertension. The pharmacologic treatment of portal hypertension should be able to stop as well as to prevent variceal hemorrhage. There are two principal types of vasoactive drugs in the treatment of portal hypertension: vasoconstrictors and vasodilators. Vasoconstrictors reduce the splanchnic blood flow, thereby decreasing the portal blood flow and portal pressure. Vasodilators act by different mechanisms, including by relaxation of myofibroblasts in the fibrous septa and presinusoidal areas of the liver and by direct vasodilation of the collateral circulation. In addition, paradoxically, they could decrease portal flow and pressure by inducing a baroreflex-mediated mesenteric arterial vasoconstriction. A miscellaneous group of drugs is also available. These drugs reduce the blood flow and pressure in the gastroesophageal variceal system by mechanisms other than vasoconstriction or vasodilation. The success of these pharmacologic agents is limited once the varices have ruptured. The use of beta-blockers in the prophylaxis of the first variceal bleeding has been proven of benefit in this respect. Future research should be aimed at elucidating the role that humoral and endothelial factors play in development of the hyperdynamic circulatory state that characterizes patients with portal hypertension. Once these etiologic factors have been identified and new knowledge is acquired about their role in the complications of chronic liver disease, the challenge will rest on developing novel pharmacologic therapies specifically targeting these factors.", 
    "13": "Results from prospective controlled trials do not justify the use of either prophylactic shunt surgery or sclerotherapy for the prevention of initial variceal bleeding. Use of nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers has been shown to reduce significantly the risk of first variceal hemorrhage, but their effect on survival is marginal. Because only 25% to 40% of patients with cirrhosis and varices experience variceal bleeding, is it justified to place all patients with varices on beta-blocker therapy? The answer lies in the identification of a high-risk population (i.e., patients with large varices and endoscopic red color signs) and patients who can tolerate and will be compliant with therapy. The duration of therapy required is unknown and perhaps requires a lifetime commitment. Future research will involve the use of combinations of pharmacologic agents to reduce further portal pressure and perhaps the use of pharmacologic agents and sclerotherapy. The goal of a significant improvement in survival is yet to be obtained.", 
    "14": "Recurrent variceal hemorrhage occurs in 50% to 80% of cirrhotic patients who survive a variceal bleeding episode. The aim of preventing rebleeding is to improve survival by reducing the mortality associated with rebleeding; however, although shunt surgery is the most effective treatment to prevent recurrent bleeding, it does not increase survival and is associated with an increased incidence of chronic portosystemic encephalopathy. The distal splenorenal shunt is associated with a reduced incidence of encephalopathy, compared with nonselective shunts, but the true magnitude and longevity of this effect is still controversial. beta-Blockers reduce the incidence of rebleeding, but the effect is modest, and there is little or no effect on mortality when compared with no treatment. Injection sclerotherapy reduces the incidence of rebleeding and improves survival when a schedule of both emergency and long-term injection is compared with no sclerotherapy. No technical variation of injection sclerotherapy has been shown to be superior to another. Endoscopic variceal banding may result in fewer complications but the efficacy is similar to that of injection sclerotherapy. Trials of long-term sclerotherapy versus beta-blockers show very similar mortality and rebleeding rates. Addition of beta-blockade to sclerotherapy does not confer any advantages when compared with sclerotherapy alone. Improvements in pharmacologic therapy, such as the addition of isosorbide mononitrate to propranolol, may in the future make drug therapy the first treatment option to prevent rebleeding. Shunt surgery is superior to sclerotherapy in preventing rebleeding and has a similar mortality; however, liver transplantation is technically more difficult in shunted patients, but shunts do not adversely affect overall survival after transplantation. There are few data to allow optimal selection of a particular therapy or sequence of therapies to prevent variceal rebleeding for any individual patient. This will need to be studied in large trials and is a major issue in the current clinical management of cirrhotics who have bled from varices.",

    "16": "We measured ligand binding to the beta-adrenergic receptor from porcine adipocytes using tritiated radioligands, dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and CGP-12177 (CGP), and an iodinated radioligand, cyanopindolol (ICP). Binding was measured in a crude plasma membrane preparation. Equilibrium saturation binding was regular for all three ligands; the Kd were approximately 4,000 pM for DHA, 600 pM for CGP, and 100 pM for ICP. Binding was stereospecific with each radioligand. Association of each radioligand was relatively rapid; dissociation was rapid and complete for DHA, initially rapid but ultimately incomplete for CGP, and minimal for ICP. The Kd estimated from kinetic data were approximately 1,000 pM for DHA and 100 pM for CGP. The receptor did not bind phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, except at concentrations greater than 10(-5) M. Propranolol was bound to the receptor with a Ki of approximately 8 nM regardless of the radioligand used. Metoprolol, a purported beta 1-adrenergic specific antagonist, was bound to the receptor with a Ki of approximately 300 nM when the radioligands were CGP or ICP but with a Ki of approximately 1,000 nM when the radioligand was DHA. The Ki for ICI 118,551, a purported beta 2-adrenergic specific antagonist, were approximately 500 nM when the radioligands were DHA or CGP but 125 nM when the radioligand was ICP. Thus, the choice of radioligand can influence the characterization of the beta-adrenergic receptor being studied.", 
    "17": "Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia frequently coexist and may require concomitant drug treatments. The efficacy and safety profile of lovastatin given in the presence of antihypertensive medication was evaluated using patient subgroups identified in the Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) Study. The EXCEL study examined 8,245 patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia randomly assigned either to a group treated with lovastatin (20-80 mg daily) or to a group given placebo for 48 weeks. After adjustment for patient characteristics, pairwise comparisons were made between patients taking no antihypertensive agents (n = 3,772) and those taking either calcium antagonists (n = 446), selective beta 1-adrenergic receptor blockers (n = 326), nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (n = 219), potassium-sparing diuretics (n = 187), thiazide diuretics (n = 126), or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 171). The placebo-corrected dose-dependent effect of lovastatin on the percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not attenuated in any subgroup and was slightly enhanced in the calcium antagonist subgroup (-29% to -44%, p = 0.06) when compared with patients taking no antihypertensive agents (-24% to -40%); this difference, however, was only of borderline significance. Patterns of lovastatin-induced increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decrease in triglycerides were not consistently different among the subgroups. Examination of mean changes in serum transaminases, mean changes in creatine kinase, and the proportion of patients discontinuing therapy for clinical adverse experiences did not indicate the presence of an interaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "To examine the association between the level of treated blood pressure and the incidence of myocardial infarction, we conducted a population-based case-control study of 912 members of a health maintenance organization who were receiving standard clinical treatment for hypertension. We found a J-shaped relationship between the most recently measured diastolic blood pressure and the risk of myocardial infarction, the lowest risk occurring at 84 mm Hg. The relative risk of myocardial infarction at 60 mm Hg was 2.07 (95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 5.01), and at 100 mm Hg, 1.45 (95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 2.06). Treated systolic pressure bore a linear relationship to the risk of infarction. We conclude that the optimum target range for diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients may be 84 to 90 mm Hg. Levels outside this range may be associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction.",

As research continues to provide more information about the pathophysiologic process of ischemic heart disease, new procedures, diagnostics, and management techniques will continue to emerge. In considering the long-term management of patients with stable angina, the primary role of the nurse is in providing relevant information regarding the management of anginal symptoms and related lifestyle modifications. Integrating knowledge of the disease process and its treatment into nursing practice will achieve a comprehensive plan of nursing care that addresses the physiologic, psychosocial, and educational needs of the patient and family members.", 
    "20": "The agonist-induced reduction of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) cell surface density is a well documented phenomenon. The mechanisms responsible for this regulation have been well characterized for the beta 2AR. They include a rapid sequestration of the receptor away from the cell surface in a vesicular compartment and a longer term down-regulation of the total beta 2AR number. In contrast, very little is known about the cell surface regulation of the beta 1AR. In the present study, we have compared the agonist-mediated regulation of beta 1- and beta 2AR in Chinese hamster fibroblasts transfected with the cDNA encoding either beta AR subtype. Cells expressing similar numbers of the two beta AR subtypes were selected for the study. The expressed receptors exhibit typical beta 1- and beta 2AR selectivity for agonists and antagonists, as assessed by radioligand binding. Both receptors were found to be positively coupled to the adenylyl cyclase stimulatory pathway, but marked differences in the receptor regulation profiles were observed. Treatment of the cells expressing the beta 2AR with the agonist isoproterenol leads to a rapid sequestration of greater than 30% of the receptors away from the cell surface into a light vesicular fraction, where they are inaccessible to the hydrophilic ligand CGP-12177. In contrast, virtually no agonist-induced sequestration is observed in the cells expressing the beta 1AR. Longer exposure of the cells to isoproterenol leads to a time-dependent reduction in the total number of beta ARs in both beta 1- and beta 2AR-expressing cell lines. However, this down-regulation is significantly slower in the cells expressing the beta 1AR. In fact, no appreciable down-regulation of the beta 1ARs is detected in the first 4 hr of agonist treatment, compared with a down-regulation of greater than 50% of the beta 2ARs for the same period. After a 24-hr treatment with isoproterenol, less than 20% of the original number of beta 2ARs remain, whereas 60% of the beta 1ARs are still present after the same treatment. These results, therefore, suggest that, when expressed in an identical cell line, beta 1AR and beta 2AR follow distinct patterns of regulation. In fact, both agonist-induced sequestration and down-regulation are considerably blunted for the beta 1AR, compared with the beta 2AR.", 
    "21": "Abdominal cramps and urgent defecation are common side effects of clinical doses of arginine vasopressin, indicating that the drug may have stimulating effects on colonic motor activity. Four strain-gauge transducers were implanted on the colon in six monkeys. A blood flow probe was fixed on the inferior mesenteric artery. After a 1-hour control recording, vasopressin, 0.13, 1.3, or 13.0 ng.kg-1.min-1, was infused intravenously for 90 minutes. The frequency of basal colonic contractions was reduced with increasing doses of vasopressin, but their mean amplitude and duration were not altered. Giant migrating contractions associated with defecation were initiated by the highest dose of vasopressin. Atropine had no effect on these giant migrating contractions but completely inhibited normal phasic contractions. Hexamethonium completely inhibited both giant migrating contractions and phasic contractions. Parasympathetic denervation of the colon did not inhibit giant migrating contractions initiated by vasopressin. Our findings suggest that the physiological concentrations of serum vasopressin present perioperatively may transiently inhibit spontaneous colon contractions but are unlikely to be the major cause of postoperative ileus. The giant migrating contractions initiated by vasopressin may account for the defecation associated with pharmacological doses of vasopressin. The initiation of giant migrating contractions by vasopressin may be mediated through a neural pathway.", 
    "22": "It has been suggested that QT dispersion recorded on the surface electrocardiogram may be a predictor of arrhythmic events in patients with congenital QT prolongation. To evaluate this, 9 patients (6 female, mean age 17.6 years) with congenital long QT syndromes, all of whom had syncope and documented torsades de pointes, were studied. Patients were studied off treatment and during therapy with beta-blocking agents. Three patients were also studied after left stellate ganglionectomy. An age-matched control group was also studied. Good quality 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded from all patients. For each lead, QT and RR intervals were measured, and QTc value was calculated. QT and QTc dispersions were calculated for each patient. Patients had a significantly longer mean QT interval compared with that of the control group (450 +/- 100 vs 359 +/- 63 ms; p = 0.015) at similar mean RR intervals (736 +/- 231 vs 783 +/- 289 ms), with a longer mean QTc value (0.53 +/- 0.08 vs 0.41 +/- 0.02 s1/2; p = 0.004).

It is shown that the proliferation increased in all the tissues examined, except the submandibular gland. The injection of obsidan before and during immobilization led to a decrease and delay of DNA synthesis (the intestine, liver), short-term proliferative inhibition (kidney), to stimulation of stress-inhibited proliferation (submandibular gland). It is suggested that the pattern of tissue adaptive response is defined by beta-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "24": "By using a pair of silver/silver-chloride electrodes it was possible to record, simultaneously, the atrial electrogram and the atrial contractile force of rat atria, in an organ bath, containing Krebs-Ringer solution (30 degrees C, pH 7.4, bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). Addition of toxin Ts-gamma, purified from Tityus serrulatus scorpion venom, into the bath (1 microgram/ml), evoked complex effects characterized by an initial reduction of both rate and contractile force, followed by increase of force and reduction of rate and finally by reduction of both rate and force. The increase of contractile force was prevented by metoprolol and is, therefore, adrenergic in nature. The reduction of rate was concomitant with changes in the atrial electrogram in which a positive P wave was replaced by a diphasic P wave, while the positive Ta wave was depressed. Experiments with tetrodotoxin, atropine and physostigmine indicate that these effects are due to the release of acetylcholine from vagal endings.",

Prazosin and lidocaine partially inhibited the effect of 15-Me-PGE1, while reducing Na+ concentration in the medium to 50 mM almost completely inhibited the positive chronotropic effect of the analog. 5. Calcium channel blocker, nicardipine, decreased the positive chronotropic effect of 15-Me-PGE1 in a concentration-dependent manner. 6. These results were taken as an evidence for the specific and unique effect of 15-Me-PGE1 in the guinea-pig sinoatrial node interacting with Na+ and Ca2+ fluxes probably through their specific exchangers.", 
    "26": "Rats were exposed to forced-running stress for 1 day, 3 days or a long term (approximately 2 weeks), and beta-adrenergic receptor binding was then assayed using [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) in six brain regions and the liver. In the pons + med.obl., hypothalamus and midbrain, a reduction in beta-adrenergic receptor density was first evident on day 1. In contrast, a decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor density in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus was first evident on day 3. Decreased [3H]DHA binding in the pons + med.obl., cerebral cortex and hippocampus subsequently plateaued for the duration of the forced-running stress. In the midbrain and hypothalamus, however, decreased [3H]DHA binding subsequently returned to control levels despite the exposure to the forced-running stress. In the cerebellum and the liver, [3H]DHA binding did not change significantly throughout the stress. These results indicate that the forced-running stress induces both the time- and region-specific changes in beta-adrenergic receptors. Moreover, the rats showed either a behavioral depression or a spontaneous recovery of running activity during the 2 weeks following the end of the long-term stress. Thus, we also examined the relationship of beta-adrenergic receptors to these behavioral differences. [3H]DHA binding for the behavioral depression group was lower in the hippocampus and higher in the liver than for the spontaneous recovery group.", 
    "27": "The effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol on action potentials and membrane currents were studied in single guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. The experiments were carried out using the nystatin-method of whole-cell technique. This method was used in order to prevent the run-down of the calcium current. Metoprolol at concentrations of 10-100 mumol/l shortened action potential in a dose-dependent way. The drug only decreased resting membrane potential at a concentration of 100 mumol/l in two out of five cells. Under voltage-clamp conditions, metoprolol blocked the high threshold calcium current at concentrations of 30 and 100 mumol/l to 82 +/- 4% and 73 +/- 5% from control, respectively. The drug decreased the inward rectifying potassium current in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was evident for inward current at voltages negative to the apparent reversal potential and for outward current at voltages between -30 and -80 mV. This blocking effect on the inward rectifying potassium current can explain the effect on resting membrane potential. At voltages positive to -30 mV metoprolol increased a time-independent outward current. This metoprolol-enhanced outward current was blocked by barium and cesium. This result suggests that the metoprolol-enhanced current is carried by potassium. The current component enhanced by metoprolol was not sensitive to glibenclamide and tetraethylammonium applied externally, which suggests that the adenosine triphosphate-sensitive channel is not the target of metoprolol. The activation of this time-independent outward current by metoprolol and the blocking effects on the calcium current seem to explain the shortening in action potential induced by the drug.", 
    "28": "1. We studied the effects of chronic calcium antagonist (calcium entry blocker, CEB; nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem) treatment on beta-adrenoceptor density (assessed by (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol [ICYP] binding) and subtype distribution in right atria from 65 patients without apparent heart failure undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CAD-patients) and from 13 patients with moderate heart failure (NYHA class III to class III-IV) undergoing mitral valve replacement (MVD-patients). 2. In CAD-patients atrial beta-adrenoceptor density was 79.3 +/- 7.9 fmol ICYP bound mg-1 protein (n = 18), the beta 1:beta 2-adrenoceptor ratio 69:31%. Chronic CEB-treatment did not affect either atrial beta-adrenoceptor density or beta 1:beta 2-adrenoceptor ratio. 3. In contrast, in CAD-patients chronically treated with beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists (atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol) and CEB, atrial beta-adrenoceptor density was significantly increased (108.6 +/- 10.5 fmol ICYP bound mg-1 protein, n = 21); this increase was due to a selective increase in beta 1-adrenoceptors. 4. In MVD-patients atrial beta-adrenoceptor density (55.5 +/- 8.7 fmol ICYP bound mg-1 protein, n = 7) was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than in CAD-patients; beta 1:beta 2-adrenoceptor ratio, however, was not changed (67:33%). Chronic CEB-treatment of MVD-patients did not prevent the decrease in atrial beta-adrenoceptors. 5. We conclude that chronic CEB-treatment does not affect human right atrial beta-adrenoceptor density, either in patients without apparent heart failure or in patients with moderate heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "The present study evaluated the effect of a conditioned aversive stimulus (CS) on the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis in Lewis rats. Experiment 1 showed that presentation of a CS, on days 12, 14, and 16 following injection with adjuvant containing mycobacterium tuberculosis, resulted in a pronounced suppression of the development of arthritis as measured by a clinical disease severity rating scale and spleen weight. In contrast, presentation of the CS on days 0, 2, and 4 following injection did not have any effect on the development of arthritis. Experiment 2 showed that the suppression of adjuvant arthritis by exposure to the CS was blocked by administration of propranolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. These results demonstrate that a CS can alter the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis, but the effect is dependent upon the timing of the antigen exposure and the presentation of the CS. Moreover, the present findings suggest that blocking beta-adrenergic receptors during presentations of the CS prevents the suppressive effect of the CS.", 
    "30": "The effect of cold stress on immunocompetence was investigated in mice intragastrically intubated with sheep red blood cells. Cold stress was found to consistently augment total IgG and IgM production by splenic lymphocytes. In addition, antigen-specific IgM production by cultured splenic lymphocytes obtained from cold stressed animals was enhanced compared to unstressed mice. However, serum levels of total and antigen-specific immunoglobulins were suppressed or unaltered following cold stress. The alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine, could block the effects mediated by cold stress while the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, potentiated the action of cold stress. Taken together, the data indicate cold stress-mediated enhancement in immunoglobulin production by orally immunized animals takes place through the activation of alpha-adrenergic pathways. The results also suggest alpha- and beta-adrenergic pathways independently regulate antibody production following oral administration of antigen. These observations illustrate the integrative nature of the immune and neuroendocrine systems.", 
    "31": "We have shown previously that norepinephrine (NE) microdialyzed into the preoptic area of conscious guinea pigs evokes a fall in core temperature (Tco) that is mediated by a reduction in metabolic rate. To identify the adrenoceptor subtype(s) involved in this effect, we microdialyzed intrapreoptically various adrenergic agonists or antagonists singly or in combinations. Tco and ear skin temperatures of the animals were monitored throughout the experiments. alpha 1-, beta-, beta 1-, and beta 2-agonists and antagonists did not induce significant Tco changes. Although the alpha 2-antagonists yohimbine (Yoh) and rauwolscine (Rau) did not have thermal effects per se, the alpha 2-agonist clonidine evoked dose-dependent Tco falls that were abolished by codialyzed Yoh and Rau. The microdialysis of NE evoked, as before, a 0.7 +/- 0.2 degrees C Tco fall; it was abolished by the codialyzed alpha-antagonist phentolamine, Yoh, and Rau but not by the beta-antagonist propranolol. No adrenoceptor agonist induced changes in ear skin temperature. These results indicate that the hypothermizing effect of intrapreoptically microdialyzed NE is achieved by a reduction in metabolic heat production, mediated by alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "32": "The distribution of the beta 1 (beta 1) and beta 2 (beta 2) subtypes of the beta-adrenergic receptor was examined in rat and nondiseased control human tissue. The distribution of the beta 1 and beta 2 receptors was also examined in schizophrenic cases, with additional studies in schizophrenic suicide and nonschizophrenic suicide cases. Scatchard analysis of the binding of [125I]iodopindolol (IPIN) to cortical membranes showed a similar Kd in human (177 pM) and rat (161 pM), but a lower maximum binding site (Bmax) in the human tissue (18.7 fmol/mg protein and 55.6 fmol/mg protein). For the autoradiographic studies [125I]IPIN was used to visualize both subtypes (total) or was displaced with the selective beta 1-receptor antagonist ICI-89,406 to visualize beta 2 sites, or with the selective beta 2-receptor antagonist ICI-118,551 to visualize beta 1 sites. Important differences in the regional distribution of the two subtypes of the beta-adrenergic receptors were noted between rat and human. In the nucleus accumbens and ventral putamen (ventral striatum), a patchy distribution of beta 1 receptors was observed that was not evident in the rat. These patches were aligned with markers of the matrix compartment of the striatum. The schizophrenic cases showed significant increases in the labeling of the beta 1-receptor patches with [125I]IPIN. In contrast to the frontal cortex of the nondisease controls, the parietal and temporal cortex showed a high ratio of beta 1 to beta 2 receptors and a highly laminar organization of the subtypes. [125I]IPIN binding to beta 1 receptors was highest in the external laminae with the reverse gradient for the beta 2 subtype. The medial temporal cortex displayed an alteration in the ratio of the 2 subtypes of the beta-adrenergic receptor, with the parahippocampus and hippocampus of the human, in contrast to the rat brain, predominantly expressing the beta 2 receptor. Moreover, there were consistently higher densities of beta 2 receptors in the hippocampus of the right hemisphere than the left hemisphere of the nondisease controls. There was not a left and right hemispheric asymmetry of beta 2 receptors in the hippocampus of elderly schizophrenics or in young schizophrenics who committed suicide. The asymmetry was evident in nonschizophrenic suicides, suggesting that the lack of asymmetry in the hippocampus of schizophrenics is evident early in the disease process. Thus limbic structures show alterations in the patterning of beta 1 and beta 2 receptors in the schizophrenic cases.", 
    "33": "Single freshly isolated smooth muscle cells of adult bovine trachea were voltage clamped, and the calcium inward current was separated from K+ currents by blocking the large outward currents with intra- and extracellular Cs+ and extracellular tetraethylammonium chloride. Isoproterenol stimulated peak calcium current (ICa) in a dose-dependent manner through the beta-adrenergic receptor. The isoproterenol effect was not mediated or caused by the stimulation of a K+ or Na+ current, a decrease in the intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ or H+, the stimulation of the Na(+)-H+ or the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger. Neither basal nor isoproterenol-stimulated ICa was affected by internal dialysis of the cell with adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), cAMP analogues, or the catalytic subunit of cAMP-kinase. Internal dialysis of the cells with guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) blocked the stimulation of isoproterenol whereas dialysis with guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) induced an isoproterenol-like maximal increase of ICa. These results show that the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulates the L-type calcium current of isolated tracheal smooth muscle cells independent of cAMP and cAMP-kinase through a GTP/GDP regulated protein.", 
    "34": "1. To test whether almitrine might improve the arterial partial pressure of O2 in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease by improvement of ventilation-perfusion matching, we looked at the interaction between hypoxic and almitrine-induced vasoconstriction in isolated rat lungs perfused with blood at constant flow. Increases in pressure represented increases in resistance. 2. Almitrine, given in increasing doses between challenges with 2% O2, enhanced hypoxic vasoconstriction at low doses but attenuated it at high doses. 3. Stimulus-response curves to hypoxia of increasing severity gave a sigmoid curve. 4. Almitrine solvent caused small changes in pulmonary artery pressure and shifted the stimulus-response curve slightly in a parallel fashion. 5. Small doses of almitrine enhanced the action of mild to moderate hypoxia, medium doses attenuated moderately severe hypoxia, whereas high doses depressed vasoconstriction due to all degrees of hypoxia. 6. These effects of almitrine on hypoxic vasoconstriction were compared with the effect of solvent by analysis of variance; the results substantiated significant enhancement of hypoxia by small doses and attenuation by large doses. 7. In patients, if similar effects apply, small doses of almitrine would assist ventilation-perfusion matching, but large doses might worsen it. 8. Almitrine-induced vasoconstriction was attenuated by a fall in perfusate temperature in a similar manner to hypoxic vasoconstriction. It was also attenuated by three drugs, chlorpheniramine, propanolol and diethylcarbamazine, all of which also decrease hypoxic vasoconstriction. The similarity between hypoxic and almitrine-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction is further confirmed.", 
    "35": "The activation of adenosine A1 receptors in DDT1-MF2 smooth muscle cells resulted in both the inhibition of agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation and the potentiation of norepinephrine-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Pharmacological analysis indicated the involvement of an A1 adenosine receptor subtype in both of these responses. In the absence of norepinephrine, the activation of the adenosine receptor did not directly stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The adenosine receptor-mediated augmentation of norepinephrine-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was pertussis toxin sensitive and was selectively antagonized by agents that mimicked cAMP (8-bromo-cAMP) or raised cellular cAMP levels (forskolin). This initially suggested that cAMP might partially regulate the magnitude of the phospholipase C response to norepinephrine and that adenosine agonists might enhance the phospholipase C response by reducing cAMP levels. However, neither the reduction of cellular cAMP levels by other agents nor the inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was sufficient to replicate the action of adenosine receptor activation on phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Thus, in the presence of norepinephrine, adenosine receptor agonists appear to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis via a pathway that is separate from, but dependent upon, that of norepinephrine. This second pathway can be distinguished from that which is stimulated by norepinephrine on the basis of its sensitivity to inhibition by both cAMP and pertussis toxin.", 
    "36": "The apparent affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors for timolol in the sinus node and ventricular myocardium was compared in 11 normal male subjects. Sinus nodal function was assessed by heart rate, and left ventricular systolic function was assessed by Doppler-derived aortic blood flow acceleration. The dose of isoproterenol required for a heart rate or acceleration increase of 35% (I35) was determined before and 2 hours after an oral 10 mg dose of timolol. The apparent affinity constant (ka) for timolol binding to the receptor was calculated from the serum timolol concentration and the ratio of the I35 after timolol/I35 before timolol. The I35 for sinus node and ventricular myocardium were not significantly different from one another. The ka for timolol binding to the sinus node (1.14 x 10(6) mol/L), however, was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) than ka for ventricular myocardium (7.85 x 10(5) mol/L). These findings suggest that beta-adrenergic receptors in the sinus node may have an overall greater affinity for beta-blocking agents than do receptors in the ventricular myocardium.", 
    "37": "In order to investigate the general cause of beta-adrenergic receptor neuroeffector abnormalities in the failing human heart, we measured ventricular myocardial adrenergic receptors, adrenergic neurotransmitters, and beta-adrenergic receptor-effector responses in nonfailing and failing hearts taken from nonfailing organ donors, subjects with endstage biventricular failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), and subjects with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) who exhibited isolated right ventricular failure. Relative to nonfailing PPH left ventricles, failing PPH right ventricles exhibited (a) markedly decreased beta 1-adrenergic receptor density, (b) marked depletion of tissue norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y, (c) decreased adenylate cyclase stimulation in response to the beta agonists isoproterenol and zinterol, and (d) decreased adenylate cyclase stimulation in response to Gpp(NH)p and forskolin. These abnormalities were directionally similar to, but generally more pronounced than, corresponding findings in failing IDC right ventricles, whereas values for these parameters in nonfailing left ventricles of PPH subjects were similar to values in the nonfailing left ventricles of organ donors. Additionally, relative to paired nonfailing PPH left ventricles and nonfailing right ventricles from organ donors, failing right ventricles from PPH subjects exhibited decreased adenylate cyclase stimulation by MnCl2. These data indicate that: (a) Adrenergic neuroeffector abnormalities present in the failing human heart are due to local mechanisms; systemic processes do not produce beta-adrenergic neuroeffector abnormalities. (b) Pressure-overloaded failing right ventricles of PPH subjects exhibit decreased activity of the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase, an abnormality not previously described in the failing human heart.", 
    "38": "It has previously been reported that aortic smooth muscle cells cultured from old rats have a marked decline in beta-adrenergic stimulated cAMP accumulation. We wished to confirm this observation and determine whether this decline was secondary to loss of beta-adrenergic receptors (BAR). Primary cultures of aortic and mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells were obtained by enzymatic digestion from young and old male Fischer 344 rats. In aortic cells from old animals, there was a decline in beta-adrenergic receptor density and a rightward shift in the dose response curve to isoproterenol without a change in maximal cAMP accumulation. In mesenteric artery cells, there were no age changes in these parameters. Beta-adrenergic receptor subtype distribution was determined and was similar between all age groups and vessel types. These findings differ from whole tissue studies and suggest that cultured smooth muscle cells have limitations as a model for the aging adrenergic system.", 
    "39": "The role of the alpha subunit of the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase (GS alpha) in the down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors by pindolol was studied in S49 cyc- cells (normally GS alpha-deficient) transfected to express functional recombinant rat GS alpha. An inducible cell line (S49 GS alpha IND) was derived from S49 cyc- cells transfected with a vector containing the full-length coding sequence of GS alpha under the inducible control of the mouse mammary tumor virus long-terminal repeat promoter. GS alpha was not detectable in S49 GS alpha IND cells by immunoblot or by ADP-ribosylation in the presence of cholera toxin and [alpha-32P]NAD. When cells were grown in 100 nM dexamethasone, isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation increased within 3 h. After 15 h, GS alpha was present at a level 40-50% of that found in S49 wild-type (WT) cells as measured either by immunoblot analysis or by [alpha-32P]ADP-ribosylation. Membranes prepared from GS alpha IND cells grown in the presence of dexamethasone bound agonist with high affinity, and this binding was sensitive to guanine nucleotides. A second vector, DzbGS alpha +, contained the coding sequence of GS alpha under the constitutive regulatory control of the SV40 early promoter. This vector was introduced into cyc- cells, and the resulting cells, S49 GS alpha CST cells, expressed GS alpha at a level comparable to that found in S49 WT cells as measured by immunoblot analysis. Isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in S49 GS alpha CST cells was at least as great as in S49 WT cells. When cells were grown in the presence of dexamethasone, exposure to 50 nM pindolol for 12 h down-regulated the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in S49 WT cells to 60% of that in cells grown in the absence of pindolol, but pindolol had no effect on the density of receptors on cyc- or GS alpha IND cells. When GS alpha CST cells were exposed to 50 nM pindolol for 12 h, the density of beta-adrenergic receptors was down-regulated by the same amount as in S49 WT cells. These results suggest that GS alpha is necessary to restore the ability of pindolol to down-regulate beta-adrenergic receptors in S49 cyc- cells and that the protein must be expressed at a level comparable to that found in S49 WT cells.", 
    "40": "Maternal and feto-placental Doppler flow velocity waveforms were studied during acute and chronic antihypertensive therapy in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension. Eight primigravidae were acutely treated with oral nicardipine. Diastolic blood pressure fell at 30, 45 and 60 min after nicardipine. The uteroplacental systolic/diastolic ratio rose significantly at 30 min, but this change was no longer apparent at 60 min. Umbilical artery and maternal brachial artery systolic/diastolic ratios were unchanged. Fifteen patients with mild pre-eclampsia were chronically treated with oral pindolol. Diastolic blood pressure fell significantly within 24 h. The uteroplacental systolic/diastolic ratio rose 3 days after pindolol. Brachial artery or umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratios were unchanged. A control group of 15 patients with untreated mild pre-eclampsia showed a significant rise in uteroplacental and umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratios within 7 days of starting recordings. In patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension, acute and chronic blood pressure reduction was associated with no change in umbilical artery or maternal brachial artery Doppler systolic/diastolic ratios and a transient rise in the uteroplacental systolic/diastolic ratio.", 
    "41": "The antiarrhythmic actions of low and high doses of U-50,488H, a selective kappa-receptor agonist, were examined in pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rats subjected to occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. At a high dose (16 mumol/kg) U-50,488H reduced blood pressure, heart rate and prolonged the P-R and QRS intervals of the electrocardiogram. This dose reduced the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias produced by occlusion. The blood pressure, heart rate, ECG and antiarrhythmic actions of a high dose of U-50,488H were not antagonized by 8 mumol/kg naloxone, a dose which had no cardiovascular or ECG actions. Naloxone alone reduced arrhythmia incidence but to a lesser extent than U-50,488H. A low dose (0.2 mumol/kg) of U50,488H in the absence or presence of naloxone had no effect on arrhythmias. Thus, U-50,488H had antiarrhythmic actions at a high dose which were independent of opioid receptors.", 
    "42": "A primary culture of rat type II pneumocytes was used for the pharmacological and functional characterization of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. The beta-adrenoceptor agonists, isoprenaline, dobutamine and procaterol concentration dependently increased the secretion of phosphatidylcholine. These effects were attenuated by propranolol. The effect of dobutamine was attenuated by atenolol, and that of procaterol by ICI 118,551. Isoprenaline-induced secretion was attenuated by the combination of the two blockers but not by each one alone. In conclusion, both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes mediate phosphatidylcholine secretion in rat type II pneumocytes.", 
    "43": "Two populations of [3H]CGP 12177 binding sites exist in rat interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) plasma membranes. The majority of binding sites are of low affinity with a Kd of 31 nM, a value in close agreement with that for the Kd of [3H]CGP 12177 binding to a cloned rat beta 3-adrenergic receptor (AR) expressed in CHO cells (44 nM). Competition binding studies demonstrate that the Ki values of the cloned rat beta 3-AR and of the low affinity sites in IBAT are 45 and 29 nM, respectively, for BRL 37344 and 1.4 and 1.0 microM, for (-)-propranolol. These findings strongly suggest that the low affinity [3H]CGP 12177 binding site measured in IBAT plasma membranes represents the atypical beta 3-AR in this tissue.", 
    "44": "The mechanism of selective inhibition of propranolol hydroxylations after multiple administration of the drug was investigated by metabolic inhibition studies in rat liver microsomes. The time course of irreversible binding of a reactive metabolic intermediate(s) of propranolol to liver microsomal protein, which was proposed as the cause of the impairment of enzymatic activities, had a delayed phase followed by a rapid linear rise, while the unmetabolized propranolol remaining in the reaction mixture showed a rapid linear decrease immediately after the onset of incubation. Thus, it was conceivable that the reactive intermediate(s) was not always formed directly from the parent drug, propranolol. Among four primary metabolites of propranolol, 4-hydroxypropranolol was the most potent inhibitor of propranolol hydroxylase activities, and this inhibition was much enhanced by preincubation of 4-hydroxypropranolol with NADPH. The type of inhibition kinetics of propranolol 5- and 7-hydroxylase activities by 4-hydroxypropranolol was changed from a competitive type to a non-competitive type by the preincubation. These results suggest that a reactive metabolite(s) of propranolol which impaired propranolol hydroxylase activities is a further metabolite(s) of 4-hydroxypropranolol.", 
    "45": "The present study shows that ANS (1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate), propranolol, isoprenaline, adrenaline and dopamine have common binding sites on AAG (alpha 1-acid glycoprotein). A fluorescence technique was employed to characterize the interaction between the ligands and AAG at 20-22 degrees. The binding of ANS to AAG caused increased fluorescence intensity at emission and excitation wavelengths of 400 and 470 nm. In this situation, propranolol displaced ANS in a concentration-dependent mode with an apparent dissociation constant of 6.2 +/- 0.01 microM, whereas isoprenaline did not reduce the ANS-AAG fluorescence. However, in the presence of AAG, catecholamines caused a marked increase of fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 250 and 325 nm, respectively. These wavelengths were employed to characterize the binding of isoprenaline, adrenaline and propranolol to AAG. Two subsets of binding sites were demonstrated. The Kd values were 0.87 +/- 0.03 and 25.1 +/- 10.7 microM for ANS, 0.76 +/- 0.09 and 133 +/- 30.4 microM for propranolol, 140 +/- 14 and 2.18 +/- 0.58 mM for isoprenaline, 137 +/- 24 and 14.8 +/- 0.1 mM for adrenaline, respectively. AAG had identical high affinity binding capacity for these ligands (n approximately 1). However, the second class of binding sites showed ligand-dependent binding capacity: n = 1 for ANS, n approximately 10 for propranolol, n approximately 15 for adrenaline, n approximately 20 for isoprenaline, respectively. ANS, propranolol, dopamine and adrenaline caused concentration-dependent inhibition of isoprenaline binding to AAG with apparent dissociation constants of 5.1 +/- 1.8 microM, 6.4 +/- 1.1 microM, 0.57 +/- 0.13 mM and 1.5 +/- 0.46 mM, respectively.", 
    "46": "The atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and atrial and ventricular chronotropic effects of the stereoisomers of propranolol, pindolol, metoprolol and penbutolol were studied in conscious atrio-ventricular blocked dogs. Atrial beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity was assessed for all the drugs against isoprenaline. All the drugs except dextro-pindolol lengthened AERP and decreased ventricular rate dose relatedly. At comparable levels of atrial beta-adrenoceptor blockade, dextro-propranolol, dextro-metoprolol and dextro-penbutolol were more potent to induce AERP lengthening than their respective levo-isomers, whereas dextro-pindolol was less potent than levo-pindolol. In addition, levo-pindolol and levo-metoprolol were more potent to produce ventricular bradycardia than the corresponding dextro-isomers, whereas the levo- and dextro-isomers of propranolol and penbutolol were equipotent. These results confirm that the ventricular bradycardia induced by the different beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is partly due to ventricular beta-adrenoceptor blockade and to the membrane stabilizing activity of these drugs, and partly to another as yet unknown factor seen especially with the levo-isomers and particularly marked with metoprolol.", 
    "47": "Receptor autoradiography was used in guinea-pig heart to locate binding sites for the beta-adrenoceptor ligand (-)[125I]cyanopindolol (CYP) resistant to blockade by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)-propranolol (1 microM). Highly localized binding was observed to regions closely associated with the sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node and bundle of His but was not observed on myocardial, pacemaker, conducting cells or adipose tissue. Free [125I] also bound to identical sites. Binding was enhanced in the presence of ascorbic acid but was completely inhibited by (-)-isoprenaline (100 microM), serotonin (5-HT) (10 microM) and phentolamine (10 microM).", 
    "48": "The soluble core of catecholamine storage vesicles in the adrenal medulla contains high concentrations of the cations calcium (20 mM) and catecholamine (600 mM). Do these cations interact with the abundant vesicle core anionic proteins, the chromogranins? We investigated the binding of calcium and norepinephrine (NE) to bovine adrenal chromogranins by equilibrium dialysis. Both calcium and NE were bound saturably by chromogranins, with low affinity (Kd values of 1.3 x 10(-4) M and 2.1 x 10(-3) M), but high capacity (17 and 32 mol of ligand/mol of chromogranin A). Both ligands bound maximally at a pH greater than 5.5 and were displaced by competing cations in a pattern (trivalent greater than divalent greater than monovalent) consistent with electrostatic components to the interactions. Binding of calcium and NE was not impaired by prior heat denaturation of the chromogranins, and chromogranin A was involved in both binding reactions. Calcium but not NE binding was enhanced by nonpolar solvents. Temperature dependence studies indicated that calcium binding to chromogranins was largely entropy-driven, while NE binding was driven by a significantly negative (favorable) change in enthalpy (5760 cal/mol), even in the face of an unfavorable entropy. Exposure of chromogranins to calcium or NE resulted in precipitation (aggregation) as analyzed by centrifugation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. NE was a more effective chromogranin precipitant than calcium, and in combination, the NE effect was antagonized by calcium. Precipitation of chromogranins by both calcium and NE was inhibited by NaCl at ionic strengths comparable with those of the ligands. These data suggest that chromogranins bind and are precipitated by calcium and NE at affinities compatible with their in situ concentrations, but that the interactions exhibit different thermodynamic driving forces. Furthermore, NE may trigger an enthalpy-driven conformational change in chromogranins, resulting in aggregation.", 
    "49": "The efficacy of intravenous sotalol (1 mg/kg) for suppressing inducibility of supraventricular tachycardias (SVT) with different electrophysiologic mechanisms was studied in 30 consecutive patients referred for an electrophysiologic study because of paroxysmal SVT. Orthodromic SVT using accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection was inducible in 14 patients, AV nodal reentrant SVT in 8, and intraatrial SVT in 8 before administration of sotalol, Isometric handgrip exercise facilitated the inducibility of SVT in 8 patients who were noninducible at rest. After intravenous sotalol, 7 of 14 patients (50%) with orthodromic SVT, 8 of 8 (100%) with AV nodal reentrant SVT, and 8 of 8 (100%) with intraatrial reentrant SVT became noninducible into sustained SVT, Isometric exercise facilitated the inducibility of only 3 nonsustained SVT runs after sotalol infusion, and exercise did not reverse the prolongation of refractory periods of the atrium, AV node, accessory pathway and ventricle caused by sotalol. During a mean follow-up period of 18 +/- 7 months, none of the 14 patients who remained noninducible into sustained SVT during the stress test after intravenous sotalol and tolerated long-term oral sotalol therapy had recurrence of symptomatic SVT. Thus, sotalol is efficacious for suppressing SVT with AV nodal or intraatrial reentrant mechanism, but less efficacious in patients with accessory AV pathway. The beta-blocking and cellular antiarrhythmic effects of sotalol are not significantly reversed by exercise.",

A specific antiserum recognizing the carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic domain of the receptor was developed, characterized, and used for immunocytochemical localization of receptors in fixed cells by conventional fluorescence and confocal fluorescence microscopy. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced redistribution of receptors from the surface of cells into small (less than 1 micron diameter) punctuate accumulations which were detected in cells within 2 min of agonist addition. The time course of receptor redistribution paralleled that of receptor sequestration measured by ligand binding, and receptor redistribution was reversible in the presence of the beta-adrenergic antagonist alprenolol. Optical sections imaged through cells by confocal microscopy localized receptor accumulations within the cytoplasm. To address the question of receptor internalization further, a mutant receptor possessing an engineered antigenic epitope in the amino-terminal hydrophilic domain was constructed, transfected into cells, and localized using both a monoclonal antibody recognizing the epitope tag (receptor ectodomain) and an antiserum recognizing the carboxyl terminus (receptor endodomain). In untreated cells most receptor antigen was detected at the cell surface, as assessed by accessibility to ectodomain antibodies in unpermeabilized specimens. In isoproterenol-treated cells, however, little receptor antigen was detected at the cell surface. Punctate receptor accumulations present in isoproterenol-treated cells were labeled by antibodies only following permeabilization of cells, as expected if these receptor accumulations were intracellular. Finally, internalized beta-adrenergic receptors colocalized with transferrin receptors, which are markers of endosomal membranes. These data provide several lines of evidence establishing that beta-adrenergic receptors undergo ligand-regulated internalization, they suggest that internalized receptors may be recycled back to the cell surface, and they provide the first direct indication that these processes involve the same endosomal membrane system passaged by constitutively recycling receptors.", 
    "59": "It has long been established that the inner membrane of plant mitochondria is permeable to Cl-. Evidence has also accumulated which suggests that a number of other anions such as Pi and dicarboxylates can also be transported electrophoretically. In this paper, we present evidence that anion uniport in plant mitochondria is mediated via a pH-regulated channel related to the so-called inner membrane anion channel (IMAC) of animal mitochondria. Like IMAC, the channel in potato mitochondria transports a wide variety of anions including NO3-, Cl-, ferrocyanide, 1,2,3-benzene-tricarboxylate, malonate, Pi, alpha-ketoglutarate, malate, adipate, and glucuronate. In the presence of nigericin, anion uniport is sensitive to the medium pH (pIC50 = 7.60, Hill coefficient = 2). In the absence of nigericin, transport rates are much lower and much less sensitive to pH, suggesting that matrix H+ inhibit anion uniport. This conclusion is supported by measurements of H+ flux which reveal that \"activation\" of anion transport at high pH by nigericin and at low pH by respiration is associated with an efflux of matrix H+. Other inhibitors of IMAC which are found to block anion uniport in potato mitochondria include propranolol (IC50 = 14 microM, Hill coefficient = 1.28), tributyltin (IC50 = 4 nmol/mg, Hill coefficient = 2.0), and the nucleotide analogs Erythrosin B and Cibacron Blue 3GA. The channel in plant mitochondria differs from IMAC in that it is not inhibited by matrix Mg2+, mercurials, or N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The lack of inhibition by Mg2+ suggests that the physiological regulation of the plant channel may differ from IMAC and that the plant IMAC may have functions such as a role in the malate/oxaloacetate shuttle in addition to its proposed role in volume homeostasis.",

On the basis of the trial data, combined systolic and diastolic hypertension was defined as a sustained systolic pressure greater than 160 mmHg and diastolic pressure greater than 90 mmHg. There is convincing evidence that efforts should be made to reduce both systolic and diastolic pressures to below these levels in patients up to the age of 80 years. Isolated systolic hypertension was defined as a systolic pressure greater than 160 mmHg in the presence of a diastolic pressure less than 90 mmHg. Two trials reported benefit from the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension in patients up to the age of 80, and further trials are underway to support or refute this recommendation. Diuretics have an established role in the management of hypertension in elderly patients; beta adrenoceptor antagonists have given variable results, and the benefits are less impressive than with diuretic based regimens. Newer agents show promise in the treatment of elderly patients, particularly in the presence of coexisting disease, but their effects on morbidity and mortality have not been evaluated in large randomised trials.",

Eight hypertensive patients receiving regular treatment with beta blockers were randomized in a double-blind crossover study to receive pyridostigmine (30 mg 3 times daily) or placebo for 2 days. Heart rate and blood pressure in the supine and standing positions were recorded every 2 hours during the day, and 24-hour Holter monitoring was performed. In addition, a symptom-limited exercise test was performed, and plasma catecholamine levels were determined at rest and at peak exercise. Pyridostigmine, as compared with placebo, did not induce any significant effect on heart rate, plasma catecholamine levels or resting blood pressure. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased in accordance with exercise intensity (p less than 0.01), although a significantly lower diastolic blood pressure was observed when pyridostigmine was used (average decrease 5 mm Hg compared with placebo; p less than 0.01). No clinical adverse reactions were observed, confirming the relative safety of the combination of low-dose pyridostigmine with beta-adrenergic blocking agents.",

These effects, which were not reproduced by 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, seemed to result from an activation of adenylate cyclase.

    "67": "The risk for cardiovascular complications is already substantially increased in persons with borderline elevation of arterial pressure (141-159/90-94 mmHg and transiently below). It increases progressively with higher grades of hypertension. The main aim of treatment is thus a significant improvement in survival for the patient. Persons with raised blood pressure (BP) have often additional cardiovascular risk factors such as deranged carbohydrate metabolism, dyslipidemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, smoking and others. Treatment of hypertensive patients should thus not only normalize BP but should at the same time reduce associated risk factors or at least not increase them. Conventional antihypertensive treatment based on thiazides in high doses or beta-blocking agents led to marked reduction of strokes and heart failure, but did not satisfactorily reduce coronary heart disease or sudden cardiac death. It has been suspected that other cardiac risk factors are insufficiently influenced or eventually even deteriorated by conventional therapy, thus counteracting partly a beneficial effect of lowered BP. Beta-blockers however have at least a secondary preventive effect after myocardial infarction. Newer antihypertensive drugs such as ACE-inhibitors, calcium antagonists and alpha 1-blockers reduce left ventricular hypertrophy and are at least neutral with regard to metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates. The non-thiazide diuretic indapamide and the serotonin (S2-) blocker ketanserin likewise are neutral with regard to glucose and lipid metabolism. The efficacy of these new drugs regarding long term survival is as yet undetermined. Persisting borderline or established hypertension should as a rule always be approached with basic non-pharmacologic measures: loss of overweight, reduction of alcohol intake, exercise, avoidance of high salt foods, abstention from smoking and withdrawal of BP-raising drugs. If antihypertensive medication is indicated, potential first line drugs are ACE-inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, thiazides at low dose, indapamide, ketanserin, the alpha 1-blocker prazosin and others; initially as monotherapy, if needed in combinations of 2 or 3.

There was no major difference between the effects of the two drugs on any measure investigated. Both compounds reduced neuronal activity in a concentration-dependent manner, with BMY 7378 being slightly more potent than NAN-190. The threshold concentrations eliciting inhibitory effects were 1 nM for BMY 7378 and 3 nM for NAN-190. Complete inhibition occurred at concentrations close to 30 nM. The effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin) could be antagonized when concentrations of NAN-190 or BMY 7378 were used that were too low to produce a marked inhibition. At concentrations close to threshold both compounds potentiated the inhibitory effects of 3 nM 8-OH-DPAT. The suppression of neuronal firing induced by NAN-190 and BMY 7378 could be completely antagonized with propranolol, indicating that the inhibitory actions of both drugs were not primarily due to alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonism. By applying theorems of receptor theory the intrinsic activities for both NAN-190 and BMY 7378 were calculated to be in the range of 0.1-0.3. Thus, NAN-190 and BMY 7378 are partial agonists in the rat dorsal raphe nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "79": "The aim of the present study in rat spinal cord synaptosomes was to compare the pharmacological characteristics of the serotonin (5-HT)1B receptor defined by [125I]iodocyanopindolol [( 125I] ICYP) binding and the 5-HT autoreceptor defined by inhibition of [3H]-5-HT release. In Percoll gradient Fractions 3 and 4 of spinal cord synaptosomes, a single saturable binding site for [125I]ICYP with a maximum binding of 70 and 134 fmol/mg, respectively, was demonstrated in the presence of 30 microM isoproterenol. The Kd of 0.16 nM did not vary between fractions. Competition for [125I]ICYP binding by various 5-HT agonists and antagonists also indicated a single site model based on a Hill coefficient of approximately 1.0. The most potent compounds at displacing [125I]ICYP binding were RU 24969 (5-methoxy-3-[1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl]-1H-indole), 5-carboxyamidotryptamine HCl, 5-methoxytryptamine, 5-HT and CGS 12066B (7-trifluoromethyl-4(4 methyl-1-pyrolo[1,2-a]-quinoxaline malate). [125I]ICYP binding was not altered by compounds with activity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C, 5-HT2, 5-HT3 or alpha-2 receptor sites. Similar to the pharmacological characteristics of the 5HT1B site defined by [125I]ICYP, compounds most active at inhibiting 15 mM K(+)-stimulated release of [3H]-5-HT were RU24969 = 5-carboxyamidotryptamine HCl = CGS 12066B greater than 5-methoxytryptamine greater than 5-HT. Compounds with activity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C, 5-HT2 or 5-HT3 sites were inactive. A correlation analysis of selective 5-HT1B compounds comparing the pKD for displacement of [125I]ICYP vs. the IC50 for inhibition of [3H]-5-HT release demonstrated the pharmacological similarity of the presynaptic inhibitory 5-HT autoreceptor and the 5-HT receptor site defined by [125I]ICYP binding in spinal cord synaptosomes (r = 0.791, P = .0193). Although [125I]ICYP binding was unaltered, alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine, norepinephrine and UK 14304 [5-bromo-6-[2-imidazolin-2-ylamino]-quinoxaline) as well as the alpha-2 antagonists rauwolscine and yohimbine also decreased the K(+)-stimulated release of [3H]-5-HT and phentolamine, an alpha-2 antagonist increased release. The action of these alpha-2 compounds to alter [3H]-5-HT release suggests the presence of heteroreceptors localized on 5-HT terminals in the spinal cord. These results point out that [125I]ICYP identifies the 5-HT1B receptor, and affinity of compounds for this site predicts action at the 5-HT1B autoreceptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

This relaxation was reduced by 9.1 +/- 1.9 and 19.4 +/- 2.8% by atropine (1 microM) and combined atropine and propranolol (both 1 microM), indicating that the main component is mediated by i-NANC neural mechanisms. In the branch PA rings, this i-NANC relaxation was unaffected by pretreatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin, 10 microM), 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor (A63162, 1 microM) or substance P desensitization, but was inhibited markedly by the P2y-purinoceptor antagonist reactive blue 2 (30 microM) and slightly potentiated by the peptidase alpha-chymotrypsin (2 U/ml). L-NG-monomethyl-arginine(L-NMMA), a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor, caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the i-NANC relaxation (53.9 +/- 4.1% at 100 microM), but had no effect on equivalent nitroprusside-induced relaxation. The inhibitory effect of L-NMMA was reversed completely by L-arginine (300 microM), but not by D-arginine (300 microM).

Only metoprolol significantly reduced heart rate and rate-pressure product at the ischemic threshold during exercise. In the group of patients treated with nifedipine no significant improvement was observed in exercise tolerance or in number of ischemic episodes/24 h. Moreover, the subset of nonresponders in the two methods was larger than in the other two groups. In some of these patients a clearcut worsening of total ischemic load was observed, despite the control of symptoms. This adverse effect might be attributed to the different consequences of the vasodilatory effect of nifedipine on blood flow through stenosed vessels.",

A significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure was observed with both nondrug therapy (-8.0 +/- 1.08 mm Hg) and propranolol (-9.5 +/- 1.46 mm Hg) compared to placebo (-0.1 +/- 2.01 mm Hg). However, only patients receiving nonpharmacologic therapy showed a reduced body mass index, lower total and low-density lipoprotein serum cholesterol levels, and increased exercise tolerance compared to both propranolol and placebo. Patients receiving propranolol felt less anxious and unsure but showed a significant decrement in nocturnal penile tumescence compared to both placebo and nondrug therapy. Patients receiving nondrug therapy felt more energetic and reported improved sexual arousal and greater sexual satisfaction after treatment. Reductions in blood pressure in the nondrug treatment group were related to both weight reduction and improved fitness. We conclude that nondrug therapy is effective in controlling blood pressure in men with mild hypertension and is associated with improvements in weight, lipoprotein levels, and exercise tolerance compared to both propranolol and placebo. Quality of life assessments further support the use of nondrug therapy in this context.", 
    "83": "Acute postoperative hypertension (APH) has been documented in the PACU. Over half of the patients who exhibit APH have pre-existing primary hypertension. Sustained blood pressure (BP) elevation increases the risk of myocardial ischemia, infarction, surgical site bleeding, or cerebral hemorrhage in these patients.

Some direct perioperative stimulants include pain, anxiety, hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypothermia, shivering, volume overload, and bladder distension. Nursing interventions are directed toward identifying and relieving the cause of APH. Antihypertensive drug therapy with vasodilators or adrenergic inhibitors is used if initial nursing interventions are not effective. Vasodilators frequently used are hydralazine, sodium nitroprusside, and nitroglycerin. Nicardipine has recently been introduced as an intravenous calcium channel blocker. Vasodilators are effective in BP reduction but may cause reflex tachycardia when used alone. Adrenergic inhibitors, such as esmolol and labetalol, block alpha and/or beta receptors to decrease heart rate and BP. Labetalol's effectiveness, relative freedom from side effects, and ease of administration have made it a useful drug in the treatment of APH.",

When pulmonary vascular tone was increased with U46619, efferent vagal stimulation decreased lobar arterial pressure in a stimulus-frequency-dependent manner. The decreases in lobar arterial pressure were enhanced by pretreatment with reserpine, were blocked by atropine, and were not altered by propranolol, indicating that the neurogenic vasodilator response was cholinergic in nature. The decreases in lobar arterial pressure in response to vagal stimulation and to exogenously administered acetylcholine were reduced after administration of L-NAME (100 mg/kg i.v.). Although L-NAME decreased pulmonary vasodilator responses to vagal stimulation and to acetylcholine, responses to adenosine, nicorandil, lemakalim, isoproterenol, prostaglandin E1, sodium nitroprusside, and 8-bromo-cGMP, agents that act by a variety of mechanisms, were not decreased.

The relative odds of CVD increased 1.39-fold (95% confidence interval 1.06-1.83) for increases in HbA1c of 1% (e.g., for HbA1c from 5 to 6%). The relationship was not weakened when known diabetic subjects or subjects taking beta-blocker or thiazide medications were excluded from analysis.

At 3 months both nifedipine and propranolol reduced the weekly angina rate (p less than 0.05); during treadmill exercise testing, increases (p less than 0.05) were noted in time to angina and total exercise time and decreases in maximal ST depression at the end of exercise. There were no differences between the responses to nifedipine and propranolol and no significant additional changes were seen after another 3 months of therapy. The combination of nifedipine and propranolol reduced the number of patients with angina on exercise treadmill testing from 64% to 38% (p less than 0.05).

From electrocardiograph tracings, respiratory sinus arrhythmia was quantified by the ratio between the longest R-R interval during expiration and the shortest one during inspiration (E/I ratio), and the 4-second exercise test by the ratio between the last R-R interval before and the shortest one during exercise (B/C ratio). In 29 healthy subjects there was a correlation (R = 0.60, p less than 0.05) between the responses to the two tests. In a group of six healthy subjects the same tests were performed after autonomic blockade with intravenous atropine and/or propranolol. The heart rate rise during the 4-second exercise test was nearly abolished by atropine (mean +/- SD) (B/C: control = 1.53/0.33; after atropine = 1.04/0.03), whereas RSA was diminished to a lesser extent (E/I: control = 1.59/0.24; after atropine = 1.13/0.07). beta-adrenoceptor blockade did not affect the test ratios (after propranolol: B/C = 1.51/0.33 and E/I = 1.45/0.14). Successive tests during the following hour after atropine infusion showed a somewhat faster recovery of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia than the heart rate acceleration induced by the 4-second exercise test (p less than 0.05). We conclude that there may be some difference in the mechanisms which contribute to the heart rate changes in these two autonomic cardiovascular tests; these remain to be clarified. The 4-second exercise test may be an alternative to the respiratory sinus arrhythmia test in the non-invasive evaluation of cardiac parasympathetic activity.", 
    "89": "Lipospheres carrying timolol (1) were obtained from microemulsions. They had lecithin, palmitic and decanoic acids as the main constituents. The sizes were between 300 and 400 nm and the amount of 1 incorporated varied from 2.7 to 4.8% according to the microemulsion used. Compound 1 was present in the lipospheres mainly as ion pairs in order to increase its lipophilicity. The difference found in the incorporation was principally due to the different lipophilicity of the ion pairs of 1.", 
    "90": "Twelve healthy male subjects completed this randomized, placebo controlled, four-period crossover trial to determine the effect of verapamil, diltiazem, and labetalol on the bioavailability and metabolism of imipramine. Subjects received a 7-day course of one of four treatments; verapamil (120 mg every 8 hr), diltiazem (90 mg every 8 hr), labetalol (200 mg every 12 hr), or placebo (every 12 hr) during each study period. Imipramine (100 mg) was administered orally on the morning of day 4 of each study period. Plasma and urine samples were collected periodically over the ensuing 96 hours. Samples were assayed by HPLC for imipramine, desipramine, 2-hydroxyimipramine, and 2-hydroxydesipramine. Verapamil, diltiazem, and labetalol increased imipramine area under the plasma concentration time curve (relative bioavailability) as compared with placebo by 15%, 30%, and 53%, respectively. Verapamil and diltiazem did not demonstrate consistent changes in the formation of the measured metabolites. Labetalol caused a significant decrease in the amount of imipramine metabolized to 2-hydroxyimipramine (mean decrease: 22%) and from desipramine to 2-hydroxydesipramine (mean decrease: 8%). The molar ratios of plasma AUC of 2-hydroxyimipramine and 2-hydroxydesipramine to the parent compounds were significantly decreased. Since these metabolic processes are dependent on the cytochrome P450IID6 isozyme, these data suggest that labetalol decreases the oral clearance of imipramine by inhibiting this system. All three of these commonly used agents decreased the oral clearance of imipramine. These drug interactions could lead to elevated imipramine concentrations and have the potential for clinically important adverse events.", 
    "91": "Acebutolol (AC) is a chiral beta-blocker that is metabolized to an equipotent chiral metabolite, diacetolol (DC). A stereoselective disposition of AC and DC enantiomers has recently been reported in young healthy subjects. As many physiologic properties affecting drug disposition are progressively altered with increasing age, the effect of aging on the pharmacokinetics of AC and DC enantiomers were investigated in nine subjects ranging from 60 to 75 years after administration of an oral 200-mg dose of racemic AC. Increasing age resulted in a significant prolongation of the elimination t1/2s of R- (r = 0.913) and S-DC (r = 0.811). Also, the S:R ratios of AC urinary excretion (sigma Xu) of enantiomers was significantly correlated with age (r = 0.677). Contribution of declining renal function to age-associated pharmacokinetics changes was subsequently examined. Renal clearance and cumulative urinary excretion of both AC and DC enantiomers were positively correlated with creatinine clearance. In addition, declining creatinine clearance was associated with a subsequent decline in the enantiomer S:R ratio of AC in plasma (AUC S:R, r = 0.807) and urine (sigma Xu S:R r = 0.807). Similarly, a progressive decline in the S:R ratio of DC collected in urine was evident (r = 0.689). Age-related changes in the enantiomers ratios may suggest that an active stereoselective pathway such as renal tubular secretion or nonrenal excretion may be affected in the elderly.", 
    "92": "It has been reported that tracheal smooth muscle of guinea pig is innervated by both the adrenergic and nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) inhibitory nervous system. However, NANC inhibitory nerve supply to the lower airway of guinea pig has not yet been demonstrated in in vivo experiments. We performed the present study to evaluate the physiological role of NANC inhibitory nerves in tracheal smooth muscle of guinea pig in vitro, and in anesthetized guinea pigs in vivo. Innervation of NANC inhibitory nerves to tracheal smooth muscle was much greater than that of adrenergic nerves (77.8 +/- 3.8%, 22.2 +/- 3.8%, respectively, p less than 0.01). Neither decrease in RL nor increase in CL, however, was observed with vagal stimulation during serotonin infusion after the administration of propranolol. The role of NANC inhibitory nerves in histamine-induced bronchoconstriction (HIB) was investigated. HIB was enhanced by vagotomy in guinea pig pretreated with propranolol (p less than 0.01). These results suggest the role of the NANC inhibitory nervous system in the attenuation of HIB in vivo in the guinea pig.", 
    "93": "In urethane-anesthetized, tubocurarine-immobilized and artificially ventilated rats, microinjection of L-glutamate (Glu) into hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (NPV) or locus coeruleus (LC) induced a pressor response. The LC-pressor response could be attenuated by preinjection of phentolamine or propranolol into bilateral NPV; Preinjection of phentolamine or bicuculline into bilateral NPV could also attenuate the depressor effect of A1-excitation by Glu, but preinjection of propranolol had no such effect; suggesting that the LC-pressor or A1-depressor effect is mediated partly by NPV, and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in NPV may be involved in A1-depressor response.", 
    "94": "An assumption of previous models of hepatic elimination is that there is negligible axial diffusion in the liver. We show, by construction of a stochastic model and analysis of published data, that compounds which are readily diffusible and partitioned into hepatocytes may undergo axial tissue diffusion. The compounds most likely to be affected by axial tissue diffusion are the lipophilic drugs for which the cell membranes provide little resistance and which are highly extracted, thereby creating steep concentration gradients along the sinusoid at steady state. This phenomenon greatly modifies the availability of the compound under conditions of altered hepatic blood flow and protein binding. For moderately diffusible compounds, these relationships are similar to those predicted by the simplistic venous-equilibrium model. Hence, the paradoxical ability of the venous-equilibrium model to describe the steady-state kinetics of lipophilic drugs such as lidocaine, meperidine, and propranolol may be finally resolved. The effects of axial tissue diffusion and vascular dispersion on hepatic availability of drugs are compared. Vascular dispersion is of major importance to the availability of poorly diffusible compounds, whereas axial tissue diffusion becomes increasingly dominant for highly diffusive and partitioned substances.", 
    "95": "Cerebral uptake and utilization of levodopa was measured in eight patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) by [beta-11C]-L-DOPA and positron emission tomography (PET). By adding pharmacological doses of unlabelled levodopa to the radioactive solution it was possible to evaluate the clinical effect simultaneously with the cerebral kinetics of the drug. Additionally, in two of the patients with advanced PD, investigations with the dopamine re-uptake blocker [11C]-(+)-nomifensine and PET were carried out to get a measure of the density of striatal dopaminergic nerve-terminals. The brain uptake of [beta-11C]-L-DOPA was inversely correlated to the sum of large neutral amino acids in plasma. In the eight PD patients studied with [beta-11C]-L-DOPA striatal k3, which reflects the ability for striatal tissue to decarboxylate the tracer by the action of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), was decreased 35% compared to healthy subjects. It was demonstrated that, in the patients with advanced PD and motor fluctuations on oral L-DOPA medication, reversal of parkinsonian symptoms occurred at very low striatal tissue dopamine concentrations. In the two very advanced patients studied with [11C]-(+)-nomifensine the striatal binding of the tracer was 50% reduced.", 
    "96": "In the Romano-Ward syndrome, an inherited form of abnormally prolonged QT duration is the matter of concern. The frequency-corrected QTc value in the ECG amounts to more than 0.44 s (upper mean value: 0.44 s). Persons suffering from Romano-Ward syndrome are vitally endangered by attacks of arrhythmia, syncope, and cardiac arrest that are triggered or aggravated by stress or certain drugs. In obstetrical anesthesia, attention should be paid to the fetus, which, due to the genetic dominance, will have a 50% probability of having the disorder. A 28-year-old para I was admitted with cervical dilation on her predetermined date of delivery. Romano-Ward syndrome had been diagnosed 10 years earlier; the patient had been free of complaints and had received no treatment. Due to cephalopelvic disproportion and the cardiac syndrome, a primary cesarean section was performed. Following premedication and provision of a beta-blocker, defibrillator, and drugs for resuscitation, intubation anesthesia with methohexital, nitrous oxide, enflurane, and succinylcholine was carried out. The QTc values were pathologically prolonged (0.47 s; 0.48-063 s) during the pre- and intraoperative period. Hemodynamic irregularities did not occur in the perioperative period. The newborn was vital (3,830 g, 50 cm; Apgar scores 10/10/10; umbilical cord pH 7.29). Directly postpartum isolated supraventricular extrasystoles occurred, and the QTc duration increased to 0.51 s. Simultaneous registration of the ECG and phonocardiogram showed premature occurrence of the second cardiac sound, which is typical of Romano-Ward syndrome.", 
    "97": "The impact of hostility was examined in relation to the conduct and results of a clinical field trial. Data were derived from a multi-center randomized double-blind study of the comparative effects of antihypertensive therapy (captopril, methyldopa and propranolol) on the quality of life of 620 hypertensive men. Hostility levels were higher in subjects reporting skipping medication dosages compared to those reporting they always complied with the medication schedule. Reporting of symptoms often associated with antihypertensive drug regimens was positively related to hostility scores throughout the study, even during the blinded placebo period. Persons with high hostility scores showed the greatest decline in blood pressure independent of type of antihypertensive medication. However, there was some limited evidence that hostility levels were significantly reduced by one antihypertensive medication. Overall, the present findings suggest that double-blind pharmacologic clinical trials may benefit from using reliable measures of hostility as covariates in the evaluation of symptom reports and amount of blood pressure reduction.", 
    "98": "1. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to examine the effects of the class III antidysrhythmic agent, clofilium, on voltage-activated delayed rectifier K+ currents (IKv) in undifferentiated mouse neuroblastoma x rat glioma hybrid (NG 108-15) cells. Ca(2+)-activated K+ currents also seen in these cells were abolished by bath application of 4 mM Co2+. 2. Bath application of clofilium (0.3 to 70 microM) caused dose-dependent, irreversible inhibition of IKv in these cells. Under control conditions, activated currents were sustained during 200 ms depolarizing steps, but in the presence of clofilium, or after its wash-out, currents were reduced in amplitude and showed a time-dependent decay. 3. Clofilium blockade of IKv was voltage-dependent; the degree of current inhibition increased with increasing depolarizations. The transient nature of IKv seen in the presence of clofilium was also more apparent at higher test potentials. 4. The effects of clofilium were use-dependent: when cells were left unstimulated during drug application, and then depolarizations were resumed, several pulses were required for clofilium blockade to reach a steady level. Similar results were obtained post-clofilium, when cells were unstimulated during application and then removal of clofilium, suggesting that although the blocking action of the drug was use-dependent, it bound to the closed, delayed rectifier K+ channel. 5. High concentrations (100 or 300 microM) of sotalol, another class III antidysrhythmic agent, were without discernible effects on IKv in NG 108-15 cells. 6. The effects of clofilium on a neuronal IKv described here, and its possible mechanism of action, are compared with previously reported effects of clofilium on the cardiac IKv.", 
    "99": "In a prospective, randomized, masked study the effect of sodium hyaluronate (Healon) and timolol on the acute intraocular pressure rise after extracapsular cataract extraction with implantation of a posterior chamber lens were evaluated. Intraocular pressure was measured preoperatively and 3-6 h and 24 h postoperatively. When no timolol was used, a significant rise in intraocular pressure was observed at 3-6 h, whether or not Healon was aspirated. Timolol reduced the intraocular pressure rise, especially during the first 3-6 h after surgery. When timolol was not applied at the end of surgery, IOP exceeded 30 mmHg in 28% 3-6 h postoperatively, compared to only 4% when timolol was applied.", 
    "100": "To evaluate whether antianxiety drugs enable guilty subjects to appear innocent on polygraph tests, we compared the effects of diazepam, meprobamate, and propranolol on the outcome of a guilty knowledge test (GKT). Seventy-five undergraduate students were evenly divided among one innocent and four guilty groups. Subjects in each of the guilty groups received either one of the drugs or a placebo prior to the administration of the GKT and after viewing a videotape that depicted a burglary as seen from the perspective of the burglar. The results showed that drug status had no influence on the outcome of the GKT. Innocent subjects who coincidentally obtained high scores on a recognition memory test covering details of the mock crime tended to obtain higher guilt scores on the GKT.", 
    "101": "Nineteen men (mean age 44 years) with essential hypertension, WHO stage I, were studied invasively at rest and during exercise. Blood pressure was recorded intra-arterially (brachial artery), cardiac output by dye dilution method and heart rate by electrocardiography. After initial pre-drug recordings, the patients received 25 mg carvedilol orally and central haemodynamics at rest and during exercise were recorded 1 and 2 h after tablet intake to evaluate the immediate effects of carvedilol. The results indicated a combined beta-blocking and vasodilating effect. After 6-9 months of treatment, supine haemodynamics were recorded 12-24 h after the last dose and then 1 and 2 h after an additional 25 mg dose. During chronic treatment (2 h after last dose at rest supine) mean arterial pressure was reduced by 17% (P less than 0.001) and total peripheral resistance index by 6% (NS) while heart rate and cardiac index were reduced by 12%. Exercise haemodynamics demonstrated a fall in blood pressure of 17% (P less than 0.001). Exercise stroke index increased by 5% (NS), partly compensating for the reduction in heart rate of 17%. Total peripheral resistance index was reduced by 5% (NS). It is concluded that carvedilol is an effective anti-hypertensive agent in a large proportion of patients with essential hypertension. The haemodynamic mode of action reflects an alpha 1-blocking activity, particularly in situations with low sympathetic tone. During exercise the beta 1-blocking activity (demonstrated by the reduction in heart rate) is more prominent.", 
    "102": "The effects of various physicochemical parameters on the changes in drug delivery rate produced by an electrophoretic current are examined using a model system. It was shown that ionic strength has an inverse relationship with the change in delivery rate produced by a given current. Small changes in pH were measured during electrophoresis experiments which were considered to be insignificant. Drug reservoir concentration selection is critical in the design of an electrophoretic device and is based on achieving a balance between providing a suitable reservoir and allowing adequate electrophoretic control. Electrophoretic control is affected by temperature in a manner which can be predicted using the Arrhenius relationship. The low power requirements of the model system demonstrate the feasibility of using the principle of electrophoresis to control drug delivery rates in a therapeutic system.", 
    "103": "Using oxprenolol HCl as a model drug, the effects of pH and buffer concentration on the swelling and drug release properties in cross-linked poly(methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (PMMA/MAA) beads have been investigated. The kinetics of swelling of such hydrophobic anionic gel beads from the dehydrated state appear to be governed primarily by a diffusion-ionization process which becomes more ionization-controlled at higher buffer concentrations. Within the range of ionic compositions studied, the swelling rate increases and the initial swelling/ionization front penetration becomes increasingly linear in time with increasing pH or buffer concentration of the swelling medium. The corresponding swelling bead diameter appears to reach an equilibrium value as soon as the penetrating ionization fronts meet at the center, suggesting a swelling equilibrium in the ionized shell due to rapid mechanical readjustment in the gel phase. At oxprenolol loading levels up to 15%, both the transient drug release and swelling bead diameter exhibit extended quasi-linear regions despite the inherent limitation of decreasing surface area at the penetrating front in the spherical geometry. In addition, both the drug release and the dimensional changes reach completion when the penetrating ionization fronts meet at the center, suggesting a true swelling-controlled drug release behavior.", 
    "104": "The four most popular classes of antihypertensive drugs may all be considered suitable choices when initiating treatment for hypertension. The practitioner must decide which agent is appropriate for each individual patient. The main goal of treatment should be to prevent coronary events and stroke, while preserving quality of life. A 40% reduction in stroke can probably be achieved with any antihypertensive treatment, a reduction in coronary events is much harder to achieve. Available evidence from studies in men, summarized in this review, indicates that beta-blockade is superior to thiazide diuretics for the prevention of coronary events. Clinical trials have not yet produced long-term prognostic data on the effects of ACE-inhibitors or calcium antagonists on coronary events in hypertensive patients. A recent review on calcium antagonists in post-MI patients concluded that the results were disappointing, as pooled data actually showed a trend towards increased mortality with calcium antagonists as compared with placebo. Because of the large number of hypertensive patients at increased risk for coronary events in the community, the difference observed in coronary events between beta-blockade and other first-line drugs in hypertension (24%) may have important implications for clinical practice. This overall conclusion, however, has to be accepted with some reservations in view of the following observations. Firstly, no reduction in sudden death has been observed with the hydrophilic beta-blockers. Secondly, no reduction in coronary mortality in the smoking subgroup has been observed with the non-selective beta-blockers. Thus, it seems that the prevention of coronary events is more likely to be observed in patients given beta-blockers with certain pharmacological characteristics: relative lipophilicity, which enables passage of the beta-blocker through the blood-brain barrier to exert effects on pertinent central nervous beta 1-receptors. This is potentially useful in reducing the risk of sudden death. The addition of beta 1-selectivity is important for the risk reduction in smokers. Cardioselectivity is also an advantage in relation to side-effects and quality of life. The reduced risk for coronary events with certain beta-blockers is probably independent of the reduction in blood pressure: possible mechanisms studied are cardiac anti-ischaemic effects, antifibrillatory effects, antiatherosclerotic and anti-thrombotic effects.", 
    "105": "Thirty patients received topical application of either timolol ophthalmic solution 0.25%, or normal saline, 2 h before elective ophthalmic surgery in a double-blind study. The responses to suxamethonium and tracheal intubation were compared by measuring intra-ocular pressure before induction of anaesthesia, 1 min after administration of thiopentone 2-4 mg.kg-1, 1 min after administration of suxamethonium 1 mg.kg-1, and 1, 2.5 and 5 min after tracheal intubation. There was no significant difference between the groups.", 
    "106": "The active and passive deformation of a blood vessel is related to the stress in it. Any analysis of stress and strain must begin with the zero-stress state. Recent reports on large blood vessels such as the aorta, pulmonary arteries, and vena cava have shown that, at zero-stress state, blood vessels are not tubes, but opens sectors. This report presents data on the zero-stress state of small blood vessels with lumen diameters down to approximately 50 microns. Zero-stress state of a vessel was obtained by cutting the vessel into rings and then the rings into sectors; each sector is characterized by an opening angle, alpha. In rat ileal and plantar arterioles, the opening angles are in the order of 100-250 degrees; those in the venules are in the order of 50-100 degrees. The effect of norepinephrine on the opening angle alpha is minor; it decreases alpha of the superior mesenteric artery, and increases alpha of the ileocecocolic and ileal arteries. EDTA has little effect on alpha of arteries greater than 100 microns in diameter, but decreases alpha of arteries less than 100 microns. The physiological meaning of the opening angle is demonstrated in terms of the residual strains in a vessel at the no-load state and homeostatic strains at normal blood pressure. The strains in real vessels are compared with those in hypothetical vessels having an opening angle of zero. It is shown that ignoring the opening angle will cause a large error in strain evaluation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
