Long-acting propranolol treatment was associated with reductions of assaultive behavior without apparent sedative effects. Cautions are noted regarding potential undesirable side effects which may necessitate careful patient monitoring during treatment.", 
    "1": "We evaluated the effects of esmolol, a short acting (t1/2 beta = 9 min) beta-blocker on hemodynamics during noxious stimulation associated with aortocoronary bypass surgery. Group E (n = 10) and P (n = 10) patients had their morning dose of beta- or calcium blockers withheld except for nifedipine, and were given infusions of esmolol (E) or placebo (P) beginning prior to anesthetic induction and continuing until mediastinal dissection. Group S (n = 10) patients received their usual medication the morning of surgery and received neither esmolol nor placebo. All patients received fentanyl infusions for anesthesia and pancuronium for relaxation. Esmolol patients had no changes in heart rate throughout the study. In contrast, significant increases in heart rate occurred during induction, intubation, and surgical stimulation in Groups P and S. Esmolol patients had a statistically significant but transient increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) after intubation, which did not require treatment. There were no significant changes in PCWP in Group S and a decrease in PCWP in Group P patients. We conclude that esmolol was effective in attenuating potentially deleterious responses to noxious stimulation during fentanyl-pancuronium anesthesia.", 
    "2": "We have studied the effects of 17 beta-estradiol on the left ventricular pressure and on the coronary perfusion pressure in isolated rabbit heart, in order to evaluate the action of this hormone on the myocardial contractility and on the coronary resistances. 17 beta-Estradiol has induced a negative inotropic effect starting from a concentration of 10(-6) M and a vasodilation starting from 10(-7) M when administered on a vasopressin-induced coronary spasm. These effects are not related to sex or to alpha-, beta-adrenergic, histaminergic, anaesthetic-like mechanisms, but seem to interfere with calcium transport.", 
    "3": "The frequency of ventricular arrhythmias increases with age. Several factors make elderly people more prone to antiarrhythmic drug toxicity. Familiarity with the changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antiarrhythmic agents may reduce or prevent adverse response in this patient population.", 
    "4": "The effects of nifedipine (60 to 90 mg/day) and propranolol (240 mg/day) on symptoms, angina threshold and cardiac function were compared in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study. Five-week treatment periods with nifedipine and propranolol were compared with 2 weeks of placebo treatment in 21 men with chronic stable angina pectoris, 13 of whom had symptoms both at rest and on exertion. Compared with placebo, New York Heart Association functional class improved in patients equally with nifedipine (p = 0.001) and propranolol (p = 0.006). Frequency of chest pain decreased with nifedipine (p = 0.001) and propranolol (p = 0.01), and nitroglycerin consumption similarly decreased with both treatments. Nifedipine significantly delayed the onset of chest pain (p = 0.01) and 1 mm of ST-segment depression (p = 0.002) during bicycle exercise; smaller increases with propranolol were not statistically significant. A preferential clinical response to nifedipine (9 patients) or propranolol (6 patients) was unrelated to the presence or absence of pain at rest or to any baseline hemodynamic finding. Nifedipine and propranolol were equally effective in relieving exertional ischemia as shown by improvements in ejection fraction at identical workloads, from 0.48 +/- 0.11 to 0.58 +/- 0.12 (p less than 0.001) and 0.56 +/- 0.14 (p less than 0.001), respectively. Exercise wall motion, assessed by a semiquantitative wall motion score, also improved with both drugs. Propranolol treatment decreased exercise cardiac output by 14% (p = 0.01) through its effect on heart rate. In contrast, nifedipine treatment had no effect on cardiac output.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "Phentolamine (Phe) prevents the induction by epinephrine (E: 1800 nmol/kg, i.v.) of lung edema (LE) in urethane-anesthetized and bivagotomized rats in a dose-related manner (from 246 to 3933 nmol/kg, i.v.). Since Phe blocks and E activates both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors, the evidence does not allow us to link LE to selective (alpha 1 or alpha 2) or non-selective (alpha 1 + alpha 2) alpha-adrenoceptor activation. Accordingly, we tried to find out whether: phenylephrine (PE), a selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, and B-HT 920, a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, would cause LE; prazosin (Praz), a selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, and yohimbine (Yoh), a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, would protect rats against LE caused by E or PE. We found that: 1) PE (from 736 to 5892 nmol/kg, i.v.), but not B-HT 920 (from 190 to 12200 nmol/kg, i.v.), caused LE, while both drugs increased arterial blood pressure; 2) Praz prevented induction of LE, whether by E (1800 nmol/kg, i.v.) or by PE (5892 nmol/kg, i.v.), in a dose-related manner (from 15 to 119 nmol/kg, i.v.). In contrast, Yoh was ineffective at doses up to 7675 nmol/kg, i.v. We conclude, therefore, that E-induced LE in urethane-anesthetized and bivagotomized rats strictly depends on alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation. The outcome of E-induced LE is usually rat death, the incidence of which depends on the dose. Since alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists rank in the same order of potency for the induction of death as for that of LE, and since Phe and Praz protect from death at LE-preventing doses, there seems to be some link between LE and death, even though protection against death is obtained with doses of antagonists lower than those abolishing induction of LE. Finally, alpha 1-agonists cause maximum arterial hypertension at all doses used, irrespective of induction of LE and of protective pretreatment against LE.", 
    "6": "Following profound (greater than 90%) depletions of norepinephrine (NE) by the noradrenergic neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4), the numbers of beta-adrenergic receptors were significantly increased (20-25%) in rat hippocampal and somatosensory cortical membranes; however, the numbers of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and the affinities of both types of receptors were unaffected. This selective up-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors was evident 1 week after DSP4 administration and was maintained for at least 2 more weeks. In electrophysiological experiments in the hippocampal slice preparation, responses to threshold as well as maximal concentrations of isoproterenol were enhanced 150% and 33%, respectively, in the DSP4-lesioned animals. The results demonstrate that nearly complete depletion of brain NE produced by administration of DSP4, like that produced by 6-hydroxydopamine, results in increased numbers of beta- but not alpha-adrenergic receptors, and suggest that the density of the former are regulated by afferent noradrenergic fibers. Furthermore, the functional significance of the increased number of hippocampal beta-adrenergic receptors is directly manifested in a greater electrophysiological responsiveness to an exogenously administered beta-adrenergic receptor agonist.", 
    "7": "Factors which regulate beta-adrenergic receptor density in non-innervated and denervated embryonic tissues have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, the effects of exposure to isoproterenol and propranolol on beta-adrenergic receptor density in the non-innervated (preneural) and partially innervated (neural) embryonic chick heart are examined. In addition, the effects of chemical and surgical sympathectomy on cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor density in the chick embryo are investigated. (125I)-pindolol was used as a receptor probe. The density of beta-adrenergic receptors in the embryonic chick heart peaks on incubation day 9 (664 fmols/mg protein) and then decreases by more than 80% by incubation day 19. Administration of propranolol or isoproterenol on incubation days 4 to 6 results in no change or a decrease (to 62% of control), respectively, in receptor density on incubation day 7. Administration of propranolol on incubation days 10 to 19 causes an increase (to 230% of control) in beta-adrenergic receptor density on day 20. Administration of isoproterenol on incubation days 10 to 16 results in a decrease (to 26% of control) in receptor density on day 17. Neither chemical sympathectomy, produced by administration of 6-hydroxydopamine, nor surgical sympathectomy, produced by removal of premigratory neural crest cells, significantly alters cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor density from control values. Administration of adrenergic drugs produces a greater change in beta-adrenergic receptor density after sympathetic innervation (day 10) than in preneural hearts. This indicates that sympathetic nerves influence the properties of beta-adrenergic receptors during embryonic development.", 
    "8": "The effect of taurine on alpha- and beta-mediated positive inotropic effects was investigated in guinea-pig ventricular strips. Loading with taurine dose-dependently antagonized the phenylephrine-induced positive inotropic effect while it was ineffective on beta-mediated positive inotropic effect. The superfusion with a taurine-free medium determined a loss of intracellular taurine, while the loading with 20 mM taurine prevented this depletion. Preincubation of cardiac membranes with different concentrations of taurine (1 to 20 mM) decreased 3H-prazosin binding, and the saturation curve obtained after preincubation of cardiac membranes with 20 mM taurine showed that taurine had a more marked effect on the number of binding sites. In both experimental models, beta-alanine did not mimic any taurine effects, suggesting that taurine actions might be specific.", 
    "9": "Previous studies performed with crude homogenates have demonstrated the presence of beta-adrenergic receptors in the rat ventral prostate. The precise localization of these receptors in prostatic tissue, however, has not been determined. The present study describes the localization of beta-adrenergic receptors using in vitro radioautography. beta-adrenergic receptors are present exclusively in the epithelial cells, while no receptors could be detected in the stromal cells. The silver grains mostly are associated with the apical pole of the glandular cells and are much less concentrated in the basal nuclear region of the epithelium. Very low concentrations of grains are found in the lumen of the acini. Castration caused a dramatic fall in the receptor concentration, while treatment with dihydrotestosterone reversed these effects. The specific presence of beta-adrenergic receptors in prostatic epithelial cells and their control by androgens suggest that they could play a physiologic role in androgen action in prostatic tissue. Moreover, the level and activity of beta-adrenergic receptors could be used as parameters of prostatic activity.", 
    "10": "Patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension (mean untreated supine blood pressure 190/112 mm Hg) received once daily enalapril 20-40 mg or atenolol 50-100 mg, supplemented if required by hydrochlorothiazide 25-100 mg, in a randomized observer-blind trial. Both regimens produced a highly significant reduction in supine and standing blood pressure. There was no significant difference in the antihypertensive effects of enalapril and atenolol when they were used as monotherapy. After hydrochlorothiazide was added to patients not achieving 'target' blood pressure, the fall in systolic pressure was significantly greater in the enalapril group than in the atenolol group, despite similar dosage of hydrochlorothiazide in the two groups. At the end of 6 months' treatment, a supine diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or below was achieved in 74% of patients on enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide and 56% of patients on atenolol plus hydrochlorothiazide. This difference was not statistically significant. A small rise in plasma urea and creatinine was observed in the enalapril group and a small rise of urea only in the atenolol group. These changes were statistically significant but of uncertain clinical importance. This study confirms that once daily enalapril and atenolol, both alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, are effective drugs in the management of moderate to severe hypertension.", 
    "11": "The authors have studied calcium 45 uptake and cAMP intracellular levels in normal and otosclerotic bone cell cultures after stimulation with calcitonin in the presence or absence of propranolol. The results seem to demonstrate that poststimulatory 45Ca incorporation is slightly different in normal and otosclerotic cell cultures, being slower but longer lasting in the latter. Propranolol administration markedly inhibits 45Ca uptake in normal cells, while in otosclerotic cells a massive intracellular penetration becomes evident after an initial inhibitory phase. Also cAMP intracellular levels behave differently; a marked increase, followed by a rapid decrease, can be detected in normal cells after stimulation with calcitonin, while in otosclerotic cells, the increase is slower and followed by a long lasting reduction. Adding propranolol reduces cAMP levels in normal cells, while it increases levels in otosclerotic cells. The different behavior of calcium metabolism and cAMP levels after stimulation with calcitonin, depending upon the presence or absence of propranolol, seems to indicate an alteration of the transducing mechanism between stimulus, receptor, and cellular effector in otosclerotic cells.", 
    "12": "The aim of this study to was to assess the feasibility of using iodopindolol to delineate myocardial beta-adrenoreceptors in vivo. Preliminary biodistribution studies indicated that binding of 131I-d,I-pindolol in the heart was stereospecific, saturable, and displaceable by I-propranolol but not by phenoxybenzamine. However, considerable nonspecific binding was encountered. Subsequently, the stereoisomer, 131I-I-pindolol, was shown to be a high affinity beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist (Kd approximately 0.37 nM) as assessed by Scatchard analysis, and one exhibiting marked specific uptake in lung and heart in rabbits. In contrast, 131I-d-pindolol exhibited no specific binding in rabbit left ventricular membrane preparations nor specific organ uptake. Gamma camera scintigraphy with both isomers demonstrated that the I-isomer accumulated in lung and heart, and that its accumulation was blocked by I-propranolol. In contrast, d-isomer uptake was nonspecific and diffuse. The results indicate that it should be possible to externally visualize receptors by differentiating specific and nonspecific binding components of a ligand in vivo with the use of radiolabeled stereoisomers.", 
    "13": "The quantitative relationship between fractional myocardial thallium uptake and radioactive microsphere-determined flow was studied in 33 open chest dogs under baseline conditions during increased coronary flow (dipyridamole), decreased coronary flow (propranolol and coronary artery stenosis), inhibition of Na-K ATPase (ouabain), and regional infarction. Myocardial contents of thallium and microspheres were compared in left ventricular (LV) biopsies taken 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min after thallium injection, expressed as fractions of injected dose. Maximal LV thallium uptake occurred 10 min after injection and the 10-min values were therefore used for subsequent comparisons. Combining all dogs, fractional LV thallium content (% injected dose) correlated well with fractional LV blood flow (% cardiac output) (r = 0.95). However, for fractional LV flows in the low, normal, or moderately elevated range (LV flow/cardiac output less than 9%), thallium content consistently exceeded flow by about 15%. This relationship was not altered by ouabain or regional ischemia or infarction. For greatly elevated fractional LV flows (greater than 9%), thallium content was not significantly different from flow. To explain these differences, myocardial and systemic extraction fractions for thallium were determined in eight dogs with a dual tracer method. At baseline, myocardial extraction fraction was significantly greater than systemic (88 +/- 0.4% compared with 75 +/- 1%, p less than 0.001). During dipyridamole, myocardial extraction fraction decreased and myocardial and systemic values were no longer significantly different (82 +/- 1% compared with 79 +/- 1%). These results show that the fraction of injected thallium dose taken up by the LV myocardium exceeds the delivered fraction of cardiac output over a wide range of LV flows, and is not altered by ouabain-induced inhibition of sodium-potassium ATPase or regional myocardial infarction. This difference is explained by a greater myocardial than systemic extraction fraction for thallium. During high LV flows produced by dipyridamole, fractional LV thallium uptake and flow become similar as myocardial and systemic extraction fractions equalize.", 
    "14": "We induced beta-adrenergic receptor blockade at 28 days gestation in the fetal rabbit with an irreversible beta-antagonist, bromace-tylalprenolomenthane (BrAlp). There was a marked decrease in concentration of available receptors in lung with increasing doses of BrAlp. BrAlp treatment decreased isoproterenol, but not prostaglandin, stimulated adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) generation in lung minces, and had no effect on activation of adenylate cyclase through non-beta-receptor-mediated components of the cyclase system in particulate preparations. Phospholipid recovery via lung lavage was significantly less from treated fetuses than from controls in groups delivered by cesarean section at 30 days (-31%) or vaginally at 31 days (-34%) and not allowed to air breathe. However, if fetuses from either group were allowed to air breathe, the difference was abolished. BrAlp treatment did not affect the phospholipid composition in lavage fluid, the rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis, or tissue content of total or saturated phosphatidylcholine. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade did not produce a significant change in lung water content either at or after birth regardless of the route of delivery. These data indicate that endogenous catecholamines play a role in surfactant secretion in both the fetal and newborn rabbit. We found no effects of BrAlp treatment on lung water, suggesting perhaps a less important role of endogenous catecholamines or that fewer receptors are required for this response than remained after treatment.", 
    "15": "Depolarizations evoked by noradrenaline that were resistant to alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were recorded in the rat basilar artery. These gamma-adrenoceptor-mediated responses and the depolarizations to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were blocked by pretreatment of the tissue with alpha, beta-methylene ATP. These data are discussed with respect to the selectivity of alpha, beta-methylene ATP.", 
    "16": "Stimulation of tibial nerve afferent fibers has revealed heterogeneous shifts of left ventricular output, as well as pulmonary artery and posterior vena cava blood flow in anesthetized cats. Uniform changes in left ventricular output and pulmonary artery blood flow were noted in the majority of cases, with venous return most often exceeding pulmonary artery blood flow. beta-adrenoreceptor blockade failed to influence changes in pulmonary artery blood flow. It is concluded that the increase in pulmonary artery blood flow depends on the rise in venous return, but not on neurogenic influence upon the right ventricle. The reduction in left ventricular output is the result of decreased right ventricular outflow due to its overload caused by pulmonary vasoconstriction.", 
    "17": "We have used intact human mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) to examine desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors in normal mammalian cells. MNL were prepared and radioligand binding experiments were performed at 4 degrees C. At this temperature the ligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP) identified the same number of receptors as at 37 degrees C, and the agonist isoproterenol competed for this binding with high affinity (dissociation constant, Ki = 20 nM). At 37 degrees C, results were similar when the binding incubation was terminated after 1 min, but the apparent affinity of the receptors for isoproterenol was several 100-fold lower when the incubation was allowed to reach steady state. In desensitized MNL (prepared by incubating whole blood with 10 microM isoproterenol at 37 degrees C for 10 min, and then isolating and washing the MNL at 4 degrees C), isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation was reduced 63 +/- 4%. After desensitization, the total number of beta-receptors was unchanged, but isoproterenol and the hydrophilic antagonist CGP-12177 were able to compete with [125I]ICYP for binding to only 18 +/- 6% of these sites. Direct binding with [3H]CGP-12177 yielded similar results. These results demonstrate that isoproterenol promotes a rapid desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors on MNL and a concomitant redistribution of receptors into a cellular compartment to which some ligands (including catecholamines) have restricted access. The findings demonstrate that redistribution of beta-receptors may be a mechanism mediating desensitization to catecholamines in normal mammalian cells.", 
    "18": "Previous studies in anesthetized or decerebrate cats and rabbits and awake man have shown conflicting results regarding a potential role for beta-adrenergic receptors in carotid body function. Therefore, we sought to clarify the role of beta-adrenergic receptor activity in carotid body function by assessing: the ventilatory response to intravenous isoproterenol infusion in awake and anesthetized carotid body intact and carotid body denervated goats, the effect of propranolol on the ventilatory response to isocapnic hypoxemia, and carotid sinus nerve chemoreceptor discharge rate response to isoproterenol and hypoxia. Isoproterenol increased ventilation to a similar degree in carotid body intact and denervated awake and anesthetized goats. This ventilatory increase was blocked by propranolol. Propranolol did not alter the hypoxic ventilatory response. Although ventilation increased, carotid sinus nerve chemoreceptor discharge rate was not altered by isoproterenol infusion or bolus IV injection in anesthetized goats. Hypoxia did increase carotid sinus nerve discharge rate. In this study, beta-adrenergic stimulation of ventilation did not occur via the carotid body, and beta-adrenergic blockade did not affect the carotid body hypoxic ventilatory response. Therefore, we found no evidence of functional beta-adrenergic activity within the carotid body of the goat.", 
    "19": "Previous studies have suggested that dopamine may have an important role as an inhibitor of aldosterone secretion in humans. Recent studies have also suggested that the adrenergic nervous system may have an important role in controlling aldosterone secretion. The present study investigated the effects of dopamine on aldosterone secretion in response to angiotensin II, with and without pretreatment with propranolol, and to adrenocorticotropic hormone, another known stimulator of aldosterone secretion. Nine normal subjects in balance at 10 mEq sodium intake received dopamine (4 micrograms/kg/min) or vehicle for 270 minutes on 2 consecutive days on three separate occasions. After 120 minutes of dopamine infusion, the subjects received a 30-minute intravenous infusion of angiotensin II (in cumulative doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 pmol/kg/min), angiotensin II after oral pretreatment with propranolol, or adrenocorticotropic hormone (in cumulative doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 U/hr). Aldosterone responses to 2, 4, and 6 pmol/kg/min of angiotensin II (without propranolol) were greater in vehicle-treated than in dopamine-treated subjects (p less than 0.05), as was the slope of the angiotensin II-vehicle dose-response curve (0.46, p less than 0.05). Propranolol suppressed the aldosterone response to angiotensin II, but dopamine still inhibited the response. Aldosterone and cortisol secretion were stimulated equally by adrenocorticotropic hormone in dopamine-treated and vehicle-treated groups. These results suggest that dopamine selectively inhibits the aldosterone response to angiotensin II and that this response is not mediated by teh activity of dopamine at beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "20": "Treatment of rats with chemical carcinogens, including 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), leads to a strong increase in the hepatic catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity. The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism for the development of this increase. We report that hepatocytes isolated from rats which had been fed 2-AAF (0.025% w/w) for 8-12 weeks had an increased number of beta-adrenoceptors, as determined by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to whole cells and [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding to washed particles. For both ligands the number of binding sites was about 4-fold higher in hepatocytes from 2-AAF-treated rats than in those from controls. The adenylate cyclase activity of the carcinogen-fed animals showed both a general increase manifested in the basal level (2-fold) and in the activities obtained by stimulation with guanine nucleotides (2-3-fold), cholera toxin (1.5-fold), and glucagon (1.3-fold) and a selective, larger increase in the beta-adrenoceptor-linked activity (7-fold increment of the isoproterenol-sensitive activity). The results indicate that the number of hepatocyte beta-adrenoceptors increases during 2-AAF carcinogenesis. This may, at least in part, explain the rise in catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity.", 
    "21": "Adrenergic receptors in human liver plasma membranes were characterized by radioligand binding assays. The binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol [( 3H]DHA) to partially purified membranes was rapid, of high affinity, saturable, and stereospecific. The binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol to the same membranes was also saturable and stereospecific, but extremely slow, and at 37 C required about 6 h for equilibration. The maximum number of binding sites from six livers determined with these two beta-receptor ligands was 36-83 fmol/mg protein. Catecholaminergic agonists competed for these binding sites in the order typical for beta 2-adrenergic receptors. IPS 339 [(tertiarybutylamino-3-ol-2-propyl)oximino-9-fluorene hydrochloride], a beta 2-selective antagonist, was at least 3 orders of magnitude more potent in inhibiting the binding of [3H]DHA than the beta 1-antagonist, atenolol. Computer-aided analysis of the competition curves as well as Hofstee transformations of the binding data indicated the predominance of the beta 2-subtype. The GTP analog guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate, decreased the binding affinity of the agonist, l-isoproterenol, indicating the modulation of agonist-promoted coupling of the receptors to guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins. The maximum number of binding sites for the binding of [3H]prazosin and [3H]dihydroergocryptine were the same (60-70 fmol/mg protein), indicating that the majority of the alpha-receptors are of the alpha 1-subtype. Competition experiments with prazosin and yohimbine confirmed the predominance of the alpha 1-receptor subtype, although the presence of alpha 2-receptors cannot be completely ruled out. These results indicate that adrenergic receptors in human liver plasma membranes are predominantly of the beta 2- and alpha 1-subtypes.", 
    "22": "The interactions of four antimigraine drugs with 5-hydroxytryptamine1A and beta-adrenergic receptors were analyzed in rat brain membranes. Methysergide, cyproheptadine, (-)propranolol, and pizotifen display similar affinities (IC50 values, 83 to 280 nM) for 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptors labeled by [3H]8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin. Cyproheptadine, pizotifen, and methysergide are essentially inactive at beta-adrenergic receptors labeled by [3H]dihydroalprenolol (IC50 values, 8,700 to 87,000 nM). By contrast, (-)propranolol is an extremely potent beta-adrenergic agent (IC50, 3 nM). These data indicate that the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor is a common site of action for (-)propranolol and other antimigraine agents.", 
    "23": "During the intervening years since metoprolol was first reviewed in the Journal (1977), it has become widely used in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension and angina pectoris. Although much data have accumulated, its precise mechanisms of action in these diseases remain largely uncertain. Optimum treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris with metoprolol is achieved through dose titration within the therapeutic range. It has been clearly demonstrated that metoprolol is at least as effective as other beta-blockers, diuretics and certain calcium antagonists in the majority of patients. Although a twice daily dosage regimen is normally used, satisfactory control can be maintained in many patients with single daily doses of conventional or, more frequently, slow release formulations. Addition of a diuretic may improve the overall response rate in hypertension. Several controlled trials have studied the effects of metoprolol administered during the acute phase and after myocardial infarction. In early intervention trials a reduction in total mortality was achieved in one moderately large trial of prolonged treatment, but in another, which excluded patients already being treated with beta-blockers or certain calcium antagonists and where treatment was only short term, mortality was significantly reduced only in 'high risk' patients. Overall results with metoprolol have not demonstrated that early intervention treatment in all patients produces clinically important improvement in short term mortality. Thus, the use of metoprolol during the early stages of myocardial infarction is controversial, largely because of the requirement to treat all patients to save a small number at 'high risk'. This blanket coverage approach to treatment may be more justified during the post-infarction follow-up phase since it has been shown that metoprolol slightly, but significantly, reduces the mortality rate for periods of up to 3 years. Metoprolol is generally well tolerated and its beta 1-selectivity may facilitate its administration to certain patients (e.g. asthmatics and diabetics) in whom non-selective beta-blockers are contraindicated. Temporary fatigue, dizziness and headache are among the most frequently reported side effects. After a decade of use, metoprolol is well established as a first choice drug in mild to moderate hypertension and stable angina, and is beneficial in post-infarction patients. Further study is needed in less well established areas of treatment such as cardiac arrhythmias, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertensive cardiomegaly.", 
    "24": "In order to evaluate the role of adrenergic receptor-mediated vasomotions of large epicardial coronary arteries in changing coronary blood flow (CBF), the effects of intracoronary norepinephrine (NE), 1.0 microgram/min, were examined in dogs with coronary stenosis which preserved stenosis vasomobility. In untreated dogs, NE caused no significant changes in CBF and stenosis resistance (SR). In dogs treated with propranolol, NE decreased CBF by 65 +/- 7.0% (mean +/- SE) and produced 12-fold intensification of SR followed by LV dP/dt reduction. Similar detrimental responses to NE were observed in dogs treated with atenolol. In dogs treated with phentolamine, NE increased CBF by 33 +/- 5.6% and decreased SR by 65 +/- 7.1%. When NE was administrated directly distal to the stenosis to exclude responses of the stenosed coronary segment, NE failed to affect CBF and SR. These results indicated that alpha receptor stimulation intensified stenosis severity, profoundly decreased CBF and evoked myocardial ischemia, whereas beta stimulation dilated coronary stenosis and increased CBF. The net effects of NE were due to balanced alpha and beta stimulation. Thus, disproportionate activation of alpha and beta (probably beta 1) adrenergic receptors in large coronary arteries with pliable stenosis could modulate their tone and plays an important role in the regulation of CBF.", 
    "25": "Starting from the fact that during the first days the mortality is essentially determined by the degree of severity of the infarction and its complications, a particularly critical evaluation of the results is required. Patients with a bad prognosis usually have contra-indications for the application of beta-blockers during that phase. After the early complications have been overcome, the obtained findings are much easier to interpret in the sense of a therapeutical conception, and they have caused us to make the generalization--observing the contra-indications--to use beta-blockers in the framework of a complex therapy of myocardial infarction wherever it is possible. The results obtained require further verification, but justify, however, optimism on their part.", 
    "26": "Using the stereospecific metabolism of (+)- and (-)-bufuralol and (+)- and (-)-metoprolol as model reactions, we have characterized the enzymic deficiency of the debrisoquine/sparteine-type polymorphism by comparing kinetic data of subjects in vivo with their microsomal activities in vitro and with reconstituted activities of cytochrome P-450 isozymes purified from human liver. The metabolism of bufuralol in liver microsomes of in vivo phenotyped 'poor metabolizers' of debrisoquine and/or sparteine is characterized by a marked increase in Km, a decrease in Vmax and a virtual loss of the stereoselectivity of the reaction. These parameters apparently allow the 'phenotyping' of microsomes in vitro. A structural model of the active site of a cytochrome P-450 for stereospecific metabolism of bufuralol and other polymorphically metabolized substrates was constructed. Two cytochrome P-450 isozymes, P-450 buf I and P-450 buf II, both with MW 50,000 Da, were purified from human liver on the basis of their ability to metabolize bufuralol to 1'-hydroxy-bufuralol. However, P-450 buf I metabolized bufuralol in a highly stereoselective fashion ((-)/(+) ratio 0.16) as compared to P-450 buf II (ratio 0.99) and had a markedly lower Km for bufuralol. Moreover, bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation by P-450 buf I was uniquely characterized by its extreme sensitivity to inhibition by quinidine. Antibodies against P-450 buf I and P-450 buf II inhibited bufuralol metabolism in microsomes and with the reconstituted enzymes. Immunochemical studies with these antibodies with microsomes and translations in vitro of RNA from livers of extensive and poor metabolizers showed no evidence for a decrease in the recognized protein or its mRNA. Because the antibodies do not discriminate between P-450 buf I and P-450 buf II, both a decreased content of P-450 buf I or its functional alteration could explain the polymorphic metabolism in microsomes. The genetically defective stereospecific metabolism of mephenytoin was determined in liver microsomes of extensive and poor metabolizers of mephenytoin phenotyped in vivo. Microsomes of poor metabolizers were characterized by an increased Km and a decreased Vmax for S-mephenytoin hydroxylation as compared to extensive metabolizers and a loss of stereospecificity for the hydroxylation of S-versus R-mephenytoin. A cytochrome P-450 with high activity for mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation was purified from human liver. Immunochemical studies with inhibitory antibodies against this isozyme suggest the presence in poor-metabolizer microsomes of a functionally altered enzyme.", 
    "27": "The contribution of debrisoquine polymorphism to the metabolism and action of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) varies widely between drugs. Oxidation phenotype is a major determinant of the metabolism, pharmacokinetics and some of the pharmacological actions of metoprolol, bufuralol and timolol. The poor metabolizer phenotype is associated with an increased area under the plasma drug concentration vs. time curve, a prolongation of elimination half-life and a more intense and sustained beta-blockade. The stereoselective metabolism of metoprolol also displays phenotypic differences, which should be taken into account when interpreting plasma concentration vs. response relationships. Studies in vivo and in vitro have identified some of the metabolic pathways which are subject to this defect, namely the alpha-hydroxylation and the O-demethylation of metoprolol and the 1'-hydroxylation of bufuralol. In contrast, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propranolol, which is also extensively oxidized, are not related to debrisoquine polymorphism, although 4'-hydroxypropranolol formation is deficient in the poor metabolizer phenotype. The disposition of atenolol, which is almost completely eliminated unchanged by renal and faecal excretion, is independent of oxidation phenotype. If standard doses of some beta-blockers are used in poor metabolizers, these patients may be susceptible to concentration-related adverse reactions and they may also require lower and less frequent dosing for control of angina pectoris.", 
    "28": "The purpose of the investigation was to study some indices of the immune system of patients with diffuse toxic goiter (DTG) before multimodality thyrostatic therapy and after achieving clinical remission. A total of 30 DTG patients with an average severity of disease were examined. The immune status was evaluated according to the content of T-lymphocytes, T-suppressors, Fc gamma-lymphocytes and antigen-binding lymphocytes (ABL) responsive to thyroglobulin. Conservative therapy included mercazolyl, beta-adrenergic blockers, sedative and cardiac drugs. A drop of T1T gamma and Fc gamma-lymphocytes was revealed in the period of the manifestation of the clinical signs of disease. The indices of ABL responsive to thyroglobulin significantly exceeded the relative and absolute indices of the control group. Multimodality drug therapy resulted in the deepening of T-lymphocyte deficiency, a significant rise of T gamma 1 and T gamma 2 as compared to the initial levels. A tendency to a decrease in the level of Fc gamma-lumphocytes was noted after the therapy. The relative and absolute values of the ABL indices significantly decreased, however a significant increase in these indices compared to the control ones maintained.", 
    "29": "The modulation of the release of [14C]glutamate by noradrenaline (NA) was investigated in slices prepared from the dentate gyrus and from the CA1/CA3 area of the hippocampus. In dentate, but not in CA1/CA3 slices, NA significantly enhanced K+-induced Ca2+-dependent release, and this effect was mimicked by clonidine and isoprenaline, but not by phenylephrine. The enhancement of release by NA was antagonised by propranolol, but not by yohimbine or phentolamine. These results suggest that NA does not modulate the release of glutamate in CA1/CA3, but does so in the dentate gyrus, probably by acting on presynaptically-located beta receptors.", 
    "30": "p-Chloroamphetamine (PCA) which releases serotonin is known to increase the activity of plasma renin in conscious rats by stimulating serotonergic neurotransmission in the brain. The present studies were designed to investigate whether this effect is mediated from the serotonin receptors in the brain to the kidneys via the sympathetic nervous system. The effect of PCA on the activity of plasma renin was completely blocked by the beta receptor blockers sotalol and atenolol, but was not prevented by the sympathetic inhibitor, bretylium tosylate. In additional studies, chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine, combined with adrenal medullectomy did not prevent the effect of PCA on the activity of plasma renin even though the renal content of norepinephrine was reduced to undetectable levels. Furthermore, complete transection of the spinal cord between the first and second thoracic vertebrae did not prevent the effect of PCA on the activity of plasma renin, suggesting that the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal catecholamines do not mediate the effect of PCA. Studies by others have suggested that extrarenal beta receptors play an important role in the regulation of secretion of renin. The results of the present study support this possibility. The role of the parasympathetic nervous system in the rise in the activity of plasma renin induced by PCA was investigated by pretreatment of the rats with the peripheral muscarinic receptor blocker, methyl atropine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "The present studies were undertaken to clarify whether central beta-adrenoceptor down regulation is responsible for the greater effect of chronic treatment with desipramine (DMI) compared with acute treatment in the forced swimming test in rats. Repetitive administration of DMI activated the rat behaviour pattern and consequently reduced the duration of immobility. The degree of activation depended on the length of treatment, i.e. no effect when given in a single dose, moderate effect when given subchronically (3 doses) and marked activation after chronic (31 doses) treatment. Chronic treatment with DMI also produced a decrease in 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) binding site in the cerebral cortex. Acute stimulation of brain beta-adrenoceptors by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) isoprenaline significantly, though partially, attenuated the behavioural effect of chronic DMI by beta 1-adrenoceptor-related mechanisms. Similarly, chronic i.c.v. co-administration of atenolol or practolol, beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, together with DMI attenuated both beta-adrenoceptor down regulation and the behavioural activation by chronic DMI. On the other hand, chronic i.c.v. administration of isoprenaline, supposedly leading to down regulation of beta-adrenoceptors, facilitated the activating behavioural effect of DMI, as a single dose became effective. Changes, however, in 3H-DHA binding parameters in the cerebral cortex were not observed after chronic isoprenaline. These results suggest that down regulation of beta-adrenoceptors in brain is responsible, at least in part, for the marked activatory effect of chronic DMI in the forced swimming test, possibly by reducing an inhibitory function of beta 1-adrenoceptor mediated mechanisms.", 
    "32": "The results of conservative treatment were reviewed in 100 patients with unstable angina. In hospital, the condition was stabilized in 73% of patients, acute myocardial infarction developed in 24%, and fatal outcomes resulted in 7%. In the first year since the diagnosis of unstable angina was made, the incidence of acute myocardial infarction was 32%, with 14% mortality. Further prognosis for unstable angina was basically similar to that for chronic coronary heart disease. A clear-cut correlation was demonstrated between the frequency of anginal attacks, total ST displacement, the severity of coronary-bed and myocardial lesions and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction and death.", 
    "33": "Seven healthy subjects immersed a hand for 2 min in cold water at 5 degrees C (the standard cold pressor test) with and without beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Control immersions in warm water were also performed. The maximal and partial flow-volume curves as well as the arterial blood pressure, heart rate and body and hand temperatures were recorded before, during and after the hand immersion. The blood pressure rose significantly during the cold pressor test, but the airflow variables did not change significantly, whether or not propranolol had been given. It is concluded that, even though the standard cold pressor test induces sympathetically-mediated cardiovascular responses, it does not produce a bronchodilatation.", 
    "34": "1-Isopropylamino-3-(2-methyl-4-indolyloxy)-2-propanol (mepindolol, Corindolan) is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA): positive chronotropic effects in atria of the rat amount to 24% of those elicited by the full agonist isoprenaline. Relaxant effects in blood vessels approach 50% of those of isoprenaline. This vasorelaxant effect is completely blocked by the specific beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118 551 (erythro-dl-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminobut an-2-ol), suggesting that the vasodilatory effects of mepindolol are elicited by stimulation of vascular beta 2-adrenoceptors. In the anaesthetized cat mepindolol acutely lowers arterial blood pressure by reducing total peripheral resistance without exhibiting significant cardiodepressant action, whereas propranolol, lacking ISA, lowers blood pressure by a marked reduction of cardiac output and left ventricular contractility, however, total peripheral resistance is significantly increased.", 
    "35": "The rat uterus generates and releases prostaglandins (PGs) of the series 2 as well as PGs of the series 1. The main purposes of the present study are to compare the effects of norepinephrine (NE) on the production and outputs of PGE1, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha by the uterus isolated from ovariectomized rats, treated or not with 17-beta-estradiol and to explore also, whether the effects of NE on PG synthesis are mediated through alpha, beta or both types of adrenoreceptors. Segments of control uterine horns obtained from ovariectomized rats generated and released into the incubating solution, equal amounts of PGE1, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha and propranolol (10(-6) M) or phentolamine (10(-6) M) failed to alter this basal production of PGs. Norepinephrine (3 X 10(-6) M) significantly depressed the outputs of PGE1 and PGF2 alpha but enhanced, also significantly, the release of PGE2. In the presence of the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker, propranolol, the reduction induced by NE on the output of PGE1 was not altered, but the stimulatory influence of NE on the release of PGE2 as well as the depression on the output of PGF2 alpha, were abolished. On the other hand the diminution evoked by NE on the release of PGF1 and PGF2 alpha as well as the increment induced on PGE2 output, were inhibited by the presence of phentolamine in the incubating solution. Uterine horns from ovariectomized rats treated with 17-beta-estradiol released into the incubating solution significantly more PGF2 alpha than PGE1 or PGE2. NE, either alone of in the presence of alpha 0 or beta-adrenoceptor blockers, did not modify this pattern of PG production. A possible mechanism(s) of action for NE on PG synthesis is discussed.", 
    "36": "This paper describes a method by which antianginal drugs can be evaluated in the dog heart in situ. Myocardial pH was measured continuously by a micro glass pH electrode inserted in the left ventricular endocardial layers of the dog anesthetized with pentobarbital. Occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) decreased myocardial pH, and release of the LAD restored the pH. The myocardial acidosis induced by ischemia was metabolic in nature and accompanied by a decrease in the levels of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate and an increase in the levels of lactate in the myocardium. Drugs were injected intravenously 30 min after incomplete (partial) occlusion ot the LAD, lasting until 60 min after drug injection. Propranolol, atenolol, and sotalol markedly attenuated the myocardial pH that had been decreased by LAD occlusion. Nitroglycerin, diltiazem, and nicorandil also attenuated the pH, but these drugs were less active in attenuating myocardial acidosis. Dipyridamole, nifedipine, and beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonists were least active in this regard. It is concluded that myocardial pH can be used as an indicator of myocardial regional ischemia and utilized for evaluation of antianginal drugs.", 
    "37": "Numerous studies now suggest that better prevention of arrhythmic sudden death (SD) is provided by beta-blockers than by type I antiarrhythmic drugs. Analysis of 69 cases of SD recorded at ambulatory ECG showed two important facts: (1) in about 20% of the cases, type I antiarrhythmic drugs were responsible for SD, so that the statistical lack of prevention probably reflects a mixed picture of beneficial and deleterious effects; (2) the apparent ineffectiveness of beta-blockers in daily observed arrhythmias does not imply that they cannot protect the patients against the exceptional circumstances which lead to lethal arrhythmias. Arguments suggesting that sympathetic drive should be tempered for a better protection against SD come from various observations: transient ischaemia preceding the terminal event, increasing heart rate preceding lethal or life-threatening arrhythmias, persistent arrhythmias inducibility with isoprenaline or exercise when they had apparently been controlled, the positive correlation between the number of premature beats and the sinus rate at Holter monitoring and the consistent sinus acceleration before a variety of arrhythmias at Holter monitoring. Electrophysiologic phenomena and the autonomic nervous system are often combined to generate arrhythmias. Drugs may apparently be effective though not specific for the causal mechanism, or may be apparently ineffective though providing real protection against potential arrhythmias. Modes of evaluation of the different situations should be more comprehensive to ensure better adapted treatments.", 
    "38": "The physiology of the normal sexual response, epidemiology of sexual dysfunction, and the pharmacologic mechanisms involved in antihypertensive- and antipsychotic-induced problems with sexual function are discussed, with recommendations for patient management. The physiologic mechanisms involved in the normal sexual response include neurogenic, psychogenic, vascular, and hormonal factors that are coordinated by centers in the hypothalamus, limbic system, and cerebral cortex. Sexual dysfunction is frequently attributed to antihypertensive and antipsychotic agents and is a cause of noncompliance. Drug-induced effects include diminished libido, delayed orgasm, ejaculatory disturbances, gynecomastia, impotence, and priapism. The pharmacologic mechanisms proposed to account for these adverse effects include adrenergic inhibition, adrenergic-receptor blockade, anticholinergic properties, and endocrine and sedative effects. The most frequently reported adverse effect on sexual function with the antihypertensive agents is impotence. It is seen most often with methyldopa, guanethidine, clonidine, and propranolol. In contrast, the most common adverse effect on sexual function with the antipsychotic agents involves ejaculatory disturbances. Thioridazine, with its potent anticholinergic and alpha-blocking properties, is cited most often. Drug-induced sexual dysfunction may be alleviated by switching to agents with dissimilar mechanisms to alter the observed adverse effect while maintaining adequate control of the patient's disease state.", 
    "39": "To compare haemodynamic responses associated with equipotent doses of muscle relaxants and high dose fentanyl (50 micrograms X kg-1), 40 non-hypertensive patients who were receiving beta adrenergic and calcium channel blocker therapy and undergoing coronary bypass surgery were randomized to four study groups receiving the following: (1) atracurium: 0.4 mg X kg-1, (2) pancuronium: 0.12 mg X kg-1, (3) vecuronium: 0.12 mg X kg-1, or (4) pancuronium-metocurine mixture: (0.4 mg + 1.6 mg X ml-1):1 ml/10 kg. Neuromuscular blockers were injected with fetanyl at induction. Haemodynamics were recorded with the patients awake (baseline), at two minutes post-induction, and at two and five minutes after intubation. Pancuronium was the only drug associated with significant increases in HR; no other significant changes occurred within each group when compared to their respective baseline haemodynamics. HR increased more after induction with pancuronium when compared to atracurium (23 vs. 4 per cent, p less than 0.05) and to vecuronium (23 vs. 2 per cent, p less than 0.05), and when compared to vecuronium after intubation (29 vs. 7 per cent, p less than 0.05). The pancuronium-metocurine mixture caused tachycardia which was less than, though not significantly different than with pancuronium; however, HR returned to baseline by five minutes with the mixture, but remained elevated with pancuronium (3 vs. 18 per cent, p less than 0.05). SVR fell more on induction with atracurium when compared to vecuronium (-18 vs. 1 per cent, p less than 0.05). These changes in HR or SVR were not accompanied by ECG signs of ischaemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "Labetalol is a competitive inhibitor of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors and has an antihypertensive action. To determine limb haemodynamic effects, we measured calf blood flow and venous capacitance by venous occlusion plethysmography before and after oral labetalol in 10 patients 3-7 days following coronary bypass surgery. Vascular resistance was calculated as the ratio of mean arterial pressure to arterial flow. The peak effect of labetalol was taken as the point of maximum blood pressure decline, and this interval was selected for evaluation of the limb haemodynamic response. Ninety to 120 min after administration of 100-200 mg of labetalol the mean blood pressure fell from 88 +/- 3 to 79 +/- 3 mm Hg; (P less than 0.005). The mean arterial blood flow registered 5.1 +/- 1.0 ml 100 ml-1 limb tissue min-1 which was not significantly different from the control value of 4.4 +/- 0.8 ml 100 ml-1 limb tissue min-1. The calculated index of limb vascular resistance was not affected by labetalol administration, averaging 37 +/- 12 mm Hg 100-1 ml limb tissue min-1 before labetalol and 30 +/- 11 mm Hg ml-1 100 ml limb tissue min-1 at the time of peak hypotensive effect. There was a slight but statistically significant increment in limb venous volume to 1.9 +/- 0.3 from 1.5 +/- 0.3 ml 100 ml-1 limb tissue (P less than 0.025). Placebo administration produced no consistent changes in blood pressure, arterial blood flow, vascular resistance or venous capacitance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "The effect of selective vs. nonselective beta-blockade on fast-twitch [extensor digitorum longus (EDL)] and slow-twitch [soleus (SOL)] muscle enzyme activities following endurance training were characterized. Citrate synthase (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD) activities were compared in SOL and EDL muscles of trained (T), metoprolol-trained (MT), propranolol-trained (PT), and sedentary (C) rats. Following 8 wk of treadmill running (1 h/day, 5 days/wk at approximately 30 m/min), LDH activity was depressed approximately 20% (P less than 0.05) in both SOL and EDL in only the PT rats, indicating inhibition of beta 2-mediated anaerobic glycolysis. EDL CS activity was similarly elevated in all three trained groups compared with sedentary controls. In SOL muscle, however, a drug attenuation effect was observed so that CS activity was increased only in the T (P less than 0.01) and MT (P less than 0.05) groups. HAD enzyme activity was increased somewhat (P less than 0.10) in SOL muscle in only the T group, but more so (P less than 0.05) in EDL in all three trained groups. The above findings suggest a training-induced selectivity effect not only with respect to beta 1-vs. beta 1-beta 2-blockers, but also with respect to muscle fiber type.", 
    "42": "Prizidilol (SK&F 92657-A2), an anti-hypertensive agent, has undergone a range of prescribed toxicity studies required for the investigation of possible adverse drug effects. During the second year of the 2-year rat oral study, a variety of symptoms were exhibited by males receiving 1600 mg of the compound day-1kg-1 by gavage. These animals became lethargic, slouched and developed dyspnoea which became progressively more severe during the course of the study. Necropsy of the affected rats revealed severely haemorrhagic lungs, cardiac hypertrophy and lordosis of the spine into the thoracic cavity. At the 2-year terminal kill, a proportion of the male rats receiving 100 and 400 mg of prizidilol day-1kg-1 were identified with similar but less severe spinal deformation. No female was found with spinal changes but all the rats receiving prizidilol showed haemorrhagic lungs and enlarged hearts. The lordosis of the affected males was always confined to the thoracic spine and this, along with the cardiac hypertrophy, presumably led to marked reduction in the volume of the thoracic cavity, inducing the dyspnoea. Thoracic vertebral body damage, possibly a precursor to the spinal deformities, was found in male rats from both drug-treated and control groups. The nature of the spinal lesion is at present under investigation.",

    "47": "Beta-adrenergic modulation of cardiovascular tissue is an important determinant of cardiovascular performance during stress. Studies that range from measurements of the cardiovascular stress response in man to those of subcellular reactions in animal tissues indicate that a diminution in the responsiveness of the heart and vasculature to beta-adrenergic stimulation occurs with aging. When considered in toto, the results of these studies suggest that this deficit is among the most prominent alterations in cardiovascular function that occurs with aging in the absence of specific disease states. This may have important implications in the clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease in the elderly.", 
    "48": "The effects of the 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative nisoldipine, infused intravenously (i.v.) at 3 different rates (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 microgram kg-1 min-1), were studied in anaesthetized pigs on cardiovascular performance with or without beta-adrenoceptor blockade produced by propranolol. Nisoldipine caused dose-dependent decreases in arterial blood pressure (30%), systemic vascular resistance (30%) and left ventricular filling pressure (15%), but raised heart rate (25%) and LV dP/dt max (20%). Cardiac output was not significantly affected. Transmural myocardial blood flow and vascular conductances increased dose-dependently after nisoldipine. The elevation in blood flow to the left ventricle favoured epicardial layers. Endocardial blood flow showed small increases as the changes in conductance of the endocardial layer more than compensated for the loss in perfusion pressure. The endo-epi blood flow ratio decreased from 1.16 +/- 0.05 to 0.70 +/- 0.01. Myocardial O2-consumption was unaltered as the decrease in arterial-coronary venous O2-content difference (30%) was balanced by the increase in transmural blood flow. Nisoldipine increased blood flow to skeletal muscle (500%), stomach (50%) and adrenals (25%), but decreased that to the liver (50%), spleen (25%) and kidneys (25%). No changes were noticed in the small intestine, skin and brain. In spite of differential effects on blood flow, vascular conductance in all organs and tissues, with the exception of the liver, increased. After beta-adrenoceptor blockade the responses of mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance to nisoldipine remained virtually unchanged, but the elevations in heart rate and LV dP/dt max were abolished, as was the decrease in left ventricular filling pressure. A higher dose of nisoldipine was required after beta-adrenoceptor blockade to elicit significant vasodilatation in the epi- and endocardial layers. However, the reduction in endo-epi blood flow ratio by nisoldipine was not affected by propranolol. Myocardial O2-consumption tended to decrease as the diminution in the arterial-coronary venous O2-content difference (30%) slightly exceeded the increase of left ventricular blood flow (30%). Except for the brain and liver, effects of nisoldipine on regional vascular conductances were attenuated after beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "49": "Responses to vascular relaxant drugs were obtained on KCl (15 mM)-contracted isolated ring preparations of pulmonary artery and aorta from young (1-2 months old) and aged (greater than 16 months old) rats. These vessels contain both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. Relaxant responses (i.e. relaxation expressed as a % of the KCl-induced contraction) to isoprenaline, procaterol (beta 2-selective partial agonist), fenoterol (beta 2-selective) and noradrenaline (beta 1-selective) but not those of forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, enprofylline or sodium nitrite, were smaller on preparations from aged rats than on those from young rats. Thyroxine (T4)-treatment (1 mg kg-1 s.c. thrice weekly for 3-5 weeks) of aged or young rats enhanced responses to isoprenaline and noradrenaline but reduced those to procaterol, when compared with preparations from age-matched saline-treated control rats. The agonist order of potency, determined in young rats, was isoprenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than adrenaline in preparations from T4-treated rats compared with isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline in saline-treated control rats. It is concluded (a) that the age-related decline in vascular responses to beta-adrenoceptor agonists involves beta-adrenoceptor mechanisms specifically and possibly beta 2-adrenoceptors more than beta 1-adrenoceptors; and (b) that T4-treatment of rats enhances beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated and reduces, or does not change, beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses of preparations of rat pulmonary artery and aorta. In preparations from control rats beta 2-adrenoceptors were functionally predominant but in preparations from T4-treated rats beta 1-adrenoceptors appeared to become functionally predominant.", 
    "50": "Intraluminal pressure was measured in the isolated, fluid-filled trachea of the guinea pig, with autonomic innervation on the right side intact. Increases or decreases in intraluminal pressure reflected excitatory or inhibitory responses respectively, in the tracheal smooth muscle. Stimulation of the cervical vagus nerve evoked a cholinergic excitatory response. After cholinergic blockade with atropine, a non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic inhibitory response was obtained. Stimulation of the cervical sympathetic trunk, or stellate ganglion, evoked beta-adrenergic inhibitory responses. In the presence of propranolol, sympathetic stimulation evoked alpha-adrenergic excitatory responses which were of low amplitude (less than or equal to 5% of cholinergic excitatory responses). In the presence of phentolamine but not prazosin, beta-adrenergic inhibitory responses were potentiated. Neostigmine potentiated responses to vagal stimulation, increasing the amplitude and duration of response. At higher concentrations neostigmine (i) raised intraluminal pressure, a response blocked by atropine, and (ii) attenuated sympathetic inhibitory responses, an effect largely blocked by atropine. Histamine increased intraluminal pressure and this response was attenuated by atropine. In the presence of histamine, vagal excitatory responses were attenuated. Sympathetic inhibitory responses at low frequencies of stimulation (up to 10 Hz) were inhibited by histamine. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) increased intraluminal pressure also, an effect partially blocked by atropine. 5-HT had no effect on vagal excitatory responses. Like histamine, 5-HT attenuated sympathetic inhibitory responses at lower frequencies of stimulation.", 
    "51": "The effects of dopamine and domperidone, a dopamine antagonist, have been studied on the exocrine secretion of the dog pancreas. The purpose of this study was to see if dopamine acted on enzyme secretion and if its action was merely 'pharmacological' or had a physiological role. Conscious Beagle dogs, fitted with Thomas cannulae were studied following infusions of dopamine 125-1000 micrograms kg-1 h-1. During dopamine infusion, a secretory peak lasting 10 min was observed. This was followed by a stable plateau which was approximately 1/3 of the peak. The pattern of water, bicarbonate and protein secretion was similar. The maximum effect was obtained with 500 micrograms kg-1 h-1 dopamine. The stimulatory action of dopamine was blocked by domperidone, without any detected effect on the central nervous system, but not by propranolol or phenoxybenzamine. Domperidone 10 micrograms kg-1 almost completely suppressed the secretory response to the maximally effective dose of dopamine. This inhibition was not competitive. Atropine decreased the secretory response to dopamine. The protein response was not observed when dopamine was infused against a background infusion of secretin. This suggests that the effect of dopamine on protein secretion could be due to a wash-out phenomenon. The maximally effective dose of domperidone, 10 micrograms kg-1, did not modify the pancreatic response to a solid meal. Thus, in the non-anaesthetized dog, the effect of dopamine on water and bicarbonate secretion has been confirmed. It is concluded that dopamine had no detectable action on protein secretion and that the physiological role of dopamine with respect to pancreatic secretion is still questionable.", 
    "52": "We have shown the existence of a homogeneous population of specific binding sites for [3H]prazosin in membranes from rat lacrimal glands. The value of the equilibrium dissociation constant was 0.186 +/- 0.07 nM, and the density of specific binding sites was 20.4 +/- 1 fmol/mg protein. Taking into account the potency sequences for adrenergic agonists and antagonists for competition with these [3H]prazosin binding sites, we identified them as alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the stimulation of protein discharge evoked by epinephrine could be partly attributed to the occupation of this alpha-adrenergic receptor subtype. However, the inhibition pattern of the epinephrine effect by a beta-adrenergic antagonist, 1-propranolol, and the characteristics of the secretory response observed when selectively stimulating the alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors, either separately or simultaneously, suggest that 1) a simultaneous activation of both receptors is necessary to produce a maximal secretory response to catecholamines; and 2) a synergism may exist between these two routes of stimulation, leading to an amount of protein discharge higher than that expected in the case of additive effects.", 
    "53": "Antiarrhythmic drugs are often either partially or totally ineffective for the suppression of ventricular arrhythmias in a given patient. Drug combinations afford an additional therapeutic option. We report the role of beta-blocking agents as adjunct therapy to membrane stabilizing drugs in the management of patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The study group included 54 patients who were evaluated by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring and symptom-limited exercise testing. Patients underwent control studies without antiarrhythmic drugs, were evaluated on membrane stabilizing drugs and beta blocking agents separately, and were then tested on combination therapy. The combination of a beta-blocking agent and a membrane stabilizing drug abolished ventricular tachycardia and couplets in 83% and 86% of exercise tests in patients with this arrhythmia present during therapy with membrane drugs alone (p less than 0.01). The addition of a beta blocker to a membrane drug, as evaluated by ambulatory monitoring, resulted in an abolition of ventricular tachycardia and couplets in 43% and 20% of studies (p less than 0.05). Ventricular premature beat frequency was reduced by more than 50% in 65% of exercise tests and in 52% of monitoring studies (p less than 0.05). In this population, beta-blocking agents failed to reduce ventricular arrhythmias when used alone. Thus the addition of a beta blocker to a membrane stabilizing drug significantly enhances the suppression of ventricular arrhythmia, especially when assessed by exercise testing. This results from synergistic drug effects of the combination rather than from the effect of the individual drugs.", 
    "54": "The release of endogenous glutamate (GLU) elicited by depolarization of rat cerebellum synaptosomes was inhibited potently (pEC30 = 9.77) by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). The 5-HT action was antagonized by methiothepin (pA2 = 10.37); ketanserin, methysergide, cinanserin and spiperone were ineffective. Exogenous 5-HT also inhibited the release of [3H]-5-HT from cerebellar synaptosomes (pEC30 = 8.73). Methiothepin, but not ketanserin, methysergide, cinanserin or spiperone counteracted the inhibition (pA2 = 9.28). The receptors involved (presynaptic 5-HT heteroreceptors and autoreceptors) were activated by the 5-HT1 agonist RU 24969 (5-methoxy-3-[1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl]-1H-indole) which showed comparable activity at the two receptor systems. (-)-Propranolol, used as a 5-HT1 antagonist, shifted to the right (pA2 = 8.05) the dose-response curve of 5-HT at the autoreceptors, but was ineffective at the receptors regulating GLU release. On the contrary, the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-di-N-propylamino)tetralin activated the presynaptic heteroreceptors (pEC30 = 7.98), but was ineffective as a 5-HT autoreceptor agonist. The results allow the following major conclusions: 5-HT receptors are located on GLU terminals in rat cerebellum where they may modulate in an inhibitory way the release of GLU; 5-HT autoreceptors possibly involved in a negative feedback regulation of 5-HT release are present on cerebellar 5-HT nerve endings; 5-HT autoreceptors and heteroreceptors can be pharmacologically differentiated and appear to represent subtypes of the 5-HT1 receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "55": "Sixteen subjects scheduled for surgical procedures under general anesthesia participated in an investigation of the effects of esmolol on the transient hypertension and tachycardia that was observed during endotracheal intubation and on the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade. In eight subjects, infusion of esmolol was begun five minutes before induction of anesthesia and continued for 12 minutes after induction. In the remaining subjects, an equivalent volume of solvent (D5W) was infused for 12 minutes. Infusion of esmolol significantly attenuated the cardioacceleration observed during intubation without any significant effect on the pressor effects of the procedure. Esmolol delayed the recovery from succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade by less than three minutes. The mechanism of this delay remains to be investigated, although such a delay does not have clinical significance. Esmolol-induced attenuation of the tachycardia seen during intubation may offer a protective effect on the myocardium, especially in elderly subjects and patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "56": "The most important finding to emerge from this review of experimental and clinical studies is that the earlier therapy is begun after the onset of symptoms of acute MI, the greater the potential for reduction of infarct size and possibly mortality. It is difficult to define a precise time after which therapy would not have an effect, since the clinical trials for each drug group vary significantly in respect to time of therapy initiation. In experimental studies, major salvage of ischemic myocardium occurs when the drug is given within two hours of coronary artery occlusion. If drug therapy is begun four to six hours postocclusion, then only minor or no reductions in infarct size will occur. The ability of any drug or intervention to reduce infarct size in humans would be optimized if therapy were begun less than four hours of onset of symptoms. With the realization of the wavefront phenomenon and the potential salvage of myocardium at risk with reperfusion, the introduction of reperfusion in the clinical setting with thrombolytic agents or other procedures becomes highly desirable. Clot-selective thrombolytic agents, such as tissue plasminogen activator, diminish the adverse effects and high costs of intracoronary thrombolytic therapy or PTCA. Consequently, it is probable that the initial procedure of choice would be the use of clot-selective thrombolytic therapy. Thrombolytic therapy only lyses thrombi and does not affect the underlying causes of the coronary artery occlusion. Therefore, therapy to reduce the chances of reinfarction and death must also be initiated. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, in selected patients, should reduce the reocclusion rate. Beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents appear to be an excellent therapy for reducing mortality when administered chronically; these agents reduce myocardial oxygen consumption and reverse the imbalance between oxygen supply and oxygen demand caused by activation of the sympathetic nervous system and actions of catecholamines. Since thrombus formation has occurred at least once in patients who survive an MI, it is probable that the conditions for thrombus formation still exist. Therefore, institution of antiplatelet aggregating drugs, such as aspirin, would seem to be an appropriate prophylactic regimen. Beta blockers and possibly nitroglycerin have desirable effects when thrombolysis is unavailable. The efficacy of calcium-channel blocking agents on reduction of infarct size appears to be limited, although in the setting of stable and unstable angina postinfarction, these agents can play an important role.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "57": "The influence of beta-adrenoceptor-blockade on skeletal muscle was studied in ten healthy males with propranolol, atenolol and pindolol randomly given for 8 days each in a cross-over double blind test. After 7 days on each drug, muscle function was tested by an isokinetic dynamometer. Thermogenesis in biopsy samples taken from vastus lateralis muscle after a low grade exercise was studied after 8 days on each drug by direct calorimetry with a perfusion microcalorimeter. Before drug administration, a median heat production rate of 0.67 mW/g of muscle was measured. This value was significantly reduced by 25% during propranolol, but no significant change was found during atenolol or pindolol administration. Peak torque decline during isokinetic endurance test changed significantly in knee flexor but not in extensor muscles, from 15% to 27% after propranolol and from 15% to 23% after pindolol. Maximum dynamic strength was unaltered. Our data suggest that blockade of sympathetic beta 2-receptors decreases thermogenesis in human skeletal muscle and impairs isokinetic endurance.", 
    "58": "Arterial pressure and plasma catecholamine concentrations were measured in 16 normotensive and 10 hypertensive patients undergoing elective vascular surgery. Following induction of anaesthesia, both arterial pressure and plasma noradrenaline concentrations decreased in both groups. Following laryngoscopy, there was a moderate increase in arterial pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive patients. In normotensive patients, laryngoscopy was associated with a moderate increase in plasma noradrenaline concentration. There was no change in adrenaline concentration. By contrast, there was a marked increase in noradrenaline concentration, a moderate increase in adrenaline concentration and an arterial pressure response in the group of hypertensive patients. These data are consistent with transient sympathetic overactivity in hypertensive patients following noxious stimuli such as laryngoscopy.", 
    "59": "Active uptake of a labelled nonmetabolizable amino acid, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB), into isolated superior cervical sympathetic ganglia (SCG) excised from adult rats was considerably stimulated by the addition of either norepinephrine (NE, 50 microM) or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine (dopamine, DA, 100 microM) to the medium during aerobic incubation for 2 h at 37 degrees C. The NE-induced increase in AIB uptake was significantly antagonized by the addition of an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist (prazosin, 10 microM) in SCG axotomized 1 week prior to the examination, in which most of the ganglionic neurons had degenerated and reactive proliferation of the satellite glial components was in progress. The addition of neither acetylcholine (ACh, 1 mM) plus eserine (0.1 mM) nor cyclic nucleotides (1 mM) changed the AIB uptake by the SCG. In the axotomized SCG, the NE-evoked increase in AIB uptake was much more pronounced than that of intact or denervated SCG. A kinetic study of the active AIB uptake in the SCG showed that NE produced a decrease of the Km value and an increase in the Vmax, especially in the axotomized SCG. Ganglionic Na+, K+-ATPase activity was greatly stimulated in the presence of NE, but not by ACh. These results strongly suggest that the NE-induced enhancement of active AIB uptake in the isolated SCG is occurring in glial cells rather than in neuronal cells, with a possible alteration of membrane properties for amino acid uptake and with an apparent regulation by the stimulated transport enzyme Na+, K+-ATPase.", 
    "60": "Pharmacotherapy of aggressive or agitated behaviors in the dementia patient has not been studied extensively, despite the prevalence of this problem. Neuroleptics have the most support for efficacy, with shorter acting benzodiazepines demonstrating benefit on occasion. However, studies done to date indicate that these drugs are effective only for a minority of patients and that side effects frequently make patients worse. Other medications, such as propranolol, carbamazepine, or lithium, may be helpful, but their efficacy in dementia patients has not been demonstrated in placebo-controlled studies. Until such studies are done, their use is most appropriate in special patient groups or in patients who have failed neuroleptic or benzodiazepine treatment. More studies are needed in elderly patients evaluating effectiveness of pharmacologic agents in specific types of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Most studies done to date have been of relatively short duration, usually two months or less. Because these medications often are given to dementia patients for prolonged periods, studies are needed to define the long-term clinical efficacy of these agents. In the clinical setting, these agents should be reduced periodically or discontinued to determine ongoing need. In addition, environmental, social, or behavioral methods of reducing agitated behaviors need to be explored as an adjunct to any medication trial.", 
    "61": "The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that moderately severe exercise-induced regional myocardial ischemia can be prevented by combined pharmacologic intervention. Eight chronically instrumented dogs were studied using an ameroid constrictor to produce critical stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery. The dogs were studied during steady state treadmill exercise that induced regional myocardial dysfunction (reduced systolic wall thickening; sonomicrometers) and ischemia (reduced subendocardial blood flow; microspheres). During a control exercise run, wall thickening in the ischemic posterior wall decreased from 21.4 to 13.3% whereas subendocardial blood flow failed to increase normally (36% of that in the normal zone). In the control anterior wall, both wall thickening and subendocardial blood flow increased significantly during the control run. Wall thickness-left ventricular pressure loop areas were calculated as an index of regional work; this index increased abruptly with the onset of exercise in both regions but became significantly depressed in the ischemic region during the steady state exercise. Therapy with a combination of atenolol (0.3 mg/kg body weight orally), diltiazem (0.3 mg/kg intravenously) and isosorbide dinitrate (2.0 mg/kg orally) effectively prevented regional myocardial ischemia and regional dysfunction. After drug therapy, wall thickening in the posterior wall increased from 17.3% at rest to 18.8% during exercise, and the regional transmural blood flow pattern was markedly improved. The initial overshoot of the regional work index during exercise was blunted by the drug therapy, and at steady state no differences between the ischemic and control regions were detected. Thus, combined drug therapy can eliminate exercise-induced regional myocardial ischemic dysfunction and appears to normalize the oxygen supply-demand imbalance.", 
    "62": "The effects of hydralazine (HYD) on heart rate and blood pressure in the intact dog and on atrial rate and contractile force in the isolated atrium were investigated. HYD (0.1-1 mg) injected into the sinus node artery produced double peaked positive inotropic and negative chronotropic effects in a dose-related manner. The initial positive inotropic and negative chronotropic responses were not affected by propranolol and atropine, respectively. The second positive inotropic response was inhibited by propranolol or reserpine, but it was not suppressed by imipramine or tetrodotoxin. When HYD (0.1-1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously to the donor dog, an initial increase followed by a decrease in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate were observed. In the isolated atrium, an increase in contractile force was induced. The increases of blood pressure and heart rate in the donor dog and the positive inotropic effect in the isolated atrium after HYD treatment were suppressed by reserpine. These results suggest that HYD has direct positive inotropic and negative chronotropic effects and indirect cardiac stimulating effects caused by a release of catecholamines from sympathetic nerve terminals, and that HYD-induced catecholamine release is not mediated by a tyramine-like action or via nerve excitation.", 
    "63": "This study was undertaken to characterize the cardiac electrophysiological and mechanical effects of MDL 19205, a new and potent nonglycoside, positive inotropic agent. In addition, intracellular Na+ activity (aiNa) was measured to determine if this agent might produce its inotropic effects by increasing aiNa and secondarily by increasing intracellular calcium via Na+ -Ca2+ exchange. Experiments were conducted in free-running trabecular muscles and Purkinje fibers obtained from sheep hearts. The following were the most significant effects of MDL 19205: a decrease in action potential duration in both ventricular and Purkinje tissues; a cumulative dose-dependent increase in contractile force in ventricular muscle but not in Purkinje strands; no change in aiNa in Purkinje fibers to accompany the positive inotropic effect of this agent; a shift in the dose-response relation by approximately fourfold in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade with sotalol (10(-7) M); an enhancement of diastolic depolarization in Purkinje fibers resulting in automaticity that is accelerated by overdrive; and a potentiation of the positive inotropic effects of MDL 19205 by 8-bromo-cAMP (1 mM), indicating a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitory action of MDL 19205. These results suggest that MDL 19205 exerts at least part of its positive inotropic and automatic actions through stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors. This action occurs in conjunction with its ability to inhibit phosphodiesterase, thus promoting an accumulation of cAMP in cardiac cells. Other intracellular actions may also contribute to the effect of this drug, but they do not rely on an increase in aiNa or dramatic changes in the action potential plateau or duration.", 
    "64": "In anesthetized dogs, the effects of intracoronary leukotriene D4 (LTD4) (0.5 micrograms/kg) were studied on hemodynamics, the electrocardiogram (ECG) (lead II), flow in the left circumflex (LCX) coronary artery, and resistance in the absence or presence of intravenously administered cardiovascular drugs: nifedipine (10 micrograms/kg), nitroglycerin (5 micrograms/kg/min), isosorbide dinitrate (100 micrograms/kg), molsidomine (500 micrograms/kg), propranolol (500 micrograms/kg), and phentolamine (250 micrograms/kg). LTD4 increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) by 126% (p less than 0.01), the S-T segments of the ECG from 0.3 to 2.4 mV (p less than 0.001), and coronary resistance from 3.5 to 35.7 mm Hg X min X ml-1 (p less than 0.001). LCX blood flow fell from 33.8 to 3 ml/min (p less than 0.001), and LV dP/dtmax decreased by 51% (p less than 0.05). Nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate were ineffective on cardiovascular LTD4 actions. Nifedipine and molsidomine inhibited the coronary flow reduction with LVEDP and S-T segment elevation by the LTD4 vasoconstriction. Negative inotropic LTD4 effects were counteracted by molsidomine. Phentolamine augmented the degree and duration of coronary constriction after LTD4. Propranolol weakened the coronary and circulatory eicosanoid actions. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg, i.v.) neither abolished the LTD4-caused hemodynamic and electrocardiographic consequences, nor attenuated beneficial nifedipine or molsidomine antagonism. Thus, it can be considered that nifedipine may inhibit the Ca2+ influx required for the effects of exogenously administered LTD4. LTD4 apparently does not act over cardiac alpha- or beta-receptor activation. Molsidomine effects on cardiohemodynamics with platelet and coronary vascular eicosanoid actions may protect the heart against LTD4 induced derangement.", 
    "65": "The effects of perinephritis hypertension on lymphocyte and cardiac beta-adrenoceptors in the rabbit were examined. Hypertensive animals 8-12 weeks after surgery had an increase in cardiac weight consistent with hypertrophy compared with sham-operated age-matched controls. Specific binding of [I125] iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) to cardiac ventricular membranes was reduced in the hypertensive animals (Bmax44 +/- 14 in hypertensives and 30 +/- 15 fmoles/mg protein in controls; p less than 0.01). However, weight-matched ventricles from a group of older sham-operated normotensive rabbits showed a similar cardiac beta-receptor number to that found in the hypertensive animals. There were no changes in affinity of the ligand for the binding site. The reduction in cardiac beta-receptor density was not accompanied by changes in the chronotropic or blood pressure responses to isoprenaline in the conscious animal. Specific ICYP binding to lymphocyte beta-receptors did not differ significantly between the hypertensive and age-matched normotensive animals. Lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors thus may not always reflect changes in heart beta-adrenoceptors, and changes in receptor density may not be directly related to blood pressure or have identifiable functional significance.", 
    "66": "In 41 essential hypertensive patients, the intraerythrocytic free calcium (aiCa2+) was determined before and after oral treatment with beta-adrenoreceptor blockers (atenolol, metipranolol, and pindolol). The measurements were performed by means of an ion-selective electrode. During the 4 weeks of treatment, the aiCa2+ decreased from 7.4 +/- 2.3 (mean +/- SD) to 4.1 +/- 1.7 mumol/l (p less than 0.001) in the total group of 41 patients. In the patients treated with atenolol (n,15), the aiCa2+ decreased from 7.1 +/- 1.8 to 4.4 +/- 1.7 mumol/l (p less than 0.001); in those treated with metipranolol (n,13), aiCa2+ decreased from 7.4 +/- 2.7 to 4.3 +/- 2.0 mumol/l (p less than 0.001); and in those treated with pindolol (n,13), aiCa2+ decreased from 7.6 +/- 2.4 to 3.8 +/- 1.5 mumol/l (p less than 0.001). In the total group, the mean reduction of the mean blood pressure was 12 mm Hg. In the atenolol subgroup, the blood pressure was reduced by 11 mm Hg, in the metipranolol subgroup by 15 mm Hg, and in the pindolol subgroup by 18 mm Hg. Thus, the reduction of the blood pressure during beta-adrenoreceptor blockade is accompanied by a reduction of the free calcium of the red cells. The calcium lowering effect as the antihypertensive potency is roughly equal among the different beta-adrenoreceptor blockers.", 
    "67": "The effects on hemodynamics and left ventricular function of propranolol and pindolol, beta-blockers without and with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), respectively, were compared in six men with stable exertional angina at rest and during symptom-limited bicycle exercise. The study was controlled and double blinded, and the order of drug administration was randomized. The dosage of each drug (propranolol 0.15 mg/kg i.v., pindolol 0.02 mg/kg i.v.) was chosen to reduce exercise tachycardia by approximately 18%. Exercise capacity and duration were similar after each drug, and both drugs similarly reduced ST depression during exercise. At rest, propranolol significantly reduced heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, rate-pressure product, stroke volume index, cardiac index, and left ventricular ejection fraction, and increased systemic vascular resistance. In contrast, pindolol significantly reduced only the rate-pressure product and cardiac index, and to a lesser extent than propranolol. During exercise on the other hand, both drugs reduced the heart rate, arterial pressure, rate-pressure product, and cardiac index to a similar degree. Neither drug altered pulmonary artery wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance, stroke volume index, left ventricular ejection fraction, or left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indices. At equipotent beta-blocking dosages, ISA in pindolol reduced the effects of beta-blockade on resting hemodynamics and left ventricular function compared to propranolol, but during exercise the influence of ISA was reduced; and both pindolol and propranolol exert similar effects on hemodynamics and left ventricular function.", 
    "68": "Beta sympathetic stimulation and the beta-adrenergic agonists exert a variety of electrophysiologic effects which contribute to the genesis of ischaemia-related arrhythmias. These are both primary, most likely related to enhancement of the slow calcium current, and secondary, resulting from changes in the metabolism of the ischaemic myocardium as reflected in the accumulation of ions and other end products of metabolism in the extracellular space. In addition, the regional influence of these changes may contribute to the ionic and electrical inhomogeneities. Further studies are needed to define more precisely the factors responsible for the enhanced arrhythmogenicity attributed to beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "69": "Unstable angina pectoris is a high-risk ischemic syndrome with complex, interacting pathophysiologic mechanisms that include coronary atherosclerosis, coronary vasoconstriction, and thrombosis. The roles of various medical strategies, including nitrates, beta blockers, calcium antagonists, and antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and thrombolytic agents, are discussed in conjunction with revascularization procedures such as coronary angioplasty and bypass surgery.", 
    "70": "Silent myocardial ischemia is defined as objective evidence of myocardial ischemia occurring in the absence of symptoms in a patient who has either coronary artery disease or spasm. The largest number of patients with silent myocardial ischemia identified to date are those with effort angina, in whom silent episodes are at least three to four times as frequent as painful episodes. Since episodes of silent myocardial ischemia are not alarming to the patient and are likely to escape detection, their clinical importance must reside in their association with morbid events of ischemic heart disease. In fact, silent myocardial ischemia can result in silent myocardial infarction, sudden death, or other events. The detection of these episodes has the potential to provide clinicians with a more complete understanding of all the ischemic processes occurring in patients with angina or other forms of coronary disease. Silent myocardial ischemia can be detected by a variety of methods. Transient ischemic-type electrocardiographic abnormalities that occur without symptoms and that have been recorded during exercise testing or by means of ambulatory, coronary care unit, or telemetry monitoring may be used to document silent myocardial ischemia. Reversible left ventricular wall motion abnormalities without symptoms, observed at rest or during exercise radionuclide angiography, 2-D echocardiography, or contrast angiography, may also be used to document silent myocardial ischemia. However, only ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring provides long-term evaluation that documents repeated episodes of silent myocardial ischemia outside of the laboratory. Controlled studies, directed specifically at preventing silent myocardial ischemia and/or its consequences in patients with angina, are limited. It has been determined, however, that both hourly administration of sublingual nitroglycerin and intravenous administration of isosorbide dinitrate are effective. Other studies examining the effects of beta blockers (propranolol, atenolol, and labetalol) in the treatment of angina have shown that their use also results in a reduced frequency of silent episodes, but that a large number of episodes persist. It has been observed that verapamil alone and nifedipine, either alone or in combination with a beta blocker, appear to significantly decrease silent myocardial ischemia in patients with angina. A major limitation of these studies is that treatment was not specifically titrated to reduce or eliminate silent myocardial ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "71": "In anaesthetised greyhounds, vertebral and carotid artery infusions of bradykinin increased blood pressure whereas intravenous infusions caused a decrease. With each route of administration, heart rate and cardiac output increased while total peripheral resistance fell. With cranial artery infusions, the consecutive pretreatments of propranolol, phentolamine and vagal cooling resulted in a progressive reduction in the heart rate responses and conversion of the pressor to depressor responses. The responses to intravenous infusions of bradykinin were little changed. In contrast, when the initial pretreatment was interruption of vagal transmission, cranial artery infusions of bradykinin were at once depressor and the depressor response to intravenous infusions immediately enhanced. Subsequent propranolol and phentolamine were without further effect on the blood pressure responses although propranolol did reduce the tachycardia responses. It is concluded that while the tachycardia induced by cranial artery infusions of bradykinin has both cardiac sympathetic and vagal withdrawal components, the hypertensive action is mediated by an increase in cardiac output due largely to withdrawal of cardiac vagal tone.", 
    "72": "The effect of age and of imipramine treatment on cortical serotonin and beta-adrenergic binding sites and on pineal N-acetylserotonin and melatonin were examined in Fischer-344 rats. Cortical serotonin-1 and -2 receptor binding was reduced by 15 and 22.5% respectively, in 24 vs. 6 months old animals. Ten single daily imipramine (10 mg/kg) injections in the aged animals resulted in reductions in both types of serotonin sites, while in adult animals significant binding reduction occurred only at the 5HT2 site. Cortical beta-adrenoceptor binding was also diminished in the aged rats. Imipramine treatment elicited a significantly greater decrease in these adrenergic sites in the aged (39.2%) than in the adult (27.6%) animals. In the pineal gland, N-acetylserotonin and melatonin content were reduced by age; imipramine treatment induced decreases in both indoles in the adult animals and a reduction in N-acetylserotonin in the aged animals. These age-related effects of imipramine on cortical serotonin receptor and beta-adrenoceptor binding and on pineal indoles may be a consequence of the higher drug and metabolite (desmethylimipramine) blood and tissue concentrations which were found in the aged animals.", 
    "73": "Chronic (10 days) application of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) to male and female rats results in a significant but highly localized decrease in beta-adrenoceptor number. Saturation studies on homogenized tissue revealed a decrease in Bmax in the frontal cortex and hippocampus but not in caudate or cerebellum of both sexes. Quantitative autoradiographic analysis showed the changes in the hippocampus to be in the CA1 and dentate gyrus but not CA3. No effect was seen in caudate, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, cerebellar molecular and granular layers and several thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei.", 
    "74": "Dependence is a recognized problem in a significant number of patients taking therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines. A characteristic withdrawal syndrome has been described. These patients are best managed as outpatients with gradual dosage reduction over 4-12 weeks. Pharmacological adjuncts such as propranolol and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics are useful for certain specific symptoms, but so far no single substance has proved useful in attenuating the majority of symptoms. Psychological and social support should be maximized, but here again no single technique has been shown to be more than moderately successful. The best treatment is thoughtful prescribing ab initio.", 
    "75": "Gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension is a severe complication in patients with cirrhosis. Recurrent hemorrhage occurs in 75% of patients at 2 years, and medical treatment aims to induce a permanent decrease in portal pressure. A controlled study demonstrated that continuous administration of propranolol significantly decreased the risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding in selected cirrhotic patients in good health. This efficacy was not found in unselected patients. The risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding correlates with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and poor compliance. Sclerotherapy of esophageal varices consists in obstruction of the varicosities. It has been demonstrated that esophageal sclerotherapy significantly reduces recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, although a number of complications may occur.", 
    "76": "A method for determining bucindolol, a deuterated analogue and two metabolites in plasma samples is described. Analytes are obtained from plasma by liquid extraction of 1 ml of plasma at pH 10.5 with 7 ml of peroxide-free ether-hexane (4:1). Following derivatization with 50 microliters of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide-pyridine (1:1) for 20 min at 65 degrees C the samples are analyzed by capillary column gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected-ion monitoring. Quantification is linear over the range 2-500 ng/ml. Single-day precision was typically 6.2% or better for bucindolol and 13% or better for the metabolites.", 
    "77": "Beta 2-adrenergic receptors comprise 40% of the total beta-receptor population in failing human right ventricles, as deduced from computer modeling of iodine-125 iodocyanopindolol-ICI 118,551 competition curves. A myocardial cell origin of at least some of the beta 2 subpopulation was demonstrated by documenting a beta 2-receptor mediated positive inotropic response to the selective beta 2 agonist zinterol. It is concluded that beta 2-adrenergic receptors are present on human ventricular myocardial cells.", 
    "78": "Epinephrine was infused intravenously in 9 normal volunteers to plasma concentrations similar to those found after acute myocardial infarction. This study was undertaken on 3 occasions after 5 days of treatment with placebo or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol, which is relatively beta 1 selective, or timolol, which blocks both beta 1 and beta 2 receptors. Epinephrine increased the systolic blood pressure (BP), decreased the diastolic BP and increased the heart rate modestly. These changes were prevented by atenolol. However, after timolol the diastolic BP rose by +19 mm Hg and heart rate fell by -8 beats/min. Epinephrine caused the corrected QT interval to lengthen (0.36 +/- 0.02 to 0.41 +/- 0.06 second). No significant changes were found in the corrected QT interval when subjects were pretreated with atenolol or timolol. The serum potassium decreased from 4.06 to 3.22 mmol/liter after epinephrine. Serum potassium decreased to a lesser extent to 3.67 mmol/liter after atenolol and actually increased to 4.25 mmol/liter after timolol. In a further study with a similar design another nonselective beta blocker propranolol also increased potassium after epinephrine. While atenolol also prevented hypokalemia in this study, it did not block the beta 2-receptor mediated decrease in diastolic BP. Epinephrine-induced hypokalemia results from stimulation of a beta-adrenoceptor linked to membrane sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase causing potassium influx. This appears to be predominantly mediated by beta 2 receptors although beta 1 receptors may also play a part.", 
    "79": "The effects of atenolol (50 mg) and propranolol (40 mg) on exercise- and isoproterenol-induced heart rate increments were studied in 9 male volunteers. Propranolol reduced maximal heart rate from 187 +/- 4 to 146 +/- 7 beats/min and atenolol reduced it to 138 +/- 6 beats/min. There was no difference between the drugs at any point during exercise. Isoproterenol sensitivity was measured as the dose of isoproterenol required to increase resting heart rate by 25 beats/min (CD-25). Propranolol increased the CD-25 from 1.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms after placebo to 39 +/- 8 micrograms and atenolol increased the CD-25 to 8 +/- 2 micrograms. The increase by propranolol was significantly greater than that of atenolol. Intravenous atropine (0.04 mg/kg) did not alter the isoproterenol CD-25 during placebo or atenolol. The CD-25 with propranolol decreased after atropine (39 +/- 8 versus 25 +/- 5 micrograms) and was due to diminished plasma propranolol concentrations as the drug sensitivity (measured by Ka) was unchanged before (12 +/- 2 ml/ng) and after (10 +/- 3 ml/ng) atropine. These data support the hypothesis that moderate exercise is primarily a beta 1-mediated response and therefore equally antagonized by cardioselective and nonselective blockers, but that isoproterenol stimulates both beta 1 and beta 2 receptors. The greater ability of the nonselective agent to antagonize isoproterenol tachycardia with no significant change after atropine suggests the presence of cardiac beta 2 chronotropic receptors. The physiologic and pathologic importance of these receptors has yet to be determined.", 
    "80": "Congestive heart failure is the most arrhythmogenic disorder in cardiovascular medicine. As left ventricular performance deteriorates and symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue become progressively more severe, nearly all patients with heart failure experience frequent and complex ventricular tachyarrhythmias and nearly half die suddenly during long-term follow-up. This imminent risk of sudden death appears to be present for all patients with congestive heart failure; ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and programmed electrical stimulation are not useful in distinguishing patient subsets that are particularly predisposed to fatal arrhythmic events. Although conventional antiarrhythmic agents are widely prescribed as a nonspecific approach to prevent sudden death in these patients, there is little evidence to indicate that these drugs possess clinically important antiarrhythmic activity in patients with congestive heart failure, and these agents frequently serve to exacerbate the heart failure state and the underlying ventricular tachyarrhythmia. A useful approach to the prevention of sudden death in patients with congestive heart failure addresses the reversible causes of lethal ventricular arrhythmias in these individuals. Both experimental and clinical evidence indicates that circulating neurohormones and electrolyte deficits (particularly of potassium and magnesium) interact to provoke malignant ventricular ectopic rhythms and that the prevention of electrolyte depletion and the use of neurohormonal antagonists may exert clinically important antiarrhythmic actions. This physiologic approach may prove to be a more effective means of ameliorating the problem of sudden death than the empiric administration of conventional antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "81": "Comparative pharmacologic studies have indicated that the cardiac beta 2 adrenoceptors of vertebrate species are \"adrenaline\" receptors; i.e., the distribution of beta 2 receptors in the heart seems to be related to the amounts of adrenaline in the sympathetic nerves and in the circulation, and the beta 2 receptors seem to be stimulated mainly by adrenaline. In the human right atrium the order of potency for the agonists and the blocking agents indicate a relatively high proportion of active beta 2 receptors. These findings are in agreement with radioligand binding studies demonstrating up to 50% beta 2 receptors in myocardial membrane preparations. The pharmacologic studies thus add support to the assumption that these beta 2 receptors are functionally active and not merely experimental oddities. It is hypothesized that in normal situations the beta 2-receptor effects are additive to the beta 1 effects. However, during acute stress situations the large amounts of released adrenaline are assumed to increase markedly both inotropy and chronotropy in the heart via beta 2 receptors. It is postulated that only unselective beta blockers can abolish all beta-receptor effects in the heart during stress reactions with profound catecholamine stimulation."
