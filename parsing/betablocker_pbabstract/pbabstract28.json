Different Non-selective \u03b2-blockers like propranolol, nadolol, timolol, atenolol, metoprolol and carvedilol have been in clinical practice in patients with cirrhosis. Carvedilol has proven 2-4 times more potent than propranolol as a beta-receptor blocker in trials conducted testing its efficacy for heart failure. Whether the same effect extends to its potency in the reduction of portal venous pressures is a topic of on-going debate. The aim of this review is to compare the hemodynamic and clinical effects of carvedilol with propranolol, and attempt assess whether carvedilol can be used instead of propranolol in patients with cirrhosis. Carvedilol is a promising agent among the beta blockers of recent time that has shown significant effects in portal hypertension hemodynamics. It has also demonstrated an effective profile in its clinical application specifically for the prevention of variceal bleeding. Carvedilol has more potent desired physiological effects when compared to Propranolol. However, it is uncertain at the present juncture whether the improvement in hemodynamics also translates into a decreased rate of disease progression and complications when compared to propranolol. Currently Carvedilol shows promise as a therapy for portal hypertension but more clinical trials need to be carried out before we can consider it as a superior option and a replacement for propranolol.",

Our purpose is to analyze the influence of the previous use of \u03b2-blockers on the early course of patients admitted because of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We analyzed the data of 37.359 patients included in the ARIAM-Andalucia Registry. Of them, 7759 (20.8%) were previously receiving \u03b2-blockers. BB patients were older, more often female, had more risk factors and vascular disease, and less often had an ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the unadjusted analysis, BB patients less often had ventricular fibrillation or atrioventricular block, and more often a Killip classification >1, and no difference of in-hospital mortality (5.7 vs 5.6%). After logistic regression analysis and propensity score matching, no differences in complications or mortality (odds ratio 0.997, 95% confidence interval 0.882-1.128) were found in relationship to previous \u03b2-blockers. In conclusion, we find that the previous administration of \u03b2-blockers is not an independent predictor of the early prognosis of ACS.",

HVPG was determined at the time patients were assigned to groups (baseline) and 2 weeks later. In the medical group, patients with an adequate reduction in HVPG (responders) remained on the drugs whereas nonresponders underwent only variceal band ligation. The study was closed 10 months after the last patient was assigned to a group. The primary end point was variceal rebleeding.

Rebleeding occurred in 6 of 23 patients (26%) receiving medical treatment before hemodynamic control was possible. Per-protocol analysis showed that rebleeding occurred in a smaller proportion of the 32 responders (18%) than in nonresponders who received variceal band ligation (31%) (P = .06).

Although there are no major differences between them, there are discrepancies that can have an impact on treatment and prognosis for individuals with hypertension. This article analyzes the main controversial elements in the guides and presents the recommendations of the Sociedad Centroamericana y del Caribe de Hipertensi\u00f3n y Prevenci\u00f3n Cardiovascular (Caribbean Society for Hypertension and Cardiovascular Prevention). The main differences are found a) in the categorization of prehypertension, b) in the use of global cardiovascular risk in the decision to begin antihypertensive treatment, c) in the validity of beta-blockers as first-line drugs in treating uncomplicated hypertension, and d) the increase in the therapeutic goal of maintaining values between < 140/90 and < 150/90 mmHg in patients over 60 years of age with no history of diabetes or chronic kidney disease. All the factors in favor of and against accepting each of these four controversial criteria are analyzed critically and the observations made by the Society are included. The conclusion is that there are pros and cons for all controversial elements in the hypertension guides. However, the weight of the evidence and clinical judgment favor subdividing prehypertension into stages I and II, seeking a therapeutic goal of maintaining systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg in all the hypertensive patients under 80 years of age, retaining beta-blockers as first-line drugs in uncomplicated hypertension, and not delaying the start of drug treatment for hypertension stage I with low global cardiovascular risk. Finally, seven recommendations by the Society based on the analysis are included.",

A healthy 55-year-old man without significant past medical history arrived in the ED with a unique presentation of a primary mitral valve prolapse with an atrial septal defect uncommon in cardiology literature. Early recognition of mitral valve prolapse in high-risk patients for severe mitral regurgitation or patients with underlying cardiovascular abnormalities such as an atrial septal defect is crucial to prevent morbid outcomes such as sudden cardiac death.", 
    "22": "The Joint National Committee (JNC 8) hypertension guidelines have modified the blood pressure goals across the spectrum of disease processes and patient characteristics. This article will elucidate these changes and help clinicians improve the clinical care of patients with hypertension. Patients are now conceptually categorized into two different patient populations: those who are at a low- or high-risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). A low-risk population comprises patients aged 60 or older who do not have disease processes that enhance ASCVD or CKD disease development. High-risk patients are those with CKD and/or diabetes, and patients less than 60 years of age who remain at risk of future development. The current recommendation for blood-pressure goals in the low- and high-risk population is 150/90 mmHg and 140/90 mmHg, respectively. In all patients considered for antihypertensive therapy, the first line antihypertensive pharmacotherapy should include either a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Beta blockers no longer have a role as standalone therapy. Thiazide- type diuretics and CCB continue to demonstrate benefit in the African American population and should continue to be considered as first line agents. CKD patients with concomitant hypertension should be treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB.",

We aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of propranolol alone and propranolol primed with systemic corticosteroids on the outcome of infantile hemangioma. A prospective randomized study included 40 infants aged less than 9 months with cutaneous hemangiomas. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: group A were given oral prednisolone for the initial 2 weeks combined with oral propranolol, while group B were given oral propranolol alone for 6 months. The median age of the studied patients was 4.5 months (ranged 4 weeks-8 months). Sequential determination of the dimensions of the hemangiomas based on direct measurement and photographic analysis were performed. A significant reduction in the size of the lesions was found in group A in the 2-, 4-, and 8-week evaluation compared to group B (p\u2009<\u20090.001) with no statistical difference in the ultimate 6 month response (p\u2009=\u20090.134). Multiple logistic regression showed that early treatment before 6 months of age (OR 9.82, p\u2009=\u20090.007) and combined treatment with propranolol and prednisolone (OR 10.71, p\u2009=\u20090.006) were the predictors of best response.",

Like all air-breathing fishes studied to date, the African catfish exhibits pronounced changes in heart rate (f H) that are associated with air-breathing events. We acquired f H, gill-breathing frequency (f G) and air-breathing frequency (f AB) in situations that require or do not require air breathing (during normoxia and hypoxia), and we assessed the autonomic control of post-air-breathing tachycardia using an infusion of the \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist propranolol and the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist atropine. During normoxia, C. gariepinus presented low f AB (1.85 \u00b1 0.73 AB h(-1)) and a constant f G (43.16 \u00b1 1.74 breaths min(-1)). During non-critical hypoxia (PO2 = 60 mmHg), f AB in the African catfish increased to 5.42 \u00b1 1.19 AB h(-1) and f G decreased to 39.12 \u00b1 1.58 breaths min(-1). During critical hypoxia (PO2 = 20 mmHg), f AB increased to 7.4 \u00b1 1.39 AB h(-1) and f G decreased to 34.97 \u00b1 1.78 breaths min(-1). These results were expected for a facultative air breather. Each air breath (AB) was followed by a brief but significant tachycardia, which in the critical hypoxia trials, reached a maximum of 143 % of the pre-AB f H values of untreated animals. Pharmacological blockade allowed the calculation of cardiac autonomic tones, which showed that post-AB tachycardia is predominantly regulated by the parasympathetic subdivision of the autonomic nervous system.",

This included the replication of validity testing and the collection of normative data. Following translation and adaptation according to cross-cultural guidelines, the questionnaires were administered as a pre-test to a sample of 20 healthy subjects and then to 10 patients. The questionnaires were then administered to 120 healthy subjects equally distributed by sex, education, and age, to collect normative data from an Italian population. The questionnaires were easily administered to both healthy subjects and patients. Statistical analysis on normative data was conducted to find the mean value for each questionnaire.

The \u03b2-adrenergic blocker was only effective when the drug was administered upon memory reactivation, and a modification in cognitive representations was not necessary to observe a change in fear behavior. A new wave of treatments that pharmacologically target the synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory seems to be within reach.",

In the analysis of the patient distribution of blood pressure variability, patients receiving \u03b2 blockers occurred more frequently in the higher blood pressure variability (P = .0023). Treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers and cilnidipine, which blocks N-type calcium channels, was shown to be more frequently associated with the lower blood pressure variability (P = .0202 and .0467).

The enzymatic kinetic resolution strategy was used to synthesize enantiopure intermediates (R)- and (S)-N-(3-acetyl-4-(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl)butyramide from the corresponding racemic alcohols. The results showed that out of eleven commercially available lipase preparations, two enzyme preparations (Lipase A, Candida antarctica, CLEA [CAL CLEA] and Candida rugosa lipase, 62316 [CRL 62316]) act in enantioselective manner. Under optimized conditions the enantiomeric excess of both (R)- and (S)-N-(3-acetyl-4-(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl)butyramide were 99.9 and 96.8%, respectively. N-alkylation of both the (R) and (S) intermediates with isopropylamine gave enantiomerically pure (R and S)- acebutolol with a yield 68 and 72%, respectively.

Nifedipine, a dihydropyridine-based L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB), has been reported to have an anti-atherosclerotic effect beyond its blood pressure-lowering effect, but the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The present study was designed to investigate whether nifedipine affects sCD40L release from collagen-stimulated human platelets and to determine the potential role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b2/-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3). We found that treatment with nifedipine significantly inhibited the platelet surface CD40L expression and sCD40L release in response to collagen, while the inhibition was markedly reversed by blocking PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3 activity with specific antagonist such as GSK0660 and GW9662. Meanwhile, nifedipine also enhanced nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic GMP formation in a PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3-dependent manner. When the NO/cyclic GMP pathway was suppressed, nifedipine-mediated inhibition of sCD40L release was abolished significantly. Collagen-induced phosphorylation of p38MAPK, ERK1/2 and HSP27, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression/activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation were significantly inhibited by nifedipine, whereas these alterations were all attenuated by co-treatment with PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3 antagonists. Collectively, these results demonstrate that PPAR-\u03b2/-\u03b3-dependent pathways contribute to nifedipine-mediated downregulation of CD40L/sCD40L signaling in activated platelets through regulation of NO/ p38MAPK/ERK1/2/HSP27/MMP-2 signalings and provide a novel mechanism regarding the anti-atherosclerotic effect of nifedipine.",

Functional association of \u03b21AR with KV1 channels through PSD95 may represent a novel vasodilator complex in cerebral arteries (CA). We explored whether a \u03b21AR-PSD95-KV1 complex is a determinant of rat CA dilation. RT-PCR and western blots revealed expression of \u03b21AR in CA. Isoproterenol induced a concentration-dependent dilation of isolated, pressurized rat CA that was blocked by the \u03b21AR blocker CGP20712. Cranial window imaging of middle cerebral arterioles in situ showed isoproterenol- and norepinephrine-induced dilation that was blunted by \u03b21AR blockade. Isoproterenol-induced hyperpolarization of cVSMCs in pressurized CA was blocked by CGP20712. Confocal images of cVSMCs immunostained with antibodies against \u03b21AR and PSD95 indicated strong colocalization, and PSD95 co-immunoprecipitated with \u03b21AR in CA lysate. Blockade of KV1 channels, \u03b21AR or disruption of PSD95-KV1 interaction produced similar blunting of isoproterenol-induced dilation in pressurized CA. These findings suggest that PSD95 mediates a vasodilator complex with \u03b21AR and KV1 channels in cVSMCs. This complex may be critical for proper vasodilation in rat CA.",

Under strong oxidation conditions (2\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1) KMnO4, 24\u00a0h), only salbutamol did significantly react. In this way, the oxidation kinetics of salbutamol was further investigated at different concentrations of KMnO4, chloride, phosphate and sample pH by means of a full factorial experimental design. Depending on these factors, half-lives were in the range 1-144\u00a0min for drug and it was observed that KMnO4 concentration was the most significant factor, resulting in increased reaction rate as it is increased. Moreover, the reaction of salbutamol is also enhanced at basic pH and to a minor extent by the presence of phosphates, being both factors more relevant at low KMnO4 concentrations. The use of an accurate-mass LC-QTOF-MS system permitted the identification of a total of seven transformation products (TPs). The transformation path of the drug begins by the attack of KMnO4 on two double bonds of the aromatic ring of salbutamol via 3\u00a0+\u00a02 and 2\u00a0+\u00a02 addition reactions, which resulted in the ring opening and that continues with oxidative reactions to finally produce smaller size TPs, ending with tert-butyl-formamide, as the smallest TP identified. Reaction in real samples showed a slower and partial oxidation of the pharmaceutical, due to other competing water organic constituents, but still exceeding 60%. Moreover, the software predicted toxicity of TPs indicates that they are expected not to be more toxic than salbutamol, in contrast to the results obtained for the predicted toxicity of chlorination TPs, excepting predicted developmental toxicity.",

Six weeks later, rats were treated for 5-6 weeks with low-frequency EA 5 days/week, subcutaneous injection of 17\u03b2-estradiol (2.0\u2009\u00b5g) every fourth day, or a \u03b2-adrenergic blocker (propranolol hydrochloride, 0.1\u2009mg/kg) 5 days/week. Letrozole controls were handled without needle insertion or injected with sesame oil every fourth day. Estrous cyclicity, ovarian morphology, sex steroids, gonadotropins, insulin-like growth factor I, bone mineral density, and gene and protein expression in ovarian tissue were measured. Low-frequency EA induced estrous-cycle changes, decreased high levels of circulating luteinizing hormone (LH) and the LH/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio, decreased high ovarian gene expression of adiponectin receptor 2, and increased expression of adiponectin receptor 2 protein and phosphorylation of ERK1/2. EA also increased cortical bone mineral density. Propranolol decreased ovarian expression of Foxo3, Srd5a1, and Hif1a. Estradiol decreased circulating LH, induced estrous cycle changes, and decreased ovarian expression of Adipor1, Foxo3, and Pik3r1. Further, total bone mineral density was higher in the letrozole-estradiol group. Thus, EA modulates the circulating gonadotropin levels independently of sex steroids or \u03b2-adrenergic action and affects the expression of ovarian adiponectin system.",

Yet the lowest permeability of glipizide (terminal Ileum) was comparable to the lowest permeability of metoprolol (proximal jejunum). At the colon, similar permeability was evident for glipizide and metoprolol, that was higher than metoprolol's jejunal permeability. We present an analysis that identifies metoprolol's jejunal permeability as the low/high permeability class benchmark anywhere throughout the intestinal tract; we show that the permeability of both glipizide and metoprolol matches/exceeds this threshold throughout the entire intestinal tract, accounting for their success as controlled-release dosage form.

It is well known that HF is one of the most frequent reason of high mortality worldwide. HF is characterised by cardiac remodeling, which is central in the pathophysiology of HF including hemodynamic, neurohumoral and neurohormonal mechanisms during its development and established prognostic factor in patients suffered with this disease. Despite the introduction in medical practice of many drugs for the treatment of chronic HF the lethal outcome associated with HF remains high nowadays, which can be explained by complexity of remodeling mechanisms characteristic for development of HF. Ivabradine that has been introduced in medical practice in last decade is a pure heart rate-slowing agent. A large number of studies in patients with cardiovascular disease have demonstrated that heart rate (HR) is a very important and major independent risk factor for prognosis, because lowering of HR reduces cardiac work and diminished myocardial oxygen requirement. It was shown that ivabradine a selective inhibitor of the hyperpolarisation activated sodium chanel (If) is involved in pacemaker generation and responsiveness of the sino-atrial node resulting in HR reduction without negative inotropic action. Ivabradine in chronic HF improves diastolic function and attenuates cardiac tissue hypoxia. Long-term reduction of HR induced by ivabradine reduced remodeling and preserved nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, resulting from processes triggered early after reduction of HR. The complex therapy including ivabradine promotes HR fall, leading in reduction of attacks of a stable angina and improved quality of life. Ivabradine may target the endothelial NO production via inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B leading to endothelial protection. HR reduction by ivabradine reduces oxidative stress, improves endothelial function and prevents development of atherosclerostic changes in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. In multicenter clinical trials it has been proved that ivabradine is superior to beta-blocking agents during complex therapy of chronic HF accompanied with its beneficial effects related to cardiac remodeling, improvement of the currency of HF and diminution of patients rehospitalisation. It is suggested that ivabradine as a newer agent is a valuable perspective drug for the treatment of congestive HF.",

Prevention of complications should be started before the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) by working on risk factors and thereafter by intervention upon confirmatory diagnosis which can prevent further damage to \u03b2-cells. The actual risk of getting microvascular complications like microalbuminuria and retinopathy progression starts at glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7%. As per the American Diabetes Association, a new pediatric glycemic control target of HbA1c <7.5% across all ages replaces previous guidelines that had called for different targets by age. Evidence shows that prevalence of microvascular complications is greater in patients with age >20 years as compared to patients <10 years of age. Screening of these complications should be done regularly, and appropriate preventive strategies should be followed. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blocker reduce progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria and increase the regression rate to normoalbuminuria. Diabetic microvascular complications can be controlled with tight glycemic therapy, dyslipidemia management and blood pressure control along with renal function monitoring, lifestyle changes, including smoking cessation and low-protein diet. An integrated and personalized care would reduce the risk of development of microvascular complications in T1DM patients. The child with diabetes who receives limited care is more likely to develop long-term complications at an earlier age. Screening for subclinical complications and early interventions with intensive therapy is the need of the hour.", 
    "155": "Kv7.4 channels are a crucial determinant of arterial diameter both at rest and in response to endogenous vasodilators. However, nothing is known about the factors that ensure effective activity of these channels. We report that G-protein \u03b2\u03b3 subunits increase the amplitude and activation rate of whole-cell voltage-dependent K(+) currents sensitive to the Kv7 blocker linopirdine in HEK cells heterologously expressing Kv7.4, and in rat renal artery myocytes. In excised patch recordings, G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits (2-250 ng /mL) enhanced the open probability of Kv7.4 channels without changing unitary conductance. Kv7 channel activity was also augmented by stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors. Gallein, an inhibitor of G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits, prevented these stimulatory effects. Moreover, gallein and two other structurally different G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit inhibitors (GRK2i and a \u03b2-subunit antibody) abolished Kv7 channel currents in the absence of either G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit enrichment or G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation. Proximity ligation assay revealed that Kv7.4 and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits colocalized in HEK cells and renal artery smooth muscle cells. Gallein disrupted this colocalization, contracted whole renal arteries to a similar degree as the Kv7 inhibitor linopirdine, and impaired isoproterenol-induced relaxations. Furthermore, mSIRK, which disassociates G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits from \u03b1 subunits without stimulating nucleotide exchange, relaxed precontracted arteries in a linopirdine-sensitive manner. These results reveal that G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits are fundamental for Kv7.4 activation and crucial for vascular Kv7 channel activity, which has major consequences for the regulation of arterial tone.",

We assessed demographics, clinical characteristics, and chronic antihypertensive medication use in 598 community-dwelling people with hypertension, aged 70 to 97 years, then followed them prospectively for self-reported falls using monthly calendar postcards and telephone interviews. Antihypertensive medication use was not associated with an increased risk of falls. Participants reporting use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors had a significantly decreased 1-year risk of injurious falls (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.96), whereas those using calcium channel blockers had a decreased risk of all falls (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.91) and indoor falls (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.91), compared with participants not taking these drugs.

    "157": "Consensus practice guidelines and the implementation of clinical therapeutic advances are usually based on the results of large, randomized clinical trials (RCTs). However, RCTs generally inform us on an average treatment effect for a presumably homogeneous population, but therapeutic interventions rarely benefit the entire population targeted. Indeed, multiple RCTs have demonstrated that interindividual variability exists both in drug response and in the development of adverse effects. The field of pharmacogenomics promises to deliver the right drug to the right patient. Substantial progress has been made in this field, with advances in technology, statistical and computational methods, and the use of cell and animal model systems. However, clinical implementation of pharmacogenetic principles has been difficult because RCTs demonstrating benefit are lacking. For patients, the potential benefits of performing such trials include the individualization of therapy to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects. These trials would also enable investigators to reduce sample size and hence contain costs for trial sponsors. Multiple ethical, legal, and practical issues need to be considered for the conduct of genotype-based RCTs. Whether pre-emptive genotyping embedded in electronic health records will preclude the need for performing genotype-based RCTs remains to be seen.",

New-onset HF is more often characterized by preserved LVEF, milder baseline NYHA class and lower plasma natriuretic peptide values. After 3 months; 33 (5.2%) new-onset HF patients had died (p<0.001). Cox multivariate analysis showed a correlation between mortality and older age (hazard ratio - HR - 1.08), higher global comorbidity (HR 1.20) and lesser prescription of beta-blockers at discharge (HR 0.34).

Propranolol was administered within 48 hours of burns and given throughout hospital discharge to decrease heart rate by approximately 20% from admission levels. Wound healing was determined by comparing the time between grafting procedures. Blood loss was determined by comparing pre- and postoperative hematocrit while factoring in operative graft area. Data were collected between first admission and first discharge.",

Patients in the propranolol group received an average propranolol dose of 3.3 \u00b1 3.0 mg/kg/day. Daily average heart rate over the first 30 days was significantly lower in the propranolol group (P < 0.05). The average number of days between skin grafting procedures was also lower in propranolol patients (10 \u00b1 5 days) than in control patients (17 \u00b1 12 days; P = 0.02), indicative of a faster donor site healing time in the propranolol group. Packed red blood cell infusion was similar between groups (control 5.3 \u00b1 5.4 units vs. propranolol 4.4 \u00b1 3.1 units, P = 0.89). Propranolol was associated with a 5 to 7% improvement in perioperative hematocrit during grafting procedures of 4,000 to 16,000 cm(2) compared to control (P = 0.002).",

The polymers such as Tamarind gum, Okra gum and Chitosan were used in the formulation design. A model drug Propranolol HCl was incorporated in the formulation in order to assess the controlled release and time dependent release potential of various natural polymers. A novel polymer Tamarind gum was extracted and used as a prime polymer in this study to prove the superiority of this polymer over other leading natural polymer. Propranolol HCl was used as a model drug which undergoes hepatic metabolism and witnesses the poor bioavailability. The matrix tablets of Propranolol HCl were prepared by direct compression. The tablets were evaluated for various quality control parameters and found to be within the limits. Carbopol 940 was used as an auxiliary polymer to modify the drug release and physicochemical characteristics of the tablets. The in vitro release studies were performed in 0.1N HCl for 1.5h, followed by pH 6.8 phosphate buffer for 2h and pH 7.4 phosphate buffer till maximum amount of drug release. The in vitro release profile of the formulations were fitted with various pharmacokinetic mathematical models and analyzed for release profile. The formulations prepared with Tamarind gum prolonged the release for an extended period of time compared to other polymer based formulation and showed an excellent compression characteristic.",

This study investigated the impact of a nondepressor dose of carvedilol, which is a beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist with antioxidant activity, on septic renal injury induced in rats with cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Three groups of rats were studied. The first group was the sham-operated control. The other 2 groups of rats underwent CLP, and were administered either the vehicle or carvedilol (2.0 mg/kg body mass, by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, daily for 2 days as well as 30 min prior to CLP). Kidney function, inflammatory parameters, mitochondrial function, and renal perfusion pressure (RPP) were investigated at 6 and 18 h after CLP. Carvedilol did not significantly induce hypotension, and it significantly improved RPP and renal dysfunction induced with CLP, together with significant reductions in serum levels of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Septic kidney injury mediated increased levels of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyls. Carvedilol also attenuated the decrease in kidney mitochondrial glutathione and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate dehydrogenase. Further, intracellular renal edema and inflammation induced with CLP were reduced with carvedilol. These findings suggest renoprotective effects of carvedilol in sepsis.",

Although FGF21 stimulated browning results from a direct interaction between FGF21 and the adipocyte, browning is typically associated with activation of the sympathetic nervous system through cold exposure. We tested the hypothesis that FGF21 can act via the brain, to increase sympathetic activity and induce browning, independent of cell-autonomous actions. We administered FGF21 into the central nervous system via lateral ventricle infusion into male mice and found that the central treatment increased norepinephrine turnover in target tissues that include the inguinal white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue. Central FGF21 stimulated browning as assessed by histology, expression of uncoupling protein 1, and the induction of gene expression associated with browning. These effects were markedly attenuated when mice were treated with a \u03b2-blocker. Additionally, neither centrally nor peripherally administered FGF21 initiated browning in mice lacking \u03b2-adrenoceptors, demonstrating that an intact adrenergic system is necessary for FGF21 action. These data indicate that FGF21 can signal in the brain to activate the sympathetic nervous system and induce adipose tissue thermogenesis.",

The objective of the present study was to characterize a silicone pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) episcleral implant system for transscleral drug delivery. Silicone PSA implants for dexamethasone, atenolol, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were prepared at different polymer-to-drug mass ratios. Implant adhesion to human cadaver sclera was measured. Drug release experiments were conducted in well-stirred containers in vitro. The results were then analyzed using a pharmacokinetic model and in vitro-in vivo data comparison from previous studies. The silicone PSA episcleral implants in the present study had an average diameter of 3.5\u2009mm and a thickness of 0.8\u2009mm. Drug release from the silicone PSA implants was influenced by drug solubility, implant polymer content, and implant coating. Drug release from the implants was observed to follow the receding boundary release mechanism and was solubility dependent with the higher water solubility drug showing higher release rate than the low-solubility drug. Increasing polymer content in the implants led to a significant decrease in the drug release rate. Coated implants reduced the initial burst effect and provided lower release rates than the uncoated implants. These implants provided sustained drug release that could last up to several months in vitro and demonstrated the potential to offer drug delivery for chronic ocular diseases via the transscleral route.",

In this FESI-sweeping method, the use of a sample of high acidity and low conductivity (pH* = 2.5, 4.0 \u03bcS cm(-1)) allowed for a large amount of analyte injection. Then, the concentration of the analytes was carried out by sweeping based on the interaction of an acid-labile anionic selector, di-n-butyl L-tartrate-boric acid complex acid, and cationic analytes. Simultaneously, the concentrated analytes were released and focused at the boundary of the acid sample solution and separation buffer due to the decomposition of the selector in the acid sample solution. Under the optimum conditions, a 21,000-fold sensitivity enhancement upon normal capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) was achieved for PL enantiomers. The detection limits of R-propranolol and S-propranolol were 0.26 ng mL(-1) and 0.31 ng mL(-1), respectively.
