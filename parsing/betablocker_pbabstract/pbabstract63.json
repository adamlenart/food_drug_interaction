    "2": "GAD significantly increased atrial dynamics such as stroke volume, pulse pressure and augmented cAMP efflux in beating rabbit atria. The inotropic effect was significantly attenuated by pre-treatment with KB-R7943, a reverse mode Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger blocker. The GAD-induced increase in atrial dynamics was also markedly inhibited by staurosporine, a non-selective protein kinase inhibitor, and partly blocked by KT5720, a selective PKA inhibitor. The effect of GAD on atrial dynamics was not altered by pre-treatment with propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor inhibitor, or diltiazem, an L-type Ca(2+)channel blocker. The phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) failed to modulate the GAD-induced increase in atrial dynamics, but markedly attenuated cAMP efflux in the beating atria.",

    "4": "Grey scale median (GSM) measured on ultrasound images of carotid plaques has been used for several years now in research to find the vulnerable plaque. Centres have used different software and also different methods for GSM measurement. This has resulted in a wide range of GSM values and cut-off values for the detection of the vulnerable plaque. The aim of this study was to compare the values obtained with two different softwares, using different standardization methods, for the measurement of GSM on ultrasound images of carotid human plaques. GSM was measured with Adobe Photoshop(\u00ae) and with Artery Measurement System (AMS) on duplex ultrasound images of 100 consecutive medium- to large-sized carotid plaques of the Beta-blocker Cholesterol-lowering Asymptomatic Plaque Study (BCAPS). The mean values of GSM were 35\u00b72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019\u00b73 and 55\u00b78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022\u00b75 for Adobe Photoshop(\u00ae) and AMS, respectively. Mean difference was 20\u00b745 (95% CI: 19\u00b717-21\u00b773). Although the absolute values of GSM differed, the agreement between the two measurements was good, correlation coefficient 0\u00b795. A chi-square test revealed a kappa value of 0\u00b768 when studying quartiles of GSM. The intra-observer variability was 1\u00b79% for AMS and 2\u00b75% for Adobe Photoshop. The difference between softwares and standardization methods must be taken into consideration when comparing studies. To avoid these problems, researcher should come to a consensus regarding software and standardization method for GSM measurement on ultrasound images of plaque in the arteries.", 
    "5": "Despite their high incidence, most infantile haemangiomas (IH) do not require treatment as they regress spontaneously and most do not leave significant sequelae. For the subset of haemangiomas that require treatment, indications for intervention can be divided into three main categories: ulceration, disfigurement and impairment of function or vital structures. In addition, certain IH have a risk of associated structural anomalies. Given the wide heterogeneity of haemangiomas, deciding which haemangiomas need intervention and when to intervene requires a detailed knowledge of natural history and clinical indicators of increased risk.",

    "8": "We performed a systematic review of published, English-language original studies of pharmacologic treatments for prevention of episodic or chronic migraine. Studies that compared drugs with inactive controls, nonpharmacologic interventions, or other drugs were eligible. Outcomes evaluated included rates of complete migraine cessation, \u226550 percent reduction in monthly migraine frequency, reduction in migraine-related disability, and improvement in quality of life. We calculated absolute risk differences, pooled them with random-effects models and with Bayesian network meta-analysis, and calculated numbers of outcome events attributable to treatments per 1,000 participants treated.", 
    "9": "Of 5,244 retrieved references, 245 publications of randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and 76 publications of nonrandomized therapeutic studies met eligibility criteria. Most enrollees were middle-aged Caucasian women, with an average of five monthly migraine attacks. Few trials reported the proportion of obese subjects, but many subjects were overweight. More than half of the RCTs defined migraine according to the International Headache Society criteria. Studies excluded adults with severe medical or psychiatric illnesses or contraindications to examined drugs. Strength of evidence was mostly low due to risk of bias and imprecision in individual RCTs and pooled estimates. For chronic migraine, botulinum toxin formulations were examined in 20 RCTs of 4,237 adults. Onabotulinumtoxin A was more effective than placebo in reducing monthly chronic migraine attacks by \u226550 percent (low-strength evidence from 3 RCTs of 459 adults) with inconsistent improvement in quality of life. Pooled analyses demonstrated that per 1,000 treated adults, 170 (95% confidence interval [CI], 82 to 258) would experience \u226550 percent reduction in migraine frequency, 155 (95% CI, 90 to 220) would experience adverse effects, and 26 (95% CI, 10 to 43) would discontinue treatments due to bothersome adverse effects. Topiramate reduced disability in patients with chronic migraine but failed to decrease monthly migraine frequency by \u226550 percent (low-strength evidence from one RCT of 328 adults). Individual RCTs examined the comparative effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxin A with topiramate or divalproex and found no differences in chronic migraine prevention. Propranolol combined with topiramate treatment demonstrated no benefits in nonresponders to topiramate monotherapy (low-strength evidence from one RCT of 191 adults). For episodic migraine, RCTs examined 59 drugs from 14 drug classes. All approved drugs (topiramate, divalproex, timolol, and propranolol), some off-label beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and the angiotensin II receptor antagonist candesartan were better than placebo in reducing episodic monthly migraine frequency by \u226550 percent. Drugs would result in clinical improvement in 200 to 400 patients per 1,000 treated. Adverse effects leading to treatment discontinuation were examined in 68 RCTs. Topiramate, off-label antiepileptics, and antidepressants resulted in bothersome adverse effects leading to treatment discontinuation more often than placebo. Limited direct evidence of comparative effectiveness from head-to-head RCTs demonstrated no consistent significant differences in outcomes with examined drugs in patients with episodic migraine. Exploratory indirect adjusted frequentist analysis offered low-strength evidence that the angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan was more effective than approved drugs including topiramate, propranolol, timolol, and divalproex. Exploratory network Bayesian meta-analysis offered low-strength evidence that angiotensin inhibiting drugs (captopril, lisinopril, candesartan) were the most effective and tolerable for episodic migraine prevention in adults who have no contraindications to examined drugs. Individual RCTs of drug-management interventions for episodic migraine offered low-strength evidence that compared with usual care, multidisciplinary team care improved quality of life and reduced migraine-related disability; a headache management program resulted in complete cessation of migraine; a minimal-contact cognitive-behavioral program improved patient satisfaction with treatments; headache school decreased overuse of drugs for acute headache attacks and reduced migraine disability; pharmaceutical care improved self-efficacy; and an intensive pharmaceutical care campaign had no statistically significant impact on use of acute drugs.", 
    "10": "For chronic migraine, onabotulinumtoxin A reduced migraine attacks but increased the risk of adverse effects and treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects. For episodic migraine, approved drugs are effective but increase risk of adverse effects and treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects. Some off-label beta blockers and angiotensin inhibiting drugs are effective without bothersome harms and therefore offer the best benefits-to-harms ratio. We could not determine the long-term (i.e., trials of more than 3 months\u2019 duration), preventive benefits and adherence with drugs. Evidence on improving quality of life was inconsistent across individual drugs. Evidence for individualized treatment decisions is very limited. Future research should examine the role of patient characteristics on drug benefits and safety.", 
    "11": "A comparative study of the electrochemical conversion and the biotransformation performed by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) obtained by rat liver microsomes has been achieved to elucidate the oxidation mechanism of both acebutolol and alprenolol. For this purpose, a wide range of reactions such as N-dealkylation, O-dealkoxylation, aromatic hydroxylation, benzyl hydroxylation, alkyl hydroxylation, and aromatic hydroxylation have been examined in this study, and their mechanisms have been compared. Most of the results of the electrochemical oxidation have been found to be in accordance with those obtained by incubating acebutolol and alprenolol in the presence of CYP450, i.e., N-dealkylation, benzyl hydroxylation, and O-dealkoxylation reactions catalyzed by liver microsomes were found to be predicted by the electrochemical oxidation. The difficulty for the electrochemical process to mimic both aromatic and alkyl hydroxylation reactions has also been discussed, and the hypothesis for the absence of aromatic hydroxylated and alkyl hydroxylated products, respectively, for alprenolol and acebutolol, under the anodic oxidation has been supported by theoretical calculation. The present study highlights the potential and limitation of coupling of electrochemistry-liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry for the study of phase I and phase II reactions of acebutolol and alprenolol.", 
    "12": "The acquisition and expression of conditioned fear depends on prefrontal-amygdala circuits. Auditory fear conditioning increases the tone responses of lateral amygdala neurons, but the increase is transient, lasting only a few hundred milliseconds after tone onset. It was recently reported that that the prelimbic (PL) prefrontal cortex transforms transient lateral amygdala input into a sustained PL output, which could drive fear responses via projections to the lateral division of basal amygdala (BL). To explore the possible mechanisms involved in this transformation, we developed a large-scale biophysical model of the BL-PL network, consisting of 850 conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley-type cells, calcium-based learning, and neuromodulator effects. The model predicts that sustained firing in PL can be derived from BL-induced release of dopamine and norepinephrine that is maintained by PL-BL interconnections. These predictions were confirmed with physiological recordings from PL neurons during fear conditioning with the selective \u03b2-blocker propranolol and by inactivation of BL with muscimol. Our model suggests that PL has a higher bandwidth than BL, due to PL's decreased internal inhibition and lower spiking thresholds. It also suggests that variations in specific microcircuits in the PL-BL interconnection can have a significant impact on the expression of fear, possibly explaining individual variability in fear responses. The human homolog of PL could thus be an effective target for anxiety disorders.",

The effect of concentration of Compritol 888 ATO (COMP) and Poloxamer 188 (P-188) on the particle size of blank SLNs was studied using the design of experiments. Further narrow concentration range of COMP and P-188 was selected and carvedilol-loaded SLNs were prepared to obtain an optimized formulation which was lyophilized (L-SLNs), transformed into enteric compression-coated tablet and evaluated for drug release, X-ray diffraction and cellular uptake mechanism. COMP was chosen as lipid due to its least value of \u0394\u03b4 with carvedilol. The optimized formulation (7.5% COMP, 5.0% P-188 and 1.11% carvedilol) had 161\u2009nm particle size and 94.8% entrapment efficiency. The enteric-coated carvedilol-loaded SLNs tablet protected carvedilol from acidic environment and similar prolonged release profiles were obtained from L-SLNs, core tablet and enteric-coated tablet. Absence of crystalline carvedilol XRD peak indicated the presence of amorphous carvedilol in SLNs. Higher carvedilol uptake from SLNs compared to drug solution in the Caco-2 cell line exhibited a potential prolonged drug release. Moreover, upon cellular uptake, SLNs could then enter the lymphatic system which will avoid first pass metabolism and hence higher oral bioavailability.",

The goal of this report was to analyze independent influence of DST transitions on the incidence of AMI with simultaneous control for the confounding presence of situational triggers such as physical exertion, emotional stress, heavy meals, and sexual intercourse, as well as for other clinical factors. Detailed information was obtained from 2412 patients and included baseline characteristics, working status, exact time of AMI, possible external triggers, cardiovascular risk factors, and prehospital medication. AMI incidence on days after the DST was compared with incidence during control periods and patient characteristics, cardiovascular medication, and circumstances of AMI were evaluated to identify potential risk modifiers. Relative risks of AMI and differences in patient characteristics were expressed through incidence ratios and odds ratios, respectively, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate analysis was performed by using a stepwise multiple regression to assess the independent predictive significance of the characteristics of patients for the AMI occurring in the posttransitional period. The incidence ratio for AMI for the first four workdays after the spring DST transition was 1.29 (95% CI: 1.09-1.49) and the excess was particularly prominent on Monday. In autumn, the incidence ratio for AMI for this 4-d period was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.19-1.69), with peaks on Tuesday and Thursday. The independent predictors for AMI during this period in spring were male sex (p = 0.03) and nonengagement in physical activity (p = 0.02) and there was a trend for the lower risk of incident among those taking calcium antagonists (p = 0.07). In autumn, the predictors were female sex (p = 0.04), current employment (p = 0.006), not taking \u03b2-blocker (p = 0.03), and nonengagement in physical activity (p = 0.02). The present report supports the possibility that DST transitions represent additional chronobiological feature of AMI, and that risk of an onset varies according to sex, employment status, and the taking of cardiovascular medication.",

    "50": "Our retrospective multicentre study collected data from 7660 cardioversions of acute (<48 h) AF in 3143 consecutive patients. Immediate arrhythmic complications were evaluated after 6906 (90.2%) electrical cardioversions performed in 2868 patients. We also assessed the predictors of arrhythmic complications and whether post-cardioversion bradycardia or asystole led to later a permanent pacemaker implantation. Altogether, 63 (0.9%) electrical cardioversions resulted in bradyarrhythmia in 54 patients. Asystole (>5 s) occurred immediately after 51 cardioversions leading to a short resuscitation in seven cases and two patients needed extrinsic pacing after the cardioversion. In nine cases, asystole was followed by bradycardia. Bradycardic ventricular rate (<40 b.p.m.) alone was seen after 12 procedures. No ventricular arrhythmias needing intervention were detected. Old age [odds ratio (OR) 1.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.10, P < 0.0001], female sex (OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.4-4.8, P = 0.004), and unsuccessful cardioversion (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.6, P = 0.03) were the independent predictors of bradycardic complications. Slow ventricular rate, use of digoxin, beta blocker, or antiarrhythmic medication did not increase the risk of bradycardic complications. Pacemaker was implanted in 24 (44.4%) patients after a median delay of 66 days.",

    "52": "The objective of this study was to establish a novel prediction system of drug absorption in humans by utilizing human intestinal tissues. Based on the transport index (TI), a newly defined parameter, calculated by taking account of the change in drug concentrations because of precipitation on the apical side and the amounts accumulated in the tissue and transported to the basal side, the absorbability of drugs in rank order as well as the fraction of dose absorbed (Fa) in humans were estimated. Human intestinal tissues taken from ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease patients were mounted in a mini-Ussing chamber and transport studies were performed to evaluate the permeation of drugs, including FD-4, a very low permeable marker, atenolol, a low permeable marker, and metoprolol, a high permeable marker. Although apparent permeability coefficients calculated by the conventional equation did not reflect human Fa values for FD-4, atenolol, and metoprolol, TI values were well correlated with Fa values, which are described by 100 \u00b7 [1 - e (- f \u00b7 (TI - \u03b1)) ]. Based on this equation, Fa values in humans for other test drugs were predicted successfully, indicating that our new system utilizing human intestinal tissues would be valuable for predicting oral drug absorption in humans.",

After the 6 months of carvedilol therapy the clinical score significantly improved, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (LVFS) significantly increased, and left ventricle end-diastolic dimensions and end-systolic dimensions significantly decreased. There were statistically significant increases in mean SDNN, SDANN, rMSSD, and pNN50 (p = 0.002, p = 0.001, p = 0.008, and p = 0.026, respectively). After the carvedilol therapy, SDNN was correlated with the clinical score, heart rate, LVEF, LVFS, and total premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).

Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are synthetic receptors having potential applications in drug delivery systems and devices such as diagnostic sensors. In the present work, ab initio quantum mechanical simulations and computational screening were used to identify functional monomer having best interactions with PDL. A virtual library of 16 functional monomers was built and the possible minimum energy conformation of the monomers and PDL were calculated using Hartree-Fock (HF) method for the synthesis of PDL imprinted polymer. The interaction energy between functional monomer and the template were corrected by means of basis set superposition error (BSSE) in all pre-polymerization complexes. The hydrogen bonding between PDL and functional monomer was evaluated by changes in bond lengths before and after complex formation. The virtual template-monomer complex with highest interaction energy is more stable during the polymerization and leads to high selectivity and specificity toward the template. The interaction energy of PDL was found to be the highest with itaconic acid followed by 4-vinyl pyridine and least with acrylonitrile. Taking a spectroscopic viewpoint, results obtained from analysis of the harmonic infrared spectrum were examined. Red and blue shifts related to the stretching frequencies of either donors or acceptors of protons were identified and compared experimentally. Stoichiometric mole ratio of template to functional monomer was optimized and confirmed by UV visible spectra titrations. The theoretical results were correlated by evaluation of binding parameters of MIPs. The experimental binding results were in good agreement with theoretical computations.", 
    "66": "Aqueous solutions of four pharmaceutical compounds, belonging to the group of emergent contaminants of water: atenolol (ATL), hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), ofloxacin (OFX) and trimethoprim (TMP), have been treated with different oxidation systems, mainly, photocatalytic oxidation, ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation. TiO2 has been used as semiconductor for photocatalytic reactions both in the presence of air, oxygen or ozone-oxygen gas mixtures. Black light lamps mainly emitting at 365\u00a0nm were the source of radiation. In all cases, the influence of some variables (concentrations of semiconductor, ozone gas and pharmaceuticals and pH) on the removal of pharmaceuticals, total polyphenol content (TPC) and total organic carbon (TOC) was investigated. A discussion on the possible routes of pharmaceutical and intermediates (as TPC and TOC) elimination has been developed. Thus, OFX TiO2/UVA degradation mechanism seems to develop through the participation of non-hydroxyl free radical species. Furthermore, the presence of OFX inhibits the formation of hydroxyl radicals in the photocatalytic process. The most effective processes were those involving ozone that lead to complete disappearance of parent compounds in less than 30\u00a0min for initial pharmaceutical concentrations lower than 2.5\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1). In the ozonation systems, regardless of the pH and the presence of TiO2, pharmaceuticals are degraded through their direct reaction with ozone. Photocatalytic ozonation was the most efficient process for TPC and TOC removals (\u2265 80% and \u226560% elimination after 2\u00a0h of treatment, respectively) as well as in terms of the ozone consumption efficiency (1, 5.5 and 4\u00a0mol of ozone consumed per mol of TOC mineralized, at pH 4, 7 and 9, respectively). Weakly acid conditions (pH 4) resulted to be the most convenient ones for TPC and TOC removal by photocatalytic ozonation. This was likely due to formation of hydroxyl radicals through the ozonide generated at these conditions.", 
    "67": "The extract of ginger, the rhizomes of Zingiber officinale Roscoe (Zingiberaceae), has been reported to possess anti-hyperactivity and anti-inflammation on airway. The present study described brochodilatory activity of ginger oil and identified its active compound. Ginger oil was extracted by hydro-distillation. The compositions of ginger oil were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometer. Citral, eucalyptol and camphene were found to be the major components. Ginger oil and citral, but not camphene, suppressed rat tracheal contraction induced by carbachol (CCh). Consistent with previous report, eucalyptol showed a relaxing effect on rat airway. Since the content of eucalyptol in ginger oil was relatively low, the contribution of eucalyptol to the bronchodilatory effect of ginger oil was small. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the myorelaxing effect, propranolol (a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist), indomethacin (a COX inhibitor) and L-NAME (a NOS inhibitor) were used to block the inhibitory effects of ginger oil and citral. It was found that propranolol, but not indomethacin and L-NAME, reversed bronchodilatory effects of both ginger oil and citral, suggesting that a possible mechanism involved \u03b2-adrenergic receptor. This study provides the pharmacological basis supporting the therapeutic potential of Z. officinale rhizomes as a bronchodilator.",

Here, we report highly efficient differentiation of hiPSCs toward a relatively homogeneous population of functional hepatocytes. hiPSC-derived hepatocytes (hiHs) not only showed a high expression of hepatocyte-specific proteins and liver-specific functions, but they also developed a functional biotransformation system including phase I and II metabolizing enzymes and phase III transporters. Nuclear receptors, which are critical for regulating the expression of metabolizing enzymes, were also expressed in hiHs. hiHs also responded to different compounds/inducers of cytochrome P450 as mature hepatocytes do. To follow up on this observation, we analyzed the drug metabolizing capacity of hiHs in real time using a novel ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We found that, like freshly isolated primary human hepatocytes, the seven major metabolic pathways of the drug bufuralol were found in hiHs. In addition, transplanted hiHs engrafted, integrated, and proliferated in livers of an immune-deficient mouse model, and secreted human albumin, indicating that hiHs also function in vivo. In conclusion, we have generated a method for the efficient generation of hepatocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells in vitro and in vivo, and it appears that the cells function similarly to primary human hepatocytes, including developing a complete metabolic function. These results represent a significant step toward using patient/disease-specific hepatocytes for cell-based therapeutics as well as for pharmacology and toxicology studies.",

In this study, we identified the most optimal artificial neural networks using conformation-independent chirality codes to predict CYP2C19 catalytic parameters for enantioselective reactions. Optimization of the neural networks required identifying the most suitable representation of structure among a diverse array of training substrates, normalizing distribution of the corresponding catalytic parameters (k(cat), K(m), and k(cat)/K(m)), and determining the best topology for networks to make predictions. Among different structural descriptors, the use of partial atomic charges according to the CHelpG scheme and inclusion of hydrogens yielded the most optimal artificial neural networks. Their training also required resolution of poorly distributed output catalytic parameters using a Box-Cox transformation. End point leave-one-out cross correlations of the best neural networks revealed that predictions for individual catalytic parameters (k(cat) and K(m)) were more consistent with experimental values than those for catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)). Lastly, neural networks predicted correctly enantioselectivity and comparable catalytic parameters measured in this study for previously uncharacterized CYP2C19 substrates, R- and S-propranolol. Taken together, these seminal computational studies for CYP2C19 are the first to predict all catalytic parameters for enantioselective reactions using artificial neural networks and thus provide a foundation for expanding the prediction of cytochrome P450 reactions to chiral drugs, pollutants, and other biologically active compounds.",

To assess the key processes affecting the environmental fate of the compounds, we linked the uncertainty estimates of the reaction rate coefficients to the relative influence of transformation and sorption that occurred in different stream environments. The hydrological and biogeochemical contributions to the fate of the pharmaceuticals were decoupled, and the results indicate a moderate hydrological retention in the hyporheic zone as well as in the densely vegetated parts of the stream. Biogeochemical reactions in these transient storage zones further affected the fate of the pharmaceuticals, and we found that sorption was the key process for bezafibrate, metoprolol, and naproxen, while primary transformation was the most important process for clofibric acid and ibuprofen.

Effects of ivabradine in patients with stable angina receiving beta-blockers according to baseline heart rate: an analysis of the ASSOCIATE study. Int. J. Cardiol. pii:S0167-5273(12)01385-X (2012). Chronic stable angina pectoris is the most common manifestation of coronary artery disease. A large body of evidence points to high resting heart rate (HR) as a risk factor for mortality in various populations, including patients with cardiovascular disease. Elevated HR is an important pathophysiological variable that increases myocardial oxygen demand and also limits tissue perfusion by reducing the duration of diastole, during which most myocardial perfusion occurs. Large epidemiological trials have established that elevated resting HR is a prognostic factor for cardiovascular events and mortality in healthy individuals and in patients with myocardial infarction, stable coronary artery disease and heart failure. The classical treatments for HR reduction show such negative aspects. \u03b2-blocker therapy exerts negative effects on regional myocardial blood flow and function when HR reduction is eliminated by atrial pacing. Calcium channel antagonists functionally antagonize coronary vasoconstriction mediated through \u03b1-adrenoreceptors and are thus devoid of this undesired effect, but the compounds are nevertheless negative inotrope. Ivabradine (IVA), a pure HR-lowering drug, reduces the myocardial oxygen demand of exercise and contributes to the restoration of oxygen balance, which has demonstrated a benefit in chronic cardiovascular disease. No relevant negative effects are evidenced on cardiac conduction, contractility, relaxation or repolarization, or blood pressure. In this post-hoc analysis, the authors show that IVA treatment, compared with the placebo group, had no significant impact on systolic or diastolic blood pressure at rest or during exercise and reduces HR in all stages of physical exercise and during the treatment period. These benefits are independent of baseline HR, both at rest and during physical exercise, confirming that HR reduction with IVA is beneficial in all patients, even with \u03b2-blocker therapy, if their resting HR is above 60 bpm.",

    "146": "The affinity of a drug to a biological membrane can affect the distribution and the availability of the active compound to its target. Adsorption is usually determined with in vitro distribution studies based on partitioning of the drug between buffer and tissue, which have limitations such as the high variability of the uptake data and the need for high accuracy in the measurement of drug concentration. Furthermore, distribution studies yield solute concentrations in the bulk of the tissue, whereas electrokinetic phenomena such as streaming potential and electroosmosis reflect the electric charge density on a membrane surface. Streaming potential thus can be used in studying the conditions, by which the charge sign and density can be regulated. That, in turn, has significance to electroosmotic transport mechanism during iontophoresis. In this communication, the adsorption of model compounds methylprednisolone sodium succinate, propranolol, and cytochrome C on bovine and porcine sclera is determined as a function of their concentration by measuring streaming potential. Both membranes had negative streaming potential, proving that they carry negative charge, but had different values at negative and positive pressure differences, which is addressed to the structural asymmetry of these membranes. Bovine sclera had a clearly higher value of streaming potential, ca. -26 nV/Pa, than porcine sclera, ca. -7 nV/Pa (10 mM NaCl solution). All the model compounds were adsorbed on bovine and porcine sclera already in the millimolar concentration range and can have an impact to electroosmosis during transscleral iontophoresis.

The mean beta-blockers dosage was 68.9% of the target dose. The two-year mortality rate was 13%, while the mean age of the population was 57.1 years. In addition, most of the patients were men (85.5% vs. 14.5%). The resting LVEF was 35.7 \u00b1 9.4 and the maximal oxygen uptake (peak VO\u2082) was 19.5 ml/kg/min. The peak VO\u2082, VE/VCO\u2082 slope and circulatory power were significant predictors of risk. The prognosis was better when the initial linear VE/VCO\u2082 slope was lower than 30, and the final steeper VE/VCO\u2082 slope was lower than 32. There was no difference between the two slopes. The oxygen uptake efficiency slope, oxygen uptake, heart rate recovery, VE/VCO\u2082/VO\u2082 index and ventilatory threshold had no prognostic value.",

    "157": "Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has matured to one of the major liquid phase enantiodifferentiation techniques since the first report in 1985. This can be primarily attributed to the flexibility as well as the various modes available including electrokinetic chromatography (EKC), micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC), and microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography (MEEKC). In contrast to chromatographic techniques, the chiral selector is mobile in the background electrolyte. Furthermore, a large variety of chiral selectors are available that can be easily combined in the same separation system. In addition, the migration order of the enantiomers can be adjusted by a number of approaches. In CE enantiodifferentiations the separation principle is comparable to chromatography while the principle of the movement of the analytes in the capillary is based on electrophoretic phenomena. The present chapter will focus on mechanistic aspects of CE enantioseparations including enantiomer migration order and the current understanding of selector-selectand structures. Selected examples of the basic enantioseparation modes EKC, MEKC, and MEEKC will be discussed.", 
    "158": "Metoprolol, a commonly prescribed \u03b2-blocker, is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), an enzyme with substantial genetic heterogeneity. Several smaller studies have shown that metoprolol pharmacokinetics is influenced by CYP2D6 genotype and metabolizer phenotype. To increase robustness of metoprolol pharmacokinetic estimates, a systematic review and meta-analysis of pharmacokinetic studies that administered a single oral dose of immediate-release metoprolol were performed. Pooled analysis (n = 264) demonstrated differences in peak plasma metoprolol concentration, area under the concentration-time curve, elimination half-life, and apparent oral clearance that were 2.3-, 4.9-, 2.3-, and 5.9-fold between extensive and poor metabolizers, respectively, and 5.3-, 13-, 2.6-, and 15-fold between ultrarapid and poor metabolizers (all P < 0.001), respectively. Enantiomer-specific analysis revealed genotype-dependent enantio-selective metabolism, with nearly 40% greater R- than S-metoprolol metabolism in ultrarapid and extensive metabolizers. This study demonstrates a marked effect of CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype on metoprolol pharmacokinetics and confirms enantiomer-specific metabolism of metoprolol.", 
    "159": "Previous research demonstrated that rotenone (RT) induces neuronal injury partially by increasing intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)]i), and inducing oxidative stress, leading to a neurodegenerative disorder. However, the mechanism of RT-induced injury remains elusive. Recent work revealed that Ca(2+) signaling is important for RT-induced senescence in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In the present study, we found that in SH-SY5Y cells, RT increased [Ca(2+)]i, senescence associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity, aggregation of lipofuscin, production of reactive oxygen species, G1/G0 cell cycle arrest, and activation of p53/p21 signaling proteins. In addition, RT decreased the expression of the signaling proteins for cell proliferation and survival, Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclin D1, and Akt. Pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with isradipine, an L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, or EGTA antagonized these effects of RT. These results suggested that application of isradipine might be a novel approach to prevent RT-induced neurodegenerative disorder such as Parkinson's disease.",

In this paper, a novel series of 4-(1-oxo-2-cyclopentenyl)-1,4-benzothiazine derivatives modified at the C-2, and C-6 positions were synthesized as openers of vascular KATP channels. Most of the tested compounds evoked vasorelaxing effects on rat aortic rings and membrane hyperpolarization in human vascular smooth muscle cells, with potency similar or superior to that of the reference levcromakalim (LCRK). The selective KATP blocker glibenclamide antagonized the above vascular effects, confirming that KATP channels are closely involved in the mechanism of action. The experimental results confirmed the 1,4-benzothiazine nucleus as an optimal scaffold for activators of vascular KATP channels; moreover, the high level of potency exhibited by the 6-acetyl substituted benzothiazine 8, along with the lack of any significant interference with insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells, paves the way to further develop a new series of potent activators of vascular KATP channels.",

The study was aimed to improvement the treatment outcomes in OAB women with imperative incontinence and obstructive urination disorders by using a combination of alpha1-adrenoblockers and PDE-5 inhibitors, and to evaluation of relationship between clinical and urodynamic manifestations of the disease. The state of the microcirculation of the bladder mucosa before and after treatment was also evaluated. We have examined and treated 40 women aged 17 to 69 years with disease duration ranged from 1 to 20 years. Patients received combination of al-adrenoblocker alfuzosin (dalfaz) 5 mg at night and reversible selective PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil (Cialis) 5 mg daily in the morning for a month. After treatment, according to the uroflowmetry and cystometry data, the time of urination was reduced, urinary volume and maximum urinary flow rate, as well as cystometric capacity have increased; involuntary detrusor contractions in the bladder filling phase (spontaneous or provoked) became less, or absent. According to the results of ultrasound examination, residual urine volume has decreased. Laser Doppler flowmetry showed an increase of neurogenic tone in precapillary, bypass coefficient and microcirculation effectiveness index, increase in microcirculation index and the coefficient of variation, indicating an improvement of microcirculation in the bladder mucosa. As a result of treatment, the clinical effect was seen in 29 (73%) patients, urinary incontinence was noted only in 6 (15%) patients.", 
    "171": "The risk presented by \u03b2-blockers on aquatic organisms remains uncertain, particularly given the enantiospecific differences in toxicity of chiral \u03b2-blockers. In this study, the toxicity of two \u03b2-blockers, propranolol and metoprolol, was determined. The 96-h LC50 of propranolol in the zebrafish larvae was 2.48 mg/L, whereas 50 mg/L metoprolol did not result in death. Both \u03b2-blockers decreased the heart rate and hatching rate and increased the mortality of the zebrafish embryos. Among these indicators, the heart rate was the most sensitive. However, the acute larval and embryo toxicity results displayed no enantioselectivity. Additionally, the transcriptional response of the genes encoding the \u03b2-adrenergic receptors and those involved in other physiological processes, including the antioxidant response, detoxification, and apoptosis, in zebrafish larvae exposed to the \u03b2-blockers was examined. Although the changes in gene transcription were fairly minor, significant enantioselectivity was observed for \u03b2-blockers, suggesting that the transcriptional response was more sensitive for the evaluation of enantiospecific toxicity. Based on these results, the pharmaceutical drugs were not expected to pose a risk to fish; however, this conclusion should not be considered final. These results also demonstrated that the enantiospecific toxicity of chiral \u03b2-blockers should be investigated when performing an ecological risk assessment.",

An enantioselective RP-HPLC method was applied to determine the accumulation of propranolol (PPL) stereoisomers in K562 and K562/ADR cells. The concentration, time and temperature dependent studies showed that the accumulation of S-(-)-PPL was higher than R-(+)-PPL in K562 cells and uptake of R-(+)-PPL was significantly higher than that of S-(-)-PPL in K562/ADR cells.

    "173": "Propranolol (PRO), a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) antagonist, has two enantiomers, R(+)-PRO and S(-)-PRO, which have diverse biological effects. For example, S(-)-PRO blocks the \u03b2-receptor ~100 times more strongly than R(+)-PRO. However, the signaling pathway that causes this difference remains unclear. This pathway may affect the expression of numerous proteins, some of which play key roles during the drug action process. Therefore, we treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with R(+)-PRO and S(-)-PRO in order to identify differentially expressed proteins and to determine their functions in the drug action process. Of the 22\u00a0differentially expressed protein spots investigated, 14\u00a0demonstrated higher expression levels in the R(+)-PRO-treated cells, while 8\u00a0demonstrated lower expression levels in the same cells. Mass spectrometry identified 10\u00a0of the differentially expressed proteins: 4\u00a0signaling molecules, 2\u00a0metabolic enzymes, 3\u00a0heat shock proteins and 1\u00a0cytoskeleton protein. Our results suggest that these differentially expressed proteins, particularly guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit \u03b2-2-like 1\u00a0(GBLP), are the key biomacromolecules underlying the mechanism by which PRO enantiomers induce stereoselective cellular responses. The results aid in clarifying the role of PRO in the treatment of arrhythmia and angina.",

The investigated TiO2 was Millennium PC-500 immobilized on ceramic plates by sol-gel based method. The partial least squares modeling was successfully applied for the multivariate calibration of the spectrophotometric data. The central composite design was applied to model and optimize the UV/TiO2 process. Predicted values of removal efficiency were found to be in good agreement with experimental values for MET, ATL and CPR (R(2)=0.947 and Adj-R(2)=0.906, R(2)=0.977 and Adj-R(2)=0.960 and R(2)=0.982 and Adj-R(2)=0.969, respectively). The optimum initial concentration of pharmaceuticals, reaction time and UV light intensity was found to be 10 mg L(-1), 150 min and 38.45 W m(-2), respectively. The main degradation intermediates of pharmaceuticals produced in this process were identified by GC-MS technique. The chronic ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals was evaluated using aquatic species Spirodela polyrrhiza prior to and after photocatalysis.

Besides NaHA subjected to hyalurodinase depolimerization (NaHA(d)) was also used. Transparent dispersions were obtained. They exhibited negative electrokinetic potential and a high degree of counterionic condensation with affinity constants (log Kcc) in the range of 5.8-6.1 for propranolol complexes (pK(a) 9.45) and 4.0-4.6 for lidocaine ones (pK(a) 7.92). Delivery rates of D from the complexes were measured in a Franz-type bicompartimental device. Loaded D were slowly released from the three types of complexes, even when a neutral salt was added to the dispersion placed in the donor compartment, revealing the high affinity between the protonated drugs and the ionisable groups of the polymer. Complex dispersions based on HA or on NaHA(d) exhibited lower viscosity than those of NaHA but their complexing ability remained unaltered. The results reported on equilibrium and release properties of Hyaluronan-model D complexes contribute to expand the use of HA and NaHA as drug carriers for different routes of administration.",

    "185": "The use of \u03b2-blockers is mandatory for counteracting heart failure (HF)-induced chronic sympathetic hyperactivity, cardiac dysfunction and remodeling. Importantly, aerobic exercise training, an efficient nonpharmacological therapy to HF, also counteracts sympathetic hyperactivity in HF and improves exercise tolerance and cardiac contractility; the latter associated with changes in cardiac Ca(2+) handling. This study was undertaken to test whether combined \u03b2-blocker and aerobic exercise training would integrate the beneficial effects of isolated therapies on cardiac structure, contractility and cardiomyocyte Ca(2+) handling in a genetic model of sympathetic hyperactivity-induced HF (\u03b12A/\u03b12C- adrenergic receptor knockout mice, KO). We used a cohort of 5-7 mo male wild-type (WT) and congenic mice (KO) with C57Bl6/J genetic background randomly assigned into 5 groups: control (WT), saline-treated KO (KOS), exercise trained KO (KOT), carvedilol-treated KO (KOC) and, combined carvedilol-treated and exercise-trained KO (KOCT). Isolated and combined therapies reduced mortality compared with KOS mice. Both KOT and KOCT groups had increased exercise tolerance, while groups receiving carvedilol had increased left ventricular fractional shortening and reduced cardiac collagen volume fraction compared with KOS group. Cellular data confirmed that cardiomyocytes from KOS mice displayed abnormal Ca(2+) handling. KOT group had increased intracellular peak of Ca(2+) transient and reduced diastolic Ca(2+) decay compared with KOS group, while KOC had increased Ca(2+) decay compared with KOS group. Notably, combined therapies re-established cardiomyocyte Ca(2+) transient paralleled by increased SERCA2 expression and SERCA2:PLN ratio toward WT levels. Aerobic exercise trained increased the phosphorylation of PLN at Ser(16) and Thr(17) residues in both KOT and KOCT groups, but carvedilol treatment reduced lipid peroxidation in KOC and KOCT groups compared with KOS group. The present findings provide evidence that the combination of carvedilol and aerobic exercise training therapies lead to a better integrative outcome than carvedilol or exercise training used in isolation.",

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and medical treatment of hypertension among 1,301\u00a0ACS patients enrolled into the Chinese registry of acute coronary events (CRACE) trial. Analyses were performed by gender, with both genders combined and according to international practice. Multivariable models identified factors associated with use of different classes of antihypertensive medication, and examined the correlation between hypertension and gender with mortality. The use of angiotensin\u2011converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), \u03b2-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics increased in both genders during management of presenting ACS. Hypertensive men were more likely to have been receiving \u03b2-blockers when they were discharged (77.2%) than women (69.2%). Hypertensive women were more likely to have received diuretics when they were discharged (28.4%) than men (22%). ACEI use increased by ~60% (absolute increase) in both women and men as a result of ACS treatment, but remained similar between the genders, and the same phenomenon was observed in the use of CCBs.

A non-PPL imprinted polymer (NIP), without a template, was used as a control. The morphology and particle size of the beads were investigated using scanning electron microscopy. The results revealed that both MIP and NIP had a spherical shape with a micron size of approximately 50-100 \u03bcm depending on the amounts of DVB and PPL used.

    "196": "Class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) move between skeletal muscle fibre cytoplasm and nuclei in response to various stimuli, suppressing activity of the exclusively nuclear transcription factor Mef2. Protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates class IIa HDACs in cardiac muscle, resulting in HDAC nuclear accumulation, but this has not been examined in skeletal muscle. Using HDAC4-green fluorescent protein (HDAC4-GFP) expressed in isolated skeletal muscle fibres, we now show that activation of PKA by the beta-receptor agonist isoproterenol or dibutyryl (Db) cAMP causes a steady HDAC4-GFP nuclear influx. The beta-receptor blocker propranolol or PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPS blocks the effects of isoproterenol on the nuclear influx of HDAC4-GFP, and Rp-cAMPS blocks the effects of Db cAMP. The HDAC4-GFP construct having serines 265 and 266 replaced with alanines, HDAC4 (S265/266A)-GFP, did not respond to beta-receptor or PKA activation. Immunoprecipitation results show that HDAC4-GFP is a substrate of PKA, but HDAC4 (S265/266A)-GFP is not, implicating HDAC4 serines 265/266 as the site(s) phosphorylated by PKA. During 10 Hz trains of muscle fibre electrical stimulation, the nuclear efflux rate of HDAC4-GFP, but not of HDAC4 (S265/266)-GFP, was decreased by PKA activation, directly demonstrating antagonism between the effects of fibre stimulation and beta-adrenergic activation of PKA on HDAC4 nuclear fluxes. 8-CPT, a specific activator of Epac, caused nuclear efflux of HDAC4-GFP, opposite to the effect of PKA. Db cAMP increased both phosphorylated PKA and GTP-bound Rap1. Our results demonstrate that the PKA and CaMKII pathways play important opposing roles in skeletal muscle gene expression by oppositely affecting the subcellular localization of HDAC4."
