    "0": "The influence of propranolol on surgical bleeding and hemostasis was studied in two different models in the normotensive rat. Propranolol was administered for 6 days subcutaneously and for 28 days orally. In both the tail and the muscle bleeding test the blood loss after the short-term as well as the long-term administration of propranolol was diminished as compared to control values. Highly significant differences were reached in the tail bleeding test. Previous studies have described the effect of propranolol on several constituents of the highly complex hemostatic process. Some of these effects enhance, others inhibit hemostasis. It is concluded that in the normotensive rat these hemostasis-enhancing effects are of greater importance than the inhibiting ones.", 
    "1": "The effects of antihypertensive agents on the frequencies of reported fainting, dizziness, losses of consciousness, and bone fractures were studied in a large, ambulatory elderly population. The frequencies of these symptoms were compared for subjects who used one or more of nine different antihypertensive agents and for subjects who were not using these medications and who served as a control group. Over 40 per cent of the total population were using at least one of the nine drug groups. Women who used antihypertensive medications reported significantly more fainting (P less than 0.001), dizziness (P less than 0.005) and \"blacking-out spells\" (P less than 0.002) but significantly fewer bone fractures (P less than 0.02) compared with women who were not using such medication in the control group. For men, the use of only one drug group, propranolol, was associated with a significant increase in fainting and dizziness but not blacking-out spells compared with men in the control. These results suggest that elderly persons may be subject to a variety of central nervous system side effects induced by antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "2": "The hemodynamic effects of beta-receptor blocking agents on the ejection fraction of patients with coronary artery disease during exercise have been studied previously using radionuclide techniques. Left ventricular volume measurements and the peak systolic pressure/end-systolic volume (PSP/ESV) index have been shown to be variables of left ventricular function that are less influenced by preload and afterload than is ejection fraction. Left ventricular volumes and PSP/ESV were therefore measured in 18 patients with proven coronary artery disease in the control state and after 2 weeks of daily maintenance therapy with either 240 mg propranolol or 60 mg timolol. Values at rest and during symptom-limited upright exercise were compared using the first pass technique and a multicrystal scintillation camera. Left ventricular volumes were measured by the area-length method. Because there was no difference between the propranolol and timolol groups, the results for both groups were combined. The ejection fraction at rest after beta-receptor blocker treatment was not significantly different from pretreatment measurements because of an increase in both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (p less than 0.01). However, the value for peak systolic pressure/end-systolic volume (PSP/ESV) index at rest was lower after treatment. The exercise ejection fraction was greater after treatment (p less than 0.01), owing to an increase in end-diastolic volume and unchanged end-systolic volume. In addition, there was a significant improvement in the directional change in the PSP/ESV ratio between rest and exercise from pretreatment to treatment (-1.1 +/- 2.5 to +0.2 +/- 1.2, p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "Removal of fetuses at day 14 of gestation (Ftx14) in the pregnant rat leads to a marked suppression of serum levels of rat placental lactogen (rPL-II). One might attribute this to compromised placental growth in the absence of a fetus. However, if ovariectomy and fetectomy (Ftx14 Ovx14) are carried out at the same time, a great increase in serum rPL-II levels is seen. This occurs despite a significant decrease in placental weight. When Ftx14 was performed on day 14 and Ovx was delayed 1, 2, or 3 days, the expected large increase in serum rPL-II was progressively attenuated compared to that seen when Ftx and Ovx were carried out simultaneously. Daily administration of 17 beta-estradiol (4 micrograms/rat X day) to Ftx14 Ovx14 pregnant rats resulted in a significant suppression of rPL-II and elevation of rPRL levels, a reversal of what is seen for these hormones in untreated Ftx14 Ovx14 animals. To test whether 17 beta-estradiol was acting through rat PRL (rPRL), serum levels of rPRL were elevated in Ftx13 Ovx13 animals with pimozide (0.6 mg/kg), a dopamine receptor blocker. There was no effect of this treatment on rPL-II levels. In late pregnancy (day 17) serum rPL-II levels remained high after removal of half the fetuses (1/2 Ftx), compared to the rapid fall in pregnant rats in which all fetuses were removed (Ftx17). Serum levels were also elevated in 1/2 Ftx animals compared to those in which half of the fetuses and placentas were removed by hemi-hysterectomy, suggesting that the increase in rPL-II levels in 1/2 Ftx animals was due to a stimulatory effect of the remaining fetuses on all of the placentas. These results indicate that the presence of the fetus is necessary for the normally observed increase in rPL-II levels in late pregnancy. In conclusion, fetal stimulators and ovarian inhibitors influence rPL-II secretion.", 
    "4": "Intravenous metoprolol, 0.2 mg/kg, was given to 11 patients with stable, partially reversible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and frequent ventricular ectopic depolarizations (VEDs). The frequency of VEDs during 8 h of continuous ECG recording was reduced from a mean of 214/h to 86/h (p less than .001). Four/11 patients had a greater than 90% reduction in VEDs. There were no adverse clinical effects during the period of drug administration. However, metoprolol produced small declines of 14% in the forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEB1) and 21% in the forced expiratory flow rate between 25% and 75% of the forced vital capacity (FVC) (FEF25-75). These data suggest that iv metoprolol is effective in reducing the frequency of VEDs in patients with COPD, although the extent of reduction in VEDs shows considerable interindividual variation. Metoprolol can be administered iv without inducing clinical bronchospasm in most patients.", 
    "5": "The effects of selective beta 1- as compared to nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking drugs on the peripheral circulation have not been adequately investigated. Ten healthy subjects received placebo for 1 wk followed by 4 wk of either propranolol or metoprolol in equivalent but increasing doses each week. Subjects then crossed over to the other sequence of placebo and drug. Measurements of calf blood flow, mean blood pressure, and calculation of calf vascular resistance were obtained at rest, after three loads of supine exercise on a bicycle ergometer, and during isoproterenol infusion testing. At the doses chosen, both beta-adrenergic blocking drugs induced equivalent decreases in exercise heart rate. Metoprolol lowered resting and exercise mean blood pressure at most doses, whereas propranolol had less of an effect on this variable. Neither drug altered resting or exercise calf blood flow or vascular resistance. More isoproterenol was required to increase the heart rate and decrease the vascular resistance during treatment with propranolol than with metoprolol. We conclude that in normotensive subjects metoprolol is somewhat more effective than propranolol in lowering mean arterial pressure during exercise when the drugs are given at doses equivalent in effects on exercise heart rate. Neither drug has a deleterious effect on calf blood flow or vascular resistance. Despite this, a marked separation between the vascular beta 2-adrenergic-blocking effects of these drugs can be demonstrated with an isoproterenol infusion indicating beta 2-adrenergic-receptor sparing by metoprolol.", 
    "6": "A case of severe alcohol withdrawal complicated by seizures, hallucinosis, hypertension, and supraventricular tachycardia is presented. When the patient showed no response to intravenous diazepam (total, 70 mg over 30 minutes) three 0.5-mg increments of propranolol were administered intravenously, resulting in immediate conversion to sinus rhythm and reduction of blood pressure from 210/130 mm Hg to 130/80 mm Hg. The use of intravenous propranolol as an adjunct to standard therapy in the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is discussed.", 
    "7": "The amplitude of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) for flickering light has been reported to be increased in migraine. In the present study, we have examined whether the VEPs are attenuated when the clinical state of the patient improves during a double-blind experiment with propranolol and femoxetine. VEPs for sinusoidally-modulated light were measured by spectral analysis, and an index depicting the visual reaction type was calculated. The group mean VEP index closely followed the group mean attack frequency, but individual variance was considerable. The changes were most evident in VEPs elicited by stimuli of about 20 Hz. During the treatments, the VEP and headache were also significantly correlated among subjects. The results suggest a close relationship between the enlarged VEPs and the headache mechanisms.", 
    "8": "Portal hypertension and variceal bleeding are discussed in relation to the history of a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis. Beta-blockade and sclerotherapy failed to prevent recurrent bleeding and a shunt operation had to be done. In this patient the portal venous pressure increased despite continuous propranolol administration.", 
    "9": "Fifteen patients receiving propranolol preoperatively and undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting had serum propranolol levels determined preoperatively and at several times early postoperatively. In addition, the patients' hemodynamic parameters and postoperative sodium nitroprusside dose requirements were monitored. All patients had significant multivessel disease and normal left ventricular function. Preoperative serum propranolol levels ranged from 16 to 243 ng/ml, with a mean level of 92 +/- 17 ng/ml; propranolol measured at the end of bypass ranged from 0 to 92 ng/ml, with a mean level of 23 +/- 7 ng/ml. Fourteen patients (93%) had hypertension postoperatively and required intravenous sodium nitroprusside to maintain mean blood pressure at or below 90 mm Hg. According to linear regression analysis, the severity of the postoperative hypertension or, specifically, the nitroprusside dose requirements, correlated significantly with the patients' serum propranolol levels postoperatively (correlation coefficient, R = 0.76, with p less than 0.001). The one normotensive patient had no detectable serum propranolol at any time postoperatively. No correlation was noted between the patient's preoperative serum propranolol levels and the need for nitroprusside therapy postoperatively. These results demonstrate that there is a significant relationship between residual propranolol and the development of hypertension postoperatively.", 
    "10": "Effects of adrenergic antagonists on chorda-evoked salivary secretion were studied. Flow rate, Ca and Na concentration of the chorda-evoked saliva were related to changes in frequency of stimulation of the chorda. Thus, as frequency of stimulation was increased, flow rate, Ca and Na concentrations increased. However, K concentration of nerve-evoked saliva was similar at all frequencies. Depletion of gland Ca concentration was also dependent on frequency of the stimulation; at the highest frequency, there was a greater depletion of gland Ca concentration than at lower frequencies. The data indicate that stimulation of the chorda tympani nerve elicits what can be called pure parasympathetic saliva, as neither phentolamine nor propranolol blocked chorda-evoked secretion.", 
    "11": "The role of the extramural vagus nerves in the modulation of gastric electrical activity and the myoelectrical complex (MEC) was studied by electrical stimulation of the nerve of Latarjet. As a consequence of the interruption of vagal impulses for five months by bilateral transthoracic vagotomy, the intramural nervous system began to perform as an organiser and modulator of the disorganised gastric electrical activity. The modulating role of the intramural nervous system was also demonstrated by stimulating the transmural electrical system, using parameters such as spike-firing and duration of stimulation of the MEC, and by blocking the adrenergic receptors.", 
    "12": "Since the role and mode of action of the sympathetic nervous system on interdigestive gastric motility is still unclear, we studied the effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic agents in 44 males without gastrointestinal diseases by 60 min i.v. infusion of the drugs. Each person had 2 experiments, with normal saline solution as a control and either of the drugs, applied in randomized order. The basic electrical rhythm (BER) and spike activity of the stomach were recorded by a probe with bipolar suction-needle electrodes placed in the antrum. The interdigestive migrating electrical complex (IDMEC) was recorded by a probe with 2 bipolar ring electrodes placed in the corpus and antrum of the stomach. The alpha-agonist norepinephrine, 0,4 micrograms/kg/min and the beta-agonist orciprenaline, 2 micrograms/kg/min, reduced the frequency of BER by 0.48 +/- 0.19 c/min and 0.68 +/- 0.10 c/min respectively, and decreased the spike activity by 22.7 +/- 3.1% and 30.8 +/- 2.3% respectively. Norepinephrine shortened the duration of phase III from 5.1 +/- 1.9 min to 3.0 +/- 1.4 min, and orciprenaline from 4.7 +/- 1.1 min to 2.2 +/- 0.5 min. The alpha-antagonist phentolamine, 50 micrograms/kg/min and the beta-agonist propranolol, 10 micrograms/kg/min, increased the BER frequency by 0.88 +/- 0.10 c/min and 0.64 +/- 0.13 c/min respectively. They increased the spike activity by 20.7 +/- 2.4% and 58.3 +/- 2.0% respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "Beta-adrenoceptor agonists have been reported to inhibit gastric acid secretion in vivo but their site and mode of action is uncertain. A study of the effects of such agents on acid secretion in the rat has been made using both an in vivo preparation and an in vitro one where possible effects due to neural, hormonal or cardiovascular actions of beta-agonists are avoided. In conscious rats with Heidenhain pouches, isoprenaline (40 micrograms kg-1h-1) inhibited the response to pentagastrin (20 micrograms kg-1h-1). This inhibition was abolished by propranolol (2 mg kg-1) and butoxamine (8 mg kg-1) and partially reversed by practolol (8 mg kg-1). Propranolol alone (2 mg kg-1) significantly increased the response to pentagastrin in the pouch rats but butoxamine and practolol (both at 8 mg kg-1) and the inactive isomer (+)-propranolol were without effect on the pentagastrin response. In the rat isolated stomach preparation isoprenaline, salbutamol, salmefamol , adrenaline and nor-adrenaline all stimulated acid output over the range 2 X 10(-7) to 10(-5)M. These responses were antagonised by propranolol (2 X 10(-5)M), pindolol and timolol (10(-6)M) but only nor-adrenaline stimulated secretion was inhibited by the selective antagonists practolol, atenolol, butoxamine and ICI 118551. In vitro responses to beta-adrenoceptor agonists were not antagonised by atropine (10(-5)M), metiamide (10(-4)M) or prostaglandin E2 (10(-5)M).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "Verapamil, a calcium antagonist, was compared with propranolol, a widely used beta-adrenoreceptor blocker, in hypertensive patients with respect to its antihypertensive efficacy and incidence and severity of adverse effects. Both drugs caused similar blood pressure reductions without interfering with pulse pressure. The hypotensive effect of verapamil was not accompanied by any effect on heart rate, while after propranolol there was a significant bradycardia. ST-segment and T wave abnormalities at rest and after exercise were partially or completely reverted by both drugs. The incidence and severity of adverse effects was very low and no patient was withdrawn from the study because of complaints due to the active drugs. Verapamil can be compared as antihypertensive drug to the beta-blocker propranolol and this may justify, together with the absence of negative effects on lipids, blood sugar, serum electrolytes and renal function, its use as an antihypertensive drug of first choice.", 
    "15": "Forty term patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension were treated with the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol (Tenormin R; ICI) for at least 7 days prior to parturition. The antenatal cardiotocography (CTG) was visually analysed before and during treatment. The mean basal fetal heart rate (FHR) decreased from 143 +/- 7 beats per minute (bpm) to 133 +/- 8 bpm. In 13.1% of the recordings in treated patients there was a decrease in long-term variability for a period of more than 20 minutes; this was observed in only 2.3% prior to treatment. The amplitude of the accelerations was reduced from 23 +/- 6 bpm to 18 +/- 4 bpm. It was demonstrated that atenolol affected antenatal CTG, and this has to be taken into consideration when interpreting antenatal CTG as one parameter for evaluation of fetal well-being.", 
    "16": "Clinical as well as experimental studies have demonstrated a 70% reduction in utero-placental blood flow in pregnancies affected by severe hypertension (13, 19). In pregnant renal hypertensive rats, propranolol administration causes a further 50% reduction in utero-placental blood flow (16). The present study on renal hypertensive rats was performed in order to explore the acute effects on central haemodynamics and utero-placental blood flow of the non-selective beta-blocker pindolol, which also has an intrinsic beta-stimulatory effect. Renal hypertension was induced by partial clamping of both renal arteries in female Wistar rats 4 weeks before pregnancy. Some 2-4 days before expected parturition, cardiac output was determined with the dye-dilution technique and blood flow to the reproductive organs with the microsphere technique, both before and after acute pindolol administration. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded continuously during the experiment. After pindolol injection, mean arterial pressure fell by 22% due to a 38% reduction in total peripheral resistance. No significant changes in cardiac output, stroke volume or heart rate were found. Placental blood flow was significantly reduced, by 30%, whereas myometrial and ovarian blood flows were reduced by only 18 and 9%, respectively. Thus, the reduction in blood supply to the reproductive organs in renal hypertensive rats after acute pindolol administration was most pronounced in the placenta. This reduction in placental flow was, however, only about half as pronounced as after propranolol, which lacks intrinsic beta-stimulatory effects. This may suggest that vasodilating beta-receptors may play an important role in the maternal placental vascular bed.", 
    "17": "Plasma levels of labetalol were measured in 7 hypertensive pregnant women who were given 200 mg three times daily orally. The plasma concentrations were usually lower than those reported in the non-pregnant state at a comparative dose. In 5 women the ratio between fetal and maternal plasma labetalol concentrations could be calculated at parturition. The median value of this quotient was about 50%. The effect of labetalol 1 mg/kg body weight intravenously was registered with functional placental scintigraphy. Fifteen women participated. A computer-linked gamma camera above the uterus registered the radioactivity in the placental region after two intravenous bolus injections of 18.5 MBq indium-113m chloride. From the radioactivity uptake curves, uteroplacental blood flow indices could be calculated before and 30 minutes after the labetalol injection. Despite a significant reduction in maternal blood pressure, no change in uteroplacental blood flow index was found. This could indicate that the vascular resistance in the maternal placental circulation was reduced by labetalol.", 
    "18": "The transfer of atenolol and metoprolol to human breast milk was studied in 7 lactating women with hypertension. Concentrations of atenolol and metoprolol in maternal plasma and milk and in plasma of the nursed infants were determined. Blood samples were obtained from the women and from the infants during a dose interval. Milk was collected repeatedly from the left breast but only twice from the right breast. The ratio between the area under the milk concentration versus time curve ( AUCm ) and the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve ( AUCp ) in the mother varied between 2.0 and 3.1 for metoprolol and 1.1 and 3.1 for atenolol. The milk concentrations of metoprolol in the right breast were similar to those in the left breast, although the latter had been emptied more frequently. For atenolol the milk concentrations in the right breast were lower than in the left breast. The plasma concentrations of metoprolol and atenolol in the infants were negligible or below the limit of detection. Our results show that exposure of the infant to metoprolol can be minimized if nursing is not undertaken earlier than 3-4 hours after dose intake.", 
    "19": "Pharmacokinetic studies on the concentration of the beta 1-blocker metoprolol have been performed in maternal plasma, amniotic fluid, breast milk and the plasma of the newborn. The concentration of metoprolol in maternal plasma exceeded that in the amniotic fluid initially , but not later on. The quotient between the metoprolol concentration in the maternal venous blood and the mixed cord blood at the time of parturition is at about 1. In the maternal plasma the metoprolol concentration decreases rapidly after the latest dose, probably because of an increased clearance rate. Blood levels of metoprolol during the first postnatal hours increase almost fourfold and are generally followed by a decrease over the next 15 hours. Active metabolites of metoprolol (alfa-OH-metoprolol and 0-demethyl-metoprolol) are found in the urine of the newborn. The breast milk concentration of metoprolol is three times as high as in the maternal plasma but the suckling newborn will only show very low or unmeasurable plasma levels between consecutive breast feeding periods, in the majority of cases.", 
    "20": "The separate roles of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in regulating fluid and calcium (Ca) secretion by rat salivary glands were examined using phenylephrine (PE), an adrenergic agonist that acts predominantly on alpha-receptors, isoproterenol (ISO), an adrenergic agonist that acts predominantly on beta-receptors, and PE and ISO in combination with beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (PROP) and alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (PHENTO), respectively. PE evoked a greater volume of saliva from submandibular (SM) gland than from parotid (PA) gland, whereas ISO evoked a similar volume of saliva from both glands during 60-min of drug stimulation. PE even at a low dose had beta-adrenergic effects on flow rate of salivary glands because pretreatment of rats with PROP (1 mg/kg) 20 min before PE (5 mg/kg, i.p.) stimulation resulted in a 4-fold reduction in total volume of PE-evoked PA saliva. Thus alpha-adrenergic receptors play a major role in fluid secretion by SM glands but play only a minor role in PA glands. ISO evoked SM and PA saliva with Ca concentration higher than that evoked by PE. ISO (25 mg/kg, i.p.) also had an effect on alpha-adrenergic receptors as well as beta-adrenergic receptors. Although PHENTO did not significantly alter flow rate and volume of ISO-evoked PA or SM saliva, Ca concentration of ISO-evoked saliva was greatly potentiated by PHENTO. Total Ca output of ISO-evoked saliva from either gland was not significantly altered by PHENTO. Thus, in both salivary glands, activation of beta-adrenergic receptors evoked saliva with a high concentration of Ca.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "Human alveolar macrophages as well as macrophages derived from Teflon culture of blood-borne monocytes were incubated with synthetic analogues of 2-lysophosphatidylcholine and then tested for their cytotoxic capacity against an allogeneic lymphoma cell line. Metabolic, rather stable analogues enhanced macrophage cytotoxicity significantly. This phenomenon was shown both in a growth-inhibition assay as well as in the 51Cr release assay. Macrophage activation was dose- and time-dependent and was potentiated at temperatures above 37 degrees C. Incubation of the macrophages with the active compounds induced characteristic changes in cell morphology as revealed by scanning electron microscopy.", 
    "22": "The pharmacological effects of two newly synthesized anorectic agents CM 57373 (4-amino-1-(6-bromopyrid-2-yl) piperidine hydrochloride) and CM 57493 (4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-1-(2-cyanoethyl)-1,2,3,6 tetrahydrophyridine hydrochloride) have been studied. Both drugs decreased food intake dose dependently in rats deprived of food for 20 h/d. The doses that inhibited food intake by 50 percent (ID50) were 9.74 mg kg-1 p.o. for CM 57493 and 7.37 mg kg-1 p.o. for CM 57373. The general behaviour of the rats was not affected at anorectic doses and no amphetamine-like stimulation was observed. The anorectic effect of CM 57373 was selectively, but not completely, antagonized by metergoline and methysergide, two antagonists of serotoninergic receptors in the central nervous system. Neither noradrenaline antagonists (propranolol and phentolamine) nor a dopamine antagonist (penfluridol) affected the anorexia induced by CM 57373. These results indicate that the anorectic effect of CM 57373 is, at least, partially mediated by the serotoninergic system. The mechanism of action of CM 57493 is more complex, since several distinct neurotransmitter systems appear to be involved in its effect. In cross-tolerance experiments with fenfluramine, there was a reduction of the anorectic activity of CM 57493, suggesting similar mechanisms of action for these two drugs, even though pretreatment with metergoline or methysergide antagonized the anorectic effect of fenfluramine but not that of CM 57493. The anorectic effect of CM 57493 was antagonized by pretreatment with propranolol, a beta-noradrenergic antagonist, suggesting an involvement for the beta-noradrenergic system as well. Pretreatment with phentolamine or penfluridol did not modify the effect of CM 57493 on food intake. In-vitro and in-vivo biochemical studies showed that CM 57373 and CM 57493 act mainly on central serotoninergic mechanisms. CM 57373 is a serotonin releaser and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. But, unlike fenfluramine which affects the storage pool for 5HT, it releases 5HT mainly from a functional pool. CM 57493 did not affect serotonin release and uptake but exhibited a high affinity to serotonin postsynaptic receptors.", 
    "23": "Blood pressure reduction induced by antihypertensive drugs with different mode of action approximated the pathological altered synthesis of TXB2 in spontaneously hypertensive rats to values of normotensive rats: in the kidney medulla by all drugs used, in the aorta only by the most efficient drugs (clonidine, dihydralazine) and in plasma and serum only in connection with a reduction in heart rate (clonidine, propranolol). The pathologically increased synthesis of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was unchanged by drugs, therefore the ratio PGI2/TXA2 was directed towards the vasodilatory prostanoid. Unlike SHR in NTR an equieffective blood pressure reduction induced by the same drugs was without influence on TXB2 synthesis. From these results we can conclude, that the influence of antihypertensive drugs on TXB2 synthesis depends on the normotensive or hypertensive state of the animals and not on the drug per se. In hypertensive patients a blood pressure reduction by linseed oil was connected with a reduced TXB2 plasma level, too.", 
    "24": "The combination of dexamethasone (2 mg every 6 hours) carbimazole (15 mg every 8 hours) and potassium iodide (XV drops every 8 hours) has been proposed in the preparation of 21 patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease for surgery. The combination was administered for 6 days and the subtotal thyroidectomy was performed on day 7. All patients had normal serum Triiodothyronine levels after 4 days of such treatment. This combined drug therapy appears to be a rapid, sage and effective preparation for thyroid surgery in patients with Graves' disease and should replace conventional preparation with carbimazole and potassium iodide and beta-blocker preparation in all cases where there are no contra-indications to the use of corticosteroids.", 
    "25": "A study of the effects of pindolol on potassium homeostasis was undertaken in 25 patients (19 women, 6 men) with essential hypertension. The patients were maintained on their usual diet and were withdrawn from antihypertensive therapy for three weeks before the study began. They were then randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: (a) pindolol, 15 mg daily; (b) hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg daily; and (c) both drugs combined. Total body potassium (TBK), urine aldosterone excretion, and plasma renin activity (PRA) were measured after eight weeks of therapy and compared with pretreatment values. Mean PRA remained unchanged in patients taking only pindolol or the drug combination, but it rose significantly in patients taking only hydrochlorothiazide. Mean urine aldosterone concentrations fell in patients taking only pindolol, rose in those taking only hydrochlorothiazide, and remained unchanged in those taking the combination. Mean TBK concentrations rose significantly in patients taking only pindolol or the combination, and fell significantly in those taking only hydrochlorothiazide. The rise in TBK concentrations with the combination clearly suggests that pindolol offsets the potassium wastage induced by diuretics, though probably by a mechanism outside the renin-aldosterone system. Because of this rise, it may be possible to eliminate potassium supplementation in patients taking the combination pindolol and hydrochlorothiazide.", 
    "26": "The new antiarrhythmic drug propafenone and its main human metabolite 5-hydroxypropafenone were investigated for antiarrhythmic, local anaesthetic, Ca++-antagonistic and beta-adrenoceptor blocking effects as well as for their activity on the central nervous system. In isolated organs (guinea-pig atria, rat aortic strips) 5-hydroxypropafenone had a smaller effect on the maximum following frequency, a greater negative inotropic effect, a greater Ca++-antagonistic effect and a very distinctly weaker beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect than propafenone. Consistent with its antiarrhythmic potency in vitro, intra-cutaneous 5-hydroxypropafenone had a smaller local anaesthetic effect in the guinea pig wheal. In contrast to these findings 5-hydroxypropafenone showed a stronger antiarrhythmic potency in vivo (rat and dog), as demonstrated on the aconitine- and infarction arrhythmias. In addition, in His bundle studies 5-hydroxypropafenone caused a more marked prolongation of the conduction time in atria, AV-node and His-Purkinje system. In vivo the beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect of 5-hydroxypropafenone (isoprenaline tachycardia, rat) was smaller than that of propafenone. The difference between the in vitro and in vivo potency of 5-hydroxypropafenone may be explained by differences in pharmacokinetics, e.g. by a smaller distribution volume compared to propafenone. CNS effects were investigated due to local anaesthetic properties of the substances tested. As indicator of CNS activity anticonvulsant effects, detectably beneath convulsion-inducing doses, were determined in rats (max. electroshock seizures). The results show low CNS activity of propafenone which is even lower for the metabolite but which is distinctly higher for lidocaine and - related to the antiarrhythmic potency - for flecainide, too.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "The effect on heart rate of pindolol 5, 15 and 30 mg/day, a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker possessing intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, administered to 8 healthy volunteers for 14 days was studied. Heart rate was continuously recorded over 24 h during placebo treatment before each sequence, every 2 days during treatment, and then on the 15th, 17th and 18th days. Pindolol in the three doses used had no significant effect on mean heart rate over 24 h. It tended to lower mean diurnal heart rate non-significantly between noon and 6 p.m. Pindolol raised nocturnal heart rate between midnight and 6 a.m. to a comparable extent at all the doses used. Sympathetic tone is at its lowest during that period, which makes it possible to detect the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of pindolol. After cessation of treatment, a rebound effect was observed, cardioacceleration being most marked after 30 mg/day.", 
    "28": "In rats, the intravenous infusion with acebutolol lead to a dose dependent decrease of arterial blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance, to sinus bradycardia, widening of the QRS complex, 1st and 2nd degree AV-block and intraventricular conductance disturbances. Nine possible antidotes were administered i.v. to rats which had been infused with 2 mg/kg X min acebutolol for 60 min. Isoprenaline proved the best antidote against acebutolol antagonizing the bradycardia by 88% and the hypotension completely. The activities of orciprenaline and prenalterol were lower than those of isoprenaline. Dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine antagonized acebutolol-induced hypotension, but did not influence considerably the bradycardia. Glucagon, on the other hand, antagonized the acebutolol-induced bradycardia by 47% but exerted only a small activity on the hypotension. Aminophyllin and calcium were nearly ineffective as antidotes against acebutolol. Isoprenaline and dopamine infused simultaneously restored heart rate, arterial blood pressure and cardiac output of acebutol-poisoned rats. The survival time of rats infused with 4 mg/kg X min acebutolol was doubled by the additional infusion of 0.2 mg/kg X min isoprenaline. The antagonistic activity of a treatment with isoprenaline and dopamine against the cardiovascular toxicity of acebutolol was confirmed in rabbits.", 
    "29": "Autonomic nervous system abnormalities have been implicated in infants dying of or considered at high risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In a rat model, norepinephrine (0.02 mg/kg) caused systemic hypertension and numerous pulmonary petechiae, the latter a common finding in SIDS. Petechiae were not seen below the diaphragm. The animals were killed by tracheal occlusion 5 min after the intravenous administration of norepinephrine. The number of pulmonary petechiae was greatly reduced by alpha-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine) and dopaminergic blockade (haloperidol) but not by beta-adrenergic blockade (timolol). A significantly greater reduction of peak mean systemic arterial pressure occurred after alpha-adrenergic blockade than with other blocking agents. It is conceivable that hypoxia-induced endogenous catecholamine release contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary petechiae found at necropsy of SIDS victims.", 
    "30": "The efficacy of long-term treatments with the vasodilator antihypertensive pildralazine alone and in combination with propranolol or dihydrochlorothiazide in preventing blood pressure increase and cerebrovascular lesions in saline-drinking spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was evaluated. Groups of 20-40 animals were treated daily for 13 weeks. At the end of the experiments the brains were examined histologically and vascular lesions, ranging from arterial wall damage to cerebral infarction, were checked. In the control groups (n = 60), systolic blood pressure gradually rose to over 200 mmHg, and about 74% of the animals had lesions. Pildralazine at a dose of 1 mg/kg p.o. significantly inhibited the onset of severe hypertension; the combination of pildralazine with moderately effective doses of propranolol (10 mg/kg p.o.) or dihydrochlorothiazide (5 mg/kg p.o.) completely prevented the blood pressure increase. When blood pressure control was achieved, the incidence of cerebrovascular lesions was also significantly reduced.", 
    "31": "Drugs with local anesthetic properties like propranolol, tetracaine, lidocaine, procaine, induce concentration dependent potentials in artificial membranes. The size of the drug induced potential correlates with cardiodepressant activity, measured as decrease in force of contraction of guinea-pig atria and papillary muscles. Drugs inducing high potentials like propranolol and tetracaine, show low EC50 values in cardiac tissues. Propranolol in comparison to lidocaine diffuses more rapidly across the lipid membrane as derived from the time dependent decline in membrane potential and from radioactive tracer measurements. After application of a single drug concentration on cardiac tissues a longer time is required for propranolol to reach steady state than for example for lidocaine. Effects are higher at pH 9 than at pH 7 and 7.4, respectively. The results suggest that the site of action of propranolol primarily are cytoplasmic cell structures whereas that of lidocaine and procaine is the outer membrane surface.", 
    "32": "In view of the use of an electronically processed digital plethysmography as a noninvasive pharmacological tool - particularly to measure effects of organic nitrates - 9 healthy young volunteers were examined. The purpose of the investigation was to study baseline recordings and to assess the effects of several well defined exogenous influences. The electronic processor calculated the D/H-ratio of each plethysmographic pulse wave, where D represents the depth of the dicrotic minimum measured from the apex of the systolic maximum and H the total hight of the plethysmographic wave. The D/H-ratio was not significantly influenced by a hot beverage, but fell after a cold drink. In undisturbed volunteers the D/H-ratio had a tendency to fall slightly during a 3-h period of observation. This tendency could be eliminated by small doses of pindolol or dihydroergotamine, but individual fluctuations of the curves were still visible. It appears therefore that a fully automated evaluation of plethysmographic recordings yields best results if the findings in a group of volunteers are averaged.", 
    "33": "Myocardial necrosis was produced in rats by isoprenaline (ISP) administration (85 mg X kg-1 s.c.) for two consecutive days. Rats sacrificed at 12, 24, 30, 36 and 48 h, respectively, after the last injection of ISP showed a marked increase in serum enzymes, viz. creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate transaminase (AST) and tissue content of lactate. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the glycogen content of myocardium and the activity of enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK) was changed in biphasic fashion, i.e. initial enhancement of activity was followed by a persistent fall. All these changes were present along with typical infarct-like necrosis as seen microscopically. Both oxyfedrine (OXF, 2, 4 and 8 mg X kg-1 i.m.) and propranolol (PROP, 1, 2 and 4 mg X kg-1 i.m.) administered for 5 days before and two days during ISP administration were effective in providing protection. However, with 8 mg X kg-1 dose of PROP sporadic high mortality was observed. Serum AST and CPK levels in OXF (4 and 8 mg X kg-1) and PROP (2 and 4 mg X kg-1) pretreated animals returned back to the range of controls. Unlike OXF, the LDH level in PROP pretreated rats, though reduced significantly, remained always higher than the control values. The beneficial effect of OXF on myocardial glycolytic flux was dose-dependent. 8 mg X kg-1 of OXF increased (31%) the glycogen content significantly (p less than 0.01) and the activity of enzyme PFK and tissue lactate content were brought back to normal. PROP did not exhibit dose-dependent reduction in the lactate content of the myocardium and it was never restored back to the range of control values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "The ophthalmic examination of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy treated with high doses of verapamil over a considerable period of time showed no evidence of a side effect of the drug, thus proving its ocular safety. This could be verified by densitometric image analysis of Scheimpflug photographs of the eyes. The data were used for statistical tests on lens transparency. Changes in lens transparency, i.e. a probable drug-induced cataract were found in none of the patients.", 
    "35": "Twelve male patients, with a primary complaint of premature ejaculation in a setting of chronic anxiety with prominent somatic manifestations, participated in a double-blind trial: propranolol against placebo. The study consisted of 5 X 4 week phases: run-in, propranolol or placebo--120 mg/day allocated randomly, wash-out; placebo or propranolol and run-out, in a balanced design. Anxiety was rated initially, and every 2 weeks, throughout the trial using the Hamilton Rating Scale. Sitting blood pressure and pulse were also noted. The time to coital ejaculation (every 3 days) was recorded using a stopwatch, and subjects were also required to rate \"overall coital satisfaction\" and \"quality of erection\". Neither prematurity nor other signs/symptoms of anxiety improved on the preparations, which were statistically equivalent. Moderate beta-blockade was achieved with propranolol as evidenced by a median reduction in pulse rate of 5 beats/min.", 
    "36": "In the present article the interaction of 1- isopropylamino-3-[4-(2-methoxyethyl)-phenoxy]-2-propanol (metoprolol, Beloc) with human erythrocytes is reported. Metoprolol is well known and acts mainly as a selective beta-1-antagonist. While erythrocyte aggregation, suspension osmolality and pH-values were unchanged, red cell deformability was markedly improved. Investigation into the furosemide-sensitive fluxes resulted in an inhibition of sodium efflux and in a constant water content of human erythrocytes. These in vitro results suggest that metoprolol induced improvement of red cell deformability cannot be explained by shape changes of erythrocytes.", 
    "37": "Investigations on the mechanism of the positive inotropic action of (+)-tranylcypromine (TCP) on left, electrically stimulated, isolated guinea-pig atria led to the following results: In contrast to (-)-TCP, the positive inotropic action of (+)-TCP on the guinea-pig atria is not abolished, but only weakened by pretreating animals with reserpine. The positive inotropic effect of indirectly acting sympathomimetics, such as tyramine or methamphetamine, on isolated atria of reserpine pretreated guinea pigs recovers within 15-30 min of incubation with (+)-TCP. The same applies to other inhibitors of MAO-A, such as clorgiline and pargyline as well as selegiline (deprenyl) in higher concentrations. Inhibitors of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) synthesis as alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine and FLA-63 (bis-(4-methyl-1-homopiperazinyl-thiocarbonyl)-disulphide] prevent the positive inotropic action of (+)-TCP on atrial preparations of reserpine pretreated guinea pigs, and abolish the (+)-TCP induced restitution of the effects of tyramine and methamphetamine. A destruction of adrenergic nerves using 6-hydroxydopamine also prevents the positive inotropic action of (+)-TCP. These results suggest that (+)-TCP increases the net neuronal synthesis of catecholamines.", 
    "38": "Morphological changes were examined in the corneal endothelium of rabbits after administration of several drugs widely used in ophthalmology. After administration of epinephrine and dipivalyl epinephrine eye drops, swelling of corneal endothelial cells developed; however, these changes were reversible. No pathological changes were observed in the corneal endothelial layer following the administration of timolol, betamethasone, and gentamicin eye drops. Morphological changes were observed in the corneal endothelial layer after the subconjunctival injection of timolol, betamethasone, and gentamicin.", 
    "39": "The effect of (D,L)-propranolol at various concentrations (3.4 X 10(-6) to 3.4 X 10(-3) M) on human spermatozoal motility and zona-free hamster ova penetration was studied in vitro. Propranolol, in 10(-4) M concentration, completely abolished the spermatozoal motility and hamster ova penetration. No significant effect was observed on the spermatozoal motility and the hamster ova penetration efficiency with concentrations of the agent as low as 3.4 X 10(-6) M. The blocking action of propranolol on the in vitro penetration of hamster ova appears to be a direct consequence of the depressive effect of this drug on spermatozoal motility.", 
    "40": "The effect of long-term administration of propranolol (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg-1 p.o.) and that of labetalol (2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 mg/kg-1 p.o. and 1 mg/kg-1 i.p.) on the development of hypertension was studied in female rats of SHR/N/Ibn strain. The experiment was started on 6-week-old animals. Rats received the tested drugs once daily between 11 and 12 o'clock. From the 29th day on (i.e. after the age of 10 weeks) the arterial blood pressure was measured bloodlessly twice weekly 2 hours before the daily dose of the drug. Labetalol given p.o. in a dose of 2 mg/kg-1 had no effect on the development of hypertension, while the doses 4.0 and 8.0 mg/kg-1 decreased the arterial pressure by about 4 kPa (30 mm Hg). After drug withdrawal a rapid rise was observed in the arterial pressure to values approaching the values recorded in control animals. In the animals receiving labetalol parenterally (1 mg/kg-1 i.p.) the blood pressure was significantly lower than in control rats. After drug withdrawal the blood pressure increased gradually, however, even on the 54th day of the experiment it was slightly below that in controls. Propranolol given orally in doses of 0.2 mg/kg-1 delayed the development of hypertension, while in the dose of 0.4 mg/kg-1 it prevented its development. After withdrawal of the lower drug dose the blood pressure remained for about 2 weeks at a level similar to the previous one, later on it increased steeply to the values observed in controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "Patients diagnosed as hypertensive have a high complaint rate, both on and off treatment and this has been postulated to be due to either their disease process, their being labelled as hypertensive, or to their treatment. Data from 6637 hypertensive patients being entered into clinical trials in general practice have been analysed to determine the relationship between the patient's age, sex, concurrent illnesses, concurrent medication, whether they were on antihypertensive treatment and the frequency of their reporting symptoms. The analysis was conducted using a multivariate technique. The frequency of reporting symptoms was greater in females than males. Those receiving antihypertensive therapy reported more symptoms than those who were not. This was notable with those receiving a beta-adrenoceptor blocker (47% of such patients complaining). Patients receiving concurrent medication were more likely to report a symptom than those not (48 compared to 37%). This was particularly noticeable if central nervous system-acting drugs were prescribed where the prevalence of symptoms was 52%. Patients already on antihypertensive treatment were more likely to be taking other medication for other conditions (37 vs 31%) than those not receiving antihypertensive treatment. Females were more likely to be taking other tablets than males (38 compared to 30%). The only symptoms which were less prevalent in those receiving treatment were headache, dizziness and breathlessness. All other symptoms were increased or unchanged in patients on antihypertensive therapy. This study indicates that present treatment for hypertension produces a high complaint rate from patients and that, when patients so complain, the possibility of their symptoms being due to their concurrent medication should be considered.", 
    "42": "To assess the added effects of nicardipine and beta-blockers on the left ventricular (LV) function, 2.5 mg of i.v. nicardipine was given to 9 patients with coronary artery disease, pretreated with propranolol (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.). The changes in LV function observed after nicardipine were compared with those induced by nifedipine (20-30 mg sublingually), in 8 comparable patients also pretreated with propranolol. Nicardipine normalized the cardiac output and the rate of LV relaxation, both depressed by propranolol, without changes in LV filling pressure. After nicardipine, end-systolic volume (52 to 42 ml/m2; P less than 0.01) and ejection fraction (59 +/- 8 to 66 +/- 9%; P less than 0.01) improved; the mean systolic and diastolic wall stresses decreased respectively by 19% (P less than 0.01) and 21% (P less than 0.01) whereas the maximal LV pressure/volume ratio (Emax), an index of LV inotropic state, was unchanged (+4%; NS). Further, although nicardipine and nifedipine produced identical changes in LV systolic pressure (-25 vs -26 mmHg; NS nicardipine vs nifedipine) and in heart rate, the changes in end-systolic volume (-9 +/- 4 vs -3 +/- 9 ml/m2; P less than 0.005), in Emax (+0.14 +/- 0.31 vs -0.20 +/- 0.22 mmHg/ml/m2; P less than 0.025) and in ejection fraction (+7 +/- 4 vs +2 +/- 4%; P less than 0.025) were significantly greater after nicardipine than after nifedipine. In conclusion, nicardipine administered after propranolol improves LV pump function and has no negative inotropic effects as indicated by the lack of dP/dt Max and Emax changes. These additive effects of nicardipine after propranolol were greater than those of nifedipine administered at an equipotent vasodilator dosage.", 
    "43": "This study investigated the emotional effects of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent oxprenolol (40 mg, p.o.) and the tranquilizing agent diazepam (5 mg, p.o.) in healthy subjects under three situational conditions: an emotionally neutral control situation and two situations designed to arouse different levels of anxiety. Both oxprenolol and diazepam induced positive emotional changes only in the more strongly anxiety-arousing situation. Significant differences between oxprenolol and diazepam in inducing emotional stabilization were not demonstrable.", 
    "44": "In a double-blind crossover study, 8 patients with classical migraine received disulfiram (400 mg/day) for 6 days, alternating with matched placebo tablets at 2 weekly intervals. Intravenous dopamine and tyramine pressor tests were performed on the 3rd and 6th days of each phase, respectively. 50-75% of patients experienced migraine attacks within 24 h of a test. There was no difference in the incidence of attacks between dopamine and tyramine injections. The number of migraine-free days was more during the placebo week than during disulfiram treatment (p less than 0.05). The post-tyramine migraine index correlated directly with the amount of tyramine administered during the dose-response test (r = 0.66), but no such relationship was found with dopamine. In a further study, post-tyramine migraine was observed in only 1 of 5 patients treated with propranolol (80 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Neither disulfiram nor propranolol influenced the tyramine pressor sensitivity. It is concluded that increased adrenergic activity is responsible for more frequent attacks during disulfiram medication. A similar mechanism probably is responsible for post-dopamine/tyramine migraine in susceptible subjects. It is unlikely that tyramine plays any specific role, except via its effect on the adrenergic system, in the pathogenesis of migraine attacks. However, the tyramine challenge test can be useful in the evaluation of a putative antimigranous activity of a new drug.", 
    "45": "The binding of the neuroleptic agent 3H-spiperone and the beta-blocker 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) was investigated in rat forebrain homogenates. The pH of the buffer medium was found to specifically affect binding to certain sites. Omission of ascorbic acid from the binding assay influenced binding in a pH-dependent way. Preincubation with a relatively low concentration of ascorbic acid markedly reduced the binding of both ligands except the nonspecific binding of 3H-spiperone. Lipid peroxidation as revealed by malonyldialdehyde formation, was increased by low and decreased by high ascorbic acid concentrations. The possible relationship between changes in number of binding sites and liposolubility is discussed.", 
    "46": "The changes in the responsiveness of the cat ileocecal sphincter (ICS) to adrenergic agents during the postnatal period were studied by the effect of noradrenaline (applied cumulatively: 0.01-100 mumol) on the mechanical activity:smooth muscle tone and phasic contractions. Noradrenaline contracted the ICS smooth muscle through alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. These receptors were differentiated in the first postnatal days but continue to develop functionally even after 60 days postnatal. An age-determined decrease in the EC50 values of noradrenaline, inducing tonic contractions, was established. Noradrenaline inhibited the phasic contractions of ICS. This effect increased after beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, and disappeared after blocking of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, which suggests the existence of a postjunctional inhibitory adrenergic receptor of alpha 1 type. The beta-adrenergic receptors in the ICS smooth muscle are not differentiated until 15 days postnatal. They developed functionally towards 30 days postnatal.", 
    "47": "Rats were subjected to long-term physical exercise by swimming and their hearts were examined electrophysiologically in order to identify relevant factors as mechanisms of protection from rhythm disturbances. The role of catecholamines was also studied using a chronically applied beta-adrenergic blocking drug, Practolol, or a catecholamine depleting drug, Reserpine. The results were compared with those obtained in rats similarly injected but kept in sedentary life. Action potential duration was found to be prolonged in trained animals regardless of the drug employed. Trained animals showed increments in the myocardial mass. Prolongation of the action potential coincided with lower values for maximum follow frequencies. It is suggested that the effects elicited could protect the heart against rhythm disturbances. The sympathetic nervous system seemed to play no important role.", 
    "48": "Fifteen outpatients with stage II essential hypertension were treated with corgard, a non-cardioselective beta-blocker, for 12-15 months. Study (in 12 patients) of the shifts in the central and intracardiac hemodynamics (by EchoCG for 3-4 months) demonstrated that a 24-25% decrease in the blood pressure occurred at the expense of a significant reduction in the cardiac index (by 25.6%) and heart rate (by 29%). The stroke index did not undergo any significant changes. This was accompanied by a moderate increase of the total peripheral vascular resistance (by 7.4%, P less than 0.05). The intramyocardial tension decreased by 18%, the thickness of the interventricular septum by 7.1% (P less than 0.001), the myocardial mass dropped by 9.5% (P less than 0.001). The rate of the shortening of the circulatory fibers of the left ventricle myocardium decreased by 10% (P less than 0.01). The ejection, the degree of a change in the anteroposterior size or in the end systolic and end diastolic sizes remained unchanged. Thus, application of corgard can be regarded as fairly advantageous since this drug produces a long-acting effect. It can be administered once or twice a day, with dosage variations being insignificant. This circumstance facilitates the regimen of a long-term outpatient treatment.", 
    "49": "Sustained high intraocular pressure resulting in optic nerve cupping and loss of ganglion cells was produced in five rhesus monkeys and eight pigmented rabbits by applying argon laser energy to the trabecular meshwork. In addition, the rabbits manifested buphthalmus. Flow of carbon particles subsequently injected into the anterior chamber was obstructed at the trabecular meshwork by a wound-healing response that closed the intratrabecular spaces. Besides this sustained high intraocular pressure as a result of late scarring, an acute hypertensive response was seen in all rabbits which may correspond to the acute hypertension seen after laser trabeculoplasty in humans. The acute hypertensive response could be only partially blocked by prostaglandin inhibitors and we believe that prostaglandins are not primarily responsible for this effect. Medications known to lower intraocular pressure were systematically tested in both glaucoma models.", 
    "50": "Beta blockers are now widely used to treat hypertension during pregnancy. The authors give their experience of 24 cases with Labetalol which is an alpha and beta blocker. A comparative study of the results obtained in mother and child, with other publications using beta-blockers or Labetalol, was carried out.", 
    "51": "Treatment of 23 hypertensive patients with labetalol at 200 mg twice daily for 3 months resulted in a 15-17% reduction in diastolic and systolic blood pressure, a significant amelioration in the PEP/LVET ratio expressing the haemodynamic performance of the left ventricle, and a significant reduction in its hypertrophy as expressed by the Romhilt-Estes index.", 
    "52": "The reflex effects induced by carotid sinus stimulation were studied in 23 subjects before and after oral administration of 200 mg metoprolol. Eight patients had sustained hypertension, eight had normal blood pressure. All patients had carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH). Seven normotensive subjects without carotid sinus hypersensitivity constituted the control group. Two hours after intake of metoprolol the baroreflex induced sinus node inhibition and blood pressure lowering effect proved to be greater, in all groups of subjects, than before taking the drug, however, in the group of carotid sinus hypersensitive patients with high blood pressure only the parameters relating to heart rate showed significant differences. In a comparison of the effects of the metoprolol on the parameters induced by carotid stimulation, significant increases could be seen in both CSH groups compared to the data found in the control group. The reflex induced fall in blood pressure and the time needed for the return to the prestimulating level showed a significantly greater augmentation in the normotensive, than in the hypertensive CSH patients.", 
    "53": "Propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, was administered to 6 healthy pregnant volunteers between 32 and 36 weeks gestation and when at least 6 weeks postpartum. On both occasions, subjects were given propranolol 120 mg orally or 10 mg intravenously in randomised order with a minimum washout period of 1 week. Propranolol was assayed in plasma by gas-liquid chromatography with electron-capture detection and the pharmacokinetic parameters were investigated. There were no significant alterations in elimination half-life, clearance or apparent volume of distribution per kilogram antenatally compared with postnatally: bioavailability was also unchanged. It is concluded that the disposition of propranolol is not altered during pregnancy.", 
    "54": "Five patients with a creatinine clearance of 14 to 37 ml/min/1.73 m2 were each given an oral dose of 10 mg of the beta-blocker mepindolol sulphate (Corindolan). In addition, two dialysis patients received the same dose either during hemodialysis or on a dialysis-free day. Plasma levels of mepindolol were measured by a sensitive, specific HPLC method. Mepindolol was rapidly absorbed in all the patients. The maximum plasma level of 35 +/- 8 ng/ml was reached after 1.4 +/- 0.5 h. The half-life of disposition was 4.0 +/- 1.5 h. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve was 237 +/- 84 ng X h/ml. The data obtained were no different from those found in normal healthy volunteers.", 
    "55": "U 46619 (11,9-epoxymethano-PGH2) appears to be a selective and stable thromboxane-like agonist. In isolated preparations the substance (3.10(-9) - 3.10(-6) mol/l) induced an increase of cardiac performance of auricles and a decrease of contraction force and coronary flow of perfused hearts of guinea pigs. Intravenous infusion of U 46619 (10 micrograms/kg/min) to rabbits caused a marked reduction of heart contractility and blood pressure and the death of the animals within 10 minutes. Antianginal drugs, especially dipyridamole, propranolol, trapidil and verapamil, significantly reduced the TXA2 agonistic effects in auricles and anesthetized rabbits. The results indicate that some antianginal drugs inhibit TXA2 effects in the cardiocirculatory system. This may be regarded as an important factor for the therapeutic use of these substances.", 
    "56": "The relationship between the effect of propranolol treatment on oxygen consumption during exercise and the activity of the sympathoadrenal system (SAS) and the initial hemodynamic circulatory type was established in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). In patients with the hyper- and eukinetic circulatory types, propranolol caused an increase in the maximal oxygen consumption (MOC), pointing to the improvement of the functional possibilities of the cardiovascular system during exercise, with this improvement being more marked in patients with the hyperkinetic type. This effect of propranolol in the latter group patients was coupled with a reduction in the transmitter activity of the SAS. In patients with the hypokinetic circulatory type, propranolol did not produce any substantial change in the MOC, modifying the conditions of exercise performance toward anaerobic process without exerting any effect on the SAS.", 
    "57": "Exercise tests were applied in 59 patients with coronary heart disease and angina pectoris of effort to screen the effective antianginal doses of inderal, anapriline and obsidan. The mean effective single dose of inderal was established to constitute 80 mg (from 40 to 200 mg). In the course of screening the effective antianginal doses of beta-adrenoblockers, it was demonstrated that one should not be guided by the negative chronotropic effect of the drugs, since it was of low informative value. As regards the intensity and duration of the antianginal effects, they were alike both after propranolol treatment given in a single dose and in courses. During individual screening of the effective antianginal doses of the drugs under comparison, no differences were found in the effects of inderal, anapriline and obsidan on the exercise tolerance, although some of the patients responded to higher doses of anapriline as compared to inderal. The drugs were established to exert a comparatively short-term antianginal action. In view of this fact it is desirable to administer the drugs four times a day in the majority of cases.", 
    "58": "The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of vigilance caused by beta-blockers. A recently developed method to measure the vigilance fluctuations, based on the EEG spectra, was employed together with self-rating. Repeated vigilance measurements were made in 20 healthy volunteers before and after administration of placebo, propranolol and metoprolol in random sequence. Both EEG analysis and self-rating confirmed that the vigilance level was significantly decreased after administration of beta-blockers compared to placebo. No significant difference between propranolol and metoprolol could be found. The results suggest that the decrease in systolic blood pressure after beta-blockade may be responsible for the drug-induced drowsiness. However, some of the observations made in the study can be interpreted as indirect proof that central mechanisms are also involved, and that both propranolol and metoprolol have sedative properties comparable to those observed with conventional psychotropic drugs.", 
    "59": "A rise in free fatty acids (FFA) and a concomitant decrease in serum magnesium levels were found soon after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a group of 5 patients. Magnesium and FFA returned to normal levels within 3 days. No changes in serum FFA and magnesium levels were found in the postinfarction period in 5 patients who were under treatment with propranolol during the time they developed AMI. The linear model, magnesium = f(time, FFA), was investigated according to the stepwise regression-forward selection system. It was found that the magnesium level in AMI is best predicted by the FFA level (inverse correlation). In the period of 0-72 h after infarction, an inverse linear correlation was found to exist between the FFA level and the period of time after infarction.", 
    "60": "In a climatic exposure chamber four healthy volunteers were exposed to 100ppm toluene, 100ppm toluene + ethanol, 100ppm toluene + cimetidine, and 100ppm toluene + propranolol for 7h each at random over four consecutive days. A control experiment and 3.5h of exposure to 200ppm toluene were also performed. Ethanol inhibited toluene metabolism by 0.5 as expressed by the urinary excretion of two of the metabolites of toluene, namely o-cresol and hippuric acid. In agreement with this, the mean alveolar concentration of toluene was greater by 1.7 during ethanol exposure; 45 min after discontinuation of exposure the increase was by 3.3. Neither cimetidine nor propranolol changed toluene metabolism significantly. The results indicate that ethanol may prolong the time interval in which toluene is retained in the human body in persons simultaneously exposed to ethanol and toluene. When using o-cresol or hippuric acid in biological monitoring of persons occupationally exposed to toluene, the consumption of ethanol should be considered.", 
    "61": "The present report describes a mother and 2 children with leucine-induced hypoglycemia (LIH). Hypoglycemic episodes following high-protein meals first appeared at age 4-7 months. Leucine-stimulation tests triggered marked hyperinsulinism and hypoglycemia in the children and a milder but abnormal response in the mother. To evaluate the therapeutic effects and to study the mechanism of hyperinsulinism in LIH, the leucine test was repeated under treatment with diphenylhydantoin, oxprenolol (a beta-blocker), and diazoxide. Diazoxide abolished hyperinsulinism; diphenylhydantoin did not affect the response to leucine; and oxprenolol, tested in the mother only, increased hyperinsulinism and hypoglycemia. Our results indicate that LIH is an autosomal dominant disorder; LIH may persist into adulthood with milder clinical symptoms and chemical response to leucine; diazoxide is the treatment of choice in LIH. Considering the effects of the three agents on stimulated release of insulin, it is concluded that leucine triggers hyperinsulinism by a mechanism different from that of glucose and beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "62": "Decreased elimination of a combined formulation of Sotalol (160 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) was found in patients with moderate renal insufficiency. Very slight accumulation of sotalol and hydrochlorothiazide was observed, so it appears unnecessary to reduce the dosage in patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 ml/min or more.", 
    "63": "A new vasodilator drug, pinacidil, N'-cyano-N-4-pyridyl-N'-1, 2,2-trimethylpropylguanidine, was studied in an open trial in 15 patients with moderate to severe hypertension. Four patients received pinacidil monotherapy, and in 11 patients it was used with a diuretic or a beta-blocker. In all but one patient normotension was achieved with a mean daily pinacidil dose of 46.7 mg b.i.d. (range 20-100 mg). Side effects were few and were action-related. There was no evidence of early toxicity. Pinacidil is a promising new antihypertensive vasodilator, which deserves further clinical evaluation.", 
    "64": "The effects of penbutolol (40 mg), atenolol (100 mg) and sustained-release metoprolol (metoprolol SA) (200 mg) upon heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) at rest and during bicycle ergometer exercise, have been compared in 12 healthy young men using a double-blind crossover design. Measurements of each drug's effect were made before and at 3, 10 and 24 h after a single dose, and again at 24 h after the last of seven consecutive daily doses. Resting HR and systolic BP were reduced to an equivalent extent by all three drugs. During the third minute of exercise, the effects of penbutolol and atenolol upon HR and systolic BP were consistently similar and greater than those of metoprolol SA.", 
    "65": "An open study was carried out in general practice to assess the efficacy and tolerance of a fixed ratio combination of hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg), amiloride (2.5 mg) and timolol (10 mg) in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension, and to determine if there were any differences in response when medication was taken before or after food. A total of 663 patients was studied and received 1 to 2 tablets once daily for a period of 12 weeks; 322 patients took their medication before and 341 after food. The results showed that there were similar significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and in heart rate in both groups, over half of the patients being controlled (less than 90 mmHg diastolic) after 2 weeks and 80% by the end of the study period. Relatively few adverse effects were reported and the incidence during treatment was less than that recorded on entry to the study. There was no evidence to suggest that the timing of drug intake in relation to food had any effect on the efficacy or tolerance of the combination.", 
    "66": "In patients with angina of effort, the changes of the central hemodynamic indices were estimated after oral administration of effective antianginal doses of propranolol and the cardioselective beta-blocker atenolol, which had been individually selected. Atenolol maximum effects on the hemodynamics were somewhat superior to those of propranolol. At the same time, the degree of hemodynamic changes did not correlate with their antianginal action. The effect of atenolol on the total peripheral vascular resistance was not higher as compared to that of propranolol.", 
    "67": "Perfusion of the aorta of anesthesized rabbits with medium 199 containing adrenaline at a concentration of 10(-6)-10(-4) M results in multiple morphological damages of the endothelial lining: contraction of endotheliocytes with the dilation of intercellular borders, appearance of areas of swelling (from a diffuse edema of single cells up to massive swelling of several hundred cells). The surface of the deendothelized aorta was greater at the highest dose of adrenaline. Inclusion into the perfusate of adrenaline blockers, such as phentolamine and propranolol at a concentration of 10(-5) M prevented endothelial constriction and edema. Similar focal swelling in the intima of aorta and coronary arteries was found in children dying from grave stress (trauma, asphyxia). The data obtained indicate that adrenaline after its therapeutic intravenous or local use may exert a direct damaging effect on the vascular endothelium.", 
    "68": "Using the glass microelectrode technique we measured the effect of adrenaline (ADR, 10(-5) mol . l-1) and acetylcholine (ACh, 10(-5) mol . l-1) on action potentials (AP) of the ventricular myocardium of 8- to 11-week-old human embryos. ACh prolonged the AP (by 20%), without affecting voltage of the plateau phase. ADR markedly elevated the plateau phase (by 8 mV) and prolonged the AP (by up to 40% of the initial duration). The ACh effect attained the maximum in 5-7 min and was frequency dependent. The ADR effect reached the maximum in 1-2 min. Neither ACh nor ADR affected the resting membrane potential value. The effect of ACh was blocked by atropine (10(-6) mol . l-1), showing that it is mediated by way of M-receptors. Propranolol (6.10(-6) mol . l-1) only partly blocked the effects of ADR. The results show that the human ventricular myocardium is already sensitive to the action of ACh and ADR before autonomic innervation of the heart develops.", 
    "69": "An open, multi-centre study was carried out in general practice to compare the efficacy and tolerance of antihypertensive therapy with once-daily and twice-daily dosage of a fixed ratio combination of hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg), amiloride (2.5 mg) and timolol (10 mg). A total of 604 patients with mild to moderate hypertension were treated over a period of 12 weeks with either 1 to 2 tablets once-daily (294 patients) or 1/2 to 1 tablet twice-daily (310 patients). The results showed that there was a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures in both groups after only 2-weeks' therapy and the overall reduction after 12 weeks was 31/19 mmHg, with 57% of patients being adequately controlled on the equivalent of 1 tablet per day, whether taken once daily or in divided doses. Forty-six (8%) patients withdrew from the study because of drug-related symptoms, mainly central nervous system in origin. Overall, treatment with either regimen was considered suitable and acceptable by over 80% of patients and doctors.", 
    "70": "Propranolol, timolol and sotalol were compared regarding their cardiotoxic properties in isolated, perfused and catecholamine depleted rat hearts. Catecholamine depletion was performed in order to exclude interference of the drugs with beta-adrenergic receptors. The results demonstrate that both in spontaneously beating and atrial- stimulated hearts propranolol (3 - 30 micrograms/ml) and timolol (30 - 300 micrograms/ml) induced a dose dependent decrease in myocardial contractility, stimulus formation and stimulus conduction. Lacking local anesthetic properties as evidenced by effects on coronary flow and threshold voltage in the heart it can be deduced that the negative inotropic effect and an impaired stimulus conduction due to timolol can neither attributed to beta-adrenoceptor antagonism nor membrane stabilising activity. In addition, both propranolol (5 micrograms/ml) and timolol (200 micrograms/ml) reduced myocardial contractility to the same extent in ventricular-paced hearts. Therefore, a direct myocardial depressive effect rather than an indirect effect due to a reduced heart rate must be responsible for the negative inotropy. The hydrophilic beta-blocker sotalol demonstrated a slight cardiodepressant activity either in the spontaneously beating and atrial-stimulated hearts (30 - 300 micrograms/ml) or ventricular-paced hearts (300 micrograms/ml). It is concluded that the toxicological profile of various beta-blocking drugs might be determined by an yet unknown pharmacological property apart from beta-adrenoceptor blockade or membrane stabilising activity. Furthermore, the degree of lipophilicity of the drug might be an important determinant for the cardiotoxic profile of this class of drugs.", 
    "71": "Previous pharmacologic studies have shown that the adrenergic system has a definite role in urinary continence. For this reason sympathomimetic agents have been used to treat stress urinary incontinence. Similarly, beta adrenoceptors blockade has been shown to be of value in achieving continence in a small group of patients. This study presents the successful results of using a beta blocker (Propranolol) in the treatment of 23 female patients suffering from stress urinary incontinence. The enhanced urodynamic response shown, particularly in the erect position, to this drug could be due to the unopposed effect of alpha adrenoceptors following beta adrenoceptors blockade, thus suggesting the presence of significant numbers of such beta adrenoceptors in the female bladder outlet and proximal urethra.", 
    "72": "Propranolol levels in plasma were studied in relation to dose prescribed in order to assess poor compliance with antihypertensive treatment. Fifty consecutive ambulatory patients (36-81 years) having hypertension, including 19 with azotemia, were investigated. Patient interviews using questionnaires and chart reviews were used to evaluate compliance. A composite Compliance Index was calculated for each patient. Individual oral doses of propranolol ranged from 20 to 160 mg. Subsequent plasma levels were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Good correlation between last oral dose (mg) per body weight (kg) and log plasma propranolol levels were observed in patients whose compliance indices were above the mean for this sample (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01), when blood pressure control was satisfactory (r = 0.66) or excellent (r = 0.78), and when serum creatinines were greater than or equal to 1.4 (r = 0.76, p less than 0.001). Poor correlations between dose and propranolol levels suggest poor compliance with treatment.", 
    "73": "The authors conducted a clinical investigation in twenty-five patients affected with essential hypertension of mild or moderate grade associated with type II diabetes mellitus, the purpose being to assess the effect of 8 weeks of combined treatment with atenolol (100 mg) and chlorthalidone (25 mg) on arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and glycaemia. It is, indeed, generally known that both beta-blockade agents and diuretics can interfere with carbohydrate metabolism. The results indicate that 92% of the patients treated in this trial had significant reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings, in the absence of bradycardia or other adverse effects. Glycaemia values were lower at the end of treatment, probably as a result of better diet control during the trial, as suggested by the general tendency to body-weight reduction.", 
    "74": "The effect of long-term treatment on the absorption and disposition of metoprolol has been evaluated in 8 healthy, non-smoking, elderly individuals (mean age 74.5 years) and in a control group of 8 healthy, young individuals. Two trace doses of [3H]metoprolol were given i.v., first concomitantly with a single oral 50 mg dose of cold metoprolol, and second, with the morning dose after 2 weeks of treatment with 50 mg b.d. In the elderly, the mean AUC increased by about 45% (p less than 0.05) over the treatment period, while in the control group the mean AUC was 18% greater (p less than 0.05) on Day 14 than on Day 1. In the elderly, changes both in pre-systemic elimination and in total body clearance accounted for the elevation of the AUC, whereas reduced first-pass effect appeared to be the major cause of the increased steady-state plasma level in the control group. With the exception of the volume term, V beta, the pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different between the elderly and the young individuals. For this reason, almost identical steady-state plasma levels were attained in the two groups. The results suggest that age-related physiological changes may have some minor effects on the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol, and also that the changes do not lead to significantly altered plasma concentrations compared to those in young individuals.", 
    "75": "Studies were conducted to determine the mechanism whereby ethanol alters the hepatic disposition of propranolol. In eight isolated perfused rat livers, ethanol (mean = 40.1 mmol/l diminished the clearance of dl-propranolol (1.93 +/- 0.43 to 1.24 +/- 0.22 ml/min/g liver, p less than 0.05); increased its t1/2 (12.8 +/- 1.5 to 20.7 +/- 3.25 min, p less than 0.01); and decreased the proportion metabolized (68.7 +/- 4.7% to 34.3 +/- 10.3%, p less than 0.01). These results suggest that ethanol could substantially increase the oral bioavailability of propranolol in humans. However, in normal human volunteers administered 80 mg of propranolol orally, alone, or preceded and followed by ethanol to maintain breath ethanol concentrations of 800-1000 mg/l, increases in propranolol AUC were smaller than anticipated. Seven subjects had increases in free propranolol AUC0-8h (32%, range: 12-61%) (p less than 0.05), while total propranolol AUC0-8h increased by a mean 22% (range: -4-+49%). Propranolol free fraction varied with time and was higher after ethanol (mean = 0.090 vs 0.084) (p less than 0.077). The extent of the propranolol-induced slowing of heart rate was not influenced by ethanol (mean decrease from baseline of 13 bpm at peak propranolol effect vs 9 bpm without ethanol); mean heart rates following propranolol with ethanol were higher at all times (mean of 7.5 bpm) (p less than 0.001) than after propranolol alone. Ethanol inhibits the hepatic oxidative metabolism of propranolol in vitro; however, any effect on heart rate of higher concentrations of propranolol induced by ethanol in humans is offset by the cardio-acceleratory effect of ethanol.", 
    "76": "Single smooth muscle cells from bovine coronary artery were obtained by enzymatic digestion. 20.1 +/- 3.2% (mean value of seven experiments) of the dispersed cells were in a relaxed, noncontracted state. These cells responded to electrically induced depolarization with a graded contraction to a maximum shortening of 47.8% of initial length; the corresponding maximum for K+-induced depolarization was 61.7% of initial length. Cells relaxed only a small percentage (approximately equal to 20%) of the amount of shortening, but could be restimulated several times to contract to even shorter lengths. The decrease in mean cell length of dispersed cells exposed to serotonin, acetylcholine, and ergonovine maleate was 21.0, 23.0 and 25.5%, respectively (p less than 0.05). No significant decrease in cell length was obtained with norepinephrine. The ultrastructure of the relaxed cells seemed to be unaltered, suggesting that the accuracy of the physiological results is not impaired by induced structural damage.", 
    "77": "The effect of timolol on blood platelet function was studied in coronary sinus and caval vein blood at rest and during pacing-induced angina in 20 patients with coronary heart disease. During pacing-induced angina, lactate measurements confirmed that coronary sinus blood was sampled from ischemic regions in 13 men. The ischemia did not influence platelet function. In blood from non-ischemic myocardium, platelet activation was found during pacing: the ADP-induced aggregation, platelet retention and plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels increased moderately but significantly. Timolol administration prevented this platelet activation, possibly by inhibiting catecholamine release from the myocardium, and reduced the ischemic response during pacing as judged from lactate measurements and ST depressions. It is concluded that timolol reduced platelet activation induced in non-ischemic regions of the heart during tachycardia stress as well as myocardial ischemia.", 
    "78": "The beta-blocker DL-1-(2-nitro-3-methyl-phenoxy)-3-tert-butylaminopropan-2-ol (ZAMI 1305), oncogenic to the liver of the female but not of the male Wistar rat, was used to investigate some aspects of the relationship between liver and thyroid during chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. Thyroidectomy (TDX) strongly reduces the amount of hepatic DNA damage induced by a single administration of ZAMI 1305 in the female Wistar rat. One week of treatment with triiodothyronine (T3) completely restores the susceptibility of the liver of thyroidectomized animals to the genotoxic activity of the molecule. The amount of hepatic DNA damage in intact females varies with the age of the animal, being maximal in rats of 4-8 weeks of age, when T3 serum concentration are also maximal. An increase of relative thyroid weight, coupled with histological hyperplasia of the gland, is observed in female Wistar rats treated for 6 months with ZAMI 1305. Minimal changes of the thyroid are observed in ZAMI 1305-treated male rats. The increase of relative thyroid weight in female rats appears to be related to the severity of preneoplastic and neoplastic liver changes. These findings and several suggestions from the literature lead us to propose a model for the interaction between liver and thyroid during chemical hepatocarcinogenesis."
