    "0": "The effects of selective blockade of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors on the vasoconstrictor responses to epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NOR) were compared in perfused/superfused proximal and distal segments of rat tail artery. The influence of neuronal uptake and of activation of beta adrenoceptors was also investigated. EPI was more potent in distal than in proximal segments. The antagonistic effect of idazoxan (100 nM) against EPI was greater in distal than in proximal segments, whereas the opposite result was obtained with prazosin (0.1-10 nM). No such difference were observed when NOR was used as agonist. Reducing the calcium ion concentration had a greater inhibitory effect on EPI in distal than in proximal segments. Cocaine (4 microM) increased responses to EPI and NOR to a greater extent in proximal than in distal segments. In the presence of cocaine, in proximal segments, antagonism of EPI by prazosin was reduced, whereas in distal segments, antagonism by idazoxan and the inhibitory effect of a reduction in calcium ion concentration were reduced. Propranolol (1 microM) increased responses to EPI and NOR to a greater extent in proximal than in distal segments. In the presence of propranolol, antagonism of EPI by both prazosin and idazoxan was reduced in proximal segments, and the inhibitory effect of a reduction in calcium ion concentration was lost. Forskolin (1 microM) inhibited responses to EPI and prevented the antagonistic effect of idazoxan, but not that of prazosin. From the results obtained it is suggested that smooth muscle alpha-2 adrenoceptors are distributed differently in the proximal and distal ends of the rat tail artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "The mechanisms of inhibitory effects of dopamine on the vagally stimulated gastric acid secretion and mucosal blood flow (MBF) were studied in anesthetized rats with a gastric fistula. Intravenous infusion of dopamine significantly reduced both gastric acid secretion and MBF. The inhibitory effect of dopamine on the vagally stimulated gastric acid secretion was not attenuated by sulpiride, metoclopramide or domperidone. Haloperidol abolished the inhibitory effect of dopamine on the acid secretion; it also abolished the inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on the vagally stimulated acid secretion. The inhibitory effect of dopamine on the acid secretion was abolished by phentolamine and yohimbine but not by propranolol or prazosin. Dopamine-induced reduction in the vagally stimulated gastric MBF was abolished by haloperidol and was partially antagonized by sulpiride or metoclopramide. In addition, the dopamine-induced reduction in the MBF was abolished by phentolamine and prazosin and was partially antagonized by yohimbine. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of dopamine on the vagally stimulated gastric acid secretion is mediated by alpha-2 adrenoceptor mechanisms and that the inhibitory effect of dopamine on the MBF is, at least in part, mediated by alpha-1 adrenoceptor mechanisms. The authors did not obtain evidence for the existence of dopamine receptor-mediated mechanisms.", 
    "2": "Timolol iontophoresis into the eye can induce herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) shedding in rabbits latently infected with HSV-1 strain McKrae. Anodal iontophoresis of 0.01% timolol was done at 0.8 mAmp for 8 min once a day for 3 consecutive days. Viral shedding was determined by the presence of HSV-1 in the preocular tear film obtained by eye swabs. In two experiments, iontophoresis of 0.01% timolol resulted in all eyes (18/18) shedding HSV-1 for an average duration of 4.3 days. When 5.0% timolol was applied topically to rabbit eyes supersensitized by iontophoresis of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-HD), all eyes (10/10) shed virus for an average duration of 2.9 days. All eyes (12/12) receiving iontophoresis of 6-HD, pre- and posttreatment with topical application of 5.0% timolol, and posttreatment with topical application of 1.0% epinephrine shed virus for an average duration of 3.6 days. Eyes treated with topical application of 5.0% timolol alone showed no difference in HSV-1 ocular shedding, compared with untreated eyes. We concluded that both iontophoresis of 0.01% timolol and topical application of 5.0% timolol to adrenergically supersensitized eyes induced HSV-1 shedding reliably and with a high frequency, and that topically applied timolol does not block the HSV-1 ocular shedding induced by epinephrine in adrenergically supersensitized eyes.", 
    "3": "The present study examined the effect of topical timolol, a nonspecific beta 1 and beta 2 blocker on reactivation and ocular shedding of latent HSV-1 in an improved mouse iontophoresis model. Latent trigeminal ganglionic infection was established in Balb/C mice following inoculation by corneal scarification with HSV-1 W strain, a clinical isolate, and confirmed by co-cultivation. On day 30, postinfection (pi), the mice were divided into two groups, and treatment begun with coded eye drops (timolol 0.5% or placebo) BID OU for 5 days. On day 31 pi, iontophoresis with 1% 6-hydroxydopamine was performed, and daily treatment with topical epinephrine and 1% prednisolone was administered. Reactivation and recovery of latent HSV-1 was determined by daily ocular swabs, and characteristic HSV-1 cytopathic effect in Vero cells. Results demonstrated that the timolol-treated group had a significantly greater number of positive eyes, multiple shedding episodes, and total shedding days compared to the control group. We conclude that beta blockade promotes recurrent ocular shedding induced by epinephrine in the mouse iontophoresis latency model.", 
    "4": "beta-Adrenergic receptors from the iris-ciliary body of human eyes removed shortly after death were studied using membranes prepared by isopycnic centrifugation of tissue homogenates. This procedure separates uveal melanin pigment from plasma membranes and reduces nonspecific binding of 125I-iodopindolol. The observed binding of 125I-iodopindolol was of high affinity (Kd = 78 +/- 6.6 pM), saturable, and fully reversible (t1/2 = 4.6 min). Scatchard plots were linear and revealed a Bmax of 134 +/- 20 fmol/mg of protein from the whole iris-ciliary body. The affinities of the receptors for a series of agonists and antagonists were determined. The order of potency for the inhibition of the binding of the radioligand by antagonists was ICI 118,551 greater than MK950 greater than propranolol greater than ICI 89,406 greater than metoprolol. This order of potency is characteristic of beta-adrenergic receptors of the beta 2 subtype. Preparations of iris-ciliary body were also subjected to microdissection prior to density gradient centrifugation to permit the study of beta-adrenergic receptors in the ciliary processes, ciliary body, and iris. Each of these regions was found to contain approximately one third of the total number of beta-adrenergic receptors in the human iris-ciliary body. The highest density of receptors was located in the ciliary processes (180 +/- 40 fmol/mg of protein), while the density of receptors in the iris (98 +/- 7.5 fmol/mg of protein) and ciliary body (less the processes) (42 +/- 17 fmol/mg of protein) was notably lower. Only beta 2-adrenergic receptors are detectable by competition experiments in the iris-ciliary body as a whole, or in the individual preparations of iris, ciliary processes, or ciliary body; however, microdissection and analysis of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in isolated ciliary muscle permitted detection of a small number of beta 1-adrenergic receptors. beta 1-Adrenergic receptors comprised about 10% of the total number of beta-adrenergic receptors in the whole iris-ciliary body. The finding that most of the beta-adrenergic receptors in the human iris-ciliary body are of the beta 2 subtype may be of significant therapeutic importance in the medical management of glaucoma.", 
    "5": "The aim of the present work is to investigate a possible interaction on glucagon secretion between adenosine, a compound released by tissues in energy-deficient states, and epinephrine, the hormone of stress largely implicated in such conditions. The study was performed using the isolated perfused rat pancreas in presence of a physiological glucose concentration (5 mM). Epinephrine administered at a low concentration (0.01 microM) was ineffective on glucagon secretion, and adenosine at 1.65 microM was previously shown to be moderately stimulating. This nucleoside alone induced a transient increase of glucagon secretion rate that peaked at 300% of basal value at 2 min; in presence of epinephrine (ineffective per se) the rise induced by the nucleoside alone was doubled. This potentiating effect was not observed with the neurotransmitter norepinephrine at the dose tested. Propranolol (1 microM) did not alter the potentiating effect of epinephrine but this effect was completely suppressed by the alpha-blocker, phenoxybenzamine (6 microM). In conclusion epinephrine potentiates an adenosine-stimulating effect on glucagon secretion; this effect seems more specific for the adrenal medulla hormone epinephrine, since norepinephrine at the same dose is ineffective; it is mediated via alpha-adrenergic receptors. It is attractive to speculate that epinephrine and adenosine act in potentiating synergism on glucagon secretion; this might be of physiological importance during stressful energy-deficient situations.", 
    "6": "Epinephrine (E), isoproterenol (I), and dopamine (D) were compared with norepinephrine (N) for production of microthrombi during thrombin-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in rabbits. Only catecholamines acting on alpha-adrenoreceptors produced glomerular capillary thrombosis (GCT) typical of the generalized Shwartzman reaction (GSR). Epinephrine produced GCT three times (P less than 0.05) less severe than that produced by N, but beta-blockade with propranolol (P) rendered E equal to N in potency. I and D reduced fibrinogen consumption produced by thrombin. I (0.5-0.66 microgram/kg/min), as opposed to D, prevented the GSR produced by endotoxin in the pregnant rat and the cortisone-sensitized rabbit, and P increased the severity of the GSR in the pregnant rat. Alpha-adrenergic blockade with dibenzyline prevented the GSR produced by endotoxin in rats, whether pregnant, diabetic, or having a unilateral ureteral occlusion, and the classic reaction in rabbits, but not that produced in renal-hypertensive rats. Simultaneous alpha + beta stimulations by E triggered coronary and hepatic microthrombi, which were prevented by P. It is concluded that beta-adrenergic stimulation, as opposed to D-adrenergic stimulation, counterbalances alpha-adrenergic effects occurring in endotoxemia, which are required for production of the GSR in most models. These studies stress the risks and benefits of beta-blockade and provide additional evidence for the role of vasoactive agents and microcirculatory changes on selection of target organs for production of microthrombi during DIC.", 
    "7": "Ethylnitrosourea-induced pulmonary adenomas of the mouse have been reported as being predominantly Clara cell in origin. The response of these tumor cells in vivo to the secretory agonist, isoproterenol (10 mg/kg) and the antagonist, propranolol (2.0 mg/kg) 1 hour after intraperitoneal injection into 120-day-old tumor-bearing mice was examined. Ultrastructural morphometry was used to quantitate the secretory response of tumor cells by measuring the volume density of the secretory granules. In the intact animal, isoproterenol stimulated secretion in the Clara cell adenomas (40% decrease in volume density with no change in surface to volume ratio of granules), while propranolol prevented this effect. In addition, beta-adrenergic receptors on isolated tumor cells were demonstrated by radioligand-binding assay by using [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). Scatchard analysis of data derived from whole cells indicates a maximum receptor-binding capacity of 27 fmoles/mg of protein and a KD of 0.029 nM. Isoproterenol displacement of ICYP binding yields an IC50 of 8 X 10(-7) M and a calculated KD of 3.36 X 10(-7) M. The beta 2 identity of these receptors was determined by utilizing the relatively specific beta 1 and beta 2 antagonists practolol and ICI-118,551, respectively. Practolol failed to displace more than 30% of ICYP binding even at 100 microM, while ICI-118,551 displacement of ICYP yielded a linear Hofstee plot (r = 0.93) and a KD of 5.04 X 10(-9) M. These findings suggest that the secretory activity of Clara cell-like pulmonary adenomas is under beta-adrenergic control similar to that of normal bronchiolar Clara cells.", 
    "8": "Controversy exists concerning whether receptor down-regulation is involved in the efficacy of antidepressants. Many investigators believe that norepinephrine (NE) receptor down-regulation is more important than serotonin (5-HT) receptor down-regulation. The ability to accurately determine which receptor types or subtypes have been down-regulated has been impaired by the lack of sufficiently specific ligands for labeling these receptor subtypes. Studies that have attempted to examine 5-HT2 receptor down-regulation have used [3H]-ketanserin as the ligand of choice to label 5-HT2 receptors, but this ligand also labels a nondescript site. The binding of [3H]-ketanserin to sites other than 5-HT2 receptors can be examined and controlled for by autoradiographic techniques. The authors briefly review potential problems involved in analyzing receptor binding after antidepressant treatment and present new findings of receptor alterations in rat brain as examined by autoradiographic techniques following chronic exposure to fluoxetine (a selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor that has been shown to be an effective antidepressant). Laboratory animals injected with fluoxetine showed receptor down-regulation (reduced density) in the serotonergic system. A provocative and potentially important finding of this study is that this selective 5-HT uptake blocker also down-regulates beta-adrenergic receptors in the CNS.", 
    "9": "Twenty-five of thirty NIDDS who remained hypertensive (diastolic greater than 95 mmHg supine) after 4 weeks on bendrofluazide 2.5 mg daily (B), completed a single-blind, observer-blind randomized crossover study, in which the additional use of atenolol (50 mg daily) (A), slow-release nifedipine (20 mg twice daily) (N), and captopril (25 mg twice daily) (C) was compared. Patients took each drug for 8 weeks with dose doubling at 4 weeks if supine diastolic remained greater than 90 mmHg. All three combinations were more effective than bendrofluazide alone (p less than 0.01). In nine patients studied 2 h after tablets at the end of each treatment period nifedipine was more effective than the other two drugs (B:174/104 mmHg, A:162/95 mmHg, -8%, N:141/88 mmHg, -17%, C:157/94 mmHg, -10%, supine), whereas in 16 patients studied 15 h after their evening dose there was no significant difference. Fasting insulin and HbA1 levels were not significantly different between groups. No drug had a significant adverse effect on creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, overnight urinary albumin excretion or foot transcutaneous oxygen levels (43 degrees C). All three drugs studied were effective without deleterious effects on renal function or peripheral blood flow.", 
    "10": "A new calcium channel blocker, nicardipine, was studied for treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial during the winter months. Clinical response was assessed by a patient-kept diary of symptoms and finger systolic pressure that was measured at room temperature and during cold challenge. In vivo platelet activation was determined by measuring plasma levels of the platelet-specific proteins, beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4. When treatment with placebo was compared with treatment with nicardipine, no significant differences were found in the number of Raynaud's attacks per day, the severity of attacks, change in character in Raynaud's phenomenon, use of hands in winter months, patient assessment of medication or objective measurements of finger systolic pressure, and critical closing temperature. There was a reduction of plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 in the overall study group while taking nicardipine compared with that during the placebo period (mean change 5.0 +/- 2.4 ng/ml, P = 0.054, and 1.4 +/- 0.6 ng/ml, P less than 0.01, respectively). These results demonstrate that while nicardipine was not effective in reducing the episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon, it did inhibit in vivo platelet activation. These findings suggest that platelet activation is not the primary event in the pathogenesis of acute vasospasm in Raynaud's phenomenon, since reduction of platelet activation by the drug did not change the severity of vasospasm.", 
    "11": "In conscious, chronically cannulated, unrestrained rats, systemic administration of catecholamines increases the plasma levels of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta Ei). In euthyroid rats, this effect is mediated by both alpha 1 and beta-adrenergic receptors; the rise in plasma beta Ei caused by isoproterenol is blocked by 1 mg/kg propranolol, and the similar effects of norepinephrine and phenylephrine are blocked by 0.1 mg/kg prazosin. Both types of responses are completely suppressed by a 4-h pretreatment of rats with 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone, indicating the anterior pituitary origin of the beta Ei released. Prior sectioning of the pituitary stalk does not significantly reduce the response to either phenylephrine or isoproterenol, suggesting that both agents act directly on the pituitary. Hypothyroidism induced by surgical thyroidectomy does not influence the beta Ei response to isoproterenol, which remains sensitive to block by propranolol or suppression by dexamethasone. However, neither norepinephrine nor phenylephrine is able to increase plasma beta Ei in the hypothyroid animals. Both isoproterenol and phenylephrine remain fully effective in rats made hyperthyroid by daily injections of 40 micrograms/kg T3 for 4 days. We propose that in unstressed rats catecholamines increase plasma beta Ei by a direct action on the anterior pituitary via either alpha 1- or beta-adrenergic receptors, and that expression of the alpha 1-, but not the beta-adrenergic response is regulated by thyroid hormones.", 
    "12": "Beta-blockers were used to treat 20 patients (mean age 55 +/- 12 years) presenting with severe ventricular arrhythmia on chronic heart failure (NYHA stages II to IV; mean ejection fraction 29.7 +/- 7.8%) due to coronary disease (18 cases) or to cardiomyopathy (2 cases). Ventricular tachycardia sustained (7.6 +/- 6.3 attacks/patient) in 19 patients, unsustained in 18, monomorphous in 8 and polymorphous in 12, had been present for 12.4 +/- 18 months. In all but one hitherto untreated patient, the condition had failed to respond to amiodarone combined with a type Ia (19 patients) and type Ic (16 patients) antiarrhythmic drug. Short-term results were: 17 successes, 2 failures and 1 death due to cardiogenic shock. Fifteen patients were followed up for 14 +/- 6.7 months. Thirteen of them benefited from smaller doses of a formerly ineffective treatment; there was one failure, and one patient in whom the attacks of tachycardia, but not the numerous and polymorphous extrasystoles, were controlled by the beta-blockers suddenly died at night. The actuarial mortality rate was 11.4% as against an expected figure of 30% in such a high risk group. Although no significant changes in ejection fraction were observed, heart failure became worse in 8 patients, but it was compensated by diuretics and/or vasodilators. The effects of beta-blockers in resistant ventricular arrhythmia on heart failure suggest that an adrenergic factor is involved in the mechanism of arrhythmia. Provided treatment is progressive and its haemodynamic consequences carefully monitored, beta-blockade is well tolerated. Its effectiveness on severe arrhythmia and on mortality rate seems to confirm that it prevents sudden death by an anti-arrhythmic mechanism.", 
    "13": "Experiments were performed to investigate whether descending vasomotor neurones from the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVL) utilize adrenaline as a neurotransmitter. Electrical stimulation of the RVL caused marked, short lasting, reproducible increases in blood pressure and heart rate in anaesthetised atropine methylbromide-treated rats. These effects probably reflect activation of cell bodies rather than fibres of passage since injection of L-glutamate into the same area also produced tachycardia and vasopressor responses. The effects of RVL stimulation were unchanged after bilateral adrenalectomy but were markedly reduced by guanethidine (1 mg/kg, i.v.) suggesting that the tachycardia and vasopressor responses were mediated via increased sympathetic tone to the heart and vasculature. Pretreatment with the phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase (PNMT) inhibitor LY134046 (1 mg intracisternally, and 40 mg/kg i.p. daily for 1 day or 5 days) did not modify either the tachycardia or vasopressor response to stimulation of the RVL. Resting blood pressure and heart rate were also unchanged. Cardiac preganglionic sympathetic nerves supplying the heart arise from the C7-T2 region of the spinal cord. Phentolamine and propranolol were injected intrathecally (i.t.) in this region, in an attempt to block the spinal receptors at which any adrenaline, released locally during RVL stimulation, might be expected to act in order to elicit the characteristic tachycardia. Phentolamine (10 and 100 micrograms i.t.) and propranolol (1 microgram i.t.) did not modify the tachycardia but propranolol (10 and 100 micrograms i.t.) caused a dose-dependent reduction. These doses of propranolol (10 and 100 micrograms i.t.) also produced blockade of peripheral beta-adrenoreceptors. The failure of PNMT inhibition to modify the tachycardia or vasopressor response to RVL stimulation and the lack of effect of intrathecally injected alpha-and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists (at doses which do not exert peripheral effects) against the RVL stimulation-induced tachycardia suggests that adrenaline does not subserve a spinal neurotransmitter role, at the C7-T2 region.", 
    "14": "Despite the fact that the blood flow maintained during cardiopulmonary bypass is rather steady in the extracorporeal pump output, the arterial pressure under high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia quite often shows sinusoidal oscillations. In the present study the duration of an oscillatory cycle was on average 17.6 +/- 3.6 s, its amplitude 7.3 +/- 1.6 mm Hg and mean systemic arterial pressure 75 +/- 12 mm Hg. The oscillation is affected by the drugs used under bypass conditions. In our series of clinical observations the blood pressure oscillation disappeared under the influence of chlorpromazine, phentolamine, droperidol, and enflurane, and it disappeared or at least was distinctly attenuated under fentanyl, thiopental, diazepam, sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, acebutolol, and potassium chloride. Pancuronium, atropine and furosemide appeared to be practically ineffective. In spite of the fact that the drugs used affected several sites of the sympathetic efferent chain, the disappearance and attenuation of the oscillation were associated with a simultaneous decrease of blood pressure. Hence, it is suggested that the occurrence of the oscillations requires some level of peripheral vascular tone.", 
    "15": "In a graded model of the calcium paradox phenomenon (minimal and total) the presence of the beta-blocker propranolol (5 X 10(-6) M) in the perfusion media (10 min prior to, during and 5 min following calcium-free perfusion) had no effect upon tissue injury. Propranolol pretreatment (three days prior to the experiments) significantly reduced the myocardial enzyme release during calcium repletion in the minimal calcium paradox. The presence of the alpha 1-blocker prazosin (1 X 10(-7) M) in the perfusion media (10 min prior to, during and 5 min following calcium-free perfusion) afforded no protective effects. It is concluded that the release of endogenous catecholamines may not be an important factor contributing to myocardial injury in the calcium paradox, and that consequently beta- or alpha 1-adrenergic blockade has little if any protective properties in this form of myocardial injury.", 
    "16": "In the twenty years since beta-blockers were proposed for treatment of glaucoma, use of topical timolol has increased to account for 70% of all glaucoma medications used. The objective of this article is to review the \"newer\" beta-blockers, and to address the generalization that \"all ophthalmic beta-blockers are the same.\" The review concentrates on agents that have been studied as topical treatments for patients with elevated intraocular pressure. Sections on pharmacology and design of clinical trials are included to aid the ophthalmologist in evaluating the new drugs and published clinical reports. The major questions to consider in evaluating the therapeutic potential of a new beta-blocker for the treatment of glaucoma involve efficacy and safety: Is the drug as effective as timolol? Does it have a duration of action at least as long as timolol? Does it have ocular toxicity? Is it comfortable? What are its systemic effects?", 
    "17": "Pinealectomized (PX), sham-operated and non operated control rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.), once daily at 8.00 over five days, with: (a) 0.9% sodium chloride, (b) propranolol hydrochloride in a dose of 10 mg/kg (= 0.1 ml solution per 100 g b.w.). Three hours following the last injection the animals were decapitated and the content of vasopressin and oxytocin was bioassayed in the hypothalamus and neurointermediate lobe. PX was followed by known decrease of both vasopressin and oxytocin in the hypothalamus and neurohypophysis. In rats not-PX propranolol did not change the vasopressin and oxytocin content in the hypothalamus and neurointermediate lobe. In PX-rats, treatment with propranolol resulted in a distinct increase of the vasopressin in the neurohypophysis. It may be therefore supposed that the beta-adrenergic transmission is in some way involved in the regulatory mechanisms of pineal-neurohypophysial functional relationship.", 
    "18": "The effects of seven beta-receptor blocking drugs differing in lipophilicity by 3.5 orders of magnitude (propranolol, bupranolol, oxprenolol, metoprolol, sotalol, practolol, atenolol) were studied on the circadian rhythm in motor activity of light-dark-synchronized (light (L): 7-19 h, dark (D): 19-7 h) male rats. Motor activity after i.p. injection of saline or of the racemic mixtures of all drugs and the isomers of propranolol, bupranolol and practolol was measured in groups of 5 rats with a motimeter. Two doses of either drug were injected either at 7:30 a.m. in L or at 7:30 p.m. in D. In L the drugs did either not affect motor activity or even increased motility in comparison to saline. No dosage-dependency was observed in the drug effects in L. In contrast, during D a dosage-dependent decrease in motor activity was found for all compounds. ED50-values of decrease in motility during D were negatively correlated with lipophilicity (partition coefficient) of the compounds. No significant difference was found in the ED50-values of the isomers studied. The results clearly demonstrate a circadian phase dependency in the effects of beta-receptor blocking drugs on motor activity of rats. A dosage-dependent central depressant effect of the drugs could be observed only in D. It is concluded that the central depressant effects of beta-receptor blocking drugs are mainly due to the non-specific, lipophilic property of the drugs and not brought about by a specific blockade of central beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "19": "Thirty-six patients with Raynaud's disease (RD) were treated with a low dosage of beta-blockers, atenolol (50 mg/day) or propranolol (20 mg/day). Previous data have suggested that the pathophysiology of RD may be mediated by presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors. In this research we report that chronic beta-blocker treatment, at low dosage, can prevent the cold-induced vasospasm. The majority of patients (28) responded to atenolol, and 8 patients refractory to atenolol responded to propranolol.", 
    "20": "The results of 5-year pharmacologic treatment of 234 coronary patients with stable angina of varying functional classes are reported. Coronarography detected stenosis of major coronary arteries in all cases; ventriculography demonstrated no disorders of left-ventricular contractility. Clinical improvement and stabilization occurred in 75.2% of patients, deterioration, in 24.8%. Of the latter group, nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in 13.7%, and signs of heart failure developed in 9.8%. Repeat bicycle ergometry demonstrated increased or unchanged physical stress tolerance in 67.1%. Working capacity was intact after five years in 61.1%. Therefore, long-term medication of coronary patients with stable angina and normal left-ventricular contractility has proved efficient.", 
    "21": "Two hundred patients with unstable angina were examined. Of those, 100 were on medication only, while another 100 had undergone aortocoronary shunting. Five-year survival rate was higher, and the quality of life was better, in the surgical patients, as compared to conservative cases.", 
    "22": "This study was undertaken to assess the effects of exogenous alpha-agonists on the effector response to transmural nerve stimulation in canine saphenous vein rings. The response to a fixed train (5 s duration) of transmural nerve stimulation (8 Hz, 0.3 ms, 9 V) applied every 5 min was determined in the control state and in the presence of subthreshold (for contraction) concentrations of noradrenaline, adrenaline, clonidine, and methoxamine. The maximum potentiations achieved by the three drugs were 246.2 +/- 36.9, 220.5 +/- 38.8, 384.3 +/- 78.7, and 353.3 +/- 68.0%, respectively. The potentiation observed was significantly inhibited by indomethacin (10(-6) mol/L) and propranolol (5 X 10(-6) mol/L). Both indomethacin and propranolol potentiated the response to transmural nerve stimulation. The potentiation of the responses to transmural nerve stimulation by alpha-agonists suggests that, presynaptic alpha 2-inhibition by circulating catecholamines is likely to be of limited biological significance in modulating the effector responses in the canine saphenous vein.", 
    "23": "Thirty patients scheduled for major middle ear surgery and induced hypotension, with a trimetaphan/sodium nitroprusside infusion, were randomly allocated to receive a single oral dose of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist 2 hours before surgery. In group 1 ten patients received metoprolol 50 mg, in group 2 ten patients received metoprolol 25 mg and in group 3 ten patients received oxprenolol 20 mg. There were ten controls for each group. The nitroprusside infusion rate was significantly reduced in groups 1 and 3. However, there was an unacceptably high incidence of profound bradycardia after induction of anaesthesia in those patients who had received beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists pre-operatively and this technique is not recommended for routine use.", 
    "24": "The effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, varying in lipophilicity and receptor selectivity, were studied on tremor elicited by L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP) in rats pretreated with a peripherally acting decarboxylase inhibitor and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, or by the directly acting 5-HT agonist 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT). Plasma levels of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were determined simultaneously. The non-selective lipophilic adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol was found to dose-dependently reduce tremor intensity, whereas the non-selective hydrophilic adrenoceptor antagonist sotalol had no effect, indicating a central site of action. Furthermore, beta 1-selective blockade with the adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol had no effect on tremor intensity, whereas the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 dose-dependently suppressed tremor intensity, suggesting that the beta-adrenoceptor subtype involved is of the beta 2-type. These results suggest that blockade of centrally located beta 2-adrenoceptors are able to attenuate the tremor response following 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor activation.", 
    "25": "The muscarinic agonist oxotremorine was used to induce tremor in rats pretreated with methylatropine. An objective assessment of tremor intensity was accomplished by means of an accelerometer-based recording system. The non-selective, lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol dose-dependently suppressed tremor intensity, whereas the R-isomer of propranolol was without effect, verifying beta-adrenoceptor involvement. Since the hydrophilic, non-selective beta-antagonist nadolol was ineffective, the effect appears to be located inside the blood-brain barrier. The beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118, 551 dose-dependently reduced tremor intensity, whereas selective blockade of beta 1-adrenoceptors with metoprolol had no effect, indicating the participation of a beta 2-adrenoceptor. On the other hand, the lipophilic beta 2-agonist clenbuterol dose-dependently enhanced tremor induced by oxotremorine. Determination of circulating plasma catecholamine concentrations revealed that the effect of beta-antagonists on tremor was not secondary to an effect on the oxotremorine-induced rise in catecholamine levels. Thus, the results suggest that beta 2-adrenoceptors located inside the blood-brain barrier are able to modulate oxotremorine-induced tremor in rats.", 
    "26": "In order to localize beta-adrenoceptors 125I-(-)pindolol (IPIN) was used in binding to sections from cat colon. The binding characteristics for IPIN to beta-adrenoceptors on colon sections were estimated by demonstrating reversible binding in the presence of isoprenaline and by steroselective binding to the isomers of propranolol. The binding of IPIN to both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors was shown by biphasic displacement curves in the presence of the selective beta-adrenoceptor compounds betaxolol, ICI 118.551 and procaterol. The colon sections were found to contain proportions of beta 1-adrenoceptors (30-50%) and beta 2-adrenoceptors (50-70%). In the autoradiographic studies, 100% of the developed grains after exposure of IPIN to the photographic emulsion were displaced by 50 microM of isoprenaline. By microscopic counting at autoradiographic grains, 30-40% of the grains were found in the circular smooth muscle, while 60-70% of the grains were found in the longitudinal smooth muscle. A concentration of 2 nM ICI 118.551 completely displaced all grains in the circular smooth muscle and partly displaced those found in the longitudinal smooth muscle. A high concentration of ICI 118.551 (1 microM) displaced all grains above background from the smooth muscle. It is concluded that the circular smooth muscle only contains beta 2-adrenoceptors, while longitudinal smooth muscle may contain a proportion of beta 1-adrenoceptors. Whether such a location of beta adrenoceptors can be related to the beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of colon motility can not be clarified from these studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "The controversial hypothesis that capillary pressure (Pc) is autoregulated in response to arterial pressure (PA) alterations was tested in sympathectomized cat skeletal muscle by studying the relation between Pc and PA under conditions of well preserved vascular tone and reactivity, during papaverine-induced maximal vasodilatation (passive vascular bed), and during impaired vascular reactivity caused by preparatory surgery, or by low dose isoproterenol administration. The latter states resembled such under which Pc autoregulation unintentionally seems to have been studied previously. Capillary pressure was assessed with the Pcvenule method for continuous direct pressure recordings from capillaries/postcapillary venules (Mellander et al. 1987) and simultaneously derived from observed net transvascular fluid flux divided by CFC. Resistances in the whole vascular bed and in its pre- and postcapillary segments (Ra and Rv) were determined from recordings of blood flow, PA, Pc, and PV. During preserved vascular reactivity, Pc was found to be virtually constant, that is, almost perfectly autoregulated, over the PA range from 50 to 180 mmHg, whereas in the passive vascular bed there was a direct linear relation between Pc and PA (y = 0.137x + 11.69; r = 0.97). The delta Pc/delta PA ratio was about 1/70 in the normal reactive, and 1/7 in the passive, vascular bed, implying an increase in Pc by 1 mmHg for every 70 mmHg and every 7 mmHg increase in PA, respectively. Capillary pressure autoregulation was explained by precise adjustments of Ra/Rv in relation to PA elicited by myogenic and metabolic regulatory mechanisms. This protective reaction against plasma loss during increased PA was abolished during maximal vasodilation, and was much impaired by surgical trauma, partly via a beta-adrenergic inhibitory effect, and by isoproterenol, in turn causing gross transcapillary fluid fluxes. The latter findings might explain failing Pc autoregulation in some previous studies undertaken under seemingly similar conditions.", 
    "28": "Phantom pain may occur in up to 85% of patients after limb amputation. Although the pathophysiology of postamputation phantom pain is not well understood, it seems to be produced by a complex multifactorial interaction between the peripheral, sympathetic, and central nervous systems. The theoretical aspects of this are reviewed. Management of phantom limb pain may be both medical and surgical. Among the pharmacological agents proved effective against phantom pain are beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. Surgical management includes peripheral nerve stimulation, thermocontrolled coagulation of the spinal cord, spinal cord stimulation, transcutaneous nerve stimulation, and stereotactic deep brain stimulation.",

BW A575C produced a competitive blockade of heart rate responses to isoprenaline in a guinea-pig right atrial preparation (pKB 7.18 +/- 0.05, cf. pindolol 8.9 +/- 0.7). BW A575C inhibited a partially purified preparation of ACE obtained from rabbit lung (IC50 10.7 +/- 2.1 nM, cf. enalaprilat, 4.4 +/- 0.8 nM). Intravenous administration of BW A575C (1-100 micrograms kg-1 min-1) to the pithed rat inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion both angiotensin I-induced pressor responses and isoprenaline-induced tachycardia. Dose-ratios obtained from such studies demonstrated that, in this preparation, BW A575C was approximately 100 times more active as an ACE inhibitor than as a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent. Intravenous administration of BW A575C (1 mg kg-1) to the conscious rat inhibited angiotensin I-induced pressor responses, being approximately equipotent to enalapril and 10 times more potent than captopril. At the same dose, BW A575C had a similar duration of action as an ACE inhibitor to enalapril. Intravenous administration of BW A575C (1 mg kg-1) to either conscious dogs or rats inhibited both angiotensin I-induced pressor responses and isoprenaline-induced heart rate responses. Dose-ratios obtained from such studies demonstrated that in these species, BW A575C was 2-10 times more active as an ACE inhibitor than as a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent.", 
    "30": "The effects of 5-hydroxy-propafenone (5-OH-P), an active metabolite of propafenone, were studied on isolated atrial muscle fibres obtained from non-treated guinea-pigs and from animals pretreated with 5-OH-P, 3 mg kg-1, for 28 days. In untreated atria 5-OH-P, 10(-8) M-10(-4) M, produced a dose-dependent decrease in amplitude and df/dtmax and reduced the amplitude of the slow contractions induced by isoprenaline and histamine in high K+ media. 5-OH-P also produced a dose-dependent decrease in atrial rate, prolonged the sinus node recovery time and reduced the maximum chronotropic responses to isoprenaline. In untreated atrial muscle fibres 5-OH-P depressed action potential amplitude and Vmax, reduced the resting membrane potential and prolonged the action potential duration (ADP) and the effective refractory period, lengthening the effective refractory period relative to APD. Pretreatment with 5-OH-P reduced atrial rate and increased contractile force, but did not modify the action potential characteristics from the values obtained in untreated atria. Further addition of 5-OH-P produced similar but more marked changes than in untreated atria. It is concluded that in guinea-pig isolated atrial muscle fibres 5-OH-P, like propafenone, exhibits class I (membrane stabilizing), class II (antisympathetic) and class IV (Ca antagonistic) antiarrhythmic actions. Therefore, this metabolite could be responsible, at least in part, for some of the antiarrhythmic effects previously attributed to propafenone.", 
    "31": "The time-course of plasma noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) concentrations and their dissipation profiles were examined concomitantly with heart rate changes after strenuous exercise in eight normal subjects receiving either placebo or carteolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker. Post-exercise NA concentrations declined with time in a biexponential manner, while A disappearance curves were apparently monophasic. Plasma NA concentrations and their peak value attained within 3 min after exercise were higher in the carteolol than in the placebo phase, whereas there were no significant differences in the first and second disappearance t1/2 between the two trials. The monoexponential t1/2 of A in the carteolol trial was significantly longer than in the placebo trial. Our results suggest that the dissipation profiles of catecholamines released by exercise appear to be affected by beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "32": "The relationships between heart rates (HR) and corresponding PR intervals (PR) were studied in 12 healthy young subjects during rest, standing and graduated treadmill exercise to heart rates of 160 to 170 beats min-1 and during the infusion of isoprenaline to heart rates of 100 to 110 beats min-1. During exercise, PR diminished with increasing HR. Over the range of HR from 60 to 160 beats min-1 all 12 individual subjects exhibited negative linear correlations between HR and PR described by the equation: PR (ms) = -0.351 HR (beats min-1) + 176.7 for composite data. During isoprenaline infusion the PR interval also diminished with increasing heart rate. Over the range of HR from 60 to 110 beats min-1, 11 of the 12 subjects exhibited negative linear correlations between HR and PR described by the equation: PR (ms) = -0.582 HR (beats min-1) + 186.5 for composite data. The exercise model was used to study the indirect (or rate-dependent) effects and the direct actions on atrioventricular conduction of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs and calcium channel antagonists, alone and in combination, in three groups of healthy subjects. Control and placebo observations on HR and PR at rest, standing and during exercise in these additional subjects also exhibited individual inverse linear relationships between HR and PR. Following the administration of beta-adrenoceptor blockers, PR were prolonged more than expected at the HR observed. Rate-adjusted PR prolongation during exercise exceeded standing which exceeded resting, indicating greater beta-adrenoceptor blockade in atrioventricular nodal tissue than in sinoatrial nodal tissue at each level of activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "Betaxolol is a new cardioselective beta-blocker without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. A study of the cardiac electrophysiological effects of this molecule used intravenously was carried out in 20 patients. Betaxolol prolongs the sinus cycle (+ 25%, p 0.001), prolongs the sino-atrial conduction time (+ 20.1%) and atrio-hissian conduction time (+ 10.8%, p 0.001), and prolongs the refractory periods at all levels: atrial (+ 8%), nodal (+ 20.8%), right ventricular (+ 4.3%). These findings confirm the electrophysiological characteristic effects of the beta-blockers series; however, the moderate but significant increase of the refractory ventricular period, seems to provide this molecule with a certain degree of originality in this therapeutic class.", 
    "34": "The present review shows that labetalol has many advantageous properties in the treatment of patients suffering from angina pectoris with or without hypertension. These patients respond with vasoconstriction to a variety of internal and external influences. The selective alpha 1-blocking component in addition to the non-selective beta-blockade of labetalol attenuates the increased coronary vascular resistance and improves coronary haemodynamics especially under stress in a manner which should be favourable in myocardial ischaemia. In addition, the alpha 1-blocking component may prevent different kinds of arrhythmias generated by alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation. Labetalol has no effect on renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, plasma electrolyte concentrations, glucose tolerance, lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, uric acid levels, or on platelet aggregation. Intravenously administrated labetalol has proved to be effective in patients with acute myocardial infarction, especially if associated with hypertension. In order to avoid postural hypotension, oral treatment should be started with a low dose of 100 mg twice daily. The usual dosage in patients without hypertension is 200 mg twice daily, but in patients with hypertension doses up to 1200 mg or even more have been used. In low doses up to 400 mg daily, the unwanted effects are few and often self-limited. High doses can cause side effects related to both beta- and alpha-blocking properties of labetalol. As an antianginal agent labetalol has proved to be at least as effective as selective or non-selective beta-blockers.", 
    "35": "The hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzyme system bound and metabolized the experimental drug prizidilol. Prizidilol bound to two distinct sites on cytochrome P-450. At low concentrations (less than ca 20 microM), prizidilol bound to the substrate binding site of the enzyme and produced a Type I difference spectrum. At higher concentrations (25-190 microM), prizidilol bound to the oxygen binding site of the enzyme and produced a type II difference spectrum. Prizidilol stimulated hepatic microsomal CO-inhibitable NADPH oxidation. Prizidilol metabolism by hepatic microsomes assessed by prizidilol disappearance was inhibited by CO:O2 (80:20; v/v), SKF 525-A and metyrapone. Prizidilol disappearance was monitored using a newly developed TLC assay for prizidilol following derivatization with quinolin-3-al. The apparent binding constants (Ks), maximum extents of binding (delta Amax), Michaelis constants (Km) and maximum velocities (Vmax) for the interaction of prizidilol with hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 were assessed in rats pretreated or not with the inducing agents phenobarbital, beta-naphthoflavone and pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile. For the differently pretreated rats the apparent Ks values for the type I site and the type II site and the apparent Km were ca 3 microM, 150 microM and 2 microM, respectively. Apparent Vmax values varied from 20 to 70 pmol per min per mg microsomal protein. The observed effects of induction on the apparent equilibrium constants and maximum extents of binding and metabolism of prizidilol indicate that the forms of cytochrome P-450 induced by phenobarbital, pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile or beta-naphthoflavone do not play a major role in the metabolism of prizidilol. Prizidilol was also metabolized by hepatic cytosolic N-acetyltransferase. The apparent Km values for prizidilol and acetyl CoA were 0.8 and 22 microM. Apparent Vmax values were 50 and ca 2 pmol per min per mg protein for partially purified transferase and cytosol, respectively. It is concluded that the rates of oxidation and acetylation of this drug would be expected to be relatively low, being limited by low apparent Vmax values for both oxidation and acetylation.", 
    "36": "The response to early graded exercise testing (GXT) was studied in 227 patients at a mean of 15.3 days after myocardial revascularization surgery (MRS). GXT followed a modified Bruce protocol without multiples of resting energy expenditure (MET) restrictions and a target heart rate (HR) of 90% of age-predicted maximal HR. The decision as to precisely when to administer the GXT after surgery was made on an individual case basis by the cardiovascular surgeon and the attending cardiologist. For the data analysis, patients were grouped according to the number of days the GXT was administered after surgery: group 1, 7 to 14 days (n = 164); group 2, 15 to 28 days (n = 46); and group 3, greater than 28 days (n = 17). The use of beta blockers was also determined on an individual case basis by the attending cardiologist rather than on a random basis. Ninety-seven of the 227 patients were on beta blockers. Ventricular ectopic activity (VEA), ST-segment changes (STTC), peak HR, peak systolic blood pressure (SBP), peak rate-pressure product (RPP), and peak METs were assessed during exercise. No major complications occurred during testing. Approximately two thirds (67.4%) of the tests were terminated voluntarily by the patient, and 22.5% were stopped by the attending physician. Only 10.1% of the subjects reached the target HR. Chi-square analysis failed to reveal any association between time of testing after surgery and either STTC or VEA. Analysis of variance failed to reveal any effects of group or beta blocker on peak METs attained during GXT; however, patients not using beta blocker medication attained higher peak HR, SBP, and RPP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Esmolol was administered as a continuous infusion, and blood concentrations were measured at intervals up to 40 min after discontinuation of the infusion. In all patients, a bi-exponential equation best described the esmolol concentration--time curve. Half-lives for the distribution and elimination phases were 1.34 +/- 0.77 min and 9.9 +/- 4.55 min (mean +/- SD), respectively. The mean values for V beta and V epsilon were 1.9 +/- 1.24 l X kg-1 and 0.41 +/- 0.31 l X kg-1, respectively, and the total clearance was 128 +/- 41 ml X kg-1 X min-1.", 
    "39": "Microinjections of L-glutamate (10(-10) to 2 X 10(-8) mol/kg) into the nucleus of tractus solitarii produced a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial pressure and a decrease in heart rate. L-Glutamate-induced hypertension was prevented by spinal transection and pretreatment with atropine (1 mg/kg iv) reversed the bradycardia. L-Glutamate also produced a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial pressure when injected intravenously and into the cisterna magna, but the dose-effect curves were shifted to the right. Finally, pretreatment with hexamethonium (30 mg/kg iv) abolished the hypertension resulting from intravenous injections of L-glutamate. These data demonstrate that the nucleus of tractus solitarii may play a determinant role in the central pressor effects of L-glutamate. In addition, we demonstrated that this hypertension was due to a central sympathetic stimulation and that the autonomic nervous system also mediated the pressor effects of intravenous L-glutamate.", 
    "40": "The renal hemodynamic response to renal arterial dopamine infusions was compared in unanesthetized fetal (129-137 days gestation, full term 145 days), newborn, and adult sheep. Mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate remained unchanged during intrarenal dopamine infusions. Dopamine produced dose-related decreases in mean renal blood flow velocity in all three groups. When compared with adult sheep fetal sheep were slightly more sensitive to the vasoconstrictive effects of dopamine ED50 (mean effective dose ratio: fetus/ED50 adult = 0.368 +/- 0.047, P less than 0.05). Increases in mean renal blood flow velocity were not seen at any dose given (1-16 micrograms/kg body wt in fetuses, 2-32 micrograms/kg body wt in newborns and adults) until dopamine was infused during alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The largest mean increase in renal flow velocity was 13 +/- 3, 16 +/- 3, and 17 +/- 4% in fetal, newborn, and adult sheep, respectively. cis-Flupentixol inhibited the vasodilation. This study demonstrates the presence of renal vasodilation following renal arterial dopamine infusions in fetal, newborn, and adult sheep when renal alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors are blocked. Vasodilator responses are similar in all three groups, and increases in renal blood flow velocity are small compared with that of other experimental models.", 
    "41": "Based on evidence implicating the central nervous system in the regulation of coronary vascular resistance and the knowledge that the hypothalamus is a central site for integration of cardiovascular control, studies were undertaken to determine if electrical stimulation in the hypothalamus produced coronary vasoconstriction. In anesthetized cats, following beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, stimulation in perifornical lateral hypothalamus produced a transient decrease in coronary blood flow velocity (30 +/- 5%), a small pressor effect (7 +/- 2 mmHg), and an initial decrease in hindquarter blood flow velocity (51 +/- 5%). The decrease in coronary flow velocity, which had an onset latency of 1-3 s and a duration of 5-15 s, was abolished by ipsilateral stellate ganglionectomy and by intravenous and intracoronary prazosin. The coronary vasoconstriction produced by hypothalamic stimulation was not different from that produced by cardioaccelerator nerve stimulation. These results suggest that electrical stimulation of a hypothalamic site produces an alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated decrease in coronary blood flow that is unmasked by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, requires the integrity of ipsilateral cardiac sympathetic innervation, and mimics the coronary response to cardioaccelerator nerve stimulation.", 
    "42": "Previous studies indicate that programmed extrastimulus testing (PES) during isoproterenol infusion facilitates induction of clinical ventricular tachycardia (VT) in some patients. This study attempts to determine if VT inducible only during isoproterenol infusion predicts suppression of VT with chronic oral beta-adrenergic blockade. Nine patients, aged 23 to 77 years, with symptomatic VT or syncope not necessarily provoked by exercise or stress were evaluated. Extrastimuli did not induce VT in any patient. However, during isoproterenol infusion (1 to 4 micrograms/min), all patients had reproducibly inducible VT corresponding to their spontaneously occurring VT (recordings available in 7 patients). Coupling intervals inducing tachycardia during isoproterenol were similar to intervals that did not induce VT without isoproterenol. No patient had VT with isoproterenol infusion alone (without extrastimuli). In only 4 of 8 patients who underwent exercise tests while not taking medications was VT provoked. With propranolol therapy (160 mg/day) or its equivalent, only 1 patient had recurrent symptoms during a mean follow-up of 39 months (range 23 to 52). VT inducible with extrastimuli only during isoproterenol infusion predicts that oral beta-adrenergic blockade will prevent spontaneous VT or syncope long term. These data suggest that occurrence of VT in some patients depends on premature depolarizations in the setting of beta-adrenergic influence.", 
    "43": "This study examined the effects of beta blockade with betaxolol, a cardioselective, lipid-soluble, beta-adrenergic-blocking agent, on rest and exercise systolic and diastolic left ventricular function in 15 patients, aged 40 to 70 years (mean = 52), with chronic stable angina pectoris. Each patient underwent three upright exercise studies at identical workloads; the first was a baseline study, the second was done 3 hours after a single oral dose, and the third was obtained after chronic therapy for 2 weeks. Beta blockade was evident by significant decreases in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise (p less than 0.04). Although there were no significant changes (at rest or during exercise) in mean left ventricular ejection fraction and peak filling rate, individual variations were seen after 3 hours and 2 weeks of therapy. During chronic therapy, the peak filling rate increased in three patients, decreased in five, and remained unchanged in seven. Also, discordant changes in systolic and diastolic functions were seen at rest and during exercise during both acute and chronic therapy. Thus, although acute and chronic beta blockade produces no significant changes in mean measurements of diastolic and systolic left ventricular performance, individual variations and discordant results are seen in many patients. The acute effects are generally consistent with the chronic effects, but exceptions are present.", 
    "44": "We have used primed constant infusions of [1-13C]palmitic acid, [2-3H]glycerol, and [U-14C]glucose to evaluate the response of glucose and fat kinetics to alpha or beta adrenergic blockade in conscious dogs. The response of each blocking agent was evaluated both with and without control of the glucoregulatory hormones. When hormones were controlled, somatostatin and metyrapone were infused to block hormonal secretion, and insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, and cortisol were replaced at basal physiological rates. alpha blockade (beta stimulation) did not influence glucose production or oxidation, but it did decrease glucose clearance when hormones were controlled. Clearance did not decrease during blockade when hormones were not controlled, presumably because of the resulting increase in the plasma insulin concentration. Glucose production, plasma glucose concentration, and glucose oxidation all increased with beta blockade (alpha stimulation). alpha blockade (beta stimulation) resulted in an increase in lipolysis, whereas beta blockade (alpha stimulation) resulted in a decrease in lipolysis. In neither case, however, did FFA oxidation change. We conclude that (a) the predominant effect of unopposed stimulation is the stimulation of lipolysis, whereas unopposed alpha stimulation inhibits lipolysis. Direct effects of either alpha or beta stimulation on glucose kinetics are less dramatic, but both alpha and beta stimulation decrease glucose clearance.",

    "46": "The antihypertensive effects of indenolol, a new not-cardioselective beta-blocking agent, were evaluated in patients with WHO grades I and II essential hypertension (range 160/95 to 200/115 mm Hg) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study after acute (12 patients) and 2-week treatment (seven patients). Indenolol (30 to 120 mg) reduced blood pressure in a dose-dependent fashion. Maximum reduction was 26 mm Hg for systolic and 17 mm Hg for diastolic pressure. Hypotensive activity commenced within 10 minutes, peaked in 60 minutes, and persisted for about 7 hours. Lower limb vascular resistance (strain-gauge plethysmography) was significantly lowered, thus suggesting an intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Heart rate was progressively reduced at 30 and 60 mg without any additional effect at 120 mg. Indenolol did not alter adrenergic reflexes (standing, cold application, and hand-grip) and did not induce any side effect. In conclusion, indenolol possesses an antihypertensive activity associated with reduction of vascular resistance.", 
    "47": "1. The effects of adenosine deaminase, inosine, alkylxanthines (8-phenyltheophylline (8-PT), theophylline and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX], dipyridamole, alpha, beta-methylene ADP (AOPCP) and ATP analogues (alpha, beta-methylene ATP and beta, gamma-methylene ATP) on evoked end-plate potentials (e.p.p.s) were investigated in innervated sartorius muscles of the frog, in which twitches had been prevented with tubocurarine. The effects of 8-PT and IBMX on the amplitude and quantal content of e.p.p.s were also investigated in innervated sartorius muscles of the frog, in which twitches had been prevented with high-magnesium solutions. 2. Adenosine deaminase reversibly increased the amplitude of e.p.p.s and prevented the reduction caused by exogenously applied adenosine on e.p.p. amplitude. The increase caused by adenosine deaminase was equivalent to the decrease caused by 12 +/- 5.8 microM-adenosine on e.p.p. amplitude. 3. Inosine, the product of adenosine deamination, was virtually devoid of effect on e.p.p.s. 4. The adenosine receptor antagonists at the frog neuromuscular junction, 8-PT and theophylline, increased in a concentration-dependent manner the amplitude of e.p.p.s in the presence of tubocurarine. 8-PT increased the amplitude and quantal content of e.p.p.s in the presence of high magnesium. IBMX, which does not behave as an adenosine receptor antagonist at the frog neuromuscular junction, decreased the amplitude of e.p.p.s in the presence of tubocurarine or high-magnesium solutions. 5. Dipyridamole, an adenosine uptake blocker, decreased the amplitude of e.p.p.s, and in a concentration that did not affect neuromuscular transmission potentiated the depressing effect of adenosine, but not that of 2-chloroadenosine, on the amplitude of e.p.p.s. 6. AOPCP, an inhibitor of 5'-nucleotidase, increased the amplitude of e.p.p.s and markedly attenuated the depressing effect of ATP, but not that of adenosine, on e.p.p. amplitude. 7. The ATP analogue, alpha, beta-methylene ATP, which is not a substrate for 5'-nucleotidase, was virtually devoid of effect on e.p.p.s. beta, gamma-Methylene ATP, which can be a substrate for 5'-nucleotidase, mimicked the depressing effect of ATP on e.p.p. amplitude, an effect which was also reduced by AOPCP. 8. It is concluded that in conditions in which the initial quantal content is assumed to be normal (1) endogenous adenosine depresses neuromuscular transmission, (2) at the neuromuscular junction adenosine is inactivated through a dipyridamole-sensitive uptake process, and (3) released adenine nucleotides might contribute to the pool of endogenous adenosine which modulates neuromuscular transmission.", 
    "48": "The subcutaneous administration of a single dose of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists atenolol, betaxolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, propranolol, or sotalol to conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) lowered mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 15-20%, but this vaso-depression was not accompanied by a rise in plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration. When MAP was decreased at the same rate and to the same extent with the vasodilator minoxidil, plasma NE concentration increased 50-75%. Atenolol, betaxolol, propranolol, and sotalol lowered heart rate, whereas oxprenolol, pindolol, and minoxidil elicited a tachycardia. Atenolol (-48%), betaxolol (-63%), and propranolol (-29%) significantly suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA), and minoxidil elevated PRA by 150-315%. Pindolol (+37%) caused a nonsignificant increase in PRA, and oxprenolol (-23%) and sotalol (-17%) produced nonsignificant decreases in PRA. Because the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists did not increase plasma NE concentration, whereas an equivasodepressor dose of minoxidil did, we conclude that plasma NE concentration is inappropriately low relative to the decrease in MAP caused by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in the conscious SHR. In addition, the diverse effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on PRA in SHRs indicate that a suppression of renin release cannot account for either the decrease in MAP caused by these drugs or the failure of plasma NE concentration to increase when MAP is decreased by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "49": "Carvedilol is a new beta-receptor blocking and vasodilating drug that is presently undergoing clinical trials in hypertension and coronary heart disease. In this article, the pharmacodynamic properties of carvedilol are compared with those of standard drugs. The beta-blocking activity was characterized in isolated organs and in conscious rats, rabbits, and dogs. For the beta 1-blockade in guinea pig atria, the pA10 values were 7.44 +/- 0.16 for carvedilol and 6.77 +/- 0.08 for propranolol. Carvedilol is a noncardioselective beta-blocker. The i.v. doses that inhibited the tachycardia by 50% induced by 1 microgram/kg isoprenaline were 62 micrograms/kg in dogs, 138 micrograms/kg in rabbits and 841 micrograms/kg in rats. In rabbits carvedilol was slightly more active and in rats less active than propranolol. In all models, carvedilol was much more active than labetalol or prizidilol. In contrast to propranolol, carvedilol relaxed rat aortic strips. A dose-dependent decrease in arterial blood pressure was seen in different in vivo models. The total peripheral and coronary resistance were decreased in conscious dogs. The doses required for both beta-blockade and decrease in blood pressure were in the same range. The drug was also active after oral administration. There is no hint for development of tolerance.", 
    "50": "Several gastrointestinal hormones have been found in the intestinal lumen, but as yet their physiologic role is not yet clear. We have previously shown in anesthesized animals that electrical vagal stimulation provokes simultaneous intraluminal release of serotonin (5-HT) and substance P (SP). The aim of this study was to investigate if a physiologic stimulus, a meal, releases 5-HT, SP, and gastrin (G) into the canine jejunum. In 10 dogs, chronic jejunal Thiry-Vella loops were perfused with saline (37 degrees C) before and after: a test meal; atropine, 0.2 mg/kg intravenously before the meal; atropine alone at the same dose; propanolol, 0.5 mg/kg intravenously before the meal; and propanolol alone at the same dose. Effluent perfusates and peripheral blood samples were assayed by radioimmunoassay for concentrations of 5-HT, SP, and G. Large amounts of all three humoral agents were found intraluminally during the interdigestive period. The meal resulted in increased circulating levels of 5-HT, SP, and G, while intraluminal concentrations of 5-HT and SP but not G increased following the meal. Both atropine and propanolol pretreatment significantly reduced this response, while alone, these drugs did not affect basal values. We postulate that 5-HT and SP released into the intestinal lumen in response to a meal act as local neurocrine/paracrine modulators. Their release mechanisms appear to be under both cholinergic and adrenergic control.", 
    "51": "We examined the effect of platelet-activating factor (PAF) on beta-adrenoceptors in the membranes of human lung and the functional responses to methacholine, histamine and isoproterenol in human lung parenchyma and tracheal strips. Preincubation of the human lung slices with 0.1 microM PAF decreased the density of beta-adrenoceptors without a change in the affinity. In the functional studies, a subthreshold dose of PAF (0.1 microM) significantly reduced the potency of isoproterenol to reverse methacholine or histamine-induced contraction. BN 52021, a PAF antagonist, protected against these PAF-induced changes. These findings suggest that PAF-induced down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors could be a mechanism of the non-specific airway hyperreactivity in asthma.", 
    "52": "The mechanisms by which glyburide and tolbutamide signal insulin secretion were examined using a beta cell line (Hamster insulin-secreting tumor (HIT) cells). Insulin secretion was measured in static incubations, free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was monitored in quin 2-loaded cells, and cAMP quantitated by radioimmunoassay. Insulin secretory dose-response curves utilizing static incubations fit a single binding site model and established that glyburide (ED50 = 112 +/- 18 nM) is a more potent secretagogue than tolbutamide (ED50 = 15 +/- 3 microM). Basal HIT cell [Ca2+]i was 76 +/- 7 nM (mean +/- S.E., n = 141) and increased in a dose-dependent manner with both glyburide and tolbutamide with ED50 values of 525 +/- 75 nM and 67 +/- 9 microM, respectively. The less active tolbutamide metabolite, carboxytolbutamide, had no effect on [Ca2+]i or insulin secretion. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with 4 mM EGTA completely inhibited the sulfonylurea-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and insulin release and established that the rise in [Ca2+]i came from an extracellular Ca2+ pool. The Ca2+ channel blocker, verapamil, inhibited glyburide- or tolbutamide-stimulated insulin release and the rise in [Ca2+]i at similar concentrations with IC50 values of 3 and 2.5 microM, respectively. At all concentrations tested, the sulfonylureas did not alter HIT cell cAMP content. These findings provide direct experimental evidence that glyburide and tolbutamide allow extracellular Ca2+ to enter the beta cell through verapamil-sensitive, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, causing a rise in [Ca2+]i which is the second messenger that stimulates insulin release.", 
    "53": "Repeated electroconvulsive shock (ECS) was administered to rats previously injected with DSP-4 (N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine hydrochloride), a noradrenergic neurotoxin. The normal increase in neocortical beta 1-adrenoceptor binding caused by noradrenaline depletion was effectively prevented by ECS. This finding suggests that the plasticity of the beta 1-adrenoceptor may be partially independent of endogenous noradrenaline concentration. Additionally, functional noradrenergic neurons are not necessarily a critical requirement for the antidepressant effect of electroconvulsive treatment in humans.", 
    "54": "There is evidence that central monoamines are involved in the actions of benzodiazepines. We have investigated the effects of a single dose of the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, FG 7142, on radioligand binding to alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors in mouse cerebral cortex. We found that seven days after a single injection of FG 7142 there was a large increase in the density of beta-adrenoceptors. This rise was not detectable either 15-30 min, or 24 h after the injection and no statistically significant changes in alpha 2-adrenoceptor binding were found at any of these times. Administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 at the same time as FG 7142 prevented the rise in beta-adrenoceptor density. We discuss the possibility that the beta-adrenoceptor upregulation is related to the behavioural effects of FG 7142.", 
    "55": "The contributions of alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in the central amygdaloid nucleus to the increased renal sympathetic nerve activity and decreased urinary sodium excretion resulting from environmental stress (air jet) in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were examined. Air stress increased mean arterial pressure and renal sympathetic nerve activity (47% from 9.3 +/- 0.8 integrator resets/min), and decreased urinary sodium excretion (38% from 2.4 +/- 0.3 microEq/min/100 g b. wt.). After bilateral administration of guanabenz (2 X 2.5 micrograms) (alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist) into the central amygdaloid nucleus of the same SHR, air stress had no effect on renal sympathetic nerve activity (+7% from 7.5 +/- 0.8 integrator resets/min) or urinary sodium excretion (+5% from 3.5 +/- 0.4 microEq/min/100 g b. wt.), but still increased mean arterial pressure. These effects of guanabenz were prevented by the prior bilateral administration of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine (2 X 15 micrograms), into the central amygdaloid nucleus; rauwolscine alone had no effect on the renal responses to air stress in SHR. Guanabenz in the lateral cerebral ventricle (2 micrograms), the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus (2 X 2.5 micrograms) or a site dorsal to the central amygdaloid nucleus in the area of globus pallidus (2 X 2.5 micrograms) had no effect on the renal sympathetic nerve activity or urinary sodium excretion responses to air stress. Similarly, ICI 118,551 (2 X 1 microgram; beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) in the central amygdaloid nucleus had no effect on the renal responses to air stress.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "[3H]Prostaglandin D2 binding to rabbit platelets was increased by about 150% in the presence of beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol. The isoproterenol-induced potentiation of the [3H]prostaglandin D2 binding gave a bell-shaped dose-response relationship (maximum response at 3 X 10(-8) M) in a stereospecific manner. Similar and moderate potentiation was obtained with terbutaline. On the other hand, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists such as alprenolol, propranolol and butoxamine (beta 2-specific) had no potentiating effect on [3H]prostaglandin D2 binding; rather, they abolished the isoproterenol-induced increase of [3H]prostaglandin D2 binding. The beta 1-specific antagonist, metoprolol, did not have any effect. Rabbit platelets were found to possess one [3H]prostaglandin D2 binding site (Kd = 6 X 10(-7) M, Bmax = 787 fmol/mg protein). In the presence of isoproterenol at 3 X 10(-8) M, Bmax was increased with unaltering Kd value. Isoproterenol did not increase [3H]prostaglandin E1, [3H]prostaglandin E2 and [3H]prostaglandin F2 alpha bindings to platelets. The potential effect of isoproterenol was mimicked by forskolin, theophylline, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, prostaglandin E1 and prostaglandin I2, but it was abolished by 2', 5'-dideoxyadenosine, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, indicating that elevated level of cyclic AMP may be available for the induction of the increase of [3H]prostaglandin D2 binding. Prostaglandin D2-induced cyclic AMP synthesis and antiaggregation activity were also augmented in the presence of isoproterenol. These results suggest a beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated cyclic AMP-dependent mechanism for the regulation of prostaglandin D2 receptor binding in rabbit platelets.", 
    "57": "To determine if compliance with timolol treatment was better than compliance with pilocarpine treatment (as reported previously), we measured compliance with timolol treatment in a sample of 110 patients using an unobtrusive eyedrop medication monitor, which recorded electronically the date and time of each drug administration over a four- to six-week period. The patients administered a mean +/- S.D. of 82.7% +/- 19.0% of the prescribed timolol doses (range, 20% to 100%). Forty-five patients were treated concurrently with timolol and pilocarpine. These patients administered a mean +/- S.D. of 84.3% +/- 14.0% of the prescribed timolol doses and 77.7% +/- 18.7% of the prescribed pilocarpine doses (P = .012, van der Waerden test). Our results suggest that while compliance is influenced by the drug regimen, defaulting is not eliminated by prescribing a more convenient medication with fewer side effects.", 
    "58": "Both beta-blocking and calcium channel-blocking drugs are being used with increasing frequency as initial therapy for essential hypertension. The present study was designed to compare the antihypertensive effects of a beta-blocking drug, propranolol, with a calcium channel-blocking drug, diltiazem, at rest and during upright bicycle exercise and to determine whether exercise capacity is altered by these therapies. Twenty-one patients with uncomplicated systemic hypertension and a diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 95 to 110 mm Hg without medication were randomly assigned to propranolol or diltiazem therapy in a double-blind manner. The total daily dosages were titrated as needed, from 160 to 480 mg of propranolol (mean 371 mg) and 120 to 360 mg of diltiazem (mean 307 mg) over 12 weeks, and the titrated dose was maintained for 4 additional weeks. Both drugs significantly reduced supine BP (from 149 +/- 14/101 +/- 4 to 136 +/- 17/89 +/- 10 mm Hg with propranolol and from 157 +/- 14/103 +/- 4 to 144 +/- 13/93 +/- 8 with diltiazem. Only diltiazem reduced BP during submaximal exercise, but both agents produced significant responses during maximal exercise. Diltiazem had no effect on maximal heart rate, exercise duration or O2 uptake, whereas propranolol reduced maximal VO2 from 27 +/- 6 to 22 +/- 6 ml/min/kg (p less than 0.01) and also shortened duration of exercise. Propranolol, despite its effects on heart rate, maintained the workload VO2 relation at submaximal loads, suggesting an increased oxygen delivery. However, these adaptive mechanisms appear to be insufficient during maximal effort.", 
    "59": "Twenty-four-hour profiles of intraarterial ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were significantly reduced by administration of carvedilol, a new beta-blocking drug with vasodilating properties. Twelve patients were given carvedilol, 25 mg twice daily for 2 weeks; the dose was then increased to 50 mg twice daily if the target BP was not achieved. After 4 weeks of therapy, mean daytime reduction in BP was 25 +/- 3 mm Hg systolic and 19 +/- 3 mm Hg diastolic and mean reduction in heart rate was 22 +/- 3 beats/min. BP at the peak of isometric exercise and during dynamic exercise was also significantly reduced. Radionuclide measurements showed that left ventricular ejection fraction was not affected by treatment, but there was a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic volumes. The drug was well tolerated. This clinical trial suggests that carvedilol will be a useful first-line drug for treatment of essential hypertension, and its vasodilating action may have a more favorable effect on left ventricular function than conventional beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "60": "Diuretics and beta-blocking agents have been used for several years as first-step drugs in the treatment of hypertension. There is now growing evidence that calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can also be administered as first-line antihypertensive agents. These agents offer attractive features from the hemodynamic and metabolic viewpoint and with regard to side effects. Diuretics, beta-blocking agents, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, administered either alone or in combination, normalize blood pressure in almost all hypertensive patients.", 
    "61": "Arrhythmias can be variable in their clinical symptoms and are mostly even asymptomatic. Suppression of arrhythmias is usually not very difficult, but the clinical value of the intervention is questionable. Only in the case of a history of myocardial infarction does treatment with beta-blockers appear to improve the prognosis, but the mechanism does not appear to be related to the suppression of arrhythmias. In view of the potentially dangerous effects of all anti-arrhythmics, extreme caution should be exercised in using them. Only in the case of a hemodynamic or symptomatic emergency should anti-arrhythmics be prescribed.", 
    "62": "[3H]Dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) binding to guinea pig alveolar type II cell membrane revealed the presence of both high (KD = 0.38 nM) and low (KD = 4.2 nM) affinity beta-adrenoreceptors. The low affinity site had a higher binding capacity (Bmax = 245.6 fmol/mg protein) than the high affinity site (Bmax = 71.7 fmol/mg protein). Displacement of [3H]DHA by practolol, a selective beta 1 agent, confirmed the existence of two species of adrenoreceptors, corresponding to 21% high affinity (beta 1) and 79% low affinity (beta 2), respectively.", 
    "63": "The effects of dibutyril-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (dB-c-AMP) and forskolin on aortic tension and 45Ca influx were measured. dB-c-AMP reduced both the rate of force development and the maximal tension achieved in solutions containing various K+ concentrations. Stimulated 45Ca influx was also reduced, however, to a lesser extent than was the tension. Forskolin showed more marked effects of a similar nature. Thus, both these agents which increase intracellular c-AMP caused a rightward shift in the curve expressing force (ordinate) as a function of Ca2+ influx (abscissa). Consequently, we found that dB-c-AMP stimulated more net Ca to be taken up by sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) at the same influx rate. The conclusion that c-AMP produced these effects by stimulating Ca uptake into the superficial SR was supported by the finding that dB-c-AMP increased the amount of Ca taken up into a caffeine releasable fraction.", 
    "64": "The influence of rat calcitonin gene-related peptide (rCGRP) on the secretion of gastric somatostatin and gastrin was studied in vitro using the isolated, vascularly perfused rat stomach preparation. rCGRP stimulated somatostatin secretion dose-dependently reaching 3-fold stimulation at 1 microM. The kinetics of somatostatin response were characterized by a sharp increase in the initial phase of rCGRP perfusion followed by sustained elevated levels. Gastrin secretion was moderately suppressed at 1 nM to 100 nM CGRP. Somatostatin responses to half-maximal stimulation with 100 nM CGRP were not affected by concomitant perfusion of atropine, propranolol, and tetrodotoxin. It is concluded that increases in somatostatin release in response to CGRP are probably due to a direct effect on the gastric somatostatin-producing D-cell and may be important for the potent acid-inhibitory activity of CGRP.", 
    "65": "Treatment with certain beta adrenoceptor blocking agents after myocardial infarction reduces mortality and the incidence of reinfarction. Data from a randomised placebo controlled study of the beta 1 selective blocker metoprolol given as secondary prophylaxis were therefore analysed for the possible cost effectiveness of extending this treatment to the general population of patients with myocardial infarction. Metoprolol 100 mg twice daily and matching placebo were given to 154 and 147 patients, respectively, for three years. During this period drug costs for the beta blocker, digitalis, and diuretics were analysed as well as costs of readmission for cardiac problems and indirect costs arising from sick leave or early retirement. Active treatment with metoprolol significantly reduced costs of readmission as well as indirect costs. The net effect per patient over the three years was a reduction of roughly kr 19,000 (1930 pounds). These results suggest that beta blocker treatment given as secondary prophylaxis after myocardial infarction is highly cost effective.", 
    "66": "The effects of lisinopril (MK-521; MSD) and atenolol in the treatment of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were compared in a double-blind, parallel, controlled study, with 24 patients randomly assigned to lisinopril and 12 to atenolol. Patients in both groups whose blood pressure did not respond satisfactorily were given hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The groups were matched for age, race and pretreatment blood pressure. Response to therapy was similar in the atenolol and lisinopril groups, but the combination of lisinopril and HCTZ produced a better response than atenolol plus HCTZ. Indian patients appeared to respond better to lisinopril than black patients, but the hypotensive response to lisinopril plus HCTZ was similar. Plasma renin activity rose and the plasma aldosterone level fell after taking lisinopril. Adverse effects did not occur and only 1 patient on lisinopril 20 mg/d was withdrawn from the study because of postural hypotension. Lisinopril alone and combined with HCTZ in Indian patients and lisinopril combined with HCTZ in black patients produced a satisfactory fall in blood pressure.", 
    "67": "The tritiated adrenergic antagonists [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA; beta-receptors), [3H]prazosin ([3H]PRZ; alpha 1-receptors), and [3H]idazoxan ([3H]IDA; alpha 2-receptors) were used to determine the distribution of these sites in 5 defined areas of the adult rat cerebral cortex. The highest density of [3H]PRZ binding was found in the prefrontal cortex, with a lower and homogeneous distribution for the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal areas. The [3H]IDA binding sites were fairly uniform for all areas, except for the temporal cortex where it was very dense. In contrast, beta-adrenoceptors labelled by [3H]DHA were very homogeneous for all the regions examined. The functional significance of the distribution of alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta-adrenoceptors is discussed in relation to the catecholamine innervation and monoamine contents measured by high performance liquid chromatography.", 
    "68": "Epithelial sheets from rat jejunum and descending colon have been shown to respond to angiotensin II (AII) when studied under short-circuit conditions and bathed on both sides with Krebs-Henseleit solution. The octapeptide AII elicited increases in short-circuit current (SCC) in preparations of jejunum and decreases in SCC in the descending colon; both responses occurred when the peptide was applied to the basolateral surface, but not when applied to the apical solution. Responses in both tissues were highly specific, being inhibited by a range of AII antagonists with the following order of potency: [Sar1. Thr8]-AII greater than [Sar1. Leu8]-AII greater than [Sar1. Ile8]-AII greater than [Sar1. Ala8]-AII greater than [Des,Asp1. Ile8]-AII in rat jejunum. AII responses were not affected by alpha- or beta- adrenoceptor antagonists, atropine or tetrodotoxin. AII responses were totally inhibited by the chloride channel blocker, diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC) while cotransport inhibitors e.g. piretanide and frusemide significantly reduced the size of AII responses in colon and jejunum. These patterns of activity suggest that in the jejunum the responses result from electrogenic chloride secretion. Although AII responses in colon were sensitive to DPC the transporting ions have not yet been identified. Both piroxicam and indomethacin inhibited the increase in SCC elicited by AII in the jejunum, and the reduction in SCC caused by AII in the colon. Taken together these results indicate that eicosanoids are involved in AII responses in both tissues. This is the first study to demonstrate a direct, electrogenic effect for AII on transporting epithelia from the gastrointestinal tract. The responses are most probably initiated by All interacting with previously identified specific All receptors within the epithelial membranes.", 
    "69": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of labetalol, an alpha and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent in 32 patients aged from 72 to 97 years (mean = 85 years) with blood pressure (B.P.) greater than or equal to 160/95 mmHg. This study was carried out in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. After 6 weeks of treatment with labetalol (mean dose = 235 +/- 47.5 mg/day), the systolic pressure was lowered from 187 +/- 24 to 145 +/- 28 mmHg (p less than 0.001) and the diastolic pressure from 98 +/- 10 to 82 +/- 9 mmHg (p less than 0.001). Likewise, in the placebo group, both systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly reduced but the changes were significantly greater in the labetalol group, -33 +/- 26 versus -13 +/- 20 mmHg and -14 +/- 10 versus -8 +/- 14 mmHg respectively. Labetalol achieved B.P. control (160/95 mmHg) in 64% of the treated patients, compared to 40% in the placebo group. Two patients on labetalol discontinued their treatment due to side-effects (one bradycardia and one cutaneous reaction) compared with one patient on placebo (cardiac failure). Two other cases in the labetalol group had side-effects (one fatigue and one dizziness) which prevented increasing the treatment as necessary.", 
    "70": "Peripheral vascular resistance in the ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) increases when the animal enters hibernation. The goals of this study were to determine if a change in vascular reactivity contributes to this hemodynamic response, and to compare the effects of temperature on vascular responsiveness in a hibernator (ground squirrel) and a nonhibernating mammal (rat). Helically cut strips of aortae and femoral arteries were mounted in organ chambers (37 degrees C) and isometric contractions were recorded. The arteries were made to contract in response to exogenous norepinephrine (5.9 X 10(-7) M). Cooling the organ chamber (11 degrees C) potentiated contractions to norepinephrine (5-15% increase) in ground squirrel femoral arteries but depressed those (80-100% decrease) in ground squirrel aortae and rat aortae and femoral arteries. Contractions in response to depolarizing concentrations of potassium in ground squirrel femoral arteries were depressed by cooling (11 degrees C), suggesting that the augmented response to norepinephrine at low temperature is specific. Treatment with indomethacin, propanolol, and ouabain did not alter the potentiating effect of temperature on contractions to norepinephrine in ground squirrel femoral arteries. Apparently, the potentiation is not related to prostaglandins generated in the vascular wall, to blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors, nor to inhibition of the electrogenic sodium pump. The observations are consistent with the hypothesis that a change in vascular responsiveness contributes to the regional control of blood flow in hibernation. This adaptive response is specific in that it does not occur in the aorta of the ground squirrel and the response is not present in the vasculature of the rat, a nonhibernating mammal.", 
    "71": "The mechanisms that control resting heart rate in hyperthyroidism were evaluated in six patients before and after treatment with propylthiouracil. The patients were subjected to pharmacological blockade under resting conditions in two experimental sessions: first session, propranolol (0.2 mg/kg body weight); second session, atropine (0.04 mg/kg body weight) followed by propranolol (0.2 mg/kg body weight). All drugs were administered intravenously. Resting heart rate was significantly reduced from 100 +/- 6.5 beats/min to 72 +/- 2.5 beats/min (P less than 0.005) after clinical and laboratory control of the disease. After double blockade, intrinsic heart rate was reduced from 105 +/- 6.8 beats/min before treatment to 98 +/- 6.0 beats/min after treatment (P less than 0.025). The reduction in heart rate caused by propranolol was not significantly different before (-13 +/- 1.4 beats/min) and after (-9 +/- 1.0 beats/min) propylthiouracil. In contrast, atropine induced a higher elevation of heart rate after treatment (45 +/- 8.6 beats/min) than before treatment (26 +/- 4.0 beats/min). The present results suggest no appreciable participation of the sympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system in the tachycardia of hyperthyroidism, at least under the conditions of the present study. The small change observed in intrinsic heart rate, although significant, seems to indicate that this is not the most important mechanism involved in this tachycardia. Our results suggest that an important reduction in the efferent activity of the parasympathetic component participates in the mechanisms that modify resting heart rte in hyperthyroidism.", 
    "72": "The effects of multiple dosing with 0.5% timolol maleate, 2% epinephrine hydrochloride, 4% pilocarpine hydrochloride, 1% vanadate, 1% forskolin (nonproprietary name, colforsin), or 0.5% prostaglandin F2 alpha on intraocular pressure (IOP) were each tested on eight cynomolgus monkey eyes in which glaucoma was induced by photocoagulating the trabecular meshwork with the argon laser. The week prior to drug therapy, baseline IOP measurements were carried out at hourly intervals from 9:30 am to 3:30 pm on three days. One to two days later, therapy was initiated. Each drug was applied topically to both eyes of each monkey twice daily for at least four days. The IOP was measured with a calibrated pneumatonometer at the same hourly intervals on treatment days as on the baseline days. The IOP at each time of day on treatment days was compared with the average baseline IOP measured at the corresponding time of day. Topical application of timolol, epinephrine, pilocarpine, vanadate, and prostaglandin F2 alpha significantly reduced IOP without evidence of tolerance or tachyphylaxis during the course of therapy. Forskolin did not significantly decrease IOP after the second day of treatment.", 
    "73": "Abrupt withdrawal of adrenergic blockers in a hypertensive subject may result in acute hypertensive crisis. This crisis results from marked increase in adrenergic discharge and upregulation of adrenoceptors. In a patient with hypertensive crisis following abrupt cessation of clonidine hydrochloride and metoprolol tartrate, intravenous administration of labetalol hydrochloride rapidly reduced blood pressure and heart rate to precrisis levels. The patient was subsequently maintained in a normotensive state by continued oral use of labetalol. This case study demonstrates that alpha- and beta-blocking activities of labetalol may be particularly beneficial in a hyperadrenergic state following abrupt withdrawal of adrenergic blockers.", 
    "74": "Continuous infusions of verapamil and diltiazem were established in halothane-anesthetized dogs (1.15-1.35% end tidal concentration) with or without a concomitant propranolol infusion to investigate changes: in cardiovascular function, in reflex activation as reflected in circulating catecholamine levels, and in the chronotropic response to the exogenously administered beta agonist, isoproterenol. Verapamil plasma levels of approximately 100 and 250 ng X ml-1, diltiazem plasma levels of approximately 140 and 325 ng X ml-1, and propranolol levels of approximately 70 ng X ml-1 were tolerated individually in the presence of halothane, although atrioventricular conduction was prolonged in the verapamil and diltiazem groups. Catecholamine levels were increased in the high verapamil group. However, when propranolol was combined with the lower levels of verapamil or diltiazem, the result was decreased heart rate, blood pressure, left ventricular maximum rate of tension development (dP/dt), and cardiac index with increased systemic vascular resistance. When the attempt was made to proceed to the increased plasma levels of verapamil or diltiazem in the presence of propranolol, 6/6 animals in the verapamil-propranolol group and 4/6 animals in the diltiazem-propranolol group were unable to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure of greater than 50 mmHg, and many developed 2 degrees or higher heart block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "Although endothelial cell (EC)-dependent relaxation has been described in most mammals, there have been no detailed reports of its existence in humans. Consequently, we evaluated human pulmonary artery segments taken from uninvolved regions of resected lung from 11 patients. EC removal did not significantly alter relaxation to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). However, relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh) was observed only in segments with EC. Preincubation with either 1 microM propranolol or 10 microM indomethacin failed to block relaxation, but the addition of either 30 microM quinacrine hydrochloride or 100 microM nordihydroguaiaretic acid prevented it entirely. EC-dependent relaxation to ATP was also demonstrated. These data demonstrate that EC-dependent relaxation occurs in human pulmonary arteries. Neither beta-adrenergic pathways nor prostaglandin intermediaries are utilized. An oxidized breakdown product of arachidonic or some other fatty acid from EC phospholipid appears to be involved. These data suggest that interactions between endothelium and smooth muscle may be important in modulating tone in the vessel wall and that damage to the endothelium may play a role in the development of pulmonary hypertension in humans.", 
    "76": "The electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic effects, clinical efficacy and safety of intravenous and oral nadolol therapy were examined in 34 patients with recurrent supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVT) undergoing electrophysiologic evaluation. Programmed electrical stimulation was performed in the control (drug-free) state, after infusion of intravenous nadolol (mean dose 0.09 +/- 0.03 mg/kg) and after chronic oral nadolol therapy in patients who responded to intravenous nadolol (mean dose 83 +/- 12 mg for 5 days). Intravenous nadolol administration prolonged mean sinus cycle length (p = 0.009), mean PR interval (p = 0.001) and mean AH interval (p = 0.001), with no significant electrophysiologic effects in the atrium, ventricle or accessory bypass tracts. Oral nadolol had similar electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic effects, but of lesser magnitude. Intravenous nadolol resulted in complete suppression of induced SVT in 78% of patients with sinus and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and 11% of patients with atrioventricular (AV) reentrant tachycardia (p less than 0.001). Partial responses were frequent in intraatrial or AV reentrant tachycardia (37%). Oral nadolol suppressed induction of SVT in patients who responded to intravenous nadolol. Adverse reactions to intravenous and oral nadolol were infrequent--6% and 8%, respectively--and usually did not require drug withdrawal. Intravenous nadolol is highly effective in sinus and AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, and a successful electrophysiologic response to it predicts efficacy of long-term oral nadolol therapy. It has limited efficacy alone in AV reentrant tachycardia and should be considered in combination with other antiarrhythmic therapy in this type of SVT.", 
    "77": "The effect of low level lead poisoning on the carotid sinus reflex in rats was studied. The reflex was evoked by carotid artery clamping, in control and lead-poisoned animals. Wistar rats were given lead acetate trihydrate (50 mg/kg) via stomach tube once weekly for 5 weeks; control animals were given equimolar amounts of sodium acetate. Both groups were fed a regular animal food diet. At the end of the 6th week, and under urethane anesthesia, mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were continuously recorded for both groups, before and after clamping, and after unclamping the left common carotid artery. In other experiments, some animals were pre-treated with dopamine, 0.040 mg/kg; practolol, 3 mg/kg; propranolol, 0.1 mg/kg; or atropine, 0.1 mg/kg. In animals not given drugs, lead produced a less pronounced rise in mean arterial blood pressure after clamping, and a more pronounced decrease in heart rate after unclamping, compared to control animals. Some drugs altered this response pattern. Atropine led to a more pronounced tachycardia in the lead-poisoned rats, whereas practolol led to a more pronounced bradycardia in the lead-poisoned rats. Propranolol pretreatment led to a less pronounced decrease in heart rate for lead-poisoned rats, again as compared to the controls. Atropine and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents produced similar carotid sinus reflex responses in control and lead-poisoned animals.", 
    "78": "In vivo treatment of rats with beta-diethylaminoethyl-diphenylpropylacetate hydrochloride (SKF 525A), an inhibitor of hepatic monooxygenases, decreases the serum binding of oxprenolol and propranolol, which bind mainly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, but not that of phenytoin, which is bound to albumin. The effect was maximal 40 min after treatment and had disappeared after 6 hr, when enzyme inhibition was still present. A displacing effect was also observed when SKF 525A was added in vitro to serum of rats, dogs and humans and to human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, whereas binding to human serum albumin was not affected. SKF 525A was found to be equipotent with tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate, a known displacer of binding of drugs from alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. When studying the pharmacokinetics or the effects of drugs after SKF 525A pretreatment, the possibility that altered protein binding may influence the findings should be considered.", 
    "79": "The authors studied the single-pass pulmonary extraction of the potent local anesthetic, bupivacaine, in 21 anesthetized rabbits. Pulmonary extraction of [3H]bupivacaine and [14C]5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was quantified from multiple indicator-dilution outflow curves using indocyanine green as the intravascular reference substance. Pulmonary extraction at control (n = 15; mean +/- S.D.) was 81 +/- 6 and 78 +/- 9% for [3H]bupivacaine and [14C]5-HT, respectively. The apparent volume of distribution of bupivacaine was 38 +/- 9 ml/kg compared with 12 +/- 4 ml/kg for indocyanine green. Simultaneous administration of up to 300 micrograms/kg of bupivacaine did not affect the disposition of either radiolabeled amine; however, injection of 1000 micrograms/kg of bupivacaine significantly (P less than .01) depressed pulmonary extraction of both [3H]bupivacaine and [14C]5-HT. In the presence of 1000 micrograms/kg bupivacaine, the apparent volume of distribution of [3H]bupivacaine decreased to 24 +/- 9 ml/kg (P less than .01). Fifteen minutes after administration of propranolol (100-250 micrograms/kg i.v.), [14C]5-HT removal was unchanged, but the pulmonary extraction of [3H]bupivacaine was significantly decreased to 70 +/- 12% (n = 6; P less than .01). These data suggest that bupivacaine is extensively removed as it enters the lung and that the removal process is a combination of passive diffusion and a small component of saturable specific binding. The interaction of bupivacaine with 5-HT may be part of this specific binding (i.e., endothelial cell uptake) or may have been secondary to direct effects of large concentrations of bupivacaine on membrane function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "80": "beta-Adrenergic blockade has been clinically associated with vascular occlusion. Because neutrophil activation, either alone or in concert with other blood cells, can induce vaso-occlusion by aggregation, leukoembolization, and inflammatory damage to vascular endothelium, we studied the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on neutrophil activation in vitro and on microvascular integrity in vivo. beta-Adrenergic antagonists, propranolol and alprenolol, could induce dose-related and stereospecific activation of human neutrophils resulting in granulocyte aggregation and migration. Propranolol produced de novo aggregation and also enhanced responses to chemotaxins, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and C5a. Lysosomal exocytosis was unaffected by beta blockers. In partial explanation of the enhancement of granulocyte activation by beta blockade, we observed that propranolol produced enhanced expression and affinity of granulocyte surface receptors for tritiated N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. This enhanced activation of human granulocytes by beta blockers was manifest in vivo as augmented inflammatory dermal edema. Enhanced granulocyte activation by beta blockade may induce microvascular disruption and subsequent tissue inflammation.", 
    "81": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether alpha- or beta-adrenergic influences directly modulate the rate of spontaneous ventricular tachycardia occurring 24 hours after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Chloralose-anesthetized, open chest dogs (n = 41) with ventricular tachycardia were studied. The left anterior descending artery was cannulated distally. Neither intracoronary saline solution nor phenylephrine (0.3 to 12 micrograms) changed the rate of ventricular tachycardia; however, isoproterenol (0.01 to 10 micrograms) produced dose-dependent increases in the rate. In six dogs, metoprolol, 5 mg given intravenously, slowed ventricular tachycardia from 174 +/- 10 (mean +/- SE) to 140 +/- 17 beats/min (p less than 0.05). This was accompanied by decreases in mean arterial pressure from 106 +/- 7 to 95 +/- 8 mm Hg, cardiac output from 2.6 +/- 0.3 to 1.6 +/- 0.3 liters/min and prolongation of atrioventricular conduction from 134 +/- 10 to 189 +/- 29 ms (all p less than 0.05) during atrial pacing at a cycle length of 300 ms. In 10 dogs, metoprolol (0.5 mg) given intracoronary, a dose that shifted the isoproterenol dose-response curve to the right, slowed ventricular tachycardia from 174 +/- 7.2 to 140 +/- 9.7 beats/min (p less than 0.05) without hemodynamic changes. Additional metoprolol (4.5 mg) given intravenously produced hemodynamic alterations, but ventricular tachycardia did not slow further. Therefore, beta- but not alpha-adrenergic influences control the rate of ventricular tachycardia occurring 24 hours after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Furthermore, beta-adrenergic blockade slows ventricular tachycardia solely by a direct electrophysiologic effect on the tachycardia foci and not indirectly as a result of hemodynamic effects.", 
    "82": "Perivascular nerve fibers containing neuropeptide Y (NPY)-like immunoreactivity were identified around cerebral blood vessels of human, cat, guinea pig, rat, and mouse. The major cerebral arteries were invested by dense plexuses; veins, small arteries, and arterioles were accompanied by few fibers. Removal of the superior cervical ganglion resulted in a reduction of NPY-like material in pial vessels and dura mater. Pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine or reserpine reduced the number of visible NPY fibers and the concentration of NPY in rat cerebral vessels. Sequential immunostaining with antibodies toward dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) (an enzyme involved in the synthesis of noradrenaline) and NPY revealed an identical localization of DBH and NPY in nerve cell bodies in the superior cervical ganglion and in perivascular fibers of pial blood vessels, suggesting their coexistence. Administration of NPY in vitro resulted in concentration-dependent contractions that were not modified by a sympathectomy. The contractions induced by noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and prostaglandin F2 alpha and the dilator responses to calcitonin gene-related peptide were not modified by NPY in rat cerebral arteries. However, the constrictor response to NPY was reduced by 70% in the presence of the calcium entry blocker nifedipine, and abolished following incubation in a calcium-free buffer. These data suggest an interaction of NPY at a postsynaptic site, which for induction of contraction may open calcium channels in the sarcolemma of cerebral arteries."
