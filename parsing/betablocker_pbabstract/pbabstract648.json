    "0": "The controlled, open, cross-over study reported in this article demonstrates that sotalol and propranolol administered twice daily to 20 patients provide an equally satisfactory control of moderately elevated blood-pressure for 24 hours. The average daily dose of sotalol and propranolol required to achieve this effect was 200 +/- 95 mg and 154 +/- 90 mg respectively. No important side-effects were observed.", 
    "1": "In eight subjects, plasma concentrations of isosorbide dinitrate and its mononitrates after oral administration of 10 mg isosorbide dinitrate were measured on two occasions, once with and once without previous administration of a single dose of atenolol 100 mg. There were no significant changes either in plasma concentration at different times after administration, or in peak plasma concentrations or in area under the curve of the isosorbide dinitrate and mononitrates.", 
    "2": "The authors have performed a between-patient study in 76 patients with mild or moderate essential arterial hypertension, with the aim of comparing the results of atenolol 100 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg + amiloride 5 mg 1 tablet daily, and the combination of the above two agents at the same daily doses. Thirty-one patients received the free combination diuretic-beta-blocker throughout the study period; 26 patients non-responders to atenolol 100 mg daily (supine diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg) after a one-month treatment period received the above combination for a further four months; and 19 patients non-responders to hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg + amiloride 5 mg, 1 tablet daily, after a one-month treatment period received the above combination for a further four months. In the patients who were non-responders to either atenolol or the diuretic, supine and upright blood pressure showed a further and clinically consistent decrease as a result of the combination therapy. A similar consistent decrease was seen in the patients receiving the combination therapy throughout the study. Plasma levels of glucose, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium and uric acid were not modified either by the single agents or during administration of the combination therapy. In particular, plasma potassium concentration did not show any statistical or clinical changes. Any side-effects were of little clinical importance and never required discontinuation of therapy. In conclusion, atenolol combined with hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride (100 mg + 50 mg + 5 mg) provides an effective and well tolerated blood pressure control in most patients with mild or moderate arterial hypertension, including non-responders to diuretic or beta-blocker alone.", 
    "3": "Twenty hypertensive outpatients WHO stage I or II, with supine diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mmHg at the end of a 4-week treatment period with atenolol (Tenormin) 100 mg daily, continued atenolol in free association with half a tablet of Moduretic (i.e., hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg + amiloride 2.5 mg) for a further 4 weeks. Atenolol monotherapy induced a drop of systolic blood pressure from 175.0 +/- 11 (mean +/- s.d.) mmHg to 158.7 +/- 6 mmHg (p less than 0.01), and of diastolic blood pressure from 113.5 +/- 8 mmHg to 102.7 +/- 5 mmHg (p less than 0.01). After 4 weeks with atenolol in association with half a tablet of Moduretic, systolic blood pressure further decreased to 145.7 +/- 8 mmHg (p less than 0.01), and diastolic blood pressure to 90.2 +/- 10 mmHg (p less than 0.01). Seven out of 20 patients remained with diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mmHg despite the above combination therapy. In these patients, the doubling of diuretic dose (hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg + amiloride 5 mg) in combination with atenolol resulted in a further drop in systolic pressure (to 142.1 +/- 9 mmHg) and diastolic (to 92.1 +/- 6 mmHg) (both p less than 0.01). Plasma potassium concentration showed a slight and non-significant increase during atenolol monotherapy (from 4.4 +/- 0.5 mEq/l to 4.6 +/- 0.7 mEq/l; n.s.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "The influence of different doses of bradykinin (2.5 micrograms, 5 micrograms/kg i.v.) and dopamine (0.5 micrograms - a small dose and 25 micrograms, 250 micrograms/kg i.v. - a big dose) administered into the rat femoral artery on the blood pressure was estimated. Dopamine evoked hypotension (the small dose) or hypertension (the big dose). Bradykinin evoked dose-dependent decrease of the blood pressure. Bradykinin (2.5 micrograms/kg i.v.) administered in the 45th sec of the dopamine action enhanced the hypertensive effect and decreased the hypotensive effect of dopamine. Dopamine administered in the big dose after phentolamine and propranolol evoked hypotension. This effect was stronger after administration of dopamine (25 micrograms/kg i.v.). The hypotensive action of bradykinin persisted in spite of phentolamine and propranolol application but this peptide did not change the hypotensive effect of dopamine under these conditions. The authors discuss hypothetical mechanism of action of the observed influence of bradykinin on the effect of dopamine in the circulatory system.", 
    "5": "Twenty-seven patients with moderate to moderately severe hypertension who had not responded optimally to treatment with a standard step 2 regimen were treated with a three-drug regimen of hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, and guanadrel. The addition of guanadrel reduced blood pressure to levels significantly below those achieved by the step 2 regimen. The achievement of normotensive blood pressure levels was accompanied by a decrease in the number of adverse effects reported.", 
    "6": "Thirty patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ChOPD) and concomitant ischemic heart disease (IHD) were studied that were admitted to the clinic for the treatment of a recurrence of the basic disease within the period 1981-1982. The patients were grouped into three groups of 10 patients and each group was treated for a period of 14 days, as follows: group 1--10 patients were given only sectral 50 mg per os during the first week and 10 mg/day during the second week; group II--treated with falicard, 5 mg daily, intravenously, for one week and later 2 X 5 mg, intravenously--the second week; group III, received sectral--50-100 mg/day after 5 mg falicard intravenously. Best results, manifested with a reduction of the paroxysms of dyspnea and stenocardia, were obtained in group III, suggesting the advantage of the combined effect with cardioselective beta-blockers and Ca-antagonists in the patients with ChOPD and concomitant IHD.", 
    "7": "This study reports the results that were obtained in 56 cases of arterial hypertension in pregnancy solely by beta-blocking with Atenolol or Labetalol. Any pregnant woman whose arterial blood pressure rises to or exceeds 140/90 mm mercury in two successive examinations at intervals of 8 days with rest is considered to be hypertensive. As soon as treatment is started mothers' supervision is assured regularly by clinical and biological examinations and the dose of drug is adapted to each case. Fetal monitoring is ensured by ultrasound, cardiac rhythm tracings and hormone estimations. As far as the newborn is concerned, blood sugar and electrocardiogram measurements are taken to add to the normal examination at birth. Finally plasma levels of beta-blockers are estimated at birth in the mother and in the cord blood. The analysis of these results shows: for the mother: a fairly constant antihypertensive effect which is about the same for either drug in pregnancy. Further complementary injection therapy was needed, however, in 8 cases in labour. There were alterations in the method of delivery and in particular the Caesarean section rate rose to 12.5% and induction had to be carried out more frequently, triggered off by the slightest sign of fetal distress. As far as the child was concerned: 2 died in utero, the Apgar score was comparable to a control series, there was no bradycardia or broncho-spasm or teratogenic effect, mean weight at birth was significantly higher with Labetalol (3280 g +/- 555) than with Atenolol (2750 g +/- 630), the blood sugar levels at birth were in six cases lower than 1.4 mmol (0.25 g/l) but these were easily pu right by transfusion. The plasma levels of beta-blockers showed that there was a linear relationship between the maternal and fetal concentrations which confirmed that the two molecules pass through the placenta. This study confirms therefore that it is worth while using beta-blockers in cases of hypertension in pregnancy so long as careful observation is carried out, and it seems that the alpha constituent of Labetalol has advantages over the other.", 
    "8": "The effects of a short-time serial stimulation of the locus coeruleus (LC) on cobalt-induced focal epileptiform activity were investigated in unrestrained rats with chronically implanted electrodes. The results show a marked reduction of the spike-wave activity immediately after stimulation. The characteristic groups of \"cobalt-spikes\" are completely suppressed within 30 s and significantly reduced up to 120 s. This suppression was partly antagonized by pretreatment with the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol (2-5 mg/kg i.p.). On the other hand, the stimulation of other areas, lateral or medial of the LC (n. parabrachialis; stratum griseum centrale), reduced the spike-discharges only insignificantly. These data support the hypothesis that the noradrenergic system play an important inhibitory role in epileptiform activity.", 
    "9": "The effect on systolic blood pressure and heart rate of the acute and chronic intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of d- and dl-propranolol was investigated on unanesthetised spontaneously hypertensive rats. The effect of naloxone on the propranolol induced hypotension was also studied to test the hypothesis that the antihypertensive effect of propranolol involves the release of an endogenous opiate. On i.p. administration, 3 mg/kg d-propranolol was inactive; 3 and 30 mg/kg dl-propranolol decreased blood pressure and heart rate in a dose-dependent manner. When the rats were pretreated with 2 mg/kg naloxone i.p., the effect of propranolol on the blood pressure was nearly completely abolished, while that on the heart rate was only partially blocked. Chronic administration of dl-propranolol (30 mg/kg b.i.d.) to spontaneously hypertensive rats from the age of 6 weeks (prehypertensive phase) for 29 days prevented the development of hypertension while the rats treated with physiological saline for 29 days (control group) developed hypertension. Naloxone (2 mg/kg i.p.) administered on the 29th day to chronically treated rats induced a reversal of the propranolol action on systolic blood pressure and heart rate, i.e., blood pressure and heart rate increased. Naloxone had no such effect in the control group. We suggest that the release of an endogenous opioid contributes to the acute and chronic antihypertensive action of i.p. propranolol in spontaneously hypertensive rats and that the secretion of endogenous opioids participating in the control of cardiovascular functions is influenced by adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "10": "In cats anaesthetized with chloralose and urethane we studied the effect of the selective beta 1 adrenergic blocking practolol and the non-selective beta 1-2 adrenergic blocking pindolol on the intestinal motility, the efferent sympathetic activity, arterial blood pressure and heart-rate. We compared the effects of trifluperidol on the intestinal tone, the intestinal motility and its duration with those of trifluperidol and practolol combined. It was found that 1-, 2-, and 3 mg/kg of practolol given intravenously had no influence on the spontaneous electric activity of postganglionic fibres of the splanchnic or hypogastric nerves, thus it had no central effect. Accordingly, its site of effect proved to be peripheric. Its administration was associated with a slight decrease of the arterial blood pressure and heart rate. The intestinal tone was instantly increased depending on the does in every case. In two-thirds of our experiments the intestinal motility was restored 1 to 3 minutes following administration depending on the dose. Combined with trifluperidol, practolol produces a further increase in the enhancing activity of trifluperidol on the intestinal tone and motility. It considerably extends the duration of the action of trifluperidol on the intestinal motility. Pindolol increases the intestinal tone and motility dose-dependently in every case, reduces the efferent sympathetic activity, which is inversely proportional to the dose. The action is most pronounced on administration of 0.125 micrograms/kg of pindolol intravenously but it cannot be observed with a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. No significant changes were observed in blood pressure but there was a reduction in heart rate. The action of pindolol is supposed to be both central and peripheral in nature.", 
    "11": "Twenty pregnant women with mild to moderate hypertension were treated with either methyldopa or acebutolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent with cardioselectivity and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, in a prospective open study. The two groups were comparable, although some selection bias may have been present. The dose of either drug was adjusted to attain a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg or less, and 2 of the acebutolol group and 1 of the methyldopa group required the addition of hydralazine to achieve this. There were no still births or neo-natal deaths in either group. There was no difference discernible between the groups in duration of pregnancy, birth weight. Apgar score or placental weight, and no evidence of bradycardia, hypoglycaemia or respiratory difficulty in the babies born to mothers taking acebutolol. Fewer side-effects seemed to be present in the acebutolol group, and the mean period of hospitalization during pregnancy was 8 days in these patients compared with 14 days in the methyldopa group (p less than 0.01). The results of this pilot study suggest that acebutolol warrants further investigation as an effective and well-tolerated treatment of hypertension in pregnancy.", 
    "12": "The local effect of autonomic blocking agents on the resting cerebral blood flow of anaesthetized rats was investigated in 78 anatomical structures. The existence of an alpha-adrenergic vascular tone was indicated by the average flow increase of 28 +/- 3% and 17 +/- 3% after the administration of the alpha-receptor blocking agents phenoxybenzamine (56 mg/kg i.p.) and phentolamine (1 mg/kg i.v.), respectively. The injection of atropine (1 mg/kg i.v.) increased the average blood flow by 19 +/- 2%, whereas the overall effect of the beta-blocking agent propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) was statistically not significant. The magnitude of local blood flow changes in specific cerebral areas exhibited considerable variation in all experimental groups. The comparison of individual and overall flow changes suggests that some of the discrepancies among different investigations could have resulted from the intraindividual heterogeneity of evoked flow changes.", 
    "13": "Fibrinopeptides A and B potentiate the hypertensive action of dopamine in the rat and potentiate its hypotensive effects after alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade. Dopamine receptor blockade with haloperidol completely abolished the effects of FAB. The possible mechanism of the observed effects is discussed.", 
    "14": "The antiarrhythmic effect of slow-release disopyramide phosphate (DR) 300 mg twice daily and of long-acting propranolol (PR) 1 X 160 mg daily was compared in a randomized cross-over study in patients with premature ventricular beats (PVB). 12 patients with PVB (Lown Classes II-V) were given: placebo I for 3 days, DR or PR for 7 days, placebo II for 5 days and PR or DR for 7 days. During each study phase Holter-ECG recordings were taken over a period of 24 h. With DR 6 patients showed a positive qualitative effect, improving by at least one Lown class, whereas only 2 patients did so with PR. With DR reduction of PVB greater than 80% occurred in 7 patients, and with PR in 2 patients. In all patients with any reduction in PVB, the median decrease was 85% with DR and 59% with PR. The overall results suggest that the antiarrhythmic effect of disopyramide phosphate in the slow-release preparation is at least satisfactory and comparable to that of disopyramide phosphate in the standard capsule formulation given in the usual and more complicated regime of four divided doses. The antiarrhythmic effect of PR in the recommended dose as given was not convincing.", 
    "15": "Fifteen mild to moderate hypertensives were submitted to exercise testing using a bicycle ergometer with a fixed load. Heart rate, blood pressure and ECG were recorded throughout 5 min exercise and 10 min recovery. Oxygen uptake was measured during the final minute of exercise and blood glucose estimation and serum drug levels assessed 5 min after recovery. The above measurements were made after exactly 24 h following seven days administration of 160 mg of long acting (L.A.) propranolol, 200 mg of sustained action (S.A.) metoprolol and two matched placebos. Propranolol L.A. was superior to Metoprolol S.A. in the reduction of exercise induced tachycardia and both drugs were significantly superior to placebos. Both drugs were effective agents for the lowering of resting blood pressure after 24 h but propranolol L.A. was more effective in the lowering of systolic peaks observed during exercise. There was no significant effect upon oxygen uptake and blood glucose. The incidence of side effects was low and showed no significant difference from placebo.", 
    "16": "Fourteen men with moderately severe essential hypertension were treated with prizidilol hydrochloride 400-700 mg once daily (mean +/- S.D. 612 +/- 56 mg/day). The study was open and ambulatory, with an initial placebo period followed by dose titration of prizidilol. Prior to treatment and during optimal control of blood pressure cardiovascular adaptation was examined in a submaximal exercise test. Plethysomographic assessment of vascular flow, resistance and tone in the calf musculature during supine rest and during maximal vasodilatation was also performed. A highly significant reduction in systolic (from 164 +/- 4.5 to 141 +/- 2.7 mmHg; p less than 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (from 105 +/- 1.6 to 87 +/- 1.3 mmHg; p less than 0.001) at supine rest was noted during therapy with prizidilol. There was no significant change in heart rate. Systolic pressure in the standing position was reduced (from 159 +/- 4.2 to 139 +/- 2.9 mmHg; p less than 0.001) and so was the diastolic pressure (from 111 +/- 2.5 to 95 +/- 1.9 mmHg; p less than 0.001). The heart rate in the standing position was significantly increased compared to supine rest in the placebo period and during optimal treatment with prizidilol. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties of prizidilol were apparent as a reduction in the exercise-induced heart rate response at even the lowest work load. During prizidilol therapy an increase in resting calf muscle blood flow was found from 3.1 +/- 1.5 ml/min X 100 ml to 4.3 +/- 2.1 ml/min X 100 ml (p less than 0.025). Vascular resistance and vascular tone were significantly reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "In 19 men aged 50 with essential hypertension, 18 weeks' treatment with atenolol (n = 9) or oxprenolol (n = 10) increased supine plasma free dopamine concentrations by 78% (p less than 0.05) and 121% (p less than 0.001) respectively. Increments in plasma dopamine were observed in all patients except for one treated with atenolol. Supine peripheral venous adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations were not influenced by beta-blockade. The mechanism and significance of the present elevation of plasma free dopamine by beta-blockade are unknown. However, increased plasma free dopamine may be involved in the hypotensive effect of chronic beta-adrenergic blockade, both beta-1 selective and non-selective, and may lend further support to decreased dopaminergic activity in essential hypertension.", 
    "18": "A case of massive metoprolol poisoning (50 g) is described. Clinical signs included coma, seizures, hypoventilation, unmeasurable blood pressure, nodal bradycardia, and metabolic acidosis. Treatment comprised intubation, assisted ventilation, gastric lavage, atropine, bicarbonate, glucagon and repeated doses of prenalterol (a total of 160 mg over 15 hours). Prenalterol dosage was simple and could be guided by blood pressure response. Pacemaker treatment was not required. Ethanol concentration was 50 mmol/l (2.4%) on admission. Plasma metoprolol was 68 mumol/l (18 000 ng/ml) 2 hours after admission. The patient was awake after 15 hours.", 
    "19": "The haemodynamic effects of prenalterol, a new beta-1 agonist, were studied in 10 patients with chronic heart failure. Following intravenous prenalterol infusions of 1 mg, 2.5 mg and 5 mg at 15 min intervals, oral slow release prenalterol 20 mg, 30 mg and 50 mg was given at 2 h intervals and then 50-100 mg bid for one month. There were no significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure. Cardiac output increased significantly from control of 4.4 +/- 0.91/min to a maximum of 5.8 +/- 1.81/min (p less than 0.01) following the 5 mg prenalterol infusion and this increase was maintained following oral prenalterol on Days 1 and 2 and at 1 month. Significant increases in stroke volume and stroke work indices and reduction in systemic vascular resistance were also observed. Maximum increases in cardiac output and stroke work index following intravenous prenalterol correlated significantly with maximum increases observed following oral prenalterol on Day 2. Non-invasive evaluation showed no change in echocardiographic left ventricular end-diastolic dimension but a significant reduction in left ventricular end-systolic dimension on Day 30. PEP/LVET was significantly reduced from control of 0.56 +/- 0.15 to 0.47 +/- 0.12 (p less than 0.05) on Day 2 and 0.49 +/- 0.09 (p less than 0.05) at 1 month. Treadmill exercise duration was significantly improved for the group at 1 month and no adverse effects were noted. Oral slow release prenalterol is a potentially useful new drug for patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "20": "The present study was done to establish the dose-response relationships for effects on heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, tolerance and plasma disappearance kinetics after large intravenous and oral doses of penbutolol. Twelve healthy volunteers were randomly allocated to receive penbutolol (n = 8) or placebo (n = 4) in this single blind, placebo-controlled investigation. The degree of beta-blockade was measured by standarized exercise tests at work loads selected to produce a heart rate of 150/min without treatment. Penbutolol was given as single i.v. doses of 3, 6 and 12 mg and as 40, 80 and 120 mg once daily for one week, measurements being made 2 and 24 h after the last dose. Penbutolol i.v. did not influence the resting heart rate but it did reduce resting systolic blood pressure in a non-dose dependent manner. Exercise heart rate and systolic pressure were lowered by all the intravenous doses. All oral doses of penbutolol lowered exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure to the same extent. The reductions in exercise tachycardia was still present after 24 h. After i.v. administration t1/2 was approximately 1.2 h and the volume of distribution was 32-421. All doses were well tolerated.", 
    "21": "The antihypertensive effect of the peripheral vasodilator diazoxide in 13 patients and the alpha-beta adrenoceptor blocking agent labetalol in 12 patients were compared in 46 severe acute hypertensive episodes during haemodialysis. A single dose of diazoxide 150 mg or labetalol 50 mg was effective in 74% and 70% of the hypertensive episodes, respectively. In the diazoxide-treated patients blood pressure fell from 192 +/- 3/115 +/- 4 mmHg to 141 +/- 8/85 +/- 4 mmHg 2 h after injection. In 7 hypertensive episodes a second dose of diazoxide 150 mg was given 60 +/- 11 min after the first injection. The reduction in mean arterial blood pressure at the end of haemodialysis was 21.5 +/- 2.6% in patients treated with a single dose and 24.8 +/- 3.5% in patients treated with the repeated dose of diazoxide. In the labetalol-treated patients blood pressure in 17 instances fell from 198 +/- 5/104 +/- 4 mmHg to 143 +/- 7/89 +/- 5 mmHg 180 min following injection of labetalol 50 mg. In 6 episodes a second dose labetalol 50 mg was given 41 +/- 9 min after the first injection. At the end of haemodialysis the decrease in mean arterial blood pressure was 17.2% in patients treated with a single dose and 18 +/- 5% in patients given the repeated dose of labetalol. The reduction in blood pressure caused by diazoxide was slightly greater than that due to labetalol. At the end of haemodialysis the percentage reduction in mean arterial blood pressure was 23 +/- 2% in the diazoxide-treated group and 17 +/- 2% after labetalol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "The effect of long-term treatment with alprenolol on left ventricular function was investigated in a controlled double-blind study of 15 patients with ischaemic heart disease (alprenolol 6, placebo 9), by measurement of systolic time intervals (STI). Significant prolongation of QS2I was observed in patients treated with alprenolol (p less than 0.05), while changes in PEPI, LVETI and PEP/LVET were all insignificant. The heart rate x systolic blood pressure product (RPP) was significantly reduced in the alprenolol group (p less than 0.05). The data suggest that long-term treatment with alprenolol did not impair left ventricular function as evaluated by STI, and that myocardial oxygen demand, assessed by RPP, was reduced during the treatment.", 
    "23": "The pharmacokinetics of propranolol (P) and its major metabolites, propranolol glucuronide (PGLUC), 4-hydroxypropranolol (4OHP), 4-hydroxypropranolol glucuronide (4OHPGLUC) and naphthoxylactic acid (NLA), (Walle et al. 1972) were determined, whenever possible, in the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy in thirteen patients and also when these patients were at least three months post-partum. No correlations were found between the mean arterial blood pressure (post-therapy) or the fall in blood pressure as a result of the P therapy (p much greater than 0.05) and P dose, peak P plasma concentrations, peak 4-hydroxypropranolol (4OHP) plasma concentrations or peak (P plus 4OHP) plasma concentrations. However, a positive nonlinear relationship was found between the daily P dose (independent variable) and peak P plasma concentrations over the daily dose range 30-160 mg/day. The elimination half-lives of NLA for patients in the third trimester of pregnancy were significantly shorter (p = 0.072, df = 13) than those when the patients were at least three months post-partum. Also, the areas under the plasma level-time curves of NLA were significantly less (p less than 0.05, df = 13) for patients in the third trimester of pregnancy than when these patients were at least three months post-partum. The results of this study indicate that the pharmacokinetics of P, PGLUC, 4OHP and 4OHPGLUC are not significantly altered by pregnancy. However, the kinetics of NLA do appear to be altered. The formation of NLA by N-dealkylation of P and further oxidation, appears to be competitively inhibited by unidentified substances, perhaps endogenous steroids, especially in the third trimester when compared to at least three months post-partum.", 
    "24": "The Rosin Rammler Sperling Weibull distribution and its use in the analysis of complex data is explained with reference to metoprolol and acebutolol AUC values and isoniazid plasma concentrations. The technique is then applied to sparteine and debrisoquine data to resolve populations into distinct sub-groups. Goodness of fit is measured by applying the chi 2 test to the untransformed data. The method is simple to use and sub-groups can be identified rapidly. Each sub-group can be characterised by a simple exponential equation.", 
    "25": "The unbound fraction of propranolol was found to vary from 1.9 to 13.2% in 434 plasma samples from members of 132 families. As expected, there was a linear correlation between the ratio of bound/unbound propranolol and the orosomucoid concentration (r = 0.67, P less than 0.001). Albumin concentration did not influence propranolol binding. The unbound fraction was negatively correlated with obesity and alcohol intake, but was not significantly influenced by age and sex. By applying path analysis, 21% of the variability in propranolol binding could be ascribed to genetic factors and 5% to common environmental factors.", 
    "26": "In an experimental study, the influence of propranolol on myocardial uptake of radioiodinated heptadecanoic acid (131I-HDA) and thallium-201 (201Tl) in the dog heart was assessed. Uptake of 131I-HDA and 201Tl was evaluated in ten control dogs and in ten dogs 20 min after IV administration of propranolol (0.15 mg/kg). In both groups, four healthy dogs were studied and six dogs were studied after coronary artery occlusion. It was shown that both total uptake of 131I-HDA and 201Tl did not alter significantly, regardless of significant changes in hemodynamic parameters and total arterial plasma FFA levels. However, distribution of both 131I-HDA and 201Tl was markedly affected by propranolol, since the endocardial to epicardial ratio showed significantly higher values in the ischemic myocardial regions. The results of our study indicate that propranolol (1) preserves myocardial perfusion in the normal and acutely ischemic dog heart, and (2) gives a more favorable distribution in the ischemic myocardial region towards the subendocardial layers.", 
    "27": "A double-blind, crossover comparison of once-daily acebutolol (400 mg) and once-daily atenolol (100 mg) was carried out in 33 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After 8-weeks' treatment with acebutolol, the reduction (12%) in mean arterial pressure was, on average, slightly greater than that on atenolol (11%), but the difference was not significant. The mean 22-hour serum concentration of acebutolol plus its acetyl metabolite was 24% of the peak level, whereas that of atenolol was 12%. Routine laboratory monitoring showed no important changes. Acebutolol gave a statistically significant lesser reduction in pulse rate than atenolol, and a lesser incidence, approaching statistical significance (p less than 0.1), of side-effects.", 
    "28": "26 patients with moderate hypertension and no signs of heart failure were treated with metoprolol, labetalol or prazosin. Systolic time intervals (STI) were measured before and after several months of treatment. During treatment with metoprolol, a decrease in the preejection period index (PEPI), and preejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio (PEP/LVET), was found. During treatment with labetalol or prazosin, a minor decrease in PEPI was observed, so that a significant decrease in PEP/LVET was not obtained. A decrease in PEPI and PEP/LVET may be due to improved cardiac performance, but in the given type of patients it is more dependent on the reduction in afterload. The STI measurement is less sensitive in discerning different mechanisms involved in lowering the blood pressure and cannot therefore be used for selecting the optimal antihypertensive drug.", 
    "29": "Reflex heart rate (HR) responses to hypotension were studied in chronically instrumented fetal and newborn lambs. Studies spanned 106-141 days of gestation and 1-22 days after birth. Brief hypotensive stimuli (10 s) were produced by inflation of a cuff implanted around the inferior vena cava; HR and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded from a carotid arterial catheter. Autonomic nervous control of HR was examined using selective sympathetic beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol 1 mg/kg), cholinergic blockade (atropine 0.2-0.3 mg/kg), and total autonomic blockade (propranolol plus atropine). In newborn lambs (n = 4) HR increased progressively as MAP was reduced in the range 5-50%. Tachycardia during mild hypotension (less than 15% MAP fall) was due to sympathetic activation as it was abolished by propranolol. During severe hypotension (greater than 30% MAP fall) tachycardia was reduced by selective beta-adrenergic blockade and by cholinergic blockade, and totally abolished by total autonomic blockade; thus withdrawal of vagal tone plus augmentation of sympathetic activity contribute to the increase of HR in response to large MAP falls in the newborn. Fetal lambs (n = 4) responded with tachycardia in mild hypotension (less than 15% MAP fall) but this was reversed when hypotension was severe (greater than 30% MAP fall). The primary tachycardia was due to sympathetic activation and was indistinguishable from the newborn response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "Action potentials of constantly driven isolated trabeculae of the rabbit's atrial myocardium, being depressed by acetylcholine (ACh) at concentrations between 0.2 and 20 mumol/l, recovered during a constant drug application. The sensitivity of the atrial myocardium to ACh after a prolonged drug application was decreased but found to be restored about 7 min after switching off the ACh superfusion. The recovery during drug application was accelerated in Ca++ excess solutions but decelerated in K+ excess solutions. All the effects of ACh were blocked by atropine (1 mumol/l) completely. The results suggest that the muscarinic ACh receptor in the mammalian myocardium, responsible for the electrotropic effects, shows desensitization to ACh similar to the nicotinic receptor in other tissues.", 
    "31": "Stimulation of various peripheral nerve trunks evokes very similar compound postsynaptic potentials (PSP) composed of one or more excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) followed by fast and slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP) on the identified RPal neuron of Helix pomatia L. Evoked EPSPs were reduced or blocked by nicotine, atropine and d-tubocurarine. The two components of IPSP were different in their pharmacological sensitivity. Slow IPSP was partly or totally eliminated by ergometrine and chlorpromazine and was reduced by atropine, nicotine as well as by propranolol. Fast IPSP was reduced only in the presence of ergometrine and could not be blocked by either of the applied drugs. Participation of cholinergic transmission seems to be essential in the evoked EPSP but its partial involvement in the slow IPSP can also be supposed. A dopaminergic mechanism may take part in the generation of both components of IPSP but the receptors responsible for the slow IPSP were sensitive to other catecholamine antagonists as well, referring to a more complex origin, or to the involvement of an unknown transmitter. Comparison of PSPs evoked by stimulation of different nerves shows that presynaptic areas belonging to various peripheral sources are overlapped on the RPal neuron, and they probably act by similar transmitter substances.", 
    "32": "Anoxic cardiac arrest was studied for one hour in five groups of dogs. Groups I-III were given methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg b.w.) before aortic cross-clamping. Normothermia was used with electrically induced ventricular fibrillation in group I, and without such fibrillation in group II, while group III was studied in local hypothermia. Propranolol (10 micrograms/kg) was given to group IV and verapamil (0.2 mg/kg) to group V before the anoxic arrest in local hypothermia. Judged from the ability of the heart to take over the circulation after anoxic arrest, local cooling preceded by propranolol or verapamil gave working performance comparable with the pre-arrest values. In the cooled, steroid-pretreated hearts the work capacity was depressed to the same degree as in locally cooled hearts without steroid premedication. Methylprednisolone prevented ischemic contracture during normothermic arrest with induced fibrillation, but not in the absence of such fibrillation. As adjuvant to local cooling, pretreatment with metabolism-reducing drugs is favorable for cardiac performance after arrest. Steroid premedication should be considered when normothermic arrest with electrically induced ventricular fibrillation is planned.", 
    "33": "The haemodynamic consequences of combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade with intravenous labetalol were evaluated in 21 males with either high (n = 6), normal (n = 9) or low (n = 6) systemic arterial pressure, 4-17 hours after acute myocardial infarction without heart failure. Labetalol 190 +/- 18 mg (range 62-300 mg) infusion resulted in dose-related falls in systolic (P less than 0.01) and diastolic (P less than 0.05) arterial pressure in all patients. The rate of pressure reduction per mg of infused labetalol was directly proportional to the control systolic arterial pressure. Cardiac output (thermodilution) was reduced (P less than 0.05) with low dose labetalol (39 +/- 5 mg) without change on continued infusion. Left heart filling pressure (pulmonary artery occluded pressure) was unchanged throughout infusion in all patients. In conclusion, the vasodilating properties of labetalol appeared to offset the beta-blocker induced depression of cardiac function. The increased sensitivity to the effects of labetalol in those patients with hypertension may be related to excessive alpha-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction in this patient group.", 
    "34": "The beta-blocking activity of two slow-release formulations of metoprolol was compared to conventional metoprolol and atenolol which were each given once daily for one week to 8 healthy volunteers in a balanced crossover study. Plasma levels of metoprolol were also measured. Only metoprolol SA (Astra) produced plasma concentrations significantly higher than those for conventional metoprolol 24 hours after dosing. Mean reduction in exercise tachycardia at 24 hours after dosing was significantly greater with atenolol and metoprolol SA than with metoprolol SR and conventional metoprolol. Beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity at 24 hr was more variable with all formulations of metoprolol than with atenolol, which was explained by differences in metoprolol metabolism. Subjects who were found to be \"poor metabolizers\" when tested with debrisoquine had much greater bioavailability, half-life and response to metoprolol. These subjects had maintained beta-blocking activity at 24 hr following metoprolol whereas extensive metabolizers did not, even with sustained-release formulations. The response to atenolol did not depend on oxidation phenotype.", 
    "35": "The alpha- and beta-blocking effects of labetalol are such that during and following exercise the haemodynamic benefits of beta-blockade outweigh the unfavourable effects, because the latter are diminished by the concomitant minor degree of alpha-blockade.", 
    "36": "Patients with acute pregnancy-related hypertension were randomized to treatment with 200 mg oral labetalol or 10 mg intramuscular hydralazine. Labetalol was found to be at least as effective, more predictable, more acceptable and produced no change in heart rate compared to hydralazine.", 
    "37": "A double-blind crossover study was performed to compare the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) side effects with atenolol and metoprolol. Eleven women and 6 men who had previously developed such side effects on lipophilic beta-blockers were identified by means of a preliminary questionnaire. A 30-item psychiatric questionnaire was then used to detect changes in psychological status and possible CNS side effects. Discontinuation of the original lipophilic beta-blocker produced a significant improvement in quality of sleep, dreams, concentration, memory, energy and anxiety. Introduction of atenolol did not result in any significant CNS effects. With metoprolol, however, some effects occurred but not to the extent experienced prior to study on other more lipophilic beta-blockers. Blood pressure control was identical with both drugs.", 
    "38": "Adrenaline was infused into normal volunteers to produce plasma adrenaline levels similar to those found in acute myocardial infarction. These infusions were performed after pretreatment with labetalol or placebo. Adrenaline produced an increase in systolic blood pressure, a decrease in diastolic blood pressure and an increase in heart rate. All of these haemodynamic effects were blocked by labetalol. In particular, no increase in diastolic blood pressure was seen as occurs during increased sympatho-adrenal activity in the presence of non-sensitive beta-blockade. Thus labetalol maintains a different haemodynamic profile from non-selective beta-blockade during increased sympatho-adrenal activity.", 
    "39": "We studied the influence of 6 days treatment with alpha-methyldopa (50 mg/kg s.c.) twice daily on radioligand binding to alpha 1 [3H)prazosin), alpha 2 [3H)clonidine) and beta[3H)dihydroalprenolol (DHA] receptors in rat forebrain. A 27% rise (p less than 0.05) in the Bmax for (3H)prazosin without change in Kd was found. Following alpha-methyldopa, the Kd for (3H)clonidine was increased from 1.78 +/- 19 to 3.03 +/- nM and Bmax fell from 197 +/- 20 to 167 +/- 19 fmoles/mg protein (p less than 0.05). These findings suggest that chronic alpha-methyldopa therapy induces changes in alpha 1 and alpha 2 receptors which may modify the antihypertensive effect of alpha-methyldopa.", 
    "40": "Cardiac function early (less than 4 weeks) in the course of experimental renal hypertension was investigated. In 11 male mongrel dogs, one kidney was wrapped in silk to produce two-kidney, one-wrapped hypertension. Two weeks later, the contralateral kidney was removed. Five sham-wrapped and then contralaterally-nephrectomized dogs served as controls. M-mode left ventricular (LV) echocardiograms were recorded twice weekly in all dogs for 4 weeks before and for 2 weeks after wrapping (or sham-wrapping) and for 4 weeks after nephrectomy. In the 11 hypertensive dogs, mean arterial pressure (MAP) rose from 127 mm Hg (mean) to 143 two weeks after wrapping (p less than 0.05) and to 185 two weeks after nephrectomy (p less than 0.001). The fractional shortening of the left ventricle (% delta D) of hypertensive dogs was increased (9% maximum, mean, p less than 0.01) for 2 weeks after wrapping and for one week after nephrectomy. Two weeks after wrapping, LV end-systolic wall stress calculated from femoral artery peak systolic pressure, end-systolic dimension and wall thickness was unchanged, suggesting that increased myocardial contractility accounted for the findings. In normotensive control dogs, there were no echocardiographic changes during the study.", 
    "41": "The effects of glucagon on coronary resistance and myocardial performance were evaluated in a canine heart-lung preparation in which changes in left ventricular compression of the coronary vessels, due to inotropic effects, could be largely prevented. Glucagon (0.2 mg) caused an increase in left ventricular performance as evaluated by maximal dp/dt, time to peak ventricular pressure, and end diastolic pressure. Although coronary flow increased slightly, the increase was significant only when heart rate was allowed to increase and followed the same time course as the change in heart rate. It therefore appeared to be the result of an indirect metabolic effect. The increase in flow involved only the systolic component. This effect was not blocked by propranolol. No redistribution of coronary flow was demonstrated using microspheres. Myocardial efficiency, as evaluated by cardiac work versus oxygen consumption, increased slightly after glucagon injection.", 
    "42": "To study the diagnostic possibilities and mechanisms involved in sinus node dysfunction (SND), 26 patients with sick sinus syndrome were evaluated by basic electrophysiological tests before and after autonomic blockade, and by Holter monitoring. Based on intrinsic heart rate (IHR), two groups, a normal and a pathologic one, were separated. With Holter recordings, significant differences were manifested in minimal heart rate during sleeping and also in sinus cycles averaged for 24 h between the two groups. In patients with pathological IHR (n = 9) abnormal intrinsic rhythmicity were verified by electrophysiological means, while we found positive ECGs referring to sinoatrial dysfunction during the first 24 h of rhythm recording. The group of normal IHR (n = 17) covers patients with intrinsic SND (intrinsic SA block, 3/17 patients) and patients (14/17) where the electrophysiologic properties of the pacemaker cells were normal: normal intrinsic recovery time, gradual return to the stable intrinsic sinus cycle length in the postpacing secondary cycles, biphasic postextrasystolic patterns with a well-estimated intrinsic sinoatrial conduction time. Repeated Holter recording (total 26 X 24 h) revealed severe bradycardia (2 cases), SA block (4 cases), SA arrest (2 cases), tachybradyarrhythmia (1 case). Electrophysiological studies have a low diagnostic value in autonomic SND; repeated rhythm monitoring is obviously the best complementary method for appreciating the role and significance of autonomic tone in sick sinus syndrome.", 
    "43": "Intraperitoneal injections of adrenaline resulted in increased tritiated water efflux rate in the toadfish, Opsanus beta. Adrenaline-stimulated water flux was inhibited by the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, but not by the alpha-adrenergic blocker, phentolamine. Propranolol on its own had no effect but phentolamine significantly stimulated water flux; this action was attributed to a beta-mimetic effect of the drug. The cholinergic neurotransmitter acetylcholine, had no effect while the parasympathico-mimetic carbachol, significantly stimulated water flux. Arguments were advanced to explain the similarity in the effects of the adrenergic and cholinergic drugs although they are both known to produce opposing vascular haemodynamic effects in fish gills. Adrenaline substantially stimulated tritiated water flux in the toadfish, Opsanus beta. The adrenaline-stimulated water flux exhibited a linear dose-response curve up to an adrenaline dosage of 750 micrograms kg-1; wt. At higher doses there was apparently a desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptor sites. The adrenaline effect was inhibited by the beta-blocker propranolol, but not by the alpha-blocker, phentolamine. This suggests that the adrenaline-stimulated water flux was due predominantly to beta-receptor site stimulation. Stimulation of water flux by phentolamine on its own could be due to the stimulation of endogenous catecholamine release by the drug. We have proposed that the beta-stimulated water efflux could be due to an increase in surface area of the branchial epithelium, a decrease in water to blood diffusion distance, a direct metabolic effect or any combination of these effects by adrenaline. Carbachol caused an increase in tritiated water efflux. The carbachol-stimulated water flux was inhibited by atropine thus suggesting that the drug acts via muscarinic receptor sites. We have suggested that the action of the drug on hydraulic water conductivity, water to blood diffusion distance, hydrostatic pressure or a direct effect on membrane diffusion coefficient.", 
    "44": "A simple high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been developed for the measurement of atenolol in plasma, breast milk, and urine. The sample (250 microliters) is Vortex-mixed for 30 s with approximately 50 mg sodium chloride, 10 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution (50 microliters), internal standard solution (aqueous benzimidazole, 1.69 mumol/L) (50 microliters) and methyl-tert-butyl ether containing 10% (vol/vol) heptafluorobutanol (200 microliters). After centrifugation (9950 X g, 2 min), a portion (100 microliters) of the resulting extract is analysed on a microparticulate (5 micron) silica column using methanol containing 1 mmol/L d-10-camphorsulphonic acid monohydrate as the mobile phase, and the column effluent is monitored by fluorescence detection using an excitation wavelength of 195 nm. A specimen, together with a quality control sample, can be analysed in duplicate within 30 min. The limit of accurate measurement of the assay is 20 micrograms/L, no endogenous sources of interference have been observed and interference from other drugs is minimal.", 
    "45": "UM-272 (N,N-dimethylpropranolol), a quaternary antiarrhythmic agent, was administered sublingually to dogs with ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardias. Both anti-arrhythmic efficacy and bioavailability were compared to oral drug. Sublingual UM-272 converted ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm in all 5 dogs. The area under the plasma concentration time curve at 90 min was 4-12 times greater than for oral drug, suggesting the existence of an absorption-limiting process in the intestine, and providing an alternate form of administration for quaternary drugs.", 
    "46": "The involvement of dopamine in maintaining intraocular pressure (IOP) was investigated with the rabbit IOP recovery model after intravenous infusion of hypertonic saline. Dopamine facilitated the IOP recovery while reserpine did the opposite. When dopamine was administered after reserpinization, the IOP recovery was facilitated again. These results indicate that dopamine is involved in the maintenance of IOP because depletion of dopamine with reserpine resulted in an opposite effect produced by dopamine whereas administration of dopamine in reserpinized animals induced dopaminergic responses. Timolol produced similar effects as reserpine, which supports the idea that timolol reduces aqueous humor formation through elimination of dopaminergic function and reduction of blood flow in the ciliary body.", 
    "47": "The intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) of the adrenergic beta-blocker pindolol was studied by comparing its effects with those of propranolol in two experimental models: In the non-anesthetized dog with atrio-ventricular block created at least two months previously, propranolol at 0.078, 0.156 and 0.312 mg/kg depressed idioventricular automaticity without affecting atrial rate. Pindolol at 0.5 mg/kg raised atrial rate but left idioventricular rate unchanged. Beta-blockers depress the ventricular adrenergic tone which is strong in this model. With pindolol, this effect is offset by its ISA. Two successive injections of Thallium-201 enable variations in blood mass distribution caused by an agent administered between them to be studied. Isoprenaline increased blood flow in heart and skeletal muscles at the expense of lungs and kidneys. Pindolol (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) did not modify coronary blood flow, but increased muscular blood flow.", 
    "48": "The pharmacokinetics of pindolol was studied in 8 normal Africans following administration of a single oral 10 mg dose. The mean peak concentration was 30.2 +/- 5.0 ng X ml-1, the mean half-life (t1/2) of the elimination phase was 3.4 +/- 1.1 h, and the total body clearance was 628 +/- 13 ml X min-1. The apparent volume of distribution was 3.0 +/- 1.31 X kg-1. The values are the same as those reported in Europeans.", 
    "49": "The absolute oral bioavailability of pindolol has been estimated by two analytical methods, fluorimetry and GLC-ECD. The study was carried out in six healthy subjects who received either i.v. or oral pindolol in random order. The results obtained by both methods were similar and confirm the high bioavailability (about 75%) of pindolol. The present findings are compared with previous publications and emphasize the importance of undertaking bioavailability studies in the same subjects.", 
    "50": "The bioavailability of metoprolol was studied in eight healthy young and seven healthy elderly volunteers. Large interindividual differences in the bioavailability of metoprolol were observed in both groups. However, there was no significant difference in AUC, peak plasma concentration or elimination half-life between young and elderly, but time to peak concentration was significantly longer in the elderly. Pretreatment with metoclopramide had no effect on AUC but caused significant increases in peak concentration and decreases in time to peak concentration in both groups. Probanthine pretreatment (only to the young) resulted in a significant decrease in peak concentration of metoprolol and a significant increase in time to peak concentration but had no effect on the AUC. These results suggest that alterations in gastric emptying and gut motility due to ageing or other drugs have no effect on the overall availability of metoprolol to the systemic circulation but may have significant effects on the time to peak plasma concentration and peak concentration achieved after a single oral dose.", 
    "51": "A study has been made of the effects of intravenous atenolol, practolol and propranolol on the changes induced by exhaustive dynamic physical exercise in blood pressure, heart rate and blood levels of lactate, glucose, insulin, free fatty acids and potassium. The mean endurance of dynamic exercise was reduced by all three beta-blockers, most markedly by propranolol. After all the beta-blockers heart rate showed a similar decrease during the first 60 min of exercise; atenolol caused the smallest reduction at exhaustion. All three beta-blockers lowered the systolic blood pressure during exercise; propranolol was the most active agent both during exercise and during recovery. The diastolic pressure was higher during exercise after treatment with the beta-blockers, especially propranolol. The beta-blockers did not markedly affect the elevation of blood lactate induced by exercise. The increase in blood glucose was abolished by atenolol. Plasma insulin was reduced by exercise after beta-blockade, most markedly after propranolol and practolol. All the beta-blockers were equipotent in reducing up to 60 min the exercise-induced increase in plasma free fatty acids, although at exhaustion propranolol had a significantly greater effect than atenolol or practolol. Serum potassium was higher after propranolol and atenolol than after practolol during exercise and recovery.", 
    "52": "The acute haemodynamic effects of the beta-adrenoreceptor agonist, prenalterol, were studied in six patients with chronic end-stage renal failure. Prenalterol 0.8 mg, 1.6 mg, and 3.2 mg was administered i.v. as a bolus, and after the last dose the selective adrenergic beta-1-receptor antagonist metoprolol was administered i.v. in doses of 5 and 10 mg. The haemodynamic effects of the drugs were investigated using impedance cardiography and radionuclide angiocardiography. The main haemodynamic effects were a dose-related chronotropic effect, demonstrated by an increase in heart rate (26%; less than 0.05), and an inotropic effect, shown by an increase in stroke volume index (20%; p less than 0.05) and left ventricular ejection time (12%; p less than 0.05); the cardiac index was increased by 47% (p less than 0.05). Transmural myocardial perfusion (DPTI/SPTI ratio) was decreased by 22% (p less than 0.05) after prenalterol. It is concluded that prenalterol has positive inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients with chronic renal failure, that the improvement in left ventricular performance is at the expense of a decreased transmural myocardial perfusion, and that metoprolol is a specific antidote.", 
    "53": "To determine whether the depression of left ventricular pumping activity associated with beta-blockade alone could be offset by a substantial degree of partial agonist activity, the haemodynamic dose-response effects of intravenous propranolol and pindolol were compared in a randomised between-group saline controlled study in twenty patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease. The intravenous doses of propranolol (2-16 mg) and pindolol (0.2-1.6 mg) used were selected on the basis of published reports of equivalence in terms of exercise blockade of chronotropic beta-adrenoceptors. Following four intravenous boluses of each drug, administered according to a cumulative log-dosage schedule, there was a log-linear increase in the plasma concentrations of each drug. The range of plasma concentrations achieved were those which have been shown to be associated with substantial attenuation of sympathetic stimulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors. At rest propranolol resulted in dose-related linear reductions in heart rate and cardiac output and linear increases in left heart filling pressure and systemic vascular resistance compared with saline-controlled measurements. The only statistically significant change at rest after pindolol was a small increase in the left heart filling pressure. The calculated systemic vascular resistance was increased after propranolol but unchanged after pindolol. During supine bicycle exercise the systolic blood pressure increased less after propranolol than after saline or pindolol. The increments in all other measured haemodynamic variables during exercise were equally influenced by the two drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "Response to sustained (three-minute) handgrip at one-third maximum contraction was studied in 75 subjects with essential hypertension. The patients responded with an increase in heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and double product. Chronic atenolol therapy (100 mg/day in a single administration) decreased the values of these measurements at rest and during exercise. The treatment did not prevent or attenuate the rise in heart rate with grip, but it partially inhibited the pressor response to handgrip. Chronic atenolol therapy may reduce the risk of vascular disease by decreasing blood pressure and its response to isometric exercise. Additionally, chronic beta-adrenergic blockade with decreased heart rate, double product, and, most likely, myocardial oxygen consumption is probably a further cardioprotective factor.", 
    "55": "We have demonstrated for the first time alpha-1 adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in human nasal mucosa obtained from patients with nasal allergy or sinusitis. Using the radioligand 3H-prazosin, 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) and 3H-quinaclidinyl benzilate (3H-QNB), we determined the receptor densities (Bmax) and affinities (KD) of alpha-1, beta, and muscarinic receptors. There was an increased number of muscarinic receptors and a decreased number of alpha-1, beta receptors in patients with nasal allergy but not in those with sinusitis. Binding affinities (KD) of alpha-1, beta, and muscarinic receptors were unchanged in all patients with nasal allergy and sinusitis. Disorders of the autonomic nerve receptors appear to play a definite role in pathology of nasal allergy.", 
    "56": "Concomitant administration of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, and the alpha 1- and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, labetalol, was studied in 12 hypertensive outpatients treated with thiazide diuretics. Clonidine, 0.15 mg b.i.d., effectively lowered supine, standing and isometric blood pressure values when administered to patients on cyclothiazide, 2.5 mg q.d. Addition of labetalol, 200 mg b.i.d., to the diuretic-clonidine treatment resulted in further reduction of blood pressure at rest both in the supine and standing position. In contrast, during isometric work, addition of labetalol to the diuretic-clonidine regimen did not exhibit the same additive antihypertensive effect. When clonidine was given in a dose of 0.3 mg once daily in the evening and the other two drugs as previously, the same antihypertensive effect was observed in the afternoon. Labetalol did not provoke new side-effects of its own.", 
    "57": "Neonatal rat heart myocytes were isolated by digestion of the heart tissue with trypsin. After separation the cells were transferred to plastic cluster dishes where they formed a monolayer culture. After 72 hours in culture the myocytes showed a synchronous contraction and renovation of their membrane structures. Studies of muscarinic cholinergic receptors were carried out using (3H)-Quinuclidinyl benzilate directly on cells attached to the bottom of the dish. The presence of a specific muscarinic receptor on cultured beating myocytes was confirmed.", 
    "58": "In North America, diuretics remain the most common first-line drug therapy for essential hypertension based on efficacy, safety and cost. The promotion of step-care programmes has firmly established their dominant use on this continent whereas in Europe, particularly in Scandinavia and Great Britain, beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents are more frequently chosen as first-line therapy. On both continents, combined therapy with a diuretic and a beta-blocker is probably the most common second step for patients with blood pressures uncontrolled on a single agent alone and diuretics remain useful, if not essential, to prevent sodium retention commonly observed with other antihypertensive agents. Although the forced loss of sodium and water may be responsible for their initial antihypertensive effect, the mechanism underlying their long-term effect is unknown but probably involves some alteration of vascular smooth muscle reactivity. More recently, concern has been expressed about their long-term safety as larger populations are being exposed to diuretic agents for a significant proportion of their life-span. These concerns include haemodynamic and biochemical consequences of diuretic therapy - excessive tachycardia at rest and with minimal exercise, postural hypotension, hypokalaemia and arrhythmias, muscle cramps or fatigue, glucose intolerance, hyperuricaemia and altered circulating lipids as markers or promotors of atherosclerosis and its complications. At present, there is insufficient evidence to alter the present recommendation of diuretic agents as first-line drug therapy in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "59": "The efficacy of mepindolol in the control of blood pressure during 24 hours was investigated in nine patients with hypertension accompanying chronic renal disease. The patients were classified into three groups having glomerular filtration rates of 50% to 55%, 30% to 35%, and 10% to 15%. The daily dosage of mepindolol was 5 mg for patients with glomerular filtration rates 30% and higher and 2.5 and 1.25 mg for patients with more advanced renal failure. The control of blood pressure was adequate in patients treated with 5 mg. In those with advanced renal failure, 2.5 mg was adequate to control blood pressure, but 1.25 mg was an inadequate dosage. These results point to the efficacy of mepindolol in the treatment of hypertension of chronic renal disease. Moreover, the dosage of the beta-blocker can be reduced by half the recommended dosage when advanced renal failure is present.", 
    "60": "The effects of metoprolol, propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide on lipoprotein metabolism were studied in three different but comparable groups of middle-aged men with previously untreated hypertension (n=10, n=10, and n=11, respectively). All three treatments were associated with an increase in serum triglyceride and VLDL-cholesterol levels. Propranolol treatment was associated with consistent and significant decreases in HDL-cholesterol, apoA-I and A-II levels, whereas these changes during the other treatments were neither significant nor consistent. An increase in adipose tissue LPL-activity and a decrease in serum free fatty acids were seen in the propranolol treatment group. Significant changes were not observed in glucose tolerance or catecholamine excretion. The blood pressure reduction was similar in the three groups. The design of the present study was in some important respects different from that of others. This may help to explain why we found a difference between the two beta-blockers in our study.", 
    "61": "A rapid and sensitive gas chromatographic method for the determination of the beta-adrenergic agent isoxsuprine in human plasma has been developed. The procedure involves the extraction of the drug with ether and an internal standard (propranolol) from plasma at alkaline pH, solvent evaporation, and the formation of a tri-trifluoroacetyl derivative by reaction with trifluoroacetic anhydride in ethyl acetate. Analyses were carried out by gas-liquid chromatography on a 3% OV-17 column using an electron capture detector. The minimum detectable amount of isoxsuprine was 0.5 ng/ml of plasma and the electron capture detector response was tested to be linear (r2 greater than 0.999) between 0.5 and 20 ng/ml. No interferences from endogenous substances were found. Precision of the method was found to be 9.9, and 6.1% coefficient of variation at 1 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml of plasma, respectively. Determination of isoxsuprine at the nanogram level in cord plasma samples from newborns at the time of the delivery was possible using the described procedure.", 
    "62": "To determine the course of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the early hours after aortocoronary bypass grafting, 24 patients underwent serial gated bloodpool scanning. Twenty-two had received propranolol until the day of surgery. ECGs showed no evidence of perioperative infarction. Preoperatively, the mean (+/- SD) LVEF was 0.56 +/- 0.13; after bypass, it was 0.38 +/- 0.11 at 4 hours, 0.42 +/- 0.12 at 5 hours, 0.43 +/- 0.11 at 6 hours, 0.48 +/- 0.13 at 7 hours, 0.52 +/- 0.15 at 8 hours, and 0.54 +/- 0.15 at 10 to 14 days. The LVEFs at 4, 5, and 6 hours postoperatively were significantly lower than preoperatively (p less than 0.05). Postoperative mean heart rate was higher at all times; mean temperature was depressed at 4 and 5 hours and elevated at 7 and 8 hours; and mean arterial blood pressure was depressed at 7 hours, 8 hours, and 10 to 14 days (p less than 0.05). The degree of the early postoperative LVEF depression correlated with the daily preoperative propranolol dose (p less than 0.05) and was unrelated to bypass time, aortic cross-clamp time, or changes in temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. The LVEF at 10 to 14 days postoperatively was not significantly different from the preoperative value. The LVEF is depressed in the early hours after aortocoronary bypass grafting and approaches the preoperative value with time. The magnitude of the early depression appears to be related to the preoperative propranolol dose, but does not significantly correlate with factors related to surgical technique.", 
    "63": "After fractionation of rabbit bone marrow into erythroid cells at different developmental stages adenylate cyclase activity of membrane ghosts was assayed in the presence of sodium fluoride, catecholamines or prostaglandins E. Both basal and fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase decreased continuously during differentiation. Only catecholamines having beta 2-adrenergic activity stimulated adenylate cyclase and their effect was restricted to the most immature cells, the proerythroblasts and, to a lesser extent, the basophilic erythroblasts. Thus, uncoupling of beta-adrenergic receptors occurs early in erythroblast development and hormone responsiveness is lost before the final cell division. Prostaglandin E receptors and adenylate cyclase remain coupled throughout erythroid cell development.", 
    "64": "Many reported series of patients treated with topical Timolol for chronic open angle glaucoma have been changed from other medication after a 'wash-out' period. This four year study reports the ocular hypotensive effect of Timolol in 82 new patients with chronic open angle glaucoma followed for up to 4.5 years. The effects on intraocular pressure, visual acuity, visual field, pupil size, pulse rate, blood pressure and Schirmer's test were recorded and correlated. Corneal sensitivity was also followed in some patients, matched by a series of controls, using the method of Cochet and Bonnet. The results are discussed, and only slight reduction in blood pressure and pulse rate was found, and there was no significant effect on the pupil diameter or Schirmer's test. There was no significant effect on corneal sensitivity. There was only slight tachyphylaxis. Of the 82 patients, 20 patients required extra medical or surgical treatment. 16 patients dropped out through death or failure to attend, and of the remaining 66 patients, 69.7 per cent were controlled by Timolol alone.", 
    "65": "Patients who survive the acute phase of myocardial infarction have a high mortality in the following years. The mortality is largely due to sudden cardiac death or recurrent myocardial infarction. The main purpose of the present study was to clarify whether long-term treatment with the beta-adrenergic blocking agent timolol would improve prognosis in such patients. In order to recruit the sufficient number of patients to resolve this question a multicenter study was performed. This study, named \"The Norwegian Multicenter Study On Timolol After Myocardial Infarction\" was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. Twenty hospitals in Norway collaborated within an organizational structure aiming to achieve a maximum of standardization of study procedures. From a representative population of patients less than 75 years of age surviving the acute episode of infarction 52% were recruited for the study. The recruitment rate was high at all hospitals. The 1884 patients included were stratified into 3 risk groups before randomization. Risk Group I (18%) were patients with a recurrent infarction. Risk Group II (58%) were patients with a first infarction considered to be at high risk of sudden cardiac death. The rest, Risk Group III (22%) were patients at low risk. The placebo and timolol groups were similar with respect to most of the important baseline characteristics. Minor differences in a few characteristics did not affect the overall results as was shown by various statistical procedures including the Cox's proportional hazards regression model. The patients were followed 12 - 33 months after discharge from hospital with regular clinical examinations performed by the study investigators at the hospitals. Compliance was very good and no patient was lost to follow-up although 23.3% in the placebo group and 29.1% in the timolol group were withdrawn from the study regimen. The study demonstrated that long-term treatment with timolol improved prognosis in survivors of acute myocardial infarction. The most important finding was a highly statistically significant difference in life table mortality of 39.3% between the placebo group (21.9%) and the timolol group (13.3%) (p=0.0003). This difference was first of all due to a lower rate of sudden cardiac death in the timolol group (7.7%) compared to the placebo group (13.9%) (p=0.0001) when including events in the so-called \"per protocol period\".(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "66": "Echocardiography was performed at every six months in hypertensives well controlled on metoprolol, 100 mg twice a day. After six months' treatment blood pressure was reduced from 177/110 mm Hg to 147/88 (p less than 0.02). LV wall thickness (septum + posterior wall) was unchanged 2.10 cm (2.14), and a significant drop in cardiac output (CO) to 5.0 l/min (6.1, p less than 0.02) was recorded (pretreatment values in brackets). After 24 months' treatment LV wall thickness was reduced to 1.94 cm (p less than 0.02), total peripheral resistance (TPR) to 17.3 mm Hg/l/min (23.4, p less than 0.02) and CO increased to 6.7 l/min (6.1, n.s.). After six months' treatment, there was thus a drop in BP with a significant drop in CO and unchanged TPR. After 24 months' treatment, however, CO was back to the pretreatment level and the drop in BP was entirely caused by a drop in TPR which was probably secondary to a reduction in the wall thickness of the arterial resistance vessels as judged by the relationship between the reduction in wall thickness in the LV and the reduction in TPR during the treatment.", 
    "67": "Pharmacokinetics of metoprolol, propranolol and atenolol were investigated in six healthy volunteers following 7 days of oral monotherapy with these drugs and after 7 days concurrent administration of each of these betareceptor antagonists with cimetidine. Application of cimetidine did not lead to any interaction with atenolol, whereas mean peak plasma levels of metoprolol were increased by 70%, and those of propranolol by 95% due to concurrent administration of cimetidine (p less than 0.05). The AUC of the two last mentioned beta blockers behaved similarly (p less than 0.05). Measurement of exercise-induced tachycardia on the 6th day of administration showed no differences between monotherapy with the beta blocker and combined treatment with each of them and cimetidine. Except for one volunteer who complained of anxiety, weakness and sweating on the 6th day of cimetidine/metoprolol administration, no adverse effects could be observed during the combination therapy with cimetidine and the beta blockers or in monotherapy with beta blockers.", 
    "68": "A study was undertaken in 19 patients with benign to moderate essential hypertension to verify the effect of indapamide alone or combined with a beta-blocker on plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, serum potassium and urinary prostaglandins PGE2 and PGF2a. Blood pressure was normalized in 11 (58%) patients with 2.5 mg indapamide/day. In the remaining 8 patients, the addition of pindolol resulted in blood pressure control. Under indapamide, a 70% increase in plasma renin activity and 81% (p less than 0.01) in plasma aldosterone was observed, whereas there was an 18% (p less than 0.001) decrease in potassium. Simultaneously, an increase in urinary PGE2 and PGF2a was observed; these values were significant for PGE2 (p less than 0.025). The addition of pindolol did not produce significant change in the biochemical parameters measured. The increase in the excretion rate of primary prostaglandins could play a role in the mode of action of indapamide.", 
    "69": "The mechanisms underlying the thermal effects induced by intrahypothalamic administration of either d-amphetamine or thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has been investigated in conscious rats. Direct administration of d-amphetamine (1-10 micrograms in 1 microliter) or TRH (1-4 micrograms in 1 microliter) into the preoptic anterior hypothalamus caused hyperthermia or fever at the ambient temperature (Ta: 8, 22 and 30 degrees C) studied. The fever induced by d-amphetamine or TRH was due to increased metabolic heat production at Ta 8 degrees C, while at Ta 30 degrees C the fever was due to cutaneous vasoconstriction in the rat. At Ta 22 degrees C, the fever was due to both increased metabolism and cutaneous vasoconstriction. Furthermore, the fever induced by intrahypothalamic administration of TRH was greatly reduced by pretreatment with intrahypothalamic administration of either yohimbine (a blocking agent of alpha-adrenergic receptors), phentolamine (a blocking agent of alpha-adrenergic receptors) or DL-propranolol (a blocking agent of beta-adrenergic receptors) in the rat. However, the fever induced by d-amphetamine was antagonized by pretreatment with yohimbine or phentolamine, but not with DL-propranolol in the rat. These observations indicate that the adrenergic receptor mechanisms within the hypothalamus are involved in the fever induced by both d-amphetamine and TRH.", 
    "70": "The orthostatic changes in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were recorded in ten patients with stable angina pectoris before and after simultaneous sublingual nitroglycerin administration. All patients were examined three times: without other medication, during chronic metoprolol treatment, and during chronic verapamil treatment. Under control conditions, only minor changes were found in systolic BP following vertical tilting, while diastolic BP increased by approximately 10%. Nitroglycerin augmented these changes to some extent, while neither metoprolol nor verapamil caused significant changes. The orthostatic HR increase was considerably augmented by nitroglycerin. Verapamil treatment did not influence this response, while metoprolol caused significant reductions. These findings seem to explain why some few patients have observed severe orthostatic symptoms while taking nitroglycerin during treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents.", 
    "71": "The effect of 60 min of in situ warm ischaemia (37 degrees C) on renal function was investigated in the rat model. In addition, the effect of pretreatment with intravenously administered furosemide, mannitol, propranolol, methylprednisolone, and adenosine triphosphate-magnesium chloride (ATP-MgCl2), singly or in combination, was studied. The ischaemic kidney was effectively protected by the administration of methylprednisolone alone but not by furosemide, mannitol, ATP-MgCl2, or propranolol singly or in combination. These results demonstrate that rat kidneys subjected to 60 min of warm ischaemia can be safely protected with methylprednisolone pretreatment (3 mg/100 g of body weight) 30 min before warm ischaemia.", 
    "72": "The effect of nifedipine 20 mg three times daily and atenolol 100 mg once daily, singly and in combination on left ventricular ejection fraction, was investigated in 14 patients with chronic effort related angina pectoris. The ejection fraction was measured by gated radionuclide ventriculography at rest and during graded dynamic supine bicycle exercise. There was no significant change in resting left ventricular ejection fraction during any of the treatment periods. During dynamic exercise there was no significant change in the ejection fraction on placebo and atenolol, but a significant rise occurred on both nifedipine and the combination. Thus in patients with angina pectoris secondary to coronary artery disease and with normal resting left ventricular function, the combination of nifedipine and atenolol does not depress left ventricular function significantly as assessed by radionuclide ventriculography.", 
    "73": "All vasodilatory drugs reported in this chapter possess an antiaggregatory effect on platelets, some of them with a synergistic effect on prostacyclin-induced inhibition of aggregation. Thus, the question seems valid whether the antiaggregatory effect represents one part of their antianginal and antihypertensive action. Some vasodilators stimulate the biosynthesis of prostacyclin and/or other vasodilating prostaglandins. This stimulation could be linked not only to the antiaggregatory but also to the vasodilating action. The influence on prostaglandin biosynthesis, however, is not obligatory for all vasodilators, as nitroglycerin proves. Trapidil inhibits the biosynthesis and the effect of thromboxane A2, as our own experiments and those by Ohnishi et al. (7) have shown. This effect could be favorable in patients with heart infarction. Lefer et al. (5) have demonstrated a fivefold increase in thromboxane release after experimental ligation of the coronary artery in the cat. Pinane thromboxane, a thromboxane antagonist, almost completely abolished all deleterious consequences of ischemia. Whether trapidil is also able to inhibit thromboxane biosynthesis and activity under clinical conditions of heart infarction will be the topic of further investigations."
