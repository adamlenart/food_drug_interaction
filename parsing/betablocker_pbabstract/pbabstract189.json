Carvedilol is excreted by the liver and there were minimal fluctuations between hemodialysis, so, theoretically, drug dosage of the agent should be the same as in non-hemodialysis patients. Our results conflicted with prior studies, possibly caused by decreased circulation volume or plasma albumin level of hemodialysis patients, which would represent the effect of other drugs such as digoxin. Dosage adjustment and monitoring of drug plasma levels are required if the usual dosage of carvedilol is not tolerated in maintenance hemodialysis patients with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction.", 
    "4": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate a wide variety of physiological functions in response to structurally diverse ligands ranging from cations and small organic molecules to peptides and glycoproteins. For many GPCRs, structurally related ligands can have diverse efficacy profiles. To investigate the process of ligand binding and activation, we used fluorescence spectroscopy to study the ability of ligands having different efficacies to induce a specific conformational change in the human beta2-adrenoceptor (beta2-AR). The 'ionic lock' is a molecular switch found in rhodopsin-family GPCRs that has been proposed to link the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane domains 3 and 6 in the inactive state. We found that most partial agonists were as effective as full agonists in disrupting the ionic lock. Our results show that disruption of this important molecular switch is necessary, but not sufficient, for full activation of the beta2-AR.",

The duration of each treatment course was 6-weeks, with a 4-week washout between each treatment. IOP and BP were measured at baseline and at the end of each treatment period. IOP was measured every 2 hours throughout a 24-hour period. Sitting IOP was measured from 8 AM to 10 PM by Goldmann applanation tonometry. Supine IOP was assessed from 12 to 6 AM by means of a handheld electronic tonometer (TonoPen XL; Mentor, Norwell, MA).

During the 24-hour period, brimonidine induced a significant decrease in systolic BP (SBP) and DBP at all time points when compared with baseline measurements and with those after administration of the other drugs (P<0.0001). Timolol caused a significant decrease in DBP and SBP at all the 24-hour time points when compared with the baseline and with the dorzolamide- and latanoprost-induced changes (P<0.0001).

    "18": "Heart failure is correlated with attenuation of parasympathetic nervous function and enhanced sympathetic activity. Carvedilol, a third-generation beta-blocker, may improve the prognosis of heart failure better than selective beta(1)-blockers. Not all of its effects, however, can be explained by direct actions on the sympathetic nervous system. This study was therefore performed to investigate the possible alterations of muscarinic cholinergic (M)(2) receptors and cholinesterase-positive nerves in different regions of the adriamycin-induced failing rat heart, and the potential effects of carvedilol on these M(2) receptors and cholinesterase-positive nerves. Karnovsky-Roots histochemical staining combined with point counting methods, and immunochemical streptavidin-biotin complex staining and image analysis were used to test the distribution of cholinesterase-positive nerves and the expression of M(2) receptors, respectively. Our results show that the cholinesterase-positive nerve system was downregulated in the adriamycin-induced failing heart group, while the density of M(2) receptors was increased in the carvedilol 3- and 10-mg/kg body weight groups, especially in the endocardial tissues of the left-ventricular free wall. It is concluded that upregulation of M(2) receptors may be one of the potential mechanisms by which carvedilol exert its action on heart failure.",

Atenolol was used as the model drug, sodium chloride as osmotic agent and polyethylene oxide as suspending agent. Ethyl cellulose was employed as semipermeable membrane containing polyethylene glycol 400 as plasticizer for controlling membrane permeability. The formulation of atenolol osmotic pump tablet was optimized by orthogonal design and evaluated by similarity factor (f2). The optimal formulation was evaluated in various release media and agitation rates. Indentation size of core tablet hardly affected drug release in the range of (1.00-1.14) mm. The optimal osmotic tablet was found to be able to deliver atenolol at an approximately constant rate up to 24h, independent of both release media and agitation rate. The method that is simplified by coating the indented core tablet with the elimination of laser drilling may be promising in the field of the preparation of osmotic pump tablet.",

Four dependent variables were considered: percentage of MT release at 8 hours, T50%, diffusion coefficient, and floating time. The main effect and interaction terms were quantitatively evaluated using a mathematical model. The results indicate that X1 and X2 significantly affected the floating time and release properties, but the effect of different viscosity grades of HPMC (K4M and K10M) was nonsignificant. Regression analysis and numerical optimization were performed to identify the best formulation. Fickian release transport was confirmed as the release mechanism from the optimized formulation. The predicted values agreed well with the experimental values, and the results demonstrate the feasibility of the model in the development of GFDDS.", 
    "22": "Cranial sutures are important growth sites of the skull. During suture closure, the dura mater is one of the most important sources of various positive and negative regulatory signals. Previous results indicate that TGF-beta2 from dura mater strongly accelerates suture closure, however, its exact regulatory mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we confirmed that removal of dura mater in calvarial organ culture strongly accelerates sagittal suture closure and that this effect is further enhanced by TGF-beta2 treatment. TGF-beta2 stimulated cell proliferation in the MC3T3-E1 cell line. Similarly, it stimulated the proliferation of cells in the sutural space in calvarial organ culture. Furthermore, TGF-beta2-mediated enhanced cell proliferation and suture closure were almost completely inhibited by an Erk-MAPK blocker, PD98059. These results indicate that TGF-beta2-induced activation of Erk-MAPK is an important signaling component that stimulates cell proliferation to enrich osteoprogenitor cells, thereby promoting their differentiation into osteoblasts to achieve a rapid calvarial bone expansion.",

The objective of this study is to ascertain the mechanisms underlying its absorption as an approach to help in predicting the influence of dosage changes, possible drug-drug and drug-fruit juice interactions. Perfusion experiments have been performed in rats in two sites of absorption: the intestine and the colon. The nonlinearity of the process has been established by means of the assay of a wide range of concentrations (2-2000 microM). Fitting of the concentration versus time data allows the estimation of passive diffusion constant in the intestine (1.42 +/- 0.05/h) and the colon (1.13 +/- 0.06/h), V(m) and K(m) of the input process (9.85 +/- 4.98 microM/h, and 10.44 +/- 26.16 microM, respectively) and K(m) of an efflux system (0.53 +/- 1.16 microM) and V(m) in both intestinal segments (2.60 +/- 11.37 microM . /h in the intestine and 0.66 +/- 1.38 microM . /h in the colon).

Our objective was to describe the use of in-hospital cardiac medical therapy among patients undergoing open AAA repair and to examine the effect of perioperative cardiac medical therapy on in-hospital mortality. We examined clinical data and in-hospital medication use among 223 patients who underwent open AAA repair at three North American hospitals, all of which used the Transition resource and cost accounting system. Medication use was described [angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, aspirin, ss-blockers, and statins] within the cohort at five specific periods of time: presurgery, day of surgery, 1 day after surgery, postsurgery, and discharge. We then performed a matched case-control study where cases were defined as patients who died in-hospital. We compared medication use between cases and controls to assess its impact on in-hospital mortality. Most patients were elderly (mean age 72.5 +/- 9.8 years), 70.4% were male, and in-hospital mortality within the cohort was 10.8%. Medication use in all periods of administration was low. ss-Blocker use was highest among all classes on the day of surgery, with 20.6% of patients undergoing AAA repair receiving the medication. Less than 50% of patients received any of the medications at discharge. After adjusting for baseline differences, perioperative ACE inhibitor use showed a trend toward a protective effect [odds ratio (OR) = 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-1.31, p = 0.08], and perioperative ss-blocker use was significantly associated with a decrease in mortality (OR = 0.07, 95% CI 0.01-0.87, p = 0.04). Cardiac medical therapy among patients undergoing AAA repair is low throughout all periods of hospitalization. ACE inhibitor and ss-blocker use may be associated with decreased in-hospital mortality.", 
    "25": "Many membrane-bound neurotransmitter receptors are known to be internalized by exposure to agonist. This agonist-induced receptor internalization is considered to play important roles in receptor-mediated signaling. Here we investigated the internalization of GAR-3, a Caenorhabditis elegans muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, using cultured mammalian cells. When Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing GAR-3 were treated with carbachol, GAR-3 was internalized in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Approximately 60% of the cell surface receptor was internalized by exposure to 1 mM carbachol for 1 h. Carbachol-induced GAR-3 internalization was suppressed by treatment with hypertonic sucrose, which blocks the formation of clathrin-coated pits. Overexpression of a dominant-negative dynamin mutant (DynK44A), but not of a dominant-negative beta-arrestin mutant (Arr319-418), substantially inhibited carbachol-induced internalization of GAR-3. Thus, these data suggest that GAR-3 undergoes agonist-induced internalization via a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent but beta-arrestin-independent pathway. Depletion of Ca2+ by simultaneous treatment of the cells with BAPTA/AM (Ca2+ mobilization blocker) and EGTA (Ca2+ influx blocker) almost completely blocked agonist-induced GAR-3 internalization. Moreover, treatment of the cells with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 led to GAR-3 internalization in the absence of agonist. These results indicate that Ca2+ plays a critical role in GAR-3 internalization. We tested whether the third intracellular (i3) loop of GAR-3 is involved in agonist-stimulated receptor internalization. A GAR-3 deletion mutant lacking a large central portion of the i3 loop exhibited an internalization pattern comparable to that of the wild type, suggesting that the central i3 loop is not required for the internalization of GAR-3.", 
    "26": "Postoperative new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) remains the most common complication of coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Postoperative AF carries the risk of hemodynamic instability, increases the risk of thromboembolic events, and has a significant economic impact. Current guidelines recommend treatment with beta-blockers to prevent AF; information, however, is limited regarding the relative efficacy of beta-blocking agents. Carvedilol is a non-selective adrenergic blocker with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and multiple cationic channel blocking properties. These unique properties of carvedilol have generated interest in its use as a prophylaxis for postoperative AF.", 
    "27": "We hypothesize that carvedilol will be more effective than metoprolol, a conventional beta(1)-selective antagonist, in suppressing newly developed AF following off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery. We have designed the Carvedilol or Metoprolol Post-Revascularization Atrial Fibrillation Controlled Trial (COMPACT) to test our hypothesis in a multi-center, open-label, randomized, and controlled trial. A total of at least 650 patients will be randomized to receive an initial oral dose of either 5 mg of carvedilol twice per day or 20 mg of metoprolol tartrate three times per day following surgery. The dose of each beta-blocker will be increased to the maximum tolerated dose. The primary endpoint is the incidence of new-onset AF during the first 7 days after surgery.",

Neither carvedilol, metoprolol, the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, nor the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin affected the constrictor response to angiotensin II. alpha1-adrenoreceptors and beta-adrenoceptors are thus not involved in the direct constrictor effects of angiotensin II. When added to the organ bath at a subthreshold concentration, angiotensin II greatly amplified the response to phenylephrine. Both carvedilol and the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist irbesartan inhibited this angiotensin II-induced potentiation. Furthermore, carvedilol blocked the angiotensin II-induced amplification of phenylephrine-induced inositol phosphate accumulation in cardiomyocytes.", 
    "37": "AT1-alpha1-receptor crosstalk, involving inositol phosphates, sensitizes HCMAs to alpha1-adrenoceptor agonists.

This could explain the favorable effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol.", 
    "38": "The vascular endothelium synthesizes and releases a spectrum of vasoactive substances and therefore plays a fundamental role in the basal and dynamic regulation of the circulation. Nitric oxide (NO)-originally described as endothelium-derived relaxing factor-is released from endothelial cells in response to shear stress produced by blood flow, and in response to activation of a variety of receptors. After diffusion from endothelial to vascular smooth muscle cells, NO increases intracellular cyclic guanosine-monophosphate concentrations by activation of the enzyme guanylate cyclase leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle cells. NO has also antithrombogenic, antiproliferative, leukocyte-adhesion inhibiting effects, and influences myocardial contractility. Endothelium-derived NO-mediated vascular relaxation is impaired in spontaneously hypertensive animals. NO decomposition by free oxygen radicals is a major mechanism of impaired NO bioavailability. The resulting imbalance of endothelium-derived relaxing and contracting substances disturbs the normal function of the vascular endothelium. Endothelin acts as the natural counterpart to endothelium-derived NO. Besides its arterial blood pressure rising effect in humans, endothelin-1 induces vascular and myocardial hypertrophy, which are independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Current therapeutic strategies concentrate mainly on lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an impressive reduction in the risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has been achieved. Inflammatory mechanisms play an important role in vascular disease and inflammatory plasma markers correlate with prognosis. The production of reactive oxygen species under pathological conditions may represent an important inflammatory trigger. Novel therapeutic strategies specifically targeting inflammation thus bear great potential for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease. In this context, the vascular actions of flavanol-rich cocoa, particularly with regard to enhanced NO synthesis and endothelial function observed in humans following consumption, warrants further attention.

As a first step to improve production in heterologous host cells and permit genetic approaches to novel analogs, we have cloned and characterized the chondramide biosynthetic genes from the myxobacterium Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5. In addition to the expected PKS and NRPS genes, the cluster encodes a rare tyrosine aminomutase for beta-tyrosine formation and a previously unknown tryptophan-2-halogenase. Conditions for gene transfer into C. crocatus Cm c5 were developed, and inactivation of several genes corroborated their proposed function and served to define the boundaries of the cluster.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal damage are not yet clear. In the present study, we investigated whether nitric oxide (NO) could be involved in aroclor 1254 (A1254; a PCB mixture)-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Prolonged exposure (24 hr) to A1254 (10-100 microg/ml) caused a dose-dependent reduction of cell viability that was attenuated in the presence of a calcium entry blocker, gadolinum (Gd(3+)) at 10 microM, a concentration able to block voltage-sensitive calcium channels. In addition, A1254 caused an increase of cytosolic calcium that was dependent on extracellular calcium, as measured by fura-2 videomicroscopy. A1254-induced calcium rise may stimulate NO production through an activation of neuronal NOS (nNOS). Indeed, the concomitant addition of the selective nNOS inhibitor N(omega)-propyl-L-arginine (NPLA) and A1254 prevented cell injury, suggesting that NO production plays a major role in A1254-evoked cell injury. Furthermore, the exposure (14 hr) to A1254 (30 microg/ml) produced an up-regulation of the expression of beta isoform of nNOS. This up-regulation was calcium dependent and was accompanied by an enhancement of NO production as demonstrated by an increase of nitrite formation. Moreover, A1254-induced cell injury was prevented when KT 5823, a selective cGMP/PKG inhibitor, was added concomitantly to 30 microg/ml A1254. These results suggest that PCB-induced cell death in neuroblastoma cells is mediated by an activation of the cGMP/PKG pathway triggered by NO production.", 
    "53": "It has been suggested that specific antihypertensive medications (AHT) may either increase or decrease breast cancer risk.", 
    "54": "We studied breast cancer incidence among 49,950 women in North Jutland, Denmark in order to determine if breast cancer risk is associated with specific classes of AHT use. Poisson regression analyses were used to calculate rate ratios for ever or exclusive use of each class of AHT, number of prescriptions for AHT, and years of follow-up.", 
    "55": "There was no statistically significant association between ever use of any AHT overall (RR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.81-1.10) or any specific class of AHT (diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II antagonists) and breast cancer.",

    "57": "Apparent intrinsic clearance (CL(int,app)) of 7-ethoxycoumarin, phenacetin, propranolol, and midazolam was measured using rat and human liver microsomes and freshly isolated and cryopreserved hepatocytes to determine factors responsible for differences in rates of metabolism in these systems. The cryopreserved and freshly isolated hepatocytes generally provided similar results, although there was greater variability using the latter system. The CL(int,app) values in hepatocytes are observed to be lower than that in microsomes, and this difference becomes greater for compounds with high CL(int,app). This could partly be attributed to the differences in the free fraction (fu). The fu in hepatocyte incubations (fu,hep-inc) was influenced not only by the free fraction of compounds in the incubation buffer (fu,buffer) but also by the rate constants of uptake (k(up)) and metabolism (k(met)). This report provides a new derivation for fu,hep-inc, which can be expressed as fu,hep-inc = [k(up)/(k(met) + k(up))]/[1 + (C(hep)/C(buffer)) x (V(hep)/V(buffer))], where the C(hep), C(buffer), V(hep), and V(buffer) represent the concentrations of a compound in hepatocytes and buffer and volumes of hepatocytes and buffer, respectively. For midazolam, the fu,hep-inc was calculated, and the maximum metabolism rate in hepatocytes was shown to be limited by the uptake rate.", 
    "58": "Renal volume regulation is modulated by the action of cyclooxygenases (COX) and the resulting generation of prostanoids. Epithelial expression of COX isoforms in the cortex directs COX-1 to the distal convolutions and cortical collecting duct, and COX-2 to the thick ascending limb. Partly colocalized are prostaglandin E synthase (PGES), the downstream enzyme for renal prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) generation, and the EP receptors type 1 and 3. COX-1 and related components were studied in two kidney-one clip (2K1C) Goldblatt hypertensive rats with combined chronic ANG II or bradykinin B(2) receptor blockade using candesartan (cand) or the B(2) antagonist Hoechst 140 (Hoe). Rats (untreated sham, 2K1C, sham + cand, 2K1C + cand, sham + Hoe, 2K1C + Hoe) were treated to map expression of parameters controlling PGE(2) synthesis. In 2K1C, cortical COX isoforms did not change uniformly. COX-2 changed in parallel with NO synthase 1 (NOS1) expression with a raise in the clipped, but a decrease in the nonclipped side. By contrast, COX-1 and PGES were uniformly downregulated in both kidneys, along with reduced urinary PGE(2) levels, and showed no clear relations with the NO status. ANG II receptor blockade confirmed negative regulation of COX-2 by ANG II but blunted the decrease in COX-1 selectively in nonclipped kidneys. B(2) receptor blockade reduced COX-2 induction in 2K1C but had no clear effect on COX-1. We suggest that in 2K1C, COX-1 and PGES expression may fail to oppose the effects of renovascular hypertension through reduced prostaglandin signaling in late distal tubule and cortical collecting duct.",

Of the 270 (70%) who did not receive BB, 141 (52%) had contraindications to BB use. The total BB eligible group was 244 (63%). Of patients without contraindications to BB, 53% did not receive BB in the ED. By gender, 83 (54%) males and 46 (51%) females did not receive BB (P=.669). By age, 96 subjects (59%) over age 60 and 33 subjects (41%) under age 60 did not receive BB (P=.011).",

    "65": "Ibutilide is a type III antiarrhythmic agent approved for the pharmacologic conversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFl). Previous studies conducted outside the ED setting have demonstrated conversion rates of 60% to 80%. This response has been highest in patients with recent-onset AF-AFl. These observations and the 4-hour half-life of ibutilide suggest that it may be an excellent drug with which to treat AF-AFl in the ED. The purpose of the study was to examine the efficacy and safety of ibutilide in terminating AF-AFl in patients who present to the ED with symptoms of less than 3 days' duration, neither angina nor heart failure, and no comorbid conditions that require admission.", 
    "66": "Among 36 enrolled patients, the admission electrocardiogram demonstrated AF in 26 and AFl in 10. Ibutilide 1 mg was administered intravenously for 10 minutes. If sinus rhythm was not present 10 minutes after the infusion concluded, a second infusion of 1 mg was given. Successful conversion was defined as restoration of sinus rhythm within 1 hour after the last dose of ibutilide.", 
    "67": "Sixteen (61.5%) of 26 patients with AF and 9 (90%) of 10 patients with AFl converted to sinus rhythm (overall conversion rate=69%). The mean time to arrhythmia termination was 19+/-9 minutes. The mean stay in the ED was 16.2 hours. No significant complications occurred.", 
    "68": "We conclude that ibutilide is an excellent therapy option for restoring sinus rhythm in the ED. Its use may obviate the need for admission, avoid the risks and inconveniences of general anesthesia to perform electrical cardioversion, and reduce the ED length of stay in selected patients with recent-onset atrial arrhythmias.", 
    "69": "Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channels conduct the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, IKr, which is crucial for repolarization of cardiac action potentials. Moderate hERG blockade may produce a beneficial class III antiarrhythmic effect. In contrast, a reduction in hERG currents due to either genetic defects or adverse drug effects can lead to hereditary or acquired long QT syndromes characterized by action potential prolongation, lengthening of the QT interval on the surface ECG, and an increased risk for \"torsade de pointes\" arrhythmias and sudden death. This undesirable side effect of non-antiarrhythmic compounds has prompted the withdrawal of several blockbuster drugs from the market. Studies on mechanisms of hERG channel inhibition provide significant insights into the molecular factors that determine state-, voltage-, and use-dependency of hERG current block. In addition, crucial properties of the high-affinity drug binding site in hERG and its interaction with drug molecules have been identified, providing the basis for more refined approaches in drug design, safety pharmacology and in silico modeling. Recently, mutations in hERG have been shown to cause current increase and hereditary short QT syndrome with a high risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. Finally, the discovery of adrenergic mechanisms of hERG channel regulation as well as the development of strategies to enhance hERG currents and to modify intracellular hERG protein processing may provide novel antiarrhythmic options in repolarization disorders. In conclusion, the increasing understanding of hERG channel function and molecular mechanisms of hERG current regulation could improve prevention and treatment of hERG-associated cardiac repolarization disorders.", 
    "70": "Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE) 3 and 5 regulate cAMP and cGMP signalling in cardiac and smooth muscle myocytes. Important advances in the understanding of the roles of these enzymes have recently been made. PDE3 inhibitors have inotropic and vasodilatory properties, and although they acutely improve haemodynamics in patients with heart failure, they do not improve long-term morbidity and mortality. Although combination therapy with beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists or selective inhibition of specific PDE3 isoforms might result in a more favourable long-term outcome, more clinical data are needed to test this proposition. The role of PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of cardiac disease is evolving. PDE5 inhibitors cause pulmonary and systemic vasodilation. How these drugs will compare with other vasodilators in terms of long-term outcomes in patients with heart failure is unknown. Recent studies also suggest that PDE5 inhibitors may have antihypertropic effects, exerted through increased myocardial cGMP signalling, that could be of additional benefit in patients with heart failure.", 
    "71": "Preoperative cardiac assessment has become an integral part of contemporary anesthesia practice. Simple clinical markers can identify high-risk patients, but the question of how to reduce cardiac complications among high-risk patients has been controversial. Good quality randomized controlled trials have showed that neither preoperative coronary revascularization nor the placement of pulmonary artery catheters reduces perioperative cardiac complications. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that medical therapy offers myocardial protection and reduces perioperative cardiac complications. The data supporting these conclusions are reviewed in an evidence-based manner. At present, it is prudent to treat moderate- to high-risk patients undergoing elective surgery with beta-blockers if possible. Because not all patients are candidates for beta-blocker therapy, data regarding the perioperative use of alternative medications to reduce perioperative cardiac complications have been explored and are reviewed.", 
    "72": "Clinical-and-hemodynamic effects were studied of a supplementary use of a selective beta-adrenoblocker metoprolol in an ongoing therapy of chronic cardiac insufficiency (CCI) with inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACEI) and diuretics. It has been found out that long (over 8 weeks) course of therapy supplemented with metoprolol results in improvement of the left ventricular systolic function and lowering of the functional class. Long-term administration of metoprolol enhances tolerance to a graded physical exercise in CCI patients, which observation is accompanied by a more economic character of its performance. The findings secured validate the expediency of a supplementary use of the beta-adrenoblocker metoprolol in the routine regimen of the supporting treatment of CCI patients involving the use of ACEI plus a diuretic.",

The results showed that: (1) the baseline fEPSPs induced by test stimuli were not changed by i.c.v. injection of AbetaP31-35, while application of either AbetaP31-35 or AbetaP25-35 with the same molar concentration (50 nmol) significantly and similarly suppressed the HFS-induced LTP; (2) higher concentration of AbetaP31-35 or longer time of AbetaP exposure exhibited stronger suppression on LTP, indicating a dose- and time-dependent trends; (3) no significant effects could be found on the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) following AbetaP31-35 injection; (4) pretreatment with verapamil (2.5 mg/kg, i.p., 1 h prior to HFS), a blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels, did not affect the baseline fEPSPs, while it exhibited a significant suppression on LTP induced by HFS; and (5) surprisingly enough, coapplication with verapamil and AbetaP31-35 exhibited a similar suppression on LTP just as both of these two agents were used alone. These results indicate that: (1) AbetaP31-35, similar to AbetaP25-35, possesses potent suppressive effects on hippocampal LTP in vivo, supporting our proposal that the fragment AbetaP31-35 might be to date the shortest active sequence in full-length of AbetaP molecule; (2) AbetaP31-35-induced LTP suppression is not mediated by affecting the presynaptic processes; and (3) L-type Ca2+ channels might be one of the main pathways by which AbetaP31-35 insults LTP.",

The PKA signaling pathway plays an important role in protein secretion through the activation of cAMP, in fluid secretion through the elevation of intracellular calcium and in the activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which is involved in these signaling cascades.

Historic trends of prescribing for hypertension will advance the understanding of physician practice of evidence-based medicine. This study describes both long- and short-term trends in US antihypertensive prescribing from 1990 through 2004. Data were extracted from the National Disease and Therapeutic Index, a continuing survey of a national sample of US office-based physicians. Cox and Stuart and z tests were performed. Diuretics ranked among the top 3 antihypertensive drug classes throughout the entire study time span. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were preferred over diuretics beginning in 1993, with diuretics surpassing CCBs in 2000. Beta-blockers were consistently the fourth most common class until 2002, when exceeded by angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs). Most recent trends indicated an immediate but short-lived increase in the prescription of thiazide diuretics after the new clinical evidence released in December 2002 demonstrating clinical equivalence of thiazides to ACE inhibitors and CCBs. In contrast, prescription of ACE inhibitors declined, accompanied by continuation of a pre-existing increase in the prescription of ARBs, whereas prescription of CCBs remained essentially stable after the new evidence was released. The recorded long- and short-term trends indicate that evidence-based clinical recommendations had an impact on antihypertensive prescribing practices, but the magnitude of impact may be smaller and of more limited duration than desired.", 
    "89": "Lowering elevated blood pressure (BP) in diabetic hypertensive individuals decreases cardiovascular events. We questioned whether remodeling of resistance arteries from hypertensive diabetic patients would improve after 1 year of tight BP control with addition of either the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan or the beta-blocker (BB) atenolol to previous therapy, which included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or calcium channel blockers. Twenty-eight hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients treated with oral hypoglycemic and antihypertensive agents (not receiving ARBs or BBs) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment for 1 year with valsartan (80 to 160 mg) or atenolol (50 to 100 mg) daily, added to previous therapy. Resistance arteries dissected from gluteal subcutaneous tissues were assessed on a pressurized myograph. After 1 year of treatment, systolic and diastolic BP and glycemia were equally well controlled in the valsartan and atenolol groups. Endothelium-dependent and independent relaxation did not change in the treated groups. After 1 year of treatment, resistance artery media:lumen ratio decreased in the valsartan group (7.9+/-0.5% after versus 9.8+/-0.6% before; P < 0.05) but not in the atenolol-treated group (9.9+/-0.9% versus 10.6+/-1%; P value not significant). Artery walls from atenolol-treated patients became stiffer, with no change in the valsartan-treated patients. In conclusion, similar intensive BP control for 1 year with valsartan was associated with improved structure of resistance arteries in diabetic hypertensive patients, whereas vessels from atenolol-treated patients exhibited unchanged remodeling and a stiffer wall. The addition of ARBs but not BBs to antihypertensive medications that may include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or calcium channel blockers results in an improvement in resistance artery remodeling in diabetic hypertensive patients.",

Carvedilol and S-carazolol as an internal standard extracted from whole blood or plasma were separated using an enantioselective separation column (Chiralpak AD column; 2.0 diameter x 250 mm) without any chiral derivatizations. The mobile phase was hexane:isopropanol:diethylamine (78:22:1, v/v). The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 284 and 343 nm, respectively. The limits of quantification for the S(-)- and R(+)-carvedilol enantiomers in plasma and blood were both 0.5 ng/ml. Intra- and inter-day variations were less than 5.9%. As an application of the assay, concentrations of carvedilol enantiomer in plasma and blood samples from 15 patients treated with carvedilol for congestive heart failure were determined.", 
    "91": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) places an enormous burden on individuals, families and society. Consequently, a tremendous effort is being devoted to the development of drugs that prevent or delay neurodegeneration. Current pharmacological treatments are based on the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, a N-methyl-D-aspartate channel blocker. However, new therapeutic approaches, including those more closely targeted to the pathogenesis of the disease, are being developed. These potentially disease-modifying therapeutics include secretase inhibitors, cholesterol-lowering drugs, amyloid-beta immunotherapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonal modulation and the use of antioxidants. The possibility that oxidative stress is a primary event in AD indicates that antioxidant-based therapies are perhaps the most promising weapons against this devastating neurodegenerative disorder.", 
    "92": "Ethanolic extract of fresh leaves of M. koenigii (MKEE) showed a dose dependent positive inotropic effect on isolated frog heart. The responses to MKEE (62.5-1000 microg) were not affected in either way by theophylline, imidazole, propranolol and sildenafil. The change in potassium and sodium concentration did not alter MKEE-induced positive inotropic effect. Lignocaine did not alter the responses to MKEE significantly. Responses to MKEE were significantly inhibited when calcium concentration was reduced to half (from 1.58 to 0.79 mM) and were significantly potentiated when calcium concentration was doubled (from 1.58 to 3.16 mM). Verapamil was found to inhibit the responses significantly.

We measured inotropic effects of phenylephrine (0.3-300 microM) in isolated left atrial preparations (1 Hz, 37 degrees C, 1.8 mM Ca(2+), 0.3 microM nadolol) from male 8-week FVB mice (n=200). Phenylephrine concentration-dependently increased force of contraction from 1.5+/-0.1 to 2.8+/-0.1 mN (mean+/-s.e.m., n=42), which was associated with increased MLC-2a phosphorylation at serine 21 and 22 by 67% and translocation of PKCepsilon but not PKCalpha to membrane (+30%) and myofilament (+50%) fractions.MLCK inhibition using ML-7 or wortmannin right-shifted the concentration-response curve of phenylephrine, reducing its inotropic effect at 10 microM by 73% and 81%, respectively. The compound KIE1-1 (500 nM), an intracellularly acting PKCepsilon translocation inhibitor peptide, prevented PKCepsilon translocation and augmented the maximal inotropic effect of phenylephrine by 40%. In contrast, inhibition of Ca(2+)-dependent PKC translocation (KIC1-1, 500 nM) had no effect. Chelerythrine, a PKC inhibitor, decreased basal force without changing the inotropic effect of phenylephrine. The IP(3) receptor blocker 2-APB (2 and 20 microM) concentration-dependently decreased basal force, but did not affect the concentration-response curve of phenylephrine. These results indicate that activation of MLCK is required for the positive inotropic effect of alpha(1)-adrenergic stimulation, that the Ca(2+)-independent PKCepsilon negatively modulates this effect, and that PKCalpha and IP(3) receptor activation is not involved.",

Two or even three different drugs are often necessary to reach this rather difficult goal. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are preferred for patients with renal damage. Proteinuria should be reduced to less than 0.5 g/day. Associated risk factors should be treated with equal effectiveness. In particular, LDL cholesterol should be lowered to less than 1 g/L when additional risk factors are present. Aspirin (0.75 mg a day) should be given routinely as soon as blood pressure is controlled.",

    "103": "beta-Adrenoceptors are G protein-coupled receptors whose functions are closely associated with caveolae in the heart and cultured cell lines. In the gut, they are responsible, at least in part, for the mediation of the sympathetic stimulation that might lead to intestinal paralysis postoperatively. We examined the effect of caveolin-1 knockout on the beta-adrenoceptor response in mouse small intestine. The relaxation response to (-)-isoprenaline in carbachol-contracted small intestinal tissue segments was reduced in caveolin-1 knockout mice (cav1(-/-)) compared with their genetic controls (cav1(+/+)). Immunohistochemical staining showed that beta-adrenoceptor expression was similar in both strains in gut smooth muscle. Selective beta-adrenoceptor blockers shifted the concentration response curve (CRC) of (-)-isoprenaline to the right in cav1(+/+) intestine, but not in cav1(-/-), with greatest shift in case of the beta(3)-blocker, SR59230A. The CRC of the selective beta(3)-agonist BRL 37344 was also shifted to the right in cav1(-/-) compared with cav1(+/+). The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor H-89 shifted the CRC of (-)-isoprenaline to the right in cav1(+/+) but not in cav1(-/-). H-89 reduced the relaxation due to forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP in cav1(+/+) but not in cav1(-/-), suggesting a reduction in PKA activity in cav1(-/-). In cav1(+/+), PKA was colocalized with caveolin-1 in the cell membrane, but PKA immunoreactivity persisted in cav1(-/-). Examination of PKA expression in the lipid raft-rich membrane fraction of the jejunum revealed reduced PKA expression in cav1(-/-) compared with cav1(+/+). The results of the present study show that the function of beta-adrenoceptors is reduced in cav1(-/-) small intestine likely owing to reduced PKA activity.", 
    "104": "Catecholamines participate in the pathogenesis of portal hypertension and liver fibrosis through alpha1-adrenoceptors. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of norepinephrine (NE) on human hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which exert vasoactive, inflammatory, and fibrogenic actions in the injured liver. Adrenoceptor expression was assessed in human HSC by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was studied in fura-2-loaded cells. Cell contraction was studied by assessing wrinkle formation and myosin light chain II (MLC II) phosphorylation. Cell proliferation and collagen-alpha1(I) expression were assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation and quantitative PCR, respectively. NF-kappaB activation was assessed by luciferase reporter gene and p65 nuclear translocation. Chemokine secretion was assessed by ELISA. Normal human livers expressed alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors, which were markedly upregulated in livers with advanced fibrosis. Activated human HSC expressed alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors. NE induced multiple rapid [Ca2+]i oscillations (Ca2+ spikes). Prazosin (alpha1-blocker) completely prevented NE-induced Ca2+ spikes, whereas propranolol (nonspecific beta-blocker) partially attenuated this effect. NE caused phosphorylation of MLC II and cell contraction. In contrast, NE did not affect cell proliferation or collagen-alpha1(I) expression. Importantly, NE stimulated the secretion of inflammatory chemokines (RANTES and interleukin-8) in a dose-dependent manner. Prazosin blocked NE-induced chemokine secretion. NE stimulated NF-kappaB activation. BAY 11-7082, a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor, blocked NE-induced chemokine secretion. We conclude that NE stimulates NF-kappaB and induces cell contraction and proinflammatory effects in human HSC. Catecholamines may participate in the pathogenesis of portal hypertension and liver fibrosis by targeting HSC.",

Mechanisms of regulation of G-protein-coupled receptor kinases [GRKs] and cardiovascular disease. Cardiovasc Res 69:46-56, Rockman HA, Koch WJ, Lefkowitz RJ: 2002. Seven-transmembrane-spanning receptors and heart function. Nature 415:206-212). Interestingly, these two G-protein-coupled receptor systems are targeted by modern heart failure treatment including beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. Although GRK2 is ubiquitously expressed, its particular importance in the heart has been demonstrated by interesting phenotypes of genetically altered mice that suggest GRK2 inhibition can ameliorate heart failure. In essence, this work suggests GRK2 could be an endogenous receptor blocker targeting both the beta-adrenergic and angiotensin receptors in the heart. This notion immediately suggests it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate GRK2 activity in the heart. In this review, we provide a detailed presentation of the tight regulation of GRK2 expression levels and protein activity, and we discuss the cardiovascular GRK2 functions and possible therapeutic perspectives.",

Of the patients who were on admission beta-blockers and were discharged alive (n = 263), beta-blockers were discontinued in 54 and significantly modified (>50% dose reduction or changed to alternative beta-blocker) in 28 patients during hospitalization. Factors associated with discontinuation of beta-blockers during hospitalization included respiratory rate >24 breaths/min (30.8% vs. 16.9%; p = 0.03), heart rate >100 beats/min (19.2% vs. 7.3%; p = 0.01), lower ejection fraction (17.9 +/- 5.4% vs. 20.2 +/- 7.1%; p = 0.04), diabetes (21.2% vs. 37.1%; p = 0.03), and systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg during hospitalization (70.3% vs. 54.1%; p = 0.03).

One of the twins suffered a type A aortic dissection, which required replacement of the ascending aorta, and the other twin had an aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta (46mm) and was prescribed medical treatment with atenolol and periodic controls to detect the presence of a critical diameter (50mm) that would indicate the need for prophylactic surgery.", 
    "116": "The parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) system has promise to rapidly screen drug candidate passive permeability, but has been poorly described in terms of its lipid membrane structure and function. The objective was to investigate the role of PAMPA lipid composition on the permeability of five model compounds. PAMPA was used and employed individual phospholipids that varied in phosphate head group and acyl chain unsaturation. Transport of benzoic acid, taurocholic acid, metoprolol, sucrose, and mannitol was measured. Membrane fluidity was assessed by 1,3-diphenylhexatriene fluorescence anisotropy. Results indicate that compound permeability across PAMPA differed in their sensitivity to membrane lipid composition, where compounds with appreciable permeability (i.e. at least 0.2 x 10(-6)cm/s) were possibly sensitive to membrane fluidity and apparent ion pair effects. Benzoic acid permeability ranged 51-fold across membrane types, suggesting acyl chain effect on membrane fluidity. Mannitol, sucrose, and taurocholic acid permeabilities were low and independent of lipid composition. Metoprolol permeability ranged 17-fold and exhibited a markedly high permeability across 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-L-serine] due to apparent ion pair-facilitated transport. Compound permeability was lowest across the phosphatidylcholines, which is consistent with phosphatidylcholine exhibiting relatively high membrane rigidity. In contrast to results from phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylserines, acyl chain unsaturation had no effect on permeability across phosphatidylcholines. In conclusion, while much remains unknown about PAMPA structure and subsequent PAMPA permeability, results here from five solutes suggest that, for solutes with appreciable permeability, lipid composition modulated drug permeability through possible membrane fluidity and apparent ion pair influences.",

Bcl-2 gene has a close connection with antagonizing oxidative stress destroy in many diseases including diabetes. Carvedilol, an adrenoceptor blocker, also has antioxidant and free radical scavenger properties. To study the effect of carvedilol on the antioxidant status and expression of Bcl-2 in healthy and diabetic hearts, we investigated carvedilol-administrated healthy and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. After small and large dosage (1 or 10mg/kg/d) carvedilol-administrated for 5 weeks, hemodynamic parameters, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and expression of Bcl-2 mRNA in the cardiac tissues of all six groups were measured. Diabetic rats had higher left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), lower maximal rate of rise/fall left ventricle pressure development and decline (+/-dP/dtmax). These parameters were improved by administration of carvedilol. Diabetic rats showed elevated MDA level and CAT activity, but lower activities of SOD and GSH-Px. Carvedilol treatment increased activities of antioxidant enzymes and expression of Bcl-2 in healthy rats as well as diabetic rats. These results indicate that carvedilol improves cardiac function via its antioxidant property in diabetic rats partly.",

The incidence of diabetes is unchanged or increased by the use of thiazide diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and unchanged or decreased by ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers). Recent results from ASCOT (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial) showed superiority of the 'new' combination of CCBs and ACE inhibitors over the 'old' or 'conventional' combination of beta-blockers and diuretics. In this review, the results from some of the large hypertension trials are discussed, and the hypotheses on how different antihypertensive drug regimens can affect glucose homeostasis are considered. The question now is whether the results from these recent trials should affect the choice of antihypertensive treatment, particularly for special groups. However, the key goal is still to reduce BP, and this usually requires combinations of drugs.", 
    "119": "A chronic administration of isoproterenol hydrochloride (60 mg/kg body weight; 30 days) alters the collagen metabolism in denervated gastrocnemius muscle of mice. Hydroxyproline assay for collagen showed an increase in collagen content by 47%, 44%, and 61% in innervated gastrocnemius + drug, denervated control, and denervated + drug, respectively, in gastrocnemius muscles after 30 days of drug administration. Collagen proliferation is beta-agonist (isoproterenol) specific confirmed with the simultaneous administration of beta-antagonist propranolol (100 mg/kg body weight; 30 days). Van Gieson staining showed heavy collagen proliferation in the epimysium region of the muscle section and adventitia of blood vessels and some specialized regions. However, denervated gastrocnemius muscle represented a heavy collagen proliferation in the endomysium region, which also is probably responsible for extensive collagen proliferation in denervated muscle after drug administration. The SDS-PAGE of pepsin-soluble collagen revealed five bands from origin to the point of migration, gamma, beta1, beta2, alpha1, and alpha2. The SDS-PAGE of CNBr-treated pepsin-insoluble collagen pointed toward the more prominent remodeling of collagen metabolism in the beta-agonist-induced denervated gastrocnemius muscle after drug administration. From the present study, we can conclude that beta-agonist, isoproterenol hydrochloride, augments collagen proliferation in innervated as well as in denervated gastrocnemius muscle.",

We describe an attempt at using the available CPOE functionality in a commercial ED information system to deliver guideline knowledge and report the results of physician surveys regarding paper-based guideline/order-sets and the corresponding CPOE order-sets that replaced them. Physicians reported that they liked the CPOE order-sets better than the paper version and did use the order-sets, but guide-line compliance did not improve. Cultural and organizational issues as well as limitations in the functionality of the commercial system appear to have limited the effectiveness of this implementation.",

Angiotensin II is involved in structural atrial remodeling, which contributes to the onset and maintenance of AF in paced animal models. We investigated the role of angiotensin II in atrial structural remodeling in rats with hypertension. Ten-week-old male Wistar-Kyoto rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: a control group (no treatment), an Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) group (administered L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, 1 g/l in drinking water), an L-NAME+candesartan group (L-NAME plus candesartan-an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)-at 0.1 mg/kg/day), and an L-NAME + hydralazine group (L-NAME plus hydralazine at 120 mg/l in drinking water). Eight weeks after treatment, the L-NAME group showed significantly higher systolic blood pressure than the control group (197 +/- 12 vs.138 +/- 5 mmHg, p < 0.05). Candesartan or hydralazine with L-NAME reduced systolic blood pressure to baseline. Chronic inhibition of NO synthesis increased the extent of fibrosis and transforming growth factor-beta expression in atrial tissue, and both of these effects were prevented by candesartan, but not by hydralazine. Cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction were induced in the L-NAME group, and these effects were also prevented by candesartan, but not by hydralazine. In contrast, the decrease in thrombomodulin expression in the atrial endocardium in hypertensive rats was restored by candesartan and hydralazine. The ARB prevented atrial structural remodeling, a possible contributing factor for the development of AF, in the hearts of rats with hypertension induced by long-term inhibition of NO synthesis.", 
    "130": "Mitochondrial Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m) regulates oxidative phosphorylation and thus contributes to energy supply and demand matching in cardiac myocytes. Mitochondria take up Ca2+ via the Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) and extrude it through the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (mNCE). It is controversial whether mitochondria take up Ca2+ rapidly, on a beat-to-beat basis, or slowly, by temporally integrating cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) transients. Furthermore, although mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux is governed by mNCE, it is unknown whether elevated intracellular Na+ ([Na+]i) affects mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and bioenergetics. To monitor [Ca2+]m, mitochondria of guinea pig cardiac myocytes were loaded with rhod-2-acetoxymethyl ester (rhod-2 AM), and [Ca2+]c was monitored with indo-1 after dialyzing rhod-2 out of the cytoplasm. [Ca2+]c transients, elicited by voltage-clamp depolarizations, were accompanied by fast [Ca2+]m transients, whose amplitude (delta) correlated linearly with delta[Ca2+]c. Under beta-adrenergic stimulation, [Ca2+]m decay was approximately 2.5-fold slower than that of [Ca2+]c, leading to diastolic accumulation of [Ca2+]m when amplitude or frequency of delta[Ca2+]c increased. The MCU blocker Ru360 reduced delta[Ca2+]m and increased delta[Ca2+]c, whereas the mNCE inhibitor CGP-37157 potentiated diastolic [Ca2+]m accumulation. Elevating [Na+]i from 5 to 15 mmol/L accelerated mitochondrial Ca2+ decay, thus decreasing systolic and diastolic [Ca2+]m. In response to gradual or abrupt changes of workload, reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH) levels were maintained at 5 mmol/L [Na+]i, but at 15 mmol/L, the NADH pool was partially oxidized. The results indicate that (1) mitochondria take up Ca2+ rapidly and contribute to fast buffering during a [Ca2+]c transient; and (2) elevated [Na+]i impairs mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, with consequent effects on energy supply and demand matching. The latter effect may have implications for cardiac diseases with elevated [Na+]i.", 
    "131": "Troponin T (TnT) mutations that cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) and sudden cardiac death frequently increase myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, suggesting that their Ca2+-sensitizing effect contributes importantly to the FHC pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we compared transgenic mice expressing the Ca2+-sensitizing TnT-I79N mutant (I79N), which causes a high rate of sudden cardiac death in patients, with mice expressing the more benign TnT-R278C mutant (R278C) that does not affect myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. Acutely increasing myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity with EMD57033 served as a positive control. Isovolumically contracting hearts were compared over a range of loading conditions (Frank-Starling curve). Consistent with their increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, I79N-Tg hearts demonstrated significantly higher systolic performance at low perfusate [Ca2+] compared with R278C-Tg hearts, which were not statistically different from control hearts expressing either human wild-type TnT or no transgene (CON). Diastolic function was impaired in both FHC mutants (time to 90% relaxation: I79N 48 +/- 1.0 ms, n = 10 or R278C 47 +/- 0.4 ms, n = 7, versus CON 44 +/- 1.0 ms, n = 20, P < 0.05). In the presence of isoproterenol, almost all contractile parameters of R278C hearts became indistinguishable from control hearts, whereas both systolic and diastolic function of I79N hearts significantly worsened (end-diastolic pressure: I79N 20 +/- 4 mmHg versus CON 13 +/- 2 mmHg or R278C 11 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.05). The Ca2+ sensitizer EMD57033 produced an even greater contractile dysfunction than the I79N mutation at fast pacing rates. In vivo, maximal exercise tolerance was significantly impaired only in I79N mice. Pretreatment with beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists abolished differences in exercise tolerance. In conclusion, the Ca2+-sensitizing effects of TnT mutations may reduce the responsiveness of mouse hearts to inotropic stimuli.",

Although no therapy was uniformly effective for intention tremor, ataxia, Parkinsonism, memory loss, or anxiety, some subjects with intention tremor or Parkinsonism reported improvement with medications frequently used in other movement disorders. Overall, all 22 subjects on medications reported improvement in one or more symptoms.

Clinical efficacy trials or their meta-analyses did not accurately predict the outcome of subsequent large studies. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy/safety of nebivolol 5-10 mg daily in a nationwide study of patients with mild hypertension. Secondary objectives were (1) to compare efficacy/safety as monotherapy versus add-on therapy and (2) to assess the effect of nebivolol on ISH. This was an open-label, 6-week follow-up study of 6,356 patients with mild hypertension or ISH, as defined by the 1999 World Health Organization guidelines, recruited from 2,700 facilities. Previous monotherapies were continued except for beta-blockers. Results are reported as means+/-SDs. Intention-to-treat analysis is given. A total of 5,740 patients completed the study; of the withdrawals, 90% were lost for follow-up or were noncompliant, 38% were untreated before, 23% had beta-blockers. In the accumulated data, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures fell by 24+/-14 and 13+/-9 mm Hg (both P<0.001). The differences between the blood pressure-reducing effects of nebivolol monotherapy and add-on therapy were not statistically significant: 28+/-16 and 22+/-14 mm Hg for systolic and 15+/-11 and 11+/-8 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressures. Adverse events were limited to 0.5% of the patients, no serious adverse events were observed. In the ISH patients, diastolic blood pressure fell by 4+/-6 mm Hg compared with 15+/-10 mm Hg in the no-ISH patients (P<0.01). Efficacy-safety effects of nebivolol in patients with mild hypertension can be generalized in a nationwide assessment.

We have previously demonstrated that human eosinophils express PPARgamma and that stimulation with a synthetic agonist for PPARgamma attenuated the factor-induced eosinophil activations. However, the modulator of PPARgamma expression in eosinophils has not yet been studied. In this study, we investigated the effect of procaterol, the synthetic beta2-adrenoceptor agonist widely used as bronchodilators in asthma, on the PPARgamma expression in eosinophils. Purified human peripheral blood eosinophil and the eosinophilic cell line EoL-1 were cultured with procaterol. This was followed by PPARgamma measurement using flow cytometer and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. We observed that PPARgamma was constitutively expressed by EoL-1 and the purified eosinophils and that the therapeutic concentration (10(-9)M) of procaterol markedly enhanced PPARgamma protein expression, which was reversed by the selective beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI-118551. The PPARgamma mRNA expression in EoL-1 and eosinophils was also induced by procaterol. These findings suggest that procaterol could modulate the eosinophil function by increasing the expression of PPARgamma.", 
    "147": "Mitral regurgitation (MR) is associated with increased neuronal release of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EP) into myocardial interstitial fluid (ISF) that may be necessary in sustaining left ventricular (LV) function via activation of cardiomyocyte beta-adrenergic receptors (ARs). However, activation of neuronal beta-ARs on cardiac neurons may lead to further catecholamine release, with an attendant risk of functional deterioration. We hypothesize that a beneficial effect of beta-AR blockade may therefore mitigate excessive catecholamine release from cardiac adrenergic neurons in dogs with MR. We measured the effects of chronic beta-receptor blockade (beta-RB) on ISF NE and EP release using in vivo microdialysis in open-chest anesthetized dogs after 4 wk of MR with or without extended release of metoprolol succinate (100 mg/day) as well as in control dogs. Fractional shortening increased by 30% in both MR and MR + beta-RB dogs after 4 wk of MR. In MR + beta-RB dogs, stellate-stimulated heart rate change was attenuated compared with control and MR dogs, whereas peak change of LV pressure over time (+dP/dt) increased equally in all groups. Stellate-stimulated ISF NE increased fivefold over baseline in MR versus twofold in control dogs (< 0.05), but the NE release was significantly attenuated in MR + beta-RB dogs. In contrast, stellate-stimulated increases in ISF EP did not differ in control, MR, and MR + beta-RB dogs. This study demonstrates that beta-RB attenuates ISF NE release from cardiac neurons and that the LV functional response to MR is not dependent on an excess increase in ISF NE. Thus beta1-RB may exert a beneficial effect by attenuating untoward effects of excessive sympathetic efferent neural NE release while sustaining early LV functional adaptation to MR.",

    "150": "Two weeks after childbirth, a 37-year-old previously healthy woman required urgent pericardiocentesis and inotropic support because of new-onset left ventricular systolic dysfunction, pericardial effusions, and hypotension. Analysis of pericardial fluid was negative for malignant cells and culture, and no cardiac tamponade or thrombus was evident. Results of a rheumatologic serology survey were negative, as was an assessment for antithyroid antibodies. Chest radiography revealed bilateral pleural effusions. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary showed a homogeneously enlarged gland, consistent with the postpartum state, but no discrete pituitary lesions. Laboratory results included low levels of thyrotropin, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, and cortisol and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The patient's symptoms responded to prednisone therapy (60 mg/day) as well as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a b -adrenergic blocking agent. Follow-up magnetic resonance images showed an atrophic pituitary with an empty sella turcica.",

    "152": "Beta amyloid protein (Abeta) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) have been shown to be closely implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In the current study, we investigated the effects of bis(7)-tacrine, a novel dimeric AChE inhibitor, on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in primary cortical neurons. Bis(7)-tacrine, but not other AChE inhibitors, elicited a marked reduction of both fibrillar and soluble oligomeric forms of Abeta-induced apoptosis as evidenced by chromatin condensation and DNA specific fragmentation. Both nicotinic and muscarinic receptor antagonists failed to block the effects of bis(7)-tacrine. Instead, nimodipine, a blocker of L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs), attenuated Abeta neurotoxicity, whereas N-, P/Q- or R-type VDCCs blockers and ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists did not. Fluorescence Ca2+ imaging assay revealed that, similar to nimodipine, bis(7)-tacrine reversed Abeta-triggered intracellular Ca2+ increase, which was mainly contributed by the extracellular Ca2+ instead of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria Ca2+. Concurrently, using whole cell patch-clamping technique, it was found that bis(7)-tacrine significantly reduced the augmentation of high voltage-activated inward calcium currents induced by Abeta. These results suggest that bis(7)-tacrine attenuates Abeta-induced neuronal apoptosis by regulating L-type VDCCs, offers a novel modality as to how the agent exerts neuroprotective effects.",

Timolol 0.5% was administered first twice daily for 4 consecutive days. Dorzolamide 2.0% was administered next three times daily for 4 consecutive days. The fixed combination of the two (timolol 0.5% and dorzolamide 2.0%) was administered twice daily for 4 consecutive days during the final week of the study. Between administration of each drug, a withdrawal period of at least 10 days was instituted. Statistical comparisons between the effects of the three drugs were performed.",

After 4 days of treatment, the IOP decreased even further: timolol alone, dorzolamide alone, and the combination of the two decreased IOP 3.75 +/- 0.88 mmHg, 7.50 +/- 0.29 mmHg, and 8.42 +/- 0.58 mmHg, respectively. Heart rate was significantly decreased with timolol (-11.9 +/- 2.0 bpm) and the combination preparation (-8.6 + 2.4 bpm), but not with dorzolamide (-3.7 +/- 1.8 bpm) alone.

    "157": "Experiments were performed to investigate the nature of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in blood vessels supplying the posterior capsule of the chronically inflamed rabbit knee joint, and results were compared to the finding from previous experiments on the normal and acutely inflamed joint to assess any alteration which may occur in the adrenoceptor profile due to the chronic inflammation process. Electrical stimulation of the posterior articular nerve resulted in vasoconstriction that was completely blocked by phentolamine. This constrictor response was almost equally inhibited by prazosin and yohimbine. The dose-response curves to close intraarterial injection of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists showed a rank-order potency of adrenaline = clonidine = phenylephrine. The adrenaline dose-response curve was shifted to the right by administration of alpha-antagonists with a rank-order potency of phentolamine = prazosin = yohimbine. At this stage of experiments, there was an equal response of alpha(1)- and alpha(2)- adrenoceptors in blood vessels of the chronically inflamed rabbit knee joint. In another group of animals, the neurally mediated vasodilatation, which appeared after administration of phentolamine, was completely blocked by propranolol and was reduced significantly by ICI118551, but the effect of atenolol was not significant. The dose-response curve to close intraarterial injection of beta-adrenoceptor agonists showed a rank-order potency of: isoprenaline > salbutamol > dobutamine. The isoprenaline dose-response curve was shifted to the right by administration of beta-antagonists with rank-order potency of propranolol > ICI118551 > atenolol. These experiments showed a greater beta(2)-adrenoceptor response than beta(1)-adrenoceptor response in chronically inflamed rabbit-knee-joint blood vessels. Overall, compared to previous experiments on normal joint in which alpha(2)- and beta(1)-adrenoceptor responses predominated, and in acutely inflamed joint in which an equal alpha(1)/alpha(2) and beta(1)/beta(2) response was shown, in chronically inflamed joint the sympathetic constriction response was returned toward normal. No more alpha-adrenoceptor shift had happened, and the shift of beta(1) to beta(2) response continued.",

The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of ICD:conventional therapy for first and recurrent HF events were 1.39 (P=0.02) and 1.58 (P<0.001), respectively. The risk was increased among patients who received single-chamber or dual-chamber ICDs. Development of HF was associated with an increased mortality risk (HR, 3.80; P<0.001). Among patients who received a single-chamber ICD, there was a similar survival benefit before and after the development of HF (HR, 0.59 and 0.61, respectively; P=0.92 for difference), whereas among patients with dual-chamber devices, there was a significant reduction in survival benefit after HF (HR, 0.26 and 0.83, respectively; P=0.01 for difference). Within the defibrillator arm of the trial, patients who received life-prolonging therapy from the ICD had an increased risk for first and recurrent HF events (HR, 1.90; P=0.01 and 1.74; P<0.001, respectively).",

Use of NYHA class alone predicted the development of acute HF decompensation in only 56% and the absence of this event in 93% of patients. Use of echocardiographic indices (systolic PAP < 40 mmHg or E/A ratio < 1.4 or EDT > 145 ms) predicted the absence of acute HF decompensation in 100% of patients. Use of NYHA > 3 combined with BNP > 398 pg/ml or with echocardiographic indices (i.e. systolic PAP > 40 mmHg or E/A > 1.4 or EDT < 145 ms) predicted the development of acute HF decompensation in 100% of patients. In conclusion use of BNP and echocardiographic LV filling pressure indices in combination with NYHA class may predict beta-blocker tolerance more accurately than clinical indices alone in patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 40%).",

However, the Hispanic patients were 11.9 years younger (P< 0.001) with 14.7% more women (P = 0.002) which reduces the risk of post-CTS AF; they also had a 12.8% higher risk of valvular surgery (P = 0.009) which is known to enhance the risk. When these factors and other important variables were matched for, a total of 485 patients (n = 97 Hispanics, 388 Caucasian) were evaluated (55.8 +/- 13.1 years, 57.3% male, 45.4% valvular surgery).

    "174": "Cardiac variability can be assessed from two perspectives: beat-to-beat performance and continuous performance during the cardiac cycle. Linear analysis techniques assess cardiac variability by measuring the physical attributes of a signal, whereas nonlinear techniques evaluate signal dynamics. This study sought to determine if recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), a nonlinear technique, could detect pharmacologically induced autonomic changes in the continuous left ventricular pressure (LVP) and electrographic (EC) signals from an isolated rat heart-a model that theoretically contains no inherent variability. LVP and EC signal data were acquired simultaneously during Langendorff perfusion of isolated rat hearts before and after the addition of acetylcholine (n = 11), norepinephrine (n = 12), or no drug (n = 12). Two-minute segments of the continuous LVP and EC signal data were analyzed by RQA. Findings showed that%recurrence,%determinism, entropy, maxline, and trend from the continuous LVP signal significantly increased in the presence of both acetylcholine and norepinephrine, although systolic LVP significantly increased only with norepinephrine. In the continuous EC signal, the RQA trend variable significantly increased in the presence of norepinephrine. These results suggest that when either the sympathetic or parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system overwhelms the other, the dynamics underlying cardiac variability become stationary. This study also shows that information concerning inherent variability in the isolated rat heart can be gained via RQA of the continuous cardiac signal. Although speculative, RQA may be a tool for detecting alterations in cardiac variability and evaluating signal dynamics as a nonlinear indicator of cardiac pathology.", 
    "175": "Hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are major cardiovascular risk factors, and often cluster in the same individual in the context of the metabolic syndrome. Management of hypertension in the diabetic patient is extremely important, and agents from all major antihypertensive classes are effective towards this goal. Conventional beta-blockers are associated with detrimental effects on insulin sensitivity, glycaemic control, and the incidence of type 2 DM and thus are less often used in hypertensive patients with DM. In contrast, the newer vasodilating beta-blockers appear to be free of adverse effects on the above metabolic parameters, and could be a valuable tool for hypertension treatment in patients with DM or the metabolic syndrome. This review summarizes the evidence on the effects of antihypertensive treatment with both traditional and vasodilating beta-blockers on parameters related to carbohydrate metabolism, and discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms that may be responsible.", 
    "176": "In recent years, great attention has been paid to using solid dispersions to make sustained-release drugs. The objective of this study is to produce sustained-release systems of metoprolol tartrate using solid dispersion techniques and to evaluate their physicochemical characteristics. The solid dispersions were produced by melting and solvent methods, containing 7%, 15%, or 25% of the drug and different ratios of Eudragit RLPO and RSPO in ratios of 0:10, 3:7, 5:5, 7:3, and 10:0. Drug release profiles were determined by USP XXIII rotating paddle method in phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8). XRD, DSC, IR, and microscopic observations were performed to evaluate the physical characteristics of solid dispersions. Results showed that the drug release from dispersions was at a slower rate than pure drug and physical mixtures. Moreover, the formulations containing greater ratios of Eudragit RSPO showed slower release rates and smaller DE8% but larger mean dissolution time than those containing greater ratios of Eudragit RLPO. Dispersions with particle size of less than 100 microm containing 7% of metoprolol and Eudragit RL:RS 5:5 (solvent method) and those with the ratio of 3:7 (melting method) had similar release pattern to Lopressor sustained-release tablets by zero-order and Higuchi kinetics, respectively."
