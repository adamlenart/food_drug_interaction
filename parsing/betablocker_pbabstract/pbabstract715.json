Fetal O2 consumption, O2 content, and O2 tension in umbilical blood decreased significantly before the decline in heart rate. Fetal arterial blood pressure did not change significantly. Complete vagal blockade abolished the late deceleration and uncovered a late acceleration, which in turn was eliminated by total beta-adrenergic blockade. We conclude that these late decelerations in normoxic sheep are vagally mediated and due to chemoreceptor rather than baroreceptor activity.", 
    "1": "After an explanation of the treatment of hypertension the results of a clinical study using the combination product Cardiotensin are presented. The results in regard to the components of this product show, that the medicament can be used in hypertension show, that the medicament can be used in hypertension stages I and II and in primary and secondary hypertension especially inthe age of 30--50 years at lower doses without severe side effects.", 
    "2": "Chronic treatment with various drugs reduced the increase in arterial blood pressure, the ventricular hypertrophy and the thickening of pulmonary arterial and arteriolar walls.", 
    "3": "A 53-year-old woman presented a clinical picture of hypercalcemia as the first and most prominent manifestation of hyperthyroidism. The possibility of a coexistent hyperparathyroidism was excluded, as well as any other potential cause of hypercalcemia. The hypercalcemia and its clinical manifestations disappeared a month after the antithyroid therapy was started. After 2 years, the calcemia and renal and thyroid functions continue normal. The association of hyperthyroidism and hypercalcemia is well known, but only rarely is hypercalcemia responsible for prominent clinical symptoms. It is very infrequent for the manifestations of hypercalcemia to precede those of hyperthyroidism.", 
    "4": "Several changes were noted in the characteristics of the turkey erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptor and in the kinetic properties of adenylate cyclase following pretreatment of erythrocyte membranes with isoproterenol and GMP, and thorough washing to remove these agents. The changes include modifications in the binding of agonist (isoproterenol) and in revelation of marked effects of GTP on agonist binding; reduction in the lag in Gpp(NH)p activation of adenylate cyclase; short lived activation by GTP which is lengthened by treatment with cholera toxin and NAD prior to pretreatment with isoproterenol and GMP. Treatment with cholera toxin also shortened the lag in activation by Gpp(NH)p and increased the steady state levels of activation by both Gpp(NH)p and GTP. The following conclusions can be drawn: (i) catecholamines, in the presence of a guanine nucleotide, stimulate the exchange of bound and exogenous nucleotide; (ii) the exchange reaction is involved in both the activation of adenylate cyclase and in the reciprocal effects of hormone and guanine nucleotides on each other's binding: (iii) the beta-adrenergic receptor and nucleotide regulatory components are linked in turkey erythrocyte membranes; (iv) both cholera toxin and catecholamines, although by different mechanisms, stimulate the exchange reaction at the nucleotide regulatory sites.", 
    "5": "The association of recumbent hypertension with orthostatic hypotension provides a clinical situation which is extremely difficult to treat. The present report describes two patients who presented with this disorder and evaluates the use of pindolol in their management.", 
    "6": "Incubation of rat cerebral cortical slices with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol causes an increase in alpha 2-adrenergic receptor binding in addition to a decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor binding. The effects are rapid and reversible, show a parallel time course, and are blocked by sotalol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. The beta-mediated regulation of alpha 2-receptor sensitivity at brain norepinephrine synapses may be a mechanism for the homeostatic control of central noradrenergic activity.", 
    "7": "Based upon suggestions of Lader (1976) about a diagnostic scale of various anxiety states it is discussed if beta-blockers influence mainly the peripheric vegetative symptoms of anxiety and stress and tranquilizers mainly cognitive anxiety. Results of a study in 51 labile volunteers between 19 and 26 years of age are reported. After a six weeks treatment with pindolol compared to chlordiazepoxide and placebo a significant reduction of trait anxiety after beta-blocker treatment was observed. These effects resembled those usually seen after tranquilizer application.", 
    "8": "The author tries to answer the following questions: Which properties have the different beta-blockers, especially with regard to their cardioselectivity, lipoid solubility, bio-availability, membrane stabilizing effect and intrinsic sympathicomimetic activity? Which side effects and contraindications have the beta-blockers? How do the beta-blockers lower high blood pressure? With which antihypertensive substances should beta-blockers be combined? Do the beta-blockers have a cardioprotective effect?", 
    "9": "In order to define the adrenergic receptors in small pial blood vessels, we studied [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding, [3H]dihydroergocryptine (DHE) binding, and catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase in membranes prepared from the hog pia. [3H]dha bound to a saturable number of sites (0.09 pmol/mg protein) with a high affinity to (10 mM). The ability of a small series of adrenergic agents to compete for [3H]DHA binding was as expected for binding to beta-adrenergic membrane receptors. The receptor binding appeared to be composed largely of beta 2-adrenergic sites but some sites with beta 1 properties were detected. The beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, stimulated adenylate cyclase activity by 20% in pial membranes in the presence of GTP. The potency of catecholamines in stimulating adenylate cyclase correlated well with theif sites (0.39 pmol/mg) on these membranes. alpha-Adrenergic agents were potent competitors for [3H]DHE binding but dopamine, serotonin and histamine had effects only at high concentrations. These data demonstrate the presence of alpha- and beta-adrenergic membrane receptors and beta-adrenergically stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in small pial blood vessels from the hog.", 
    "10": "Forty patients with primary and secondary glaucoma were treated with the beta-blocking agent Timolol for six months. We used a 0.25% or 0.5% solution twice a day. In several cases sufficient pressure regulation was achieved by means of Timolol monotherapy. If pilocarpine or acetazolamide therapy was not sufficient we used a combination therapy with Timolol.", 
    "11": "A technique suitable for continuous measurement of beat-to-beat cardiac output in conscious rabbits for relatively longer periods is described. The method consists, essentially, of implanting a specially constructed electromagnetic flow probe around either the pulmonary artery or the aorta during left thoracotomy (second intercostal space) in animals anesthetized with hypnorm. With care, the procedure is successful in a large proportion of the animals. Little postoperative care is required and the flow probe remains functional for several weeks up until the animals were killed to recover the probe for reimplantation. The cardiac output values (ml/min/kg) in conscious rabbits were: normal 183 +/- 9; unilateral renal hypertensive animals, 108 +/- 10 and bilateral renal hypertensive animals, 153 +/- 15. Isoprenaline increased, and propranolol decreased, the cardiac output in conscious normotensive rabbits.", 
    "12": "1. The changes in cardiac output and mean right atrial pressure (R.A.P.) evoked by stimulation of the cardiac autonomic nerves were investigated in cats under chloralose anaesthesia, with unopened chests and spontaneous respiration, and with active vascular reflexes. Cardiac output was measured by thermal dilution; the technique used was calibrated against the direct Fick method.2. The initial values of R.A.P. and output were varied by infusion of dextran-saline solution followed by withdrawal of blood. At positive values of R.A.P. withdrawal of blood caused a fall in R.A.P. with no change in cardiac output. At negative R.A.P. blood withdrawal caused a fall in output with little change in R.A.P.: the linear regression coefficient for output on R.A.P. was 48.2 ml./min.kg.mmHg (S.E. 2.06, n = 63, nine cats).3. Stimulation of the right cardiac sympathetic nerve increased heart rate by 69.2 beats/min (S.E. 4.0) from the resting rate of 158 beats/min (S.E. 6.3, ten cats). The acceleration was accompanied in most instances by a rise in cardiac output and a fall in R.A.P. and the magnitude of the rise in output was related to that of the fall in R.A.P.4. In no experiment could R.A.P. be reduced below -2.5 mmHg either by withdrawal of blood or by sympathetic stimulation. At negative values of R.A.P. the fall in R.A.P. and rise in output evoked by sympathetic stimulation were small; substantial changes could be obtained only from positive initial values of R.A.P. The proportional increase in output evoked by a given proportional increase in heart rate during near-maximal sympathetic stimulation had a linear relationship to the initial value of R.A.P. over the range -2 to +8 mmHg. The output increment was less than proportional to the rate increment at all values of R.A.P. below +3 mmHg.5. In five experiments stimulation of the left cardiac sympathetic nerve evoked a greater increase in output for a given increase in heart rate than did stimulation of the right nerve; on the other hand both nerves gave similar increments of output for a given fall in R.A.P.6. Stimulation of the distal end of the right vagus nerve slowed the heart and caused a fall in cardiac output and a rise in R.A.P. The change in output associated with a given change in R.A.P. was significantly greater (P = 0.05) during sympathetic than during vagal stimulation in 14 out of 18 tests; the difference increased as circulating volume was reduced.7. It is concluded that the relationship between cardiac output and R.A.P. during sympathetic and vagal stimulation is consistent with the hypothesis that neurally evoked changes in cardiac performance vary output mainly, but not exclusively, by inducing changes in R.A.P. which alter the pressure gradient for the return of blood to the right atrium from the periphery.", 
    "13": "The effects of dopamine (DA) were studied in vivo on the pulmonary airway resistance of the unanaesthetized guinea-pig, and in vitro, on the isolated trachea of the same animal. DA relaxes the isolated trachea previously contracted by ACh, but only at very high concentrations (10(-4) to 10(-3) M) and appears to be approximately 7000 times less active than isoprenaline (ISO). The relaxation caused by DA is: (1) diminished by pretreatment with cocaine or reserpine indicating an indirect effect linked to a release of endogenous catecholamines; (2) increased by phentolamine, suggesting a masked contracting alpha-adrenergic component; (3) completely abolished by propranolol through competitive antagonism. In vivo, DA reduces the increase in pulmonary airway resistance provoked by ACh. Its action, which is mainly beta-adrenergic, is, nevertheless, 1.4 x 10(5) times less than that of ISO. Thus, dopaminoreceptors do not seem to exist in the tracheobronchial smooth muscle of the guinea-pig. DA only has partial beta-adrenergic agonistic action at that site.", 
    "14": "A 35-year-old man who was on treatment for mild arterial hypertension with the beta-blocking agent pindolol and who was accustomed to regular physical exercise, developed severe hypoglycaemia and bradycardia during a routine skiing tour. He recovered from the attack, and subsequent studies revealed no abnormalities of glucose metabolism. Apparently the hypoglycaemic attack was due to the combined effects of prolonged physical exercise of moderate degree and beta-blockade on glucose metabolism.", 
    "15": "Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles for metoprolol have been measured in six healthy volunteers after single and multiple dosing with 100 mg conventional formulation twice daily and 200 mg slow-release formulation once daily. Both multidose regimes produced measurable predosing plasma concentrations of metoprolol. The plasma concentrations on the eighth day were greater than predicted by the single-dose data as indicated by the comparison of the total areas under the curve for the single dose and the dosage interval areas during multiple dosing. This increase may be associated with a change in the bioavailability and/or clearance of the drug and is currently being investigated. The peak concentrations for the two regimens were comparable but the times to peak with the slow-release regimen were significantly delayed. Both regimes produced significant beta-blocking effects over 24 h during multiple dosing, the reductions in exercise heart rate at 0 and 24 h on the eighth day corresponding to more than 20% of the maximum effect. Resting pulse rates and blood pressures were affected to a similar extent by the two regimens but neither significantly altered respiratory peak flow rates. The effects during multiple dosing were generally greater than those after a single dose and appeared to follow a more consistent trend. This observation, together with those for the plasma level data on the eighth day, illustrate the importance of performing multiple-dose studies in assessing beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "16": "Plasma propranolol concentration-effect-time data obtained from the literature were analyzed by applying a theory for correlating the observed kinetic data with the pharmacological (antianginal) effects using the elimination rate constant (Kel) and the slope of log concentration-effect relationship (m). The plasma propranolol concentrations yield the first-order rate elimination while the drug effects decline linerarly with time at the zero-order rate as proposed by the theory. The rate of decline of drug effects derived from the application of the theory (\"theoretical\" Rd) was found to be in reasonable agreement with that actually observed in the effect-time interrelations (\"observed\" Rd), which will imply that the longer duration of the antianginal effects of propranolol is explainable with its short half-life.", 
    "17": "Isometric strain gauge arches attached transversely and longitudinally to cervical trachealis muscle (CTM) recorded spontaneous mechanical activities (SMA), passive constriction, and longitudinal tension in 64 dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. Inspiratory tracheal elongation increased longitudinal tension and passively constricted CTM. Occasional overlapping of tracheal cartilages observed on initial exposure of cervical trachea appeared to be due to unprovoked persistent increases in SMA. Three major types of rhythmic SMA oscillations occurred in 42 lightly anesthetized dogs: slow oscillations 50 - 200 s/cycle (19 dogs); sinelike waves 20-30 s/cycle (12 dogs); and sinelike waves superimposed on slow oscillations (11 dogs). These rhythms were dampened by pharmacologically induced incrases or decreases in SMA. They disappeared following deeper anesthesia, atropinization, or bilateral vagotomy. Intravenous acetylcholine increased while isoproterenol decreased SMA before and after bilateral vagotomy in spontaneously breathing dogs as well as in artificially ventilated curarized dogs whose tracheas were isolated in situ. Atropine blocked acetylcholine actions and propranolol blocked those of isoproterenol. Changes in SMA induced pharmacologically did not correlate with simulatenous alterations in systemic arterial pressure of ventilatory patterns.", 
    "18": "In acute experiments on cats under autoperfusion of the denervated shank vessels with a constant blood volume, injection of noradrenaline into the perfusate could either decrease or increase vascular capacitance. The character and magnitude of reaction depended on the initial level of venous pressure: in pressure 10--15 Hg the decrease was predominant, whereas in pressure 0 and 25 mm Hg--the increase of vascular capacitance occurred. Under blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors with propranolol the dependence of the character of changes in shank vessels capacitance remained the same. Under dihydroergotoxin blockade of alpha-adrenoreceptors, noradrenaline produced only an insignificant increase of the vascular capacitance.", 
    "19": "A combination of propranolol and hydrallazine was administered to 13 patients with longstanding hypertension during 15 pregnancies. Hydrallazine was continued through labour and delivery in all patients, while in eight patients propranolol was discontinued 2 to 15 days before delivery. Blood pressure control was uniformly good and superimposed pre-eclampsia did not occur during combined therapy. There were 14 livebirths and one unexplained stillbirth. Except for two cases of milk hypoglycemia, there were no neonatal complications.", 
    "20": "Despite their widespread usage the effect of beta blockers on human performance has been only sparsely studied and results of investigations are discrepant. This study examines the effect of one of the most commonly prescribed beta adrenergic blocking drugs, propranolol, on psychomotor function. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the test method and to provide some basis for comparison, the effect of small doses of sodium amylobarbitone on psychomotor performance is also measured. Results indicate that propranolol in a single dose of 40 mg produces a small but significant decrement of performance, an effect comparable to that of 25 mg of sodium amylobarbitone. Habituation to chronic administration of propranolol at a daily dose level of 120 mg is also apparent. The clinical significance of these effects, particularly in aviation medicine, is discussed.", 
    "21": "A nitrogen mustard analog of propranolol was synthesized as a potential lung-specific antitumor agent. Since dl-propranolol concentrates in lung tissue and beta-blocking activity resides only with the l-enantiomer, the d-modification could serve as a lung-directed carrier for a cytotoxic group. Reaction of 1-(1-naphthyloxy)-3-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-propanol with thionyl chloride resulted in replacement of all three hydroxyl groups with chlorine. The necessary chlorination selectivity was achieved with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in dimethylformamide solution to provide propranolol mustard, 1-(1-naphthyloxy)-3-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]-2-propanol. Both the trichloro compound and propranolol mustard showed reproducible activity against P-388 leukemia. Neither compound was active against the B16 tumor or Lewis lung carcinoma.", 
    "22": "Plasma 1-norepinephrine and epinephrine contents were strikingly elevated in 70 patients during evolution of myocardial infarction. Propranolol or placebo, 0.1 mg/kg i.v., was administered randomly an average of 10 h after infarction and continued orally for 3 d. Propranolol, but not placebo, acutely decreased 1-norepinephrine contents from 2.24 +/- 1.33 (mean +/- SD) to 1.31 +/- 0.74 microgram/liter, P less than 0.001, and epinephrine contents from 0.97 +/- 0.42 to 0.74 +/- 0.42 microgram/liter, P less than 0.02. Decreases in 1-norepinephrine contents were related to the initial plasma concentrations, r = 0.85, P less than 0.001. A similar, but less strong relationship was observed between the initial epinephrine contents and propranolol-induced changes, r = -0.51, P less than 0.01. Propranolol reduced plasma-free fatty acid contents from 1,121 +/- 315 to 943 +/- 274 mumol/liter, P less than 0.001. Decreases in plasma contents of free fatty acids were related to decreases in epinephrine, r = 0.66, P less than 0.001. Propranolol did not cause significant additional changes in plasma catecholamine contents during the subsequent 3 d. In the placebo group 1-norepinephrine contents had decreased 24 h after infarction from 1.92 +/- 0.99 to 1.37 +/- 0.93 microgram/liter, P less than 0.02. Plasma epinephrine contents did not change. Heart rate remained below the control values during the entire study period in the propranolol, but increased in the placebo group. The data indicate that sympathetic hyperactivity, indirectly reflected by plasma catecholamine contents, is acutely reduced by propranolol during evolution of myocardial infarction.", 
    "23": "The effects of propranolol on blood pressure, plasma catecholamine concentration and platelet aggregation were examined in 16 patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension. The patients were studied at rest, during isometric handrip stress and 48 hours after sudden discontinuation of propranolol therapy. Plasma catecholamine concentration and platelet aggregation studies were also carried out in 11 age-matched normotensive and healthy subjects at rest. Plasma catecholamine concentration and platelet aggregation were greater in the hypertensive than in the normotensive subjects, but the difference reached statistical significance for aggregation only. Exercise significantly increased catecholamines and platelet aggregability. The administration of propranolol (240 mg/day) produced a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressue and in aggregation (the percent of light transmission at 1 microM adenosine diphosphate, at rest) and a significant increase in catecholamine concentration. However, propranolol did not prevent the changes in all these variables with exercise. The abrupt discontinuation of propranolol was not associated with any subjective or objective untoward cardiovascular effect or abnormal changes in plasma catecholamines. However, in some patients the platelet aggregation studies demonstrated a hyperaggregable state, which may be due to a state of supersensitivity of platelets to circulating catecholamines.", 
    "24": "Three patients with no history of asthma or allergy developed bronchospasm while taking propranolol for hypertension. The bronchospasm was severe in all three and in one patient resulted in respiratory arrest. Since the bronchospasm was relieved with discontinuation of propranolol and supportive bronchodilator therapy, the bronchospasm was believed to be caused by propranolol. Furthermore, each patient was subsequently treated with other antihypertensive medications which, like propranolol, contain the stabilizer additive tartrazine. Bronchospasm did not recur, making it unlikely that tartrazine hypersensitivity caused this problem. Regardless of a negative history of asthma, therefore, life-threatening bronchospasm must be considered a possible complication of propranolol therapy.", 
    "25": "A 50-70% depletion in the anterior pituitary concentration of PRL occurred within 5 min of electrical stimulation of a single abdominal mammary nerve of urethane-anesthetized lactating rats previously nonsuckled for 6-8 h. The stimulus parameters were: 1-msec pulses, 10-20/sec at 5-30 V applied 5 sec on and 10 sec off. The anterior pituitary concentration of PRL remained low for another 15-30 min after depletion, then repleted to prestimulus levels by the 90th min. The same pattern of depletion-repletion occurred when mammary nerve stimulation was applied for 5 min as when it was applied for 180 min. In other experiments, plasma PRL concentration rose swiftly and attained a maximal level, 4- to 5-fold in Wistar rats and 8- to 10-fold in Holtzman rats, above basal concentrations within 10-15 min of mammary nerve stimulation. The maximal level was sustained throughout the time the nerve was stimulated and for 45 min after the stimulation was stopped, i.e. the sustained secretion of PRL into the plasma occurred at the same time that depleted PRL was repleting. Ligation of both adrenals or iv injection of the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, before stimulation of the nerve had no effect upon the plasma PRL profile in response to mammary nerve stimulation. These data indicate that mammary nerve stimulation mimics that of suckling upon depletion, repletion, and the release of PRL into the circulation and add further support to the hypothesis that these phases are independent processes.", 
    "26": "Two cases of chloral hydrate overdosage were associated with multiform ventricular tachycardia. Both were refractory to a number of antiarrhythmics, but responded to propranolol administration. Two of nine other cases reported in the literature also responded to beta-blocking agents. Mechanisms for the arrhythmia and its apparent response to beta blockade are discussed.", 
    "27": "The possibility of an action of propranolol which reduces traffic in the sympathetic nervous system and/or reduces release of norepinephrine at sympathetic nerve endings has been investigated in normal subjects. Plasma norephinephrine was measured in resting supine subjects before and during infusions of sodium nitroprusside which reduced the systolic blood pressure by approximately 10 and later by 20 mm Hg. In 5 subjects these observations were repeated 2 hr after a single 200-mg oral dose of propranolol and in 3 they were repeated after 2 to 8 wk of propranolol 320 mg twice daily. In the control experiments, plasma norepinephrine increased from 0.22 up to 0.74 ng/ml when the blood pressure was reduced by 17/15 mm Hg. Corresponding figures 2 hr after 200 mg propranolol were an increase of plasma norepinephrine from 0.30 or 0.79 ng/ml with a reduction of blood pressure of 19/15 mm Hg. After long-term treatment with 640 mg propranolol daily, a similar reduction of pressure with sodium nitroprusside increased plasma norepinephrine from 0.24 to 0.68 ng/ml. There was no significant alteration in the elevation of plasma norepinephrine following blood pressure reduction with nitroprusside after either short- or long-term treatment with propranolol. These experiments do not suggest a significant role for a nervous system effect of propranolol in modifying sympathetic activity.", 
    "28": "The purpose of this study was determination of the prognostic value of clinical and tissue (biopsy) findings of 139 patients with cardiomyopathy. The types of cardiomyopathy were congestive (113 patients) and hypertrophic or constrictive (26 patients). The mean follow-up period of all patients was 4.3 years. Follow-up of the survivors was between 13 months and 11.9 years, mean 5.4 years. Of the 47 cardiac deaths (33.8%), the minimum and maximum follow-up was two weeks and 7.5 years, respectively (mean 2.1 years). Patients with congestive heart failure had the highest five year cardiac mortality rate (51.8%). Coexisting cardiac arrhythmia had no influence on prognosis and an arrhythmia only was benign in most patients. Myocardial hypertrophy or fibrosis or both and myocardium with no pathologic diagnosis had prognostic value. Small-vessel disease was infrequent and not associated with specific clinical manifestations.", 
    "29": "The effect of propranolol treatment (60 mg per day, three days) on glucose disposal rate (K-value) was investigated in nine patients with hyperthyroidism. K-value was improved in 4 cases and aggravated in 5 cases. The fasting levels of plasma free fatty acids (FFA) before the administration of propranolol in the improved cases were significantly higher than those in the aggravated cases. The propranolol treatment markedly reduced FFA levels only in the improved cases. These results suggest that the impaired glucose tolerance frequently seen in hyperthyroidism patients could be partly attributed to the increased level of plasma FFA.", 
    "30": "1. Experiments were conducted in isolated perfused rat kidneys to determine the effect of raising perfusate albumin concentration on renin release.2. Raising albumin concentration in the perfusion fluid from 20 g/l. to 60 g/l. (high albumin concentration) increased renin release and renal perfusate flow rate. The effect was reversible.3. Ureteral occlusion did not prevent the rise in renin release and renal perfusate flow induced by high albumin concentration.4. Propranolol (0.28 mM) did not block the renin release stimulated by high albumin concentration, but it inhibited the release stimulated by isoprenaline (2.43 muM).5. Clonidine (10 muM) and oxymetazoline (10 muM) constricted the renal vasculature and stimulated renin release during high perfusate albumin concentration providing perfusion pressure was kept constant.6. Low renal perfusion pressure (50 mmHg) and isoprenaline (2.43 muM) stimulated renin release in perfusion experiments with both 20 and 60 g/l., but the rate of renin release was substantially greater with 60 g/l.7. On the other hand, perfusion fluid deprived of calcium induced a greater increase in renin release in kidneys perfused with 20 g/l. than in those with 60 g/l.8. We conclude that high albumin concentration stimulates renin release in isolated perfused rat kidneys by a mechanism which does not involve the renal nerve, direct renal vasodilation or sodium excretion. High albumin concentration may increase the sensitivity of the kidney to acute stimulation by a mechanism involving calcium.", 
    "31": "Labetalol administered intra-gastrically in a dose of 30 mg/kg twice a day for 3 weeks significantly lowered systolic tail blood pressure (STBP) in chronic two-kidney Goldblatt hypertension in rats. Hypotensive response of labetalol in normotensive rats has also been demonstrated. Plasma renin activity (PRA) measured at the end of the treatment was similar in labetalol-treated and in dextrose-treated rats. The bradycardial response was evident in both hypertensive as well as in normotensive animals; however,, this change was statistically significant for the hypertensive rats only. Hypertension was associated with increase in the heart weight, which was not affected by labetalol treatment. Antihypertensive effect of labetalol is neither related to renin suppression nor to beta blockade.", 
    "32": "Two hundred twenty-three patients were randomly selected to receive propranolol, 10 mg orally every 6 hours, or to serve as controls after coronary artery bypass grafting. The study began at the time of discharge from the intensive care unit. Patients were ineligible if they had cardiac arrhythmias while in the intensive care unit, low cardiac output requiring catecholamine support, or bradycardia requiring a pacemaker. In the control group, cardiac arrhythmias for which treatment was necessary developed in 31 of 136 patients (23%), atrial fibrillation or flutter in 24 patients (18%), and ventricular arrhythmias in 7 (5%). In the group receiving propranolol, cardiac arrhythmias requiring treatment developed in 9 of 87 patients (10%), atrial fibrillation or flutter in 7 (8%), and ventricular arrhythmias in 2 (2%). The difference in frequency with which cardiac arrhythmias occurred between the two groups is significantly different (p less than 0.05). We conclude that propranolol is effective in the prevention of cardiac arrhythmias following coronary artery bypass grafting.", 
    "33": "Coagulation factor VIII activity has been assayed in nine normal volunteers before and after acute hypoglycaemia. In all subjects there was a rise in activity with a mean increment of 96%. Control studies using saline failed to demonstrate any change. In four subjects with pre-ganglionic sympathetctomy no increase in activity was observed. In the normal subjects the increase was blocked by propranolol but not by metoprolol, indicating mediation via beta2 receptors.", 
    "34": "Repetitive oral propranolol administration to rats (100 mg/kg/day for 5 days) resulted in an 80% inhibition of propranolol Type I spectral binding capacity. This paralleled a similar reduction in the microsomal metabolism of propranolol when incubated at low substrate concentrations (less than 2 microM). Propranolo was converted both in vitro and in vivo by a microsomal mixed function oxidase to a reactive intermediate metabolite capable of covalently binding with microsomal macromolecules. We propose that covalent binding of the intermediate to the catalytic site of a form(s) of cytochrome P-450 that metabolizes propranolol would account for the marked inhibition of propranolol metabolism observed following propranolol pretreatment.", 
    "35": "1 Thirteen hypertensive patients completed a double-blind comparison of placebo, acebutolol 200 mg twice daily and acebutolol 400 mg once daily, administered for 4 weeks in random order. 2 Blood pressure and heart rate were significantly reduced by both acebutolol treatments. The mean reduction of resting pressure 12 h after 200 mg twice daily (12/7 mmHg) was similar to that 24 hr after 400 mg once daily (13/9 mmHg). 3 Compared to placebo, reductions in exercise heart rate and systolic pressure at 12 h after 200 mg twice daily and 24 h after 400 mg once daily were significant and similar. 4 Beta-adrenoceptor antagonism was also assessed by inhibition of the heart rate response to sublingual glyceryl trinitrate taken in the standing position. Both acebutolol treatments reduced the response; the reduction after twice daily treatment (mean 25 beats/min) was significantly greater than after once daily treatment (mean 19 beats/min). 5 There was no difference in blood pressure control between acebutolol administered once and twice daily in a total daily dose of 400 mg.", 
    "36": "Four patients with severe classic angina pectoris and no evidence of myocardial infarction are described. All had ECG changes compatible with myocardial ischemia. Coronary arteriography showed normal coronary arteries (except for minor narrowing in one patient) and marked hypertrophy of the left ventricle without left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The diagnosis of hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy was confirmed by the presence of small left ventricular diastolic and systolic volumes with a supernormal ejection fraction indicative of a hypercontractile state of the left ventricle. Treatment with beta-blocking agents reduced myocardial work, improved diastolic compliance and decreased patients' anginal symptoms. Hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy is an important cause of typical angina pectoris in patients who have normal coronary arteries on coronary angiography.", 
    "37": "Studies were performed with healthy volunteers to determine the effects of various stresses known to increase sympathetic nerve activity on the plasma concentration of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. Plasma cyclic AMP rose promptly in response to exercise; the elevation was completely abolished by a simultaneous injection of propranolol. Plasma cyclic GMP rose slightly after exercise; the elevation was completely abolished by a simultaneous injection of atropine. No significant changes occurred during tilting and cold pressor stress. The increase in plasma concentrations of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP may serve as putative indices for beta-adrenergic, and cholinergic functions respectively during exercise of humans.", 
    "38": "Exercise-induced heart glycogen and triglyceride mobilization was studied in control rats, in rats with reduced blood glycose supply (fasted rats), in rats with reduced plasma free fatty acids (FFA) supply (nicotinic acid-treated rats), and in rats with blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors (propranolol-treated rats). It was found in the fed control rats that both the heart glycogen and triglyceride levels were reduced at the beginning of the exercise and thereafter they returned to the control level despite the exercise being continued. The triglyceride level was reduced again during the exhaustive exercise. Reduced blood glucose supply increased the heart glycogen and triglyceride utilization during exercise. Partial prevention of the plasma FFA elevation during exercise increased the heart glycogen utilization and had no effect on utilization of the heart triglycerides. Blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptors fully prevented both the heart glycogen and triglyceride mobilization during exercise.", 
    "39": "Contraction, relaxation, and longitudinal tension were recorded by isometric strain gauge arches attached to cervical tracheal muscle (CTM) in 60 spontaneously breathing dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. Intravenous norepinephrine (NE) (3 X 10(-9), 6 X 10(-9), 1.2 X 10(-8), and 2.4 x 10(-8) mol/kg) increased spontaneous mechanical activities (SMA) and caused dose related contraction of CTM in all dogs even though there was no pretreatment with beta-blockers. These activities were first potentiated by propranolol and then prevented by phentolamine. NE briefly decreased SMA and induced CTM relaxation prior to the onset of contraction in one-third of dogs. Propranolol prevented this initial relaxation. CTM responses induced by NE were 1) not significantly altered by atropine, tripelennamine, bilateral vagotomy, curarization, and complete tracheal transection below transducer sites; 2) unrelated to passive constriction of cervical trachea associated with airway elongation; and 3) independent of reflexes initiated by elevations of systemic arterial pressure. The moles per kilogram doses of acetylcholine were found to exceed those of NE when their intravenous administration caused equal CTM contractions in the same dog. These findings are consistent with the existence of alpha-adrenergic receptors in CTM.", 
    "40": "Changes of general peripheral resistance in response to autoperfusion both prior to and after blockade of alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors depended on its initial level: at a relatively low initial value autoperfusion increased the vascular resistance whereas at high value decreased it. During maximal shifts of hemodynamic parameters the venous return prevailed over the cardiac output. The pressor effect was practically unrelated to the way of blood administration.", 
    "41": "Identification and characterization of beta-adrenergic receptors were attempted in particulate membrane fractions derived from isolated ciliary processes (CP) of rabbit eyes. High-affinity binding sites for 125I-hydroxybenzylpindolol (125I-HYP), a beta-adrenergic antagonist, were identified in particulate membrane fractions of homogenized CP that were recovered from discontinuous sucrose density gradients. Adenylate cyclase activity was recovered in the same fraction as the 125I-HYP binding sites. The dissociation constant of 125I-HYP for the high affinity site is 0.25 nM, with a minimum capacity of about 35 fmol/mg of protein. Adrenergic agonists and antagonists, including timolol, 1-alprenolol, d,1-propranolol, 1-isoproterenol, 1-epinephrine, and phentolamine, were examined for their ability to displace 125I-HYP from its binding site. The results were consistent with the identification of the high-affinity 125I-HYP binding sites as beta-adrenergic receptors. This is the first report which identifies by ligand binding techniques beta-adrenergic receptors in CP exclusive of iridial or other uveal tissue and supports the possibility of direct action of beta-adrenergic agents on the formation of aqueous humor.", 
    "42": "22 patients with salvoes of ventricular tachycardia were investigated electrophysiologically and pharmacologically to determine the mechanism of the arrhythmia. The appearance of the ventricular complexes was suggestive of a septal origin. The arrhythmia appeared to occur and regress within precise limits of sinus rhythm. 24 hour ECG recording and endocavitary stimulation techniques showed its essentially variable character, but occasionally a fixed coupling interval with the first extrasystole was observed, suggesting the presence of an unprotected parasystolic focus. The repetition of the extrasystolic activity, which could be triggered and terminated at will, is explained by phenomena of delayed after potentials. The results of the systematic investigation of the effects of quinidine-like drugs, beta-blockers and verapamil do not invalidate these hypotheses and show a difference of degree but not of nature between the two populations A and B of patients classified according to the quantitative character of the extrasystolic activity over 24 hours (more or less than 1000/hour). The observation of intermediate forms with simple extrasystoles and other forms with sustained tachycardia extends the significance of these results to many forms of ventricular arrhythmia.", 
    "43": "The aminoglycoside antibiotics possess neuromuscular blocking activity; the potency of those antibiotics tested appears to be as follows: gentamicin greater than streptomycin greater than amikacin greater than sisomicin greater than kanamycin = tobramycin greater than kanendomycin = dibekacin. The neuromuscular blockade produced by these antibiotics is not reversed by neostigmine, whereas it is reversed by calcium. Calcium not only has the ability to restore the neuromuscular transmission but also to exert protective action against the neuromuscular blocking activity of aminoglycoside antibiotics; these antibiotics are also potentially capable of interacting with non-depolarizing muscle relaxant drugs (d-tubocurarine, pancuronium) or propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent. This interaction results in respiratory depression and/or prolonged apnoea. Our findings lead to the assumption that amino-glycoside antibiotics are involved in the process of acetylcholine release by nerve impulses, antagonizing calcium ions.", 
    "44": "Preparations of two new beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, Zami 1305 [1-(2-nitro-3-methyl-phenoxy)-3-tert-butylaminopropan-2-ol] and Zami 1327 [1-(6-nitro-3-methyl-phenoxy)-3-tert-butylaminopropan-2-ol], were found to be contaminated by expoxides which are direct acting mutagens on TA 100 and TA 1535 in the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. Because of the suggested correlation between mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of a chemical [10,11], beta-adrenergic blocking agents contaminated by mutagenic expoxide impurities may be a health hazard.", 
    "45": "Echocardiographic and flow-directed catheter studies were performed on nine normal male volunteers to investigate the hemodynamic effects of beta-adrenergic blockade at rest and during exercise. The beta-receptor blockade induced inhibition of sympathetic drive led to a reduced myocardial contractility with raised pulmonary capillary pressure and a reduced shortening fraction during exercise. Stroke volume and cardiac output were reduced by 20--30%. There was a correlation between the measurements of stroke volume by echocardiography and by catheter (r = 0.76, p < 0.001), a stronger relationship was demonstrated in the measurement of cardiac output (r = 0.93, p < 0.001). In spite of raised pressures and reduced myocardial contractility there was no increase in enddiastolic left ventricular diameter. In addition to the Frank-Starling mechanism further pharmacological effects must be assumed to explain the observed effects of beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "46": "The effect of adrenergic blocking agents on gastrin and secretin secretion before and after a bolus arginine injection (arginine pulse) was investigated in normal subjects. Repeated arginine pulses given at 30-minute intervals caused abrupt and almost identical rises of plasma gastrin with each pulse. On the other hand, plasma secretin levels were unchanged by repeated injections of arginine. The increase in plasma gastrin induced by arginine pulse was significantly suppressed by the infusion of beta-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, while the infusion of alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, phentolamine tended to enhance the arginine-induced gastrin secretion slightly but not significantly. Whereas, the infusion of neither phentolamine nor propranolol had significant influence on secretin secretion. These results suggest that alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors play an important role in the regulation of arginine-induced gastrin secretion.", 
    "47": "Six spinal cord injured patients were evaluated with cystometry, bladder electromyography, and external urethal spincter pressure profiles before and after propranolol hydrochloride administration. Bladder contractility was significantly augmented, and therefore was associated with decreased beta-sympathetic bladder stimulation. The results of these clinical neurophysiological investigations suggest inhibitory influences upon the smooth muscle of the human urinary bladder via beta-sympathetic receptors.", 
    "48": "Salbutamol and related beta-2 sympathomimetic drugs have been used in Australia recently for the inhibition of premature labour and also to prevent uterine activity in acute foetal emergencies during labour. General anaesthesia in these situations presents the anaesthetist with a number of pharmacological difficulties, which can have profound effects on both mother and neonate. The use of beta-blockers to correct the cardiovascular and metabolic instability is discussed and recommendations are made for their use in association with anaesthesia for operative delivery. Ante-natal beta-blockade of mother may increase the morbidity and possibly the mortality of an already at risk pre-term neonate. The case report illustrates some of the hazards associated with salbutamol, obstetrics and anaesthesia.", 
    "49": "Timolol maleate is a new, potent ocular antihypertensive that has an effect additive with other antiglaucoma medications. It does not cause miosis and is relatively free of ocular complications, although a few have been documented. Timolol does exacerbate asthma and should not be used in patients with a history of this disease. It should be used with caution in cases of significant cardiovascular disease and may produce occasional psychic disturbances. In general, timolol is a potent, effective, and relatively safe drug with few ocular side effects but should be used with appropriate care.", 
    "50": "The insulin release and the glucose disappearance rate (K-value) during an iv glucose tolerance test were evaluated in 20 hyperthyroid patients before and during treatment with either a non-selective (propranolol, n = 10) or a selective (metoprolol, n = 10) beta-1-adrenoceptor blocking agent. Mean daily doses were 240 mg of propranolol and 280 mg of metoprolol, administered four times daily for 10 to 14 days. The insulin increase after glucose injection remained unchanged during treatment with each drug. Fasting blood glucose concentrations and the K-values were not altered during treatment. Sixteen patients were re-investigated 10 to 36 weeks later when euthyroid due to treatment by surgery, thyrostatic drugs or radioiodine. In the euthyroid state mean serum insulin concentrations after the glucose load were not significantly different from the values found when the patients were hyperthyroid. However, mean fasting blood glucose concentrations decreased from 5.5 mmol/l to 5.0 (P less than 0.01) and the mean K-value increased from 1.5 to 2.0 (P less than 0.05) when the patients were euthyroid. It is concluded that short-term treatment of hyperthyroid patients with non-selective or selective beta-1-adrenoceptor blocking agents does not impair the glucose stimulated insulin secretion or the carbohydrate tolerance.", 
    "51": "The metabolic and haemodynamic effects of three intravenous doses (0.5, 1.0 and 4.0 mg) of prenalterol, a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, were studied in 10 healthy male subjects. Plasma levels of prenalterol during the experiments were related to the haemodynamic effects. Prenalterol induced a dose-dependent increase in systolic blood pressure and heart rate. The maximal effects amounted to about 30 mm Hg and 15 beats/min, respectively, after the highest dose (4.0 mg). The diastolic blood pressure fell by a maximum of about 15 mm Hg. The effect of prenalterol on systolic blood pressure and heart rate persisted for about 3 h after the end of the last infusion, whereas that on diastolic blood pressure only lasted for 60 min. Compared with placebo, there was a moderate increase in plasma FFA and glycerol. A small rise in insulin level was also recorded, but no significant change was seen in other metabolic variables--triglycerides, glucose, lactate pyruvate. Serum potassium tended to decrease and serum sodium was unchanged. The initial distribution of prenalterol was rapid (half-life 7 min) and the overall elimination rate corresponded to a plasma half-life of 2 h. A linear relationship was found between the plasma level of prenalterol and its effects on systolic blood pressure and heart rate.", 
    "52": "The haemodynamic effects of prenalterol, a new selective beta-1 adrenoreceptor agonist, have been studied in patients with coronary heart disease. The drug was administered intravenously in a dosage of 0.5 to 2.5 micrograms/kg body weight to 20 patients undergoing coronary angiography and to 10 patients with a recent myocardial infarction, who had clinical evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular performance was enhanced in both groups of patients--left ventricular dP/dt (max) increased by 33 per cent and the systolic time intervals, pre-ejection period, and the ratio of pre-ejection period and left ventricular ejection shortened by 28 and 21 per cent, respectively. Cardiac output and stroke volume increased with no change in heart rate nor in left ventricular filling pressure. These results indicate that prenalterol enhances the contractile state of the myocardium without altering heart rate, and suggest that prenalterol could be of value in the management of patients with coronary heart disease, who have impaired left ventricular function.", 
    "53": "The beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties of IPS 339 and propranolol were studied on isolated preparations of trachea and of the slow-contracting soleus muscle from the guinea-pig. Both compounds antagonized the relaxation of the trachea and the depression of subtetanic contractions of the soleus produced by the beta2-selective agonist, terbutaline. On the soleus muscle the pA2-values for IPS 339 and propranolol were similar and close to those obtained for propranolol on the trachea. However, on the trachea the slope of the Schildplot for IPS 339 against terbutaline became less than one and a reliable pA2-value could not be calculated.", 
    "54": "The synthesis of a series of derivatives of 1-phenyl-2-[[(substituted amido)alkyl]amino]ethanols is described. The compounds were investigated for beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties, and many showed a surprising degree of potency and beta 1-cardioselectivity when tested in vivo in anesthetized cats. The structure-activity relationships shown by this series of compounds are discussed and related to known beta-adrenergic blocking agents.", 
    "55": "The bronchoconstrictor and beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity of (+/-)-propranolol, acebutolol and two of its analogues were compared in a group of littermate rats. Whilst the analogues of acebutolol had similar bronchoconstrictor potency to propranolol, acebutolol had considerably less activity. No correlation could be found between the degree of bronchoconstriction produced by the four drugs and their beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity in the airway smooth muscle. Acebutolol and its analogues show a wide properties could be related to the production of bronchospasm.", 
    "56": "The effects of five beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents and placebo during twice daily sustained therapy were compared in 23 patients with stable, exertional angina pectoris. The study was double blind in design, and each drug was prescribed for a period of one month in a random fashion. The number of anginal attacks and consumption of glyceryl trinitrate tablets during the one month period were significantly reduced by a similar degree during therapy with all five beta blocking drugs in comparison to the placebo (P less than 0.01). Exercise tolerance, when assessed 12 hours after a previous dose had been given and 1 hour after the morning dose was given, also improved by a similar degree with all five drugs in comparison to the placebo (P less than 0.01). The increase in exercise duration was associated with a significant reduction in the S-T segment depression, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure, with each of the five drugs--effects markedly different from those obtained with the placebo (P less than 0.01). These data show that noncardioselective (propranolol and oxprenolol) and cardioselective (practolol, metoprolol and tolamolol) agents, as well as drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (oxprenolol and practolol), were equally effective antianginal agents during sustained therapy. Furthermore, twice daily therapy with any of these drugs was effective in the management of patients with angina pectoris.", 
    "57": "Hemodynamic consequences of sustained (one hour) hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia (plasma ionized calcium concentration [Ca++] maintained approximately 60% below or above normal, encompassing the clinical range) were studied and the influence of beta blockade on these hemodynamic alterations examined in 16 anesthetized, closed-chest dogs. Alterations in [Ca++] were associated with directionally similar changes in mean arterial pressure, whereas on the average cardiac output remained unchanged. Thus, the peripheral vasculature played an important role in the hemodynamic response to alterations in [Ca++]. The state of beta adrenergic activity was an important determinant of the hemodynamic response to hypocalcemia. Prior to beta blockade, hypocalcemia was associated with decreased systemic vascular resistance, whereas after beta blockade with propranolol hydrochloride, systemic vascular resistance was not different from control except at the five-minute observation period, and cardiac output and stroke volume fell."
