    "0": "The effects of biogenic amines on the formation of adenosine-3',5' monophosphate (cAMP) in the anterior pituitary of rats were investigated. Pituitary halves were preincubated in a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) containing theophylline (10(-2)M) at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes and incubated in a fresh buffer for 15 minutes after the addition of test substances. Noradrenaline at 4 X 10(-4)M and serotonin at 3.3 X 10(-4)M were effective in elevating cAMP, but dopamine at 2 X 20(-4)M was ineffective. The beta adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, effectively antagonized the cAMP response to noradrenaline, but the alpha adrenergic blocking agent, phentolamine, did not. The serotonin antagonist, methysergide, remarkably antagonized the cAMP response to serotonin, but the alpha and beta adrenergic agents did not.", 
    "1": "Systolic time intervals, including preejection period (PEP) and left ventricular ejection time (LVET), were studied in patients with permanent essential hypertension before and after intra-venous administration of propranolol 0.2 mg/kg (11 patients), clonidine 0.002 mg/kg (10 patients) and methyldopa 2 mg/kg (12 patients). With propranolol, diastolic blood pressure was unchanged and the heart rate decreased, whilst PEP and LVET were significantly prolonged (P less than 0.001). Clonidine caused a fall in blood pressure (P less than 0.001), heart rate was slightly reduced, PEP was prolonged (P less than 0.001) and there was a significant decrease in LVET at 5 min. With methyldopa, no significant effect was observed after intravenous injection, but 7 days oral administration produced the identical effect as clonidine. These observations suggest that certain antihypertensive drugs may impair left ventricular performance and depress myocardial contractility.", 
    "2": "1. The output of amylase from superfused mouse parotid segments in response to stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh), phenylephrine and isoprenaline during exposure to solutions with varying potassium concentrations was monitored by an on line automated fluorometric method. 2. During stimulation with ACh or phenylephrine a 10-fold increase in superfusion fluid potassium concentration caused an immediate very marked reduction in amylase output which was fully reversible. A 10-fold reduction in potassium concentration resulted in a prominent rise in amylase output. During stimulation with isoprenaline there was no effect on the amylase output of varying the extracellular potassium concentration. Acetylcholine and phenylephrine caused potassium release from the mouse parotid whereas isoprenaline had no such effect. 3. It appears that under conditions where stimulation-induced potassium release is enhanced there is also an enhanced amylase secretion and vice cersa. There may therefore be a link between passive potassium transport and amylase secretion.", 
    "3": "After a two week washout period 25 patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension were treated with pindolol. In 12 patients the reduction in blood pressure was excellent and treatment with pindolol was continued. In 13 patients treatment was supplemented subsequently with clopamide and 12 patients had a satisfactory result. Side-effects were few and mild.", 
    "4": "Classic features of thyrotoxicosis developed in three patients with no prior history of thyroid disease shortly after the discontinuation of therapy with or decrease in doseage of propranolol hydrochloride. Graves' disease probably developed fortuitously after propranolol therapy was instituted, but the beta-adrenergic blockade masked the clinical features of hyperthyroidism. On discontinuation of propranolol therapy or decrease in propranolol dosage, previously latent thyrotoxicosis became manifest. If hyperthyroidism masked by beta-blockade is not recognized before withdrawal of propranolol therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease, the sudden appearance of thyrotoxicosis may lead to symptoms of increased myocardial ischemia.", 
    "5": "Skin manifestations, eye complications, a nephrotic syndrome, appearance of lupus erythematosus cells and antinuclear antibodies, sometimes combined with a systemic side effects of the beta adrenergic blocker Practolol. Another side effect is though to be sclerosing peritonitis. The latter is identical with the idiopathic fibroplastic peritonitis, described at the turn of this fibroplastic peritonitis, described at the turn of this century by German authors. Our own observation of a case of sclerosing peritonitis is compared with the literature. There is strong evidence for a causal relationship between longstanding Practolol-therapy and sclerosing peritonitis. Practolol was withdrawn from the market in 1975.", 
    "6": "The response to dynamic exercise was investigated in 21 patients receiving long-term treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and 22 controls. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure were recorded before and after treadmill exercise, and plasma dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) activity was measured as an index of changes in sympathetic activity. Heart rate and blood pressure were lower at rest and throughout exercise in treated patients, although the pressor effect of exercise was not reduced. The ECG P-R interval was lengthened, and in addition the Q-T interval was prolonged. After exercise, plasma DBH activity was significantly increased in controls but not in treated patients. We conclude that long-term administration of beta-adrenergic blockers increases myocardial repolarisation time and reduces sympathetic nervous activity. These actions may contribute to the antiarrhythmic and hypotensive effects of long-term beta-blockade.", 
    "7": "ORF 12592, the 5-hydroxy analog of propranolol, produced reductions in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac contractility and hind limb perfusion pressure in the anesthetized normotensive dog. Blood pressure and heart rate were also lowered in the carotid-sinus denervated dog. ORF 12592 blocked heart rate and blood pressure responses induced by isoproterenol. Similar results were observed with propranolol administration except for a transient decrease in blood pressure in the mormotensive dog. These results indicate that ORF 12592 possesses antihypertensive and beta-blocking properties in the anesthetized dog.", 
    "8": "Effect of ketamine on the SA node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the SA node artery. Injections of ketamine in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a depression of the SA nodal activity by a direct action. This depression was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase. Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the ketamine-induced tachycardia, while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta-blocking agent into the SA node artery. This may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of ketamine injected in the SA node artery.", 
    "9": "Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) administered close-arterially, has been found to enter rabbit submandibular saliva elicited by parasympathetic nerve stimulation. Adrenalin, superimposed on parasympathetic nerve stimulation, increased the passage of HRP into the saliva. Use of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists, either separately or together, and use of alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists together with adrenalin indicate that both alpha- and beta-receptor stimulation is necessary for this increase in glandular permeability to occur. Histochemical assessment showed that HRP had permeated the interstitial spaces of the gland and entered the spaces between adjacent parenchymal cells. However, in unstimulated glands it had only reached the lumina of striated ducts, but after adrenalin administration, peroxidase was also observed within acinar lumina. This work indicates that the predominant pathway taken by the HRP was via intercellular spaces and it is suggested that the permeability between junctional complexes of parenchymal cells is capable of being modified in vivo.", 
    "10": "During a five days administration, Propranolol (80 mg daily) or Acebutolol (600 mg daily) decreased significantly plasma renin activity in 14 mild essential hypertensive patients under a normal (8 patients) or low sodium (6 patients) diet. Plasma aldosterone and aldosterone secretion rate were significantly lowered by treatment under the low sodium diet, but unchanged during the normal sodium diet. In the latter, the dissociation observed between renin and aldosterone did not involve a change in aldosterone metabolic clearance rate or in plasma potassium. The decrease in plasma aldosterone was significantly correlated to the initial renin activity. These results demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of two different betablocking agents on renin release is not related to their cardio-selectivity and is independent of sodium balance. The influence of the renin decrease on aldosterone is dependent on sodium balance and on the initial state of the renin angiotensin system.", 
    "11": "When reproducing ischemia of the myocardium in acute experiments on rabbits and in tests with the isolated rabbit's heart an elevated permeability of the myocardial histo-blood barriers (HBB) to sodium sulphacyl in the region of ischemia and its boundary zone was established. Upon introduction of isadrine (2 mg/kg and 2-10-6 M) and anapriline (1 and 2.5 mg/kg; 2-10-6 and 10-5M) the permeability of the HBB to sodium sulphacyl within the ischemia zone and in areas of the myocardium contiguous to it diminished. The permeability of the myocardial HBB in the intact zone did not change under the effect of the drugs. In in vitro experiments with erythrocytes by using the fluorescent test and methods for determination of the osmotic resistance the drugs were found to display the membranotropic activity. From the in vitro tests it follows that anapriline and isadrine exercise no antiprotease action.", 
    "12": "Changes of heart frequency have been studied in diabetic neuropathy by blocking autonomic innervation of the heart with atropine and propranolol (intrinsic rate). It was found that in diabetic neuropathy the initial heart rate was higher than in the controls and in non-neutropathic diabetics, but this higher frequency could not be increased any further by the administration of atropine and propranolol compared to the values registered in the other two groups.", 
    "13": "Intravenous infusion of adrenaline (40 microgram Kg-1 h-1 for 5 hrs) causes hypomagnesemia in ewes. Hypomagnesemia is increased by phentolamine and inhibited by propranolol. Thyroidectomy, with thyroxine supplementation, does not inhibit the hypomagnesemia caused by adrenaline and phentolamine. Sodium nicotinate (15 mg Kg-1 h-1 for 5 hrs) inhibits the increase in non-esterified fatty acids and hypomagnesemia resulting from infusion of adrenaline and phentolamine. Sodium nicotinate inhibits the increase in non-esterified fatty acids and hypomagnesemia resulting from theophylline infusion (20 mg Kg-1 h-1 for 90 min). It is concluded that an increase in the level of intra-cellular cyclic AMP due to beta adrenergic stimulation by adrenaline or to inhibition of phosphodiesterases by theophylline, results in hypomagnesemia which seems to be correlated with stimulation of lipolysis.", 
    "14": "In anaesthetised, open-chest dogs, global isovolumic contractility indices were reduced by acute regional ischaemia involving 12 to 14% or more of left ventricular mass. These effects were not altered by controlled reduction of blood flow to the non-ischaemic region, but were exaggerated by isoprenaline during normal perfusion of the non-ischaemic region. The results were consistent with a contraction model characterised by simple reduction of the effective length of the contractile elements.", 
    "15": "1 The effects of atenolol on regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) and on ST segment elevation were studied both in normal and ischaemic regions of the myocardium in dogs. Some of the experiments were performed with cardiac pacing or after bilateral stellectomy. 2 In the absence of cardiac pacing, atenolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) induced a marked reduction in heart rate and contractile force and a decrease in RMBF, which was of the same magnitude in normal and ischaemic areas. There was no modification in the endo/epi flow ratio. ST segment elevation in ischaemic areas was significantly reduced. 3 Bilateral stellectomy induced similar effects to those of atenolol. Atenolol after bilateral stellectomy exhibited no additional effects. 4 In dogs submitted to cardiac pacing, atenolol no longer decreased RMBF and ST segment elevation. 5 These results demonstrate that with atenolol, there is no correlation between bradycardia and the endo/epi flow ratio while there is one between bradycardia and reduction in ST segment elevation.", 
    "16": "delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC) 1 mg/kg, i.v. produced a slight but significant reduction in the heart rate of conscious mongrel dogs, and these effects were greatly potentiated by pentobarbital and/or urethane anesthesia. However, significant increase in the heart rate was noted following delta9-THC administration in the dogs anesthetized with a combination of morphine plus chloralose; further, neither morphine nor chloralose alone could reverse the bradycardic effects of delt9-THC. Tachycardia induced by delta9-THC in these dogs could be reversed by bilateral vagotomy or by pretreatment of the animals with methylatropine, or propranolol and/or practolol. The data indicated a complex interaction between delta9-THC and morphine-chloralose combination and the tachycardia induced by delta9-THC under this anesthesia may be due to release of epinephrine by a reflexogenic mechanism involving afferent vagi. Further, while the bradycardic effects of delta9-THC were essentially identical under pentobarbital or urethane anesthesia, the hypotensive effects were similar in urethane or chloralose anesthetized dogs. The study emphasizes that anesthetic interaction should be taken into consideration while investigating mechanisms of actions of pharmacological agents.", 
    "17": "Examination of the appearance of adrenaline responsiveness and propranolol sensitivity with culture age in myoblasts cultured from neonatal rat hearts shows that propranolol sensitivity lags behind adrenergic responsiveness. Such a finding may illustrate subtle differences in sites for agonist and antagonist at the beta-receptor of these cells.", 
    "18": "A case of atrioventricular reciprocal rhythm and chronic reciprocating tachycardia in a newborn infant is presented. Electrophysiological studies suggest that these rhythm disturbances are related to the presence of a right-sided atrioventricular accessory pathway capable only of retrograde conduction (concealed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). The technique of recording the sequence of atrial activation during the tachycardia is described and its clinical importance emphasised.", 
    "19": "Electrophysiologic modifications produced by intravenous administration of 0.1 mg/Kg Oxprenolol were studied in 16 subjects with estimated normal impulse formation and conduction. Significant effects were sinus bradycardia, mild increase of sino-atrial conduction time, depression of intranodal conduction and prolongation of A-V node refractory periods. Sinus node recovery time and atrial refractory periods were unchanged. Infranodal conduction and the refractory periods of the His-Purkinje system, as well as of the bundle branches, were unchanged. These effects are compared with those observed after intravenous Propranolol and Prindolol.", 
    "20": "Serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels were measured in twelve hyperthyroid patients before and after treatment with propranolol, 40 mg four times daily, for 2 weeks. There was a significant fall in serum T3 and a significant rise in serum T4 concentrations in the group as a whole and it was concluded that the clinical effectiveness of propranolol in hyperthyroidism may be mediated in part by its action on the peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones. Propranolol treatment should be withdrawn gradually as removal of the suppressive action of the drug on thyroid hormone metabolism is potentially hazardous, particularly in patients with ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "21": "Addition of norepinephrine or epinephrine to the isolated rat kidney perfused at constant pressure resulted in an increase in sodium reabsorption and the excretion of a dilute urine with an increase in free water clearance. Vasopressin reversed the fall in urinary osmolarity but not the diminution in sodium excretion. The urinary changes produced by catecholamines were blocked by propranolol but not by phenoxybenzamine, suggesting that they were mediated, at least in part, by beta receptors. Similar though less pronounced changes in sodium excretion and urinary osmolarity were produced by isoproterenol and phenylephrine, while the combination of these drugs induced marked dilution of the urine. The results suggest that circulating catecholamines or adrenergic nerves innervating the kidney directly influence renal tubular function and might, therefore, participate in the regulation of sodium and water excretion by the kidneys.", 
    "22": "The effects of stimulating the parasympathetic innervation to rat submaxillary gland on ductal transport of Na, K, water, and transepithelial PD, were tested in the main excretory duct during perfusion through its lumen. During nerve stimulation, transepithelial PD was consistently decreased, usually by about 15 mV, and this decrease could be blocked by atropine but not by adrenergic blocking agents. Net flux of Na, K, or water was not significantly changed during stimulation. One-way flux of Na from the lumen also was unaffected. The decrease in PD during stimulation was not affected by substituting isethionate for Cl or increasing [K] in the luminal perfusion medium. It is concluded that parasympathetic effects are exerted on the ductal cells, but that these probably do not involve conductance changes at the luminal membrane.", 
    "23": "The duodenums of opossums and cats were cut into strips 2 mm wide and 2-2.5 cm long. Strips cut in the direction of the oral-caudal axis were called longitudinal strips, and those cut at 90 degrees to that axis were called circular strips. Each muscle strip was stimulated with trains of electrical rectangular pulses (10 Hz, 50-70 V, 0.5 ms). In the longitudinal strips, electrical field stimulation caused contraction, and this contraction was abolished by atropine, 10(-7) M. In the circular strips, electrical field stimulation caused relaxation. This relaxation was abolished by tetrodotoxin, 10(-7) M, but it was not affected by antagonists to adrenergic and cholinergic transmission, nor by some gastrointestinal hormones. Reserpinization of the opossums or alteration of the frequencies of electrical field stimulation from 0.1-50 Hz did not affect or alter the relaxation of the circular strips or the contraction of the longitudinal strips. These findings suggest that the longitudinal muscle is dominated by an excitatory cholinergic innervation, and the circular muscle is dominated by a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic inhibitory innervation.", 
    "24": "Acute renal failure caused in the rabbit by clamping one renal pedicle for 1 hour and removing the opposite kidney produced a histologic picture very similar to that observed in \"hypotensive\" acute renal failure in man. Intravenous infusion of propranolol, a drug which prevents renin release, at 1 mg/kg for 70 minutes beginning at time of pedicle clamping resulted in significantly lower serum creatinine in this model (2.8 +/- 0.2 mg% at 48 hours with propranolol versus 5.2 +/- 0.8 mg% without). Renin stimulation by dehydration or feeding a low-salt diet enhanced the difference between treated and untreated groups (2.6 +/- 0.4 mg% with propranolol versus 6.2 +/- 1.8 mg% without, after dehydration; 3.5 +/- 1.0 mg% with propranolol versus 7.6 +/- 1.4 mg% without, after low-salt diet).Suppression of renin production by saline feeding eliminated propranolol's beneficial effect (5.6 +/- 0.9 mg% with propranolol versus 4.0 +/- 0.6 mg% without). In rabbits with a normal food and water intake, renal denervation using phenol also eliminated propranolol's effect (creatinine 8.6 +/- 1.4 mg% with propranolol versus 8.6 +/- 1.8 mg% without). In rabbits with intact kidneys, flow probe recording of renal blood flow showed a significantly higher blood flow immediately after unclamping in the propranolol-treated animals, and renal angiograms showed less vasoconstriction in this group after unclamping. In this model of acute renal failure, renal vasoconstriction plays an important role following the initial ischemic insult. Propranolol lessens the severity of this vasoconstriction and the resulting acute renal failure. Its probable action is interference with neurogenically stimulated renin release.", 
    "25": "The hemodynamic, coronary sinus blood flow and myocardial metabolic effects of 0.15 mg/kg body weight of intravenously administered propranolol were studied in 19 patients with coronary artery disease and 6 normal patients. Atrial pacing was performed in all patients and produced angina in 15 of the 19 patients with coronary artery disease. In these patients propranolol reduced heart rate from 78 to 69 beats/min, cardiac index from 3.0 to 2.6 liters/min per m2 and left ventricular stroke work index from 47 to 43 g-m/m2; it increased total peripheral resistance from 24 to 28 units and lactate extraction from 16.3 to 22.5%. There was no significant change in mean arterial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, coronary sinus blood flow or myocardial oxygen consumption. During a second pacing stress propranolol produced clinical improvement in 9 of the 15 patients who experienced angina initially. The improvement was associated with less severe abnormalities in S-T depression and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, increased lactate extraction and no significant change in coronary sinus blood flow or myocardial oxygen consumption. Thus, propranolol appears to be capable of modifying the anginal threshold as determined with atrial pacing, and the clinical response appears to be independent of global changes in coronary sinus blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption.", 
    "26": "Pharmacologic agents that alter hemoglobin affinity for oxygen may affect systemic or myocardial oxygen delivery. In vitro, and in normal man propranolol shifts the oxyhemoglobin equilibrium curve to the right, thus increasing the partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated (P50) and enhancing oxygen delivery. The effect of propranolol on hemoglobin P50 was evaluated in 12 patients with angina pectoris and documented coronary artery disease. Determinations were made during oral propranolol therapy (mean daily dose 152 mg) of at least 3 months' duration and after administration of propranolol had been discontinued for at least 4 days. Hemoglobin P50 and erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) were measured. Data in 12 patients were: the mean P50 after discontinuation of propranolol was 28.2 mm Hg+/-0.9 (standard error of the mean) and during propranolol therapy 31.7+/-0.7; P less than 0.001; red blood cell 2,3-DPG did not change to explain the increase in P50. This demonstrated shift could increase systemic oxygen delivery and thus benefit marginally perfused myocardium while sparing coronary flow. Propranolol, in addition to its negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, may increase tissue oxygen delivery in patients with the anginal syndrome.", 
    "27": "To investigate the importance of plasma renin activity in determining the antihypertensive action of propranolol and of heart rate in guiding propranolol therapy, the effect of a graded oral dose of propranolol on blood pressure, plasma renin and heart rate was studied in 24 men with essential hypertension and differing initial levels of renin activity. Although plasma renin decreased substantially in patients with normal and high renin levels tasking a small dose of propranolol (40 mg/day), blood pressure was unchanged in the normal renin group, and a small decrease in systolic pressure alone was noted in those with high plasma levels of renin. Patients with low renin levels had no reduction in blood pressure with small doses of propranolol, but as a group they responded well to a dose of 320 mg/day. Standing heart rate decreased maximally at plasma propranolol concentrations greater than 25 ng/ml, and did not exceed 72 beats/min with plasma concentrations above that level. Overall, the observed responses for plasma renin and heart were more pronounced at lower plasma propranolol concentrations than those for blood pressure.", 
    "28": "Minoxidil is a potent orally administered vasodilator under investigation for use in severe hypertension. Fifteen patients with moderate to severe hypertension refractory to conventional antihypertensive drugs were treated with minoxidil on an outpatient basis. Propranolol and furosemide were administered concomitantly to control reflex tachycardia and fluid retention. Good blood pressure control was achieved in all but one patient with the average supine mean arterial blood pressure falling from 140 mm Hg with conventional drugs to 106 mm Hg with minoxidil (P less than 0.0005). The major side effects of fluid retention (9/15), hirsutism (15/15), and tachycardia were adequately controlled in all but one patient. We conclude that minoxidil will be a valuable drug in the outpatient management of refractory hypertension.", 
    "29": "The therapeutic efficacy of four antihypertensive regimens (minoxidil, propranolol, and hydrochlorothiazide; propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide; methyldopa and hydroch-orothiazide; and hydrochlorothiazide alone) was evaluated in one child with systolic hypertension and in eight children with systolic and diastolic hypertension. The mean blood pressure of 148/98+/-8/4 mm Hg observed during the hydrochlorothiazide control period fell to 142/88+/-8/4 mm Hg following methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide, 141/85+/-6/2 mm Hg following propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide, and 128/74+/-4/2 mm Hg following minoxidil, propranolol, and hydrochlorothiazide. The only side effect directly associated with administration of minoxidil was hypertrichosis. The effectiveness of minoxidil in the present study suggests that this drug offers an important adjunct to current antihypertensive therapy in children.", 
    "30": "1. Cardiac output increased in proportion to oxygen consumption in intact chloralose-anaesthetized dogs after four successive intravenous infusions of 2,4-dinitrophenol (11 mumol/kg; 2 mg/kg). 2. Splenectomy abolished the increase in cardiac output after the first three doses of 2,4-dinitrophenol. beta-Adrenoreceptor blockade by practolol, on the other hand, did not prevent the cardiac output rise after the first 2,4-dinitrophenol infusion, but further increases by 2,4-dinitrophenol infusion were abolished. When splenectomy and beta-adrenoreceptor blockade were combined, cardiac output did not increase significantly after all four doses of 2,4-dinitrophenol. 3. Cardiac output and mean systemic arterial blood pressure increased when the splenic venous blood collected after 2,4-dinitrophenol infusion was infused intraportally. 4. In a vascularly isolated, but normally innervated, lower half-body cross-perfusion preparation, cardiac output and mean systemic arterial blood pressure increased in the upper half-body when tissue hypermetabolism was produced in the cross-perfused area by 2,4-dinitrophenol. Neith pulmonary artery wedge pressure nor heart rate changed significantly. 5. This circulatory stimulation, after regional 2,4-dinitrophenol infusion, was abolished or was prevented from occurring by splenectomy. 6. It appears that the normal cardiac output response to tissue hypermetabolism requires both an intact spleen and normally functioning beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "31": "The possible influence of food intake on the bioavailability of one nonselective and one cardioselective beta adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol and metoprolol, was examined by serial determinations of the drug concentrations in blood of healthy subjects, taking single doses of the drugs both on an empty stomach and together with a standardized breakfast. The results indicate that food enhances the bioavailability of both propranolol and metoprolol. They also confirm that there is extensive interindividual variation in the bioavailability of these drugs.", 
    "32": "Synthetic vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) was infused at a dose of 50 ng/kg/min for 10 min into the cranial pancreaticoduodenal artery in anesthetized dogs. Both mean blood flow and plasma glucagon concentration in the cranial pancreaticoduodenal vein were significantly enhanced during the infusion, indicating a great augmentation in glucagon output. The pancreatic venous plasma concentration of insulin was not significantly raised, but its output increased during the infusion, again due to the increase in plasma flow. Plasma concentration of glucagon in the femoral artery was not significantly augmented, whereas that of insulin was enhanced during VIP infusion. Mean arterial plasma glucose levels rose gradually during the infusion. Intrapancreatic pretreatment with propranolol failed to exert any significant inhibiting effect upon the VIP-induced enhancement in plasma glucose, pancreatic venous blood flow, or bihormonal output. These results suggest that the vasoactive polypeptide of intestinal origin may regulate the function of the endocrine pancreas and that this effect may not be mediated mainly via the beta-adrenergic receptor system.", 
    "33": "The effect of cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-OP) on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) was studied in 50 cats in vivo. CCK-OP caused a dose-dependent fall in LES pressures in all but 4 animals. Maximal sphincter relaxation was obtained with 200 to 400 ng of CCK-OP per kg of body weight. Atropine sulfate and/or hexamethonium, or adrenergic blocking agents (phentolamine or propranolol), in doses that completely inhibit the action of maximal doses of their respective agonists, failed to block the CCK-OP effect. Tetrodotoxin, however, in doses that denervates the LES, antagonized the CCK-OP-induced sphincter relaxation. In these tetrodotoxin-treated animals, CCK-OP produced LES contraction similar to that observed after pentagastrin. These results suggest that CCK-OP stimulates the postganglionic nonadrenergic, noncholinergic inhibitory neurons responsible for sphincter relaxation. CCK-OP also stimulates the circular muscle by direct action causing LES contraction. The latter becomes apparent when the innervation of the LES is abolished by tetrodoxtin.", 
    "34": "Phenylephrine exerted a positive chronotropic and inotropic effect on isolated, spontaneously beating, atria of reserpinised rabbits. Addition of phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine resulted in a depression of control contractile amplitude. Practolol, however, was devoid of this effect. The positive inotropic response to phenylephrine was significantly antagonised by all the three blockers used, while positive chronotropic response was annulled by phentolamine and practolol, but not with phenoxybenzamine. It is, therefore, suggested that phenylephrine exerts its cardiostimulant effects through mediation of both alpha and beta-1 adrenoceptors. A probable mechanism of action could be, that phenylephrine acts on some specific chemical group, shared by alpha and beta1 receptors. This specific group is probably blocked by both alpha and betaceptor antagonists separately, so phenylephrine becomes ineffective in presence of these antagonists.", 
    "35": "Because of the paucity and inconsistency of information on blockage of the chicken autonomic nervous system for extended periods, the effects of atropine, phenoxybenzamine and propranolol in the anesthetized hen were examined. It was found that cholinergic blockade by atropine was very short lived. For effective (80%) parasympathetic blockage a priming dose of 0.25 mg./kg;, followed by an infusion at the rate of 17.5 microgram/kg./min., was required. Similarly, inhibition of the beta-sympathetic system required propranolol in a priming dose of 0.25 mg./kg. and an infusion of 5 microgram/kg./min. The alpha-sympathetic inhibitor, phenoxybenzamine, was effective when given as a single dose of 5 mg./kg. Using these levels of inhibitor it was possible to ensure blockade in all cases for periods of two hours or more.", 
    "36": "The in vivo hepatic microvascular bed of the rat was observed microscopically in the transilluminated liver and the diameter of the hepatic sinusoids was measured by serial photomicrography. Intraportal infusion of tyramine induced concentration-dependent constriction of the hepatic sinusoids, but also dilatation of the sinusoids when the dose was small. These effects were attributed to the release of endogenous noradrenaline which activated either alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors and caused constriction, or dilatation, of the sinusoids respectively. Adrenaline and noradrenaline induced similar changes in the hepatic sinusoids as tyramine, while phenoxybenzamine induced dilatation, and propranolol constriction, of the sinusoids. All the above responses were abolished by pretreatment with reserpine. A possible noradrenaline-mediated basal vasomotor tone in the hepatic sinusoids for autonomic control of the blood flow in the sinusoids was postulated.", 
    "37": "The effects of two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory compounds, fenclorac and indomethacin, on arachidonate and prostaglandins (PG) E1- and E2-induced vasodepressor responses were determined in the spontaneously hypertensive male rat. A 0.4 to 2 mg/kg intravenous dose of fenclorac blocked the arachidonate-induced vasodepressor response and had no effect on PGE1- and E2-induced hypotension. Similar responses were observed after indomethacin. These results were indicative of in vivo inhibition of PG synthetase by fenclorac and indomethacin. Administration of propranolol did not alter the arachidonate or PG responses; regitine reduced the arachidonate and PG response, suggesting that alpha-adrengergic receptors in vascular smooth muscle may play a role in the prostaglandin-induced hypotension.", 
    "38": "Multiunit canine tracheal smooth muscle responded to carbachol with graded depolarization and tonic contraction. The same concentration of carbachol, after metabolic depletion by substrate removal, produced rhythmic contractions and action potentials. Similar mechanical effects were also observed with acetylcholine or histamine. These effects were reversed by reintroducing glucose or beta-hydroxybutyrate, but not by 3-O-methylglucose, which is not metabolized; hence, the structural requirements for glucose, per se, or any osmotic effect were ruled out. Sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ was increased. A Ca2+-influx blocker, D-600, in low concentration (2 X 10(-8) M) abolished the rhythmic contractions without affecting the tonic contraction. Progressive metabolic depletion in presence of carbachol led to fluctuations in membrane potential with a crest of depolarization and appearance of action potentials, each of which resulted in a small contraction. Many of the small contractions partially fused to form the major rhythmic contractions which appeared at a frequency of one per minute. Rhythmicity could not be produced by increasing extracellular K+ concentration (20-120 mM) in presence of atropine (13(-7) M), but instead a tonic contraction occurred. These results suggest changes in excitation-contraction coupling mechanism with agonists like acetylcholine, carbachol, or histamine during substrate deprivation.", 
    "39": "Myocardial oxygen demand is the relationship between the inherent needs of the heart and the available oxygenated blood reaching the myocardial tissue. The system is controlled by two different, yet not wholly uncomplementary, mechanisms. The first, coronary blood flow, appears to be regulated primarily by tissue oxygen tension. The second, the determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption, is controlled more by the heart's mechanical performance than the tissue oxygen tension. Currently available antianginal drugs and physical training affect these two mechanisms and may alter angina pectoris.", 
    "40": "Effects of coronary artery ligation on myocardial glycogenolysis were studied in the endo- and epicardial layers of the left ventricular wall in dogs pretreated with 10 or 100 microgram/kg (i.v.) of carteolol, a potent beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Coronary artery ligation was performed by ligating one of the small branches of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In control (saline-pretreated) dogs, an increase in phosphorylase alpha activity and an increase in breakdown of glycogen were observed in both endo- and epicardial layers after coronary artery ligation. In the presence of 10 or 100 microgram/kg of carteolol, however, increases in phosphorylase alpha activity and increase in breakdown of glycogen were not observed in either the endo or epicardial layers. These results indicate that pretreatment of the dog with carteolol inhibits the increase in glycogenolysis caused by coronary artery ligation. Nevertheless, carteolol did not completely inhibit the coronary artery ligation-induced increase in glucose-6-phosphate and lactate levels, and the coronary artery ligation-induced decrease in phosphocreatine level, particularly in the endocardial layers.", 
    "41": "Low doses of d-amphetamine plus propranolol rapidly improved the abdominal pain in 165 \"spastic colon\" patients. Concomitantly, these drugs reduced the sigmoidal hypertonicity and the rectal inhibition found in the manometric studies performed in some of those patients. The sigmoidal tone and phasic activity were also decreased by anticholinergic drugs. These results suggest that a cholinergic-serotonergic hyperactivity of the myenteric plexus may be responsible for the \"spastic colon\" syndrome.", 
    "42": "The beta adrenergic blocking drug, timolol, tended to correct the hypokalemia of short-term bendrofluazide treatment in 6 healthy male subjects and although the effect was small it was significant. Timolol also reduced the rise in plasma aldosterone and urine potassium excretion following bendrofluazide and increased the urine sodium/potassium ratio. There was no evidence of a shift of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space.", 
    "43": "The effects of calcium ionophores X-537A, A23187, and PR-47 on the action potential of canine cardiac Purkinje fibers were studied using standard microelectrode techniques. The ionophores hyperpolarize the membrane potential, eliminate the notch on the action potential plateau, decrease action potential duration, decrease plateau amplitude and duration, decrease spontaneous diastolic depolarization and excitability, and decrease the rate effect on action potential duration. These effects were shown to be independent of catecholamines, membrane-bound calcium, and the patency of the slow inward current channel. The effects of the ionophores depended on the presence of calcium in the external solution. A plausible interpretation of the data is that an ionophore-mediated increase in intracellular calcium shifts the voltage dependence of transmembrane potassium currents to more negative levels.", 
    "44": "From a homogenate of rabbit colon muscle two ATP dependent Ca-accumulating microsomal fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation on a sucrose density grandient at 35% and 35-45% sucrose. Adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities were found in the fractions. The Ca-accumulation and the ATPase activity of these fractions were stimulated by cyclic AMP (10(-5)M) at an ATP concentration of 0.35 mM ATP. In the presence of higher concentrations of ATP (5 mM) cyclic AMP had no effect on the Ca-binding. The higher concentration of ATP markedly increased the cyclic AMP formation in relation to the activity found at the lower concentration of ATP. Isoprenaline (2 X 10(-6)M) stimulated the Ca-accumulation in the 35-45% fraction and increased the hydrolysis of ATP. These effects were absent in the fraction isolated at 35% sucrose. In the former fraction isoprenaline also stimulated the adenylate cyclase activity at 0.35 mM but not at 5 mM ATP. Both the effect of isoprenaline on the Ca-binding and the adenylate cyclase activity were inhibited by the adrenergic beta-receptor blocking agent sotalol. In the 35-45% fraction papaverine (1 X 10(-3)M) stimulated the Ca-accumulation and inhibited the phosphodiesterase activity. It is suggested that cyclic AMP and agents which influence the cyclic AMP metabolism in the microsomes may have a regulatory role on the Ca-binding of the microsomes.", 
    "45": "The effects of beta-adrenergic agonists such as isoproterenol, norepinephrine and epinephrine upon the adenylate cyclase activity of human fat cell ghosts were tested, each alone and in combination with the beta-blocking agent propranolol. Saturating concentrations of these agents showed a 2-6.5-fold increase of enzyme activity without addition of any artificial cofactors. Isoproterenol was more potent in stimulating the enzyme system than epinephrine and nor-epinephrine. Propranolol caused a dose-dependent rightward shift of the log-dose response curve of these beta-adrenergic agonists. The assay of human fat cell adenylate cyclase in vitro may provide a simple anc convenient assay system for the screening of beta-adrenergic drugs of potential therapeutic importance.", 
    "46": "The influence of anapriline (propranolol) on the cerebral circulation rate, tone of the cerebral and femural vessels, pO2 in the cerebral tissue, was studied. I. v. administration of anapriline decreased the arterial blood pressure. The changes of tone of the vessels are often of the two-phase character: a decrease followed by an increase. The lowering of the arterial pressure is the most probable cause of the lowering cerebral circulation rate. pO2 decreases accordingly to the blood flow. The effect of anapriline was greater in anesthetized animals.", 
    "47": "Adenosine depressed norepinephrine contractions of dogs' saphenous vein strips in both the presence and the absence of Ca2+ and after inhibition of calcium influx by verapamil. It antagonized noncompetitively contractions induced by Ca2+ in depolarized strips after alpha-adrenergic blockade. Contractions obtained with acetylcholine were also depressed by adenosine. This depression was not accompanied by an increase in cAMP or a decrease in the elevated cGMP level. Thus the depression of the smooth muscle cell reactivity still occurs in the absence of calcium influx and is not mediated by the cyclic 3',5'-nucleotide system. Adenosine diphosphate and triphosphate, but not adenosine (10(-6) to 10(-4) M), increased the basal tension of resting saphenous strips. This was prevented by removal of calcium from the bath. In contracted strips, lower concentrations of both nucleotides (10(-6) to 10(-5) M) caused relaxation whereas with high concentrations (10(-4) to 10(-3) M) further contraction occurred. Thus, unlike adenosine, the adenine nucleotides facilitate calcium influx.", 
    "48": "Adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase enzyme activities were demonstrated in rabbit ureter. NaF, 10 mM, caused a 60.9 per cent increase in adenylate cyclase activity. Isoproterenol, 5 X 10-7 to 10-5 M induced a statistically significant dose-dependent increase in adenylate cyclase activity which was suppressed by propranolol, 10-7 M. Theophylline, 5 X 10-5 to 10-2 M, significantly inhibited phosphodiesterase activity. Thus, isoproterenol and theophylline, two agents that can relax ureteral segments previously contracted by a depolarizing concentration of potassium, could presumably increase cyclic AMP levels, isoproterenol by increasing synthesis and theophylline by decreasing degradation.", 
    "49": "Isolated adipose tissue cells were prepared from subcutaneous samples obtained from nine morbidly obese subjects weighing from 187 to 306% of ideal body weight. The responsiveness of these adipocytes to a number of test substances was determined by measuring cellular cyclic AMP concentration at one-half hour and glycerol release at four hours. Theophylline (10(-3) M) and epinephrine (10(-5) M) stimulated lipolysis; theophylline stimulated an increase in cyclic AMP, while epinephrine failed to prompt a significant change in the nucleotide. Neither the alpha blocker, phentolamine (10(-5) M), nor the beta blocker, propranolol (3 X 10(-5) M), affected lipolysis or cyclic AMP; when these agents were incubated in combination with epinephrine, changes occurred indicative of the presence of both alpha and beta adrenergic receptor sites. Insulin significantly reduced both basal and stimulated lipolysis but failed to affect cyclic AMP. With minor exceptions, adipocytes from hyperobese subjects behaved similarly to cells from unselected donors; at the concentration used, there was no evidence of resistance to insulin.", 
    "50": "Thyrotropin (TSH), 1 MU/ml and N6, O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5-cyclic monophosphoric acid (dbcAMP) greatly enhanced the release of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) from mouse thyroids incubated in vitro. L-Epinephrine (E) and L-norepinephrine (NE) strongly inhibited the TSH and dbcAMP-stimulated release of thyroid hormones; L-isoproterenol (IPNE) exerted a relatively weak inhibition. The inhibition by catecholamines was prevented by the alpha-adrenergic blocker, phentolamine; L-propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, had no effect on the inhibition. The TSH-induced release of thyroid hormones was not affected by adrenergic blockers. Epinephrine did not affect the increase in thyroidal cAMP content induced by TSH. These results indicate that catecholamines act by way of an alpha-adrenergic receptor to suppress TSH-stimulated release of thyroid hormones at a point beyond cAMP formation.", 
    "51": "The effect of phenoxybenzamine (PBA), desmethylimipramine (DMI), clonidine (CLND), sotalol (STL), and isoproterenol (ISPR) on the release of endogenous norepinephrine (NE) from the heart on right cardioaccelerator nerve stimulation was studied in anesthetized dogs. Under control conditions, the catecholamine levels in coronary sinus blood increased linearly with increasing frequencies of stimulation up to 10 Hz and did not increase further at 30 Hz. The release of NE was markedly enhanced after PBA (1 mg/kg, iv) and DMI (1 mg/kg, iv). The enhanced release of NE after DMI, but not after PBA, was associated with a prolonged response in heart rate. In contrast, NE release was reduced after CLND (15 microgram/kg, iv) at stimulation frequencies of 1 and 2 Hz and this was associated with reduced responses in heart rate and left ventricular dtp/dt. STL (5 mg/kg, iv) reduced significantly the release of NE at stimulation frequencies of 1-5 Hz, whereas ISPR enhanced NE outflow at frequencies of 1-4 Hz. These results support the existence of both negative and positive feedback mechanisms on the release of norepinephrine by cardiac sympathetic fibers mediated through presynaptic alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors, respectively. The functional significance of these mechanisms is also suggested by the correlation found between changes in NE release and variations in cardiac responses under the various drug treatements.", 
    "52": "1 An investigation was made into the effects of drugs which alter insulin secretion on the concentrations of tryptophan and other aromatic amino acids in plasma and brain and on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in brain. Drugs used were streptozotocin, propranolol, tolbutamide and phentolamine. 2 Tolbutamide and phentolamine increased the plasma insulin concentrations by 100% and 300% respectively but with little effect on the brain/plasma ratios for the aromatic amino acids. Previously propranolol was found to decrease plasma insulin by 50% without altering the above ratios. The ratios were decreased by streptozotocin but only when plasma insulin fell by more than 50%. 3 Phentolamine and propranolol did not alter the brain/plasma ratios for the aromatic amino acids in streptozotocin-treated rats. 4 The results suggest that only large changes of insulin secretion e.g. those associated with food intake or aminophylline injection are likely to alter appreciably the brain/plasma ratios for the aromatic amino acids. 5 Tolbutamide displaced tryptophan from its binding to plasma albumin and increased brain 5-HIAA probably by inhibiting 5-HIAA efflux from brain. The other drugs did not alter brain 5-HT or 5-HIAA concentrations.", 
    "53": "Differences in the histamine liberation from isolated rat mast cells after beta-adrenergic blocking drugs were demonstrated. In equimolar concentrations histamine release was induced by K\u00f6 1124, K\u00f6 1500, K\u00f6 1560, K\u00f6 1561 and propranolol. Alprenolol, oxprenolol, propranolol, and trimepranol significantly decreased thehistamine release induced by compound 48-80. The release of granules from cells was inhibited quantitatively more than the release of histamine. This enabled us to surmise the selective effect of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs on cell membranes of mast cells. The possible mechanisms of release reaction are discussed.", 
    "54": "The anomalous cardiac stimulation by tolazoline (2-benzyl-2-imidazoline), and alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, appears to result from the release of histamine and catecholamines. These responses can be blocked by metiamide and propranolol, respectively. It is probably that tolazoline also releases acetylcholine from the guinea pig atria. The direct effect of tolazoline on chronotropic activity of atrial pairs after blockade appears to be depressant at high concentrations, and this decrease in rate, below control levels, is not blocked by atropine.", 
    "55": "The aim of the present work was to explain the mechanism of the stimulating effect of adrenaline (A) on acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis. This action is exerted most probably through the beta- adrenergic receptors, since propranolol and oxprenolol inhibit the stimulating effect of adrenaline on acetylcholine synthesis in the rat cerebral cortex in vitro. Dihydroergotamine does not show such effect. Practolol and phentolamine decrease the spontaneous synthesis of ACh in concentration several times lower than that inhibiting the ACh synthesis stimulated by adrenaline. It is suggested that adrenaline-induced stimulation of ACh synthesis in the rat cerebral cortex is not due to cyclic AMP, because noradrenaline (NA) does not increase ACh synthesis either in vivo or in vitro, although it activates the adenyl cyclase. NA on the other hand activates ACh synthesis in the calcium-free medium, which inhibits activating effect of NA on adenyl cyclase. Moreover it was found that cyclic AMP depresses ACh synthesis in the rat cerebral cortex in vitro."
