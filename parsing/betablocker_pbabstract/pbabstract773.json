    "0": "The effects of orthostatic tilting were studied in 12 mongrel dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Orthostasis produced significant decreases in cardiac output and left ventricular dimensions. Secondary decreases in coronary flow and myocardial oxygen consumption were also documented. These changes were attenuated when the animals were pretreated with propranolol. The upright posture may be of value in treatment of angina pectoris.", 
    "1": "The effects of intra-arterial injections and infusions of three adrenergic amines upon hepatic arterial blood flow were measured in anesthetized baboons before and after alpha and beta adrenergic blockade with intravenous phenoxybenzamine and propranolol. Injections of norepinephrine or epinephrine caused dose-dependent decreases in hepatic arterial blood flow. These responses were attenuated by alpha adrenergic blockade and were unchanged by beta adrenergic blockade. Injections of isoproterenol caused dose-dependent increases in hepatic arterial flow. These increases were relatively small and were reversed to constriction at low doses and attenuated at high doses of the agonist by beta adrenergic blockade. Intrahepatic arterial infusions of constrictors were unaccompanied by autoregulatory excape. The degree of constriction was attenuated by alpha adrenergic blockade but was not potentiated by beta adrenergic blockade. Intrahepatic arterial infusion of a relatively large dose of isoproterenol was required to evoke a relatively modest, but sustained, increase in hepatic arterial blood flow. This response was not potentiated by alpha adrenergic antagonism, but was attenuated by beta adrenergic blockade. These observations suggest an apparent and relative decrease in beta adrenergic receptor activity in the hepatic arterial bed of the baboon when compared to other regional circulations such as the mesenteric and femoral beds. These beta receptors are relatively resistant to both stimulation and blockade.", 
    "2": "It is our practice to suggest coronary arteriography for patients with impending myocardial infarction who respond poorly to medical managemnt. Aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass surgery is advised for patients with unstable angina and left main coronary disease. Surgery is not advised for patients with minimal irregularities of the coronary arteries (less than 50% obstruction). Rarely is surgery advised for patients with the syndrome of impending myocardial infarction in whom only the right coronary artery or the left circumflex artery is obstructed. Bypass surgery should be seriously considered for patients with unstable angina and hemodynamically significant disease involving the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (proximal to the first septal perforating branch). On the basis of symptomatic improvement alone, surgically treated patients with the syndrome of impending myocardial infarction seem to fare better than do those treated medically.", 
    "3": "A 66-year-old man suffered an acute myocardial infarction complicated by multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia and 96 episodes of ventricular fibrillation requiring cardioversion over a period of 55 days. Following ventricular aneurysmectomy, the ventricular tachycardia persisted. This converted to regular sinus rhythm with a regimen of disopyramide phosphate, quinidine, and propranolol.", 
    "4": "In order to evaluate the possible effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on autonomic nervous system function, cardiovascular responses to intravenous isoproterenol, phenylephrine, atropine, and propranolol were compared in hospitalized volunteers before and after 14 days of THC ingestion. There was no significant alteration in responses to isoproterenol or phenylephrine, although in one subject the pressor effect of phenylephrine was considerably augmented by THC. Heart rates after parasympathetic (atropine) blockade and after combined parasympathetic and sympathetic (propranolol) blockade were significantly greater during THC ingestion. These and other data presented are consistent with the picture of reduced sympathetic and enhanced parasympathetic activity described in animals on THC. During THC ingestion, atropine had a pronounced pressor effect, which might represent a clinically significant drug interaction.", 
    "5": "To elucidate the mechanism by which left ventricular and diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is reduced by practolol, ventricular volumes, hemodynamics, and diastolic elastic stiffness were determined before and 10 min after intravenous practolol (400 mug/kg) in 12 patients. Heart rate decreased in all patients after practolol (avg., --9/min, p less than 0.02). There was an insignificant increase in stroke work index and decrease in cardiac index attributable to the fall in rate. Practolol did not change and diastolic volume or ejection fraction, but the average LVEDP fell from 21 to 15 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) which was sustained even with atrial pacing to prepractolol heart rates. Diastolic elastic stiffness was also reduced after practolol (0.665 to 0.593, p less than 0.0025). The data indicate that practolol exerts a negative chronotropic effect on the intact heart and, in contrast to other beta blockers such as propranolol, appears to decrease diastolic stiffness in the left ventricle.", 
    "6": "Patients with chronic obstructive lung disease have a high incidence and wide variety of cardiac arrhythmias. These arrhythmias are often clinically significant and may be life threatening. Although they occur particularly in the context of acute respiratory failure, arrhythmias are not infrequent in clinically stable patients. The relatively high incidence of sudden arrhythmias seen in acute respiratory failure are associated with a very poor prognosis, in particular, ventricular premature beats and multifocal atrial tachycardia. Long-term electrocardiographic monitoring is valuable in increasing the detection of these arrhythmias and in assessing their clinical significance and response to therapy. The mechanisms producing these arrhythmias are poorly understood and probably multiple. However, disturbances of blood gases, blood pH, and electrolytes or the presence of cor pulmonale or associated coronary artery disease is probably important. The therapy of these arrhythmias must include efforts to improve the patient's ventilatory status as well as careful use of standard antiarrhythmic drugs. Further investigation is needed to define the mechanisms, determine the prognosis, and improve the therapy of the arrhythmias found in chronic obstructive lung disease.", 
    "7": "This study was undertaken to determine the circulatory effects of metocurine (dimethyltubocurarine) in 7 men scheduled for coronary artery surgery who had been receiving propranolol for at least 6 weeks before morphine-N2O-O2 anesthesia. The study was divided into 4 measurement periods: (1) control after induction; (2) 5 minutes after administration of 0.35 mg/kg of metocurine; (3) 10 minutes after; (4) 20 minutes after. There were no significant changes in mean blood pressure, heart rate (HR) central venous pressure or arterial blood gases throughout the study. Cardiac index rose significantly from a control value of 1.89 +/- 0.1 L/min/m2 to 2.39 +/- 0.2 L/min/m2 in period 2 and remained elevated throughout (2.53 +/- 0.3 and 2.33 +/- 0.2 Lmin/m2). Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) fell from a control value of 20.2 +/- 1.8 units to 16.1 +/- 1.6 units in period 2 and remained below control in periods 3 and 4 (17.2 +/- 1.8 and 16.9 +/- 1.3). These data suggest that metocurine produced a significant decrease in SVR in the presence of propranolol, resulting in an increase in cardiac output (and stroke volume) in a compensated heart, to maintain perfusion pressure. The possibility of a central (cardiac) effect cannot be excluded, but the lack of an increase in HR suggests it would not be clinically significant.", 
    "8": "Sympathetic adrenergic nervous activity during operantly conditioned hypertension was evaluated by assessing the effects of specific alpha-(phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine) and beta- (propranolol) adrenergic blockers in baboons reinforced for increasing diastolic pressure in daily, 12-h sessions. In the first 10 min of control (no blockade) sessions, mean heart rate increased 24 bpm (21%) above the value for the 10 min immediately prior to the beginning of the sessions; systolic pressure increased 27 mm Hg (22%) and diastolic pressure increased 24 mm Hg (31%). Beta-blockade eliminated the tachycardia but did not attenuate the increased blood pressure. Alpha-blockade did not attenuate the increased blood pressure significantly either. Combined alpha- and beta-blockade did significantly attenuate the increase in diastolic pressure, but consistent, significant increases in systolic pressure (17 mm Hg, 17%) and diastolic pressure (16 mm Hg, 26%) still occurred. The results support the participation of the sympathetic adrenergic nervous system in producing operantly conditioned blood pressure changes, but the results are also consistent with the additional participation of nonadrenergic factors in operantly conditioned hypertension.", 
    "9": "Tests conducted with 125 cats demonstrated that occlusion of the coronary artery causes a higher sensitivity to the bathmotropic action of strophanthin, but does not have any effect on the magnitude of its lethal dose. The efficaciousness of potassium orotate and also of Na2EDTA in combinations with anapriline and isadrine, as regulators of the sensitivity to the toxic effect of strophanthin, was investigated. Immunization of cats with a homocardiac antigen was found to produce biphasic changes in the sensitivity to the toxic effect of strophanthin associated with the duration of antigenic stimulation.", 
    "10": "Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 20 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 3 patients with drug-induced lupus and 20 normal controls were studied. The absolute number of E-rosette-forming cells (ERFC) and surface immunoglobulin-bearing cells were determined during active and inactive stages of the disease. An attempt was made to establish the relationship between the number of ERFC and the clinical stages of the disease on one hand and treatment on the other. A decrease in ERFC was observed in all SLE patients, but it was most prominent in patients with active disease. No correlation was found between treatment and the decreased numbers of ERFC.", 
    "11": "Nitroglycerin should be the first agent prescribed for patients with angina pectoris. When nitroglycerin is used daily, a trial with longer-acting nitrates (eg, isosorbide dinitrate) is warranted. If angina persists, use of beta-adrenergic blocking agent (propranolol) should be considered. Appropriate use of nitrates and propranolol, singly or in combination, will relieve angina pectoris due to coronary heart disease in most patients.", 
    "12": "Catecholamines induce bone resorption and hypercalcaemia by the beta-adrenergic effect in bone and hypercalciuria by the alpha adrenergic effect in kidney. The interplay between the alpha-adrenergic hypercalciuria and beta-adrenergic hypercalcaemia explains why in some, but not all, phaeochromocytomas hypercalcaemia occurs. The hypothesis predicts hypercalciuria in both phaeochromocytoma and neuroblastoma. In hyperthyroidism, negative calcium balance and hypercalcaemia cannot be attributed to the direct effect of thyroid hormones on the bone but can be explained by augmentation of the catecholamine effects on bone and kidney by thyroid hormones. The hypothesis offers a solution for an apparent paradox in hyperthyroidism of increased urinary cAMP while nephrogenous cAMP is decreased. It also explains why propranolol corrects hypercalcaemia without influencing renal calcium loss.", 
    "13": "The kinetics (absorption, distribution and excretion) of carteolol were investigated after oral and intravenous administration to man, rats, Beagle dogs and rabbits. The half-life of carteolol in plasma was 1.22 approximately 1.45 hr in rats, 1.73 approximately 2.08 hr in dogs and 1.42 approximately 1.43 hr in rabbits, and was independent of the route of administration. The absorption rate constants, obtained from log(C1-C) approximately time plot, after oral administration were 1.89 hr-1 in rats, 1.04 hr-1 in dogs and 1.54 hr-1 in rabbits. There were no differences between tablet and film coated tablet in the pharmacokinetic parameters of carteolol in man after oral 30 mg (tablet or film coated tablet) administration [half life (t1/2)=4.50 hr (tablet), 4.30 hr (film coated tablet), elimination rate constant (k2) equals 0.154 hr-1 (tablet), 0.161 hr-1 (film coated tablet)]. The elimination rate constant, obtained from Sigma-minus plot after 2, 5 and 10 mg oral administration, was 0.137 approximately 0.160 hr-1.", 
    "14": "The protective effect of propranolol on ischemic myocardium was studied experimentally and clinically by electron microscope. In an animal experiment, ischemic changes were produced in the posterior papillary muscle of the rabbit following 3, 15, 30 minutes of occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery. Propranolol (0.25 mg/kg) was injected into the left atrial cavity before occlusion of the artery. The posterior papillary muscle was excised and examined by electron microscope. In clinical experience, propranolol (20 microng/kg) was given intravenously to 6 patients who underwent open heart surgery. Transmural left ventricular myocardial biopsy was performed after the anoxic cardic arrest and the material, particularly the subendocardium, was examined by electron microscope. It was shown that propranolol was effective, both in the experiment and in the clinical experience, in preserving ischemic myocardium. The possible mechanisms through which propranolol might act were considered to be (1) indirect effect of altered oxygen supply vs. demand, effect by reducing heart rate and reducing cardiac output due to the drug's function as a beta blocker, (2) direct cellular effect, i.e., reducing myocardial substrate metabolism along with stabilization of cellular structure, and (3) increase collateral circulation to the subendocardium.", 
    "15": "A fluorescent marker for beta-adrenergic receptor sites, 9-amino-acridin propranolol (9-AAP), was administered intravenously to rats. In contrast to other tissues which are known to contain beta-adrenergic receptors, 9-AAP fluorescence was not observed in the walls of the pial as well as parenchymal cerebral vessels. These negative findings strongly suggest that in the rat, beta-adrenergic receptors are not present in the cerebral vasculature. The role of the alpha-adrenergic receptors needs more study.", 
    "16": "Breakdown of the blood aqueous barrier in the rabbit eye induces a protein leakage into the aqueous humor, seen as a flare in the anterior chamber. A barrier damage was induced by topical prostaglandin E2(PGE2), infrared irradiation of the iris, or alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) given subcutaneously. The aqueous flare was measured quantitatively by means of a photoelectric instrument. The interference of adrenergic antagonists and agonists on the breakdown of the barrier was tested. The alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine and the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, given intravenously, had no effect on exogenously administered PGE2, but both antagonists reduced the flare response to infrared irradiation which is supposed to exert its effect via endogenous prostaglandin release. The alpha-MSH response was unaffected by phentolamine, whereas propranolol abolished the flare response to alpha-MSH totally. The PGE1 response was unaffected both by the alpha-adrenergic agonist noradrenaline and the beta-adrenergic agonist terbutalin sulfate, administered topically. Noradrenaline, however, inhibited the flare response to infrared irradiation and facilitated the flare response to alpha-MSH. Terbutalin sulfate worked synergistically with both infrared irradiation and alpha-MSH. It is assumed that alpha-MSH exerts its effect on the barrier via enhanced beta-adrenergic activity, whereas the effects caused by infrared irradiation seem conditioned by intact alpha- as well as beta-adrnergic receptor sites.", 
    "17": "Sympathetic nerve cells enter the embryonic chick heart on the fifth day in ovo, but it is uncertain when these nerves become functional. Using pharmacological probes known to affect the embryonic circulation, sympathetic nerve function was examined at various stages of development. Exogenous norepinephrine elicited cardioacceleration in the hearts of embryos with intact extraembryonic circulation both before (stage 20-24) and after (stage 28-32) sympathetic innervation of the heart, and this acceleration could be inhibited by propranolol and practolol. In contrast, ganglionic stimulation with 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP) elicited cardioacceleration only after stages 27-28 (i.e., after sympathetic innervation), producing a 25-30% increase in heart rate over the predrug levels of 148.7 +/- 1.8 beats/min. DMPP-elicited positive chronotropy was reduced by beta-receptor antagonists, hexamethonium, guanethidine (GuE), and tetrodotoxin. In preparations of the embryonic thorax in which the innervated heart was separated from brain and adrenal influences, DMPP elicited a GuE-sensitive cardioacceleration. It is concluded that during chick embryonic development, no more than a 1-day interval exists between the appearance of sympathetic nerves in the heart and the onset of neuronal function in that organ.", 
    "18": "The intrarenal mechanisms of renin release were studied in the isolated perfused rabbit kidney during stimulation by isoproterenol, 0.01 mug/kg per min, and by theophylline, 0.87 mg/kg per min. In the absence of urinary flow during the early stages of perfusion, isoproterenol caused a 17% increase of renal vein serum renin concentration (RVSRC) (P less than 0.001) without changing renal blood flow, renal vascular resistance, or serum potassium. dl-Propranolol, 2.0 mg/kg per min. abolished this isoproterenol-induced renin release. A moderate reduction in perfusion pressure prior to the infusion of isoproterenol resulted in a marked additional stimulation of renin release. Studies during and following ureteral occlusion demonstrated that theophylline stimulates renin release by decreasing renal vascular resistance, whereas the concomitant increase in sodium transport to the macula densa exerted an opposite effect. dl-Propranolol did not affect theophylline-induced renin secretion. It is concluded that single exogenous stimuli may activate more than one intrarenal mechanism simultaneously. Isoproterenol has a direct renin-stimulatory effect on intrarenal beta-adrenergic receptors that may be reinforced by baroreceptor stimulation. Theophylline stimulates renin via a baroreceptor mechanism, with simultaneous renin suppression via a sodium-macula densa effect.", 
    "19": "The effect of acebutolol a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent was tested on the dog heart in situ. The drug decreased heart rate, and caused a reduction in the conduction velocity and a significant increase in the functional refractory period of the atrioventricular node. The functional and the effective refractory period of the right atrium was increased by acebutolol. During sinus rhythm, the drug did not affect conduction velocity in the rest of the conduction pathway. During atrial pacing, however, the intra-atrial and His-Purkinje conduction times were slightly increased. The plasma concentrations of acebutolol were in the range between 0.09 and 0.5 mug/ml, which is far below those values expected to cause a membrane-stabilizing or quinidine-like effect. The clinical applications of the results are discussed.", 
    "20": "Murine neoplastic mast cells which have been loaded with exogenous labelled histamine, released 14C-histamine when exposed to increasing concentrations of phenylephrine and noradrenaline. Adrenaline was only slightly effective, while isoprenaline and dibutyryl-cyclic-AMP were fully inactive. The release of histamine evoked by alpha-adrenergic agonists was antagonized by phentolamine, and left unchanged by practolol and cocaine. It is concluded that alpha-adrenoceptors may be valuable in evoking histamine release by murine neoplastic mast cells.", 
    "21": "A system of digital measuring of the cardiac action potential was constructed in order to measure quickly and accurately the resting potential or maximum diastolic potential, overshoot potential, amplitude, time for 50% repolarization and time for 90% repolarization. This system consists of a dual-beam oscilloscope, a digital voltage meter, a digital interval meter and a simple circuit constructed by operational amplifiers. The measurement of the action potential was achieved by tracing only the resting potential or the maximum diastolic potential and the crest of the action potential on the oscilloscope using another beam. The time for measurement is usually 10-15 sec and errors in measurement were considered to be negligible. This system is considered to be useful for digital measurement of the action potential of various cardiac tissues. This system was applied for observation of effects of bufetolol, an adrenergic beta-receptor blocking drug on the action potential of the dog Purkinje fibres. Bufetolol (10(-5) M) caused a slight depolarization of the maximum diastolic potential, decreased overshoot potential, amplitude and maximum rate of rise, and shortened the time for 50% repolarization of the action potential. Bufetolol (10(-4) M) additionally prolonged the time for 90% repolarization.", 
    "22": "The role of the alpha-adrenergic receptors in the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias induced in the isolated rat right ventricle has been studied. The administration of six alpha-adrenergic blocking agents (phenoxybenzamine, dibenamine, phentolamine, tolazoline, azapetine and SY-28) did not alter the automatism induced. Even when can not be excluded the existance of alpha-adrenergic receptors in the rat ventricle, it is clear that alpha-blocking drugs are ineffective to abolish the arrhythmias induced by an increase in the activity of the Purkinje fibers.", 
    "23": "Currently the role of stress as a potential factor in cardiovascular disease is receiving considerable attention. Accordingly, it is important to know how it is defined and identified, how it affects the cardiovascular system and how it can be managed with the knowledge presently available. An overview of the present body of knowledge on the relationship between stress and cardiovascular disease is presented for the reader's consideration.", 
    "24": "The chronotropic effects of all currently available volatile anesthetics were investigated in isolated rat atrial preparations. Anesthetic ethers, diethyl ether, methoxyflurane, and enflurane elicited a dose-dependent positive chronotropic effect. Fluroxene produced a slight depression at low concentrations. The halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics, halothane, chloroform, and trichloroethylene, did not show a uniform pattern. Halothane's effect was small and biphasic. Chloroform caused a dose-dependent decrease in heart rate, and trichloroethylene caused a marked positive chronotropic effect. The dose-response curves in all anesthetics remained unaltered in the presence of either 3 x 10(-7) M dl-propranolol or 1 x 10(-6) M atropine. It is concluded that volatile anesthetics elicit significant direct chronotropic actions on rat atrial preparations. The mechanism of their actions does not involve stimulation of beta-adrenergic or cholinergic receptors.", 
    "25": "Heart rate, arterial pressure and cardiac output were recorded in eight healthy male volunteers during exposure to 80 mmHg of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) in the supine position before and after beta-adrenergic and combined beta-adrenergic and parasympathetic blockade of the heart as induced by the i.v. administration of propranolol 0.25 mg/kg b.wt. and atropine 0.04 mg/kg b.wt. After propranolol, heart rate response to LBNP averaged 48% of that observed without blockade indicating that LBNP-induced cardioacceleration is of both sympathetic and parasympathetic origin. Tolerance to LBNP was reduced by beta-adrenergic blockade, since the decrease in mean arterial pressure during LBNP was exaggerated by such blockade. Although the addition of atropine markedly elevated mean arterial pressure and cardiac output in the control situation, tolerance to LBNP was not enhanced by this drug as judged from the arterial pressure response. Post-LBNP overshoot in mean arterial pressure was strikingly augmented by combined cardiac effector blockade and was in part due to a lingering elevation of total peripheral resistance, cardiac output remaining decreased for more than 110 s after release of LBNP.", 
    "26": "Identification and characterization of hormone receptors on the cell surface is an effective tool for studying the plasma membrane. Using the direct binding of a radiolabeled antagonist, (-)[3H]alprenolol, to crude membrane preparations, and a physiological response (cellular cyclic AMP levels), I demonstrated a catecholamine (beta-adrenergic) hormone receptor site coupled to a catecholamine responsive adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] on 3T3 and simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed 3T3 cells. At a concentration of 1 muM, epinephrine and isoproterenol elevate cellular cyclic AMP levels 8- and 12-fold, respectively, in both cell lines. Norepinephrine was also a potent agonist on 3T3 cells (8-fold stimulation), but SV3T3 cells showed a lesser (2-fold) response to this hormone. The specificity of the physiological response (as well as the direct binding studies using the alprenolol radiolabel) is indicated by the increased effectiveness of (-) compared to (+) stereoisomers, rapid and reversible kinetics (steady state within 2 min), high affinity (Kd approximately 30 nM) and saturability (indicating a finite number of hormone receptors). These hormone receptor studies indicate the 3T3 cells have a beta1 adrenergic receptor while the SV3T3 cells have a receptor with beta2 qualities. In addition, the number of beta-adrenergic hormone receptors appear to be increased in the normal 3T3 cells by approximately 2-fold over the SV3T3 cells (300 versus versus 120 femtomol/mg of protein).", 
    "27": "A series of 1,3-benzodioxole derivatives was synthesized. We found four compounds (2,3,10 and 11 in Table IV) to have about the same order of beta-blocking activity as that of sotalol. In addition, it is of interest that some of the compounds (2-4) were found to have hypotensive activites, although they were about one-tenth of that of hydralazine. Sotalol did not produce any change in blood pressure, and propranolol raised the blood pressure.", 
    "28": "The effects of various adrenergic beta receptor agonists and antagonists on lipolysis (measured as glycerol release) in human adipose tissue in vitro were studied. Of the agonists investigated, the potency rank order was isoproteronol greater than norepinephrine greater than salbutamol. Adrenergic beta receptor blocking drugs inhibited catecholamineinduced lipolysis competitively. Propranolol was the overall most effective compound, followed by metoprolol, alprenolol and practolol, whereas butoxamine and H35/25 were weak inhibitors. The results indicate that the adrenergic reciptor mediating lipolysis in human adipose tissue is of type beta-1. Basal and theophylline-induced lipolysis was reduced when higher concentrations of these drug were used.", 
    "29": "The pulmonary vascular response to intracranial hypertension was studied in anesthetized controlled ventilated dogs in which intracranial pressure (ICP) was elevated to 20 Torr below the mean arterial pressure for a 20-min period, and regulated at this level. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increased from control value of 2.7 +/- 0.30 to 8.3 +/- 0.51 Torr-l-1-min at the end of 20-min increase in ICP. The increase in PVR was associated with marked increase (P less than 0.001) in pulmonary arterial pressure from 14.4 +/- 1.3 to 35.4 +/- 4.0 Torr, small increase in left atrial pressure from 5.4 +/- 1.2 to 7.9 +/- 1.9 Torr, and no significant change in pulmonary blood flow. The increase in PVR occurred independently of changes in the arterial pressure. The increase in PVR induced by elevated ICP was correlated with increases in lung water, physiological shunt (Qs/Qt), alveolar dead space (VD), and with hypoxemia. Pretreatment with propranolol (1.5 mg-kg-1) attenuated the increase in PVR during elevation in ICP; the smaller increase in PVR was associated with a marked increase in left atrial pressure and a smaller increase in pulmonary perfusion pressure than in the control group. The propranolol-treated dogs also developed increases in lung water, Qs/Qt, VD, and hypoxemia. In contrast, pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine (1.5 mg-kg-1) inhibited the increases in pulmonary perfusion pressure and PVR induced by ICP elevation as well as the associated increases in lung water, Qs/Qt, VD, and hypoxemia. Therefore, a sustained elevation in ICP at a level below the mean arterial pressure in the intact dog evokes pulmonary vasoconstriction which is mediated by alpha-adrenergic mechanisms. The neurogenic pulmonary vasoconstriction results in the increases in lung water, Qs/Qt, VD, and in the hypoxemia.", 
    "30": "1. Lipolysis by isolated white adipocytes from hamsters, as measured by glycerol production, was stimulated by corticotropin, isopropylnorepinephrine (INE), norepinephrine, or epinephrine (EPI), in a dose-dependent fashion. 2. Lipolysis was stimulated by five inhibitors of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase: caffeine, theophylline, 1-methyl-3-isobutyl xanthine, 1-ethyl-4-(isopropylidenehydrazine)-1H-pyrazolo-(3,4,-b)-pyridine-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (SQ 20009), and 4-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone (Ro 7-2956). Caffeine-stimulated lipolysis consistently attained higher rates than did hormone-stimulated lipolysis. However, when cells were stimulated by both caffeine and a hormone, lipolytic rates were consistently lower than those attained under the influence of caffeine alone. 3. Isolated white adipocytes from hamsters were sensitive to both alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol could completely inhibit norepinephrine-stimulated glycerol production. The alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine, on the other hand, had a biphasic effect on the cells. At 5-10(-7) M or 5-10(-6) M, phentolamine enhanced norepinephrine-stimulated lipolysis, while concentrations higher than 5-10(-5) M caused inhibition. 4. The effects of two different concentrations of six antilipolytic agents, prostaglandin E1, nicotinic acid, phenylisopropyladenosine, 5-methylpyrazole-3-carboxylic acid, adenosine and insulin, were measured. With the exception of insulin, all of these agents showed much more potent inhibition of caffeine-stimulated lipolysis than of hormone-stimulated lipolysis. Insulin, in contrast, showed only modest inhibition of hormone-stimulated lipolysis and virtually no inhibition of caffeine-stimulated lipolysis.", 
    "31": "Ten hypertensive patients were treated with propranolol throughout pregnancy. Propranolol had a favorable effect on blood pressure and perhaps on other signs of pre-eclampsia too. No increase in uterine contractility, causing premature delivery, was noted. Weight at birth and APGAR index in infants was apparently not unfavorably influenced. Cardiac rhythm and blood glucose levels at birth were not studied. Theoretical risks of beta-blockers during pregnancy (premature delivery, danger to the foetus) may be overestimated and should be reevaluated in a prospective way.", 
    "32": "Using the ligands [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol and [3H]prostaglandin E1 ([3H]PGE1), we have studied the relationship of receptors for beta-adrenergic agents and for PGE1 to adenylate cyclase in membranes of parental, hybrid, and variant mammalian cell lines. Fusion of parental clones responsive to beta-adrenergic agonists (beta+) with unresponsive clones (beta-) produced hybrid clones with a greatly diminished beta-adrenergic response; beta+ X beta leads to beta-. Binding studies with [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol showed a decreased concentration of beta receptors in six such hybrid clones. Thus, paucity of beta-adrenergic receptors is probably a sufficient, albeit not necessarily complete, explanation for the decreased beta-adrenergic responsiveness of the hybrid clones. When a clone with beta receptor but without apparent adenylate cyclase activity (HC-1) was hybridized with a beta- clone that has adenylate cyclase (B82), a responsive hybrid clone was obtained. In nine cell hybrids produced by the fusion of clones responsive (PGE1+) and unresponsive (PGE1-) to PGE1, high affinity binding sites for [3H]PGE1 were expressed in the same manner as was PGE1-sensitive adenylate cyclase: PGE1+ X PGE1 leads to PGE1+. The chemical specificities and affinities of the parental receptors and responsive adenylate cyclases were faithfully reproduced in the hybrid clones. Activation by PGE1 was proportional to the occupation of the high affinity receptors. In a wild type lymphoma clone (24.3.2), the concentration dependences for binding of [3H]PGE1 and for activation of adenyalte cyclase by PGE1 were identical. In a variant lymphoma clone (94.15.1) lacking adenylate cyclase activity, no high affinity receptors for PGE1 were detected, whereas beta-adrenergic receptors have been demonstrated in this variant clone (Insel, P.A., Maguire, M.E., Gilman, A.G., Coffino, P., Bourne, H., and Melmon, K. (1976) Mol. Pharmacol. 12, 1062-1069). Hybrid cells formed by the fusion of 94.15.1 with cell line RAG (PGE1-) responded to PGE1. Clone 94.15.1 may have receptors for PGE1 of reduced affinity or in low concentration. Alternatively, RAG and 94.15.1 may have complementary genetic defects such that the RAG X 94.15.1 hybrid cells express a hormonally responsive receptor-adenylate cyclase system.", 
    "33": "Timolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with little or no cardiodepressant activity, was studied in acute myocardial ischemia in cats. Timolol, at a dose of 25 mug/kg, blocked 75 to 80% of the cardiac response to isoproterenol. This dose also significantly reduced heart rate in cats subjected to acute myocardial ischemia by ligation of the left coronary artery. Timolol significantly prevented the spread of ischemic damage in the myocardium as assessed by (a) curtailing the increase in plasma creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity, (b) preventing the loss of CPK from the ischemic portion of the myocardium, and (c) restoring the elevated S-T segment of the electrocardiogram toward normal. Timolol did not significantly retard the increase in fragility of lysosomes in ischemic myocardial tissue. The mechanism of the protective effect to timolol on the ischemic myocardium appears to be via reducing myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing heart rate.", 
    "34": "To reduce the high maternal and fetal mortality in pheochromocytoma of pregnancy, therapy is advocated with phenoxybenzamine and propranolol to obtain adequate alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. In early pregnancy control of symptoms may be difficult, but the patient may be carried to term with such medical therapy. Delivery should be by cesarean section before the onset of labour, with, if possible, simultaneous removal of the tumour. Additional preoperative preparation with phenoxybenzamine and propranolol and careful intraoperative management are essential. During her third pregnancy a 29-year-old woman was found to have a pheochromocytoma of the left adrenal gland. After the medical therapy and preparation described, the infant was delivered by cesarean section and the mother's left adrenal gland excised. Eight-year follow-up, including during a fourth pregnancy, showed no recurrence of tumour in the mother and only mild hypertension. The infant developed normally.", 
    "35": "Homogenates of frontal cerebral cortex of the rat were prepared from microdiscs punched out in areas rich in dopaminergic terminals. Under optimal assay conditions, dopamine (10-4 M) stimulated an adenylate cyclase present in these homogenates by 80-100%. This stimulation reached 200% when microdiscs were punched out from the medial part of the frontal cerebral cortex, adjacent to the forceps minor. Dopamine interacted with an homogeneous population of receptor sites which had an apparent affinity (KD) of 3.8 +/- 0.9 x 10-6 M (N = 4). The dopamine receptor was blocked by fluphenazine and phentolamine but had no affinity for pindolol, propranolol or L-isoproterenol. The affinities of several neuroleptics having different chemical structures were simultaneously determined on striatal and on frontal cerebral cortex dopamine sensitive adenylate cyclases. Fluphenazine was more potent in blocking the striatal than the frontal cerebral cortex dopaminergic receptors. In contrast, in all experiments, haloperidol had an higher affinity for the cerebral frontal cortex than for the striatal dopaminergic receptors. Thus, haloperidol was less effective than fluphenazine in blocking the striatal dopaminergic receptors, and equally potent than fluphenazine in inhibiting the frontal cerebral cortex dopamine sensitive adenylate cyclase. Chlorpromazine, thioridazine and clozapine had the same affinity for the two dopaminergic adenylate cyclase systems. L-isoproterenol interacted with an homogeneous population of beta-adrenergic receptor sites (KD = 3 +/- 2 X 10-7 M; N = 4) coupled with an adenylate cyclase distince from the dopamine sensitive adenylate cyclase. This beta-receptor had no affinity for dopamine or fluphenazine but was blocked by propranolol or pindolol. L-Norepinephrine was shown to stimulate both the dopamine (KD = 1.8 +/- 1 X 10-5 M; N = 4) and the beta-adrenergic (KD = 8 +/- 3 X 10-7 M; N = 4) sensitive adenylate cyclases. Thus, the L-norepinephrine effect was totally blocked in the combined presence of fluphenazine and pindolol.", 
    "36": "The potency of blockade of bufetolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, and effects of bufetolol on the action potential, contractile force and various electrophysiological properties of the atrium were investigated in comparison with propranolol and quinidine. Bufetolol had a pA2 of 8.65 against the positive chronotropic action of isoproternol on the guinea pig sinus node. Bufetolol, 10(-7) g/ml, did not affect the action potential of the atrial muscle, while the drug, 3 X 10(-5) g/ml, significantly decreased the overshoot potential, the amplitude and the maximum rate of rise of the action potential and prolonged the times for 50% and 90% repolarization. The contractile force was reduced by bufetol, 3 X 10(-5) g/ml. The maximum responsive frequency to the driving stimulus was decreased by bufetol, 3 X 10(-5) g/ml. The excitability of the muscle membrane was suppressed by bufetolo, 3 X 10(-5) g/ml, as indicated by changes in membrane responsiveness, membrane reactivation and strength-duration curve. Propranolol, 10(-5) g/ml and quinidine, 10(-5) g/ml showed similar effects on excitability. The authors suggest that these effects of bufetolol are responsible for its antidyshythmic effects.", 
    "37": "20 patients with severe essential hypertension (average blood-pressure 211/123 mm Hg) had an inadequate fall in blood-pressure with beta blockade alone. They were given in random order either 5 and then 10 mg of bendrofluazide a day or prazosin 2 mg three times daily rising to 5 mg if required. The trial was a within-patient comparison of the two drug regimens. 10 patients who did not achieve a satisfactory fall in pressure with either agent were then given all three drugs together. When bendrofluazide 5 or 10 mg was added to beta blockade there was an average fall in mean blood-pressure, standing, of 13%. When prazosin was added to beta blockade the average fall in mean blood-pressure, standing, was 16%. 18 patients who completed the trial had an average final blood-pressure, standing, of 139/93 mm Hg. In the prazosin period 8 patients continued to complain of dizziness after the first 24 h. With bendrofluazide serum-potassium levels fell below 3-6 mmol/l in half the patients within the first two weeks of treatment. It is concluded that patients with essential hypertension already treated with beta blockade who need an additional agent will get a further fall in blood-pressure with 5 mg of bendrofluazide. Prazosin appears to be a potent and appropriate third agent.", 
    "38": "Circulatory regulation in response to postural changes follows mechanical rules, whereby the shifts in volume in the various organs of the body play an essential role. The change from the horizontal to the vertical position is accompanied by a decrease in pressure above the hydrostatic neutral point, i.e. in the cephalic vessels, whereas the capacious vessels in the caudal region are dilated and the venous return becomes sluggish. As a consequence of the different time courses followed by the various circulatory parameters in the wake of counter-regulatory measures, a distinction can be made between an early orthostatic instant regulatory response and a late orthostatic response. Prominent clinical features do not necessarily always consist of non-systemic dizziness, tinnitus, pallor cold sweat and, finally, orthostatic collapse, but general subjective symptoms such as deafness and tingling of the extremities, a chilly sensation and cardiac symptoms may frequently predominante. In the case of development of an autonomic neurotic symptom complex, psychoautonomic symptoms such as general sleep disturbance are observed. Apart from investigations carried out on a surgical tilting table in general practice, other procedures such as the Valsalva manoeuvre, the squatting test and, in most cases, the erect test are performed. Broadly speaking four different reaction types can be distinguished amongst cases of postural hypotension. Drugs with different therapeutic actions are selectively administered according to the pathophysiological characteristics of the individual patient and the sympathetic adrenal counter-regulatory response. Medico-mechanical measures and physical training should not be neglected.", 
    "39": "26 hypertensive patients groupded according to the severity-index and the WHO-index were treated with pindolol (monotherapy, 15 mg daily). The response of blood pressure depression was statistically significant, although not always sufficient when judged by clinical parameters. Plasma renin activity responded variably to the treatment in different patients and different groups. In 18 patients a statistically significant increase of serum potassium could be observed. No major side effects of therapy were encountered.", 
    "40": "The effects of adrenergic stimulation of the lateral hypothalamic area on sodium and potassium excretion were studied in rats bearing implanted cannulae. When noradrenaline was injected into several points of the lateral hypothalamic area, a dose-related increase in natriuresis and kaliuresis was observed. Rats previously injected through the same cannulae with alpha (Regitine) or beta (Propranolol) blocking agents showed different natriuretic responses when injected with noradrenaline. It was observed that the normal noradrenaline-induced natriuresis was abolished by the alpha-adrenergic blockers, while beta-adrenergic blockers increased the response. Intrahypothalamic injection of Isoproterenol, and activator of the beta-adrenergic receptor, induced a decrease in natriuresis, kaliuresis and urinary volume. In contrast, injection of Metaraminol, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, caused an increase in sodium and potassium excretion and a reduction of urinary volume. Drugs blocking the destruction of noradrenaline or its reuptake by the presynaptic nerve endings potentiated 2-fold the action of 20 nmol of noradrenaline. These experiments provide good evidence for the existence of an adrenergic mechanism consisting of alpha and beta receptors which works antagonistically on the regulation of sodium and potassium excretion. The excretion on the two electrolytes is stimulated by the alpha-adrenergic system, and inhibited by the beta-adrenergic system.", 
    "41": "The developments concern methods of application and therapeutic agents. Regarding drug aplication Ocusert has to be mentioned: inserted in the cul de sac of the eye once a week it releases a low concentration of a substance continuously and with a constant rate. For acetazolamid (Diamox) it has been shown, that in long term treatment much lower concentrations than usual are effective. Efforts regarding new local agents reducing intraocular pressure are stimulating as well as inhibiting the sympathetic tone. The practically most important discovery so far is Clonidine, whose pressure lowering mechanism is not quite clarified yet and which, due to other problems, demands a very critical indication. Beta-receptor-blocking agents, such as Propranolol could become somewhat important, as well as for some special indications the chemical sympathectomy by 6-Hydroxydopamine. The sympatholytic agent Guanethidine proves to be very valuable in special cases. Besides the pressure reducing treatment medicamentally achieved increase of the blood supply to the optic nerve becomes more important. It becomes more and more evident that the elevation of the stroke volume--thus heart output--by cardiac therapy is important what demands collaboration with colleagues of other disciplines.", 
    "42": "Quinidine, propranolol and their combination were studied in atrial fibrillation induced by the topical application of acetylcholine or aconitine, injury-stimulation-induced atrial flutter and ventricular ectopic tachycardia produced by coronary occlusion in the dog. The effect of combination of quinidine and propranolol was significantly greater than that of the individual drug in atrial arrhythmias but not in ventricular arrhythmias. The study provides experimental support for the combined clinical use of quinidine and propranolol in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias.", 
    "43": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system in mediating the aldosterone response to sodium depletion was examined by administration of propranolol during dietary sodium restriction. The beta-adrenergic antagonist prevented the expected increase of plasma renin activity in response to sodium restriction in six of twelve studies. Plasma angiotensin II concentration failed to increase in four of five subjects in whom the renin response was abolished. Despite unchanged or decreased plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin II concentration, plasma aldosterone concentration increased significantly in response to dietary sodium restriction. The increase in aldosterone production could not be attributed to changes in plasma sodium or potassium concentration or increased ACTH secretion. It is suggested that the aldosterone response to sodium restriction is mediated not only by increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II concentration, but also another mechanism, possibly related to increased adrenal sensitivity to angiotensin during sodium depletion.", 
    "44": "Incubation of Gpp(NH)p-activated adenylate cyclase in the presence of isoproterenol caused the release of bound [3H]-Gpp(NH)p, and the decline of activity to the basal state. The isoproterenol-induced release of the nucleotide was proportional to the decrease in adenylate cyclase activity. Since there is a large excess of Gpp(NH)p binding sites in the membrane, the isoproterenol induced release of Gpp(NH)p, rather than binding of the nucleotide, was used to measure the amount of guanyl nucleotide binding sites coupled to the activated adenylate cyclase. This amount, 1.5-2.0 pmoles/mg membrane protein, is only approximately 1% of the total Gpp(NH)p binding sites, and is about equal to the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in the membrane. Chromatographic analysis revealed that Gpp(NH)p was released from the membrane as an intact molecule. The findings suggest that persistent activation of the adenylate cyclase is due to persistent binding of Gpp(NH)p to the regulatory site, and that this GTP analog is a better activator of the adenylate cyclase than GTP because of its resistance to hydrolysis.", 
    "45": "It is generally believed that preoperative iodide decreases the hyperplasia of the toxic thyroid gland. Histometric studies of glands from thyrotoxic patients pretreated with propranolol alone compared with those from patients pretreated with propranolol and iodide failed to confirm this. Although histological appearances and volume percentage measurement of component tissues suggested that the glandular epithelium had involuted after iodine treatment, measurement of their absolute mass indicated that the mean mass of epithelium was the same in both groups and that involution had not occurred. We conclude that considerable confusion in the thyroid literature has arisen through incorrect use of the term involution.", 
    "46": "1. The effects of two groups of diuretics on renin secretion have been compared in dogs anaesthetized with pentobarbital. 2. Frusemide, ethacrynic acid and bumetanide cause an immediate rise in renin secretion which is not inhibited either by DL-propranolol or by a bilateral ureterovenous anastomosis which prevents salt and water loss. 3. Clopamide, metolazone and indapamide do not cause an immediate rise in renin secretion. Renin hypersecretion is induced only 1 h after intravenous injection of these diuretics. 4. Renin secretion was studied for 6 h after frusemide injection: the immediate rise was followed by a later increase in renin secretion. This later rise was inhibited by propranolol and by ureterovenous anastomosis. 5. These results allow us to distinguish between a direct renal mechanism responsible for early renin hypersecretion, which appears to be connected with the action of the diuretic on the ascending limb of Henle's loop, and an indirect mechanism responsible for late renin hypersecretion, which appears to be connected with salt and water loss."
