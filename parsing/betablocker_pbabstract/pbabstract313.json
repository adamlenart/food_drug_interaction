This effect was not significantly attenuated by the 5-HT4 antagonist SDZ250557 (SDZ). In the presence of (+/-) pindolol (1 microM) and methysergide (1 microM), employed to mask 5-HT1 and beta-adrenergic, and 5-HT2 receptors respectively, SC failed to relax NA pre-contracted CC strips to a greater extent than saline. Functional cAMP dependent relaxation pathways were demonstrated by a significant reduction in NA induced tone by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and isopropylnoradrenaline (IPNA), the action of the latter compound was effectively eliminated in the presence of (+/-) pindolol. Relaxation of NA induced tone caused by the nitric oxide donor nitro-glycerine (NTG) was significant and similar in the absence and presence of the 5-HT and beta-adrenergic antagonists. The results of this present study indicate that human corporal smooth muscle does not contain 5-HT4 receptors and that, although compounds like SC act to relax non-vascular smooth muscle via cAMP dependent mechanisms, 5-HT4 receptor agonists may be expected to be of limited utility in triggering cAMP dependent relaxation responses in human CC.", 
    "1": "Medical research has helped to clarify the benefits of some therapies for improving the treatment or outcome associated with cardiovascular disease. However, the adoption of these approaches into routine clinical practice is, in many cases, inadequate. Consequently, there are many missed opportunities to reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. This review summarizes the factors that may prevent modified behavior in medical practice and the effectiveness of interventions that influence change. There are many barriers that may prevent or slow the adoption of new therapeutic advances into routine clinical practice. As a result, the use of well-proven, efficacious therapy can be suboptimal. Because of this underuse, the realized benefits of treatment are below the potential benefits. Adoption of new therapies is highly dependent on the use of interventions to promote clinical change. However, the effectiveness of different types of interventions varies greatly. Nevertheless, there is a wide range of strategies available that can be used to induce real changes in practice performance and potentially improve patient outcomes. It is essential that future intervention strategies focus on improving adoption of new therapies into clinical practice. The physician must be encouraged to prescribe proven treatments to those patients who stand to benefit most. In addition, better systems of care should be developed that improve the identification of patients as suitable candidates for proven treatments and sustain their long-term commitment to therapy.", 
    "2": "Chronic heart failure causes disturbances in ventilation and pulmonary gas transfer that participate in limiting peak exercise oxygen uptake (VO(2p )). The beta-adrenergic receptor blocker carvedilol improves left ventricular (LV) function and not VO(2p). This study was aimed at investigating the pulmonary response to changes in LV performance produced by carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "3": "Twenty-one patients with New York Heart Association class II to III heart failure were randomly assigned (2 to 1) to carvedilol (25 mg twice daily, n = 14) or placebo (n = 7) for 6 months. Rest forced expiratory volume (FEV(1)), vital capacity, total lung capacity, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, its alveolar-capillary membrane component, pulmonary venous and transmitral flows (for monitoring changes in LV end-diastolic pressure), LV diastolic and systolic dimensions, stroke volume, ejection fraction, and fiber shortening velocity were measured at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. VO(2p), peak ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT(p)), ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO(2)), and VO(2) at anaerobic threshold (VO(2at)) were also determined.", 
    "4": "FEV(1), vital capacity, total lung capacity, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, and the alveolar-capillary membrane component were impaired in chronic heart failure compared with 14 volunteers and did not vary with treatment. Carvedilol reduced end-diastolic pressure, end-diastolic diameter, and end-systolic diameter and increased ejection fraction, stroke volume, and fiber shortening velocity without affecting VO(2p), VO(2at), VD/VT(p), or VE/VCO(2) at 3 and 6 months. Placebo did not produce significant changes.", 
    "5": "In chronic heart failure carvedilol ameliorates LV function at rest and does not significantly affect ventilation and pulmonary gas transfer or functional capacity. These results suggest that improvement in cardiac hemodynamics with carvedilol does not reverse pulmonary dysfunction. Persistent lung impairment might have some role in the failure of carvedilol to improve exercise performance.",

    "10": "The aim of the present study was to assess the alterations in cardiac Ca2+ homeostasis induced by hypertension using electrically paced right ventricular strips from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2 Basal contractile force was higher in SHR than in WKY. Similarly, the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (10 nM-10 microM) induced a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect that was higher in SHR than in WKY, which was in turn inhibited by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (1 microM) in both strains. 3 Preincubation of strips with the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers, nifedipine (1 microM) or verapamil (10 microM), markedly inhibited the isoprenaline response, the inhibition being higher in SHR than in WKY. However, this inhibition was minor by the T-type Ca2+ channel blocker mibefradil (10 microM). 4 Bay K 8644 (10 nM-10 microM), a L-type Ca2+ channel activator induced a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect, that was greater in SHR than WKY. 5 Nifedipine and verapamil (both 0.1 nM-10 microM) inhibited in a concentration-dependent way the inotropic effect induced by 0.3 microM isoprenaline or 1 microM Bay K 8644. The inhibition was higher in SHR than in WKY. Mibefradil (0.1 nM-10 microM) only clearly inhibited the isoprenaline and Bay K 8644 inotropic effects at 10 microM in both strains. 6 The inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release, ryanodine (10 nM-10 microM), was a more effective depressor of isoprenaline-induced response in SHR than in WKY. 7 These results suggest that cardiac Ca2+ homeostasis in SHR ventricular strips is altered compared with those of WKY, showing an increased Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels and release from sarcoplasmic reticulum; the participation of T-type Ca2+ channels are irrelevant in this tissue.", 
    "11": "The present study was carried out to further investigate the nature of the beta-adrenoceptor in rabbit jejunum using BRL 37344, a selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonist, cyanopindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with blocking activity at beta3-adrenoceptors and SR 59230A, a new selective beta3-adrenoceptor antagonist. Isoprenaline produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the spontaneous contractions of rabbit jejunum with a pD2 of 7.14. Propranolol (1 microM) shifted the isoprenaline concentration-response curve (CRC) to the right with a concentration-ratio of 5.85, considerably less than would be expected for an action at classical beta-adrenoceptors (estimated pA2 6.66). BRL 37344 also produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of spontaneous contractions with a pD2 of 7.41. The BRL 37344 CRC was unaffected by propranolol (1 microM). In the presence of propranolol (1 microM), cyanopindolol (1 microM) shifted the isoprenaline CRC to the right (concentration-ratio of 21). Cyanopindolol also shifted the BRL 37344 CRC to the right (concentration-ratio of 38). These shifts are consistent with the affinity of cyanopindolol for beta3-adrenoceptors (estimated pA2 values of 7.27 and 7.38 against isoprenaline and BRL 37344, respectively). In the presence of propranolol (1 microM), SR 59230A produced a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the isoprenaline CRC. The Schild plot gave a pA2 value of 7.16, although the slope of the regression line was significantly different from unity (0.65). SR 59230A also produced a concentration-dependent shift of the BRL 37344 CRC. The Schild plot gave a pA2 of 7.58 with the slope of the regression line not significantly different from unity (0.81). The presence of beta3-adrenoceptors mediating relaxation of spontaneous contractions in rabbit jejunum is supported by the relatively poor antagonism of isoprenaline by propranolol, the relaxant effect of BRL 37344 and the antagonism of isoprenaline and BRL 37344 by cyanopindolol and SR 59230A. The lack of simple competitive antagonism of isoprenaline, but not BRL 37344, by SR 59230A may suggest more than one population of atypical beta-adrenoceptor.", 
    "12": "The site of impulse origin in the right atrium generally is considered to be a single static locus within the sinoatrial (SA) node. Previous investigators showed that the pacemaker site may shift due to changes in sympathetic or parasympathetic neural activity. We investigated the interactions between sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on the site of impulse initiation in the right atrium in anesthetized dogs.", 
    "13": "We determined the site of impulse initiation and the spread of excitation over the anterior and posterior regions of the right atrium by a matrix of 48 unipolar recording electrodes. We assessed the spread of excitation at 3-msec intervals by constructing isochronal activation sequence maps. Sympathetic stimulation increased the frequency of atrial excitation (i.e., the heart rate), but also shifted the earliest activation region (EAR) from a locus in the SA node to a locus in the superior vena cava (the superior pacemaker site). Vagus stimulation decreased the heart rate and shifted the EAR to a lower site in the SA node or a site in the inferior right atrium along the sulcus terminalis (the inferior pacemaker site). A short period of vagus stimulation during a more prolonged sympathetic stimulation elicited a larger decrease in rate than did vagus stimulation alone and shifted the EAR from the superior site to the SA node or to the inferior site. After atropine, combined stimulation shifted the EAR to the superior site, but propranolol did not change EAR location.",

All subjects had hypodynamic circulatory shock (hypotension, bradycardia, and acidosis) that was not adequately responsive to conventional treatment. After initiation of insulin-dextrose infusion, the hemodynamic status of all 5 patients stabilized and all patients survived. Plasma drug concentrations are reported for all cases and verapamil levels were extremely high in 2 patients (3710 ng/mL and 3980 ng/mL). However, because patients were not treated according to a standard protocol, each patient received variable other supportive measures and inotropic agents, and the infusion rates of insulin were variable among patients. This report provides preliminary evidence toward a larger trial of insulin-dextrose to treat hypodynamic shock from calcium channel blocker overdose.", 
    "23": "In vivo chronoamperometry was used to determine the effects of locally applied antagonists of the serotonin-1B (5-HT1B) receptor (cyanopindolol, 5-HT-moduline and methiothepin) on the clearance of 5-HT in the CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus and the corpus callosum (a brain region devoid of serotonin transporters and 5-HT1B receptors) of the rat. When 5-HT was pressure ejected into these regions, reproducible signals were detected. In the CA3 region, local application of 5-HT1B antagonists decreased the rate of clearance of the serotonin signal comparably to the selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluvoxamine. By contrast, in the corpus callosum, none of the drugs altered the 5-HT signal. One interpretation of these data is that 5-HT1B receptors can modulate the activity of the 5-HT transporter.",

This action was specific inasmuch as serotonin (5-HT) levels were not significantly modified. In contrast, (-)-propranolol (2.5) did not modify FCX dialysate levels of DA, NA (or 5-HT) alone and abolished the facilitatory influence of (-)-pindolol (10.0) upon levels of DA, though not NA. In contrast to (-)-propranolol, (-)-pindolol exerts, a facilitatory influence upon frontocortical dopaminergic and adrenergic, but not serotonergic, transmission.", 
    "25": "A young man had an impending acute myocardial infarction while playing soccer. Chest pain and anterior ST-segment elevation lasted 3 hours despite anti-ischemic medication, including streptokinase thrombolysis. An electrocardiogram recorded after the symptoms had passed was normal. There was a minimal increase in cardiac enzyme levels, and a pyrophosphate scan and echocardiogram were normal. Coronary cineangiography showed normal coronary arteries except for systolic compression of the left anterior descending coronary artery. An exercise stress test, while the patient was on atenolol, showed absence of myocardial ischemia. This impending acute myocardial infarction could have been caused by an acute thrombus with lysis prior to catheterization or by a deep muscle bridge that kinked or twisted the coronary artery due to myocardial forceful muscular contraction during the sympathetic stimulation of exercise. In conclusion, an impending acute myocardial infarction may occur in young patients having myocardial bridges, and a beta-blocker must be administered, especially when this condition appears during severe exercise.", 
    "26": "The minimal important difference (MID) is the smallest benefit of treatment that would result in clinicians recommending it to their patients. The MID is necessary to calculate sample size for randomized clinical trials, but its chosen value is often arbitrary. This study set out to determine the practicability of surveying physicians to elicit the MID for clinical trial sample-size calculation. Using a mail survey, we elicited the MID of different physician specialties (family medicine, internal medicine, vascular surgery) for using propranolol to slow abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth assuming that propranolol was efficacious in this condition. We used different outcome measures (growth rate or proportion of patients requiring surgery) and different methods of data presentation for the proportion of patients requiring surgery (absolute risk reduction or number needed to treat). The MID varied significantly by physician specialty, experience with AAA and propranolol, and the method used to elicit the MID. Consequently, sample-size calculations using these various MIDs varied from 116 to 3015. Future attempts to elicit the MID need to consider carefully who is surveyed, how data are presented, and how opinions are elicited.",

    "30": "The primary adverse effect of stimulation of beta2-adrenergic receptors is elicitation of tremor. Tremor measurements in response to beta2-adrenergic receptor stimulation were performed in a quantitative manner using a modified miniature semiconductor accelerometer in African green monkeys. The accelerometer was taped to the middle finger tip of anesthetized monkeys, and recordings of onset, duration and peak tremor responses were obtained. The selective beta2-adrenergic agonist, salbutamol (0.5 mg/kg i.v.), caused a marked increase in tremor which started within 5 min following injection and lasted for approximately 60 min. The finger tremor response was not visible, but was measurable by the accelerometer, and the increase in tremor was significantly greater from baseline within 10 min. Plasma K+ concentrations were markedly decreased within the first 15 min and remained at low steady-state concentrations during the 60-min recordings. The tremor response was abolished by the selective beta2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, ICI-118551 (0.2 mg/kg). ICI-118551 caused a significant reversal of the plasma K+ decrease but the K+ levels remained higher than control levels. These studies demonstrate that stimulation of beta2-adrenergic receptors causes tremor, most likely from entry of K+ into skeletal muscle and that there is a direct correlation between tremor and hypokalemic response.", 
    "31": "Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is a common clinical manifestation of asthma, occurring in 70% to 80% of asthmatics. Evidence suggests that exercise and the ensuing bronchoconstriction do not contribute to a worsening of asthmatic inflammation. Asthmatics should not be discouraged from exercising, and, with adequate management, most patients should be able to exercise regularly with only minor symptoms. The first step in the management of patients with EIB should be to obtain optimum control of the underlying asthma, often requiring regular treatment with inhaled steroids. Regular treatment with inhaled corticosteroids usually reduces the extent of EIB by 50% or more. Frequently, despite optimal management of the underlying asthma, patients develop EIB symptoms requiring additional treatment. Short and long acting inhaled beta2-agonists are highly effective at reducing the magnitude of EIB, although there are concerns that the extent of protection diminishes during periods of regular use of these agents. Inhaled cromolyn and nedocromyl are effective at reducing the extent of EIB in some patients, although this protection does not extend beyond 2 to 3 h after treatment. The recently developed leukotriene receptor antagonists are effective at reducing the extent of EIB by 40% to 70%, and have the advantage that this protection lasts throughout the day and does not appear to diminish with regular use. Other agents, including anticholinergics and antihistamines, have been shown to offer partial protection against EIB, suggesting the possibility of using a combination treatment to manage some patients' symptoms. Finally, there is encouraging evidence suggesting that modifications of the pattern of exercise can markedly reduce the extent of EIB.", 
    "32": "There have been no reports to date on long-term betaxolol instillation effects on the human optic nerve head (ONH) tissue circulation. The purpose of this study was to study the effect of topical 0.5% betaxolol on tissue blood velocity in the human ONH. Using a laser-speckle tissue blood flow analyzer, normalized blur (NB; a quantitative index of tissue blood velocity) was measured every 0.125 seconds at a temporal ONH site free of visible surface vessels. Measurements were averaged for 3 cardiac cycles (NB(ONH)). For baseline comparison (day 0), recordings of bilateral NB(ONH) and intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (PR) were recorded in healthy volunteers before, and 2, 4.5, and 7 hr after, instillation of 30 microL of betaxolol vehicle, and again on day 21; IOP was also recorded on days 7 and 14. On day 1 (the day after baseline measurements), and twice daily for 3 weeks, 30 microL of 0.5% betaxolol into one eye and 30 microL vehicle was instilled into the other in a double-blind study. Measurements as on day 0 were again recorded on day 21; IOP was also recorded on days 7 and 14. During baseline recordings, no significant changes were noted in any parameters. After administration of topical betaxolol, IOP was significantly reduced, bilaterally, with greater reduction in the betaxolol-treated eyes on day 21. Also on day 21, the NB(ONH) of the betaxolol-treated eyes was significantly higher 4.5 hr after instillation than that of the comparable baseline recording (p = 0.035 with Bonferroni's correction); BP, PR, and NB(ONH) in the eye which received only the vehicle showed little change. Tissue blood velocity in the human ONH was increased at least temporarily by instillation of topical betaxolol twice daily for 3 weeks. Although the obtained increase is small and may be clinically insignificant, the potential of betaxolol that can affect the ONH tissue circulation in humans after 21 days of instillation is thought to deserve further investigation.", 
    "33": "Views are surveyed on the role of nitrogen oxide in the pathogenesis of migraine attacks. There is some evidence that molecule plays an important role in these attacks through vasodilation in the central nervous system. In the process of nitrogen oxide release glutaminergic receptors of NMDA type participate modulating the activity of serotoninergic receptors. Increased synthesis of nitrogen oxide can follow spreading cortical ischaemia, histamine release from mast cells in the meninges and also through activation of the trigeminovascular system. The hypothesis of active role of NO in the pathogenesis of migraine attacks is supported by the analysis of the mechanism of action of drugs effective in the treatment of that disease.", 
    "34": "Isolated pancreatic beta-cells respond to glucose stimulation with increase of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in terms of membrane-derived slow oscillations (0.2-0.5/min) with superimposed transient of intracellular origin. To evaluate under which conditions transients may result also from entry of extracellular Ca2+, the cytoplasmic concentration of the ion was measured with dual wavelength fluorometry and fura-2 in individual mouse beta-cells exposed to the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA). In the presence of 20 mM TEA, the beta-cells responded to closure of the KATP channels (increase of the glucose concentration to 11 mM or addition of 1 mM tolbutamide) with pronounced transients of [Ca2+]i. However, there were no transients when the beta-cells were depolarized by raising extracellular K+ to 30 mM in the presence of 20 mM TEA. The glucose-induced [Ca2+]i transients became more pronounced after thapsigargin inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase. The tolbutamide-induced transients were amplified when promoting the entry of Ca2+ (rise of extracellular Ca2+ to 10 mM or addition of BAY K 8644), unaffected in the presence of thapsigargin and the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin and slightly reduced by glucagon. Blockage of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels with methoxyverapamil resulted in a prompt disappearance of the transients induced by glucose or tolbutamide. The observations indicate that closure of the KATP channels can precipitate pronounced transients of [Ca2+]i when other K+ conductances are suppressed.", 
    "35": "Decreased night-time plasma levels of melatonin were recently reported in patients with coronary artery disease, and it was postulated that melatonin production may be impaired, due to a lack of synthesizing enzymes. However, since artefacts possibly influencing the release pattern were not taken into account, this interpretation was strongly criticized. We therefore carefully investigated night-time melatonin production in patients with coronary artery disease using an appropriate experimental approach. Furthermore, we examined the effect of beta-blockers, a frequently used drug in coronary artery disease therapy.", 
    "36": "Forty-eight male patients with angiographically documented severe coronary artery disease, 24 of them taking beta-blockers daily in therapeutic dosages, were included. Eighteen age-matched men, with no evidence of coronary sclerosis, served as controls. To determine melatonin production, 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) was measured radioimmunologically from overnight urine. Urinary aMT6s concentration was significantly decreased in patients, and beta-blocker treatment did not further suppress melatonin production.", 
    "37": "The data obtained using this investigative approach provide clearcut evidence that melatonin production in patients with coronary artery disease is decreased. Whether a decreased melatonin level may be a predisposing factor for coronary artery disease, or whether the occurrence of coronary artery disease decreases melatonin synthesis remains to be determined.", 
    "38": "Arginine-vasopressin fragment 4-9 (AVP4-9) has been demonstrated in animal studies to facilitate learning and memory. To clarify the mechanisms of this facilitation, we focused on the effects of AVP4-9 on rodent cholinergic systems. AVP4-9 (0.1 microM) enhanced the basal and the high-potassium-evoked acetylcholine (ACh) release from rat hippocampal slices (122.4 and 120.0% of control, respectively) in the presence of 1.3 mM calcium (physiological level) at 60 min after the incubation at 37 degrees C. The AVP4-9-stimulated basal ACh release was inhibited by a V1-selective antagonist ([(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid)1, O-methyl-Tyr2, Arg8] vasopressin), but not by a V2-selective antagonist ([adamantaneacetyl1, O-ethyl-D-Tyr2, Val4, aminobutyryl6, Arg8,9]-vasopressin). In addition, AVP4-9 did not affect the basal ACh release under the calcium-free condition at 37 degrees C or in the presence of 1.3 mM calcium at 4 degrees C. However, AVP4-9 facilitated the passive-avoidance response of scopolamine (a cholinergic blocker)-induced memory-deficient mice. These findings demonstrate that AVP4-9 stimulates ACh release via mediation by V1-like vasopressin receptors, and shows dependence on calcium ion and temperature. The results also suggest that the mechanism of the facilitative effects of AVP4-9 on learning and memory consist of the observed stimulation of cholinergic systems and other parallel pathways that would not be inhibited by cholinergic blocking.", 
    "39": "We previously suggested that the existence of atypical beta/beta3-adrenoceptor with pA2-values for bupranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, against BRL37344 and noradrenaline were 5.79 and 5.53 in guinea pig taenia caecum, respectively. We furthermore determined the affinity of bupranolol to subclassify atypical beta/beta3-adrenoceptor in rat oesophageal muscularis mucosae, because it is rich in atypical beta/beta3-adrenoceptor. BRL37344 and noradrenaline produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of rat oesophageal muscularis mucosae. The responses to BRL37344 and noradrenaline were resistant to 3x10(-6) M propranolol, 10(-4) M atenolol, and 10(-4) M butoxamine. However, bupranolol antagonized the responses to BRL37344 and noradrenaline in a concentration-dependent manner. Schild plot analyses of bupranolol against BRL37344 and noradrenaline gave pA2-values of 7.06 and 6.96, respectively. These results suggest that bupranolol can distinguish the difference in affinity between atypical beta/beta3-adrenoceptors in rat oesophageal muscularis mucosae and guinea pig taenia caecum. The difference in behavior of bupranolol confirms the existence of some atypical beta/beta3-adrenoceptors subtypes.",

The introduction of Doppler ultrasound provided a powerful tool to investigate such hemodynamic effects and brought new insights in this field. The present article reviews the pharmacodynamics of the substances used in the treatment of portal hypertension, with particular regard to the effects assessable by duplex Doppler ultrasonography.", 
    "41": "Upon characterization of baculovirus-expressed cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2C19, it was observed that this enzyme metabolized (+/-) bufuralol to 1'hydroxybufuralol, a reaction previously understood to be selectively catalyzed by CYP2D6. The apparent K(m) for this reaction was 36 microM with recombinant CYP2C19, approximately 7-fold higher than for recombinant CYP2D6. The intrinsic clearance for this reaction was 37-fold higher with CYP2D6 than for CYP2C19. The involvement of human CYP1A2 in bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation was also confirmed using the recombinant enzyme. Using S-mephenytoin as an inhibitor, the K(i) for inhibition of recombinant CYP2C19-mediated bufuralol hydroxylation was 42 microM, which is the approximate K(m) for recombinant CYP2C19-mediated S-mephenytoin metabolism. The classic CYP2D6 inhibitors quinidine and quinine showed no inhibition of CYP2C19-catalyzed bufuralol metabolism at concentrations that abolished CYP2D6-mediated bufuralol metabolism. Ticlopidine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, inhibited bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation by each of these enzymes equipotently. In human liver microsomes that are known to be deficient in CYP2D6 activity, it was shown that in the presence of quinidine, the K(m) shifted from 14 to 38 microM. This is consistent with the K(m) determination for recombinant CYP2C19 of 36 microM. In human liver microsomes that have high CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 activity, the K(m) shifted to 145 microM in the presence of S-mephenytoin and quinidine, consistent with the K(m) determined for CYP1A2. This data suggests that bufuralol, and possibly other CYP2D6 substrates, have the potential to be metabolized by CYP2C19.", 
    "42": "An overdose of propranolol, a widely used nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, can result in hypotension and bradycardia leading to irreversible shock and death. In addition, the blockade of adrenergic receptors can lead to alterations in neurotransmitter receptors resulting in the interruption of the activity of other second messengers and the ultimate cellular responses. In the present experiment, three agents, aminophylline, amrinone, and forskolin were tested in an attempt to reverse the potential lethal effects of a propranolol overdose in dogs. Twenty-two anesthetized beagle dogs were given a 10-min infusion of propranolol at a dose of 1 mg/kg/min. Six of the dogs, treated only with intravenous saline, served as controls. Within 15-30 min all six control dogs exhibited profound hypotension and severe bradycardia that led to cardiogenic shock and death. Seven dogs were treated with intravenous aminophylline 20 mg/kg 5 min after the end of the propranolol infusion. Within 10-15 min heart rate and systemic arterial blood pressure returned to near control levels, and all seven dogs survived. Intravenous amrinone (2-3 mg/kg) given to five dogs, and forskolin (1-2 mg/kg) given to four dogs, also increased heart rate and systemic arterial blood pressure but the recovery of these parameters was appreciably slower than that seen with aminophylline. All of these animals also survived with no apparent adverse effects. Histopathologic evaluation of the hearts of the dogs treated with aminophylline showed less damage (vacuolization, inflammation, hemorrhage) than the hearts from animals given propranolol alone. Results of this study showed that these three drugs, all of which increase cyclic AMP, are capable of reversing the otherwise lethal effects of a propranolol overdose in dogs.",

Left-ventricular failure was the strongest independent predictor of death within 1 year of infarction with a hazard ratio of 4.76 (3.53-6.43), adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, and Q wave infarction. Patients aged 70 years or older without left-ventricular failure had significantly better survival at 1 year after acute myocardial infarction than patients under 60 years with left-ventricular failure. 70.8% (62.2-78.2) of the older patients who survived to hospital discharge were still alive 3 years later.",

    "54": "Phenylephrine dose-dependently contracted ciliary artery smooth muscle, and bunazosin (1 microM) shifted this dose-response curve to the right. Isoproterenol, on the other hand, had no effect up to the concentration of 1 mM. Betaxolol and timolol had no effect on the ciliary artery. However, carteolol dose-dependently contracted this muscle from a concentration of 1 microM. After precontraction by excess-[K]0 solutions, application of betaxolol or timolol dose-dependently provoked relaxation; the minimum concentration of betaxolol or timolol required to generate the relaxation was 100 microM and 300 microM, respectively. Carteolol did not generate relaxation at concentrations up to 1 mM. After pretreatment with L-NAME (300 microM), the amplitude of relaxation induced by 10 microM carbachol was reduced to 33.0+/-20.2%, while betaxolol- or timolol-induced relaxation was unchanged. Diltiazem (10 microM) induced relaxation which was not inhibited by pretreatment with L-NAME.",

    "56": "SCD continues to be an important cause of death and morbidity. Despite expanding insight into the mechanisms causing SCD, the population at high risk is not being effectively identified. Although there is still much to do in the management phase of SCD (predicting the efficacy of various therapies), recent clinical trials have helped define the relative risks and benefits of therapies in preventing SCD. Trials are underway to determine whether treating other patient populations, including asymptomatic patients after MI, will improve survival rate. The approach to reducing mortality rate will always be multifaceted; primary prevention of coronary artery disease and prompt salvage of jeopardized myocardium are 2 important aspects of this approach. In addition to interventions for MI, such as myocardial revascularization when indicated, simple and easily administered therapies that are likely to remain the most effective prophylactic interventions are aspirin, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and cholesterol-lowering agents. However, the MADIT and AVID data clearly demonstrate a role for ICD therapy in a subgroup of patients who have VT/VF and are at risk of cardiac arrest. Even though the absolute magnitude of benefit associated with ICDs is still to be determined, the AVID study and other recent reports provide convincing evidence that patients who have VT/VF fare better with ICDs than with antiarrhythmic drug therapy. For the high-risk population described in this article, in addition to aggressive anti-ischemic and heart failure therapy, ICDs are now a mainstay of life-saving treatment. Still to be surmounted is the challenge of identifying patients who have nonischemic substrates and of providing them with the appropriate therapy. Guided by genetic studies and new insight into the mechanisms of such problems as congenital long QT syndrome, life-saving and life-enhancing therapies may soon be available for the management of SCD.", 
    "57": "Using receptor autoradiography we examined the displacement of the binding of [(3)H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and [(3)H][N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridyl)cy clohexanecarboxamide. 3HCl] (WAY 100635) to 5-HT(1A) receptors by (-)pindolol in the brain of four different species, rat, guinea pig, monkey and human. (-)Pindolol completely displaced the binding of both tritiated ligands at 10(-6) M in all species and regions examined. The affinity of (-)pindolol for presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus was similar to that observed in postsynaptic locations, such as hippocampus (areas CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus) or entorhinal cortex. Affinity values (K(i)) were in the range 3.8 - 15.9 nM for [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT and 5.8 - 22.3 nM for [(3)H]WAY 100635. In human brain, the K(i) values using [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT as ligand were 10.8 nM in the dorsal raphe nucleus and 6.5 - 13.5 in postsynaptic sites. The present data do not support the hypothesis that (-)pindolol may displace 5-HT(1A) ligands preferentially from presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus, as suggested by electrophysiological evidence. The affinity of (-)pindolol for human 5-HT(1A) receptors is below the mean plasma concentration attained in depressed patients treated with a combination of fluoxetine and pindolol, which indirectly supports an action of pindolol at 5-HT(1A) receptors in these patients.", 
    "58": "We have previously shown that norepinephrine (NE) inhibits the in vitro generation of anti-MOPC-315 CTL activity by spleen cells from BALB/c mice rejecting a large MOPC-315 tumor as a consequence of low-dose melphalan (l -phenylalanine mustard (l -PAM)) treatment (l -PAM TuB spleen cells). Since TNF-alpha plays a key role in the generation of antitumor CTL activity in this system, we determined whether NE mediates this inhibition through inhibition of TNF-alpha production. Here, we show that NE inhibits the production of TNF-alpha protein and mRNA by l -PAM TuB spleen cells stimulated in vitro with mitomycin C-treated tumor cells. Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular expression of TNF-alpha revealed substantial NE-mediated decreases in the percentages of TNF-alpha+ cells among CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and F4/80+ activated macrophages. NE inhibition of CTL generation was largely overcome by addition of TNF-alpha to the stimulation cultures. When the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol was added to the stimulation cultures of l -PAM TuB spleen cells at a concentration that prevented NE-induced cAMP elevation, the NE-mediated decrease in TNF-alpha mRNA and NE-mediated inhibition of CTL generation were reversed. Collectively, these results suggest that NE inhibits antitumor CTL generation, at least in part, by inhibiting TNF-alpha synthesis through a mechanism(s) involving beta-adrenergic receptor signaling.", 
    "59": "This study was undertaken to examine the cardiovascular effects of nociceptin/Orphanin FQ (OFQ). Nociceptin/OFQ (10-300 nmol/kg, IV) stimulates an increase in mean blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) in chronically catheterized sheep. Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine (5 mg/kg) attenuated the pressor response, consistent with sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction. Furthermore, the lack of a reflex bradycardia suggests either blunting of the baroreflex by nociceptin/OFQ or direct beta-adrenergic activation. The bradycardic response to norepinephrine (0.6 microg/kg, IV) remained intact after nociceptin/OFQ administration, demonstrating that nociceptin/OFQ does not blunt the baroreflex. Additionally, the increase in HR was completely reversed by pretreatment with propranolol. These data suggest that nociceptin/OFQ plays a role in cardiovascular regulation via sympathetic activation.", 
    "60": "Changes in heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure were measured after extubation in 60 ASA Grade I and II patients to assess the effects of diltiazem (0.2 mg kg-1), verapamil (0.05 mg kg-1) and metoprolol (0.02 mg kg-1) given as a bolus 2 min before tracheal extubation. All the haemodynamic variables measured increased significantly after extubation in the control and diltiazem groups when compared with the base-line recordings (P < 0.05). Metoprolol effectively blocked the increases in heart rate after extubation and the increase in blood pressure in this group was less when compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Verapamil alleviated the increase in both heart rate and blood pressure. However, profound hypotension and bradycardia requiring therapy, occurred in the verapamil group. For this reason, careful observation is necessary when using verapamil and the routine use of this drug in patients with coronary artery disease requires further studies.", 
    "61": "A 26-year old woman, who experienced syncope associated with advanced AV block, was referred for further evaluation. Electrophysiological study showed normal SA and AV node physiology. Syncope associated with advanced AV block on the electrocardiogram was induced by head-up tilt test. Oral propranolol therapy completely prevented the AV block and syncope induced by head-up tilt. The physician should be aware of advanced AV block associated with neurocardiogenic syncope, especially before permanent - pacemaker therapy is considered. The head-up tilt test is a useful diagnostic tool for an etiology of paroxysmal AV block.", 
    "62": "Our objective was to evaluate the effects of beta-blockers on the neurohormonal profile, particularly vasopressin (VP) release, in vasovagal syncope and to gain further insight on the pathophysiology of this syndrome. Patients (< or =75 years) with no cardiovascular, neurological disorders, or contraindications to the use of isoproterenol or beta-blockers and being explored for unexplained syncope were included. An 80 degrees HUT was performed under identical conditions. After a 25-min period of passive tilt, isoproterenol was infused at a rate of 1-5 microg/mn if required. Two groups matched for age and sex were considered: a HUT-positive and a HUT-negative group. The HUT-positive group was then given beta-blockers, subsequently reassessed, and divided into two subgroups: alpha beta-blocker nonresponder group and a beta-blocker responder group. Blood samples for assays of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and VP were taken at baseline and the end of the procedure. In all, 44 subjects entered the study, 22 in each group. The HUT-positive group exhibited an obvious lesser increase in plasma NE and a clear-cut rise in plasma E and VP compared to the HUT-negative group (P < 0.05). Even though no patient in the HUT-positive group reported recurrent symptoms under treatment, the second HUT could distinguish two subgroups: a beta-blocker nonresponder group (n = 12) whose HUT remained positive and a beta-blocker responder group (n = 10) whose HUT was normalized. The time course of plasma E and VP during the second HUT was similar to that for the HUT-positive and HUT-negative groups. In conclusion, the efficacy of beta-blockers is associated not only with a reduction of the sympathoadrenal stimulation seen in vasovagal syncope but also with a lower release of VP suggesting that low-pressure baroreceptors might be involved in VP release.",

Administration of (+)-pindolol (1 and 10 mg/kg, s.c.) decreased neuronal activity and increased 5-HT levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The subsequent administration of WAY-100635 [N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cycloh exanecarboxamide] (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.), a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, blocked pindolol-induced neuronal suppression and potentiated 5-HT output.

    "64": "1. Phencyclidine (PCP) is an inhibitor of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) with characteristics of an open-channel blocker. The location of PCP binding site on the AChR molecule is unknown. 2. PCP inhibits the AChR from electric organ with a higher potency than muscle AChR. To find the molecular basis of this difference, we expressed the two native and six hybrid receptors, and two receptors containing mutated mouse gamma subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The inhibition of ACh-induced current in these receptors by PCP was studied using whole-cell voltage-clamp. All hybrid receptors generated robust ACh-induced currents, while incomplete receptors (gamma-less or delta-less) did not. 3. PCP potency was higher on hybrids containing Torpedo beta and gamma subunits regardless of the alpha and delta subunit origin. A mouse gamma subunit containing the asparagine 6' to the serine mutation in the M2 segment conferred a high sensitivity to PCP. 4. These results support the conclusion that the amino acid residues at the position 6' of the M2 segments contribute to the PCP potency difference between Torpedo and mouse receptors. 5. Another noncompetitive inhibitor of the AChR, the cembranoid eupalmerin acetate (EUAC), also inhibited the electric organ receptor with a somewhat higher potency than muscle AChR. However, the IC50 values for EUAC inhibition of hybrid receptors did not follow the pattern observed for PCP. Therefore, these two inhibitors interact differently with the AChR molecule.",

The results would indicate that isoproterenol-induced vasodilation in the perfused rabbit (oestrus or pregnant) uterine vascular bed was mediated by atypical beta-adrenoceptors which may not be identical with those in adipose tissues or gastro-intestinal tract. In addition, the fact that pregnancy did not enhance isoprenaline-induced vasodilation would suggest that these receptors may not be involved in the hyperaemia of pregnancy.",

After pretreatment, glucose, glucagon and insulin infusions were repeated in the alpha-blocked and beta-blocked toads, respectively. Group 13 was infused with 0.7% saline and served as the control. The results showed that infusions of adrenaline, glucose and glucagon resulted in significant hyperglycaemia while insulin caused hypoglycaemia. The hyperglycaemic response to glucose was dose-dependent. The experiments using blockers showed that the glycaemic effects of glucagon and insulin are mediated via beta adrenoceptors, that for glucose is via alpha adrenoceptors and from an earlier study, the glycaemic response of adrenaline is through both alpha and beta adrenoceptors.",

    "78": "1. Experimental hypertension is associated with several functional alterations of vascular endothelium and smooth muscle, but relatively few studies have examined the control of arterial tone in isolated vascular preparations from patients with essential hypertension. Therefore, we compared functional characteristics in vitro of distal ring segments of the mesenteric artery from 17 hypertensive and 22 normotensive humans. 2. Arterial constrictor responses induced by cumulative addition of Ca(2+) in the presence of noradrenaline (NA) were more effectively inhibited by the Ca(2+) entry blocker nifedipine (0.5 nM) in hypertensive than normotensive subjects (by 55.4+/-4.9, n=17 and 35.0+/(-5.2%), n=22, respectively). Also the contractions elicited by high concentrations of KCl were more effectively inhibited by nifedipine in arterial rings from hypertensive than normotensive patients (by 38.9+/(-3.7), n=17 and 20. 2+/(-4.6%), n=22, respectively). However, the concentration-response curves of contractions to NA, serotonin and KCl in the absence of nifedipine were similar between the study groups. 3. The concentration-response curves of endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine and Ca(2+) ionophore A23187, as well as of endothelium-independent relaxations to the nitric oxide donor nitroprusside, beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline and K+ channel opener cromakalim did not show any differences between the groups. Moreover, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (0.1 mM) almost abolished the relaxations to acetylcholine and Ca(2+) ionophore in both groups, indicating that these responses were largely mediated by nitric oxide. The function of arterial sodium pump was evaluated by relaxations elicited by the return of K+ upon contractions induced by K+-free solution. The rate of K+-relaxation was similar in hypertensive and normotensive arteries (for all these responses n=20 - 22 in the normotensive and 15 - 17 in the hypertensive group). 4. These results suggest abnormal function of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels in arterial smooth muscle of hypertensive patients, whereas vascular responses to endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilators and classical contractile agents were similar between hypertensive and normotensive subjects. The present findings support the view that blockade of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels is an effective means of reducing arterial tone in essential hypertension.",

The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects and whether these effects are generalizable to ischaemic heart failure are unresolved. 2. We performed echocardiographic-Doppler examinations in rats (n=28) 1 and 6 weeks after myocardial infarction (MI) or sham surgery. Rats were randomized to no treatment or propranolol (500 mg/l in drinking water) after the first echocardiogram. Isometric contractions and intracellular Ca transients were recorded simultaneously in noninfarcted left ventricular (LV) papillary muscles. 3. Untreated MI rats had significant LV dilatation (10.6+/-0.4* vs 8.9+/(-0.3) mm, MI vs control), impaired systolic function (fractional shortening=11+/-2* vs 38+/-2%), and a restrictive LV diastolic filling pattern. MI rats receiving propranolol had similar LV chamber sizes (10.6+/(-0.5) mm) and systolic function (13+/(-2%). The propranolol treated animals had higher LV end-diastolic pressures (27+/-2* vs 20+/(-3 mmHg) and a more restricted LV diastolic filling pattern (increased ratio of early to late filling velocities and more rapid E wave deceleration rate). Contractility of papillary muscles from untreated MI rats was depressed (1.6+/(-0.3) vs 2.4+/(0.5 g mm(-2). In addition, Ca transients were prolonged and the inotropic response to isoproterenol was blunted. Propranolol treatment did not improve force development (1.6+/(-0.3 g mm(-2) or the duration of Ca transients during isoproterenol stimulation. 4. Chronic propranolol treatment in rats with postinfarction heart failure did not improve LV remodeling or systolic function. LV diastolic pressures and filling patterns were worsened by propranolol. Treatment also did not produce appreciable improvement in contractility, intracellular Ca regulation or beta-adrenergic responsiveness in the noninfarcted myocardium.", 
    "80": "1. 111In-labelled platelets were monitored continuously in the cerebral and pulmonary vascular beds of anaesthetized rabbits. Dopamine can, depending upon the concentration, either potentiate or inhibit thrombin-induced platelet accumulation in the cerebral vasculature of rabbits by unknown mechanisms. The effects of specific adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor antagonists were tested upon dopamine's actions on intracarotid (i.c.) thrombin-induced (80 u kg-1) platelet accumulation in the cerebral vasculature. The effect of adrenaline on the response to thrombin in this vascular bed was also investigated. 2. Thrombin-induced platelet accumulation was significantly (P<0.01) potentiated by dopamine (100 microgkg-1 min-1, i.c.) and this effect was significantly inhibited by infusion of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine. 3 A higher dose of dopamine (2 mg kg-1 min-1, i.c.) inhibited thrombin-induced platelet accumulation. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, did not significantly alter this inhibitory effect whereas it was abolished by the dopamine D1 selective antagonist, SCH23390. 4 Adrenaline (when administered i.c. by bolus injection or infusion) had no significant effect on thrombin-induced accumulation at any of the doses tested. 5 Potentiation of in vivo platelet accumulation by dopamine therefore seems to occur via alpha-adrenergic receptors. However, the inhibitory effect of dopamine appears to be exerted via the activation of dopamine D1 receptors and not via beta-adrenergic receptors. Our findings confirm that dopamine, but not adrenaline, can modify platelet function in the cerebral vasculature and these observations may have implications for current and potential therapeutic uses of dopamine and selective dopaminergic compounds.", 
    "81": "We show that a portion of the TM2 domain regulates the sensitivity of beta subunit-containing rat neuronal nicotinic AChR to the ganglionic blocker mecamylamine, such that the substitution of 4 amino acids of the muscle beta subunit sequence into the neuronal beta4 sequence decreases the potency of mecamylamine by a factor of 200 and eliminates any long-term effects of this drug on receptor function. The same exchange of sequence that decreases inhibition by mecamylamine produces a comparable potentiation of long-term inhibition by nicotine. Inhibition by mecamylamine is voltage-dependent, suggesting a direct interaction of mecamylamine with sequence elements within the membrane field. We have previously shown that sensitivity to TMP (tetramethylpiperidine) inhibitors is controlled by the same sequence elements that determine mecamylamine sensitivity. However, inhibition by bis-TMP compounds is independent of voltage. Our experiments did not show any influence of voltage on the inhibition of chimeric receptors by nicotine, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of nicotine are mediated by binding to a site outside the membrane's electric field. An analysis of point mutations indicates that the residues at the 6' position within the beta subunit TM2 domain may be important for determining the effects of both mecamylamine and nicotine in a reciprocal manner. Single mutations at the 10' position are not sufficient to produce effects, but 6' 10' double mutants show more effect than do the 6' single mutants.", 
    "82": "In this study, we investigate whether chronic treatment with beta-adrenoceptor (betaAR) ligands with inverse agonist activity enhances myocardial beta2AR-mediated atrial tension more than neutral antagonists in transgenic mice (TG35). These mice exhibit chronic adrenoceptor activation because they possess a greater number of constitutively active receptors than wild type mice due to cardiac-specific overexpression of human betaARs. TG35 and wild type mice were chronically treated for 90 h with three inverse agonists, ICI-118,551, propranolol, and carvedilol, and one neutral antagonist, alprenolol. After 96 h, we compared the basal and isoprenaline-stimulated (10 microM) increase in atrial tension in treated or untreated TG35 mice and wild type mice. In parallel, to determine the effect of chronic betaAR ligand treatment on the amounts of G protein receptor kinase-2 (GRK-2) and G proteins, we performed Western blotting on myocardial cytosolic and membrane proteins. Atria from the TG35 mice treated with inverse agonists showed increases in the baseline tension compared to those from alprenolol/vehicle-treated mice. ICI-118,551 and propranolol treatment restored the elevated myocardial G-inhibitory protein (Gialpha) levels to that of wild type. Also, treatment with inverse agonists upregulated G-stimulatory protein (Gsalpha) levels and GRK2 above those levels in vehicle-treated TG35 or wild type mice. The increased baseline atrial tension was reversed by the addition of ICI-118,551. Overall, our data suggests that inverse agonists enhance baseline atrial tension more than neutral antagonists. Based on this, we propose that upregulation of the active conformation of the beta2ARs, Gsalpha protein and restoration of Gialpha as three possible mechanisms to explain this enhanced receptor activity. Therefore, the favourable effects of some ligands used in pathological conditions involving chronic adrenoceptor activation may be due to the inverse agonist activity of the ligand.", 
    "83": "Two patients with a novel variant of long QT syndrome are described. The clinical course was characterised by an in utero onset of ventricular tachycardia and atrioventricular block (at 26 and 30 weeks' gestational age, respectively), and an association with a ventricular septal defect. Studies of both patients' families identified relatives with prolonged QT interval, syncope, or sudden death. One patient died of intractable ventricular tachycardia at 4 days old. The other received beta blocker treatment and a pacemaker. She died suddenly at the age of 10 months. The unique association with ventricular septal defect and the malignant clinical course warrants further molecular diagnosis of this novel variant of long QT syndrome.",

Fifty eight episodes of ERAF were observed. Five ERAF episodes (9%) had preceding bradycardia and 53 (91%) of these were triggered by atrial premature beats with normal preceding heart rate. Atrial premature beats that reinitiated atrial fibrillation had a shorter coupling interval (333 (43) ms v 396 (100), p < 0.001) and a lower prematurity index (0.44 (0.11) v 0. 55 (0.14), p < 0.001) than those that did not reinitiate atrial fibrillation. Repeated shock delivery and increasing the defibrillation energy did not prevent ERAF.

In 22 patients (group II) sustained ventricular tachycardia remained inducible during D,L-sotalol treatment. The ventricular tachycardia rate was slowed in eight patients and unchanged or accelerated in 14. At baseline, heart rate variability was similar in both groups. During treatment with D,L-sotalol, variables reflecting parasympathetic activity (pNN50, rMSSD, and high frequency amplitude (HF)) increased in both groups: HF increased from (mean (SD)) 75 (68) to 146 (134) in group I (p < 0.05) and from 60 (49) to 125 (79) in group II (p < 0.05). Other variables were unchanged in group I. In group II, the variables associated with sympathetic activity (coefficient of variance (CV), ratio of low frequency amplitude (LF) to HF) decreased significantly: CV decreased from 13 (4) to 9 (2) (p < 0. 001) and LF/HF from 4.74 (3.02) to 3.00 (2.02) (p < 0.05).",

    "95": "The relationship between rat beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors (ARs) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) responses was examined by inducible expression of each subtype in transfected GH(3) pituitary cells. Increasing expression of beta(1)- or beta(2)-ARs in stably transfected subclones increased basal cAMP, increased the potency of isoproterenol in stimulating cAMP formation, but did not change the maximal response. A linear relationship was observed between log B(max) and -log EC(50) for isoproterenol, with no significant differences between beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs. When both subtypes were coexpressed at different densities and ratios, pharmacological analysis showed that both selective and nonselective agonists exerted their effects at least partially through both subtypes. Either subtype alone activated a maximal response when the other subtype was blocked, indicating a complete redundancy in coupling. Agonists could activate responses through either subtype, with responses mediated primarily through the subtype where the agonist was most potent. The nonselective agonist isoproterenol had similar potencies for activating both subtypes; however, the density and ratio of subtypes affected the relative potencies of the selective agonists norepinephrine and zinterol. We conclude that beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs have similar coupling efficiencies in GH(3) cells, these efficiencies are not altered by coexpression of another subtype, they couple redundantly to cAMP formation, and the relative densities of beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs control the potencies of selective agonists.", 
    "96": "We previously reported that increased apoptosis participates in the regression of aortic hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats. To further document the potential role of apoptosis in cardiovascular therapy, we examined apoptosis during regression of hypertrophy in the heart of spontaneously hypertensive rats receiving the antihypertensive drug enalapril (30 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), losartan (30 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), nifedipine (35 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), hydralazine (40 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), propranolol (50 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), or hydrochlorothiazide (75 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) for 1 to 4 weeks, starting at 10 to 11 weeks of age. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured by the tail-cuff method. Markers of apoptosis included oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in extracted cardiac DNA or in situ in ventricular cross sections labeled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Cardiac DNA synthesis was evaluated by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation in vivo. All drugs reduced cardiac workload, defined as the product of blood pressure and heart rate, by >20% at 4 weeks. However, only nifedipine, enalapril, losartan, and propranolol reduced cardiac mass (>19%) within 4 weeks. Regression of cardiac hypertrophy was accompanied by a 50% to 300% increase in DNA fragmentation and a >20% reduction in DNA synthesis, resulting in a >20% reduction in cardiac DNA content after 4 weeks. Apoptosis induction occurred early and was transient within 4 weeks of nifedipine, enalapril, or losartan administration. With all regression-inducing drugs, the increase in DNA fragmentation occurred mainly in the subepicardium. Thus, transient induction of apoptosis in the subepicardium appears to be a characteristic feature of the early response to drug-induced regression of cardiac hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "97": "Stimulation of vascular beta-adrenoceptors leads to membrane hyperpolarization, presumably via the beta-adrenoceptor/G(s) protein/adenylate cyclase signaling cascade; the ionic mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unclear. beta-Adrenoceptor-mediated vascular relaxation is impaired with aging; however, little is known concerning whether beta-adrenoceptor-mediated hyperpolarization is altered with aging. We sought to determine the ionic mechanisms of isoproterenol-induced hyperpolarization in the rat mesenteric resistance artery, as well as the age-related changes in isoproterenol-induced hyperpolarization and their underlying mechanisms. Isoproterenol-induced hyperpolarization was inhibited by high-K(+) solution and glibenclamide (10(-6) mol/L), an inhibitor of ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (K(ATP)), but not by apamin, iberiotoxin, or charybdotoxin, inhibitors of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. Isoproterenol-induced hyperpolarization was markedly less in aged rats (>/=24 months) than in adults rats (12 to 20 weeks) (3x10(-6) mol/L; -3.1 versus -9.9 mV; P<0.001; n=8 to 9). Cholera toxin (10(-9) g/mL), an activator of G(s), evoked hyperpolarization only in adult rats. Hyperpolarization to forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, was also reduced to some extent in aged rats (10(-5) mol/L; -8.8 versus -13 mV; P<0.05; n=6), whereas hyperpolarization to levcromakalim, a K(ATP) opener, was comparable in both groups. These findings suggest that isoproterenol elicits hyperpolarization via an opening of K(ATP) in the rat resistance artery and that isoproterenol-induced hyperpolarization is attenuated in aged rats mainly because of a defective coupling of beta-adrenoceptors to adenylate cyclase and partly because of a defect at the level of adenylate cyclase, but not because of an alteration of K(ATP) per se.", 
    "98": "Palpitations are one of the most common reasons for referral to cardiologists; most are assessed as being medically benign. Eighty consecutive subjects referred for 24-hour ECG recording completed a questionnaire at the time of assessment and a follow-up self-report questionnaire at 18 months. Many of those with and without abnormal hearts reported distress, concern about their symptoms, and limitation of everyday activities. There were few differences between these groups at assessment or at follow-up. There was little change in mental state or in disability in either group over 18 months. Present symptomatic treatment is largely ineffective and there is a need to evaluate psychological and behavioral interventions.", 
    "99": "Cardioselective beta-blockers should be administered starting with a low dosage under direct medical observation. Bronchodilators should be readily available or may be coadministered. Because of several advantages, agents such as metoprolol, atenolol, and, in some cases, esmolol should be the first agents considered. In contrast to noncardioselective agents, if bronchospasm occurs, the effect of cardioselective agents is believed to be easier to reverse. Clinicians should avoid noncardioselective beta-blockers in asthmatics, even in small doses, such as those administered as eye drops. For asthmatic patients who are intolerant to noncardioselective beta-blockers, switching to a cardioselective beta-blocker might be a safe alternative. The significance of beta2-blockade usually varies with the patient's ventilatory condition, with more serious consequences being anticipated in patients with more severe asthma.", 
    "100": "It is now known that rapid placental and fetal development is associated with elevated levels of circulating high density lipoprotein (HDL) in pregnant women. The main structure implicated in the maternal-fetal exchange is the syncytiotrophoblast, composed of a brush border membrane (BBM), facing the mother, and a basal plasma membrane (BPM), facing the fetus. In order to understand the mechanisms controlling the placental and fetal supplies of cholesterol, we purified both BBM and BPM and verified the presence of HDL binding sites in these membranes. Binding studies using(125)I-HDL(3)show a single affinity binding site on BPM which has a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 3.45+/-0.43 microg protein/ml and a maximal binding capacity (B(max)) of 5.46+/-1.69 microg protein/mg membrane proteins. In BBM, we observed two affinity binding sites, one with a K(d)of 0.62+/-0.03 microg protein/ml and another one with a K(d)of 6.57+/-0.87 microg protein/ml. Their B(max)values were 0.54+/-0.11 and 2.34+/-0.39 microg of HDL(3)/mg membrane proteins, respectively. CLA-1, a putative HDL-receptor of 85 kDa, was detected on both BPM and BBM, together with two apo A-l binding sites of 110 and 96 kDa on BPM and BBM, respectively. These results provide further evidence that human placenta possesses specific sites for HDL binding, underlining the important role of maternal HDL in the transfer of cholesterol from the maternal circulation to the placenta and the fetus.",

Seven patients were excluded from analysis due to death before BTAI diagnosis (two deaths were from rupture in the emergency department and five were from massive blunt trauma without rupture).

There was a trend toward longer lengths of stay in the DR group. Most DR patients required beta-blocker therapy and/or other antihypertensives for systolic BP more than 120 mm Hg during admission. There were no deaths from aortic rupture in either group. By using financial data that was available from July of 1994 onward, we performed a subset analysis of the direct costs associated with BTAI.

    "113": "Heart rate (HR) is higher during dynamic arm exercise than during leg exercise at equal oxygen consumption levels, but the physiological background for this difference is not completely understood. The vagally mediated beat-to-beat R-R interval fluctuation decreases until the level of approximately 50% of maximal oxygen consumption during an incremental bicycle exercise, but the vagal responses to arm exercise are not well known. Changes in autonomic modulation of HR were compared during arm and leg exercise by measuring beat-to-beat R-R interval variability from a Poincar\u00e9 plot normalized for the average R-R interval (SD1n), a measure of vagal activity, in 14 healthy male subjects (age 20 +/- 4 years) who performed graded bicycle and arm cranking tests until exhaustion. Seven of the subjects also performed the dynamic arm and leg tests after beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol 0.2 mg kg-1 i.v.). More rapid reduction occurred in SD1n during the low-intensity level of dynamic arm exercise than during dynamic leg exercise without beta-blockade (e.g. 11 +/- 6 vs. 20 +/- 10 at the oxygen consumption level of 1.2 l min-1; P < 0.001) and with beta-blockade (e.g. 13 +/- 4 vs. 25 +/- 10 at the level of 1.0 l min-1; P < 0.05), and the mean HR was significantly higher during submaximal arm work than during leg work in both cases (e.g. during beta-blockade 81 +/- 12 vs. 74 +/- 6 beats min-1 at the level of 1.0 l min-1; P < 0.05). These data show that dynamic arm exercise results in more rapid withdrawal of vagal outflow than dynamic leg exercise.",

    "118": "The aims of the treatment of heart failure are to improve the quality of life and slow the progression of cardiac disease. Improvement of quality of life is best assessed by questionnaire; progression of the disease is assessed by measuring mortality and morbidity. The agenda for the future is to establish intermediate markers for progression of cardiac disease that can be substituted for morbidity and mortality, and thus improve the efficiency and shorten the follow-up of clinical trials. At present, polypharmacy is required to achieve optimal improvements in quality and duration of life. Furthermore, some drugs may favorably affect one end point and adversely affect the other; for example, beta-blockers may exert adverse short-term effects on quality of life but may slow progression of the disease. Certain inotropic drugs may reduce symptoms but shorten life expectancy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have exerted favorable effects on both quality of life and mortality, but the magnitude of these benefits has been disappointingly small. Persistent angiotensin-induced vasoconstriction and endocrine effects, despite ACE inhibition, is one possible explanation. The Valsartan in Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) has been designed to test the efficacy and safety of the AT(1) receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan in combination with ACE inhibitors and all other prescribed therapies in patients with heart failure. The study is powered to detect a mortality benefit and should therefore establish the role of ARBs in this patient group.

Sixty-nine patients were randomized, of whom 58 were evaluated with echocardiographic data. After 8 months of treatment in the atenolol group [n = 8 with additional hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)], initial blood pressure was reduced from 160/103 to 147/92 mm Hg (p < 0.0001), and in the valsartan group (n = 9 with additional HCTZ) blood pressure decreased from 163/101 to 146/90 mm Hg (p < 0.0001). Left ventricular mass index decreased from 127 to 117 g/m(2) in the atenolol group and from 127 to 106 g/m(2) in the valsartan group.

Four comparable patients who were not treated with metoprolol were studied in a similar fashion and served as control subjects. In those receiving metoprolol, LV end-diastolic pressure decreased (P=0.001). The isovolumic relaxation index, tau(ln), shortened (P=0.03). In a similar fashion, the LV chamber stiffness constant, kappa, decreased (P=0.02), LV volume elastance improved (P=0.04), and the myocardial stiffness constant, kappa(e), decreased (P=0.02).

Lifestyle changes discussed include smoking cessation, especially newer pharmacologic adjuncts; the efficacy of dietary interventions; and current inroads into the treatment of depression in recurrent events.

    "125": "Renal tubular targeted hormones increase urinary excretion of a lysosomal enzyme, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG). To elucidate the mechanism of this event, the calcitonin effect on NAG handling by LLC-PK1 cells was examined. Calcitonin (1 nM to 1 microM), phorbol myristate (10 nM to 1 microM), and ionomycin (1 to 10 microM) promoted NAG release without any increase in lactate dehydrogenase release or any reduction of mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity. Treatment with 100 nM calphostin C or 50 microM KN-93 partially reversed the calcitonin effect on NAG release. Calcitonin promoted secretion of fluorescence ceramide, a reporter of protein transport from Golgi apparatus to cell surface. Calcitonin-stimulated NAG release was partially inhibited by 10 microg/ml brefeldin A, a blocker of protein transport through the Golgi apparatus. Calcitonin accelerated cellular uptake of exogenous NAG, which was inhibited by low temperature, 0.1 mM monodansyl cadaverine (receptor-mediated endocytosis inhibitor), and 10 mM mannose-6-phosphate. Furthermore, calcitonin promoted progression of intracellular membranes stained by a fluorescence membrane marker, styryl pyridinium dye, from cell periphery to perinuclear regions (commonly referred to as recycling vesicles) and increased dye release from preloaded cells. Fluorescence release from the cells pre-loaded with FITC-labeled NAG or albumin was also stimulated by calcitonin. These calcitonin effects on endocytotic and re-exocytotic pathways were inhibited by 100 nM cytochalasin D, 100 nM nocodazole, 0.1 to 1 microM bafilomycin A1, or 0.1 mM monodansyl cadaverine. Increased urinary NAG excretion has been considered to reflect renal tubular damage. However, it was demonstrated here that stimulation of secretory and recycling pathways may be an alternative mechanism for calcitonin-induced enzymuria, which will become a new indicator of renal tubular response to this hormone.", 
    "126": "Vaso-vagal syncope is generally thought to be triggered by a short episode of sympathetic stimulation immediately followed by an inappropriate reflex hemodynamic response (bradycardia-hypotension). The patient should be reassured and informed about the symptoms which precede syncope and about the benefit that muscular contractions of the legs may provide. Elastic stocking support may be useful. When pharmacological treatment is necessary, betablockers will be the initial choice for patients in whom syncope is clearly preceded by a sympathetic rise. In other instances, the treatment is less well delineated and may consist of fluid-NaCl therapy with fluorocortisone, or possibly an alpha-agonist, or a specific inhibitor of serotonin reuptake. Bi-chamber pacing should be reserved for patients with a marked cardio-inhibitory response and severe, frequently recurrent syncope. The benefit of tilt training deserves confirmation.", 
    "127": "The separation of the enantiomers of three basic drugs, i.e., ofloxacin, propranolol and verapamil, was achieved by affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE), with human serum albumin (HSA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as chiral selectors in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. Ofloxacin was only separated in the presence of BSA, and verapamil only with HSA, while propranolol was separated with either HSA or BSA. The effects of protein concentration and column wall adsorption on the degree of separation were investigated. Two displacers, ketoprofen and warfarin, respectively, when added to the protein containing buffer, both showed significant effects on the separation behavior. From these data it was argued that verapamil may bind to HSA at both locations known, the warfarin binding site (I) and the ketoprofen binding site (II). While with BSA, binding of ofloxacin may also occur at site I, the preferential binding site for propanolol remains controversial. A drug-drug interaction between propranolol and ketoprofen due to opposite charges was concluded from the increase in migration time in BSA solution. The unbound concentration of verapamil enantiomers in solution in the presence of HSA, as estimated from CD-modified capillary zone electrophoresis, was triggered not only by the HSA concentration but also by the coadditive concentration.", 
    "128": "Patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased prevalence of hypertension and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary and cerebrovascular disease. The risk of an individual of developing CVD is much greater when both diseases coexist and is further magnified by their frequent association with dyslipidemia, coagulation, platelet, and endothelial abnormalities. Metabolic abnormalities frequently associated with hypertension are insulin resistance, enhanced coagulation, and decreased fibrinolytic activity. Drug treatment of hypertension in diabetic subjects is fraught with potential difficulties, including altered efficacy of medications, possible side effects, worsening of glycemic control, and impairment of lipid metabolism. Because hypertension is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in diabetes, it should be recognized and treated early and aggressively despite these difficulties. This article reviews the efficacy and side effects of the various classes of antihypertensive agents in patients with diabetes mellitus.", 
    "129": "Beta-blockers have been shown to reduce portal pressure in patients with cirrhosis and limit the development of portosystemic shunts in portal hypertensive animals. Thus, a randomized double-blind trial was conducted to evaluate propranolol in the prevention of the development of large oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis without varices or with small varices.", 
    "130": "One hundred and two patients received long-acting propranolol (160 mg/day) and 104 patients received a placebo. At inclusion, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of clinical characteristics or biochemical tests. At 2 years, the size of varices was estimated on video recordings.", 
    "131": "One-third of the patients were lost to follow-up, and 95%/97% of the remaining patients were compliant in the propranolol and placebo groups, respectively. At 2 years, the proportion of patients with large varices was 31% in the propranolol group and 14% in the placebo group (P< 0.05). Three and four patients bled in the propranolol and placebo groups, respectively, and nine and ten died, respectively.", 
    "132": "This trial suggests that propranolol administration cannot be recommended for the prevention of the development of large oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis; thus other studies are needed in selected subgroups of patients.", 
    "133": "Tedisamil inhibits several cardiac potassium channels including Ito, Ikr, and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channel (I(KATP)), which may be important in the initiation and maintenance of atrial arrhythmias. We herein report the efficacy of tedisamil in terminating and protecting against the reinduction of atrial flutter (AFL) in a conscious canine model. Sustained AFL (> 15 min) was induced in eight of 10 mongrel dogs by programmed atrial stimulation (PAS) 2-41 days after producing a surgical barrier to conduction in the right atrium. At the time of surgery, an epicardial electrode was attached to the right atrial appendage for pacing and recording. Normal saline, 1 ml/kg, was infused after 15 min of AFL as placebo. Tedisamil (1.0 mg/kg) was given intravenously after 30 min of sustained AFL while recording surface ECGs and atrial electrograms. Conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in 10 of 10 trials (eight dogs) in a mean time of 20.5 s (SD, +/- 11.8 s). Tedisamil had a negative chronotropic effect lasting > or =2 h and was protective against the reinduction of AFL. In five dogs, PAS was able to induce AFL in only two of seven trials 2 h after drug infusion. The corrected QT interval (QTc) was lengthened for the first 15 min after tedisamil administration (mean, +/- 39.3 ms; p < 0.05), but thereafter returned to baseline. The QRS interval was not altered by tedisamil. Saline alone, given after 15 min of sustained AFL, converted AFL in one of 11 trials (eight dogs) but did not alter the RR interval, QTc, or QRS interval compared with values measured during AFL. No significant adverse effects of tedisamil were observed. The results indicate that tedisamil is effective in interrupting and/or preventing reinduction of canine AFL, possibly by prolonging atrial refractoriness through inhibition of one or more potassium ion repolarizing currents in atrial muscle. Further studies are required to address the exact mechanism by which tedisamil exerts its antiarrhythmic effect.", 
    "134": "The effects of the calcium channel blockers (CCB) nifedipine (N), verapamil (V) and diltiazem (D) and the beta adrenergic blocking agents (BAB) propranolol (P) and atenolol (A) administered alone or in combination on lipid peroxidation (LPO) and cytochrome p-450 content were studied in rat liver microsomes. The drugs were tested in concentrations of 1 mM. V, A and P alone significantly decreased TBARS formed after in vitro stimulation of LPO by Fe2+ and ascorbate, whereas no antioxidant effect was found for N and D. A correlation between the antioxidant capacity of the drugs and their ability to protect cytochrome p-450 after in vitro stimulation of LPO was observed except for propranolol. Moreover, propranolol abolished cytochrome p-450 protecting effect of verapamil when administered together. A direct, LPO-independent decreasing effect on cytochrome p-450 was observed upon in vitro incubation of microsomes with propranolol. The results are discussed in terms of LPO-dependent degradation of cytochrome p-450, formation of propranolol reactive metabolites and propranolol-dependent changes in cytochrome lipid environment.", 
    "135": "Abnormal beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) density in the brains of suicide victims has been reported, although results of studies are inconsistent. Ethanol modifies betaAR-mediated signal transduction. Moreover abnormal betaAR function has been implicated in alcoholism. BetaAR antagonists, which were used as ligands in previous betaAR binding studies, also bind to 5-HT1B/1Dbeta receptors; hence, their estimates of betaAR density are confounded by binding to 5-HT1B/1Dbeta receptors. More importantly, previous studies did not examine betaAR agonist affinity or coupling efficiency to Gs protein. We investigated agonist affinity and coupling efficiency of betaAR to Gs protein in the brains of ten suicide victims, six subjects with alcoholism, and eight controls. There were no differences in betaAR density in either the frontal cortex or hippocampus of suicide victims or alcoholic subjects compared to controls. Preliminary results indicate betaAR supercoupling in suicide victims in both brain regions and uncoupling in alcoholic subjects in the frontal cortex. These results are discussed in view of the existing literature on the role of betaAR in suicide and alcoholism and the mechanism of action of antidepressants.", 
    "136": "A prospective study was carried out using a combination of propranolol and potassium iodate to assess whether there were beneficial effects in preparing hyperthyroid cats for surgical thyroidectomy. Group A (n = 11) received propranolol from days 1 to 10, followed by propranolol and potassium iodate from days 11 to 20; group B (n = 10) received the reverse regimen. Blood samples were taken daily for subsequent determination of serum total L-thyroxine (TT4), L-triiodothyronine (TT3) and reverse T3 (rT3) concentrations. The signs of hyperthyroidism improved in all cats over the treatment period. At surgery, 36 per cent of the cats in group A had reference range serum TT4 concentrations, while 89 per cent with initially elevated TT3 concentrations had reference range concentrations. In group B, 10 per cent of the cats had reference range TT4 concentrations, while 75 per cent with initially elevated TT3 concentrations had reference range concentrations. The drug regimen used in group A was better tolerated and more effective and offers an alternative before thyroidectomy in cats that cannot tolerate carbimazole.", 
    "137": "Endogenous epinephrine has been found to increase alveolar liquid clearance (ALC) in several pulmonary edema models. In this study, we infused epinephrine intravenously for 1 h in anesthetized rats to produce plasma epinephrine concentrations commonly observed in this species under stressful conditions and measured ALC by mass balance. Epinephrine increased ALC from 31.5 +/- 3.2 to 48.9 +/- 1.1 (SE)% of the instilled volume (P < 0.05). The increased ALC was prevented by either propranolol or amiloride. To determine whether ALC returns to normal after plasma epinephrine concentration normalizes, we measured ALC 2 h after stopping an initial 1-h epinephrine infusion and found ALC to be at baseline values. Finally, to determine whether desensitization of the liquid clearance response occurs, we evaluated the effects of both repeated 1-h infusions and a continuous 4-h infusion of epinephrine on ALC and found no reduction in ALC under either condition. We conclude that epinephrine increases ALC by stimulating beta-adrenoceptors and sodium transport, that the increase is reversible once plasma epinephrine concentration normalizes, and that desensitization of the ALC response does not appear to occur after 4 h of continuous epinephrine exposure.", 
    "138": "Observations of torsades de pointes during therapy with terfenadine and astemizole has raised concern about the cardiac safety of non-sedating H1-antagonist agents. We compared cetirizine, another compound of that class, to D-sotalol and to astemizole in a model of acquired long QT syndrome. Open-chest surgery was performed in adult beagle dogs anaesthetized with halothane and thiopental. Bradycardia was produced with beta-adrenergic blockade and sinus node crush. Four left ventricular intramyocardial unipolar monophasic action potentials (MAP) were recorded during atrial pacing at basic cycle lengths (BCL) 400-1500 msec, before and during three successive 1-h drug infusions (0.14, 0.45 and 1.4 mg/kg/h for astemizole and cetirizine and 1.1, 2.2 and 4.5 mg/kg/h for D-sotalol). Dose- and bradycardia-dependent prolongations of MAP duration (MAPD) were produced by D-sotalol (P < 0.001) and astemizole (P < 0.001) but not by cetirizine. At BCL 1500 ms, the three infusions of astemizole prolonged endocardial MAPD from 323 +/- 8 msec (mean +/- SE) at baseline to 343 +/- 10, 379 +/- 13 and 468 +/- 26 msec, respectively (n = 9). Sotalol prolonged that MAPD from 339 +/- 6 msec to 377 +/- 7, 444 +/- 15 and 485 +/- 24 msec (n = 7). In contrast, cetirizine did not prolong MAPD: 341 +/- 8 msec at baseline Vs 330 +/- 8, 324 +/- 9 and 323 +/- 11 msec (n = 9). Drug-induced increase in transmural dispersion reached +79 +/- 19 msec after astemizole, +59 +/- 21 msec after D-sotalol and only +7 +/- 11 msec after cetirizine. Runs of ventricular tachycardias and torsades de pointes occurred during dose three of astemizole (5/9 dogs) and D-sotalol (4/7 dogs) but never during cetirizine. In the present model, astemizole and D-sotalol but not cetirizine prolonged MAPD and transmural dispersions of repolarization and produced torsades de pointes. These results suggest that the halothane-anaesthetized bradycardic dog could be a valuable model to discriminate drugs for their class III effects and proarrhythmic potencies.", 
    "139": "Low-dose drug therapy is promoted as a way to maximize benefit and minimize adverse drug effects when prescribing for older adults. This population-based study evaluates the age and sex-related use of two common therapies: thiazide diuretics, where evidence supports the use of low-dose therapy, and beta-blockers, where trials have not evaluated the minimum effective dose.", 
    "140": "Using linked administrative databases we identified all of the 120,613 persons dispensed a thiazide diuretic therapy and 12,908 myocardial infarction survivors dispensed beta-blocker therapy in Canada's largest province. We used logistic regression models to study the association of age and sex with dispensing of low-dose thiazide diuretic and beta-blocker therapy at doses lower than evaluated in trials.", 
    "141": "Of 120,613 older people dispensed a thiazide diuretic, 32,372 (26.8%) were dispensed a low dose. Patients 85 years of age or older, relative to the youngest group, were 30% more likely to be dispensed low-dose therapy (OR=1.31; 95% CI, 1.27 to 1.36; P < .001). Women were 8% more likely than men to be dispensed a low-dose thiazide diuretic (OR=1.08; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.11; P < .001). Of 10,991 myocardial infarction survivors dispensed atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol, or timolol, 9458 (86.1%) were dispensed a lower-than-evaluated dose. Patients 85 years of age or older, relative to those in the youngest group, were more than twice as likely to be dispensed a lower-than-evaluated beta-blocker therapy dose (OR=2.28; 95% CI, 1.74 to 3.04; P < .001). No difference was noted in the use of beta-blocker therapy dose by sex (OR=1.0; 95% CI, .89 to 1.15; P = .95).", 
    "142": "Low-dose thiazide diuretic therapy prescribed widely to older people, particularly those of advanced age and women. The vast majority of myocardial infarction survivors were dispensed beta-blocker therapy at lower-than-evaluated doses. These findings highlight the need to manufacture low-dose thiazide diuretic therapy and to evaluate the minimum effective dose of beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "143": "Since REM sleep is characterized by a suspension of the hypothalamic integration of homeostatic regulations, it has been assumed that the duration of both REM sleep episodes and of the time interval between the end of one episode and the beginning of the following episode may be regulated according to sleep related processes and the homeostatic needs of the organism. A series of studies performed on the rat has shown that REM sleep episodes occur as two basic types: single REM sleep episodes, that are separated by intervals > 3 min and sequential episodes, that are separated by intervals < or = 3 min and appear in a cluster. Moreover, it has been observed that, in this species, a change in REM sleep occurrence is caused by a modification in the number of episodes and not in their duration. With respect to this, sleep deprivation and recovery are characterized by a decrease and an increase, respectively, in the number of sequential REM sleep episodes, but the number of single episodes tends to be kept constant. The central aspects of this kind of regulation have been examined biochemically in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus, an area involved in the control of autonomic and sleep related processes. The results show that the accumulation of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) is impaired, in this region, during sleep deprivation and appears to return to the control levels, during the recovery, with a rate inversely related to the degree of the previous deprivation. Moreover, it has been observed that the systemic administration of DL-propranolol and LiCl reduces cAMP accumulation mainly in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus; this condition is concomitant with a reduction in REM sleep occurrence.", 
    "144": "Heart failure is a major and still growing medical and epidemiological problem, but in the last 10-20 years great progress has been made in its treatment. Alleviating symptoms is not (any longer) the only aim of the treatment; improving the life expectation or reducing the mortality has become a different, at least as important aim. Left ventricular dysfunction, even if asymptomatic, should be regarded, just as hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, as a risk factor for which efficacious treatment is available and which consequently should be treated. A problem in this respect is that the effect of treatment of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction and of mild forms of heart failure is difficult to measure. Beta-blocking agents have proved to be the greatest gain in the treatment of heart failure in recent years, in addition to ACE inhibitors, diuretics and digoxin. These preparations should be prescribed with caution and due consideration. However, their favourable influence is such that use on a much larger scale than currently appears to be justified.", 
    "145": "Using three different techniques of ocular blood flow measurement, we evaluated the effects of topical levobunolol on retinal, optic nerve head, and choroidal circulation.", 
    "146": "Twenty normal volunteers received one drop of levobunolol in one eye and one drop of placebo in the fellow eye. Retinal venous blood flow was measured using multiple scattering laser velocimetry. Retinal capillary blood flow and optic nerve head blood flow were measured by Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter. Pulsatile ocular blood flow was measured by ocular blood flow tonography. Changes in blood pressure, heart rate, retinal venous blood flow, retinal capillary blood flow, optic nerve head blood flow, intraocular pressure and pulsatile ocular blood flow were detected from measurements taken at baseline and at 90 to 120 minutes following the instillation.", 
    "147": "Intraocular pressure decreased significantly in both eyes. Retinal capillary blood flow increased significantly in both eyes. Optic nerve head blood flow increased significantly in treated eyes but remained unchanged in placebo eyes. There were no significant changes in retinal venous blood flow or pulsatile ocular blood flow in either eyes.", 
    "148": "Our results suggest that one administration of levobunolol may increase the retinal and optic nerve circulation but does not decrease the choroidal circulation.", 
    "149": "Published clinical practice guidelines from the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines, and the Task Force of the Working Group on Heart Failure of the European Society of Cardiology--supported by the results of numerous large-scale randomized controlled trials--define the standard universal pharmacologic approach to all patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. According to these guidelines, all heart failure patients regardless of etiology (with rare exceptions such as obstructive valvular heart disease) should be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as first-line treatment of the heart failure. In fact, the non-edematous patient with only mild exertional dyspnea may be treated with an ACE inhibitor as sole therapy of the left ventricular dysfunction. As patients become edematous or complain of more moderate congestive symptoms, it is then appropriate to add a diuretic along with the ACE inhibitor. Digoxin is reserved for those patients who remain symptomatic on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic. Carvedilol, the only beta-adrenergic receptor blocker approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of heart failure, has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with New York Heart Association Class II or III symptoms. In the U.S. Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program, carvedilol's benefit was seen in patients with either ischemic or nonischemic etiologies of heart failure. Similar findings of benefit in both ischemic and nonischemic heart failure have been observed in the recently reported Second Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS II) trial as well as in ACE inhibitor heart failure trials. Studies suggesting differences in outcome based on etiology during pharmacologic treatment of heart failure have been too small (inadequately powered) or have assessed this difference only in post-hoc analyses. Thus, the universal pharmacologic management of heart failure with an ACE inhibitor, diuretic, beta-blocker (e.g. carvedilol), and digoxin may be applied to all patients with ischemic or nonischemic heart failure. This makes sense since the pathophysiology of heart failure following myocardial injury is similar for both forms of the disease.", 
    "150": "We report the case of a young woman with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which presented with acute renal failure, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia and nephrotic proteinuria. Investigations showed total infarction of right kidney by extensive arterial and vein thrombosis and presence of anticardiolipin antibodies IgG isotype (anti-beta2-glycoprotein I-positive). She was submitted to right nefrectomy and initiated anticoagulant therapy. After nefrectomy, the postoperative period was marked by the development of arterial hypertension and persistence of nephrotic syndrome. Hypertension was treated with antihypertensive drugs (IECA, beta-blocker and calcium antagonist). As the nephrotic syndrome persisted despite anticoagulant and antihypertensive therapy, the patient was treated with oral corticosteroids. Her renal function improved, hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia corrected to normal values and proteinuria decreased to subnephrotic value. We discuss the unusual presentation of this case of primary antiphospholipid syndrome with total unilateral renal thrombosis and nephrotic syndrome that respond to anticoagulant, antihypertensive and corticosteroid therapy.", 
    "151": "We investigated the influence of sympathetic nervous system processes on mucosal immunity by comparing the effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockade with 40 mg propranolol and placebo on secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) at rest and during paced serial arithmetic, cold pressor, and submaximal cycling. These tasks produced patterns of cardiovascular activity indicative of combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic, alpha-adrenergic, and beta-adrenergic activation, respectively. The effectiveness of the beta blockade was confirmed by the attenuation under propranolol of the shortening of the cardiac preejection period and the tachycardia elicited by mental arithmetic and exercise. The cold pressor test did not affect sIgA under either the placebo or the propranolol. Mental arithmetic increased sIgA concentration, and this increase was not blocked by propranolol. Exercise elicited increases in both sIgA concentration and sIgA secretion rate, which were not diminished by beta blockade. These data suggest that sIgA is not regulated by beta-adrenergic mechanisms."
