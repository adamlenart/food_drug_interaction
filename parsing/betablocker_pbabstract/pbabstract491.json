    "0": "Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective and potent alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, reduces halothane anesthetic requirements by over 90% in rats. The present study examined whether dexmedetomidine produces a hypnotic-anesthetic action in rats. Dexmedetomidine induced a hypnotic-anesthetic state in rats characterized by loss of righting reflex at doses greater than or equal to 0.1 mg/kg. This response was dose-dependent between 0.1 and 3 mg/kg. Alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists that cross the blood-brain barrier (antipamezole and idazoxan) decreased the hypnotic-anesthetic action of dexmedetomidine in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, the alpha-2 antagonist, L-659,066, which does not penetrate into the CNS did not affect dexmedetomidine-induced hypnosis. Antagonists for the other adrenoceptors not only failed to reduce the hypnotic-anesthetic action of dexmedetomidine but in some cases even potentiated this effect. Thus, prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, significantly enhanced the hypnotic-anesthetic property of dexmedetomidine. Antagonists with beta-2 receptor blocking properties also enhanced dexmedetomidine-induced hypnosis. Selective beta-1 receptor antagonists did not affect the hypnotic action of dexmedetomidine. These results suggest that dexmedetomidine produces a hypnotic-anesthetic action in rats via activation of central alpha-2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "1": "The type of catecholamine receptor involved in the regulation of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) level in chicken retina was compared to that regulating these parameters in the pineal gland. Systemic administration of apomorphine, a dopamine receptor agonist, resulted in marked inhibition of the nocturnal increase of retinal NAT activity and melatonin content. Apomorphine did not affect NAT activity or melatonin content of the pineal gland. In contrast, clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, inhibited the nocturnal rise in pineal NAT activity and melatonin content although being without effect on these parameters in retina. Apomorphine-induced inhibition of retinal NAT activity was blocked by spiperone, a D2-dopamine receptor antagonist, but not by antagonists of D1-dopamine, alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta adrenergic receptors. Systemic or intraocular injection of quinpirole, a D2-dopamine receptor agonist, in the middle of the dark phase of the light-dark cycle markedly reduced retinal NAT activity and melatonin level, whereas injections of SKF 38393-A, a D1-dopaminergic agonist, had no effect. The inhibitory effect of clonidine on pineal NAT activity was blocked by yohimbine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that NAT activity and melatonin content in chicken retina and pineal gland are differentially modulated in vivo by D2-dopamine and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, respectively. Despite the different types of receptors involved, both tissues may share a common pathway for catecholamine-mediated inhibition of melatonin biosynthesis, i.e., inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity.", 
    "2": "The plasticity of the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes was examined in the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) of the adult rat. The beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist 125I-pindolol (125I-PIN) was used in conjunction with the selective subtype antagonists ICI 118,551 and ICI 89,406 to determine the subnuclear distribution of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors in this nucleus and to correlate the receptor distribution with the distribution of both noradrenergic afferents from the locus coeruleus (LC) and non-noradrenergic afferents from the fasiculus retroflexus (FR). The density of these binding sites was examined following lesions that decreased (LC lesions) or increased (FR lesions) the density of the noradrenergic projection in the IPN. Quantitative radioautography indicated that beta 1-labeled binding sites account for the larger percentage of binding sites in the IPN. The beta 1-binding sites are densest in the those subnuclei that receive a noradrenergic projection from the LC: the central, rostral, and intermediate subnuclei. beta 1-binding sites are algo homogeneously distributed throughout the lateral subnuclei, where there is no detectable noradrenergic innervation. beta 2-binding sites have a more restricted distribution. They are concentrated in the ventral half of the lateral subnuclei, where they account for 70% of total 125I-PIN binding sites. beta 2-binding sites are also present along the ventral border of the IPN. Some of this labeling extends into the central and intermediate subnuclei. Bilateral lesions of the LC, which selectively remove noradrenergic innervation to the IPN, result in an increase in the beta 1-binding sites. Bilateral lesions of the FR, which remove the major cholinergic and peptidergic input from the IPN, elicit an increase in noradrenergic projections and a decrease in beta 1-binding sites. beta 1-binding sites thus exhibit both up-regulation and down-regulation which is correlated with the density of the noradrenergic projection. Our results suggest, therefore, that the density of beta 1-binding sites is regulated by noradrenergic input. beta 2-binding sites increase in density in response to both the LC and FR lesions, suggesting that they are postsynaptic to both of these afferents. The distribution suggests that some of these binding sites may reflect binding to glial cells. The beta 2-binding sites may therefore be regulated by both noradrenergic and non-noradrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "3": "The technique of quantitative autoradiography has been used to localize changes in the densities of subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors in rat brain following treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine. Previously reported increases in the density of beta 1-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex were confirmed. The anatomical resolution of autoradiography made it possible to detect changes in the density of beta 2-adrenergic receptors in the cortex and in a number of other brain regions. The density of beta 1-adrenergic receptors increased from 30 to 50% depending on the region of the cortex being examined. The increase in the somatomotor cortex was greater than that in the frontal or occipital cortex. The increase in the density of beta 2-adrenergic receptors in the cortex was not as widespread as that of beta 1-adrenergic receptors and occurred primarily in frontal cortex, where the density of receptors increased by 40%. The densities of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors increased in a number of forebrain, thalamic, and midbrain structures. Selective changes in the density of beta 1-adrenergic receptors were observed in the superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus and in the amygdala. The density of beta 2-adrenergic receptors increased in the caudate-putamen, the substantia nigra, and the lateral and central nuclei of the thalamus, whereas the density of beta 1-adrenergic receptors did not change in these regions. The densities of both subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors increased in the hippocampus, the cerebellum, the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus, and the dorsal lateral geniculate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "The technique of population pharmacokinetic analysis was employed to study the variability in the dose concentration relationship of bisoprolol during its clinical development. The influence of demographic factors on the variability of clearance was investigated in 3 different populations: group I, patients (including an elderly group) with essential hypertension receiving multiple oral doses of bisoprolol 10 or 20mg for 3 months; group II, patients with different degrees of renal impairment and healthy controls; and group III, patients with different types of hepatic impairment and healthy controls. Patients and controls in groups II and III received only a single oral dose of bisoprolol 10mg. The 3 data sets were analysed separately, using a non-linear mixed effects model (the NONMEM program). A 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption described the data adequately. The typical values of volume of central compartment, volume of distribution at steady-state and the absorption rate constant for the 3 populations were: for group I, 68L, 235L, and 0.7h-1; for group II, 28L, 179L, and 0.3h-1; and for group III, 55L, 256L, and 0.4h-1, respectively. Plasma clearance was related to age in group I, to serum creatinine in group II and to aspartate transaminase activity in group III. The 68% confidence limits for clearance and elimination half-life were 8.2 to 21.5 L/h and 7.6 to 19.7h, respectively, for 50-year-old patients in group I. The analysis predicted that progressive increases in serum creatinine or aspartate transaminase activity will result in only a 50% reduction of clearance.",

    "6": "Patients with ischemic heart disease who present for surgery are frequently managed with a \"high dose\" narcotic technique utilizing fentanyl or sufentanil in combination with neuromuscular blockade. Narcotic anesthetic induction has been associated with perioperative cardiac conduction disturbances, particularly in patients previously treated with calcium channel and/or beta-adrenergic antagonists. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine in chronically instrumented dogs the effects on systemic and coronary hemodynamics and regional contractile function of sufentanil alone or in combination with the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent vecuronium, with and without pretreatment with the calcium channel blocking agent diltiazem, and/or the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Thirty-six experiments were conducted in four groups of 19 chronically instrumented dogs. Administration of sufentanil (25 and 50 micrograms/kg of normal body weight IV) resulted in a significant sinus or junctional bradyarrhythmia without alteration in systemic and coronary hemodynamics. Pretreatment with propranolol (1 mg/kg IV) decreased left ventricular +dP/dt without other hemodynamic alterations. After propranolol pretreatment, sufentanil (25 and 50 micrograms/kg IV) produced statistically significant dose-dependent decreases in heart rate and +dP/dt, while increasing mean and diastolic coronary vascular resistances. After pretreatment with diltiazem (0.3 mg/kg IV) and propranolol (1.0 mg/kg IV), sufentanil (25 micrograms/kg IV) produced significantly greater bradycardia (38 +/- 4 beats/min) than it did in non-pretreated or propranolol-pretreatment dogs. Similarly, administration of sufentanil (25 micrograms/kg IV) in combination with vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg IV) after propranolol and diltiazem pretreatment resulted in the appearance of bradyarrhythmias (32 +/- 2 beats/min) and two episodes of asystole, responsive to atropine sulfate (0.4 mg). In spite of severe bradycardia, arterial pressure was well maintained in all groups. In all groups, administration of naloxone (0.2 mg/kg IV and 0.2 mg/kg IM) after sufentanil produced significant increases in arterial pressure, left ventricular +dP/dt, and diastolic coronary blood flow velocity. Therefore, the combination of sufentanil and vecuronium in chronically instrumented dogs may result in the appearance of cardiac conduction disturbances. This action is more likely to occur after pretreatment with diltiazem and propranolol. Although systemic hemodynamics were well maintained in dogs in the present study during the episodes of bradyarrhythmias, potentially significant cardiovascular deficits may occur in pa", 
    "7": "The role of an increased sympathetic activation in the development of insulin resistance in diabetic skeletal muscle was investigated. Epitrochlearis muscles from rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes and from controls were incubated in vitro for 0.5-12.0 h. Diabetes decreased maximal insulin-stimulated (20 mU/ml) glucose transport capacity by 60% (P less than .001), but this decreased insulin responsiveness returned to normal on in vitro incubation (3.79 +/- 0.59 before vs. 8.92 +/- 0.64 mumol.ml-1.h-1 after 12 h of incubation). The reversal of decreased insulin responsiveness in diabetic muscles did not require the presence of insulin and was not affected by the presence of 5.0 x 10(-8) M of epinephrine. However, it was possible to partially prevent the development of insulin resistance with regard to glucose transport by treating the rats with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) every 12 h during the entire 72-h period in which the animals were kept diabetic (insulin responsiveness was 3.16 +/- 0.40 mumol.ml-1.h-1 for saline-injected group vs. 5.55 +/- 0.46 mumol.ml-1.h-1 for propranolol-treated group). This effect was not present after a single injection of the drug 2 h before the experiment or when propranolol treatment was withdrawn 12 h before the experiment. The beta-adrenergic blockade markedly reduced the plasma concentration of free fatty acids (0.5 +/- 0.01 mumol/ml for propranolol-treated rats vs. 1.1 +/- 0.1 mumol/ml for saline-treated rats; P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Periodic fluctuations in the R-R interval have been used as noninvasive measures of cardiac autonomic tone. For example, a reduced heart rate variability has been shown to correlate with an increased mortality in patients recovering from myocardial infarction. The effects that physiologic perturbations such as exercise have on this heart rate variability have not been investigated. Therefore, heart rate variability was measured throughout a submaximal exercise test in 36 mongrel dogs with healed anterior myocardial infarctions. The amplitude of the respiratory component (0.24-1.04 Hz) was determined by time-series analysis techniques and was used as an index of cardiac vagal tone. On a subsequent day, a 2-minute coronary occlusion was initiated during the last minute of exercise. Twenty-two animals developed ventricular fibrillation (susceptible), whereas 14 animals did not (resistant). Exercise elicited a significantly greater increase in heart rate (resistant, 205.4 +/- 7.1; susceptible, 227.0 +/- 5.4 beats/min) in susceptible animals, which was accompanied by a greater reduction in the cardiac vagal tone index (resistant, 2.7 +/- 0.3; susceptible, 1.1 +/- 0.2 ln msec2) as compared with resistant animals. Conversely, atropine sulfate (50 micrograms/kg) given during exercise elicited a greater heart rate increase in the resistant dogs (heart rate change: resistant, 54.2 +/- 7.0; susceptible, 18.7 +/- 4.4 beats/min). Taken together, these data suggest that exercise elicited a greater reduction in cardiac vagal tone in animals known to be susceptible to ventricular fibrillation.", 
    "9": "Tiazofurin (2-beta-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide, NSC 286193), a selective inhibitor of the activity of IMP dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.205), the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo GTP biosynthesis, provided in end stage leukemic patients a rapid decrease of IMP dehydrogenase activity and GTP concentration in the blast cells and a subsequent decline in blast cell count. Sixteen consecutive patients with end stage acute nonlymphocytic leukemia or myeloid blast crisis of chronic granulocytic leukemia were treated with tiazofurin. Allopurinol was also given to inhibit xanthine oxidase activity to decrease uric acid excretion and to elevate the serum concentration of hypoxanthine, which should competitively inhibit the activity of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.8), the salvage enzyme of guanylate synthesis. Assays of IMP dehydrogenase activity and GTP concentration in leukemic cells provided a method to monitor the impact of tiazofurin and allopurinol and to adjust the drug doses. In this group of patients with poor prognosis, five attained a complete hematological remission and one showed a hematological improvement. A marked antileukemic effect was seen in two other patients. All five evaluable patients with myeloid blast crisis of chronic granulocytic leukemia reentered the chronic phase of their disease. Five patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia were refractory to tiazofurin and three were unevaluable for hematological effect because of early severe complications. Responses with intermittent 5- to 15-day courses of tiazofurin lasted 3-10 months. Tiazofurin had a clear antiproliferative effect, but the pattern of hematological response indicated that it appeared to induce differentiation of leukemic cells. In spite of toxicity with severe or life-threatening complications in 11 of 16 patients, tiazofurin was better tolerated in most patients than other antileukemic treatment modalities and provided a rational, biochemically targeted, and biochemically monitored chemotherapy which should be of interest in the treatment of leukemias and as a paradigm in enzyme pattern-targeted chemotherapy.", 
    "10": "In order to compare the efficacy of beta-blocking, diuretics and ACE-inhibiting monotherapy in controlling the blood pressure increase to stress, a study was conducted on 30 subjects (10 treated with atenolol, 10 with hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride combination, 10 with enalapril) with mild or moderate essential hypertension whose resting blood pressures were normalised by therapy. In the 3 groups of subjects blood pressure values at rest, during mental stress, static and dynamic exercise did not significantly differ before antihypertensive therapy. Atenolol and enalapril significantly reduced systolic and diastolic pressure below pretreatment values throughout and immediately after each test, differing from diuretic therapy which did not show any significant reduction in diastolic rises at the peak of hand-grip or in both systolic and diastolic pressures at the highest work-loads during dynamic exercise. In the recovery period of the exercise cycle test diuretics also produced a later normalisation of diastolic pressure. In conclusion, beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors seem to be more effective than diuretics in the control of the blood pressure response to stress in hypertensive patients, suggesting that these drugs are the first choice treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "11": "The properties of beta-adrenoreceptors (beta-AR) have been studied in endothelial cells from the human pulmonary artery (EPA) and umbilical vein (EUV). [125I] Iodosyanopindolol binding assay revealed the amount of 22 and 12 fmol/10(6) cells as well as Kd = 92 and 52 pM for EPA and EUV, respectively. Adrenergic agonists increased the cAMP levels in EPA in the order of potency characteristic for beta 2-AR: isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. Basing on the results obtained in the present study and the literature data a conclusion is made that the properties of beta-AR in vascular endothelial cells do not practically depend on their localization, suggesting universality of their function within the vascular system.", 
    "12": "Drugs given to a total artificial heart (TAH) calf isolate their vascular effects independent of the myocardium. During experiments, the TAH maintains full ejection, constant heart rate, and percent systole, and uses no vacuum. Cardiac output (CO) varies solely and directly with preload. Six calves received an infusion of isoproterenol, a beta agonist, and three calves received propranolol, a beta antagonist. The isoproterenol was resumed after beta blockade. Isoproterenol alone caused a significant increase in CO, an effect that was attenuated but not eliminated with beta blockade. Both isoproterenol and propranolol decreased AoP, but only isoproterenol increased preload. Beta receptors play a significant role in decreasing venous capacitance with increased preload and CO, independent of the myocardium.", 
    "13": "Physical exercise stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. However several factors affect the control of mineralocorticoid secretion. In this study, eight healthy volunteers performed maximal exercise on cycle ergometer after being pretreated for 3 days with placebo (P) or with a non selective beta-blocker (B) (pindolol 15 mg/day). Plasma reinin activity (PRA), aldosterone (ALD), atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and kalemia (K+) were measured at rest (R) and during exercise until exhaustion (E). (table; see text) These results confirm the role of beta-adrenoceptor activation in the increased PRA during exercise. It appears an exercise-induced increase in plasma ANF which was more elevated in subjects treated with pindolol, but which had no inhibitory effect on ALD secretion in theses conditions. K+ rose during exercise and this hyperkalemia tended to be higher with a beta-blocker. It is suggested that K+ elevation counterbalance both PRA decrease and ANF increase to be responsible for the absence of change in plasma ALD during beta-blockade.", 
    "14": "The distribution of beta-adrenoceptors in sections of human cervix taken at the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle was studied using light-microscopic autoradiography. The radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol (125ICYP) was used to identify specific binding sites. Moderate density of labelling by 125ICYP was seen over smooth muscle and blood vessels. The most intense labelling, however, was seen over glands and surface columnar epithelium. The association of beta-adrenoceptors with glands and surface columnar epithelium suggests a possible adrenergic regulation of secretory function in the cervix.", 
    "15": "This study addresses the hypothesis that electrocardiographic T-wave amplitude is influenced by beta-adrenergic stimulation of the heart. Beta-adrenergic activity was manipulated both pharmacologically and through behavioral challenge. Under resting conditions, 12 healthy men underwent infusion of placebo and then the beta-agonist, isoproterenol, and the beta-blocker, propranolol, in a counterbalanced, crossover design. During infusion of placebo, subjects also underwent two behavioral challenges, a structured interview and mental arithmetic. Analysis of the resting data indicated that propranolol produced a significant increase in T-wave amplitude, and isoproterenol produced significant T-wave amplitude attenuation. As previously reported, drug effects were also in evidence for heart rate. Behaviorally-induced reduction of T-wave amplitude was observed for mental arithmetic but not structured interview, which again paralleled heart rate data. Both pharmacological and behavioral data reported in this study support the hypothesis that the T-wave is significantly affected by beta-sympathetic influence on the heart. However, a nonspecific effect of heart rate change on T-wave amplitude would also account for these results. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the utility of T-wave amplitude in psychophysiological research.", 
    "16": "This study examined the characteristics and distribution of sarcolemmal and light vesicular beta-adrenergic receptors (BAR) in left ventricular myocardium from 15 adults (aged 17 to 58 years) without left ventricular dysfunction or coronary artery disease and 29 patients (aged 14 to 53 years) with end-stage congestive heart failure (CHF). Sarcolemmal and intracellular fractions were prepared by 40,000 x g and 108,000 x g centrifugation, respectively. Agonist and antagonist binding properties were assessed by nonlinear computer modelling of isoproterenol-125I-pindolol (IPIN) displacement curves. Adenylate cyclase activity was also examined. Distribution of intracellular and sarcolemmal BAR was similar in normal and failing left ventricular myocardium, with intracellular BAR comprising 4.5 +/- 2.2% of total BAR in normal human heart and 5.7 +/- 5.1% of total BAR in CHF patients. For sarcolemmal BAR, antagonist affinity was similar for normal and CHF patients (KD IPIN in normals, 21.7 +/- 2.6 pM; KD IPIN in CHF, 20 +/- 2.3 pM). Agonist affinity was somewhat higher in CHF patients (KD isoproterenol in normals, 33 +/- 4.9 nM; KD isoproterenol in CHF, 6.2 +/- 1.5 nM). Sarcolemmal BAR number was reduced in CHF from 21.4 +/- 2.9 to 16.4 +/- 1.3 fmol/mg protein (P less than 0.04). Cyclic AMP production (pmol/mg protein/min above basal) was less in CHF after Gpp(NH)p stimulation (normals, 82 +/- 20; CHF, 27 +/- 9; P less than 0.01) and after stimulation with Gpp(NH)p + isoproterenol (normals, 129 +/- 25; CHF, 56 +/- 13; P less than 0.02). Stimulation with manganese + forskolin resulted in similar levels of cyclic AMP production in normals and in CHF patients. We conclude that: (a) sarcolemmal BAR number is reduced in CHF, but BAR are not redistributed intracellularly and (b) beta-adrenergic transmembrane signalling in CHF is also impaired at the level of the guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins.", 
    "17": "By a specific bond of 3H-dihydroalprenolol the number (Bmax) and characteristic (Kd) of sympathetic beta-receptors in cell membranes of the myometrium and lymphocytes of peripheral blood was assessed. The authors examined six tissue specimens taken during planned termination of pregnancy during the 38th-40th week by primary Caesarean section parallel with a peripheral blood sample. In healthy women even at the end of pregnancy the myometrium contains ample amounts of specific beta-receptors. As compared with the myometrium, the lymphocytes of the peripheral blood contain beta-adrenergic receptors of the same type as the myometrium but in much smaller amounts. So far it was not possible to show a correlation between the number of sympathetic beta-receptors in the membranes of the myometrium and of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood.", 
    "18": "Experimental data in animals indicate that coronary vasoconstriction occurs following blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptors or alpha-receptors activation. The vasomotor effects of these maneuvers in man are unclear. Therefore we investigated whether and to which extent alpha-stimulation (cold pressor test: CPT) and beta-blockade (propranolol) cause coronary vasoconstriction; whether this effect involves the resistance arterioles as well as the large epicardial branches, and, within these, whether the normal and stenotic tracts are involved. Patterns in patients with effort angina were compared with those in patients with Prinzmetal angina. We studied 19 cases with classic and 15 cases with Prinzmetal angina. The systemic, pulmonary and coronary hemodynamics (pressure, flow and resistance) and the vasomotor pattern of normal and stenotic epicardial branches (quantitative angiography) were evaluated in the baseline condition, during CPT, after propranolol (5 mg iv) and during CPT repeated after propranolol. We observed that: changes of the coronary flow due to beta-blockade and to CPT are related to the variations of the myocardial oxygen consumption, induced by the inhibition and activation of adrenergic receptors and not to the concomitant vasomotor reaction of the stenotic vascular tract; beta-blockade does not affect homogeneously the lumen of the stenotic lesions in effort angina and invariably increases the lumen in the Prinzmetal form; influences of CPT, in the absence as well as in the presence of beta-receptor blockade, on the lumen diameter of both normal vessels and stenotic lesions are minimal in either form of angina.", 
    "19": "We report here on the social behavior of 30 adult male cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), half of which were chronically administered propranolol HCl. All monkeys were maintained in groups of five, fed an atherogenic diet, and subjected to a social manipulation involving repeated disruption of social groups through redistribution of group memberships. One year of intensive behavioral observations were made, involving quantification of 27 kinds of social interaction typically exhibited by this species in captivity. Propranolol treatment resulted in a significant reduction in heart rate and blood pressure. Comparisons between propranolol-treated and untreated monkeys revealed no effects of beta-blockade on social dominance, aggressiveness, or active aspects of affiliation (e.g., grooming). The fact that few behavioral differences were found between conditions in this investigation indicates to us that such effects as were observed may owe as much to chance as to the action of the drug. Overall, these findings suggest that chronic beta-adrenergic blockade has minimal effects on the most prominent features of macaque monkey social behavior, especially those behavioral factors (aggressiveness and competitiveness) associated with risk for coronary disease in this species and in human beings.", 
    "20": "In this report we have examined the effect of alloimmunization on beta-adrenergic expression in lymphocytes. We have observed a variation in the number of beta-adrenoceptors (Bmax) according to the degree of immunization without modifications in their affinity (Kd). This phenomenon was accompanied with parallel variations of intracellular cAMP levels. A decrease in Bmax values was observed during the first and second immunizations. Then the Bmax began to increase, exceeding control values up to the fourth and fifth immunizations, and remaining constant at the sixth immunizations. Only B cell-enriched populations showed variation in Bmax values of beta-adrenoceptors with alloimmunization. In contrast, the Bmax values of T cell-enriched populations did not change. Kd values were similar in all cell types tested. The number of binding sites was not dependent on the animal's age. Modifications in cAMP levels of B cell-enriched populations were correlated with changes in beta-adrenoceptor expression. These results suggest that beta-adrenoceptor expression and cAMP intracellular levels in B cell-enriched populations vary with the number of alloimmunizations. In addition, the antibody synthesis induced by allogenic stimulus was inversely proportional to the number of beta-adrenoceptors expressed on B cells. Perhaps these findings are evidence of a control mechanism that regulates antibody synthesis during the immune response.", 
    "21": "Sympathetic nerve stimulation can cause pulmonary vasoconstriction related to norepinephrine (NE) release. Because of recent reports that NE caused prostacyclin (PGI2) release from systemic arteries, we wondered whether NE caused pulmonary vascular PGI2 release and whether a feedback mechanism existed whereby PGI2 modulated NE-induced vasoconstriction. NE-induced PGI2 synthesis in rat main pulmonary artery rings was larger than that induced by KCl, passive stretch, or a thromboxane analogue, was alpha-adrenergic receptor dependent, and was enhanced by endothelium removal. The NE-induced PGI2 synthesis was not tightly coupled to the magnitude of the pulmonary artery ring contractile response, and inhibition of NE-induced PGI2 production by cyclooxygenase blockade in either the pulmonary artery ring preparation or in isolated rat lungs perfused with a physiological solution did not augment the magnitude of the contractile response. We concluded that NE is a potent stimulus for PGI2 synthesis in the rat main pulmonary artery ring and in the rat lung, yet PGI2 is not important as a modulator of NE-induced vasoconstriction in the rat lung.", 
    "22": "1. Developmental change in the response to noradrenaline (NA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was investigated in the chick oesophagus between 9 and 21 days of incubation and 4 days after hatching. 2. NA (5 microM) produced a significant contraction in the oesophagus at 9 days of incubation. The NA-induced contraction progressively decreased with development and changed to an inhibition of spontaneous contraction or a small relaxation by 17 days of incubation. 3. The NA-induced contractile response was inhibited by phentolamine (2.7 microM) and prazosin (0.55 microM). Phenylephrine (5 microM) but not clonidine (5-50 microM), also induced a contraction at early stages. The relaxation response to NA was sensitive to the beta-receptor blocker, carteolol (3.4 microM). 4. Pretreatment with carteolol unmasked the contractile responses to NA in preparations at 17-19 days of incubation. However, even in the presence of carteolol, the contraction produced by NA decreased and disappeared by the time of hatching. This change in response to NA is accompanied by a decline in the pD2 value. The response to phenylephrine (5 microM) followed the same pattern as that to NA. 5. The maximum binding sites of [3H]-dihydroergocryptine to the crude membrane preparation from oesophagus changed little at 13, 17 and 21 days of incubation. 6. Isoprenaline (Iso, 0.01-20 microM) caused a carteolol-sensitive relaxation in the carbachol-contracted oesophagus after 13 days of incubation. The sensitivity (pD2 value) to Iso decreased slightly up to 17 days of incubation. 7. 5-HT (10 microM) caused a contraction in the oesophagus after 13 days of incubation and the amplitudem of the response increased up to 17 days of incubation. The response to 5-HT was abolished by methysergide (1 microM) but not by tetrodotoxin (0.78 microM) or atropine (1 microM) at every stage tested. 8. These results suggest that the response to NA changed from an alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated contraction to a beta-receptor-mediated relaxation during the embryonic period, resulting partly from the decline and disappearance of excitatory alpha-receptor function in the chick oesophagus.", 
    "23": "1. The autoradiographic distribution of alpha 1-adrenoceptors was investigated in non-diseased and asthmatic human lung by use of [3H]-prazosin (H-PZ). To validate binding and autoradiographic methods, H-PZ binding was also measured in rat heart. 2. Significant levels of specific H-PZ binding were detected in sections of rat heart. This binding was associated with a single class of non-interacting sites of high affinity (dissociation constant, Kd = 1.17 +/- 0.26 nM). The maximum binding capacity (Bmax) was 59.5 +/- 4.5 fmol mg-1 protein. 3. In sharp contrast, very low levels of specific H-PZ binding were found in both human nondiseased and asthmatic bronchus, although a high level of binding of [125I]-iodocyanopindolol (I-CYP, 50 pM) to beta-adrenoceptors was detected in these airways. Furthermore, very low levels of autoradiographic grains representing specific H-PZ binding were found in all airway structures in human non-diseased or asthmatic lung parenchyma. 4. Consistent with these data, the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine failed to induce significant increases in tone in bronchi isolated from either non-diseased or asthmatic human lung. Results indicate that asthma does not involve significant increases in airway alpha 1-adrenoceptor function.", 
    "24": "There is growing evidence that ovarian steroidogenesis is controlled not only by pituitary gonadotropins but also by ovarian nerves. Nerves reach the ovary via the plexus nerve and via the superior ovarian nerve (SON), which runs in the suspensory ligament, and innervate theca cells of all sizes of follicles. To investigate the role of ovarian nerves in steroidogenesis we have examined the effects of adding an extract of SON from adult rats on androgen production by cultured porcine theca cells. Addition of SON extract to cultured theca interna from 3 to 6 mm diameter follicles of prepubertal gilts significantly inhibited (p less than 0.05) LH-stimulated androstenedione production in a dose-dependent manner; significant inhibition (10.8%) occurred with the addition of the extract of 2 mg of SON/ml culture medium, and near maximal inhibition (83%) resulted when the SON extract was increased to 60 mg SON/ml. Extracts of sciatic nerves, used as non-ovarian nerve controls, failed to inhibit, and in fact significantly increased (p less than 0.05) androstenedione production over the same concentration range of neural tissue extract. The inhibitory effect of the SON extract was unaffected by chymotrypsin digestion or by the presence of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (10(-6) M), but was removed by charcoal treatment. These results suggest that the nervous system has the potential for modulation of follicular steroid biosynthesis via direct innervation of the ovaries, in addition to the well-established indirect mechanism of neural control exerted via the hypothalamic-pituitary system.", 
    "25": "We have reported that infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) inhibited the rise in plasma renin activity (PRA) in response to constriction of the abdominal aorta to cause a reduction in renal perfusion pressure (RPP). To evaluate the effect of ANF on neural control of renin release, acute thoracic inferior vena caval constriction (TIVCC) was performed in conscious dogs to reduce arterial pressure by 25% of control and stimulate PRA by a reflex increase in renal nerve activity and a reduction in RPP. Propranolol was used to block neural stimulation of renin release. TIVCC caused significant increases in PRA, plasma aldosterone, arginine vasopressin (AVP), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations. The increase in PRA was significantly reduced by the infusion of either ANF at 20 ng.kg-1.min-1 or propranolol. The combined infusion of ANF and propranolol produced an additive and complete inhibition of the renin response to TIVCC; therefore the effect of ANF is independent of neural stimulation of renin release. ANF at 20 ng.kg-1.min-1 also inhibited increases in aldosterone, AVP, and ACTH, but ANF at 5 ng.kg-1.min-1 only affected the aldosterone response to TIVCC. Therefore ANF inhibits angiotensin II-stimulated aldosterone synthesis and/or secretion at very low doses and at higher doses attenuates reflex increases in AVP and ACTH caused by hypotension.", 
    "26": "To determine whether alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation can augment adenosine-induced coronary vasodilation, 34 open-chest dogs were studied. When a small dose of clonidine (up to 0.24 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 ic) was administered under beta-adrenoceptor blockade, coronary blood flow [312 +/- 16 (SE) ml.100 g-1.min-1] maximally induced by intracoronary infusion of adenosine was further increased (P less than 0.05) by 66 +/- 16 ml.100 g-1.min-1, despite no significant changes in coronary perfusion pressure, myocardial oxygen consumption, and coronary venous adenosine concentration. However, when a larger dose of clonidine (0.36-0.60 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) was infused, adenosine-induced flow progressively decreased. This biphasic action of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor activity was also observed when the dose of norepinephrine was increased during alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade with prazosin. Norepinephrine up to 0.24 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 (ic) further increased adenosine-induced coronary blood flow by 24 +/- 5% (P less than 0.001), whereas hyperemic flow was decreased by a larger dose of norepinephrine. In contrast to the alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation, the alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation (norepinephrine with yohimbine) progressively decreased coronary blood flow. Furthermore, with a small dose of clonidine, reactive hyperemic flow significantly increased compared with that without clonidine (303 +/- 13 vs. 355 +/- 13 ml.100 g-1.min-1, P less than 0.001), but a larger dose of clonidine adversely reduced reactive flow (254 +/- 18 ml.100 g-1.min-1, P less than 0.001). Adenosine release during reactive hyperemia with and without intracoronary infusions of clonidine were not altered significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "Stable isotope tracers and indirect calorimetry were used to evaluate the importance of beta-adrenergic stimulation of lipolysis and triglyceride-fatty acid cycling during fasting in healthy human volunteers. Each subject was studied after 12 and 84 h of fasting both with and without propranolol infusion (protocol 1) and when oral propranolol treatment was given throughout fasting (protocol 2). In protocol 1, the rates of appearance of glycerol and palmitic acid increased from 3.04 +/- 0.19 and 1.78 +/- 0.17 mumol.kg lean body mass-1.min-1, respectively, after 12 h of fasting to 5.28 +/- 0.31 and 3.47 +/- 0.15 mumol.kg lean body mass-1.min-1, respectively, after 84 h of fasting (P less than 0.005). The rate of triglyceride-fatty acid cycling increased from 97 +/- 8 to 169 +/- 5 mumol/min (P less than 0.005). Intravenous propranolol infusion decreased the rate of lipolysis after both 12 and 84 h of fasting, but the magnitude of the antilipolytic effect was much greater after 84 h (P less than 0.005). In protocol 2, the rate of lipolysis and triglyceride-fatty acid cycling was still increased by fasting despite beta-adrenergic blockade with oral propranolol. This study demonstrates that beta-adrenergic stimulation contributes to the mobilization of fat during fasting. However, other mechanism(s) can increase lipolysis and triglyceride-fatty acid cycling when beta-adrenergic receptors are continuously blocked.", 
    "28": "Many vasoactive agents have been shown to bind to specific receptors on endothelial cells. Among these is atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). Binding of ANF to endothelial cells has been demonstrated to induce elevation of intracellular guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP). Other vasoactive agents have been shown to cause elevation of intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), Ca, and diacylglycerol. However, the endothelial cell response that occurs subsequent to elevation of cGMP or other second messengers is not well understood. Recently, endothelial cells have been shown to possess a Na-K-Cl cotransport system that is stimulated by vasopressin and bradykinin and inhibited by isoproterenol. Thus it is possible that modulation of Na-K-Cl cotransport may play a role in the endothelial cell response to second messengers that are elevated by ANF and other vasoactive agents. This possibility was examined in the present study by evaluating the effects of a variety of vasoactive agents and their second messengers on endothelial cell Na-K-Cl cotransport. Cotransport was assessed as bumetanide-sensitive K influx in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. A number of agents were found to reduce Na-K-Cl cotransport, including ANF, acetylcholine, histamine, and norepinephrine. Cotransport was found to be stimulated by angiotensin II, as well as vasopressin and bradykinin. Na-K-Cl cotransport was also inhibited by elevation of intracellular cGMP or cAMP or by treatment of the cells with phorbol ester to activate protein kinase C. However, A23187-induced elevation of intracellular Ca caused stimulation of Na-K-Cl cotransport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "The goals of this prospective, nonexperimental study were to examine the ways in which family physicians select from among four antihypertensive agents for their patients and to provide an overall perspective on how these agents perform in the management of hypertension in primary care. Three hundred seventy-eight family physicians treated 3608 mild and moderate hypertensives with one of the following medications: atenolol (n = 564 patients), enalapril maleate (n = 677), verapamil hydrochloride in sustained-release form (n = 1861), or a fixed combination, hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene (n = 506). The resultant four groups of patients differed in several demographic and clinical measures: age, gender, race, concurrent disease, diastolic and systolic blood pressures, heart rate, and history of hypertension. The patient profiles for each group suggest appropriate matching of drugs to individual patient needs: younger patients and those with higher heart rates more often received the beta-blocker; blacks were more frequently assigned to the diuretic and less often to the beta-blocker; patients with concurrent diseases and a longer history of hypertension were more often assigned to the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or the calcium channel blocker. Rates of success, defined by the percentages of patients staying on the selected drug and experiencing a reduction of at least 10 mmHg or achieving a diastolic pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg, were in the same range for all four groups (55 to 62.5 percent). Patients evaluated their quality of life and gave enalapril and verapamil SR the highest ratings. The rapid completion of the study, the quality of the results, and the high rates of follow-up and compliance show that family practice is an excellent setting for conducting clinical research.", 
    "30": "Treatment of rats with desipramine (DMI) has been shown to down-regulate beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated adenylate cyclase and reduce the Bmax of beta-adrenergic receptors in some brain areas. Recent reports have indicated that the down-regulation in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors following DMI treatment does not occur if the serotonin system has been impaired following parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA) or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine injection. We have previously shown that [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA), the most commonly used radioligand to measure central nervous system beta-adrenergic receptors, labels another site under normal experimental procedures, in addition to the beta-adrenergic receptors. This second site has some pharmacological characteristics of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor. The depletion of serotonin following PCPA injection was indeed able to prevent the down-regulation of [3H]DHA binding sites after DMI injection. However, PCPA alone increased the density of [3H]DHA binding sites. If the nonlinear, least squares, curve-fitting program LIGAND was allowed to define [3H]DHA nonspecific binding or if the more selective beta-adrenergic receptor radioligand [3H]CGP-1277 was used, the Bmax of beta-adrenergic receptors was not changed after PCPA injection. Importantly, PCPA did not prevent beta-adrenergic receptor down-regulation following DMI treatment. The blockade of 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptors, via ketanserin administration, during DMI treatment did not change the response of beta-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, if LIGAND was used to define the nonspecific binding of [3H]DHA, the down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors was significant 24 hr after a single DMI injection. The same rapid down-regulation was demonstrated with [3H]CGP-12177. However, if [3H]DHA was used to label beta-adrenergic receptors in the \"typical\" manner (nonspecific binding defined by 10 microM alprenolol), a decrease in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors was significant only after seven daily DMI injections. These data demonstrate that the use of [3H]DHA to measure beta-adrenergic receptors can be misleading, because changes in its second binding site can conceal the changes occurring in beta-adrenergic receptors. Moreover, these results suggest that a similarity in the time course of action of DMI cannot be used to support the hypothesis that its therapeutic antidepressant action is related to beta-adrenergic receptor down-regulation.", 
    "31": "[3H]Dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) has been used extensively in receptor binding studies to measure beta-adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system. Usually, nonspecific binding has been defined by high concentrations of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol or antagonists such as alprenolol or propranolol. Scatchard plots of such \"specific\" [3H]DHA saturation data in rat cerebral cortex membranes are linear. However, computer analysis demonstrated that the competition curves of these drugs for 2.0 nM [3H]DHA binding are biphasic, with a continuous inhibition of [3H]DHA binding in the concentration range usually used to determine nonspecific binding. These data indicate that another saturable high affinity site was being labeled by the radioligand and that the definition of nonspecific binding with any of these unlabeled drugs is not satisfactory. We used the nonlinear, least squares, curve-fitting program LIGAND to analyze total [3H]DHA binding, allowing the program to mathematically define nonspecific binding as a function of 3H-ligand concentration. Significantly lower Bmax (-44%) and Kd (-58%) values for beta-adrenergic receptors were found, indicating that under normal experimental procedures (defining [3H]DHA non-specific binding with these nonradioactive drugs) a second binding site was being labeled. We found that [3H]DHA binding to this site could be inhibited by drugs such as RU24969, a 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5HT1A) and 5HT1B receptor subtype-selective agonist, and CGS12066B, a 5HT1B receptor subtype-selective agonist, which were able to compete for 15-20% of [3H]DHA binding in the nanomolar concentration range, whereas drugs that are selective for other serotonin receptor subtypes inhibited [3H]DHA binding only at much higher concentrations. Another beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist radioligand, [3H]CGP-12177, was found to be more selective for beta-adrenergic receptors. Alprenolol competition curves for [3H]CGP-12177 binding were monophasic and saturation curves, with nonspecific binding defined either by 10 microM alprenolol or by LIGAND, yielded Bmax values close to those obtained with [3H]DHA when its nonspecific binding was defined by LIGAND. [3H]DHA cannot be considered a suitable radioligand to quantify central nervous system beta-adrenergic receptors in the manner in which it has been typically used.", 
    "32": "The effects of alpha adrenoceptor stimulation with noradrenaline were investigated in rat ventricular myocytes after blockade of beta receptors with propranolol (1 microM). At room temperature and low stimulation frequency (0.5 Hz), noradrenaline evoked a phentolamine-sensitive increase in contraction amplitude by 22%. The action potentials of myocytes were prolonged. When the sodium current was inactivated by depolarization in whole-cell voltage clamp experiments, noradrenaline caused a small, but highly variable increase in net inward current and shifted the current-voltage relation between -30 and -5 mV to the hyperpolarizing direction. These effects were absent when K+ currents were inhibited by Cs+ substitution. After inhibition of the Ca++ current with Cd++ (0.1 mM), noradrenaline decreased the peak transient outward current; it reduced the steady-state outward current in a concentration-dependent manner (pD2 value, 6.9), but had no effect on the amplitude of the transient component of outward current. Noradrenaline reduced holding current at -40 mV. The inward branch of the inward rectifier was not affected. The noradrenaline-induced changes in membrane currents were significantly smaller in the presence of phentolamine (10 microM). They are therefore considered to be mediated by alpha adrenoceptor stimulation. The reduction in outward currents can explain the prolongation in action potential duration which could contribute to the increase in contractility.", 
    "33": "To begin defining the factors regulating neurotransmitter receptor expression, we examined beta-adrenergic receptors in rat liver in vivo and in primary liver cultures under defined hormonal conditions. beta-receptors described a remarkable developmental profile in vivo, increasing fivefold between embryonic days 16 and 20, and decreasing tenfold by early adulthood. The developmental decrease reflected reduced receptor number without a change in receptor properties. The ontogenetic decrease appeared to be specific for beta-receptors; alpha-receptors developed in a hyperbolic fashion, reaching high plateau values by the third postnatal week. Adult rat liver cells plated into culture re-expressed high beta-receptor levels, exhibiting a 4-8-fold increase. A similar pattern of expression of the beta-receptors, having similar pharmacological properties, was observed in primary liver cultures maintained in serum-free medium, in a serum-supplemented medium or in several variations of a serum-free, hormonally defined medium designed for primary liver cultures. Thus, the degree of expression of the beta-receptors was not found affected by various hormones, by serum, or by any medium condition. By contrast, the degree of expression of the beta-receptors was markedly sensitive to cell density. High expression of the beta-receptors was observed at low cell densities (1-3 x 10(6) cells/150 mm dish), and low expression or no expression was observed in confluent cultures (10-20 x 10(6) cells/150 mm dish). Our experiments suggest that beta-receptor expression does not follow an immutable program, but may be regulated by density-dependent cell-cell interactions.", 
    "34": "We have compared the properties of beta-adrenergic receptors in slow-twitch, oxidative skeletal muscles (soleus) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats at three different ages. The investigation was based on the hypothesis that the increase in Na+ content and decrease in fatigue resistance observed previously in the soleus of SHR might be the result of a down regulation of muscle beta-receptors. Activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in skeletal muscle stimulates sarcolemmal sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase, which produces an efflux of Na+ and an influx of K+. Receptor down-regulation would be expected to reduce hormonal stimulation of Na+ pump activity, particularly during exercise. The results of receptor binding studies, however, and an investigation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production in response to applied epinephrine indicated that there were no significant differences in receptor properties in the soleus muscles of SHR and WKY rats. Receptor number and affinity were the same in the two strains, and the rate, magnitude, and duration of the increase in cAMP in response to 10(-6) M epinephrine were also similar. beta-Adrenergic receptor down-regulation does not appear to be a generalized phenomenon in tissues of SHR, despite the appearance of other physiological changes in the tissue.", 
    "35": "Isolated rat islets of Langerhans were incubated for 2 h in a [3H]inositol-containing medium supplemented with 7 mM glucose and the sulfonylurea tolbutamide (50-200 microM). After labeling, the ability of these islets to respond during a subsequent perifusion to 20 mM glucose or 15 mM alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC) was assessed. The following major observations were made. Prior exposure to tolbutamide inhibited [3H]inositol efflux, inositol phosphate accumulation, and the insulin secretory responses of subsequently perifused islets to 20 mM glucose stimulation. When present during the 2-h labeling period, the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine (500 nM), a compound that abolishes tolbutamide-induced increases in PI hydrolysis, blocked these inhibitory effects of tolbutamide. In addition, the diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor monooleoylglycerol (50 microM) restored the impaired second phase insulin secretory response noted after a 2-h tolbutamide exposure. Prior exposure to tolbutamide (200 microM) also desensitized the islet, in terms of [3H] inositol phosphate accumulation, [3H]inositol efflux, and insulin secretory responses, to 15 mM KIC. The inclusion of monooleoylglycerol during the stimulatory period with KIC restored second phase insulin secretion. The results support the conclusion that chronic tolbutamide-induced increases in PI hydrolysis render the beta-cell insensitive to a subsequent 20-mM glucose or 15-mM KIC stimulus. Blocking tolbutamide-induced increases in PI hydrolysis during the labeling period eliminates the adverse effects of the sulfonylurea. The ineffectiveness of glucose and KIC to maintain insulin secretory responses from prior tolbutamide-exposed islets appears to be the result of the inability of these agonists to appropriately activate PI hydrolysis.", 
    "36": "We compared the antihypertensive effects of the beta-blocker atenolol and the converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril during 12 weeks of treatment in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Atenolol (n = 10) significantly decreased conventionally measured blood pressure from 144/103 to 135/93 mm Hg and lisinopril (n = 9) from 150/104 to 130/92 mm Hg. Based on data derived from automated 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, atenolol decreased the average whole-day systolic pressure by 18 +/- 6 mm Hg (p less than 0.02) and the diastolic pressure by 11 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Lisinopril produced decreases of 27 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and 13 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Examination of the 24-h blood pressure patterns showed that the efficacies of the two drugs were similar. Each appeared to be effective throughout the whole-day monitoring period, although only lisinopril significantly decreased blood pressure during the final four-h period (4 AM to 8 AM) preceding the next day's dose. Neither drug produced significant echocardiographic changes in left ventricular wall thickness or muscle mass during the short-term treatment. Lisinopril and atenolol effectively decrease blood pressure during a 24-h period. Moreover, we found that automated whole-day blood pressure monitoring is a useful tool for comparing the efficacy and duration of action of differing antihypertensive agents.", 
    "37": "The renin-aldosterone system may be depressed in subjects exercising at high altitude, thereby preventing excessive angiotensin I (ANG I) and aldosterone levels, which could favor the onset of acute mountain sickness. The role of beta-adrenoceptors in hormonal responses to hypoxia was investigated in 12 subjects treated with a nonselective beta-blocker, pindolol. The subjects performed a standardized maximal bicycle ergometer exercise with (P) and without (C) acute pindolol treatment (15 mg/day) at sea level, as well as during a 5-day period at high altitude (4,350 m, barometric pressure 450 mmHg). During sea-level exercise, pindolol caused a reduction in plasma renin activity (PRA, 2.83 +/- 0.35 vs. 5.13 +/- 0.7 ng ANG I.ml-1.h-1, P less than 0.01), an increase in plasma alpha-atrial natriuretic factor (alpha-ANF) level (23.1 +/- 2.9 (P) vs. 10.4 +/- 1.5 (C) pmol/1, P less than 0.01), and no change in plasma aldosterone concentration [0.50 +/- 0.04 (P) vs. 0.53 +/- 0.03 (C) nmol/1]. Compared with sea-level values, PRA (3.45 +/- 0.7 ng ANG I.ml-1.h-1) and PA (0.39 +/- 0.03 nmol/1) were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) during exercise at high altitude. alpha-ANF was not affected by hypoxia. When beta-blockade was achieved at high altitude, exercise-induced elevation in PRA was completely abolished, but no additional decline in PA occurred. Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations tended to be lower during maximal exercise at altitude; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Our results provide further evidence that hypoxia has a suppressive effect on the renin-aldosterone system. However, beta-adrenergic mechanisms do not appear to be responsible for inhibition of renin secretion at high altitude.", 
    "38": "Potential mechanisms of hypoxia-induced atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) release [A.J. Baertschi, J.M. Adams, and M.P. Sullivan. Am. J. Physiol. 255 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 24): H295-H300, 1988] were investigated in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts. The ANF release was graded with stimulus intensity; 10 min of perfusion with Krebs-Henseleit solution equilibrated with 95, 20, 10, 5, and 0% oxygen led to peak ANF levels of 140 +/- 31 (SE), 202 +/- 20, 407 +/- 76, 659 +/- 119, and 516 +/- 83% of base-line ANF (159 +/- 14 pg/ml), respectively. Hypoxia-induced release of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase did not correlate with ANF release; this finding, along with other experiments, rules out tissue damage as a significant factor. Phentolamine (1.3 microM) and propranolol (0.1 microM) each reduced peak hypoxia-induced (0% O2) ANF release to 333 and 310%, respectively, whereas atropine sulfate (15 microM) had no inhibitory effect. The three antagonists combined reduced the peak hypoxia-induced ANF release to the same extent (307%) as either phentolamine or propranolol alone. Earlier (24 h) catecholamine depletion of rats with 100 mg/kg 6-hydroxydopamine also significantly reduced peak hypoxia-induced ANF release to 330%. Neither the reduction of the ANF secretory responses by these interventions nor the remaining ANF response could be attributed to changes in atrial mechanics. Therefore, these studies demonstrate that alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation is responsible for approximately half the hypoxia-induced ANF release from the isolated heart, whereas an as yet undefined mechanism accounts for the remainder of the response.", 
    "39": "Cardiopulmonary bypass is accompanied by profound changes in the organism that may alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Drug distribution can be altered, for example, by changes in blood flow and by haemodilution, with a decrease in protein binding; a decrease in the elimination of some drugs can be caused by impairment of renal or hepatic clearance, due, for example, to lowered perfusion and hypothermia. The subject was reviewed in the Journal in 1982, and the emphasis of the present review is on new data related to specific drugs. The following substances are dealt with: benzodiazepines, cephalosporins, digitalis glycosides, general anaesthetics, glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin), lignocaine (lidocaine), muscle relaxants, nitroprusside, opiates, papaverine and propranolol. For many of these substances an abrupt decrease has been observed in serum concentration upon initiation of bypass, which is explained by haemodilution and an increase in distribution due to decreased protein binding. For nitrates and some opiates, adsorption to the bypass apparatus was shown to be important. The gradual increase in serum concentrations seen during cardiopulmonary bypass with some drugs after the initial fall is usually explained by redistribution of the drug and/or decrease in its elimination. The same phenomena are thought to explain why in the post-bypass period a concentration increase occurs, or at least a slower decrease than expected. However, drug elimination has been directly measured in only a few studies. The short duration of the bypass procedure and the continuous changes during the process hamper a rigorous pharmacokinetic evaluation. Studies allowing more precise understanding of the mechanisms underlying the observed concentration changes are needed, but are difficult to design. Similarly, more data are awaited on the pharmacodynamic and clinical consequences of the concentration changes.", 
    "40": "We compared the effects of transdermal clonidine and oral atenolol on acute exercise performance and on conditioning response to an 8-week program of regular aerobic exercise in young, otherwise healthy subjects with mild hypertension. The study was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study with placebo control. Twenty-seven subjects (11 receiving transdermal clonidine, 8 receiving oral atenolol, and 8 receiving placebo) completed the study. Atenolol controlled blood pressure in all 8 subjects, vs 6 of 11 in the transdermal clonidine group and 0 of 8 in the placebo group. Both active drugs lowered systolic blood pressure during exercise. With clonidine treatment, the antihypertensive effect during exercise was smaller and was observed only at low and moderate workloads. Acute exercise performance (subjects receiving drug but still unconditioned) was assessed by endurance time at a constant workload equal to the highest workload completed on a previous 2-minute incremental exercise test. Endurance time was reduced 35% by atenolol but not by transdermal clonidine or placebo. Neither active drug interfered with the progress of the conditioning program, as measured by gradual lengthening of exercise time. However, as assessed by change in oxygen uptake standardized to a heart rate of 170 beats per minute, the improvement in conditioning was twice as great in subjects receiving transdermal clonidine and placebo (+20%, +18%) as it was in those receiving atenolol (+8%). Subjects receiving placebo and transdermal clonidine lost weight; subjects receiving oral atenolol gained weight. The changes in weight were small.",

At their peak effects, (a) nifedipine decreased SVR (-17 p. 100, p less than 0.01), increased HR (+ 12p. 100, p less than 0.001) and CO (+ 18 p. 100, p less than 0.001), did not change MAP and increased BBF (+31 p. 100, p less than 0.001) with a vasodilating effect which affected both large and small arteries; (b) propranolol decreased HR (-14 p. 100, p less than 0.05) and CO (-25 p. 100, p less than 0.01), increased SVR (+25 p. 100, p less than 0.01), did not change MAP and decreased BBF (-28 p. 100, p less than 0.05) with a vasoconstrictor effect which affected both large and small arteries; (c) in the nifedipine-propranolol combination, nifedipine neutralized propranolol-induced systemic and regional vasoconstrictor effects while propranolol antagonized nifedipine-induced increases in HR and CO. Thus, the favorable synergistic effects of the nifedipine-propranolol combination in hypertensive patients could be demonstrated in healthy subjects inasmuch as MAP was decreased and peripheral vascular blood flows were preserved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "The purpose of this multicenter randomised, double-blind and cross-over study was to compare the antihypertensive effects of labetalol (L) and captopril (C) in 42 moderate hypertensive patients (mean age: 52 years). The drugs were given during two 4-weeks periods at the end of which the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) were measured at rest in supine and standing positions. The assessment of the quality of life was realized with 4 scales completed by the practitioner [anxiety, depression, well-being, visual analog scale (VAS)] and 4 scales of auto-assessment completed by the patient [2 VAS, well-being, sub-scale of pleasure]. At the end of the first treatment's period (D28), both drugs had decreased significantly supine SBP and DBP (p less than 0.001), standing DBP (L = p less than 0.01; C = p less than 0.05), while only L lowered supine SBP (p less than 0.01). The cross-over analysis was unable to conclude, due to the number of patients and a significant interaction which reduced its power. Thus the effect of the first treatment's period seemed to influence the efficacy of the second one. The percentages of patients with a controlled BP were respectively: after 4 weeks of treatment, L = 61 p. 100 vs C = 42 p. 100 and at the end of study (D56), L = 67 p. 100 vs C = 64 p. 100.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "The involvement of adrenoreceptors in the control of reticulo-ruminal (R-R) motility was electromyographically studied in five conscious adult ewes. Intravenous (i.v.) administration of the beta 2-agonist ritodrine (10 or 20 micrograms/kg.min for 15 min) or alpha 1-blocker prazosin (20 micrograms/kg.min for 30 min) or the beta 1- and beta-blocker acebutolol and propranolol, respectively, (30 micrograms/kg.min for 30 min) had no significant effect on R-R phasic myoelectrical grouped discharges (PMGD). Administration of the alpha 1-agonist phenylephrine (4 micrograms/kg.min i.v. for 15 min) significantly increased for 25 min both the frequency of R-R PMGD and the percentage of occurrence of secondary ruminal PMGD and provoked rumination. Pretreatment of animals with prazosin prevented these R-R responses to phenylephrine. Administration of the alpha 2-agonist naphazoline (2.5 micrograms/kg.min i.v. for 15 min) stopped the reticular PMGD for 1 hour, after an initial increase in their frequency, and greatly decreased the frequency of ruminal PMGD. When animals were pretreated with the alpha 2-blocker yohimbine (20 micrograms/kg.min i.v. for 30 min), naphazoline failed to produce any effect on R-R PMGD. Yohimbine, given either alone or followed by naphazoline, abolished secondary ruminal PMGD for about 2 hours. The beta 1-agonist (+)-dobutamine (30 micrograms/kg.min i.v. for 15 min) provoked a pause in R-R PMGD, which reappeared soon after the end of drug administration. Pretreatment of ewes with acebutolol or propranolol prevented dobutamine from producing its effects on R-R PMGD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "The response to incremental work after placebo and propranolol (80 mg, orally) was studied in 11 sedentary (S) and 11 physically active (PA) healthy subjects. O2 uptake, CO2 output, and minute ventilation were significantly reduced at all or most work rates after propranolol in S subjects, whereas in PA subjects only O2 uptake was occasionally significantly reduced. Maximum work capacity during the propranolol trial was significantly increased by 17% in the S group but was unaltered in the PA group. A subanaerobic threshold constant work test in five sedentary subjects demonstrated that propranolol had no effect on the respiratory response both early and late in exercise. In addition, propranolol did not impair the ability of the respiratory control system to maintain alveolar PCO2 at new set points when external dead space was added during constant load work. We conclude that alterations of gas exchange during incremental work after propranolol administration are related to both physical fitness and type of exercise.", 
    "45": "Diazoxide caused an increase in 86Rb+ efflux from the rat aorta and portal vein and inhibited spontaneous activity of the latter at concentrations 100 times higher than the K+ channel opener cromakalim. In the rabbit aorta both drugs inhibited vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin II, noradrenaline and low concentrations (less than or equal to 30 mM) of KCl in a similar manner, the antivasoconstrictor activities being abolished in vessels depolarized with greater than or equal to 35 mM K+. In vivo cromakalim was about 100 times more potent than diazoxide at lowering blood pressure in rats. Diazoxide (30 mg/kg) caused a more than 2-fold increase in plasma glucose in rats and prevented any return toward base line within 1.5 hr after a glucose load. Cromakalim had minimal effects upon glucose homeostasis at equihypotensive doses. Glibenclamide, a potent blocker of ATP-dependent K+ channels, inhibited the stimulation by cromakalim and diazoxide of 86Rb+ efflux from the portal vein and aorta (IC50 approximately 0.1 microM), antagonized their vasorelaxant effects in vitro and in vivo (20-30 mg/kg i.v.) and reversed the diazoxide-induced changes in plasma glucose and insulin levels. These results provide evidence that diazoxide, like cromakalim, is able to open 86Rb+-permeable K+ channels in vascular smooth muscle. This action is likely to be responsible for the in vitro and in vivo vasodilator activity of these two drugs. However, there would seem to be pharmacological differences between the K+ channels affected by these drugs in vascular smooth muscle and the (ATP-sensitive) K+ channels of pancreatic beta-cells, which are thought to be responsible for the effects of diazoxide on plasma glucose.", 
    "46": "Adenosine and ATP produce dose- and tone-dependent responses in the feline pulmonary vascular bed. That is, at baseline (low) pulmonary vascular tone adenosine and ATP produce vasoconstrictor responses and at elevated pulmonary vascular tone adenosine and ATP produce vasodilator responses. The mechanism mediating the vasodilator responses to adenosine and ATP was investigated in the intact-chest cat under conditions of controlled pulmonary blood flow and left atrial pressure. When lobar vascular resistance was raised with U46619, intralobar injections of adenosine and ATP caused dose-related decreases in lobar arterial pressure. The pulmonary vasodilator responses to ATP and adenosine were not altered by atropine, propranolol, meclofenamate or cimetidine indicating that these responses were not mediated by the release of vasodilator prostaglandins or to activation of beta adrenergic, muscarinic or histamine (H2) receptors. The decreases in lobar arterial pressure in response to adenosine were reduced significantly by BWA1433U, an adenosine (P1) receptor antagonist. BWA1433U induced a parallel shift of the adenosine dose-response curve to the right; however, it had no significant inhibitory effect on the decrease in lobar arterial pressure in response to ATP. The P1 receptor antagonist in doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg i.v. had no significant effect on the vasodilator response to nitroglycerin. The present data suggest that vasodilator responses to adenosine in the feline pulmonary vascular bed are mediated by adenosine (P1) receptors, whereas responses to ATP are mediated by a different mechanism that does not involve release of a vasodilator prostaglandin.", 
    "47": "In normotensive rats the effect of different doses of propranolol (1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg i.p.) and ketanserin (10.0 mg/kg p.o.) on mean blood pressure and heart rate and on cardiovascular response to noradrenaline (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 micrograms/kg i.v.) was examined. The drugs were given separately or together. Propranolol slightly reduced the hypotensive effect of ketanserin. On the other hand a decrease in heart rate caused by propranolol was not affected by ketanserin. Our results show that propranolol given with ketanserin did not change the effect of the latter on the cardiovascular system.", 
    "48": "The involvement of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in the triiodothyronine (T3)-induced hemodynamic and metabolic alterations and in the development of cardiac hypertrophy was analyzed in time-course studies. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received daily injections of T3 (200 micrograms/kg s.c.) and a continuous i.v. infusion of 0.9% NaCl or alpha- or beta-receptor blocking agents. NaCl-injected animals served as controls. Eighteen hours after T3 administration, heart rate and LV dP/dtmax were considerably elevated. Cardiac output (CO) was not significantly changed. These alterations were abolished by simultaneous infusion of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. After 48 hours, CO as well as the cardiac RNA concentration were markedly elevated. The rise in LV dP/dtmax and heart rate was similar to the 18-h-value and was prevented by metoprolol. However, metoprolol did not influence the increase in CO and RNA concentration. Likewise, after 72 hours, metoprolol antagonized the T3-induced increase in heart rate and LV dP/dtmax, but had no effect on the elevation of CO and RNA concentration, the enhancement of adenine nucleotide synthesis and cardiac hypertrophy. Like metoprolol, the alpha-adrenergic blocker prazosin did not influence the T3-evoked cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, the development of cardiac hypertrophy in this model can occur independently of alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "49": "After beta-adrenergic blockade, dopamine causes coronary vasoconstriction that is blocked by non-selective alpha-adrenergic antagonists. This study was carried out to determine the relative importance of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors in mediating coronary vasoconstriction in response to dopamine. Because dobutamine has been reported to cause alpha-adrenergic stimulation, the response to dobutamine was also examined. The circumflex coronary artery was cannulated and perfused at a constant blood flow rate in 14 dogs; coronary vasomotor responses were assessed from changes in perfusion pressure. Central effects were eliminated by vagotomy and stellate ganglionectomy; propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) was administered to block beta-adrenergic effects. The coronary responses to intracoronary bolus doses of dopamine and dobutamine were determined; the effects of selective alpha 1-blockade with prazosin (600 micrograms/kg i.v.) and selective alpha 2-blockade with idazoxan or rauwolscine (1-5 micrograms/kg per min intracoronary for 10 min) were examined. Dopamine produced dose-related coronary vasoconstriction; this response was not significantly altered by alpha 1-blockade with prazosin, but was abolished by the addition of alpha 2-adrenergic blockade with idazoxan or rauwolscine. Dobutamine did not produce coronary vasoconstriction at any dose tested. These data demonstrate that coronary vasoconstriction produced by dopamine is mediated through postjunctional alpha 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "50": "The ability of beta-adrenoceptor blockade to reduce the hypertrophic response to thyroxine (T4, 0.5 mg/kg per day, s.c.) was tested in New Zealand white rabbits. Two beta-adrenergic blocking agents, one a full antagonist (propranolol, 9.6 mg/kg per day) and the other a partial agonist (pindolol, 0.96 mg/kg per day) were administered in combination with T4 in an effort to reduce myocardial hypertrophy. A 3 and 16 day group were generated to test the time course of the hypertrophic and receptor responses. Coronary blood flow was measured using radioactive microspheres, and beta-adrenoceptor number and affinity were measured using 125I(-) pindolol as the radioligand. T4 increased coronary blood flow to 1.95 times control values in the 3 day group and 2.2 times control levels in the 16 day group; beta-adrenoceptor number was increased similarly in 3 and 16 day groups to 1.9 times control Bmax levels. Heart weight (HW) to body weight (BW) ratios were significantly increased in only the 16 day group to 1.22 and 1.61 times control, respectively. Treatment with propranolol + T4 blunted the coronary blood flow increase, but receptor upregulation occurred to the same extent as with either substance alone. The HW/BW was increased to 1.49 times control. Pindolol + T4 did not decrease coronary blood flow but blocked beta-adrenoceptor upregulation. The HW was reduced to control levels and the HW/BW ratio was 1.40 times control and significantly decreased from T4 alone. Thus, pindolol was effective in reducing the hypertrophic response to T4, whereas propranolol was only moderately effective in doing so.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "The effects of equipotent doses in negative inotropic and chronotropic properties of nipradilol [10 micrograms/kg/min intravenously (i.v.)] and propranolol (20 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) on hemodynamics and transmural energy metabolites in ischemic hearts were examined in anesthetized dogs. After 5-min infusion of these agents, coronary perfusion pressure of 30 mm Hg was induced by acute coronary stenosis for 10 min. Coronary blood inflow and myocardial contractile force (MCF) in the control ischemic area decreased to about one-third and two-thirds of the respective starting levels. In the nipradilol group, similar changes were observed, but in the propranolol group the MCF tended to decrease further. Cardiac effort index decreased to about two-thirds in both groups. The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) increased by 4.3 mm Hg with saline, by 8.8 mm Hg with propranolol, and by 1.3 mm Hg with nipradilol. ATP depletion in the ischemic myocardium (by 29 and 22% in inner and outer layers, respectively) was restored to normal level by either agent. A decrease in creatine phosphate and an accumulation of lactate were significantly alleviated by nipradilol (by 74 and 59----by 39 and 21%, and by 4.9 and 2.3----by 0.7 and 0.2 times, respectively), but not by propranolol. The results indicate that in addition to a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption caused by the beta-adrenoceptor blocking effects of nipradilol, reductions in preload and afterload caused by the vasodilating property significantly contribute to nipradilol-induced improvement in the ischemic derangement of transmural energy metabolism.", 
    "52": "Flavodilol, ((+/-)-7-[2-hydroxy-3-(propylamine)-propoxy]flavone maleate), a new orally effective antihypertensive agent, extensively depleted catecholamines and serotonin in heart tissue of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Dose-response studies demonstrated that greater than or equal to 75% depletion of cardiac norepinephrine (NE) was accompanied by marked blood pressure decline in SHR. In contrast, whole brain biogenic amine levels were decreased only by 15-20% after acute or chronic treatment with antihypertensive doses (35-75 mg/kg). Adrenal epinephrine (EPI) stores were unaffected by acute treatment, although chronic treatment for 18 days with an antihypertensive dose of 75 mg/kg flavodilol decreased EPI by 70%. Acute treatment also decreased serotonin content of spleen by 70-80%. In dogs, a cumulative oral dose of 40 mg/kg decreased catecholamines by greater than or equal to 50% in aorta and heart muscle. Although hypothalamic catecholamine stores appeared to be more susceptible to depletion by flavodilol than catecholamines in other brain regions, these changes did not appear functionally related to blood pressure decreases since analogs of flavodilol without antihypertensive properties produced equivalent or greater depletion of hypothalamic catecholamine stores. In vitro flavodilol promoted spontaneous and potassium-evoked release of dopamine from isolated striatal nerve endings (0.3 microM) and blocked uptake of NE by hypothalamus and hippocampal nerve endings (1 microM), suggesting that biogenic amine depletion in vivo may be caused by an interference with storage and release mechanisms. Despite structural features reminiscent of beta-adrenergic antagonists, flavodilol had low affinity for beta-receptors. Neither was there any inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase. These findings suggest that the antihypertensive activity of flavodilol results, at least in part, from depletion of sympathetic stores of NE in heart and vascular tissues that moderate adrenergic transmission, thereby decreasing heart rate (HR) and prevailing vascular tone.", 
    "53": "Flavodilol, a new antihypertensive drug, was evaluated in a variety of test systems for better understanding of its biologic properties and the nature of its mechanism of action. Oral administration of the drug to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) lowered arterial blood pressure (ABP) in a dose-related manner, and doses greater than 35 mg/kg increased duration but not magnitude of the response. In contrast, oral administration of flavodilol to normotensive rats did not significantly alter ABP at 35 mg/kg, although larger doses of 75 or 150 mg/kg significantly lowered ABP. In rats with DOCA/salt hypertension, flavodilol effectively lowered ABP to a degree similar to that observed in SHR. At antihypertensive doses, flavodilol did not alter blood pressure responses to a 90 degrees head-up tilt in SHR and did not influence cardiac output in conscious SHR. In addition, flavodilol did not appear to manifest its antihypertensive activity through an interaction with beta-adrenoceptors, dopamine (DA) receptors or prostaglandin synthetase. Daily oral administration of flavodilol to SHR for 4 days resulted in augmented vasopressor responses to exogenously administered epinephrine (EPI) or norepinephrine (NE) and attenuated responses to exogenously administered tyramine. In addition, flavodilol treatment attenuated in a dose-related manner ABP and heart rate (HR) responses of pithed SHR to electrical stimulation of sympathetic nerves. We conclude that flavodilol is an effective antihypertensive drug which decreases the release of NE from postganglionic sympathetic nerves, resulting in attenuation of peripheral noradrenergic function.", 
    "54": "beta- And alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist properties of bufuralol, carvedilol, celiprolol, dilevalol, labetalol, and pindolol were investigated in human myocardium and mammary artery using binding techniques and functional studies. In myocardial membranes, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists showed monophasic competition isotherms for [125I]pindolol binding with high affinity (Ki from 1-100 nM), except for celiprolol which displayed a biphasic competition isotherm (pKi = 6.4 +/- 0.06 for beta 1- and 4.8 +/- 0.07 for beta 2-adrenoceptors). Drug interactions with alpha 1-adrenoceptors were evaluated in human mammary artery by [3H]prazosin binding and by measuring contractile responses to norepinephrine (NE). Labetalol and carvedilol showed a moderate affinity for alpha 1-adrenoceptors (pKi = 6.2 +/- 0.01 and 6.1 +/- 0.06, respectively), and inhibited NE-induced contractions (pA2 = 6.93 +/- 0.23 and 8.64 +/- 0.24, respectively). Dilevalol, bufuralol, and pindolol displayed weak effect both in binding (Ki in micromolar range) and functional experiments (pA2 = 5.98, 5.54, and 6.23, respectively). Celiprolol did not show antagonist properties up to 100 microM in functional studies, but displayed a slight affinity for alpha 1-adrenoceptors in binding studies. The data indicate that the vasodilating activity of these beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is caused in some instances by an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonism (labetalol, carvedilol), whereas for the others alternative mechanisms should be considered.", 
    "55": "Acute ischemic left ventricular failure was induced in dogs by coronary embolization with plastic microspheres, resulting in reduced cardiac output (CO), increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP), and total peripheral resistance (TPR). Intravenous (i.v.) administration of alifedrine, a beta-adrenergic partial agonist (0.3 mg/kg as bolus and 0.3 mg/kg/h as infusion), significantly improved performance of the failing heart. Left ventricular contractility was increased up to 50%, heart rate (HR) up to 28%, and CO up to 30%. LVEDP, PCP, and TPR were markedly decreased. Myocardial oxygen consumption was increased only to a minor degree despite the positive inotropic effect; coronary flow was augmented up to 26%. Thus, alifedrine in this model markedly improved left ventricular function by balanced stimulation of the myocardium and reduction of pre- and afterload.",

Effects of (+/-)-1-(4-amino-3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-2-tert.- butylamino-ethanol hydrochloride (mabuterol) on pacemaker activity and atrial contractility were investigated in the isolated and blood-perfused right atrium of the dog. 2. Mabuterol, injected into the sinus node artery of the isolated atrium, dose-dependently increased atrial rate and contractile force at doses of 0.01-10 nmol but the responses to over 10 nmol of mabuterol gradually decreased and mabuterol at higher doses induced biphasic cardiac responses, i.e., negative followed by positive cardiac responses. 3. The maximal increases in atrial rate and contractile force induced by mabuterol were 41.4% and 12.9%, respectively, of the maximal chronotropic and inotropic effects of isoprenaline. 4. Positive chronotropic and inotropic responses to mabuterol were dose-dependently inhibited by a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551. These responses were only slightly attenuated by atenolol. 5. Mabuterol (1-300 nmol) dose-dependently inhibited both dobutamine- and procaterol-induced positive chronotropic and inotropic responses. 6. These results indicate that mabuterol causes weak positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the perfused canine right atrium by activating beta 2-adrenoceptors, and that higher concentrations non-selectively block both beta 1-and beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "57": "A random national survey of 50 general practitioners was undertaken to ascertain current trends in the pharmacological management of hypertension. Forty general practitioners entered the study, and scripts written by them over a two month period in 1988 were collected and recorded by the pharmaceutical pricing offices of the health department. The general practitioners provided details on whether the script had been written for hypertension, as well as the age and sex of the patients. Information from 37 general practitioners was available for study, involving 2675 scripts written for hypertension for 1858 patients. Sixty point two percent of the treated hypertensives were female, and 58.9% were aged over 60 years. The most commonly prescribed antihypertensives were the diuretics (47.1% of patients) and beta blockers (47.9%). They were followed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (18.2%) and calcium antagonists (9.7%). There was substantial variability in the prescription of antihypertensives with respect to the age and sex of the patients treated; the mean costs and duration of supply of different generic drug types; and the prescribing habits of general practitioners. By generic type, the mean monthly costs of therapy ranged from $3.77 (diuretics) to $48.19 (calcium antagonists). The age and sex adjusted geometric mean script costs ranged from $17.78 to $49.11 per month (median: $29.30). It seems unlikely that the observed degree of variability is explained by differences in the severity of hypertension between general practice populations.", 
    "58": "All four subunits of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) are labeled by the lipid-soluble photolabel 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine [( 125I]TID) with different stoichiometries and levels of saturable modification sites, dependent on the conformational state of the AChR. This probe is specific for hydrophobic targets such as the membrane-spanning regions of intrinsic proteins. In the resting state, the gamma subunit is labeled 4.5 times greater and the beta and delta subunits 1.65-1.69 greater than the alpha subunit. Carbamylcholine-induced desensitization of the AChR lowers the level and alters the stoichiometry of [125I]TID incorporation into each subunit. This effect is shown to be specific in two ways. First, it is eliminated by prior equilibration with excess alpha-bungarotoxin, which does not change the [125I]TID-labeling pattern of the AChR from that of the resting state. Second, bacteriorhodopsin is labeled by [125I]TID to the same extent both in the presence and absence of carbamylcholine. The noncompetitive blocker phencyclidine does not alter [125I]TID labeling of the AChR relative to the resting state. The 43-kDa protein, which is believed to cross-link the AChR to the cytoskeleton at the synapse, is not modified by [125I]TID, in agreement with earlier conclusions that the 43-kDa protein is not an intrinsic membrane protein.", 
    "59": "Nicorandil was compared with placebo, propranolol and low and high doses of diltiazem therapy in 12 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris to elucidate its antianginal mechanism. A computer-assisted treadmill exercise test was performed after administration of either placebo, 30 mg of nicorandil, 40 mg of propranolol, or low-dose 60 and high-dose 120 mg of diltiazem. Exercise duration and time to the onset of ischemia were significantly increased after each drug administration and there was no significant difference in the percent increase in exercise duration between nicorandil (44 +/- 7%), propranolol (47 +/- 11%) and high-dose diltiazem (39 +/- 5%) compared with placebo. Nicorandil increased exercise duration in patients with 1-vessel disease more effectively (7.5 +/- 0.7 minutes, p less than 0.05) than either propranolol or low-dose diltiazem (6.7 +/- 0.7, 6.1 +/- 0.9 minutes, respectively). The decrease in blood pressure obtained with nicorandil was approximately the same as that with diltiazem. Nicorandil increased exercise duration associated with higher peak double product compared with low-dose diltiazem. In contrast, high-dose diltiazem increased exercise duration at the same double product as low-dose diltiazem. Propranolol increased exercise duration at a lower level of peak double product. Because our previous study demonstrated that low-dose diltiazem yielded a plasma concentration high enough to reduce coronary tone, it appears unlikely that nicorandil will reduce coronary tone further and subsequently increased coronary reserve. Therefore, left ventricular preload reduction may be the mechanism responsible for higher values of double product obtained with nicorandil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "Newborn rat glial cells were established in primary culture for greater than or equal to 3 weeks under conditions previously reported to permit differentiation of cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity. The cells were incubated for 48h with 3-H-Mevalonolactone in presence of Mevinolin (avoiding isotopic dilution of endogenous origin) and aminoglutethimide, a blocker of cholesterol side-chain cleavage. Radioactive steroid synthesis was then allowed to proceed in absence of aminoglutethimide, for 16h in presence of Trilostane, an inhibitor of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase precluding formation of delta 4-3-ketosteroids. 3H-cholesterol accounted for approximately 10 percent of the radioactivity in cell extracts. 3H-delta 5-pregnene-3 beta, 20 alpha-diol (20-OH P) was the major steroid produced and was released in the culture medium.

    "61": "The dose-dependent inhibition of thrombin stimulated platelet aggregation due to beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs followed the rank order of potency: propranolol greater than alprenolol greater than metipranolol and correlated with arachidonic acid (3H-AA) liberation. Atenolol which slightly potentiated stimulated aggregation increased also the liberation of 3H-AA from membrane phospholipids of isolated platelets. Stimulation of platelets resulted in decreased 3H-AA incorporation into phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic acid and increased incorporation into phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. Alprenolol, metipranolol and propranolol enhanced the incorporation of 3H-AA into phosphatidylcholine of stimulated platelets.", 
    "62": "Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase has been incorporated into isolated rat submandibular acini by hypotonic swelling. This resulted in complete inhibition of the cyclic AMP rise stimulated by isoproterenol (10 microM), but had no effect on the stimulation of mucin secretion. Acini swollen in the absence of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase showed similar cyclic AMP and mucin secretion responses to those of unswollen acini. The dissociation between cyclic AMP rise and mucin secretion was not due to stimulation of different beta-receptor subtypes since both responses to isoproterenol were inhibited by the beta 1 antagonist atenolol, but not by the beta 2 antagonist, butoxamine. The results are the first to directly demonstrate that a maximally effective concentration of isoproterenol can increase mucin secretion in the absence of a detectable increase in cyclic AMP.", 
    "63": "These experiments evaluated the contribution of alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation to plasma renin activity (PRA) during early and long-term dietary sodium restriction, compared with normal sodium intake. Uninephrectomized conscious dogs with catheters in the aorta, vena cava, and remaining renal artery were studied during normal sodium diet (approximately 70 meq/day), after 2-3 days of low-sodium diet (5-7 meq/day), and after greater than or equal to 2 wk of low-sodium diet. Direct renal arterial (ira) infusion of phenoxybenzamine plus propranolol decreased PRA by similar proportions (39-48%) during all three states of dietary sodium intake. The PRA achieved after adrenergic blockade remained higher (P less than 0.05) during early and long-term sodium restriction than during normal sodium intake. The effect on PRA of ira infusion of propranolol alone was not different from that of phenoxybenzamine plus propranolol during normal or low-sodium diet, and the magnitude of decrease in PRA during low-sodium diet was the same whether propranolol (1 microgram.kg-1.min-1) was infused ira or intravenously. In summary, beta-adrenergic stimulation accounts for similar proportions of PRA during early and long-term dietary sodium restriction and during normal sodium intake. Renal alpha-adrenoceptors appear to play little or no role in control of PRA under these conditions.", 
    "64": "The present study evaluated the involvement of opioidergic and catecholaminergic mechanisms in the hypotensive action of pindolol. Pindolol (1 mg/kg i.a.) was administered to unanesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats instrumented for direct arterial pressure monitoring. Peripheral administration of pindolol produced a significant decrease in blood pressure in both SHR and WKY rats with SHR animals having a greater response. Heart rate was reduced in SHR; however, a tachycardia was observed in WKY rats. Pretreatment with naloxone (100 micrograms/kg i.a.) 10 min prior to pindolol administration prevented the hypotensive response. Similar pretreatment with yohimbine, an alpha 2-receptor antagonist, also prevented the pindolol-induced hypotensive response in both SHR and WKY rats. Neither naloxone nor yohimbine alone significantly affected blood pressure or heart rate. These results suggest that opioidergic and catecholaminergic mechanisms are involved in the hypotensive action of pindolol.",

Young normotensive volunteers (n = 6) and elderly normotensive volunteers (n = 12) received single 400- and 200-mg doses of dilevalol, respectively. Renal function was determined in these subjects on the same day before and after dosing. In addition, patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (n = 11) and hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency (n = 6) were treated with placebo to establish baseline blood pressure and then were given dilevalol, 400 to 1,600 mg/day, for 2 to 6 weeks until blood pressure was controlled. Renal function was determined at the end of the baseline period and again at the end of dilevalol treatment. A subgroup of elderly hypertensives from the 2 protocols used to study hypertensive patients was treated as a separate study group. The only effect on parameters of renal function seen in any of the study groups was a statistically significant 15% decrease in glomerular filtration rate after single-dose treatment in the elderly normotensive group. Effective renal plasma flow, filtration fraction, renal blood flow and renal vascular resistance were unchanged before and after treatment in all groups. Mean arterial pressure was reduced significantly in all groups except in the elderly normotensive volunteers. Dilevalol appears to be a well-tolerated, effective therapeutic agent that is neutral regarding its effect on renal function and potentially useful in a variety of patient populations.",

After a 2- to 3-week placebo washout period, 9 patients were given dilevalol titrated upward from 100 to 600 mg twice daily over a 7-week period to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg with a decrease of greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg from baseline. Multigated radionuclide ventriculography and systolic and diastolic time intervals were performed after the pretreatment placebo washout, at the end of 2 weeks' maintenance dosing, and after a 7- to 10-day post-treatment discontinuation and placebo washout period. At an average daily dose of dilevalol, 444 mg, heart rate at rest decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) during treatment and increased during post-treatment placebo. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures at rest decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) during treatment and increased during post-treatment placebo. At maximal exercise, changes in blood pressure and heart rate were significantly blunted (p less than 0.05) during treatment. Ejection fraction at rest increased significantly (p less than 0.01) during treatment, with no significant change occurring during exercise, and decreased during post-treatment placebo. Preejection period decreased significantly during treatment (p less than 0.005) and increased during post-treatment placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "The hemodynamic effects of dilevalol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent with vasodilating properties, were evaluated in 34 hypertensive patients and compared with those of the \"cardioselective\" beta blockers atenolol and metoprolol in 21 patients. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained at baseline, after acute treatment (first dose) with dilevalol (400 mg) and atenolol (50 mg) or metoprolol (100 mg), and again after subchronic treatment with these agents. After both acute and subchronic treatment (mean daily dose 1,042 mg), dilevalol significantly reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP, p less than 0.0001), by significantly reducing systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI, p less than 0.001), and by not significantly altering cardiac index (CI). In contrast, atenolol and metoprolol significantly reduced MAP (p less than 0.002) by significantly reducing CI (p less than 0.0001), with a concomitant increase in SVRI (p less than 0.007). Heart rate (HR) was reduced significantly less (p less than 0.006) with dilevalol than with the cardioselective agents. Correlation of the decrease in MAP with other hemodynamic parameters revealed that the effects on MAP of acute treatment with the cardioselective drugs are related to a decrease in HR (r = 0.63, p = 0.002), whereas those of subchronic treatment are correlated to a decrease in CI (r = 0.59, p = 0.01). The decrease in MAP after acute and subchronic dilevalol treatment is correlated primarily with SVRI (r = 0.46 to 0.49, p less than 0.01) and only secondarily with HR (r = 0.34, p less than 0.05). Therefore, the main mechanism of antihypertensive action for dilevalol is vasodilation, in contrast to the cardioselective agents, which is beta blockade.", 
    "69": "Dilevalol is a long-acting antihypertensive drug that has been demonstrated in animals to combine specific beta 2-agonist-mediated vasodilation with nonspecific beta blockade. To document vasodilation in humans, single oral doses of dilevalol, 200 mg, and placebo were randomly administered to 12 untreated hypertensive patients. Dilevalol produced significant reductions (p less than or equal to 0.01) in diastolic blood pressure throughout a 24-hour period relative to placebo, without changing heart rate. Forearm blood flow, measured hourly over the initial 4 hours after dosing, demonstrated a shift to a more vasodilated state after dilevalol administration, with significant increases in minimal forearm blood flow (4.0 vs 2.9 ml/dl tissue/min, dilevalol vs placebo, respectively; p = 0.05) and in mean average forearm blood flow (5.3 vs 4.0 ml/dl tissue/min, dilevalol vs placebo; p = 0.04). Similarly, dilevalol produced a decrease in mean forearm vascular resistance (26.5 vs 34.6 mm Hg/ml/dl tissue/min, dilevalol vs placebo; p = 0.02). In the absence of a change in heart rate, the acute hypotensive response to dilevalol in these patients appears to have resulted primarily from vasodilation and reduced vascular resistance.",

To determine the relation of dilevalol dose and plasma concentration to antihypertensive effect, dilevalol (n = 15) or placebo (n = 3) was administered to 18 hypertensive subjects. The study was performed under blinded conditions during a 21-day hospitalization after a 3-week drug-free outpatient phase. In the 15 hypertensive patients receiving dilevalol orally in single morning doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg each for 5 days, the drug was shown to reduce blood pressure effectively for 24 hours at all doses. The antihypertensive effect was significantly related to dose administered and to the concentration of unchanged dilevalol measured in plasma. Dilevalol did not cause excessive changes in heart rate at rest and did not produce postural hypotension. The antihypertensive effectiveness of dilevalol was essentially the same after the first and fifth (steady state) doses at each dose level. Finally, no tendency toward rebound hypertension or tachycardia was observed after the abrupt discontinuation of dilevalol in these patients.",

Two multicenter, double-blind studies were performed: study 1 compared dilevalol administered once-daily with either dilevalol or propranolol every 12 hours; study 2 compared dilevalol administered once daily with placebo. Both studies had a placebo run-in period to establish that the baseline supine diastolic blood pressures were consistent in the mild to moderate severity range (95 to 115 mm Hg) at 2 consecutive visits for study 1 and in the mild severity range (95 to 105 mm Hg) in study 2. Patients then were randomized to the double-blind titration phase, during which doses were titrated over a 9-week period to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg and a decrease from baseline of greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg. Patients were then maintained on a fixed dose for 2 months (study 1) or for 1 month (study 2). Dilevalol given once daily was as effective in reducing supine diastolic blood pressure as dilevalol every 12 hours and propranolol every 12 hours (study 1) and was superior to placebo (p less than 0.001) (study 2). In both studies, dilevalol given once daily was effective and well tolerated. The side-effect profile of dilevalol was similar to that of placebo and different from that of propranolol. Treatment with dilevalol resulted in significantly less fatigue (p less than 0.05), bradycardia (less than 50 beats/minute) and mental depression than with propranolol, but significantly (p less than 0.05) more diarrhea/loose stools.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "Recordings of pressure in the brachial or peripheral arteries fail to disclose the marked increase in systolic pressure that occurs in the proximal aorta and central arteries with increasing age and with hypertension. This systolic pressure boost is caused by wave reflection returning from the periphery of the body while the ventricle is still contracting. Such early wave reflection is caused in turn by increased pulse-wave velocity, attributable to stiffening of the aorta and major conduit arteries. Drugs have little effect on arterial stiffening, whereas wave reflection can be markedly reduced by agents that dilate peripheral arteries. Such reduction in wave reflection causes substantial decrease of systolic pressure in central arteries. Because of differential timing of wave reflection, however, such reduction is not apparent from pressure recordings taken in the brachial or other peripheral arteries. The sphygmomanometer, therefore, fails to show the favorable effects of reduced wave reflection in the proximal aorta and central arteries. Noninvasive tonometric pressure wave recordings can supplement the sphygmomanometer to assess the magnitude of beneficial effect.", 
    "73": "In an open study that was conducted in general practice, 22 patients with previously-untreated mild hypertension received an average daily dose of 11.7 mg of pindolol over a 50-week study period. The total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein fraction and plasma triglyceride levels showed no significant change from baseline values at the conclusion of this period. A separate group of 18 patients were treated with 10 mg of pindolol a day for 12 weeks, to which regimen was added 5 mg of clopamide for the succeeding 38 weeks. A small rise in total plasma cholesterol levels in this group of patients at both 12 and 50 weeks did not achieve statistical significance, and no change was observed in either the high-density lipoprotein fraction or the plasma triglyceride levels. These results which were obtained in general practice and over a prolonged period of time accord with the general view that the treatment of hypertension with pindolol, a beta-receptor blocking drug with partial agonist activity, is not associated with either the increases in total plasma cholesterol levels or the falls in the high-density lipoprotein fraction that have been reported with other beta-blocking compounds.", 
    "74": "The present-day optimal treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is reviewed. The prehospital phase should be as brief as possible. Emergency observation and treatment in hospital should be initiated without delay. Schematic stages for mobilization have been discarded and free mobilization is recommended. Routine acute intervention with thrombolysis is recommended for patients in whom symptoms have been present for 6-12 hours and treatment with Aspirin is recommended. Beta-blocking agents are recommended for patients with increased risk after discharge. Treatment of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, block and cardiac failure are reviewed in detail. Patients without complications should be monitored for three to five days and may be discharged after seven to ten days. Exercise ECG should be carried out at discharge to assess the working capacity, ischaemia and subjective reaction. The importance of good patient information is emphasized. Cessation of smoking, control of lipids and blood pressure are important as secondary interventions. As far as possible, outpatient control should be offered after discharge. The criteria for referral to specialized cardiological departments are established both for emergency and elective referral. Patients under the age of 70 years with high risk for repeated AMI or death after discharge (with residual ischaemia) should possibly be referred for coronary arteriography.", 
    "75": "Using serial M-mode echocardiographic determinations of left ventricular (LV) mass and function, the effects of dilevalol, a selective beta 2 agonist with nonselective beta-antagonist properties, were compared with those of metoprolol in 2 centers in double-blind, randomized clinical trials using similar protocols in nonelderly hypertensive patients (aged less than 65 years) (study 1). In a separate bicenter study with a similar design, dilevalol was compared with atenolol in elderly hypertensive patients (aged greater than or equal to 65 years) (study 2). Patients in both studies received placebo for 2 to 4 weeks, and were then randomized to receive increasing doses of dilevalol (200, 400, 800, 1,600 mg) or metoprolol (100, 200, 300, 400 mg) in study 1, and dilevalol (100, 200, 400, 800 mg) or atenolol (50, 100 mg) in study 2, to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) of less than 90 mm Hg. In both studies, LV function and mass (Penn convention) were determined by echocardiographic examinations performed before randomization and at the end of the active treatment phase. Dilevalol, metoprolol and atenolol significantly reduced BP compared with placebo. In the nonelderly patients, a modest reduction in LV mass was observed with dilevalol (p less than 0.03) but not with metoprolol. Indexes of LV function--as assessed by end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions, LV ejection time and ejection fraction--were better preserved by dilevalol than by metoprolol. In the elderly, neither dilevalol nor atenolol affected LV mass; however, indexes of LV function were better preserved with dilevalol than with atenolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "76": "Dilevalol combines vasodilation due to selective beta 2 agonism and nonselective beta antagonism. We studied 311 patients randomized to dilevalol and 138 to metoprolol in a multicenter trial. After a 4-week placebo washout, dilevalol was titrated from 200 to 1,600 mg once daily and metoprolol from 100 to 400 mg to a goal supine diastolic blood pressure less than 90 and greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg decrease from baseline. Responders were followed for 1 year. The average age of patients was 51 years; 72% were men and 54% were white. Both drugs reduced blood pressure effectively to a similar level. Fewer patients discontinued dilevalol than did those taking metoprolol (9 vs 16%; p less than 0.03). More metoprolol-treated patients withdrew because of depression (6 vs less than 1%; p = 0.03) and impotence (5 vs less than 1%; p = 0.03).

    "77": "Dilevalol is a vasodilator with selective partial beta 2 agonism and nonselective beta-antagonist activity. In contrast to its potent beta 2-agonist activity, dilevalol is essentially devoid of beta 1-agonist action, and is therefore distinct from pindolol and celiprolol. Dilevalol inhibits beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors nonselectively in dogs, rats and in isolated tissues, including human myocardium, and its beta-antagonist potency is similar to that of propranolol. In contrast to its beta-antagonist activity, it exerts minimal if any alpha-adrenergic blockade. Dilevalol is 300- to 1,000-fold more potent at beta- than at alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, including those on human myocardium and mammary arteries. At antihypertensive and vasodilator doses in rats and dogs, dilevalol does not inhibit alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. Oral doses of 2.5 to 50 mg/kg of dilevalol reduce blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Heart rate is not significantly affected. Tolerance does not develop to the antihypertensive response. In contrast, beta blockers such as propranolol do not reduce blood pressure in this model. Antihypertensive activity is also observed in dogs with renal hypertension. The hemodynamic profile of dilevalol is consistent with its vasodilator properties. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, antihypertensive doses of dilevalol reduce peripheral resistance without affecting cardiac output. Dilevalol also improves the compliance and distensibility of the large arteries. The vasodilator and antihypertensive responses to dilevalol are mediated by a partial agonist action at vascular beta 2 receptors, because they are inhibited by the nonselective beta blocker propranolol as well as the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551.", 
    "78": "In 6 patients with untreated hypertension of mild or moderate degree, dilevalol was infused in the brachial artery. Doses were calculated to produce plasma levels approximating those achieved after oral dosing (0.03, 0.07, 0.1, 0.3 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and also to produce plasma levels exceeding oral dosing (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) without causing any blood pressure or heart rate changes. The effects of the infusion on forearm blood flow were assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography. Dilevalol caused a progressive increase in flow in all subjects up to the intermediate dose given, with the effect being attenuated when the dose was increased further. Simultaneous propranolol infusion reduced the increase in flow induced by dilevalol, shifting the dilevalol-induced vasodilation dose response curve to the right. Isoproterenol infusion caused a marked, dose-related increase in flow that was equally well reduced by simultaneous infusion of dilevalol or propranolol. These results indicate that dilevalol effectively blocks peripheral vascular beta receptors in humans. The drug also acts as a partial beta 2-receptor agonist, causing vasodilation which can be reduced by co-administration of propranolol.", 
    "79": "This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of the efficacy and safety of dilevalol, 200 mg (n = 86), compared with enalapril, 20 mg (n = 92), administered once daily to patients with mild hypertension. Three weeks of placebo washout were followed by 4 weeks of comparative treatment. Beginning with the first week of treatment, both drugs substantially decreased blood pressure from baselines of approximately 160/100 mm Hg. Decreases in systolic pressure were comparable throughout treatment, but dilevalol tended to have a greater effect on diastolic pressure. At the end of double-blind treatment, average decreases in blood pressure with dilevalol and enalapril were 16/13 and 16/11 mm Hg supine and 15/13 and 15/10 mm Hg standing (p = 0.03 for between-group comparisons of standing diastolic pressure). More dilevalol- than enalapril-treated patients achieved a diastolic pressure less than 90 mm Hg; 73 vs 55% (p = 0.02) supine, and 69 vs 43% (p less than 0.01) standing. The safety profiles of the 2 drugs were comparable. The incidence of adverse effects was low, and few patients discontinued treatment. Headache and gastrointestinal discomfort were reported in both groups. Average postural changes in blood pressure were similar to baseline. Electrocardiographic changes were rare and not treatment related. Changes in laboratory test results were minor. Heart rate decreased modestly with dilevalol relative to enalapril (6 vs 2 to 3 beats/min; p less than 0.01), but no bradycardia was observed.", 
    "80": "The acute hemodynamic and humoral responses to intravenous dilevalol (10 to 390 mg) were evaluated in 10 patients with moderate hypertension. Dilevalol, in doses of 30 mg or more, decreased arterial pressure (p less than 0.0001) through a decrease in total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.0001) associated with an increase in stroke volume and cardiac output (p less than 0.0001). Heart rate increased moderately at doses above 190 mg. Plasma norepinephrine levels increased (p less than 0.05), but epinephrine levels remained unchanged. Plasma renin activity and level of atrial natriuretic peptide decreased (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.01, respectively). The hypotensive and humoral changes persisted 3 hours after the last dose. Dilevalol modified the pattern of hemodynamic response to isometric stress, slightly enhancing the increases in peripheral resistance and blunting increases in cardiac output and heart rate. The response in arterial pressure during administration of dilevalol remained similar to that seen in the pretreatment phase. The results show that dilevalol, when given intravenously in a dose of 30 to 90 mg, reduces arterial pressure by reducing total peripheral resistance without acceleration in heart rate. On the basis of these hemodynamic effects, dilevalol should be further evaluated for treatment of hypertensive emergencies.", 
    "81": "Heat production changes were recorded in anesthetized female Sprague-Dawley rats after stimulation of orbital frontal neocortex. The results obtained show that orbital frontal neocortex stimulation significantly increases oxygen consumption, and core and brown adipose tissue temperature. The increase was more substantial after stimulation of left than right cortex. Administration of the beta-blocker propranolol abolished the increase in O2 consumption, core and brown adipose tissue temperature following cortical stimulation. These results are in agreement with our previous research showing that functional ablation of cerebral cortex blocked the increase in thermogenesis following lateral hypothalamic lesion. These findings also show that the orbital frontal neocortex in rats is specifically involved in the control of thermogenesis.", 
    "82": "The mechanism of action of PTIQ in lowering the arterial blood pressure in the anesthetized dog was studied using pharmacological and physiological techniques. The hypotensive activity of PTIQ was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with bilateral vagotomy, propranolol, prazosin and mecamylamine. Pretreatment with either yohimbine or reserpine had no significant effect on PTIQ activity. PTIQ produced a significant decrease in the force of contraction of myocardial tissue and a transient increase in the aortic blood flow of the anesthetized dog. These results indicate a multiplicity of action of PTIQ in controlling arterial blood pressure.", 
    "83": "An assessment of antiarrhythmic efficiency of obsidan by means of repeated 24-hour ECG monitoring with tape recording was made in 42 patients with a documented anterior transmural and macrofocal myocardial infarction. A marked and significant antiarrhythmic effect of obsidan was demonstrated with respect to most arrhythmias, particularly high-grade ventricular extrasystoles. The drug is shown to have a favorable effect on the size of the peri-infarction++ area. A moderate negative inotropic effect of obsidan did not provoke clinical signs of heart failure. In the absence of contraindications, obsidan is recommended for use since the very first days of myocardial infarction.",

Clinical and biochemical euthyroidism was seen in both groups at 6 weeks; no effect of nadolol on peripheral monodeiodination of T4 to T3 was observed. At time 0 there were significant negative correlations between total cholesterol and free T3 (r = 0.68), and free T4 (r = 0.54). In the Nadolol group there were significant rises between 0 and 6 weeks in total cholesterol (52.6%, P less than 0.01), LDL cholesterol (30.3%, P less than 0.01) and HDL cholesterol (18.2%, P less than 0.05). HDL cholesterol rose significantly in the placebo group (12.4%, P less than 0.05) but there were no significant increases in LDL cholesterol or total cholesterol. The rise in triglyceride during this period in the Nadolol group (64.7%, P less than 0.05) was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than the rise in the placebo group (8.8%). Nadolol increases triglyceride more than placebo during the early management of hyperthyroidism.", 
    "85": "We used a heart rate memory apparatus to measure 2047 successive R-R intervals with an accuracy of 10 msec in adult goats. For 100 successive stationary R-R intervals out of the 2047 intervals, the R-R intervals sequence was recorded graphically and the means and standard deviations (SD) were calculated. The magnitude of the variation in the R-R intervals was represented by the SD. The usefulness of the analysis of R-R intervals as an indicator of autonomic nervous activity was determined. The diagram of 100 successive R-R intervals at rest showed a conspicuous periodic fluctuation. After the administration of atropine, atropine plus propranolol or after feeding, the R-R intervals were markedly shortened and the variations in the R-R intervals were abolished. After the administration of propranolol only, the R-R intervals were prolonged and the amplitude of the fluctuations in the R-R intervals was conspicuously increased. The respiration curve and the variation in the R-R intervals at rest fluctuated in periodic synchrony. A positive correlation between the mean and the SD of the R-R intervals was highly significant. This indicates that the variations in the R-R intervals in the adult goats are closely related to autonomic nervous activity and that the analysis of the R-R intervals is suitable for the noninvasive assessment of autonomic nervous activity.", 
    "86": "Fifteen patients with chronic stable angina pectoris and a history of reduced exercise tolerance in cold weather (cold intolerance) underwent symptom limited treadmill exercise tests at 20 degrees C and 0 degrees C in a specially constructed cold chamber while taking no antianginal medication. Their mean time to onset of angina (5.8 v 4.2 min), to 1 mm ST depression (5.1 v 3.8 min), and to peak exercise (7.4 v 5.7 min) was significantly shorter on exercise at 0 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. The double product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure at each of these end points was the same in both exercise tests. Eight of these patients were treated with nifedipine 10 mg three times a day for two weeks and then with propranolol 40 mg three times a day for another two weeks. Repeat exercise testing was performed at the end of each two week treatment period. The mean time (SD) to peak exercise at the end of the nifedipine treatment period was 9.1 (2.0) min at 20 degrees C and 8.5 (2.3) min at 0 degrees C. The double product at peak exercise was the same for both exercise tests. At the end of the propranolol treatment period the mean time to peak exercise was significantly less at 0 degrees C (7.8 (2.6) min) than at 20 degrees C (8.9 (2.4) min). The double product at peak exercise was the same for both exercise tests but was significantly less than that on nifedipine. Cold intolerance was shown in patients with a positive history by symptom limited treadmill exercise testing at 0 degrees C. It persisted when they were treated with propranolol, albeit to a lesser extent, but not when they were treated with nifedipine.", 
    "87": "The effects of propafenone on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propranolol were evaluated in 12 healthy male subjects. Both propafenone and propranolol were each administered alone for one week followed by concomitant administration for an additional week. Blood samples, obtained at steady-state, were analyzed for propafenone and its two metabolites as well as for propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol. Left ventricular function, exercise performance and electrocardiographic intervals were assessed. Coadministration of propranolol did not produce any significant change in propafenone kinetics including peak plasma concentration (Cmax), time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax), elimination rate constant (t1/2), mean steady-state plasma concentration (Css), or area under the concentration vs time curves. However, concomitant propafenone administration significantly increased Cmax (83%), Tmax (55%), t1/2 (30%), and Css (213%) which were accompanied by significant decreases in plasma levels of 4-hydroxy-propranolol. Propafenone and propranolol significantly reduced supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2.5 to 15.4%. The combination did not reduce diastolic blood pressure further (64.0 +/- 2.8 to 59.7 +/- 1.7 mmHg) nor did it produce a supplemental reduction in heart rate (12% reduction with propranolol, 10% reduction with concomitant administration). Propranolol, but not propafenone, significantly decreased end-diastolic volume index (13%), stroke volume index (15%), and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (19%). The combination did not cause any further changes in echocardiographic measurements. Electrocardiographic intervals were not altered by either drug use alone or in combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
