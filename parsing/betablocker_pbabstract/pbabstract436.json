In the study reported here we examined ocular damage in monkeys (M. mulatta and M. fascicularis) following topical treatment with one of two ophthalmic drugs (timolol maleate and pilocarpine) that preceded exposure to pulsed microwaves. Anesthetized monkeys were sham exposed or exposed to pulsed, 2.45 GHz microwaves (10 microseconds, 100 pps) at average power densities of 0.2, 1, 5, 10, or 15 mW/cm2 4 h a day for 3 consecutive days (respective SARs were 0.052, 0.26, 1.3, 2.6, and 3.9 W/kg). Immediately before microwave exposure, one or both eyes were treated topically with one drop of 0.5% timolol maleate or of 2% pilocarpine. Following administration of a drug, we observed a significant reduction in the power-density threshold (from 10 to 1 mW/cm2) for induction of corneal endothelial lesions and for increased vascular permeability of the iris. Diagnostic procedures (in vivo specular microscopy and fluorescein iris angiography) were performed following each exposure protocol. In addition, increased vascular permeability was confirmed with horseradish peroxidase tracer techniques. Although we did not measure intraocular temperatures in experimental animals, the results suggest that a mechanism other than significant heating of the eye is involved. Our data indicate that pulsed microwaves at an average SAR of 0.26 W/kg, if administered after pretreatment with ophthalmic drugs, can produce significant ocular effects in the anesthetized primate.",

    "2": "Fifty-six patients with unstable angina, mean age of 55.4 +/- 8.5, 41 men and 15 women, were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of two groups of patients treated with diltiazem or propranolol at total daily doses of 180 mg and 120 mg respectively during the first 48 hours. After that the total daily doses was adjusted to 240 mg and 160 mg, respectively, until the 7th day. The first 48 hours, four times daily, clinical evaluation, CKMB data, ECG were obtained and two times daily until 7th day. A coronary arteriography was done on study entry.", 
    "3": "A significative reduction of angina crisis number, duration, intensity and the number of sublingual nitrates doses were observed equally in both groups. The SAP, DAP, HR and RR did not show statistical differences between groups. Individual groups analysis showed significative reductions of SAP, DAP and HR in propranolol group. The CKMB data, ECG alterations and coronary arteriography characteristics were similar.",

    "5": "A rapid, sensitive and simple high performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of propafenone (PPF) and its metabolites (5-hydroxypropafenone, 5-OHP; N-depropylpropafenone, NDP) in serum has been developed. Separation of PPF, 5-OHP and NDP was achieved by reversed phase chromatography using a mobile phase consisting of 57% methanol and 43% 10 mmol/L potassium dibasic phosphate (pH 2.7) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min on a 5 microns ODS-C18 column. The eluent was monitored at 254 nm. The method showed a good linearity. The recoveries of PPF, 5-OHP and NDP were found to be 99.54 +/- 2.13%, 100.02 +/- 3.66% and 100.48 +/- 3.10%, respectively. Precision studies for both within day and day-to-day at different concentrations provided RSD values of less than 5%. Some commonly used drugs can be determined in the same procedure without interference except phenytoin. This method is well adapted to the therapeutic monitoring of PPF treated patients, as well as for pharmacokinetic studies.", 
    "6": "V-C horizontal diffusion cell has been used to carry out the initial study of timolol across intact and stripped hairless mouse skin and human cadaver skin. Also, we have systematically studied the effect of some factors such as hydration time, medium pH value as well as various transdermal enhancers on the permeability of timolol in vitro. We investigated the determination method of timolol by RP-HPLC using YWG-C18 column with water-acetonitrile-triethylamine (87:13:1) as the mobile phase. The results indicated the feasibility of transdermal absorption of timolol. The permeabilities of timolol raised significantly with properly extending of hydration time, increasing of medium pH and with presence of various kinds of transdermal enhancers. With 10% propylene glycol and 1% azone were used conjunctly, they showed obviously synergistic effects. All these studies contributed theoretically and practically to the further development and utilization of timolol in the form of transdermal patch.", 
    "7": "The protective effects of m-Nif 15, 30 and 50 micrograms.kg-1 and of Nif 30 micrograms.kg-1 on experimental myocardial infarction and metabolism in rabbits were evaluated. Blood samples were collected simultaneously from the femoral artery and the coronary sinus for examining lactate and potassium balance. In the normal group (n = 8) and the sham ligated group (n = 5), the lactate balance were +17 +/- 1.0 and + 13 +/- 1.1% respectively and the potassium balance were +2.1 +/- 0.08 and +2.4 +/- 0.08%, respectively. After occlusion of the LAD, the lactate and K+ balance reduced to -196 +/- 60.2 and -83.0 +/- 8.2% respectively, and m-Nif produced a dose dependent improvement of both balance. After giving m-Nif 15, 30 and 50 micrograms.kg-1 i.v., the lactate balance improved to -60 +/- 9, -48 +/- 6.7 and -24 +/- 1.8% and the K+ balance went up to -32.2 +/- 2.1, -17.6 +/- 0.1, -3.3 +/- 0.06, respectively. In the mean time, Nif 30 micrograms.kg-1 i.v. improved the lactate and K+ balances to -52 +/- 8.6% and -36.4 +/- 3.1%. In another experiment, propranolol 1 mg.kg-1 i.v. improved the lactate balance to -18 +/- 1.2% while the K+ balance increased to +2.0 +/- 0.05%.

    "8": "Nitrendipine (bypress) manufactured by Bayer Company in the form of 10 and 20 mg tablets and administered in a dose of 20-40 mg/day turned out an effective antihypertensive remedy in 65% of patients with arterial hypertension largely running a mild course. The effect of nitrendipine administered in a single daily dose of 20 mg did not differ from that attained with the same dose given in two intakes. The raising of the daily dose of nitrendipine from 20 to 40 mg was associated with augmentation of the hypotensive effect in 43.8% of the patients in whom the treatment in a dose of 20 mg a day had turned out ineffective. Under the conditions of the cross-over method with the use of the reference drugs belonging to three groups of the basic antihypertensive agents (nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide), the hypotensive effect of nitrendipine did not differ from that produced by the drugs under comparison (according to the mean group indicators and individual assessment of the efficacy). The tolerance of nitrendipine administered in a dose of 10 mg twice a day or in a dose of 20 mg once or twice a day was satisfactory.", 
    "9": "The purpose of the study was to explore the dynamics of the concentration of atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) in response to changes in arterial pressure including those induced by hypertonic crisis, 7-day hypotensive monotherapy with the drugs having different action mode, and the acute test with the basic hypotensive drugs. 75 patients suffering from arterial hypertension were entered into the study. Measurements of the concentration of ANH in blood plasma were performed by radioimmunoassay with the aid of the kits manufactured by the Amersham Company (Great Britain). The activity of renin and aldosterone was determined by radioimmunoassay according to the standard technique. A strong positive correlation was revealed between the concentration of ANH and the level of both systolic and diastolic AP. A significant rise of the concentration of ANH elicited by hypertonic crisis reflects the growth of the tension of the depressor mechanisms by which AP is regulated. The lack of significant changes in the level of ANH during the acute pharmacological tests and effective continuous treatment with the hypotensive drugs attests to the existence of the complex mechanisms that regulate ANH secretion, determined not only by the level of AP.", 
    "10": "Renal function was serially investigated during the development of hypertension in a 12.8-year-old girl with chronic glomerulonephritis. Clearances of inulin (CIn) and para-aminohippuric acid (CPAH), filtration fraction, and sodium excretion were measured during hydropenia and isotonic saline volume expansion. Blood pressure was initially labile, but after a few years fixed hypertension developed, and antihypertensive treatment with propranolol was started. During the early stages of hypertension, the filtration fraction during hydropenia was reduced, but the natriuresis during volume expansion was normal. When the hypertension was fixed, glomerular filtration rate, CPAH, and filtration fraction were normal, but the natriuresis was exaggerated. Antihypertensive treatment only partially corrected the natriuresis.", 
    "11": "The effect of timolol, acetazolamide, and the combination of the two drugs on the rate of aqueous formation in 18 healthy human subjects was measured during the day and at night in a placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized study. In the absence of any drugs, aqueous flow during the day was 2.61 +/- 0.82 (mean +/- SD) microliters/min and at night, 1.08 +/- 0.59, a 59% lower flow rate when compared with the daytime value (P < 0.0001). When compared with these aforementioned control values, timolol alone reduced the rate of aqueous flow by 39% (P < 0.0001) in awake subjects but had no statistically significant effect on the flow rate in sleeping subjects (P = 0.33). Acetazolamide alone reduced aqueous flow during the day by 21% compared with the control flow rate (P = 0.02) and at night by 24% below the nocturnal flow rate in the sleeping eye (P = 0.04). The combination of the two drugs reduced flow during the day by an additional 13% (P = 0.024) compared with the flow rate achieved by timolol alone, and by an additional 32% (P < 0.0001) compared with the flow rate reduction attained by acetazolamide alone. There was no statistically significant difference in the nocturnal flow rates achieved by acetazolamide alone or in combination with timolol (P = 0.37). These data confirm previous studies demonstrating the effect of timolol, acetazolamide, and sleep on the rate of aqueous humor formation. Unlike a previous study, it was found that acetazolamide lowers the aqueous flow below the already low nocturnal flow rate that occurs spontaneously in the sleeping eye.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "In the present study equilibrium dialysis has been used to determine the degree of protein binding of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline and the adrenergic receptor blockers, prazosin and propranolol in diabetics. The binding of the catecholamines in plasma from Type I and II diabetic patients was not significantly different from that of healthy subjects. The ratio of the bound and free catecholamine concentrations was correlated with the level of albumin (HSA). Significantly reduced protein binding of prazosin was observed in Type I and II diabetic subjects compared to healthy volunteers. The binding of propranolol was significantly reduced in Type I patients. The ratios between the bound and unbound concentrations of prazosin and propranolol were significantly correlated with the levels of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG). The results suggest that non-enzymatic glycosylation of plasma proteins may increase the unbound fraction of the adrenergic blockers prazosin and propranolol.", 
    "13": "Two noninvasive methods for assessment of the compliance (1/E') of the aortic windkessel in man are presented and were tested for their ability to detect increases in stiffness of the aorta induced by atropine (0.012 and 0.024 mg/kg sequentially) in the presence and absence of a beta-blockade with propranolol 240 mg (n = 9). Method A, based on the calculation of the relation between pulse pressure and systolic storage volume of the aorta, requires measurement of blood pressure, systolic and diastolic time intervals and stroke volume. Method B, based on measurement of pulse wave velocity along the aorta also requires several anthropometric data (body surface area, age). Both methods were able to detect a dose-dependent increase in E' following atropine injections; method A has greater relative changes than method B. The average maximal increases were 90 and 40 percent of the baseline before atropine. The daily baselines of E' averaged 0.6 Torr x cm-3 for method A and 0.9 Torr x cm-3 for method B. Propranolol itself did not influence E' but dampened the atropine effects. The results from method A and B were correlated with r = 0.70 and 0.60 resp. (p < 0.01). The results suggest the use of these relatively simple techniques for evaluation of aortic compliance under influence of varying pathophysiological conditions or/and pharmacological interventions.", 
    "14": "Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is generally defined as a systolic pressure of 160 mmHg or more, with a diastolic pressure cut-off point below 95 mmHg in some studies and 90 mmHg in others. Its prevalence and incidence vary from 3 to 30% depending on the definition applied, methodology of measurement, as well as the population and the age and sex of the patients. Mechanisms that could lead to the development of isolated systolic hypertension are discussed, especially the role of atherosclerosis and sodium intake. Comparing results from different countries, the Intersalt study showed that the age related rise in systolic pressure was positively related to the mean sodium excretion in that country. A post-hoc analysis of data from 4 Belgian groups could not show such a correlation within our country. The risks of systolic hypertension on mortality and morbidity in the elderly are considered. The need for further studies to quantify the risk and to establish the effect of treatment is emphasized. Three such studies in patients above the age of 60 years with ISH were started. The studies are double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and the main purpose is to examine the influence of treatment on morbidity, mortality, and general well-being. In the American SHEP study the patients of the actively treated group received a diuretic and possibly a beta-blocker or reserpine. The results indicate a significant reduction in non fatal stroke, heart failure and myocardial infarction without a significant reduction in fatal stroke, fatal myocardial infarction, cardiovascular or all cause mortality. Studies in other continents are still in progress, such as the Syst-Chin in China and the Syst-Eur trial in Europe. They may indicate whether the results obtained in the U.S.A. can be extrapolated to other continents and whether the use of other drugs without metabolic disturbances, such as calcium entry blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, produce a similar reduction in events. Additional studies are needed to establish the effect of reducing salt intake in younger age groups on the prevalence of ISH and of the related morbidity and mortality.", 
    "15": "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral utilization of oxygen (CMRO2) were studied in anesthetized and artificially ventilated rats during normoxemia and hypoxemia before and during intravenous infusion of a selective blocker of V2 vasopressinergic receptors (d(CH2)5 [D-Ile2,Abu4] AVP, 15 micrograms/kg per hour i.v.). CBF was measured by means of the intracarotid 133-Xe injection method. CMRO2 was calculated from the oxygen arteriovenous difference using the Fick principle. Infusion of V2 antagonist did not influence CBF, CMRO2 or blood pressure (BP) during normoxia. It also did not change the response of cerebral circulation to hypoxemia. Increase in CBF and decrease in cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) during hypoxemia were similar during the infusion of V2 blocker or without it. However, the decrease in BP observed during hypoxemia in the control group of rats was prevented in the group of animals which were infused with V2 blocker.", 
    "16": "Since the peripheral prostaglandin synthetizing system may at least partly involved in the anorexia that follows central interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) administration, this study was undertaken to investigate the effect of ibuprofen (ip), selective cyclooxygenase blocker and AA 861, selective lipoxygenase inhibitor, on changes of food and water intake by a single injection of IL-1 (2 micrograms/rat, ip). We demonstrated that food and water intake were suppressed by peripheral administration of IL-1. Throughout the entire observation periods, suppressed food intake was partially restored to control levels by ibuprofen, while water intake completely restored. In addition, no significant differences about water/food intake were observed in the IL-1 + ibuprofen-treated groups, respectively. In the next experiment, IL-1 induced anorexia was also partially restored to the control level following pretreatment with AA 861. These results may suggest that other mechanism including lipoxygenase blocker besides prostaglandin production may be involved in IL-1 induced anorexia.", 
    "17": "Ocular hypertensive patients were enrolled in a 6-week double-masked safety study of 2% MK-927 (27 patients), a topically active carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, administered bilaterally b.i.d.; 9 additional patients received 0.5% timolol as the control agent. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured weekly prior to a.m. drug administration; twelve hour diurnal curves were performed prestudy and at 3 and 6 weeks. The mean reduction of IOP prior to a.m. drug administration ranged from 1.2 +/- 4.4 mm Hg (SD) to 3.0 +/- 4.2 mm Hg with MK-927 and from 4.7 +/- 3.9 mm Hg to 8.8 +/- 0.6 mm Hg with timolol. Mean outflow facility measured tonographically prestudy and on days 33 to 42 four hours after a.m. drug administration was unchanged in both groups. Corneal sensitivity (Cochet-Bonnet), corneal thickness (ultrasound pachymetry), Schirmer tear testing, and extensive ophthalmologic and medical examinations, and hematologic studies were not substantially altered throughout the study. In this longest chronic administration study to date, MK-927 did not cause adverse ocular or systemic side effects.", 
    "18": "Thirty patients matched for age, parity, socioeconomic status and severity of pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) were randomly allocated to treatment with metoprolol or methyldopa. The average fall in diastolic blood pressure was significant in the group treated with metoprolol as compared with the methyldopa group (p less than 0.01). There were 3 perinatal deaths in the methyldopa group and 1 in the metoprolol group; the mean birth weight of the babies was higher in cases treated with metoprolol. The results suggest metoprolol to be more efficacious with regard to control of hypertension and fetal outcome in cases of pregnancy induced hypertension.", 
    "19": "1. Perindopril (4 mg) was compared with atenolol (50 mg), captopril (25 mg b.d.) or a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg and amiloride 5 mg) in three studies involving a total of 503 hypertensive patients with a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95-125 mmHg. 2. A 4 week single-blind placebo period preceded 12 weeks of active treatment. Dose titration was at weeks 4 and 8 if supine DBP greater than 90 mmHg. The dose was doubled and if necessary a diuretic was added in the atenolol or captopril comparisons, and atenolol was added in the diuretic study. 3. The fall in supine blood pressure (BP) was 27/17 mmHg with perindopril and 21/16 mmHg for atenolol. Monotherapy controlled 55% of patients on perindopril and 48% on atenolol, increasing to 78% and 58% with the addition of hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Captopril caused a BP fall of 19/12 mmHg compared with 27/18 mmHg for perindopril, with 49% of both groups being controlled on monotherapy. 4. Diuretic addition produced a greater antihypertensive effect with perindopril (75%) compared with 57% for captopril in achieving control. Perindopril caused a comparable fall in supine BP to the diuretic combination 27/19 mmHg and 31/18 mmHg, but the fall in erect systolic BP was significantly greater for the diuretic. At 3 months, 85% of the diuretic group and 78% of the perindopril group achieved the target BP. 5. A multicentre trial of 856 patients treated with perindopril (690 patients treated for 1 year or more) has shown that BP control is maintained in the long term with a low incidence of side-effects (7.9%) causing withdrawal from treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "1. Perindopril's effectiveness in mild to moderate hypertension was evaluated in three studies. 2. Perindopril was more effective than sodium restriction in reducing blood pressure, and the effects were additive. 3. Perindopril was as effective as atenolol in reducing blood pressure, and was well tolerated. 4. Perindopril lowered blood pressure to the same extent as enalapril at peak drug levels but had a greater effect at the trough level of the drugs. 5. Perindopril is an effective antihypertensive agent with an acceptable side-effect profile in people with hypertension.", 
    "21": "The effects of propranolol on the myoelectrical activity of the stomach, pylorus and duodenum were investigated in chronic experiments on rabbits. During the first phase of propranolol action a positive gastro-chronotropic effect was accompanied by a negative cardio-chronotropic effect. The gastro-chronotropic effect was 3 times higher than cardio-chronotropic one. The second phase of the propranolol effect manifested with periodical fluctuation of the gastroduodenal myoelectrical activity during stable bradycardia. Marked reactivity of the gastro-duodenum and periodical fluctuation of its activity are evidence of vital importance of the autoregulation mechanisms for gastroduodenal myoelectric activity.", 
    "22": "The effect of propranolol on the prevention of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) due to acute coronary ischaemia was studied in dogs. A series of propranolol-polymer controlled release matrices in slab configuration using various polyurethanes and a polyurethane-silicone rubber copolymer were formulated and characterized. In general, drug release in vitro occurred with an initial burst phase followed by an exponentially declining delivery rate; the silicone rubber containing copolymer preparation had more sustained release properties than did pure polyurethane matrices. In the animal studies, dogs underwent 5-hourly 10 min complete occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), followed by 50 min normal perfusion. During non-drug occlusions VT occurred at a frequency of 1.22 +/- 0.12 episodes/min. A propranolol-polyurethane matrix (30% w/w, 28-42 mg) was placed on the ischaemic zone of the left ventricular epicardium immediately after the fifth occlusion. After an hour of drug delivery a sixth occlusion took place. The number of arrhythmia episodes both before and after drug were quantified and compared. The time to ventricular fibrillation (when present) and the mean blood pressure were also assessed. The drug patch delivered propranolol at a dose of 140 +/- 45 micrograms/kg by the conclusion of the 1 h study period. Therapeutic drug levels were achieved in the peripheral blood samples (8.7-43.7 ng/ml) and were enhanced in coronary venous samples (360.9-556.2 ng/ml). Reduction of blood pressure and proarrhythmic events following epicardial controlled release propranolol administration were noted but were not statistically significant. Arrhythmia episodes before and after propranolol were not found to be significantly different (VT/min 1.02 +/- 0.31 and 1.22 +/- 0.12).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "The possibility that beta-adrenoceptor blockers, especially beta 1-selective agents might inhibit platelet function is of considerable interest, as this might be of pathophysiological importance in cardiovascular diseases. Platelet function, however, is difficult to assess and in vivo related data are scarce. The effect of one week of treatment with metoprolol 200 mg/day on platelet aggregability during mental stress (colour word conflict test; CWT) and low and high dose adrenaline infusions has been evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 10 healthy male volunteers. Platelet function in vivo was assessed using ex vivo filtragometry, and the urinary excretions of beta-thromboglobulin (HMW beta-TG) and 11-dehydro-TxB2 (a thromboxane metabolite). Conventional in vitro aggregometry and the urinary levels of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha (a prostacyclin metabolite) were also studied. During the interventions there was increased platelet aggregability in vivo, as filtragometry readings were shortened by 41 +/- 11% during high dose adrenaline infusion, urinary HMW beta-TG levels increased and urinary 11-dehydro-TxB2 tended to increase. In contrast, platelet sensitivity to ADP in vitro was reduced. The urinary 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels were increased during the interventions. Despite the cardiovascular and biochemical signs of beta-adrenoceptor blockade at rest and during the interventions, metoprolol failed to influence platelet function in vivo, as measured by ex vivo filtragometry, or urinary HMW beta-TG or 11-dehydro-TxB2 levels. It tended rather to enhance the stress response measured by ex vivo filtragometry. Platelet aggregability in vitro and urinary 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels were not altered by metoprolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "The present study aims to answer the following questions: 1. do secretion of volume related hormones in patients with EH pre- and post treatment with propranolol differ from normotensive subjects if examined in thermal dehydration conditions; 2. is the electrolyte composition of thermal sweat related to the plasma profile of volume related hormones? and 3. does treatment by propranolol influence sweat electrolytes in EH patients. In 15 patients with EH and in 20 healthy subjects a thermal dehydration test was performed. In patients with EH this test was done twice: before treatment and after 6 weeks of propranolol therapy. In all subjects the plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (Ald), AVP and ANP were measured before and after thermal dehydration. In sweat samples collected after 15' and 45' of thermal dehydration (the concentration of Na, K and Cl was assessed). In hypertensive patients before propranolol treatment significantly higher values of PRA, Ald and ANP were found, while sweat concentrations of Na and Cl were significantly lower than in controls. After propranolol treatment sweat electrolytes concentrations showed a tendency to normalize. No significant correlation was found between the plasma hormonal profile and sweat Na, K and Cl concentrations respectively both in controls and patients with EH pretreatment. A significant positive correlation was noticed only in hypertensive patients posttreatment between ANP and sweat potassium concentration respectively, and significant negative correlation between PRA and sweat sodium and chloride concentration. From results obtained in this paper it seemed, that volume related hormones (Ald, AVP, ANP) do not seem to influence markedly the electrolyte composition of thermal sweat both in healthy subjects and in hypertensive patients.", 
    "25": "Effective control of variceal rebleeding (secondary prophylaxis) or prevention of the initial bleeding (primary prophylaxis) are the main objectives of the treatment of portal hypertension. Endoscopic sclerotherapy is the treatment of choice for secondary prophylaxis, since it significantly decreases rebleeding and, to some extent, mortality. A combination of propranolol and sclerotherapy may be of benefit by decreasing postsclerotherapy rebleeding. Endoscopic variceal band ligation and transjugular intrahepatic shunt are emerging as useful alternative techniques. Devascularisation and preferably selective shunts should be reserved for use as salvage of sclerotherapy failures. Liver transplantation, if feasible, could become the ultimate therapy by controlling variceal bleeding and improving hepatic function. Pharmacotherapy, while not very successful for secondary prophylaxis, has shown promise for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. Nonselective beta-blockers significantly decrease the rebleeding rates but are associated with only marginal survival benefits. beta-Blockers alone cannot decrease the hepatic venous pressure gradient adequately (to less than 12mm Hg). Combination with nitrates and other drugs may prove beneficial and requires clinical evaluation. Endoscopic sclerotherapy and surgery have little role in primary prevention of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis but need evaluation in noncirrhotic patients.", 
    "26": "Diurnal changes in the neurotransmitter receptors are important for studying the receptor function in neurophysiology. The purpose of this study is to gain an insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the diurnal variation of amylase secretion. Rat salivary amylase levels showed a diurnal variation with two peaks, a marked peak at 13 h and a lesser peak at 21 h. This increase in salivary amylase levels was completely inhibited by pretreatment of rats with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, but not by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine. Amylase level in parotid tissue homogenate also showed a diurnal change, but there was only one peak, at 13 h. The number of maximal binding sites (Bmax) for [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) in parotid membranes showed a diurnal variation with two marked peaks at 13 and 21 h, but the affinity of parotid beta-adrenoceptors for agonists or antagonists did not show any diurnal changes. Phosphorylation of nuclear non-histone proteins in the rat parotid gland showed diurnal variation with two marked peaks at 13 and 21 h. These results indicate that a diurnal variation in the number of rat parotid beta-adrenoceptors, which is presumably regulated by gene expression, is coupled with a change in salivary amylase secretion.", 
    "27": "Examination of central hemodynamics in patients in the preperfusion period of radical correction of Fallot's tetrad has demonstrated that after pericardiotomy and the onset of surgical manipulation on the heart there was a depression of circulation both during the use of intravenous total anesthesia on the basis of ketamine and ataralgesia. The depression was more manifest under ataralgesia. The depression of circulation was paralleled by the deepening of initial hypoxemia. Analysis of the efficacy of medicamentous agents with regard to the specific features of intracardiac anatomy of the outlet of the right ventricle, estimated intraoperatively, has established that administration of phenylephrine at a rate of 3 micrograms/kg favoured an increase of partial oxygen pressure and arterial blood saturation with hemoglobin whatever the anatomo-morphological type of stenosis of the outlet of the right ventricle. Propranolol promoted the improvement of arterial blood oxygenation but in the muscular type stenosis of the outlet of the right ventricle. Meanwhile the use of the drugs possessing a beta-adreno-stimulating effect brought about the deepening of hypoxemia.", 
    "28": "This review mainly considers randomized studies where angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were compared with other antihypertensive drugs in terms of objectively assessed cognitive function, subjectively evaluated cognitive function, work performance, and general vitality. An overall assessment of the data suggests that ACE inhibitors may improve performance on tests of alertness but it is unlikely that they produce either deleterious or beneficial effects on memory. On the other hand, methyldopa interferes with cognitive function and work performance. Propranolol was also associated with impairment of activity and satisfaction at work. In subjective evaluation of cognitive function, two trials suggest an increased reporting of impairment with nifedipine but this has not yet been confirmed. Vitality was reduced on both methyldopa and propranolol. It is concluded that the ACE inhibitors, in common with atenolol and verapamil, do not appear to have any major effects on cognitive function in hypertensive patients.", 
    "29": "This study compared the effects of clinically prescribed doses of cilazapril, nifedipine, and atenolol on maximal exercise performance in physically active subjects. In a double-blind crossover trial, 10 healthy male volunteers performed progressive aerobic exercise to exhaustion for determination of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max), after single dose ingestion of cilazapril, nifedipine, atenolol, and placebo. Measurements were made at exhaustion and at a single submaximal workload (250 W). Exercise time to exhaustion and peak workload were decreased by all agents (p less than 0.05 vs. placebo), but VO2 max was decreased by atenolol only (p less than 0.05 vs. placebo). Although both atenolol and cilazapril decreased the maximum systolic blood pressure, the peak heart rate was decreased only by atenolol (p less than 0.001 vs. placebo). Whereas submaximal oxygen consumption, minute ventilation, and blood lactate concentrations were not different between groups, ratings of perceived exertion were increased during submaximal exercise by atenolol and cilazapril (p less than 0.05 vs. placebo). Cilazapril, nifedipine, and atenolol all impaired exercise performance and increased ratings of perceived exertion during submaximal exercise without altering rates of oxygen consumption or blood lactate accumulation. Maximal exercise performance was impaired to a greater extent by atenolol than by nifedipine or cilazapril. This study suggests that either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium-channel antagonists might be preferable for the management of hypertension in athletic patients as they have a lesser effect on exercise performance, at least in healthy individuals.", 
    "30": "In systemic hypertension, a certain degree of impairment of left ventricular diastolic function is often detectable, and is the consequence of two factors: elevated afterload and left ventricular hypertrophy. The goal of improving diastolic dysfunction can thus be achieved by lowering blood pressure and by inducing a regression in left ventricular hypertrophy. A reduction in blood pressure by intravenous administration of verapamil has proved capable of enhancing left ventricular filling properties in patients with hypertension. This finding has not been corroborated, however, in midterm protocols using an array of drugs (beta-blockers, dihydropyridines, diltiazem, and diuretics). Reduction in left ventricular mass can be achieved by several categories of drugs, and it has been shown that a decrease in mass is accompanied by an improvement in the early diastolic filling pattern. The kind of drug used to accomplish mass reduction seems to be irrelevant as far as the improvement in diastolic function is concerned. The pattern of left ventricular hypertrophy, however, might play a role in influencing the outcome on diastolic mechanics of left ventricular mass decrease.", 
    "31": "Hypertensive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy leads to myocytic hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and structural alterations of the coronary microcirculation. This structural remodeling of the myocardium results in an impairment of diastolic function of the left ventricle and of coronary flow reserve despite normal epicardial arteries. Consequently, an antihypertensive treatment should aim at (a) reversing myocytic hypertrophy, (b) regression of myocardial fibrosis, and (c) improvement of coronary flow reserve apart from blood pressure lowering. In recent years many clinical studies have shown that regression of hypertensive hypertrophy can be induced by long-term treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, beta-receptor blockers, and antisympathonic drugs. However, vasodilators and diuretics, which stimulate adrenoceptor activity and increase angiotensin II levels, were found to be less effective in reversing LV hypertrophy. The trophic influence of catecholamines and angiotensin II on the myocardium counteracts the effect of systolic wall stress reduction due to blood pressure lowering. In respect of reversal of interstitial fibrosis, ACE inhibitors seem to be effective because the growth of fibroblasts was found to be stimulated by angiotensin II. Recently, clinical studies have confirmed previous experimental data that an improvement of the impaired coronary vasodilator reserve can be realized by long-term antihypertensive therapy. An antihypertensive treatment strategy which fully restores myocardial structure and completely repairs coronary microcirculation has to be considered as a causative treatment of hypertensive heart disease.", 
    "32": "Silent myocardial ischaemia results from an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. There is evidence in favour of both increased coronary vasomotor tone and increased oxygen demand as major independent causes of silent ischaemia. An ongoing study is assessing the efficacy of a slow release formulation of the calcium antagonist gallopamil in patients with stable angina pectoris. In a nonblind comparison with placebo in 13 patients, slow release gallopamil 100mg twice daily produced a marked reduction in exercise-induced myocardial ischaemia, and a moderate reduction in spontaneous ischaemia. The significance of these preliminary findings will emerge in the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of the study. Studies using long term ECG monitoring to compare the anti-ischaemic efficacy of various calcium antagonists indicate that agents with negative inotropic actions suppress silent myocardial ischaemia to a greater extent than calcium antagonists such as nifedipine, which tend to increase heart rate. Also, beta-adrenoceptor blockers have produced excellent results in the treatment of myocardial ischaemia, despite their theoretical disadvantage of not reducing coronary vasomotor tone. The role of pharmacological therapy in the suppression of silent myocardial ischaemia will only be established when the drugs concerned have been adequately characterised with regard to their effect on prognosis, adverse effects and risk:benefit ratio.", 
    "33": "We assessed the long-term effects of carvedilol on renal function in 10 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. After a 2- to 4-week placebo run-in period, all patients received 5 mg carvedilol once daily. If the effect was insufficient, the dosage was successively increased to 10 or 20 mg once daily. The mean +/- SEM duration of treatment was 17.3 +/- 1.0 weeks, and the final mean daily dosage was 13.5 +/- 2.2 mg/day. With treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly from 159.7 +/- 1.3 to 140.5 +/- 3.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and from 98.3 +/- 1.0 to 88.2 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), respectively. Carvedilol did not cause significant changes in glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow, blood urea nitrogen, or serum creatinine. Renal vascular resistance decreased significantly from 12.7 +/- 1.4 to 11.2 +/- 1.2 dyne.s.cm-5/1.48 m2 x 10(3) (p less than 0.05). Thus, long-term carvedilol therapy was effective in reducing blood pressure in essential hypertension without causing impairment of renal function.", 
    "34": "Possible counterregulatory neurohumoral and hemodynamic responses to carvedilol (a new vasodilating nonselective beta-receptor blocker) were studied in 19 men with essential hypertension (age range, 34-59 years; mean age, 44 years). Intra-arterial pressure, cardiac output (Cardio-green), heart rate, and the vasoactive peptides norepinephrine, epinephrine, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were measured at rest supine and sitting and during 100-W bicycle exercise before and 2 h after administration of 25 mg carvedilol. The same protocol was followed after 9 months of chronic carvedilol treatment (mean dose, 52 mg/day). Carvedilol induced both acute and chronic reductions (at rest supine, 11%) in mean arterial pressure, due in part to reduction in cardiac output (5%) and in part to reduction in total peripheral resistance (5%). At rest supine, carvedilol induced a reduction in ANP (27%) that could be viewed as a counterregulatory response to decrease in cardiac output, preventing excessive blood pressure reduction. ANP decreased (18%) when the patient sat up from the supine position and increased (67%) during exercise, but no further change was seen after acute or chronic carvedilol treatment. With the patient in the sitting position, norepinephrine was 110% higher than at rest supine; during 100-W exercise, norepinephrine increased 368%. A further increase (38-86% in the three situations, respectively) was seen after the first dose of carvedilol. Epinephrine showed similar but less marked changes. Neither extracellular fluid volume nor plasma volume (isotope dilution techniques) changed significantly during the study, but the acute blood pressure response to carvedilol was directly related to changes in extracellular fluid volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "The safety and tolerability of carvedilol, a new antihypertensive agent with the combined pharmacological activities of beta-blockade and vasodilation, and of nifedipine were investigated in patients with essential hypertension and non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes mellitus. Twenty patients were openly randomized to receive 25 mg carvedilol once daily (five men and five women; mean age, 63 years) or 10 mg nifedipine t.i.d. (three men and seven women; mean age, 64 years) for a period of 4 weeks. Baseline mean sitting blood pressures were 168/98 and 169/95 mm Hg in the carvedilol and nifedipine groups, respectively. Baseline mean areas under the curve (AUC) of the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) for the carvedilol and nifedipine groups were 6,136 +/- 1,195 and 6,287 +/- 1,228 mg/dl/min, respectively. Demographic and efficacy variables were not statistically different between treatment groups. After 4 weeks of therapy, mean sitting blood pressure was significantly (p less than 0.02) reduced to 144/91 mm Hg in the carvedilol group and to 149/87 mm Hg in the nifedipine group. Week 4 IVGTT AUC values of 5,735 +/- 1,464 mg/dl/min in the carvedilol group and 5,988 +/- 993 mg/dl/min in the nifedipine group, representing mean reductions of 6.14% and 3.17%, respectively, were not statistically different from baseline. Both treatments were well tolerated. No patient experienced adverse events in the carvedilol treatment group, whereas two patients in the nifedipine group reported episodes of headache (one patient) and palpitations (one patient); each episode was mild in severity and considered to be related to study medication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

After a single-blind placebo phase of 3 to 6 weeks, 47 patients (median age, 59 years) were randomized to receive carvedilol and 52 patients (median age, 57 years) were randomized to receive atenolol for an 8-week study period. Patients on carvedilol received 12.5 mg for the first 2 days and then 25 mg as a once-daily dosage. The initial dosage of atenolol was 50 mg once daily. The dosage of each treatment could be doubled (to 50 and 100 mg once daily, respectively) at week 4 if the response was inadequate. Sitting and standing blood pressures and heart rates were recorded 24 h after the dose at weeks 4 and 8. Data from 90 of 98 patients who completed the study were eligible for per-protocol analysis. Approximately one-third of the patients in each group required upward dose titration at week 4 because of inadequate response. At week 8, 84% patients receiving carvedilol and 91% receiving atenolol had sitting diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg or decreased their blood pressure by greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals for difference between carvedilol and atenolol, +7% and -21%). Safety profiles were similar between treatments. One patient withdrew; a skin rash developed during the fourth week of treatment with atenolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "The beta-blocker and vasodilator carvedilol was examined in preparations of human ventricular myocardium. Carvedilol is a high-affinity, slightly beta 1-selective competitive beta-blocking agent, with a KD for beta 1-receptors of approximately 4-5 nM and a selectivity of sixfold to 39-fold for beta 1-receptors rather than beta 2-receptors, depending on the method used to assess subtype potency. Carvedilol also is a potent alpha 1-blocking agent, with a beta 1: alpha 1-blocking relative potency of 1.7-fold. In human lymphocytes containing beta 2-receptors and human myocardial membranes containing both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors, carvedilol exhibited the unique property of guanine nucleotide-modulatable binding. This is a property shared with bucindolol, another beta-blocker and vasodilator that is structurally similar to carvedilol. Despite the presence of guanine nucleotide-modulatable binding, no intrinsic activity of carvedilol was detected in preparations of isolated human heart or in myocardial membranes.", 
    "38": "Several studies have demonstrated the long-term beneficial effects of beta-blockers in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Despite interest in this mode of therapy, clinical application of beta-blockers has been limited due to their negative inotropic effect. A subset of the heart failure patients do not show improvements with standard beta-blocker therapy. Carvedilol, a new nonselective beta-blocking agent with concurrent alpha-blocking properties, was evaluated in 17 patients with chronic heart failure secondary to ischemic heart disease. All had resting left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 45% and were maintained on diuretic therapy. Acute hemodynamic measurements were made after administration of intravenous carvedilol (2.5-7.5 mg) and after chronic therapy for 8 weeks (12.5 to 50 mg b.i.d.). Radionuclide ventriculography, ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, and right heart catheterization were performed before and after 8 weeks of chronic therapy. Twelve patients completed the study (five were withdrawn). Symptomatic and hemodynamic improvements were demonstrated in 11 of the 12 patients after 8 weeks of therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "Since our first studies on hypertrophy regression, this parameter has achieved an increasing interest in the treatment of hypertension. During the past 8 years we studied different groups of antihypertensive drugs with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This article discusses the antihypertensive drug carvedilol. We examined 17 patients with diastolic blood pressure of at least 95 mm Hg and left ventricular wall thickness of at least 15 mm. Measurements were carried out before and after treatment with 25 mg/day carvedilol for 6 months. We demonstrated a significant regression of septal thickness from 17.7 to 16.3 mm. At each wall, three measurements at different points were performed by MRI and the means were calculated. Left ventricular ejection fraction and wall motion did not show any significant changes in radionuclide ventriculography after treatment. The diastolic blood pressure was reduced from 98.0 to 88.7 mm Hg. All differences are significant (p less than 0.05). There was no significant correlation between the extent of regression of septal hypertrophy and the degree of pretherapeutic hypertrophy, the age of patients, or the dimension of blood pressure reduction.", 
    "40": "The effects of carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker with peripheral vasodilator action, on left ventricular function and mass in essential hypertension were studied in 14 patients with diastolic filling abnormalities. Treatment produced significant decreases in blood pressure (systolic: 168.4 +/- 10.5 to 154 +/- 17.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.005; diastolic: 101.6 +/- 8.6 to 95.3 +/- 11.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.025), left ventricular mass (316.7 +/- 85.8 to 276.8 +/- 84.9 g, p less than 0.05), and left ventricular mass index (157.9 +/- 42.4 to 131.6 +/- 34.6 g.m-2, p less than 0.025). There were coincident improvements in the parameters of diastolic left ventricular filling (E/A ratio: 0.66 +/- 0.14 to 0.80 +/- 0.26, p less than 0.025; mean E descent velocity: 245 +/- 130 to 264 +/- 70 cm.s-2, p less than 0.05). No significant alterations in systolic function were observed, although three patients with systolic impairment improved to normal during treatment. Two other patients, however, were withdrawn from the study because of hypotension and cardiac failure. In conclusion, carvedilol is effective in the treatment of hypertension and produces adequate blood pressure control with a percentage reduction in left ventricular mass. The associated changes in diastolic function may be due in part to the mass reduction, but no direct relation has been established, and the effect of afterload reduction on diastolic left ventricular filling remains important.", 
    "41": "Carvedilol is a dual-acting drug designed to produce two complementary effects: beta-blockade and vasodilation. These effects are induced in the same dose range, a prerequisite for utilizing both properties in an appropriate manner. The vasodilation is mediated predominantly by specific alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. At markedly higher concentrations, additional vasodilating actions besides alpha 1-blockade can be observed. These effects resemble those of Ca(2+)-antagonistic properties. However, they do not contribute to the acute blood pressure-lowering activity of carvedilol but may be responsible for the increased blood flow to specific organs. At beta-blocking doses, carvedilol reduces the regional and systemic vascular resistance in various experimental models, healthy volunteers, and in patients with cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. The profile of carvedilol thus insures beneficial treatment of hemodynamic disorders characterized by increased sympathetic tone and increased vascular resistance.", 
    "42": "The introduction of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists into clinical practice has resulted in major progress in the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris, and congestive heart failure. However, the first and second (beta 1 selective) generations of beta-blockers induce a series of unwanted functional and metabolic effects, suggesting the search for a third generation of beta-antagonists. The new multiple-action beta-blockers, which have important peripheral vasodilator properties, appear to be promising with regard to clinical efficacy and side effects. In hypertensive patients, the vasodilation could add a more pathophysiological mechanism and therefore could induce a better preservation of systolic function. The global cardioprotection may be further improved by the absence of long-term metabolic effects. By virtue of their peripheral and coronary vasodilating properties, multiple-action beta-blockers could exert more favorable anti-ischemic effects in patients with angina pectoris than the traditional beta-blockers. In congestive heart failure, afterload reduction, and possibly myocardial beta 2-activation induced by multiple-action beta-blockers can minimize the negative inotropic effects, leading to better toleration at the beginning of treatment. The potential benefits of multiple-action beta-blockers have been assessed by preliminary studies and should be confirmed by trials in progress.", 
    "43": "The first part of this article concerns the general relation between blood pressure lowering and cerebral blood flow. Factors known to affect cerebral blood flow are reviewed, and recent advances in the field of innervation of cerebral blood vessels are outlined. Special emphasis is placed on the importance of the phenomenon of autoregulation and how this is disturbed in patients with hypertension. Not all antihypertensive drugs exert the same action on the cerebral circulation to produce the same blood pressure-lowering effect. In addition, the actions exerted by common antihypertensive drugs on the cerebral circulation are described. The second part of the article provides a comparison between the effect of carvedilol and that of propranolol on blood pressure reduction and cerebral blood flow. In a double-blind, crossover study involving 14 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, carvedilol was shown to have no effect on cerebral blood flow, whereas there was a slight tendency for lower flows to occur with the use of propranolol. Because of the small sample size, statistical significance was not reached. These results are consistent with other recently published findings.", 
    "44": "Forearm hemodynamics using pulsed Doppler flowmetry were studied in nine healthy volunteers and 12 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension before and after acute oral administration of the beta-blocking and vasodilating agent carvedilol. Both the 25- and the 50-mg dose produced a significant blood pressure reduction by comparison with placebo in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Only the 50-mg dose caused a decrease in forearm vascular resistance in hypertensive subjects. The decrease disappeared after wrist occlusion. Although brachial artery diameter did not change, a significant decrease in tangential tension was observed. This study provides evidence that carvedilol produced arteriolar dilation within the forearm of hypertensive subjects in association with a decrease in brachial artery tangential tension.", 
    "45": "Nineteen men (mean age, 44 years) with moderately severe essential hypertension were studied invasively at rest and during exercise. After initial predrug recordings, patients received 25 mg carvedilol orally, and central hemodynamics at rest and during exercise were recorded 1 and 2 h after tablet intake to evaluate the immediate effects of carvedilol. Blood pressure decreased by 11% within 1 h, and the hemodynamic results indicated a combination beta-blocking and vasodilating effect. After 6-9 months of treatment (dose, 25-100 mg), supine hemodynamics were recorded, first 12-24 h after the last dose and then 1 and 2 h after an additional 25-mg dose. During chronic treatment (2 h after the last dose with the patient at rest and in the supine position), mean arterial pressure was reduced by 17% (p less than 0.001) and total peripheral resistance index was reduced by 6% (NS), whereas heart rate and cardiac index were reduced by 12%. Exercise hemodynamics demonstrated a decrease in blood pressure of 17% (p less than 0.001). Exercise stroke index increased by 5% (NS), in part compensating for the reduction in heart rate of 17%. Total peripheral resistance index was reduced by 5% (NS). Twenty-four-hour blood pressure monitoring (Accutracker II) demonstrated significant blood pressure reductions in awake as well as in asleep patients. Blood pressures decreased from 163/102 to 141/84 mm Hg in from 135/78 to 122/68 mm Hg in awake and asleep patients; respectively. Carvedilol is an effective antihypertensive agent, and the hemodynamic mode of action reflects alpha 1- and beta 1-blocking activities.", 
    "46": "Many factors, both local and systemic, are known to influence the caliber of peripheral vessels and regional blood flow. Methods of studying limb blood flow and its alteration by disease and drugs present considerable problems. We compared the effects of a series of antihypertensive drugs on limb blood flow and their functional effects in patients with hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. Results from studies with new antihypertensive drugs such as carvedilol are awaited.", 
    "47": "Carvedilol is a beta-adrenergic-blocking drug with vasodilating properties. This vasodilation has been ascribed to alpha 1-adrenergic blockade, but it has never been shown in the clinical setting. We addressed this issue by studying eight patients with mild essential hypertension who were given prazosin, 2 mg or carvedilol, 25 mg p.o. following a 2-week washout from previous treatment, according to a randomized double-blind, crossover experimental design. Before and 2 h after the administration of either prazosin or carvedilol, the patients were infused i.v. with increasing doses of phenylephrine (0.2-1.2 microgram/kg/min) and isoproterenol (0.01-0.05 microgram/kg/min). The patients were thereafter maintained on carvedilol 25 mg daily for 3 weeks, and the i.v. phenylephrine and isoproterenol infusions were repeated 2 h after the last tablet administration. The results showed that the single dose of carvedilol and prazosin lowered blood pressure (beat-to-beat finger pressure measurement) to a similar extent, but that heart rate was unaffected by prazosin and reduced by carvedilol. The tachycardic response to isoproterenol was abolished by carvedilol and unaffected by prazosin, whereas the pressor response to phenylephrine was reduced by carvedilol and virtually abolished by prazosin. The antihypertensive, beta-blocking and alpha 1-adrenergic-blocking effects of carvedilol were unchanged following prolonged administration of the drug. Thus, at a clinically effective dose, carvedilol not only has beta- but also sizeable alpha 1-blocking effects. These effects are preserved during prolonged administration of the drug. For a comparable antihypertensive action, however, the alpha 1-blocking effect is less pronounced than that of an alpha 1-blocker such as prazosin.", 
    "48": "The racemic drug carvedilol exerts its antihypertensive action through vasodilation and nonselective beta-blockade. The R(+)-enantiomer has twice (31.1%) the absolute bioavailability than the S(-) form (15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers were investigated after intravenous (i.v.) (12.5 mg in 1 h) and p.o. (25 mg) administration of racemic carvedilol in six patients with cirrhosis of the liver according to a randomized crossover design. Although the difference between areas under the curve of R(+) and S(-) were of borderline significance after i.v. administration but significant after oral administration, no difference existed between the absolute bioavailabilities of R(+) (83.7%) and S(-) (71.3%). The enantiomer ratio is similar after i.v. (1.3) and p.o. administration (1.6). In contrast to healthy subjects, the apparent volume of distribution of S(-) is about 90% greater than that of R(+) in patients. The renal excretion of carvedilol and of one of its major metabolites, carvedilol glucuronide, also exhibited stereoselective behavior, but in opposite directions. In patients with liver cirrhosis, stereoselective metabolism of carvedilol is still operative. However, probably because of portocaval shunts, the hepatic first-pass extraction is markedly reduced, eliminating the difference in bioavailability between the two enantiomers.", 
    "49": "A single-center, randomized, double-blind study in 14 hypertensive patients was conducted to investigate the acute and short-term safety of the addition of carvedilol to pre-existent nifedipine sustained-release (SR) therapy as well as on the addition of nifedipine SR to pre-existent carvedilol therapy when treatment with the initial monotherapy did not adequately control blood pressure. Mean supine blood pressure at study entry was 171/106 mm Hg. Acute reductions in blood pressure were greater with combination treatment than with either monotherapy. Dosing with 25 mg carvedilol once daily or 20 mg nifedipine SR twice daily resulted in mean peak reductions in supine blood pressure of 21/11 and 20/16 mm Hg, respectively, after 1 week of treatment with each respective monotherapy. With combination treatment, mean peak reductions (after dosing on days 1, 3, and 10) ranged from 26 to 40 mm Hg in supine systolic blood pressure and from 14 to 23 mm Hg in supine diastolic blood pressure. Acute changes in mean standing systolic and diastolic pressures were comparable to those in the supine position. Combination treatment resulted in an additive acute antihypertensive response without synergistic potentiation. Neither monotherapy nor the coadministration of the two agents in the doses used resulted in a significant antihypertensive response at the time of trough plasma levels of study medication, perhaps due to the short-term nature of the trial which did not allow the full antihypertensive effect of either agent to be realized. Before dosing with study medication, heart rates were minimally changed from study entry levels with either monotherapy or combination treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "Establishing the overall efficacy or safety of a drug requires a unified methodological approach and analysis of all clinical trials that are intended to be summarized. As an example, this article presents the aggregated dose-response relationship and a subgroup analysis (by age) over all studies of the antihypertensive drug carvedilol. The clinical end points were change from baseline of blood pressure and pulse after 2-4 weeks of treatment with a once-daily dose regimen. All antihypertensive trials were reanalyzed using an intent-to-treat principle. Aggregated data (mean, standard deviation, sample size) for each random group within each study were then combined by means of meta-analysis. The results show that the main patient population can be treated adequately with 25 mg of carvedilol q.d. The dose-response curve shows a typical sigmoid shape: a steeper increase from 12.5 to 25 mg of carvedilol and a following flat part (25, 50, and 100 mg of carvedilol q.d.). There is a considerable variation of the results between studies, which is much bigger than the dose-response effect. Most of this variation is due to monocentric trials.", 
    "51": "In patients with chronic stable exertional angina pectoris, the antianginal and anti-ischemic efficacies and the safety of 25 mg carvedilol b.i.d. were compared with those of 20 mg nifedipine sustained-release (SR) in a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study. In 22 centers, 166 patients were enrolled. After washout and run-in phases with two symptom-limited seated bicycle exercise tests on placebo, eligible patients were allocated to one of the two parallel treatment groups. After 4 weeks of active treatment, an additional exercise test was performed 12 h after the preceding dose. The patients were issued diary cards to document the daily number of anginal attacks and glyceryl trinitrate applications. Symptom-limited total exercise time, time to onset of angina, and time to 1-mm ST-segment depression increased with both treatments vs. placebo baseline values. The changes were more distinct in the carvedilol group, but the between-group differences were not statistically significant. Angina symptomatology during daily life and glyceryl trinitrate consumption were markedly improved by each treatment. Adverse events on treatment, particularly those correlated to vasodilation, were less frequent in the carvedilol group.", 
    "52": "In vivo measurements of human dorsal hand vein diameters have become a valuable tool in investigating vasoactive agents. This study in 13 healthy volunteers was performed to establish the influence of locally infused clonidine, angiotensin II, norepinephrine, and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) on hand vein diameter in a nonsystemically active dose range. The study was intended to select agents suitable for venous preconstriction before and after oral administration of 50 mg carvedilol to obtain information on the mechanisms of vasodilation of this combined alpha- and beta-blocker. Infusions of norepinephrine (ED50, 20-40 ng/min) and PGF2 alpha (ED50, 480-1,170 ng/min) into the hand vein under investigation led to nearly complete constriction of the vessel. Infusions with clonidine and angiotensin II led to approximately 35% diameter reduction under the same conditions. A wide interindividual variety of hand vein dose response was observed for all vasoconstrictors. Oral administration of 50 mg carvedilol led to a rightward shift in the dose-response curves of angiotensin II, norepinephrine, and PGF2 alpha. On a 5% significance level, the venoconstrictive effects of norepinephrine and PGF2 alpha were attenuated by carvedilol compared with placebo. We conclude that a mechanism of vasodilation by carvedilol in addition to alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism could be responsible for the attenuation of venoconstriction induced by PGF2 alpha.", 
    "53": "Carvedilol is a nonselective beta-blocker with alpha-mediated vasodilating properties that has been shown to be effective in systemic hypertension, stable angina, and congestive heart failure (CHF). In this study, we studied the effects of carvedilol on premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in 65 patients undergoing treatment with carvedilol (12.5-50 mg b.i.d.) for 4-8 weeks. Twelve patients had hypertension, 41 had stable angina, and 12 had CHF. Holter monitoring for 24 h was performed before and after active carvedilol therapy. Median PVCs per 24 h decreased from 25.5 to 6.0 (p less than 0.001, n = 52). Reduction in PVC activity occurred in 77% of patients, and 23% of patients with multifocal PVCs changed their morphology to unifocal. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was present in four patients before treatment; this was abolished in all patients. R-on-T PVC was present in six patients; it decreased in five and increased in one. New ventricular tachycardia (less than 8 beats) occurred in two patients, but QT prolongation was not noted in these patients. An improvement in Lown's classification occurred in 50% of patients. However, in the CHF group, the improvement in Lown's criteria was observed in 73% of patients. Carvedilol does not appear to possess proarrhythmic effects, and chronic therapy reduces PVC activity in a wide range of patients. This property of carvedilol is complementary to its hypotensive and anti-ischemic effects. In the CHF group, the beneficial effects of carvedilol on left ventricular function and hemodynamics may combine with the improvement in PVC activity to produce a significant improvement in mortality.", 
    "54": "The beta-blocking and vasodilating agent carvedilol was compared with a combination of propranolol and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) in a double-blind, parallel-group study. After two baseline sitting bicycle exercise tests on placebo, 31 patients with chronic stable angina were asymmetrically randomized to treatment with carvedilol (25 mg b.i.d.) or propranolol-ISDN (80 mg/20 mg b.i.d.) for a period of 6 months. Further exercise tests were performed 2 h after the first dose as well as after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment. Twenty-seven patients were considered evaluable for efficacy. Differences between the two groups were observed with emphasis on total exercise time and time to 1-mm ST-segment depression. In contrast to a greater peak effect of the first propranolol/ISDN dose, the chronic antianginal and anti-ischemic effects of carvedilol at trough were found to be more marked than those of the combination.", 
    "55": "The effect of carvedilol on cardiovascular and physical performance parameters at rest and during exercise was evaluated in an open, uncontrolled study. Assessments were made at rest, at one-half anaerobic threshold (1/2AT), at AT, and at maximal work load (WLmax) before and after 3 weeks of treatment with 12.5 mg carvedilol once daily for 1 week, followed by 25 mg carvedilol once daily for 2 weeks. Ten well-conditioned healthy male volunteers maintained their regular training program during the study, and all completed the study. End-of-study measures of physical performance (time to WLmax, WLmax, and VO2/kg) and behavioral measures (Borg scale) of perceived exertion were unchanged from prestudy values. End-of-study diastolic BP (DBP) at rest and at WLmax was unchanged compared with prestudy values (mean +/- SD; 81.0 +/- 7.38 and 84.4 +/- 4.95 mm Hg, respectively, compared with 82.0 +/- 8.88 and 85.0 +/- 7.07 mm Hg, respectively). Mean +/- SD change from prestudy to end-of-study baseline resting systolic BP (SBP) was a reduction of 11.5 +/- 8.83 mm Hg, and mean +/- SD change from prestudy to end-of-study SBP at WLmax was a reduction of 20.0 +/- 12.25 mm Hg. Mean +/- SD change from prestudy to end-of-study resting heart rate (HR) a reduction of 7.8 +/- 18.45 beats/min, and mean +/- SD change from prestudy to end-of-study HR at WLmax was a reduction of 19.7 +/- 9.24 beats/min. The effect of carvedilol thus represents a combination of reduction in resting systolic BP and HR and attenuation of the exercise-induced changes in these parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of carvedilol were investigated in an open trial performed on 13 hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure and six additional patients requiring hemodialysis. In hypertensive renal failure patients, treatment with carvedilol (5 mg/day) for 1 week produced a significant decrease in blood pressure (from 172/101 to 146/84 mm Hg) but did not change the heart rate. The pharmacokinetics of carvedilol did not change with repeated administration, and there was no accumulation of this drug. In hemodialysis patients with hypertension, the pharmacokinetics of carvedilol after a single dose of 10 mg did not vary between dialysis and nondialysis days, and blood pressure decreased significantly on both days. In addition, there was no accumulation of carvedilol during a 4-week trial of therapy, and blood pressure was decreased significantly from 170/93 to 145/83 mm Hg. There were no side effects and no abnormal laboratory findings noted during the trial. These results indicate that carvedilol is an effective and safe agent for hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure and for hemodialysis patients with hypertension and that dosage adjustments are probably not required in these clinical situations.", 
    "57": "beta-Adrenoceptor-blocking drugs in current use can be separated into two main groups: those nonselective and those selective for beta 1-receptors. Members of each group reduce cardiac output and lead to an increase in peripheral resistance with a concomitant reduction in blood flow. beta-Blocking drugs not only may occupy the receptor preventing stimulation but also may have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Those with marked partial agonist activity at the beta 2-receptor giving some beta 2-mediated vasodilation can be regarded as the first multiple-action beta-blocking drugs. Subsequently, drugs have been developed that in addition to blocking the beta-receptor have an important peripheral vasodilator activity. Labetalol was the first drug of this group to be developed; prizidolol followed but has been withdrawn because of toxicity. Several other agents have been described, including bucindolol, carvedilol, celiprolol, dilevalol (one of the isomers of labetalol), and medroxolol. Three mechanisms have been reported to be responsible for peripheral vasodilation: alpha-receptor blockade, beta 2-agonism, and a dilator action independent of either the alpha- or beta-receptors. Evidence for these various mechanisms is more readily obtainable from animal experiments, but some confirmatory evidence has been obtained in humans. Inhibition of alpha-stimulation had been found with labetalol, medroxalol, and carvedilol and suggested with celiprolol. beta 2-Mediated vasodilation has been demonstrated by, for example, celiprolol and dilevalol; evidence of a vasodilation independent of alpha-blockade or beta 2-stimulation has been reported with celiprolol and carvedilol.", 
    "58": "Calcium channel blockers of the phenylalkylamine (i.e. verapamil), benzothiazepine (i.e. diltiazem) and dihydropyridine (i.e. nifedipine) classes were evaluated for effects on the tumor cell/platelet interactions using Walker 256 carcinosarcoma cells (W256 cells). When W256 cells were pretreated for 15 min with channel blockers at concentrations of 50-200 microM, macroscopic tumor-cell-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited (order of potency; nifedipine greater than diltiazem much greater than verapamil). However, ultrastructural analysis revealed limited, focal platelet aggregates associated with tumor cell plasma membranes of verapamil- and diltiazem-treated cells. There was no evidence of platelet activation or platelet association with the tumor cell membrane in cells pretreated with nifedipine. Walker 256 cells possess the intergrin alpha IIb beta 3. Tumor cell alpha IIb beta 3 was shown to mediate tumor cell/platelet interactions in vitro [Chopra et al. (1988) Cancer Res. 48:3787]. Patching and capping of surface alpha IIb beta 3 were inhibited by nifedipine greater than diltiazem much greater than verapamil. The degree of inhibition of alpha IIb beta 3 receptor mobility parallels the inhibition of tumor-cell-induced platelet aggregation. W256 cells are characterized by a well-developed microfilament and intermediate filament network and by the absence of a distinct microtubular network. Calcium channel blockers had no effect on the low polymerization level of tubulin. However, they induced rearrangement of microfilament stress fibers. Intermediate filaments were also rearranged but to varying degrees. The order of effectiveness for alteration of intermediate filament organization was nifedipine greater than diltiazem while verapamil was ineffective. We propose that the previously reported inhibition of tumor cell/platelet interaction and tumor cell metastasis by calcium channel blockers [Honn et al. (1984) Clin Exp Metastasis 1:61] is due not only to the effects of the Ca2+ channel blockers on platelets, but also to their effect on the tumor cell cytoskeleton resulting in an inhibition of the mobility and function of the alpha IIb beta 3 receptor.", 
    "59": "The influence of nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem, metoprolol, and enalapril on the basal and angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced elevation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) DNA was examined. Our results from four independent experiments, each performed in triplicate, are summarized by calculating the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the drugs. Nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem had IC50 values of 2.3 +/- 0.7 x 10(-6), 3.5 +/- 0.3 x 10(-6), and 6.6 +/- 2.8 x 10(-6) M, respectively. Metoprolol had an IC50 value of 49 +/- 16 x 10(-6) M, whereas enalapril was completely ineffective. All drugs used had no influence on the basal cell [3H]thymidine incorporation. This in vitro study allows one to conclude that the calcium-entry blockers can inhibit the Ang II-induced cell growth and thus may have beneficial effects on the development and regression of vascular growth, which is associated with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "60": "Two hundred forty-seven [142 women (57.49%)] elderly patients with essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 114 mm Hg) and an average age of 67.4 +/- 6 years were included in an open multicenter ambulatory trial. One hundred thirty-seven had some kind of associated disease. After a 15-day washout period, the patients began nitrendipine therapy (10 mg o.d.). After 1 month, the dose was increased to 20 mg o.d. in patients with diastolic blood pressure (DPB) greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg, and thereafter 5 and 10 mg o.d. of bisoprolol was added to the maximal dose of nitrendipine (20 mg o.d.) in the case of patients with DBP greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg at the end of the second and third months, respectively. At the end of the 6-month follow-up period, the systolic and diastolic pressures had dropped -35 and -21 mm Hg, respectively, without any change in heart rate or Quetelet index. In 210 patients (84.9%), blood pressure control was achieved: 26 (10.5%) with 10 mg of nitrendipine, 149 (60.3%) with 20 mg of nitrendipine, and 35 (14.1%) by adding bisoprolol. The lipid profile, glucose, potassium, uric acid, or creatinine did not change negatively. Sixty-six (26.72%) patients reported clinical side effects, although these were mild; only 15 (6.07%) patients were excluded because of side effects. Nitrendipine has been shown to have a high therapeutic efficacy and biochemical tolerance for first-line treatment of elderly patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension with or without associated diseases.", 
    "61": "The aim of this study was to assess the effects of long-term (9-month) treatment with isradipine, alone or combined with bopindolol, on blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and diastolic function. Thirty-five hypertensive patients with LVH and supine diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) greater than or equal to 100 and less than or equal to 120 mm Hg received increasing doses of isradipine (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg twice daily); if blood pressure was not controlled, bopindolol (0.5-2 mg once daily) was added to the treatment. Clinical and laboratory investigations were carried out after placebo for baseline values, and after 5 and 9 months of isradipine treatment alone (n = 11) or combined with bopindolol (n = 24). At the end of the study, blood pressure was significantly decreased while heart rate did not change with isradipine alone, but decreased significantly after the addition of bopindolol. Although the DBP was normalized (less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) in 28 patients (80%), complete reversal of the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was seen in only 7 patients (20%). The ratio of early to atrial filling did not change, but the deceleration time was significantly decreased after 9 months. No laboratory abnormalities or important side effects were observed. Although isradipine alone or combined with bopindolol was effective in controlling blood pressure and significantly reduced the LVMI after 5 months, improvement in diastolic function was seen only after 9 months of active treatment.", 
    "62": "The effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine and the beta-blocker metoprolol, which are based on different antihypertensive therapeutic principles, were evaluated in 52 men with mild-to-moderate hypertension in a 6-week, double-blind, randomized study. Mental stress-testing was performed before and after active treatment. With isradipine (n = 26), the stress-induced responses of cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were not significantly changed, but the blood pressure (BP) response, specifically the diastolic response, was decreased. With metoprolol (n = 26), there was a decreased response of cardiac output and an increased response of total peripheral resistance, and the BP response was even greater than it had been before treatment. Thus, these results indicate that beta-blockade is effective in reducing cardiac responsiveness but, because of vascular counterregulatory mechanisms, BP responsiveness is not decreased. In contrast, calcium antagonism preserves the physiological hemodynamic profile while reducing BP responsiveness to stress.", 
    "63": "Cardiovascular effects of YM-16151-4, a combined calcium entry blocking and beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking agent, were evaluated in dogs. In anesthetized dogs, YM-16151-4 (0.01-1 mg/kg intravenously, i.v.) dose-dependently increased coronary blood flow (CBF) and decreased mean blood pressure (MBP), total peripheral resistance (TPR), dP/dtmax, double product, and left ventricular (LV) work without increasing heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO). YM-16151-4 increased vertebral blood flow as well as CBF, but had no effect on carotid, mesenteric, renal, and femoral blood flow. Coronary vasodilating activity of YM-16151-4 was also observed after intracoronary artery injection (i.a.). In anesthetized and vagotomized dogs, YM-16151-4 dose-dependently inhibited isoproterenol (0.2 micrograms/kg i.v.)-induced tachycardia and decrease in diastolic BP (DBP), with ED50 values of 0.039 and 0.52 mg/kg i.v., respectively. In conscious dogs, YM-16151-4 (0.1-1 mg/kg i.v.) produced a dose-dependent hypotensive effect with no effect on HR or PQ-interval. The hypotensive effect of YM-16151-4 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.v.) reached its maximum approximately 1-2 h after each dosing and lasted 6-8 h. These results suggest that YM-16151-4 actually behaves as a hybrid compound, combining calcium entry blocking and beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking activities, and that this compound could be a novel long-acting antianginal and antihypertensive agent.", 
    "64": "Sotalol is a beta-blocker with class III antiarrhythmic properties that has recently been used in children for the treatment of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. However, little is known about its electrophysiologic effects on the immature heart. Using intracardiac electrocardiographic recordings and stimulation techniques, 15 canine neonates (8-15 days) and 15 adult mongrel dogs were studied with cumulative doses of sotalol (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg plus an additional dose of 8 mg/kg for neonates). Heart rate decreased significantly in the two groups, but more in adult dogs (-43% in adult dogs versus -25% in neonates, p less than 0.05). There was no significant change for QRS duration and His-Purkinje system conduction time interval. QT and atrioventricular nodal conduction time intervals increased in adult dogs and neonates. Sinus node recovery time increased significantly in the two groups, but more in adult dogs. Refractory periods of the atrioventricular (AV) node increased significantly in neonates. Atrial flutter was no longer inducible in 12 of 15 neonates after the 2 mg/kg dose. Atrial effective refractory period increased significantly more in neonates (96%, p less than 0.001) than in adult dogs (58%, p less than 0.001). Ventricular effective refractory periods increased significantly both in neonates (46%) and adult dogs (50%), in a similar way. In conclusion, sotalol has greater electrophysiologic effects on the immature heart at the atrial level when compared to the adult, and similar effects on the refractory period of AV node and ventricle.", 
    "65": "We evaluated the effects of a single oral dose of 5 mg of isradipine compared to placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study using gated radionuclide angiography at rest and during exercise in 20 patients with stable chronic angina. Isradipine improved both anginal symptomatology and ST-segment depression during exercise, with a concomitant favorable effect on the isotopic parameters exploring systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. There was a marked increase of the ejection fraction during exercise with isradipine compared to placebo (61 +/- 14% vs. 55 +/- 15%, respectively, p less than 0.001) as well as a significant improvement in the peak ejection rate and the peak filling rate at rest [2.56 +/- 0.62 vs. 2.16 +/- 0.54 end diastolic volume (EDV) per second and 2.14 +/- 0.59 vs. 1.87 +/- 0.37 EDV/s, respectively] and during exercise (3.49 +/- 0.97 vs. 3.10 +/- 1.07 EDV/s and 4.05 +/- 1.34 vs. 3.65 +/- 1.25 EDV/s, respectively). We conclude that isradipine has a beneficial effect on the clinical and electrocardiographic signs of exercise-induced ischemia, leading to a significant improvement of the systolic and diastolic parameters of left ventricular function. Therefore, isradipine is potentially a useful treatment for patients with exertional angina and hypertension, alone or associated with beta blocker medication.", 
    "66": "To clarify the mechanism of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in man, human pulmonary artery segments (2 mm O.D.) were suspended and changes in isometric force were measured. The arteries were contracted by hypoxia (PO2 43 +/- 2 Torr) developing a tension of 127 +/- 36 mg over the course of 15 min. This contraction was completely blocked by 10(-6) M L-isoproterenol, 10(-6) M nitroglycerin, partially blocked by 10(-8)-10(-6) M verapamil, unchanged by 10(-6) M phentolamine, 10(-6) M L-propranolol, 10(-6) M diphenhydramine, 10(-6) M guanethidine, 10(-7) M FPL 55712 and enhanced by 10(-6) M BAY K 8644, 10(-3) M procaine, 3 x 10(-6) M quinacrine, 10(-6) M indomethacin or 10(-6) M methylene blue. Removal of the endothelium significantly enhanced the magnitude of hypoxia-induced contraction. These results suggest that the human pulmonary artery constricts in response to hypoxia, at least in part, through activation of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and that neither alpha, beta, H1 receptors, the lipoxygenase pathway nor neural reflexes are involved. They also show that the endothelium is not required for hypoxic contraction and that its presence reduces sensitivity to hypoxia.", 
    "67": "Antiarrhythmic effects of beta-blockade (BB) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were compared with those of various antiarrhythmic agents using ambulatory Holter monitoring. The BB therapy effectively suppressed ventricular extrasystoles (VEs) in 85% of patients, as evidenced by improvement in Lown's grade or a reduction in the number of the highest grade VEs greater than 50%. In contrast, conventional antiarrhythmic agents, except flecainaid and amiodarone, were poorly effective in suppressing VEs. BB therapy gradually increased left ventricular fractional shortening (16 +/- 6% to 22 +/- 12%) and improved 12-month survival rates as compared with those receiving conventional therapy (93 vs 69%). This antiarrhythmic potency seemed to be an additional therapeutic efficacy of BB in the management of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, which frequently associated with serious VEs.",

    "73": "This study attempted to determine the mechanism of anal canal motility after ileoanal anastomosis with the use of alpha-, beta- and muscarinic receptor agents. Forty-five patients, 19 +/- 2 months after operation (mean plus or minus S.E.M.) and 48 control volunteers were studied. Anal manometry indicated no difference in maximum resting pressure and squeeze pressure between the patients and the normal controls. Greater amplitude and less frequent anal canal slow waves were a particular characteristic during the postoperative period. Phentolamine (alpha-blocker) exhibited a stimulatory effect on anal resting tone in the normal rectum, while propranolol (beta-blocker) and atropine (muscarinic blocker) had no effect. However, alpha-, beta- and muscarinic receptors all had stimulatory effects on postoperative anal tone. The muscarinic receptor had dominant effects on the reduction in anal canal slow wave frequency after ileoanal anastomosis. Our results indicated that neorectum after ileoanal anastomosis had hybrid characteristics of both rectum and ileum. Through analysis of receptor-related motor function, we may be able to improve our understanding of dyscontinence after ileoanal anastomosis.",

Each study administered active drug for 21 consecutive days preceded and followed by 14-day baseline and recovery periods, respectively. Animals pressed five keys in sequence for food reinforcement during daily experimental sessions which consisted of alternating acquisition (new sequence learning) and performance (previously learned) task components. Atenolol increased response latencies during acquisition in comparison to performance components, and during early portions of sessions. Propranolol also increased response latencies during acquisition components in early periods of sessions, but fewer dependent measures were affected, and the magnitude of increases in response latencies was smaller (12% +/- 5 SEM) as compared with atenolol (47% +/- 13). Test doses of phencyclidine HCl (PCP) increased latencies to the same degree as atenolol. PCP markedly reduced accuracy, while atenolol or propranolol did not. Blood pressures remained stable under atenolol, and decreased by approximately 10-15 mmHg under propranolol. No differences between renovascular hypertensive and normotensive baboons were found as a function of drug conditions. Drug effects were not dependent on plasma propranolol concentration.",

    "77": "In a preceding paper we reported the evolution of chagasic cardiopathy in mice inoculated with low number of T. cruzi from 2 days to 75 days post-infection (p.i.). The present work analyzed the contractility, pharmacological response and histopathology of myocardium isolated from chronic chagasic mice from 90 days until 180 days. p.i. Myocardium contractile force reached values similar to controls until 165 days p.i. From this to the end contractility was significantly lower. At 90 days p.i. NE provoked negative inotropic effect or had no effect in 13% of the cases tested. The others had a reactivity to NE similar to normal ventricles. From 105 days until 180 days p.i. NE induced to a positive inotropic effect significantly lower than in normal. ACh effect was significantly smaller from 165 days to the end. Previously ACh ventricles responses were as control. The effects of dibenamine, propranolol and atropine (10-6M) on chagasic ventricles were similar to those observed in normal tissues. At 90 days p.i. the histopathology showed focalized inflammatory infiltrates. At 180 days p.i. fibers fragmentations and loss of typical striated characteristic of cardiac tissue. The abnormal pharmacological response described could be attributed to alterations in cardiac beta and muscarinic receptors probably due to a lower oxygen support. The present paper shows that during chronic Chagas' disease myocardial function and pharmacological reactivity are seriously and definitively compromised.", 
    "78": "Cardioprotection is a broad term; this short review deals with six aspects: 1. Secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) has been shown for beta-blockers in both early and late intervention studies. Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists are associated with an excess incidence of coronary events, whereas non-dihydropyridines prevent reinfarction provided left ventricular (LV) function is adequate; dihydropyridines tend to increase heart rate and stimulate the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin systems. 2. Primary prevention of MI has been shown for beta-blockers in younger/middle-aged hypertensives but not in the elderly. Diuretics, by contrast, possibly increase the risk of coronary events in younger/middle-aged hypertensives but significantly reduce coronary events in older hypertensives. These results might be explained by the larger, noncompliant left ventricle of the elderly hypertensive, which, in the absence of overt ischemia, responds poorly to beta-blockade (further enlargement with increased wall stress and impaired coronary reserve), while diuretics have the opposite effect. Primary prevention of coronary events in patients with chronic angina is likely to occur with beta-blockers, while studies with calcium antagonists have shown a significant excess of coronary events. 3. Ischemic events occurring during the \"vulnerable\" period between 7 and 10 AM (when sympathetic activity is maximal) are significantly reduced by beta-blockers but not by calcium antagonists. 4. Stress-induced myocardial necrosis in humans is markedly reduced by beta-blockers. 5. Coronary risk factors, such as elevated blood lipids, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, are possibly adversely affected by diuretics and beta-blockers, with the former also increasing heart rate, plasma renin activity, and plasma catecholamine levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Lung wet:dry weight ratios were increased in treated fetuses delivered by hysterotomy at day 21; no difference was seen at birth after vaginal delivery. On subsequent days, treated pups exhibited higher wet:dry weight ratios, implying impaired postnatal lung water clearance. Surfactant pools were decreased proportionately at both doses. Ongoing surfactant synthesis was unaffected at either dose. Baseline secretion was reduced for those exposed to 10 mg/kg/day. Secretory response to beta-agonist stimulation was impaired in both treatment groups. Chronic beta-blockade alters fetal lung water clearance, surfactant stores, and secretory response to beta-agonists.",

Based on the results obtained, the author concludes that, while the withdrawal syndrome sets in during gradual decrease in long-term metipranolol doses in the rat myocardium on stress, it lasts shorter than after sudden interruption of treatment, and myocardial metabolism as well as its ultrastructural pattern return to control values after a shorter period of time.",

    "82": "Echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass (LVM) is currently considered to be the most powerful risk indicator for cardiovascular disease, yielding prognostic information beyond that provided by the evaluation of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, high blood pressure included. It has been considered logical to try to obtain regression of cardiac hypertrophy, even though the risk-reducing implications of such a measure remain to be fully established. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that some classes of antihypertensive compounds are less effective than others in causing reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in spite of being similarly efficacious in lowering blood pressure. In order to extract the maximum amount of information from clinical studies, a meta-analysis was performed. This analysis included 109 treatment studies, each conformed to strict present rules. Only studies with pharmacological antihypertensive therapy and echocardiographically determined LVM were included. An analysis of the effect of the four first-hand antihypertensive treatment principles, adjusted for differences between studies with ANCOVA, showed that the ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists all reduce LVM by reversing wall hypertrophy and that the effect is most pronounced with ACE inhibitors. Diuretics reduce LVM mainly by a reduction in left ventricular diameter. If the difference in ability to reverse LVH, between ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers/diuretics would correspond to a difference in prognosis, then the outcome of antihypertensive therapy might be expected to improve. This hypothesis is currently under investigation.", 
    "83": "The purpose of these experiments was to label an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor ligand with a positron emitting isotope and then test this radioligand in vivo. No-carrier-added [11C]WY26703 was synthesized by methylation of its desmethyl precursor, WY27050 with [11C]H3I followed by purification with HPLC in 14% yield in a synthesis time of 35 min from EOB. Ki values for unlabeled WY26703, ranged from 0.52-1.55 nM in tissues that express a single alpha 2-adrenergic receptor subtype. Tail vein injections of [11C]WY26703 in mice revealed that the compound was distributed in the brain, heart, lungs, spleen, and kidneys. In the brains of rats treated with atipamezole, an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, there was no decrease in [11C] accumulation indicating a lack of observable specific binding of the radioligand. When brain tissue was homogenized and filtered, however, atipamezole decreased [11C] activity by 53%. Therefore, [11C]WY26703 crosses the blood-brain barrier and specifically binds to alpha 2-adrenergic receptors with high affinity. Atipamezole treatment decreased only the area of the locus coeruleus [11C] value of the various regions of the brain. The affinity, however, of [11C]WY26703 does not appear to distinguish alpha 2-receptors from nonspecific binding sites. PET study of [11C]WY26703 in a Rhesus monkey showed that influx of [11C]WY26703 into the brain was high for the first few minutes but radioactivity then declined rapidly and did not retain in a specific brain region. This suggests that [11C]WY26703 may not be a useful ligand for imaging human alpha 2-adrenergic receptors by positron emission tomography.", 
    "84": "Nebivolol is a novel selective beta 1-adrenergic antagonist with an unusual haemodynamic profile. It improves left ventricular function in normals and in patients with a damaged left ventricle. We compared the cardiac effects of a 14-day treatment period with 10 mg o.d. of bisoprolol, 400 mg o.d. of celiprolol, 25 mg o.d. of carvedilol and 5 mg o.d. of nebivolol in a placebo-controlled crossover study in 7 volunteers with a mean age of 39 (range 30-53) years. Cardiac haemodynamics were assessed serially by means of systolic time intervals. The ratio of the preejection period to the left ventricular ejection time (PEP/LVET) was used as a indirect measure of left ventricular performance. The results show that the PEP/LVET is a very sensitive and reproducible index of left ventricular function. During treatment with placebo and bisoprolol no changes occurred; during treatment with celiprolol and carvedilol a significant but transient decrease of PEP/LVET occurred, and only during treatment with nebivolol a long-lasting and significant decrease of PEP/LVET occurred. With bisoprolol an increase of PEP and QS2c (total electromechanical systole) was observed, indicative of a negative inotropic effect. In conclusion, nebivolol, in contrast with both classical and vasodilating beta-blocking agents, substantially improves left ventricular function, possibly due to an improvement of diastolic function and left ventricular compliance, which may be of therapeutical value in the treatment of congestive heart failure.", 
    "85": "Since 1987, an entirely computerized open study has been developed in Pr Sole's Ophthalmology Department: the CLERTORE project (Clermont-Tonus-Research). It is a data bank including all the ophthalmic data of hypertensive patients, whether treated or untreated. Every six months, the patients included in the CLERTORE project undergo a clinical ophthalmic examination as well as an automated visual field examination (OCTOPUS 500), an examination of the optic disc (ONHA) and fluorophotometry (FLUOROTRON MASTER). To date, 92 patients have been included in the project. One hundred and eighty-three eyes are examined every six months with a maximal follow-up of 42 months. Because of the numerous criteria of the data base, it is too early to give any statistical results. With a close look at the evolution of the examinations of some of our cases, this preliminary work however allows us to make the three following remarks: In the hypertensive patients, a modification of the papillary pallor is observed without any change in the visual field, C/D ratio and fluorophotometry. The pallor is clearly modified when adrenaline eye drops are given to glaucomatous patients. There is a break of the iridic blood barrier in some hypertensive patients, whether treated or untreated.", 
    "86": "In nearly all forms of established hypertension, the cardinal hemodynamic disturbance is an increased total peripheral resistance, while cardiac output is abnormally low, particularly during exercise. When left untreated, total peripheral resistance increases, cardiac output falls, and blood pressure increases over time. The coronary reserve is reduced, and renal as well as cerebral resistance increases and blood flow falls. Antihypertensive agents effect central hemodynamics differently. Ordinary beta-blockers do usually not reduce total peripheral resistance much below pretreatment level, and cardiac output is chronically depressed, particularly during exercise. However, the beta-blockers greatly reduce the workload on the heart by decreasing the heart rate-pressure product. Modern beta-blockers with vasodilating activity--like carvedilol--are based on a combination of beta-blockade and vasodilatation. Such beta-blockers also induce a marked decrease in the pressure-heart rate product, and some reduction in total peripheral resistance. They cause less depression of exercise cardiac output than ordinary beta-blockers. Blood flow to the kidneys and the brain is maintained. From a theoretical point of view, this type of antihypertensive treatment should maintain good blood pressure control, reduce cardiac workload and be associated with less side-effects than ordinary beta-blockers.", 
    "87": "A prospective study was designed to investigate the varied presentations of major affective disorders in patients with organic brain disease.", 
    "88": "Patients admitted to our neuropsychiatry service, with affective and behavioral disturbances, and known neurological disorders, were classified, on phenomenological grounds, into the following groups: 1) elated mania; 2) irritable mania; 3) affective lability with periods of irritability, but without other symptoms pathognomonic for mania; and 4) intermittent psychosis with absent or ambiguous mood changes.", 
    "89": "A majority of patients in all four groups responded to pharmacotherapy with anti-cycling agents.", 
    "90": "It is proposed that these groups represent different expressions of mania in brain injured persons, and that these expressions range through a spectrum of phenomenology, included elated mania, irritable mania, episodic psychosis and explosive organic personality disorder. The DSM-III-R classification of these disorders, and approaches to their clinical management, are discussed.", 
    "91": "The aim of the present study was to assess the mechanisms by which norepinephrine (NE) increased the synthesis of prostanoids and revealed a hyperactivity of the Thromboxane (Tx) A2 synthase in the Lyon genetically hypertensive (LH) rat kidney. To this purpose, the effects of NE (1.2 x 10(-8) to 9.6 x 10(-7) M) on renal function and prostanoid synthesis were assessed in isolated perfused kidneys following beta-adrenoceptor blockade by sotalol (10(-5)M) and compared to those of equipressor concentration of an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, BHT 933 (3.5 x 10(-4) M) and angiotensin II (AII) (7.7 x 10(-9) M). Kidneys were isolated from eight week-old male LH rats and from their normotensive (LN) and low blood pressure (LL) controls and perfused in a single pass system. In baseline conditions, sotalol did not modify renal function or urinary prostanoids in any of the three strains. Following NE stimulation, it potentiated the increase in renal vascular resistance of LL and LN controls but not that of LH rats. The pressure-natriuresis and the urinary prostanoids remained unchanged. BHT 933 elicited a weak stimulation of prostanoid release while AII markedly increased it and revealed, as did NE, the hyperactivity of the TxA2 synthase. It is concluded that the NE-induced stimulation of prostanoid synthesis does not involve beta-adrenoceptors and is unrelated to the associated hemodynamic changes. These results also demonstrate that the increased renal synthesis of TxA2 observed in LH rat kidney is not a specific response to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation and is likely to involve activation of the phosphoinositide pathway.", 
    "92": "Alcohol withdrawal is associated with a decrease in gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission. This explains the efficacy of benzodiazepines. However, an increase in adrenergic activity may also play a part in alcohol withdrawal symptoms, suggesting a potential efficacy of beta-blocking drugs. A double-blind comparative study of propranolol and diazepam was carried out in 28 patients suffering from moderate uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal. Patients were treated for 15 days with either 75 mg of propranolol or 30 mg of diazepam. The results show that both drugs at the dosages used are equipotent in reducing physical withdrawal symptoms and anxiety symptoms. This suggests that most likely the central as well as the peripheral effects determine the clinical usefulness of propranolol in the management of alcohol withdrawal. However, propranolol is ineffective in preventing major motor seizures, suggesting that different neurobiological mechanisms underlie the alcohol withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "93": "Substantial evidence has accumulated that in the human heart both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors coexist. As a rule, the amount of beta 2-adrenoceptors is higher in the atria (about 30% of the total beta-adrenoceptor population) than in the ventricular myocardium (about 20%). Both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors couple to adenylate cyclase and mediate positive inotropic effects of isoprenaline and adrenaline on isolated, electrically driven cardiac preparations. In the atria, stimulation of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors causes maximal increases in contractile force; in the ventricular myocardium, however, only beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation maximally increases contractile force, whereas beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation evokes only submaximal increases. On the other hand, noradrenaline induces its positive inotropic effect on atrial and ventricular preparations solely via beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation. Because nordadrenaline is the main transmitter of the human sympathetic nervous system, this indicates that under normal physiological conditions, the heart rate and contractility are under the control of cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors, whereas cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptors play only a minor role, if at all. However, in situations of stress, when large amounts of adrenaline (acting at both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors with the same affinity) are released from the adrenal medulla, activation of cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptors may contribute to an additional increase in heart rate and/or contractility. In chronic heart failure, cardiac beta-adrenoceptor function decreases (presumably due to endogenous \"downregulation\" by the elevated catecholamines) and this decrease is related to the severity of the disease (judged clinically by NYHA functional class).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "94": "Results of 16 international published studies (with a total of 397 patients in NYHA-classes II-III) concerning chronic therapy with beta-adrenoceptor blockade in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were analyzed. 8 studies were placebo controlled. Under beta-blockade cardiac output increased significantly by about 15% and ejection fraction by approximately 30%, apparently due to an improvement in contractility and relaxation of LV myocardium. Therapy was tolerated without complications in 93% of patients when the loading dose was 5 to 15 mg metoprolol/d (or equivalent) and a long-term dose of 100-200 mg/d metropolol (or equivalent) was reached within 4 weeks. Patients with severe heart failure (NYHA IV) had a higher risk of complications. A positive effect of beta-blockade in IDC was achieved in most cases but not earlier than after 2-3 months after initiating therapy. Despite these positive results beta-blockade in patients with IDC may not yet be recommended generally. Sufficient results of controlled trials are still lacking. Important questions with regard to the prognosis under beta-blockade, to the effects of cardioselectivity and intrinsic activity, and to the efficacy of this kind of therapy in the presence of ACE inhibitors have not been answered. Thus, major trials with controlled design are needed.", 
    "95": "Use of class-I antiarrhythmic agents (encainide, flecainide or moricizine) to suppress asymptomatic ventricular premature depolarizations does not decrease, but rather increases mortality from cardiac events after myocardial infarction. These patients should not be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs until improved survival is shown in a controlled clinical trial. In other clinical conditions such as symptomatic tachyarrhythmias class-I agents should only be used if the expected benefit outweighs the risk of an adverse cardiac effect. The development of new class-I drugs does not seem promising. Esmolol is the first intravenous and ultrashort-acting beta-adrenoceptor blocker that can be used to treat supraventricular arrhythmias in the critical care setting; in addition, it displays high cardioselectivity. Specific class-III antiarrhythmic agents including sematilide and dofetilide have been shown to be effective against ventricular tachyarrythmias in preclinical studies, but their clinical value remains to be established. Torsades de pointes arrhythmia is an undesirable side-effect closely coupled to specific class-III action that may limit their future use. The known pharmacological profiles and limited controlled clinical studies make amiodarone and sotalol promising candidates for drugs that may improve survival of patients at risk for sudden cardiac death.", 
    "96": "The effect of a long-term treatment with beta-receptor-antagonists after an established myocardial infarction is generally accepted. Beta-receptor-antagonists without intrinsic sympathicomimetic activity should be used, cardioselectivity is of lesser importance, except in patients with special problems (i.e. increased bronchial resistance, decreased peripheral blood flow etc.). Hydrophilic or lipophilic properties do not play any role. For primary prophylaxis in older hypertensives diuretics are the drugs of first line, in patients with high risk for heart- and blood-vessel diseases however beta-receptor-antagonists--eventually in combination with low doses of diuretics-should be chosen.", 
    "97": "One-year open Multicentric Isradipine Study (MIS) performed in 7 centres in Czechoslovakia included 144 patients with mild and moderate hypertension. Isradipine was given at a dose of 2.5 mg daily. If normalization of diastolic blood pressure (BP) had not been reached, the dosage was increased to 5 mg. Monotherapy with isradipine normalized diastolic BP in 44% of patients. Isradipine (5 mg daily) was combined with bopindolol in patients in whom isradipine alone failed to normalize diastolic BP. These had higher mean systolic and diastolic BP, body weight, erythrocyte and platelet counts at the beginning of the study. The combination of isradipine with bopindolol normalized diastolic BP in 87% of the group at the end of 48 weeks' treatment. Tolerance was excellent in 82% of patients. Treatment was discontinued in 8% patients, undesirable effects being the reason in 2%, ineffective therapy in 2% and poor adherence to therapy in 4%. Isradipine in monotherapy or in combination with bopindolol did not exert an adverse effect on the metabolic risk factors of ischaemic heart disease (cholesterol, glycaemia).", 
    "98": "Five potential beta-adrenoceptor blocking (BAB) compounds, alkylesters of 4-[(2-hydroxy-3-alkylamino)propoxy] phenylcarbamic acid, and eight calcium channel blockers (CB), i.e. nifedipine, nimodipine, niludipine, nitrendipine, verapamil, gallopamil, mepamil and diltiazem, were compared as to their inhibitory effect on thrombin induced aggregation of washed rat platelets and their effect on dynamics/disorder of liposomal membranes prepared from platelet lipids, studied by EPR spectroscopy of a lipid spin probe. The anti-aggregatory potency of the BAB and CB drugs was effective within the concentration range of 0.01-1 mmol/l. The antiaggregatory potency of BAB increased in the order BL-143 < BL-243 < BL-343 < BL-443 < BL-543 and among the CB, nifedipine and diltiazem were least potent, whereas nitrendipine and mepamil were the most potent drugs. The potency of the other CB tested was intermediate. The BAB drugs increased the dynamics/disorder of the liposomes in the same order as they inhibited platelet aggregation, whereas there was no relationship between antiaggregatory effect of CB and their influence on dynamics/disorder of the liposomes. Nifedipine, nimodipine, niludipine and nitrendipine had a minor perturbation effect on the liposomes, whereas verapamil, mepamil, gallopamil and diltiazem pronouncedly increased the dynamics/disorder of the hydrophobic part of the liposomes. The results indicate that the anti-aggregatory activity of BAB drugs may be mediated, at least partially, through their perturbation effect on the lipid part of biological membranes.", 
    "99": "To study the nature of adrenergic stimulation of ions and water reabsorption in the newt renal distal tubule, stationary microperfusion of the nephron and electron probe analysis were used. After application of norepinephrine (NE 10(-6) M) to the tubule surface, the fractional reabsorption of fluid increased from 15.0 +/- 3.1 to 41.30 +/- 10.4% (n = 7, p < 0.01), of Na+ from 69.30 +/- 6.6 to 79.10 +/- 7.5% (p < 0.05), Cl- from 63.30 +/- 7.6 to 72.40 +/- 7.9% (p < 0.05). Instead of secretion (control), there was reabsorption of K+. Fractional reabsorption of Ca2+ decreased from 51.00 +/- 6.0 to 43.00 +/- 7.0% (p < 0.05). The nonspecific alpha-adrenergic antagonist dibenamine 10(-6) M completely inhibited the effect of NE while, under the action of propranolol (2 x 10(-6) M) NE increased ion and water reabsorption significantly. When applied alone, or with NE, the specific alpha 2-adrenoblocker idazoxan, 2 x 10(-6) M, did not interfere with reabsorption in the distal tubule. At the same time, under the action of alpha 1-adrenoblocker prazosin 2 x 10(-6) M NE, increased the fractional reabsorption of fluid from 24.10 +/- 3.4 to 44.40 +/- 4.0% (n = 6, p < 0.001). These results serve as evidence that there exist specific alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the newt distal tubule the stimulation of which increases membrane permeability of the distal tubule to water, Na+, K+, Cl-, but not to Ca2+."
