    "0": "Vascular formation of prostacyclin is increased by propranolol in patients with essential hypertension. However, the possible effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in healthy subjects is, however, not known. We studied this issue by analysis of the urinary excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1a during intake of a beta 1-selective (metoprolol) or a non-selective (propranolol) beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. After 14 days of metoprolol treatment (100 mg d-1) the urinary excretion of PGI-M did not differ from control (253 +/- 77 vs. 220 +/- 33 pg mg-1 creatinine, respectively). Five days of randomized cross-over treatment with propranolol (80 mg day-1) or placebo did not affect urinary PGI-M significantly either (177 +/- 11 vs. 202 +/- 11 pg mg-1 creatinine, respectively). Furthermore, a daily increasing dose of propranolol (80-480 mg) progressively lowered resting blood pressure and heart rate, but failed to influence urinary excretion of PGI-M. The data demonstrate that metoprolol and propranolol do not affect basal cardiovascular formation of prostacyclin in healthy subjects. Thus, the biosynthesis of prostacyclin does not appear to be regulated by beta-adrenoceptor activity under normal conditions.", 
    "1": "About 10% of survivors of an acute myocardial infarction will die in the following year. Thereafter the risk declines but reinfarction is still an important cause of mortality and morbidity. The post infarction trials have clearly shown that the best proven agents to mitigate this toll are aspirin, beta adrenoceptor blockers, and verapamil (but not other calcium blockers, except diltiazem for non Q wave infarction). In the context of hypertension treatment these post infarction trials may have important lessons for drug selection and ancillary treatment since the majority of subjects will ultimately die of ischaemic heart disease. Although the newer agents such as ACE and renin inhibitors, newer calcium channel blockers and alpha blockers have many promising properties in terms of risk factor reduction, no convincing mortality data exists; it is needed. This review will deal with the known effects (both good and bad) of antihypertensive agents and will also review other drug strategies relevant to the hypertensive patient. It will also point out large areas of ignorance.", 
    "2": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk indicator of cardiovascular disease. Obtaining reversal of hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy seems to be a desirable objective of antihypertensive treatment. A total of 2,357 patients were included in a meta-analysis on the effect of antihypertensive pharmacological therapy on LVH. Overall left ventricular mass (LVM) was reduced by 11.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 10.1-13.7) in parallel with a reduction of mean arterial pressure of 14.9% (CI 14.0 to 15.8). When evaluating the effect of first-line therapies on calculated LVM using the same formula for all studies, the absolute reductions in g were 44.7 (ACE-inhibitors), 22.8 (beta-blockers), 26.9 (calcium antagonists) and 21.4 (diuretics) when adjusted for differences between studies (ANCOVA). It can be concluded that effective antihypertensive therapy reduces LVM. ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists reduce LVM by reducing wall hypertrophy, the effect of ACE-inhibitors being the most pronounced. Diuretics reduce LVM mainly through an effect on left ventricular inner diameter. How these effects affect prognosis is still an open question.", 
    "3": "Pigeons were fed a fixed amount of grain-based feed and behavior was observed after administration of doses of ditolyguanidine (DTG), (+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)-piperidine [(+)-3-PPP], dextromethorphan, haloperidol, (+)-N-allylnormetazocine (NANM), alpha-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(5-fluoro-2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazine-butanol (BMY-14802) apomorphine, pentobarbital, propranolol, and MK-801. Of the drugs tested, DTG, dextromethorphan, and (+)-3-PPP each produced dose-related increases in the percentage of pigeons exhibiting an emetic response. The emetic response produced by DTG was antagonized by haloperidol and BMY-14802 but not by propranolol. These observations suggest that the emetic response in the pigeon may be mediated by sigma sites and is unlikely to be mediated by phencyclidine receptors.", 
    "4": "The aim of the present study was to investigate beta-adrenoceptor modulation of noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerves in superfused cortical kidney slices of 4-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched controls (WKY). After preincubation with 3H-noradrenaline the kidney slices were electrically stimulated in superfusion chambers. The stimulation induced (S-I) outflow of radioactivity was mainly composed of unmetabolized 3H-noradrenaline in both strains and thus taken as an index of noradrenaline release. There was a frequency-dependent (1.25-20 Hz) increase in the S-I outflow of radioactivity. At all stimulation frequencies tested S-I outflow of radioactivity was similar or even slightly lower in SHR than in WKY kidney slices in either the absence or presence of cocaine (10 mumol/l). The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonists isoprenaline (0.1 mumol/l) and adrenaline (0.01 and 0.1 mumol/l) enhanced S-I outflow of radioactivity. The facilitatory effects of isoprenaline (0.1 mumol/l) and adrenaline (0.1 mumol/l) were blocked by the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551 (0.1 mumol/l) but not by the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (0.3 mumol/l). The cell-permeable cAMP analogue 8-bromo-cAMP (300 mumol/l) enhanced S-I outflow of radioactivity to a similar extent in both SHR and WKY kidney slices. A combination of 8-bromo-cAMP (300 mumol/l) and adrenaline (0.1 mumol/l) did not enhance S-I outflow of radioactivity to a greater extent than 8-bromo cAMP (300 mumol/l) alone in both strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "Since drug therapy of angina is likely to produce a similar degree of efficacy for most drugs in common use, treatment choice should additionally focus on other factors, notably adverse events, quality of life, and convenience. Improvements in these factors can also lead to better compliance and can aid the doctor by cutting down the number of patient visits required to optimize therapy. The authors have evaluated the patient's overall assessment of symptomatic relief and adverse experiences in a comparative manner by means of the two-period crossover design using the patient's declared treatment preference as the primary measurement. This encapsulates several factors in a single assessment that can be understood by both physician and patient. The authors carried out two such studies of epanolol (Visacor), a novel anti-anginal agent with both beta-1 selective antagonist activity and also beta-1 selective partial agonist activity. In one study (n = 608) the comparator was metoprolol, and in the other (n = 571) it was nifedipine. This article describes and evaluates the methodology of these studies. To assess preference optimally, each patient had to receive both treatments in short but clinically relevant treatment periods, with no washout. Re-entry into the second period, after withdrawal from the first, was permitted. Both studies showed advantages for epanolol, more marked in the case of nifedipine, arising from equivalent efficacy but fewer adverse events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "The direct effect of noradrenaline on renin release from juxtaglomerular (JG) cells in vitro were investigated in a dynamic superfusion system of dispersed rat renal cortical cells. At low concentrations (1-100 nmol/l), noradrenaline stimulated renin release in a dose-dependent manner, while at higher concentrations (0.1-1 mmol/l) it inhibited renin release. The stimulatory effect of 0.1 mumol noradrenaline/l was completely blocked by a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (0.1 mumol/l). When applied at concentrations of 1 mumol/l or 10 mumol/l, noradrenaline had no consistent effect on renin release, although 10 mumol noradrenaline/l had an inhibitory effect in the presence of propranolol (0.1 mumol/l). The inhibitory effect of noradrenaline (0.1 mmol/l) was converted to a stimulatory effect by the addition of an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist (bunazosin, 1 mumol/l), but was not altered by the addition of an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist (yohimbine, 1 mumol/l). These results indicate that low concentrations of noradrenaline directly stimulate renin release from JG cells by the activation of beta-adrenoceptors, while high concentrations of noradrenaline inhibit renin release by the activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Accordingly, a dynamic balance may exist between beta-adrenergic stimulation and alpha 1-adrenergic depression of renin release.", 
    "7": "A randomized, masked study measuring postoperative intraocular pressure at 4, 8, and 24 hours, two to seven days, and one month after planned extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber lens implantation was conducted. Seven commonly used ocular hypotensive agents and a control, given at the completion of surgery, were compared: timolol maleate (Timoptic), levobunolol hydrochloride (Betagan), betaxolol hydrochloride (Betoptic), pilocarpine hydrochloride (Pilopine Gel), carbachol (Miostat), apraclonidine hydrochloride (Iopidine), acetazolamide (Diamox). There were significant differences between agents. Miostat was the most effective in controlling postoperative IOP, followed by Timoptic. Diamox, Pilopine Gel, and Betagan were equally effective. Betoptic was somewhat less effective and Iopidine was not significantly better than the control.", 
    "8": "The antiarrhythmic effect of esmolol, a selective beta 1 adrenoreceptor blocker, was evaluated in the presence of epinephrine induced arrhythmias in dogs (n = 6). The arrhythmogenic dose of epinephrine (ADE) during 1.2 MAC halothane in dogs was increased from 3.23 +/- 0.25 (mean +/- SD) to 30.90 +/- 3.56 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 (P less than 0.001) by the prior administration of esmolol 0.5 microgram.kg-1 bolus followed by an infusion at the rate of 150 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. Higher esmolol infusion doses of 200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 further increased ADE to 99.0 +/- 2.92 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 (P less than 0.001). After discontinuation of esmolol and during continued halothane anaesthesia, ventricular tachycardia was induced by increasing the infusion rate of the 100 micrograms.ml-1 solution of epinephrine. In all dogs ventricular tachycardia was restored to sinus rhythm by a bolus dose of esmolol (1 microgram.kg-1). We conclude that esmolol pretreatment increases the ADE during halothane anaesthesia in dogs. Our data suggest that esmolol may be useful as an antiarrhythmic agent in the management of epinephrine-related ventricular arrhythmias during anaesthesia in man.", 
    "9": "The functional significance of beta 2-adrenoceptors in atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction was investigated by using canine isolated blood-perfused AV node preparations. Dose-dependent shortening of the atrio-His bundle (A-H) interval by dl-procaterol hydrochloride hemihydrate (0.03-1 nmol) injected intra-arterially into the AV node artery was affected little by an infusion of dl-atenolol (10 nmol/min) into the same artery, whereas the dose-response curve for the positive dromotropic effect of procaterol was shifted markedly to the right by approximately 1.5 and 2.5 log units with ICI 118551 [erythro-dl-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylamino-bu tan-2-ol]- hydrochloride (1 and 10 nmol/min). The positive dromotropic effect of dl-T-1583 [alpha-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylaminomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxybenzyl- alcohol] hydrochloride (30-300 pmol), a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, was shifted to the right by approximately 1.2 log units with dl-atenolol (10 nmol/min) but was affected little by ICI 118551 (10 nmol/min). The dose-response curve for l-isoproterenol hydrochloride (3-100 pmol) was shifted to the right by 0.7 log unit with ICI 118551 (10 nmol/min) and by 1.7 log units with atenolol (10 nmol/min). The dose-response curve for dl-norepinephrine (0.03-1 nmol) was shifted to the right by 1.0 log unit with atenolol only, whereas the curve for l-epinephrine (0.03-1 nmol) was shifted by 0.45 log unit with ICI 118551 (10 nmol/min). These results suggest that both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, which coexist on the AV node, play a functional role in AV nodal conduction.", 
    "10": "We investigated the effects of the inhalational anesthetic halothane on autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation of the baseline pulmonary vascular pressure-flow (P/Q) relationship compared with that measured in the conscious state. Multipoint pulmonary vascular P/Q plots were constructed by stepwise constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava to decrease venous return and Q. P/Q plots were generated in the same dogs in the conscious state and during halothane anesthesia (approximately 1.2% end tidal) in the intact (no drug) condition and after administration of selective ANS antagonists. In conscious dogs, sympathetic alpha 1-adrenoreceptor block with prazosin decreased (P less than 0.01) the pulmonary vascular pressure gradient [pulmonary arterial pressure-pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAP-PAWP)] over the entire range of Q studied; i.e., inhibition of endogenous alpha 1-adrenoreceptor activity caused pulmonary vasodilation. In contrast, alpha 1-adrenoreceptor block had no effect on PAP-PAWP at any value of Q during halothane anesthesia. In conscious dogs, sympathetic beta-adrenoreceptor block with propranolol increased (P less than 0.01) PAP-PAWP over the entire range of Q studied; i.e., inhibition of endogenous beta-adrenoreceptor activity resulted in pulmonary vasoconstriction. However, beta-adrenoreceptor block had no effect on PAP-PAWP at any value of Q during halothane anesthesia. Finally, cholinergic receptor block with atropine decreased (P less than 0.05) PAP-PAWP at values of Q greater than 100 ml.min-1.kg-1 in conscious dogs but had no effect on PAP-PAWP at any value of Q during halothane anesthesia. These results indicate that endogenous ANS regulation of the baseline pulmonary vascular P/Q relationship observed in conscious dogs is abolished during halothane anesthesia.", 
    "11": "The efficacy of epanolol vs. metoprolol in stable angina pectoris was compared in 114 patients recruited to a randomized double-blind cross-over study, consisting of a 4-week period on each drug. Epanolol (200 mg) or metoprolol (200 mg) was administered daily. Bicycle ergometry was performed at the end of each treatment period. The maximum workload was 134 +/- 18 W on epanolol and 133 +/- 37 W on metoprolol (NS). Values for resting heart rate (epanolol, 72 +/- 11 beats min-1; metoprolol, 64 +/- 12 beats min-1; P less than 0.001), systolic blood pressure (epanolol, 143 +/- 21 mmHg; metoprolol, 137 +/- 21 mmHg; P less than 0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (epanolol, 88 +/- 10 mmHg; metoprolol, 84 +/- 11 mmHg; P less than 0.01) were all higher on epanolol treatment. During exercise, the increase in heart rate and blood pressure was of similar magnitude during the two treatment periods, and these parameters did not differ significantly at the last identical workload. The rating of chest pain, fatigue and dyspnoea did not differ between the two drugs during submaximal or maximal exercise. In conclusion, 200 mg of epanolol and metoprolol have similar efficacy with regard to exercise tolerance. As expected from the partial agonist activity present in epanolol but not in metoprolol, the former drug resulted in a higher heart rate and blood pressure at rest. The observed increase in these parameters during exercise was similar for both drugs.", 
    "12": "To examine the concentration of serum lipoproteins and the association of their genetic variation with the occurrence of coronary artery disease (CAD), composite serum lipoprotein profiles including lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), apolipoprotein (apo) E phenotypes, and apo B Xba I genotypes were determined in patients with angiographically verified CAD (CAD+ group, n = 111) and in subjects with no angiographic evidence of CAD (CAD- group, n = 46). In addition, we determined the concentrations of serum lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins in 96 healthy controls. Both CAD- and CAD+ groups had lower concentrations of apos A-I and A-II but higher concentrations of serum total and very low density lipoprotein triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol than did healthy controls. The mean concentrations of serum total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and the median values of Lp(a) were similar in the CAD+ and CAD- groups, both having higher concentrations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and apo B than the healthy controls. Irrespective of gender, patients with CAD had significantly lower serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol than did those without CAD (1.48 +/- 0.40 versus 1.16 +/- 0.29 mmol/l, p less than 0.001). In women, the mean serum total and very low density lipoprotein triglyceride concentration was also higher in the CAD+ than in the CAD- group. The frequency of the apo E4 allele (epsilon 4) was significantly higher in the CAD+ group (0.293) than in the CAD- group (0.174; p less than 0.001). The frequencies of the two apo B alleles, X1 (Xba I restriction site absent) and X2 (Xba I restriction site present), were similar in the two groups. Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that in men, serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol had the highest power to discriminate for CAD. In addition, the concentration of plasma apo B levels and the occurrence of apo E phenotypes were independently associated with CAD in men. In women, the only independent factor associated with CAD after adjustment for beta-blocker and diuretics usage was the concentration of serum triglycerides.", 
    "13": "Pimobendan (UD-CG 115 BS), an inotropic agent and inhibitor of type III phosphodiesterase activity, is demethylated in vivo to form UD-CG 212 Cl, which is a more potent type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor. This study examined cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated actions of UD-CG 212 Cl. In guinea pig papillary muscles, UD-CG 212 Cl increased cAMP and stimulated Ca(++)-dependent slow action potentials (APs) in a dose-dependent manner. When compared to previous studies using pimobendan, UD-CG 212 Cl was approximately 100-fold more potent. UD-CG 212 Cl had no additional effects on slow APs in the presence of a maximal dose of isoproterenol (1 microM). Propranolol had little effect on UD-CG 212 Cl-induced slow APs. These results, along with previous studies, indicate that slow AP induction by UD-CG 212 Cl was cAMP-dependent, and the increase in cAMP levels was most likely due to phosphodiesterase inhibition and not beta receptor stimulation. Experiments with tetraethylammonium.Cl suggested that UD-CG 212 Cl probably did not induce slow APs by blocking K+ channels. In voltage-clamped ventricular myocytes UD-CG 212 Cl (100 microM) could stimulate Ca++ current (+21 +/- 5%) when basal cAMP levels were enhanced with a submaximal dose of isoproterenol (10(-9)-10(-8) M). Isoproterenol was not required to observe the stimulating effect of UD-CG 212 Cl on Ca++ current in intact, nondialyzed cells prepared using the nystatin-perforated patch method. Studies with the stereoisomers of UD-CG 212 Cl showed that the D-isomer was more potent than the L-isomer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "Indirect evidence suggests that beta-1 adrenoceptors in the guinea pig ileum are innervated but it has not been determined whether \"atypical\" beta adrenoceptors also receive a postganglionic sympathetic innervation. To answer this question, experiments were undertaken using electrical stimulation of para-arterial sympathetic neurons to evoke relaxation in isolated segments of guinea pig ileum. Tension was developed in the ileal segments by either transmural electrical field stimulation to evoke the cholinergic \"twitch\" response, or by histamine to produce a steady-state contracture. Para-arterial sympathetic nerve stimulation evoked a frequency-dependent inhibition of the twitch response which was blocked by guanethidine and restored by dexamphetamine, indicating typical noradrenergic transmission. In preparations contracted with histamine and pretreated with benextramine to block alpha adrenoceptors, para-arterial sympathetic nerve stimulation evoked frequency-dependent relaxations which were reduced in magnitude but not abolished by the following beta adrenoceptor antagonists: bromoacetylalprenololmenthane (1 microM) or a combination of ICI 118,551 (0.3 microM) and CGP 20712A (0.1 microM). Remaining responses were blocked by compounds exhibiting affinity for atypical beta adrenoceptors, (-)-alprenolol (3 microM) and nadolol (300 microM), as well as the agonist (-)-isoproterenol (10 microM; to saturate the atypical beta adrenoceptor). However, relaxations to papaverine were unaffected by these treatments. Experiments revealed that potential cotransmitters (ATP, neuropeptide Y and somatostatin) do not appear to play a detectable role in relaxations produced by para-arterial sympathetic nerve stimulation. The results demonstrate, for the first time, that atypical beta adrenoceptors in guinea pig ileum receive a noradrenergic innervation.", 
    "15": "Pericytes are contractile cells that might help regulate microvascular blood flow. To understand their potential role in the regulatory responses of the retina and optic nerve head vessels, the response of pericytes isolated from bovine retinal microvessels was determined to oxotremorine, isoproterenol, phenylephrine, and clonidine. Isoproterenol doubled the basal levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) specifically through beta-adrenergic receptors, because the effect was blocked by dl-propranolol. The alpha 1 agonist phenylephrine did not induce any major change in adenylate cyclase activity. The alpha 2 agonist clonidine decreased basal cAMP synthesis and reduced the effect of isoproterenol. The cholinergic agonist oxotremorine did not modify the basal activity of adenylate cyclase but was able to decrease by almost 50% the forskolin-induced increase of cAMP. These results suggest that pericytes have functional adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, and they might respond to autonomic vasoactive substances present in vivo.", 
    "16": "In view of the likely prohypertensive effects of hyperinsulinemia and the presence of insulin resistance in primary hypertension, the effects of various antihypertensive therapies on insulin sensitivity need to be identified. The evidence strongly supports major beneficial effects of weight reduction and aerobic exercise. Deleterious effects have been shown for diuretics and most beta-blockers, whereas probable beneficial effects have been seen with alpha-blockers, one angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and various calcium entry blockers. Improvement of insulin sensitivity and reduction of plasma insulin levels are desirable attributes of antihypertensive therapy that should be more carefully considered in the future.", 
    "17": "Identification of patients with angina but normal coronary arteriograms (syndrome X) using noninvasive means would be desirable. The ability of four established exercise electrocardiographic methods to identify angina patients with and without coronary artery disease was compared with that of a method based on a combination of the above (combined method). A treadmill score, a multivariate method, the ST segment recovery loop, the ST/heart rate adjustment, and the combined method were applied to 112 patients who had typical exertional angina and positive exercise tests (greater than 1 mm ST segment depression); 90 had documented coronary artery disease and 22 had syndrome X. The combined method and the treadmill score had a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy (both 81%, as 91 of the 112 patients were correctly identified by both methods) than the multivariate (66%) and ST segment recovery loop (64%) methods (p less than 0.05). The ST/heart rate adjustment had a lower sensitivity for syndrome X than any other method (1 of 22). Thus methods that involve the assessment of both ST and non ST segment variables have greater accuracy in separating syndrome X and coronary artery disease patients than methods relying more heavily on ST segment changes.", 
    "18": "Aminophylline and beta-adrenergic agonists are widely used in the treatment of obstructive lung diseases. It has been suggested that combined aminophylline and beta-agonist therapy may promote the development of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. The effects of these agents in combination on myocardial conduction and tissue refractoriness have not been documented. We evaluated the electrophysiologic effects of intravenous aminophylline and inhaled metaproterenol on canine myocardium. Aminophylline produced significant decreases from baseline in the AH interval (85 +/- 6.5 [SD] to 63 +/- 4.1 ms [p less than 0.02]), Wenckebach cycle length (WCL) (226 +/- 8.7 to 182 +/- 5.8 ms [p less than 0.02]), and ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) (166 +/- 6.0 to 148 +/- 4.9 ms [p less than 0.01]). Metaproterenol produced similar results, except metaproterenol significantly decreased the atrial effective refractory period (AERP) from 152 +/- 6.6 to 130 +/- 3.2 ms (p less than 0.02), an effect not seen with aminophylline alone. Metaproterenol also produced significantly greater reductions in AH interval and WCL, as well as a greater increase in heart rate than aminophylline did. When compared with aminophylline alone, combined metaproterenol and aminophylline therapy produced significantly greater reductions in the AH interval (63 +/- 4.1 versus 48 +/- 1.2 ms for combined therapy [p less than 0.01]), HV interval (32 +/- 1.2 versus 28 +/- 2.0 ms for combined therapy [p less than 0.02]), WCL (182 +/- 5.8 versus 150 +/- 7.1 ms for combined therapy [p less than 0.02]), and VERP (148 +/- 4.9 versus 132 +/- 2.0 ms for combined therapy [p less than 0.02]). We conclude that both aminophylline and metaproterenol significantly enhance AV nodal and His-Purkinje conduction. Metaproterenol produced significant changes in both atrial and ventricular tissue refractoriness. Metaproterenol produced significantly greater changes than aminophylline alone, and inhaled metaproterenol combined with intravenous aminophylline produced greater changes in AV nodal and His-Purkinje conduction and ventricular refractoriness than did aminophylline alone in a canine model.", 
    "19": "A 72-year-old woman with 5-year history of essential hypertension developed peritoneal tuberculosis. The patient's hypertension, which had been well-controlled by long-acting nifedipine, deteriorated after the administration of rifampicin, an antitubercular agent. During use of nifedipine and rifampicin, both the peak plasma concentration and the area under the curve of nifedipine decreased markedly to about 40% of those without rifampicin. The findings suggest that rifampicin may increase the elimination of nifedipine, presumably by induction of its hepatic metabolism. Nisoldipine, another calcium antagonist, also failed to lower the patient's blood pressure, when given in combination with rifampicin. Taken together, these findings indicate that more caution should be urged when calcium antagonist is prescribed along with rifampicin.",

    "21": "The failure of encainide and flecainide to reduce mortality after infarction in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial and the failure of low-dose amiodarone to prevent sudden cardiac death in patients with a low left ventricular ejection fraction has shifted attention to other strategies, such as beta-adrenergic blocking agents, to prevent sudden cardiac death. Evidence suggesting that beta-adrenergic blocking agents might be useful, especially in patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction, is accumulating. Previous data from studies using beta-adrenergic blocking agents and the mechanisms by which beta-adrenergic blocking agents might be of value in preventing sudden cardiac death are reviewed. These considerations and the availability of new investigational beta-adrenergic blocking agents with vasodilator properties provide a new opportunity to test the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic blocking agents are useful in preventing sudden cardiac death, especially in patients with a low left ventricular ejection fraction.", 
    "22": "At rest, most of left ventricular (LV) filling occurs early in diastole. This LV filling occurs in response to the pressure gradient produced as LV pressure falls below left atrial (LA) pressure. Because mitral valve flow occurs in response to an LA to LV pressure gradient, augmented diastolic mitral valve flow during exercise may be due to an increased mitral valve pressure gradient resulting from a rise in LA pressure and/or a fall in LV early diastolic pressure. Accordingly, we studied 13 conscious dogs, instrumented to measure micromanometer LV and LA pressures, and determined LV volume from three ultrasonic dimensions during exercise. The animals ran on a treadmill for 8-15 minutes at 5-8 miles/hr. With reflexes intact, during exercise, the heart rate increased from 116 +/- 20 to 189 +/- 24 beats per minute (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.01), the maximum rate of change of LV volume (dV/dtmax) increased from 185 +/- 44 to 282 +/- 76 ml/sec (p less than 0.01), the ejection fraction and cardiac output increased, and the duration of diastole decreased from 296 +/- 83 to 162 +/- 71 msec (p less than 0.01). Mitral valve opening pressure, mean LA pressure (10.9 +/- 4.4 versus 10.2 +/- 3.9 mm Hg, p = NS), and LV end-diastolic pressure (12.8 +/- 4.8 versus 13.1 +/- 3.3 mm Hg, p = NS) were all relatively unchanged. The time constant of the fall of isovolumic LV pressure decreased from 28 +/- 3.3 to 21 +/- 4.4 msec (p less than 0.05). The early diastolic portion of the LV pressure-volume loop was shifted downward during exercise, with the minimum LV pressure decreasing from 3.3 +/- 2.8 to -2.8 +/- 3.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and the maximum mitral valve pressure gradient increasing from 5.5 +/- 1.7 to 11.8 +/- 3.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). A similar downward shift of the early diastolic portion of the LV pressure-volume loop was produced by infusion of dobutamine (6 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) at rest, as well as by exercise when the heart rate was held constant by right ventricular pacing at 190-210 beats per minute. The downward shift during exercise was prevented by beta-blockade (metoprolol, 0.5 mg/kg i.v.). We conclude that during exercise, sympathetic stimulation and tachycardia produce a downward shift of the early diastolic portion of the LV pressure-volume loop.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The blood pressure lowering efficacy of atenolol 50 mg o.d. and enalapril 20 mg o.d. was compared in hypertensives at rest, during 24 hours, and during dynamic and isometric exercise. The efficacy of enalapril and lisinopril (two ACE inhibitors with different durations of action) were also compared, with special focus on the early morning hours.", 
    "25": "Men and women classified as normotensives clearly differed from those with hypertension, also when blood pressure was recorded with ambulatory technique. The number of correctly classified subjects did not differ between self-BP and office-BP; combining the two added little. Atenolol reduced blood pressure better during dynamic exercise than did enalapril, while there was no significant difference in effect between enalapril and lisinopril, not even 18-24 hours post-dose.", 
    "26": "More comprehensive blood pressure measurements should be considered in the evaluation of hypertension treatment. Office BP, however, seems a reasonably good tool for diagnosing hypertension.", 
    "27": "Carteolol is a nonselective beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (I.S.A.). A multicenter trial was started to check if the theoretical advantages of this new drug could also be confirmed in a clinical setting. The intraocular pressure (I.O.P.), the visual field and the adverse reactions were evaluated at day 8, 60, 360 and 960. The results of this study demonstrate that carteolol effectively lowers the I.O.P. with minimal adverse side effects in previously treated as well as untreated patients.", 
    "28": "Adult offsprings of Wistar female rats treated during pregnancy (days 1-20) with nicotine (1 mg/kg s.c.,b.i.d.), were tested in order to detect possible alterations in the reactivity of the cardiovascular system to sympathetic agonists. Dose-response curves to the pressor response of noradrenaline (NA) did not show any differences between control and experimental animals. However, cumulative dose-response curves to the chronotropic effect of NA on isolated atria were significantly shifted to the right in nicotine prenatal treated rats than in controls. Accordingly, 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding was significantly reduced in hearts of experimental animals as compared with controls, without any change in affinity. These data demonstrate long lasting deleterious effects induced by prenatal nicotine exposure, probably resulting from alterations in the sympathetic system during the developing stage.", 
    "29": "In heavily infected young patients, there is a \"non-congestive\" phase of the disease with splenomegaly which can improve after chemotherapy. A strong correlation between hepatosplenic form and worm burden in young patients has been repeatedly shown. The pattern of vascular intrahepatic lesions, seems to depend on two mechanisms: (a) egg embolization, with a partial blocking of the portal vasculature; (b) the appearance of small portal collaterals along the intrahepatic portal system. The role played by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and C virus infections in the pathogenesis of liver lesions is variably considered. Selective arteriography shows a reduced diameter of hepatic artery with thin and arched branches outlining vascular gaps. A rich arterial network, as described in autopsy cases, is usually not seen in vivo, except after splenectomy or shunt surgery. An augmented hepatic arterial flow was demonstrated in infected animals. These facts suggest that the poor intrahepatic arterial vascularization demonstrated by selective arteriography in humans is due to a \"functional deviation\" of arterial blood to the splenic territory. The best results obtained in treatment of portal hypertension were: esophagogastric devascularization and splenectomy (EGDS), although risk of rebleeding persists; classical (proximal) splenorenal shunt (SRS) should be abandoned; distal splenorenal shunt may complicate with hepatic encephalopathy, although later and in a lower percentage than in SRS. Propranolol is currently under investigation. In our Department, schistosomatic patients with esophageal varices bleeding are treated by EGDS and, if rebleeding occurs, by sclerosis of the varices.", 
    "30": "The activity of hypothalamic adenylate cyclase was studied throughout the estrous cycle of the female rat. The activity of the enzyme was determined in particulate fractions obtained from hypothalami of rats killed at 10.00 h and 16.00 h of the 4-day estrous cycle. The activity was assayed in the presence of norepinephrine (10(-8) to 10(-3) M) by the capacity to produce adenosine 3',5' cyclic monophosphate. The basal activity of adenylate cyclase was higher in the morning of estrus than at any other time during the cycle. Norepinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, as assessed by the apparent affinity (Kd) and apparent maximum effect, varied during the cycle, showing highest affinity, lowest Kd, in the afternoon of proestrus. The highest level of apparent maximum effect was also found in the afternoon of proestrus declining on diestrous day 2, diestrous day 1 and estrus. The norepinephrine stimulated activity was significantly inhibited by phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-blocker, in the morning of diestrus day 1, whereas on the day of diestrus day 2 and proestrus it was inhibited by the beta-adrenoblocker, propranolol. A similar degree of inhibition by alpha- and beta-blockers was observed in the morning of estrus. These results indicate that the hypothalamic adenylate cyclase coupled to adrenergic receptors shows dynamic changes throughout the estrous cycle.", 
    "31": "Alpha-blockers tend to normalize central hemodynamics and only modestly reduce the systolic blood pressure-heart rate (SBP x HR) product. Similarly, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists normalize central hemodynamics, but at the expense of an increased heart rate (which tends to normalize chronic treatment). Non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists tend to reduce resting heart rate. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors normalize central hemodynamics with no change in heart rate. Classic beta-blockers, particularly the non-selective agents, lower heart rate and cardiac output at rest and during exercise, with a reflex increase in total peripheral resistance (TPR), which lessens with chronic therapy. With dual-acting beta-blockers like carvedilol, the fall in blood pressure is accompanied by a fall in TPR and only a modest drop in cardiac output; the increase in AVO2 difference is less marked with carvedilol compared to a classic beta-blocker, suggesting that the body's reserve mechanisms may be less reduced.",

The exercise training was performed 5 times a week for 13 weeks on a motor treadmill, at 1.0 mph, 15% grade for 60 min. 2. Heart rate (HR) was recorded at rest and during exercise, 15% grade at 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 mph, for 3 min per stage. Vagal and sympathetic effects were studied after the administration of methylatropine (3 mg/kg) and propranolol (4 mg/kg). 3. Exercise training significantly attenuated cardiac acceleration at 0.8 (441 +/- 8 vs 486 +/- 9 bpm in S, P < 0.05) and 1.0 mph (466 +/- 12 vs 508 +/- 6 bpm in S, P < 0.05). The vagal effect was significantly increased in the T group at 0.8 (72 +/- 5 vs 32 +/- 10 bpm in S, P < 0.05) and 1.0 mph (46 +/- 8 vs 15 +/- 7 bpm in S, P < 0.05).

    "33": "It is well-known that ketamine (Kt) anaesthesia produces a rise in blood pressure and heart rate in man. These cardiostimulatory effects were adscribed to several factors such as: a) increased sympathetic nervous system activity by direct stimulation of central nervous structures, b) increased catecholamine release from the peripheral sympathetic system, c) high plasmatic renin levels. However, the quantitative participation of these mechanisms in the cardiovascular effects of this anaesthetic agent is unknown. While some authors have shown a major rise in serum renin activity in experimental anaesthesia, others have been unable to confirm these results. The present study was undertaken to assess if the cardiostimulatory effects of Kt anaesthesia were due to an activation of renin-angiotensin system or to increased sympathetic activity. In consequence we used rats treated with enalapril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or propranolol prior to anaesthetic procedures. Thirty male Wistar and six spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) weighing 240-300 g were used in all the experiments. The rats were randomly grouped into six groups. I- Non-anaesthetized rats, II- Anaesthetized rats (trained in the experimental procedures), III- Anaesthetized rats (without training), IV- Anaesthetized rats previously treated with enalapril, V- Anaesthetized rats pretreated with propranolol, VI- SHR treated with enalapril. The rats of groups IV and VI received enalapril p.o. for three weeks (25 mg/Kg body wt). The animals of group V were submitted to acute beta-adrenergic blockade. Propranolol dose: 10 mg/Kg body wt, was given i.p. 15 min before Kt anaesthesia.

    "34": "The effects of chronic propranolol (Prop) therapy on the postinfarction myocardial hypertrophy of infarcted rats were studied by histological techniques. Male albino rats were submitted to left coronary artery ligation to produce infarction or to sham surgery (Con, N = 6). Infarcted rats (Inf) were divided into 2 groups receiving Prop (2.5 mg/kg, twice a day, N = 6) or saline (N = 6) for one month, respectively. Myocyte diameters were measured in longitudinally oriented sections in the four heart chambers (60 cells/chamber). Inf produced a significant increase in mean diameter of myocytes from the right atrium and ventricle and from the left atrium. In the right ventricle, myocyte diameter increased from 8.9 +/- 0.5 microns in the Con group to 12.5 +/- 0.6 microns in the Inf group (P < 0.05). Under Prop, myocyte diameter was reduced (P < 0.05) to 9.8 +/- 0.9 microns. Similar values were observed in the right atrium. In the left atrium, Prop produced only a partial reversion of the postinfarction hypertrophy. In the left ventricle, myocyte diameter was not significantly changed after Inf or Prop therapy. These data show that beta blockers reduce the myocardial hypertrophy in the right heart chambers after experimental infarcts in rats. This effect can be secondary to reduction of pulmonary hypertension or to blockade of direct effects of catecholamines on myocardial fibers or both.", 
    "35": "Varices of the colostomy are a rare complication of colostomy performed in patients with portal hypertension. This work is based on 14 cases. The colic stomy is the terminal operation in surgery for cancer in twelve cases, and a bypass stomy in two cases. Portal hypertension is due to cirrhosis in 10 cases and to metastases to the liver in 4 cases. All 14 colostomy varices were expressed by bleeding. In 7 cases, oesophageal varices were detected with fiberendoscopy. Only one of these patients had an upper digestive hemorrhage. Colostomy hemorrhages are the revealing complication and the main sign of the disease. The emergent treatment of bleeding of the colostomy must combine several methods, most often consecutively: local compression, ligation, sclerotherapy. Once bleeding is controlled, the radical treatment must be primarily medical (hygienic and dietary habits, beta-adrenergic blocking agents), but complementary surgery may prove to be necessary, most often to redo the colostomy with additional deconnection. The prognosis mainly depends on the function of the liver, the deterioration of which is accelerated by the successive hemorrhagic accidents. Hepatorenal failure is the main cause of death.", 
    "36": "Free-radical lipid peroxidation (FRLP) during experimental myocardial ischaemia and infarction was studied on the first author's model using coronary occlusion in more than 1500 albino rats. FRLP was tested at various intervals after coronary occlusion (from the 20th minute to 14--30 days) in myocardial lipid extracts using various methods: 1) chemiluminescent method determining the intensity of free radical reactions, 2) diene conjugate production, 3) malone dialdehyde reaction, 4) Schiff bases fluorometric determination. The severity of ischaemia and infarction was assessed according to electrocardiographic, light and electron microscopic findings and morphometry of the damaged area. Intensified FRLP was registered in all four indicators at most tests performed within the first 14 days after production of ischaemia and infarction. The severity of ischaemic lesion could be reduced by FRLP inhibition using antioxidative agents of sharply differing chemical nature (sodium selenite, alpha-tocopherol a.o.). The authors conclude that FRLP intensification plays a role in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischaemia and infarction, and recommend to include antioxidative drugs in comprehensive heart protection.", 
    "37": "The effects of i.p. piroxicam administration on hepatic glycogen levels and enzymatic activities of key enzymes involved into glycogen metabolism in fed female rats were studied. Liver glycogen concentrations in treated rats decreased with increasing time of treatment and doses of piroxicam administered. The fall in glycogen caused by piroxicam persisted for several days after it was discontinued. Neither nadolol nor phenobarbital administration were able to prevent the depleting effect of piroxicam. In the treated rats, glucose-6-phosphatase, glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase activities remained unchanged respect to control. Also, proportion of phosphorylase in the active (a) form was not significantly affected by successive piroxicam daily doses. In contrast, we demonstrated a decrease in the glycogen synthase in the active I form. This reduction was time-dependent on piroxicam treatment. Further, glucose loads were not capable to restore activity in the synthase enzyme and liver glycogen synthesis in animals treated with piroxicam. The impairment into glycogen metabolism produced by piroxicam administration suggests liver becomes unable to maintain glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, glycogen depletion might produce an impairment in the metabolism of drugs administered simultaneously with piroxicam, because biotransformation of xenobiotics is a process depending on glycogen storage in the liver cells.", 
    "38": "Amplitude of the L5 segmental reflex responses 20 min. before and after intraperitoneal introduction of obsidan, clopheline and finoptine was recorded in experiments on spinalized and thyroxinized rats which 3 weeks before have endured transection of the sciatic nerve. It is demonstrated that obsidan does not change the amplitude of the monosynaptic reflex responses of the ventral root restored under the effect of thyroxine at the operated side, while clopheline and finoptine mainly reduce it.", 
    "39": "Acute normovolemic hemodilution was induced by progressive replacement of blood by dextran (molecular weight 150,000) in anesthetized artificially ventilated dogs. Experiments were performed on dogs with intact autonomic innervation, dogs with beta-adrenergic blockade, dogs with cholinergic blockade, dogs with bilateral vagotomy, and dogs with combined bilateral vagotomy plus beta-adrenergic blockade. Hemodilution induced an increase in cardiac-output in all the groups. However, in dogs with low control heart rate (dogs with intact autonomic innervation, and dogs with beta-adrenergic blockade), cardiac-output increase was almost wholly due to an increase in heart rate. Whereas, in dogs with high control heart rate (dogs with cholinergic blockade, dogs with bilateral vagotomy, and dogs with combined bilateral vagotomy plus beta-adrenergic blockade), the increase in cardiac-output was almost wholly due to an increase in the stroke-volume. The increase in heart rate in dogs with intact autonomic innervation was not significantly different from the heart rate increase in dogs with beta-adrenergic blockade. In dogs with low control heart rate (beta-receptor blockade), hemodilution induced tachycardia, which was not significantly different from the response induced in intact dogs. This shows that the cardioacceleration was primarily mediated through the efferent vagus nerves, and the efferent sympathetic nerves did not make significant contribution in the reflex.", 
    "40": "Beta-adrenergic signal transduction is primarily responsible for the control of the protein secretions by salivary cells. To examine the relationship between beta-adrenergic signal transduction and beta-adrenergic agonist-stimulated salivary secretion, we simultaneously assessed beta-adrenergic receptor number and pilocarpine-isoproterenol-stimulated salivary flow and secreted proteins in parotid and submandibular glands from 3-, 12- and 24-month-old female NNIA F-344 rats. There were no age-related changes in the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in the parotid gland or in the submandibular gland. In the parotid gland there was a significant increase in saliva flow rate in the oldest age group and no changes in the amount of total proteins secreted over 30 min. However, when normalized to gland weight, flow rate was unchanged and the amount of total secreted proteins decreased with age. In the submandibular gland there were age-related increases in both absolute volume and total secreted protein, but when normalized to gland weight there were no longer changes with age. Changes in flow rate were paralleled by reciprocal changes in protein secretory function such that changes in the salivary protein concentrations for the most part were unchanged with age for both the parotid and the submandibular gland. These parameters were compared to our previous data on adenylate cyclase activity, and collectively, these data suggest that in the submandibular gland salivary secretory function does not correlate with changes in beta-adrenergic receptor density or isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity.", 
    "41": "The presence of slightly increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE), even at levels well below levels detectable by an ordinary dipstick, has been suggested as a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and as a reflection of the degree of overall vascular permeability. The aim of the present investigation was to study the effects of two different antihypertensive drug regimens, an ACE inhibitor and a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on the low UAE rate observed in subjects with uncomplicated, mild to moderate primary hypertension. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 49 patients (mean age 54 y) were randomly assigned in a double blind manner either to further 4 weeks on placebo (P, n = 15), 8 weeks on lisinopril (L, n = 17; 20 mg/40 mg o.d.) or 8 weeks on atenolol (A, n = 17; 50 mg/100 mg o.d.). The 24-h UAE was measured every second week. At entry and after 4 weeks the glomerular filtration rate and the renal plasma flow were measured. Both drugs lowered blood pressure (BP) to a similar extent after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment; the blood pressures were 160/106 (P), 159/104 (L) and 154/103 (A) at entry, and 133/83 (L) and 134/87 (A) at the end of the study after 8 weeks.

    "42": "The molecular basis of tissue-specific and cyclic AMP (cAMP)-inducible gene expression in salivary glands is not well understood. Previously, we cloned a salivary-specific proline-rich protein gene, RP4. To analyze the cis-regulatory element(s) that mediates the regulation of this rat salivary RP4 gene, chimeric pRP4CAT constructs containing up to 1.7 kb of the 5'-flanking region of RP4 fused to a reporter gene were transiently transfected into salivary cells. Deletion studies suggest that a 159 bp (-147/+12) fragment of the RP4 5'-flanking region is sufficient to confer salivary-specific induction by agents that can raise intracellular cAMP concentration. Further delineation of this essential sequence revealed that a segment from -136 to -109 is necessary and sufficient to confer cAMP responsiveness in a salivary-specific manner when linked to a heterologous promoter. However, this 28 bp fragment (-136/-109) does not contain an identical match to the consensus cAMP response element (CRE). DNA mobility shift binding assays establish that a sequence-specific DNA-protein complex is formed between this DNA fragment and nuclear proteins from salivary cells, but not with nuclear proteins from HeLa cells, which contain canonical CRE binding proteins (CREBs). Taken together, these data demonstrate that we have identified a 28 bp cis-regulatory element in the RP4 gene that mediates salivary-specific cAMP-inducible gene expression. We propose that the novel salivary-specific CRE binding protein (SCBP) is a key regulator for salivary cAMP-inducible gene expression.",

    "44": "Attempts to show the distribution of adrenergic receptors (ARs) in autoradiographs of a brainstem motor nucleus following elimination of motor neurons yielded the unexpected result of an increase in beta-AR density. This increase was related to the gliosis accompanying the motor neuron degeneration. To determine the cells on which the AR subtypes were located, we dissociated cells from various regions of the adult rat brain and subsequently identified astrocytes by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunofluorescence. Slides containing the astrocytes were prepared for autoradiography using the nonselective beta ligand 125I-iodocyanopindolol (125ICYP) or the alpha 1 ligand 125IBE 2254 (125I-HEAT). The addition of the selective beta 1 blocker betaxolol or the beta 2 blocker ICI 118.551 to the incubation medium to displace 125ICYP binding was used to determine the binding of beta-AR subtypes. The great majority (greater than 88%) of isolated astrocytes sampled from the trigeminal motor nucleus, cerebral cortex, striatum, and cerebellum showed beta-AR binding. Astrocytes from the first three regions had similar average densities of beta-ARs, whereas the density in cerebellar astrocytes was 2- to 3-fold greater. The beta 2-AR subtype was proportionally greater than the beta 1 subtype in each region. Reactive astrocytes isolated from the trigeminal motor nucleus after degeneration of motor neurons showed a beta-AR density nearly 2-fold greater than resting astrocytes from the same region, with the beta 1 subtype showing the greater proportional increase. There was no beta-AR binding on trigeminal motor neurons. Astrocytes also showed a significant level of alpha 1-AR binding. No differences in alpha 1-AR binding were found in normal astrocytes isolated from the different regions, nor was there an increase in reactive astrocytes. In contrast, trigeminal motor neurons had an alpha 1-AR density nearly 10 times greater than astrocytes. In terms of the NE modulation of synaptic responses in motor neurons, the distribution of ARs would permit NE to act indirectly through alpha 1 and beta receptors on astrocytes and directly through alpha 1 receptors on motor neurons.", 
    "45": "The bradycardia following physical training may be mediated by an alteration in beta-adrenergic receptor number or agonist affinity. We characterized the interaction between age and exercise on myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor number and agonist affinity in 4- and 24-month-old F344 rats to test the hypothesis that the effects of training should be blunted in older rats. beta-adrenergic receptor density was unchanged with age or training. The total number of receptors per heart increased with age due to increased ventricle weight. With training, in the senescent rats the total number of receptors decreased due to a reduced amount of homogenate protein recovered from the ventricle, the significance of which is unknown. The receptor agonist dissociation constant for isoproterenol was determined in both the absence and presence of beta,gamma-imidoguanosine 5'-triphosphate [Gpp(NH)p] and did not change with age or training. Neither training nor age influenced beta-adrenergic receptor characteristics, suggesting that training bradycardia is not mediated by an alteration in beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "46": "Bovine, non-pigmented, ciliary body epithelial cells were isolated and grown in culture to determine whether timolol maleate might affect the activity of their plasma membrane ATPases. The possible effects were tested in drug concentrations in a range of 5 x 10(-19) to 5 x 10(-5) M over an incubation period of 30 min at 37 degrees. Assays of specific activity showed that the drug significantly (p less than .001 for most concentrations) inhibited both Na,K-ATPase and Mg-ATPase. However, the inhibition was partially reversed in concentrations greater than 10(-6) M for Na,K-ATPase and 10(-5) M for Mg-ATPase. The latter enzyme also indicated a second partial reversal in activity at concentrations between 10(-12) and 10(-9) M. These reversals in activity suggest that more than one binding site is involved in the inhibition of both enzymes. Since Na,K-ATPase in non-pigmented, ciliary body cells is responsible for the generation of aqueous fluid and the intraocular pressure (IOP), this inhibition demonstrates a possible mechanism for the pharmacological action of timolol maleate in lowering IOP.", 
    "47": "1. Cross tolerance between the potassium (K+) channel opener, cromakalim and the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, salbutamol, was investigated in the uterus of the non-pregnant rat in vivo. Uterine sensitivity to salbutamol was similar in both vehicle-treated and cromakalim-tolerant rats. In salbutamol-tolerant rats, uterine responses to cromakalim were markedly decreased compared with saline-infused rats, such that maximum inhibition of uterine contractions was less than 40%. 2. Propranolol treatment and salbutamol tolerance each produced similar reductions in sensitivity of the uterus to salbutamol of approximately 10 fold. The same dose of propranolol did not influence uterine sensitivity to cromakalim, which suggests that the relaxant action of cromakalim is not due to a direct or indirect activation of uterine beta 2-adrenoceptors. 3. Salbutamol produced a marked (11.7 fold) increase in uterine adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) concentrations measured ex vivo, which was completely inhibited by propranolol pretreatment, but was unaffected by glibenclamide pretreatment. Cromakalim did not increase uterine cyclic AMP concentrations, suggesting that stimulation of adenylate cyclase is not significant in the uterine relaxant action of cromakalim. 4. The lack of propranolol antagonism of cromakalim and of cromakalim-induced changes in uterine cyclic AMP concentrations suggests that the cross tolerance observed between salbutamol and cromakalim may be at the level of K(+)-channels.",

Pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (5 mg/kg i.p.) prevented the erythrocyte GSH increase but not the decrease of Bmax value.

    "49": "Carvedilol is a beta-blocker with additional vasodilating activity. This study was performed in order to determine whether the vasodilator action of orally administered carvedilol in man is based upon an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism exclusively or if evidence for an additional mechanism could be confirmed. The influence of carvedilol (50 mg p.o.) and prazosin (2 mg p.o.) upon the vasoconstrictor effect of noradrenaline and prostaglandin F2 alpha, infused into superficial hand veins, was established in 8 healthy male volunteers. Increasing dosages of the vasoconstrictors below their threshold of systemic activity were employed in order to obtain dose-response curves of the hand veins congested at a venous occlusion pressure of 40 mmHg. These dose-response curves were repeated 1 and 3.5 h after oral administration of either carvedilol, prazosin, or placebo. The ex vivo, in vitro alpha 1-receptor occupancy in plasma was measured before and after each vasoconstrictor dose-response curve, using an alpha 1-radioreceptor binding assay. Washout periods of 48 h were kept between study days, investigating the influence of one orally administered drug upon one of the local vasoconstrictor dose-response curves at a time. In the alpha 1-radioreceptor assay, plasma concentrations from 0.9- to 1.7-fold the equilibrium dissociation constant (Ki) of carvedilol could be evaluated 1 as well as 3.5 h after medication, corresponding with a receptor occupancy of 44%-63%. After prazosin, 9-13 times the Ki values were determined, which amounts to an alpha 1-adrenoceptor occupation of about 90%-93%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "The effects of DPI 201-106 (a novel, cyclic AMP-independent positive inotropic agent with Ca(2+)-sensitizing and Na(+)-channel agonistic mechanisms) on myocardial mechanics and energetics were assessed in the excised cross-circulated dog left ventricle. In the first protocol, the relation between left ventricular oxygen consumption (VO2) and systolic pressure-volume area (PVA) was analyzed before and during administration of DPI 201-106. The reciprocal of the slope of the VO2-PVA relation has been shown to reflect the contractile efficiency, and the VO2-intercept consists of the oxygen cost of contractility-dependent excitation-contraction coupling and basal metabolism. DPI 201-106 increased Emax (contractility index) and elevated the VO2-PVA relation in a parallel manner, i.e., the VO2-intercept increased without a change in the slope. In the second protocol, the increase in the VO2-intercept of the VO2-PVA relation for a unit increase in Emax (i.e., oxygen cost of enhanced contractility) was compared between DPI 201-106 and epinephrine in a paired manner in each heart. Epinephrine significantly abbreviated the time to end systole, whereas DPI 201-106 did not, suggesting that the mechanism of inotropic action differed between the two drugs. However, the oxygen cost of enhanced contractility was the same between the two drugs in each heart. Therefore, DPI 201-106 did not alter the contractile efficiency nor spare the oxygen cost of enhanced contractility as compared to epinephrine under the present experimental conditions. This suggests that the Ca(2+)-sensitizing effect of DPI 201-106, if any, is too small to spare the oxygen cost of contractility in the blood-perfused, non-failing dog heart.", 
    "51": "In previous studies we have identified and isolated a prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor from cardiac sarcolemmal (SL) membranes. Binding of PGE2 to this receptor in permeabilized SL vesicles inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity. The purpose of this study was to determine if the cardiac PGE2 receptor is coupled to adenylyl cyclase via a pertussis toxin sensitive guanine nucleotide binding inhibitory (Gi) protein. Incubation of permeabilized SL vesicles in the presence of 100 microM 5'-guanylamidiophosphate, Gpp(NH)p, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP, resulted in a shift in [3H]PGE2 binding from two sites, one of high affinity (KD = 0.018 +/- 0.003 nM) comprising 7.7% of the total available binding sites and one of lower affinity (KD = 1.9 +/- 0.7 nM) to one site of intermediate affinity (KD = 0.52 +/- 0.01 nM) without a significant change in the total number of PGE2 binding sites. A shift from two binding sites to one binding site in the presence of Gpp(NH)p was also observed for [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to permeabilized cardiac SL. When permeabilized SL vesicles were pretreated with activated pertussis toxin, ADP-ribosylation of a 40- to 41-kDa protein corresponding to Gi was observed. ADP-ribosylation of SL resulted in a shift in [3H]PGE2 binding to one site of intermediate affinity without significantly changing the number of binding sites. In alamethicin permeabilized SL vesicles, 1 nM PGE2 significantly decreased (30%) adenylyl cyclase activity. Pretreatment with activated pertussis toxin overcame the inhibitory effects of PGE2. These results demonstrate that the cardiac PGE2 receptor is coupled to adenylyl cyclase via a pertussis toxin sensitive Gi protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "At pharmaco-electroencephalographic examination of patients with neuroses narrow-band components was carried out of the EEG spectrum, which oppositively changed under the influence of sidnocarb and obsidan--agonist and antagonist of noradrenergic system, the initial hypothesis on the perspectivity of search of the EEG markers of the level of activation of the brain neurotransmitter systems thus being confirmed. Comparison of the obtained EEG-data with pharmacological properties of the applied drugs allows to project the aspects of further EEG studies of neurotransmission.", 
    "53": "Rats were treated for 15 days with reserpine or vehicle. One day after the last treatment, animals were killed and frozen brain sections were prepared for in vitro autoradiography. Binding to beta-adrenergic receptors was measured with [125I]iodocyanopindolol, and binding selective for beta 1 and beta 2 subtypes was assessed by including non-radioactive drugs that selectively mask beta receptor subtypes. Total alpha 1-adrenergic receptor binding was measured with [3H]prazosin, while alpha 1a binding was measured with [3H]WB4101 (in the presence of unlabeled serotonin). Quantitative densitometric analysis revealed that chronic reserpine treatment caused an increase in beta binding throughout the brain, including the cortex, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, caudate-putamen and hypothalamus. This effect of reserpine was entirely confined to the beta 1 subtype in all regions examined. [3H]Prazosin binding (alpha 1a plus alpha 1b) was also increased after chronic reserpine in several regions of the cortex and thalamus, as well as the ventral hippocampus and caudal amygdala. No effect of chronic reserpine was seen on [3H]WB4101 binding, indicating that the effect of reserpine on alpha 1 receptors is limited to the alpha 1b subtype. The increase in alpha 1b binding after reserpine administration in rats was generally smaller and less widespread than that seen with beta 1 binding. Thus the effect of reserpine upon noradrenergic neurotransmission demonstrates a high degree of receptor specificity and regional selectivity.", 
    "54": "The implication of beta-adrenoreceptor-mediated noradrenalin action on the reactive morphodynamic response of light pinealocytes (LP) to an injection act, conceived as a short-lasting stress attack, is reported. An injection act, realized by saline-injection, was manifested in the occurrence of clustered \"dusk\" and \"bright\" cells--the representative forms of functionally activated LP. The time-related incidence of these cells entities--the appearance of \"dusk\" and \"bright\" cells at 5 min, transitory domination of \"bright\" cells and the nadir of \"dusk\" cells at 20 min, sporadic recognition of \"bright\" cells, lack of \"dusk\" cells at 45 min and the absence of both cell forms at 180 min--displayed that LP-reactive response promptly appeared and rapidly ceased. The injection of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, propranolol, did not considerably alter the pattern of LP-reactive response proper for saline-injected rats at 5 min. The constant presence of \"dusk\" and \"bright\" cells, structurally changed in all the following time periods under investigation, showed that this drug disordered the course of LP-reactive response to an injection act. On the contrary, LP of resting state was not found to be affected. Estimating functionally, the present results indicate that beta-adrenoreceptor-mediated noradrenalin action is required to promote, maintain and accomplish the LP-reactive response to a short-lasting stress inducement.", 
    "55": "It was shown on isolated myocardium preparations that internal gamma irradiation of rats with 137Cs (1.6 MBq/kg) decreased the contractile function of ventricles and had no essential effect on the auricle contractility. The inotropic response of myocardium to activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors decreased, and of beta-adrenergic receptors decreased.", 
    "56": "The role of the sympathetic nervous system in the regulation of large coronary artery tone has been well defined. Studies of adrenergic regulation of coronary-resistance vessels have largely been limited to indirect inferences based on flow measurement obtained in vivo. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of norepinephrine (NE) on the coronary microcirculation using direct in vitro approaches. Porcine coronary microvessels (80-200 microns in diameter) were pressurized in isolated organ chambers. Diameters were measured using a Halpern microvessel imaging apparatus. After preconstriction with leukotriene D4, NE caused complete relaxation. Relaxations to NE were inhibited by propranolol. Relaxations to NE were also inhibited by LY83583 (which depletes cGMP) and hemoglobin (which binds endothelium-derived relaxing factor, EDRF). NE caused minimal or no constriction in both preconstricted and nonpreconstricted microvessels even in the presence of hemoglobin and propranolol. In conclusion, NE predominantly dilates porcine coronary microvessels, both by beta-adrenoceptor activation and by stimulating release of EDRF. There is minimal alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated constriction of coronary microvessels.", 
    "57": "Down-regulation of cortical beta-adrenoceptors is observed in laboratory animals following chronic treatment with many clinically effective antidepressant therapies. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding to cortical beta-adrenoceptors was examined in mice treated with the functional NMDA antagonists 1-aminocyclopropane-carboxylic acid (ACPC) and MK-801. ACPC and MK-801 reduced [3H]DHA binding by 19 (P less than 0.05) and 21% (P less than 0.05), respectively, while imipramine produced a 23% (P less than 0.05) reduction. No corresponding changes in the KD of [3H]DHA were observed. These findings are consistent with the observation that functional NMDA antagonists are active in animal models commonly used to evaluate antidepressants and may represent a novel approach to the treatment of depression.", 
    "58": "Chronic beta-adrenoceptor stimulation leads to desensitization of the myocardial adenylyl cyclase signalling pathway which includes beta-adrenoceptor downregulation and upregulation of Gi-protein alpha-subunits. However, these investigations have mainly been done in cellular preparations. In this study we report that isoprenaline infusion in vivo leads to an increase in myocardial Gi alpha and present evidence for functional consequences of this increase. Rats were treated by a 4-day subcutaneous infusion with isoprenaline (2.4 mg/kg.d), propranolol (9.9 mg/kg.d) and triiodothyronine (T3, 0.5 mg/kg.d) for comparison. Isoprenaline treatment increased the pertussis toxin-sensitive amount of Gi alpha by 22 +/- 6% and decreased beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor density from 35 +/- 4 to 23 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein and 24 +/- 4 to 8 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Contraction experiments on electrically driven papillary muscles revealed that the negative inotropic potency of the M-cholinoceptor agonist carbachol in the presence of isoprenaline was increased as compared to control (mean EC50-values: 0.04 mumol/l vs. 0.28 mumol/l). All isoprenaline-induced effects were antagonized by simultaneously administered propranolol. T3 treatment had no influence on the parameters investigated. The results suggest that chronic beta-adrenoceptor stimulation desensitizes myocardial adenylyl cyclase by at least two mechanisms: beta-adrenoceptor downregulation leading to diminished signal transduction in the stimulatory pathway and Gi alpha upregulation leading to sensitization of the inhibitory pathway. Such adaptation might protect the heart from chronic exposure to catecholamines in heart diseases with elevated plasma catecholamine levels.", 
    "59": "Ligand binding to many transmitter receptors is much higher in layer Ia of rat posterior cingulate cortex than it is in other layers, and this is where most axons from the anterior thalamus terminate. The present study explores the possibility that a number of receptors may be expressed on axons from limbic thalamic nuclei that terminate in layer Ia. Unilateral thalamic lesions were placed in rats and, 2 weeks later, five ligand binding protocols, coverslip autoradiography, and single grain counting techniques were used to quantify binding in control and ablated hemispheres. Binding to the following receptor subtypes was analyzed: M2 acetylcholine, 3H-oxotremorine-M, or 3H-AF-DX 116 with 50 nM pirenzepine; serotonin1B, 125I-(-)-cyanopindolol with 30 microM isoproterenol; beta 2-adrenoceptors, 125I-(-)-cyanopindolol with 1 microM serotonin and 10 microM atenolol; mu-opioid, 3H-T[r-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol; neurotensin, 3H-neurotensin. Thalamic lesions reduced binding in two laminar patterns. In one pattern, there was a major reduction in binding in most superficial layers with that in layer Ia ranging from 50 to 70% for binding to M2 muscarinic and serotonin1B receptors. Binding to beta 2-adrenoceptors was also reduced in most superficial layers but to a lesser extent. In the second pattern, reductions were limited to layer I with losses in layer Ia of 20-30% for mu-opioid and neurotensin receptors. In no instance was layer Ia binding completely abolished (i.e., postlesion peaks remained). Since the transmitters for each of the five receptors analyzed in this study are not synthesized by anterior or laterodorsal thalamic neurons, these receptors are heteroreceptors. The greatest postlesion reduction in M2 binding was for AF-DX 116 and so most M2 heteroreceptors are of the \"cardiac\" subtype. Finally, the diverse population of heteroreceptors on limbic thalamic axons provides for presynaptic modulation by a wide range of transmitter systems and suggests that thalamocortical transmission may not be a simple, unmodulated event.", 
    "60": "1. Some non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetic patients show albuminuria without arterial hypertension. In these patients, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce urinary albumin excretion without producing any changes in systemic blood pressure and renal haemodynamics. However, up to now it has not been clear whether these favourable renal effects are specifically related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or not. 2. Twelve type II diabetic outpatients with persistent macroalbuminuria (greater than 300 mg/daily on at least three consecutive occasions), without any other signs of renal disease and whose blood pressure was persistently below 140/90 mmHg, were studied. 3. In a randomized sequence and in a double-blind fashion, after a 2-month run-in period, patients were allocated to receive 5 mg of enalapril or 50 mg of atenolol daily for the next 6 months. At the end of this first period and after 6 months on placebo in a cross-over fashion, active treatment was replicated. Blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion were measured every 2 months, whereas the other variables studied were determined at the end of each period. 4. Kidney function and blood pressure did not change significantly, whereas albuminuria decreased significantly, after both of the drugs. 5. These data suggest that the inhibition of tissue angiotensin formation and the consequent reduction in glomerular permeability, rather than changes in renal and systemic haemodynamics, are the common mechanisms by which both enalapril and atenolol decreased albuminuria in our patients.", 
    "61": "The effects of a beta-agonist (isoproterenol) and beta-antagonists (propranolol and pindolol) on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) and on changes in some chemical mediators were examined in 28 isolated blood-perfused dog lung lobes. Hypoxic challenge (4 min) was repeated twice, and each drug was administered at a bolus dose of 0.2 mg between the hypoxic periods. The first hypoxia increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by 33% or more in all groups. Both isoproterenol and pindolol inhibited the second HPV completely, but propranolol did not influence HPV. During normoxia, isoproterenol and pindolol significantly decreased PVR by 17.5 and 6.7% (P less than 0.01), respectively, but propranolol had no effect on PVR. In the control and propranolol groups, plasma levels of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) significantly decreased during hypoxia, but those of prostaglandin E2, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, and thromboxane B2 did not change. cAMP increased from 17.0 +/- 4.0 to 76.7 +/- 15.6 pmol/ml in the isoproterenol group (P less than 0.01), and prostaglandin E2 increased from 87.0 +/- 13.6 to 1,015.4 +/- 309.7 pg/ml in the pindolol group (P less than 0.05). The results suggest that the mechanism of HPV inhibition is different between isoproterenol and pindolol.", 
    "62": "omega-Conotoxin GVIA, a peptide derived from the marine snail Conus geographus, is an antagonist of the neuronal N type voltage-sensitive calcium channels associated with neurotransmitter release. The present study investigated effects of this peptide on neurally mediated responses in airways isolated from the guinea pig to determine whether airway nerves are modulated by omega-conotoxin-sensitive calcium channels. Electrical field stimulation was used to induce neurally mediated tachykininergic excitatory responses in guinea pig bronchus and cholinergic excitatory and nonadrenergic noncholinergic inhibitory responses in guinea pig trachea. Exogenous agonists were administered to induce contractile (acetylcholine, substance P) or relaxation (sodium nitroprusside) responses. Tissues were incubated with omega-conotoxin (1 microM) or its vehicle (10 mM acetic acid) for 30 min before establishing frequency- or concentration-response relationships to the various stimuli. Frequency-response curves for neurally mediated cholinergic, nonadrenergic nocholinergic inhibitory and tachykininergic responses were shifted to the right by omega-conotoxin to a similar extent (4- to 5-fold). omega-Conotoxin had no effect on contractile responses elicited by exogenous acetylcholine or substance P or on relaxations induced by sodium nitroprusside. These findings indicate that neurotransmission in afferent tachykininergic kininergic nerves and in efferent cholinergic excitatory and nonadrenergic noncholinergic inhibitory nerves in the airways is modulated by a prejunctional omega-conotoxin-sensitive mechanism.", 
    "63": "In ischemic and in inflamed tissues, pH levels down to 5.4 have been measured, and this local acidosis may contribute to pain and hyperalgesia in disease states. To evaluate the role of acid pH in nociception, we have studied identified primary afferents in a rat skin-saphenous nerve preparation in vitro where the receptive fields can be superfused at the highly permeable corium side with controlled solutions. The nerve endings were exposed to CO2-saturated synthetic interstitial fluid (SIF;pH 6.1) and to carbogen-gassed SIF phosphate buffered to different acid pH levels (5 min duration, 10 min intervals). Mechanical thresholds were repeatedly tested in a \"blind\" fashion by von Frey hair stimulation. Low-threshold mechanosensitive A beta- (n = 12) and A delta-fibers (n = 11) were not excited or sensitized by acid pH levels. In 24 of 96 nociceptor type C- and A delta-fibers, irregular low-frequency discharge with poor response characteristics was induced. However, a distinct subpopulation of mechanoheat sensitive, \"polymodal\" C-units (n = 25; 38%) showed stimulus-related responses increasing with proton concentration and encoding the time course of the pH change. Threshold levels were found to range from pH 6.9 to 6.1; mean maximum discharge was at pH 5.2. All such fibers responded to CO2 as well as to phosphate-buffered solution at the same pH 6.1. The CO2 responses, however, displayed significantly shorter latencies and more pronounced dynamic phases. The carboanhydrase blocker acetazolamide markedly delayed and reduced the CO2 responses. Prolonged application of acid pH (30 min) evoked nonadapting activity irrespective of oxygen supply. Many, but certainly not all, fibers sensitive to protons were also driven by capsaicin (10(-6) M, 10(-5) M) and vice versa. Repeated or prolonged treatment with low pH induced a significant and lasting decrease of the mechanical (von Frey) thresholds in almost all C-fibers tested (from 35 to 16 mN, on average), and this occurred whether or not a fiber was excited by protons. The sensitizing effect was more pronounced the higher the initial von Frey thresholds (0.75 rank correlation). This sensitization to mechanical stimulation was in contrast to the combined action of other inflammatory mediators, bradykinin, 5-HT, histamine and prostaglandin E2. In conclusion, we suggest that pH sensitivity of nociceptors may be an important source of pain and hyperalgesia.", 
    "64": "Atypical beta-adrenergic receptors (beta AR), different from beta 1 and beta 2ARs, have been suggested to modulate energy expenditure. We have characterized a gene coding for a third human beta AR, beta 3AR, whose sequence is 402 amino acids long and is 50.7% and 45.5% homologous to that of the human beta 1 and beta 2AR, respectively. The KD of [125I]-iodocyanopindolol for beta 3AR is 10-fold higher than for beta 1 or beta 2AR. The receptor has an apparent molecular weight of 65,000. Agonists for the beta 3AR induce cyclic AMP accumulation. Among 11 beta antagonists tested, only ICI118551 and CGP20712A, previously classified as, respectively, beta 1 and beta 2 selective, inhibit this effect. The beta 1 and beta 2 antagonists pindolol, oxprenolol, and CGP12177 are agonists of the beta 3AR. The potency order of beta agonists at beta 3 sites correlates with that for stimulation of lipolysis in rat fat tissues. Moreover, because beta 3AR mRNA was detected in rodent adipose tissues, liver, and muscle, we propose that the beta 3AR participates to the control by catecholamines of energy expenditure.", 
    "65": "Only antiarrhythmic agents with class I activity prolong QRS duration The most marked QRS prolongation is produced by the IC agents, followed by IA and IB. This is consistent with the kinetics of interaction of each of these three subclasses with the sodium channel. Amiodarone's effect on QRS duration is between that of the IB and IA agents consistent with its tau rec of 1.5 seconds. Moricizine's effects on QRS duration are more marked than would be expected from its tau rec of 2.6 seconds but may be explained by the slow onset of inactivation block. The greatest efficacy in VPC suppression is exhibited by the class IC agents and amiodarone. Although amiodarone and sotalol are included in class III, amiodarone has marked class IB activity and sotalol is a more potent beta-adrenergic blocker. The disparate effects of these two drugs in suppressing VPCs may be explained by the class I action of amiodarone. It is surprising that drugs within each subclass correlate at all in VPC suppression in view of the marked heterogeneity of mechanisms potentially producing VPCs. Antiarrhythmic agents with class III activity seem to be the most effective in patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Except for the class I agents with class III activity, that is, IA agents, all class I agents are effective in only 10% to 15% of patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia. The discordance between sotalol and amiodarone is unexplained. As expected, the most marked prolongation of ventricular tachycardia cycle length occurs with the class IC agents, followed by class IA and IB. At the rapid rates of the ventricular tachycardia, frequency-dependent sodium channel block occurs even with the \"fast IB\" drugs, and ventricular tachycardia cycle length is prolonged.", 
    "66": "Previous studies have shown a strong reduction of catecholamine-induced lipolysis in perirenal white fat cells in aging rabbits. The molecular basis of this observation was explored on scapular and perirenal adipocytes from 45 and 300- to 500-day-old rabbits. ACTH and forskolin were used to define the maximal lipolytic potencies of the adipocytes. beta-Adrenergic responsiveness was explored with isoproterenol and specific agonists of the \"atypical\" beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) (BRL37344 and (+/-)CGP12177); beta 1/beta 2-ARs were identified with [125I]cyanopindolol. alpha 2-adrenergic responses were evaluated with the full alpha 2-agonist, UK14304. The alpha 2 AR number was determined with the alpha 2-antagonist radioligand [3H]RX821002. Whatever the fat deposit, the relative order of lipolytic potency of the beta-agonists was: isoproterenol greater than BRL37344 greater than (+/-)CGP12177. As previously reported for catecholamines, the maximal lipolytic response initiated by isoproternol decreased with aging; the stronger reduction was observed in perirenal adipocytes compared to subscapular adipocytes. The most striking observation concerns the parallel and complete disappearance of the lipolytic responses induced by the atypical beta-agonists (BRL37344 and (+/-)CGP12177) and the preservation of a residual action of isoproterenol (30% of that described in young animals) which was attributed to the stimulation of beta 1/beta 2-ARs. The number of beta 1/beta 2-AR binding sites was practically equivalent whatever the fat deposite and the age of the animals. alpha 2-Adrenergic responsiveness and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor number were increased with aging in the various deposits but the stronger changes were observed in the perirenal adipocytes where epineprine initiated a biphasic effect on lipolysis (antilipolytic and then lipolytic). To conclude, the reduction of catecholamine-induced lipolysis observed in the rabbit fat cells with aging can be explained by changes in the atypical beta-AR/alpha 2-AR balance. First, a loss of responsiveness to the atypical beta-adrenergic agents was observed (it is impossible for the moment to distinguish between the loss of atypical beta-AR binding sites and their putative uncoupling from the adenylate cyclase system) whereas beta 1/beta 2-AR-mediated responses were maintained. Second, an increment of alpha 2-adrenergic responsiveness and of the alpha 2-AR binding sites accompanied aging and fattening. In the absence of, or after a strong reduction of the atypical beta-AR component of the lipolytic response in fat cells of aged rabbits, epinephrine exerts a biphasic effect on lipolysis, demonstrating the changes occurring in the atypical beta-AR/alpha 2-AR balance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "67": "The effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the wall performance of the in situ canine left ventricle (LV) was evaluated based on the LV end-systolic force-diameter (Fes-Des) relation in 10 healthy mongrel dogs. LV diameter was measured with ultrasonic crystals, and LV pressure was measured with a micromanometer. Preload was altered by inferior vena caval (IVC) occlusion. In the control contractility state, the IVC was occluded for 7 sec. Blockade of the cardiac beta-adrenergic nerves was induced with 2 mg/kg propranolol i.v.. Slopes (Ec) and extrapolated diameter intercepts (D(o)) of the LV Fes-Des relation were obtained from end-systolic data of the control contractility state and after the infusion of propranolol. Ec was used as an index for the inotropic state of the myocardium of the LV wall. IVC occlusion during 7 sec under the control contractility state produced little change in the heart rate. Thus, IVC occlusion for 7 sec avoided the major reflex change of autonomic tone. After the infusion of propranolol, the heart rate and Ec both decreased by 24 and 43% of the control value, respectively; whereas, D(o) was not significantly altered. Therefore, it was suspected that the cardiac beta-adrenergic nerve played an important role in maintaining myocardial contractility state of the in situ canine LV wall.", 
    "68": "To evaluate the possible role of the adrenergic mechanism in hyperketonemia in hyperthyroidism and starvation, the plasma concentrations of FFA, acetoacetate (AcAc), and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) were measured in thyrotoxic and starved rats for 96 hours. Thyrotoxemia was induced in rats by a daily subcutaneous thyroxine (100 micrograms/kg/day) injection carried out for 7 days. Some of the thyrotoxic and starved rats were administered subcutaneous phentolamine (2 mg/kg, twice daily) or propranolol (0.1 mg/kg, twice daily). Plasma levels of FFA, AcAc, and BOHB were significantly increased in thyrotoxic and starved rats compared with the control rats. Phentolamine and propranolol administration did not alter plasma levels of FFA, AcAc, and BOHB in thyrotoxic rats. In starved rats, propranolol did not alter plasma levels of FFA, AcAc, and BOHB, however, phentolamine did increase plasma levels of FFA, AcAc, and BOHB. These results indicate that the adrenergic mechanism may not contribute to the hyperketonemia in thyrotoxic rats, but may have a slight inhibitory effect on ketogenesis in starvation probably due to alpha-antilipolytic action.", 
    "69": "We reconstituted functional follicles from isolated cells, after embedding in a collagen matrix. Therefore we could carry out many investigations. We showed that the cells embedded in collagen reorganized into functional follicles secreting thyroglobulin (Tg) visualised in the intra-follicular compartment, and triiodothyronine (T3) after TSH stimulation. We used these reconstituted follicles for testing several drugs, amiodarone, propranolol and some anaesthetic drugs (thiopental, midazolam and ketamine). We observed that all these drugs inhibited partially or totally, according to the dose administered, the follicular production of Tg and T3. We also found that the follicles reconstituted from thyroid Grave's tissues gave an abnormal secretion of Tg and T3. Finally we created in Rennes a human thyroid model that permits the exploration of pathologic tissues and that may be used in pharmacotoxicology.", 
    "70": "In patients with severe left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), but no significant coronary artery disease (CAD), acute lowering of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to less than 85 mm Hg is reported to result in a 26% fall in coronary blood flow and an increase in myocardial oxygen demand; S-T segment and T-wave changes in the ECG are observed when DBP is acutely lowered to the 70s in these patients. In the presence of good resting left ventricular function, acute lowering of DBP to the 60s in well-controlled hypertensives on a beta-blocker, with either CAD or LVH, results in a mean increase of about 20% in ventricular ejection fraction. By contrast, patients with a combination of CAD and LVH experience a mean 6% fall in ejection fraction implying poor left ventricular functional reserve. In low risk populations, which exclude patients with severe ischaemia, diabetics and smokers, the lower the DBP the fewer the number of myocardial infarctions. However, in heterogeneous hypertensive populations which include high risk patients, such as ischaemics and diabetics (e.g. the MRFIT population), there is a strong U- or J-curve relationship between DBP and CAD deaths. Meta-analysis of high quality studies involving heterogeneous populations has shown that the U- or J-point is at 84 mm Hg and probably relates to high risk patients with ischaemia and/or LVH. Recent data from the Framingham group indicate that the patients most at risk are those with a combination of CAD and LVH: these patients showed a marked U-shaped curve with the U- or J-point at about 85-89 mm Hg DBP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "The effects of vasoactive agents propranolol hydrochloride and angiotensin (AT-II) on improving the directed therapy of cancer with the use of conjugate of gastric cancer monoclonal antibody (3H11) and mitomycin C (MMC) were studied. The antibody activity of the conjugate (3H11-HSA-MMC) was retained with the molecular ratio of 1:2:60. In tests with tumor-bearing nude mice, the tumor inhibitory rate of the conjugate alone was found to be 50%, while in conjugate treated mice that also received propranolol or AT-II the tumor inhibitory rate were 79% and 60%, respectively. In tumor-bearing nude mice given 131I-3H11 both propranolol and AT-II increased the tumor uptake of 131I-3H11. These results indicate that these vasoactive agents can change the tissue perfusion ratio via the effect on tumor blood vessels and increase the access of the conjugate to tumor, thereby, enhancing the effectiveness of tumor directed therapy with the use of conjugates.", 
    "72": "For several decades the animal models of Mg-deficiency have been studied with particular attention to the cardiomyopathy that develops due to dietary deficiency. In recent years we have studied the effects of nutrients and drugs with antioxidant properties on the development of the cardiomyopathy. We have found that treatment of the Mg-deficient animals with alpha-tocopherol, a naturally-occurring antioxidant, significantly diminishes the number and size of lesions. In addition, treatment with lipophilic drugs with antioxidant properties (probucol, propranolol) or water-soluble drugs that scavenge hydroxyl radicals (captopril, epicaptopril), also provided significant protection. In view of these findings, we suggest that chronic hypomagnesemia results in a pro-inflammatory condition leading to excessive production of oxygen-derived free radicals. Subsequently, the tissue antioxidant capacity is overwhelmed and oxidative tissue destruction results.", 
    "73": "Forty six patients with stable effort angina were treated with a combination of propranolol, nifedipine, and isosorbide dinitrate which produced a more profound anti-antianginal effect than each of them given alone. The combination also exerted more marked antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic effects. The combined therapy with the three drugs caused a moderate reduction in heart rate and peripheral resistance, but failed to result in clear-cut disturbances in the orthostatic regulation of the circulatory system. There was a more infrequent and less pronounced ST-segment depression, less marked pressor responses and higher heart rate with the combined therapy during exercise; the cardiac index also increased as before therapy. Physical fitness increased to a greater extent than with monotherapy. The combined therapy with three drugs is indicated when monotherapy fails and that with two agents is indicated when patients have concurrent essential hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias.",

By the end of 12-week therapy with propranolol, the agent lost its antiischemic effect in a third of patients, which was accompanied by an increase in the number and severity of silent ischemic episodes.", 
    "75": "Infusion of adrenaline into the upper lumbar subarachnoid space in lightly anesthetized mice produced a significant elevation of the nociceptive threshold as quantitated by tail flick test. The antinociceptive effect of adrenaline was dose-dependent and antagonized equally by pretreatment with either alpha-1 selective antagonist prazosin or alpha-2 selective antagonist yohimbine at a dose of 0.05 microgram/5 microliter/mouse. This antinociceptive effect of adrenaline was also blocked by pretreatment with beta antagonist propranolol or opiate antagonist naloxone at higher doses, i.e., 0.5 microgram and 1.0 microgram/5 microliter/mouse, respectively. These results suggest that the antinociceptive mechanisms of adrenaline at the lumbar spinal level in the mouse seem to be mediated not only through alpha- and beta-adrenergic pathways but also through opiate system.",

The sorption isotherm was nonlinear, and can be expressed in Langmuir form. The lag time and apparent permeability coefficient through intact skin decreased as the concentration of donor compartment increased, and those through stripped skin were not varied. These results indicate that an adsorption process existed when propranolol hydrochloride penetrated through the stratum corneum. Based on the adsorption--diffusion theory, a mathematical formula was developed for expressing the relationship between the concentration of drug and permeability coefficient through the skin quantitatively.",

    "84": "To monitor the tolerance and long-term efficacy of a low-dose fixed combination of 50 mg atenolol and 20 mg nifedipine (slow release formulation) in patients with stable angina pectoris, 157 patients received treatment twice daily in a multi-centre, open-label fashion for periods up to 12 months following a four week run-in period on atenolol 50 mg twice daily. A total of 122 patients completed the study and had data from all treatment visits. In these patients the median number of weekly anginal attacks was halved, compared to the run-in period on atenolol alone following one month's fixed combination treatment, and this benefit was maintained throughout the 12-month study period. In addition, GTN consumption similarly declined on the fixed combination in comparison with the run-in period. Treatment with the fixed combination was not associated with any long-term increase in the frequency of reported side-effects or adverse biochemical changes compared to run-in. The fixed combination of atenolol 50 mg and nifedipine 20 mg reduced anginal frequency and GTN consumption compared to atenolol alone without causing any increase in adverse effects.", 
    "85": "Arterial hypertension is the most frequent cause of a disturbance of coronary microcirculation. Inspite of having normal epicardial coronary arteries, patients with arterial hypertension often have symptoms of angina pectoris and a positive exercise tolerance test. The angina pectoris symptoms in patients with arterial hypertension are due to functional and structural alterations of the coronary microcirculation. Consequently, an antihypertensive therapy should not only aim at lowering blood pressure and reversing myocardial hypertrophy, but also to improve coronary microcirculation in order to avoid the consequences of chronic ischemia on the myocardium. Until now, only experimental studies have indicated that antihypertensive therapy can improve coronary flow reserve. To determine (also under clinical conditions) if coronary flow reserve can be improved, in 30 hypertensive patients maximal coronary blood flow, minimal coronary resistance, and coronary reserve (dipyridamol) were studied before and after a long-term antihypertensive treatment (9-12 months) with an ACE-inhibitor (enalapril 10-20 mg/d), a calcium channel blocker (diltiazem 120-180 mg/d) and a beta 1-selective beta-receptor-blocker (bisoprolol 5-10 mg/d). To assess the chronic effects rather than the acute effects of the antihypertensive pharmacon, coronary microcirculation was studied after intermission of medical therapy for a period of 1 week. Along with a comparable decrease in LV muscle mass, coronary reserve was improved after enalapril by 48%, after diltiazem by 48%, and after bisoprolol by 22%. It is possible that the observed increase in coronary reserve is related to the reversal of structural vascular abnormalities on the level of the coronary microcirculation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "86": "Sezolamide, a potent topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor previously known as MK-417, was studied to determine its ocular hypotensive activity in patients with elevated intraocular pressure while on continuing therapy with topical timolol. This was a three-centre, double-masked, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel study in 36 patients with bilateral primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension on therapy receiving 0.5% timolol twice daily, with a morning intraocular pressure greater than or equal to 22 mmHg in both eyes 2-4 hours following an 8 a.m. dose of timolol. Sezolamide 1.8% or placebo twice daily was added to treatment with timolol on the evening of day 1 and continued for 2 weeks. Twelve-hour diurnal curves were performed before the study on day 1 (timolol alone) and on day 15. Intraocular pressure measurements were also taken on days 2 and 8 at 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. Patients who received timolol and sezolamide showed additional intraocular pressure reductions from day 1 (timolol alone) of 8.0 to 15.5%, which were significant at all times. At hours 1, 2, 4 and 8 the reductions in intraocular pressure observed in the group receiving sezolamide and timolol were significantly greater than those in the group receiving timolol and placebo.", 
    "87": "One of the receptor-mediated events, cyclic nucleotide, i.e. cAMP and cGMP formation induced by bradykinin in guinea pig ileum was investigated in this report. Bradykinin, similar to acetylcholine, produced a rapid rise in the levels of cAMP and cGMP in the ileum. The absolute amount of these cyclic nucleotides induced by the same dosages (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) of bradykinin was greater in cAMP than in cGMP. This increase in cyclic nucleotides was dependent upon the presence of calcium in the medium. Addition of EGTA (0.1 mM) in a calcium free medium resulted in a significant reduction of the levels. The elevation of cAMP and cGMP levels induced by bradykinin in the ileum could not be blocked by either atropine (an anticholinergic agent) or propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocker). Both of these blockers did not alter the basal levels of two cyclic nucleotides. However bradykinin-induced cAMP formation could be completely blocked by either indomethacin (a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor) or dexamethasone (a phospholipase A2 inhibitor), This, however, was not true in the case of bradykinin induced cGMP formation. Additionally, both blockers did not create a significant change in the basal levels of these cyclic nucleotides. Bradykinin induced cAMP formation in the ileum was indicated by observed results to likely occur through an indirect process, i.e. the formation and release of prostaglandin in the cell, whereas bradykinin-induced cGMP formation did not. The elevation of these cyclic nucleotides in the cells was observed to be related to the movement of calcium ion across the cell membrane.", 
    "88": "Coronary heart disease is the most frequent cause of death in Western, industrialized countries. Coronary risk factors are prevalent in such countries and sometimes combine to constitute the so-called syndrome X--hypertension, central obesity, serum lipid and clotting disturbances, and insulin resistance. beta-Blockers, unlike calcium antagonists, have proved highly effective in secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. If present at the time of the myocardial infarction, beta-blockers (unlike calcium antagonists and diuretics) probably decrease mortality 1 month later. Early intervention (within 12 h) of chest pain with intravenous beta-blockers results in a 15% reduction in cardiovascular mortality at 1 week. Later intervention (3-28 days) with oral non-ISA beta-blockers results in a 30% reduction in mortality after 1 year; ISA-containing beta-blockers are probably less effective (less decrease in heart rate). Hydrophilicity/lipophilicity of beta-blockers is unimportant in terms of decreased mortality. Primary prevention of myocardial infarction, unlike stroke, in hypertensive patients has been disappointing, possibly due to treatment-induced biochemical/lipid changes or inappropriate lowering of diastolic blood pressure in high-risk subjects (J-curve effect). beta-Blockers should be first-line therapy for hypertensive patients up to the age of 65 years, particularly men (and nonsmokers) as Q-wave myocardial infarction is significantly decreased by beta-blockers and significantly increased by diuretics. However, in elderly hypertensive subjects, beta-blockers have not significantly decreased myocardial infarction (unlike stroke), whereas diuretics have. The effects of beta-blockers and diuretics on heart size (and thus coronary flow reserve) in the elderly may be important. Thus, beta-blockers should be second-line therapy for the elderly hypertensive individual but first-line if overt ischemia (e.g., angina or recent myocardial infarction) also is present. In patients with angina but normal blood pressure, beta-blockers tend to decrease and calcium antagonists increase cardiovascular events. Thus, beta-blockers are highly effective agents in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction and are moderately effective in primary prevention of myocardial infarction in hypertensive patients (particularly men) under the age of 65 years.", 
    "89": "Treatment with thiazide diuretics causes impaired glucose tolerance, biochemical diabetes, and insulin resistance. The effect of diuretics on glucose tolerance is clearly dose-related. Spironolactone does not impair glucose tolerance, even at high dosage, but differences among other diuretics could be due to comparisons at doses that are not equal. Diuretic-induced changes in glucose metabolism are not conclusively related to altered potassium homeostasis, and impaired glucose tolerance occurs even when relatively low doses of thiazide are combined with potassium-sparing agents. The effects of diuretics on glucose homeostasis are in large part and probably entirely reversible. These disturbances of glucose metabolism have been detected only by detailed biochemical testing, and their clinical relevance is uncertain. In established diabetes, diuretics have a rapid and substantial adverse effect on metabolic control. In nondiabetic subjects, diuretics rarely cause or trigger a serious hyperosmolar nonketotic diabetic syndrome. Otherwise, it is not known whether the metabolic changes cause clinical diabetes or lead to microvascular complications in the long term. Evidence from large outcome trials suggests that biochemical diabetes, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance do not increase the risk of coronary heart disease in treated hypertensive patients. Diuretics should be avoided in patients with diabetes unless their use is essential. Otherwise, a low dose of thiazide remains as excellent choice for first-line antihypertensive therapy. Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, diltiazem, and verapamil appear to have no important effects on glucose homeostasis. There is very limited evidence that selective alpha-antagonists increase insulin sensitivity. The importance of metabolic differences between drug classes will be established only by comparative outcome trials with coronary events as the end point.", 
    "90": "The beneficial effects of beta-blockers on morbidity and mortality in both essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus have been demonstrated in several antihypertensive trial. Recently, negative side effects of beta-blockers on glucose metabolism have been suggested that could limit their wide-spread use. However, on detailed analysis, any side effects of beta 1-selective beta-blockers on glucose metabolism do not appear to be relevant for clinical practice and hence do not restrict the use of these agents as first-line antihypertensive drugs in diabetic and nondiabetic patients.", 
    "91": "Sera of patients with myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy contain stimulatory autoantibodies directed specifically against the beta 1-adrenergic receptor. The binding of the antibodies could be localized to either the first or the second extracellular loop of the beta 1-adrenoceptor. In 73% of the cases investigated the antibodies recognized the second extracellular loop. The agonistic effects of the antibodies were abolished by beta-adrenergic antagonists. Furthermore, the antagonists were able to remove the antibodies from their binding sites.", 
    "92": "Antiarrhythmic treatment with single agents is often ineffective and can be limited by dose-dependent side-effects. Therefore, combinations of antiarrhythmic drugs in smaller and well-tolerated doses are advocated in cases refractory to single antiarrhythmic drugs. Basically, substances belonging to the same electrophysiologic class should not be combined. A combination of beta-adrenoreceptor blockers with class I antiarrhythmic drugs may be effective, mainly in cases in which the arrhythmia is dependent on adrenergic stimulation. As shown in our study, the combination of class III and I B-substances can be useful in some cases, from the electrophysiological and clinical points of view. Among the successful combinations of this type are amiodarone and mexiletine, sotalol and mexiletine, and sotalol and tocainide. In patients refractory to amiodarone alone or to a combination with mexiletine, the combined treatment with amiodarone and class-I-C drugs such as flecainide and encainide prolongs the cycle length of ventricular tachycardia, but does not suppress induction of ventricular tachycardia during programmed stimulation. Combination therapy with amiodarone and encainide is associated with a remarkable incidence of proarrhythmic effects. Nevertheless, a combination of antiarrhythmic drugs improves efficacy of therapy in selected patients. However, a close monitoring is mandatory because of the risk of proarrhythmia.", 
    "93": "Experimental studies have demonstrated that the 3 calcium antagonists nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil have a comparable effect in the prevention of myocardial damage during ischaemia. Secondary prevention trials after acute myocardial infarction, which aimed at improving survival and preventing reinfarction, nevertheless demonstrated pronounced differences between the 3 drugs. Nifedipine had no effect on reinfarction or death. Diltiazem had no overall effect but prevented first reinfarction or cardiac death (cardiac events) in patients without heart failure, and increased cardiac events in patients with heart failure before randomisation. Verapamil prevented first reinfarction or death (major events); the most pronounced effect was found in patients without heart failure before randomisation. Verapamil did not have detrimental effects in patients treated for heart failure before randomisation. Differences between trials and between drugs explaining the different clinical findings are evaluated.", 
    "94": "The effects of calcium antagonists on psychological well-being, cognitive function, activity and physical symptoms in hypertensive patients are reviewed. Effects on these aspects of quality of life appear to differ according to whether a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist such as nifedipine is employed or verapamil, which is a phenylalkylamine derivative. Nifedipine has been associated with a self-assessment of impaired cognitive function in 2 clinical trials. Nifedipine was also associated with more symptomatic complaints than both atenolol and verapamil in different studies. The problems with nifedipine centred on oedema, flushing and palpitations. Verapamil was associated with constipation. Compared with other classes of antihypertensive drugs, the position of calcium antagonists with respect to the maintenance of patients' quality of life is presently unclear. Verapamil has been associated with improved quality of life compared with propranolol (a beta-blocker) and nifedipine. Verapamil appears to have similar effects on quality of life as atenolol and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril. The position of nifedipine remains unclear.", 
    "95": "Calcium antagonists are of particular importance in the treatment of hypertension because they influence the free cytoplasmic calcium concentration and thereby many pressor mechanisms in the smooth muscle cell. A fall in the peripheral resistance is the main hemodynamic effect, and this is more marked with the second-generation calcium antagonists because they are more vasoselective than the first calcium-channel blockers. Particularly important is their lack of effect on lipid and glucose metabolism, as well as the absence of serious side effects. It has not yet been possible to confirm that the antiatherogenic effect found in some animal models also occurs in humans. Calcium antagonists are effective, safe, and well-tolerated antihypertensive agents that can be combined with all other antihypertensives with the exception of the combination of verapamil and a beta-blocker. They are easy to dose for individualized \"stepped\" therapy. They have a particular role in hypertensive patients with cardiac effects secondary to hypertension, coronary artery disease, obstructive bronchial diseases, diabetes, renal disease, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease.", 
    "96": "In isolated feline right ventricular papillary muscles, with intact or damaged (exposure to dry air for 30 s) endocardium, the effects of cholic acid were studied. At 35 degrees C and a [Ca2+] of 1.25 mM, isometric twitches and the maximal unloaded velocity of shortening (Vmax) were registered. Endocardial endothelium (EE) and myocardial ultrastructure were evaluated on scanning and transmission electron microscopy. In muscles with intact EE, low concentrations of cholic acid (3 x 10(-9) to 3 x 10(-7) M) or short incubation (30 min) with 3 x 10(-8) M induced a mild positive inotropic response, manifested as an increased peak isometric twitch tension (TT) and shortened twitch duration, without changes in Vmax. This inotropic response was abolished by damaging the EE. It was also absent after the addition of propranolol to muscles with intact EE. Higher concentrations (3 x 10(-6) to 3 x 10(-4) M) or prolonged incubation at 3 x 10(-8) M caused extensive morphologic damage of the EE, without detectable impairment of subjacent myocardium. This was accompanied by a progressive decrease in the TT and further twitch abbreviation, without changes in Vmax, resembling twitches obtained from muscles with experimentally damaged EE. These observations suggest that cholic acid induces an EE-dependent and beta-receptor-mediated positive inotropic effect, while simultaneously causing damage to EE cells.", 
    "97": "Left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction depends on several mechanisms leading to left ventricular remodeling: (a) infarct size and healing and (b) adaptive changes involving both the dysfunctioning but viable myocardium (hibernating and stunned myocardium) and the nonischemic myocardium. The prognosis after acute myocardial infarction is strongly related to regional and global left ventricular function and the loss of dysfunctioning viable myocardium is a main factor in the worsening in left ventricular function in survivors of the acute phase. Thus, medical strategies should exert their beneficial effect on the \"mechanical instability\" of ventricular myocardium by saving the viable myocardium. beta-Blocker therapy has been shown to be effective in improving the prognosis via anti-ischemic and antiarrhythmic actions. The combination of metoprolol and nisoldipine seems to be able to preserve the contractile function of viable myocardium in the first 6 months after acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "98": "The authors review the role of the gastroduodenal blood flow as a factor ensuring the secretory activity and protective properties of the gastric mucosa. The possibilities of its pharmacoregulation are also reviewed. It has been shown that the decrease of the gastric blood flow in experimental hemorrhagic shock, extravasal celiac artery stenosis, effects of indomethacin, vasopressin, etc. leads to ischemic injuries to the gastric mucosa accompanied by serious morphological and functional disturbances. The pathogenetic aspects of ischemic injuries to the stomach and duodenum are confirmed by the results of clinical examinations of patients with compression celiac artery stenosis and peptic ulcer. It has been noted that in these patients, the tissue blood flow in the mucosa in considerably decreased in the area of ulcerous defect. The lowering of the content of total phospholipids and changes in their composition were also observed both in relapse and after healing. Out of agents that improve peripheral circulation, propranolol, tavegil combined with cimetidine, trimin appeared most potent. These drugs regulate metabolic processes in gastric tissue, normalizing blood flow, reducing the content of histamine, serotonin, lipid peroxidation products, raising the level of total phospholipids and pepsin.", 
    "99": "Nicorandil is a potent coronary vasodilator. To assess its long-term antianginal effect, we designed a randomized, parallel double-blind trial of 6 weeks' duration comparing nicorandil (10 or 20 mg b.i.d.) with propranolol (40 or 80 mg t.i.d.). The study comprised 77 men with stable angina, no maintenance medication at entry, and an exercise test positive for angina and ST-segment depression. The therapy was started with 10 mg nicorandil b.i.d. or 40 mg propranolol t.i.d. After 3 weeks, the dosage could be doubled according to clinical criteria. Four men receiving nicorandil and one receiving propranolol were withdrawn with side effects; in three cases, the data were not complete. Thus, comparative data were obtained in 69 patients; in 51 of these (26 receiving nicorandil and 25 receiving propranolol), the dosage was increased to the higher level. Blood pressure and heart rate were unaltered by nicorandil and lowered by propranolol. The number of anginal attacks decreased relative to baseline on nicorandil and propranolol (p < 0.002), but total exercise duration was not influenced by either drug. The exercise test performed 2 h after either pill ingestion showed a decrease and a delay in occurrence of myocardial ischemia. The test performed 12 h after medication exhibited reduced ischemia, whereas only propranolol resulted in delayed ST-segment depression. The double product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure was affected only slightly by nicorandil and reduced significantly by propranolol (p < 0.001). Thus, nicorandil medication affords similar improvement as propranolol in patients with angina pectoris, but the mode of action appears to be different.", 
    "100": "The well-being of hypertensive patients may be adversely affected by the disease itself, its complications, and other concomitant processes such as anxiety, sedation, and side effects of prescribed drugs. Some recently developed antihypertensive agents have been suggested to be devoid of these deleterious effects on well-being expressed as quality of life. We compared the effect on quality of life of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril to the effect of bisoprolol as a representative of a new class of selective beta 1-adrenoreceptor blocking agents. Fifty-seven patients with mild to moderate hypertension were eligible to enter an 18-week cross-over study, consisting of a single-blind 2-week run-in period and two 8-week double-blind cross-over periods. At the end of the run-in period and the two cross-over periods, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) were assessed, as was quality of life perception by the Inventory of Subjective Health. During bisoprolol treatment, supine BP decreased from 163 +/- 2/102 +/- 1 to 144 +/- 3/86 +/- 1 mm Hg. The antihypertensive effect was at least as good with bisoprolol as with enalapril. Quality of life perception as measured with the Inventory of Subjective Health was comparable for the two drugs. Spontaneously mentioned adverse effects were more frequent (74%) during enalapril than during bisoprolol treatment. At the end of the study, 69% of patients chose to continue antihypertensive treatment with bisoprolol. Our results show that the highly selective beta 1-adrenoreceptor blocking drug bisoprolol is at least as effective as enalapril and has no deleterious effects on well-being.", 
    "101": "Celiprolol (C) is a new selective beta 1-blocker with partial beta 2-agonistic activity. The purpose of this study was to explore its antihypertensive efficacy and its short-term effect on systemic vascular resistances (SVR), cardiac output (CO), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and left ventricular diastolic performance (LVDP). The Doppler technique was used. In an open-label study, 20 hypertensive patients (15 males, 5 females, age range of 29-68 years) with left ventricular hypertrophy detected by echography were daily treated with 400 mg of C in a single dose, for a period of 4 weeks. C reduced significantly the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (158 +/- 12 vs. 142 +/- 11 mm Hg, p < 0.05 and 101 +/- 6 vs. 87 +/- 4 mm Hg, p < 0.001, respectively) with a decrease in heart rate (74 +/- 12 vs. 67 +/- 8 beats/min, p = NS). The SVR decreased significantly (2,050 +/- 22 vs. 1,495 +/- 23 dyn/s/cm5, p < 0.001) with a slight but not significant increase in the CO (4.5 +/- 0.69 vs. 5.11 +/- 0.82 L/min). The LVEF did not decrease significantly (58 +/- 5 vs. 56.9 +/- 6%, p = NS) while the LVDP was modified favorably, significantly reducing the early diastolic deceleration time (EDDT) (199 +/- 61 vs. 132 +/- 80 ms, p < 0.01) and reducing the isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) (167 +/- 16 vs. 117 +/- 23 ms, p < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
