    "0": "In a standardized rat model of portal hypertension, we investigated the effects of propranolol on alcohol-induced gastric mucosal damage. Portal hypertensive rats pretreated with 2 mg propranolol, compared with those receiving saline, had significantly reduced portal pressures (24 +/- 1 vs 32 +/- 1 cm saline), macroscopic mucosal damage (24 +/- 1 vs 39 +/- 4% of mucosa), and histologic deep necrosis (36 +/- 2 vs 61 +/- 4% of mucosal length). Increased dosage of propranolol to 4 mg did not produce any further reduction of portal pressure or mucosal damage. Central venous and systemic arterial pressures were not significantly altered by propranolol. The extent of mucosal damage correlated with levels of portal pressure (P less than 0.01) in portal hypertensive rats. Sham-operated normotensive rats had less macroscopic mucosal damage (26 +/- 4%) than portal hypertensive rats, and propranolol did not affect the extent of ethanol-induced damage or portal pressures in these animals. We conclude: (1) Propranolol is effective in reducing extent of ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage in portal hypertensive rats, but not in sham-operated controls; (2) this effect correlates with reduction of portal pressure; and (3) our study supports the clinical impression that reducing portal pressure may be one approach for the prevention and therapy of gastric mucosal damage in portal hypertension.", 
    "1": "We describe a simple, reproducible liquid-chromatographic method for determination of esmolol (a short-acting beta blocker) and its major metabolite in human urine. Esmolol is extracted from urine at a pH of 8.4 into methylene chloride; the more polar metabolite remains in the aqueous phase. We then measure esmolol with a muBondapak C18 column and measure ultraviolet absorbance at 229 nm; the metabolite is analyzed with a Spherisorb phenyl column, with absorbance measured at 280 nm. The average extraction recoveries of esmolol and the metabolite were 95 and 92%, respectively. Standard curves were linear and reproducible for esmolol from 0.025 to 5 mg/L and for the metabolite from 1 to 250 mg/L. Within-day CVs for both compounds were less than 6%.", 
    "2": "Ten patients with chronic effort angina and coronary artery disease (luminal diameter reduction greater than 75%) were stressed by atrial pacing (140 beats/minutes) before and 15 minutes after intravenous propranolol (mean dose 7.4 mg). Myocardial substrate exchange of oxygen, blood lactate, plasma free fatty acids, citrate, glucose, glutamate, and alanine as well as coronary sinus blood flow were measured. Coronary sinus blood flow, oxygen consumption, and systemic haemodynamics did not change after propranolol. Propranolol did not influence arterial lactate concentration, and it reduced the arterial concentration of free fatty acid by 37% and increased that of glutamate by 21%. During pacing myocardial lactate extraction increased in all 10 patients; in two lactate release was converted to lactate uptake. Propranolol reduced free fatty acid uptake and increased glutamate uptake during pacing. For both substances the changes in aortocoronary sinus differences or in uptake or both correlated positively with the changes in their delivery to the heart from extracardial sources (arterial concentrations/loads). In the unstressed state before pacing, aortocoronary sinus lactate differences correlated inversely with free fatty acid differences and positively with those of glutamate. During pacing the relation between lactate and glutamate differences remained positive while the inverse correlation between lactate and free fatty acid differences was lost. Myocardial citrate release was halved during pacing and recovery. Propranolol did not influence alanine or glucose exchanges. An improved myocardial lactate extraction after propranolol administration may be secondary to decreased free fatty acid uptake or increased glutamate uptake or both. In the unstressed state both mechanisms may be of importance. During pacing induced ischaemia, increased glutamate uptake is more likely than reduced free fatty acid uptake to be the mechanism responsible for the improvement in myocardial lactate extraction. The propranolol mediated alterations in myocardial substrate exchanges may reflect the extracardial effects of the drug.", 
    "3": "The effect of propranolol hydrochloride on the blood perfusion of a mouse sarcoma and other tissues has been studied using 86Rb. The maximum increase in relative tumor perfusion (2x controls) occurred 15 min after an i.v. administration of 10 mg per kg propranolol hydrochloride. To study the effect of this drug on the uptake of 67Ga, it was injected at a concentration of 10 mg/kg 10 min before administering 3 microCi (110 kBq) [67Ga]citrate. Tissue uptakes were measured 4 hr later. The tumor: blood ratio increased from 1.16 +/- 0.17 to 3.41 +/- 2.27 (s.d.) and tumor: liver ratio increased from 2.39 +/- 0.30 to 7.13 +/- 3.52 (s.d.). The results showed that propranolol hydrochloride can improve the relative tumor blood flow and radiopharmaceutical concentration in an animal model. It is hoped that this and other agents will yield similar results in the human situation.", 
    "4": "The relative importance of hypercapnia in the control of coronary circulation was examined in 42 anaesthetised open chest rabbits. Coronary blood flow was determined with 15 micron radioactive microspheres. When mean (SD) Paco2 was increased from 38(10) to 76(16) mm Hg in six rabbits, the hypercapnia caused a 62% increase in coronary blood flow. When a similar degree of metabolic acidosis was induced in 12 rabbits for either 15 or 60 min, no changes in coronary blood flow occurred. No increases in coronary blood flow occurred during hypercapnia with propranolol, 2 mg/kg (n = 12), with or without atrial pacing to maintain heart rate. Similarly, carotid denervation prevented the carbon dioxide induced increase in coronary blood flow in six rabbits. Haemodiluted rabbits (n = 6) with a 40% replacement of blood showed no changes in coronary blood flow with hypercapnia. This was due to the 22% decrease in systolic pressure-time index, despite their intact sympathetic nervous system and reduced Bohr shift. Therefore, although carbon dioxide is a coronary vasodilator, both direct vasodilatation and sympathetic adrenergic activation must be intact in order for coronary blood flow to be increased.", 
    "5": "Using intracardiac electrophysiological techniques the effects of sotalol hydrochloride were studied in the right atrium in eight patients with paroxysmal supraventricular atrial arrhythmias. Atrial action potential duration was recorded from two well separated standard sites via endocardial contact electrodes before and for 30 minutes after intravenous sotalol (1 mg X kg-1). Atrial effective refractory period and vulnerability to atrial arrhythmia initiation were assessed by premature extrastimulation. All patients developed a prolonged action potential duration (mean +6%, p less than 0.01 in high atrial site; +8%, p less than 0.01 in low atrial site), with similar increases in atrial effective refractory period (mean +9%, p less than 0.01). The small regional difference in action potential duration detected between these well separated recording sites was minimally decreased, indicating no tendency towards increased regional inhomogeneity of repolarisation. The relatively refractory zone as denoted by the gap between atrial effective refractory period and action potential duration was slightly reduced, and transient repetitive atrial depolarisations, initially provoked by extrastimuli in two patients, were abolished. The relation between atrial interval and duration, investigated using two modes of paced cycle length modification, showed that a gradual reduction in pacing cycle length was more potent in shortening action potential duration than was isolated premature extrastimulation. Sotalol was significantly more effective in opposing shortening of the action potential duration caused by progressive cycle length reduction than that caused by isolated extrastimulation. The class III antiarrhythmic activity of sotalol, confirmed in the atrium, is dependent on cycle length and mode of cycle length alteration. Under study conditions, there was no tendency to increase atrial vulnerability or regional non-uniformity of repolarisation.", 
    "6": "Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes were studied in 82 adult patients with a mean age of 49 years undergoing microlaryngoscopy. The patients were pretreated with practolol 0.15 mg/kg i.v. 5 min before induction of anaesthesia with thiopental. Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide in oxygen, fentanyl and suxamethonium-infusion. ECG changes occurred in 49% of the patients before anaesthesia and procedure. Pre-existing ECG changes increased or new changes occurred in 39% of the patients during intubation and in 38% during the procedure. The most common preanaesthetic ECG changes were flat or negative T-wave (18%), sinus tachycardia (13%), ischaemic S-T segment depression (8.5%) and intraventricular conduction disturbance (8.5%). ECG changes during intubation were sinus tachycardia (16%), ventricular ectopic beats (12%), supraventricular ectopic beats (10%) and ischaemic S-T segment depression (10%). The most common changes during microlaryngoscopy were supraventricular ectopic beats (16%), T-wave flattening or inversion (15%), ischaemic S-T segment depression (11%) and sinus bradycardia (10%). In all patients ECG changes disappeared without any special treatment. Unlike our earlier identical study without practolol pretreatment, neither sinus tachycardia nor junctional rhythm occurred during microlaryngoscopy in the present study. The results suggest that practolol pretreatment before microlaryngoscopy is especially useful when sinus tachycardia and junctional rhythm should be avoided.", 
    "7": "We studied a 25-year-old man suffering from primary orthostatic hypotension whose blood pressure decreased to 65/45 mm Hg during orthostasis and to 95/70 mm Hg during ergometric exercise (50 and 100 watt), and whose heart rate responses were inadequate. Resting catecholamine levels were within the normal range and did not show any significant increase related to orthostasis or to ergometric exercise. Hypersensitivity was observed to low doses of intravenous noradrenaline and isoproterenol. Specific binding of 3H-Yohimbine to intact platelets revealed a normal number of alpha-2-adrenoreceptors in agreement with the adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation in vitro, which was, however, in contrast to hypersensitivity to noradrenaline. Specific 3H-Dihydroalprenolol binding to intact polymorphonuclear leucocytes revealed an increased beta-2-adrenoreceptor density in agreement with hypersensitivity to Isoproterenol. Prescription of Fludrocortison improved orthostatic hypotension.", 
    "8": "Hypokalaemia commonly occurs in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and may be caused by elevated serum levels of adrenaline, allegedly by beta 2-adrenergic mediated influx of potassium (K) into cells. We investigated the effect on serum K of intravenous acebutolol (a relatively beta 1-selective agent) in 50 patients with AMI. Serum K was measured before and 1 hour after drug administration. The same measurements were made in a comparable control group of 30 patients who did not receive the drug. Mean serum K rose from 3.58 to 3.81 mEq/l (P less than 0.005) in the treated group. No significant change occurred in the control group. The rise in serum K could not be correlated with prior beta-blocker therapy, zone of infarction, prior diuretic therapy, or gender of the patient. We conclude that the administration of intravenous acebutolol after AMI raises serum K, despite the fact that this beta receptor blocking agent is relatively beta 1-selective. Since hypokalaemia is associated with an increased risk of ventricular fibrillation, it should no longer be assumed from acute intervention trials with beta-blockers in AMI which had mortality or arrhythmias as end-points, that beneficial effects were necessarily due to limitation of infarct size or to a direct anti-arrhythmic action of the drugs. Future trials should take the effect on serum K levels into consideration.", 
    "9": "It is known that adrenergic agonists stimulate thermogenesis in the brown fat of the young rabbit but the receptors responsible for mediating the response have not been identified. The infusion of either noradrenaline or isoproterenol (1-2 micrograms . kg-1 X min-1) produced an increase in subcutaneous temperature (0.93 +/- 0.15 and 1.22 +/- 0.10 degrees C, respectively over the interscapular brown fat. At low doses (0.4 microgram . kg-1 X min-1) only isoproterenol was effective. The thermogenic response to isoproterenol was blocked by atenolol, a beta 1-adrenergic antagonist. Neither salbutamol or terbutaline, both beta 2-agonists, produced a temperature increase. Collectively, these data suggest that stimulation of beta 1-adrenoceptor is primarily responsible for the thermogenic activity of brown fat in the rabbit. However, it was found that 53% of the increase in temperature could be blocked by prazosin, an alpha 1-antagonist. Phentolamine was not effective as a blocker. Although a maximal brown fat thermogenic response can be achieved by stimulating the beta-adrenoceptors, the alpha-adrenoceptors appears to play at least an auxiliary role in young rabbit.",

    "11": "The results of a prospective trial to evaluate the use of diazoxide and labetalol given intravenously in the management of severe hypertensive disease in pregnancy are presented. Both drugs had an efficient hypotensive action. The reduction in blood pressure in the labetalol group was better controlled and this may be a factor influencing perinatal outcome. Because of the freedom of maternal and fetal side-effects, labetalol given by intravenous infusion is a more appropriate drug for use in the management of hypertensive crises occurring in pregnancy and labour.", 
    "12": "We discuss current perspectives in ascites, focusing on newer developments of interest to clinicians and stressing the value and limitations of therapeutic paracentesis. Because there is considerable evidence to support both the \"underfilled\" and \"overflow\" hypotheses for the development of ascites, current concepts concentrate on integration of these two theories. In the management of ascites the rate of ascites mobilization is more important than the method by which excess peritoneal fluid is removed; thus salt restriction may not have to be rigid if diuretics are used judiciously. An approach to intractable ascites emphasizes the difference between unresponsive and refractory ascites, but in both situations a conservative philosophy is recommended. Nonhepatic causes of ascites are briefly reviewed since their management may require principles different from those used in cirrhosis.", 
    "13": "The disposition and metabolism of oxprenolol have been investigated in two healthy male volunteers, following a single 160 mg oral dose of racemic 14C-labelled oxprenolol. Absorption was rapid and complete. Peak blood concentrations of total radioactivity were 8.83 and 8.21 nmol X g-1 after 1 and 1.5 h in the two subjects. After 4 days 93.4 and 81.9% of the dose was excreted in urine, and a total of 96.6 and 84.5% found in the excreta. Mean peak blood concentrations of unchanged R(+)- and S(-)- oxprenolol were 0.83 and 0.81 nmol X g-1. Maximal concentrations of the glucuronides of the R(+)- and S(-)- isomers were 1.98 and 3.51 nmol X g-1. The mean half-lives of both oxprenolol enantiomers were 1.8 h, those of their glucuronides were 3.2 h (R(+] and 4.6 h (S(-]. Unchanged oxprenolol and the oxprenolol glucuronides constituted 11.4 and 66.5% of the area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC, 0-24 h) of total radioactivity. The AUC-ratio of R(+) to S(-) was 1.19 for free oxprenolol and 0.36 for the glucuronides. Free metabolites II-X represented together 4.3% of 14C-AUC, and their glucuronides 15.2%. In urine, 1.8 and 1.0% of the total radioactivity was present as unchanged R(+)- and S(-)- oxprenolol, respectively. The glucuronides of the enantiomers accounted for 24.5 and 26.5%. The percentages of free 4- and 5-hydroxy oxprenolol were 0.7 and 2.4% while those of their glucuronides were 12.3 and 7.5%. Metabolites IV-X constituted together 6.2% in free form and 5.3% in conjugated form. In conclusion, the good mass balances in blood and urine has enabled the comprehensive and quantitative description of the metabolic fate of oxprenolol in man. Oxprenolol is extensively metabolized, direct O-glucuronidation being the major metabolic pathway and oxidative reactions minor ones. The disposition of the oxprenolol enantiomers revealed no remarkable stereoselective differences.", 
    "14": "Both a high physiological concentration (13.1 nM) of epinephrine (E) and acute exercise (AEx) have previously been shown to increase 125I-insulin binding in skeletal muscle. To investigate the site and mechanism of the effect of epinephrine on binding and the possible link between epinephrine- and AEx-enhanced insulin binding, we measured insulin binding in three different preparations: 1) crude membranes derived from whole soleus muscle incubated in vitro with 13.1 nM E, 2) crude membranes with E present in the binding assay, and 3) purified plasma membranes with E present. Epinephrine enhanced binding in all three preparations by 169, 144, and 164%, respectively, at low concentrations of insulin but had little effect at high concentrations. Epinephrine, therefore appears to have its effect at the plasma membrane. Propranolol (10 microM), a beta-adrenergic antagonist, blocked E-enhanced insulin binding and when added to crude membranes made from soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscle of AEx rats reversed the increase in binding seen with exercise. This indicates that E-enhanced insulin binding is mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors and that AEx enhances insulin binding via beta-adrenergic receptors. Sodium orthovanadate (3 mM), a phosphotyrosyl-protein phosphatase inhibitor, also inhibited the increase in insulin binding due to E, implying that E may increase insulin binding by activating a phosphotyrosyl-protein phosphatase which decreases the phosphorylation of a plasma membrane protein, presumably the insulin receptor.", 
    "15": "A double-blind multicenter study compared oral acebutolol (n = 182) with hydrochlorothiazide (n = 178) in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 114 mm Hg). Both agents produced significant and comparable reductions in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures of 15.9, 14.9, and 15.3 mm Hg on acebutolol, and 15.2, 13.3, and 11.8 mm Hg on hydrochlorothiazide (p = 0.001). Acebutolol induced a significant reduction in resting heart rate of 9.3 bpm (p = 0.001) from baseline. The mean effective doses of acebutolol and hydrochlorothiazide were 757 and 68 mg, respectively. Significantly fewer patients on acebutolol experienced arrhythmia, anorexia, and flatulence, although an equal number of patients (14) in each group discontinued therapy prematurely due to side effects. More hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients developed abnormalities in the levels of serum glucose, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum potassium, and chloride. No clinically significant trends in laboratory parameters were seen on acebutolol, although a small number of patients (11 on acebutolol and 3 on hydrochlorothiazide) developed asymptomatic positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests of low titer. The data show that acebutolol is as effective as hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of hypertension, is as well tolerated, and produces fewer biochemical abnormalities.", 
    "16": "The value of the addition of beta-blockers to coronary vasodilator therapy in the treatment of patients with unstable angina at rest is controversial. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 4 week trial of propranolol in 81 patients with unstable angina, 39 of whom were assigned to placebo and 42 of whom received propranolol in a dose of at least 160 mg daily. All patients were also treated with coronary vasodilators, including 80 mg nifedipine daily and long-acting nitrates. The incidences of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and requirement for bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty did not differ between the two groups (propranolol = 16; placebo = 18). The propranolol group had a lower cumulative probability of experiencing recurrent resting angina than the placebo group (p = .013), and over the first 4 days of the trial the mean number of clinical episodes of angina (propranolol 0.9 +/- 0.2, placebo 1.8 +/- 0.3, p = .036), duration of angina (propranolol 15.1 +/- 4.3 min, placebo 38.1 +/- 8.4, p = .014), and nitroglycerin requirement (propranolol 1.1 +/- 0.3 tablets, placebo 3.5 +/- 0.8, p = .003) were also fewer. Continuous electrocardiographic recording for ischemic ST segment changes revealed fewer daily ischemic episodes in the propranolol group (2.0 +/- 0.5) than in the placebo group (3.8 +/- 0.7, p = .03), and a shorter duration of ischemia (propranolol 43 +/- 10 min, placebo 104 +/- 28 min, p = .039). Thus propranolol, in patients with unstable angina, in the presence of nitrates and nifedipine is not detrimental and reduces the frequency and duration of symptomatic and silent ischemic episodes.", 
    "17": "A 52-year-old woman with primary biliary cirrhosis who had never had hepatic coma developed it while taking propranolol. The coma receded when the propranolol was stopped and 2 days later gastrointestinal bleeding did not precipitate hepatic coma. This raises the question whether propranolol and other beta blockers lead to hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "18": "Young, healthy, previously inactive men were trained aerobically 40 to 50 min X d-1, 5 d X wk-1 for 15 wk. They were randomly assigned to one of three medication groups: placebo, propranolol (160 mg X d-1), or atenolol (100 mg X d-1). All subjects lost weight and decreased relative body fat as a result of training. Following training, submaximal steady-state heart rates were reduced in all groups. Maximal oxygen uptake and maximal treadmill times were also increased in all groups. The VO2max of the placebo increased 18.4%. While that of the atenolol group increased 19.4%, the propranolol group went up 17.0%. After training the maximal heart rate did not change in the placebo group, while treatment with propranolol and atenolol reduced at 24.6 and 21.9%, respectively. Training caused a significant decrease in the natural killer cell activity in all three groups. The placebo group had 38.8% +/- 3.8 (SD) before and 29.3 +/- 3.2% lysis of target cells by natural killer cells after physical conditioning, which was significantly lower (P less than 0.01). The groups treated with propranolol and atenolol were also similarly decreased. The use of propranolol or atenolol had no additional significant effect on natural killer cell activity. T-cell mitogenesis stimulated with a mitogen significantly increased with conditioning. The groups given atenolol or propranolol tended to increase somewhat more than the placebo group, although this difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant change in the percentage of total lymphocytes isolated due to training or beta-blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "Donor and recipient guinea-pig hearts were perfused in series, the recipient being perfused with regassed donor effluent. Coronary perfusion pressure and force and rate of contraction were measured. Exposure of donor hearts to hypoxia (1.5 min) and to isoprenaline (5 ng) caused the appearance of vasodilator material in recipient hearts, the direct beta-adrenoceptor effects of isoprenaline carried over in the effluent being antagonized in the recipient by propranolol. Cyclo-oxygenase was inhibited by infusion of meclofenamate (60 micrograms X min-1) which consistently abolished the vasodilator responses to arachidonic acid added to the donor. The vasodilator responses of the donor to hypoxia and isoprenaline were unaffected by meclofenamate. The falls in perfusion pressure of the recipient in response to material released by these procedures were also not significantly different before (hypoxia, 11.5 +/- 2.6mm Hg; isoprenaline, 10.3 +/- 1.3mm Hg) and during the infusion (hypoxia, 10.2 +/- 4.1; isoprenaline, 11.0 +/- 1.3mm Hg). The coronary vasodilator responses to hypoxia and isoprenaline and the vasodilator material released by these procedures do not therefore appear to be due to products of arachidonic acid via cyclo-oxygenase pathways. Furthermore, since there was also no potentiation of the responses, there does not appear to be a concomitant release of a prostanoid to inhibit the major vasodilator material. Adenosine, as the likely candidate for this predominant vasodilator mediator, is discussed.", 
    "20": "We have assessed the benefit of separate or combined alpha- and beta-receptor blockade in the treatment of 33 patients suffering from acute (less than 48 hr) myocardial infarction complicated by sustained (greater than 6 hr) systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 150 mm Hg). Eight patients have been treated with metoprolol, 7 with phentolamine and 18 with labetalol. We evaluated the effects of these drugs on hemodynamics and arterial and mixed venous blood gases. The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the pulmonary wedge pressure. The first group had a pressure greater than 15 mm Hg. It included 9 patients treated with labetalol (1.8 mg/min for 1 hr) and 7 others with phentolamine (0.6 mg/min for 1 hr). The wedge pressure in the second group was less than 13 mm Hg. Nine patients in this group had been treated with labetalol (2.1 mg/min for 1 hr) and 8 others with metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg in 15 min). Labetalol normalized the blood pressure in both groups within 1 hr as did phentolamine. Metoprolol did not significantly reduce either the systolic or the diastolic pressures. The high wedge pressures in the first group were reduced by both labetalol and phentolamine. The cardiac index was increased following phentolamine administration while it was reduced by labetalol. In the group with low wedge pressure, labetalol and metoprolol induced a slight but significant reduction in cardiac index but the pulmonary wedge pressures were significantly increased for metoprolol only. The rate-pressure product was very significantly decreased by labetalol and metoprolol but not by phentolamine. The emergency treatment of systemic hypertension occurring in the setting of acute myocardial infarction would thus appear to be best achieved by combined alpha- and beta-blockade rather than with either pure alpha- or pure beta-blockade. Phentolamine, however, would be a good drug in the presence of a reduced cardiac index.", 
    "21": "The effects of long term (4 weeks) treatment with oral metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) and sotalol (160 mg twice daily) on ventricular repolarisation time were compared in a double blind crossover study in 20 patients post-infarction. For QT interval studies transoesophageal atrial pacing was performed at a cycle length of 800 ms. Sotalol prolonged the QT interval by 5-7% compared with metoprolol. The prolongation reflects a change in the repolarisation time because there was no change in the QS interval. Measurements of heart rate at rest and during bicycle exercise indicated that metoprolol and sotalol in the doses selected were equipotent as beta blockers. Transoesophageal atrial pacing is a simple non-invasive method with few and mild side effects that is well suited to drug studies.", 
    "22": "Net fluxes of Ca2+ and acid production were studied in clonal insulin-releasing cells (RINm5F) by using colour indicators and dual-wavelength spectrophotometry. After equilibration with a medium containing 10-20 microM-Ca2+, only minimal amounts of Ca2+ (0.08 mmol/kg of protein) were released from the cells by subsequent additions of the respiratory blocker antimycin A and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. The presence of 20 mM-glucose resulted in an almost 5-fold increase of the acid production and in a stimulated net uptake of Ca2+. The latter process was independent of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration and reached saturation after 20 +/- 1 min, when it corresponded to 1.18 +/- 0.07 mmol of calcium/kg of protein. Whereas the thiol reagent iodoacetamide suppressed the acid production, interference with mitochondrial function by using antimycin A or the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone had the opposite effect. The latter two drugs induced a selective release of Ca2+ from a pool containing 35% of that taken up during glucose exposure. Most of the remaining Ca2+ was liberated by A23187 or iodoacetamide. Carbamoylcholine was also selective in mobilizing glucose-stimulated calcium, but this calcium (17%) appeared to originate from the pool insensitive to mitochondrial poisons. The action of carbamoylcholine was blocked by atropine and did not depend on the presence of extracellular Na+. The opposite effects of glucose and muscarinic-receptor activation on a non-mitochondrial calcium pool are consistent with participation of the endoplasmic reticulum in the glucose-induced sequestration of Ca2+ in pancreatic beta-cells.", 
    "23": "Contractile responses to ouabain in helical strips of dog and monkey coronary arteries were investigated. Ouabain (5 X 10(-8) to 5 X 10(-6) M) caused a dose-related contraction in dog and monkey arteries; the response of monkey coronary arteries was significantly greater. In dog coronary arteries, contractile responses to high concentrations of ouabain were potentiated by treatment with propranolol. In the arteries contracted with ouabain, the addition of phentolamine caused a relaxation. Contractile responses of dog coronary arteries to ouabain were markedly suppressed by exposure to Ca2+-free media or by treatment with verapamil. Reduction of external concentration of K+ or lowering the temperature of bathing media did not selectively influence the ouabain-induced contraction. These results suggest that ouabain-induced contractions of dog coronary arteries are associated mainly with an increase in the Ca2+-influx, which does not result from an inhibition of the Na+, K+-activated ATPase nor from an activation of alpha adrenoceptors by noradrenaline released from adrenergic nerves. Ouabain in high concentrations seems to liberate noradrenaline from adrenergic nerves, which preferentially activates beta adrenoceptors in dog coronary artery.", 
    "24": "This purpose of this investigation was to determine the influence of experimental diabetes (3 months) on the responsiveness of rat isolated atria to alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation by phenylephrine. Diabetes was chemically induced with streptozotocin (65 mg/kg i.v.) in 42- to 43-day-old, nonfasted male Sprague-Dawley derived rats. Chronotropic (right atria) and inotropic (left atria) indices were recorded in response to alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation by phenylephrine. These experiments were performed in the presence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonism (timolol). Isolated right atria from diabetic rats demonstrated a greater increase in heart rate in response to phenylephrine than did corresponding control atria. Left atria were supersensitive (decrease in EC50 values) and hyperresponsive to alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation by phenylephrine when compared with stimulation of control left atria. Diabetic left atria in response to phenylephrine were observed to exchange more radioactive calcium (45Ca2+) than control left atria, whereas both diabetic and control left atria exchanged the same amount of 45Ca2+ during basal contractile conditions. Phenylephrine had no effect on 45Ca2+ efflux from either diabetic or control atria. These results indicate that 3 months of uncontrolled experimental diabetes in the rat produces an enhancement of alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation of isolated atria, and that there is an alteration in Ca2+ mobilization which may contribute to the enhanced receptor activation.", 
    "25": "Adrenergic mechanisms for the pressor actions of blood-borne L-norepinephrine (NE) and fowl angiotensin II (ANG II) were studied in barbiturate-anesthetized adult ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). NE (1.5-6.0 nmol X kg-1) or ANG II (0.4-1.6 nmol X kg-1) injected iv caused dose-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure (Pa) and pulse pressure (Pp) but slowed cardiac frequency (fH); higher doses of ANG II increased Pa, Pp, and fH X beta-Adrenergic blockade by propranolol lowered baseline Pa, completely blocked cardiovascular responses to isoproterenol, augmented the bradycardic effect of NE, and inhibited the stimulation of Pp by ANG II. However, the tachycardiac effect of high-dose ANG II persisted during beta-blockade. alpha-Adrenergic blockade following iv prazosin completely blocked the pressor effect of methoxamine, diminished the pressure response to NE, and decreased Pa sensitivity to ANG II injections. Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade decreased both the sensitivity and the maximal Pa response to ANG II. We conclude that (i) beta-adrenergic mechanisms predominate in the maintenance of resting Pa, (ii) NE increases Pa principally by alpha-adrenergic action while beta-adrenergic stimulation buffers the consequent bradycardia, and (iii) although the positive chronotropic effect of high doses of ANG II probably is not mediated by catecholamines, low doses of ANG II elevate Pa and Pp by alpha- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "26": "After recovery from primary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the eye in rabbits, recurrent shedding of virus in the external eye can be produced by the local application of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-HD) and epinephrine. Surgical sympathectomy did not prevent shedding of HSV with 6-HD/epinephrine so the source of the virus in the outer eye induced by adrenergic stimulation is not just the superior cervical ganglia (SCG). Chemical sympathectomy with 6-HD prior to HSV infection of the cornea led to decreased viral replication in the SCG during acute infection but did not interfere with uptake of the virus and latent or low grade infection of the ganglion. Shedding of virus in the outer eye induced by 6-HD/epinephrine was reduced by treatment with the beta-adrenergic blocker, timolol. These experiments strongly suggest that recurrent HSV shedding in the eye induced by catecholamines is due in part to effects on the peripheral (i.e. post synaptic) cells. While the peripheral neurons are the source of virus, it is possible that not all HSV detected in the external eye is due to release of preformed virus from nerve endings.", 
    "27": "The physiological and pharmacological properties of ciliary muscle isolated from fresh human eyes were investigated. The muscle exhibited no spontaneous activity. Concentration-dependent contractions in response to carbachol were competitively antagonized by atropine (pA2 = 8.95). The muscle, precontracted by carbachol (2.7 X 10(-4)M), responded to the application of isoprenaline by concentration-dependent relaxation blocked by propranolol (3.5 X 10(-9)M to 3.5 X 10(-8)M; pA2 = 9.15). Angiotensin-evoked contractions were antagonized by 8-Ala-angiotensin II (4.5 X 10(-8)M) in a competitive manner, but were not inhibited by phentolamine or propranolol. Contractions generated by electrical stimulation of the muscle (30 ms, 20 Hz, 60 pulses) were antagonized by atropine (10(-7) M) and tetrodotoxin (6.3 X 10(-7) M). Phentolamine and propranolol did not influence these responses. An increase of the external potassium concentration ([K+]o) from 5.4 to 158.8 mM produced a mechanical response, antagonized by atropine, but not influenced by tetrodotoxin, phentolamine or propranolol. The human ciliary muscle appears to carry muscarinic and angiotensin receptors and beta 2-adrenoceptors. The estimate of Katropine for muscarinic receptors mediating carbachol-induced contractions agrees with estimates of Katropine reported for human and rabbit iris.", 
    "28": "The antiarrhythmic efficacy of 17 beta-amino- and 17 beta-amino-16 alpha-hydroxyestratrien-3-ols and 3-acetates (group 1) was compared with the efficacy of corresponding 3-[2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino)propyl] and 3-[2-hydroxy-3-(tert-butylamino)propyl] ethers (group II), substituents which are usually associated with beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity. Group I compounds exerted potent antiarrhythmic activity against both aconitine-induced arrhythmias in mice and ischemia-induced arrhythmias in rats and reduced the maximum following frequency of isolated guinea pig atria. Electrophysiological studies indicated that their mechanism of action is due to an ability to reduce the fast inward sodium current in cardiac cells (class I antiarrhythmic action). Group II compounds were inactive in the aconitine and atrial tests and electrophysiological studies confirmed that they were devoid of class I activity. However, these compounds, like both class I antiarrhythmic and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, were active against ischemia-induced arrhythmias. Group II compounds, unlike group I compounds, exerted nonspecific beta-adrenoceptor blocking actions, which may account for their activity in the rat test. It was concluded that introduction of the 3-substituted ether group did not confer any advantage over the parent 3-ol or 3-acetate compounds.", 
    "29": "In order to assess abnormalities in the adrenergic mechanism in the intestine of Hirschsprung's disease, catecholamine concentrations, alpha-adrenoceptors, and the effect of electrical field stimulation were examined in aganglionic segments of colon or rectum. The aganglionic segment had a higher concentration of norepinephrine, assayed with high performance liquid chromatography with an electrochemical detector, whereas concentrations of epinephrine or dopamine were similar in normal and pathological segments. In four patients with extensive aganglionosis, the norepinephrine concentration in aganglionic colon segments decreased progressively in descending, transverse, and ascending colon. The tissue content of alpha-adrenoceptors and their affinity assayed from the specific binding of [3H]dihydro-alpha-ergocryptine appeared similar in normal and aganglionic segments of the rectosigmoidal colon. Electrical field stimulation of normal rectosigmoidal colon segments caused relaxation at low frequencies and contraction at a very high frequency. Relaxation was not abolished by blocking concentrations of propranolol or phentolamine. In aganglionic segments, the predominant response to electrical field stimulation was contraction, which was inhibited by either atropine or tetrodotoxin. These results indicate that an alpha-adrenergic system and cholinergic innervation apparently exist in aganglionic colon segments and that dysfunction of the colon appears to result from lack of a nonadrenergic inhibitory system.", 
    "30": "The contributions of beta 1-, B2-, and alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the posterior hypothalamus to the increased renal sympathetic nerve activity and decreased urinary sodium excretion resulting from environmental stress (air jet) in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats were examined. Air stress increased mean arterial pressure and renal sympathetic nerve activity (54% from 7.0 +/- 0.7 integrator resets/min), and decreased urinary sodium excretion (44% from 2.7 +/- 0.4 microEq/min per 100 g body weight). After bilateral injection of ICI 118,551 (beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) into the posterior hypothalamus of the same spontaneously hypertensive rats, air stress had no effect on renal sympathetic nerve activity (8% from 4.8 +/- 0.7 integrator resets/min) or urinary sodium excretion (2% from 5.2 +/- 0.8 microEq/min per 100 g body weight), but still increased mean arterial pressure. Bilateral injection of isoproterenolol (beta-adrenoceptor agonist) into the posterior hypothalamus enhanced the renal sympathetic nerve activity and urinary sodium excretion (but not mean arterial pressure) responses to air stress. Air stress had no effect on renal sympathetic nerve activity or urinary sodium excretion when ICI 118,551 was given into the posterior hypothalamus before isoproterenol. Atenolol (beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) had no effect on the renal responses to air stress when given alone or before isoproterenol. Similarly, ICI 118,551 administered into the lateral hypothalamus or lateral cerebral ventricle, or guanabenz (alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist) given into the posterior hypothalamus, had no effects on the renal or mean arterial pressure responses to air stress. Thus, beta 2-adrenoceptors in the posterior hypothalamus mediate the increased renal sympathetic nerve activity and antinatriuresis resulting from environmental stress in conscious spontaneous hypertensive rats.", 
    "31": "The i.v. administration of radiographic contrast media decreases cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production as measured by negative pressure collection from the lateral ventricles of anesthetized dogs. Evidence suggests that adrenergic-mediated adenylate cyclase (AC) activity controls CSF production. AC activity was measured in membrane fractions of bovine and canine choroid plexus and rat heart and lung in the presence of various concentrations of the contrast agent sodium diatrizoate. A concentration-dependent inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated AC activity by the contrast agent was observed in vitro. Specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to membrane fractions of bovine choroid plexus was also inhibited by sodium diatrizoate. An indication that the inhibition of choroidal AC activity by contrast media is significant in vivo was obtained by measuring CSF production in dogs. The inhibition of CSF production by sodium diatrizoate was reduced 50% when the contrast agent was administered during an i.v. infusion of isoproterenol (100 ng/kg/min). These results indicate that the mechanism of decreased CSF production by contrast media may involve inhibition of beta adrenergic-stimulated AC activity.", 
    "32": "The influence of substances modulating the activity of central monaminergic systems on the anticonvulsant effect of propranolol was investigated with the maximal electroshock test in mice. The results demonstrated that especial the noradrenergic system plays an important role in modulating the efficacy of propranolol. Pharmacological stimulation of the noradrenergic system (e. g. with desipramine, pargyline, yohimbine) resulted in an enhanced anticonvulsant effect of propranolol. Compounds that suppress the noradrenergic transmission reduced this action. On the other hand manipulations of serotonergic (with 5,7-DHT, 5-HTP, PCPA) or dopaminergic (with 6-OHDA + desipramine, apomorphine) mechanisms seems to be without marked influence on the protective effect of propranolol in maximal electroshock.", 
    "33": "Variations in night and day blood pressure were evaluated in 11 patients with essential hypertension. The instrument used (Pressurometer II) automatically records blood pressure every 15 minutes for a mean period of 22 hours and ECG tracings continuously. The mean values of arterial pressure and heart rate were significantly higher during day time than at night, revealing a relative \"hypotension\" and \"bradycardia\" during sleep. The cardioselective beta-blocker acebutolol induced a significant fall in diurnal and nocturnal blood pressure, thus uniformly lowering the 24-hour profile.", 
    "34": "Thirty-two consecutive women with pregnancy-induced hypertension of early onset were randomly allocated to treatment with pindolol or methyldopa. There was no difference between the groups in regard to the average time of delivery (36.33 vs. 36.6 weeks) and weight of the newborn (2850 vs. 2870 g). A significant drop in systolic (P less than 0.005) and diastolic (P less than 0.05) blood pressure was observed in the group of patients treated with pindolol as compared with the methyldopa group. In the pindolol group an improvement in renal function was observed as determined by CCT and serum creatinine. There were no side effects from the drugs in the mother or in the newborn.", 
    "35": "The predisposition for the development of hyperlipidemia rests almost equally on genetic and environmental factors and their interplay. Because one of the least understood factors is the duration of exposure to risk, the authors have chosen to review here some of the genetic factors and some of the relatively long-term environmental factors, such as diet and drug therapies, that are known to increase the risk of hyperlipidemia and likely the predisposition to cardiovascular disease.", 
    "36": "Some of the genetic factors and environmental factors such as diet and drug therapies that are known to increase the risk of hyperlipidemia and possibly the predisposition to cardiovascular disease are reviewed. The cholesterol associated with the low-density lipoproteins (LDL), accounting for 60-75% of the plasma levels, is responsible for the powerful and direct relationship which exists between plasma cholesterol and coronary heart disease. Also, the cholesterol that accumulates in atheromatous lesions is derived primarily from plasma LDL. Hyperlipidemia is defined by elevated levels of the plasma levels; the risk for atherosclerosis is associated with the classification types IIa, IIb, III, and possibly IV, a classification system based on phenotypic manifestations of increased lipoprotein fractions. The Lipid Research Clinics Program reports data on plasma lipid and lipoprotein cholesterol distributions of a large-scale screening of white men and women (both with and without sex hormone usage) aged 20-59 years in the US. They found age-related trends for rising triglycerides and cholesterol with differences between the sexes clearly demonstrated. It has been established that normolipemic individuals are not immune to the development of atherosclerosis. The recent focus on the apolipoprotein moieties has revealed a number of normolipemic dyslipoproteinemias associated with tissue lipid infiltration. Multifactorial population studies provide a strong case for the powerful role of the environment, i.e., predominantly dietary intake of total fat, saturated fat, saturated fats, and calories, in hyperlipidemia. According to the Seven Countries Study, populations with higher levels of cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (and increased atherosclerosis) have saturated fat intakes of 10% or more of calories. Migration studies of Japanese populations in Japan and in the US also show the influence of diet. As was shown early on, oral contraceptive (OC) use predisposes to the development of hyperlipidemia. OCs also predispose to other cardiovascular risk factors that, when combined with smoking, bring about a greatly magnified risk for myocardial infarction. Also reviewed in terms of their effect on the lipoprotein profile are antihypertensive therapies, retinoids, and hypolipidemic agents. Regarding genetic predisposition, single-gene mutations in apoproteins, lipoproteins, and some of the enzymes involved in lipoprotein may underlie disorders of hyperlipoproteinemia or hypolipoproteinemia.", 
    "37": "Some active interventions to modify risk factors paradoxically introduce new risk per se, but benefits in extensive populations vastly offset the proportionally small hazards introduced by these maneuvers. However, in daily practice, this potential source of danger can be crucial in a given patient in whom the new potential risk can be greater than the disease that one is trying to prevent or treat. Patients in whom risk factor modification introduces a new risk should be identified before it is decided who, when, and how to treat. The clinical profiles of these patients, with special reference to the negative effects of risk factor intervention on the heart, are discussed in this article.", 
    "38": "Several antihypertensive drugs have an adverse effect on glucose tolerance that may partially or completely negate the beneficial effects of reducing blood pressure as it relates to the incidence of coronary heart disease and its complications. Diuretics (particularly high doses) and beta-blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have the greatest adverse effect on glucose intolerance. Central alpha-agonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and alpha-blockers do not adversely affect glucose and are preferred in diabetic hypertensive patients, selected hypertensive patients at risk for developing glucose intolerance, and probably most other patients with mild essential hypertension as initial and/or monotherapy compared with diuretics and beta-blockers.", 
    "39": "Elevated blood pressure can be lowered safely in the vast majority of patients by selecting the single drug most likely to be efficacious in that patient. Skillful management with full knowledge of drug pharmacology should provide the patient with the maximum opportunity to benefit from normalization of blood pressure while at the same time having little or no impact on quality of life.", 
    "40": "The present paper reports a study of the effect of ibopamine (SB-7505), the 3,4-diisobutyryl ester of N-methyldopamine (epinine), on diuresis and blood pressure in anesthetized rats. The results obtained demonstrate that ibopamine, administered orally at doses of 12.5 to 200 mg/kg, caused a dose-dependent diuresis. The increase in blood pressure was moderate and of short duration. The diuretic effect of ibopamine was antagonized by d-sulpiride, haloperidol, bulbocapnine and phenoxybenzamine, but not by l-sulpiride and l-propranolol. The increase in blood pressure was antagonized by phenoxybenzamine only. The diuretic effect of ibopamine in rats reflects agonist activity at dopamine receptors and, in part, alpha-adrenoceptors and is independent of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "41": "The ergometric effects of different vasodilator drugs in 5 series of 10 patients with stable angina and persistent effort ischaemia despite beta-offckade, were compared two by two in a random, single blind cross-over study under basal conditions on betablocker therapy and at the peak of their action, the second measurement being performed after a 2 to 7 day interval. The principal criteria of assessment were the work required to induce 1 mm ST depression (WST1), and the maximum ST depression (ST max) at comparable work loads. Molsidomine (2 mg), Risordan 20 mg) and Nifedipine (10 mg) significantly improved both parameters (p less than 0.001). Lenitral (7.5 mg), Langoran (40 mg), Trinitrin skin patch (10 mg) did not produce a significant improvement. Corditrine improved WST1 (p less than 0.05) and slow release Trinitrin (2.5 and 5 mg) improved WST1 at 3 hours (p less than 0.05) and ST max at 15 minutes (p less than 0.001) and 3 hours (p less than 0.05). The fall in resting blood pressure was parallel to the ergometric changes. These results suggest that Molsidomine, Nifedipine, Risordan and slow release Trinitrin (2.5 mg) are the most effective vasodilators when used in association with betablockers.", 
    "42": "An observation of angina aggravated in a concomitant manner with the introduction of treatment with beta blockers is reported. The exacerbation of a vasospastic component with this treatment is evoked on clinical, electrical and coronarographic grounds.", 
    "43": "The acute effects of single intravenous or oral doses of indenolol, as compared to that of propranolol and pindolol, on systemic blood pressure and heart rate were investigated in the rat. In reserpinized anaesthetized rats propranolol neither affected diastolic blood pressure nor heart rate and pindolol produced a dose-related tachycardia with moderate hypotensive effect. After indenolol the fall in diastolic blood pressure was concomitant with a very low increase in heart rate. Both effects were prevented by propranolol. In conscious SHRs the acute hypotensive effect of oral indenolol and pindolol was associated with marked bradycardia and moderate tachycardia respectively, while the decrease in heart rate following propranolol was concomitant to a slight increase in blood pressure. The possibility that the acute haemodynamic changes observed in rats after indenolol may be due to intrinsic sympathomimetic activity predominant at beta 2-vascular adrenergic receptor level is discussed.", 
    "44": "On the isolated electrically driven muscle strip of human right atrial appendages the beta-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating the positive inotropic effects of isoprenaline, dobutamine and procaterol were characterized using the beta 1-selective antagonist bisoprolol and the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551. The three agonists induced concentration-dependent increases in force of contraction with an order of potency: procaterol (pD2-value: 8.03) greater than isoprenaline (pD2-value: 7.73) greater than dobutamine (pD2-value: 5.44). In saturating concentrations all three agonists produced the same maximum of developed tension. ICI 118,551 (10(-9)--10(-7) mol/l) and bisoprolol (10(-9)--10(-7) mol/l) were nearly equipotent in antagonizing the positive inotropic effects of isoprenaline and dobutamine. However, the slopes of the Schild-plots for both antagonists against both agonists were significantly less than 1.0 indicating interaction with beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. On the other hand, ICI 118,551 (10(-10)--10(-8) mol/l) was approximately 100 times more potent than bisoprolol (10(-8)--10(-6) mol/l) in antagonizing the positive inotropic effect of the highly selective beta 2-agonist procaterol. In addition, the slopes of the Schild-plots for antagonism of ICI 118,551 and bisoprolol against procaterol were not significantly different from unity indicating interaction with a homogeneous class of beta-adrenoceptors. The pA2-value for ICI 118,551 was 9.49, for bisoprolol it amounted to 6.99.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "Effects of catecholamines microinjected into the paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus on urine outflow in a rat which was loaded with water and anesthetized with ethanol were studied. L-Norepinephrine, L-epinephrine and L-isoproterenol induced potent antidiuresis with similar time courses to each other. The ED50 values for L-norepinephrine, L-epinephrine and L-isoproterenol were approximately 5, 10 and 5 nmol, respectively. The D-isomer of isoproterenol demonstrated no significant antidiuretic activity. The effect of L-norepinephrine was inhibited strongly by premicroinjection of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. The effect of DL-isoproterenol was inhibited strongly by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, but not affected by alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist. Premicroinjection of a muscarinic antagonist, atropine, partially inhibited anti-diuretic effects induced by L-norepinephrine and DL-isoproterenol. Visceral functions other than urine outflow such as mean blood pressure, respiration rate, heart rate and rectal temperature were not significantly altered when the urine outflow decreased down to 20-30% of the control by microinjection of L-norepinephrine and DL-isoproterenol. The results demonstrated that stimulation of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor in the paraventricular nucleus induced potent antidiuretic effects, partial inhibition of which by atropine suggested a possible presynaptic facilitation of the release of ACh by the stimulation of the adrenoceptors.", 
    "46": "The in vitro effect of various selective and non-selective beta-blocking drugs and adrenaline on the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) was studied in suspensions of isolated rat hepatocytes after 90 min of incubation. Compared with the untreated controls propranolol caused a dose-related inhibition of the T4 to T3 conversion in conc of 100, 200 and 400 microM. The other beta-blocking drugs studied, timolol, oxprenolol, atenolol and metoprolol, were without any effect on this in vitro conversion. Propranolol did not interfere with the cellular association of T4 or the degradation of T4 and T3. Adrenaline 200 microM caused a small decrease of T3 in the medium and a corresponding increase in the intracellular content of T3. The inhibitory effect of propranolol 200 microM was not antagonized by equimolar concentrations of adrenaline. Our study suggests that the inhibitory effect of propranolol on the conversion of T4 to T3 in hepatocytes is caused by a direct chemical effect of the drug unrelated to its beta-blocking and membrane stabilizing properties.", 
    "47": "The pharmacodynamic activity of (+/-)-1-[4-(2-isopropoxyethoxymethyl)-phenoxy]-3-isopropylamino-2- propranol- hemifumarate (bisoprolol, EMD 33 512) has been investigated under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Bisoprolol was found to be an effective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, the pA2 values determined against isoprenaline in guinea pig atria and tracheal muscle being 7.45 and 6.41, respectively. Thus, the selectivity ratio of bisoprolol in favour of beta 1-adrenoceptors is 11. Inhibition of the isoprenaline-induced tachycardia in guinea pigs indicated a long duration of action for bisoprolol. The compound was devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity as shown by the lack of effect on heart rate in anaesthetized and reserpine pretreated rats. Studies in rabbits and guinea pigs revealed a local anaesthetic activity of bisoprolol at high concentrations. Bisoprolol protected the hearts of anaesthetized dogs against the sequelae of intermittent coronary occlusions, as judged by the reduction of the ST-segment elevation in the epicardial ECG. Bisoprolol exerted a blood pressure lowering effect in conscious renal hypertensive dogs after oral administration of 30 micrograms/kg. There was no indication of any action on the CNS in monkeys following an oral dose of up to 8 mg/kg.", 
    "48": "The in vitro binding affinity of (+/-)-1-[4-(2-isopropoxyethoxymethyl)-phenoxy]-3-isopropylamino-2- propranol hemifumarate (bisoprolol, EMD 33 512) to beta 1-, beta 2-, alpha 1-, alpha 2-, D1-, D2-, 5-HT2- and muscarinic cholinergic receptors of rat was compared with that of atenolol, betaxolol and propranolol. Bisoprolol showed a high specific binding affinity to beta 1-adrenoceptors (heart) and a low specific binding affinity to beta 2-adrenoceptors (lung). The beta 1-selectivity of bisoprolol (beta 2/beta 1 = 34.7) proved to be higher than that of atenolol (8.7) and betaxolol (12.5). Propranolol (0.59) was non-selective as expected. Bisoprolol and atenolol exhibited no remarkable binding affinity to alpha 1-, alpha 2-, D1-, D2-, 5-HT2- and muscarinic cholinergic receptors at concentrations up to 1 X 10(-4) mol/l. For betaxolol binding affinities for alpha 2-, D2- and 5-HT2-receptors were found with IC50 values ranging between 2 X 10(-5) and 7 X 10(-5) mol/l. For propranolol binding affinities for alpha 1-, alpha 2-, D1-, D2- and 5-HT2-receptors were found with IC50 values ranging between 2 X 10(-6) and 9 X 10(-5) mol/l.", 
    "49": "Celiprolol was evaluated for its antagonist and partial beta agonist effects in rat spontaneously beating right atria and in electrically stimulated left ventricular strips. Celiprolol, like propranolol, produced a parallel concentration-related rightward shift of the isoproterenol (ISO) (beta agonist) concentration-response curve without decreasing the maximum response in rat right atria. The pA2 values for celiprolol and propranolol were 7.02 +/- 0.30 and 8.45 +/- 0.29, respectively. Unlike propranolol, however, celiprolol increased the resting spontaneous rate at concentrations 3 X 10(-7) to 10(-4)M. ISO alone produced a concentration-related increase in heart rate of rat right atria (maximum 149 +/- 15 bpm at 3 X 10(-7)M). Whereas, celiprolol increased atrial rate a maximum of 49 +/- 5 bpm at 10(-6)M. ISO produced a concentration-related increase in the developed tension of rat right ventricular strips (maximum 79 +/- 4% at 10(-6)M. Celiprolol, by contrast, had no effect on developed tension in concentrations up to 10(-3)M. In separate experiments, celiprolol alone increased right atrial rate a maximum of 40 +/- 6 bpm at 10(-5)M. Pretreatment with propranolol (10(-6)M) completely blocked the increase in rate. It is concluded that celiprolol is a potent and competitive beta antagonist and a partial agonist with approximately 33% of the efficacy (comparing maximum stimulating concentrations) and 0.01 the potency of ISO in rat right atria (at ED50 concentrations). Celiprolol, however, unlike ISO, has no inotropic effect in rat ventricular strips suggesting possible differences in their agonist properties.", 
    "50": "The mechanism by which 5-HT produces relaxations of the rat caecum has been examined. Propranolol and cocaine markedly attenuated the relaxations whereas tetrodotoxin had no effect. Higher doses of propranolol and cocaine (greater than 10(-6) M), as well as reserpinization, converted the relaxations into contractions. There was a residual relaxation resistant to propranolol, cocaine and reserpine treatment. High doses of 5-HT (greater than 10(-5) M) were thus thought to relax the rat caecum indirectly, through the release of noradrenaline from the tissue by a tyramine-like action. The relaxations do not seem to be due only to the release of noradrenaline.", 
    "51": "The effect of varying the level of smooth muscle tone induced by carbachol on the Schild analysis of atenolol (beta 1-selective) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2-selective) with salbutamol as agonist, on the guinea-pig tracheal preparation has been examined. When 10(-6) M carbachol was used to induce near-maximal smooth muscle tone, Schild plot slopes for atenolol and ICI 118,551 were less than 1. Slopes of Schild plots for both drugs were equivalent to 1 when 10(-7) M carbachol was used to produce approximately half-maximal smooth muscle tone. Depletion of neuronal noradrenaline by prior treatment with reserpine had no effect on the Schild analysis. Salbutamol produced maximal relaxation and was more potent when tone was induced with 10(-7) M carbachol, but was less effective at 10(-6) M carbachol. Pretreatment with reserpine increased the potency of salbutamol at each concentration of carbachol. The results suggest that either the level of smooth muscle tone or an unknown effect associated with a high level of smooth muscle tone induced by carbachol may contribute to low slope values of Schild plots of selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in the carbachol-contracted guinea-pig trachea. The carbachol-contracted guinea-pig trachea can be used to determine theoretically valid pA2 values for selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists as long as substantially less than a maximal level of smooth muscle tone is induced by carbachol.", 
    "52": "This study was designed to compare the antihypertensive and anti-ischemic effects of the newly developed cardioselective beta-blocking agent, betaxolol, with the non-selective agent, nadolol, both of which have hydrophilic long acting properties, over a period of 48 hours. Additionally, the study was intended to determine whether betaxolol exerts a lesser influence on pulmonary function and whether beta-1- and beta-2-adrenergic blocking agents also induce a decrease in blood glucose levels during standard bicycle ergometry for three to nine minutes, similar to that reported in association with exercise of longer duration and, if so, whether this effect can be circumvented by the use of a selective agent. Ten patients with angiographically documented CAD, stable exercise angina pectoris and reproducible ST-segment depression of at least 1 mm received on day 1, in a single blind fashion, one tablet of placebo, on day 2 and day 7, in a double-blind, randomized and cross-over fashion, 20 mg betaxolol or 80 mg nadolol, respectively. Bicycle ergometry was performed before, four, 24 and 48 hours after drug with fixed work loads, blood glucose determination before and after ergometry four hours after drug and airway resistance and maximal ventilatory capacity studies were carried out five hours after drug administration. As compared with placebo, betaxolol and nadolol led to reductions of ST-segment depression of 65% (p less than 0.01) and 74% (p less than 0.005) at four hours, of 53% (p less than 0.025) and 56% (p less than 0.01) at 24 hours and 41% (p less than 0.05) and 44% (p less than 0.05) at 48 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "The effects of two beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists with different lipophilicities were studied on tremor induced by L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP) in pargyline- and carbidopa-pretreated rats. Tremor was recorded and analysed by an objective method based on accelerometry. Clenbuterol, a lipophilic beta 2-selective agonist, dose-dependently enhanced tremor intensity, whereas the hydrophilic beta 2-agonist terbutaline had no effect. The clenbuterol-induced enhancement of tremor was completely abolished by the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 but unchanged by the beta 1-selective antagonist metoprolol. The results suggest that centrally located beta 2-adrenoceptors can mediate a modulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced tremor in rats.", 
    "54": "Monographs prepared by a drug information pharmacist at a government hospital in Northern Ireland were evaluated by hospital and community physicians. The monographs related drug information to both the primary medical problem (e.g., angina) and secondary problems of individual patients (e.g., renal or hepatic dysfunction). The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of various agents in a drug group were compared. The initial monograph about beta blockers was evaluated by 13 pharmacists in government hospitals. The monograph was then revised and two additional monographs were written on the use of benzodiazepines in anxiety and insomnia and the use of organic nitrates in cardiovascular disease. The three monographs were distributed to 122 hospital physicians and 67 community physicians for evaluation of the information and the manner in which it was presented. Questionnaires were returned by 46% of the hospital physicians and 39% of the community physicians. Almost 50% of the responding prescribers said the monographs gave them new information. The lack of cost information in the monographs was cited as a problem by 25% of respondents. The most frequently suggested topics for additional monographs were antibiotics, analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, bronchodilators, and antidepressants. Physicians considered the monographs a useful source of education about selection of appropriate drug therapy.", 
    "55": "Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare but difficult-to-manage condition. Adequate clinical trials of agents used in its treatment have not been performed. A variety of drugs have been reported to provide benefit in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, including beta-adrenoceptor agonists, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, and vasodilators such as isosorbide dinitrate, diazoxide, hydralazine, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, prostaglandins and calcium antagonists. Calcium antagonists appear to offer the most promise, although treatment failures have occurred with them as well as with all other drugs used in this condition. In the absence of a specific treatment for primary pulmonary hypertension, several of the agents listed above should be tried before accepting therapeutic failure. Invasive investigation is necessary to adequately monitor the acute response to therapy. Whether combination therapy with 2 or more drugs might improve the response to treatment is an area worthy of further research.", 
    "56": "Iodine 125-labeled iodocyanopindolol, a radioactive beta-adrenergic antagonist, bound to particulate preparations of pregnant human myometrium in a manner compatible with binding to the beta-adrenergic receptor. Studies with a specific beta 2-antagonist, IPS 339, indicated that 72% of receptors present were of the beta 2-subtype. Quantitative studies of beta-receptor concentrations in myometrium from women at term indicated no change in receptor concentration during labor. Similarly, there was no difference in beta-receptor concentration in myometrium from women in labor or before labor between 28 and 34 weeks of gestation. Concentrations of the beta-receptor were not different at any stage of gestation assayed. Isoproterenol competition for iodocyanopindolol binding was used to examine efficacy of receptor agonist interactions in myometrium from women at term, in labor, or before labor and from women in preterm labor. There was no difference in high-affinity binding, an index of efficacy, in any of the groups examined.", 
    "57": "The mode of action of clonidine and norepinephrine (NE) has been investigated in the isolated transmurally stimulated guinea-pig ileum preparation using rauwolscine, idazoxan and benextramine as antagonists. Both clonidine and NE produced concentration-dependent inhibition of the cholinergically induced twitch response and were antagonized by rauwolscine and idazoxan, but only clonidine was antagonized in a truly competitive fashion. Benextramine, an irreversible alpha adrenoceptor antagonist, in a concentration of 10(-5) M, inhibited the effect of clonidine completely but only partially antagonized the inhibitory action of NE. The antagonism of NE by rauwolscine and benextramine was most pronounced after reserpine pretreatment and blockade of neuronal and extraneuronal uptake. Under these conditions, the concentration-effect curve to NE remaining after treatment with benextramine showed an IC50 of about 3 X 10(-7) M and an intrinsic activity of 0.6. This curve was resistant to further inhibition by clonidine (10(-5) M), phentolamine (3 X 10(-6) M), rauwolscine (3 X 10(-6) M), prazosin (10(-6) M) and propranolol (1.2 X 10(-5) M). Thus, alpha and beta adrenergic receptors do not appear to be involved. It is postulated that NE-induced inhibition of the guinea-pig ileum twitch response is mediated by two distinct sites: one is the classical alpha-2 adrenoceptor (the site of action of clonidine and the alpha adrenoceptor antagonists) whereas the other is a site seemingly unrelated to the alpha and beta subtypes.", 
    "58": "Calcium channel blockers and beta-receptor blockers improve symptoms of myocardial ischemia by potentially different mechanisms. Accordingly, combination therapy may entail additive benefits. Twenty-four patients with symptomatic stable effort angina despite full beta-blockade were randomized to a double-blind Latin square protocol in which they received propranolol in a dose producing full beta-receptor blockade, diltiazem, 240 mg/day, in divided doses and a combination of propranolol and diltiazem, 240 or 360 mg/day. Treadmill testing (Bruce protocol) was utilized to assess exercise tolerance, radionuclide ventriculography to assess left ventricular function and clinical follow-up to assess adverse effects and overall clinical response. Comparable treadmill exercise times were observed with monotherapy (344 +/- 83 seconds with propranolol and 341 +/- 87 seconds with diltiazem) and the lower dose combination (361 +/- 87 seconds). With propranolol and diltiazem, 360 mg/day, however, there was a significant increase in treadmill time (393 +/- 106 seconds; p less than 0.05). In five patients whose treadmill exercise was limited by angina on all therapies, there was a significant improvement in the time to onset of chest pain with both low dose and high dose combinations (311 +/- 71 seconds, p less than 0.05 and 336 +/- 76 seconds, p less than 0.01, respectively). Improved treadmill performance was supported by the clinical response, while an increase in adverse effects was not observed. Thirteen of 24 patients blindly selected the higher dose diltiazem combination as their optimal therapy. Left ventricular dilation was observed (by radionuclide ventriculography) in response to exercise in each phase of therapy; this was related to stress-induced ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "In the Persantine-Aspirin Reinfarction Study, Part II (PARIS II), 3,128 persons who had recovered from myocardial infarction, suffered from 4 weeks to 4 months previously, were randomized into two groups: dipyridamole (Persantine) plus aspirin (n = 1,563) and placebo (n = 1,565). The average length of follow-up was 23.4 months. Prespecified primary end points were coronary incidence (definite nonfatal myocardial infarction plus death due to recent or acute cardiac event), coronary mortality (death due to recent or acute cardiac event) and total mortality, each at 1 year of patient follow-up and at the end of the study. Coronary incidence in the Persantine plus aspirin group was significantly lower than in the placebo group, both at 1 year (30% reduction) and at the end of the study (24% reduction). The statistically significant differences in coronary incidence, at 1 year and at the end of the study, in favor of the combination treatment remained after adjustment for multiple baseline variables and adjustment for multiple testing (three end points for two time periods). Although there were reductions for other end points, these differences were not statistically significant. Coronary mortality was 20% lower in the Persantine plus aspirin group compared with the placebo group at 1 year, and 6% lower overall. Total mortality in the treated group compared with the placebo group was 11% lower at 1 year and 3% lower overall. The reduced rates of coronary incidence largely reflected lower rates of definite nonfatal myocardial infarction in the Persantine plus aspirin group. Several subgroups were defined a priori and at the end of the study. The beneficial effect of Persantine plus aspirin compared with placebo for coronary incidence tended to be greater for the following groups of patients: those who had a non-Q wave infarct; those who were not taking digitalis; those who were receiving beta-receptor blocking drugs at baseline; those who were in New York Heart Association functional class I; those who had had only one myocardial infarction; or those who were enrolled in the study early, that is within 85 days of the qualifying myocardial infarction.", 
    "60": "Myocardial oxygen consumption is regulated by interrelated mechanical and inotropic conditions; there is a parallel increase in the aerobic metabolism and inotropic state during beta-adrenergic stimulation under fixed mechanical conditions. In contrast, there is some evidence that beta-blockade may reduce oxygen consumption through effects independent of its influence on mechanical conditions and contractile state, and that prolonged beta-blockade may sensitize the myocardium to beta-adrenergic stimulation. To clarify these two points, the present study examined the relationship of myocardial energetics to mechanics and inotropism during acute beta-blockade and after the withdrawal of long-term beta-blockade, whereupon the basis for any effect observed was sought by characterizing the number, affinity, and affinity states of the beta-receptors as well as the coupling of activated beta-receptors to cyclic AMP generation. Studies of right ventricular papillary muscles from control and chronically beta-blocked cats demonstrated contractile and energetic properties as well as dose-response behavior and inotropic specificity suggestive of an increase in myocardial sensitivity to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in the latter group. Assays of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors from further groups of control and pretreated cats, both in cardiac tissue and in isolated cardiac muscle cells, failed to define a difference between the two groups either in terms of receptor number and affinity or in terms of the proportion of receptors in the high-affinity state. However, coupling of the activated beta-adrenoceptors to cyclic AMP generation was enhanced in cardiac muscle cells from chronically beta-blocked cats. These data demonstrate that beta-adrenoceptor blockade (a) produces parallel effects on inotropic state and oxygen consumption without an independent effect on either and (b) increases myocardial sensitivity to beta-adrenergic stimulation after beta-blockade withdrawal, not by \"up-regulation\" of the cardiac beta-adrenoceptors, but instead by more effective coupling of these receptors when activated to cyclic AMP generation.", 
    "61": "Previous studies had suggested that norepinephrine (NE) and its precursors dopamine (DA) and L-DOPA acted similarly on iodine metabolism of isolated thyroid cells. Present studies indicate that this similarity extends to the inhibition by catecholamines of TSH-stimulated T4 release by mouse thyroids incubated in vitro. DA (5 X 10(-4) M), like NE, shown previously, inhibits TSH-stimulated T4 release. This inhibition was reversed by the alpha-blockers phentolamine, prazosin, and yohimbine, but not by the beta-blocker L-propranolol. DU-18288 and diethyldithiocarbamate, inhibitors of DA beta-hydroxylase, did not reduce DA inhibition, suggesting that prior conversion to NE was not a condition for DA activity. Apomorphine, a dopaminergic agonist but not a NE precursor, acted like DA, and its inhibition was also reversed by alpha-blockers. Furthermore, sulpiride, a dopaminergic blocker, reversed DA and apomorphine inhibition of TSH stimulation. These results suggest that DA inhibits TSH-stimulated T4 release through both adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. On the other hand, L-DOPA, exerting an inhibition like that of DA, was also reversed by alpha-blockers, but its activity was greatly diminished by carbidopa, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, the enzyme converting L-DOPA to DA. This indicated that L-DOPA had to be converted to DA for activity. Both DA and L-DOPA inhibited stimulation of T4 release induced by (Bu)2cAMP, suggesting that their effect was exerted at a locus distal to cAMP generation. Indirect confirmation of a cAMP-independent pathway was obtained when DA inhibited TSH-stimulated cAMP formation, but, contrary to T4 release, this inhibition was not reversed by dopaminergic or adrenergic blockers. Presumably, therefore, DA inhibition of TSH-stimulated cAMP production was not related to T4 release. We conclude that 1) DA inhibits TSH-stimulated T4 release in mouse thyroids via alpha-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors; 2) L-DOPA has to be converted to DA to produce inhibition; and 3) cAMP is unlikely to be an intermediary in DA inhibition.", 
    "62": "The day-to-day variations in epicardial defibrillation threshold (DFT) were examined in closed-chest, unanesthetized dogs. In 11 animals, DFT decreased from 15.8 +/- 2.1 J (mean +/- SE) at the beginning of the study (day 1), to 7.4 +/- 1.7 J on day 2 (p less than .0001). DFT measured daily for 5 consecutive days in seven dogs decreased from 22.1 +/- 3.1 J on day 1 to 9.3 +/- 2.3 J on day 2 (p less than .01) and remained stable from day 2 to day 5. Transcardiac impedance, measured in six dogs, decreased from 112 +/- 6 omega on day 1 to 100 +/- 6 omega on day 2 (p = NS). Propranolol given on day 2 in 14 dogs increased DFT from 12.0 +/- 2.2 to 18.0 +/- 3.1 J (p less than .05). The effects on DFT of sequential administration of isoproterenol and propranolol were examined in 10 dogs. Isoproterenol decreased DFT from 10.0 +/- 1.9 to 5.5 +/- 1.5 J when given before propranolol (p less than .001, n = 10), and from 11.7 +/- 3.0 to 9.7 +/- 3.1 J when given after propranolol (p less than .05, n = 9). Propranolol increased DFT from 10.6 +/- 3.0 to 14.6 +/- 3.9 J when given before isoproterenol (p less than .02, n = 9), and from 10.7 +/- 1.4 to 14.4 +/- 1.5 J when given after isoproterenol (p less than .01, n = 10). These experiments demonstrate a sustained cardiac effect of epicardial defibrillation reflected by a decrease in DFT that is partially reversible by propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Under double-blind randomized conditions the effects of early intervention with oral propranolol or a placebo were studied in 51 cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Eleven out of 23 patients randomly assigned to placebo had a poor outcome at 6 months, while 2 of the 28 patients randomly assigned to propranolol had a poor outcome (p less than 0.001). Patients with a poor outcome on the placebo had significantly higher mean plasma total creatine kinase levels (742 IU, standard error of the mean +/- 233 IU) on the fifth day after subarachnoid hemorrhage than patients with a good outcome on the placebo (108 +/- 20 IU; p less than 0.05). A raised plasma creatine kinase myocardial isoenzyme was associated with a particularly poor outlook in patients receiving the placebo, in contrast to those taking a beta-blocker. Clinical outcome and plasma creatine kinase levels in patients taking atenolol (hydrophilic) were similar to those observed in patients receiving propranolol.", 
    "64": "The specific binding of 125I-(-)pindolol to membranes prepared from rat colon displayed high affinity (Kd = 75 +/- 3 pM) and relatively low capacity (Bmax = 48 +/- 3.8 fmol/mg protein). Furthermore, the binding was reversible and possessed properties expected of a beta-adrenoceptor. Thus, for example, the potency of agonists in displacing 125I-(-)pindolol was, in decreasing order, isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine, and the negative isomer of propranolol was two orders of magnitude more potent than the positive isomer. Displacement of specific binding by the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist pafenolol and the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118.551 revealed that the colon preparation possessed a heterogenous beta-adrenoceptor population. Analysis of the inhibition curves using computer-assisted curve fitting suggested that the sites consisted of a small (14%-21%) beta 1-adrenoceptor population and a large (79%-86%) beta 2-adrenoceptor population. The coexistence of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors is discussed in relation to evidence of a functional linkage of both subtypes with colon motility.", 
    "65": "The beta-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibitory response in isolated rat colon strips of beta-adrenoceptor agonists (isoproterenol, terbutaline, prenalterol) in the absence and presence of the selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists metoprolol (beta 1) and IPS 339 (beta 2) demonstrates that both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors are involved in the inhibition of colonic motility. Neuronal blockade induced by tetrodotoxin suppressed the relatively high (68%) maximal response of prenalterol (partial beta-adrenoceptor agonist) to 23%. The concentration-response curves for terbutaline (beta 2-selective agonist) and isoproterenol (nonselective agonist) were not influenced by tetrodotoxin. The results thus indicate that the beta-adrenergic inhibition of spontaneous activity in the rat colon strip may be mediated at two functional levels within the colon wall: either by beta 2-adrenoceptors in the smooth muscle layer or by beta 1-adrenoceptors in the intramural ganglionic plexuses, which by neuronal elements are coupled to the effector smooth muscle.",

Tobanum produced antianginal effect in 82.2% of cases, and was well tolerated. The effect of one 5 mg pill set on later, as compared to anaprilin, and lasted longer (averaging 12 hours).", 
    "67": "Intraarterial injection of the neuropeptide substance P (SP) accelerates mucociliary (MC) activity. The physiological significance of this finding was investigated using capsaicin, which is known to release SP from unmyelinated C-fibers in sensory nerves. Capsaicin (3.0-150.0 micrograms/kg) stimulated MC activity in the rabbit maxillary sinus in vivo, recorded with a photoelectric technique. This effect was resistant to pretreatment with the adrenergic blocker guanethidine, and to a combination of propranolol and phentolamine. Pretreatment with an SP antagonist (D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9)SP totally inhibited the effect of capsaicin. The muscarinic antagonist atropine suppressed the initial phase of the response to capsaicin, whereas the response was uniformly suppressed by the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium. These results suggest that capsaicin activates a reflex, via afferent C-fibers containing SP and efferent parasympathetic cholinergic neurons. The final response of the MC system reflects the local release of both SP and acetylcholine.", 
    "68": "The studies deal with the relationship between antifibrillatory and electrophysiological effects of Chinoin-103 (CH-103) on right ventricular myocardium of cats. In experiments carried out on right ventricles of open-chested cats, CH-103 markedly increased the fibrillation threshold in a dose-dependent manner. In electrophysiological experiments performed on isolated, electrically driven right ventricular papillary muscles of cats, the drug, at the concentrations needed to increase the fibrillation threshold, decreased the maximum rate of rise of action potential (Vmax) without changing the resting membrane potential. The reduction of Vmax was found to be voltage- and use-dependent. Steady state inactivation of Vmax, an index of the fast inward Na current, was shifted to more negative potentials by CH-103. During a train of stimuli applied after a long resting period, the amplitude of Vmax decreased gradually and reached a new steady state within 8-10 action potentials, thus suggesting that CH-103 inhibited the rate of recovery from inactivation of the fast inward Na+ current. It is concluded that the antifibrillatory effect of CH-103 may be due to a use-dependent block of fast inward Na+ current, which can suppress extrasystoles and tachycardias.", 
    "69": "The possible myocardial protective effect of oral propranolol in combination with potassium cardioplegia and hypothermia was investigated in 30 greyhounds, divided into 2 sub-groups, by determining the changes in myocardial ATP and CP levels, ultrastructural changes and the changes in hemodynamics after a 2-hour period of myocardial ischemia. In group 1, in animals with multiple doses of cardioplegia during the 2-hour ischemic period, preoperative treatment with propranolol did not have a significant myocardial protective effect. In group 2, in animals with a single dose of cardioplegia, during the 2-hour ischemic period, propranolol resulted in a trend of improved survival, although the myocardial ATP and CP levels were the same in both sub-groups. In addition, the multiple doses of cardioplegia in group 1 caused increased subcellular edema in the myocardium. This study suggests that oral propranolol treatment may provide additional myocardial protection during ischemic periods when used with potassium cardioplegia and hypothermia. The mechanism of this effect is not established, but could relate to reduced transmembrane calcium influx.", 
    "70": "Oral beta-blockade with atenolol and pindolol was found to increase urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). In addition pindolol and perhaps some of its metabolites but not atenolol do interfere with chemical analysis of 5-HIAA. This may be due to structural similarities.", 
    "71": "The purpose of this study was to determine the interactions between bombesin and substance P at the feline lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Intraluminal pressures were recorded using a fixed, perfused catheter assembly. Myoelectrical activity was recorded using bipolar Ag-AgCl serosal electrodes. Bombesin, i.v., gave a dose-dependent increase in LES pressure and electronically counted spike activity. The threshold dose was 10(-7) g/kg, while the maximal dose, 10(-5) g/kg, increased LES pressure by 65.5 +/- 14.8 mmHg. The neuroantagonist, tetrodotoxin, decreased the LES response to bombesin by 74.1% +/- 7.9% (P less than 0.05), but had no significant effect on the LES response to substance P. The sphincteric response to bombesin was not inhibited by bilateral cervical vagotomy, atropine, propranolol, or phentolamine (P less than 0.10). Bombesin tachyphylaxis abolished the LES response to bombesin but had no effect on the response to substance P. Conversely, substance P tachyphylaxis completely abolished the LES response to bombesin (P less than 0.001). The substance P antagonist [D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9]substance P also significantly inhibited the LES response to bombesin (P less than 0.05). Acidification of the distal esophagus with 2.0 ml of 0.1 N HCl increased LES pressure by 32.5 +/- 5.2 mmHg (P less than 0.02). The LES response to acid was inhibited by bombesin tachyphylaxis (maximal pressure response, 4.7 +/- 2.1 mmHg, P less than 0.01 compared with control acid response). The tachyphylaxis techniques were specific for the peptides giving no effect on the LES responses to phenylephrine, bethanechol, or pentagastrin. We drew the following conclusions: (a) bombesin increased feline LES pressure via nonvagal neural pathways that were insensitive to adrenergic or cholinergic antagonists; (b) bombesin may be involved in the enteric pathways that mediate the feline LES response to distal esophageal acidification; and (c) substance P mediates the effect of bombesin at the LES and is a neurotransmitter in the LES response to acidification.", 
    "72": "In astrocytes, carbachol evoked the turnover of membrane inositol phospholipids prelabelled with [3H]inositol, as revealed by [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation in the presence of 5 mM lithium. This effect was blocked by atropine and by pirenzepine (IC50 2.2 nM and 56 nM, respectively). Carbachol partially attenuated the isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate production in astrocytes by a direct effect on adenylate cyclase, an effect blocked by atropine and pirenzepine. These results suggest that astrocytes express muscarinic receptor subtypes.", 
    "73": "Since agonists and temperature affect receptor affinity, and since these factors may influence the actual determination of receptor affinity, we assessed the in vitro effects of temperature and isoproterenol on the high and low affinity states of beta-adrenergic receptors in rat membrane preparations. There was a temperature-dependent decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor agonist affinity which was further promoted by the presence of isoproterenol. The decrease in receptor agonist affinity was reflected by a decrease in the number of receptors in the high affinity state. These data suggest that receptor desensitization may occur in membrane preparations in vitro and that the present methodology used to assess agonist affinity in vitro may itself alter the very properties being measured.",

Items of investigation were: influence on low range serum potassium, influence on serum magnesium concentration, blood pressure lowering effect, tolerance and side effects. Initial dosage of 1 tablet b.i.d. could be reduced to 1 tablet in the morning in 4 patients. The mean serum potassium concentration rose from 3.79 +/- 0.3 mmol/l to 4.15 +/- 0.55 mmol/l (p less than 0.01) after 4 weeks, and to 4.26 +/- 0.37 mmol/l (p less than 0.001) after 6 months of treatment, all single values remaining within normal limits. The serum magnesium concentration rose to a small, insignificant extent. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were lowered highly significantly from 177 +/- 12/103 +/- 7 mm Hg by 19/11 mm Hg. The mean values were within normal limits (less than 160/95 mm Hg) after treatment. Heart rate fell simultaneously by 11 beats per minute, on average (p less than 0.01). Atrioventricular conduction time was slightly prolonged in 2 cases. Serum levels of sodium, BUN and creatinine rose slightly, but remained within the normal range during treatment. Uric acid and lipids were not influenced significantly. 1 patient complained of transient gastrointestinal discomfort. Generally the drug was tolerated very well.",

Separation of the enantiomers is performed after preparation of diastereomeric derivatives with the chiral reagent R(-)-naphthylethylisocyanate by reversed-phase HPLC. Fluorimetric detection allows the quantification of betaxolol enantiomers down to 0.5 ng/ml. This method was used to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of the betaxolol enantiomers in three subjects following one single oral dose (20 mg) of racemic betaxolol.

The extracts were chromatographed and detected with a spectrofluorophotometer. The quantitative limit of propranolol was 1 ng using 1 ml of plasma or 0.5 ml of plasma water. The present method should be useful for monitoring propranolol concentrations in plasma and plasma water during drug therapy and for pharmacokinetic study of propranolol.", 
    "77": "In control rats most of the ureagenic effect of adrenaline is mediated through alpha1-adrenoceptors with little participation of beta-adrenoceptors. Administration of carbon tetrachloride to rats induces significant changes in the adrenergic responsiveness of their hepatocytes. In rats intoxicated 3-5 days before the experiments were performed there is a marked increase in the beta-adrenergic and a decrease in the alpha-adrenergic responsiveness of the hepatocytes. The alpha1-adrenergic responsiveness increased with time reaching its basal level 15 days after the administration of carbon tetrachloride; simultaneously, the betal-adrenergic responsiveness was decreased. No change in the responsiveness to vasopressin and angiotensin II was observed in intoxicated animals as compared to the controls. In contrast, the responsiveness to glucagon was increased. Increased ability of local anesthetics to decrease urea production was observed in cells from intoxicated animals. It is suggested that changes at the plasma membrane level (lipids, receptors and transducing proteins) might participate in producing these effects.",

    "80": "The effects of N-(3',4'-dimethoxycinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (Tranilast), a blocker for histamine release from mast cells, on rabbit blood platelet functions were investigated. Tranilast inhibited dose dependently both the release of a lysozomal enzyme, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and aggregation of washed rabbit platelets stimulated by thrombin and collagen. The IC50 was suspected to be 164 +/- 50 microM. The data suggest that Tranilast may be used as an anti-platelet agent in addition to an anti-allergic one."
