    "2": "A drug is unsuitable for a patient if it is very likely to cause a predictable adverse reaction, and its prescription, in the absence of extenuating circumstances, would be difficult to defend. A simple example is anaphylaxis to penicillins. It is important to distinguish between patients for whom certain drug therapy is unsuitable, and others who have specific considerations, where the drugs can still be prescribed, but where additional steps need to be undertaken either in prescribing or monitoring. Examples of each of these will be discussed.", 
    "3": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Its treatment is based on the inhibition of proliferation of epidermal cells and interference in the inflammatory process. A new systemic antipsoriasis drug, which consists of dimethylfumarate and ethylhydrogenfumarate in the form of their calcium, magnesium and zinc salts has been introduced in Europe with successful results. In the present study, a homologous series of mono- and diesters of fumaric acid has been studied with respect to the sites and kinetics of presystemic ester degradation using pancreas extract, intestinal perfusate, intestinal homogenate and liver S9 fraction. In addition, intestinal permeability has been determined using isolated intestinal mucosa as well as Caco-2 cell monolayers, in order to obtain estimates of the fraction of the dose absorbed for these compounds. Relationships between the physicochemical properties of the fumaric acid esters and their biological responses were investigated. The uncharged diester dimethylfumarate displayed a high presystemic metabolic lability in all metabolism models. It also showed the highest permeability in the Caco-2 cell model. However, in permeation experiments with intestinal mucosa in Ussing-type chambers, no undegraded DMF was found on the receiver side, indicating complete metabolism in the intestinal tissue. The intestinal permeability of the monoesters methyl hydrogen fumarate, ethyl hydrogen fumarate, n-propylhydrogen fumarate and n-pentyl hydrogen fumarate increased with an increase in their lipophilicity, however, their presystemic metabolism rates likewise increased with increasing ester chain length. It is concluded that for fumarates, an increase in intestinal permeability of the more lipophilic derivatives is counterbalanced by an increase in first-pass extraction.",

Type A was packed with a chiral stationary phase (CSP) containing teicoplanin (TE) mixed with silica microparticles (3:1 w/w) while type B contained only the TE-CSP. In both cases, particles of different sizes (3.5 and 5 microm ID) were employed. A polar-organic mobile phase containing methanol-acetonitrile (60-40% v/v and 0.05% w/v ammonium acetate was used.

Because the negative chronotropic effects of these agents produce a sluggish increase in heart rate (HR) during CPX, exercise capacity is actually underestimated by methods that depend on HR-related variables such as peak oxygen uptake (O(2)) and anaerobic threshold (AT). The aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of beta-blocking agents by means of O(2) kinetics, a parameter independent of HR, in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).",

    "16": "The pharmacological profile of nebivolol may be mediated by its enantiomers and/or its hydroxylated metabolites. Therefore, the cardiac effects of the nebivolol enantiomers as well as of serum specimens containing hydroxylated nebivolol metabolites were studied in human myocardium. For control, the beta1-adrenoceptor selective antagonist metoprolol was used. After pre-stimulation of force of contraction with forskolin (0.3 microM) or isoprenaline (0.01 microM), force developement was decreased only at high concentrations (> or =300 nM) of nebivolol or its enantiomers in isolated trabeculae. Nebivolol and its enantiomers, in contrast to metoprolol (0.4 microM: -72% basal force), produced only minor negative intropic effects in isolated trabeculae under basal conditions. Basal force of contraction was not decreased by in vivo metabolized nebivolol in pharmacological concentrations. Neither D- nor L-nebivolol (30 microM) influenced myofibrillar Ca2+ responsiveness. Nebivolol and the D-enantiomer, but not the L-enantiomer (all 0.5 microM), improved the frequency-dependent force generation. D-Nebivolol, in contrast to L-nebivolol, was a beta1-adrenoceptor selective compound in membrane preparations from non-failing donor hearts. In conclusion, nebivolol and its enantiomers as well as in vivo metabolized nebivolol produce only minor negative inotropic effects. This and the finding that nebivolol and its D-enantiomer improve the frequency-dependent force generation may be of particular advantage when treating patients with already compromised cardiac function.",

(2) Mesenteric arteries precontracted with phenylephrine were relaxed by beta-agonists with the following potencies (pD2): nonselective agonist isoprenaline (6.00)>nonconventional partial agonist cyanopindolol (5.45)>beta2-agonist fenoterol (4.98)>nonconventional partial agonist CGP 12177 (4.19)>beta3-agonist ZD 2079 (3.72). The beta3-agonist CL 316243 1 mm relaxed the vessel only marginally. (3) The concentration-response curves (CRCs) for cyanopindolol, CGP 12177 and ZD 2079 were not affected by the nonselective beta-antagonist propranolol 0.3 microm, the beta2-antagonist ICI 118551 1 microm and by CL 316243 60 microm, but shifted to the right by bupranolol (pA2 5.3-5.7), CGP 20712 (5.4) and SR 59230A (6.5-6.7) (the latter three drugs block atypical and/or beta3-adrenoceptors at high concentrations). (4) The CRC for isoprenaline was shifted to the right by propranolol (pA2 7.0) but, in the presence of propranolol 0.3 microm, not affected by SR 59230A 1 microm. The CRC for fenoterol was shifted to the right by propranolol (pA2 6.9) and ICI 118551 (6.8). (5) Removal of endothelium diminished the vasorelaxant effects of cyanopindolol, CGP 12177 and ZD 2079. (6) Fenoterol and cyanopindolol also relaxed (endothelium-intact) mesenteric arteries precontracted with serotonin. The relaxant effect of cyanopindolol was antagonized by bupranolol to about the same degree as in phenylephrine-contracted vessels. (7) In conclusion, beta2- and atypical beta-adrenoceptors (but not beta3-adrenoceptors) relax the rat mesenteric artery. The atypical beta-adrenoceptor, which is partially located endothelially, may differ from the low-affinity state of the beta1-adrenoceptor.", 
    "23": "Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 72 h was shown to dose-dependently increase nitric oxide production from 6-day-old retinal cultures. Cell death, as determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and an increase in neuronal labelling for TUNEL, was elevated concurrently. During treatment there was an increase of both inducible nitric oxide synthase and glial fibrillary acidic protein labelling in glial cells and a reduction in the number of gamma-aminobutyric acid-positive neurones. The NOS inhibitors, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, dexamethasone and indomethacin potently inhibited both nitric oxide stimulation and cell death caused by LPS. In this study, the beta(2)- (ICI-18551), beta(1)- (betaxolol) and mixed beta(1)/beta(2)- (timolol, metipranolol) adrenergic receptor antagonists were all shown to attenuate LPS-induced LDH release from these cultures, but to have no effect on LPS-stimulated nitric oxide production. This effect was mimicked by the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine. Interestingly, the beta-adrenergic receptor agonists, salbutamol, arterenol and isoproterenol were also able to attenuate cell death caused by LPS. Moreover, these compounds also inhibited LPS-stimulated nitric oxide release. These studies suggest that LPS stimulates nitric oxide release from cultured retinal glial cells and that this process leads to neurone death. beta-adrenergic receptor agonists prevent the effects of LPS by inhibiting the stimulation of nitric oxide production. The data also suggest that beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists can attenuate LPS-induced death of neurones, but that these compounds act in a manner that is neurone-dependent, is mimicked by blockade of calcium channels and is independent of the stimulation of nitric oxide release.", 
    "24": "Gas6, a product of the growth-arrest-specific gene 6, protects cortical neurons from amyloid beta protein (Abeta)-induced apoptosis. Neuronal apoptosis is also caused by human group IIA secretory phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)-IIA), which is expressed in the cerebral cortex after brain ischemia. sPLA(2)-IIA induces Ca(2+) influx via L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (L-VSCCs), leading to its neurotoxicity. In the present study, we investigated effects of Gas6 on sPLA(2)-IIA-induced cell death in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons. sPLA(2)-IIA caused neuronal cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Gas6 significantly prevented neurons from sPLA(2)-IIA-induced cell death. Gas6 suppressed sPLA(2)-IIA-induced apoptotic features such as the condensation of chromatin and the fragmentation of DNA. Prior to cell death, sPLA(2)-IIA increased the influx of Ca(2+) into neurons through L-VSCCs. Gas6 significantly inhibited the sPLA(2)-IIA-induced Ca(2+) influx. The blocker of L-VSCCs also suppressed sPLA(2)-IIA-induced neuronal cell death. The cortical cultures contained few non-neuronal cells, indicating that Gas6 affected the survival of neurons directly, but not indirectly via non-neuronal cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Gas6 rescues cortical neurons from sPLA(2)-IIA-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the present study indicates that inhibition of L-VSCC contributes to the neuroprotective effect of Gas6.",

One patient with a sporadic form of ARVD/C presented with a syncope and spontaneous as well as inducible ventricular tachycardia. On the ECG, an epsilon wave could be identified. An automatic cardioverter defibrillator was implanted. The second patient had a familiar form of ARVD/C with no symptoms. There was a history of frequent sudden deaths in this family. Biopsies of the right ventricular myocardium showed fibrosis with deposition of fatty tissue. There was clear evidence of ARVD/C in the necropsy of the patient's aunt.

Before terbutaline treatment, lymphocyte beta(2)AR density and isoproterenol-induced lymphocyte cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation were not significantly different in the genotype groups; 2 weeks of terbutaline treatment significantly decreased lymphocyte beta(2)AR density and responsiveness in the 3 genotype groups to a nearly identical extent, and no differences were observed. In time-course studies, however, in groups A and C lymphocyte beta(2)AR showed significant (P <.05, repeated-measures ANOVA) down-regulation as early as 24 hours after the first terbutaline intake, whereas in group B significant (P <.05, repeated-measures ANOVA) beta(2)AR decreases were observed only 72 hours after the first terbutaline intake. Thus the time course of lymphocyte beta(2)AR down-regulation in group B was significantly (P <.01, 2-way ANOVA) different from that in groups A and C.",

    "34": "We have previously demonstrated that there is an interaction between S-propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, and ethanol on the hypnotic sensitivity of inbred short- and long-sleep mice (ISS and ILS). We found that the interaction was due to an additive hypothermic effect of ethanol and S-propranolol that markedly decreased the disappearance rate of ethanol. There was no discernible effect of S-propranolol on the hypnotic actions of ethanol as evidenced by the waking blood ethanol levels. Because ISS mice were more sensitive to this effect than were ILS mice, it seemed that there was a genetic effect to the response. Therefore, we carried out a short-term breeding project to determine whether the response could be selectively bred.", 
    "35": "We used the heterogeneous stock of mice from the Institute for Behavioral Genetics to carry out the selection study.

There was no difference between the average blood ethanol at awakening in the high line versus the low line. The effect was not due to a difference in rate of propranolol metabolism between the two lines. Sleep time with ethanol alone was not different between the high and low lines.", 
    "37": "The magnitude of the interaction between ethanol and S-propranolol is controlled by alleles with polymorphisms present in the HS stock of mice. The response is most likely due to a difference in the mechanisms of thermogenesis controlled by the beta-adrenergic receptors in muscle and fat. Because there were no sleep time differences between the high and low lines given ethanol alone, central nervous system sensitivity to ethanol is not a correlated response to the selection.", 
    "38": "We have studied the effect of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, S-propranolol, on the response of mice to anesthetic doses of ethanol. We used the selectively bred short and long sleep (ISS and ILS) mice. These mice were selected for their differential sensitivity to anesthetic doses of ethanol and then inbred. The study was prompted by the finding that the effect of ethanol on the firing rate of cerebellar Purkinje cells is modulated by beta-adrenergic input. In addition, this firing rate depression by ethanol is highly correlated with the anesthetic potency of ethanol. We were attempting to find a behavioral correlate of this effect of beta-adrenergic agents in the ISS and ILS mice.", 
    "39": "We studied the effect of S-propranolol plus ethanol on the sleep time and blood ethanol at awakening in the inbred ILS and ISS mice. We administered anesthetic doses of ethanol with and without S-propranolol.

    "40": "We found that S-propranolol caused a prolonged anesthetic time brought about by ethanol but only in ISS mice. There was no significant difference in the blood ethanol levels at awakening with or without S-propranolol, indicating that S-propranolol had no effect on the brain sensitivity. Subsequently, we showed that this was due to a profound hypothermia caused by a combination of S-propranolol and ethanol. This was greater in the ISS mice because a larger dose of ethanol was required for the anesthetic effect of ethanol. The effect on ethanol disappearance rate, temperature drop, and anesthesia time all were largely reversed by placing the animals in an incubator at 32 to 33 degrees C.", 
    "41": "Profound hypothermia lowers the ethanol disappearance rate when both S-propranolol and ethanol are given. The effect of S-propranolol is likely due to the blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors that prevents thermogenic responses to the hypothermia brought about by ethanol. The results indicated that there might be a genetic effect controlling the hypothermic response to the combination of S-propranolol and ethanol. Further experiments to investigate this are reported in a subsequent article. We could find no evidence of a central nervous system effect of S-propranolol on the hypnotic actions of ethanol in these strains of mice.", 
    "42": "Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) induces acute proximal tubular necrosis as a consequence of lipid peroxidation and oxidative tissue damage, which eventually leads to high incidence of renal adenocarcinoma in rodents. This study was designed to investigate the effect of carvedilol, an antihypertensive and trimetazidine, an antiischemic, both the drugs with additional antioxidative potentials, on Fe-NTA induced nephrotoxicity in rats. One hour after a single i.p. injection of Fe-NTA (8 mg iron per kg), a marked deterioration of renal architecture and renal function as evidenced by a sharp increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine was observed. Fe-NTA induced a significant renal oxidative stress demonstrated by elevated thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) and reduction in activities of renal catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR). Pretreatment of animals with carvedilol (2 mg/kg, i.p.) as well as with trimetazidine (3 mg/kg, i.p.), 30 min before Fe-NTA administration markedly attenuated renal dysfunction, reduced elevated TBARS, restored the depleted renal antioxidant enzymes and normalised the renal morphological alterations. These results clearly demonstrate the role of oxidative stress and its relation to renal dysfunction, and suggest a protective effect of carvedilol and trimetazidine on Fe-NTA-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.",

In some eyes (operated eyes) a NO electrode was inserted adjacent to the TM (scleral flap). Vascular perfusion/intraocular pressures (VPP/IOP) were recorded. In operated eyes, epinephrine (1 nM-100 microM) increased NO (maximally 979.9 +/- 117.6 nM, mean +/- SDM). Timolol (1 mM) shifted the epinephrine-NO concentration-response curve rightward (2.94 log units) without significantly changing the maximal response (903.0 +/- 67.7 nM, mean +/- SDM). The non-selective NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NMMA (100 microM) virtually abolished the NO response to epinephrine. L-NMMA alone (1 microM-100 microM) significantly reduced tonic NO generation (maximally 109.5 +/- 24.9 nM, mean +/- SDM), whereas timolol alone (1 microM-1 mM) had no effect. In unoperated eyes, epinephrine (1 nM-100 microM) reduced IOP (maximally 2.56 +/- 0.64 mmHg, mean +/- SDM). Epinephrine (100 microM) mildly increased VPP (4.6 +/- 1.3 mmHg, mean +/- SDM). Baseline aqueous humor formation rate (11.5 +/- 3.2 microl/min, mean +/- SDM) was unaffected. Effluent perfusate (effusate) total NO(2)(-) was determined by enzymatically reducing all NO(3)(-) to NO(2)(-), then assessing resultant NO(2)(-) (Griess assay). Epinephrine (1 nM-1 microM) increased effusate NO(2)(-) (maximally 15.8 +/- 4.9 microM, mean +/- SDM). Timolol (1 mM) reduced, and L-NMMA (100 microM) virtually abolished effusate NO(2)(-) response to epinephrine. L-NMMA alone (1 microM-100 microM) reduced tonic effusate NO(2)(-) (maximally from 5.8 +/- 1.6 microM to 1.1 +/- 0.9 microM, mean +/- SDM), whereas timolol alone (1 microM-1 mM) had no effect.

    "44": "In the present study, we sought to investigate the effects of differing inotropic conditions on regional myocardial function in ischaemic segments. In an experimental pig model ( n =11), the regional deformation parameters peak systolic strain rate [SR(SYS) (peak velocity of thickening)], systolic strain [epsilon(SYS) (systolic wall thickening)] and post-systolic strain [epsilon(PST) (ongoing wall thickening after end of systole)] were measured during normal perfusion and regional ischaemia of the posterior wall. These parameters were compared with global contractility [E(ES) (end-systolic elastance)] measured by a conductance catheter. Ischaemia was induced by an active coronary hypoperfusion in the circumflex coronary artery. Measurements were done at baseline, during dobutamine and during esmolol infusion. In normal perfused hearts, SR(SYS) (4.8+/-0.2 s(-1) at baseline) increased during dobutamine infusion, decreased during esmolol infusion and correlated significantly with global E(ES). In addition, epsilon(SYS) averaged 93+/-3% at baseline and there was almost no epsilon(PST) (4+/-1%) in normal myocardium. In ischaemic myocardium, SR(SYS) and epsilon(SYS) were significantly reduced compared with normal myocardium at baseline (SR(SYS)=2.8+/-0.3 s(-1), and epsilon(SYS)=43+/-6%; P <0.001 compared with normal perfused hearts), whereas global E(ES) was unchanged. In contrast, epsilon(PST) was significantly increased in regional ischaemic segments compared with the non-ischaemic myocardium (15+/-2%; P <0.001). During the dobutamine infusion, SR(SYS) remained unchanged. In contrast, epsilon(SYS) decreased (25+/-5%; P <0.001) and epsilon(PST) increased (25+/-4%; P <0.05) significantly during dobutamine infusion in ischaemic myocardium. In ischaemic segments, an inotropic stimulation with dobutamine resulted in a shift of strain from systole (epsilon(SYS)) to post-systole (epsilon(PST)). Thus dobutamine induced ineffective myocardial work in ischaemic segments.", 
    "45": "Although the renin-angiotensin and the beta-adrenergic systems are interrelated, a direct interaction between beta-adrenergic receptors (betaARs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) has not been identified.", 
    "46": "Here, we provide evidence for a functional and physiological interaction between 2 G protein-coupled receptors: the betaAR and the AT1R. Selective blockade of betaARs in mouse cardiomyocytes inhibits angiotensin-induced contractility with an IC50 that is similar to its inhibition of isoproterenol-mediated contractility. Furthermore, administration of the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan to intact mice results in a significant reduction in the maximal response to catecholamine-induced elevation of heart rate. The mechanism for this transinhibitory effect of beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers is through receptor-G protein uncoupling; ie, beta-blockers interfere with AT1R-Gq coupling, and valsartan interferes with betaAR-Gs coupling. Finally, we demonstrate that AT1Rs and betaARs form constitutive complexes that are not affected by ligand stimulation. As a result of these interactions, a single receptor antagonist effectively blocks downstream signaling and trafficking of both receptors simultaneously.", 
    "47": "We show that direct interactions between betaARs and AT1Rs may have profound consequences on the overall response to drugs that antagonize these receptors.", 
    "48": "Although in the respiratory system there is great therapeutic interest in manipulating and understanding the beta-adrenoceptor-G-protein-adenylate cyclase (AC) signal transduction pathway, little is known on segmental differences among lung, bronchus, and trachea with regard to the receptor concentration and interaction to G-proteins and coupling to AC. In this study, patterns of distribution and absolute quantities of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes beta(1) and beta(2) were determined in membranes of equine lung parenchyma, bronchial and tracheal epithelium with the underlying smooth muscle by saturation and competition binding assays using the radioligand (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). Additionally, the functional coupling of beta-adrenoceptors to G-proteins (assessed by beta-agonist competition binding in the presence and absence of GTP) as well as the coupling efficiency and biochemical activities of AC was investigated in each region. The specific ICYP binding was rapid, reversible, saturable with time and of high affinity. The radioligand binding identified more total beta-adrenoceptors in the lung than in bronchus or trachea (428+/-19, 162.4+/-4.8, 75.6+/-1.2 fmol/mg protein, respectively) with about 40% of receptors in the high affinity state. The beta(2)-adrenoceptor subtype predominated in all segments (approximately 74-80%), as the highly selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 was about 10,000 times more potent in inhibiting ICYP binding than was the beta(1)-selective adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A, and beta-adrenoceptor agonists inhibited ICYP binding with an order of potency: (-)-isoprenaline>(-)-adrenaline>(-)-noradrenaline. The dissociation constant (K(d)) was higher in the trachea than in bronchus or lung (13.0+/-0.9 pM vs. 20.0+/-2.3 pM vs. 30.8+/-4.4 pM, P<0.05, respectively). The beta(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated AC response was tissue-dependent; stimulants acting on beta-adrenoceptor (isoproterenol), G-protein (GTP, NaF) and AC (forskolin, Mn(2+)) enhanced AC responses in all three regions, but the AC activity was higher in tracheal crude membranes than in bronchus or lung (trachea>bronchus>lung), hence, the number of beta(2)-adrenoceptors correlated inversely with the amount of AC. We conclude that (1) the stoichiometry of components within the pulmonary beta-adrenoceptor-G-protein complex is segment-dependent, and (2) the receptor number or AC activity is possibly the rate-limiting factor in the beta-adrenoceptor-G-protein-AC-mediated physiological responses. Thus, it is speculated that this could have important therapeutic consequences in beta-adrenoceptor agonist-induced receptor regulation in bronchial asthma.", 
    "49": "The vasorelaxing activity of the aqueous extract of fish Balistes capriscus skin (AEBc) on mesenteric arterial bed (MAB) of rats was studied. The bolus injections of AEBc (bolus of 5.1, 10.2, 20.5, and 41.1mg) significantly inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the maximal contractile response induced by methoxamine (30 microM) in MAB. The vasodilatation action of AEBc is not mediated through beta-adrenoceptors or cyclo-oxigenase, since it was not affected by propranolol (20 microM) or diclofenac sodium (3 microM). The vasodilator response induced by subsequent addition of AEBc Balistes capriscus in bolus was significantly reduced in water infusion for endothelium removal. Treatment with an inhibitor of NO synthase (L-NAME, 10 microM) decreased AEBc effect. The guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue (MB, 100 microM) had no significant effect on AEBc-induced vasodilatation. These results suggest that the vasorelaxing effect of AEBc is mediated by endothelium-dependent (NO/EDRF) and endothelium-independent neurally induced vasorelaxation from nonadrenergic and noncholinergic nerves (NO).",

    "65": "Oxidative stress is markedly increased after kidney transplantation and may participate in the development and/or progression of chronic renal allograft nephropathy. In the present study we sought to assess the nephroprotective potential of antioxidative treatment in renal allograft recipients. Experiments were performed in the Fisher-Lewis rat model of chronic renal allograft nephropathy, with isografted Lewis rats serving as controls. Allografted rats were orally treated with carvedilol, an antihypertensive drug with antioxidative properties (25 mg/kg/d), its purely antioxidative derivative BM 91.0228 (5 mg/kg/d), alpha-tocopherol (100 mg/kg/d), a combination of propranolol/doxazosine (10/5 mg/kg/d), or vehicle for 24 weeks. At the end of the study, oxidative status and influence of antioxidative treatment were assessed in transplanted animals. Chronic allograft nephropathy was characterized by a marked increase of markers for oxidative stress (increased plasma and kidney levels of malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, and tocopherol levels in renal allografts). Treatment with carvedilol, BM 91.0228, and tocopherol significantly improved antioxidative status of allograft kidney recipients. In addition, carvedilol reduced elevated blood pressure in allografted rats. However none of the drugs had a beneficial influence on functional and morphologic renal changes. Our data thus demonstrate that long-term treatment with the antioxidants carvedilol, BM 91.0228, or alpha-tocopherol does not prevent development of chronic transplant nephropathy, despite an improvement of antioxidative status.", 
    "66": "The aim of this study was to assess the effects of long-term nebivolol therapy on high blood pressure, impaired endothelial function in aorta, and damage observed in heart and conductance arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). For this purpose, SHR were treated for 9 weeks with nebivolol (8 mg/kg per day). Untreated SHR and Wistar Kyoto rats were used as hypertensive and normotensive controls, respectively. The left ventricle/body weight ratio was used as an index of cardiac hypertrophy, and to evaluate vascular function, responses induced by potassium chloride, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside were tested on aortic rings. Aortic morphometry and fibrosis were determined in parallel by a quantitative technique. Systolic blood pressure, measured by the tail-cuff method, was lower in treated SHR than in the untreated group (194 +/- 3 versus 150 +/- 4 mm Hg). The cardiac hypertrophy index was significantly reduced by the treatment. In aortic rings, treatment with nebivolol significantly reduced the maximal response to both KCl and NA in SHR. In vessels precontracted with phenylephrine relaxant, activity due to acetylcholine was higher in normotensive rats than in SHR and the treatment significantly improved this response. The effect of sodium nitroprusside on aortic rings was similar in all groups. Medial thickness and collagen content were significantly reduced in comparison with SHR. In conclusion, the chronic antihypertensive effect of nebivolol in SHR was accompanied by an improvement in vascular structure and function and in the cardiac hypertrophy index.",

These inhibitions were similarly observed after depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by ryanodine. Regardless of the presence of ryanodine, after washout of isoflurane, its inhibition of the norepinephrine response (both [Ca2+]i and force) was significantly prolonged, whereas that of the KCl response was quickly restored. In the ryanodine-treated strips, the norepinephrine- and KCl-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were both eliminated by nifedipine, a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blocker, whereas only the former was inhibited by niflumic acid, a Ca2+-activated Cl- channel blocker. Isoflurane caused a rightward shift of the Ca2+-force relation only in the fura-2-loaded strips but not in the beta-escin-permeabilized strips.", 
    "71": "In mesenteric resistance arteries, isoflurane depresses vascular smooth muscle reactivity by directly inhibiting both Ca2+ mobilization and myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. Isoflurane inhibits both norepinephrine- and KCl-induced voltage-gated Ca2+ influx. During stimulation with norepinephrine, isoflurane may prevent activation of Ca2+-activated Cl- channels and thereby inhibit voltage-gated Ca2+ influx in a prolonged manner. The presence of the plasma membrane appears essential for its inhibition of the myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity.", 
    "72": "Chronic heart failure continues to exact a heavy burden on society due to high morbidity and mortality, in spite of advances in management. Beta-adrenergic blockade, by the suppression of sympathetic activity, attenuates the adverse ventricular remodeling seen in heart failure, and decreases mortality and hospitalization rates. Recently reported trials, meta-analyses, and sub-analyses extend the benefit of beta-blockade to severe heart failure, women, elderly patients, and African Americans. In addition, recent data also indicate the cost-effectiveness of beta-blockade in combating this deadly disease. These data indicate the strength of evidence for the use of beta-blockade for most patients with chronic heart failure.",

Various levels within the apoptotic cascade are being investigated as therapeutic targets. Caspase inhibitors, mitochondrial stabilizers, and Na+-H+ exchanger inhibitors reduce cell death by apoptosis and infarct size. Although most of the evidence at present is limited to the laboratory animals, this approach seems to hold a promise for the future.", 
    "74": "In cases of chronic congestive heart failure, QT-interval dispersion is a strong predictor of death. Carvedilol therapy appears to decrease QT-interval dispersion. We investigated whether carvedilol reduces QT-interval dispersion in congestive heart failure and whether this pharmaceutical agent has additional effects on elderly patients. Seventy-seven ambulatory patients who had chronic congestive heart failure were evaluated for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol abuse, concomitant medications, and QT-interval dispersion. Carvedilol therapy was then initiated. Six months later, we re-evaluated the same variables, as well as morbidity and mortality rates, and number of hospitalizations. The patients were divided into 2 groups: Group I, aged < 65 years (n = 42); and Group II, aged > or = 65 years (n = 35). Statistics were analyzed with the Student's t-test chi2 test, and Cox regression model. At 6 months, both groups showed significantly decreased QT-interval dispersion values compared with baseline values (76.9 +/- 29.3 vs 104.3 +/- 41.5 ms, respectively; P < 0.0001). An elevated QT-interval dispersion value at baseline increased morbidity (P = 0.041) but not hospitalization (P > 0.05). Group II had a smaller reduction in QT-interval dispersion than did Group I (24.41 +/- 29.36 and 30.98 +/- 32.70 ms, respectively), but this difference was not significant. We conclude that in ambulatory patients with chronic congestive heart failure, long-term carvedilol therapy significantly decreases QT-interval dispersion, and this effect is uniformly distributed between patients aged < 65 years and those aged 265 years.", 
    "75": "Electrical conductance is greatly altered in end-stage heart failure, but little is known about the underlying events. We therefore investigated the expression of genes coding for major inward and outward ion channels, calcium binding proteins, ion receptors, ion exchangers, calcium ATPases, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases in explanted hearts (n=13) of patients diagnosed with end-stage heart failure. With the exception of Kv11.1 and Kir3.1 and when compared with healthy controls, major sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels, ion transporters, and exchangers were significantly repressed, but expression of Kv7.1, HCN4, troponin C and I, SERCA1, and phospholamban was elevated. Hierarchical gene cluster analysis provided novel insight into regulated gene networks. Significant induction of the transcriptional repressor m-Bop and the translational repressor NAT1 coincided with repressed cardiac gene expression. The statistically significant negative correlation between repressors and ion channels points to a mechanism of disease. We observed coregulation of ion channels and the androgen receptor and propose a role for this receptor in ion channel regulation. Overall, the reversal of repressed ion channel gene expression in patients with implanted assist devices exemplifies the complex interactions between pressure load/stretch force and heart-specific gene expression.",

In contrast, diabetic hearts exhibited reduced activity and expression of MMP-2 and decreased expression of membrane type-1 MMP (MT1-MMP). Both intravascular and extravascular collagen type I and III immunoreactivity and fibrin deposition were seen in diabetic coronary vessels. These alterations were reversed to nondiabetic levels by the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker candesartan, which prevented the development of perivascular fibrosis observed after Masson's trichrome staining.",

    "93": "To define the binding characteristics of fluoroquinolones to synthetic levodopa melanin, the binding of various drugs, including levofloxacin and ofloxacin, and positive controls (timolol and chloroquine), was investigated in-vitro. The affinity and capacity of the drug binding were calculated by Langmuir's adsorption isotherm. The affinity constant (K) and the binding capacity (r(max)) of levofloxacin were similar to those of timolol and much lower than those of chloroquine. Racemic ofloxacin and its enantiomers showed similar K and r(max), suggesting that the binding lacked stereoselectivity. The binding experiment with levofloxacin derivatives indicated that the basic nitrogen atom at position 7 of the quinolone ring, but not carboxyl group at position 3, would play a critical role in the interaction of fluoroquinolones with melanin. The melanin-drug complexes of levofloxacin and chloroquine were washed with neutral phosphate buffer, ethanol and 1 M HCl solution to explain the nature of the interaction of melanin with the drugs. Electrostatic forces mainly participate in the formation of the chloroquine-melanin complex, whereas van der Waals' and hydrophobic interactions are involved in the levofloxacin-melanin complex in addition to electrostatic forces. The interactions of various fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin, enoxacin, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin with melanin were also studied. The results showed that the relative K value was: chloroquine approximately ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin >/= lomefloxacin > timolol, levofloxacin approximately enoxacin, norfloxacin, and that the relative r(max) value was: norfloxacin, enoxacin >/= chloroquine, sparfloxacin > levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, timolol, lomefloxacin. The fluoroquinolones vary in their affinity and capacity to bind with melanin, and ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin showed a stronger interaction with melanin than the other fluoroquinolones studied.",

Investigated regimens were travoprost 0.004% once daily, latanoprost 0.005% once daily, and timolol 0:5% twice daily. In both studies, mean IOP was significantly lower in blacks treated with travoprost. The IOP reduction was also significantly greater in blacks after adjustments for age, sex, iris color, diagnosis, and corneal thickness. Timolol lowered mean IOP to a greater extent in nonblack patients. The significantly larger IOP reduction with travoprost compared with timolol in both racial groups was more pronounced in blacks. Travoprost also was superior to latanoprost in blacks. Mean changes from baseline generally were greater for black than for nonblack patients, although the differences did not achieve statistical significance. The response rate to travoprost was higher in blacks. The most common adverse effect was hyperemia.",

It is presently unknown whether beta-blockers reduce perioperative risk in patients with chronic heart failure. Thus, data of the CIBIS II study were analyzed regarding the effect of bisoprolol on perioperative outcome in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. A total of 2647 patients with heart failure in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV and left ventricular ejection fraction < or =35% were randomized to bisoprolol or placebo in a double-blind randomized study. Of these patients, 165 underwent surgery (bisoprolol, n = 87; placebo, n = 78). In patients undergoing surgery, mortality was not different between the placebo- and bisoprolol-treated group (7.7% vs 5.8%, p = 0.76).

The simultaneous determination of both analytes was possible by PLS1 processing of sample absorbances between 255 and 300 nm for ATE and evaluation of absorbances in the 253-268 nm region for CTD. The mean recoveries for synthetic samples were 100.3 +/- 1.0% and 100.7 +/- 0.7% for ATE and CTD, respectively. Application of the proposed method to two commercial tablet preparations in the content uniformity test showed them to contain 103.5 +/- 0.8% and 104.9 +/- 1.8% ATE respectively, as well as 103.4 +/- 1.2% and 104.5 +/- 2.2% CTD. Use of this method also allowed the elaboration of dissolution profiles of the drugs in two commercial combined formulation products, through the simultaneous determination of both drugs during the dissolution test. At the dissolution time of 45 min specified by USP XXIV, both pharmaceutical formulations complied with the test.", 
    "97": "Beta3-adrenergic receptors (AR) are nearly exclusively expressed in brown and white adipose tissues, and chronic activation of these receptors by selective agonists has profound anti-diabetes and anti-obesity effects. This study examined metabolic responses to acute and chronic beta3-AR activation in wild-type C57Bl/6 mice and congenic mice lacking functional uncoupling protein (UCP)1, the molecular effector of brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. Acute activation of beta3-AR doubled metabolic rate in wild-type mice and sharply elevated body temperature and BAT blood flow, as determined by laser Doppler flowmetry. In contrast, beta3-AR activation did not increase BAT blood flow in mice lacking UCP1 (UCP1 KO). Nonetheless, beta3-AR activation significantly increased metabolic rate and body temperature in UCP1 KO mice, demonstrating the presence of UCP1-independent thermogenesis. Daily treatment with the beta3-AR agonist CL-316243 (CL) for 6 days increased basal and CL-induced thermogenesis compared with naive mice. This expansion of basal and CL-induced metabolic rate did not require UCP1 expression. Chronic CL treatment of UCP1 KO mice increased basal and CL-stimulated metabolic rate of epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) fourfold but did not alter BAT thermogenesis. After chronic CL treatment, CL-stimulated thermogenesis of EWAT equaled that of interscapular BAT per tissue mass. The elevation of EWAT metabolism was accompanied by mitochondrial biogenesis and the induction of genes involved in lipid oxidation. These observations indicate that chronic beta3-AR activation induces metabolic adaptation in WAT that contributes to beta3-AR-mediated thermogenesis. This adaptation involves lipid oxidation in situ and does not require UCP1 expression.", 
    "98": "A case of expulsive choroidal effusion occurring during extracapsular cataract extraction in a 75 year old woman is presented. The episode occurred at the time of insertion of the pseudophake into the ciliary sulcus. The woman had pre-existent filtering bleb and was hypertensive, factors which may have contributed to the episode. Although this is dramatic occurrence, it needs to be distinguished from expulsive choroidal hemorrhage which carries a much worse porgnosis. In this instant, management was expectant and patient attained 6/12 with over-refraction. It is recommended that patients who may be at risk for expulsive choroidal effusion should have in the bag pseudophake fixation rather than sulcus fixation to obviate pressure on the circular vascular arcade.",

    "101": "The mean and median number of quality improvement interventions directed at beta-blocker use in the past 4 years was 5.0 per hospital. The most commonly reported effort was performance reporting about beta-blocker use (87.9%), although only 26.7% used physician-specific performance reporting. More than half the hospitals implemented clinical pathways (58.1%), standing orders (56.8%), or care coordinators (50.4%). Care coordinators (63.4%) and computer support systems (61.6%) were most frequently rated as \"very effective.\" Clinical pathways (24.2%), counseling physicians who had poor performance (26.9%), and reminder forms (23.0%) were most frequently rated as not effective.",

    "103": "Novel derivatives of 1, 8-naphthyridine were synthesized from 7-amino-2-hydroxy-4-morpholinomethyl-1, 8-naphthyridine. The ability of the synthesized compounds to inhibit isoproterenol(ISO)-induced phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB) was assessed. Their ability to block both beta(1) and beta(2) receptors almost completely abolished all ISO effects on phosphorylation of PLB. Analogues with either a 7-hydroxy-2-N-ethoxycarbonylpiperazine or a 7-hydroxy-2-piperazine substituent, designated as 6 and 9 respectively, showed a higher affinity for beta(1) receptor than that of the methoxy derivatives 12 and 13. However, treatment with 30 microM 9 and 1mM 13 lead to comparable levels of PLB phosphorylation. The reduction to 6-amino derivatives 10 and 17 led to compounds possessing beta(2) receptor blocking properties. The ability of the synthesized compounds to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production was also studied. Together, these results suggest that the 1, 8-naphthyridine parent structure can be modified, to produce compounds with increased activity whose effect in rat appears to be more clearly related to antagonism of beta(1)-rather than beta(2)-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "104": "Originally described as a serine protease inhibitor, bromoenol lactone (BEL) has recently been found to potently inhibit Group VI calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2). Thus, BEL is widely used to define biological roles of iPLA2 in cells. However, BEL is also known to inhibit another key enzyme of phospholipid metabolism, namely the magnesium-dependent phosphatidate phosphohydrolase-1 (PAP-1). In this work we report that BEL is able to promote apoptosis in a variety of cell lines, including U937, THP-1, and MonoMac (human phagocyte), RAW264.7 (murine macrophage), Jurkat (human T lymphocyte), and GH3 (human pituitary). In these cells, long term treatment with BEL (up to 24 h) results in increased annexin-V binding to the cell surface and nuclear DNA damage, as detected by staining with both DAPI and propidium iodide. At earlier times (2 h), BEL induces the proteolysis of procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 and increases cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. These changes are preceded by variations in the mitochondrial membrane potential. All these effects of BEL are not mimicked by the iPLA2 inhibitor methylarachidonyl fluorophosphonate or by treating the cells with a specific iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide. However, propranolol, a PAP-1 inhibitor, is able to reproduce these effects, suggesting that it is the inhibition of PAP-1 and not of iPLA2 that is involved in BEL-induced cell death. In support of this view, BEL-induced apoptosis is accompanied by a very strong inhibition of PAP-1-regulated events, such as incorporation of [3H]choline into phospholipids and de novo incorporation of [3H]arachidonic acid into triacylglycerol. Collectively, these results stress the role of PAP-1 as a key enzyme for cell integrity and survival and in turn caution against the use of BEL in studies involving long incubation times, due to the capacity of this drug to induce apoptosis in a variety of cells.",

The procedure was performed in the drug-free state in 23 patients, and 2 to 7 days after discontinuation of chronic amiodarone therapy in 9 patients. Electrograms recorded along the ablation line before and during isoproterenol infusion were analyzed after isthmus block was achieved. Double potentials were recorded along the entire ablation line upon achievement of complete isthmus block in all patients. The DPI in 9 patients treated with amiodarone was longer than in the other patients (147 +/- 32 msec vs 119 +/- 19 msec, P < 0.001). The DPI increased as the pacing cycle length shortened in patients treated with amiodarone, but not in the other patients. At all pacing cycle lengths, isoproterenol shortened the DPI to a greater extent in the patients treated with amiodarone than in the other patients.", 
    "107": "Amiodarone results in rate-dependent prolongation of the DPI during coronary sinus pacing after ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus. Isoproterenol shortens the DPI despite the presence of complete isthmus block, and this effect is accentuated in the presence of amiodarone.",

There was optimism that IKr blockers might result in a reduction in sudden cardiac death in postinfarct population. Four trials are reviewed here, and the results are variable. The four drugs reviewed--d,l-sotalol, d-sotalol, dofetilide, and azimilide--all share IKr-blocking properties. In addition, d,l-sotalol is a beta-blocker and azimilide is an IKs blocker. The primary uses of d,l-sotalol, dofetilide, and, if approved, azimilide are currently for treatment of atrial fibrillation. Thus, the mortality trials reviewed here are primarily used as support of safety in high-risk patients, because none has achieved a mortality reduction in postinfarction patients. These trials play pivotal roles for regulatory approval of these drugs for use in atrial fibrillation.",

Many drugs have been used for the treatment of vasovagal syncope (beta-blockers, disopyramide, scopolamine, clonidine, theophylline, fludrocortisone, ephedrine, dihydroergotamine, etilefrine, midodrine, clonidine, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, enalapril). In general, although the results have been satisfactory in uncontrolled trials or short-term controlled trials, the majority of long-term placebo-controlled prospective trials have not been able to show a benefit of the active drug over placebo. Only two well-designed double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials have been performed-one for etilefrine and the other for atenolol-and both were unable to show a superiority of the active drug versus placebo. Four randomized clinical trials of pacing therapy-three positive and one negative-have been performed in patients affected by vasovagal syncope. The relationship between carotid sinus hypersensitivity and spontaneous, otherwise unexplained, syncope has been demonstrated. Cardiac pacing appears to be beneficial in carotid sinus syndrome; its efficacy has been demonstrated by two randomized controlled trials and confirmed by several pre-post comparative studies, one controlled trial, and one prospective observational study. There is evidence and general agreement that cardiac pacing is useful in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome. Usefulness of the treatment is less well established and divergence of opinion exists with regard to cardiac pacing in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of beta-blocking drugs. As yet there are insufficient data to support the use of any other pharmacologic therapy for vasovagal syncope.",

Animals were immersed in water (30 or 35 degrees C) with high-CO2 content ( approximately 1,000 parts/million; CO2-water). CO2-water for bathing was made by using an artificial spa maker with normal tap water and high-pressure CO2 from a gas cylinder. When a human foot was immersed for 10 min in the CO2-water at 35 degrees C, the immersed skin reddened, whereas skin color did not change in normal tap water at the same temperature. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), underwater skin tissue blood flow, and temperatures of the colon and immersed skin were continuously measured while animals were immersed in a bathtub of water for approximately 30 min at room temperature (26 degrees C). Immersed skin vascular resistance, computed from blood pressure and tissue blood flow, was significantly lower in the CO2-water bath than in tap water at 30 degrees C, but no differences were apparent at 35 degrees C. HR of rats in CO2-water was significantly slower than in tap water at 35 degrees C. Decreased HR in CO2-water was inhibited by infusion of atenolol (beta1-adrenoceptor blocker), but it was unaffected by atropine (muscarinic cholinoceptor blocker). Theses results suggest that bradycardia in CO2 hot spring bathing is caused by inhibition of the cardiac sympathetic innervation.

We describe a patient with generalized pustular psoriasis induced by candesartan cilexetil (AT1 receptor antagonist), who was previously diagnosed as flexural psoriasis. It is known that AT1 receptor antagonists do not increase the bradykinin level, inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system more potently than ACE inhibitor. But our results suggest that AT 1 receptor antagonists could have some ACE inhibitor potency as an up-regulator for bradykinin in our patient, with pustular eruptions developing on the psoriatic background. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reported cases of pustular psoriasis associated with AT1 receptor antagonists.",

Measurements were made of the maximum QTc interval and QTc dispersion during the various segments of the exercise test. There was no statistically significant difference between the pre-beta-blocker and post-beta-blocker maximum QTc interval during the supine (0.473 +/- 0.039 vs 0.470 +/- 0.038 sec), exercise (0.488 +/- 0.044 vs 0.500 +/- 0.026 sec), or recovery (0.490 +/- 0.031 vs 0.493 +/- 0.029 sec) phases of the exercise stress test.

A recent hypothesis suggests that interleukin-6 (IL-6), an endogenous pyrogen, elevates body temperature during stress. To investigate the role of IL-6 during stress, we measured mRNA levels of IL-6 by quantitative PCR in various tissues 60 min after exposure of mice to open field stress. IL-6 mRNA was elevated in the hypothalamus three-fold and in the pituitary two-fold. However, there was no difference between the increase in body temperature after exposure to 60 min open field stress in wild-type controls (35.2+/-0.6-37.3+/-0.5 degrees C) and IL-6-deficient animals (34.8+/-0.4-37.0+/-0.3 degrees C). In contrast to body temperature, emotional behaviour differed between wild-type controls and IL-6-deficient mice. IL-6-deficient animals showed higher locomotor activity in an open field and lower levels of exploration of the open arms of the elevated plus maze than control animals. These data suggest that IL-6 plays an important role in the control of emotionality, but not in the regulation of body temperature after psychological stress.", 
    "146": "Peripheral vascular surgery (carotid, infrainguinal or aortoiliacal) is characterised by an increased cardiac risk with an infarction rate of 1 to 4%. Sixty percent of the vascular patients present a concomitant coronary artery disease, often infraclinically. Preoperative cardiac risk stratification aims at reducing cardiac related morbidity and mortality. A clinical risk profile (patient's past history) and non-invasive cardiac tests allow subdividing the vascular patients into three categories: high risk, intermediate risk, and low risk. High-risk patients (unstable angina, recent infarction, overt congestive heart failure and critical aortic valve stenosis) require immediate intensive management of their underlying cardiac disease. This means delay or annulation of the planned vascular operation. For intermediate risk patients, a clinical cardiac risk index based on patient's past history (stable angina, previous infarction or episode of congestive heart failure, age of 70 years or more and diabetes) offers a rough orientation. These clinical markers lack specificity, since they are found in almost all vascular patients. The adjunction of a non-invasive cardiac testing allows to optimise the cardiac risk evaluation. Stress echocardiography with dobutamine has become a very popular test, with a negative predicting value exceeding 90%, but with a lack of specificity (many vascular patients have an uneventful postoperative outcome, despite a positive dobutamine test). These inconsistent results of cardiac risk evaluation render their routine use questionable. Nowadays, the management of patients requiring vascular surgery is based on the concept that every vascular patient should be considered as suffering from coronary artery disease. A certain degree of myocardial protection should be offered to every vascular surgery candidate. A preoperative treatment with betablockers provides myocardial protection against the operative stress and lowers myocardial oxygen requirement. There are arguments to continue or start aspirin treatment in the preoperative period, in order to lower the risk of sudden coronary thrombosis.", 
    "147": "The aims of this study was to characterize the functional response of atypical beta-adrenoceptors (beta-AR) in rat aorta and to investigate whether this relaxation was altered before and during the development of hypertension. Aortic rings from 4 or 12 weeks old Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats or spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were placed in organ baths and constricted with phenylephrine. Then, cumulative concentration-relaxation curves to the beta-AR agonists were constructed. In intact aortic rings from 12 weeks old WKY rats, CGP 12,177 (CGP) and cyanopindolol (partial beta 3-AR agonists and atypical beta-AR agonists with beta 1/beta 2-AR antagonist properties) produced concentration-dependent relaxation (pD2 = 5.09 +/- 0.03; Emax = 60.4 +/- 2.5%; n = 9; pD2 = 6.17 +/- 0.05; Emax = 95.9 +/- 1%; n = 5 respectively). The endothelium removal did not modify this relaxation. In 12 weeks old WKY rats, the endothelium-independent relaxation to CGP was not modified in the presence of nadolol (beta 1/beta 2-AR antagonist) or L-748 337 (beta 3-AR antagonist) excluding the participation of beta 1, beta 2 et beta 3-AR in this effect. By contrast, this relaxation was significantly inhibited by CGP 20712A or bupranolol, atypical beta-AR antagonists at high concentrations. In 12 weeks old SHR, endothelium-independent relaxation to CGP or cyanopindolol was greatly inhibited. In order to sought out whether impairment of atypical beta-AR-mediated relaxation was due to hypertension, experiments were performed in 4 weeks old SHR. At this age, CGP-induced relaxation was greatly inhibited compared to that obtained in age-matched WKY rats. In 12 weeks old SHR pretreated with pertussis toxin (10 micrograms/kg i.p./3 days), the relaxant effect to CGP was partly restored. We conclude that the atypical beta-AR were functionally expressed in aortic vascular smooth muscle cells of rat aorta. In 4 or 12 weeks old SHR rats, atypical beta-AR-mediated relaxation was impaired, suggesting that this dysfunction occurs before the establishment of hypertension. Gi proteins may be one of the factors that contributes to this impairment.", 
    "148": "It is not clear which duration of treatment is needed to achieve complete efficacy with fixed low dose antihypertensive therapy. The aim of this study was to compare blood pressure control rate in patients treated with bisoprolol 2.5 mg/HCTZ 6.25 mg, not controlled after 4 weeks, but treated at the same dosage for one more month to patients not controlled after 4 weeks, and uptitrated to bisoprolol 5 mg/HCTZ 6.25 mg for one month. The 641 patients who entered the study had a mean age of 58 +/- 12 with SBP/DBP at baseline of 165 +/- 12/96 +/- 7 mmHg. After 4 weeks, 252 (39%) where normalized (< 140/90) with SBP/DBP reductions of -27/-15 mmHg. In uncontrolled patients, 19% of those randomized to B 2.5 mg/H 6.25 mg and 33% of those treated with B 5 mg/H 6.25 mg where normalized at the end of the study (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicates determinants of blood pressure normalisation after 4 weeks with B2.5 mg/HCTZ 6.25 mg as female gender, initial BP < 175/105 mmHg, previously untreated hypertension, age < 50 years. In conclusion, when the initial therapy with bisoprolol 2.5 mg/HCTZ 6.25 mg is not sufficient to control blood pressure, continuation with the same dosage 4 weeks longer increases the rate of blood pressure control. However, up-titration to bisoprolol 5 mg/6.25 mg is more efficacious to increase the number of patients with a final blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg.",

Bispectral index (BIS) and the performance of routine anesthetic depth indicators were analyzed in 45 patients undergoing abdominal surgery: Group I (n = 12), isoflurane/fentanyl/nitrous oxide in oxygen anesthesia; Group II (n = 16), isoflurane/fentanyl/nitrous oxide in oxygen with 10 mg atenolol intravenously prior to anesthesia; Group III (n = 17), isoflurane/fentanyl/nitrous oxide in oxygen with a maximum end-tidal isoflurane concentration of 0.4 vol.% and incremental doses of atenolol (5 mg intravenously stepwise). In all groups, blood pressure (BP) was maintained within +/- 20% of preoperatively defined baseline BP and heart rate (HR) between 50-80 beats x min(-1). BP, HR, and end-tidal isoflurane were tested for their potential to predict BIS using a previously described statistical model (P(K)).",

Higher BIS values were reached at emergence in atenolol-treated patients. The performance of hemodynamic variables or end-tidal isoflurane to predict BIS was moderate even at critical intraoperative events, but unaffected by atenolol.",

Six-month composite incidence of death, new myocardial infarction, refractory angina or readmission for unstable angina was 25.4%. The majority of patients had beta-blocker and aspirin both in hospital and at 6 months. Low molecular weight heparin was used in 76% of patients. Statins were used in 52% of patients in hospital and in 64% at 6 months. Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists were used in 18% of all patients. The overall rate of coronary angiography was 40% in hospital and 54% at 6 months, but there was large interhospital variation. Overall, only 45% of very high-risk patients underwent angiography during initial hospitalization.

    "161": "In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study, a major reduction of all-cause mortality--especially cardiovascular mortality--in patients with diabetes with left ventricular hypertrophy was reported for treatment with losartan. We postulated post hoc that losartan might have a better effect on sudden cardiac death than atenolol, and we aimed to test this hypothesis. 44 patients with diabetes died of sudden cardiac death; significantly fewer deaths arose in the losartan group (14) than in the atenolol group (30; p=0.027). In the losartan group, five (6%) of 86 patients with diabetes and atrial fibrillation during the trial died of sudden cardiac death compared with nine (2%) of 500 in those without atrial fibrillation. The respective figures for the atenolol group were 14 (13%) of 105 and 16 (3%) of 504. Our results suggest losartan affords better protection against cardiac death from arrhythmias for patients with diabetes mellitus than does atenolol. Importantly, our analyses were exploratory and require confirmation.", 
    "162": "Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) exhibit a decrease in maximal exercise capacity in response to a cold environment. The aim of this study was to further investigate the impact of cold exposure on submaximal exercise capacity, systemic adrenergic drive, and the effects of long-term beta-adrenergic blockade on these parameters. Thirty-three patients with CHF, with exercise limited by dyspnea and left ventricular ejection fraction of 26 +/- 4%, were randomized to receive metoprolol or carvedilol for 6 months. The observations were compared with 12 age-matched healthy volunteers. Maximal exercise performance with gas exchange analyses were assessed using a ramp protocol, and endurance capacity was measured using 2 constant-load exercise tests performed randomly at 20 degrees C and -8 degrees C. Healthy volunteers increased their submaximal exercise time by 20% (1,353 +/- 455 [20 degrees C] vs 1,635 +/- 475 seconds [-8 degrees C]; p <0.05), whereas patients with CHF exhibited a 21% decrease in exercise time (1,182 +/- 549 [20 degrees C] vs 931 +/- 524 seconds [-8 degrees C]; p <0.05) at -8 degrees C. Beta blockers increased submaximal exercise duration at 20 degrees C (+261 +/- 617 seconds; p <0.05) and -8 degrees C (+374 +/- 729 seconds; p <0.05). Norepinephrine increased to a greater extent at 4 minutes and at the time of exhaustion (at -8 degrees C) only in patients with CHF. Beta-adrenergic blockade caused no significant decrease in plasma norepinephrine levels. Patients with symptomatic CHF exhibited a significant decrease in submaximal exercise time in response to moderate cold exposure. Beta-blocker therapy with either metoprolol or carvedilol significantly increases submaximal exercise time and attenuates the impact of cold exposure on functional capacity.", 
    "163": "Are lives saved or heart attacks prevented by antihypertensive therapy, as a result of blood pressure reduction alone, or because of other properties of the antihypertensive medications which are independent of blood pressure lowering? Long-acting calcium antagonists seem to be as effective as thiazide diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in preventing all-cause mortality and stroke in patients with hypertension, but are probably inferior to ACE inhibitors in preventing coronary artery disease. In patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease, calcium antagonists are generally as effective as beta-blockers in relieving angina and improving exercise time-to-onset of angina or ischaemia. Unstable angina or myocardial infarction require treatment with a beta-blocker, with an ACE inhibitor added when necessary for blood pressure control or if there is significant left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. If beta-blockers are contraindicated and if there is no LV dysfunction, a non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist can be substituted.", 
    "164": "It is well-known that the mineralocorticoid action of glycyrrhizin, which is the major component of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, is caused by a defect in the conversion of cortisol to cortisone by the inhibition of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme activity. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of salt and water retention in the kidney of rats administered excess amounts of glycyrrhizin (200 mg/kg/day, p.o.). Up-regulation of aquaporin (AQP) 2 and 3 water channels was detected in the renal inner and outer medulla by Western blot analysis in rats treated with glycyrrhizin for 0.5, 1 and 2 consecutive weeks. Our results show that urine flow rates and sodium excretion rates in glycyrrhizin-treated rats were decreased significantly, but creatinine clearance (Ccr) was not altered. The decreases of urine volume and urinary sodium excretion in glycyrrhizin-treated rats were reversed by a 2-week injection of spironolactone, which is a well-known mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blocker. These results suggest that the retention of water and salt in glycyrrhizin-treated rats is, at least in part, accounted for by the increased expression of AQP 2 and 3 in the kidney, which may be causally related to the MR.",

    "169": "Elements with insulator/border activity have been characterized most extensively in Drosophila melanogaster. In vertebrates, the first example of such an element was provided by a hypersensitive site of the chicken beta-globin locus, cHS4. It has been proposed that the homologous site in humans, HS5, functions as a border of the human beta-globin locus. Here, we have characterized HS5 of the human beta-globin locus control region. We have examined its tissue-specificity and assessed its insulating properties in transgenic mice using a lacZ reporter assay. Most importantly, we have tested its enhancer blocking activity in the context of the full beta-globin locus. Our results show that HS5 is erythroid-specific rather than ubiquitous in human tissues. Furthermore, HS5 does not fulfil the criteria of a general in vivo insulator in the transgene protection assay. Finally, a HS5 conditional deletion from the complete locus demonstrates that HS5 has no discernable activity in adult erythroid cells. Surprisingly, HS5 functions as an enhancer blocker in embryonic erythroid cells. We conclude that HS5 is a developmental stage-specific border in erythroid cells.", 
    "170": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the most prevalent cause of dementia with ageing. Pharmacological treatment of AD is based on the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which have beneficial effects on cognitive, functional, and behavioural symptoms of the disease, but their role in AD pathogenesis is unknown. Other pharmacological therapies are becoming available--including the recently approved drug memantine, an NMDA channel blocker indicated for advanced AD. Here, we review clinical features of the available cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) including their pharmacological properties, the evidence for switching from one agent to another, \"head to head\" studies, and the emerging evidence for the use of memantine in AD. New therapeutic approaches--including those more closely targeted to the pathogenesis of the disease--will also be reviewed. These potentially disease modifying treatments include amyloid-beta-peptide vaccination, secretase inhibitors, cholesterol-lowering drugs, metal chelators, and anti-inflammatory agents."
