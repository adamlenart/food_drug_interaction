In high doses, thiazide diuretics and loop diuretics can induce at least short-term increases in levels of total plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Low-dose thiazide diuretics do not produce these effects. beta-blockers may increase levels of plasma triglycerides transiently and reduce levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. alpha-blockers may decrease serum cholesterol concentration to a modest degree and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium antagonists, and central adrenergic agonists have clinically neutral effects on levels of serum lipids and lipoproteins.", 
    "1": "Based on many epidemiological studies, hypertensive diabetics have been regarded as high risk for cardiovascular disease. The sixth Joint National Committee guideline (JNC VI) recommended to start hypotensive agents even at high normal blood pressure, i.e. over 130/85 mmHg and lower their blood pressure to less than 130/85 mmHg. If patients are associated with renal dysfunction (proteinuria of more than 1 g/day), the target blood pressure would be less than 125/75 mmHg. These target blood pressures were supported Hypertension Optimal Treatment study and/or UKPDS. ACE inhibitors, Ca-antagonists or alpha-blockers were regarded as one of the first line drugs. Japanese Society of Hypertension has established the guideline for hypertension treatment, in which almost the same recommendation has been made for diabetics except one point, i.e., at high normal blood pressure, lifestyle modification might be the initial treatment followed by hypotensive agents if their blood pressure dose not go down to less than 130/85 mmHg during the next 3-6 months. Based on these guidelines, more vigorous antihypertensive treatment would be recommended in diabetics to reduce micro- and macrovascular disease.", 
    "2": "In patients with hypertension and chronic renal parenchymal disease, BP should be controlled to 130/85 mmHg or lower (125/75 mmHg) in patients with proteinuria in excess of 1 g/day. Reducing dietary sodium (< 7 g/day) and protein (< 0.6-0.7 g/kg) helps control high BP and renal function in patients with renal insufficiency. As first antihypertensive drug, ACE inhibitors or long-acting Ca antagonists are recommended. In patients with renovascular hypertension, angioplasty is the first choice increasingly to be accompanied by stenting, and surgical revascularization is the next choice. As antihypertensive drugs, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and AII-receptor blockers are recommended. Hypertension accompanied by endocrine disease with adenoma or tumor is almost cured or improved by surgical removal. Spironolactone and Ca antagonists are used in patients with idiopathic aldosteronism (bilateral hyperplasia). Alpha and beta blockers are used in patients with pheochromocytoma during preoperative period.", 
    "3": "Many antihypertensive drugs are available to treat patients with essential hypertension. Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) recently published 'Guidelines for the management of Hypertension (JSH 2000)'. JSH 2000 chooses six drugs(calcium antagonist, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor antagonist, diuretic, beta-blocker, alpha-blocker) as first lines of antihypertensive treatment. These six drugs have different pharmacological characteristics and there are compelling indications for specific drugs in certain clinical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, organ damages, and elderly hypertensives etc. Usually a low dose of the initial drug choice should be used. The optimal formulation should provide 24-hour efficacy with a once-daily dose, because compliance is better and control of hypertension is persistent and smooth.", 
    "4": "Nitric oxide (NO) plays the key role in the non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) nerve-mediated relaxation of prostate. We tried to determine whether nitrinergic innervation of the prostate is reduced with aging, and whether a reduction of this innervation alters the relaxant properties of prostatic tissue.", 
    "5": "The prostate isolated from young rabbits at the age of 3 months and aged rabbits at the age of 24 months was used. Pharmacologic experiments using electrical field stimulation (EFS) were performed on strips of prostate. Nitrinergic nerves were identified histochemically by the presence of NADPH diaphorase reactivity.", 
    "6": "The prostate weighed 0.34 +/- 0.06 g in the young and 0.78 +/- 0.13 g in the aged (P < 0.01). Electrical stimulation caused frequency-dependent relaxation that was inhibited by N-nitro-L-arginine and increased by L-arginine. Maximum relaxant rates of noradrenaline-induced tone were 41.3 +/- 1.8% and 22.7 +/- 0.6% in the young and the aged (P < 0.01), respectively. Exogenous NO caused concentration-dependent relaxation of the prostate. Both relaxation induced by electrical stimulation and exogenous NO were inhibited by LY83583 (a guanylate cyclase inhibitor). In all specimens, NADPH diaphorase activity was observed in the smooth muscle layer of the prostatic stroma and capsule. However, NADPH diaphorase positive nerves were significantly less in the aged than in the young (P < 0.01).", 
    "7": "As a result of these findings, it is suggested that both NO-mediated relaxation and nitrinergic innervation are reduced with aging in this animal model.", 
    "8": "There is good evidence for the use of antiplatelet, beta-blocker and lipid-lowering drugs in the treatment of ischaemic heart disease, but few data on how these medications are used in treating stable angina pectoris. We examined prescription profiles for a sample of patients aged > or =65 years with stable angina, to compare the profiles to local guidelines and to explore the determinants of these profiles, in a cross-sectional study. We identified 11 141 individuals from the Quebec provincial out-patient pharmaceutical database for the period 1 June 1996 to 31 May 1997, and examined the percentage of these patients with and without associated co-morbidities receiving antiplatelet, beta-blocker and lipid-lowering medications. We used hierarchical modelling to examine the role of patient and physician characteristics in explaining the variation in the use of these medications. Calcium-channel blockers were the class of anti-ischaemic drugs most prescribed (63%). Beta-blockers were prescribed in 52.1% of patients. Antiplatelet and lipid-lowering drugs were prescribed to 56.8% and 32.6%, respectively. Increasing age and female gender made patients less likely to be prescribed these treatments. General practitioners were less likely than cardiologists to prescribe beta-blockers and lipid-lowering drugs (OR 0.79, CI 95% 0.68-0.91 and OR 0.77, CI 95% 0.66-0.91, respectively). There is a general under-use of antiplatelet, beta-blocker and lipid-lowering medications in the treatment of stable angina pectoris patients, possibly leading to adverse patient outcomes.", 
    "9": "Carvedilol, an antihypertensive agent, has been in clinical use for several years. In addition to its function as a beta-blocker, carvedilol has been shown to act as an antioxidant. However, there is some controversy as to how carvedilol achieves its antioxidative ability: by radical scavenging or ion chelation? We therefore used a method of radical generation independent of metal ions to investigate the antioxidative properties of carvedilol. We showed that carvedilol decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation induced by a peroxyl radical-generating system [2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride]. Formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, lipid hydroperoxides, and newly generated epitopes on oxidised LDL was used to monitor LDL oxidation. We further showed that carvedilol was consumed during reaction with peroxyl radicals. However, carvedilol showed no reaction with nitrogen-centered radicals (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulphonate]), which are often used in assays for determining antioxidative properties. On the other hand, we found that carvedilol acted as a chelator of ferric ions. Using mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, we observed complex formation with free and acetylacetonate-complexed ferric ions. The binding constant with Fe(3+) was in the range of 10(5) L/mol. From our data, we concluded that carvedilol acts as both a metal chelator and a radical scavenger in vitro. However, it is selective in reacting with different radicals and is not an electron-donating radical scavenger as is alpha-tocopherol. Therefore, taking into account the low physiological concentration, the antioxidative properties reported earlier may not solely be explained by its radical-scavenging activity.", 
    "10": "Nicotine modulates excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the hippocampus by acting on receptors located on various cellular compartments. We report that nicotine, applied for 5-10 min at concentrations similar to those found during smoking (0.5-5 M), resulted in all CA1 pyramidal neurones in a marked, phasic and tonic increase in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory currents. This effect was fully prevented by pre-incubation with the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin and was partially inhibited by the two nicotinic receptor antagonists methyllicaconitine (MLA) and dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE). We conclude that, under conditions found during smoking, nicotine enhances inhibitory transmission, an effect exclusively mediated through an enhancement of the firing rate of interneurones, without changes in spontaneous quantal release of GABA.", 
    "11": "An enquiry was undertaken amongst 71 cardiologists in 1999 evaluating 600 ambulatory patients with cardiac failure (64% men; mean age 73 years; NYHA Class I: 9%, Class II: 52%, Class III: 33%, Class IV: 6%). Cardiac failure is commoner in men (81%) before the age of 70. After the age of 80, the tendency is inversed (53% of women). Fifty-two per cent of patients had a history of hospital admission for cardiac failure: 26% in the year before the enquiry (on average 13.1 days' hospital stay). On inclusion, the diagnosis was made 4.2 +/- 4.6 years previously and the patients had been followed up for an average of 3.04 +/- 3.3 years. The diagnosis of cardiac failure was made by the cardiologist (57%), the general practitioner (37%), or another category of physician (6%). Eight per cent of patients were treated with a single drug before inclusion, 22% had a bi-therapy and 70% a polytherapy. The most frequently prescribed drugs were: diuretics (71%), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (54%) and digitalis (35%). The prescription of betablockers was only reported in 14% of the population. In the over-80's, only 45% of patients were prescribed ACE inhibitors. These results confirm that ambulatory patients with cardiac failure are mainly in NYHA Classes II and III, that the pathology concerns elderly patients and that it is the cause of recurrent hospital admission. The prescription of diuretics is the main therapy in all NYHA Classes. ACE inhibitors were only prescribed in 2/3 of patients and in less than half of patients over 80 years of age. The prescription of betablockers remains marginal. The reason for the underprescription of recommended drugs (International Recommendations) would justify further investigation.", 
    "12": "Patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery and who have coronary artery disease run a high risk of myocardial infarct. Diagnosis and postoperative management is presently based on assessment of cardiac troponin I. Associated with optimal postoperatory management, several approaches can limit the occurrence of postoperatory coronary complications and improve the life expectancy of surgical patients with high cardiovascular risk. They include the possibility of preoperatory myocardial revascularisation and the prophylactic, postoperatory administration of cardiovascular medications (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers and alpha 2 receptor agonists).", 
    "13": "The frizzled receptors, which mediate development and display seven hydrophobic, membrane-spanning segments, are cell membrane-localized. We constructed a chimeric receptor with the ligand-binding and transmembrane segments from the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) and the cytoplasmic domains from rat Frizzled-1 (Rfz1). Stimulation of mouse F9 clones expressing the chimera (beta2AR-Rfz1) with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol stimulated stabilization of beta-catenin, activation of a beta-catenin-sensitive promoter, and formation of primitive endoderm. The response was blocked by inactivation of pertussis toxin-sensitive, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and by depletion of Galphaq and Galphao. Thus, G proteins are elements of Wnt/Frizzled-1 signaling to the beta-catenin-lymphoid-enhancer factor (LEF)-T cell factor (Tcf) pathway.", 
    "14": "Hitherto, none of the existing in vitro methods has been convincingly demonstrated to be suitable as a replacement for the Draize rabbit eye irritation test. We examine the hypothesis that one reason for this is that insufficient consideration has been given to the differences in the effective concentrations at which chemicals operate in vitro and in vivo. When a chemical is applied topically to the eye, the strength of the observed irritation that it elicits depends both on its toxic potential toward cells or tissues, and its effective concentration in the tissues of the eye. Most of the existing in vitro methods are based on isolated cells or tissues, and thus may be useful in assessing the cytotoxic potentials of chemicals. However, a reliable approach to assessing the effective concentrations of chemicals within the various tissues of the eye is lacking. A simplified compartment model is presented for calculating the time-dependent, intra-ocular concentration profiles of topically applied chemicals. The model encompasses the outer surface of the eye, three distinct segments of the cornea (subdivided into the epithelium, stroma and endothelium) and the conjunctiva. Transport through the membranes of these compartments is described as passive diffusion. For the transport coefficients, rate equations are established that contain, as free parameters, the molecular size and the partition coefficient of the chemical, as well as some intrinsic membrane parameters, such as thickness, viscosity and pore density. Numerical values for the unknown membrane parameters were estimated by fitting the theoretical rate equations to measured permeability coefficients. The compartment model was applied to an independent set of 52 test chemicals compiled from the European Commission/UK Home Office validation study. The calculated passage times (required to let 95% of the chemical reach the posterior eye tissues) varied between 0.33 minutes and 50.6 minutes, and are generally much shorter than the typical duration of observed impairments in the cornea or conjunctiva. This finding suggests that short-term contacts of the eye tissues with a chemical are sufficient to elicit long-term eye irritation. An example is given, showing how the conventional approach of using in vitro endpoints as predictors of eye irritation can be improved significantly by incorporating into the prediction the calculated intra-ocular concentration of a chemical.",

There were a total of 449 deaths in the placebo group (33 percent) and 411 deaths in the bucindolol group (30 percent; adjusted P=0.13). The risk of the secondary end point of death from cardiovascular causes was lower in the bucindolol group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.99), as was the risk of heart transplantation or death (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.99).",

In a double-blind fashion, we randomly assigned 1133 patients to placebo and 1156 patients to treatment with carvedilol for a mean period of 10.4 months, during which standard therapy for heart failure was continued. Patients who required intensive care, had marked fluid retention, or were receiving intravenous vasodilators or positive inotropic drugs were excluded.",

A total of 507 patients died or were hospitalized in the placebo group, as compared with 425 in the carvedilol group. This difference reflected a 24 percent decrease in the combined risk of death or hospitalization with carvedilol (95 percent confidence interval, 13 to 33 percent; P<0.001). The favorable effects on both end points were seen consistently in all the subgroups we examined, including patients with a history of recent or recurrent cardiac decompensation.

    "23": "Therapy involving the use of anti-GPIIb-IIIa inhibitors has progressively evolved in recent years for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or with acute coronary syndromes. Patients receiving anti-GP IIb-IIIa therapy have a lower risk of death or myocardial infarction than those receiving the classic anti-agregant, aspirin, alone. Two classes of products have been used in clinic, the chimeric monoclonal antibody Fab fragment, c7E3 or abciximab (ReoPro), which has been the pioneer, and synthetic peptides or peptidomimetics such as eptifibatide (Integrilin) or tirofiban (Agrastat). Abciximab is a long-acting, high-affinity receptor blocker, whereas eptifibatide and tirofiban have much shorter biological half-lives. Another property that differentiates these compounds is that the peptides bind exclusively to GP IIb-IIIa whereas c7E3 also binds to alpha v beta 3, the vitronectin receptor. The potent inhibitory effect of these compounds increases the risk of bleeding. By carefully controlling the levels of heparin and by removing the sheath as early as possible, the hemorrhagic problems may be limited. Another potential complication is the rapid development of thrombocytopenia. The cause has yet to be found and for c7E3 no correlation with the development of HACA (human anti-chimeric antibodies) has been observed. Because of the chronic nature of coronary artery disease, evaluation of the readministration of c7E3 to the same patient two or even more times is under investigation. The first results do not show major problems. The best biological way to investigate the efficiency of anti-GPIIb-IIIa has to be determined. Interestingly, a new point-of-care test has been proposed, while monoclonal antibodies are available that differentiate between nonoccupied and occupied GPIIb-IIIa complexes.",

There was a statistical difference between groups (P <.005). When groups were compared by pairs, three times daily dosing with brimonidine and timolol maleate both reduced the pressure more than twice daily brimonidine at every time point past 10:00 hours and for the diurnal curve (P <.05). In contrast, three times daily brimonidine and timolol maleate were statistically similar for the diurnal pressure, and each time point, except timolol maleate, decreased the pressure more at 16:00 (P =.042). Safety was similar between groups.", 
    "27": "This study demonstrated that both timolol maleate twice daily and brimonidine three times daily provide a similar intraocular pressure reduction to each other.

    "29": "We report the case of a 42-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital after an acute hypertensive crisis despite four-way anti-hypertensive therapy. The renal scintigraphy, the excretory urogram and the biochemical profile performed two years before were unremarkable, except for slightly elevated serum creatinine and plasma aldosterone, in presence of normal aldosterone/renin ratio. The renal arterial angiography that was performed despite a second unremarkable scintigraphy revealed high-grade bilateral arterial stenosis in the presence of multiple renal arteries. Following dilatation of the left stenosis, the aldosterone/renin ratio was pathologic. Recumbent and orthostatic aldosterone values were 830 pg/ml and 1824 pg/ml, respectively, and recumbent and orthostatic renin values were 0.82 and 1.21 ng angiotensin I/ml/h, respectively. The abdominal computed tomography performed to investigate a possible concomitant Conn's syndrome resulted in the detection of a left adrenal tumor. After resection of the lesion, plasma-aldosterone levels normalized and a pronounced rise in serum potassium levels was observed. Following angioplasty of the right renal artery stenosis, blood pressure could easily be managed with combined beta and calcium channel blocker therapy. Particularly in cases of bilateral (but also in the presence of unilateral) renal artery stenosis in association with Conn's syndrome, all the available screening methods for these disorders can fail. In cases of poor response to combination hypertensive therapies, renal arteriography and a fludrocortisone-suppression test should be performed in order to rule out both renal arterial stenosis and Conn's syndrome, even in the absence of clinical and biochemical findings suspicious for either disorder.",

Drugs were infused directly into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Direct application of flesinoxan (25.0 and/or 50.0 ng) into the DRN induced a significant increment of REM sleep (REMS) during the second and third 2 h period of recording. On the other hand, microinjection into the DRN of (+/-)pindolol (100.0 and/or 200.0 ng), and WAY 100635 (12.5, 25.0 and 50.0 ng) significantly reduced REMS during the first and/or second 2 h recording period. Our findings support previous studies indicating that microdialysis perfusion of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OHDPAT into the DRN increases REMS. In addition, they favor the proposal that microinjection of 5-HT1A receptor antagonists into the DRN would suppress 5-HT inhibition and reduce REMS.",

The effects of the buffer (concentration and pH), the injection time, the voltage applied and the plasma clean-up procedure were studied. The determination of atenolol was achieved in less than 3 min, using an electrolyte of 50 mM H3BO3-50 mM Na2B4O7 (50:50, v/v) pH 9, injected hydrodynamically for 4 s at 50 mbar and applying a voltage of +25 kV.

    "40": "The plasma concentration-time profiles following oral administration of drugs are often irregular and cannot be interpreted easily with conventional models based on first- or zero-order absorption kinetics and lag time. Six new models were developed using a time-dependent absorption rate coefficient, ka(t), wherein the time dependency was varied to account for the dynamic processes such as changes in fluid absorption or secretion, in absorption surface area, and in motility with time, in the gastrointestinal tract. In the present study, the plasma concentration profiles of propranolol obtained in human subjects following oral dosing were analyzed using the newly derived models based on mass balance and compared with the conventional models. Nonlinear regression analysis indicated that the conventional compartment model including lag time (CLAG model) could not predict the rapid initial increase in plasma concentration after dosing and the predicted Cmax values were much lower than that observed. On the other hand, all models with the time-dependent absorption rate coefficient, ka(t), were superior to the CLAG model in predicting plasma concentration profiles. Based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), the fluid absorption model without lag time (FA model) exhibited the best overall fit to the data. The two-phase model including lag time, TPLAG model was also found to be a good model judging from the values of sum of squares. This model also described the irregular profiles of plasma concentration with time and frequently predicted Cmax values satisfactorily. A comparison of the absorption rate profiles also suggested that the TPLAG model is better at prediction of irregular absorption kinetics than the FA model. In conclusion, the incorporation of a time-dependent absorption rate coefficient ka(t) allows the prediction of nonlinear absorption characteristics in a more reliable manner.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the direct effect on endothelium- dependent vasodilation (EDV) of different pharmacological drugs commonly used in the treatment of these conditions. 2. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured in 37 young healthy normotensive subjects with venous occlusion plethysmography during local intra-arterial infusions of methacholine (MCh; 2-4 microg/min), evaluating EDV, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 5-10 microg/min), evaluating endothelium-independent vasodilation (EIDV). The measurements of EDV and EIDV were undertaken under baseline conditions and were repeated after 1 h intra-arterial infusion of digoxin (0.1 mg/h), furosemide (5.0 mg/h), enalaprilat (2,4 mg/h), metoprolol (1.2 mg/h) or saline (controls). 3.

When the endothelial function index was calculated as the MCh: SNP FBF ratio, a significant improvement was seen only with enalaprilat (1.1+/-0.1 to 1.2+/-0.1; P < 0.01) and furosemide (1.0+/-0.1 to 1.3+/-0.4; P < 0.05). 4. In conlusion, the results of the present study show that enalaprilat and furosemide improve endothelial vasodilatory function, while no major effect was induced by digoxin or metoprolol. Thus, different direct effects on the endothelium in young normotensive subjects were induced by drugs commonly used in the treatment of hypertension or CHF.", 
    "42": "Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses are the gold standard in endpoint analyses of randomized clinical trials. Valuable information, however, may be lost in this approach as the actual time on trial medication is not accounted for in patients who withdraw early. Since compliance per se can be a prognostic factor and the actual treatment time is a variable likely to influence clinical outcome, this information should be added to an ITT analysis concept. Thus, the aim is to elucidate the influence of actual treatment time on the results of ITT analysis using available data from a well-conducted, large-scale clinical trial.", 
    "43": "The ANZ trial, a carvedilol study in heart failure, is characterized by a considerable number of early withdrawals in the carvedilol group. Using the ANZ trial database, the percentage of withdrawals was calculated as well as the number of days on treatment. Fourteen out of 21 deaths (67%) in the carvedilol group occurred after discontinuation of carvedilol. At the time of death, 14 out of 29 (48%) patients in the placebo group had withdrawn from treatment. Mean time of patients on medication who withdrew and died later were 301 days for placebo, but only 204 days for carvedilol. We performed a conventional ITT analysis, and an ITT-based Cox-proportional hazards model (modified ITT) in which the actual time on trial medication was entered into the model as an explanatory variable. The risk ratio in conventional ITT analysis was 0.71 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 1.24, p = 0.228) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.28-0.90, p < 0.001 ) in modified ITT analysis.", 
    "44": "Incorporation of the actual treatment time substantially influences the result of this exemplary ITT analysis. The resulting risk ratio is clearly in accordance with clinical implications and in close agreement with those of other beta-blocker trials in heart failure. Entering the actual treatment time into a Cox-proportional hazards model as an explanatory variable is reasonable if not necessary from a clinical point of view and thus may strengthen the validity of ITT analysis.",

Patients with at least a 6-month history of asthma whose symptoms were controlled on CFC-BDP, 400 to 1600 microg daily, during a 2-week run-in period were randomized in a 1:3 ratio to CFC-BDP at the same daily dose or HFA-BDP at approximately half the daily dose of CFC-BDP for 12 months.", 
    "48": "A total of 473 patients were randomized: 354 to HFA-BDP, 119 to CFC-BDP. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in mean change from baseline in morning (AM) peak expiratory flow rate or forced expiratory volume in one second throughout the study. There were no consistent differences between treatment groups in individual asthma symptoms or daily beta2-agonist use during the study. There was an increase in the percentage of symptom-free days between baseline and month 12 in the HFA-BDP group (11.5%) and the CFC-BDP group (4.6%).

HFA-BDP demonstrated a similar safety profile to CFC-BDP; there were no differences between the agents with regard to systemic effects.", 
    "50": "The development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) provided a major advancement in the treatment of depression. However, these drugs suffer from a variety of drawbacks, most notably a delay in the onset of efficacy. One hypothesis suggests that this delay in efficacy is due to a paradoxical decrease in serotonergic (5-HT) neuronal impulse flow and release, following activation of inhibitory presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, following acute administration of SSRIs. According to the hypothesis, efficacy is seen only when this impulse flow is restored following desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors and coincident increases in postsynaptic 5-HT levels are achieved. Clinical proof of this principal has been suggested in studies that found a significant augmenting effect when the beta-adrenergic/5-HT1A receptor antagonist, pindolol, was coadministered with SSRI treatment. In this article, we review preclinical electrophysiological and microdialysis studies that have examined this desensitization hypothesis. We further discuss clinical studies that utilized pindolol as a test of this hypothesis in depressed patients and examine preclinical studies that challenge the notion that the beneficial effect of pindolol is due to functional antagonism of the 5-HT1A autoreceptors.", 
    "51": "This study was designed to clarify the percutaneous penetration of bupranolol (BP), a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, through rabbit skin and to compare the in vitro penetration with the in vivo absorption. BP penetrated across the skin slowly in the absence of enhancers in vitro. Isopropyl myristate and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone enhanced the in vitro penetration, with a 3.6 times higher flux compared with that without enhancers. However, in the in vivo percutaneous absorption, the maximal penetration was obtained with the formulation added dlimonene, with a 3.0 times higher area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) than that for the formulation without enhancers. The plasma levels of BP determined, however, were extremely lower than the theoretical plasma steady-state concentrations predicted. The plasma levels of BP after application of these formulations were maintained in the range of 7-22 ng/ml for 30 h, of which concentrations were above the therapeutically effective concentration (1.5-4 ng/ml). Therefore, the transdermal systems will offer an efficient drug delivery system for the treatment of angina pectoris and tachycardia.", 
    "52": "The effect of adrenoceptor blockers on nicotine induced hyperglycemia were studied in fasted normal and thyroidectomised rats. Blood glucose was estimated using the modified glucose oxidase method. The control experiments consisted of sham operated rats with intact thyroid glands. Pre-treatment of the rats with either the alpha adrenoceptor blocker prazosin or the beta adrenoceptor blocker propranolol before intravenous injection of nicotine (50 micrograms/kg) significantly reduced the hyperglycemia induced by nicotine in normal rats, while a combination of propranolol and prazosin abolished nicotine induced hyperglycemia. In the thyroidectomised group, nicotine also caused hyperglycemia. However, the basal glucose level and peak of glycemic response were lowered compared to that in the control group. The results therefore seem to suggest that both alpha and beta adrenoceptors are involved in nicotine-induced hyperglycemia in the rat.",

The thiourea diastereomers formed were analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, mixtures of water and methanol or acetonitrile being used for elution. Conditions of derivatizations (temperature, reagent excess and reaction time) were optimized. The effects of organic modifiers on the retention and separation were investigated; the diastereomers could readily be baseline-separated with methanol-containing mobile phases. The reagent allowed the detection of all four stereoisomers of labetalol, which has two chiral centres.", 
    "54": "Signal transduction pathways regulate the transmission of specific signals to the cells from the surface to the nucleus. Activation of protein kinases such as JNKs (c-jun amino-terminal kinase), a subgroup of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, results in regulation of important cellular functions like cell growth and differentiation. The involvement of estrogens in stimulation of growth of already transformed breast cancer cells in vivo and in vitro accompanied with activation of JNKs prompted us to investigate the role of synthetic estrogens in the regulation of JNK expression. T 47D breast cancer cells were incubated with the synthetic estrogens, ethinylestradiol (10(-9)M) and 17 beta-estradiol valerate (10(-9)M), epidermal growth factor (EGF) (10 ng/ml) and the natural estrogen, 17 beta-estradiol (10(-9)M), for 5 minutes. The same experiments were repeated after pretreatment of the cells with ICI 182780 for 24 hours. EGF as well as natural and synthetic estrogens stimulated proliferation. This effect was reversed by the estrogen receptor blocker ICI 182780, but only in the case of both natural and synthetic estrogen. Like 17 beta-estradiol, synthetic estrogens induced a rapid and transient activation of JNK kinase. ICI 182780 blocked this effect, but not that mediated by EGF. Ethinylestradiol used in oral contraceptives, and 17 beta-estradiol and 17 beta-estradiol valerate for hormone replacement therapy, are able to activate JNK. The estrogen receptor is necessary for JNK activation upon estrogen stimulation.", 
    "55": "Depression, among other non-cognitive symptoms, is common in patients with dementia. The effect of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort) extract, with well-documented antidepressant activity, was tested on memory retrieval 24 h after training on a one-trial passive avoidance task in mice. Acute administration of Hypericum extract (4.0, 8.0, 12.0, and 25.0 mg/kg i.p.) before retrieval testing increased the step-down latency during the test session. The same doses of Hypericum extract, on the other hand, failed to reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia of a two-trial passive avoidance task. The involvement of serotonergic, adrenergic, and dopaminergic mechanisms in the facilitatory effect of Hypericum extract on retrieval memory was investigated. Pretreatment of the animals with serotonergic 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (-)-pindolol (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg), serotonergic 5-HT2A receptor blocker spiperone (0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg), alpha adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg), beta receptor antagonist propranolol (5, 7.5, and 10 mg/kg), dopaminergic D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg), and dopaminergic D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride (5, 7.5, and 10 mg/kg) revealed the involvement of adrenergic and serotonergic 5-HT1A receptors in the facilitatory effect of Hypericum extract on retrieval memory. It is concluded that Hypericum extract may be a better alternative for treatment of depression commonly associated with dementia than other antidepressants known to have anticholinergic side effects causing delirium, sedation and even exacerbating already existing impaired cognition. In dementias of old age, Hypericum perforatum would, therefore, serve as one medication targeting both depression and amnesia with lower potential side effects.", 
    "56": "This is a synopsis of presentations made at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) in 2001 summarising recent research developments relating to heart failure. Clinical studies of particular interest to physicians with an interest in heart failure and its prevention are reviewed. The COPERNICUS trial lends further support to the use of the beta-blocker, carvedilol, in severe heart failure and the CAPRICORN trial to its use in patients with post-infarction left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The MIRACLE study reinforces the evidence from three smaller trials that cardiac resynchronisation therapy is an effective treatment for the relief of symptoms in patients with severe heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony. The STAF trial casts further doubt on the wisdom of cardioversion as a routine strategy for the management of chronic atrial fibrillation. The RITZ-2 trial suggests that an intravenous, non-selective endothelin antagonist is effective in improving haemodynamics and symptoms and possibly in reducing morbidity in severe heart failure. Observational studies in heart failure suggest that a moderate excess of body fat and elevated blood cholesterol may be desirable in patients with heart failure, challenging the current non-evidenced-based vogue for cholesterol lowering therapy in heart failure. The RENAISSANCE and RECOVER outcome studies of etanercept, a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor analogue that blocks the effect of TNF, were stopped because of lack of evidence of benefit shortly after the ACC.", 
    "57": "Beta-blockers without partial agonist activity are now considered to be strategic therapy for patients with chronic heart failure, but many issues remain to be clarified. The objective of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cardiac insufficiency talinolol study (CITAS) is to assess efficacy and safety of talinolol - a selective beta-1 adrenoreceptor blocker - in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure. The primary end-point refers to the influence of talinolol on exercise capacity, evaluated by 6-min walking-test. Secondary end-points consist of left ventricular function, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, hospitalizations, quality of life, combined clinical end-points and adverse events. There were enrolled 294 patients with stable heart failure in NYHA class II-IV, LVEF <40%, receiving diuretics, ACE-inhibitors and optionally nitrates and digoxin. Talinolol was titrated up to 100 mg/day (one arm) or to 150 mg/d (the other arm), starting with 12.5 mg daily. Enrollment began in November 1997 and the last visit will be in December 2000.",

Differences in patient survival rates were calculated for bisoprolol (n=1327) and placebo groups (n=1320) extrapolating data over a 5-year period, under limited and extended benefits scenarios to calculate life years gained (LYG). Hospitalisation rates were calculated using data from both CIBIS trials. Costs were considered under two different patient management protocols for treatment initiation - shared care by outpatient clinics and GPs and initiation by a nurse working in the community. Discounted LYG were calculated to be 0.228 under the limited benefits scenario and 0.368 under the extended benefits scenario. Under the extended benefits scenario shared care resulted in a cost of pound268 per LYG or pound412 per LYG for community initiation. Under the limited benefits scenario the costs were a pound135 saving and pound69, respectively.",

    "61": "Heart failure is a common condition that carries a high burden of mortality and morbidity. Several randomised trials have evaluated the effects of beta blockers in heart failure. This paper gives a systematic overview of published randomised trials of beta blockers in heart failure using standard methods. In all, 22 randomised controlled trials were identified with a total of 10480 patients, and an average of 11 months of treatment. The average age was 61 years and 4% were female. Most studies excluded patients with severe heart failure. Death rates in patients randomised to receive beta blockers compared to controls were 458/5657 (8.0%) and 635/4951 (12.8%) respectively, odds ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.55-0.72, P<0.00001. Similar reductions were observed for hospital admissions for worsening heart failure (11.3 vs. 17.1%, respectively, odds ratio 0.63) and for the composite outcome of death or heart-failure hospital admission (19.4 vs. 26.9%, respectively, odds ratio 0.66). These results show that beta blockers reduce the risk of mortality or the need for heart-failure hospital admission by approximately one third. Absolute reductions of 5-6% in event rates were observed over approximately 1 year of treatment period. These important benefits should be implemented as a priority, since treatment with beta blockers is inexpensive and heart failure carries a high risk of death and disability. Further information on the effect of beta blockers in elderly patients and women would be helpful.",

    "64": "We investigated the effects of single oral doses of clinically recommended amounts of metoprolol (50, 100 and 200 mg) and carvedilol (25, 50 and 100 mg) to those of a placebo in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over study in 12 healthy male volunteers. Two hours after oral administration of the drugs heart rate and blood pressure were measured at rest, after 10 min of exercise, and after 15 min of recovery.", 
    "65": "Metoprolol tended to decrease heart rate during exercise (-21%, -25% and -24%) to a greater extent than carvedilol (-16%, -16% and -18%). At rest, increasing doses of metoprolol caused decreasing heart rates (62, 60 and 58 beats/min) whereas increasing doses of carvedilol caused increasing heart rates (62, 66 and 69 beats/min), 50 and 100 mg carvedilol failed to differ significantly from the placebo (71 beats/min).", 
    "66": "We conclude that clinically recommended doses of carvedilol cause a clinically relevant beta-blockade in humans predominantly during exercise where it appears to be slightly (although not significantly) less effective than metoprolol. On the other hand, the effects of carvedilol on heart rate at rest appear rather weak, particularly in subjects with a low sympathetic tone. This might be caused by a reflex increase on sympathetic drive secondary to peripheral vasodilation resulting from the alpha-blocking effects of the drug. These results might be helpful in explaining why carvedilol, in contrast to metoprolol, may fail to cause up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor density and does not decrease nocturnal melatonin release. This, in turn, may be a reason for the weak side-effects of carvedilol resulting from the beta-blockade. In addition, our data might be of interest in the interpretation of the forthcoming results of the COMET trial, although it has to be emphasised that they were derived from healthy subjects and, therefore, cannot be directly extrapolated to patients with heart failure.",

Exercise tests with VO2 measurement were performed before and after a 4-week exercise training program. Patients with carvedilol experienced a 16.6% increase in peak VO2 which was similar to the 13.9% increase in the group with cardioselective beta-blocker and to the 18.5% in the group without beta-blocker.

Department of Ophthalmology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. This prospective randomized study comprised 60 eyes of 30 patients scheduled for small incision cataract surgery in both eyes. The patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 drop of a fixed dorzolamide-timolol combination or latanoprost immediately after cataract surgery in the first eye. The second eye received the other antiglaucomatous agent. Cataract surgery was performed under sodium hyaluronate 1% with a temporal 3.5 mm sutureless posterior limbal incision, phacoemulsification, and implantation of a foldable intraocular lens. The IOP was measured preoperatively as well as 6 and 20 to 24 hours and 1 week postoperatively. Six hours after surgery, the mean IOP decreased by -0.8 mm Hg +/- 3.2 (SD) (P =.184) in the dorzolamide-timolol group and increased by 3.6 mm Hg +/- 3.5 (P <.001) in the latanoprost group. Twenty to 24 hours after surgery, the mean IOP decreased by -2.8 +/- 2.4 mm Hg (P <.001) in the dorzolamide-timolol group and increased by 0.6 +/- 3.5 mm Hg (P =.353) in the latanoprost group. The differences between groups were significant at 6 hours (P <.001) and 20 to 24 hours (P <.001). The fixed dorzolamide-timolol combination was more effective than latanoprost in reducing IOP after small incision cataract surgery. Only the fixed dorzolamide-timolol combination prevented a postoperative IOP increase and occasional IOP spikes of 30 mm Hg or higher.", 
    "71": "Adenylate cyclase activity in NS20Y cells expressing D2L dopamine receptors was examined following chronic treatment with norepinephrine and epinephrine. Initial acute experiments revealed that both norepinephrine and epinephrine inhibited forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation via D2 receptors. Furthermore, chronic 18 h activation of D2 dopamine receptors by norepinephrine or epinephrine induced a marked increase (>10-fold) in subsequent forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. This heterologous sensitization of adenylate cyclase activity was blocked by D2 dopamine receptor antagonists and by pertussis toxin pretreatment.

BNP correlated strongly with LVEDD, LVEF, and LV mass index in carvedilol-treated patients. The degree of change in BNP correlated with that in LVEDD or LVEF 6 months after carvedilol. All 14 patients with decreased or unchanged BNP levels showed an increase in LVEF, and 4 of 7 with a rise in BNP had decreased or unchanged LVEF.

    "79": "The movements of transmembrane segments (TMs) 3 and 6 at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane play an important role in the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors. Here we provide evidence for the existence of an ionic lock that constrains the relative mobility of the cytoplasmic ends of TM3 and TM6 in the inactive state of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor. We propose that the highly conserved Arg-131(3.50) at the cytoplasmic end of TM3 interacts both with the adjacent Asp-130(3.49) and with Glu-268(6.30) at the cytoplasmic end of TM6. Such a network of ionic interactions has now been directly supported by the high-resolution structure of the inactive state of rhodopsin. We hypothesized that the network of interactions would serve to constrain the receptor in the inactive state, and the release of this ionic lock could be a key step in receptor activation. To test this hypothesis, we made charge-neutralizing mutations of Glu-268(6.30) and of Asp-130(3.49) in the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor. Alone and in combination, we observed a significant increase in basal and pindolol-stimulated cAMP accumulation in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the mutant receptors. Moreover, based on the increased accessibility of Cys-285(6.47) in TM6, we provide evidence for a conformational rearrangement of TM6 that is highly correlated with the extent of constitutive activity of the different mutants. The present experimental data together with the recent high-resolution structure of rhodopsin suggest that ionic interactions between Asp/Glu(3.49), Arg(3.50), and Glu(6.30) may constitute a common switch governing the activation of many rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors.", 
    "80": "IV adrenaline increases coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We recently showed that endotracheal adrenaline can decrease blood pressure (BP), a detrimental effect presumably mediated by the beta 2-adrenergic receptor unopposed by alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction. This prospective, randomized, laboratory comparison of endotracheal adrenaline (0.05 mg/kg diluted with normal saline to 10 mL total volume) with or without nonselective beta-blocker (propranolol) pretreatment was conducted in an attempt to clarify the mechanism of this BP decrease. Five mongrel dogs were given 0.05 mg/kg endotracheal adrenaline (diluted) or 0.05 mg/kg endotracheal adrenaline followed by an IV propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) pretreatment. Each dog served as its own control (10 mL of normal saline administered endotracheally) and received each regimen at least one week apart. Endotracheal adrenaline given after the propranolol pretreatment produced an increase in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial BPs, from 165/110 mm Hg (mean 128 mm Hg) to 177.5/125 mm Hg (mean 142.5 mm Hg), respectively, as opposed to the hypotensive effect of isolated endotracheal adrenaline (P < 0.03). Thus, endotracheal adrenaline was associated with predominantly beta-adrenergic-mediated effects, causing hypotension via peripheral vasodilatation unopposed by alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction. The search for the optimal dose of endotracheal adrenaline should be aimed at achieving the higher alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictive threshold.", 
    "81": "The effects of alpha-adrenergic receptor (alpha-AR) stimulation alone and the effects in the presence of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulation were examined on L-type Ca(2+) currents (I(Ca-L)) in the absence and presence of hypoxia. The alpha-AR agonist methoxamine either had no effect or had a slight inhibitory effect on basal I(Ca-L) in the absence and presence of hypoxia. Hypoxia significantly decreased the K(0.5) for activation of I(Ca-L) by norepinephrine from 79.8+/-6.6 to 13.3+/-0.7 nmol/L. To determine whether hypoxia specifically altered the sensitivity of the channel to alpha-AR stimulation, cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of methoxamine in the presence of 100 nmol/L isoproterenol (Iso). In the absence of hypoxia, methoxamine inhibited the Iso-activated I(Ca-L) in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC(50) of 86.9+/-9.9 micromol/L. However, in the presence of hypoxia, the EC(50) for inhibition of I(Ca-L) by methoxamine was significantly increased to 266.7+/-10.8 micromol/L. Methoxamine had little effect on I(Ca-L) activated by forskolin or histamine in the absence or presence of hypoxia. In addition, inhibition of protein kinase C by bisindolylmaleimide 1 or protein kinase C beta peptide inhibitor had no effect on the methoxamine-induced antagonism of I(Ca-L) in the absence or presence of hypoxia. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein attenuated the methoxamine response in nonhypoxic cells only. However, during hypoxia it was attenuated with the phospholipase A(2) inhibitors mepacrine and indomethacin. These findings represent a novel regulation of the L-type Ca(2+) channel by the phospholipase A(2) pathway and illustrate the complexity of regulation of the channel under hypoxic conditions.", 
    "82": "Somatostatin hyperpolarized rat pancreatic alpha-cells and inhibited spontaneous electrical activity by activating a low-conductance K+ channel (0.9 pS with physiological ionic gradients). This channel was insensitive to tolbutamide (a blocker of ATP-sensitive K+ channels) and apamin (an inhibitor of small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels). Channel activation was prevented by pre-treating the cells with pertussis toxin, indicating the involvement of G-proteins. A direct interaction between an inhibitory G-protein and the somatostatin-activated K+ channel is suggested by the finding that intracellular application of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma-S) and the G beta gamma subunit of G-proteins resulted in a transient stimulation of the current. Activation of the K+ current by somatostatin was inhibited by intracellular dialysis with specific antibodies to Gi1/2 and was not seen in cells treated with antisense oligonucleotides against G-proteins of the subtype Gi2. We conclude that somatostatin suppresses alpha-cell electrical activity by a Gi2-protein-dependent mechanism, which culminates in the activation of a sulphonylurea- and apamin-insensitive low-conductance K+ channel.", 
    "83": "The general pharmacotherapeutic issues surrounding AMI are complex and expanding, especially with regard to treatment aimed at the [table: see text] culprit, coronary atherosclerotic thrombus. Basic, well-established therapy includes the routine administration of oxygen, nitroglycerin, aspirin, and at times morphine, with selected cases invoking caution with respect to these agents (e.g., nitroglycerin and the risk of hypotension in right ventricular infarction; contraindication to nitrolycerin in patients on sildenafil). Cardioprotective agents, especially beta-adrenergic antagonists, should be considered early in light of their demonstrated benefit; others, such as ACE inhibitors, need not be administered in the ED. Heparin, both UFH and the newer LMWHs, have well-established roles in acute coronary syndromes. The GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are the most recent addition to the pharmacologic armamentarium; their role is evolving rapidly as research on this frontier continues. Table 2 reviews recommended dosing of selected agents in acute coronary syndromes.",

A 20% full-thickness burn injury of the skin increased the plasma concentration of epinephrine 30 mins after the injury in female C57BL/6 mice, but not norepinephrine or dopamine. The burn also increased IL-6 production in unburned abdominal skin. The administration of a beta-blocker before a 20% burn injury suppressed the increased IL-6 production in unburned abdominal skin as determined by both protein level and mRNA expression. Pretreatment with the alpha-blocker was less effective.",

All the modulators affected the development of E. pisi by inhibiting the colony diameter, number of secondary branches, number of hyphal cells per colony and number of haustoria. The calmodulin antagonist was more effective in reducing E. pisi development. The results suggest the possible involvement of calcium and calmodulin in the development of E. pisi on pea leaves.",

The amount and composition of the extracellular matrix of the cribriform region and the morphology of the lamellae were similar among the three groups of eyes with POAG. Pigmentation of trabecular cells appeared to be a marker for aqueous flow, as significantly more cells contained pigment in regions of the meshwork with thin or normal lamellae than in regions with thickened and fused lamellae. These regions were variable around the circumference of the eye, and were similar between eyes with and without beta-Blocker therapy.",

Therefore, action aimed at reducing proteinuria should be a priority in the treatment of these patients. Various antihypertensive drugs, in particular the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), have a greater antiproteinuric effect, although it is difficult to establish whether this is due only to their effect on arterial blood pressure (BP) or to other mechanisms associated with blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).",

There were no differences in the BP reached in the four therapy groups; however, proteinuria only decreased in the patients treated with trandolapril alone or in combination with verapamil. In period II, BP levels rose to 134+/-10/84+/-8 mmHg (P<0.05); this increase in BP was accompanied by an increase in proteinuria in those patients who had received the ACEI alone or in combination in the previous period, while in patients previously treated with a betaB or a CCB, proteinuria decreased, in spite of the increase in BP.",

Recent experimental and clinical data provide strong evidence that the increase in blood pressure is to a large part due to sympathetic overactivity which is triggered by afferent signals emanating from the kidney and resetting sympathetic tone by stimulation of hypothalamic centres. The sequelae of sympathetic overactivity extend beyond their effects on blood pressure and include accelerated progression of renal failure and presumably increased cardiac arrhythmia.", 
    "104": "Use of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade in the treatment of heart failure has been associated with a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption and an improvement in myocardial energy efficiency. One potential mechanism for this beneficial effect is a shift in myocardial substrate use from increased free fatty acid (FFA) oxidation to increased glucose oxidation.",

Myocardial uptake of the novel long chain fatty acid metabolic tracer 14(R, S)-[(18)F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid ([(18)F]-FTHA) was used to determine myocardial FFA use, and [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose ([(18)F]-FDG) was used to determine myocardial glucose use. After carvedilol treatment, the mean myocardial uptake rate for [(18)F]-FTHA decreased (from 20.4+/-8.6 to 9.7+/-2.3 mL. 100 g(-1). min(-1); P<0.005), mean fatty acid use decreased (from 19.3+/-7.0 to 8.2+/-1.8 micromoL. 100 g(-1). min(-1); P<0.005), the mean myocardial uptake rate for [(18)F]-FDG was unchanged (from 1.4+/-0.4 to 2.4+/-0.8 mL. 100 g(-1). min(-1); P=0.14), and mean glucose use was unchanged (from 11.1+/-3.1 to 18.7+/-6.0 micromoL. 100 g(-1). min(-1); P=0.12).

    "107": "Various vanilloid-type beta-adrenoceptor blockers were studied on guinea pig right atrium and trachea and rat colon. In addition, we also investigated their beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-adrenoceptor binding affinities. All these beta-adrenergic antagonists inhibited (-)isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic effects of the right atrium and tracheal relaxation responses in a concentration-dependent manner. Some of these agents prevented the inhibition of rat colon spontaneous motility by (-)isoproterenol. Of the agents tested, we found that ferulidilol, eugenodilol, eugenolol, isoeugenolol, and ferulinolol, as well as propranolol and metoprolol, possessed beta(3)-adrenoceptor blocking activities, others were nearly without effectiveness. Furthermore, the binding characteristics of vanilloid-type beta-adrenergic antagonists were evaluated in [3H]CGP-12177, a beta(1)/beta(2)-adrenoceptor blocker and a beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist, binding to beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-adrenoceptor sites in rat ventricle, lung, and interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) membranes, respectively. Eugenodilol, eugenolol, metoprolol, isoeugenolol, and ferulinolol were less potent than both propranolol and ferulidilol in competing for the beta(3)-adrenoceptor binding sites. From the results of in vitro functional and binding studies, we suggested that propranolol, ferulidilol, eugenodilol, eugenolol, metoprolol, isoeugenolol, and ferulinolol all possessed beta(3)-adrenoceptor blocking activities. On the other hand, we also found that eugenodilol, eugenolol, metoprolol, isoeugenolol, and ferulinolol had a low lipid solubility in comparison with propranolol and ferulidilol. In conclusion, we proposed that beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonistic actions of these vanilloid-type beta-blockers were positively correlated with their lipid solubility.",

    "114": "This study tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial precursor targeting peptides can elicit the release of cytochrome c from both liver and brain mitochondria by a mechanism distinct from that mediated by the classical, Ca2+-activated permeability transition pore. Human cytochrome oxidase subunit IV signal peptide (hCOXIV1-22) at concentrations from 15 to 100 microM induced swelling, a decrease in membrane potential, and cytochrome c release in both types of mitochondria. Although cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid were without effect, dibucaine, propanolol, dextran, and the uncoupler FCCP were each able to inhibit signal peptide-induced swelling and cytochrome c release. Adenylate kinase was coreleased with cytochrome c, arguing against a signal peptide-induced cytochrome c-specific pathway of efflux across the outer membrane. Taken together, the data indicate that a human mitochondrial signal peptide can evoke the release of cytochrome c from both liver and brain mitochondria by a unique permeability transition that differs in several characteristics from the classical mitochondrial permeability transition.", 
    "115": "In a previous study we showed that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) stimulates activation of protein kinase C through phosphoinositide hydrolysis by phospholipase C and phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by phospholipase D in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. In the present study, we investigated whether bFGF stimulates the induction of heat shock protein (HSP) 27, a low-molecular-weight HSP, and HSP70, a high-molecular-weight HSP, in MC3T3-E1 cells and the mechanism behind the induction. bFGF increased the level of HSP27 while having little effect on HSP70 level. bFGF stimulated the accumulation of HSP27 dose-dependently in the range between 1 and 30 ng/ml. bFGF induced an increase in the level of the mRNA for HSP27. The bFGF-stimulated accumulation of HSP27 was reduced by inhibitors of protein kinase C. The bFGF-induced HSP27 accumulation was reduced in protein kinase C-downregulated MC3T3-E1 cells. U-73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, and propranolol, a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase inhibitor, suppressed the bFGF-stimulated HSP27 accumulation. These results strongly suggest that bFGF stimulates HSP27 induction through protein kinase C activation in osteoblasts.", 
    "116": "This study was conducted to determine potentially differential effects between an angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonist and an ACE inhibitor on systemic, renal, and glomerular hemodynamics and pathological changes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with N(omega)-nitro-L>-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-exacerbated nephrosclerosis. The hemodynamic, renal micropuncture, and pathological studies were performed in 9 groups of 17-week-old male SHR treated as follows: group 1, controls (n=16); group 2, candesartan (10 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks) (n=7); group 3, enalapril (30 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks) (n=8); group 4, candesartan (5 mg/kg per day) plus enalapril (15 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks) (n=9); group 5, L-NAME (50 mg/L in drinking water for 3 weeks) (n=17); group 6, L-NAME (50 mg/L) plus candesartan (10 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks) (n=7); group 7, L-NAME (50 mg/L) for 3 weeks followed by candesartan (10 mg/kg per day) for another 3 weeks (n=8); group 8, L-NAME (50 mg/L) plus enalapril (30 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks) (n=7); and group 9, L-NAME (50 mg/L) plus enalapril (30 mg/kg per day) and the bradykinin antagonist icatibant (500 microg/kg SC per day via osmotic minipump for 3 weeks) (n=7). Both candesartan and enalapril similarly reduced mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance index. These changes were associated with significant decreases in afferent and efferent glomerular arteriolar resistances as well as glomerular capillary pressure. Histopathologically, the glomerular and arterial injury scores were decreased significantly, and left ventricular and aortic masses also were diminished significantly in all treated groups. L-NAME-induced urinary protein excretion was prevented by both candesartan and enalapril. Thus, both AT(1) receptor and ACE inhibition prevented and reversed the pathophysiological alterations of L-NAME-exacerbated nephrosclerosis in SHR. Itatibant only blunted the antihypertensive effects of enalapril but did not attenuate the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition on the L-NAME-induced nephrosclerosis. Thus, the AT(1) receptor antagonism and ACE inhibition have similar renal preventive effects, which most likely were achieved through reduction in the effects of angiotensin II, and ACE inhibition of bradykinin degradation demonstrated little evidence of renoprotection.", 
    "117": "The precise mechanism by which beta-adrenoceptor blockers exert their beneficial actions in patients with heart failure remains unclear. Several possibilities have been proposed, including heart rate reduction, beta2-adrenoceptor-mediated modulation of catecholamine release, antagonism of the receptor-mediated toxic actions of norepinephrine on the myocardium, and favorable effects on myocardial energetics. In the present study we evaluated the effect of 3 months of carvedilol therapy on hemodynamics, total systemic and cardiac norepinephrine spillover (isotope dilution method), and myocardial metabolism (myocardial oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide release) in 10 patients with severe congestive heart failure. Although carvedilol treatment was associated with a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (17+/-1% to 28+/-3%; P<0.01) and left ventricular stroke work (87+/-13 to 119+/-21 g. m per beat; P<0.05), this effect was unrelated to changes in total systemic or cardiac norepinephrine spillover. The rise in left ventricular stroke work was accompanied by a modest rise in myocardial oxygen consumption per beat (0.33+/-0.04 to 0.42+/-0.04; P=0.05), although contractile efficiency was unchanged. The favorable effects of carvedilol on ventricular function in the failing heart are not explained by alterations in norepinephrine release or by changes in myocardial contractile efficiency.", 
    "118": "The basolateral amygdala (BLA) can influence distinct learning and memory formation. Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), the most prominent cellular model of memory formation, can be modulated by stimulation of the BLA in its induction and early maintenance. However, it is not known how the late maintenance of LTP beyond its initial phases might be affected. Behavioral stimuli have been shown to result in a reinforcement of a transient early-LTP into a lasting potentiation. Here we show that BLA stimulation mimics the behavioral effects on early-LTP in freely moving rats when the BLA is activated within a time window of 30 min before or after tetanization of the perforant path. The reinforcement of LTP was blocked by inhibitors of muscarinergic and beta-adrenergic but not dopaminergic receptors and was dependent on translation. Through these heterosynaptic associative interactions, hippocampal sensory information can be stabilized by amygdaloidal influences.", 
    "119": "Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) modulates constituents of the immune system. 5-HT1A receptor antagonists potently suppress lymphocyte function. NK cell activity (NKCA) was measured after exposure of mononuclear cells to the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist pindobind and the 5-HT(1C/2) receptor antagonist ketanserin. Elutriated monocytes were exposed to pindobind, incubated with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in the presence or absence of an H2O2 scavenger catalase, and NKCA measured. Pindobind, but not ketanserin, suppressed NKCA in vitro. Pindobind-treated monocytes suppressed NKCA, whereas pindobind treatment of PBL did not affect NKCA. Catalase inhibited pindobind-induced suppression of NKCA. These data are consistent with previous results that 5-HT modulates NKCA via 5-HT1A receptors on monocytes and suggest that 5-HT may abrogate monocyte suppression of NKCA by inhibiting monocyte signals such as H2O2.",

Three controlled trials have demonstrated that a nitrate derivative beta-blocker combination improves the efficacy of beta-blockers in terms of reduced bleeding. Nitrates can be prescribed alone in case of a contraindication for beta-blockers but the efficacy is poorly demonstrated.", 
    "122": "Both incidence of first bleeding episode and mortality are significantly reduced after sclerotherapy. Variable results have however been reported and sclerotherapy is probably only effective in high-risk patients; the consensus conference has not recommended its use. On the contrary, endoscopic ligature is probably useful since 5 preliminary studies have demonstrated a significant effect on first bleeding and mortality. Its relative contribution compared with propranolol remains to be demonstrated.",

The beta-blocker-nitrate combination and the beta-blocker-endoscopic treatment combination cannot be recommended at the present time.", 
    "124": "Meta-analyses have shown that beta-blockers or sclerotherapy significantly reduce the incidence of recurrent bleeding and mortality. Sclerotherapy significantly reduces the risk of recurrent bleeding compared with beta-blockers although there is no difference in mortality and the incidence of complications is significantly greater with sclerotherapy. Associating the two methods can significantly reduce recurrent bleeding but has no effect on mortality. Elastic ligature is significantly more effective in terms of recurrent bleeding and mortality or complication rate. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) significantly reduces the incidence of recurrent bleeding but has no effect on mortality and the risk of hepatic encephalopathy is increased.", 
    "125": "Elastic ligature can be proposed as a first intention treatment. Sclerotherapy is useful to eradicate varix after size reduction by ligature and to prevent recurrence. In case of failure, a TIPS or surgical shunt can be discussed. Liver transplantation would be indicated in high-risk patients keeping in mind that digestive tract bleeding is a supplementary argument favoring transplantation.",

    "127": "Previous investigations demonstrated that CYP2D16 was expressed at high levels in guinea pig adrenal microsomes. The studies presented here were done to determine whether adrenal metabolism of bufuralol (BUF), a model CYP2D substrate, was similar to that in the liver. Guinea pig adrenal microsomes converted BUF to 1'-hydroxybufuralol (1'-OH-BUF) as the major metabolite and smaller amounts of a compound identified as 6-hydroxybufuralol (6-OH-BUF). In contrast, 6-OH-BUF was the major product formed by hepatic microsomal preparations. The apparent Km values were similar for 1'-OH-BUF and 6-OH-BUF production in each tissue. Quinidine, a selective CYP2D inhibitor, decreased the production of both BUF metabolites equally in liver and adrenal microsomes. Cortisol also caused equivalent decreases in the rates of 1'-OH-BUF and 6-OH-BUF formation by adrenal microsomes, but had no effect on hepatic BUF metabolism. Although both BUF metabolites may be produced by CYP2D16, unknown factors appear to effect some differences in the catalytic characteristics of BUF metabolism in adrenal and liver. The large amount of 6-OH-BUF produced distinguishes BUF metabolism in guinea pigs from that in other species previously studied.", 
    "128": "The purpose of the study was to assess the implementation of secondary prevention guidelines of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients undergoing peripheral revascularization surgery. The design was a descriptive study of the prevalence of cardiac risk factors and preventive pharmacological therapy in vascular surgical patients set in an academic medical center between July 1996 and February 1999. A total of 237 patients were recruited, 82 (35%) having carotid surgery and 155 (65%) having lower extremity bypass. Data were collected from an existing database of a study examining perioperative cardiac events in vascular surgery patients. The majority of patients were hypertensive and 58% of patients had a blood pressure >140/90 mmHg. Most patients (81%) reported a history of tobacco use and 23% were active smokers. Of the 41% of patients who were diabetic, 46% had a random glucose >140 mg/dl. Half of the patients took aspirin, 35% a lipid-lowering medication, 30% a beta-blocker. Patients with lower extremity disease were less likely than patients with carotid disease to be on aspirin (45% vs. 62%), a lipid-lowering agent (30% vs. 45%), or a beta-blocker (26% vs. 39%) (all p<0.05). Of patients with heart disease, more men than women were on aspirin (62% vs. 45%) (p<0.05). In conclusion, our findings suggest that patients presenting for vascular surgery have a high prevalence of modifiable CAD risk factors that are not being adequately managed. Preoperative examination of vascular patients is an important opportunity to assess and implement neglected secondary prevention measures.", 
    "129": "Results of the studies published or reported within the last 2 years provide convincing evidence that beta-blockers can decrease mortality in patients with chronic symptomatic heart failure because of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS)-II and Metoprolol CR/XL Randomised Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) trials showed a 34% reduction in all-cause death with bisoprolol and metoprolol therapy in patients with class II-III heart failure. Data from Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS), with a 35% mortality reduction, extended this benefit to class IV patients treated with carvedilol who do not require intravenous diuretics or positive inotropes. Ongoing beta-blocker studies address new topics, such as treatment of older patients, in whom diastolic heart failure may be more common, and direct comparison of different drugs. Although the use of beta-blockers for heart failure tends to increase, implementation of the knowledge from the trials in clinical practice still remains a challenge.", 
    "130": "The interaction of an agonist-bound G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with its cognate G-protein initiates a sequence of experimentally quantifiable changes in both the GPCR and G-protein. These include the release of GDP from G(alpha), the formation of a ternary complex between the nucleotide-free G-protein and the GPCR, which has a high affinity for agonist, followed by the binding of GTP to G(alpha), the dissociation of the GPCR/G-protein complex, and the hydrolysis of GTP. The efficacy of an agonist is a measure of its ability to activate this cascade. It has been proposed that efficacy reflects the ability of the agonist to stabilize the active state of the GPCR. We examined a series of beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)AR) agonists (weak partial agonists to full agonists) for their efficacy at promoting two different steps of the G-protein activation/deactivation cycle: stabilizing the ternary complex (high-affinity, GTP-sensitive agonist binding), and steady-state GTPase activity. We obtained results for the wild-type beta(2)AR and a constitutively active mutant of the beta(2)AR (beta(2)AR(CAM)) using fusion proteins between the GPCRs and G(salpha) to facilitate GPCR/G-protein interactions. There was no correlation between efficacy of ligands in activating GTPase and their ability to stabilize the ternary complex at beta(2)AR(CAM). Our results suggest that the GPCR state that optimally promotes the GDP release and GTP binding is different from the GPCR state that stabilizes the ternary complex. By strongly stabilizing the ternary complex, certain partial agonists may reduce the rate of G-protein turnover relative to a full agonist.",

The extracellular Ca(2+)-free condition, a L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker (nifedipine) and an ATP-sensitive K(+) channel opener, diazoxide, completely inhibited increases in cytosolic free Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) and insulin secretion evoked by JTT-608 in the presence of extracellular Ca(2+). An electrophysiological study using single-barreled microelectrode techniques demonstrated that membrane potential (V(m)) and input resistance of the cell membrane (R(i)) are depolarized and increased by JTT-608, respectively. The apparent transference number for K(+) was also significantly decreased after the addition of JTT-608. These effects immediately occurred after addition of JTT-608 and very rapidly disappeared after removal of JTT-608, which has not been observed in sulfonylureas. Also, these effects of JTT-608 were diminished, but not completely by diazoxide. JTT-608 did not affect the specific binding of [(3)H]glibenclamide to the sulfonylurea receptor. These findings suggest that JTT-608 mainly inhibits ATP-sensitive K(+) channel activity via a binding site distinct from the sulfonylurea receptor and then depolarizes V(m) to open voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2+) channels. Subsequently, these events stimulate Ca(2+) entry to increase [Ca(2+)]i and induce insulin secretion from MIN6 cells. Therefore, JTT-608 is a unique hypoglycemic agent that enhances high glucose-induced insulin secretion. The present findings indicate that JTT-608 is a more useful new class of therapeutic drug for patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, compared with sulfonylurea derivatives.", 
    "132": "It is a privilege and honor to be selected by the American Society of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics for the Torald Sollmann Award. I wish to take this opportunity to comment on my experiences over the last 40 plus years as both a student and a faculty member. I was trained in pharmacology as well as medicine with the goal of entering an academic career that would permit me to engage in teaching and research. The subject of my presentation focuses on the events that helped to shape my career. Attention is given to those who made it possible for me to advance in my learning, teaching, and research. In addition to having been taught by excellent instructors, I have benefitted from having many outstanding undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows, without whom much of what I feel I have accomplished would not have been possible. Being surrounded by a supportive environment and accompanied by bright and eager young students gives me reason to look toward the future with enthusiasm. I chose to take the time and space allotted to me to present a brief overview of where I have been and how many individuals played important roles in helping to achieve my goals. In essence, this composition is a tribute to my family, professional associates, and current and former students.", 
    "133": "Physiological and anatomic methods were used to determine whether neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), or hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) mediate the cardiovascular response evoked from the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), which is believed to play a key role in mediating responses to stress. In urethane-anesthetized rats, activation of neurons in the DMH by microinjection of bicuculline resulted in a large increase in arterial pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity. The pressor and sympathoexcitatory responses, but not the tachycardic response, were greatly reduced after bilateral muscimol injections into the RVLM even when baseline arterial pressure was maintained at a constant level. These responses were not reduced by muscimol injections into the PVN or NTS. Retrograde tracing experiments identified many neurons in the DMH that projected directly to the RVLM. The results indicate that the vasomotor and cardiac components of the response evoked from the DMH are mediated by pathways that are dependent and independent, respectively, of neurons in the RVLM.", 
    "134": "Clinicians and experimentalists routinely estimate vagal-cardiac nerve traffic from respiratory sinus arrhythmia. However, evidence suggests that sympathetic mechanisms may also modulate respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Our study examined modulation of respiratory sinus arrhythmia by sympathetic outflow. We measured R-R interval spectral power in 10 volunteers that breathed sequentially at 13 frequencies, from 15 to 3 breaths/min, before and after beta-adrenergic blockade. We fitted changes of respiratory frequency R-R interval spectral power with a damped oscillator model: frequency-dependent oscillations with a resonant frequency, generated by driving forces and modified by damping influences. beta-Adrenergic blockade enhanced respiratory sinus arrhythmia at all frequencies (at some, fourfold). The damped oscillator model fit experimental data well (39 of 40 ramps; r = 0.86 +/- 0.02). beta-Adrenergic blockade increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia by amplifying respiration-related driving forces (P < 0.05), without altering resonant frequency or damping influences. Both spectral power data and the damped oscillator model indicate that cardiac sympathetic outflow markedly reduces heart period oscillations at all frequencies. This challenges the notion that respiratory sinus arrhythmia is mediated simply by vagal-cardiac nerve activity. These results have important implications for clinical and experimental estimation of human vagal cardiac tone.", 
    "135": "The beneficial effects of beta-blockers on long-term outcome after acute myocardial infarction were shown before the introduction of thrombolysis and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Generally, the patients recruited to these trials were at low risk: few had heart failure, and none had measurements of left-ventricular function taken. We investigated the long-term efficacy of carvedilol on morbidity and mortality in patients with left-ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction treated according to current evidence-based practice.", 
    "136": "In a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, 1959 patients with a proven acute myocardial infarction and a left-ventricular ejection fraction of </=40% were randomly assigned 6.25 mg carvedilol (n=975) or placebo (n=984). Study medication was progressively increased to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily during the next 4-6 weeks, and patients were followed up until the requisite number of primary endpoints had occurred. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality or hospital admission for cardiovascular problems. Analysis was by intention to treat.", 
    "137": "Although there was no difference between the carvedilol and placebo groups in the number of patients with the primary endpoint (340 [35%] vs 367 [37%], hazard ratio 0.92 [95% CI 0.80-1.07]), all-cause mortality alone was lower in the carvedilol group than in the placebo group (116 [12%] vs 151 [15%], 0.77 [0.60-0.98], p=0.03). Cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and all-cause mortality or non-fatal myocardial infarction were also lower on carvedilol than on placebo.", 
    "138": "In patients treated long-term after an acute myocardial infarction complicated by left-ventricular systolic dysfunction, carvedilol reduced the frequency of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and recurrent, non-fatal myocardial infarctions. These beneficial effects are additional to those of evidence-based treatments for acute myocardial infarction including ACE inhibitors.", 
    "139": "Abnormal decline in heart rate (HR) after exercise has been linked to increased cardiac mortality. This study compares the decrease in HR in different patient types, elucidates the relation between the increase and decrease of HR with exercise, and studies the role of beta blockers on the recovery of HR after exercise. One hundred patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), 50 subjects with a very low likelihood of CAD (normals), and 21 postcardiac transplant (Tx) patients underwent Bruce protocols. Peak HR, percent of peak HR achieved, HR reserve percent, and decline in HR at 1, 3, 5, and 8 minutes were obtained for all groups and also for subgroups based on the use of beta blockers. HR recovery at 1, 3, 5, and 8 minutes differed significantly between patients with CAD, normals, and Tx patients. HR recovery at 1, 3, 5, and 8 minutes also differed significantly within the groups (normal and CAD) based on the use of beta blockers. There was highly significant correlation between decrease in HR and peak HR, percent peak HR and HR reserve percent in normal and CAD groups. After correction of the HR recovery for dependence on peak HR and HR reserve percent, the difference in HR recovery between normal and CAD groups was markedly reduced. The difference in the decrease of HR within each group (normal and CAD), based on the use of beta blockers or not, was also markedly reduced. beta blockers have a significant impact on the decrease in HR due to its effect on chronotropism. HR recovery rate is highly dependent on the chronotropic response. Hence, the main portion of the abnormality in HR recovery after exercise can be explained by chronotropic incompetence.", 
    "140": "Catecholamines (CA) regulate several physiological processes in molluscs. Experiments have been conducted to determine the effects of noradrenaline (NA), the principal CA circulating in bivalve hemolymph, on oyster hemocytephagocytosis. Results show that NA had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on phagocytosis at physiological concentrations of 0.1 microM and above. The beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol mimicked the inhibitory effects of NA on phagocytosis, whereas the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine had no significant effect. Furthermore, the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propanolol, but not the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, prevented the inhibition of phagocytosis by NA. The type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram acted synergistically with a suboptimal concentration of isoproterenol to inhibit phagocytosis, and the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89, but not the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C, attenuated the effect of isoproterenol. These results show that NA can modulate oyster hemocyte phagocytosis via a beta-adrenergic receptor/cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway.", 
    "141": "In the setting of soaring popularity, postmarketing studies of calcium channel blockers came to suggest an increase in a variety of major adverse end points. The evidence, however, was largely observational, and large-scale trials capable of addressing the concerns were wanting. Clinical trials now support the safety and efficacy of the long-acting dihydropyridines for patients with both uncomplicated and diabetic hypertension, although conventional therapies and, in the latter case, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have superior proof of benefit. By contrast, short-acting dihydropyridines should be avoided. In the acute coronary syndromes, beta-blockers remain the treatment of choice; the evidence for nondihydropyridines remains inconclusive. Stable angina calls for beta-blockers as first-line therapy and nondihydropyridines as second-line therapy, whereas in ventricular dysfunction, safety data for nondihydropyridines are lacking. Initial reports of cancer, bleeding, and suicide have been contradicted by subsequent data, making the associations uncertain or unlikely. Remaining questions await completion of ongoing trials to better define the indications for these agents.", 
    "142": "The alpha-adrenergic agonist brimonidine and the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor dorzolamide have been studied both as monotherapy and in combination with beta-blockers in the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension; however, a MEDLINE literature search failed to reveal any clinical studies directly comparing these 2 agents as adjunctive therapy.", 
    "143": "The purpose of this study was to compare the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy of brimonidine and dorzolamide as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers in adult patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.", 
    "144": "In a prospective, investigator-masked, multicenter, parallel-design clinical trial, adult patients whose IOP was inadequately controlled with topical beta-blocker therapy were randomly assigned to receive brimonidine 0.2% twice daily or dorzolamide 2% 3 times daily as adjunctive therapy for 3 months. Efficacy was determined by the reduction in IOP from baseline. After 1 month of adjunctive treatment, patients who failed to meet a target 15% reduction in IOP at peak drug effect were crossed over to the other study medication.", 
    "145": "A total of 106 patients were treated. Approximately 70% (74/106) of the patients were white, and 61.3% (65/106) had a diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma. Mean baseline IOP (ie, with beta-blocker monotherapy) was comparable between treatment groups (approximately 21 mm Hg). After 1 month of adjunctive treatment, the mean daily IOP reduction was significantly greater with brimonidine (4.40 mm Hg, 20.4%) than with dorzolamide (3.0 mm Hg, 14.4%, P = 0.033). At peak drug effect at month 1, the mean IOP reduction was significantly greater in the brimonidine group (5.95 mm Hg, 27.6%) than in the dorzolamide group (4.11 mm Hg, 19.7%; P = 0.007). Significantly more patients treated with brimonidine (44/51, 86.3%) than with dorzolamide (29/47, 61.7%) achieved the target 15% reduction in IOP at month 1 (P = 0.005). At month 3, the mean daily IOP reduction and the mean IOP reduction at peak drug effect were not significantly different in the 2 treatment groups. The mean daily IOP reduction was 4.98 mm Hg in the brimonidine group and 3.15 mm Hg in the dorzolamide group (P = 0.092). At peak drug effect, the mean IOP reduction was 6.39 mm Hg with brimonidine and 4.06 mm Hg with dorzolamide. The incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation was 9.3% (5/54) in the brimonidine group (depression, 2; allergic conjunctivitis, 1; dry mouth and tearing, 1; dermatitis, 1) and 9.8% (5/51) in the dorzolamide group (ocular burning and stinging, 2; ocular itch, 1; gastrointestinal complaints, 1; lack of tolerance for beta-blocker, 1), with no significant difference between groups.", 
    "146": "In this trial, brimonidine 0.2% twice daily produced greater mean decreases in IOP and was effective in more patients than dorzolamide 2% 3 times daily when used as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers.", 
    "147": "In the present investigation the identification of beta -adrenoceptor (beta -ARs) subtypes in the Caco-2 cell line was performed using radiometric assays. beta -ARs were measured using increasing concentrations of the highly specific beta -AR antagonist (-)[(3)H]CGP 12177 (0.06-4 nM), whereas the beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR subtypes discriminated through selective binding assays using the highly selective unlabelled antagonists CGP 20712A and ICI 118551. Atypical beta -ARs were measured using an incubation system formed by higher concentrations (0.6-20 nM) of (-)[(3)H]CGP 12177. beta - Atypical binding site concentrations (69 +/- 5 fmol mg ml(-1)of membrane protein) were higher than beta(1)-ARs (7 +/- 1) and beta(2)-ARs (24 +/- 2), respectively. The different beta -AR subtype affinities were characterized by binding inhibition experiments and the adrenergic agonists displaced the radioligand from its specific binding sites in the following order of potency: isoproterenol > clenbuterol > dobutamine > SR 58611A; for antagonists the order of potency was: propranolol approximately = ICI118551 approximately = CGP20712A. For atypical beta -ARs the order was: SR 58611A > clenbuterol > dobutamine > isoproterenol for agonists and propranolol > CGP 20712A > ICI 118551 for antagonists. As far as in vitro functional studies are concerned, beta -AR subtypes were shown to be coupled to adenylyl cyclase as their stimulation produced cAMP in an amount significantly higher than basal values. cAMP production after stimulation with dobutamine, clenbuterol, isoproterenol, and SR 58611A was measured using a cAMP radioassay kit. The order of efficacy suggested that the stimulation of beta(2)-ARs was the most effective in inducing the activation of cell signalling mechanisms. The identification of functional beta -ARs in a cancer cell line represents the first step in the study of the possible adrenergic control of cellular activities (e.g. proliferation and/or differentiation), which could suggest the use of this cancer cell line as a model for the study of cell activity or possibly new therapeutic strategies.", 
    "148": "Men with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are more likely to have erectile dysfunction (ED) than the general population, as both conditions share risk factors and some drugs used to treat CVD may induce ED as a side-effect. This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of sildenafil citrate for the treatment of ED in men with CVD who were receiving treatment with beta-blockers and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or calcium-channel blockers, but not nitrates. Treatment with sildenafil was associated with significant increases in the mean end-of-treatment scores for the questions from the International Index of Erectile Function that assess the ability to achieve and maintain erections (p = 0.0001). Furthermore, 71% of patients taking sildenafil reported improved erections compared with 24% taking placebo (p = 0.0001). This study also showed that sildenafil was well tolerated in patients with CVD and ED. Besides flushing, no treatment-related cardiovascular adverse events were noted for sildenafil.", 
    "149": "The wild-type beta2-adrenoceptor and a constitutively active mutant of this receptor were C-terminally tagged with luciferase from the sea pansy Renilla reniformis. C-terminal addition of Renilla luciferase did not substantially alter the levels of expression of either form of the receptor, the elevated constitutive activity of the mutant beta2-adrenoceptor nor the capacity of isoprenaline to elevate cyclic AMP levels in intact cells expressing these constructs. Treatment of cells expressing constitutively active mutant beta2-adrenoceptor-Renilla luciferase with antagonist/inverse agonist ligands resulted in upregulation of levels of this polypeptide which could be monitored by the elevated luciferase activity. The pEC50 for ligand-induced luciferase upregulation and ligand affinity to bind the receptor were highly correlated. Similar upregulation could be observed following sustained treatment with agonist ligands. These effects were only observed at a constitutively active mutant of the beta2-adrenoceptor. Co-expression of the wild-type beta2-adrenoceptor C-terminally tagged with the luciferase from Photinus pyralis did not result in ligand-induced upregulation of the levels of activity of this luciferase. Co-expression of the constitutively active mutant beta2-adrenoceptor-Renilla luciferase and an equivalent mutant of the alpha1b-adrenoceptor C-terminally tagged with green fluorescent protein allowed pharmacological selectivity of adrenoceptor antagonists to be demonstrated. This approach offers a sensitive and convenient means, which is amenable to high throughput analysis, to monitor ligand binding to a constitutively active mutant receptor. As no prior knowledge of receptor ligands is required this approach may be suitable to identify ligands at orphan G protein-coupled receptors."
