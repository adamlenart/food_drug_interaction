    "0": "1. The effects of rapid intracoronary injection of acetylcholine (ACh) were studied in anaesthetized open chest dogs. Changes in phasic coronary blood flow were followed with non-cannulating electromagnetic flow probes and in contractile force with isometric strain gauges.2. Increasing doses of ACh from 0.01 to 100 mug produced progressively larger increases in systolic and diastolic coronary blood flow and progressive decreases in end-diastolic vascular resistance which were blocked by atropine but not by propranolol.3. Contractile force showed both negative and positive responses. The negative inotropic effect was small and was blocked by atropine but not by propranolol. The threshold for the negative inotropic response was higher than for the coronary vasodilator effect and the dose response curve was flatter. The positive inotropic response usually showed two components. One component reached its maximum 13 to 18 s after injection, had a high threshold (over 1 mug), was potentiated by atropine and blocked by propranolol. The other reached its maximum 25 to 60 s after the injection, had a threshold between 0.01 and 0.1 mug, and was blocked by atropine but not by propranolol.4. These results suggest that the coronary dilator response, the negative inotropic response and part of the positive inotropic response are mediated through \"muscarinic\" receptors. The remaining component of the positive inotropic response appears to involve catecholamine release.", 
    "1": "1. In rats the effect of drugs on oxotremorine tremor and oxotremorine-induced increase in brain acetylcholine has been investigated.2. Reserpine, (+/-)-alpha-methylmetatyrosine and diethyldithio-carbamic acid, drugs which have in common the ability to decrease tissue noradrenaline concentration, inhibited oxotremorine tremor without preventing the oxotremorine-induced increase in brain acetylcholine.3. (+/-)-p-chlorophenylalanine, a depletor of tissue 5-hydroxytryptamine, did not inhibit oxotremorine tremor.4. Phenoxybenzamine and propranolol inhibited oxotremorine tremor, and propranolol was without effect on oxotremorine-induced increase in brain acetylcholine.5. The toxicity of oxotremorine was increased by reserpine and phenoxybenzamine.6. The significance of these findings is discussed with regard to the mode of action of oxotremorine.", 
    "2": "5-Methylpyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (U-19425) and nicotinic acid, which apparently inhibit lipolysis in vivo as indicated by low plasma FFA and glycerol concentrations, stimulate lipolysis in vitro in adipose tissue removed from fasted rats 30-90 min after treatment. This stimulation is not the result of low initial levels of FFA in adipose tissue. An increased rate of lipolysis is not induced in vitro by preincubating tissue of untreated rats with U-19425. The increase can be blocked in incubated adipose tissue of U-19425-treated animals if U-19425 is added to the incubation medium. The beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol, at a concentration which inhibits epinephrine-stimulated lipolysis, does not affect the increase produced by administration of U-19425."
