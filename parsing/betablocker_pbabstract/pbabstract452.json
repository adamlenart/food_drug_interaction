It is unlikely that this hitherto unreported occurrence represents altered tone in the dense adrenergic innervation to the posterior ciliary circulation. We advise the continued use of beta-adrenergic blockers as prophylaxis in ocular migraine.", 
    "1": "The authors investigated the cardiovascular effects of low doses of nitroprusside, dobutamine, and phenylephrine and a beta-adrenergic blocking dose of propranolol in conscious, healthy horses with and without prior atropine administration. A parasympathetic blocking dose of atropine produced significant increases in heart rate and arterial pressures, and decreased stroke volume, ejection fraction, pulse pressure, and right-ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume. Cardiac output was not changed by atropine administration. Nitroprusside reduced arterial pressures to a greater extent in atropinized horses but increased heart rate in both atropinized and non-atropinized horses. Dobutamine increased mean arterial pressure in both non-atropinized and atropinized horses but increased heart rate, diastolic arterial pressure, and systemic vascular resistance only in atropinized horses. Propranolol did not affect any of the hemodynamic variables that were measured. Phenylephrine, in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade, increased mean arterial pressure and reduced cardiac output. This study showed that low doses of nitroprusside, dobutamine, and phenylephrine produce significant hemodynamic effects in conscious, healthy horses and that these effects are modified by prevailing parasympathetic tone.", 
    "2": "Basic haemodynamic parameters - blood volume (BV), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were studied in two groups of overweight patients with mild and moderate hypertension. Each group consisted of 15 subjects. The patients of the first group were kept on low caloric diet (1000-1100 cal per day). Patients of the second-control-group were treated with propranolol (120 mg per day). The duration of each study was 24 weeks. Blood pressure fell due to body weight reduction. BV, CO and SV decreased without changes in TPR. In the control group treated with propranolol in which the body weight did not change a fall in blood pressure, cardiac output, and stroke volume was seen without changes in blood volume and total peripheral resistance values.", 
    "3": "1. The actions of lidocaine on cardiac pacemaker rhythms were studied in anaesthetized dogs and in Purkinje fibres from hearts of the same animals. 2. In vivo, lidocaine (1 mg/kg, intravenously) slowed the sino-atrial (SA) node rhythm (-5.0%), and (during vagal stimulation) prolonged ventricular standstill by +25.1% and slowed the idioventricular rhythm (-16.7%). A higher dose (4 mg/kg) had more pronounced effects. 3. Propranolol also slowed sinus (-26.2%) and idioventricular (-27.2%) rhythms, and prolonged ventricular standstill (+36.8%). In the presence of propranolol, the effects of lidocaine on idioventricular rhythm were exaggerated. 4. In Purkinje fibres driven in vitro, lidocaine (10 mumol/L) decreased contractile force (-47.9%) and (during the interruption of drive) prolonged the suppression of (+53.2%) and slowed the escape rhythm (-67.0%). 5. In the presence of lidocaine the threshold potential was shifted to less negative values and diastolic depolarization slope was decreased (-23.6%). 6. Lidocaine slowed spontaneously active Purkinje fibres, abolished early afterdepolarizations in low [K]o and slow responses in high [K]o (by shifting the threshold to less negative values), and antagonized strophanthidin arrhythmias. 7. TTX reduced the hyperpolarization by lidocaine in low [K]o and vice versa. 8. We conclude that lidocaine enhances vagally-induced ventricular standstill by depressing the idioventricular rhythm far more than the sinus rhythm, an action enhanced by beta-blockade. Furthermore, lidocaine depresses normal and different types of abnormal automaticity through direct and indirect effects of the blockade of the fast sodium channel.", 
    "4": "The effects of sulindac and indomethacin on the blood pressure response to labetalol were determined in well-controlled predominantly obese hypertensive patients (n = 26). A stabilized dose of labetalol alone was administered on weeks 1 and 3, and either indomethacin or sulindac was administered with labetalol on week 2, with cross-over to the other drug on week 4. Indomethacin and sulindac increased the sitting and standing systolic blood pressure (BP) to a statistically significant extent compared with placebo. The effects of indomethacin on systolic BP, diastolic BP, and weight were not significantly different from those with sulindac. Indomethacin but not sulindac produced minor increases in diastolic BP and weight compared with placebo.", 
    "5": "1. Potential pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions between verapamil and propranolol were evaluated in two double-blind, randomised, balanced, crossover studies employing the same six healthy males. 2. The first study examined the effect of repeated propranolol administration on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of verapamil after single oral and intravenous doses. The second explored the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of verapamil and propranolol alone and in combination after single and repeated oral doses. 3. The magnitude of the prolongation of PR interval induced by oral and intravenous verapamil was not affected by pre-treatment with propranolol. When verapamil and propranolol were co-administered as single doses, effects on PR interval were additive but, following repeated doses, a trend towards greater than additive prolongation was seen. The arithmetic sum of the effects of the two drugs was 23% (95% C.I. 8-38%) but the measured increase after the combination was 40% (95% C.I. 26-54%). 4. The extent of reduction in heart rate and blood pressure at rest and after exercise following repeated doses of propranolol was not influenced by single oral or intravenous doses of verapamil. The heart rate and blood pressure responses to single and repeated oral doses of verapamil and propranolol in combination were significantly greater than those after either drug alone and approximated to the arithmetic sum of the individual responses. 5. Although repeated administration of propranolol reduced hepatic blood flow as assessed by indocyanine green clearance, there was no evidence of an interaction between the drugs at this level. 6. The pharmacokinetics of verapamil and norverapamil were not significantly affected by prior propranolol. After single doses of verapamil and propranolol in combination, the maximum plasma concentration of propranolol was increased and the oral clearance of verapamil reduced. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed after repeated doses. 7. These findings provide little evidence of a pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interaction between verapamil and propranolol in normal subjects. Most of the haemodynamic responses to these drugs in combination can be explained by additive drug effects but an interaction affecting AV conduction after repeated doses cannot be excluded. The minor pharmacokinetic interaction between the drugs is unlikely to be relevant to the pharmacodynamic changes.", 
    "6": "The effect of streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus on the pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers of atenolol (AT) was investigated in rats 3 and 9 days after induction of the disease. Occurrence of diabetes was confirmed by a significant increase (p less than 0.05) in the serum glucose concentration (mg%) of the diabetic rats compared with their respective controls in both 3- (441 +/- 66.3 versus 181 +/- 31.3) and 9- (602 +/- 133 versus 187 +/- 20.0) day diabetic groups. Creatinine clearance (CLcr; mL/min/kg) in 9-day diabetic rats (8.98 +/- 3.02) was significantly higher than that in the controls (4.59 +/- 1.08). However, compared with the control animals, the increase in CLcr of the 3-day diabetic rats (8.35 +/- 1.95 versus 6.82 +/- 1.63) was not significant (p greater than 0.05). The changes in CLcr paralleled those in renal clearance (CLr) values of the AT enantiomers; 9-day diabetes induced a significant increase in CLr of the AT enantiomers (82.4 and 81.6% increase for S(-)-and R(+)-enantiomers, respectively). An increase in CLr values of the AT enantiomers in 3-day diabetic rats, on the other hand, did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, a significant increase (55.4 and 52.6% for S(-)- and R(+)-AT, respectively) in the nonrenal clearance values of the AT enantiomers was observed in the 3-day, but not 9-day diabetic rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "We aimed to define the circulatory effects of beta 1-blockade in conscious normal and portal hypertensive rats and determine if pentobarbital anesthesia affected these responses. A selective beta 1-antagonist, betaxolol, was given to four groups: conscious and anesthetized sham-operated and portal hypertensive rats. Cardiac output and splanchnic organ blood flows were measured by radioactive microspheres twice in each rat, before and 15 min after betaxolol. Both groups of conscious rats maintained mean arterial pressure despite significant decreases in cardiac output and heart rate, by increasing total peripheral resistance. Anesthetized rats were unable to do this and thus also diminished arterial pressure significantly, with portal hypertensive rats showing greater decreases than sham-operated rats. Portal tributary flow and portal pressure decreased only in the anesthetized rats. Autoregulation of splanchnic blood flow was not uniform between groups or organs: although splenic flow decreased in all four groups, intestinal blood flow decreased only in anesthetized portal hypertensive rats. The greatest decreases in several splanchnic organ blood flows were seen in this latter group. These results indicate that: (i) pentobarbital markedly changes systemic and splanchnic responses to beta 1-blockade; (ii) splanchnic autoregulation is not uniform--the intestinal circulation enjoys more protection than the splenic; and (iii) portal hypertensive rats seem to be more vulnerable to the circulatory effects of beta 1-blockade.", 
    "8": "Two children with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction due to myocardial hypertrophy received oral disopyramide as a negative inotrope. Both showed rapid improvement in clinical signs and by echo Doppler examination. Nearly complete abolition of severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction was documented in each case. This experience may prompt further application of disopyramide as a therapeutic agent to relieve dynamic muscular subaortic obstruction in children.", 
    "9": "Twenty-four patients were randomized to a double-blind, triple placebo controlled, latin square protocol to examine the relative efficacy of propranolol or diltiazem given as monotherapy or in combination with isosorbide dinitrate. Treatment phases were preceded and followed by placebo control periods. At the end of each phase, symptom-limited treadmill exercise stress tests were performed, as well as rest and exercise radionuclide ventriculography. Both forms of monotherapy were effective in reducing episodes of angina and nitroglycerin use, and in improving exercise tolerance. Diltiazem monotherapy was associated with slightly higher treadmill times (509.9 +/- 123 s) compared to propranolol (462.7 +/- 131 s, P less than 0.05). The addition of isosorbide dinitrate to either form of monotherapy allowed no further improvement in any of the measured clinical responses. Radionuclide ventriculography showed no significant difference in resting left ventricular function. The addition of isosorbide dinitrate to propranolol showed a reduction in end diastolic volume in keeping with a reduction in preload. In response to exercise, stress-induced left ventricular dysfunction was equal in all groups except for the diltiazem-nitrate combination, which was associated with a higher ejection fraction (56.2 +/- 8.6%) compared to monotherapy (52.6 +/- 10.9%, P less than 0.01). A higher cardiac output could be achieved in the groups treated with diltiazem; this was related to increased heart rate and maintenance of stroke volume. It was concluded that diltiazem is equally effective as propranolol for the treatment of chronic stable angina and, in terms of exercise capacity and cardiac output, superior to beta-blockade. The addition of isosorbide dinitrate appears to impart no overt benefits, but some evidence suggests a reduction in left ventricular decompensation in the face of stress.", 
    "10": "The objective of this study was to determine whether the ocular and systemic absorption of topically applied timolol in the pigmented rabbit was significantly affected by the coadministration with other eye medications, including pilocarpine, epinephrine, their prodrugs, phenylephrine, tetracaine, and proparacaine. Twenty-five microliters of 0.65% timolol maleate solutions, both in the presence and absence of a second drug, were instilled to the pigmented rabbit eye. Timolol concentrations in anterior segment tissues were monitored at 30 and 90 min, and the time course of timolol concentration in plasma was monitored over 120 min. All coadministered drugs except proparacaine reduced intraocular timolol concentrations by varying extents depending on the sampling time, while increasing the timolol concentrations in the conjunctiva and sclera. In addition, all coadministered drugs, except pilocarpine, tetracaine, and proparacaine, reduced the systemic absorption of timolol by an average of about 50%. A plausible explanation for the simultaneous reduction in ocular and systemic timolol absorption is changes in tear turnover rate, protein secretion, and binding of timolol to tear proteins, rather than changes in corneal and perhaps conjunctival and nasal permeability, elicited by the second drug. Vasoconstriction on the conjunctival and nasal mucosae is an additional factor possibly contributing to the reduction in systemic timolol absorption by epinephrine, its prodrug, phenylephrine, and perhaps the pilocarpine prodrug. The clinical implication of the above findings is that before instituting combination or multiple drug therapy the possibility of changes in ocular and systemic absorption of the first drug by the second drug must be considered.", 
    "11": "Various aspects of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism have been studied in two groups of patients with mild hypertension before and after four months of treatment with either nifedipine (n = 12) or atenolol (n = 12). Mean (+/- SEM) blood pressure fell to the same degree following treatment with either nifedipine (147 +/- 3/98 +/- 2 to 134 +/- 2/85 +/- 2 mm Hg) or atenolol (149 +/- 3/99 +/- 2 to 135 +/- 2/86 +/- 3 mm Hg). Circulating plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations were measured at hourly intervals from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, before and after breakfast (8:00 AM), and at lunch time (noon). The response to treatment was different in the two groups. Specifically, plasma glucose concentration were unchanged and insulin concentrations were higher in association with atenolol treatment. In contrast, nifedipine-treated patients had similar plasma insulin, but lower plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations after four months of therapy. The changes in day-long plasma glucose and insulin responses suggested that resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake had increased in association with atenolol treatment and decreased following nifedipine. This conclusion was supported in that measurement of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal showed a decrease in atenolol-treated patients and an increase in nifedipine-treated patients. Finally, plasma lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations did not change following atenolol therapy, whereas plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in association with nifedipine administration. These data show that changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism observed with treatment of mild hypertension can vary significantly as a function of the drug used, despite similar beneficial effects on blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "A pharmacological approach was employed in order to visualize a Ca2(+)-dependent component of the extracellularly recorded nerve terminal impulse in the secretory regions of the sympathetic postganglionic nerves in the rat tail artery. Application of potassium-channel-blocking agents within the recording electrode caused the nerve terminal impulse to acquire a delayed negative deflection, which we have termed the late negative component (LNC) of the nerve terminal impulse. The time course and the latency of the LNC differed from that of the postjunctional transmitter-induced excitatory junction current, and the LNC persisted when the excitatory junction current was blocked by adenosine [alpha,beta-methylene]triphosphate, and was resistant to the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin and the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine. Probably, therefore, the LNC was exclusively prejunctional in origin. For the following reasons it seems likely that the LNC, at least in part, was caused by influx of Ca2+ into the secretory regions of these nerves: (a) the LNC occurred only when potassium-blocking agents were present within the recording electrode; (b) the LNC amplitude increased with the Ca2+ concentration inside the recording electrode and was reduced by the removal of Ca2+; (c) the LNC was enhanced by replacing Ca2+ in the medium inside the recording electrode with Ba2+; (d) the LNC was depressed by the inorganic Ca2(+)-channel blocker cadmium or the Ca2(+)-channel-blocking peptide omega-conotoxin added within the recording electrode only, or by addition of cadmium or cobalt (but not the organic Ca2(+)-channel blocker nifedipine) inside and outside the recording electrode.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "Increased dispersion of ventricular recovery time is believed to be a substrate for serious ventricular arrhythmias. Class III antiarrhythmic drugs probably operate by decreasing dispersion through homogeneous prolongation of recovery time. A single surface QT value gives no information on recovery time dispersion but interlead variation in QT may be relevant. QTc dispersion was measured in 67 patients post myocardial infarction randomized to treatment with either sotalol or placebo. QTc dispersion was calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum QTc in any surface electrocardiogram lead. Both maximum QTc and QTc dispersion varied considerably following infarction but throughout the 6-month follow-up period maximum QTc was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) and QTc dispersion significantly less (P less than 0.05) in patients on sotalol compared with placebo. These findings are in accord with expected changes in ventricular recovery time and provide strong support for the hypothesis that surface electrocardiogram QT variation reflects regional differences in ventricular recovery time.",

    "15": "The accumulation of the lipophilic cation radiolabeled triphenylmethylphosphonium (TPMP+) was utilized to determine the resting membrane potential across the plasma membrane (psi) of human sperm. Washed sperm were suspended and incubated in low-K+ and high-K+ medium and allowed to take up the cation to a steady state (20 min at 37 degrees C). By using this differential, the value obtained was inserted in the Nernst equation and the value yielded a psi of -69 +/- 2 mV. When the Na+ or K+ concentration is high in the medium, the accumulation of TPMP+ in the membrane sperm cells was increased or decreased, respectively, inducing hyperpolarization and depolarization of the membrane 20% and 85%, respectively. The presence of divalent cations Zn++ and Mg++ in the incubation medium both induced a hyperpolarization of 10% and 8.6%, respectively. The addition of specific reagents such as p-chloromercuribenzenosulfonate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid sodium salt both decreased the psi 35% and 58%, respectively. The agents acting on the sperm cell membrane, such as dithiothreitol and progesterone, both induced hyperpolarization and depolarization of the membrane 16% and 40%, respectively. The presence of propranolol and L-alpha-lysophosphatidylcholine, which affect the ionic gradients present across the plasma membrane, both induced a depolarization from 43% and 92%, respectively. Finally the psi was glucose-dependent. The result of these studies was that, by the use of agents causing hyperpolarization or depolarization, we obtained changes in the psi of -83.4 +/- 2.2 mV, until -6 +/- 0.6 mV changes of -76.8 +/- 2 mV translated across the sperm cell membrane.", 
    "16": "Effects of topical administration of a single dose of timolol maleate, a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, on intraocular pressure (IOP) and pupil diameter were evaluated in the normotensive eyes of 10 clinically normal cats over 12 hours. Mean (+/- SEM) normal IOP was 17.1 (+/- 1.1) mm of Hg and diurnal fluctuation was observed, with the highest IOP seen in the evening. Mean (+/- SEM) normal pupil diameter was 10.1 (+/- 0.5) mm. Topical treatment with 0.5% timolol resulted in reduction of IOP in treated and nontreated eyes. This effect was time-dependent and was first observed at 6 hours after treatment. Mean reduction of IOP was 22.3% in the treated eye and 16.3% in the nontreated eye. The treated eye had reduced pupil diameter at 30 minutes after treatment, and miosis persisted throughout the 12 hours of the study. Mean reduction of pupil diameter was 38.7%. A contralateral effect on pupil diameter was not seen in the nontreated eye. Topical administration of timolol maleate results in a reduction of IOP in treated and contralateral eyes, which supports the use of timolol for treatment of glaucoma in cats. In addition, the treated eye becomes miotic. This effect may indicate beta-adrenergic inhibition or alpha-adrenergic activation of the iris sphincter muscle. beta-Adrenergic blockade would then result in miosis.",

    "18": "Beta-Blockers are used in pregnancy-associated hypertension and in postnatal cardiac arrhythmias, and the neonate may get them in breast milk. We therefore studied the effects of beta-adrenergic medication on interrelations between heart rate (HR), respiration, and arterial blood pressure (aBP) in newborn lambs. The influence of sleep state on these cardiorespiratory interrelations was also examined. HR, aBP, and respiration (based on transthoracic electrical impedance) were recorded and the sleep state was visually documented in five healthy chronically instrumented newborn lambs before the age of 30 d. Propranolol was given (1 mg/kg). Two-min stationary segments of the three signals were analyzed using a multivariate autoregressive model, which yields oscillations of the signals and intersignal relationships as source contributions. The variabilities of aBP and HR were greatest at the low frequencies (less than 0.25 Hz) and so were their intersignal relationships (including baroreflex). The respiratory variability was greatest at the frequencies corresponding to the respiratory rate. During quiet sleep, the variabilities in HR, aBP, and respiration were lowest. The impact of respiratory oscillations on other signals increased but the impact of aBP variability decreased during quiet sleep. beta-Blockade and sleep state affected separately the cardiovascular and respiratory variables and their interrelations. beta-Blockade reduced HR and increased pulse pressure. The overall heart rate variability and the respiratory low-frequency contribution to heart rate variability decreased due to the beta-blockade. We postulate that the beta-adrenergic system is an important regulator of HR and HR variability in neonatal lambs and also of the low-frequency components of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "Cardiac responses to graded treadmill exercise were compared in conscious dogs before and after excision of the sinoatrial node (SAN) and adjacent tissue along the sulcus terminalis. The chronotropic and dromotropic responses to dynamic exercise were compared with and without selective muscarinic (atropine) and/or beta-adrenergic (timolol) blockade. With the SAN intact, cardiac acceleration was prompt during onset of exercise and in proportion to work intensity. Immediately after SAN excision (1-7 days), pacemaker activity exhibited marked instability in rate and pacemaker location, with rapid shifts between atrial and junctional foci. Soon thereafter (1-2 wk), subsidiary atrial pacemakers (SAPs) assumed the primary pacemaker function. Although the SAP foci demonstrated stable heart rates and atrioventricular (AV) intervals at rest and during exercise, heart rates at rest and during steady-state exercise were reduced 34% from corresponding levels in the SAN-intact state, both with and without selective autonomic blockade. For control of dromotropic function, animals with SAP foci showed pronounced shortening in AV interval in conjunction with exercise that was further exacerbated by pretreatment with atropine. Eight weeks after excision of the primary SAN pacemakers, direct electrophysiological mapping localized the SAP foci to either the inferior right atrium along the sulcus terminalis or the dorsal cranial right atrium (in or near Bachmann's bundle). Animals with SAPs localized to the inferior right atrium had a more marked suppression in heart rate with a corresponding greater decrease in AV interval during exercise than dogs with SAP foci identified within the dorsal cranial right atrium.", 
    "20": "The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of the radical scavenger (MTDQ-DA), Ca-antagonist (Verapamil) and ultrashort-acting beta-blocker (Brevibloc) on arachidonic acid metabolism and free radical mediated damage. In dog experiments, the left descending coronary artery (LAD) was ligated for 45 min or 90 min followed by one hour reperfusion. Blood samples were taken at different times of occlusion and recirculation for determination of 6-keto PGF1 alpha and TXB2. At the end of the experiments heart tissue samples were excised from injured areas and from the intact part of the left ventricular muscle. Malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as prostacyclin and thromboxane were determined in tissue samples. Free radical mediated damage (increased lipid peroxidation and exhaustion of endogenous scavengers) could be diminished significantly by antioxidant treatment and moreover, therapy of Verapamil and Brevibloc preserved reduced. It was characteristic that release of endoperoxides was present in each case but the highest values were measured in non-treated animals. Tissue content of prostacyclin and thromboxane varied in differently treated groups, however the altered ratio of PGF1 alpha and TXB2 showed strong influence of the antioxidatnt, Ca-antagonist and beta-blocker.", 
    "21": "One hundred forty-three patients with intraocular pressures (IOPs) above 22 mmHg and without visual field defects or any obvious evidence of optic nerve damage were randomly assigned to either a timolol treatment group or no treatment in a 6-year prospective clinical trial. Endpoints were defined as reproducible visual field defects on automatic perimetry, disc hemorrhages, or stereophotographically documented optic nerve head changes. Endpoints developed in 42 patients: 28 visual field defects, 8 changes in disc appearance, and 6 disc hemorrhages. Of the 42 patients, 20 were treated and 22 were not. Survival analysis showed no statistically significant differences in failure time to any endpoints between the two groups. In the untreated group, the time to failure of disc change was related to the mean IOP during the study and also to the changes in the IOP from baseline. A significant correlation was found between initial cup-to-disc ratio and survival time to visual field defects in the untreated group.",

Thirty-six women with hypertension, but without proteinuria, were allotted at random to a test group of 17 who received intensive treatment, and a control group of 19 who were managed according to routine methods by hospital staff unconnected with the study. The development of proteinuria was chosen as an indicator of pre-eclampsia. Proteinuria developed significantly more often in the control group (in six of the 19 women) than in the test group (in one of the 17 women).", 
    "23": "The effect of repetitive oral administration of propranolol on hepatic microsomal drug metabolizing enzyme activities in the rat was investigated. Propranolol ring (4-, 5- and 7-)hydroxylase activities were markedly decreased, but, interestingly, N-desisopropylase activity was increased after propranolol administration. A marked decrease in enzyme activity after propranolol pretreatment was also observed with debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation. In addition, a similar decrease was observed with imipramine 2-hydroxylation which co-segregates with debrisoquine/sparteine type polymorphic drug oxidation, but not with imipramine N-demethylation. These results suggest the selective impairment of debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase by propranolol pretreatment.", 
    "24": "The effect of felodipine on glucose tolerance was evaluated in 18 male type II diabetic patients treated with diet alone, who were hypertensive despite beta-blocker treatment. The study was a double-bind cross-over comparison of placebo and felodipine in addition to beta-blockade. Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed at randomization and at the end of each 4-week double-blind treatment period. The doses of felodipine given were 5 mg b.i.d. for 2 weeks followed by 10 mg b.i.d. for a further 2 weeks. Blood pressure was significantly reduced during felodipine treatment, whereas heart rate remained unaltered. HbA1c and fasting insulin levels did not change during the treatment periods. Fasting and maximal blood glucose levels were not altered between any of the treatment periods. However, there was a small but statistically significant increase (median increase 4%) in the area under the glucose concentration vs. time curve after felodipine as compared to placebo treatment. This increase was not considered to be clinically significant in the short term, but the finding merits further investigation in a rigorous long-term study.",

    "26": "The subjects were 36 hypertensive patients aged 61 to 79 years (mean, 66 years). After a placebo run-in period of one month, each patient was randomly assigned to two months of treatment with 100 mg of metoprolol, 50 mg of captopril, or 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide plus 2.5 mg of amiloride daily, or placebo. The doses were doubled if diastolic pressure was above 95 mm Hg after one month of treatment. Blood pressure, heart rate, and physical fitness (endurance during a standard cycle ergometer exercise) were measured and side effects assessed after each two-month treatment period. Mean blood pressures were significantly lower after treatment with metoprolol (154/92 mm Hg), captopril (157/92 mm Hg), and hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride (152/91 mm Hg) than after placebo (170/101 mm Hg). Heart rate was significantly lower after treatment with metoprolol (64 beats/minute) than after placebo (77 beats/minute). Exercise endurance was lower after treatment with metoprolol (498 seconds) and hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride (519 seconds) than after placebo (529 seconds) and higher after captopril (541 seconds). More patients reached the target exercise work load after captopril than after the other treatments. No patients withdrew from treatment because of side effects or abnormal laboratory test results. All three active treatments benefited the elderly hypertensive patients and did not lower their physical fitness. Captopril appeared to be more effective than the other two treatments.", 
    "27": "Following a 30% body surface area full-thickness open-flame burn, rats exhibited hypermetabolism, body weight loss, and muscle catabolism. Twenty-one days of treatment of one group of burned rats with the selective beta 2-adrenergic agonist, clenbuterol, increased resting energy expenditure and normalized body weight gain, muscle mass, and muscle protein content. Conversely, similar treatment of another group of burned rats with the long-acting beta-adrenergic antagonist, nadolol, reduced muscle mass, while having no effect on resting energy expenditure, body weight gain, or muscle protein content. These results demonstrate that hypermetabolism does not invariably result in loss of lean body mass and suggest that clenbuterol may be useful in preserving muscle mass and protein in catabolic diseases.", 
    "28": "Aqueous humor levels of pilocarpine and timolol in rabbits after administration of either 2% pilocarpine or 0.5% timolol in single-drug solutions were compared with the concentrations found after instillation of a fixed combination of 0.5% timolol and 2% pilocarpine drops. Time intervals considered were 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr after application. Drug concentrations were analyzed in individual aqueous samples by high-performance liquid chromatography. No statistically significant differences in either pilocarpine or timolol concentrations in aqueous humor were found at any time tested between the single-drug preparations and the combination.", 
    "29": "Thirty-five teenage patients with a history of presyncope or syncope underwent a passive head-up tilting to reproduce symptoms of syncope. If tilting alone did not induce syncope, isoproterenol infusion was given to increase heart rate to 150 to 160 beats per minute. In 80% of patients with a history of syncope, identical symptoms could be reproduced during tilting: an abrupt fall in blood pressure combined with profound nodal bradycardia, ranging from 32 to 86 beats per minute. These symptoms were quickly reversed by returning the patient to the supine position. For patients with frequent occurrences of syncope, especially when there was a history of trauma sustained during these episodes, a therapeutic regimen of either beta blockers or 9 alpha-fluorocortisol was begun. The mechanisms of this common cause of syncope in childhood is neurocardiogenic in response to venous pooling and catecholamine-induced tachycardia. The tilt test is an excellent and cost-effective test for the workup of unexplained syncope in childhood.", 
    "30": "In an attempt to gain further knowledge about the mechanism of action of recombinant interleukin-1 beta (rIL-1 beta) on rat pancreatic beta-cells, we studied the effects of short term rIL-1 beta exposure (50 U/ml for 1 h) on islet function over the next 72 h. There was an initial increase in glucose-induced insulin release, followed by a decrease in islet function, reaching a nadir (values of insulin release about 20% of those observed in control islets) 10-12 h after treatment with the cytokine. Thereafter, the islets recovered their function, reaching levels of insulin secretion similar to the control values after 72 h. Short term exposure to rIL-1 beta did not induce a decrease in either islet DNA or islet insulin content. Using this experimental approach, we tested whether 1-h incubation of islets in the presence of various agents plus rIL-1 beta could counteract the inhibitory effects of the cytokine 10-12 h later. Both actinomycin-D (5 micrograms/ml), an inhibitor of DNA transcription, and N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (0.1 mM), a protease inhibitor, could protect the islets. There was also a weak protection by dimethyl urea (61 mM), a free radical scavenger, but no protection by cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, or amiloride (12.5 microM), a blocker of Na+/H+ exchange. In a subsequent series of experiments, the islets were exposed for 6 h to different test agents after the initial 1-h exposure to rIL-1 beta. In this context, there was a clear protection by cycloheximide and actinomycin-D and a lesser protection by N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone. These data suggest that early steps of the actions of rIL-1 beta on rat pancreatic islets are mediated by protease activation and gene transcription, followed by protein synthesis. The identity of the protein(s) remains to be clarified.",

    "32": "The response to incremental doses of oral labetalol in 16 patients with hypertensive urgencies is presented. After inadequate blood pressure control with 20 mg of intravenous furosemide, each patient received a 300 mg oral dose of labetalol. Subsequent oral doses of labetalol, 100 mg, were administered at 2-hour intervals, if the diastolic blood pressure remained greater than 100 mm Hg. The maximum dose of labetalol per patient was 500 mg. Five patients required only the initial 300 mg dose of labetalol. Two patients required further therapy for satisfactory blood pressure control. Mean arterial pressure fell from 156 +/- 12 mm Hg to 123 +/- 14 mm Hg.", 
    "33": "The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd-YAG) laser photocoagulation of the atrioventricular (AV) node to control the ventricular rate during rapid atrial rhythms without creating AV block. In 12 dogs on normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, short laser pulses were delivered to an area between the coronary sinus orifice and the site of the most proximally recorded His deflection until second degree AV block occurred at a paced atrial rate of 200 beats/min. Long-term effects on AV node function were followed up for 3 months. Three animals developed chronic high grade AV block. In nine animals with preserved 1:1 conduction, the mean (+/- SEM) critical atrial cycle length resulting in AV node Wenckebach periodicity increased from 183 +/- 6 to 261 +/- 24 ms (+43%), the mean RR interval during induced atrial fibrillation increased from 248 +/- 14 to 330 +/- 27 ms (+32%) and the shortest RR interval during atrial fibrillation increased from 215 +/- 11 to 275 +/- 20 ms (+28%). Laser effects were not reversed by isoproterenol infusion. Histologic examination of the irradiated area showed fibrotic changes in the AV node and fatty metamorphosis. This study suggests that 1) graded Nd-YAG laser photocoagulation of the AV node region in dogs results in long-term modification of anterograde AV node transmission properties; 2) 1:1 conduction during sinus rhythm usually remains preserved, but ventricular rate during rapid atrial rhythms is chronically reduced; and 3) progression to high grade AV block occurs in a minority of animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "In a retrospective analysis 139 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were followed up for 8.9 years (range 1 to 28 years). Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 consisted of 60 patients with medical therapy and Group 2 of 79 patients with surgical therapy (septal myectomy). Groups 1 and 2 were subdivided according to the medical treatment. Group 1a received propranolol, 160 mg/day (n = 20); Group 1b verapamil, 360 mg/day (n = 18); and Group 1c, no therapy (n = 22). Group 2a received verapamil, 120 to 360 mg/day, after septal myectomy (n = 17) and Group 2b had no medical therapy after surgery (n = 62). In Group 1, 19 patients died (annual mortality rate 3.6%) and in Group 2, 17 patients died (mortality rate 2.4%, p = NS). Of the patients who died, approximately one half to two thirds in both Groups 1 and 2 died suddenly and the other one half to one third died because of congestive heart failure. The 10 year cumulative survival rate was 67% in Group 1, significantly smaller than that in Group 2 (84%, p less than 0.05). In the subgroups, the 10 year survival rate was 67% in Group 1a, 80% in 1b (p less than 0.05 versus 1a) and 65% in 1c (p less than 0.05 versus 1b). The 10 year survival rate was 100% in Group 2a (p less than 0.05 versus 1a, 1b, 1c) and 78% in Group 2b (p less than 0.05 versus 2a). It is concluded that cumulative survival rate is significantly better in surgically than in medically treated patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "Out of 37 infertile men, 33 who were able to give two ejaculates by masturbation successively with a sixty minute interval, were studied. There was no significant change in sperm density in the second ejaculation whereas seminal volume decreased (P less than 0.01) and sperm motility increased (P less than 0.05) significantly. After a seven-day treatment with combination of prazosin (alpha 1-blocker) and terbutaline (beta 2-stimulator), the same successive ejaculates were obtained from only 27 of these patients. In this case sperm density and motility changed insignificantly, whereas seminal volume again decreased (P less than 0.01) significantly. The changes in seminal parameters were not significant between the pre- and post-treatment second ones. In a short-term study there are not any alterations to observe. The favourable results with a long-term treatment, published by Japanese authors, require a confirmation by further studies.", 
    "36": "This paper presents evidence that phasic changes in T-wave amplitude vary as a function of task conditions and beta-adrenergic drugs. Three experiments were designed to test the sensitivity of T-wave amplitude to manipulations in sympathetic arousal. In the first experiment, T-wave amplitude was recorded during an active behavioral task in which 32 subjects believed that they could control the duration of an aversive white noise and during a passive behavioral task in which another 30 subjects knew that they had no control. T-wave amplitude decreased to a greater extent in the active behavior group than in the passive group. In the second experiment, 9 subjects receiving one of two beta-adrenergic blockers and 10 subjects receiving placebo completed the active task. Task-induced reductions in T-wave amplitude were systematically blocked by the beta blockers. In the third experiment, 5 subjects received placebos and 15 received one of two different beta blockers. All subjects performed a mental arithmetic task. Subjects receiving a placebo, but not those receiving beta blockade, exhibited a significant reduction in T-wave amplitude during mental arithmetic.", 
    "37": "Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) has received much attention in recent years due to the large body of evidence indicating that variations in this phenomenon represent alterations in parasympathetic cardiac control. Although it appears that respiratory sinus arrhythmia is mediated by vagal mechanisms, the extent to which the well-known respiratory influences (i.e., rate and tidal volume) on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (in altering its magnitude) may moderate the relationship between RSA and cardiac vagal tone has never been systematically studied. We addressed this issue by examining intraindividual relationships among RSA magnitude, respiration (rate and tidal volume), and heart period among six healthy male adults after intravenous administration of 10 mg propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker. Subjects were exposed to various behavioral tasks which altered all physiological variables measured. Variations in heart period after beta blockade were assumed to be predominantly vagally mediated. Within-subject regression analyses consistently showed that respiratory parameters influenced RSA magnitude, but not tonic variations in beta-blocked heart period, suggesting that respiratory-mediated RSA alterations are not associated with changes in cardiac vagal tone. Only when respiratory variables were statistically controlled was there evidence of a reasonable correspondence between beta-blocked heart period and RSA amplitude, providing support for the idea that respiratory parameters need to be controlled when using RSA amplitude as an index of cardiac vagal tone. Repeated-measures analyses of variance of mean levels of heart period and respiratory sinus arrhythmia across subjects supplemented and supported the intraindividual results. These findings point to the importance of controlling for respiratory parameters when using respiratory sinus arrhythmia as a cardiac vagal index.", 
    "38": "Several studies have demonstrated that focal mechanisms contribute to arrhythmogenesis during acute myocardial ischemia in vivo. However, the biochemical derangements during ischemia may either potentiate or depress the electrophysiological mechanisms leading to focal arrhythmias. In the study presented here we have characterized the consequences of various levels of cellular depression and of alterations in the extracellular environment on the development of early (EADs) and delayed (DADs) afterdepolarizations induced by catecholamines. Adult canine myocytes were exposed to: normoxia; hypoxia (pO2 less than 10 mmHg); hypoxia + high K+ or cyanide infusion. Early and delayed afterdepolarizations were induced by alpha or beta adrenergic stimulation in the different experimental conditions by infusing isoproterenol (10(-8)-10(-6) M) or phenylephrine (10(-7)-10(-5) M) + the betablocker nadolol. Hypoxia did not modify EADs or DADs induced by beta stimulation and potentiated DADs induced by alpha stimulation; hypoxia + high K+ blunted DADs induced by both types of stimulation and cyanide infusion completely prevented and suppressed them. Thus, triggered arrhythmias dependent upon adrenergic stimulation can either be potentiated or inhibited by the biochemical derangements of acute ischemia. Focal arrhythmias are more likely to occur in the borderline ischemic cells where cellular depression and extracellular K+ accumulation are less marked.", 
    "39": "Static incubation with tumor-promoting 4 beta-phorbol esters, activators of the Ca2(+)- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C enzyme (PKC), caused dose-dependent increases in gonadotropin (GTH) and growth hormone (GH) secretion in primary cultures of dispersed goldfish pituitary cells. The estimated half-maximal effective doses (ED50) for stimulating GTH and GH release were 0.35 +/- 0.17 and 0.32 +/- 0.13 nM 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13 acetate (TPA), 3.71 +/- 1.30 and 1.37 +/- 0.76 nM 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, 6.90 +/- 4.84 and 1.89 +/- 0.25 nM 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-dibenzoate, and 455 +/- 258 and 311 +/- 136 nM 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-diacetate, respectively. In contrast, treatments with up to 10 microM of the inactive 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate ester did not alter GTH and GH release. Additions of the synthetic diacylglycerol, dioctanoyl glycerol, also enhanced GTH and GH secretion in a dose-dependent manner and with ED50s of 1.73 +/- 0.83 and 1.73 +/- 1.19 microM, respectively. The GTH and GH responses to stimulation by TPA were attenuated by incubation with Ca2(+)-depleted medium containing EGTA or by treatment with the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil. Coincubation with the PKC inhibitor H7 reduced the GTH and GH responses to TPA. As in previous studies, additions of salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone (sGnRH) or chicken GnRH-II (cGnRH-II) induced GTH and GH release; these hormone responses to sGnRH and cGnRH-II were also decreased by the addition of H7. These results indicate that activation of PKC may stimulate GTH and GH release in goldfish and suggest that sGnRH and cGnRH-II actions on goldfish pituitary GTH and GH secretion are also mediated, at least partially, by PKC.", 
    "40": "We investigated the role of early portal hypotensive pharmacotherapy in preventing the development of portal-systemic shunting in a portal hypertensive model of chronic murine schistosomiasis induced by infecting C3H mice with 60 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni. Propranolol was administered in drinking water to 20 animals for a period of 6 wk at a dose of 10 mg.kg-1d-1, starting at 5 wk of schistosomal infection. 32 age-matched mice with chronic schistosomal infection served as controls. All animals were studied 11 wk after the infection. Compared with controls the portal pressure (10.8 +/- 0.40 mmHg) was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) in the propranolol-treated animals (7.9 +/- 0.80 mmHg). Portal-systemic shunting was decreased by 79%, from 12.2 +/- 3.34% in controls to 2.5 +/- 0.99% in the propranolol group (P less than 0.05). Portal venous inflow was reduced by 38% in the propranolol treated animals (2.50 +/- 0.73 ml/min; n = 6) compared with controls (4.00 +/- 0.34 ml/min; n = 8; P less than 0.05). The worm burden, the granulomatous reaction, the collagen content of the liver, and the serum bile acid levels were not significantly different between the two groups of animals. These results demonstrate that in chronic liver disease induced by schistosomiasis, the development of portal-systemic shunting can be decreased or prevented by the reduction of flow and pressure in the portal system.", 
    "41": "Experiments were undertaken to determine the efferent path of the Bainbridge reflex and to investigate the interaction of the Bainbridge reflex with the Bezold-Jarisch reflex in conscious, chronically instrumented dogs. The Bainbridge reflex was elicited by distending the left atrium by inflating a chronically implanted balloon catheter. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex was elicited using chemical stimulation of left ventricular receptors with infusions of veratridine (0.1-0.8 micrograms/kg/min) into the left circumflex coronary artery. Heart-rate responses to left atrial balloon inflation were compared before and after either beta-1 antagonism with metoprolol or cholinergic antagonism with atropine, and before and during left ventricular receptor stimulation with intracoronary veratridine. Left atrial balloon inflation alone caused a significant increase in heart rate (70.1 +/- 5 bpm), left atrial pressure (14 +/- 3 mmHg) and mean arterial blood pressure (10 +/- mmHg). Heart-rate responses to left atrial distension were inhibited, but not abolished by either cholinergic or beta-1 antagonism. Left atrial distension after both cholinergic and beta-1 antagonism abolished the heart-rate response to balloon inflation. These results indicate that the efferent component of the Bainbridge reflex has both a vagal and a sympathetic component in conscious dogs. Left atrial distension during simultaneous left ventricular receptor stimulation resulted in a significantly decreased tachycardia than did left atrial distension alone (26 +/- 3 bpm compared to 68 +/- 8 bpm in the control experiments). In addition, the slope of the heart rate vs left atrial pressure relationship was significantly inhibited by left ventricular receptor stimulation (1.8 +/- 0.2 bpm/mmHg compared to 5.7 +/- 0.3 bpm/mm Hg in the control experiments). There were no significant differences in either the left atrial pressure or arterial blood pressure changes between the two groups. These data suggest an interaction between these two reflexes that may be occurring in the central nervous system.", 
    "42": "Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographies were used to examine 102 hypertensive patients who were found to have pulmonary hypertension, whose manifestation was determined by the degree of arterial hypertension, cardiac contractile insufficiency and diminished left heart pump function. The degree of pulmonary hypertension was related to the hemodynamic type and maximal with hypokinetic circulation when the pump function of the heart was minimal. Obsidan caused a decrease in pulmonary and systemic arterial hypertension, producing higher effects with hypokinetic hemodynamics. Corinfar was demonstrated to attenuate pulmonary hypertension to a greater extent. Its action on systemic arterial hypertension was highest in patients with hyperkinetic circulation. Heterodirectional hemodynamic effects of these drugs make it expedient to study their combined action on the hemodynamic of hypertensive patients.", 
    "43": "The paper presents the results of the study into the efficacy of single routine doses of essential antihypertensive agents (nifedipine, propranolol, and hydrochlorothiazide) versus its course treatment at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercise tests. The efficacy was assessed by using the Dixon criterion. The routine drug dose tests performed at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercise were shown to have a varying informative value in the prediction of long-term treatment with the above drugs. The isometric and dynamic exercise tests are of the greatest significance in the evaluation of the antihypertensive routine dose of nifedipine, whereas the dynamic exercise test alone is of value for propranolol and the rest exercise test, the both exercise tests for hydrochlorothiazide. Thus, the results of the corresponding routine drug dose tests are of varying predictive informative value, which is essential both for choosing an effective drug and for making an objective assessment of the outcomes of the course therapy.", 
    "44": "Antiarrhythmic therapy was chosen for 3-7 days by modified chronic electrophysiological study at three stages: (1) the efficacy of a drug, its action onset and termination were defined; (2) a dosage was chosen on an individual basis and the duration of drug potency was specified; (3) the dosage regimen of a drug given as a course therapy was confirmed by the results of trials. Its choice was made on the basis of the oral administration of a tested drug and multiple programmed electric cardiostimulation. In late periods (3-37 months), the therapy was effective and safe in 51 (86%) of 59 patients. The drug regimens and doses were in poor agreement with conventional ones in 49% of the patients. The method proposed makes it possible to choose antiarrhythmic therapy on an individual basis and reduce the number of complications.",

Despite reduction of systemic arterial pressure induced by clofelin instillations, rheo-ophthalmography has shown enhanced blood stream in ocular vessels. 52 percent of patients were administered no miotics but only clofelin (16 patients, 28 eyes) or clofelin+timolol (11 patients, 17 eyes).", 
    "46": "The interaction between alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic receptors was investigated in rat cerebral cortical membranes. Clonidine inhibition of [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) binding resulted in biphasic competition curves with a mean Hill coefficient of 0.45. The addition of 1 microM yohimbine caused a rightward shift of the first portion of the clonidine inhibition curve. In the presence of 1 microM clonidine, the maximum concentration which did not inhibit [3H]DHA binding, inhibition curves of [3H]DHA binding by isoproterenol shifted to the right. A mean Hill coefficient increased from a control value of 0.63 to 0.76. Computer modeling analysis revealed that 1 microM clonidine decreased a beta-adrenergic high-affinity state from 28% to 13%. However, the addition of 1 microM yohimbine completely prevented the clonidine-induced reduction in the beta-adrenergic high-affinity state. In the presence of 200 microM GTP, the effect of clonidine was not observed. In addition, Kd and Bmax values for [3H]p-aminoclonidine ([3H]PAC) binding were not significantly changed by the addition of 100 nM isoproterenol, the maximum concentration which did not inhibit [3H]PAC binding. Moreover, isoproterenol inhibition of [3H]PAC binding resulted in steep competition curves with a mean Hill coefficient of 0.97. The addition of 1 microM alprenolol did not affect the isoproterenol inhibition curve. These data demonstrated that clonidine caused a decrease in agonist and antagonist affinity for beta-adrenergic receptors, while isoproterenol did not modulate the binding characteristics of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, these results suggest that regulation between alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic receptors is not bidirectional, but is instead unidirectional from alpha 2-adrenergic receptors to beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "47": "The metabolism of the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol is under genetic control of the debrisoquine/sparteine type. The two metabolic phenotypes, extensive (EM) and poor metabolizers (PM), show different stereoselective metabolism, resulting in apparently higher beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonistic potency of racemic metoprolol in EMs. We investigated if the latter also applies to the beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonism by metoprolol. The drug effect studied was the antagonism by metoprolol of terbutaline-induced hypokalemia. By using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic metoprolol and the active S-isomer, were quantitated in EMs and PMs in terms of IC50 values, representing metoprolol plasma concentrations resulting in half-maximum receptor occupancy. Six EMs received 0.5 mg of terbutaline s.c. on two different occasions: 1) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p.o. Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol, except for a higher terbutaline dose (0.75 mg) on day 2. Blood samples for the analysis of plasma potassium, terbutaline, metoprolol (racemic, R- and S-isomer), and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol concentrations were taken at regular time intervals, during 8 hr after metoprolol. In PMs, metoprolol increased the terbutaline area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (+67%). Higher metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol ratios in PMs were predictive for higher R-/S-isomer ratios of unchanged drug. There was a difference in metoprolol potency with higher racemic metoprolol IC50 values in PMs (72 +/- 7 ng.ml-1) than EMs (42 +/- 8 ng.ml-1, P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "Administration of platelet-activating factor (PAF) to portal venous circulation of anesthetized fed rats produced decreases in mean arterial pressure and increases in hepatic portal pressure and blood glucose concentration. These responses to PAF were dose dependent with ED50 values of 0.02-0.05 micrograms/kg and specific as lyso- and enantio-PAF did not reproduce effects of PAF. Specific PAF receptor antagonist SRI 63-675 (75 micrograms/kg) inhibited significantly these PAF (0.1 micrograms/kg)-induced responses in rats. Administration of prazosin (500 micrograms/kg) and propranolol (400 micrograms/kg) to rats abolished phenylephrine (50 micrograms/kg)-induced increases in mean arterial pressure, hepatic portal pressure, and blood glucose concentration but did not prevent PAF (1 microgram/kg)-induced alterations in these parameters. Glycogen phosphorylase alpha levels were increased significantly in livers of rats after administration of PAF (1 microgram/kg) or phenylephrine (50 micrograms/kg). Administration of prazosin and propranolol to rats inhibited phenylephrine- but not PAF-induced activation of hepatic glycogen phosphorylase. Hepatic adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) concentration was increased slightly by PAF, but these increases were eliminated by adrenergic blockade, suggesting that activation of hepatic glycogen phosphorylase by PAF is not dependent on increases in cAMP. Increases in hepatic portal pressure and blood glucose concentration in response to PAF (0.1 micrograms/kg) were not attenuated in adrenalectomized rats. Moreover, PAF (0.1 micrograms/kg) stimulated increases in hepatic portal pressure after administration of the ganglionic blocking agent chlorisondamine (2.5 mg/kg) to adrenalectomized rats. Administration of PAF (0.05 micrograms/kg) to rats instrumented with pulse Doppler flow probes produced decreases in hepatic arterial and portal vein blood flow and increases in hepatic arterial and portal vascular resistance. These observations provide direct evidence that PAF regulates hepatic hemodynamics and glycogenolysis in vivo. It is suggested that PAF plays an important role in regulating hepatic blood flow and supplying extrahepatic tissues with energy substrates by sympathetic-independent mechanism(s) after its release in acute pathophysiological situations.", 
    "49": "Aqueous flow was measured fluorophotometrically in New Zealand white rabbits after unilateral decentralization of the cervical ganglion or cervical ganglionectomy to determine the role of ocular adrenergic input in regulating the circadian rhythm of aqueous flow. Both surgical procedures decreased the rate of aqueous flow during the dark phase when flow is high. During the light phase when flow is low, cervical ganglionectomy increased aqueous flow; decentralization may have increased flow also, but the increases were not statistically significant. Aqueous flow was also measured in normal rabbits after topical application of timolol during the light or dark to determine whether beta-adrenergic receptors play a role in controlling the circadian rhythm of flow. Timolol produced a small reduction of the rate of aqueous flow when applied topically during the dark but not during the light. These results suggest that part of the increase of aqueous flow during the dark phase is produced by adrenergic input to the ciliary processes and that beta-adrenergic receptors mediate part of this increase.", 
    "50": "To examine the effects of oxygen free radicals on alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, rat heart crude membranes were incubated with xanthine plus xanthine oxidase, H2O2, or H2O2 plus Fe2+. The assay of beta-adrenergic receptors involving [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding revealed that the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) were increased by xanthine plus xanthine oxidase. H2O2 increased the Kd value for [3H]DHA binding. When a hydrophilic ligand, [3H]CGP-12177, was used for the beta-adrenergic receptor assay, an increase in Kd value without any changes in Bmax value was evident on treating the membranes with xanthine plus xanthine oxidase. The assay of alpha-adrenergic receptors involving [3H]prazosin binding showed a decrease in the number of binding sites and an increase in Kd value only after a prolonged period of incubation. Both H2O2 and H2O2 plus Fe2+ increased the Kd value for [3H]prazosin without changes in Bmax. Changes in both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors similar to those with crude membranes were also seen by employing the purified heart sarcolemmal membranes. These data indicate that adrenergic receptors in the sarcolemmal membranes are modified by oxygen free radicals.", 
    "51": "Adrenergic regulation of type II T4 5'-deiodinase (5'-D) activity has been studied in the rat pineal gland during development. Nocturnal increases in 5'-D activity gradually rose from the second week of age until the sixth week. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, stimulated 5'-D activity during the daytime; however, the pattern of stimulation during development was slightly different from nocturnal activation of the enzyme, since pineal 5'-D activity could be clearly activated by isoproterenol from the first week of age. Isoproterenol activation of the enzyme always reached more than 70% of nocturnal values at all ages studied. Phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, did not increase the enzyme activity. Another selective alpha-adrenergic agonist, methoxamine, as well as clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, were ineffective in stimulating the enzyme, while norepinephrine or terbutaline, a beta-adrenergic agonist, clearly activated it. Additional results showing a role for alpha-adrenergic receptors on pineal 5-D activity were obtained when alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers were used. Thus, propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, clearly prevented pineal 5'-D activation in both 2- and 6-week-old rats when the gland was stimulated by either norepinephrine or darkness at night. However, prazosin, a selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blocker, also prevented the norepinephrine-induced or darkness-induced activation of the enzyme in 2-week-old rats, although it was ineffective when used in 6-week-old rats. Moreover, at night and after 3 h of exposure to darkness, phenylephrine was able to activate the enzyme. Results strongly suggest a role for alpha-adrenergic receptors, in addition to beta-adrenergic receptors, in regulating rat pineal 5'-D activity during development.", 
    "52": "In the simultaneous presence of 5.5 mM glucose, exposure of isolated perifused islets to the sulfonylurea glyburide (500 nM) acutely stimulated insulin release and amplified the subsequent insulin secretory responses to 10 mM glucose or 10 mM arginine. This sensitizing effect of glyburide developed within 10 min, was maintained for at least 40 min after glyburide removal from the perifusion medium, and was attenuated by the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine. In islets whose inositol-containing lipids were prelabeled during a 2-hr incubation period with myo[2-3H]inositol, glyburide induced a concentration-dependent increase in labeled inositol phosphate accumulation. Nitrendipine abolished this stimulatory effect of glyburide. In perifused islets, the stimulatory effect of glyburide on phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis persisted after its removal from the medium and the duration of this effect paralleled the duration of sensitization. These findings suggest that glyburide-induced increases in PI hydrolysis account, at least in part, for its acute stimulatory effect on insulin output and its ability to sensitize islets to subsequent stimulation.", 
    "53": "Characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors were analyzed using radioligand-binding techniques with 3H-dihydroalprenolol in lung specimens from 11 children with pulmonary hypertension (median age, three years) undergoing surgical repair of congenital heart defects and four pediatric control subjects (median age, five years) undergoing thoracotomy for removal of neoplasms or cysts. Scatchard analysis of 3H-DHA binding to lung membranes showed similar values of the dissociation constant in both groups (Kd = 0.72 +/- 0.22 nM in patients vs 1.22 +/- 0.22 nM in controls; p = NS). The receptor density was significantly increased in patients in comparison with controls, with respective values of 164 +/- 19 and 95 +/- 13 fmol/mg of protein (p less than 0.025), and correlated directly with mean pulmonary arterial pressure (r = 0.82; p less than 0.0005). No significant relationship was observed between receptor number and pulmonary arterial medial thickness. Thus, the increase in receptor density in these patients may be related to adaptative changes in cells other than vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "54": "The close relationship between diabetes and hypertension has been recognized for decades. New information indicates that resistance to insulin action on glucose uptake in peripheral tissues is a common underlying mechanism in hypertension and diabetes. In prospective trials, the effects of antihypertensive agents on insulin sensitivity and lipoprotein metabolism have been evaluated. Both beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics worsen insulin resistance and deteriorate lipoprotein metabolism. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Ca2(+)-channel blockers, and alpha-blockers are neutral or improve these factors. These data may explain the unexpectedly high incidence of the development of diabetes among treated hypertensives and the poor effect on risk for coronary heart disease in intervention trials.", 
    "55": "An analysis of heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) was based on quantifying the number and amplitude of HR fluctuations over long (8-30 cycles) and short (2-4 cycles) sequences of acceleration and deceleration-forming oscillations. The 'product' (number times amplitude) is an equivalent of the power spectrum in the frequency domain. In the time domain, positive correlations with HR were found for the number of long (L) sympathetic-mediated oscillations, whereas they were negative for short (S) vagally-mediated oscillations. The L/S ratio, an index of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) balance, closely paralleled the circadian HR values. HRV was studied in the ambulatory ECG of three groups of 15 normal adults (group I), 13 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, group II) and 13 patients with heart failure (HF, group III). In basic conditions the mean HR was 77.1 +/- 1.9 beats min-1 (mean +/- SEM) in group I, 76.8 +/- 3.3 in II, 79.5 +/- 3.5 in III (P = NS). The different types of oscillations had smaller 24-h average values of the product in groups II and III than in group I, but the trends did not reach significance. However, the pooled 24 hourly values of the L/S ratio in group I (1.17 +/- 0.09) were lower than in group II (1.33 +/- 0.06, P less than 0.05 at Ancova) and higher than in group III (1.06 +/- 0.09, P less than 0.001). A 3-day treatment with acebutolol non-uniformly slowed the mean HR:--9.5% in group I, --18.1% in II and -19.1% in III (P less than 0.001), and uniformly diminished the L/S ratio by 17% to 20% (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, the sympathetic predominance of the ANS balance in LVH and HF is reflected by the beta-blockade induced HR decrease that is twice as marked in patients as in controls. In basic conditions HRV tends to be depressed in LVH and even more in HF. The ANS imbalance, however, has different modalities depending on the presence of HF, probably because of the different status of beta-adrenergic receptors in this condition.", 
    "56": "The short-term effects of atenolol and nifedipine on plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone (PA) were studied in two groups of patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. Urinary catecholamines, and sodium and potassium excretion were also studied. A group of 20 patients with hypertension, after a wash-out period of at least 10 days, was randomly subdivided into two protocol therapy subgroups. One group (six men and four women) received atenolol (100 mg/d), and the other group (six men and four women) received nifedipine (30 mg/d). Circulating plasma levels of ANP, PRA, and PA were determined by radioimmunoassay, and other variables were determined by routine laboratory techniques before therapy and at day 3 and day 7 after the treatment began. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were monitored during the study. Both drugs reduced arterial blood pressure (P less than .001) significantly. The atenolol therapy decreased heart rate (P less than .001), increased plasma ANP levels and urinary catecholamine excretion, and decreased PRA and circulating PA levels. Nifedipine treatment did not modify plasma ANP values, whereas it increased PRA and PA circulating levels and urinary catecholamine excretion. No differences were shown for urinary volume, urinary sodium, and potassium excretions during the two different treatments. These findings suggest that the increased plasma ANP levels could contribute to the antihypertensive effects of the beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, by a reduction in PRA and PA levels and a vasodilatative effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "Cardiovascular hypertrophy, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, and arteriolar hypertrophic changes are common in established hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy, in particular, markedly increases the risk of cardiovascular complications and death. The ability of an antihypertensive agent to reverse hypertrophic changes could, therefore, be greatly advantageous. Clinical studies with beta-blockers have shown them able to substantially reduce left ventricular hypertrophy. For reversal of arteriolar hypertrophy, vasodilatory beta-blockers have been shown to be preferable to ordinary beta-blockers, possibly because vasodilation reduces vascular smooth-muscle tone, which may facilitate reversal of hypertrophy. Theoretically, a vasodilatory beta-blocker, such as celiprolol, would therefore appear to offer advantages because of its ability to reverse left ventricular and arteriolar hypertrophy in addition to its antihypertensive action. The practical and clinical effects of cardiovascular hypertrophy reversal remain to be fully evaluated; however, it is logical to assume that they would be of considerable benefit to the hypertensive patient.", 
    "58": "Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), the active principle in Ligusticum wallichii, D-timolol, and L-timolol were compared for their effects on retinal and choroidal blood flow (RCBF), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR). TMP (10 mg.kg-1) increased RCBF by 44% and did not affect systemic BP or HR. D-Timolol (4 mg.kg-1 iv) had a tendency to increase RCBF but did not affect systemic BP and HR either. L-Timolol (0.4 mg.kg-1 iv), on the other hand, decreased RCBF by 18% and reduced both systemic BP and HR. In isolated preparations, TMP increased coronary artery blood flow with slight vasodilation, but vasoconstriction in renal, femoral and mesenteric arteries. These results indicate that TMP could be used to prevent or alleviate certain ischemic retinal degenerations without producing significant cardiovascular side effects. The in vitro vasoconstriction actions of TMP (0.2 mg.ml-1) were blocked by propranolol and phenoxybenzamine, indicating that adrenergic mechanism might be involved in TMP action.", 
    "59": "Effects of captopril, clonidine, hydralazine, metoprolol, and prazosin on the circadian variability of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) as well as on BP and HR rises at awakening were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). An on-line computerized system was used for continuous intraarterial (i.a.) recording of BP and HR. Drugs were infused intravenously (i.v.) with osmotic minipumps. Circadian BP patterns were more pronounced and variable in SHR than in Wistar-Kyoto normotensive control rats. HR patterns were similar in both groups. Antihypertensive treatment resulted in differential effects on the expression of the circadian BP and HR patterns in SHR. Reductions in BP variability and reductions in the awakening increase in BP were not correlated with the BP-lowering efficacy of agents. Treatment with clonidine reduced both circadian variability of BP and HR and the awakening increase. Prazosin reduced circadian BP variability and its awakening increase, whereas metoprolol reduced circadian HR variability only. Hydralazine and captopril did not cause any major effects on the circadian variability of BP and HR. These data indicate that circadian rhythms of BP and HR are under sympathetic control in SHR and are not influenced by nonsympatholytic vasodilators.", 
    "60": "Using micropuncture techniques in euvolemic adult male Munich-Wistar rats, we assessed the functional role of renal beta-adrenoceptors in mediating neural control of glomerular filtration and proximal tubular reabsorption. The determinants of nephron filtration and rate of proximal tubular reabsorption were measured in two groups of animals before and after acute surgical renal denervation (DNX). Group A animals (n = 6) were pretreated with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (25 mg/kg body weight per day for 4-6 days). Group B animals (n = 7) served as non-beta-blocked controls. Acute renal DNX resulted in no significant change in nephron filtration rate or any of its determinants in either group. Acute DNX caused similar decrements in the rate of fluid reabsorption from the proximal convoluted tubule of beta-blocked and control rats. Loop of Henle fluid reabsorption did not appear to be affected by DNX in either group. Because the effect of denervation on proximal tubular reabsorption was not conditioned by prior beta-blockade, the beta-adrenoceptors present within the proximal convoluted tubule do not appear to be the primary mediators of the adrenergic influence on fluid transport in that segment of the nephron.", 
    "61": "UD-CG 115 BS produced a positive inotropic effect in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 9.2 x 10(-5) M, efficacy = 0.65) in isolated canine ventricular muscle. UD-CG 212 Cl also elicited a positive inotropic effect (EC50 = 1.9 x 10(-7) M, efficacy = 0.23); its potency was higher, but its efficacy was much less than that of UD-CG 115 BS. Although the effect of UD-CG 115 BS was not altered by a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, bupranolol (3 x 10(-7) M), the response to UD-CG 212 Cl in high concentrations became transient in the presence of bupranolol: After reaching a peak, the force decreased gradually to the control level at greater than or equal to 10(-4) M. Both UD-CG 115 BS and UD-CG 212 Cl elevated the cyclic AMP level, but to a much smaller extent than other newly developed cardiotonic agents such as amrinone, milrinone, enoximone, and piroximone. Carbachol (3 x 10(-6) M) abolished the accumulation of cyclic AMP produced by these agents while it suppressed the maximum contractile response to UD-CG 115 BS by only 30%. The positive inotropic effect of UD-CG 212 Cl was converted to a negative effect by carbachol. Both UD-CG 115 BS and UD-CG 212 Cl produced a leftward shift in the concentration-response curve for the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol. These results suggest that an elevation of cyclic AMP levels owing to cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibition may be predominantly responsible for the positive inotropic effect of UD-CG 212 Cl but that a cyclic AMP-independent mechanism may contribute significantly to the positive inotropic effect of UD-CG 115 BS. UD-CG 212 Cl (greater than 3 x 10(-6) M) elicits a negative inotropic effect that is unmasked by beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "62": "Beta-blockers and calcium antagonists have been claimed to possess cardioprotective properties. This study addresses the question of whether a significant amount of these drugs will reach the cardiac myocytes during no-flow ischemia, where solute transport depends solely on diffusion. In anesthetized cats the hearts were excised. Apparent diffusion coefficients in cat myocardium at 37 degrees C (D'37) for 14C-verapamil (protein bound), 3H-metoprolol (lipophilic), 3H-atenolol (hydrophilic), and 3H-propranolol (lipophilic and protein bound) were determined by means of a \"true transient diffusion\" method and compared with the free diffusion coefficients in water (D37). D'37 of 14C-verapamil, 3H-metoprolol, 3H-atenolol, and 3H-propranolol (in cm2 s-1 10(5)) were (mean +/- SEM) 0.025 +/- 0.002, 0.055 +/- 0.003, 0.041 +/- 0.007, and 0.025 +/- 0.002, respectively. The mean diffusive progression of the concentration profile of 3H-metoprolol and 3H-atenolol into the tissue during 20 min was calculated to be 0.36 and 0.31 mm, respectively. The protein binding of 14C-verapamil and 3H-propranolol caused a significant fall in the progression to 0.24 mm for both drugs. These results indicate that, by diffusion, these drugs traverse the tissue too slowly to reach a significant amount of myocardium before myocyte necrosis occurs during conditions of noflow. Cardioprotective drugs are probably most effective, provided sufficient amounts are present in the tissue prior to the ischemic episode or sufficient supply via collateral blood flow is achieved.", 
    "63": "Prism-CLR is a closed loop, rate modulating pacemaker that uses ventricular depolarization gradient (Gd) to continuously adjust heart rate. Heart rate response to a formal mental stress protocol, esmolol (500 mcg/kg bolus, 75-125 mcg/kg/min infusion), and mental stress during esmolol infusion were studied in six patients to investigate if Gd and paced heart rate response are under direct beta-adrenergic control. Paced heart rates increased in response to mental stress in a physiological manner (P less than 0.001). Response to esmolol infusion was paradoxical, with increased paced heart rates during esmolol bolus and infusion (P less than 0.05). There was no significant alteration in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure during mental stress or esmolol infusion (P greater than 0.05). Paradoxical increase in paced heart rates during esmolol administration suggests a primary or secondary effect of esmolol to decrease the ventricular depolarization gradient. This hypothesis was supported in four dog studies in which direct Gd measurements were made during esmolol infusion. Mental stress during esmolol infusion resulted in significantly increased paced heart rates (esmolol effect) with blunted changes in heart rate in response to the mental stress. The results of this study suggest that the physiological rate response during mental stress is attributable to sympathetic autonomic response.", 
    "64": "We have investigated the effect of isoproterenol on endothelin-induced Ca2+ mobilization in A10 vascular smooth muscle cells. Endothelin (ET) stimulates a rapid and sustained elevation of intracellular Ca2+ mediated by production of inositol phosphates, release of intracellular Ca2+, and activation of a plasmalemmal Ca2+ influx pathway. This influx pathway appears to be a L-type channel because it is inhibited by nicardipine and activated by BAY K 8644. Depolarization of the cells, by elevating extracellular K+, activated a pharmacologically similar channel and produced a similar change in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Preincubation of cells with isoproterenol reduced the peak Ca2+ response to endothelin and blocked the sustained elevation. However, isoproterenol did not alter K(+)-induced Ca2+ entry. Thus it appears that ET-induced entry is mediated by intracellular signals and not by depolarization. With the use of cells incubated in Ca2(+)-free medium containing 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, isoproterenol was shown to inhibit Ca2+ release from intracellular pools by 36 +/- 3%. Furthermore, isoproterenol pretreatment or addition of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) to saponin-permeabilized cells inhibited inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3]-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular sites. Similar effects were seen with forskolin. Propranolol reversed the inhibitory effects of isoproterenol. Isoproterenol pretreatment also inhibited the rapid formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and [2-3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate stimulated by endothelin and reduced the sustained formation of these compounds. Finally, isoproterenol and forskolin led to a greater than 10-fold increase in intracellular cAMP levels. This stimulation of adenylate cyclase by isoproterenol was completely blocked by propranolol. It appears then that the beta-agonist isoproterenol interacts with a beta-adrenergic receptor, elevates cAMP, and thereby alters endothelin-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Inhibition of Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation, reduction in the responsiveness of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 intracellular receptor, and perhaps inhibition of ET-induced Ca2+ entry appear to be involved.", 
    "65": "Beta-adrenergic drugs affect lens epithelial and fiber cells. The regulation and cellular integration of lens beta-adrenergic responses are largely unknown. These studies further characterize beta-adrenergic receptors in lens cells with respect to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and identification of receptor polypeptides. Stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in organ-cultured chick lenses resulted in dose-dependent increases in intracellular cAMP levels. Isoproterenol-elicited cAMP accumulation was found in both epithelial/superficial fiber cells and cortical fiber cells. Hormonal stimulation also apparently initiated additional mechanisms involved in the regulation of cAMP levels (ie, phosphodiesterase activation/receptor desensitization). Individual receptor polypeptides were identified in epithelial and fiber membranes with the photoaffinity probe 125I-iodocyanopindolol diazarine. The probe specifically labeled distinct populations of receptor polypeptides in the two cell types. Lens beta-adrenergic receptors were also shown to bind (-) stereoisomers of adrenergic ligands preferentially. These results indicate that differentiating fiber cells are hormonally sensitive to beta-adrenergic stimulation and that epithelial and fiber cells may respond differentially to beta-adrenergic drugs, at least in part, because of their distinct receptor polypeptides.", 
    "66": "Sotalol is a unique beta-blocking drug, possessing significant class III antiarrhythmic activity. The efficacy and safety of 2 doses of sotalol (320 and 640 mg/day, divided in 2 doses) were compared to placebo in a 6-week randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of 114 patients with chronic ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) at frequencies of greater than or equal to 30/hour. Sotalol significantly reduced VPCs in patients receiving both low (n = 38) and high (n = 39) doses, compared with patients (n = 37) receiving placebo (by 75 and 88%, respectively, vs 10%; p less than 0.001, sotalol vs placebo; p less than 0.05, high vs low dose). The individual efficacy criterion (greater than or equal to 75% VPC reduction) was achieved in 34% of low-dose and 71% of high-dose sotalol versus 6% of placebo-treated patients (p less than 0.003, sotalol vs placebo; p = 0.007, high vs low dose). Repetitive beats were suppressed 25% by placebo (difference not significant), 80% by low-dose (p less than 0.003) and 78% by high-dose sotalol (p less than 0.005). Sotalol decreased heart rate (by 24 to 25%, p less than 0.001) and increased PR (by 4 to 6%, p less than 0.001) and corrected JT intervals (by 12 to 13%, p less than 0.001), but did not change ejection fraction. Proarrhythmia (nonfatal) occurred in 3 sotalol and in 2 placebo patients. Nine discontinued therapy because of adverse effects (1 low dose and 8 high dose, p less than 0.02). In summary, sotalol is an efficacious antiarrhythmic drug for VPC suppression; in lower doses, it is somewhat less effective but better tolerated.", 
    "67": "RBL 2H3 cells (a model of mast cell function) were sensitized with anti-TNP IgE (0.5 micrograms/ml) and triggered to secrete both histamine and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites by the addition of TNP-OVA (0 to 100 ng/ml). After a 3-min delay, the release of both groups of mediators proceeded in a parallel manner. In cells labeled with [14C]-AA, TNP-OVA produced a rapid increase in phosphatidic acid (PA), and subsequently, 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and intracellular AA levels. Concurrently, there was a decrease in [14C]-AA labeled phosphatidylcholine. The release of labeled AA from phosphatidylcholine in response to TNP-OVA was paralleled by a liberation of free choline but no evidence of liberation of phosphorylcholine. When ethanol (0.05 to 2% v/v) was included in the culture medium, phosphatidylethanol was synthesized at the expense of PA and DAG, with a resulting inhibition of secretion. D,1 propranolol, an inhibitor of PA phosphohydrolase, inhibited the IgE-dependent production of [14C]-DAG, and [14C]-free fatty acid but not [14C]-PA. The IgE-dependent release of both histamine and AA metabolites was completely inhibited by pretreatment with propranolol. Taken together, the above results suggest that phospholipase D is activated upon cross-bridging of IgE receptors on the surface of RBL 2H3 cells and that this may be a pivotal step in the signal transduction cascade leading to the release of both presynthesized and de novo synthesized mediators.", 
    "68": "The present study was carried out to investigate the effects of porcine galanin-(1-29), N-terminal fragment galanin-(1-10), C-terminal fragment galanin-(15-29), and the middle fragment galanin-(7-16) on the spontaneous tension of the opossum internal anal sphincter and on the decrease in the resting internal anal sphincter tension in response to neural stimulation by electrical field stimulation. Galanin and galanin-(1-10) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the resting tension of internal anal sphincter and an augmentation of the percent decrease in the resting tension with electrical field stimulation. Galanin-(15-29), on the other hand, produced an increase in the resting tension of the internal anal sphincter and had no effect on the electrical field stimulation-induced decrease in the resting tension. Galanin-(7-16) produced no significant effect on the internal anal sphincter. The decrease in the internal anal sphincter tension by galanin and galanin-(1-10) was partially antagonized by tetrodotoxin, whereas the increase in the internal anal sphincter tension caused by galanin-(15-29) was not modified by tetrodotoxin. In contrast to its effect in the internal anal sphincter, galanin caused an increase in the resting tension and suppressed a decrease in the lower esophageal sphincter tension in response to electrical field stimulation. From these findings we conclude that (a) galanin exerts an inhibitory effect on the internal anal sphincter by activating galanin receptors both at the intramural inhibitory neurons and at the internal anal sphincter smooth muscle and that the N-terminal portion of galanin may be responsible for these actions; (b) the contractile action of galanin is produced by its action on the smooth muscle; and (c) the actions of galanin on the gastrointestinal tract are tissue specific.", 
    "69": "Palmitoyl carnitine and lysophosphatidylcholine have been implicated in the generation of cardiac arrhythmias in the ischemic myocardium. These amphiphilic compounds are structurally similar to platelet-activating factor (PAF). The present study compared the hypotensive effect of these compounds to PAF in the anesthetized rat. Palmitoyl carnitine was about 1000 times less potent than PAF in lowering the blood pressure. Lysophosphatidylcholine and other structurally related compounds, in dosages similar to that of palmitoyl carnitine, had no significant hypotensive action. CV 3988, a PAF antagonist, blocked the hypotensive action of PAF but had no effect on the hypotensive action of palmitoyl carnitine. This suggested the effect of palmitoyl carnitine was not associated with the same site or mechanism as PAF. The results also ruled out the involvement of prostaglandin formation and of the sympathetic nervous system since indomethacin, phenoxybenzamine and propranolol did not affect the hypotensive action of palmitoyl carnitine. In addition, it is unlikely that palmitoyl carnitine exerted its effect by a direct membrane-perturbing action because lysophosphatidylcholine, which possesses similar amphiphilic properties, does not share the same hypotensive effect.", 
    "70": "The effects of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists carazolol, celiprolol, indenolol and propranolol on myocardial Mg(2+)-dependent, Na(+)- and K(+)-activated adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, EC 3.6.1.3) were compared with those of ouabain in guinea-pig heart preparations. All four drugs inhibited the enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent fashion similar to that shown by ouabain. Celiprolol exerted inhibitory actions (5-95%) in the concentration range of 0.5-3000 microM, while propranolol showed similar activity in the range of 100-4000 microM. Carazolol and indenolol exhibited intermediary effects. Their inhibitory effective ranges were 95-4000 and 10-5000 microM, respectively. The concentrations for half maximal inhibition of the enzyme activity were 0.74 +/- 0.12 mM for carazolol, 0.62 +/- 0.09 mM for celiprolol, 0.80 +/- 0.11 mM for indenolol and 1.03 +/- 0.19 mM for propranolol. Accordingly, the rank order of their potencies exhibited the following trend: celiprolol greater than carazolol greater than indenolol greater than propranolol. The present results show that these drugs exhibit inhibitory actions on the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity, which may be suggested as a possible biochemical basis for their proarrhythmic effects.", 
    "71": "The significance and site of adrenergic receptors involved in the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) activity was assessed indirectly by estimation of serum corticosterone levels 1 h after drug administration to conscious rats. Adrenergic drugs were given intracerebroventricularly (icv) and intraperitoneally (ip), the antagonists 15 min prior to the agonists. Noradrenaline, adrenalin and isoproterenol given by either route increased dose-dependently the serum corticosterone levels. The corticosterone response to icv noradrenaline was almost abolished by icv pretreatment with propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, and yohimbine, and alpha 2-receptor blocker, and was also considerably reduced by prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist. When given ip, these antagonists did not significantly influence the noradrenaline induced corticosterone response, which suggests a suprapituitary site of action of noradrenaline in stimulation of the HPA. The corticosterone response to icv adrenalin was suppressed by prazosin given by either route. The corticosterone response to ip adrenalin was almost abolished by pretreatment with yohimbine, and also significantly diminished by propranolol given by the same route. The increase in corticosterone secretion, induced by isoproterenol given by either route, was abolished by ip injection of propranolol. These results indicate that noradrenaline stimulates the HPA via alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, mainly at the suprapituitary level. Adrenalin increases that activity both via central and pituitary alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. Isoproterenol activates the HPA by stimulation of pituitary beta-receptors.", 
    "72": "We studied 78 consecutive patients with dilatative cardiomyopathy who were in our hospital because of heart failure. We wanted to evaluate which parameters could be useful in identifying patients who could be treated with betablockers. All patients were hemodynamically well balanced. They were treated with effective dosage of digoxin and diuretics. We evaluated the following hemodynamic parameters: heart rate, mean arterial pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP), right atrial pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, cardiac output, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, and also the neurohumoral parameters: VO2, max exercise duration, plasmatic norepinephrine levels (NE) and plasmatic renin activity (PRA). Then all patients were treated with atenolol 25 mg/die followed by 50 mg/die. In the overall population, 37 patients well tolerated the therapy with betablocker (Group A); 41 patients did not tolerate the therapy (Group B). Between the 2 groups we only found a significant difference in MPAP 31 +/- 20 vs 51 +/- 31 mmHg (p = 0.02), NE 781 +/- 467 vs 1551 +/- 1249 pg/ml (p = 0.01), PRA 1.8 +/- 2.9 vs 5.6 +/- 4.5 ng/ml/h (p = 0.02). On the basis of our results we hypothesize that patients with high neurohumoral activation do not tolerate betablocker treatment.", 
    "73": "Excretion of pyridinoline and polypeptide-bound hydroxyproline with urine was studied in 27 children with hereditary impairment of connective tissue. At the same time, effects of beta-adrenoblocking agents and vitamin complex, prescribed during preoperation period before thoracoplasty in hereditary chest deformation, were investigated. Clinical efficiency of the treatment depended distinctly on the initial value of ratios pyridinoline/creatinine and polypeptide-bound hydroxyproline/creatinine. Total positive effect of the therapeutic course, considering also echocardiographic examination and postoperational complications, was observed in 44% of patients with Ehlers-Dunlop syndrome and in 75% of patients with Marfan syndrome.", 
    "74": "A study was made of the role of the adrenergic processes in the activation of the testes endocrine function in male mice of CBA/Lac and A/He strains after their sexual arousal induced by the presence of a sexually receptive female without any tactile contact with a male. The alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin inhibited an increase of testosterone level in the peripheral blood plasma caused by the presence of a female. In contrast, antagonist of the beta-adrenoceptor propranolol and beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker ICI-118.551 significantly intensified the stimulating effect of the female presence on plasma testosterone level. The expression of effects of the adrenoceptor antagonists on the plasma testosterone level depended on a male genotype. At the same time, pretreatment of males with yohimbine, an antagonist of the alpha 2-adrenoceptors, or with metoprolol, a beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker, did not influence the activating effect of a female on the plasma level of testosterone. A conclusion was drawn that during sexual arousal in male mice caused by the presence of a receptive female, the stimulatory effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular complex were produced through the alpha 1-adrenoceptors, and the inhibitory effects were realized through the beta 2-adrenoceptors.",

Intraocular pressure was followed up in 59 patients with senile and 12 with complicated cataract subjected to cataract cryoextraction by the same surgeon. The pressure decreased by 5.6 +/- 1.3 mm Hg. Prolapse of the vitreous body occurred in 1 case.", 
    "76": "The effects of betaxolol on isolated rat arteries and the modes of action were investigated. Betaxolol (10(-5)-10(-3) M) relaxed the 80 mM K(+)-induced contraction of aortic strips concentration-dependently. The 50% inhibitory concentration of betaxolol in the K(+)-induced contraction was 3 times higher than that of papaverine and about 3 times lower than that of bunitrolol. The relaxations by betaxolol were also demonstrated in renal, mesenteric and femoral arteries. Betaxolol (3 x 10(-6) M-10(-4) M) produced rightward parallel shifts of the concentration-response curves for Ca2+ in the K(+)-depolarized aortic strips. On the other hand, betaxolol produced downward shifts as well as rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves for norepinephrine, 5-HT and angiotensin II. In K(+)-depolarized aortic strips, the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration measured with a fluorescent indicator, fura-2, was decreased by betaxolol (10(-4) M) almost concomitantly with the loss of tention. An elevation of external Ca2+ from 2.5 mM to 10 mM restored both the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and tention. The relaxations of arteries induced by betaxolol were not influenced by glybenclamide, methylene blue, indomethacin or removal of the endothelium. These results suggest that betaxolol possesses a direct vasodilating action, and the action may be due to the inhibition of Ca2+ influx across the cell membrane.", 
    "77": "Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of single oral doses of 200 mg of two atenolol formulations (Tenormin, atenolol (T) and Duraatenolol, atenolol (D)) were assessed in eight male healthy volunteers for 48 h (double-blind crossover design). Both formulations were bioequivalent in terms of pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, tmax, Cmax, t1/2) as detected by gas liquid chromatography. By means of a radioreceptor assay (RRA) any significant contribution of beta 2-adrenoceptors and active metabolites to effects observed in vivo was ruled out. Based on parameters derived from RRA a prediction of the time course of any beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated effect in vivo was made. During the first 12 h after intake of atenolol (T) and atenolol (D) effect kinetics simulated from RRA data corresponded very well to the inhibition of exercise-induced tachycardia observed in vivo. Thus, RRA is an in vitro method enabling assessment and prediction of relative bioequivalence of 2 atenolol formulations in vivo. Moreover, it enables establishment of a causal relationship between pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters.", 
    "78": "Effects of a beta-agonist (isoproterenol) and beta-antagonists (propranolol and pindolol) on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) and on changes in some chemical mediators were compared between HPV-responsive lobes and non-responsive lobes in which HPV was induced by aspirin DL-lysine (ASA groups). Hypoxic ventilation (4 min) was repeated in 56 of isolated, blood-perfused dog lung lobes. Each drug was administrated in a bolus dose of 0.2 mg in the intermittent period between hypoxia. In HPV-responsive lobes, the first hypoxia increased pulmonary vascular resistance by 33% or more in all groups. Both isoproterenol and pindolol inhibited the elicitation of HPV completely, but propranolol induced almost the same degree of HPV as control. In ASA groups, HPV was completely inhibited by isoproterenol, but was not influenced by propranolol. However, pindolol's inhibitory effect on HPV was less than that in HPV-responsive lobes. Isoproterenol significantly increased cyclic AMP from 17.0 to 76.7 pmol/ml in HPV-responsive lobes (n = 7). Pindolol increased prostaglandin E2 from 87.0 to 1015.4 pg/ml in HPV-responsive lobes (n = 7), and from 93.4 to 361.3 pg/ml when ASA was treated. Propranolol did not show the different results from the control group whether ASA was present or not. The different mechanisms among beta-adrenoceptor-related agents in HPV and pulmonary circulation were investigated.", 
    "79": "The objective of this study was to determine the stereochemistry of sulfoconjugation of a chiral phenolic amine drug, 4-hydroxypropranolol (HOP), by the human liver. The reaction was catalyzed by the 100,000 g cytosol as the phenolsulfotransferase (PST) enzyme source with PAP35S as the co-substrate. The enantiomers of the intact sulfate conjugate formed, (+)-HOP35S and (-)-HOP35S, were separated by HPLC and measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Complex velocity vs. substrate concentration curves were obtained with two peaks of activity, one at 3 microM (high affinity) and one at 500 microM (low affinity). The high-affinity reaction demonstrated a high degree of stereoselectivity. Whereas the affinity of the enantiomers for this reaction was identical, with a very low apparent KM value of 0.59 microM, the apparent Vmax value for (+)-HOPS formation was 4.6-fold higher than for (-)-HOPS. In sharp contrast, the low-affinity reaction, with an apparent KM of 65 microM, was not stereoselective. Inhibition of the high-affinity reaction by elevated temperature, but not by dichloronitrophenol, indicated that this activity was due to a monoamine form of PST. Inhibition of the low-affinity reaction by dichloronitrophenol, but not by elevated temperature, indicated that this activity was due to a phenol form of PST. As a comparison, experiments with the rat liver cytosol demonstrated only one activity, with apparent KM values of 50 microM for both enantiomers and opposite stereoselectivity in maximum velocity compared to humans, (+)/(-)-HOPS ratio 0.72. The results of this study demonstrate stereoselectivity in human hepatic sulfation of a chiral phenolic amine, with clear differences between PST isoenzymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "80": "The chronotropic responses to angiotensins I and II (5 micrograms in 1 mL Tyrode's solution) injected into the sinus node artery were assessed before and after the intravenous administration of captopril (2 mg/kg) and saralasin (20 micrograms/kg) in anaesthetized dogs. The effects of angiotensin II given intravenously were also observed. The animals (n = 8) were vagotomized and pretreated with propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) to prevent baroreceptor-mediated responses to increases in blood pressure. Injection of angiotensin I into the sinus node artery induced significant increases in heart rate (114 +/- 6 vs. 133 +/- 6 beats/min) and in systemic systolic (134 +/- 13 vs. 157 +/- 14 mmHg; 1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa) and diastolic (95 +/- 10 vs. 126 +/- 13 mmHg) blood pressures. Similar results were obtained when angiotensin II was injected into the sinus node artery, but intravenous injection induced changes in systolic (138 +/- 8 vs. 180 +/- 25 mmHg) and diastolic (103 +/- 8 vs. 145 +/- 20 mmHg) blood pressures only. Captopril induced a significant decrease in systolic (118 +/- 11 vs. 88 +/- 12 mmHg) and diastolic (84 +/- 9 vs. 59 +/- 9 mmHg) blood pressures without affecting the heart rate (109 +/- 6 vs. 106 +/- 6 beats/min). Saralasin produced a significant increase in systolic (109 +/- 7 vs. 126 +/- 12 mmHg) blood pressure only. Increments in heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures in response to angiotensins I and II were, respectively, abolished by captopril and saralasin. It was concluded that angiotensin II has, in vivo, a direct positive chronotropic effect that can be blocked by saralasin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "Reactive oxygen species (at least relatively high doses) cause contraction of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle. The objective of the present study was to elucidate the possible cellular mechanisms involved in reactive oxygen-mediated contraction. Isolated arterial rings from Sprague-Dawley rats were placed in tissue baths containing Earle's balanced salt solution. The maximum active force production (Po) in response to 80 mM KCl was obtained. All other responses were normalized as percentages of Po for comparative purposes. Exposure to reactive oxygen (generated from either the xanthine oxidase reaction (XO) or the glucose oxidase reaction) resulted in pulmonary arterial muscle developing mean active tension of 17.1 +/- 3.0% Po. This contraction was independent of extracellular calcium, since it was not affected by verapamil (a calcium channel blocker) or by placement of the arterial muscle in calcium-free media. Phentolamine (an alpha 1-receptor blocker) and propranolol (a beta-receptor blocker) did not diminish the response to XO. Ryanodine (a SR calcium release inhibitor), while reducing the response to norepinephrine, did not affect the response to XO. However, H-7 (an inhibitor of protein kinase C) decreased the XO-mediated contraction by 49%. These results indicate that while Ca2+ may not be involved as a second messenger, protein kinase C activity appears to play a role in the transduction pathway of reactive oxygen species mediated contraction of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle.", 
    "82": "Three patients below 21 years of age presented with typical symptoms, electrocardiographic pattern, and levels of enzymes suggestive for acute myocardial infarction. Various risk factors for coronary artery disease were present in all three patients. Coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries in all. Thus, acute myocardial infarction may be experienced even in very young patients. Clinical and angiographic findings are discussed on the basis of the existing reports in the literature.", 
    "83": "Normal subjects are able to compensate negative inotropic drug effects by adrenergic stimulation. This may limit the relevance of hemodynamic investigations with new drugs. Therefore, the haemodynamic effects of a new class 1 antiarrhythmic drug, quinacainol, were evaluated in 16 patients with normal left ventricular function 5 and 25 minutes after intravenous administration in 2 settings: 12 patients were untreated, and 4 patients were pretreated with beta-blockers and atropine to block a reflex adrenergic discharge and vagolytic reaction. Cardiac contractility decreased in all patients: in the untreated group, the heart rate increased from 74 +/- 10 beats per minute to 80 +/- 9 and Vmax decreased from 1.56 +/- 0.56 circ/sec to 1.36 +/- 0.45 at 5 minutes and 1.36 +/- 0.61 at 25 minutes; in the pretreated group, the heart rate did not change. Vmax decreased from 1.61 +/- 0.19 circ/sec to 1.33 +/- 0.08 at 5 minutes and to 1.09 +/- 0.13 at 25 minutes. Autonomic nervous system blockade unmasked a significant persistent negative inotropic effect of the drug in this series of patients with normal left ventricular function. This method may be useful for evaluating the haemodynamic effects of antiarrhythmic drugs in preliminary studies before administration to patients with impaired left ventricular function.", 
    "84": "The early treatment of acute myocardial infarction with beta-blockers represents a major advance in the management of this condition which was proved in a large serie of international studies including a total of about 30,000 patients, and in recent overviews. As a whole such treatment reduces total mortality by 13 to 14% during the first week (p less than .02) in the treated group compared with the controls. The mortality reduction appears most marked in the first two days, about 25%, after early intravenous infusion. Data on non fatal reinfarction in hospital suggest that early treatment reduces this risk by about 19% (p less than .01). Furthermore data on all patients suffering deaths, non fatal arrest and non fatal reinfarction indicate a 16% reduction in the risk of suffering one of these major events (p less than .001) and provide strong evidence of the beneficial effect of this class. Bisoprolol (Detensiel) is a high beta 1-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent without intrinsic sympathomimetric activity and local anaesthetic activity. Its pharmacokinetic profile appears extremely favourable with a plasma elimination half-life of about 10 h and a balanced clearance: bisoprolol is inactivated by liver metabolism (about 50%) and excreted unchanged in the urine (about 50%). Two pilot open studies were performed up to now with IV bisoprolol in acute myocardial infarction (MI). The first trial (n = 37) confirms the clinical and ECG safety of the administered dose regimen: repeated IV infusion of 1 mg up to a cumulative maximum dose of 5 mg and subsequent oral treatment with 10 mg once daily (o.d.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "85": "A sensitive and reproducible radioreceptor assay (RRA) is described for the determination of low picogram levels of timolol in plasma. The plasma or serum samples (1 mL) are prepared by selectively extracting timolol with lipophilic solvents or, alternatively, only plasma (serum) proteins are precipitated prior to binding assay. The recovery of timolol is at least 90% during the sample preparation. In the radioligand binding assay, timolol and the nonselective beta-antagonist [3H](-)-CGP-12177 compete for the binding sites present in the rat reticulocyte membranes. The detection limit for timolol (30 pg/mL) exceeds 50 times the sensitivity of the GC-MS techniques for timolol. The RRA results and GC results obtained from the same clinical samples correlate excellently (r = 0.99). There was no evidence for interference caused by timolol metabolites in the RRA. Timolol concentrations in plasma following its oral and even ocular administration were possible to monitor using the RRA. The method can be modified to also measure several other beta-antagonist drugs in picogram per milliliter quantities.", 
    "86": "The effect of labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on the cerebral circulation was investigated in 7 normotensive subjects. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with the intravenous 133Xe method and mean flow velocity (Vmean) in the middle cerebral artery was determined using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound. Examination was performed before and then 15, 60 and 120 min after 0.75 mg/kg i.v. labetalol. Reactivity to inhalation of 5% CO2 in air was studied before, and again 90 min after labetalol administration. Neither CBF nor Vmean changed following labetalol administration, whereas a marked increase occurred during inhalation of CO2. The median CO2 reactivity was 3.2%/mmHg (range: 1.8-4.0) for CBF and 4.4%/mmHg (1.5-5.6) for Vmean. These results indicate that labetalol, given in moderate but clinically relevant doses, does not affect the cerebral circulation in normotensive subjects. Neither does it affect CO2 reactivity. The uniform results obtained with the two methods suggest TCD as a usable alternative to conventional CBF technique in the assessment of cerebral vasoactivity of various drugs in subjects with a normal cerebral circulation.", 
    "87": "Coronary artery ring preparations from sheep were used for in vitro assessment of isometric tension after stimulation with adrenaline (NA), serotonin (5-HT) and nicotine (NC). From concentration-response curves the following observations were made on potency of agonist: 5-HT greater than NC greater than NA and efficacy: 5-HT = NC greater than NA. Removal of the intima increased sensitivity to stimulation with NA and 5-HT (lower EC50 values) and augmented the maximal response. Preincubation of the vessels with NC and propranolol (PR) resulted in a leftward shift of the concentration-response curves to NA and 5-HT. Sensitivity and maximal response to NA and 5-HT were further enhanced by endothelial removal and pretreatment with NC and PR. It can be concluded that vasoconstriction to NA and 5-HT is enhanced by nicotine (smoking) and administration of beta-blockers (propranolol), particularly in coronary arteries with endothelial damage.", 
    "88": "The authors investigated the metipranolol plasma concentration in seven patients with renal failure after a single dose of 20 mg of the preparation (2 tablets of Trimepranol) by the oral route during haemodialysis and on days without dialysis, and evaluated also the effect of dialysis on selected pharmacokinetic constants. Although there was a great individual variability of plasma concentrations of metipranolol, these concentrations were at the end of dialysis lower than during the corresponding interval between dialyses. The mean values of the area beneath the concentration curve, the velocity elimination constants, the half-life of elimination and total clearance indicate a certain dialysability of metipranolol. During the practical application of these conclusions it is, however, important to consider the effect on blood pressure and cardiac rhythm resp. by changes of volume and the composition of the extracellular fluid caused by haemodialysis.", 
    "89": "Atenolol, a selective beta-blocker, slightly potentiates the stimulated aggregation of platelets against dose-dependence. The drug potentiates similarly stimulated release of arachidonic acid, it does not influence the formation of malondialdehyde and the thromboxane B2 production in stimulated platelets. The non-selective beta-blocker propranolol inhibits in a dose-dependent way stimulated aggregation, the release of arachidonic acid, it reduces thromboxane B2 production in stimulated platelets. The authors revealed that the anti-aggregating action of beta-blockers is closely related to their ability to influence prostaglandin synthesis in stimulated platelets."
