Animals so treated demonstrate moderate to severe withdrawal signs. Accordingly, adrenal and urinary catecholamines were determined in rats undergoing withdrawal after treatment with several drugs known to modify sympathetic function. The depressant diazepam obtained withdrawal severity without altering peripheral catecholamines, propranolol reduced urinary catecholamines and transiently ameliorated withdrawal, whereas hexamethonium elevated urinary catecholamines and enhanced the severity of withdrawal. No drug treatment modified adrenal catecholamine levels. In this model the attenuation of adrenergic function has no consistent influence on the manifestation of withdrawal after ethanol.", 
    "1": "Successful empirical treatment of 17 out of 24 stallions, which had failed to ejaculate after normal penile erection, intromission and friction, by chemical blockage of beta-receptors and additional stimulation of alpha-receptors led us to investigate stallions with normal ejaculatory patterns. In an initial experiment one adult half-bred stallion was injected with 4.88 mg noradrenaline hydrochloride (treatment A), 10 mg bunitrolol (treatment B = beta-receptor blockage) and a combination of treatment A and B. Investigations of the same stallion on dated occasions without treatment served as controls. The test criteria were heart rate during copulation by telemetric measurement, volume of ejaculates and sperm concentration per ml and per ejaculate. In a second experiment, 2 stallions were treated after a modified test schedule. In addition to the criteria used in the first experiment seminal citric acid, ergothioneine, and glycerophosphocholine were measured. Administration of the beta-blocker alone or in combination with alpha-receptor stimulation resulted in (a) significant lowering of the maximal heart rate, (b) significant increase of sperm count per ejaculate and (c) significant rise of glycerophosphocholine.", 
    "2": "Cardiac accidents induced by various types of drugs are examined and risk factors are identified in this article. Digitalis preparations are responsible for the largest number of accidents, but their frequency diminishes when prescription rules are respected. Overdoses are often announced by digestive complaints, while more serious problems arise at the stage of intoxication. Theophylline is used as a bronchial muscle relaxant but also has a cardiac effect. All antiarhythmics except bretylate are negative inotropes and can aggravate cardiac insufficiency. Beta-blockers were relatively well tolerated if the contraindications are respected. The main risks are decompensation for a cardiac insufficiency and aggravation of an auriculoventricular block. The risks of antiangina preparations are mostly provoked by their vasodilation action. Neurotropic drugs usually entail minimal alterations in the electrocardiogram but a variety of serious problems may arise with massive ingestion. Cardiotoxicity is rare in anticancer drugs and has mostly been noted in anthracyclinic products. Accidents with local anesthetics are not rare despite their daily use, while general anesthetics vary in their risk levels. A variety of other medications have been found or suspected to entail risks. Myocardial infarction in young, healthy oral contraceptive (OC) users has been observed but the mechanism of action is unclear. The necessity of ruling out risk factors before prescribing combined pills has been underlined. It is difficult to compile a complete list of all drugs having cardiovascular repercussions and the action of some drugs is probably still undiscovered. In most cases the complications are dose-related and predictable. Exceptions to this rule exist, as with OCs.", 
    "3": "The contraceptive properties of two adrenergically active drugs, propranolol and reserpine, were measured in vivo and in vitro. Propranolol became effective as a spermicide for human sperm at a concentration of about 2 x 10(-3) M and for rat sperm at 2 x 10(-2) M. Reserpine was also more effective on human than rat sperm and about 20 times less effective than propranolol. Both propranolol and reserpine prevented implantation when instilled into the uteri of rats. The anti-implantation effect persisted for up to 5 days after instillation of propranolol. When freely breeding rats eventually became pregnant after daily vaginal instillation of propranolol, the number of uterine implantations decreased as the concentration of vaginally instilled propranolol increased. The implantations tended to be toward the fundal end of the uteri, away from the source of propranolol, thus indicating a topical rather than a systemic anti-implantation effect.", 
    "4": "Single oral doses of (+)-, (-)- and (+/-)-bufuralol were administered to a healthy volunteer to compare the disposition and metabolism of the individual isomers and the racemate. Plasma levels and area under plasma curve (AUC) of the active isomer, (-)-bufuralol, were higher than those of the (+)-isomer; plasma clearance was correspondingly lower. Intermediate values were found for the racemate. The elimination half-life of (-)-bufuralol was shorter than that of (+)-bufuralol, but similar to the racemate. Both isomers were cleared almost entirely by metabolism. The main metabolic pathway for (-)-bufuralol was aromatic hydroxylation, whereas the principal route for (+)-bufuralol was conjugation. Phenol metabolites in the systemic circulation were present mainly as conjugates. Both isomers also underwent aliphatic hydroxylation. This pathway was more favoured by the (+)-isomer, although plasma levels and AUC of the principal product, 2'-hydroxy-bufuralol, were almost identical for the two forms. Major differences in metabolic fate thus had relatively little effect on the disposition of pharmacologically active metabolites.", 
    "5": "The effects of diltiazem hydrochloride, a vasodilator often used to treat hypertension, and beta-blockers (pindolol and propranolol hydrochloride) on lipid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism were assessed by measuring serum levels of total cholesterol, high-density-lipoproteins (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose in patients taking these drugs for three months. No significant changes were observed in any of the values in patients taking either diltiazem hydrochloride (180 mg/day) or beta-blockers (15 mg of pindolol or 60 mg of propranolol daily). The decrease in HDL-cholesterol levels and increase in triglyceride levels reported in 1978 to be associated with use of propranolol, and with the concomitant use of hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol, was not found.", 
    "6": "The development and repairability of \"wavy ribs\" were studied in offspring from dams of rat strain SD-JCL dosed with fenoterol, a beta-adrenoceptor stimulant. The incidence of \"wavy ribs\" was high at 1000 mg/kg/d. The critical administration period for the development of \"wavy ribs\" was from day 13 through 17 of gestation. Firstly, a delay of ossification in the middle of the ribs was seen on day 17. Thereafter, the middle part of the ribs began to curve and the curves were calcified until the end of gestation. Decreases of alkaline phosphatase and total protein were observed on day 20 in blood of fetuses showing \"wavy ribs\". The \"wavy ribs\" gradually disappeared until weaning. The effect of fenoterol could be partially blocked by the action of a beta-adrenoceptor blocker.", 
    "7": "Increased peripheral vascular resistance is the cause of elevated blood pressure in most forms of systemic hypertension. Both structural changes in response to increased wall stress and functional alterations in vascular smooth muscle itself appear to contribute to the elevated resistance. As mediators of the vasoconstrictor responses, alpha-adrenoceptors apparently play an important if not predominant role in the initiation and/or maintenance of high resistance and pressure. In contrast to beta-receptor blockade alone, combined alpha-beta-receptor blockade lowers blood pressure predominantly by alpha-receptor-mediated reduction of the systemic vascular resistance, both when induced acutely and, in particular, during long-term administration. Cardiac output is maintained at pretreatment level, as is left ventricular filling pressure. Since a well-balanced blockade of both alpha- and beta-receptors counteracts the pathophysiological changes causing and/or maintaining hypertension and tends to restore cardiovascular dynamics towards normal, combined alpha-beta-receptor blockade appears at present to be one of the most logical and rational therapeutic approaches to hypertension.", 
    "8": "In early essential hypertension, an increase in cardiac output (CO) is seen in about two-thirds of the patients. In established essential hypertension, CO is usually normal or subnormal, while total peripheral resistance (TPR) is increased. Treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents accentuates these haemodynamic changes; in particular CO is further decreased. Comparison of the effects of beta-blockers with and without beta 1-selectivity and intrinsic activity reveals slight differences in the haemodynamic responses. Although none of the beta-blockers normalizes the haemodynamics, satisfactory blood-pressure reduction may be achieved at rest and during exercise with minimal side effects.", 
    "9": "Since sympathetic nervous activity is intimately involved in the regulation of hormonal and metabolic responses, it may be assumed tht antihypertensive drugs acting on adrenergic receptors will interfere with metabolic control mechanisms. We have therefore evaluated the effect of the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin on intravenous glucose tolerance and insulin response in a group of 6 healthy subjects. Ninety minutes after a single oral dose of 2 mg prazosin we observed a significant (p less than 0.05) fall in K-value (mean decrease from 1.7 to 1.0), which was accompanied by a blunting of the early insulin response. The acute effects of prazosin closely resemble those observed after 6-8 weeks of treatment with therapeutic doses of prazosin in hypertensive women. It is postulated that the effect of prazosin is mediated by an increase in circulating catecholamines acting on the pancreatic beta-cell alpha 2-adrenoceptors, which are responsible for the well-known inhibitory action of alpha-adrenergic agents upon the release of insulin.", 
    "10": "beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists influence the metabolic responses in man at rest and during exercise. Impaired working capacity and muscular fatigue have been reported in patients on beta-blockers and this could be due to an altered substrate supply to the muscles. The results from several studies show that the main effect of beta-blockade on metabolism is decreased lipolysis, with less fat available to the muscles. This results in an increased carbohydrate demand to maintain an unchanged aerobic metabolism, and liver and muscle glycogen stores are more rapidly depleted. beta-blockade also results in decreased lactate release from the muscles, probably due to a membrane effect and/or changed perfusion. It is concluded that beta-blockade a) decreases fat metabolism in the muscle, which secondarily increases the use of carbohydrates during exercise, resulting in earlier hypoglycaemia and/or depletion of muscle glycogen with reduction of the working capacity, b) impairs lactate transport from the muscle but does not cause lactate accumulation within the muscle which could be responsible for muscular fatigue.", 
    "11": "To examine physiological and pharmacological characteristics of synaptic transmission from taste cells to afferent nerve terminals in frog taste organ, changes in the glossopharyngeal nerve discharges and responses to chemical stimulation of the tongue were examined by intra-arterially perfusing the tongue with Ringer solution containing monoamines and their related substances. Noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), and adrenaline (AD) produced an increase in the spontaneous glossopharyngeal nerve discharges as well as an enhancement of taste responses to various kinds of chemical stimuli, but they did not affect tactile response. NA was the most effective of the three. Monoamine-releasing agents, tyramine and 6OHDA, enhanced spontaneous nerve discharges but depressed taste responses. Antimonoaminergic agents, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine (alpha-blockers), increased nerve discharges and depressed taste responses, but did not affect tactile response. DCI (beta-blocker), except at high concentrations, affected neither nerve discharges nor taste responses. Pre-treatment of frogs with monoamine-depleting agents, alpha-MPT and 6OHDA, depressed taste responses. Reserpine enhanced the effect of alpha-MPT. The depressed taste responses recovered after perfusion of the tongue with NA. From the results obtained, the possibility of NA being a transmitter at the afferent synapse in the frog taste organ was discussed.", 
    "12": "The ocular penetration of two beta-adrenergic blockers, befunolol and timolol, was studied using albino and pigmented rabbits. A 1% ophthalmic solution of 14C-befunolol hydrochloride or 14C-timolol maleate was instilled in one eye of nonsedated rabbits, and the concentrations of radioactive material in the ocular tissues were determined at various intervals. In the albino rabbit, the time courses of the concentration changes in the cornea and aqueous humor could be analyzed on the basis of a compartment theory, and the following coefficients were calculated using a computer; i.e., permeability of the corneal epithelium (kep), the distribution volume in the anterior chamber (Va), the cornea-aqueous transfer coefficient in reference to the corneal volume (kc.ca), the aqueous-cornea transfer coefficient in reference to Va (ka.ac), the loss rate from the anterior chamber (ko) and the steady state distribution ratio between the aqueous and cornea (rac). The following values were obtained for befunolol: kep--2.6 x 10(-3) cm hr-1, kc.ca--0.51 hr-1, ka.ac--0.18 hr-1, ko--2.7 hr-1, Va--250 microliters and rac--0.9. Those of timolol were as follows: kep--2.3 x 10(-3) cm hr-1, kc . ca--0.82 hr-1 and ko--2.5 hr-1. The estimates for Va and rac could not be calculated from the data obtained in the timolol experiment. Assuming that Va and rac for befunolol were also applicable for timolol, ka.ac for timolol was calculated to be 0.25 to 0.29 hr-1. The beta-adrenergic blockers tested here penetrated the cornea rather easily and they were lost from the anterior chamber mainly by diffusion, probably into the blood circulation through the anterior uvea. The data obtained in the pigmented rabbit indicated that these beta-adrenergic blockers are bound to the melanin-containing ocular tissues and are released from there very slowly. It is suggested that in heavily pigmented subjects, beta-adrenergic blockers might be less effective after short-term use and, furthermore, intraocular binding may occur after long-term use.", 
    "13": "In 10 patients with ventricular preexcitation (Kent bundle), in whom atrial fibrillation (A.F.) was present, the effect of some common antiarrhythmic drugs on the conduction through the anomalous pathway, and on the ventricular rate was estimated. Procainamide caused transient complete block in the accessory pathway (disappearance of the aberrant QRS) and marked reduction of the average ventricular rate in all instances. Lidocaine caused incomplete block in the accessory pathway (reduction of the number of the aberrant QRS) and significant reduction of the average ventricular rate in all tested subjects. Amiodarone slowed the ventricular rate (increase of the average and minimum R-R intervals between wide QRS complexes) in two patients, but it did not block the anomalous pathway (all QRS complexes remained aberrant); whereas in 1 patient the ventricular rate became faster and regular and the patient had syncope, while the QRS remained always aberrant. This response was probably due to the change of A.F. into atrial flutter with atrio-ventricular conduction through the anomalous pathway only. Digitalis increased the average ventricular rate and shortened the minimum R-R interval between aberrant QRS complexes 3 out of 3 times. On the basis of our experience and of the data in the literature, we conclude that, in the management of A.F. in patients with W.P.W. syndrome:--the most effective drugs are those of the 1st group of Singh and Hauswirth classification (especially Procainamide and Ajmaline);--Lidocaine is less effective, but not ineffective and its utilization may be recommended whenever the previous drugs may be hazardous;--Amiodarone, although capable of modifying the electrophysiologic properties both of the anomalous pathway and of the A-V node, seems to be less reliable;--the drugs which influence only the A-V node (Verapamil, beta-Blockers, etc.) are quite ineffective;--finally, the Digitalis is not suitable because this drug increases the ventricular rate by decreasing the effective refractory period (ERP) of the anomalous pathway.", 
    "14": "The antihypertensive effect of a new vasodilator with betablocking properties (SK & F 92657) was investigated in 10 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a mean treatment period of 26,5 weeks (6,5-49 weeks) blood pressure was significantly reduced, from 168 +/- 22/106 +/- 6 mmHg to 144 +/- 19/94 +/- 12 mmHg (p less than 0.05 and 0.025). The mean dose was 410 mg (100-700 mg). Heart rate decreased slightly from 77 +/- 12 to 70 +/- 8 beats/min. Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone showed only minor changes. Nausea, heavy dreams, facial and hand flushing and mild depression were reported as side effects. In most patients the symptoms disappeared without reduction in the dose. In one patient anaemia developed after 7 weeks and treatment with prizidilol was stopped. A slight but statistically significant decrease in haemoglobin concentration of 1.1 +/- 0.6 g/dl was observed in 5 of the 10 patients (p less than 0.02). Thus, a mean dose of prizidilol of 410 +/- 242 mg/day had a mean blood pressure lowering effect of 24/12 mmHg. In 7 of the 10 patients (70%) diastolic blood pressure could be reduced to 95 mmHg or less. However, the observed haematological side-effects should be carefully monitored in further studies and may limit the clinical use of prizidilol.", 
    "15": "The interaction between several adrenergic agonists (epinephrine, norepinephrine and isoproterenol) and relatively specific beta 1- and beta 2-antagonists has been examined on fluid permeability of the isolated rabbit ciliary epithelium. A specific beta 1-antagonist (metoprolol) had little effect on the permeability increase induced by the agonists, whereas butoxamine (a specific beta 2-antagonist) caused an inhibition of the normal agonist-induced permeability increase. The data suggest that these three adrenergic agonists primarily affect the beta 2-receptor in the ciliary epithelium in order to induce their effects on fluid permeability.", 
    "16": "The effects of acute, rapid distention of the urinary bladder on the arterial pressure, blood flow and peripheral resistances were studied on dogs and an attempt was made to elucidate the mechanisms of cardiovascular responses observed. In 15 dogs with intact nervous system the arterial blood pressure and blood flow of the femoral, brachial and renal arteries were recorded and the vascular resistances were calculated during an increase of the intra-bladder pressure. Acute distention of the bladder, in the dog, increases arterial blood pressure by 10,25%, the vascular resistance of the femoral and renal vascular bed increases while that of the brachial artery is slightly reduced.", 
    "17": "Repeated doses of a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, befunolol, were administered orally to adult male volunteers for a cross-over comparison with propranolol. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity of befunolol was greater than that of propranolol when assessed by the percentage reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia. The elimination half-life of drug was significantly prolonged on repeated administration of propranolol, but not of befunolol. The percentage reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia was highly correlated with the log plasma level of each drug. Both drugs produced a significant reduction in pre-exercise systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and significant attenuation of exercise-induced rise in systolic blood pressure.", 
    "18": "1. Adrenaline and noradrenaline, but not isoprenaline or phenylephrine, showed a negative chronotropic effect on the isolated perch heart. 2. This adrenergic effect was blocked by an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, but not by a beta-blocker, propranolol, suggesting the role of alpha receptors in this action. 3. When a ligature between the atrium and the ventricle was used, adrenaline inhibited the beating of the atrium but not of the ventricle. This suggests that the negative chronotropic effect occurred in the whole heart through an atrial pacemaker (sinus node). 4. The sensitivity of the heart to the adrenergic effect was temperature-dependent and greater at low test temperature. At 15 degrees C pD2 for noradrenaline was 6.45 +/- 0.20 and for adrenaline 6.33 +/- 0.20. At 24 degrees C the values were 5.44 +/- 0.12 and 5.67 +/- 0.15, respectively.", 
    "19": "In the present study we investigated the effect of three manoeuvres known to be associated with enhanced sympathetic activity on plasma levels of active and inactive renin. To this end, active and trypsin-activatable renin were measured in blood drawn from 12 untreated essential hypertensive patients before, during and after any of the following tests: isometric exercise (handgrip), noise stimulation and 45 degrees head-up tilt. These studies were repeated after the patients had been treated with either atenolol (n = 6) or SL 77499 (n = 6), an alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocking agent for 10 days. The results indicate that active and inactive renin often change in an unpredictable way in response to sympathetic stimulation. There are, as yet, no conclusive explanations which describe the behaviour of both forms of renin during these manoeuvres.", 
    "20": "Adrenaline causes aggregation of human blood platelets through stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors resembling the alpha 2-type. Alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents inhibit specifically the adrenaline-induced platelet reactions. The adrenaline-induced aggregation of human blood platelets was inhibited specifically by adrenergic neuron blocking agents such as guanoxan, guanclofine and guanethidine. Guanoxan (I50 = 0.6 mu mol/l) was about three orders of magnitude more effective than guanethidine, guanclofine occupied a median position. The compounds tested inhibited the ADP- and collagen-induced aggregation at relatively high concentrations. This is probably due to non-specific membrane effects. The known alpha-adrenolytic effect of guanoxan is believed to be mediated mainly by alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "21": "We examined 10 patients with an exercise-induced asthma. Physical exercise was carried out under placebo, 40 mg propranolol, 5 mg pindolol and 50 mg metoprolol, respectively, before and after alpha blockade. After exercise, we noted a distinct increase of airway resistance in all cases, the increase of which, however, was lower after a preceding alpha blockade. Under propranolol, the increase of the airway resistance and of norepinephrine, as compared with pindolol, metoprolol, and placebo, was most intensive.", 
    "22": "1. At the embryonic stages the adenylate cyclase of chick skeletal muscle possesses high catalytic activity, which is about 10 times higher than its mature level. 2. The reactivity of adenylate cyclase system to catecholamines appears in embryogenesis by the end of the second week, whereas the dose dependence only appears in the third week. 3. The stimulatory effect of catecholamines on adenylate cyclase in chick skeletal muscle is mediated through the beta-adrenoreceptor. 4. The suggestion is made that the limiting factor in the development of adrenoreactivity of membrane adenylate cyclase system is the number of receptors.", 
    "23": "1. The digger wasp, Philanthus triangulum, which preys on honeybees, produces a paralysing venom possessing a wide variety of activities. 2. In insects, the venom has a central as well as a peripheral effect; the latter effect consists of a presynaptic as well as a postsynaptic block of the skeletal neuromuscular transmission. 3. The presynaptic block is probably caused by an inhibition of the re-uptake of the transmitter. The postsynaptic effect probably consists of a block of open ion channels. 4. The venom contains at least four active toxins called alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-philanthotoxin (PTX). alpha-PTX blocks transmission in the cockroach CNS. The other three toxins block neuromuscular transmission. delta-PTX being the most active toxin in blocking glutamate evoked postsynaptic depolarizations. 5. In the junctional, as well as in the extrajunctional, muscle fibre membrane delta-PTX blocks ion channels in a use-dependent manner. Once the channel has been blocked, unblocking seems to be channels in a use-dependent manner. Once the channel has been blocked, unblocking seems to be semi-irreversible when agonist activation is low (spontaneous release of transmitter and/or leak of glutamate from the pipette). 6. The time constant of blocking is roughly estimated to be in the order of 10 msec, that of unblocking seems to be several hundreds of msec.", 
    "24": "1. Both shivering and nonshivering thermogenesis are ways of increasing oxygen consumption in the rat. The participation of nonshivering thermogenesis after cold acclimation is well established, but there is little evidence of the relative importance of each kind of thermogenesis in acclimated and nonacclimated rats. 2. Oxygen consumption and rectal temperature were measured in warm and cold-acclimated rats exposed both to cold (10 degrees C) and warm (30 degree C) environments. 3. Shivering was blocked by mephenesin (10 mg/100 g body wt) and nonshivering thermogenesis was blocked by propranolol (0.5 mg/100 g body wt). 4. Control animals were injected with saline (0.5 ml/100 g body wt). 5. The results showed that shivering is not effective in maintaining a constant rectal temperature and that nonshivering thermogenesis does not contribute to the increase in oxygen consumption of warm-acclimated rats exposed to cold.", 
    "25": "In order to investigate the effects of beta-blockade on haemodynamic response to stress, 2 groups of volunteers received either propranolol or mepindolol sulphate under basal conditions and under the stress of mental arithmetic. In control conditions, increases occurred in heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in response to calculation stress. Stress-induced increases in HR and CO were significantly reduced by propranolol. Systolic blood pressure during calculation stress under propranolol was slightly less than in control conditions. However, diastolic blood pressure under stress was higher with propranolol than in the control study. Mepindolol sulphate also reduced HR and CO under calculation stress but it produced no significant change in diastolic pressure. A significant increase in plasma adrenaline occurred under stress. The level was not altered by propranolol but was reduced to less than 50% of the untreated stress value by mepindolol. Since beta-blocking agents suppress an increase in heart rate in stressful situations but either fail to prevent or even potentiate increased diastolic pressure, their use in patients without hypertension should be reserved for those showing pathological stress reactions. They do not appear to be indicated for the management of stressful situations in general.", 
    "26": "This presentation briefly describes the sympathetic and parasympathetic control of the heart, particularly in relation to coronary vascular effects. Autonomic disturbances following myocardial infarction and their significance are discussed. The influence of the autonomic system in chronic coronary heart disease is considered, particularly in relation to the beneficial effects which may be obtained by the combined use of beta-blocking drugs and cardiac pacing. Nine anginal patients with spontaneous or drug-induced bradycardia received temporary pacing and 27 others had pacemakers implanted. Pain was well controlled in the former group. Long term pacing produced worth-while benefit in 67% of the patients followed for periods up to 6 months, the figure falling to 50% among those followed for 24 months. Eight of the 27 relapsed. Thus, correction of bradycardia by pacing often produced a beneficial long term effect. A second group of 14 patients with ventricular arrhythmias was treated with beta-blocking agents combined with pacing. So far, 10 of these 14 have had their arrhythmias controlled either by the initial or by a modified drug regime. The results indicate that among patients with chronic coronary artery disease, beta-blockade to minimize cardiac sympathetic activity, coupled with pacing to prevent loss of chronotrophic control, often represents an effective combination for the management of refractory angina or arrhythmias.", 
    "27": "In previous pharmacokinetic studies in healthy subjects the time course of plasma concentration of prenalterol was described by a short distribution phase (alpha-phase) with a mean half-life of about 8 minutes and an elimination phase (beta-phase) with an average half- life of about two hours [1, 2]. The aim of this joint study was to check the pharmacokinetic data obtained after intravenous single dose administration with the computer program TOPFIT [3] using different compartment models and to test the predictive power of the chosen kinetic model for plasma concentration data after repetitive intravenous prenalterol dosing.", 
    "28": "1. Prenalterol is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration with peak concentrations reached after 30 minutes. 2. Prenalterol is rapidly distributed to extravascular tissues after intravenous administration. 3. The extent of bioavailability after administration of prenalterol as a solution is about 25% of an intravenous dose. After administration of 20 mg prenalterol in a controlled release preparation the bioavailability is increased to about 45%. 4. The half-life of the elimination phase is close to 2 hours. 5. 60% of an intravenous dose and 15% of an oral dose is eliminated unchanged by renal excretion. The rest is mainly excreted as the sulphate ester of prenalterol.", 
    "29": "Experiments were performed on 5 resting conscious dogs supplied with an electromagnetic flow probe on the ascending aorta and a chronic aortic catheter for pressure recording. The animals were used repeatedly in four different types of experiment involving i.v. administration of 1. saline (controls), 2. prenalterol 45 nmol/kg (approximately 10 micrograms/kg) followed by an additional dose of 135 nmol/kg 20 min later, 3. ouabain 50 nmol/kg (approximately 30 micrograms/kg) and 4. a combination of protocols 2. and 3. Ouabain and the low dose of prenalterol exerted clear-cut positive inotropic effects as reflected in increased stroke volume and max dF/dt without significant changes in heart rate or arterial pressure. The PQ interval increased with ouabain but decreased with prenalterol. The higher dose of prenalterol caused a further rise in max dF/dt, a further shortening of the PQ time, increased heart rate and reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Higher doses of ouabain could not be given due to side-effects (vomiting). The combined treatment with ouabain and prenalterol showed their inotropic responses to be additive. Arrhythmias did not occur in any of the animals at the applied dose levels of the drugs. The experiments show that prenalterol through its beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulating action exerts a positive inotropic effect which surpasses that of emetic doses of ouabain. The inotropic response at moderate doses occurs without a change in heart rate. This fact and the apparent lack of influence of prenalterol on vascular alpha- and beta 2-adrenoceptors make the substance potentially useful clinically as an inotropic agent in cardiac failure, particularly in view of its relatively long duration of action.", 
    "30": "Prenalterol administration (150 micrograms/kg i.v.) exerted beneficial effects on resting and/or exercise cardiac performance in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy (n = 12) and 1 patient with hypertensive heart disease (= group I, n = 13), while the haemodynamic response in patients with severe coronary heart disease (n=3) or cor pulmonale (n = 1) was non-uniform. At rest mean right and left ventricular filling pressures decreased by 26 and 19% (p less than 0.02 and p less than 0.02), respectively, while stroke volume increased by 8% (p less than 0.05), cardiac index by 25% (p less than 0.01) and heart rate by 15% (p less than 0.005) 5 min after prenalterol administration in group I. During exercise there was no further increase in heart rate, while filling pressures decreased and cardiac index increased significantly compared to control exercise. This typical inotropic response to prenalterol was observed in fully digitalised patients. Maximal effects occurred about 15 min after i.v. administration.", 
    "31": "The effect of three doses of prenalterol, 12.5, 25 and 50 micrograms, on cardiac index (CI), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), heart rate (HR), and stroke volume index (SVI) was investigated in 18 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Twelve patients received only prenalterol, while 6 patients received prenalterol 1 hour after an oral dose of hydralazine and isosorbid dinitrate. In 7 out of 12 patients a dose-dependent increase in HR was observed. The response of HR was inversely correlated to resting catecholamine levels; patients with high resting catecholamines--these are patients with severe CHF--did not show any increase in HR. CI increased in 8 out of 12 patients (average 1 . 1/min m) and SVI in 5 out of 12 patients. This inconsistent response was not dependent on left ventricular ejection fraction or plasma catecholamines at rest. Pretreatment with vasodilators did not improve the haemodynamic response to prenalterol. Four out of 17 patients demonstrated an increase in severity of arrhythmias suggestive of arrhythmogenic properties of prenalterol.", 
    "32": "To assess the immediate haemodynamic and myocardial metabolic effects of the beta 1-agonist prenalterol, we studied by cardiac catheterisation the response to 50 and 100 micrograms/kg given intravenously in 16 patients with congestive heart failure secondary to coronary artery disease or non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. At peak effect, cardiac index increased from 2.6 +/- 0.5 to 3.2 +/- 0.8 1/min/m2 (mean +/- SD) p less than 0.001); peak rate of left ventricular pressure development rose from 963 +/- 242 to 1355 +/- 411 mm Hg per second (p less than 0.001); left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell from 27 +/- 6 to 13 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); coronary sinus blood flow increased from 120 +/- 39 to 147 +/- 55 ml/min (p less than 0.01); myocardial oxygen consumption was augmented from 12.9 +/- 3.9 to 15.7 +/- 5.8 ml/min (p less than 0.001); and heart rate increased slightly (76 +/- 12 to 86 +/- 14 beats per minute, p less than 0.05). No significant changes occurred in left ventricular systolic pressure, stroke volume index, myocardial lactate extraction rate, myocardial arteriovenous oxygen difference and no patient developed angina, ECG-changes or ventricular arrhythmias. Infusion of prenalterol effectively improved the haemodynamic function and cardiac metabolism in congestive cardiomyopathy.", 
    "33": "The hemodynamic effects of prenalterol, a parenteral cardioselective beta 1-receptor agonist, were evaluated by cardiac catheterization in patients with refractory severe congestive heart failure (CHF). Prenalterol (PN) (4 mg i.v.) did not alter (p greater than 0.05) heart rate (HR), mean blood pressure (MBP) or left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP). Concomitantly PN markedly augmented cardiac index (CI) from 1.9 to 2.6 l/min/m2 (p less than 0.01) and substantially elevated stroke index (SI) from 24 to 30 ml/beta/m2 (p less than 0.001). In addition PN raised stroke work index (SWI) from 21 to 26 g . m/m2 (p less than 0.005) and decreased total systemic vascular resistance (TSVR) from 1702 to 1260 dyn . s. cm-5 (p less than 0.001). An important finding was that the heart rate x systolic blood pressure product was unchanged (p greater than 0.05) and precipitation of cardiac dysrhythmias or myocardial ischemia were not observed. Further PN 1 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg i.v. was sequentially injected and peak hemodynamic effects were determined 10 min after drug administration. PN 1 mg raised CI from 2.1 to 2.5 1/min/m2 (p less than 0.01), elevated SI from 24 to 29 ml/beat/m2 (p less than 0.01), and augmented SWI from 21 to 25 g . m/m2 (p less than 0.01), however, TSVR declined from 1702 to 1392 dyn . s. cm-5. Subsequent incremental PN doses of 4 and 8 mg did not provide (p greater than 0.05) additional enhancement of cardiac function. Thus, prenalterol produced markedly beneficial enhancement of cardiocirculatory function without untoward effects and may be useful in the management of patients with severe congestive heart failure. Moreover, dose-response analysis indicates these salutary improvements can be maximally produced by the small dose of 1 mg obviating the need for larger doses.", 
    "34": "Experimental pharmacology indicates that prenalterol is a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor activator. In 5 normal individuals, 15 minutes after the drug (infused at a dose of 15 micrograms/kg over 5 min) the following circulatory changes were seen: a) increase of cardiac index (+31%), heart rate, stroke index, systolic aortic pressure, left and right ventricular mean rate of ejection and mean rate of the pressure rise in either ventricle during the pre-ejection phase; b) reduction of systemic vascular resistance (-18%), appearance, built-up and disappearance times in the left ventricular dye dilution curves. Pulmonary systolic, diastolic and wedge pressures and vascular resistance did not vary consistently. The circulatory effects persisted almost unchanged 30 minutes after the infusion. In a group of 5 patients with heart failure due to primary congestive cardiomyopathy, refractory to conventional therapy, the haemodynamic response to prenalterol (infused at a dose of 30 micrograms/kg over 5 min) was qualitatively similar to that of normal subjects in 3 cases. In 2 other patients cardiac performance deteriorated. The reasons for this paradoxical effect were not identified. These preliminary results suggest that prenalterol is a potent selective inotropic agent in man, that may assist in the therapeutic management of refractory heart failure due to congestive cardiomyopathy. However, careful haemodynamic monitoring is advisable for its use in this dysfunction until broader clinical experience can be accumulated.", 
    "35": "The acute haemodynamic effects of prenalterol 75-225 micrograms/kg i.v. were studied at rest and during exercise in the supine position in 12 patients with chronic congestive heart failure secondary to myocardial infarction (6 pts), chronic valvular disease with valvular replacement (4 pts), ischaemic cardiomyopathy (1 pt) and post myocarditis (1 pt). In 5 of the 6 AMI patients the effect of prenalterol on myocardial oxygen consumption at rest was measured. Pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressure decreased significantly from 17 to 10 mm Hg at rest and from 31 to 21 mm Hg during exercise. Resting heart rate increased from 78 to 90 at rest but was unchanged during exercise. MVO2 in the 5 patients was unchanged or lower in 4 patients and increased in one in whom angina developed after prenalterol. In general, dyspnoea and angina during exercise were less pronounced after prenalterol. The calculated triple product was lower after prenalterol, especially during exercise, indicating lower myocardial oxygen consumption and probably less myocardial ischaemia.", 
    "36": "A single-blind study of prenalterol 20-200 mg daily in a slow-release tablet preparation and a placebo was performed in 15 patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure (NYHA II-IV) to evaluate the haemodynamic and clinical effects of oral prenalterol. Non-invasive parameters in the measurement of cardiac output, stroke volume, pre-ejection period index (PEPI), PEP/LVET ratio, ejection fraction and mean Vcf were significantly improved, indicating beneficial effects of prenalterol on cardiac contractility. Systolic blood pressure, heart rate and rate-pressure product were slightly increased at rest but were considerably lower during exercise. Arrhythmogenecity was not seen in the patients studied. Subjective improvement was noted in the majority of patients as evidenced by a decreased frequency of dyspnoea, fatigue and angina. Unwanted effects, such as palpitations and transmitted arm pulsations, were transient and disappeared with dose adjustment, while the inotropic effect of the medication was maintained. The clinical response appeared to be sustained for up to 2 weeks of treatment, indicating non-development of tachyphylaxis.", 
    "37": "The cases presented in this paper suggest that prenalterol is useful in the treatment of myocardial depression due to beta-blockade. According to its pharmacological properties, prenalterol might even be the drug of choice in these situations. It is wellknown that massive beta-blocker overdosage may be difficult to manage and as the therapeutic guidelines in these cases have not yet been definitely stated, it is obvious that prenalterol in this context will be of utmost importance. What remains to be solved is the dosage level. So far, experience has shown that high doses, widely exceeding the recommended initial dose of 50-100 micrograms/kg, are necessary to restore normal circulation in massive beta-blocker overdosage.", 
    "38": "Prenalterol, a new cardioselective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, was compared with the beta-stimulator dobutamine by computer-assisted echocardiography. Prenalterol decreased preload, increased heart rate and induced an increase in contractility for a longer time in comparison with dobutamine. The small influence on blood pressure and afterload indicates selective beta 1-receptor-effect by a result of slight changes in the peripheral vascular resistance.", 
    "39": "In 12 patients with severe congestive heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease (n = 6) and due to congestive cardiomyopathy (n = 6) the haemodynamic effects of a new beta 1-agonist, prenalterol, were studied. Left ventricular (LV) function was studied before and 20 min after infusion of 12 mg prenalterol. Heart rate was kept constant by atrial pacing at a rate of 100 min-1 unless intrinsic heart rate exceeded it. As a sign of positive inotropic support, prenalterol enhanced peak rate of LV pressure development (dP/dt) from 1160 +/- 100 mm Hg/s to 1590 +/- 190 mm Hg/s (p less than 0.005). In the mean LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume determined by cineventriculography and two-dimensional echocardiography decreased. LV stroke work index measured with both methods increased with 4 ml/m and 5 ml/m, respectively (p less than 0.02). LV ejection fraction was improved by 6% and 8% (p less than 0.005). Increase of peak fall of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) (1050 +/- 60 mm Hg/s to 1270 +/- 100 mm Hg/s, p less than 0.005) and shortening of time constant (T) of pressure fall from 64.5 +/- 5.0 ms to 44.5 +/- 6.0 ms (p less than 0.005) demonstrated the improved LV relaxation. Analysis of LV volume and myocardial compliance revealed decrease of left ventricular stiffness. Thus, LV filling pressure was reduced from 22.1 +/- 4 mm Hg to 14 +/- 3.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Pressure volume analysis showed a significant increase of LV power and work, as well as a slight decrease of wall stress. Our study could demonstrate, even in patients with severe heart failure, a sustained positive inotropic effect of prenalterol leading to an improved left ventricular contractility, relaxation and compliance. LV power and work was enhanced. The increase of oxygen demand seemed to be counterbalanced by an improved perfusion of particularly subendocardial layers indicated by an increased transmyocardial pressure gradient.", 
    "40": "Haemodialysis hypotension occurs with particular frequency in bilateral nephrectomised patients. This reflects the importance of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system for maintaining normal blood pressure. Failure of vascular access (due to clotting and thrombosis of shunts) and ischaemic necrosis of transplanted kidneys in hypotensive patients prompted us to treat them orally with a new beta 1-adrenergic agent (prenalterol). Blood pressure was normalised in 4 out of 5 patients. Because of delayed renal elimination of the drug, daily dosage must be reduced to prevent symptoms of adrenergic stimulation. A study of the pharmacokinetics of prenalterol in uraemia is in preparation.", 
    "41": "In 16 non-diabetic and 16 diabetic patients prenalterol, dobutamine and dopamine infusions (5 micrograms/kg/min for 30 min) were given. The haemodynamic and metabolic changes were similar in diabetics and non-diabetics. Prenalterol has the most pronounced haemodynamic effect on heart rate (increase 25-47%) and the heart rate-blood pressure-product (increase 54-81%). The metabolic effects were moderate. The slight lipolytic effect of prenalterol documented its functional selectivity for beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "42": "The effect of the beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist prenalterol on the metabolic parameters glucose, lactate, free fatty acids and serum-insulin were studied in 8 healthy volunteers. Prenalterol was administered intravenously in geometrically increasing doses from 5 to 80 micrograms/kg. The only metabolic effect of prenalterol that could be proved was a significant dose-dependent rise in FFA-concentration. The stimulating effect of prenalterol on lipolysis was significant not only at the time points of maximal effect following each injection, but also 30 min later. Serum-insulin-concentration and glucose- and lactate-concentration failed, however, to show a significant rise after prenalterol administration. This behaviour is a strong indication of a beta 1-selectivity of prenalterol over the whole dose range given.", 
    "43": "Electrophysiological studies with prenalterol in 19 patients (6 women, 13 men, 5 with sinus node disease, 4 with AV node disease, 7 with double node disease, 2 with conduction disturbance below His bundle, 1 normal) showed that sinus node function (heart rate, sinus node recovery time) is uniformly improved by this beta-stimulator. Also AV conduction is significantly and uniformly improved (shortening of AH interval and of the functional refractory period of AV conduction). There is no or little influence on intra-atrial conduction and on conduction below the His bundle. However, spontaneous depolarisation in His-Purkinje fibers--as tested in patients with complete AV block and ventricular demand pacemaker--is increased through beta-stimulation with prenalterol as reflected by shorter escape intervals and higher frequency escape rhythm. Prenalterol may be of clinical use in patients with cardiomyopathies who developed bradycardia under digitalisation or patients with severe bradyarrhythmia either with or without digitalis. It might also be useful in rare emergency situations, when complete pacemaker failure develops.", 
    "44": "1. Prenalterol induces a dose-dependent effect on different variables reflecting myocardial contractility and heart rate. A clearcut effect can be demonstrated after an oral dose of 2.5 mg. The duration of the effect increases considerably when prenalterol is administered as a controlled release preparation partly due to an increased bioavailability. 2. Prenalterol induces a lipolytic effect manifested as a rise in free fatty acids and glycerol. Also a slight increase of plasma insulin is recorded while plasma potassium decreases somewhat. 3. When prenalterol is administered together with therapeutic doses of a selective or non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker it induces the same haemodynamic effects as before the beta-blocker but the dose has to be increased ten-fold. These results suggest that prenalterol might be a useful drug to counteract unwanted haemodynamic effects of a beta-blocker. 4. In animal studies it has been shown that prenalterol has affinity for both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. However, it has a stimulating effect mainly on beta 1-adrenoceptors. Therefore, theoretically it might act as a beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist. Preliminary results from studies in patients with chronic asthma indicate that prenalterol only has an insignificant beta 2-blocking effect when the drug is administered in doses which induce a significant beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulating effect.", 
    "45": "Hypophosphataemia in association with surgical trauma is usually attributed to hyperalimentation with glucose solution, or of phosphaturia due to haemodilution. We have shown that it can be induced by trauma, and probably forms part of the humoral response of trauma. In experimental studies on pigs we found that the post-traumatic fall in serum phosphate is bi-phasic, and that the first phase can be prevented by beta-blocking agents. In the present study we compared the peroperative phosphate variations in 7 thyrotoxic patients undergoing elective thyroid surgery while under treatment with beta-blocking agents with those 10 patients submitted to elective surgery (5 thyroid and 5 knee operations) but not receiving beta-blocking agents. We found that the peroperative fall in serum phosphate was prevented in patients receiving beta-blocking agents. This supports the hypothesis that the rapid fall in serum phosphate in immediate association with operative trauma is mediated through the release of catecholamines.", 
    "46": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effect of intravenously administered dopamine on dopamine receptors and adrenergic receptors in terms of its effect on gastric acid secretion, the kinetic mechanism, blood flow, and antral motility. Dopamine was used alone and in conjunction with selective blockade of alpha-, beta-, and dopaminergic receptors. A significant inhibition of gastric acid secretion was found with the highest dose of dopamine used (40 micrograms/kg/min). The kinetic study showed characteristics of a non-competitive type. The anti-secretory effect dopamine was significantly blocked by non-selective beta-blockade or by selective beta-blockade but not by alpha- or dopaminergic receptor blockade. This suggests that the inhibitory effect of dopamine on gastric secretion is mediated by beta-receptors. There was no significant effect on gastric mucosal blood flow, but the ratio between blood flow and acid secretion was significantly elevated during dopamine infusion, indicating that the acid inhibition was not secondary to changes in blood flow. It is concluded that the dopamine inhibition of acid secretion is mediated by beta 1-receptors, unlike the effect on antral gastric motility, which is mediated by dopamine receptors.", 
    "47": "The effects of receptor blockers on the cholinergic, adrenergic, and dopaminergic nervous system have been tested on basal and meal-stimulated gastrin secretion in six normal subjects. Basal gastrin secretion was unaffected by all agents, as was gastrin secretion after food when alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers were applied. Both atropine and haloperidol significantly enhanced the meal-induced secretion of gastrin. Dopamine had no effect on gastrin secretion. It is suggested that this effect of haloperidol is mediated by blockade of dopaminergic receptors, supporting the idea that the dopaminergic nervous system may influence gastrin secretion. It is concluded that the adrenergic nervous system does not influence gastrin secretion under physiological conditions, whereas both cholinergic and dopaminergic receptors may play an inhibitory role.", 
    "48": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of dopamine on gastric antral motility in conscious dogs with gastric fistula by using miniature strain-gauge transducers. Infusion of pentagastrin changed the contractile activity to a digestive state. Dopamine, an endogenous catecholamine, was used alone and in conjunction with selective blockade or adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. The stimulated antral motility was inhibited by dopamine. The effect was significantly blocked by the peripherally acting dopaminergic blocker domperidone and by cis-flupenthixol, which blocks both peripheral and central dopaminergic receptors. The effect of dopamine was not significantly altered by the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker practolol, the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine, or the alpha + beta-adrenoceptor blocker labetalol. Consequently, this study indicates that dopamine acts on gastric antral motility through dopaminergic receptors. beta-Adrenergic receptors, which are active in the impairment of gastric acid secretion, seem not to be involved in the motility response.", 
    "49": "During the first 48 h of HgCl2-induced acute renal failure (ARF), a single intraperitoneal injection of 100-100 micrograms/kg of the beta-adrenergic blockers pindolol, propranolol and practolol caused a significant rise in urinary sodium excretion and a decrease in plasma renin activity (PRA), renal cortical renin activity (RRA) and urinary catecholamine excretion. A single intraperitoneal injection of 3 mg/kg HgCl2 resulted in ARF characterized by progressive azotemia, a transient increase in PRA, a progressive rise in RRA and urinary catecholamine excretion. After pretreatment with these beta blockers, PRA, RRA and urinary catecholamine excretion remained unchanged and azotemia was markedly reduced; urine flow rates did not fall, and were significantly higher than control flows till after 48 h. These results indicate that pretreatment with beta blockers decreases the severity of ARF, though they cannot prevent is; that increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system is involved in ARF and that increase in RRA may be an aggravating factor in the pathomechanism of the nephrotoxic model in ARF.", 
    "50": "The effect of the interaction between Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 (PLG) and catecholamines on the release of MSH by rat pituitaries glands was studied in vitro. The catecholamines dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) inhibited the release of alpha-MSH from pituitary glands incubated in vitro. The DA effect appeared at low concentrations while NE was effective in concentrations 20 times greater than DA. These effects were blocked by an alpha-adrenergic blocker agent. On the other hand, epinephrine (E) at the concentrations tested did not modify MSH release. When 50 or 500 ng/ml of DA is added to the medium containing PLG concentrations it strengthened the inhibitory effect of PLG release, whereas the action of NE and PLG was additive; at the highest tested concentration E (5,000 ng/ml) blocked the inhibition of MSH induced by PLG. It is concluded that, whereas the inhibitory release of MSH by catecholamines is mediated by an alpha-adrenergic receptor, the inhibitory effect of PLG is not exerted through a catecholaminergic receptor since its action is not prevented by any of the catecholamine receptor blockers studied. Thus, it seems that specific PLG receptors are present at the pituitary level.", 
    "51": "With the view of studying the role of autonomic nervous system in chemical carcinogenesis mechanism in outbred white male rats, chronically treated with NDEA, there has been investigated the modifying effect of some neurotropic pharmacological drugs which cause either stimulation or inhibition of: 1. adrenergic processes (noradrenalin, isoproterenol, clonidine, pyrroxane and propranolol); 2. cholinergic processes (proserine and atropine); 3. the function of the central nervous system (CNS)--caffeine and ethanol. Pharmacological activation of alpha-adrenoreceptors or blocking of both beta-adrenoreceptors and cholinoreceptors has been revealed to stimulate hepatocarcinogenesis. On the contrary, the administration of alpha-adrenoreceptors antagonist or beta-adrenoreceptor and cholinoreceptors agonists inhibited the process of carcinogenic transformation. Caffeine, being the CNS stimulator, has significantly promoted carcinogenesis, while ethanol has practically prevented NDEA effect. Clonidine has also demonstrated its anticarcinogenic action. The obtained data are being discussed in connection with chemical carcinogenesis influence upon the CNS integrative function in control and regulation of tissue homeostasis.", 
    "52": "Simultaneous capillary and luminal microperfusion studies were performed in the rat proximal tubule to determine the effects of the beta agonist isoproterenol and the alpha agonist phenylephrine on water absorption. Capillary and luminal perfusion solutions were composed such that organic solutes were not present, no bicarbonate was present in the lumen, and no chloride gradient was imposed. Under such conditions, water absorption (Jv) averaged 0.36 +/- 0.11 nl . min-1 . mm-1. the addition of isoproterenol to the capillary solution in concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-4) M resulted in significantly higher Jv's of 0.68 +/- 0.10 and 0.71 +/- 0.11 nl . min-1 . mm-1, respectively. The enhancing effect of isoproterenol was inhibited by the beta blocker propranolol (10(-4) M), but not by the alpha blocker phentolamine (10(-7) M). The addition of phenylephrine (10(-6) M) to the capillary perfusion solution also resulted in a significantly higher Jv of 0.84 +/- 0.14 nl . min-1, an effect inhibited by phentolamine (10(-7) M), but not by propranolol (10(-4) M). Neither phentolamine nor propranolol alone in the concentrations indicated had an effect on water absorption. These experiments indicate that both alpha and beta agonists stimulate water absorption in the superficial proximal tubule of the rat. This effect appears to be relatively specific for each class of agonist, as demonstrated by the effects of the specific antagonists.", 
    "53": "In an effort to evaluate receptor binding drugs for their potential as gamma labeled radiopharmaceuticals suitable for clinical heart scanning, in vivo data were compared with the results obtained from a theoretical model. The distribution of selected tritium-labeled, receptor-binding radiotracers was studied in animals to determine if the heart to blood ratios agree with those obtained using a theoretical model of receptor binding. In general, the in vivo studies agree with the theoretical model when the concentration of the radiotracer in the heart is due to specific receptor binding. The use of the theoretical model for a first approximation followed by in vivo biodistribution studies is an efficient strategy to select those few from among the large number of receptor binding compounds that will ultimately yield an efficacious radiopharmaceutical to study receptor changes in the intact human heart.", 
    "54": "Verapamil is effective primary therapy for angina pectoris at a dosage of about 120 mg three times a day. In equal doses it has the same antianginal effect as propranolol although the mechanism of action is different. Long-term therapy is effective and well tolerated. Side effects are few and if required, verapamil may be given with nitrates or beta-blockers.", 
    "55": "The slow channel calcium blocking drugs have been shown to be efficacious in patients with chronic stable angina. They provide effective first alternative therapy to beta-blockers in preventing recurrent episodes of myocardial ischemia in patients who do not tolerate treatment with beta-blocking drugs because of, for example, pulmonary bronchospasm or hypoglycemia. The calcium blocking drugs often provide an additive effect in reducing anginal episodes when combined with beta-blocking agents and sometimes provide effective relief of chronic stable angina when beta-blocking drugs are unsuccessful. Diltiazem, nifedipine and verapamil are important additions to our therapeutic armentarium for the treatment of exercise-induced angina pectoris."
