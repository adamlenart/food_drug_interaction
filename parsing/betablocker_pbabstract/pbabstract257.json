The beta3-adrenoceptor agonist ZD 7114, like the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline, but unlike the beta1-adrenoceptor agonist dobutamine and the beta2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol, produced an increment on mouse embryonic fibroblast proliferation. The half-maximal stimulation of cell growth occurred at substantially lower concentrations with the beta3-adrenoceptor agonist (EC50: 5.5 x 10(-8) m) than with isoprenaline (EC50: 1.25 x 10(-6) m). 2. The selective beta3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR 5923 OA prevented the beta3-stimulated fibroblast proliferation. Conversely, practolol and butoxamine did not prevent fibroblast growth. 3. Additionally, a decrease of cAMP was obtained in fibroblasts cells upon stimulation with isoprenaline and ZD 7114. 4. The expression of beta-adrenoreceptors on fibroblast cells was also studied by radioligand binding. The Ki values in the presence of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist was two-fold higher than the Ki values for beta3 adrenoceptor antagonist indicating the presence of A3-receptor subtype. 5. Inhibitors of different intracellular coupling pathways including phospholipase C (U 73122), protein kinase C (staurosporine), calcium/calmodulin (trifluoroperazine) and calcium channel (verapamil), prevented the stimulatory actions of the selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonist ZD 7114. 6. The presence of beta3-adrenoceptors on embryonic mouse fibroblast cells may play a role in the modulation of cell growth and biologic activity. The mechanism by which ZD 7114 triggers cell proliferation and function, involves the activation of phospholipase C, PKC, calcium/calmodulin and the influx of calcium.", 
    "1": "Topical use of timolol eye drops in the management of glaucoma is associated with various systemic side effects including alteration of lipid profile with increase in cardiovascular risk factors. Change over to timolol gel altered results in normalisation of altered lipid profile with decrease in cardiovascular risk factors. The decrease seen is attributable to lack of systemic absorption of timolol gel.", 
    "2": "We investigated the concentration of stimulatory GTP-binding protein (Gs protein) in the peripheral resistance arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), and renovascular hypertensive rats (RHR). Changes in the function of Gs protein in SHR and WKY were also investigated by microcannulation techniques. The localization and abundance of Gs protein were determined immunohistochemically in 4-, 10- and 20-week-old SHR and age-matched WKY (control), as well as in RHR. Sections of the cremaster artery were stained with polyclonal antibodies to Gs protein. The concentration of Gs protein-like immunoreactivity in the cremaster artery was significantly lower in SHR at 4, 10, and 20 weeks of age, relative to that in age-matched WKY. In contrast, no significant differences were detected in the abundance of Gs between RHR and control rats. The dilatory response by isoproterenol in the presence of beta1-adrenoceptor blocker was lower in 4- and 10-week-old SHR than in age-matched WKY. The dilatory response by cholera toxin was also lower in SHR than in WKY for these two age groups. These results indicated that the amount and function of Gs protein in the peripheral resistance vessels in SHR was reduced. Since this change occurred before the onset of hypertension and no changes were seen in the secondary hypertensive rats, this change was not a secondary change due to hypertension. The impaired receptor-Gs protein-mediated signal transduction in the peripheral resistance arteries may be one of the possible mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of hypertension in SHR.", 
    "3": "The establishment of a new rate-correction method for the QT interval is presented for long-term telemetry ECG recording in free-moving beagle dogs. First, in order to define the QT-RR relation to derive the correction formula, the diurnal variations of the QT and RR intervals and the influencing factors were analyzed, and the QT-RR regression coefficient beta was estimated under various conditions: steady and non-steady states of animal, light and dark periods, and over 24 h. In the results, the diurnal rhythm of the QT interval was synchronized with the RR interval reflecting the physical and emotional states of the animal. The coefficient beta had considerable variation during the day: beta; 0.276 +/- 0.052 (maximum to minimum: 0.495 to 0.153). Thus, it was considered that the ideal rate-correction technique for telemetry ECG requires the selection of a flexible coefficient beta adjusted to the condition of the measurement. Therefore, rate-correction utilizing analysis of covariance estimating the coefficient beta for each dog, was compared with previously proposed formulas which fix the rate-correction coefficient, based on the capacity to dissociate the effects of heart rate on the QT interval. This was then tested by the levels of discrimination apparent in the QT prolongation caused by a class III antiarrhythmic drug, which ranked the formulas on the levels of correction achieved as follows: covariance adjustment > Matsunaga > Van de Water > Bazett. Thus, the rate-correction method utilizing analysis of covariance is proven adequate for data from telemetry ECG recordings.", 
    "4": "Single-drug treatment of essential hypertension (HT) is often insufficient to normalize blood pressure (BP), and high doses of antihypertensive agents can have adverse effects on glucose tolerance (GT) and insulin sensitivity. This study tested whether aggressive BP lowering with combination treatment had any influence on GT or insulin action. In all, 29 nonobese (body mass index [BMI], <30 kg/m ), normolipidemic patients with established HT (159 +/- 3/99 +/- 1 mm Hg) but normal GT were recruited. Eleven normotensive (125 +/- 3/85 +/- 1 mm Hg) subjects were matched to the patients for both anthropometric and metabolic variables. Following baseline studies (serum lipid profile, oral GT, insulin release, and insulin sensitivity assessed by the insulin clamp technique), patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to two combination regimens (verapamil 180 mg/day + trandolapril 2 mg/day or atenolol 50 mg/day + nifedipine 20 mg/day) and restudied 3 months later. Blood pressure was normalized in both groups (with decrements of 25 +/- 5/17 +/- 2 and 29 +/- 3/15 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively). Lipid profile, GT, insulin release, and insulin sensitivity of both glucose uptake and lipolysis were unchanged following both treatments. The authors conclude that in nonobese, normolipidemic, glucose-tolerant hypertensive patients, BP normalization with combination therapy is feasible at no cost in terms of undesired effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity.",

At day 80 posttransplantation, intimal thickness in AG-1295-treated grafts was reduced when compared to controls (11.8+/-9.1% intimal thickness vs. 23.7+/-6.4% intimal thickness; P=0.042). This finding corresponded to inhibition of intimal PDGFR-beta expression in AG-1295-treated grafts at day 20 posttransplantation (P =0.029 vs. allogeneic controls).",

    "8": "Chronic opioid receptor (OR) activation by morphine causes distinct cellular adaptations responsible for the development of tolerance. The present study examines the effect of chronic morphine exposure on the ability of high-efficacy agonists to mediate delta-OR (DOR) and mu-OR (MOR) uncoupling and internalization, two regulatory mechanisms contributing to rapid desensitization of OR function. Chronic morphine treatment (1 microm; 72 hr) of DOR carrying neuroblastoma x glioma (NG108-15) hybrid cells, a prototypical model system frequently used to study cellular aspects of opioid tolerance, completely blocked the capacity of [d-Ala2, d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE) and etorphine to desensitize opioid-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding and to mediate DOR internalization. Similar findings were obtained on stably DOR- and MOR-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Chronic morphine treatment also heterologously impaired agonist regulation of non-opioid G-protein-coupled receptors, such as the m(4)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and the brain-type cannabinoid receptor. As a possible underlying mechanism, we found that chronic morphine treatment completely blocked agonist-induced redistribution of beta-arrestin1 in both NG108-15 and stably MOR-transfected HEK293 cells. Moreover, attenuation of beta-arrestin1 function appears to depend on persistent stimulation of MAP kinase activity during the course of chronic morphine treatment, because coincubation of the cells together with the MAP kinase blocker PD98059 fully restored beta-arrestin1 translocation and receptor internalization. These results demonstrate that chronic morphine treatment produces adaptational changes at the beta-arrestin1 level, which in turn attenuates agonist-mediated desensitization and internalization of G-protein-coupled receptors.", 
    "9": "To investigate the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, peridopril, and the beta-adrenergic blocker, metoprolol, on plasma neuropeptide Y (NPY), and NPY receptors in aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), both strains of rats were fed with different doses of the drugs (peridopril or metoprolol) for 7 days to get the optimal dosages. After that, 18 male SHR and 18 male age-matched WKY rats were divided into three groups: control, peridopril (2mg/kg/day) and metoprolol (2mg/kg/day). After two months of treatment, VSMCs were isolated from the media layer of the aortic wall. Results showed that the SHRs had higher plasma concentrations and binding sites/affinity for NPY as compared to WKY rats. Peridopril dose-dependently decreased plasma NPY concentrations in WKY rats, and the absolute changes of plasma NPY were greater in SHRs than in WKY rats. Metoprolol showed none of these changes. Metoprolol decreased while peridopril increased NPY binding sites/affinity in SHRs. This indicated that lowered plasma NPY concentration and decreased NPY receptor in VSMCs, might play some roles in the anti-hypertensive mechanisms mediated by ACE inhibitor and beta-adrenergic blockers.", 
    "10": "The aim of our study was to analyse the mechanisms underlying cardiac toxicity caused by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation and the relationships with their associated downregulation during heart failure. We used the experimental model of coronary artery ligation-induced myocardial infarction in male Wistar rats. In order to increase beta-adrenergic stimulation, rats were subjected to a 15-day chronic isoprenaline administration (30 microg/kg/h). Isoprenaline administration induced haemodynamic inotropic compensation, almost abolished in vitro inotropic response to isoprenaline on papillary muscle (P<0.005) but promoted fibrosis. Isoprenaline treatment markedly reduced the B(max) of beta(2)-adrenoceptors (by 53% in sham and 44% in infarcted rats) but not that of beta(1)-adrenoceptors. These results suggest that beta(1)-adrenoceptors rather than beta(2)-adrenoceptors underlie the deleterious effects of chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation on cardiac fibrosis and are in agreement with the demonstrated benefit induced in human heart failure by beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "11": "International guidelines on asthma recommend to add inhaled long-acting b2-agonists in patients insufficiently controlled with an inhaled corticosteroid alone. A multicentre prospective study was carried out in 250 children (age 8.4 +/- 2.7 years) whose asthma remained symptomatic with impaired lung function despite a treatment with 400-1000 micrograms/day of beclomethasone or equivalent. Salmeterol 100 micrograms/day was added to the previous dose of inhaled corticosteroid for 2 months. PEFR was improved as soon as the first month of treatment (67.2 +/- 44.4 L/min, p < 0.001) and at month 2 (75.0 +/- 44.1 L/min, p < 0.001). The percentage of symptomatic patients, the number of days and nights with symptoms, the number of days with prn bronchodilator use were significantly reduced (p < 0.001). The decrease in the distress and severity scores of the Childhood Asthma Questionnaire indicated an improvement in quality of life due to better asthma control. This study showed that lung function and symptoms were significantly improved as soon as the first month of treatment, improvement maintained thereafter, with a better quality of life and a good tolerability.", 
    "12": "Whereas the earlier conceptual targets of heart failure therapy, such as the cardio-renal and hemodynamic models, all fulfilled the basic needs of symptomatic relief and hemodynamic improvement, only the neurohormonal model has provided an effective target to address symptom relief in concert with survival benefits. Recent data allude to a disease-modifying effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) in retarding the new development of heart failure in high-risk populations. Angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) have not been demonstrated to be superior to ACE-Is and their value in achieving incremental benefits in addition to ACE-Is is limited to scenarios in which beta-adrenergic receptor blocker therapy is not applicable. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in addition to ACE inhibition offers incremental benefits that are achieved early and are beneficial in most stages of severity except in the presence of overt decompensation. Unlike ACE-Is, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers cannot be construed as a class but are heterogeneous in their therapeutic response.", 
    "13": "This study was designed to validate the measures of heart period variability for assessing of autonomic nervous system control in calves. Eight calves received an injection of either 0.5 mg/kg atenolol (sympathetic tone blockade), 0.2 mg/kg atropine sulfate (parasympathetic tone blockade), 0.5 mg/kg atenolol + 0.2 mg/kg atropine sulfate (double autonomic blockade) or saline. In the time-domain, we calculated the mean instantaneous heart rate (HR), mean of RR intervals (MeanRR), standard deviation of RR intervals (SDRR) and that of the difference between adjacent intervals (RMSSD). In the frequency-domain, the power of the spectral band 0-1 Hz (TPW), the power of the 0-0.15 Hz band (LF), that of the 0.15-1 Hz band (HF), and the LF/HF ratio were considered. The net vago-sympathetic effect (VSE) was calculated as the ratio of MeanRR in a defined situation to MeanRR during the double blockade. Atenolol injection had no effect on cardiac activity, whereas atropine induced large modifications which were moderated when atenolol was administered at the same time. VSE, HR, MeanRR and RMSSD were found to be valid indicators of the parasympathetic tone of calves because of large variations due to the drug and low individual variations. No measure reflected the sympathetic tone.", 
    "14": "Only a few studies have evaluated the efficacy of alpha-blocking agents in combination with other classes of antihypertensive agents, especially in patients not adequately controlled by monotherapy.

The patients received either terazosin (n = 26; dose 1 to 10 mg) or atenolol (n = 28; dose 25 to 100 mg). Blood pressure was assessed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement and serum lipids were evaluated at the time of inclusion and 12 weeks later.", 
    "16": "Blood pressure was similar after 12 weeks of treatment (atenolol: 129 (9)/75 (7) mm Hg; terazosin: 128 (11)/75 (9) mm Hg) and total cholesterol was significantly reduced after 12 weeks of treatment (atenolol: Diff 0-12 weeks: 7.29 (1.32) versus 6.62 (1.14 mmol/L, p = 0.006; terazosin: 7.34 (0.93) versus 6.67 (0.85) mmol/L, p = 0.002). In the terazosin group, HDL-cholesterol increased and triglycerides decreased significantly (Diff 0-12 weeks: HDL-chol: 1.55 (0.31) versus 1.63 (0.44) mmol/L, p = 0.04; TG: 1.93 (1.17) versus 1.34 (0.64) mmol/L, p = 0.03). Comparing both groups a significant difference was found with regard to HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides (atenolol versus terazosin: HDL-chol: -0.05 (0.12) versus +0.08 (0.1) mmol/L, p = 0.04; TG: -0.18 (0.61) versus--0.59 (0.6), p = 0.03).",

    "18": "Short-term carvedilol administration is more powerful than propranolol in decreasing hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) in cirrhotic patients, but induces arterial hypotension that may prevent its long-term use in portal hypertensive patients. This study compared the HVPG reduction and safety of long-term carvedilol and propranolol. Fifty-one cirrhotic patients were randomly assigned to receive carvedilol (n = 26) and propranolol (n = 25). Hemodynamic measurements and renal function were assessed at baseline and after 11.1 +/- 4.1 weeks. Carvedilol caused a greater decrease in HVPG than popranolol (-19 +/- 2% vs. -12 +/- 2%; P <.001). The proportion of patients achieving an HVPG reduction >/=20% or </=12 mm Hg was greater after carvedilol (54% vs. 23%; P <.05). Carvedilol, but not propranolol caused a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) (-11 +/- 1% vs. -5 +/- 3%; P =.05) and a significant increase in plasma volume (PV) and body weight (11 +/- 5% and 2 +/- 1%, respectively; P <.05). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unchanged with either drug, but the dose of diuretics was increased more frequently after carvedilol (27% vs. 8%; P =.07). Adverse events requiring discontinuation of treatment occurred in 2 patients receiving carvedilol and in 3 receiving propranolol. In conclusion, carvedilol has a greater portal hypotensive effect than propranolol in patients with cirrhosis. However, its clinical applicability may be limited by its systemic hypotensive effects. Further trials are needed to confirm the therapeutic potential of carvedilol.", 
    "19": "We report the results of adapting medical therapy to the monitoring of hemodynamic response in the prevention of a first variceal bleeding or rebleeding in patients with cirrhosis. Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was measured before and after propranolol was initiated. The patients were considered responders if HVPG decreased below 12 mm Hg or at least 20% as compared with baseline value. If patients were not responders, isosorbide-5 mononitrate (I-5MN) was added, and a third hemodynamic study was performed. Thereafter, the patients were followed for a mean of 28 months. Thirty-four consecutive patients were treated to prevent a first bleeding episode in 20 patients and a rebleeding in 14 patients. HVPG value was initially 19.8 +/- 4.6 mm Hg and decreased to 17.6 +/- 5.7 mm Hg (P <.05) after propranolol alone. Thirteen patients (38%) were responders to propranolol. I-5MN improved hemodynamic response in 7 cases. Among these 20 (59%) hemodynamic responders, only 2 (10%) experienced variceal bleeding, as compared with 9 of 14 (64%) nonresponders (P <.05). Using multivariate analysis, only hemodynamic response was found to have an independent predictive value for the risk of variceal bleeding. In conclusion, hemodynamic response to drug therapy identifies patients who are efficiently protected from variceal bleeding as well as nonresponders in whom an alternative treatment should be considered.",

    "21": "The study population consisted of a prospective cohort of patients reporting to 2 regional poison centers with beta-blocker overdose. Each patient received an ECG on presentation and a structured follow-up. The inclusion criteria for symptomatic overdose included heart rate of less than 60 beats/min or systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg; symptoms consistent with decreased end-organ perfusion; therapeutic intervention with cardioactive medication; and corroboration by 2 of the authors that this was a clear-cut case of symptomatic beta-blocker overdose with cardiovascular toxicity. Exclusion criteria included cardioactive coingestants, age younger than 6 years, and no available ECG.", 
    "22": "Of 167 patients, 13 were determined to have symptomatic exposures. First-degree heart block (>200 ms) was the most common ECG finding (10/12) and also had the greatest likelihood ratio (5.31) when comparing those with symptomatic exposures with those with asymptomatic exposures. Comparing the asymptomatic with the symptomatic groups, the mean PR interval was 167 ms (95% confidence interval [CI] 162 to 171 ms) versus 216 ms (95% CI 193 to 238 ms), the mean QRS interval was 89 ms (95% CI 87 to 91 ms) versus 112 ms (95% CI 92 to 132 ms), the mean QTc interval was 422 ms (95% CI 417 to 428) versus 462 ms (95% CI 434 to 490 ms), and the mean heart rate was 72 beats/min (95% CI 69 to 74 beats/min) versus 66 beats/min (95% CI 59 to 73 beats/min).

The ongoing Initiation Management Predischarge Process for Assessment of Carvedilol Therapy for Heart Failure (IMPACT-HF) study was designed to determine if initiation of beta-blockade prior to hospital discharge is safe and effective in improving the 60-day use of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure. IMPACT-HF is a community-based, multicenter, open-label trial of 375 heart failure patients randomized to carvedilol initiated before their hospital discharge or to usual care (Heart Failure Society of America guidelines that recommend waiting 2-4 weeks after hospitalization for heart failure before initiating beta-blocker therapy). The entry criteria are nonrestrictive to ensure inclusion of patients reflective of the general heart failure population. The primary endpoint of the study is the number of patients treated with any beta-blocker at 60 days. A concurrently ongoing pilot registry will enroll 550 patients, admitted with exacerbated heart failure, in three phases to collect demographic, clinical, treatment patterns, and outcome data. The trial will test the tolerability of beta-blocker initiation in the hospital setting, develop strategies to improve the use of evidence-based medicine in clinical practice, and explore the patient's course from hospital admission through discharge and up to 60 days. The trial data will determine if in-hospital initiation of beta-blocker therapy is effective at improving the long-term use of pharmacologic agents proven to reduce morbidity and mortality.", 
    "25": "There is a growing economic burden from the treatment of heart failure that accounts for more than 5% of total health care expenditures. Hospitalization contributes between 60% and 75% of this total expense. The addition of beta-blockers to conventional heart failure therapy results in a significant reduction in hospitalization. As a consequence, beta-blocker therapy in heart failure is very cost-effective and compares favorably to that of other generally accepted medical interventions", 
    "26": "Because much can be done now to block the devastating natural course of heart failure, it is important to understand the role of various treatment paradigms and to institute them in as many patients as possible, with the use of well-constructed practice guidelines to provide common themes for treating specific patients. However, guidelines cannot address all relevant clinical situations, consensus often cannot be reached because evidence is not always available regarding certain therapeutic strategies, and guideline development can be a slow, politically charged, and difficult process. In addition, one must assess compliance with guidelines and the impact of recommendations on outcomes. Continuous quality improvement initiatives in large group practices and hospitals achieve this goal most effectively. Assessment of the impact and accountability with regard to compliance can then be re-related to clinical experience and observation, triggering additional therapeutic developments and strategies that will focus on continued practice improvement. Continuous quality improvement initiatives in the hospital setting have many advantages and are generally seen as good business practice; because of the regulations hospitals are subject to, particularly the linking of payments to hospital accreditation, systems are in place to improve practice patterns.", 
    "27": "Outcomes for heart failure have improved considerably with the implementation of neurohormonal antagonism that includes angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. Despite the robust benefit of beta-blockers for heart failure, it is not clear that the benefit can be extended to all patient groups. Special clinical consideration thus needs to be given to the elderly, women, and African Americans. A retrospective review of available data suggests that despite differences in the natural history of heart failure for these groups, significant benefit can still be expected from the use of beta-blockers for heart failure. Future trials will address these groups in a prospective manner.", 
    "28": "Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs have been shown to improve survival and well-being of patients with mild to moderate heart failure. In more advanced heart failure, the relationship between the short-term hemodynamic support afforded by activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the harm that results from excess sympathetic activation is more complex. Not all studies of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs or antiadrenergic therapy have shown benefit. The Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) trial has revealed that the combined nonselective beta-adrenergic and a-adrenergic receptor blocking drug carvedilol produces an important salutary effect on the natural history of advanced heart failure. Mortality was reduced by 35% in the carvedilol group, from an annual (Kaplan-Meier) rate of 18.5% to 11.4%. All-cause hospitalizations were reduced by 20% and hospitalization from heart failure by 33%. Even amongst the subgroups at highest risk, no subpopulation could be identified that did not appear to benefit. The trial supports extending the population of those with chronic heart failure who should be routinely treated with beta-adrenergic blocking drugs (in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition therapy) to patients with more advanced disease.", 
    "29": "Chronic heart failure continues to increase in incidence and prevalence despite many pharmacologic advances over the previous decade. Morbidity and mortality remain high, with the number of hospitalizations for worsening heart failure in 1999 approaching 1 million. In addition to investigation of new therapies for the treatment of heart failure, attention must be placed on identifying effective methods for increasing the adoption of proven therapies. First, the potential barriers to implementation of evidence-based medicine must be recognized. Subsequently, strategies to overcome such barriers can be developed. Published guidelines may be helpful in educating practitioners on current standards of care. Other tools may also be considered, and testing the influence of such tools on the implementation of optimal therapy may help the scientific community better understand the factors that influence decision-making among clinicians.", 
    "30": "Patients with heart failure face a very high risk of hospitalizations and mortality. Despite the compelling scientific evidence that beta-blockers reduce hospitalizations and mortality in patients with heart failure, this lifesaving therapy continues to be underutilized. A number of studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that a significant proportion of patients with heart failure are not receiving treatment with this guideline-recommended, evidence-based therapy when guided by conventional care. A similar treatment gap has been documented for lipid-lowering therapy in patients with coronary heart disease. The demonstration that initiation of lipid-lowering and other cardioprotective medications prior to hospital discharge for atherosclerotic cardiovascular events results in a marked increase in treatment rates, improved long-term patient compliance, and better clinical outcomes has led to national guidelines being revised to endorse this approach as the standard of care. In-hospital initiation of beta-blocker therapy for heart failure could be reasonably expected to result in similar improvements in treatment rates and clinical outcomes. Recent data suggest that beta-blockers can be safely and effectively initiated in heart failure patients prior to hospital discharge, and that clinical outcomes are improved. Adopting in-hospital initiation of beta-blocker therapy as the standard of care for patients hospitalized with heart failure could dramatically improve treatment rates and thus substantially reduce the risk of future hospitalizations and prolong life in the large number of patients hospitalized each year.", 
    "31": "Approximately 6 million Americans have combined chronic cardiovascular and kidney disease. This clinical intersection presents unique risks to the patient and unique challenges to the clinician. Observational studies have provided quantitative methods for estimating the risk of acute renal failure in patients undergoing percutaneous intervention and bypass surgery procedures. Fortunately, for the general cardiovascular population these risks are small. On the other hand, patients with chronic kidney disease have increased risks of accelerated atherosclerosis, nonfatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac death. Chronic kidney disease presents difficult scenarios in using conventional cardioprotective therapy. However, there are increasing bodies of evidence to suggest the kidney and the heart can be targeted with lines of therapy, specifically with renin-angiotensin system antagonism, that benefit both systems with respect to reduction in the progression of disease, and the prevention of hard kidney and cardiac endpoints. This article will focus on the cardiorenal intersection and highlight innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies concerning this high-risk patient group.",

With the use of 1 mg/l propranolol with 1 mM [Ca(2+)](o), LVP and [Ca(2+)](i) were increased significantly from 48.7 +/- 8.18 to 56.3 +/- 6.11 mmHg and from 0.61 +/- 0.11 to 1.17 +/- 0.20 microM, respectively (P < 0.05). In conclusion, positive inotropism of such electrical currents was due to increased peak [Ca(2+)](i) and Ca(2+) responsiveness of the myofilaments did not change significantly.", 
    "33": "The presence and functionality of beta-adrenoceptors (beta-ARs) were examined in red (RM) and white muscle (WM) membranes isolated from the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Specific binding assays revealed the presence of a single class of binding sites with similar affinities in both muscle types (K(d) in nM: 0.14 +/- 0.03 and 0.18 +/- 0.03 for RM and WM, respectively) but with a significantly higher number of binding sites in RM compared with WM (B(max) in fmol/mg protein: 3.22 +/- 0.11 and 2.60 +/- 0.13, respectively). Selective and nonselective beta-adrenergic agonists (beta-AAs) and antagonists indicated an atypical beta-AR pharmacology. This result may represent a nonmammalian beta-AR classification or, more likely, the presence of more than one beta-AR subtype in trout muscles with similar affinities that could not be kinetically resolved. Adenylyl cyclase (ACase) assays showed a dose-dependent increase in cAMP production as concentrations of beta(2)-AAs increased in both muscle membranes with significantly higher basal cAMP production in RM compared with WM (cAMP production in pmol cAMP. mg protein(-1). 10 min(-1): 24.67 +/- 3.06 and 9.64 +/- 3.45, respectively). The agonist-induced increase in cAMP production was blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, while the ACase activator forskolin increased cAMP production by 7- to 14-fold above basal and approximately 3-fold above all beta-AAs tested. This study demonstrated the presence of atypical beta(2)-ARs on RM and WM membranes of trout, suggesting that beta(2)-AAs may be a tool to enhance protein accretion through this signaling pathway.", 
    "34": "During terminal erythroid differentiation, degradation of RNA is a potential source for nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) that act as allosteric effectors of hemoglobin. In this investigation, we assessed the developmental profile of RNA and purine/pyrimidine trinucleotides in circulating embryonic chick red blood cells (RBC). Extensive changes of the NTP pattern are observed which differ significantly from what is observed for adult RBC. The biochemical mechanisms have not been identified yet. Therefore, we studied the role of AMP deaminase and IMP/GMP 5'-nucleotidase, which are key enzymes for the regulation of the purine nucleotide pool. Finally, we tested the effect of major NTPs on the oxygen affinity of embryonic/adult hemoglobin. The results are as follows. 1) Together with ATP, UTP and CTP serve as allosteric effectors of hemoglobin. 2) Degradation of erythroid RNA is apparently a major source for NTPs. 3) Developmental changes of nucleotide content depend on the activities of key enzymes (AMP deaminase, IMP/GMP 5'-nucleotidase, and pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase). 4) Oxygen-dependent hormonal regulation of AMP deaminase adjusts the red cell ATP concentration and therefore the hemoglobin oxygen affinity.", 
    "35": "BACKGROUND: The cardiac diagnostic examination activity in a population should ideally mirror age and gender characteristics of the prevalence of ischemic heart disease. In this study, the prescription of anti-anginal drugs in relation to morbidity and mortality brought on by ischemic heart disease, and in relation to exercise tests and coronary angiography, is analyzed. METHODS: The study population comprised two Danish counties with a total of 896,954 inhabitants. We obtained data on all prescriptions of nitrates, adrenergic beta-antagonists, and calcium channel blockers from regional pharmaceutical registers. Data on all patients who took an exercise test or underwent coronary angiography were derived from regional health authority registers. Data on ischemic heart mortality and on the incidence of myocardial infarction were gathered from the national register of causes of death and hospital registers. RESULTS: Only patients receiving nitrates had an age and gender profile matching that of those who died from ischemic heart disease or who suffered from myocardial infarction (correlation coefficients 0.95-0.99). Judging from the prescription of nitrates, relatively few elderly patients, especially women older than 60-69 years, were referred for a cardiac examination. CONCLUSIONS: The prescription of nitrates seems useful as a surrogate marker for ischemic heart disease. Elderly patients, especially women, seem to be treated with anti-anginal medication without any diagnostic evaluation.", 
    "36": "Morphine through mu-opioid receptors and G(i/o) proteins modulates several cellular effector systems; however, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase are not well known. We evaluated the effect of two mu-opioid receptor agonists on ouabain-sensitive Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in mice forebrain synaptosomes, and examined the modulation of this effect by antagonists of opioid receptors and a blocker of G(i/o) proteins. Incubation of synaptosomes with morphine (10(-9) to 10(-4) M) or buprenorphine (10(-10) to 10(-5) M) concentration-dependently stimulated Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity, morphine being less potent but more efficacious than buprenorphine. Morphine did not displace [3H]ouabain from its binding site (Na(+),K(+)-ATPase) to forebrain membranes, whereas ouabain did so in a concentration-dependent manner. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist (10(-6) M), added to the synaptosomal medium, antagonized the enhancement of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity induced by morphine, producing a parallel shift to the right of the morphine concentration-response curve. Treatment with beta-funaltrexamine, a mu antagonist (2.5 and 10 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) and naloxonazine, a mu1 antagonist (35 mg/kg, s.c.), 24 h before the synaptosomes were obtained, produced a dose-dependent reduction in the E(max) of the morphine-induced increase in Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in vitro, but did not significantly modify its EC(50). Pertussis toxin (G(i/o) protein blocker) treatment at a dose of 0.5 microg/mouse, administered i.c.v. 5 days before the synaptosomes were obtained, completely abolished the enhancement of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity induced by morphine. A lower dose (0.25 microg/mouse) decreased the E(max) of morphine by 50% but did not significantly affect its EC(50). These results suggest that morphine indirectly enhances Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in the brain by activating mu-opioid receptors and G(i/o) proteins.",

The beta(3)-selective agonist BRL37344 significantly reduced the I(Ks) step current at +70 mV in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50): 5.01 nmol/l). In the presence of bupranolol (beta(1)-, beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist), the effect of BRL37344 was markedly attenuated, from 27.3+/-5.6% (100 nmol/l BRL37344 alone) to 4.0+/-1.3% (100 nmol/l BRL37344+1 micromol/l bupranolol).

    "41": "The effect of carvedilol on intracellular free Ca(2+) levels ([Ca(2+)](i)) has not been explored previously. This study was aimed to examine the effect of carvedilol on Ca(2+) handling in renal tubular cells. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were used as a model for renal tubular cells and fura-2 was used as a fluorescent Ca(2+) probe. Carvedilol increased [Ca(2+)](i) in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC(50) value of 5 microM. Extracellular Ca(2+) removal partly inhibited the [Ca(2+)](i) signals. Carvedilol-induced Ca(2+) influx was verified by measuring Mn(2+)-induced quench of fura-2 fluorescence. Carvedilol-induced store Ca(2+) release was reduced by pretreatment with 1 microM thapsigargin (an endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor) but not with 5 microM ryanodine or 2 microM carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (a mitochondrial uncoupler). Carvedilol (30 microM)-induced Ca(2+) release was not affected by inhibiting phospholipase C with 1-(6-((17beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-l)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U73122; 2 microM), but was potentiated by increasing cAMP levels or inhibiting protein kinase C. The carvedilol-induced Ca(2+) mobilization was not significantly sequestered by the endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria. This study shows that carvedilol increased [Ca(2+)](i) in renal tubular cells by causing Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum and other unknown stores in an inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-independent manner, and by inducing Ca(2+) influx. The Ca(2+) release was modulated by cAMP and protein kinase C.", 
    "42": "We examined the immunomodulatory potential of acute fenfluramine administration, by measuring production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in response to an in vivo challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide in rats. Fenfluramine (2.5-10 mg/kg) suppressed tumor necrosis factor-alpha production, but only fenfluramine (5 and 10 mg/kg) suppressed interleukin-1beta production. Fenfluramine (10 mg/kg)-induced suppression of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production persisted for 6 and 24 h, respectively. Using in vitro analyses, we demonstrated that the immunosuppressive effect of fenfluramine was not due to a direct effect on immune cells. As fenfluramine activates the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, we examined the ability of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone to block fenfluramine-induced immunosuppression. However, mifepristone (10 mg/kg) failed to attenuate the suppressive effect of fenfluramine on interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production, indicating that glucocorticoids do not mediate fenfluramine-induced immunosuppression. We also assessed the effect of fenfluramine on production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, as interleukin-10 can suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Fenfluramine (10 mg/kg) increased interleukin-10 production following an in vivo lipopolysaccharide challenge. However, the ability of fenfluramine to suppress tumor necrosis factor-alpha production cannot be accounted for by increased interleukin-10 production, as pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist nadolol completely blocked the increase in interleukin-10 without altering the suppression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced by fenfluramine. Taken together, these data demonstrate that fenfluramine promotes an immunosuppressive cytokine phenotype in vivo. The suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines is not due to a direct effect the drug on immune cells, and also occurs independently of glucocorticoid receptor activation. In addition, whilst fenfluramine increases production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, this cannot account for the suppression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced by fenfluramine.", 
    "43": "Hydrophilic and lipophilic polymers are widely used excipients to control the release rate of drugs from matrices. Researchers found that surfactants are able to control the release rate of drugs. The aim of the present investigation is to determine the effects of surfactant type, its concentration and the different ratios of surfactants on the release rate of highly soluble drug (propranolol HCl). In this study, sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) as an anionic surfactant, cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as a cationic surfactant, Tween 65 and Arlacel 60 as non-ionic surfactants were selected. The different concentrations of surfactants were incorporated into hydroxypropylmethylcellulose-Eudragit matrices and then dissolution rate of the drug from the matrices were evaluated at pH 1.2 or 6.8. The results showed that the release rate of propranolol decreased as the concentration of SLS increased. This is due to that SLS is able to form complex with propranolol. In contrast Tween 65 caused an increase in the release rate of the drug. Cationic surfactant (CTAB) had little effect on the release rate of the drug. It was shown that as the ratio of CTAB:SLS increased the release rate of propranolol increased from matrices. This indicated that as CTAB is able to interact with SLS molecules, therefore number of the interacting anionic molecules with the cationic drug was decreased. It can be concluded that, the type and ionization of surfactant, hydrophilicity and lipophilicity of surface active agent and various ratios of surfactants are important factors in controlling the release rate of propranolol.", 
    "44": "It is hypothesised that the visual performance of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, will be impaired by strenuous exercise as a result of metabolic stress (blood lactacidosis) that activates the Root effect and limits the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood flowing to the eye. The ability to resolve high contrast objects on a moving background, as a measure of visual performance, was quantified pre- and post-exercise using the optomotor response. Strenuous exercise induced a metabolic acidosis (8.0 mmol l(-1) blood lactate) and a significant red cell swelling response but no change in the optomotor response threshold (120 min of arc) was observed. Beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol) abolished post-exercise red cell swelling but optomotor response thresholds were still maintained at 120 min of arc despite a significant blood lactate load (7.8 mmol l(-1)). The choroid rete mirabile of the trout is extremely well developed (rete area:eye area = 0.39) and may maintain visual performance by ensuring a relatively direct supply of oxygen to the central regions of the avascular retina. Exercised fish under beta-adrenergic blockade exhibited an enhanced optomotor response at 240-300 min of arc. Assuming that these responses reflect \"tunnel vision\", adrenergic regulation of red cell function may preserve a high ocular PO(2) gradient that satisfies the oxygen demand of peripheral retinal cells.",

    "46": "The long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac disorder characterized by prolongation of the QT interval on electrocardiograms (ECGs), syncope and sudden death caused by a specific ventricular tachyarrhythmia known as torsade de pointes. LQTS is caused by mutations in ion channel genes including the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A, and potassium channel subunit genes KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCNE1, and KCNE2. Little information is available about LQTS mutations in the Chinese population. In this study, we characterized 42 Chinese LQTS families for mutations in the two most common LQTS genes, KCNQ1 and KCNH2. We report here the identification of four novel KCNQ1 mutations and three novel KCNH2 mutations. The KCNQ1 mutations include L191P in the S2-S3 cytoplasmic loop, F275S and S277L in the S5 transmembrane domain, and G306V in the channel pore. The KCNH2 mutations include L413P in transmembrane domain S1, E444D in the extracellular loop between S1 and S2, and L559H in domain S5. The location and character of these mutations expand the spectrum of KCNQ1 and KCNH2 mutations causing LQTS. Excitement, exercises, and stress appear to be the triggers for developing cardiac events (syncope, sudden death) for LQTS patients with KCNQ1 mutations F275S, S277L, and G306V, and all three KCNH2 mutations L413P, E444D and L559H. In contrast, cardiac events for an LQTS patient with KCNQ1 mutation L191P occurred during sleep or awakening from sleep. KCNH2 mutations L413P and L559H are associated with the bifid T waves on ECGs. Inderal or propanolol (a beta blocker) appears to be effective in preventing arrhythmias and syncope for an LQTS patient with the KCNQ1 L191P mutation.",

The direct and indirect presynaptic modulation of glutamate release and its susceptibility to changes in the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP), Ca(2+) and calmodulin (CaM) and in protein phosphorylation was characterized by pharmacological manipulations. The agonists of iGluRs, 2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and kainate, stimulated the basal release of D-[3H]aspartate, while N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) was without effect. Both the AMPA- and kainate-mediated responses were accentuated by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol. These facilitatory effects were mimicked by the permeable cAMP analogue dibutyryl-cAMP. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor MDL12,330A, the inhibitor of PKA and PKC, H-7, and the PKA inhibitor H-89 abolished the isoproterenol effect on the kainate-evoked release. The dibutyryl-cAMP-induced potentiation was also attenuated by H-7. Isoproterenol, propranolol and MDL12,330A failed to affect the basal release of D-[3H]aspartate, but dibutyryl-cAMP was inhibitory and MDL12,330A activatory. In Ca(2+)-free medium, the kainate-evoked release was enhanced, being further accentuated by the CaM antagonists calmidazolium and trifluoperazine, though these inhibited the basal release. The potentiating effect of calmidazolium on the kainate-stimulated release was counteracted by both MDL12,330A and H-7. We conclude that AMPA- and kainate-evoked glutamate release from striatal glutamatergic terminals is potentiated by beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation and cAMP accumulation. Glutamate release is enhanced if the Ca(2+)- and CaM-dependent, kainate-evoked processes do not prevent the excessive accumulation of intracellular cAMP.", 
    "57": "Evidence has accumulated recently about the importance of alterations in Na+ channel function and slow myocardial conduction for arrhythmias in the infarcted and failing heart. The present study tested a hypothesis that Na+ current (INa/C) density decreases in chronic heart failure (HF) and that Na+ channel (NaCh) functional density can be restored by long-term therapy with carvedilol, a mixed alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocker. Studies were performed using a canine model of chronic HF produced in dogs by sequential intracoronary embolizations with microspheres. HF developed approximately 3 months after the last embolization (left ventricle, LV, ejection fraction = 28 +/- 1%). Ventricular cardiomyocytes (VCs) were isolated enzymatically from LV mid-myocardium, and INa was measured by whole-cell patch-clamp. The maximum INa/C was decreased in failing (n = 19) compared to normal (n = 12) hearts (33.1 +/- 1.6 vs 48.5 +/- 5.1 pA/pF, mean +/- SE, p < 0.001). The steady-state inactivation and activation of INa remained unchanged in failing compared to normal hearts. Long-term treatment with carvedilol (1 mg/kg, twice daily for 3 months) normalized INa/C in dogs with HF. INa/C in HF dogs (n = 6) treated with carvedilol was higher compared to that of non-treated HF dogs (n = 6) (49.4 +/- 0.9 vs 29 +/- 4.8 pA/pF, p < 0.007). In vitro culture of VCs of failing hearts for 24 h did not restore INa/C. However, INa/C was partially restored when VCs were incubated for 24 h with BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca2+ buffer. Thus, we conclude that experimental chronic HF in dogs results in down-regulation of the functional density of NaCh that can be restored by long-term therapy with carvedilol. The mechanism of NaCh down-regulation in HF may be linked to poor Ca2+ handling in this stage of disease.",

We reviewed the published data to clarify the role of beta blockade in patients who had surgical revascularization after myocardial infarction.

Although there are differences in the pharmacological properties of the beta-blockers shown to improve morbidity and mortality in heart failure, there is little evidence to suggest that such properties constitute any major advantages in clinical outcome. Carvedilol and extended-release metoprolol succinate are 2 beta-blockers currently approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with heart failure.

    "74": "The beta-adrenergic receptors of the myocardium play an important role in the regulation of heart function. The beta-adrenergic receptors belong to the family of G-protein coupled receptors. Three subtypes have been distinguished (beta1-, beta2-, and beta3-adrenoceptors). The receptors consist of seven membrane-spanning domains, three intra- and three extracellular loops, one extracellular N-terminal domain, and one intracellular C-terminal tail.", 
    "75": "Stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors by catecholamines is realized via the beta-adrenoceptor-adenylylcyclase-protein kinase A cascade. The second messenger is the cyclic AMP (cAMP). Stimulation of the cascade caused an accumulation of the second messenger cAMP and activated via the cAMP the cAMP dependent protein kinase A (PKA) The PKA phosphorylated, beside other cell proteins, the beta-adrenergic receptors. A phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptors caused - with exception of the beta3-adrenoceptor - an uncoupling and desensitisation of the receptors. Phosphorylation via the G-protein receptor kinase (GRK or betaARK) also caused uncoupling and reduced the beta-adrenergic responsiveness. The uncoupling of the receptor is the prerequisite for receptor internalisation. In the process of internalisation the receptor shifted from the sarcolemma membrane into cytosolic compartments. Chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation caused a down-regulation of the receptors. During this process of desensitisation the expression of the receptor on mRNA and protein level is reduced.", 
    "76": "In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy the beta-adrenergic responsiveness of the myocardium is diminished. It was shown that in these patients the expression of the beta1-adrenergic receptor is reduced on the mRNA and protein level. In these patients the expression of the inhibitory G-protein G(i) is increased. Furthermore, the expression of the G-protein receptor kinase is elevated. This kinase induces the uncoupling of the beta-adrenergic receptors. These alterations of the beta-adrenoceptor signal cascade may be induced by an elevated catecholamine release or by agonist-like autoantibodies directed against the beta1-adrenergic receptor found in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Both, permanent stimulation with catecholamines and chronic treatment with agonistic anti-beta1-adrenoceptor autoantibodies cause a reduction of the expression of the beta1-adrenoceptor on mRNA and protein level in \"in vitro\" experiments. Moreover, an over-expression of the beta1-adrenoceptor, the stimulatory G(s) protein, and the protein kinase A induce detrimental alterations of the cardiac function and morphology in transgenic animals. These animals developed heart failure accompanied by an increased mortality rate.", 
    "77": "Coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction are the most frequent causes of death in the Western societies. Even nowadays, every second myocardial infarction is lethal and hits the patients unexpectedly without previous signs or symptoms. In order to install preventive measures most efficiently, it is necessary to have a detailed knowledge on the pathophysiology of the disease. The identification of patients who are at high risk for suffering from myocardial infarction can be done with epidemiological methods, such as the determination of \"traditional\" risk factors, like arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus or smoking), or eventually in the future using molecular genetic testing. This is of great importance especially for asymptomatic siblings and children from myocardial infarction patients.", 
    "78": "Although traditional risk factors occur frequently in families, they explain only in part the familial accumulation of coronary artery disease. Furthermore, stron genetic effects on the development of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction have been demonstrated in several studies. These genetic effects can be examined by 1. a candidate gene approach, or 2. a systematic screening of the whole genome. In the first step, several polymorphisms (sequence variations) wee examined in several candidate genes in which a significant influence on a cardiovascular risk factor or intermediate phenotype (such as atherogeneic lipid profile or arterial hypertension) has been shown in the literature. We thus examined in a large population of patients with myocardial infarction and a sample of the general population the effects of the HindIII polymorphism in the lipoproteinlipase gene, of the -344T/C promoter polymorphism in the aldosterone synthase gene and of the 825C/T polymorphism in the gene of the beta3 subunit of the G protein gene (GNB3). In the general population, we could show an association with unfavorable lipid levels in men and in postmenopausal (but not premenopausal) women for the H2H2 genotype of the HindIII lipoproteinlipase polymorphism. However, the theoretical increase in risk for this genotype is not large enough to demonstrate a significant association with myocardial infarction in the population examined. With the promoter polymorphism in the aldosterone synthase gene, anthropometrical and echocardiographical data did not suggest that the polymorphism is a risk factor for myocardial infarction nor for left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction, which was observed in earlier studies. Furthermore, we could show an association with arterial hypertension in our general population sample with the polymorphism in the GNB3 gene. However, no association could be demonstrated for this polymorphism with myocardial infarction. AFFECTED SIB-PAIR APPROACH: In a systematic screening of the genome for genes that are relevant in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction, an affected sib-pair approach was followed. 1,261 families were identified in which at least two brothers or sisters were affected with myocardial infarction or severe coronary artery disease, such as percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary after bypass grafting. In a subpopulation of 513 families and 1,407 individuals, we performed a total genome screening. The analyses using the variance component method and the SOLAR program revealed a susceptibility locus for myocardial infarction of chromosome 14q32 with a lod score of 3.89 (genome-wide p < 0.05). This locus comprises a region of about seven centi-Morgan and contains approximately 150 genes. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis including the cardiovascular risk factors showed that 1. this myocardial infarction locus is unique and does not overlap with chromosomal loci for well-established risk factors, 2. cardiovascular risk factors, such as Lp(a), diabetes mellitus, serum lipids, or arterial hypertension have strong genetic components.", 
    "79": "These findings do not exclude a role of cardiovascular s do not exclude a role of cardiovascular risk factors or candidate genes in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction, but rather demonstrate that risk factors may act as surrogates of specific underlying disease mechanisms. It is thus necessary to perform a comprehensive analysis of complex polygenic diseases, such as myocardial infarction, including both, established cardiovascular risk factors and genomic data.", 
    "80": "Sympathetic nervous system activation plays an important role in the genesis of symptoms, functional impairment, progressive ventricular dysfunction, and mortality in patients with heart failure. Prospective, randomized clinical trials of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure have demonstrated mortality reductions in patients across the spectrum of clinical presentations and etiologies. Additionally, these trials have provided important information regarding the indications, dosing, and extent of therapeutic benefits of the different beta-blockers studied in patients with heart failure. The recognition that beta-blockers relieve symptoms, reduce hospitalizations, and prolong survival in patients with heart failure represents one of the most important therapeutic advances in the treatment of this complex disorder. Beta-blockers, along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists, now represent the standard of care for patients with heart failure.",

    "84": "Because of the limited spatial resolution, it is not possible with multislice CT angiography to determine the degree the coronary artery stenoses precisely. However, the high negative predictive value indicates that multislice CT may be a suitable tool to reliably rule out coronary artery disease.", 
    "85": "Idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia (VT) has been classified into three subgroups according to mechanism: verapamil-sensitive, adenosine-sensitive, and propranolol-sensitive types. VT can be categorized also into left fascicular VT and left outflow tract VT. Although the mechanism of fascicular VT is verapamil-sensitive reentry, the mechanism of left outflow tract VT is not homogeneous. Fascicular VT can be classified into three subtypes: (1) left posterior fascicular VT with a right bundle branch block (RBBB) and superior axis configuration (common form); (2) left anterior fascicular VT with RBBB and right-axis deviation configuration (uncommon form); and (3) upper septal fascicular VT with a narrow QRS and normal axis configuration (rare form). Posterior and anterior fascicular VT can be successfully ablated at the mid-septum guided by a diastolic Purkinje potential or at the VT exit site guided by a fused presystolic Purkinje potential. Upper septal fascicular VT also can be ablated at the site indicated by a diastolic Purkinje potential. The mechanism of left ventricular outflow tract VT is most likely adenosine-sensitive triggered activity. This VT can be classified into three subtypes according to the location where catheter ablation is successful, i.e., (1) endocardial origin; (2) coronary cusp origin; and (3) epicardial origin. The R-wave duration and R/S-wave amplitude in V1/V2 can be used to differentiate coronary cusp VT from other types of outflow tract VT. Recognition of the characteristics of the various forms of this group of arrhythmias should facilitate appropriate diagnosis and therapy.", 
    "86": "Information on the extent to which xenobiotics interact with P-glycoprotein (PGP) during transit through the intestine is crucial in determining the influence of PGP on oral drug absorption. We have recently described a novel use of isolated ileum from PGP-deficient mdr1a(-/-) mice to resolve PGP- and non-PGP-dependent drug efflux and provide a definitive measure of intrinsic drug permeability without recourse to inhibitors. The present study uses this approach to investigate the impact of PGP on intestinal permeability of paclitaxel and digoxin in different regions of the mouse intestine (jejunum, ileum, and proximal and distal colon). Absorption of paclitaxel and digoxin in tissues from wild-type mice was low and showed little regional variation. In contrast, absorption of both drugs was markedly higher in mdr1a(-/-) intestine, although the increase was highly region-dependent, with the ileum and distal colon showing the greatest effect and much smaller changes in the jejunum and proximal colon. These effects were accompanied by the abolition of paclitaxel and digoxin secretion in mdr1a(-/-) mice, suggesting that regional variations in intestinal permeability are masked by differential PGP expression, confirmed by immunoblotting studies. Propranolol permeability, which is not influenced by PGP, showed similar regional variation in both wild-type and mdr1a(-/-) tissues, suggesting that differences are at the level of transcellular permeability. These data suggest that the ileum and the distal colon are regions of relatively high transcellular permeability for xenobiotics that are compensated by enhanced expression of PGP.",

Forty-five percent of 702 patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia and 35% of 1394 patients without inducible tachycardia were discharged from hospital receiving beta-blockers. Patients treated with beta-blockers were younger and had higher ejection fractions, higher rates of recent angina, and more recent infarction. beta-Blockers were associated with decreased total mortality for the entire study population (5-year mortality 50% with beta-blockers versus 66% without beta-blockers; adjusted P=0.0001). The mortality benefit associated with beta-blockers was present in patients with and without inducible tachycardia, except those treated with implantable defibrillators.

    "90": "PDE3 cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases are important in cyclic AMP (cAMP) and possibly cyclic GMP-mediated signalling in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle myocytes. Drugs that inhibit these enzymes have inotropic and vasodilatory actions that have proven useful in the short-term treatment of contractile failure and pulmonary hypertension in dilated cardiomyopathy (both ischaemic and idiopathic). With long-term usage, however, these drugs appear to increase mortality in treated patients through an as yet undetermined mechanism that is in some way attributable to an increase in intracellular cAMP content in cardiac myocytes. Several recent clinical trials have raised the possibility that these drugs may be used to advantage in dilated cardiomyopathy when they are administered in combination with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, which act to lower intracellular cAMP content. In this review, the relevant basic and clinical data are examined and the possible justification for the combination of two therapies with seemingly opposite effects on intracellular cAMP content is considered.",

Treatment is necessary in approximately 2-10% of women with PMS and PMDD because of the degree of impairment and distress experienced. Treatment modalities are increasingly based on hypotheses concerning possible underlying biological mechanisms: mostly ovulation-related hormonal changes and serotonergic abnormalities. Two treatment modalities distinguish themselves as highly effective: suppression of ovulation and specific serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Suppression of ovulation is effective for a wide range of PMS, while SSRIs are effective for PMDD with some degree of efficacy for physical symptoms. The SSRIs are also efficacious when administered intermittently--only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.", 
    "92": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is increasing in prevalence worldwide, particularly in the elderly. Accordingly, this epidemic is likely to translate into a major increase in healthcare costs. Systolic heart failure is the most common cause of CHF presentations. Although the causes vary, the most common single aetiological factor is ischaemic heart disease, which accounts for approximately 50% of heart failure presentations. Research into CHF pharmacotherapy has been copious, with the focus principally centred on systolic heart failure. The evidence base for pharmacotherapy in CHF is amongst the largest currently in clinical medicine. There have been multiple trials establishing the mortality and morbidity benefits of pharmacotherapy. Amongst these, large scale trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and spironolactone have provided a sound basis for evidence-based treatment approaches to the CHF patient. Recently research interest has increased in biomedical engineering with studies being performed in biventricular pacing and mechanical hearts. Early data with biventricular pacing or cardiac resynchronisation therapy is encouraging. Diastolic heart failure alone accounts for at least 20 - 40% of CHF presentations and whilst it may occur in isolation, is most commonly seen in association with systolic heart failure. In this study, we present a broad overview of the current therapeutic modalities for the management of CHF, with particular emphasis on pharmacotherapy.",

Precautions must be taken, however, when using vasoconstrictors with certain patients, especially those with cardiovascular disease. Several drug interactions must also be considered before administration of a local anesthetic with a vasoconstrictor, and special care must be taken when injecting such preparations in patients on nonspecific beta-adrenergic blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors, cocaine, and certain general anesthetics. Lastly, in the patient with true sulfite allergy, local anesthetics without a vasoconstrictor should be used.", 
    "99": "Two experiments were conducted to ascertain the cardiovascular accompaniments of differential Pavlovian jaw movement (JM) conditioning. The first examined the blood pressure (BP) changes that accompany the tachycardiac conditioned responses (CRs) associated with JM conditioning. The BP response in all instances consisted of a depressor response that was greater to the reinforced CS+ than CS-, although the magnitude of the CR was quite small. The second experiment determined the effects of peripheral autonomic antagonists on the cardiac accelerations associated with JM conditioning. It was found that the peripheral vagal antagonist methyl scopolamine completely abolished responses to both CS+ and CS-, whereas atenolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist, augmented the response, compared to saline control injections. The JM responses were also affected by the autonomic blockades, with minimal responding occurring in the scopolamine group but slightly more JM CRs in the atenolol group, compared to saline control animals. These results suggest that the major cardiovascular response to an appetitive stimulus, which evokes JM conditioning, consists of cardiac accelerations with the BP depressor responses playing a minimal, if any, role. Moreover, these conditioned cardiac increases appear to be due solely to the release of vagal inhibition.", 
    "100": "The management of acute myocardial infarction has been revolutionized in the past decade. Advances in pharmacological and mechanical reperfusion therapy have improved the survival of patients who experience myocardial infarction. Although revascularisation techniques have been shown to reduce infarct size and in-hospital mortality, patients recovering from myocardial infarction are still at increased risk for reinfarction, congestive heart failure, and sudden death. Despite impressive technological advances, lifestyle modification and pharmacological interventions remain the key components of secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. Although the concept of secondary prevention of reinfarction and death has been investigated vigorously for several decades, preventive therapy has been seriously underused by physicians. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based overview of secondary prevention postmyocardial infarction clinical trials, in the hope of improving the utilization of effective therapies in patients with coronary heart disease.", 
    "101": "Within the framework of developing strategies to enhance the intestinal absorption of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates, the modulatory effect of a standardized apricot extract on P-gp-related efflux carriers was investigated in the Caco-2 system, Ussing chambers and the rat in situ perfusion model using talinolol as a model substrate. Using the Caco-2 system, polarity in transport of talinolol could be observed, the absorptive transport being much lower than the secretory transport (P(app-abs) = 1.08 +/- 0.29 x 10(-6) cm/s and P(app-secr) = 11.74 +/- 0.80 x 10(-6) cm/s). Inclusion of apricot extract (1%) in the apical medium resulted in a statistically significantly diminished polarity (P(app-abs) = 4.88 +/- 0.96 x 10(-6) cm/s and P(app-secr) = 9.39 +/- 0.58 x 10(-6) cm/s, p < 0.05). In addition, the inhibitory effect of apricot extract on P-gp related efflux mechanisms was shown to be concentration (0% approximately 0.1% < 0.3% < 1%) and pH dependent. Experiments performed with the Ussing chambers resulted in similar observations. In the rat in situ perfusion model, inclusion of apricot extract (1%) in the perfusion medium resulted in a threefold increase of the amount of talinolol appearing in the collected blood compared to the reference condition (23.6 +/- 5.53 pmol/cm. min and 7.13 +/- 1.08 pmol/cm. min, respectively; p < 0.05). Coadministration of this standardized apricot extract might be a safe and useful strategy to enhance the intestinal absorption of P-gp substrates. The nature and structure of the compound(s) responsible for this inhibiting effect on P-gp-related efflux carriers remain to be elucidated, as well as the exact mechanism by which apricot extract exerts its inhibitory function.",

We investigated the effects of systemic injections of 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg doses of propranolol on acquisition of delay eyeblink conditioning in 3-month-old Fischer 344 rats. We presented a 3-kHz, 90-dB tone as a conditioning stimulus and a 6 psi airpuff as our unconditioned stimulus to freely moving rats. We monitored eyelid activity using EMG signals. The treatment subjects were injected with either propranolol or saline 0.5 h prior to daily training sessions. Two groups of control subjects, one receiving injections of saline and one receiving injections of 5 mg/kg propranolol, received daily training sessions with unpaired and randomized presentation of the tone and airpuff. Each daily training session for the treatment groups consisted of 27 paired training trials and 3 conditioned stimulus-alone training trials. Rats injected with saline vehicle or with 1 mg/kg propranolol achieved a 60% or better learned response rate within two training sessions. Rats injected with 5 or 10 mg/kg propranolol never achieved a response rate significantly different from animals that received unpaired, random presentations of the tone and airpuff stimuli. These results agree with prior studies from our lab that have shown a dose-dependent effect of beta-noradrenergic receptor blockade on learning in rabbit eyeblink conditioning as well as in a runway, motor learning paradigm. We believe that the beta-noradrenergic system plays an important role in learning and memory in more than one cerebellar-dependent learning paradigm.",

The alpha-sympathetic system played a dominant role in the LF oscillations of BPV. A role of the vagus in the HF oscillations of BPV in the rat is questioned. The baroreflex depended mainly on changes in vagal activity.", 
    "124": "In multiple clinical trials, beta-blockers have been shown to significantly improve morbidity and mortality in adults with chronic congestive heart failure, but there is little reported experience with their use in children. Heart failure involves activation of the adrenergic nervous system and other neurohumoral systems in order to maintain cardiovascular homeostasis. These compensatory mechanisms have been shown to cause myocardial damage with chronic activation, which has been hypothesized to be a major contributing factor to the clinical deterioration of adults with heart failure. Studies have demonstrated inhibition of this neurohumoral response and concomitant clinical benefits with beta-blockers. Consequently, beta-blockers have evolved to become an important part of comprehensive medical therapy for congestive heart failure in adults. Pediatric heart failure represents an entirely different spectrum of disease, caused more commonly by congenital heart disease than cardiomyopathy. Surgical palliation and correction are important components of pediatric heart failure therapy, and residual, postsurgical cardiac lesions can lead to chronic heart failure. Although neurohumoral activation in children is similar to that in adults with heart failure, there are important differences from adults in physiology and developmental changes that are especially observed in infants. Current published clinical experience with beta-blocker use in children with heart failure is limited to case series with relatively small numbers of patients. Nevertheless, these series show consistent symptomatic improvement, and improvement in ventricular systolic function in patients with cardiomyopathies and congenital heart disease, similar to findings in adults. Adverse effects were common and many patients in these studies had adverse outcomes (death and/or need for transplantation). One study has noted differences in pharmacokinetics in children compared with adults. However, a multicenter, randomized controlled trial to evaluate carvedilol in pediatric heart failure from systolic ventricular dysfunction is currently ongoing and should help to clarify the efficacy and tolerability of carvedilol in children.", 
    "125": "Much of the conventional wisdom about the prevalance, causes, diagnosis, symptoms, effects, and treament of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is changing. MVP has a benign course and excellent prognosis for most patients, with only a small minority developing serious complications.", 
    "126": "1. In inflammatory kidney diseases procoagulatory activity (PCA) becomes evident. Glomerular fibrin deposits and capillary microthrombi are histopathological hallmarks in most forms of glomerulonephritis. 2. Therefore in this study the expression of tissue factor (TF) as the main inducer of thrombogenesis was examined in cultured human mesangial cells (MC) in response to proinflammatory stimuli such as interleukin-1 (IL-1 beta), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Also main signalling pathways were investigated. 3. IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and LPS induced TF in MC in a time and dose dependent manner on mRNA and protein levels. Highest activity was found after 12 h of stimulation. Induction of TF was completely blockable by BAPTA-AM, a chelator of intracellular [Ca(2+)](i) as well as calphostin, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. Activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway had no influence on basal TF expression, but down-regulated cytokine-induced TF. The PKA blocker, KT5720, increased TF formation significantly. Since TF exerts its activity primarily on the surface of cells and after release of encrypted receptors we further tested TF activity in MC supernatants. IL-1 beta did not significantly increase TF activity in supernatants of intact cells. However, when MC were rendered apoptotic by oxidative metabolites, IL-1 beta treated MC released highly stimulated TF activity into the supernatants, suggesting that a paracrine activation of the coagulatory cascade can take place under such conditions. 4. Inflammatory mediators up-regulate TF expression in MC by a PKC dependent pathway whereas PKA can serve as a negative feed-back link. Apoptosis of inflammatory MC may trigger to spread PCA.", 
    "127": "A study was carried out in human volunteers to investigate whether ileal brake activators could alter the bioavailability of atenolol from the small intestine by slowing intestinal transit and thereby increasing the time available for absorption. Oleic acid and a monoglyceride were formulated into modified release capsules that were targeted to the small intestine. Atenolol was either dosed separately or incorporated into one of the capsules. Radiolabelled non-disintegrating tablets were dosed at the same time in order to determine the small intestinal transit time (SITT). Plasma concentrations of atenolol were determined by HPLC. The results showed that in some volunteers an increase in SITT did lead to an increase in the quantity of drug absorbed. However, drug absorption was related not only to the total time spent by the drug in the small intestine but other factors such as the proportion of such time spent at the ileocaecal junction. The study highlights the complexities of exploiting natural gastrointestinal processes to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs.",

Development of symptomatic bradycardia on systemic or ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blockers alone likely indicates underlying cardiac conduction disturbances.

These forces include extended life expectancy, decreased disability, and accelerated improvement in the effectiveness of medical technology. All of these forces will lead to a predictable increase in health care costs. Cardiologists must also be cognizant of the rise in health care consumerism; patients are assuming a larger role in decisions about their medical care and treatment. All of these factors are driving the climate of evidence-based medicine, particularly in the cardiovascular field. Payers and the government are beginning to require the clinical community to define quality. In turn, these third parties are beginning to measure quality as defined by the profession and to hold providers accountable for the quality of what they do. Although the frontier of genetic prediction in therapeutics will serve as an intellectual focus for bringing these issues closer to the forefront in cardiovascular medicine, the fundamental provision of value in health care (high quality at reasonable cost) cannot wait on genomics. Because the amount of evidence in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) exceeds other areas of medicine, therapies for ACS will undergo increasingly intense scrutiny.",

    "136": "Previous studies have shown that ischemia and reperfusion are potent stimuli for eliciting cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and that polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are involved in the development of myocardial injury induced by ischemia and reperfusion. The present study examined whether PMN could directly induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis and, if so, it possible signal transduction pathways. In addition, we also investigated the effects of carvedilol, a potent antioxidant, on PMN-induced apoptosis. Cultured primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to PAF-activated PMNs at concentrations of 10(5), 3 x 10(5) and 10(6) cells/well for 48 h. Multiple detecting techniques, including electron microscopy, DNA gel electrophoresis. TUNEL assay and flow cytometry were used to identify myocyte apoptosis. All of these techniques demonstrated that activated PMNs directly induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner, while unactivated PMNs showed no such effect. Activated PMN-induced apoptosis was partially inhibited by SB203580, a specific inhibitor of the p38-MAPK signaling system. Carvedilol (at a dose range of 1-10 mumol/l) significantly prevented activated PMN-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. These results suggest that PMNs, when activated, directly induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis and that the p38-MAPK signaling pathway might be involved in this process. Carvedilol may prevent PMN-induced apoptosis possibly because of its antioxidant properties.", 
    "137": "We previously reported that alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(2)-AR) stimulation in Purkinje fibers in vitro prolongs action potential duration and suppresses beta-adrenergic-induced delayed afterdepolarizations and sustained triggered activities. We examined the effects of alpha(2)-AR stimulation on reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias [ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF)] in vivo. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, surface electrocardiogram, and renal sympathetic nerve activities were recorded simultaneously in Sprague-Dawley rats. The incidence of VT/VF was 87.5% for controls, 50% for the beta-blocker group, 72% for the alpha(1)-blocker group, and 12.5% for the alpha(1) + beta-blockers group (unopposed alpha(2)-adrenergic activation). Direct alpha(2)-AR stimulation with UK-14304 also prevented VT/VF. These effects were reversed by the alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine. Increases in renal sympathetic nerve activity were associated with left anterior descending coronary artery ligation and reperfusion (33 +/- 1.5 and 62 +/- 1.7% over baseline, respectively) in controls. Similar patterns were observed among all experimental groups irrespective of the incidence of VT/VF on reperfusion. We conclude that alpha(2)-AR stimulation has a potent antiarrhythmic effect on ischemia-reperfusion-induced VT/VF in vivo and that this effect is not centrally mediated.", 
    "138": "Measurement of left ventricular (LV) function is often overlooked in murine studies, which have been used to analyze the effects of genetic manipulation on cardiac phenotype. The goal of this study was to address the effects of changes in LV contractility on indexes of contractility in mice. LV function was assessed in vivo in closed-chest mice by echocardiography and by LV catheterization using a conductance pressure-volume (P-V) catheter with three different interventions that alter contractility by 1) atrial pacing to increase inotropy by augmentation of the force-frequency relation (modest increment of inotropy), 2) dobutamine to maximize inotropy, and 3) esmolol infusion to decrease contractility. Load-independent parameters derived from P-V relations, such as slope of end-systolic P-V relations (ESPVR) and slope of the first maximal pressure derivative over time (dP/dt(max))-end-diastolic volume relation (dP/dt-EDV), and standard echocardiographic parameters were measured. The dP/dt-EDV changed the most among parameters after atrial pacing and dobutamine infusion (percent change, 162.8 +/- 95.9% and 271.0 +/- 44.0%, respectively). ESPVR was the most affected by a decrease in LV contractility during esmolol infusion (percent change, -49.8 +/- 8.3%). However, fractional shortening failed to detect changes in contractility during atrial pacing and esmolol infusion and its percent change was <20%. This study demonstrated that contractile parameters derived from P-V relations change the most during a change in LV contractility and should therefore best detect a small change in contractility in mice. Heart rate has a modest but significant effect on P-V relationship-derived indexes and must be considered in the evaluation of murine cardiac physiology.",

Patients older than age 75 years were less likely than those age <65 years to fill a prescription (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.93). Gender, race, and being an ideal candidate did not affect beta-blocker use. Among patients who were discharged on beta-blockers, 85% of survivors had filled a prescription by 30 days postdischarge, and 63% and 61% were current users at 180 and 365 days, respectively.

Temporal and spatial changes in repolarization are among the most studied mechanisms for inducing fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Beta blockers effectively reduce the risk of sudden death in CHF. Our aim in this study was to investigate changes induced by metoprolol and carvedilol on the QT variability index (QTVI), a new measure reflecting the temporal heterogeneity of cardiac repolarization. A total of 82 subjects, who were in New York Heart Association functional class II or III, underwent short-term spectral analysis of RR and QT variability before and after a 1-year course of high-dose metoprolol (40 subjects) or carvedilol (42 subjects) at baseline (rest) and after sympathetic stress (head-up tilt). At rest, both drug-treated groups had lower QTVI (p <0.001) than after placebo, but during tilt patients treated with carvedilol had a lower QTVI than those treated with metoprolol (p <0.05). Although both beta-blocker treatments helped to normalize the QTVI measured in normal subjects at rest, they each differentially altered the index after tilt. Carvedilol seemed to improve the QTVI more than metoprolol.",

The effects of antihypertensive therapy on QT dispersion, which reflects cardiac repolarization heterogeneity, in relation to changes in LV mass has not been well studied. Repeat echocardiography and QT measurements (standard 12-lead electrocardiograms) were performed in hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy, who were randomized double-blind to receive the angiotensin II type 1-receptor blocker irbesartan (n = 44) or the beta(1)-receptor blocker atenolol (n = 48) for 48 weeks, and in 37 matched hypertensive control subjects without LV hypertrophy. LV mass index was related to QT dispersion (r = 0.34, p <0.001). The reduction in LV mass was greater using irbesartan than using atenolol (-27 +/- 28 vs -15 +/- 21 g/m(2) at 48 weeks, p = 0.021), with similar reductions in blood pressure. Irbesartan decreased QT dispersion (from 56 +/- 24 ms to 45 +/- 20 ms at 48 weeks; p <0.001) and QTc dispersion (from 57 +/- 24 to 44 +/- 19 ms at 48 weeks; p <0.001). In contrast, atenolol had minor effects. The decreases in QT and QTc dispersions were greater using irbesartan than using atenolol (p = 0.001 and p = 0.011, respectively); the same results were found when changes in LV mass, blood pressure, and heart rate were also included in multivariate analyses. Thus, heterogeneity of ventricular repolarization is related to the degree of LV hypertrophy. Irbesartan, but not atenolol, reduces QT and QTc dispersions independent of changes in LV mass, blood pressure, or heart rate, and thus seems to induce structural and electrical remodeling in a direction that could decrease the risk of fatal events in hypertensive patients."
