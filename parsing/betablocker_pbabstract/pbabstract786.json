The first RR zone activated at a weak depolarization of the membrane (no higher than 30 mV) seems to be concerned with the functioning of the fast Na system. It was not blocked with inderal (2 divided by 5 mg/l), anor with Mn2+ ions (3mM). The second RR zone appearing at a stronger membrane depolarization (higher than 30 mv) is essentially dependent on the activity of the slow Na-Ca-system. It is activated with adrenaline (0.2 mg/l), ions of Sr2+ (5mM), Ba2+ (0.1 mM), Ca2+ (5 divided by 10 mM); blocked with Mn2+ (3 mM), Co2+ (5mM) ions, verapamile (2 divided by 4 mg/l), inderal (2 divided by 4 mg/l). The second RR zone was essentially affected with potassium ions: the 3-fold increase of Ko+ suppressed the RR of the second zone, a 3-fold decrease of Ko+ strengthened them.",

Survivorship was considered optimal by performance of a mastectomy without the six to eight weeks' delay required to achieve euthyroidism by antithyroid drugs or radioiodine. The hyperthyroidism was controlled with propranolol, permitting an uneventful radical mastectomy.", 
    "2": "It has been found that kinins increase psychostimulatory effects of Nialamide and L-DOPA as well as psychoinhibitory effects of propranolol without any changes in phentolamine action. Phentolamine and propranolol decrease stimulatory effects of Nialamide and L-DOPA only when they are given jointly with bradykinin.", 
    "3": "Contractions of the dorsal sac of the rumen and abomasum were recorded in the sheep with chronic fistulae. It was found that during reflex inhibition of rumen contractions, induced with stimulation of chemoreceptors in the abomasum, an increased sympathicotonia plays an essential role and the beta-adrenergic receptors mediate the reflex.", 
    "4": "The influence of asphyxia on electrocorticogram (E. Co. G.) and electrocardiogram (E. C. G.) has been studied in curarized rats. The delay between the heightening of the ST component of E. C. G. and the disappearance of E. Co. G. pattern was measured. It provided more useful information on cerebral survival during asphyxia than the only study of E. Co. G. did. This delay was increased (cerebral antihypoxic effect) after intravenous treatment with pyritinol (50 mg/kg), vincamine (5 mg/kg) or propranolol (1 mg/kg), but it was not influenced by pentobarbital (60 mg/kg).", 
    "5": "The urinary excretion of free noradrenaline (NA), adrenaline (A), dopamine (DA), the DA/NA ratio in the urine, plasma renin activity (PRA) and their mutual relationship were investigated in 71 patients suffering from different types of arterial hypertension. In spite of the fact that the mean values of excreted catecholamines, with the exception of pheochromocytoma, lie within the range of values found in healthy controls, certain differences were found in spectrum of excreted catecholamines. In patients with labile, malignant and renovascular hypertension and in pheochromcytoma the higher mean excretion of NA and the low DA/NA ratio was accompanied by the higher PRA in comparison with fixed benign essential hypertension. On the other hand, in hypertension with low PRA (essential hypertension with suppressed renin and Conn's syndrome) a low excretion of NA and high DA/NA ratio was found. There was a significant, if not even very close negative correlation between the PRA and DA/NA ratios both in recumbent and upright position. The rise of PRA on standing up was followed by an increased excretion of NA while the excretion of DA did not change or decreased. Hence the DA/NA ratio when standing up showed a decreasing tendency as compared with values when lying down. Application of the beta-blocker Inderal decreased the PRA and the blood pressure not only in juvenile hypertensive patients with hyperkinetic circulation but also in the early phases of renovascular hypertension. It thus appears that endogenous catecholamines, first of all the ratio between the renin-inhibiting DA and the renin-stimulating NA, participate as one of several factors in the regulation of secretion and of the plasma levels of renin not only in juvenile hypertensive patients with hyperkinetic circulation but also in other types of hypertension.", 
    "6": "1. Choline was released into the fluid bathing the serosal surface of segments of guinea-pig small intestine. The mean rate of release (nmol choline per cm of intestine per h) in the first hour was 10-2 and in the second hour 8-0. 2. Propranolol 1 mM in the mucosal fluid caused a significant (P less than 0-01) increase in the rate at which choline was released into the serosal fluid. The mean rates were 15-4 and 19-2 for the first and second hour, respectively. 3. It is suggested that the effect of propranolol observed in the present study is likely to be due to a non-specific direct action on biological membranes.", 
    "7": "1. Plasma levels of propranolol were measured fluorometrically in patients with angina pectoris and in patients admitted to the Coronary Care Unit with acute myocardial infarction. 2. In thirty patients with stable angina pectoris, plasma propranolol levels varied almost linearly with doses between 10 and 120 mg during 6-hourly chronic oral administration. Plasma levels greater than 100 ng/ml produced 70-80% reduction in the tachycardia induced by strenous exercise on a treadmill. 3. In nineteen patients with acute myocardial infarction given oral propranolol, 20 mg 6-hourly, peak as well as trough plasma levels of the drug increased progressively but remained below 100 ng/ml in all except two patients during the first 24 h after their admission to the Coronary Care Unit. 4. The data suggest that the use of low and fixed doses of propranolol may not produce adequate plasma levels or significant beta-adrenoceptor blockade in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction in man.", 
    "8": "The myocardial pathology of 14 pigs exposed to HSGz stress of 9 and 15, or 3, 7, and 9 Gz was studied; six control pigs were used as comparisons. Four pigs received propranolol prior to centrifugation and four pigs received atropine. Hearts were studied by light and electron microscopy. Myocardium from stressed pigs showed myofibrillar degeneration, pooling of mitochondria, and cell death. Lesions occurred in random cells of the subendocardium and papillary muscles. Purkinje fibers were also involved. Pretreatment with atropine increased the number of dead cells found and propranolol increased the number of cells showing myofibrillar degeneration. It is postulated that this is a pluricausal cardiomyopathy similar to several experimental conditions. Significance to aerospace medicine is briefly discussed.", 
    "9": "Adult miniature swine were exposed to various levels and durations of +Gz. After exposure, all swine were euthanized and necropsied. Gross, histologic, and electronmicroscopic observations were made on the heart tissue. Subendocaridal hemorrhage (SEH) was commonly found in the left ventricle, rarely in the right ventricle, and its severity was directly related to : a) level and duration of G exposure, b) heart rate, and c) catecholamine activity. SEH was made more severe with i.v. atropine 4 mg, and prevented with i.v. propranolol 20 mg. Heart hemorrhage was usually limited to the immediate subendocardial region and frequently surrounded Purkinje's fibers. In severe cases, however, hemorrhages penetrated several millimeters into the heart muscle and sometimes penetrated Purkinje's fibers. Restraint of unanesthetized swine in the centrifuge couch, low G-levels, and/or i.v. injections of atropine or epinephrine produced minimal SEH lesions.", 
    "10": "The effect of 2 types of adrenergic blockade on the capacity of the coronaries for hypoxic dilatation was studied in open chest dogs under chloralose anesthesia. Reactive hyperemia following the temporary occlusion of the left coronary artery and the vasodilatation elicited by general arterial hypoxia served to determine the range of coronary adaptation. beta-adrenergic blockade induced by propranolol (0.3 mg/Kg i.v. or 0.05 mg/Kg intracoronarially) failed to reduce the range of hypoxic dilatation. On the other hand, the alpha-blocking agent phentolamine (0.45 mg/Kg i.v. or 0.15 mg/Kg i.c.), in association with a decrease of the vascular tone, significantly limited the coronary adaptation to hypoxia.", 
    "11": "A woman who developed thyrotoxicosis during pregnancy had a high level of HTSI at the time of delivery. The baby had high levels of HTSI initially but, unlike the mother, the levels fell, giving a half-life of HTSI of 10 days.", 
    "12": "Vasoconstriction due to parallel i.a. injections of NA were studied in subcutaneous adipose tissue and gracilis muscle preparations in dogs. The vasoconstrictor response to NA was significantly lower in adipose tissue than in muscle. Only in muscle did acidosis inhibit NA-induced vasoconstriction. The beta-receptor antagonist propranolol increased the vasoconstrictor response in adipose tissue to the level of skeletal muscle. The lack of significant inhibition of NA-induced vasoconstriction in adipose tissue may be due to the simultaneous inhibition of two opposing mechanisms-alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction and beta-adrenergic vasodilatation. After propranolol acidosis inhibited NA-induced vasoconstriction equally in adipose tissue and muscle. The difference between adipose tissue and muscle may thus be due to a greater importance of a beta-adrenergic vasodilator mechanism in the former tissue. The metabolic response to isoprenaline was inhibited by acidosis, while the direct vasodilatation was unaffected. It is suggested that the beta-adrenergic vasodilator mechanism that is inhibited by acidosis is related to the metabolism of the tissue.", 
    "13": "The autonomic nerve control of the swimbladder of the goldsinny wrasse has been studied by experiments with isolated strips from the muscularis mucosae, drug effects on gas secretion in vivo, fluorescent histochemistry and quantitative analysis of catecholamine content. Vagotomy, atropine and mecamylamine significantly inhibited induced gas secretion, suggesting a cholinergic vagal secretory innervation of the gas gland. The anterior part of the mucosa (secretory part) is contracted by acetylcholine and alpha-adrenoceptor agonists. These responses are competitively antagonized by atropine and phentolamine or yohimbine respectively. The posterior (resorbent) part of the mucosa is contracted by acetylcholine, but beta-adrenoceptor agonists relax the acetylcholine-precontracted preparations. These responses are competitively blocked by atropine and propranolol respectively. The pA2-values from all experiments with antagonists are well comparable with values obtained for the same drugs in other teleost or mammalian tissues. Tyramine, 5-hydroxytryptamine or phenylephrine had mixed effects on the posterior part. This effect is at least in part due to release of nervously stored catecholamines. Fluorescent histochemistry revealed a strong innervation by both smooth and varicose adrenergic fibres in all parts of the swimbladder, noradrenaline being the dominant catecholamine. Yellow fluorescent cells, which may contain 5-hydroxytryptamine, were also seen in the swimbladder mucosa. No conclusive evidence for a cholinergic innervation of the muscularis mucosae was obtained.", 
    "14": "The rate of progression of nephropathy was studied in 6 young male diabetics with intermittent proteinuria (Albustix) and in 10 young male diabetics with constant proteinuria by measuring glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and urinary albumin excretion by exact techniques. Albumin excretion was elevated in both the recumbent and the erect position in patients with intermittent proteinuria. GFR and RPF were at the same level as in diabetics without proteinuria, and no deterioration in renal function was noted during a mean control period of 32 months. In the patients with constant proteinuria the fall rate during a mean period of 33.6 months for GFR and RPF was 0.91 ml/min/month +/- 0.68 (S.D.) and 4.38 ml/min/month +/- 3.23 (S.D.) respectively. Initial fall rate in GFR correlated well with long-term fall rate, both of which were studied in 7 patients. In the same patients there was a positive correlation between the fall rate in GFR and diastolic blood pressure as well as albumin clearance. In 8 patients with constant proteinuria and mean blood pressure of 159/101 mmHg, antihypertensive treatment was started with propranolol alone or combined with hydralazine and furosemide. During a treatment period of 47 days blood pressure was reduced to 143/93 mmHg, and in the same period urinary albumin excretion was reduced significantly from a mean value of 3547 mug/min to 2414 mug/min (P less than 0.01). Further control studies will clarify whether end-stage of renal insufficiency will be postponed by antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "15": "1. Activation of the sympathetic input to the urinary bladder by electrical stimulation of afferent fibres in the pelvic nerve evoked three responses: (1) an initial transient rise in intravesical pressure, (2) an inhibition of neurally evoked bladder contractions and (3) an inhibition of transmission in vesical parasympathetic ganglia. Similar responses were elicited by stimulation of the hypogastric nerve. 2. The reflex responses were observed in acute spinal preparations (T10-T12) and in cats with intact spinal cords, but were abolished by bilateral transection of the hypogastric nerves. 3. The inhibition of bladder contractions was antagonized by the administration of propranolol (200-400 mug, I.A.), a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. The inhibition of ganglionic transmission was antagonized by dihydroergotamine (30-75 mug, I.A.), an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent. The initial rise in intravesical pressure was not antagonized by either agent. 4. Electrical stimulation of other afferents (carotid sinus nerve and sciatic nerve) did not consistently elicit responses in the urinary bladder. However, stimulation of these afferents as well as pelvic nerve afferents evoked reflex firing in nerve filaments on the surface of the urinary bladder. The firing was abolished by transection of the ipsilateral hypogastric nerve. 5. It is concluded that stimulation of vesical afferents activates a spinal sympathetic reflex which results in closing of the internal urethral sphincter and a depression of bladder activity. The latter occurs by a direct depression of detrusor smooth muscle as well as a block of the neural input to the bladder. This vesico-sympathetic reflex represents a negative feed-back mechanism which may have an important role in the maintenance of urinary continence.", 
    "16": "1. Twenty-three hypertensive patients were treated by sotalol, a pure beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent. The drug produced a significant decrease of blood pressure in nineteen patients. 2. On average, cardiac index decreased but not significantly; heart rate decreased and stroke index increased significantly. Total peripheral resistance varied in both directions. 3. Sotalol determined a fall in plasma renin concentration (only significant in the high-renin group), a fall in plasma angiotensin II concentration and in urinary excretion rate of aldosterone accompanied by a rise in plasma potassium concentration. 4. The fall of blood pressure was not correlated with the decreases of renin and angiotensin II concentrations or excretion rate of aldosterone. However, in the placebo period plasma angiotensin II concentration was significantly correlated with total peripheral resistance; during sotalol treatment the variations of these two parameters seemed also to be correlated. 5. There was a poor correlation between decreases of cardiac output and of blood pressure; it was impossible to foresee the magnitude of the lowering of the blood pressure from the initial cardiac index. 6. The association of a diuretic with sotalol enhanced the hypotensive effect of the beta-receptor blocking drug, without significant increase of plasma renin and angiotensin II concentrations.", 
    "17": "Eleven consecutive patients with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias were treated by an aggressive protocol and followed up prospectively. Arrhythmias, symptoms, and cardiac lesions were defined. Antiarrhythmic drugs were given on schedule, with blood levels determining dose; success or failure was defined by elimination or recurrence of symptomatic arrhythmias. When drug therapy failed, left ventricular aneurysmectomy was done when appropriate. Recurrent ventricular tachycardia was most frequently responsible for symptoms; coronary artery disease was the most frequent underlying disease. Symptomatic arrhythmias were eliminated in 8 of 11 patients (5 with drugs and 3 with aneurysmectomies), with a 16.5-month symptom-free average follow-up. An average of 2.9 therapeutic trials per patient was needed to control symptomatic arrhythmias. The average time from entry into the study until the start of ultimately effective therapy was 18 days. Therapy that eliminated symptoms did not eliminate all premature ventricular contractions, and occasionally even brief asymptomatic episodes of ventricular tachycardia persisted. Recurrent symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias can be controlled in many patients by rigorous application of current therapies.", 
    "18": "A patient with Bartter's syndrome in whom the disease was recognized at 52 years of age is described. Studies of his renal function suggest that the basic pathophysiologic defect was an abnormality in proximal tubular sodium reabsorption which led to extracellular fluid volume depletion and consequent stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. After comparing the physiologic studies in this patient with those in other reported cases, we postulate that Bartter's syndrome may represent the end result of different pathophysiologic processes which share in common juxtaglomerular hyperplasia, increased renin release and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Therapy with B-adrenergic blocking agents produced adverse effects, but the patient responded well to more conventional measures.", 
    "19": "In order to evaluate the duration of the biologic effects of propranolol after the drug was discontinued, we evaluated a variety of noninvasively determined hemodynamic parameters. Significant depression was found in the heart rate (18 per cent), cardiac output (13 per cent) (determined echocardiographically), and the triple product of blood pressure, heart rate, and systolic ejection time (16 per per cent) during administration or propranolol (200 mg. per day) to 9 normal volunteers. Significant depression of these parameters was present 12 hours after discontinuing the drug. By 12 hours, serum propranolol levels had returned 90 per cent toward their base line; however, at the same time, the heart rate and cardiac output had returned only 19.4 and 14.3 per cent toward their base-line values, and the triple product had returned 41 per cent toward its baseline. By 36 hours no biologic effect was seen. Thus if propranolol were discontinued 2 days prior to cardiac surgery, no significant biologic effect would remain to complicate the patient's postoperative course.", 
    "20": "This study compares the inotropic action of morphine sulfate and ketamine hydrochloride on isolated canine right ventricular trabeculae. The heart was removed from 19 mongrel puppies weighing 5 to 9 kilograms and placed in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. The bathing solution contained 1.3 mM. of Ca2+ and was bubbled with a gas mixture of 95 per cent oxygen and 5 per cent carbon dioxide. At Lmax (i.e., the peak of isometric force-length curve) morphine even in large concentrations (up to 1 mg. per milliter) produced no significant direct inotropic effect. At the lower concentrations tested there was a minor but not significant increase in contractile performance, whereas at the highest concentration used there was a minor but not significant depression in contractility. In these same muscles lower concentrations of ketamine had a significant positive inotropic action, but a concentration of 200 mug per milliliter, which is approximately equimolecular to 1 mg. per milliliter of morphine sulfate, caused a profound depression in contractile performance. In the presence of a beta-blocking agent and in reserpine-pretreated muscles, low concentrations of ketamine, which had only a positive inotropic action in the normal muscles, now caused depression of contractile performance. The positive inotropic action of ketamine is thus indirect and mediated via adrenergic influences. At each concentration studied the direct inotropic action of ketamine was exclusively negative. Because of this bimodal inotropic action seen when adrenergic mechanisms are intact, we conclude that caution must be exercised when ketamine is given to patients previously treated or still under the influence of drugs having adrenolytic properties. Caution is also necessary when ketamine is used in patients having diminished cardiac adrenergic reserves as in congestive heart failure.", 
    "21": "The effect of propranolol (Inderal) on the intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma has been measured. Twenty-two patients completed the clinical trial. Propranolol in doses of 160 mg/d effectively lowered IOP in eyes with various types of open angle glaucoma. The test periods lasted from 4 to 6 days. The ocular hypotensive effect of propranolol was also registered in patients efficiently treated with pilocarpine and acetazolamide (Diamox), and in glaucomas not satisfactorily controlled by this therapy. High positive correlations between mean pretreatment pressure (P1), and pressure fall (delta P) were found (P less than 0.001), and the pressure decrease induced by propranolol treatment tended to be proportional to the pressure gradient between the anterior chamber and the episcleral veins. This pressure gradient was reduced by an average of about 50% following propranolol treatment. There was no change in scleral rigidity after propranolol.", 
    "22": "A possible interaction between d-1 propranolol and hyperparathyroid plasma ultrafiltrate on guinea pig auricles has been studied in \"in vitro\" experiments. Plasma ultrafiltrates have been samples in two patients on chronci haemodialysis before (pre-PTx) and after (post-PTx) parathyroidectomy. A significant inhibition of propranolol depressant activity on cardiac contractile strength has been observed in the presence of pre-PTx plasma ultrafiltrates. On the contrary, no such inhibition was noted in the presence of post-PTx plasma ultrafiltrates.", 
    "23": "1. The role of adenosine 3':5'-phosphate (cyclic AMP) and guanosine 3':5'-phosphate (cyclic GMP) as second messengers for the enzyme secretory response evoked by the autonomic neurotransmitters, noradrenaline and acetylcholine, is examined in this in vitro study on the guinea-pig submandibular gland. 2. Noradrenaline increased enzyme (kallikrein) secretion. The initial stimulation of enzyme release appeared to be dose-dependent. The time course of cumulative kallikrein secretion revealed a complex pattern. Isoprenaline and phenylephrine were almost as potent as noradrenaline in releasing kallikrein. Both propranolol and phentolamine were required to fully inhibit the noradrenaline-stimulated enzyme secretion. 3. The cumulative secretion of kallikrein evoked by acetylcholine was dose-dependent. The onset of secretion showed a significantly greater time-lag than that observed with noradrenaline. Atropine effectively blocked the release of kallikrein by acetylcholine. 4. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP stimulated enzyme secretion. Dibutyryl cyclic GMP caused an initial increase which was not maintained. 5. The cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitors, theophylline and papaverine, increased basal kallikrein secretion. The action of the cyclic phosphodiesterase inhibitors on the secretory response to noradrenaline, acetylcholine, dibutyryl cyclic AMP and dibutyryl cyclic GMP was complex. In general, the increase in enzyme release produced by the secretagogues was additively enhanced by both inhibitors. 6. Omission of calcium inhibited both acetylcholine and dibutyryl cyclic GMP stimulated kallikrein release, but to a lesser degree than that of noradrenaline and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. High concentrations of extracellular calcium (10 mM) appeared to enhance the action of acetylcholine. 7. Noradrenaline produced a rise in the intracellular level of cyclic AMP. The increase preceded the stimulated secretion of kallikrein. Of the various adrenergic agonists, noradrenaline and isoprenaline were the most potent, whereas phenylephrine was significantly less effective in raising basal cyclic AMP values. Acetylcholine was without effect, even in the presence of a cyclic phosphodiesterase inhibitor. 8. Acetylcholine and noradrenaline raised intracellular levels of cyclic GMP only when the tissue incubations were performed in the presence of a cyclic phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The increase in cyclic GMP produced by acetylcholine preceded enzyme secretion. 9. Morphological data substantiated the finding that the in vitro release of kallikrein evoked by the secretagogues was associated with the depletion of secretory granules and vacuolations in acinar cells of the gland slices. 10. The molecular mechanisms which control enzyme secretion in the exocrine submandibular gland are discussed. Models are presented for the role of transmitter-specific cyclic nucleotides and calcium in stimulus-secretion coupling.", 
    "24": "The cyclic nucleotide analog, 8-(benzylthio)-N6-n-butyladenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphate (SQ 80122) increases contractile force of excised cat right ventricular papillary muscle and stimulates myocardial contractility in the anesthetized dog. The inotropic action of this compound is independent of catecholamines and stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart.", 
    "25": "Catecholamines cause an elevation of both cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP levels in the rat C-6 glioma cell line. The response is mediated by a beta-receptor, with a Ka for stimulation of cyclic GMP of 2.6 X 10(-7)M. Maximum levels of cyclic GMP are reached by 5 min. whereas cyclic AMP levels are maximal by 10 min. Removal of calcium decreases the cyclic GMP elevation by 60%. Refractoriness to a second treatment with catecholamine develops for both responses. Catecholamine sensitivity of the cyclic GMP-generating system appears in the cells only as they start to contact and enter the stationary growth phase. In contrast to the effects of catecholamines, cholinergic agonists have no effect on either cyclic GMP or cyclic AMP levels.", 
    "26": "Human astrocytoma cells (1321N1) exhibit adenylate cyclase activities coupled to independent receptors for catecholamines and prostaglandins of the E-series. Exposure of the cells to either norepinephrine or prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) results in an initial rapid accumulation of cyclic AMP but also results in a progressive loss of responsiveness of the cells to agonists. Initially, the desensitization is in large part agonist-specific. However, with continued exposure to high concentrations of norepinephrine, partial loss of responsiveness to PGE1 occurs, and vice versa. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon does not appear to involve inactivation of the effectors, formation of an inhibitory substance in the culture medium or an increase in the rate of excretion of cyclic AMP from the cell. Blockade of protein synthesis (85%) by 5 mug/ml cycloheximide did not change the rate or extent of desensitization. When desensitized cells were incubated in the presence of the effectors, responsiveness was essentially completely recovered with a t1/2 of 5-7 hr. Cycloheximide recovery reduced. Norepinephrine-induced desensitization to either norepinephrine or PGE1 was blocked by sotalol, a beta receptor blocking agent. Incubation of the cells with dibutyryl cyclic AMP caused desensitization to both norepinephrine and PGE). The results suggest that catecholamine-induced desensitization occurs as a result of interaction of the agonist with the same receptor that is linked to activation of adenylate cyclase. Cyclic AMP appears to mediate at least the non-specific aspect of agonist-induced desensitization.", 
    "27": "With the use of microelectrodes, membrane potential (MP) was measured in mouse thyroid glands in vitro. A basal resting MP of about -39 mV was confirmed. The initial effect of feeding a low-iodine diet (6-12 days) was hyperpolarization, up to -47 m V; chronic low-iodine diet led to depolarization. Low concentrations of thyrotropin (less than 3 mU/ml superfusate) caused hyperpolarization and high ones (greater than 10 mU/ml) led to depolarization. Cyclic AMP (10(-3) M), dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1.2 X 10(-4) M or 1.2 X 10(-3) M) and theophylline (10(-2) or 10(-3) M) caused similar hyperpolarization: D- and DL-propranolol (5 X 10(-5) -5 X 10(-4) M) produced depolarization and inhibited hyperpolarization by thyrotropin. Conclusions are that hyperpolarization is a consequence of short-term increased secretion of thyrotropin in vivo or of low (near physiological) concentrations in vitro; these effects are probably mediated by cyclic AMP. The relationship to and mechanism of depolarization resulting from chronic enhanced endogenous secretion or high in vitro concentrations of thyrotropin are unknown.", 
    "28": "Early rosette formation by T lymphocytes appears to be modulated by cyclic nucleotides. Dibutyryl cyclic 3',5' adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) 10(-2) M inhibited E rosette formation up to 83%, while 10(-6) M 8-bromo-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) increased rosette formation maximally to 67.4% with less pronounced effect at increased concentrations. T lymphocyte receptors for beta adrenergic, alpha adrenergic, and muscarinic cholinergic agonists appear to influence rosette formation. Isoproternol 10(-2) M induced 67.3% inhibition, while phenylephrine 10(-5) M and carbamylcholine 10(-4) M were associated with enhanced rosette formation of 67.2% and 57.8%, respectively. Selective blockade with propranolol, phentolamine, and atropine indicated the presence of separate receptor sites. The lack of effect of histamine at concentrations of 10(-3) M and above suggests the absence of specific recepotrs on peripheral human T lymphocytes.", 
    "29": "Insulin-induced hypoglycemia caused an increase in plasma aldosterone as well as in renin activity and cortisol. After the suppression of the renin-angiotensin system by the prior administration of propranolol, insulin-induced hypoglycemia still caused a significant increase in plasma aldosterone similar to the increase in plasma cortisol, though plasma renin activity was suppressed. Conversely, after the suppression of endogenous ACTH by the prior admininstration of dexamethasone, insulin-induced hypoglycemia failed to induce a rise in plasma aldosterone and plasma cortisol, through plasma renin activity increased. The increase of plasma aldosterone in response to exogenous ACTH was not different with or without the prior administration of dexamethasone. We conclude that ACTH is largely responsible for the increased aldosterone secretion after insulin-induced hypoglycemia.", 
    "30": "Bile acids cause diarrhea by inducing colonic secretion, probably mediated through the cyclic AMP system. The aim was to determine the effects of an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, propranolol, on deoxycholic acid (DCA) stimulation of net secretion and the cyclic AMP system in the colon. In each of 30 New Zealand white rabbits, 0.9% NaC1 as control and 6 mM and 8 mM DCA were injected in random sequence into three colonic loops in situ. Propranolol, 4 mg per kg was administered intravenously to 12 of the 30 rabbits 1/2 hr before preparation of the loops, i.e., 5 1/2 hr before the rabbits were killed. In the 18 untreated animals, 6 and 8 mM DCA significantly stimulated colonic net secretion and mucosal adenylate cyclase activity; 6 mM DCA caused no change in mucosal phosphodiesterase activity, whereas 8 mM DCA caused a 25% decrease (P less than 0.01). In propranolol-treated animals compared to untreated animals, the volume of luminal fluid in controls was not different, with 6 mM DCA it was 88% less (P less than 0.01), and with 8 mM DCA it was 45% less (P less than 0.01); adenylate cyclase activity in controls was 43% less (P less than 0.01), with 6 mM DCA it was 67% less (P less than 0.01), and with 8 mM DCA it was 65% less (P less than 0.01); phosphodiesterase activity in controls and with 6 mM DCA was not different and with 8 mM DCA it was 38% greater (P less than 0.02). In conclusion, propranolol prevented DCA stimulation of colonic net secretion and inhibited the cyclic AMP system. Propranolol, therefore, warrants investigation as therapy for diarrhea caused by bile acids in the colon.", 
    "31": "Bile acids, especially unconjugated deoxycholic acid, cause diarrhea by inducing colonic mucosal secretion of water and electrolytes. This effect has been shown to be mediated by adenylate cyclase (AC). Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent which inhibits AC, may then prevent this action of bile acids on colonic mucosa. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of bile acids, catecholamines, and propranolol on AC activity in colonic mucosa. The in vitro effects of deoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, NaF, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and propranolol on AC in rabbit colonic mucosa were determined. NaF, 10(-4) M, increased AC activity to 220% of control (P less than 0.01). Deoxycholic acid, 10(-4) M, increased AC activity to 178% of control (P less than 0.01). Lesser but significant (P less than 0.01) stimulation of AC occurred at both higher and lower concentrations of deoxycholic acid, with no effect at 10(-10) M. Taurocholic acid, 10(-4) M, and epinephrine and norepinephrine, 10(-2) M, 10(-4) M, 10(-6) M, and 10(-8) M, had no effect on AC. Propranolol, 10(-6) M, caused a 60% decrease (P less than 0.01) in the stimulated AC activity induced by 10(-4) M deoxycholic acid. Propranolol, 10(-4) M, decreased basal AC by 30% (P less than 0.01).", 
    "32": "(1) Deoxycholic acid, but not taurocholic acid, epinephrine, or norepinephrine, stimulates colonic AC activity. (2) Propranolol inhibited this deoxycholic acid stimulation of AC. (3) Catecholamines are not intermediaries in this action of propranolol on colonic mucosal AC activity.", 
    "33": "Experiments on animals have shown that blunt trauma to the anterior chest wall causes arrhythmia and conduction disturbances. In most cases nodal rhythm and ST segment elevation were observed. Microscopic examination disclosed myocardial damage in the vicinity of the atrioventricular node. Administration of alpha or beta adrenergic receptor blocking agents immediately before trauma failed to prevent arrhythmia and conduction disturbances, on the contrary, they became even more pronounced.", 
    "34": "Antiarrhythmic property of a new adrenergic beta-blocking agent, dl-1-(tert.butylamino)-3[(2-propinyloxy) phenoxy]-2-propanol hydrochloride (K\u00f6 1400-Cl) was studied, using 1) ouabain-induced arrhythmia in the guinea pig, 2) aconitine-induced arrhythmia in the rat, 3) arrhythmia induced by two-step ligation of coronary artery (Harris's method) in the dog and 4) halothane-adrenaline arrhythmia in the dog and was compared with those of propranolol, oxprenolol, procainamide and ajmaline. Procainamide and ajmaline produced a marked protective effect against aconitine-induced ventricular extrasystole, but were not so effective against aconitine-induced ventricular fibrillation, while oxprenolol and, to a lesser degree, propranolol were effective against the latter type of aconitine arrhythmias. K\u00f6 1400-Cl proved to be ineffective. All the compounds tested produced a marked protective action against ouabain-arrhythmia. Whereas procainamide was most effective in abolishing the ventricular arrhythmia due to coronary-ligation even on the first postoperative day, K\u00f6 1400-Cl and propranolol were almost ineffective on the first day. Even on the second postoperative day, the antiarrhythmic effects of these two beta-blockers were not remarkable, effective only in 2/4 animals in the case of K\u00f6 1400-Cl and in 2/3 animals in the case of propranolol. On the contrary, all the beta-blockers tested produced a protective action against halothane-adrenaline arrhythmia at much lower doses than against coronary ligation arrhythmia. The potency ratio of K\u00f6 1400-Cl and propranolol was 3 : 1, which paralleled with beta-blocking activity of these compounds.", 
    "35": "Dopamine increased coronary blood flow in the dog heart pretreated with alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents. The coronary vasodilator response was completely inhibited by indomethacin when pretreated with propranolol in addition to alpha blockade. The coronary vasodilation exerted by sodium nitrite was potentiated by indomethacin and adrenergic blockade. In coronary arterial strips, dopamine produced a contraction which was abolished by phenoxybenzamine. Dopamine elicited a dose-dependent relaxation in coronary arterial strips contracted previously by KC1 after pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine. The relaxation was potentiated by indomethacin; this effect was completely blocked by propranolol. Prostaglandin (PG)E1 produced a relaxing response but reduced the dopamine-induced relaxation. From the results it is suggested that beta-adrenoceptor stimulation and release of PG were involved in the coronary vasodilator response to dopamine. PG released by dopamine may increase coronary blood flow on the one hand and reduce beta-adrenoceptor stimulation by inhibiting adenyl cyclase on the other.", 
    "36": "Effects of propranolo, itramin tosylate and dipyridamole on coronary flow, cardiac activity and phosphate metabolism were investigated in anoxic perfused rat hearts. During anoxia, heart contractions showed a transient increase followed by gradual declines in amplitude and frequency, while ATP and creatine phosphate (CP) contents strikingly decreased accompanying a pronounced increase in inorganic phosphate (Pi). Propranolol added to the anoxic perfusate attenuated the decrease in CP and increase in Pi, whereas heart contractions wre more markedly depressed than by anoxia alone. Similar effects were also seen in electrically paced anoxic hearts. Itramin decreased ATP contents in non-paced anoxic hearts, but did not in paced ones. Dipyridamole did not produce any significant effect on phosphate metabolism in anoxic myocardium. It was considered that propranolol prevented the anoxia-induced reduction in high-energy phosphates by antagonizing catecholamines released by anoxia and that itramin decreased ATP level by inhibiting ATP generation.", 
    "37": "The haemodynamic parameters were studied dynamically by way of noninvasive techniques--tetrapolar thoracic rheography in the course of treatment of 48 patients with essential hypertension Stage IB and IIA urth beta-blocking agents Obsidan and Visken. It was found that as early as by the 5th day of therapy the stroke volume and heart rate decreased, the maximum fall being noted after 2-3 weeks of treatment. The reflex elevation of the total peripheral resistance was moderate, as a result of which a gradual reduction of the arterial pressure developed. The state of the cerebral circulation significantly improved in the course of the treatment (as shown by rheoencephalography) and the tone of the cerebral arteries decreased. After 2-3 weeks of beta-blockers therapy favourable shifts were observed in the response of the general and cerebral haemodynamics to the orthostatic test.", 
    "38": "A comparative clinical study of the efficacy of Benzoral, Trasicor, Viskene, Aptene, Eraldine and Inderal was conducted in the ischaemic heart disease patients. Their antiarrhythmic and antianginal effect was determined, as well as their optimum therapeutic dosages, the activity of their specific beta-adrenolytic properties, the effect of the drugs on the bronchi and the peripheral venous tone. Apart from the clinical study, electro- and polycardiography, functional pulmonary tests and the Schellong orthostatic test were used. All the drugs in question were found to produce a distinct specific beta-blocking effect. They are effective in cases of atrial and ventricular extrasystole, paroxysmal tachycardia, sinus tachycardia and tachyarrhythmic fibrillation, as well as for the prevention of anginal attacks and arrhythmic fibrillation. All the drugs produce a negative inotropic effect, Inderal--the strongest, Viskene and Benzoral--the weakest. All beta-blockers can impair bronchial patency in patients with bronchial obstruction. This effect is least pronounced with Eraldine that may be used as the drug of choice in such cases. In most cases the beta-blockers do not affect the peripheral venous tone, but in some cases they may reduce it.", 
    "39": "A rapid change in length of cat papillary muscle induces two reciprocal diastolic and systolic processes: stretching causes a viscoelastic relaxation of the muscle. The opposite behavior is observed after abrupt releases when - subsequent to an increase in resting tension - diastolic force attains its new equilibrium. The stretch-induced process of relaxation is accompanied by a transient decrease in mechanogram amplitudes; a release is accordingly followed by a temporary increase in isometric muscle performance. The mechanograms of the steady state prove to be the function of the degree of stretch or release, whereas muscle contractions in the early phase of stress relaxation depend on the contractile state before the change in length. All interventions which augment developed tension (increased calcium, decreased potassium, increased or decreased sodium concentrations, strontium, postextrasystolic potentiation, sympathicomimetic agents, frequency potentiation) diminish the transient phenomena due to stretch, whereas low frequency or a lesser intensity of electromechanical coupling (Hexobarbital, Iproveratril, Desoxycorticosteron, Ryanodine) increases them. A decrease of bath temperature enhances the transient increase in force due to a release or an initial reduction of isometric tension after a sudden stretch, although the absolute forces increase. No substantial changes could be observed in reserpinized cats with beta-blocking agents or under hypoxia. It is supposed that alterations in the time course of the action potential could be related to post-stretch and post-release systolic phenomena. A final interpretation of mechanical and electrical events after stretch and release is not possible with the methods used in these experiments.", 
    "40": "The diagnosis of pheochromocytoms is still made only post mortem in a high percentage of the cases. It is important to know both the diversity of clinical forms (of the 16 cases investigated 13 (80%) presented permanent AH, of which 12 cases with paroxysmal attacks, followed by collapse only in one case, and 3 (20%) with paroxysmal AH on a normotensive background) and the severity of cardiovascular accidents, which increases twofold during crises (arrhythmias, left ventricular failure, coronary insufficiency, cerebrovascular strokes, secondary adrenalinic shocks). These complications are preceded by the \"alarm syndrome\". The preoperatory treatment is associated: blocking of adrenergic alpha-receptors and beta-receptors; correction of hypovolemia, also applied during the surgical phase I (until the venous ligature is made and the tumor excised) under continuous monitoring (ECG, ABP and central venous pressure). In phase II vasoplegin should be promptly corrected by nor. E+E, and corticoids.", 
    "41": "The isolated right dog atrium was perfused through the sinus node artery with blood led from a heparinized support dog under constant perfusion pressure of 100 mmHg. The positive chronotropic and inotropic responses to norepinephrine were not significantly suppressed by treatment with large amounts of quinidine or procainamide, but completely blocked by propranolol. From these results, it was demonstrated that quinidine and procainamide have no adrenergic beta-blocking activity on chronotropism and on inotropism in the heart.", 
    "42": "To characterize further a putative dopamine receptor in the renal artery, the effects of dopamine on canine renal artery adenylate cyclase activity were studied. Since the femoral artery is thought to be devoid of a similar dopamine receptor, the effects of dopamine on the adenylate cyclase activity of the canine femoral artery were also studied. In tissues from dogs with or without phenoxybenzamine pretreatment, renal artery adenylate cyclase was maximally stimulated by 4 muM dopamine, compared to 20 muM required for the femoral artery enzyme. The concentrations of isoprenaline required to maximally stimulate renal and femoral artery adenylate cyclase were 0-04 and 0-2 muM, respectively. In tissue from the phenoxybenzamine-pretreated dog, the sitmulatroy effect of dopamine on the renal artery enzyme was selectively blocked by 0-01 muM haloperidol, but not by 0-2 muM propranolol. In the femoral artery, however, the dopamine stimulation was blocked by both antagonists. Stimulation by isoprenaline of renal and femoral artery adenylate cyclase was blocked by propranolol. These data suggest the concept that dopamine interacts with a specific artery receptor apparently different from alpha-and beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "43": "On oral administration, the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (+/-)-bufuralol, (-)-bufuralol, propanolol, oxprenolol, pindolol and alprenolol produced hypotensive responses in the conscious cat; (+)-bufuralol was without effect. The selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs practolol and atenolol had no effect on blood pressure but tolamolol elicited a hypotensive response. All the drugs tested reduced the tachycardia due to intravenous isoprenaline in the conscious cat; however, not all doses of these drugs reduced blood pressure. (+)-Bufuralol was devoid to beta-adrenoceptive blocking activity. Only tolamolol reduced the pressor response to i.v. phenylephrine in the conscious cat, indicating that alpha-adrenoceptive blocking activity may contribute to its hypotensive action. The results suggest that beta-adrenoceptive blocking activity is necessary for the hypotensive responses of these drugs. However, for the different drugs, there was no correlation between peripheral beta-adrenoceptive blocking activity and hypotensive response.", 
    "44": "I.v administration of propranolol (0.2 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg) to pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs produced blockade of cardiac beta-receptors and a significant decrease in heart rate. However, only the higher dose of propranolol demonstrated a significant hypotensive effect. Furthermore, this hypotensive action of propranolol was not associated with either adrenergic neruron blockade or changes in plasma renin activity. These results indicate that the initial hypotensive action of propranolol in mongrel dogs is not due to the blockade of beta-receptors, alterations in peripheral sympathetic nervous transmission or plasma renin activity. On the other hand, the action that propranolol is reported to have within the central system may play an important role in accounting for the acute blood pressure lowering action of the compound in mongrel dogs.", 
    "45": "The beta-adrenergic blocking agent, timolol, appears to be bound to stereospecific as well as nonspecific sites in the particulate fraction (8500g pellet) of the heart, lungs, and brain, whereas the d-isomer of timolol was bound to nonspecific sites only. Timolol disappeared from the particulate fraction at a slower rate than did its optical isomer. At 1 hr after a 0.1-mg/kg dose, the concentration of the l-form in the lung was 1.8 times that of the d-isomer and at 3 and 4 hr the difference was at least 33-fold. The concentration of 14C-timolol in the particulate fraction of rat tissues was inhibited by iv administered timolol and by the l-isomer of propanolol, but not by their corresponding d-forms. Competition for binding sites was dose dependent. Pretreatment with timolol at 0.1 and 5.0 mg/kg reduced the binding of 14C-timolol (dose, 0.1 mg/kg) to lung tissue by 41% and 86%, respectively. In the heart and lung tissue of rats, racemic timolol, propranolol, bunolol, and bunitrolol were approximately equally effective in competing for the binding sites of 14C-timolol. Practolol and sotalol and the beta 2-selective agent butoxamine did not significantly inhibit the binding of 14C-timolol. Similar competition was also observed in the whole brain of rats. This report suggests that the stereospecific binding of timolol may be related to the beta-adrenoreceptor process.", 
    "46": "Eleven substances capable of either augmenting or depleting the alpha- and - beta-adrenergic capacities of the autonomic nervous system were administered to rats exhibiting hypothalamic hypercholesterolemia and to normal controls. Only the beta-adrenergic blocking agents propranolol and possibly 6-OH dopamine were observed to alter (raise) the serum cholesterol concentration, and this occurred in both experimental and control animals. Neither atropine, nor the serotonin-depleting agent, rho-chlorophenylalanine, nor the serotonin-antagonist cyproheptadine, were observed to alter serum cholesterol level. Such absence of effect was also noted with metaraminol, phenoxybenzamine, isoproterenol, epinephrine, reserpine, and alpha-methyl tyrosine.", 
    "47": "The antihypertensive efficacy and side effects of the combined therapy with propranolol, phenoxybenzamine, and hydrochlorothiazide were examined in 17 patients with moderate and moderately severe hypertension. Following a control period two to three weeks' duration, propranolol was started in nine patients as the sole antihypertensive agent and together with phenoxybenzamine, in eight. By titrating the dosage against pulse rate and blood pressure response, propranolol was given, in divided doses, from 80 to 160 mg and phenoxybenzamine, from 20 to 50 mg per day. When propranolol was given alone in nine patients, for four to 12 weeks, normal blood pressure was not attained in any patients. During three to ten weeks of combined propranolol and phenoxybenzamine therapy in 17 patients, normal blood pressure (150/90 mm Hg or less) or near-normal pressure (150/100 or less) was attained in 12 patients in the recumbent position and in 15 patients in the upright position, while orthostatic hypotension was not observed. Except for a reduction of ejaculation in three out of six male patients, no other side effects were encountered. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide diuretic in all of the above 17 patients, at a dose of 50-100 mg per day with a concomitant decrease in the dose of phenoxybenzamine, produced a further reduction in blood pressure, and normal or near-normal blood pressure was attained in all subjects. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, observed in two patients, was treated by a further readjustment of the dose of phenoxybenzamine, while inhibition of ejaculation was persistent in only one patient. It is concluded that the combined administration of propranolol, phenoxybenzamine, and hydrochlorothiazide in individualized doses is very effective in lowering the blood pressure with minimal side effects.", 
    "48": "The effect of timolol versus propranolol on hypertension, hemodynamics, and plasms renin activity was evaluated in 20 men. After two weeks of placebo, 11 men received timolol 30 to 60 mg daily, and nine men received propranolol, 240 to 480 mg daily, for five weeks in a double-blind randomized study. The 20 men then received placebo again for two weeks. Right heart catheterization was performed in all 20 patients after two weeks of the first placebo and after five weeks of timolol or propranolol. Equipotent doses of timolol and propranolol were equally effective in significantly lowering supine and upright systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate recorded on an outpatient basis. Equipotent doses of timolol and propranolol caused similar hemodynamic effects including similar significant depression of cardiac index. Equipotent doses of timolol and propranolol caused similar marked depression of plasma renin activity. The hypotensive action of timolol and of propranolol was unrelated to their effect on plasma renin activity.", 
    "49": "Rat glioma cells in culture (subclone C6-SK71) respond to 0.1 mM noradrenaline by a 100 fold elevation of the intracellular cyclic AMP concentration, and by a subsequent change in morphology. The glioma cells extend multiple processes to resemble the morphology of normal astrocytes in brain tissue. Evidence is presented that the responses are mediated by way of a beta-adrenergic receptor. Both the biochemical and the morphological responses to noradrenaline are visible within minutes, but the cells revert to the untreated condition within 8 hours. Addition of fresh noradrenaline does not alter the sequence of events. A refractory period in which neither effect could be evoked by a subsequent exposure to noradrenaline was observed to last about 50 hours and was not correlated with a change in the rate of cell growth.", 
    "50": "Abrupt cessation of oral propranolol therapy was followed by 15 acute coronary events in 14 patients with severe angina who had been receiving propranolol in daily doses of 80 to 400 mg for periods of 7 days to 6 years. Propranolol had been stopped 1 to 14 days before each acute event because of angiographic study (seven patients), increasing symptoms (three), acute coronary insufficiency (one), asymptomatic bradycardia (one), elective surgery (one) and unknown reasons (two). Before abrupt cessation of propranolol treatment anginal symptoms had been stable in six instances but had increased in the other nine. Cessation was followed by rapid progression of symptoms prior to 11 of the 15 acute events. There were six acute transmural myocardial infarctions with three deaths, three intramural myocardial infarctions, one with ventricular fibrillation, and six episodes of acute coronary insufficiency, Unstable angina followed nine of the events and responded to propranolol therapy (160 to 320 mg/d) in eight instances. Three other patients underwent aortocoronary bypass surgery; perioperative acute myocardial infarction occurred in two. These data suggest that in a minority of patients abrupt cessation of propranolol may be hazardous, particularly in severe or unstable disease. Cessation or propranolol therapy in such patients should be gradual and closely observed. Recurrent symptoms respond to reinstitution of propranolol therapy.", 
    "51": "A series of 102 hypertensive patients were assessed for the frequency of symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon and absent peripheral pulses. Out of 21 patients receiving methyldopa alone only one had cold hands and feet whereas among patients on beta-blockers the incidence was 50%. The frequency of both symptoms and absent pulses was highest in patients taking propranolol compared with those taking atenolol or oxprenolol. Patients without a foot pulse were much more likely to have cold hands. A change from propranolol to oxprenolol in some symptomatic patients resulted in improvement. In two patients the skin temperature fell after an 80-mg dose of propranolol. The mechanism by which beta-blockers induce Raynaud's phenomenon is still not clear.", 
    "52": "The kinetics of alprenolol, in relation to its effect on blood pressure and plasma renin activity, have been studied in sixteen patients. A within-patient comparison was made between therapy for six weeks with placebo or alpronolol 200 mg thrice daily. Thirteen patients responded to alprenolol by a signoficant fall in blood pressure. In three other patients treatment did not lower blood pressure. In the group as a whole there was no significant correlation between the fall in systolic, diastolic or mean blood pressure, and the steady-state plasma alprenolol concentration, renin status, or degree of beta blockade. However, the thirteen responsive patients showed a significant relationship (p less than 0.05 - 0.001) between the log mean steady-state plasma alprenolol concentration and the hypotensive response.", 
    "53": "162 patients discharged from hospital after mycardial infarction were randomly allocated to two groups, one received alprenolol 400 mg daily and the other served as the control. The period of follow-up was two years and all other treatment given was standardized. The two groups did not differ with respect to risk factors for myocardial infarction, the course of the acute infarct or treatment during follow-up. After two years one patient in the group treated with alprenolol had died suddenly as compared to nine in the control group. During the same period four fresh infarcts had occurred in the alprenolol group compared to 15 in the control group. Both these differences were statistically significant. Only four patients were obliged to discontinue beta-blocker treatment because of suspected side-effects. Long-term post-infarction treatment with beta-blockers appears to be an effective form of secondary therapy without serious side-effects.", 
    "54": "Mean steady-state plasma concentrations of alprenolol were studied in relationship to the degree of beta-blockade, in sixteen patients receiving 600 mg daily in divided doses. Steady-state alprenolol concentrations were determined from the area under the plasma concentration-time curve during one eight-hour dosage interval after treatment for six weeks. Beta-blockade during alprenolol treatment was assessed from the chronotropic response to intravenous isoprenaline compared to the response after six weeks of placebo therapy. Although there was interindividual variability in the mean steady-state alprenolol concentration (range 11 - 141 ng/ml), and in the degree of beta-blockade (7-fold), the correlation between the two variables was highly significant (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001). The prescribed dose of alprenolol (mg/kg) was not significantly correlated with the plasma level of alprenolol or the beta-blockade. The chronotropic effects of isoprenaline during placebo and alprenolol were significantly interrelated (r = 0.79, p less than 0.001).", 
    "55": "20 essential hypertension patients with diastolic blood pressure of 100-140 mm Hg were treated with increasing doses (15-45 mg/day by mouth) of pindolol for 14 weeks after an initial placebo period of 5 weeks. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly with as little as 15 mg of pindolol (p less than 0.001). No further changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed when the doses of pindolol were increased. Plasma renin activity (PRA) determined by radioimmunoassay did not change under increasing doses of pindolol. The blood pressure changes did not correlate with initial PRA or with individual changes in PRA under increasing doses with individual changes in PRA under increasing doses of pindolol. These results do not afford evidence for a renin-dependent hypotensive effect of pindolol.", 
    "56": "An investigation of the effectiveness of the beta adrenoceptor blocking drug oxprenolol in the treatment of primary clinical anxiety is reported. A controlled double-blind evaluation of oxprenolol versus diazepam and placebo was carried out. The results of the trial showed diazepam to be generally more effective and to produce a more rapid onset of symptom reduction than oxprenolol. The role of beta adrenergic blocking drugs in the treatment of clinical anxiety and related syndromes is discussed.", 
    "57": "Recommendations regarding the safe waiting period between discontinuing chronic oral propranolol therapy and beginning cardiopulmonary bypass have varied from a few hours to 2 weeks. In the present study, utilizing adult dogs, propranolol was discontinued 8 or 48 hours prior to surgery. A reduction in cardiac output and elevations of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, peak systolic pressure, and systemic resistance were noted when cardiac function was evaluated following the induction of anesthesia and prior to undertaking cardiopulmonary bypass. The magnitude of these differences was directly related to the degree of volume loading and inversely related to the interval between the last dose of propranol and the determination of cardiac function. Reduction of heart rate was the most evanescent of propranolol's hemodynamic effects as the marked bradycardia which persisted throughout the course of propranolol therapy was no longer evident 8 hours after the last oral dose of the drug. Following total cardiopulmonary bypass of 1 hour's duration, undertaken 8 hours after the last oral dose of propranolol, cardiac output and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure had returned to normal but peak systolic pressure and systemic resistance remained significantly elevated, When 48 hours had elapsed between discontinuing propranolol and beginning cardiopulmonary bypass, postbypass cardiac function was essentially normal with only slight persistent elevations of peak systolic pressure and systemic resistance detected. When the combined effects of ischemic heart disease and propranolol therapy, the altered metabolic and hemodynamic effects of different routes of drug administration, and the varying durations of cardiopulmonary bypass are taken into consideration, some of the discrepancies between previously reported clinical and experimental findings regarding the duration of persistent propranolol effects can be understood. The clinical course is usually benign in patients who have received propranolol to within a few hours of surgery without specific indication. However, it is often complicated when the drug is continued until just prior to surgery in patients dependant on propranolol for pain or arrhythmia control. In patients demonstrating propranolol dependence, control of symptoms with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is recommended followed by the gradual withdrawal of propranolol and elective aortocoronary bypass surgery.", 
    "58": "Neurotransmitter-receptor binding sites for apparent muscarinic cholinergic, beta-adrenergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin receptors were measured in the caudate nucleus and frontal cerebral cortex from post-mortem brains of 16 patients with Huntington's chorea and 16 controls. In addition, the samples were assayed for the gamma-aminobutyric-acid-synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and for the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase. In the caudate nucleus of choreic brain, both enzyme activities were markedly lower, with significant decreases in muscarinic cholinergic and serotonin receptor binding, whereas enzyme activities and receptor binding were unchanged in the cerebral cortex. By contrast, gamma-aminobutyric acid and beta-adrenergic receptor binding were not significantly different in choreic and control caudate nucleus or cortex, suggesting that, despite the loss of gamma-aminobutyric-acid-synthesizing ability in the corpus striatum, gamma-aminobuytric acid mimetic drugs might alleviate the movement disorders in Huntington's chorea."
