    "0": "Investigators have shown that interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) can be induced in rats by overexpressing transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) through a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus vector instilled into the lungs (Sime et al. 1997). We have shown that this vector induces IPF in fibrogenic-resistant tumour necrosis factor alpha-receptor knockout (TNF-alphaRKO) mice (Liu et al. 2001). The object of our studies is to understand how peptide growth factors, such as TGF-beta1, mediate interstitial lung disease (ILD). To do so, we must be able to manipulate the dose of the factor and sort out its effects on multiple other mediators in the lung parenchyma. As a step in this complex process, in the studies reported here, we have determined the concentrations of the recombinant adenovirus vector carrying the gene for porcine active TGF-beta1 (AVTGFbeta1) that have little apparent effect, cause clear induction of disease, or severe disease. The disease largely resolves by 28 days in all cases, thus providing a valuable model to understand the mechanisms of the IPF that is mediated, at least in part, by TGF-beta1. The findings here show that 10(6) plaque-forming units (pfu) of AVTGFbeta1, provide essentially a 'no-effect' dose, but even this amount of TGF-beta1 causes a significant increase in whole-lung collagen by day 28 after treatment. In contrast, 10(8) and 10(9) pfu cause severe IPF in 4 days, whereas 10(7) and 5 x 10(7) are intermediate for all parameters studied, i.e. TGF-beta protein, inflammatory cells, cell proliferation, pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene expression and whole-lung collagen accumulation, and expression of growth factors such as TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha and PDGF-A and -B. Interestingly enough, TGF-beta1, as a potent blocker of epithelial cell proliferation, appears to suppress airway epithelial cell growth that would be expected during the inflammatory phase of IPF. Thus, this model system helps us to understand some quantitative aspects of TGF-beta1 biological activity and allows us to manipulate this potent factor as a mediator of interstitial fibrogenesis.",

    "5": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether nipradilol, a beta-blocker having both vasodilating and alpha(1)-blocking activities, can protect retinal cells from the injury induced by ischemia and reperfusion. Rats were anesthetized and, after an intravitreal injection of nipradilol, the intraocular pressure was raised for 45 min to induce retinal ischemia and reperfusion. Before, and 3 and 7 days after the ischemia, electroretinograms were recorded. After the ischemia, the mean amplitude of the b-waves in rats receiving 5 microl of 1.0 x 10(-6) M nipradilol was significantly larger than of controls (injected with phosphate-buffered saline). Histologically, the reduction in the number of retinal ganglion cells (1.0 x 10(-6) M), and the thickness of the inner and outer plexiform layers and the inner nuclear layer (1.0 x 10(-6), 10(-7) and 10(-8) M) was suppressed by nipradilol. These results indicate that nipradilol protected the retina against retinal ischemia and reperfusion and should be considered for therapeutic use in cases of transient retinal ischemia.",

    "15": "A hypercoagulable state might contribute to increased atherothrombotic risk in hypertension. The sympathetic nervous system is hyperactive in hypertension, and it regulates hemostatic function. We investigated the effect of nonspecific beta-adrenergic stimulation (isoproterenol) and blockade (propranolol) on clotting diathesis in hypertension. Fifteen hypertensive and 21 normotensive subjects underwent isoproterenol infusion in two sequential, fixed-order doses of 20 and then 40 ng. kg(-1). min(-1) for 15 min/dose. Thirteen subjects were double-blind studied after receiving placebo or propranolol (100 mg/day) for 5 days each. In hypertensive subjects, isoproterenol elicited a dose-dependent increase in plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen [F(2,34) = 5.02; P = 0.032] and a decrease in D-dimer [F(2,34) = 4.57; P = 0.040], whereas soluble tissue factor remained unchanged. Propranolol completely abolished the increase in vWF elicited by isoproterenol [F(1,12) = 10.25; P = 0.008] but had no significant effect on tissue factor and D-dimer. In hypertension, vWF is readily released from endothelial cells by beta-adrenergic stimulation, which might contribute to increased cardiovascular risk. However, beta-adrenergic stimulation alone may not be sufficient to trigger fibrin formation in vivo.", 
    "16": "On the basis of recent evidence indicating a sex-related lateralization of amygdala function in memory for emotional events, together with substantial evidence suggesting hemispheric specialization in processing global (central) versus local (detail) aspects of a situation, and the established dependence of the amygdala's memory modulating function on beta-adrenergic receptor activation, we predicted differential effects of a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (propranolol) on long-term memory for an emotionally arousing story in men and women. Specifically, we predicted that, relative to placebo, propranolol would impair memory for information central to the story line, but not memory for peripheral story details in men. Conversely, propranolol would impair memory for peripheral details, but not for central information in women. Here we confirm this prediction with a novel analysis of data from our two published studies of propranolol's effect on memory for an emotionally arousing story. These findings demonstrate a sex-related impairment of memory for emotional information by beta-adrenergic blockade. Additionally, they provide support for the hypothesis that, in this paradigm, emotional arousal enhances long-term memory for central information in men via activation of right amygdala/hemisphere function, and enhances long-term memory for peripheral details in women via activation of left amygdala/hemisphere function.", 
    "17": "Enantioselective separations on chiral stationary phases with or without derivatization were developed and compared for the HPLC analysis of (+)-(R)- and (-)-(S)-metoprolol acidic metabolite in human plasma and urine. The enantiomers were analysed in plasma and urine without derivatization on a Chiralcel OD-R column, and in urine after derivatization using methanol in acidic medium on a Chiralcel OD-H column. The quantitation limits were 17 ng of each enantiomer/ml plasma and 0.5 microgram of each enantiomer/ml urine using both methods. The confident limits show that the methods are compatible with pharmacokinetic investigations of the enantioselective metabolism of metoprolol. The methods were employed in a metabolism study of racemic metoprolol administered to a patient phenotyped as an extensive metabolizer of debrisoquine. The enantiomeric ratio (+)-(R)/(-)-(S)-acid metabolite was 1.1 for plasma and 1.2 for urine. Clearances were 0.41 and 0.25 l/h/kg, respectively, for the (+)-(R)- and (-)-(S)-enantiomers. The correlation coefficients between the urine concentrations of the acid metabolite enantiomers obtained by the two methods were >0.99. The two methods demonstrated interchangeable application to pharmacokinetics.",

There were no significant side effects and the patient delivered a healthy baby without complications.", 
    "19": "The antinociceptive activity of donepezil, a novel cholinesterase inhibitor, was investigated in the mouse hot plate test. Donepezil (5 to 10 mg kg(-1) i.p.) induced a dose-dependent antinociception that reached its maximum effect 15 minutes after injection. Donepezil antinociception was prevented by the antimuscarinic drug scopolamine. At analgesic doses, donepezil did not alter gross animal behavior. These results indicate that donepezil is endowed by muscarinic antinociceptive properties, suggesting this compound as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of painful pathologies. Therefore, we investigated donepezil's effect in migraine. Donepezil (5 mg per os, evening assumption) was effective as a prophylatic agent in patients suffering from migraine with or without aura by reducing the number of hours with pain, the number of attacks, and the severity of the pain attack. The efficacy of donepezil was compared with that of the beta-blocker propranolol (40 mg bid per os), showing higher activity. Response rates of a large-sized open study devoid of entry criteria regarding migraine subtypes suggest the drug as an excellent prophylactic compound for migraine in general practice. Clinical results also indicate that the activation of the cholinergic system can represent a novel prophylactic approach to migraine.",

A second experimental setting was used to confirm the results in a different model, which to some extent may also address the issue of blood pressure (BP) in transplant vasculopathy, i.e. orthotopic allotransplantation of infrarenal abdominal aorta from WKY-to-SHR rats. Untreated sham-operated and isografted WKY and SHR served as controls. Allotransplanted animals treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril served as positive treatment controls.", 
    "21": "Rats were randomized to receive standard diet or a diet designed to deliver either 30 mg LU/kg bw/day, 0.3 mg/kg bw/day trandolapril or a combination of both. The duration of either experiment was 8 weeks. BP was measured by tail plethysmography.", 
    "22": "Treatment with LU did not affect systolic BP in either experimental setting. In contrast, trandolapril and combination treatment significantly reduced systolic BP in SHRs. The increase in aortic wall thickness (given in mm) was abrogated to a similar extent in the three treatment groups as compared with untreated allotransplanted animals in either experimental setting (e.g. WKY sham-operated 0.084 +/- 0.013, P < 0.05 vs treatment groups; WKY isotransplanted 0.100 +/- 0.010, P < 0.05 vs treatment groups; WKY allotransplanted 0.289 +/- 0.077, P < 0.05 vs all groups; WKY allotransplanted + trandolapril 0.185 +/- 0.025; WKY allotransplanted + LU 301246 0.192 +/- 0.049; WKY allotransplanted + LU 301246 + trandolapril 0.190 +/- 0.041). This was due to an attenuation of the increase of intima and media thickness. Treatment with LU and trandolapril were similarly effective in attenuating the increase of the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells in the intima. Again, combination treatment did not confer additional benefit. In contrast, trandolapril was more effective than LU in attenuating the increase in the number of PCNA-positive cells in the media. Trandolapril or combination treatment, but not LU, attenuated transforming growth factor-beta expression in aortic allografts.", 
    "23": "The ET(A)-receptor blockade abrogates allograft vasculopathy in two different aorta allotransplantation models to a similar extent as ACE inhibition even in the absence of concomitant immunosuppression. At least in SHRs the effect of ET(A)-receptor blockade is independent of BP. This finding is consistent with the notion that ET(A)-receptor mediated events play a partly BP-independent role in the genesis of chronic transplant vasculopathy.", 
    "24": "The purpose of this study was to develop an organotypic cornea equivalent consisting of three different cell types (epithelial, stromal and endothelial cells) and to investigate its usefulness as in vitro model for permeation studies. The different cell types of a porcine cornea were selectively isolated and a multilayer tissue construct was created step-by-step in Transwell cell culture insert. Histology, basement membrane components (laminin, fibronectin) and surfaces of cornea construct were investigated to evaluate the degree of comparability to porcine cornea from slaughtered animals. The cornea construct exhibited similarities to the original cornea. Ocular permeation of befunolol hydrochloride from different formulations across the cornea construct was tested using modified Franz cells and compared with data obtained from excised cornea. The cornea construct showed a similar permeation behavior for befunolol hydrochloride from different formulations compared with excised porcine cornea. However, permeation coefficients K(p) obtained with the construct were about three to fourfold higher for aqueous formulations and same for the w/o-emulsion. The reconstructed cornea could be an alternative to excised animal tissue for drug permeation studies in vitro.", 
    "25": "Betaxolol, a selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, is an antiglaucoma drug commonly used to lower the intraocular pressure (IOP) in treatment of glaucoma. Recent evidence has also shown that it attenuates ligand- and voltage-gated currents in retinal ganglion cells, which may lead to reduction of intracellular calcium and prevention of glutamate-induced ganglion cell damage in glaucoma. In the present study, we examined the effectiveness of betaxolol and other beta-adrenergic blockers on glutamate-induced calcium signals. Dissociated adult mouse retinal ganglion cells were immuno-labeled with antibody CD90.2 and loaded with Fura-2AM. Calcium signals were recorded with optical recording techniques. Low doses of glutamate cause an increase in intracellular calcium that may result in pathological changes in ganglion cells. The action of glutamate could be reversibly suppressed by beta-adrenergic blockers and the order of inhibitory potency is (s)(-)-propranolol>betaxolol>timolol, with average IC(50) of 78.05, 235.7 and 2167.05, microM, respectively. Betaxolol compressed the dose-response curve of glutamate. The EC(50) of glutamate was shifted from 6.19 to 23.53 microM, indicating that betaxolol acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of glutamate response in retinal ganglion cells. Our data are consistent with previous reports that betaxolol and other beta-adrenergic blockers may exert its neuroprotective action by suppression of glutamate-induced intracellular calcium increase in retinal ganglion cells.", 
    "26": "Rats consistently reduce their food intake following injections of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Because inhibition of serotonergic (5-HT) activity by 8-OH-DPAT (5-HT(1A) activation) attenuates LPS-induced anorexia, we conducted a series of studies to examine whether other 5-HT-receptors are involved in the mediation of peripheral LPS-induced anorexia. In all experiments, rats were injected with LPS (100 microg/kg body weight [BW] ip) at lights out (hour 0). Antagonists were administered peripherally at hour 4, shortly after the onset of anorexia, which presumably follows the enhanced cytokine production after LPS. Food intake was then recorded during the subsequent 2 h or longer. 5-HT receptor antagonists cyanopindolol and SB 224289 (5-HT(1B)), ketanserin (5-HT(2A)), RS-102221 (5-HT(2C)), and metoclopramide (5-HT(3)) failed to attenuate LPS-induced anorexia. In contrast, both ritanserin (5-HT(2A/C)-receptor antagonist) (0.5 mg/kg BW) and SB 242084 (5-HT(2C)) (0.3 mg/kg BW) attenuated LPS-induced anorexia at doses that did not alter food intake in non-LPS-treated rats (all P<.01). Our results suggest that at least part of the anorexia following peripheral LPS administration is mediated through an enhanced 5-HT-ergic activity and the 5-HT(2C) receptor.",

One hundred patients were randomly allocated into five groups of twenty to receive pretreatments of saline or different combinations of esmolol (0.5 or 1.0 mg x kg(-1)) and nicardipine (15 or 30 microg x kg(-1)). Significant tachycardia persisted over a 5-min period after intubation in all five groups compared with baseline levels (p < 0.05). Patients receiving esmolol 1.0 mg x kg(-1) and nicardipine 30 g x kg(-1) showed no significant change in systolic blood pressure after tracheal intubation compared with baseline and significant lower peak systolic blood pressure than those receiving saline (p = 0.023).",

The indication to cesarean section was sudden marked fetal bradycardia. At birth, he presented the following rhythm disorders: a) an ectopic atrial rhythm with T wave alternans, and b) atrioventricular conduction disorders. Sinus rhythm, with a prolonged QT interval and T wave alternans, was recovered soon after birth, before starting beta-blocker therapy. The family history was negative for the long QT syndrome: sudden unexpected death and/or syncopal episodes and cases of congenital deafness have not been reported. Molecular screening of the five long QT syndrome-related genes did not reveal the presence of any mutation. At 3 years of follow-up, the child is well and he did not present with symptoms or arrhythmias during this period.",

Prenatal treatment with beta-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) and digitalis glycosides was prescribed because of suspicion of long QT syndrome occurring with fetal congestive heart failure. The male baby was born at 39 weeks of gestation and showed a prolonged QT interval (QTc = 492 ms) and frequent variable AV block or alternating left and right bundle branch block, depending on the atrial rate. Prenatal administration of lidocaine failed to correct the fetal VT. Conversely, propranolol decreased the attack frequency of fetal VT. Postnatal administration of the K(+) channel opener (nicorandil) successfully shortened the QT interval and improved the outcome.", 
    "30": "Control of hypertension in the vascular patient is clearly a priority. However, these patients often will have significant co-morbidities that may influence the choice of medication, a decision that also may be affected by cost or Health Plan directives. Wherever possible, monotherapy should be attempted first, although in select circumstances combination therapy may be more appropriate. The 5 main categories of drugs used in the initial treatment of hypertensive vascular diseases are (1). diuretics, (2). beta-adrenergic blockers, (3). calcium channel blockers, (4). angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and (5). angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). There are also other less commonly used drugs. Each of the antihypertensive agents is roughly equally effective, producing a good antihypertensive response in 40% to 60% of cases. Some antihypertensives, especially ACE and ARBs, also may have beneficial effects on the vascular and metabolic systems separate from their blood pressure lowering effects, which suggests they may be beneficial even if blood pressure is well maintained with other agents. This report covers the basic information required for the vascular surgeon to become familiar with the various medications and their indications, dosage, and side effects. It also provides some guidelines in selecting relevant antihypertensive treatment regimens for the elderly patient with arterial vascular disease.",

    "40": "Asian Indians who have settled overseas and those in urban India have increased risk of coronary events. Reasons for this increased risk are thought to be genetic but are yet unclear. Advances in molecular cardiology have revealed a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with atherosclerosis. In this review, gene polymorphisms that have been associated with coronary diseases among Indians are discussed. Topics include the genes involved in hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and homocysteine. Mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene resulting in familial hypercholesterolemia have strong association with premature atherosclerosis. Common polymorphism of the apolipoproteins (apo) B-100 and E genes have been associated with variation in lipid and lipoprotein levels. Recently identified polymorphisms in the apoC3 (T-455C, C-482T), and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) (B1/B2 allele) genes are associated with increased triglycerides and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-levels, a feature now also common among Asian Indians. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-deletion (DD) polymorphism has been shown to influence beta-blocker therapy in heart failure. Mutations in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (C667T), cystathionine beta-synthase (T833C), and methionine synthase (A2756G) genes cause hyperhomocysteinemia, an independent risk factor for atherothrombosis. As the genetics of atherosclerosis continues to evolve, these factors along with the newer emerging factors may become a part of the routine assessment, aiding prediction of future coronary events.",

All four antihypertensive medications caused pronounced reduction in LV mass, between 7.9% in the propranolol group and 10.1% in the nicardipine group, with no significant difference between the groups. In patients receiving diuretics, predominant decrease was observed in LV mass and LV mass index. In patients treated with propranolol, the thickness of both the LV wall and interventricular septum was reduced, whereas the reduction in LV mass, LV wall and interventricular septum thickness was found in patients treated with nicardipine. There was no significant correlation between the changes in LV mass and other variables (blood pressure, and systolic and diastolic function).

    "51": "The purpose of the current study was to determine whether nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation is a component of the depolarization/Ca(2+)-dependent signaling in beta-cells. MIN6 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing five tandem repeats of NF-kappaB binding sites linked to a luciferase reporter. The results of these experiments showed that KCl induced depolarization-activated NF-kappaB-dependent transcription (3.8-fold at 45 mmol/l, P < 0.01) in a concentration-dependent manner. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a known inducer of NF-kappaB signaling, activated this construct by 3.4-fold (P < 0.01). The response of NF-kappaB to depolarization was inhibited by the Ca(2+)-channel blocker verapamil and by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 (70 and 62%, respectively). TNF-alpha, glucose, and KCl treatment resulted in inhibitory kappaBalpha degradation by Western blot analysis. TNF-alpha treatment and depolarization activation of NF-kappaB differed significantly in that TNF-alpha activation was not blocked by PD98059. Transfection with PKA, MEK, and MEK kinase induced NF-kappaB-dependent transcription by 20-, 90-, and 300-fold, respectively, suggesting that these pathways contribute to the activation in the depolarization response. These findings demonstrate that depolarization/Ca(2+) influx, as well as TNF-alpha treatment, can activate NF-kappaB-dependent transcription in pancreatic beta-cells, but by different signaling pathways. The current studies show that Ca(2+) signals in pancreatic beta-cells can activate transcription factors involved in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. These findings now add NF-kappaB to the list of depolarization-induced transcription factors in pancreatic beta-cells.",

    "61": "SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling)-3 has recently been shown to be an insulin- and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced negative regulator of insulin signaling. To further clarify a potential involvement of SOCS-3 in the development of insulin resistance, we measured differentiation-dependent SOCS-3 mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and studied its regulation by various hormones known to impair insulin signaling using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. There was a differentiation-dependent downregulation of SOCS-3 mRNA by 50% over the 9 day adipocyte differentiation course. Interestingly, besides insulin and TNF-alpha, chronic treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells with 10 microM isoproterenol for 16 h stimulated SOCS-3 gene expression by about 3.5-fold. Furthermore, isoproterenol stimulated SOCS-3 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner with significant activation detectable at concentrations as low as 10 nM isoproterenol. Moreover, a strong 27- and 47-fold activation of SOCS-3 mRNA expression could be seen after 1 h of isoproterenol and GH treatment respectively. The stimulatory effect of isoproterenol could be almost completely reversed by pretreatment of 3T3-L1 cells with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Finally, isoproterenol's action could be mimicked by stimulation of G(S)-proteins with cholera toxin and of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP. Taken together, our results demonstrate a differentiation-dependent downregulation of SOCS-3 in adipocytes and suggest that SOCS-3 gene expression is stimulated by beta-adrenergic agents via activation of a G(S)-protein-adenylyl cyclase-dependent pathway. As SOCS-3 is a novel inhibitor of insulin signaling, the data support a possible role of this protein as a selectively regulated mediator of catecholamine-induced insulin resistance.",

Analytical methods involve two different liquid-liquid extractions of human plasma, with diethyl ether for bisoprolol and with dichloromethane for metoprolol, coupled with a similar Nucleosil C(18) reversed-phase HPLC column. Fluorimetric detection was used to identify both beta-blockers. Retention times for bisoprolol and metoprolol were 8.7 and 3.2 min, respectively.

    "72": "The present study has been aimed at characterizing the ATP/P2 receptor (and transductional pathways) responsible for the morphological changes induced in vitro by alphabetamethyleneATP on rat astrocytes obtained from cerebral cortex, a brain area highly involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Exposure of cells to this purine analogue resulted in elongation of cellular processes, an event reproducing in vitro a major hallmark of in vivo reactive gliosis. alphabetamethyleneATP-induced gliosis was prevented by the P2X/P2Y blocker pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2'-4'-disulfonic acid, but not by the selective P2X antagonist 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP, ruling out a role for ligand-gated P2X receptors. Conversely, the Gi/Go protein inactivator pertussis toxin completely prevented alphabetamethyleneATP-induced effects. No effects were induced by alphabetamethyleneATP on intracellular calcium concentrations. RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that alphabetamethyleneATP-induced gliosis involves up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (but not lipooxygenase). Also this effect was fully prevented by pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2'-4'-disulfonic acid. Experiments with inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) suggest that extracellular signal regulated protein kinases (ERK)1/2 mediate both cyclooxygenase-2 induction and the associated in vitro gliosis. These findings suggest that purine-induced gliosis involves the activation of a calcium-independent G-protein-coupled P2Y receptor linked to ERK1/2 and cyclooxygenase-2. Based on the involvement of cyclooxygenase-2 and inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, these findings open up new avenues in the identification of novel biological targets for the pharmacological manipulation of neurodegeneration.",

However, since baseline blood pressure was significantly lower in treated hypertensives than in placebo-given patients, all antihypertensive drugs eventually resulted in a lower blood pressure level during stress, as compared with untreated patients.

To investigate the action of this drug, we studied the effect of nipradilol on the isolated rabbit ciliary artery. Under the dissecting microscope, ciliary arteries were prepared from rabbit eyes and mounted on a myograph system. The effects of nipradilol on the isolated rabbit ciliary artery were investigated using isometric tension recording methods. Nipradilol provoked a dose-dependent (10 microM-1m M) relaxation in ciliary arteries that were pre-contracted with high-K solutions (K(+): 100.7 m M). It also inhibited the amplitude of smooth muscle contraction evoked by field stimulation. Nipradilol was more effective in relaxing phenylephrine-induced contraction (EC(50): 21.6+/-16.3 microM) compared to high-K solution-induced contractions (EC(50): 230+/-130 microM). Application of N(w)-nitro- L -arginine methylester (300 microM), a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, or denudations of endothelium by rubbing the inner surface with a scalp hair did not affect this relaxation. However, NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO (1m M) or methylene blue (10 microM), a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, inhibited the nipradilol-induced relaxation. These results indicate that nipradilol relaxes the rabbit ciliary artery by two different mechanisms. First, the relaxation is due to the NO produced by denitrification of nipradilol itself. Second, nipradilol may act as an alpha-adrenergic antagonist. These actions of nipradilol may explain the mechanisms of increased ocular blood flow in vivo.",

We sought to evaluate the management of AMI in a small non-academic general hospital. A review was performed of cases of AMI during 2000. Ninety-two cases were analysed, 69% were male.

An important subset of heart disease is perioperative myocardial infarction, which affects approximately 50,000 persons each year. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have coauthored a guideline on preoperative cardiac risk assessment, as has the American College of Physicians (ACP). The ACC/AHA guideline uses major, intermediate, and minor clinical predictors to stratify patients into different cardiac risk categories. Patients with poor functional status or those undergoing high-risk surgery require further risk stratification via cardiac stress testing. The ACP guideline also starts by screening patients for clinical variables that predict perioperative cardiac complications. However, the ACP did not feel there was enough evidence to support poor functional status as a significant predictor of increased risk. High-risk patients would sometimes merit preoperative cardiac catheterization by the ACC/AHA guideline, while the ACP version would reserve catheterization only for those who were candidates for cardiac revascularization independent of their noncardiac surgery. A recent development in prophylaxis of surgery-related cardiac complications is the use of beta blockers perioperatively for patients with cardiac risk factors.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of antihypertensive treatment with doxazosin or propranolol on the binding and functional parameters of A2A adenosine receptors of lymphocytes and neutrophils in essential hypertensive patients. Two groups of previously untreated, essential hypertensive patients were studied. The mean affinity (K(d)) and density (B(max)) of adenosine receptors, by the A2A selective radioligand [3H]-ZM-241385 binding assays, and EC50, by cAMP assays, were obtained first on no medication and a second time after treatment for up to 13 weeks with doxazosin (13 patients) or propranolol (8 patients). A third group of 15 healthy normotensive volunteers matched by age, sex, and body mass index was used as a control. Binding and functional parameters of the A2A adenosine receptors were significantly higher in the 2 hypertensive groups than in controls (P always <0.0001), both in lymphocyte and neutrophil membranes. After treatment with propranolol, the binding parameters did not change significantly, whereas after treatment with doxazosin, K(d), B(max), and EC50 values returned to control levels. In never-treated essential hypertensive patients, lower affinity, higher density, and impaired function of A2A adenosine receptors are present.

The aldosterone/plasma renin activity ratio (ARR) is routinely used as a screening test. Antihypertensive therapy can interfere with the interpretation of this parameter, but a correct washout period can be potentially harmful. We have investigated the effects of therapy with atenolol, amlodipine, doxazosin, fosinopril, and irbesartan on the ARR in a group of 230 patients with suspected primary aldosteronism. The percent change from control of ARR in patients taking amlodipine was -17%+/-32; atenolol, 62%+/-82; doxazosin, -5%+/-26; fosinopril, -30%+/-24; and irbesartan, -43%+/-27. The ARR change induced by atenolol was significantly higher compared with that induced by all other drugs (P<0.0001), and the ARR change induced by irbesartan was significantly lower than that induced by doxazosin (P<0.0001). One of 55 patients from the group taking amlodipine (1.8%) and 4/17 of the patients taking irbesartan (23.5%) gave a false-negative ARR (<50). None of the patients of the groups taking fosinopril, doxazosin, and atenolol displayed a false-negative ARR. Doxazosin and fosinopril can be used in hypertensive patients who need to undergo aldosterone and PRA measurement for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism; amlodipine gave a very small percentage of false-negative diagnoses. beta-Blockers also do not interfere with the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, but they can be responsible for an increased rate of false-positive ARRs. The high rate of false-negative diagnoses in patients undergoing irbesartan treatment requires confirmation in a higher number of patients.",

Dobutamine stress myocardial perfusion imaging is an alternative to exercise in patients with limited exercise capacity. In many centers, the test is performed on patients who have a contraindication for vasodilator stress testing. Recent studies have shown hyperemia induced by the standard dobutamine-atropine stress test is not less than hyperemia induced by dipyridamole. The feasibility of the test is 90% and is often higher in patients without beta-blocker therapy. The safety of the test has been well studied and was also demonstrated in specific patients groups, such as patients with left ventricular dysfunction, the elderly, and heart transplant recipients. The diagnostic accuracy has been demonstrated in patients with and without myocardial infarction and in specific groups such as those with hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart transplant recipients and after revascularization. The technique has a high sensitivity for prediction of functional recovery in patients with myocardial dysfunction referred for revascularization. The presence and severity of myocardial perfusion abnormalities assessed by this method are powerful predictors of cardiac events, incremental to clinical data. This article describes the methodology, safety, feasibility, diagnostic accuracy, and prognostic value of dobutamine stress myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, with additional considerations for the application of the test in specific patient groups.",

For the in vivo study, we used a rat model of retinal ischemic injury induced by elevating intraocular pressure (IOP) by raising the hydrostatic pressure. The retinal damage was evaluated by counting the number of cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and by examining the a- and b-waves in the electroretinogram (ERG). For the intraocular distribution study, 0.5% [3H]timolol was topically applied to rat eyes, and these were enucleated after various intervals and divided into parts. Each part was combusted and the radioactivity measured. Timolol (0.1 and 1 microM) markedly reduced the glutamate-induced neuronal cells in retinal neuron cultures and in RGCs. After ischemic-reperfusion, both the number of cells in the GCL and a- and b-waves in the ERG decreased; however, topically applied 0.5% timolol reduced these effects. Topically applied 0.5% timolol was detected at a concentration of approximately 1 microg/g wet tissue in retina-choroid at 30 min after its application. In conclusion, timolol was effective against retinal neuron damage both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, topically applied timolol reached the retina-choroid. These findings suggest that timolol has a direct neuroprotective effect against retinal damage.",

Patients with relatively advanced impairment of cardiac sympathetic nerve function, as manifested by a baseline I-123 MIBG ratio lower than 1.40, had a statistically significant improvement in I-123 heart-mediastinum ratio with carvedilol treatment, from 1.26 +/- 0.12 to 1.39 +/- 0.20 (P =.004). Of 10 patients with a baseline I-123 MIBG ratio lower than 1.40, 9 had an increase in the heart-mediastinum ratio with carvedilol treatment.

    "97": "We randomly assigned 522 patients who had persistent atrial fibrillation after a previous electrical cardioversion to receive treatment aimed at rate control or rhythm control. Patients in the rate-control group received oral anticoagulant drugs and rate-slowing medication. Patients in the rhythm-control group underwent serial cardioversions and received antiarrhythmic drugs and oral anticoagulant drugs. The end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, heart failure, thromboembolic complications, bleeding, implantation of a pacemaker, and severe adverse effects of drugs.",

    "104": "Recently published actively controlled outcome trials in hypertension compared conventional therapy (diuretics and beta-blockers) with newer antihypertensive drug classes, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II antagonists. In a quantitative overview of nine trials including 62,605 randomized patients, it was found that conventional therapy and newer drug classes had similar long-term efficacy in preventing cardiovascular complications of hypertension. BP lowering largely accounted for most, if not all, of the observed benefits in cardiovascular outcome. These findings emphasize the desirability of lowering BP as much as possible to maximize the reduction in cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, several clinical trials have been specifically designed to highlight specific mechanisms of action of the newer drugs by measuring intermediate end points, such as carotid intima-media thickening or renal dysfunction, or by studying subgroups of patients with specific disorders, such as diabetes mellitus. In these trials, calcium channel blockers were more effective than conventional therapy in preventing carotid intima-media thickening and mild renal dysfunction, whereas use of calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was associated with a lower incidence of diabetes mellitus in some studies. However, whether or not these specific effects of the newer drugs on intermediary and/or metabolic end points in the long run also lead to fewer cardiovascular complications remains to be proved.",

    "106": "Combination of nitrendipine (10 mg/kg/d) and atenolol (20 mg/kg/d) was given in SHR chow for 12 weeks. Blood pressure (BP) was then recorded during 24 h in conscious state. After the determination of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), rats were killed for organ-damage evaluation.", 
    "107": "Long-term treatment with Nile significantly decreased BP and BPV, ameliorated impaired BRS, and obviously diminished end-organ damage in SHR. The indices of left ventricular and aortic hypertrophy, and glomerulosclerosis score were all positively related to BP and BPV, and negatively related to BRS in untreated and Nile-treated SHR. Multiple-regression analysis showed that decrease in left ventricular and aortic hypertrophy was mainly related to the decrease in systolic BPV, and amelioration in renal lesion was mainly determined by increase in BRS.",

    "109": "Bisoprolol is a highly selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist. Administration of bisoprolol to patients with chronic heart failure is associated with increases in left ventricular function and reductions in heart rate; increases in heart rate variability are also seen. Two major randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials have examined the clinical efficacy of bisoprolol in combination with ACE inhibitors and diuretics in patients with stable chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV): the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS; n = 641) and CIBIS II (n = 2 647). All-cause mortality (primary endpoint) was significantly lower in bisoprolol than in placebo recipients in CIBIS II (11.8 vs 17.3%) and was reduced by bisoprolol regardless of dosage. All-cause mortality was also lower in CIBIS (16.6 vs 20.9%) although the difference did not achieve statistical significance. In a meta-analysis of CIBIS and CIBIS II (n = 3 288), a relative reduction of 29% in the incidence of all-cause mortality was seen in bisoprolol versus placebo recipients; this analysis also demonstrated that bisoprolol reduces mortality in patients with chronic heart failure regardless of aetiology or severity. In CIBIS II, there were significantly fewer cardiovascular deaths, admissions to hospital for any reason, or cardiovascular deaths or cardiovascular hospitalisations (combined endpoint) in bisoprolol, compared with placebo, recipients (secondary endpoints). Compared with standard treatment alone, the addition of bisoprolol was a cost-effective option in chronic heart failure in UK, French, German and Swedish pharmacoeconomic studies. Bisoprolol is generally well tolerated in patients with chronic heart failure. In CIBIS II, adverse events occurring more commonly in bisoprolol than placebo recipients, regardless of causal relationship with the study medication, included dizziness, bradycardia, hypotension and fatigue. Bisoprolol recipients were less likely than placebo recipients to experience worsening of heart failure, dyspnoea or tachycardia. In both CIBIS and CIBIS II there was no significant difference between bisoprolol and placebo recipients in the incidence of permanent treatment withdrawal. In conclusion, adding the highly selective beta(1)-blocker bisoprolol to a treatment regimen comprising an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic significantly improves survival in patients with stable chronic heart failure and reduces the need for hospitalisation. The use of bisoprolol in this disorder is generally well tolerated and is cost effective. Thus, bisoprolol should be considered a standard treatment option when selecting a beta-blocker for use in combination with ACE inhibitors and diuretics in patients with stable, moderate to severe chronic heart failure.",

Procedure Six Burmese cats diagnosed with primary glaucoma were managed over periods varying from 3 months to 4.5 years. Clinical details were obtained from practice records. Gonioscopic examination of the drainage or iridocorneal angle in eyes of these affected cats was made.",

In one of the affected cats, one eye had been enucleated prior to the commencement of the study, thus a total of 11 eyes were examined. Clinically, all affected eyes (n = 8) had injected episcleral blood vessels and elevated intraocular pressure. Gonioscopy revealed the presence of nine narrow and two closed iridocorneal angles. Medical therapy included topical 2% dorzolamide (n = 8), 0.5% timolol maleate (n = 1), 0.005% latanoprost (n = 1) and 0.5-1.0% prednisolone acetate (n = 8). Surgery was performed in six eyes using either diode laser (n = 5) and/or cryothermy (n = 2) and one eye was eviscerated, with implantation of a prosthesis.

    "114": "12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)HETE) is a bioactive metabolite of arachidonic acid synthesized by 12-lipoxygenase. The 12-lipoxygenase blocker, baicalein, prevents epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced activation of protein kinase C (PKC) alpha and beta in lens epithelial cells, whereas supplementation with 12(S)HETE reverses this effect, suggesting that EGF and 12(S)HETE may work together to activate PKC. This study investigates the mechanism of PKCbeta activation by EGF and 12(S)HETE. 12(S)HETE alone directed translocation of PKCbeta through the C1 rather than the C2 domain, without activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or MAPK signaling or increasing intracellular calcium concentration. In the presence of baicalein, EGF triggered an asymmetric phosphorylation of the EGF receptor initiating signaling through PI3K and MAPK, but not PLCgamma. Together, 12(S)HETE and EGF synergistically increased phosphorylation of PKCbeta in the activation loop and C terminus as well as PKCbeta-specific activity. PI3K inhibitors blocked phosphorylation, but MEK1 inhibitors did not. Microvesicles containing phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate mimicked the action of EGF on PKCbeta activity in the presence of 12(S)HETE. Kinase-inactive PKCbeta mutations in either activation loop or C terminus were effectively translocated by 12(S)HETE, as was PKCbeta in the presence of chelerythrine or G\u00f6-6983. These findings indicate that unphosphorylated PKCbeta is translocated to the membrane by 12(S)HETE and phosphorylated by EGF-dependent PI3K signaling, to generate catalytically competent PKCbeta.", 
    "115": "We evaluated the cardioprotective effects of long-term treatment with celiprolol (for 5 weeks), a specific beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist with a weak beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist action, on endothelin-1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1) expression and cardiovascular remodeling in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. Upregulated preproendothelin-1, endothelin ET(A) receptor, TGF-beta(1), c-fos, and type I collagen expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activities were suppressed by celiprolol. Celiprolol effectively inhibited vascular lesion formation such as medial thickness and perivascular fibrosis. These observations suggested that extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-fos gene pathway may contribute to the cardiovascular remodeling of DOCA rats, and that cardioprotective effects of celiprolol on cardiovascular remodeling may be mediated, at least in part, by suppressed expression of endothelin-1 and TGF-beta(1).",

The results of such searches and the options for refinement of the hit lists are presented using a rigid tetrahydroisoquinoline-carbazole (IQC) hybrid molecule fitted onto previously developed pharmacophores for subtype-selective alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonists as an example. The compounds retrieved were further analysed by limiting their physical properties to 'drug-like' ranges and by enumerating the ring skeletons they contain. Selected ring skeletons were evaluated by fitting them on to the original pharmacophores. Several structurally novel rigid ring skeletons were found with this new database mining technique which are potentially useful as leads in the design of alpha1B selective adrenergic receptor antagonists.", 
    "117": "Beta blockers are one of the oral agents shown to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates in randomized, controlled trials, and hence, they are widely used for the management of many cardiovascular situations. In terms of side effects there are 3 major modes of action: (1) contraction of smooth muscles, particularly of bronchi with nonselective agents; (2) exaggerated cardiac effects; and (3) central nervous system effects. There are also some rare side effects of beta blockers, some of which are unpredictable, but the others are related to mode of action at the cellular level. Beta-blocking agents may cause psoriaform eruptions and worsen existing psoriasis. Psoriasis may be an inconvenient side effect of beta blockade. Herein, we report a case of beta-blocker-induced psoriasis.", 
    "118": "Dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction is a less well-known mechanical complication of acute myocardial infarction. Early diagnosis is important because initiation of proper management and avoidance of precipitating factors can lead to complete recovery. A patient is described who presented with acute myocardial infarction and in whom significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction developed. Adequate therapy with beta blockers and calcium channel blockers led to complete resolution of the obstruction.", 
    "119": "The purposes of this study were to assess the occurrence of euthyroid sick syndrome in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or unstable angina (UA), and the relationship with beta-blocker or thrombolytic therapy. Plasma triiodothyronine (T3), reverse T3 (rT3), free T3 (FT3), thyroxine (T4), free T4 (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), and albumin (ALB) levels were determined in 95 patients (59 males, 36 females, aged 58.4+/-9) with AMI and 19 patients (13 males, 6 females aged 54.7+/-12.3) with UA for 5 consecutive days from the onset of the acute syndrome and 1 month later. Patients were divided according to beta-blocker therapy and thrombolytic therapy. There was a significant T3 decrease and rT3 increase in all patients during the first 5 days following admission (p < 0.05). FT3 and FT4 remained unchanged during the study. In patients with complicated infarctions, the rT3 increase and the T3 decrease were significantly greater compared to those with uncomplicated infarctions (p<0.03). TSH, T4, TBG, and ALB were significantly (p<0.05) decreased only in complicated infarctions. No differences were observed between patients with or without thrombolysis or patients with or without beta-blocker treatment. The apparent decrease in T3, the increase in rT3 levels and the decreased TSH and T4 levels, show clearly that the euthyroid sick syndrome (low T3) occurs not only in AMI but also in UA. In addition, these hormonal changes are not affected by beta-blocker therapy and thrombolysis does not influence the occurrence of the syndrome. The degree of T3 decrease is proportional to the severity of cardiac damage and may have a possible prognostic value.",

It should be used if headaches are too frequent, disabling, or associated with worrisome neurological features or if acute treatment is overused or ineffective. The chosen drug should be given an adequate trial in the absence of interfering medications. Choose a drug based on its efficacy, adverse event profile, and the presence of coexistent conditions.", 
    "121": "Numerous hypertension treatment trials have been reported during the past several years. In comparative studies it has been shown that the use of diuretics or diuretics/beta blockers has resulted in a reduction in morbidity/mortality equivalent to the use of other antihypertensive medications. This is true in both young and elderly patients. In one large 8-year study in diabetics, the use of a beta blocker/diuretic combination was shown to be as effective in reducing overall cardiovascular events as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/diuretic treatment program. Although most data indicate that the degree of blood pressure lowering accounts for most of the benefit, there are some differences in outcome that may be explained by different mechanisms of drug action. For example: 1) diuretics are more effective in preventing heart failure and overall cardiovascular events than alpha blockers; 2) an ACE inhibitor-based program is more effective in the elderly in reducing myocardial infarctions and heart failure than a calcium channel blocker-based program; and 3) a nondihydropyridine is more effective in reducing strokes, but less effective in preventing myocardial infarctions or heart failure, than a program based on diuretic therapy. There is also abundant evidence that the use of ACE inhibitors may prevent the occurrence of diabetes in hypertensive individuals and will reduce cardiovascular events in diabetics. Finally, the angiotensin receptor blockers have been shown to slow the progression of renal disease and prevent the occurrence of end-stage renal disease when compared to treatment regimens that do not include an angiotensin receptor blocker or ACE inhibitor. Updated treatment recommendations should include an ACE inhibitor and possibly an angiotensin receptor blocker along with diuretics and beta blockers as initial therapy. In addition, recommendations for the use of multiple-drug therapy have been reinforced by recent trials. Goal pressures are not readily achieved with monotherapy, especially in high-risk patients.", 
    "122": "Adrenergic agents are commonly used in the treatment of chronic orthostatic intolerance with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). POTS may be associated with increased limb blood flow (\"high flow\") and defective orthostatic vasoconstriction or decreased limb blood flow (\"low flow\") and potentially with small blood volume.", 
    "123": "We investigated the consequences of short-term intravenous administration of an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine, and a beta-1 adrenergic antagonist, esmolol, in 14 patients with POTS aged 13 to 19 years. Indices of heart rate and blood pressure variability, peripheral blood flow, and arterial resistance were assessed, and the capacitance relation was computed for every subject using venous occlusion plethysmography. Patients were tilted to 35 degrees upright while medicated and while unmedicated, and measurements were repeated. Phenylephrine improved orthostatic tolerance and normalized hemodynamics and indices of heart rate/blood pressure variability while supine and while upright, producing significant peripheral vasoconstriction and venoconstriction (20% capacitance change). Esmolol did not improve orthostatic tolerance or hemodynamics. A subgroup of low-flow POTS patients had exaggerated venoconstriction to phenylephrine (50% capacitance change) but others had no response.",

    "125": "Although vascular compliance, deltaV/deltaP, is abnormal in essential hypertension and can be improved by antihypertensive drug therapy, it is not clear whether drug-induced changes in compliance are attributable solely to lower achieved blood pressure (BP), and thus equally likely with different drugs possessing similar antihypertensive efficacy. Therefore, we used computerized arterial pulse waveform analysis (CAPWA) to measure capacitive (C1) and oscillatory (C2) components of arterial compliance in essential hypertensive subjects (n = 39) before, and 1 and 3 months after achieving normotensive BP values with administration of either dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (CaBl, n = 11), converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI, n = 9), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB, n = 9), or beta-blockers (BBl, n = 10). Despite equivalent effects on BP (CABL: -19 +/- 4/-15 +/- 2 mm Hg; CEI: -12 +/- 3/-13 +/- 2 mm Hg; ARB: -10 +/- 3/-12 +/- 2 mm Hg; and BBl: -14 +/- 3/-12 +/- 2 mm Hg; P <.005 for each drug v pretreatment), CaBl, CEI, and ARB significantly increased arterial compliance (CaBl: %deltaC1 = 30.0 +/- 5.8, %Delta C2 = 43.7 +/- 23.3; CEI: %deltaC1 = 32.7 +/- 5.4, %deltaC2 = 26.7 +/- 7.1; ARB: %deltaC1 = 36.3 +/- 11.8, %deltaC2 = 43.6 +/- 23.1; P <.01 for CaBl, CEI, and ARB v pretreatment), but BBl did not (%deltaC1 = -3.9 +/- 7.6, %deltaC2 = -7.0 +/- 11.5, P = not significant v pretreatment, sig = 0.01 v other drugs). We conclude that for an equivalent effect on BP, arterial compliance improves after therapy with some, but not all antihypertensive drugs. We hypothesize that a greater clinical benefit may result from the preferential use of drugs that concomitantly improve arterial compliance.", 
    "126": "In asthma, beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist responsiveness has been associated with Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu polymorphisms of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor. Since the guinea pig is extensively used as an animal model for asthma, we investigated the occurrence of possible polymorphism of the guinea pig beta(2)-adrenoceptor. The guinea pig beta(2)-adrenoceptor coding region was amplified by sequence homology-based cloning. Homology of the translated protein with the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor was 88% with Ala at position 16 and Glu at position 27. Radioligand binding and cAMP- accumulation experiments of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the guinea pig beta(2)-adrenoceptor revealed a homogeneous population of functional receptors. Five degenerate single nucleotide polymorphisms were found within the beta(2)-adrenoceptor coding region of outbred Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs, at residues 354, 453, 483, 534 and 642. In conclusion, we have cloned the guinea pig beta(2)-adrenoceptor, which shows to be functional upon expression in a recombinant system and contains five single nucleotide polymorphisms dissimilar to human polymorphisms.", 
    "127": "Mitogen-activated protein kinases (such as Erk1/2) regulate phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau and processing of the amyloid protein beta, both events critical to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report that enhanced and prolonged Erk1/2 phosphorylation in response to bradykinin (BK) was detected in fibroblasts of both familial and sporadic AD, but not age-matched controls (AC). The AD-associated abnormality in Erk1/2 phosphorylation was not seen in fibroblasts from Huntington's disease patients with dementia. The elevation of Erk1/2 phosphorylation occurred immediately after BK stimulation and required an IP3-sensitive Ca(2+) release as well as activation of PKC and c-src as upstream events. Treatment of cells with the PI-3 kinase blocker LY924002 partially inhibited the BK-stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation in AC, but had no effect in AD cells, suggesting that the BK-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation in AD cells is independent of PI-3 kinase. Activation of the cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) monitored as an increase in phosphorylation at Ser-133 was also observed after BK stimulation. Unlike the AD-specific differences for Erk1/2, however, the BK-stimulated CREB phosphorylation was not different between AC and AD cells. Abnormal Erk1/2 activities may alter downstream cellular processes such as gene transcription, amyloid precursor protein processing, and tau protein phosphorylation, which contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, detection of AD-specific differences in MAP kinase in peripheral tissues may provide an efficient means for early diagnosis of AD as well as help us to identify therapeutic targets for drug discovery.",

The rate of improvement in the tolerability profile (success) was always greater than the rate of failure (93.3 vs 6.7% at the end of treatment). Adverse reactions amounted to 1125 at baseline, 129 at 4 weeks and 46 at 8 weeks of treatment. Adverse events to candesartan were reported in 2.7% of patients.

Concerns remain about the appropriateness of beta-blocker therapy in the elderly, even though many of these are unsubstantiated, and evidence exists to support beta-blocker use. A literature search reveals that beta-blockers and nonpharmacologic interventions are effective in the elderly. Although no well-designed, long-term, large-scale, clinical trials exist that assess outcomes for beta-blockers as monotherapy for treating hypertensive elderly patients, this fact should not deter their use in combination therapy, especially for those with comorbid diseases such as angina, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.", 
    "133": "While beta-blockers have been demonstrated effective in many clinical trials of post-myocardial infarction patients, the trial populations have often excluded the elderly. Analysis of available data from older patients in large trials and results of smaller trials and retrospective studies suggest that benefit derived from beta-blocker therapy is not affected by age. Even though these data have limitations, beta-blocker therapy has been consistently associated with improved survival in all age groups, including patients older than 80 years. Underutilization of these drugs among the elderly is disconcerting given their benefit.", 
    "134": "Heart failure is a significant problem among the elderly. Although many nonpharmacologic interventions, such as dietary sodium restriction, and drug therapy with digoxin and angiotensin-converting enzymes are considered to be the standard of care, ss-blockers have recently been shown to improve survival and reduce morbidity when added to the standard regimen. Although studies have demonstrated a significant benefit of ss-blockers, the drugs remain underutilized, partly from concerns about tolerability. Adapting a \"start low, go slow\" approach and titrating dosage upward can lessen tolerability issues and improve usage among the elderly.",

Even though ss-blockers can provide benefits nearly equal to those experienced by younger patients, the drugs remain underutilized by the elderly. Consequently, underuse contributes to higher mortality and hospitalization rates among these patients. This derives, in part, from many factors that include physiologic changes accompanying aging, presence of comorbid diseases, use of multiple medications, issues of drug tolerability, and poor patient compliance; however, education can overcome some of these to facilitate more widespread use among elderly patients.",

On the last day of acebutolol ingestion subjects performed three successive 15-min rides at 30%, 50% and 70% of their peak power output and then cycled at increasing (15 W min(-1)) work rates to exhaustion. Force output, heart rate, submaximal VO(2), rate of perceived exertion (RPE), electromyographic (EMG) data and blood lactate were captured during the cycling activity. Peak work rate [270 (111) W vs 197 (75) W, CON vs BETA, P <0.01], time to exhaustion [49.7 (23.2) min vs 40.3 (23.7) min, CON vs BETA, P <0.05] and heart rate [mean, for the full ride 135.5 (38.3) beats min(-1) vs 111.5 (30.0) beats min(-1) CON vs BETA, P <0.05] were significantly lower for the group who ingested beta(1)-blockade (BETA) compared to the control group (CON). Although not significant, submaximal VO(2)was reduced in BETA during the ride, while RPE was significantly higher during the ride for BETA (P <0.01). Mean integrated electromyography was higher in the BETA group although these differences were not significant. Mean power frequency values of the BETA group showed a significant (P <0.05) shift to the upper end of the spectrum in comparison to the control group. Lactate values [11.7 (3.5) mmol x l(-1) vs 7.1 (4.1) mmol x l(-1)CON vs BETA] were significantly lower (P <0.05) at exhaustion in BETA. Significant reductions in cycling performance were found when subjects ingested beta(1)-blockers. This study has shown significant shifts to the upper end of the EMG frequency spectrum after beta(1)-blocker ingestion, which could be caused by a change in neuromuscular recruitment strategy to compensate for the impaired submaximal exercise performance.", 
    "137": "Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) plays a significant role in the pathology of central nervous system diseases. Inducible NOS expression is regulated by intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) signaling, and astrocytes contain both iNOS and adenylate cyclase-coupled neurotransmitter receptors. The data obtained from the present study indicated that acetylcholine, lambda-amino-n-butyric acid, glutamate, quinolinic acid, N-methyl-D-aspartate and aspartate have no effect on NO(2)(-) production in C6 glioma cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma. However, dopamine (DA) caused inhibition of NO(2)(-) production and iNOS transcription. The effects of DA were not due to homovanillic acid/3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, the autoxidative products superoxide (O(2)(-))/hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) or direct reactions with NO(2)(-). Forskolin, adenylate cyclase activator, dose-dependently reduced NO(2)(-). Meanwhile, (+/-) SKF-38393 D(1) receptor agonist attenuated iNOS in a similar fashion to DA. In addition, the results indicated that DA attenuation of iNOS was significantly impeded by the adenylate cyclase inhibitor MDL-12,330A, the D(1) antagonist SCH-23390, the beta2 adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI-118,551 and the beta1 adrenergic receptor antagonist atenolol. In conclusion, it appears that DA attenuates iNOS through a D(1), beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptor-linked adenylate cyclase-mediated cAMP cascade.", 
    "138": "Using Cyclosporin A (CsA) as an unconditioned stimulus has previously demonstrated that behaviorally conditioned inhibition of splenocyte proliferation and cytokine production is mediated via the splenic nerve. Therefore, we currently examined the adrenergic modulation of conditioned suppression of splenocyte function. Chemical sympathectomy via 6-OHDA completely blocked the conditioned suppression of splenocyte proliferation to mitogens and cytokine (IL-2, IFN-gamma) production. Furthermore, administration of beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol abrogated the conditioned effect on splenocyte proliferation. Supporting the position that conditioning is beta-adrenergic-dependent, addition of beta-adrenoceptor agonist, but not alpha-adrenoceptor agonists, to splenocytes in vitro mimicked the conditioned suppression of splenocyte functions, with these effects blocked by propranolol. Therefore, these data indicate that behavioral conditioning of splenocyte function in the rat is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system, predominantly via beta-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "139": "In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of the topical beta-adrenoceptor antagonist Betoptic((R)) (0.25% betaxolol) in the rat retina following the ischemic injury induced by a transient increase of intraocular pressure (IOP). Like other areas of the central nervous system, the retina is highly vulnerable to ischemic-induced injury. Ischemia was induced in the rat retina by raising the IOP above the systolic blood pressure for 60min. After an ischemia/reperfusion, the thickness of the retinal layers and the immunoreactivities of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were examined. After a reperfusion period of 7 days, the thickness of both the inner plexiform layer and inner nuclear layer was much decreased. After a reperfusion period of 14-28 days, the thickness of the outer nuclear layer decreased markedly. Moreover, the ChAT and TH immunoreactivity had almost completely disappeared in the retinas after 7 days, while GABA immunoreactivity remained for 28 days. These results suggest that the inner retinal layers are more susceptible to ischemic-induced injury than the outer retinal layer.Histological examination demonstrated protective effects of betaxolol on ischemic-induced retinal damage, which was more substantial in the inner retinal layer. When two drops of betaxolol, once before ischemic injury and twice daily for 28 days after ischemia, were continuously administered, the reductions in the retinal ChAT, GABA and TH immunoreactivities were significantly attenuated. The present study suggests that topically applied betaxolol is an efficient neuroprotective agent and prevents the retinal cell damage induced by ischemic injury in rats.", 
    "140": "Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury may be reduced by beta-blockade. However, how myocardial salvage is affected when beta-blockade is limited to the reperfusion period is unknown. We investigated the impact of CPB and esmolol during reperfusion on infarct size and left ventricular function in two different experimental models of acute myocardial ischemia.", 
    "141": "In open-chest dogs, myocardial ischemia was induced by LAD occlusion in both studies. In study 1, infarct size (TTZ stain) and myocardial water content (MWC, microgravimetry) were determined, comparing reperfusion with blood and esmolol to blood without additives. Study 2 investigated the impact of esmolol on LV function (sonomicrometry, echocardiography) and MWC (microgravimetry) compared to warm blood cardioplegia in a more clinically oriented model.", 
    "142": "Infarct size and MWC in reperfused myocardium were significantly reduced by esmolol during reperfusion. Global LV function was better preserved in the esmolol group, whereas no difference was seen regarding regional function.",

    "144": "The most important advance in heart failure during the past decade has been the recognition that medications inhibiting neurohormonal activation relieve symptoms, reduce hospitalizations, and prolong survival in patients with heart failure from left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Recent trials with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, aldosterone antagonists, and beta blockers have provided valuable information regarding the uses, dosing, and extent of therapeutic benefits of neurohormonal inhibition.", 
    "145": "Great strides have been made in the understanding of unstable angina and its relationship to the acute coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction during the last decade of the 20th century, Detailed information about ECG changes and serum cardiac markers, as well as the conclusions drawn from numerous large, randomized interventional trials can now be integrated into the traditional clinical picture. Clinicians can now classify patients into diagnostic and prognostic categories and can perform risk stratification with unprecedented precision. With this information, the decision to hospitalize patients and the selection of noninvasive or invasive evaluation and management strategies can be individualized for optimal outcomes.", 
    "146": "The regulation of a K(+) current activating during oscillatory electrical activity (I(K,slow)) in an insulin-releasing beta-cell was studied by applying the perforated patch whole-cell technique to intact mouse pancreatic islets. The resting whole-cell conductance in the presence of 10 mM glucose amounted to 1.3 nS, which rose by 50 % during a series of 26 simulated action potentials. Application of the K(ATP)-channel blocker tolbutamide produced uninterrupted action potential firing and reduced I(K,slow) by approximately 50 %. Increasing glucose from 15 to 30 mM, which likewise converted oscillatory electrical activity into continuous action potential firing, reduced I(K,slow) by approximately 30 % whilst not affecting the resting conductance. Action potential firing may culminate in opening of K(ATP) channels by activation of ATP-dependent Ca(2+) pumping as suggested by the observation that the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin (4 microM) inhibited I(K,slow) by 25 % and abolished bursting electrical activity. We conclude that oscillatory glucose-induced electrical activity in the beta-cell involves the opening of K(ATP)-channel activity and that these channels, in addition to constituting the glucose-regulated K(+) conductance, also play a role in the graded response to supra-threshold glucose concentrations.", 
    "147": "Although recent Food and Drug Administration warnings have noted proarrhythmic effects of droperidol, other antiemetic drugs may have similar effects. We report a case of cardiac arrest after uncomplicated regional anesthesia in a patient with scleroderma who received labetalol and metoclopramide after surgery. Metoclopramide should be used with caution when risk factors for dysrhythmia are present.", 
    "148": "We analyzed a local database including 468 consecutive patients who underwent elective aortic abdominal surgery over an 8-yr period in a single institution. A new cardioprotective perioperative protocol was introduced in January 1997, and we questioned whether perioperative cardiac outcome could be favorably influenced by the application of a stepwise cardiovascular evaluation based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines and by the use of antiadrenergic drugs. Clonidine was administered during surgery, and beta-blockers were titrated after surgery to achieve heart rates less than 80 bpm. We compared data of two consecutive 4-yr periods (1993-1996 [control period] versus 1997-2000 [intervention period]). Implementation of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines was associated with increased preoperative myocardial scanning (44.3% vs 20.6%; P < 0.05) and coronary revascularization (7.7% vs 0.8%; P < 0.05). During the intervention period, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of cardiac complications (from 11.3% to 4.5%) and an increase in event-free survival at 1 yr after surgery (from 91.3% to 98.2%). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the combined administration of clonidine and beta-blockers was associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular events (odds ratio, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.8), whereas major bleeding, renal insufficiency, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were predictive of cardiac complications. In conclusion, cardiac testing was helpful to identify a small subset of high-risk patients who might benefit from coronary revascularization. Sequential and selective antiadrenergic treatments were associated with improved postoperative cardiac outcome.",

    "150": "Avoidance of tachycardia is a commonly described goal for anesthetic management during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. However, an association between increased intraoperative heart rate and mortality has not been described. We conducted an observational study to evaluate the association between preinduction heart rate (heart rate upon arrival to the operating room) and in-hospital mortality during CABG surgery. Data were collected on 5934 CABG patients. Fifteen percent of patients had an increased preinduction heart rate > or =80 bpm. Crude mortality was significantly more frequent among patients with increased preinduction heart rate (P(trend) = 0.002). After adjustment for baseline differences among patients, preinduction heart rate > or =80 bpm remained associated with increased mortality (P(trend) < 0.001). The increased heart rate may be a cause of the observed mortality. Alternatively, faster heart rate may be either a marker of patients with irreversible myocardial damage, or a marker of patients with limited cardiac reserve at risk for further injury. Lastly, faster heart rate may be a marker for under-use of beta-adrenergic blockade. Because the use of preoperative beta-adrenergic blockade in CABG patients is associated with improved in-hospital survival, further investigation concerning the effect of intraoperative treatment of increased heart rate with beta-adrenergic blockers on mortality after CABG surgery is warranted.",

    "152": "The aim of our study was to evaluate endothelium-dependent dilatation induced by an ACE-inhibitor, calcium antagonist and beta blocker in patients suffering from heart failure (NYHA class II and III). We studied 34 patients (19M, 15F, mean age 76.96+/-8.82) in pharmacological wash-out for at least one week, divided into 3 groups: Group A (15 patients, 9M and 6F) taking ramipril (5 mg/die); Group B (10 patients, 6M and 4F) taking amlodipine (10 mg/die), Group C: (9 patients, 4M and 5F) taking carvedilole (25 mg/die). The groups were homologous for NYHA class and instrumental echographic parameters (mean EF=22.5+/-6.7 and mean sAPP 38.4+/-8.7). At the beginning and after 3 weeks of therapy, we performed a clinical and instrumental assessment; we studied endothelial function by determination of L-arginine and L-citrulline (amino acids of the nitric oxide metabolic pathway), the L-citrulline/L-arginine ratio (an index of NOS activity) and VCAM-1 (endothelial dysfunction index); haemorheological parameters (blood viscosity, plasma fibrinogen and erythrocyte morphology); coagulative/fibrinolytic parameters (PT, aPTT, fibrinogen and PAI-1). The results show that L-citrulline and L-arginine increase, while VCAM-1 decreases. The L-citrulline/L-arginine ratio increases in a statistically significant way. This trend is maintained in each group. These results demonstrate that the drugs used induce an improvement of endothelium-dependent dilatation. In addition, there is progressive haemorheological and fibrinolytic improvement, with a reduction of PAI-1 and blood viscosity.", 
    "153": "Beta-adrenergic agonists enhance behavioural and electroencephalographic arousal reactions.

After loss of consciousness, and before administration of vecuronium 0.1 mg kg(-1), a tourniquet was applied to one arm and inflated to 150 mm Hg greater than systolic pressure. Eleven minutes after the TCI began, the trachea was intubated; gross movement within the first min after orotracheal intubation was recorded. BIS was recorded at 10-s intervals. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate were measured non-invasively every min.",

BIS increased significantly after orotracheal intubation (compared with the pre-laryngoscopy values) in the control group only, with a maximum increase of 40 (SD 18)% vs 8 (11)% in the esmolol group (P<0.01). Maximum changes in heart rate [45 (19)% vs 23 (14)%] and MAP [62 (24)% vs 45 (23)%] with orotracheal intubation were also significantly greater in the control group than in the esmolol group.

Additionally, in CABG re-operation aortic crossclamp may necessitate extensive dissection of fibrous adhesions which may intensify the potential risk of injury to the aorta, pulmonary artery or patent bypass grafts. Therefore, it appears to be advantageous in patients undergoing re-do CABG or with aortic calcification to minimize surgical manipulation of the aorta by abandonment of aortic crossclamp. Adequate myocardial protection and convenient surgical exposure without aortic crossclamp max be achieved by intraaortic administration of the short acting ss-blocker esmolol.",
