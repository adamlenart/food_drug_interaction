    "0": "The purpose of this study was to delineate the distribution of beta-adrenoceptor density in the cat heart, with an emphasis on areas within the left ventricle. beta-Adrenoceptor densities, determined for hearts obtained from five cats, were not significantly different in the left and rights atria, i.e. 47.6 +/- 7.2 and 32.8 +/- 7.5 fmol/mg protein, respectively. beta-Adrenoceptor densities for the septum and right ventricle were 105.4 +/- 15.0 and 65.0 +/- 14.0 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The beta-adrenoceptor density for the proximal distribution of the left anterior descending artery LV1, distal distribution of the left anterior descending artery LV2 and posterior wall of the left ventricle LV3 were: 81.3 +/- 11.5, 145.1 +/- 20.8 and 165.4 +/- 35.8 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Thus, the distribution of the beta-adrenoceptor densities was greatest in the apex of the left ventricle. The data suggest that there are regional differences in the beta-adrenoceptor densities among the areas of the heart and within the left ventricle. These differences may be related to functional differences.",

Competition experiments, using rat neocortical and cerebellar membranes, yielded two dissimilar concentration-effect curves. A distinct biphasic curve was evident for neocortex, with a plateau at 100 nM CGP 20712 A (60% [3H]DHA displacement). This plateau indicated a differentiation between beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors; the ratio of IC50-beta 2 to IC50-beta 1 was approximately 10,000. In contrast, only a monophasic curve was obtained for cerebellum. CGP 20712 A is a useful tool for estimating percentages of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in a given tissue.", 
    "2": "The data are reported on a double blind clinical experiment using indenolol on a group of asthmatic hypertensives. The drug revealed a satisfactory anti-hypertensive action in the absence of any significantly bronchoconstrictive effect. The orciprenaline test performed at the end of the experiment showed that the drug does not reduce the availability of beta 2 bronchial receptors vis-\u00e0-vis the beta 2 stimulants.", 
    "3": "Important differences in binding characteristics between agonists and antagonists of the beta-adrenergic receptor have been described. However, these observations have been complicated since most available antagonists are much more lipophilic than agonists. In order to separate out those binding characteristics of agonist vs. antagonist from those characteristics of lipophilic vs. hydrophilic ligands, we have studied competition of the hydrophilic ligands isoproterenol (agonist) and CGP-12177 (antagonist) with [125I]iodopindolol binding in intact human lymphocytes. Analyzing competition curves from assays performed at 13 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C we demonstrated that at lower temperatures there was a decrease in IC50 for isoproterenol but not for CGP-12177. Using cells preincubated with isoproterenol then extensively washed, competition curves with both isoproterenol and CGP-12177 were biphasic, and characterized by the appearance of a population of receptors with a low affinity for both hydrophilic ligands. Furthermore, at lower temperatures the biphasic nature of these curves was accentuated and was characterized by a 6-fold and 40-fold increase in the apparent KD of a population of low affinity sites for isoproterenol and CGP-12177, respectively.", 
    "4": "The kinetics of covalent labeling of the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta chains of the acetylcholine receptor (AcChR) from Torpedo marmorata by the noncompetitive blocker [3H]chlorpromazine ([3H]CPZ) are investigated by using rapid mixing photolabeling techniques. In an initial study [Heidmann, T., & Changeux, J. P. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 1897-1901], it was shown that the rate of [3H]CPZ labeling increases 100-1000-fold upon simultaneous addition of nicotinic agonists to the AcChR and that prior addition of these agonists abolishes the effect. The data were interpreted in terms of the rapid labeling of the transient active state of the AcChR where the ion channel is in its open configuration. This interpretation was recently challenged [Cox, R. N., Kaldany, R. R. J., Di Paola, M., & Karlin, A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7186-7193] on the ground of studies with a different noncompetitive blocker, [3H]quinacrine azide, and the suggestion was made that this compound labels the rapidly desensitized closed channel conformation of the AcChR. In this paper it is shown that the rate of rapid labeling of the AcChR by [3H]CPZ decreases to negligible values upon exposure of the AcChR to nicotinic agonists, in the 100-500-ms time range. The absolute values of the rate constants of this decrease (10-15 s-1 for saturating concentrations of acetylcholine and carbamoylcholine) and their variation with agonist concentration (apparent dissociation constants of 40 microM and 0.4 mM for acetylcholine and carbamoylcholine, respectively) are those expected for the rapid desensitization of the AcChR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "The peripheral effects of nicotine on gastric functions were examined in anesthetized rats. The intravenous infusion of nicotine inhibited the increase in vagally stimulated gastric acid output. This inhibitory effect was abolished by phentolamine or by a combined treatment with bilateral adrenalectomy and reserpine. Nicotine had a dual effect on the gastric mucosal blood flow (MBF): inhibition followed by an increase. The inhibitory effect was abolished by phentolamine or by the combination with reserpine and adrenalectomy. Propranolol or adrenalectomy abolished the increase. These various effects of nicotine on the gastric acid output and MBF were not attenuated by bilateral splanchnicectomy. These results suggest that nicotine acts directly on both the adrenal medulla and postganglionic sympathetic neurons in the gastric wall, namely by acting on alpha-adrenoceptors, thus decreasing acid output and MBF, and by activating beta-adrenoceptors thus slightly increasing MBF.", 
    "6": "The pharmacological properties of the alpha-adrenoceptors which increase cyclic AMP accumulation were studied in slices of rat cerebral cortex after inactivation of beta-adrenoceptors with bromoacetylalprenololmenthane. Norepinephrine increased basal cyclic AMP accumulation 2-fold, and potentiated the effect of adenosine 5-fold. The Ki and EC50 values for antagonists and agonists for both the basal and potentiated responses were generally similar to those for alpha 1-adrenoceptor-stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation in the same preparation. However, significant differences in the potencies of all agonists, and the antagonists phentolamine and BE2254 were observed between the basal and potentiated cyclic AMP responses. The differences in agonist potencies did not appear to be due to the existence of a receptor reserve. Norepinephrine, epinephrine, alpha-methylnorepinephrine and 6-fluoronorepinephrine were full agonists, while methoxamine and phenylephrine were partial agonists in both systems. The results suggest that norepinephrine increases cyclic AMP accumulation in rat cerebral cortex through alpha 1-adrenoceptors similar to those increasing phosphatidylinositol metabolism in the same tissue.", 
    "7": "A 44-year-old obese female patient ingested 200 mg diazepam and 1000 mg atenolol with suicidal intent. On admission to the clinic 24 hours later she was in deep coma, with a body temperature of 28.9 degrees C. The blood level of atenolol was 250 mg/l (therapeutic range 0.2-0.5 mg/l); this is the highest level yet recorded. She was treated with gastric lavage, instillation of charcoal and with orciprenaline, dopamine and dobutamine. She survived the poisoning without any untoward sequelae.", 
    "8": "We studied the effects of propranolol on degradation of cardiac structural proteins resulting from ischemia induced by 24 h ligation of the coronary artery in dogs. Degradation of myocardial myosin heavy chain, alpha-actinin and troponin-I was used as an indicator of degradation of cardiac structural proteins. In dogs with left circumflex coronary artery ligation, propranolol, given orally in the dose of 10 or 30 mg/kg, significantly reduced degradation of cardiac structural proteins. This can be supported by the facts that treatment with propranolol, 10 or 30 mg/kg, reduced release of cathepsins B, L and D from lysosome to cytosol in the ischemic tissue and that the reduced acidity of the ischemic tissue was improved by treatment with propranolol, 30 mg/kg. In conclusion, propranlol delays the necrotic development of the severely ischemic myocardial tissue as shown by reduced protein degradation.", 
    "9": "The electrophysiological effects of antiarrhythmic drugs were tested in 36 patients with recurrent paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), 25 of whom had accessory pathway reentrant tachycardia (APRT) and 11 A-V nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT; 10 of the slow-fast type one of the fast-slow type). The test drugs were procainamide (used in 19 patients), verapamil (in 27), disopyramide (in 31), and propranolol (in 15). The drugs were tested for their ability to terminate episodes of PSVT as well as to inhibit their induction. Procainamide had an inhibitory effect on APRT in nine of 12 patients (75%) and terminated episodes of APRT in seven of 11 patients (63.6%); in all of them V-A block was responsible for the termination. In four of six patients (66.7%) with slow-fast AVNRT and in one patient with fast-slow AVNRT, inhibition of the induction of tachycardia attacks was noted after procainamide. Termination of AVNRT was seen in the same number of patients. Verapamil inhibited the induction of APRT in 12 of 18 patients (66.7%) and terminated episodes of APRT in 10 of 16 patients (62.5%), all by A-V block. In six of eight patients (75%) with slow-fast AVNRT, inhibition of the induction as well as termination of tachycardia were noted after verapamil. Disopyramide had an inhibitory effect on APRT in seven of 23 patients (30.4%) and terminated APRT in five of 21 patients (23.8%) by V-A block, while AVNRT (all slow-fast type) was terminated in only one of eight patients (12.5%) by disopyramide. Disopyramide was less effective than previously reported. This could be attributed to a relatively low dosage and slow infusion speed. Propranolol inhibited the induction of APRT and terminated episodes of APRT in only one of 10 patients (10%). In two of four patients (50%) with slow-fast AVNRT, an inhibitory effect by propranolol was noted, but termination was seen in only one patients.", 
    "10": "Patterns of red blood cell hemostasis and microcirculation changes are analysed in 115 chronic coronary patients in the course of purposeful medication and at extracorporeal carbohemoperfusion. Differences in the mechanisms of action of trental, phosphaden and essentiale are identified by means of television capillaroscopy, termography, scanning electron microscopy; the mechanism of the antianginal effect of extracorporeal carbohemoperfusion is specified. A considerable disaggregating effect associated with trental and phosphaden, as well as an essentiale-associated improvement in red blood cell morphology and membrane permeability were demonstrated. Extracorporeal carbohemoperfusion is followed by an improvement of red blood cell hemostasis and microcirculation characteristics and a decrease in plasma lipoproteins.", 
    "11": "In the anesthetized open-chest guinea pig, ibopamine (10-300 micrograms/kg, i.v.), epinine (10-100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) and dopamine (10-300 micrograms/kg, i.v.) produced dose-related increases in heart rate (prevented by 20 micrograms/kg pindolol, i.v.), left ventricular dP/dt max and aortic flow. Ibopamine produced pressor effects (prevented by 0.5 mg/kg phentolamine, i.v.), while dopamine produced a slight depressor effect. A biphasic response (the pressor phase followed by a depressor) was observed after epinine, although the depressor phase was not significant. Calculated total peripheral resistance (TPR) tended to be increased after ibopamine and epinine (initial phase), while it was decreased after dopamine. Pindolol potentiated the increase in TPR produced by ibopamine and epinine, while the increase in TPR was converted to the decrease after phentolamine. Decreases in TPR produced by epinine and the highest dose of dopamine were inhibited by pindolol. In the isolated guinea pig atria, ibopamine (10(-6)-10(-4) M) increased the atrial rate and the developed tension in a concentration-related manner. The positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of ibopamine were of the same order as those of epinine.", 
    "12": "The new calcium antagonist felodipine has been compared with minoxidil in the management of severe hypertension in a group of 17 men. Satisfactory control of blood pressure was achieved in all patients with a combination of beta blocker, loop diuretic and minoxidil after inadequate control on a standard regimen of beta blocker, thiazide and vasodilator. The optimal dose of felodipine was titrated after a placebo phase. In a double blind crossover trial blood pressure on felodipine (150/88 +/- 19/8 mmHg, SD) was the same as on minoxidil (148/87 +/- 23/11 mmHg, NS) and the postural difference was similar (NS) on both drug regimens. Body weight was lower on the felodipine regimen (P less than 0.01), as was supine heart rate (P less than 0.05). There was a small rise in plasma liver enzymes on felodipine therapy (P less than 0.01). Felodipine was well tolerated and may be useful in the management of severe hypertension.", 
    "13": "To compare the antihypertensive effects of beta-blockers and diuretics on the blood pressure increase to stress, a randomized single-blind crossover study was performed in 27 patients with mild or moderate hypertension. At the initial examination and after two subsequent periods of therapy with 100 mg atenolol or with a combination of 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 5 mg amiloride hydrochloride, once a day, blood pressure and heart rate were measured at rest, during mental arithmetic, sustained handgrip and cycloergometric test. Both treatment significantly decreased supine and standing systolic and diastolic pressure at rest, during and immediately after mental stress and isometric exercise, with the reduction of diastolic pressure significantly greater after atenolol. During dynamic exercise, systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly decreased by diuretics at the lowest work-load only, whereas beta-blocker caused significant and greater blood pressure reductions throughout the exercise. The combination of two classes of drug normalized resting blood pressure in 8 of 9 subjects in which the monotherapy had failed to obtain values less than 140/90 mmHg and gave a better control of systolic and diastolic pressures throughout all the stress tests. It is concluded that atenolol is more effective than diuretics during stress, suggesting that beta-blocking drugs are the first choice treatment for mild to moderate hypertension and that when the antihypertensive effect of a single agent is insufficient, a combination of beta-blockers and diuretics is also effective during stress.", 
    "14": "Catecholamines stimulate adenosine triphosphate consumption and glycogenolysis in isolated hearts. In ischaemic myocardium a protective effect of beta adrenergic blockade may therefore arise from reduced adenosine triphosphate consumption or attenuation of acidosis. To characterise the biochemical mechanism of this protective effect phosphorus metabolite concentrations and intracellular pH were measured in an ischaemic region of the rabbit heart in vivo using 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery there was a rapid decrease in intracellular phosphocreatine concentrations, and intracellular adenosine triphosphate concentrations decreased at a rate of approximately 0.5 mumol X g-1 dry weight X min-1. Intracellular pH decreased approximately linearly to a final pH of about 5.8. In the ischaemic myocardium of the animals treated with propranolol the intracellular concentrations of adenosine triphosphate were higher and those of phosphocreatine lower and the pH was the same compared with control after 30 minutes of ischaemia. Thus any protective effect of propranolol in vivo is not associated with attenuation of intracellular acidosis in this preparation.", 
    "15": "Studies of airway glands indicate a muscarinic cholinergic regulation of secretion. Because of the cellular complexity of the airways, receptor characterization in whole tissue is unfeasible. Therefore, we utilized homogenates of disaggregated gland cells isolated from cat trachea and the muscarinic antagonist [1-3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) to characterize glandular muscarinic receptors. Receptors of isolated cells were functionally intact as assessed by carbachol (10(-4) M) stimulation of O2 consumption 86 +/- 6% (+/- SE, n = 20). Stimulation was dose dependent (mean effective concentration = 3.5 microM), inhibited by atropine [dissociation constant (KD) = 4.2 nM] but not phentolamine nor propranolol. Specific binding of [3H]QNB to cell homogenates was saturable, of high affinity (KD = 36 pM) and to a single population of receptors. Maximum binding was 58 fmol/10(6) cells or about 35,000 receptors per cell. Estimated affinities for muscarinic agents were in the micromolar range for agonists and nanomolar range for antagonists. Histamine, alpha-adrenergic, and beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists did not inhibit specific binding. These results suggest that muscarinic receptors on tracheal gland cells are of high affinity and density.", 
    "16": "There is increasing evidence in many species that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may be a neurotransmitter in nonadrenergic inhibitory nerves. We have studied the effect of electrical field stimulation (EFS), exogenous VIP, and isoproterenol (Iso) on human airways in vitro. We have also studied a related peptide, peptide histidine methionine (PHM), which coexists with VIP in human airway nerves, and in separate experiments studied fragments of the VIP amino acid sequence (VIP1-10 and VIP16-28) for agonist and antagonist activity. Human airways were obtained at thoracotomy and studied in an organ bath. In bronchi EFS gave an inhibitory response that was unaltered by 10(-6) M propranolol but was blocked by tetrodotoxin, whereas in bronchioles there was little or no nonadrenergic inhibitory response. VIP, PHM, and Iso all caused dose-dependent relaxation of bronchi, VIP and PHM being approximately 50-fold more potent than Iso. VIP, but not Iso, mimicked the time course of nonadrenergic inhibitory nerve stimulation. In contrast bronchioles relaxed to Iso but not to VIP or PHM. Neither propranolol nor indomethacin altered the relaxant effects of VIP or PHM, suggesting a direct effect of these peptides on airway smooth muscle. Neither of the VIP fragments showed either agonist or antagonist activity. We conclude that VIP and PHM are more potent bronchodilators of human bronchi than Iso and that the association between the relaxant effects of these peptides and nonadrenergic inhibitory responses suggests that they may be possible neurotransmitters of nonadrenergic inhibitory nerves in human airways.", 
    "17": "To assess the efficacy and tolerability of two doses of chlorthalidone (CHL) and slow-release (SR) metoprolol (MET) given in fixed combination (standard dose: CHL 25 mg and MET 200 mg; lower dose: CHL 12.5 mg and MET 100 mg), a multicenter (5 Centers), double-blind, between-patients study was planned. Seventy-three mild to moderate hypertensive patients, 45 males and 28 females, aged 25-68 years (mean 51.4), at WHO stage I or II, were enrolled into the study. After a 2-week placebo wash-out period, eligible patients were randomly given either of the two drugs for six weeks: 33 were given the standard dose and 40 the lower one. Every 2 weeks, in the morning and 24 h after-dosing lying and standing systolic (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded at rest. At the end of the placebo period and at the end of the study 24 h after-dosing a sub-maximal bicycle ergometer exercise test was performed. In comparison with placebo, both doses induced a significance decrease (p less than 0.01) in lying and standing SBP, DBP and HR, as well as in peak-exercise SBP, HR and pressure-rate product. Furthermore, a significant difference (p less than 0.05) of the higher dose versus the lower one was also observed at the end of the study in the above-mentioned parameters except for SBP at rest and at peak exercise and standing HR at rest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "The authors performed a long-term, double-blind, crossover study on the effect of two drugs (propranolol, 40 mg t.i.d. or diltiazem, 60 mg t.i.d., each administered for 2 months) on their exercise tolerance in 13 patients with stable angina (mean age 52 +/- 7 years, 9 males and 4 females), after exertion and documented significant (greater than or equal to 70%) obstructive coronary lesions at angiography. Only propranolol, by decreasing heart rate and rate-pressure product, improved maximal sustained work load and duration of exercise (measured by a bicycle ergometer) versus the placebo (p less than 0.05). In both cases, however, they did not find any significant difference between propranolol and diltiazem. ST segment depression was decreased by both drugs (-1.73 +/- 0.95, baseline, vs -0.94 +/- 1.01, propranolol, and -0.95 +/- 0.76, diltiazem, p less than 0.5, for both). Long-term management of stable angina on effort therefore, can be usefully performed using propranolol or diltiazem.", 
    "19": "The effect of thyroid hormones on the reduction in resting metabolic rate by the beta-blocker propranolol has been investigated in young pigs. Oxygen consumption was measured 12 to 20 hr after the last meal in euthyroid and hypothyroid animals on a high or low level of energy intake. The increase in resting metabolic rate in animals on the high energy intake was reduced by propranolol in the euthyroid controls but not in those animals made hypothyroid by methimazole. Thus at least part of the action of propranolol to decrease diet-induced thermogenesis depends on its interaction with thyroid hormones.", 
    "20": "The extrinsically denervated and vascularly perfused stomach of the hyperthyroid rat exhibits an increased basal gastrin release and an exaggerated response to stimulation with the b-agonist isoproterenol. The b-blocker propranolol does not inhibit the increased basal release of gastrin, but completely blocks the effect of isoproterenol. Vagal stimulation is not different between hyperthyroid and euthyroid rats. We conclude, that there are two mechanisms which are responsible for the increased release of gastrin in hyperthyroidism: firstly a direct effect of thyroid hormones on gastrin cells, and secondly an increase in sensitivity of gastrin cells towards b-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "21": "Systemic and splanchnic haemodynamics were studied in patients with cirrhosis who had been classified in three groups (A, B, and C) according to the degree of liver failure (modified Pugh's classification). In patients of group A, cardiac index was significantly lower than that of group C and systemic vascular resistance was higher, but not significantly so, than that of patients with liver failure. Wedged hepatic venous pressure was significantly lower in the former group than in the latter. In patients in group B, corresponding values fell between those of groups A and C. Azygos blood flow averaged 0.477 +/- 0.242 l/min (mean +/- SD) in group A and it was significantly lower than in groups B and C (0.642 +/- 0.224 and 1.061 +/- 0.476 l/min, respectively). In the three groups, acute administration of propranolol induced statistically significant changes in systemic and splanchnic haemodynamics. In patients of group C but not of group B, the mean value of azygos blood flow after propranolol remained significantly higher than in group A. Moreover, the fraction of azygos blood flow to cardiac output decreased in groups A and B while slightly increased in group C. This study shows that in patients with cirrhosis, the degree of liver failure may be a determinant for the haemodynamic responses to drugs acting on portal hypertension.", 
    "22": "The arrhythmogenic dose of epinephrine (ADE) was determined in 6 pigs during steady-state anesthesia (1.5% halothane in O2) and steady-state anesthesia plus xylazine (1.1 mg X kg-1 X hr-1; IV infusion) and after either prazosin (alpha 1) or metoprolol (beta 1) adrenergic blockade during halothane-xylazine (H-X) anesthesia. A constant infusion (1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) of freshly mixed epinephrine (100 micrograms X ml-1 in saline solution) was used to determine ADE. The ADE was defined as the total dose of epinephrine which produced 4 or more continuous or intermittent, premature, ventricular contractions within a 15-s period. The mean epinephrine total dose values during 1.5% halothane anesthesia, H-X anesthesia alone, or H-X anesthesia after either prazosin (0.1 mg X kg-1) or metoprolol (0.5 mg X kg-1) adrenergic blockade were 3.60 +/- 0.844, 2.68 +/- 0.402, 11.85 +/- 3.804, and 5.17 +/- 0.587 micrograms X kg-1, respectively. Xylazine administration did not significantly decrease ADE, although mean arterial pressure significantly increased. Prazosin administration significantly increased ADE and was associated with an increased heart rate and a decreased mean arterial pressure. We conclude that alpha 1-blockade with prazosin is more protective to epinephrine-induced arrhythmias in H-X-anesthetized pigs than is beta 1-blockade with metoprolol.", 
    "23": "Thirteen adults with temper outbursts and residual attention deficit disorder (ADD) were given propranolol to 640 mg/day in an open study. Eleven of the patients improved, with improvement in temper and other symptoms of ADD, indicating a need for controlled studies. This suggests a novel pharmacological approach to residual ADD.", 
    "24": "Bovine tracheal submucosal gland cells have been isolated by enzymatic digestion and serially propagated in tissue culture for more than 12 mo. (40 passages). The cells exhibit an epithelioid appearance at confluence and contain alcian blue (pH 2.5)/periodic acid-Schiff-positive material within cytoplasmic granules. By electron microscopy numerous osmiophilic secretory granules are seen. Maximal growth is observed when the cells are grown on human placental collagen-coated culture vessels in medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. Scintillation spectrometry revealed that radiolabeled precursor (35SO4) was incorporated into high molecular weight molecules and released from cells. Isoproterenol (10(-6) to 10(-3) M) stimulated the release of 35SO4. The maximal response to isoproterenol was completely inhibited by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. It is concluded that the cultured cells retain features of tracheal gland cells and may serve as a useful model of synthesis and secretion of macromolecules by tracheal gland cells.", 
    "25": "As part of a pilot study to assess the efficacy of propranolol in the treatment of aggression in psychiatric patients, drug interactions of propranolol with other agents were estimated by blood level monitoring. In the two patients taking a standard oral dose of thioridazine, the addition of propranolol caused a threefold and fivefold increase of plasma thioridazine levels, which placed them in a potentially toxic range. Although neither patient exhibited a toxic effect, these levels may be associated with an increased risk of thioridazine-induced irreversible pigmentary retinopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, and tardive dyskinesia. The authors suggest precautionary monitoring of thioridazine plasma and other relevant levels and clinical assessments when thioridazine and propranolol are used in combination.", 
    "26": "We evaluated the efficacy of single oral dose combining 20 mg pindolol and 120 mg verapamil in termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in 12 patients with recurrent symptomatic tachycardia. All had electrically inducible SVT lasting longer than 30 minutes. Patients were administered placebo or crushed pindolol and verapamil on 2 consecutive days after tachycardia was electrically induced and allowed to sustain for 30 minutes. With placebo, SVT lasted 186 +/- 18 minutes (mean +/- SEM); five patients converted spontaneously within 121 to 180 minutes. With pindolol and verapamil, 9 of 12 patients (responders) converted to sinus rhythm within 8 to 74 minutes. The mean duration of SVT in the nine responders was 28 +/- 8 minutes compared with 168 +/- 20 minutes on placebo (p less than 0.001). Before termination, tachycardia rate on pindolol and verapamil slowed significantly from 182 +/- 5 to 164 +/- 7/min (p less than 0.05) compared with no significant change in the rate of SVT on placebo. The mean systolic blood pressure during tachycardia was 97 +/- 5 mm Hg with placebo and 101 +/- 7 mm Hg with pindolol and verapamil. Serum levels of pindolol and verapamil obtained in seven patients at time of spontaneous termination of tachycardia were 66 +/- 13 and 56 +/- 14 ng/ml, respectively. The side effects with pindolol and verapamil included lightheadedness in one patient and symptoms of rapid palpitations in three. A single oral dose of pindolol and verapamil is safe and effective in termination of acute paroxysmal SVT and may be the initial therapy of choice in selected patients.", 
    "27": "Migraine headaches may be confused with other types of headache, namely, those caused by tension and by organic disorders, but several features often set them apart. For one, migraines are often accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting. Also, they often are present in the family history. Treatment can involve such methods as biofeedback, diet, and limitation of exercise, and a number of medications are available for both treatment and prophylaxis. Studies of drug treatment of childhood migraine are few, so clinicians must tailor treatment to the individual case, watching for side effects and limiting the duration of treatment as much as possible.", 
    "28": "A new metabolic pathway of terminal hydroxylation (omega-hydroxylation) of the N-isopropyl group of propranolol (1) was established. Selected ion-monitoring GC-MS analysis, based on use of the synthesized mixture of diastereoisomers of 1-(1-hydroxy-2-propylamino)-3-(1-naphthoxy)-2-propanol (2) as a standard, established formation of both diastereoisomers of 2 as metabolites of 1. These diastereoisomers were formed in unequal amounts when 1, its hexadeuterated analogue 8 or heptadeuterated analogue 9, were incubated in the presence of the rat liver microsomal fraction. Authentic (2R,2\"S)-2, obtained from the amide formed from (2S)-3-(1-naphthoxy)-2-hydroxypropionic acid [(2S)-5] and (2S)-alaninol by diborane reduction, facilitated examination of stereochemical aspects of this process. From incubations of the enantiomers of 1 and pseudoracemic propranolol [equimolar (2R)-propranolol-3,3-d2 and (2S)-propranolol-d0] in the presence of the rat liver microsomal fraction, we established that the diastereomeric products were formed in the order (2S,2\"S)-2 approximately equal to (2S,2\"R)-2 greater than (2R,2\"R)-2 greater than (2R,2\"S)-2. (2S)-1, which was metabolized to 2 to a greater extent than (2R)-1, showed no stereoselectivity, affording about equal amounts of (2S,2\"S)-2 and (2S,2\"R)-2. (2R)-1, which was metabolized to 2 to a lesser extent, afforded considerably more (2R,2\"R)-2 than (2R,2\"S)-2. omega-Hydroxylation was a minor metabolic pathway in the microsomal incubation. About 2000X less 2 than 1-amino-3-(1-naphthoxy)-2-propanol (3), the product of N-dealkylation of 1, was formed.", 
    "29": "Adenylate cyclase activity was measured in ureteral homogenates from guinea pigs of five age groups, ranging from neonates to older adults (retired breeders). Isoproterenol stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity is lost completely in ureters from 90 day and older animals. Forskolin activation also declines rapidly with increasing age; there is a significant (39%) decrease in activation at 30 days when compared to 10-day values with a further decline at 90 days. At 90 days, NaF, GTP and 5'-guanylimido-diphosphate stimulation of adenylate cyclase decreases by only 1, 9 and 23%, respectively, from the 10-day values. Prostaglandin E1 stimulation over 5'-guanylimido-diphosphate control does not decrease with age. 5'-Guanylimido-diphosphate in the presence of ethanol, activates adenylate cyclase to a greater extent in the older animals. These data may suggest that the decreased ability to activate adenylate cyclase with age may be due to a loss of the efficiency of coupling in the more rigid aged membranes. Other explanations include loss of catalytic function with age. The loss of adenylate cyclase activity in aging correlates well with our previously reported study showing that isoproterenol causes a greater decrease in contractility of ureters from younger than from older guinea pigs.", 
    "30": "Programmed ventricular stimulation and ambulatory electrocardiography were performed both before and during oral sotalol therapy in 39 patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmia inducible by programmed stimulation (sustained ventricular tachycardia [n = 31], ventricular fibrillation [n = 3], nonsustained ventricular tachycardia [n = 5]). Oral sotalol was started at 80 mg twice daily and the dose thereafter was then gradually increased until a mean daily dose of 300 mg (range 160-480) was reached. In 12 of 34 patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation the arrhythmia was suppressed; in 19 patients it was not and in 3 the spontaneous arrhythmia recurred. Reproducibly inducible nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was suppressed by sotalol in all five patients with this arrhythmia. Thus, a favorable electrophysiologic response was obtained in 17 (44%) of 39 patients. Arrhythmia suppression correlated with the type of arrhythmia (unsustained or sustained) induced during the control period (p less than 0.05), and nonresponders had a higher incidence of previously ineffective drug trials (p less than 0.05). In 22 patients treated long term with sotalol suppression of arrhythmia inducibility on programmed stimulation predicted freedom from recurrences (16 of 17), whereas continued inducibility indicated drug failure (5 of 5) (p less than 0.005). Serial ambulatory electrocardiograms performed in 37 of the 39 patients did not correlate with the results of electrophysiologic testing. For the patients on long-term treatment, invasive testing was superior to electrocardiographic monitoring in predicting outcome. These data indicate that in daily doses of 160 to 480 mg oral sotalol is a very useful agent in patients presenting with sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, and its efficacy is fairly well predicted by programmed stimulation.", 
    "31": "The relative contribution of the efferent components of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems to the heart rate (HR) response to dynamic physical exercise was evaluated in 23 normal males. The dynamic exercise was performed on a bicycle ergometer at work loads of 25, 50 and 100 W, before and after pharmacological blockade with atropine (13 individuals) or propranolol (10 individuals). Parasympathetic blockade significantly depressed the rapid HR response at the beginning of the exercise period at all levels of intensity, whereas sympathetic blockade only affected the slow-response phase (1-4 min), especially at the highest level of effort. The present results suggest that the tachycardia evoked by dynamic exercise is mediated by a biphasic mechanism initially depending on rapid vagal release, which increases progressively with increasing effort. An increased sympathetic activity manifests itself in a more delayed manner, especially at the higher levels of activity. Continuous monitoring of HR during the entire period of activity at different levels of intensity permits the utilization of dynamic exercise as a simple and non-invasive method for the functional evaluation of the two components of the autonomic nervous system of the heart.", 
    "32": "The disposition of labetalol was assessed in 16 patients on dialysis after intravenous dosing with 0.7 to 1.0 mg/kg during an interdialytic period and just before hemodialysis (n = 8) and during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (n = 8). The plasma concentration time data exhibited triexponential decay in all patients. The terminal t 1/2 of labetalol was 12.90 +/- 4.68 hours, the total body clearance was 1198.2 +/- 249.4 ml/min, and the AUC was 921.4 +/- 175.2 ng hr/ml during the interdialytic period. No significant changes were observed in these parameters after dosing with labetalol just before dialysis. The hemodialysis clearance of labetalol was 30.67 +/- 5.49 ml/min, and only 0.189 +/- 0.042 mg of labetalol was removed by hemodialysis. The terminal t 1/2 averaged 13.05 +/- 6.32 hours during CAPD. Steady-state volume of distribution, total body clearance (Clp), and CAPD clearance were 10.39 +/- 2.77 L/kg, 1397.2 +/- 372.3 ml/min, and 1.94 +/- 0.65 ml/min, respectively. The fraction of the dose recovered in the CAPD dialysate during the 72-hour study period was 0.14% +/- 0.09%. The decay of the antihypertensive effect of labetalol was gradual and paralleled the decline in the log plasma concentration. There was a significant correlation between labetalol plasma concentration and the fall in supine diastolic and mean blood pressure after the interdialytic dose and during CAPD. Although labetalol is removed by dialysis, dialysis does not significantly enhance Clp.", 
    "33": "The influence of a high-protein meal as compared to fasting on the disposition of simultaneous intravenous and oral doses of propranolol, as well as on indocyanine green clearance, was examined in six normal subjects. The intravenous dose (0.1 mg/kg) was unlabeled propranolol and the oral dose (80 mg) was a stereospecifically deuterium-labeled pseudoracemate of propranolol. Systemic clearance of propranolol increased 38%, from 1005 +/- 57 to 1384 +/- 115 ml/min (mean +/- SE; P less than 0.05) as a result of the meal, with no change in t1/2 or apparent volume of distribution. A 12% decrease in oral clearance occurred with the meal but was not statistically significant (3717 +/- 185 ml/min, fasting; 3245 +/- 498 after meal), whereas bioavailability increased 67% (27.2% +/- 1.7% fasting; 45.5% +/- 4.3% after meal; P less than 0.01). Estimated hepatic blood flow, as measured by indocyanine green clearance, rose 34% 60 minutes after the meal (1719 +/- 155 ml/min fasting; 2304 +/- 218 ml/min after meal; P less than 0.02). A difference was observed in the oral clearance of the propranolol enantiomers in the fasting state, but this difference was unaffected by the meal. These alterations in propranolol disposition, as the result of a high-protein meal, are consistent with a transient increase in hepatic blood flow.", 
    "34": "The use of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs has been thought to impair physical performance. To test this statement, 12 patients with mild to moderate hypertension performed a submaximal exercise test during treatment with placebo and after 3 and 24 months of monotherapy with betaxolol, 20 to 40 mg daily. The resting heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced after 3 months of treatment and the reduction was maintained 24 hours after the last dose at the 2-year visit. A 12% to 14% reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia was found, but blood pressure during exercise was reduced only in the patients with mild hypertension. However, in no patient did the working capacity decrease.", 
    "35": "The role of genetic polymorphism in the oxidative metabolism of metoprolol and debrisoquin was investigated in a population of 138 unrelated Nigerians. The debrisoquin/4-hydroxydebrisoquin 0-8 hour urinary ratio (D/HD) correlated significantly with the metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol 0-8 hour urinary ratio (M/HM) (rs = 0.54; P less than 0.001), the metoprolol/H117-04 [4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropoxy)-phenylacetic acid] 0-8 hour urinary ratio (M/H117-04) (rs = 0.42; P less than 0.001), and the plasma metoprolol concentration at 3 hours (rs = 0.48; P less than 0.01). Both the median D/HD and M/HM ratios were significantly higher in this population than in a previously studied population of white British subjects. According to criteria established in studies of white populations, only one subject, later identified as an Indian, would be classified unequivocally as a poor metabolizer of both metoprolol and debrisoquin. All the other subjects were black Africans. Bimodality in the frequency distribution of both the log10 M/HM and D/HD ratios was not apparent. The poor hydroxylation trait may, therefore, be present at a lower frequency than in whites, absent altogether, or obscured by other factors. In ethnic studies of drug metabolism each racial group should be examined separately for evidence of polymorphic metabolism and antimodes should not be extrapolated from one population to another.", 
    "36": "Nifedipine has been used in the management of hypertension in 36 consecutive patients who could not tolerate, or were not controlled by, atenolol and thiazide diuretics. Mean supine blood pressure was reduced from 193/110 +/- 5/2 (SEM) mmHg to 162/91 +/- 5/2 mmHg at eight weeks and remained at that level for the six months of follow-up. Blood pressure reduction at four weeks was not always a predictor of final BP level. Eight patients could not tolerate atenolol, nine patients could not tolerate thiazide diuretics and four patients could not tolerate nifedipine. No significant changes in plasma urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium urate, 'total CO2' or glucose were observed. We conclude that nifedipine is a well-tolerated drug and may be useful after beta-blockers and thiazide have been tried in the management of hypertension.", 
    "37": "Authors observed the mechanical response of the tracheal muscle to electrical stimulation using only one transverse strip preparation of isolated guinea-pig trachea, 4-5 mm in width, which included only one tracheal muscle strip. The effects of various pharmacological agents on these responses were also investigated. A biphasic response which is a contractile response followed by a relaxing response usually appeared when the preparation was stimulated with rectangular pulses (50 volt, 0.5 msec) at 40 Hz for a period of 5 sec. A monophasic contractile response also appeared, only rarely but this response was shifted to the biphasic response as the resting tonus level of the preparation gradually increased in the course of the experiment. When the preparation was stimulated electrically at intervals of 15 min, the resting tonus level of the preparation gradually decreased and it subsequently reached a stable state. Then the amplitude of contractile response and depth of relaxing response in the biphasic response evoked by electrical stimulation of constant condition were, respectively, almost constant, whenever the preparation was stimulated at intervals of 15 min. The amplitude of monophasic contractile response which appeared only rarely was relatively constant to every trial of electrical stimulation throughout the experiment. The amplitude of contractile response and depth of relaxing response in the biphasic response were 283 +/- 65 mg (mean +/- SD, n = 10) and 293 +/- 93 mg (mean +/- SD, n = 10), respectively. The monophasic contractile response was abolished by atropine (5 X 10(-7) g/ml) or tetrodotoxin (2 X 10(-7) g/ml). The contractile response in the biphasic response was abolished by atropine (5 X 10(-7) g/ml). In the presence of atropine (5 X 10(-7) g/ml), therefore, only the relaxing response appeared. This relaxing response was respectively reduced by guanethidine (1 X 10(-5) g/ml-1 X 10(-6) g/ml) and propranolol (1 X 10(-5) g/ml-1 X 10(-6) g/ml), but complete inhibition was never seen. These findings suggest that the excitatory innervation is cholinergic and the inhibitory innervation is both adrenergic and non-adrenergic. In addition, from the results of this work it is clear that the preparation used by the authors are good enough to observe the electrical stimulation-induced response of the preparation.", 
    "38": "Patients with generalized anxiety who have not responded to psychological treatment from their family doctor may require symptomatic drug treatment whilst awaiting specialist therapy. This study indicates that propranolol is effective and relatively safe for this purpose. Atenolol is also effective but has unacceptable cardiovascular effects in anxious patients.", 
    "39": "Thirty-five patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were studied in a randomised controlled trial to determine whether the catecholamine response to myocardial infarction was altered by administration of the beta blocker, sotalol, given within six hours of the onset of chest pain. Myocardial infarction evolved in 30 patients (15 placebo-treated, 15 sotalol-treated) and was associated with markedly increased plasma and urine noradrenaline and adrenaline levels. Intravenously administered sotalol was well tolerated and produced significant acute falls in blood pressure and heart rate. The reduction in heart rate was maintained in the sotalol group with once-daily therapy. Plasma levels of both catecholamines showed slow but very similar falls in the two groups, the decline being evident earlier for adrenaline than for noradrenaline. This was also reflected in the pattern of catecholamine excretion: significant falls in adrenaline but not noradrenaline excretion were seen on day 2 in both groups. Although mean plasma and urinary catecholamine levels tended to be higher in the sotalol group throughout the study, the differences between the sotalol and placebo groups for the changes in plasma or urinary catecholamines with time were not statistically significant. Episodes of ventricular tachycardia occurred in 68% of the patients on day 1 and 27% of patients on day 2. More patients in the sotalol group experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia (sotalol 89% placebo 54%) but this difference was not statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "Experimentally induced hypertensive G-minipigs were used for assessing the antihypertensive effects of acebutolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent. In the acute experiment, six females were used. Acebutolol (3 mg/kg, i.v.) alone or in combination with furosemide (1 mg/kg, i.v.) or hydralazine (1 mg/kg, i.v.) was administered through an implanted catheter. In the chronic experiments, five females received oral acebutolol (100-200 mg/day). The blood pressure, heart rate, plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were used as parameters. In the acute experiment, there were no marked changes in the blood pressure or heart rate during the nondosing period. Acebutolol alone caused a marked decrease in the blood pressure and heart rate. In the two combination tests, combined administration with acebutolol and furosemide had a greater effect on the blood pressure and heart rate than did acebutolol alone. A combined acebutolol and hydralazine regimen caused a slight reduction not only in the blood pressure, but also in the heart rate compared with acebutolol alone. PRA and PAC remained essentially constant, with minor fluctuations, throughout the nondosing period. Following the injection of acebutolol alone, PRA showed an elevation with a significant rise after three hours and PAC showed a tendency to increase. PRA and PAC generally tended to increase in the case of combined administration with furosemide or hydralazine, but these tendencies were less conspicuous than with acebutolol alone. On the other hand, chronic treatment with acebutolol produced a significant decrease in the heart rate from two weeks after the administration and in the blood pressure from four weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "The present study compared the relative efficacy of a behavioral stress-management procedure versus a pharmacologic method (the beta-blocker propranolol) in reducing psychophysiological reactivity in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients. A pretreatment-posttreatment assessment design was used, with 10 patients participating in six separate sessions. The first session involved evaluating psychophysiological reactivity to an emotional stressor (a public-speaking task). The subsequent five sessions involved the administration of the respective treatments, either stress management or drug. The patients were randomly assigned to each treatment group. The public-speaking stressor was readministered after the last treatment session. Results demonstrated that behavioral stress management reduced psychophysiological reactivity to public speaking to the same level seen with propranolol. The findings suggest that this nonpharmacological approach could be of use when beta-blocker therapy is not desired, not practical, or medically contraindicated.", 
    "42": "In 671 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction (MI) and no previous MI, precordial mapping with a grid containing 24 chest leads was performed within a few hours (mean = 4.8 hours; range 0-42 hours) after arrival in hospital and four days later. In 76% of the patients the criteria for definite MI, based on serum enzymes and a 12 lead standard electrocardiogram, were fulfilled. Among patients classified as having no definite MI, 2% had abnormal Q-waves on mapping on the fourth day; among patients classified as having a subendocardial MI (no abnormal Q-waves in the 12 standard leads), 7% had abnormal Q-waves on mapping on the fourth day. In patients who subsequently developed anterior MI, changes in the sum of Q-waves and the sum of R-waves were observed for more than 12 hours after onset of pain. ST-elevations defined from a normal population were seen in the initial recording in 60% of patients with anterior MI. Among those in whom the first recording was performed less than or equal to 4 hours after onset of pain, ST elevation was initially seen in 72%. A positive correlation was observed between the initial ST elevation and severity of chest pain, incidence of congestive heart failure and two-year mortality rate. We thus conclude that some further information regarding presence of Q-waves can be obtained in about 5% of patients with suspected acute MI from an increased number of precordial leads.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "Two concentrations of levobunolol (0.5% and 1%) and one concentration of timolol (0.5%) were evaluated for the control of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in a double-masked, randomized study. Fifty-one patients received one of the three study treatments in both eyes bid for one year. Both drugs were equally effective in reducing IOP: The overall reduction in mean IOP was slightly more than 9 mm Hg in all three treatment groups. Levobunolol was as safe and effective as timolol for the long-term control of elevated IOP.", 
    "44": "The aim of the study was to clarify whether antihypertensive treatment could affect the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in diabetics during exercise (450 kpm/min, followed by 600 kpm/min, 20 min each). Young male insulin-dependent diabetics with normal UAE (n = 9) and diabetics with incipient nephropathy (n = 7) were examined in an acute study. Five patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy participated in a long-term study. Incipient diabetic nephropathy is defined as persistently elevated UAE (greater than 15 micrograms/min), but no clinical proteinuria. In the acute study, using placebo/metoprolol 10 mg i.v. in patients with normal UAE, the maximal SBP at 600 kpm/min was reduced by 17 mmHg +/- 10 (SD) (2p less than 1.0%) and the maximal SBP at 600 kpm/min in the patients with incipient nephropathy was reduced by 15 mmHg +/- 11 (SD) (2p less than 1.0%). However, no difference was observed in UAE, in patients with normal UAE or those with incipient nephropathy. Five of the patients with incipient nephropathy were followed with repeated exercise tests before and during 2.6 years of antihypertensive treatment, using metoprolol 200 mg/24 h and subsequently also hydroflumethiazid 25 mg/24 h. The maximal SBP at 600 kpm/min at the end of the study compared to the pretreatment level was reduced by 38 mmHg +/- 12 (SD) (2p less than 1.0%), and furthermore the exercise-induced elevated UAE was reduced by 61% +/- 29 (SD) (2p = 2.0%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "The renal medulla contains cells in its papillary portion, the renomedullary interstitial cells (RIC), that secrete a blood pressure-controlling hormone. This hormone system has been identified by classic types of experiments as developed by Bayliss and Starling, Goldblatt, Byrom and Dodson and Berthold. The antihypertensive neutral renomedullary lipid is the putative hormone. This hormonal system is antagonized by angiotensin II. It antagonizes the blood pressure (BP) elevating effects of salt.", 
    "46": "Penbutolol and propranolol were administered orally in a dosage of 40 mg once daily and 80 mg twice daily, respectively to 12 patients with hypertension and impaired renal function. Both drugs caused a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Serum creatinine concentration increased significantly by 10% during therapy with propranolol without concomitant decrease in creatinine clearance. No such effect was seen with penbutolol. GFR measured with [125I]-iothalamate showed no significant changes with both drugs.", 
    "47": "The effects of oral nitrendipine and oral propranolol, alone and in combination, on AV conduction have been examined in 11 patients with essential hypertension in whom arterial pressure was not adequately controlled despite treatment with thiazide diuretics. The study was performed double-blind. After a drug free period of 1 week, the patients received two 7 day courses of drug therapy after initial control measurements. Five of the eleven patients were randomised to receive nitrendipine 20 mg daily, the other six patients received propranolol (Inderal LA 160 mg daily) for the first week of therapy. During week 2, 10 patients received combined therapy. In the 10 patients who completed the study, oral nitrendipine, given either alone or in combination with oral propranolol, had no significant effect on resting PR, QRS, QT intervals nor on AV conduction as assessed by ambulatory electrocardiography. Propranolol did not affect the resting PR interval but significantly increased PR intervals on the ambulatory ECG recordings during single and combined therapy. However the maximum PR intervals remained within normal limits.", 
    "48": "Insulin-induced hypoglycemia induced a fall in blood pressure (BP) in patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension (IOH) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), but not in control subjects. Only in IOH was there a correlation between plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels and maintenance of BP during the test. The hypotension was not affected by pretreatment with propranolol. Hypotension during insulin-induced hypoglycemia is manifested in patients who lack an adequate NE response. The hypotension, however, may be due to a central action of insulin because not all MSA patients with impaired NE release become hypotensive.", 
    "49": "The effects of epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and isoproterenol on blood pressure and heart rate were studied in cannulated American bullfrogs, Rana catesbeiana. The bullfrogs were chronically cannulated with a T cannula in the right sciatic artery. In warm-acclimated (22 degrees C) bullfrogs, preinjection mean systemic arterial pressure (SAP) prior to experimental treatment was 13.1 +/- 0.7 mm Hg. Preinjection heart rate was 34.8 +/- 1.8 beats per minute. These parameters were lower in cold-acclimated (12 degrees C) bullfrogs. Cold-acclimated animals had mean SAP values of 8.2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg, and heart rate was 11.1 +/- 1.1 beats per minute. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine increased blood pressure to an equivalent degree in warm- and cold-acclimated animals. Dose-related decreases in heart rate in response to these catecholamines were observed in warm- but not in cold-acclimated bullfrogs. Warm-acclimated animals were more responsive to isoproterenol from 0.03 micrograms/kg body weight (bw) to 10 micrograms/kg bw than were cold-acclimated animals. The response to isoproterenol was effectively blocked by propranolol (5 mg/kg bw) in both warm- and cold-acclimated animals. Propranolol alone decreased mean SAP in both warm- and cold-acclimated animals, suggesting blockade of endogenous sympathetic activity. Beta receptor response thus appears diminished, but not absent at 12 degrees C. However, the alpha receptors responsible for elevation of blood pressure equally responsive at 12 degrees and 22 degrees C.", 
    "50": "The relationships between cardiac performance, coronary flow, minimal coronary vascular resistance and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) were explored in isolated hearts from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and in hearts from SHR given a combination of metoprolol and felodipine (selective calcium antagonist) for 35 weeks. Antihypertensive therapy markedly reduced arterial pressure and caused a substantial regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. An antegrade working-heart perfusion system was used, allowing measurements of stroke volume, coronary flow and MVO2 at varying pre- and afterloads. In untreated SHR cardiac function was reduced at low and enhanced at high perfusion pressure compared with WKY. Minimal coronary vascular resistance, which was greatly increased in SHR, was significantly reduced by treatment, allowing higher coronary flow for any given perfusion pressure and consequently a lower degree of oxygen extraction. In addition, at a given workload, MVO2 was reduced in both untreated and treated SHR. These results stress the importance of having adequate coronary perfusion within a hypertensive structurally redesigned coronary vascular bed in order to maintain cardiac performance. With antihypertensive therapy in SHR, an improved coronary flow capacity was created due to regression of the hypertensive vascular changes.", 
    "51": "The influence of the oral administration of prazosin (an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker) and propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocker) on eicosanoid formation in renal cortices and papillae was evaluated in rabbits maintained on a high cholesterol diet. Rabbit renal microsomal fractions were incubated with radiolabeled arachidonic acid (AA) and glutathione (GSH) and the levels of metabolites were determined by thin layer chromatography (TLC), autoradiography and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Rabbits on a high cholesterol diet showed no significant differences in total eicosanoid production compared to rabbits on a normal diet. Prazosin was found to significantly inhibit the formation of all eicosanoids in the renal cortex. In contrast, propranolol had no such inhibitory effect in the renal cortex. Neither drug had a significant effect on eicosanoid formation in the renal papilla. While oral administration of prazosin effectively inhibited the formation of all eicosanoids in the cortex, the addition of prazosin in vitro at physiological concentrations showed no such effect. These findings may have reflected alpha-receptor mediated event(s) which resulted in an alteration in eicosanoid formation in the kidney, suggesting an interaction between the sympathetic nervous system and the AA cascade.", 
    "52": "The restoration of the cardiac ATP content after an ischemic insult takes a long period of time. Ribose, via stimulation of adenine nucleotide biosynthesis, accelerated the replenishment of the adenine nucleotide pool in the heart, in the kidney, however, it had no effect. In the myocardium, the ribose-mediated restoration of the adenine nucleotide content was dependent on the duration of the previous ischemic period and was not influenced by the beta-receptor blocker atenolol.", 
    "53": "Responses to the beta-adrenoceptor agonists isoprenaline (Iso) (non selective), salbutamol (Sal) (beta 2-selective) and noradrenaline (NA) (beta 1-selective) were studied on incubated and superfused rat lung strip. In both conditions, Iso and Sal elicited dose-related relaxations of lung strip and these responses were unaffected by the presence of phentolamine (Phen) 10(-5) M. Contractile responses to NA were obtained when it was used alone whereas in the presence of Phen 10(-5) M, NA elicited relaxant responses. The relative potencies of Iso : Sal : NA (plus Phen) were 100 : 20 : 0.69. This demonstrates that beta 2-adrenoceptor is the predominant beta-subtype involved in responses. Propranolol (10(-4) M) completely abolished the relaxant responses to Iso. However, after the addition of Iso tissue responded normally to drugs acting by other mechanisms. Thus, relaxations were obtained with caffeine and contractions with acetylcholine (AcH) or NA. This shows that responses to Iso are mediated only by beta-adrenoceptors. Propranolol and the selective beta-blocking agents butoxamine (beta 2) and atenolol (beta 1) competitively antagonized the effects of Iso. The Schild plots obtained had slopes which did not differ significantly from -1 and mean pA2 values were: 7.82 for propranolol; 6.32 for butoxamine and 5.22 for atenolol. These experiments were carried out in the absence of catecholamine uptake inhibitors, since in a preliminary set of experiments no significant changes of lung strip responses to Iso were observed in the presence of cocaine (10(-5) M) or corticosterone (10(-5) M). In conclusion, it appears that incubated rat lung strip possesses intrinsic tone and, although it cannot be considered a representative preparation of peripheral airways, it provides a valid model for investigating the direct-effects of drugs which act at beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "54": "Cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors (beta AR) were studied in rats after 4 months of diabetes induced by streptozotocin (50 mg/kg, i.v.). Saturation binding studies performed using [125I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) as an antagonist ligand showed that the number and affinity of beta AR were not significantly altered. Analysis of competition curves of ICYP binding by the agonist (-)-isoproterenol showed that diabetes induces an increase in the (-)-isoproterenol IC50 and a steepening of the curve (\"pseudo-Hill\" coefficient not significantly different from 1) in the absence of Gpp(NH)p, while these parameters were not significantly modified in the presence of Gpp(NH)p (10(-4) M). These results indicates that beta AR were not significantly reduced in number but altered in their capacity to efficiently couple with the GTP-binding protein of adenylate cyclase (AC). These data can be correlated to the alteration of beta-adrenergic stimulation of cardiac AC previously observed after 4 months of diabetes. The characteristics of beta AR alteration at this stage of the disease are similar to those of a first step of a beta AR desensitization process due to overstimulation.", 
    "55": "Cervical vagotomy was performed bilaterally in three series, i.e. normal (untreated), atropine treated and propranolol treated animals. The classical effect of the nerve section on heart rate, arterial blood pressure and respiration respectively were verified in the three series to confirm the reproducibility of the findings. The pre- and post-vagotomy plasma volume and haematocrit were estimated and thus the blood volume was calculated in each animal. The investigation indicated that: The interruption of vagal sensory information reflexively expanded the plasma and blood volume. This information was normally tonically active and inhibitory in nature. The volume expansion after vagotomy was brought about by stimulation of autonomic nerves, most probably the sympathetic nerves. These three conclusions suggested that expansion of vascular capacity as well as blood and plasma volume was controlled through vagal sensory information.", 
    "56": "In vivo administration of the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, induced a rapid, dose-dependent increase in the mouse thymic cyclic AMP (cAMP) content. Hydrocortisone (1 mg/animal), at a concentration which by itself did not alter the cAMP content of the thymus, markedly potentiated the effect of isoproterenol (5 micrograms/animal). Isoproterenol or hydrocortisone treatment led to a significant decrease in thymic weight and an even greater decrease in thymocyte number. In addition, the simultaneous administration of both agents produced additive effects on thymic atrophy. It appears from these results that glucocorticoids and catecholamines exert a negative control on the thymic size by increasing the programmed cell death of some cell subpopulations. Thus, glucocorticoids and catecholamines, either alone or in association, may influence the immune system under physiological or pathophysiological conditions.", 
    "57": "The bipyridine derivative, milrinone, produced positive inotropic effects in isolated, contracting right ventricular papillary muscles and left atria from guinea pigs as well as in human papillary muscle strips. The inotropic effect was biphasic in guinea pig papillary muscles (EC50, high affinity, 1.5 X 10(-6) mol/l, about 35% of maximal effect; apparent EC50, 3 X 10(-5) mol/l with a maximal effect at 2 X 10(-4) mol/l) but monophasic in guinea pig left atria (EC50, 6 X 10(-5) mol/l) and in human papillary muscle strips (EC50, 5.8 X 10(-5) mol/l). In guinea pig papillary muscles, reserpine pretreatment or l-practolol preincubation reduced the low concentration effect only. In the presence of l-practolol, carbachol reduced the low concentration effect only. In the presence of l-practolol, carbachol reduced but not abolished the inotropic effects of milrinone (3 X 10(-6) mol/l, 1 X 10(-4) mol/l) in both guinea pig and human myocardium. This antagonism was prevented by atropine preincubation. The maximum inotropic effect of milrinone was similar to that of ouabain and calcium in guinea pig myocardium but markedly less than either calcium or ouabain in human myocardium. Milrinone inhibited crude guinea pig and human cardiac phosphodiesterase activity in vitro but did not inhibit 3H-ouabain binding to partially purified human cardiac (Na+ + K+)-ATPase-containing membranes. We conclude that the primary mode of action of milrinone in both guinea pig and human myocardium is through inhibition of phosphodiesterase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "58": "Preparations of the cranial segment of the rat inferior vena cava preincubated with 3H-noradrenaline were superfused in the presence of desipramine and corticosterone. Tritium overflow was stimulated electrically (2 Hz). The experiments were carried out in spirally cut strips with or without intima or in segments ligated at both ends and superfused either on the adventitial side (\"conventionally\") or \"inside out\". In spirally cut strips electrically evoked 3H overflow was increased by isoprenaline and procaterol, but much less so by prenalterol. Adrenaline 1 nmol/l increased overflow, but at high concentrations it reduced it, just as noradrenaline did at all concentrations. The concentration-response curve for isoprenaline was shifted to the right by propranolol (apparent pA2:8.29) and even more so by ICI 118-551, whereas atenolol was less potent (apparent pA2:6.42). Rauwolscine which, given alone, increased the evoked 3H overflow antagonized the inhibitory effect of noradrenaline (apparent pA2:7.58). These findings indicate that beta 2- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors mediating facilitation and inhibition of noradrenaline release, respectively, are present in the vena cava. The response to isoprenaline (at all concentrations) was considerably lower in segments superfused \"conventionally\" than in spirally cut strips, but no difference was observed with respect to the effects of noradrenaline, rauwolscine and angiotensin II. The effect of isoprenaline was clearly more pronounced in segments superfused \"inside out\" than in segments superfused \"conventionally\". In spirally cut strips angiotensin II increased 3H overflow. This effect was antagonized by saralasin, suggesting the involvement of facilitatory angiotensin receptors. In spirally cut strips or segments superfused \"inside out\", saralasin or captopril considerably attenuated the facilitatory effect of isoprenaline on 3H overflow. Conversely, in the presence of isoprenaline, captopril inhibited the electrically evoked 3H overflow in spirally cut strips, whereas in the absence of isoprenaline, captopril was ineffective. In conclusion, angiotensin receptors and alpha 2-adrenoceptors appear to be located on the sympathetic nerve endings, but a major part of the beta 2-adrenoceptors probably is subendothelial (most likely on smooth muscle cells). Angiotensin II, synthesized in response to beta 2-adrenoceptor activation, probably stimulates angiotensin receptors on the noradrenergic nerves, leading to an increase in noradrenaline release.", 
    "59": "Concentrations of glycogen, glucose, glucose-6-phosphate and lactate in the lateral vastus muscle were measured in seven subjects before and after dynamic muscle exercise at a work load of 75% of each subject's maximal working capacity, and with and without intravenous administration of the beta 1-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, atenolol. Pulmonary oxygen uptake was measured during exercise. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were measured throughout the study. Arterial concentrations of glucose, lactate and free fatty acids were measured at rest and during exercise. The muscle concentration of glycogen and the extent of glycogen depletion with exercise were not influenced by the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker. Similarly, there was no change in the muscle concentrations of glucose, glucose-6-phosphate and lactate. Heart rate decreased at rest and during exercise. Arterial blood pressure was not influenced by beta-blockade. Pulmonary oxygen uptake decreased by 6.5%. The exercise induced rise in arterial blood concentration of free fatty acids was abolished by beta 1-selective beta-blockade. It is concluded that the decrease in lactate release from exercising muscles during beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade seen in other studies cannot be explained by an impaired breakdown of muscle glycogen. It may be inferred, however, that a reduced availability of free fatty acids in the exercising muscles during beta 1-selective (and non-selective) beta-blockade may enhance the combustion of pyruvic acid and thereby decrease the production of lactate.", 
    "60": "Confluent cell sheets were cultured from the tracheal epithelium of normal humans or from tracheal and nasal epithelia of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Changes in short-circuit current (Isc) or cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in response to 10(-5) M isoproterenol were measured. In CF tracheal cells the response to isoproterenol was transient, and the maximal increase in Isc was one-tenth normal. In CF nasal cells, isoproterenol or epinephrine caused only small transient increases in Isc. However, in both CF nasal and tracheal cells, the Ca ionophore, A23187, caused relatively large increases in Isc that were inhibited by the Cl transport blocker, bumetanide, suggesting that Cl secretion can be induced by raising intracellular levels of Ca. In normal tracheal cell sheets, cAMP levels increased within 15 s of isoproterenol addition and continued to increase for up to 20 min. Resting levels of cAMP in CF tracheal cells were not statistically different from those of normal cells and showed linear increases for up to 4 min after addition of isoproterenol. Changes in cAMP in CF nasal cells were similar to the changes in CF tracheal cells. After 2 min, all three cell types showed cAMP levels elevated approximately equal to 10-fold. These results suggest that receptor-activated stimulation of adenylate cyclase is normal in CF. However, though raised cAMP levels stimulate Cl secretion in normal, they are unable to do so in CF airway epithelial cells.", 
    "61": "beta-Chlornaltrexamine and beta-funaltrexamine analogues 4-7 with different length \"arms\" to which an electrophilic moiety is attached were synthesized in an effort to obtain affinity labels that would selectively and irreversibly block specific opioid receptor types and subtypes. One of the compounds, 4, was a potent, irreversible blocker of opioid receptors in the guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens preparations. The results of this study suggest that nucleophiles that are remote from the recognition locus are capable of alkylation by reactive electrophiles.", 
    "62": "The cardiovascular supersensitivity observed after discontinuation of administration of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists may be explained by an increase in the density of beta adrenergic receptors. Thus, a change in the density of receptors has been observed in human lymphocytes after administration of propranolol (Aarons et al., 1980). The effects of pindolol, a beta adrenergic receptor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, were compared with those of propranolol or placebo. Pindolol (10 mg q.i.d.), propranolol (40 mg q.i.d.) or placebo were administered to 12 subjects for 8 days. The density of beta adrenergic receptors was determined by Scatchard analysis of the specific binding of [125I]iodopindolol on membranes prepared from human lymphocytes. Administration of pindolol resulted in a 30 to 50% decrease in the density of beta adrenergic receptors. This decrease was apparent within 1 day of beginning pindolol administration and it persisted for at least 8 days after discontinuation of drug administration. The reversibility of the decrease in receptors observed after pindolol administration was studied in 27 subjects given propranolol, pindolol or placebo for 4 days in a double-blind cross-over trial. Propranolol consistently induced a small increase in the density of beta adrenergic receptors. The density of receptors returned to predrug values within 2 days after discontinuation of propranolol administration. Pindolol induced a 30 to 50% decrease in the density of receptors which, as observed previously, persisted for at least 10 days after discontinuation of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Propranolol has been effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias in up to 70% of patients in some series; however, a wide range of concentrations was required to produce this degree of efficacy. In one series, 40% of responders required high serum concentrations (greater than 500 ng/ml) in excess of those required for physiologic beta-receptor blockade (25 to 150 ng/ml). To assess the relative contribution of high concentration electrophysiologic effects to antiarrhythmic efficacy the results of programmed electrical stimulation were compared at high and low (beta-blocking) concentrations in 28 patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia. Propranolol was given as a series of loading and maintenance infusions producing first a mean concentration of 130 +/- 72 ng/ml (beta-blocking) and then a mean concentration of 743 +/- 523 ng/ml (high). Beta-blockade was assessed by the percent reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia. Near maximal beta-blockade was achieved by a concentration of 150 ng/ml. At a low concentration, 6 of 28 patients had a response to propranolol (complete in 5 and partial in 1). At a high concentration, one additional patient had a complete response while three had a partial antiarrhythmic response. At high concentrations of propranolol there was a significant shortening of the QTc interval relative to that seen during the low dose infusion. No other significant electrophysiologic changes occurred at high versus low concentration. In summary, an antiarrhythmic response to propranolol occurs most frequently at a beta-blocking concentration. High concentration electrophysiologic effects occur and these appear to contribute to antiarrhythmic efficacy in some patients.", 
    "64": "The effects of the sulfhydryl-reactive alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) on the rabbit luteal adenylyl cyclase system were studied. Treatment of luteal membranes with NEM revealed three activities with differing sensitivities to NEM treatment. When luteal membranes were treated with NEM on ice for 30 min, it was found that NaF-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in cholate extracts of these membranes was most sensitive to this treatment. Half-maximal inhibition was obtained at 0.09 mM NEM. The activity of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide- and Mg-binding regulatory component (Ns), as assessed by functional reconstitution of NaF-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity into membranes from the cyc-variant of the S49 mouse lymphoma, was less sensitive to this treatment, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at 0.69 mM NEM. In contrast, high affinity gonadotropin and beta-adrenergic binding, as assessed by competitive displacement of [125I]iodo-hCG by bovine LH and (-)3-[125I]iodocyanopindolol by isoproterenol, was unaffected by NEM concentrations up to 50 mM when membranes were treated on ice. However, when membranes were treated with NEM at 25 C for 30 min, high affinity gonadotropin and beta-adrenergic binding demonstrated similar sensitivities to NEM treatment, such that 50 mM NEM completely inhibited high affinity binding to both receptors. Under either of the conditions described above, neither the number of receptors nor the affinities of the labeled probes for their receptors were altered by NEM treatment. Thus, there appears to be at least three NEM-sensitive sites necessary for the functioning of the rabbit luteal adenylyl cyclase system, one associated with the catalytic component, one on Ns which interacts with the catalytic component, and one involved in high affinity agonist binding. Furthermore, it appears that formation of the high affinity binding state is regulated similarly for gonadotropin and beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "65": "To evaluate the role of dietary sodium and antihypertensive drugs in the modulation of myocardial structure, especially myosin isozymic pattern, renal hypertensive rats (two-kidney, one clip) were treated with a sodium-deficient diet (7 mEq/kg), captopril, or atenolol. Native myosin was extracted under nondissociating conditions and separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The percentage of myosin isozyme V1 was significantly decreased from 71.5 +/- 7.5 (Wistar controls) to 52.4 +/- 1.7% (p less than 0.05) in renal hypertensive rats and was associated with an increase in V3 component from 12.7 +/- 5.1 (Wistar controls) to 23.1 +/- 1.4% (renal hypertensive rats; p less than 0.05). There was a dramatic change in the myosin isozyme distribution pattern after treatment with low sodium and captopril. Six weeks of low sodium therapy in renal hypertensive rats resulted in an increase in V1 from 52.4 +/- 1.7 to 74.8 +/- 4.8% and a reduction in V3 from 23.1 +/- 1.4 to 9.5 +/- 2.4%. Normal rats treated with low sodium showed similar results. The percentage distribution of isozymes after low sodium therapy in the captopril-treated rats was not different from that in normal Wistar controls. Captopril therapy also caused an increase in V1 and a decrease in V3. Atenolol therapy, on the other hand, caused a significant increase in V3 and decrease in V1 with no change in blood pressure or heart weight. These data suggest that dietary sodium may play an important role in the modulation of myocardial mass and may modulate signals for synthesis of V1 or V3 myosin phenotypes.", 
    "66": "To probe the possible role of endogenous opiates in Sertoli cell proliferation during testicular development, the effect of interfering with beta-endorphin action either in vivo or in vitro was determined. The percent of Sertoli cells dividing was measured with quantitative autoradiography in [methyl 3H]-thymidine-exposed fetal testes maintained in organ culture with or without FSH, in the presence or absence of the opiate blocker naloxone. After 1 or 2 days in culture, naloxone enhanced the rise in Sertoli cell proliferation seen with FSH alone, while 2 days of incubation with naloxone alone markedly raised the percent of Sertoli cells dividing above that in untreated cultures. Moreover, when endorphin antiserum was injected directly into testes of pups and Sertoli cell proliferation in vivo measured 8 or 19 h later, there was a dramatic increase in the percent of Sertoli nuclei labeled by [methyl 3H]-thymidine compared to controls. These findings suggest that beta-endorphin produced within the testis is a paracrine modifier of the proliferative response of Sertoli cells to FSH. This implies that communication occurs between Leydig and Sertoli cells during development via endogenous testicular opiates.", 
    "67": "Tranylcypromine (TCP) pretreatment was found to accelerate the tremorogenic activity of tremorine in rats. Conversely, reserpinization delayed the onset of induction of tremors, and a significant diminution in their intensity was observed in these rats. A comparative study of the antitremor activity of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists against this tremor-model showed that butoxamine (beta 2-antagonist) and propranolol (nonselective antagonist) were able to afford a rapid and powerful protection, whereas a weaker and delayed effect was observed in rats treated with the beta 1-antagonist, acebutolol. Furthermore, the antitremor activity of butoxamine and propranolol but not that of acebutolol was found to be potentiated and diminished in rats pretreated with reserpine and TCP, respectively. It was inferred that beta 2-receptor modulated the tremorogenic activity of tremorine, and that inhibition by propranolol or butoxamine of this subtype beta-adrenoceptor resulted in rapid and powerful suppression of tremors, and that the antiadrenergic activity of acebutolol was unlikely to have a role in its antitremor effect.", 
    "68": "L-Sparteine sulfate (sparteine, 3 mg/kg) was injected intravenously over 3 min in 12 anaesthetized dogs in order to evaluate the inotropic effect of this antiarrhythmic drug on the heart in intact organisms. There was a discrete decline in left ventricular dP/dtmax which was transient within 9 min. No influence could be detected on right ventricular pressure rise velocity. Aortic pressure increased by about 15% and a parallel increase in left ventricular enddiastolic pressure was observed. Heart rate was slightly diminished. Pharmacological blockade of cardiac autonomic nerves did not influence considerably the effect of sparteine. Pretreatment with captopril and phentolamine did not abolish the vasoconstrictive property which was also present in a reserpine pretreated dog. Sparteine shows no pronounced inotropic effect in the heart in situ. It increases arterial blood pressure by direct vascular constriction.",

    "70": "Hepatic and respiratory failure, common complications following liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially when it is combined with liver cirrhosis, can be overcome by careful management of the circulatory and respiratory systems. Another common complication is intractable ascites which resists conventional therapy, such as, diuretics and protein replacement. Here we report a case in which intractable ascites was successfully treated with propranolol. The patient, a 48-year-old man who underwent liver resection for HCC combined with cirrhosis, started to suffer from ascites about 1 week after surgery. Upon administration of propranolol (1 mg/kg/day) with furosemide, his body weight decreased 500 g/day, returning to the preoperative value in 2 weeks in parallel with the normalization of the PRA. No side effects were observed during the medication period. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, is thought to suppress renin secretion from the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney by blocking its beta-adrenergic receptor, thus suppressing the entire renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. We concluded that propranolol is a promising drug for intractable ascites encountered with liver cirrhosis.", 
    "71": "Interactions of beta-adrenergic partial agonists with the beta-adrenoceptor were studied in isolated guinea-pig taenia caecum. The competitive inhibition curve for specific binding of a high concentration (50 nM) of [3H]-befunolol by befunolol showed a biphasic shape, although the curve for specific binding of a low concentration (1 nM) was monophasic. All the competitive inhibition curves for specific binding of [3H]-befunolol (1 nM and 50 nM) by isoprenaline and propranolol showed monophasic shapes. These results suggest that befunolol may be able to discriminate two different binding sites of the beta-adrenoceptor: the high affinity site and the low affinity site.", 
    "72": "The experiments examine the actions of sympathomimetic drugs on the responses evoked by electrical field stimulation or by acetylcholine in guinea-pig tracheal strip chains. Electrical field stimulation evoked contractions which were cholinergically mediated, in the presence of guanethidine (10 microM) and indomethacin (2 microM). All the sympathomimetic drugs tested caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the height of these contractions. Inhibitory effects of isoprenaline and terbutaline were largely prevented by propranolol (2 microM) alone, whereas those of clonidine, oxymetazoline, lidamidine and WHR1370 were prevented by yohimbine alone (2 microM). Treatments with both propranolol and yohimbine were required to prevent the inhibitory effects of noradrenaline, adrenaline and dopamine. Contractions evoked by exogenous acetylcholine (0.1-3 microM) were also inhibited by all catecholamines and terbutaline, but not by clonidine, oxymetazoline, lidamidine and WHR1370. The inhibitory effects were antagonized by propranolol (2 microM) alone. The results suggest that in guinea-pig isolated tracheal muscle, sympathomimetic drugs can inhibit cholinergic neurotransmission not only by postjunctional beta 2-adrenoceptors but also by prejunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "73": "The possibility that hypokalaemia might increase the mortality of treated hypertensives in the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic has been examined by comparison of serum potassium in decedents and survivors and by calculation of age-adjusted mortality rates for patients grouped in quartiles of serum potassium measured at the last clinic visit. In this study, 3783 patients with non-malignant hypertension were followed for an average of 6.5 years and of these 1907 had one or more measurements of serum potassium during their last year of attendance. Serum potassium fell in 414 patients given diuretics with or without other drugs except beta-blockers. This fall was similar in those who died of ischaemic heart disease (3.71 mmol/l) and in those who survived (3.72 mmol/l). Serum potassium rose in 167 patients who received beta-blockers with or without other drugs except diuretics and fell slightly among 1326 patients taking other combinations of drugs. There were no significant differences in serum potassium between decedents and survivors in either of these treatment groups. Age-adjusted mortality in deaths per 1000 patient-years in the lowest quartile of serum potassium (less than 3.7 mmol/l) was 28.1 for men and 15.0 for women. Higher serum potassium was associated with slightly, but not significantly, higher mortality in both sexes. There was no relation between serum potassium and mortality in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, nor was there a relation when death due to ischaemic heart disease was considered separately. Failure of hypokalaemia to predict outcome was confirmed by univariate and multivariate analyses which included, in addition to potassium, assessment of cigarette smoking, initial blood urea and electrocardiographic findings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "We compared the central and renal haemodynamic effects of tertatolol, a new non-cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking drug without partial agonist activity, with those of an equipotent dosage of propranolol in two groups of 10 patients each with acute cerebral injury who had developed systemic hypertension. After tertatolol, 5 mg orally, mean arterial pressure was unchanged, heart rate decreased by 22% (P less than 0.01) and cardiac index by 24% (P less than 0.01), while renal blood flow remained unchanged (-5%, NS). After 160 mg propranolol orally, mean arterial pressure was unchanged, heart rate decreased by 12% (P less than 0.01), cardiac index by 16% (P less than 0.01) and renal blood flow by 17% (P less than 0.01). There was a moderate rise in norepinephrine levels after tertatolol only. Thus in this particular model of acute hypertension, tertatolol acted as a potent beta-blocking agent but differed from propranolol by preserving renal perfusion.", 
    "75": "Cardioselective [Acebutolol (N = 10)] or noncardioselective [Oxprenolol (N = 9)] or [Pindolol (N = 9)] beta-adrenergic blockers were given to patients with suspected hyperthyroidism. Four h after start of the beta blockade median serum thyroglobulin (Tg) had decreased to 33 (range: 13-325) micrograms/l from 41 (range: 12-333) micrograms/l before start in the acebutolol treated group (p less than 0.05). A significant decrease in serum Tg was also found in the oxprenolol-treated group [before start: 45 (24-423) micrograms/l and after 4h: 43 (18-363) micrograms/l (p less than 0.01)] and in the pindolol-treated group [before start: 154 (33-210) micrograms/l and after 4 h: 63 (19-157) micrograms/l (p less than 0.05) treated groups. After 7 days treatment the decrease in serum Tg was significant [to 85 (34-182) micrograms/l (p less than 0.02)] only in the Pindolol-treated group. It is suggested that both hemodynamic changes as well as interference with the intrathyroidal 12 S Tg to 19 S Tg dimerization might explain the changes in serum Tg during beta blockade. Knowledge of drug influence on serum thyroglobulin is important for the interpretation of variations found in patients where thyroglobulin is being used for diagnostic purposes.", 
    "76": "The present experiments were designed to study urine volume and urinary sodium excretion effects of beta-antagonists and beta-agonists with reference to beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in rats. The beta-antagonists used were atenolol as a selective beta 1-antagonist, butoxamine as a beta 2-antagonist and propranolol as a non-selective beta-antagonist. The beta-agonist used were salbutamol as a beta 2-agonist and isoproterenol as a non-selective beta-agonist. Beta-antagonists increased the urine volume and urinary sodium excretion, but beta-agonists decreased the urine volume and urinary sodium excretion. With regards to these effects, atenolol increased the urine volume more than urinary sodium excretion, isoproterenol decreased the urine volume more than urinary sodium excretion, and salbutamol decreased the urinary sodium excretion more than urine volume. When beta-antagonists were infused with a beta-agonist, the original diuretic effects of these beta-antagonists were inhibited by the beta-agonist. In these effects, beta-antagonists infused with isoproterenol inhibited urine volume more than urinary sodium excretion, but beta-antagonists infused with salbutamol inhibited urinary sodium excretion more than urine volume. These results indicate that the urine volume is related to beta 1-adrenoceptors, while the urinary sodium excretion is related to beta 2-adrenoceptors, although there is no selectivity towards either beta 1-adrenoceptors or beta 2-adrenoceptors as far as diuresis or antidiuresis is concerned.", 
    "77": "Whether large coronary artery dilation induced by beta-adrenergic stimulation is mediated by beta 1- or beta 2-adrenergic receptors remains controversial. This problem is particularly difficult to address in vivo due to the concomitant increase in coronary blood flow with beta-adrenergic stimulation, which by itself can dilate large coronary arteries. To reconcile this problem, 5 calves were instrumented with intraaortic and intracoronary (i.c.) catheters, ultrasonic diameter transducers, Doppler flow transducers, and hydraulic occluders on the left circumflex coronary artery. Two to six weeks following surgery, beta-adrenergic agonists were administered i.c. to avoid complicating systemic effects. Isoproterenol (0.0025 micrograms/kg, a beta 1 + beta 2-adrenergic agonist) increased coronary diameter (7.1 +/- 0.8% from 5.80 +/- 0.58 mm) (p less than 0.01). Similar increases (p less than 0.01) in coronary diameter occurred with prenalterol (0.4 micrograms/kg, beta 1-adrenergic agonist) (9.5 +/- 1.4%) and pirbuterol (0.25 micrograms/kg, beta 2-adrenergic agonist) (8.1 +/- 1.2%). When coronary blood flow was prevented from rising with the hydraulic constrictor, increases in coronary diameter to all three beta-adrenergic agonists were not attenuated. Large coronary artery dilation with prenalterol and pirbuterol was abolished with beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor blockade, respectively, while neither beta 1- nor beta 2-adrenergic blockade alone abolished the large coronary artery dilation with isoproterenol. To identify the predominant subtype of beta-adrenergic receptor, competitive inhibition curves utilizing 125I-cyanopindolol (125I-CYP) as the radiolabel versus isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were generated in membrane preparations from calf heart (predominant beta 1), calf lung (predominant beta 2) and calf coronary artery. The coronary artery membrane preparations demonstrated an intermediate pattern. Competition curves with selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists again demonstrated a pattern for coronary artery intermediate to that of heart and lung, further confirming the presence of both beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in large coronary arteries, with a ratio of beta 1: beta 2 of 1.5-2.0:1.0. Thus, large coronary arteries of the calf contain both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors identified utilizing ligand binding techniques, and stimulation of both receptor subtypes in the intact conscious animal results in large coronary artery dilation, independent of blood-flow-mediated vasodilation.", 
    "78": "The electrophysiological effects of various concentrations of atenolol, metoprolol, nadolol, D-oxprenolol, L-oxprenolol, and D, L-oxprenolol and D-sotalol, L-sotalol, and D, L-sotalol were compared in rabbit right ventricular papillary muscle studied in vitro using intracellular microelectrodes. An assessment of the relative beta blocking effects of D-sotalol and D, L-sotalol against the inotropic action of isoprenaline was made in the same preparation. Of the drugs tested, only oxprenolol and sotalol showed prolongation of action potential duration and effective refractory period (class III action), with oxprenolol showing, in addition, depression of maximal upstroke velocity and the presence of post-repolarisation refractoriness (class I action). When contrasted at clinically relevant concentrations, only sotalol retained a class III effect, without any actions on variables related to fast inward current. The effects of oxprenolol and sotalol were not found to be stereospecific. The mechanical experiments indicate that, in this preparation, D-sotalol has approximately one-fourteenth of the beta blocking potency of the racemic compound. It therefore merits further consideration as a useful alternative class III antiarrhythmic agent, which would be free from the side effects of beta receptor blocking treatment.", 
    "79": "The effects of class I, II, III and IV antiarrhythmic drugs (as classified by Vaughan Williams 1974), tetrodotoxin and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists on the extraneuronal accumulation of isoprenaline were examined in isolated rat hearts perfused with 3H-isoprenaline (1 mumol/l) and tropolone (100 mumol/l) for 30 min at a constant flow rate (6.5 ml/min) at 40 degrees C. Quinidine (class I), verapamil (IV), diltiazem (IV), dilazep (IV), nifedipine (IV), tetrodotoxin and butoxamine, at a concentration of 10 mumol/l, significantly decreased the extraneuronal accumulation of isoprenaline. The present study demonstrated that quinidine (class I) and all of the calcium channel blockers (class IV) had potent inhibitory effects on the extraneuronal accumulation of isoprenaline. The concentrations of these drugs needed for this decrease were nearly comparable to those needed to suppress isoprenaline-tropolone-induced ventricular fibrillation (Sono et al. 1985a). The antiarrhythmic effects of quinidine and calcium channel blockers in this experimental model may be partly due to a decrease in the extraneuronal accumulation of isoprenaline.", 
    "80": "Reduction of myocardial oxygen demand by beta blockers should be beneficial for treatment of the supply-demand imbalance of severe myocardial ischaemia leading to infarction. There is evidence that rate-pressure product, an index of myocardial oxygen demand, is an independent variable for determination of infarct size, and that reduction of rate-pressure product by beta blockers or by other means is beneficial. Although experimental evidence is conflicting, some animal studies have shown protection from beta blockers when a coronary artery is permanently occluded, while a majority of studies show protection when a temporary coronary artery occlusion is followed by reperfusion. Prevention of ventricular fibrillation due to coronary artery occlusion has been shown in animal studies. In patients with developing infarction, rate-pressure product is reduced by approximately 20% when a beta blocker is given intravenously, and cardiac metabolism, assessed by coronary sinus sampling, returns to a more normal \"oxidative\" pattern. Indirect indices of infarct size, namely serum enzyme release and precordial R wave loss are reduced in patients treated early with intravenous beta blockers compared with control patients. However there is no evidence that left ventricular function is preserved by beta blockers. Very large multicentre trials have shown reduction in mortality among treated patients by about 15% when an intravenous beta blocker is given, suggesting that routine use would save 1 life for every 100-200 patients treated."
