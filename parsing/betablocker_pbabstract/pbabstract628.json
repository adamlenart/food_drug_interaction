    "0": "The antihypertensive efficacy of the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine was evaluated in a 12-center collaborative study during 6 months of treatment. Following an initial placebo period, 318 patients with supine diastolic blood pressures greater than 90 mm Hg were given nitrendipine 5 mg twice daily for 1 week; if goal blood pressure was not reached (supine diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg with a fall of at least 10 mm Hg), the dose was doubled, and if necessary it was doubled again after an additional week. By the end of titration, goal blood pressure had been achieved in 132 patients (43%). During the subsequent 5 months of study, 155 patients continued to take nitrendipine alone; their post-titration supine diastolic blood pressure was 85 +/- 7 mm Hg, and at the end of the 6-month study it was 84 +/- 7 mm Hg. There were no changes in body weight or in heart rate. In 38 patients with a supine diastolic blood pressure of 95 +/- 9 mm Hg after titration, propranolol was added to the nitrendipine and decreased the supine diastolic blood pressure to 86 +/- 9 mm Hg by the end of the study; and in another 74 patients with a post-titration supine diastolic blood pressure of 93 +/- 7 mm Hg, addition of hydrochlorothiazide decreased the supine diastolic blood pressure to 86 +/- 7 mm Hg by the end of the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "Fifty-five patients suffering from essential or renal hypertension who had been insufficiently treated previously with combination therapy using diuretics and beta-blockers as well as reserpine, clonidine, prazosin, captopril, or minoxidil have been included in this open study. In addition to receiving diuretics and beta-blockers alone or in combination with reserpine, clonidine, or methyldopa, the patients were given nitrendipine in a dose of 2 X 20 to 2 X 40 mg/day. A normalisation of blood pressure values was attained in 46 of the 55 patients; 18 of these patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Few side-effects were observed. Dizziness and ankle oedema each occurred once. A rash occurred in one patient, causing the withdrawal of nitrendipine. No complaints of headache and palpitations were made. It may be concluded that nitrendipine is well suited as a partner in the combination treatment of patients with essential or renal hypertension that is difficult to stabilise.", 
    "2": "The efficacy and safety of nitrendipine in oral doses of 5-40 mg twice daily, alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (50-150 mg/day) and/or propranolol (40-120 mg/day), were evaluated in an open study of 50 patients with severe hypertension with supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) greater than 115 mm Hg. Forty-six patients with an initial mean supine BP of 190/120 +/- 21/8 reached 151/95 +/- 15/6 mm Hg at visit 9, and 40 patients with a baseline BP of 188/120 +/- 21/9 achieved mean BP of 142/87 +/- 15/7 mm Hg at the end of therapy (visit 16). Thirty (75%) of these patients were normotensive: 9 (22%) on nitrendipine alone, 3 (7.5%) on nitrendipine and hydrochlorothiazide, 7 (17.5%) on nitrendipine and propranolol, and 11 (27.5%) on triple therapy. In nine responders to nitrendipine alone, mean BP was reduced from 187/119 to 143/84 mm Hg. Mean standing BPs were similarly decreased. Initially, heart rate increased slightly but decreased to baseline at the end of therapy. Side-effects were generally mild to moderate and were attributable to vasodilatory effects of the drug. Three patients required drug discontinuation because of adverse effects. Addition of propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide was well tolerated. Nitrendipine (20-40 mg twice daily) alone or in combination with propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide offers an alternative therapeutic approach in the management of severe hypertension.", 
    "3": "To determine whether calcium antagonists might be used alternatively to beta-blockers in antihypertensive therapy, we investigated if monotherapy with oxprenolol (160-320 mg/day) and nitrendipine (20-40 mg/day) were equally effective on clinical casual blood pressure (BP), ambulatory BP monitoring (Remler), and BP during mental challenge (video game). In a prospective randomized long-term study, 60 white male civil servants (mean +/- SD = 43 +/- 6 years) with mild essential hypertension only were treated for at least 4 months. Average BP before therapy was 149 +/- 11/97 +/- 11 mm Hg. The antihypertensive effect was not different between the two groups (19/14 versus 21/12 mm Hg). Both groups did not differ in BP at rest, in BP during mental challenge (141 +/- 7/109 +/- 5 versus 146 +/- 9/112 +/- 8 mm Hg, NS), and average ambulatory BP monitoring at work (122 +/- 12/81 +/- 17 versus 132 +/- 14/79 +/- 17 mm Hg, NS), which was identical with the clinical casual BP. Thus, nitrendipine can effectively be used in long-term baseline antihypertensive monotherapy.", 
    "4": "The hemodynamic effects of nitrendipine have been studied at rest and during exercise in eight patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Acutely, nitrendipine (20 mg) induced at rest a decrease in arterial blood pressure (from 194/100 to 151/78 mm Hg) and an increase in heart rate (from 81 to 101 beats/min); the cardiac output was unchanged and the systemic vascular resistances fell by 30%. Similar changes were observed during exercise, i.e., a decrease in arterial blood pressure (from 245/106 to 204/87 mm Hg) and in systemic vascular resistances (-25%) with an increase in heart rate (from 133 to 142 beats/min). After chronic treatment during 55 days (average daily dose was 46 mg), the hypotensive effects of nitrendipine were similar, although less marked, both at rest and during exercise; the tachycardia noted after acute intake disappeared after chronic therapy. The addition of atenolol (100 mg) at the end of the chronic study in six patients further reduced arterial blood pressure at rest (138/80 mm Hg) and during exercise (180/91 mm Hg); the heart rate decreased to 60 beats/min at rest and 94 beats/min during exercise. These data show that nitrendipine is a potent antihypertensive agent that induces an important fall in the systemic vascular resistances both at rest and during exercise; during chronic therapy, these antihypertensive effects were maintained while the reflex tachycardia disappeared. The addition of atenolol during chronic therapy contributed to the normalization of the resting and exercise arterial blood pressures in nearly all patients.", 
    "5": "The efficacy of nifedipine (40 mg), nitrendipine (20 mg), and acebutolol (400 mg) in reducing blood pressure at rest and during exercise was assessed in 35 hypertensive patients using a crossover study with 4-week treatment periods. In 20 patients, the antihypertensive effect of the combination of nifedipine and acebutolol was investigated. Both the calcium antagonists nitrendipine and nifedipine and the beta-receptor blocker acebutolol led to a significant (p less than 0.001) and almost identical reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures at rest. This was also the case with the diastolic blood pressure during and after work. Both calcium antagonists also revealed a significant (p less than 0.01; p less than 0.001) reduction in systolic exercise blood pressure; however, this effect was more pronounced with acebutolol. The additional use of nifedipine significantly enhanced the antihypertensive effect of acebutolol under resting conditions (p less than 0.05) but particularly during (p less than 0.01) and after (p less than 0.001) exercise. No adverse reactions to the monotherapy or to the nifedipine and acebutolol combination were found, in particular no effect on the PQ interval or the serum lipids. It is concluded that nifedipine and nitrendipine and their combination with beta-blockers appear to offer an alternative therapeutic approach in the management of arterial hypertension.", 
    "6": "This selective review of a few of the advances made in recent years indicates that we are entering a new era in cardiovascular pharmacology. Drugs with novel mechanisms of action, and modifications of existing drugs, are being developed in constantly increasing numbers. The clinical evaluation of these drugs will be an exciting but difficult challenge.", 
    "7": "Therapeutic research into secondary prevention after myocardial infarction has a disappointing cost-benefit record. Many unrecognised biological problems have complicated apparently simple clinical trials. Inadequacies in design have also contributed to the low rate of success in demonstrating a statistically convincing and clinically worthwhile prophylactic benefit of any of the drugs so far tested. The potential hazards of long-term preventive drug treatment have yet to be defined. The projected economic impact on the community of successful secondary prevention is not encouraging. In the present state of knowledge, arguments for the long-term prophylactic drug therapy of asymptomatic survivors of myocardial infarction are difficult to sustain.", 
    "8": "The strategy of primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) needs reconsideration. Recent results of trials of reducing the risk of CHD in those at moderate risk have been inconclusive and disappointing. More may be expected from intervention in those at high risk, and a selective policy is advocated. But, in those at high risk, it is usually necessary to give drugs in order to reduce the risk from hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. Many currently used and popular drugs have never been submitted to rigourous long-term testing of their safety, although it was only through formal clinical trials that the adverse effects of clofibrate and of thiazides were identified. More, not fewer, clinical trials are needed if we are to avoid new tragedies. A plea is made for the urgent establishment of drug data banks to permit accurate monitoring of changes in the incidence of commonly occurring diseases in relation to the increasing use of drugs for primary prevention of vascular diseases and for social convenience.", 
    "9": "Diuretics are recommended for initial antihypertensive therapy because of their low cost and lack of subjective side effects. Unlike alpha- and beta-adrenergic agents, however, diuretics frequently induce metabolic abnormalities that necessitate supplemental therapy and increased monitoring of clinical laboratory tests. These factors increase the total cost of diuretic therapy, making it comparable to that of the alpha- or beta-adrenergic drugs. We show that the total yearly costs of therapy, exclusive of office visits, for patients treated with any of these three classes of agents is approximately $175 to $250, regardless of the drug used. Diuretics are cost effective only in patients who do not require laboratory follow-up or supplemental therapy. Thus, the choice of a drug for initial therapy of hypertension may be based more appropriately on medical (particularly side effects and metabolic abnormalities) rather than financial considerations.", 
    "10": "Centrally acting agents and the beta-adrenergic antagonists represent two classes of antihypertensive agents recommended for initial monotherapy. Comparisons of the efficacy and safety of the centrally acting agent, guanabenz, with those of propranolol and pindolol in patients with mild to moderately severe hypertension, are reported. In the guanabenz versus propranolol study, mean supine blood pressure decreased by 19/15 mm Hg for 44 guanabenz-treated patients and by 17/15 mm Hg for 52 propranolol-treated patients who completed 6 months of therapy. In the guanabenz versus pindolol study, the mean decrease in supine blood pressure was 17/14 mm Hg for the 12 patients treated with guanabenz and 21/15 mm Hg for the 13 patients who received pindolol and completed 2 months of therapy. If the patients who discontinued therapy for drug-related reasons are considered, the percentages of patients with clinically satisfactory blood pressure reductions were 59% for the guanabenz group versus 62% for the propranolol group and 79% for guanabenz-treated patients versus 64% for pindolol-treated patients. Although adverse effects, including dry mouth, drowsiness, and weakness, were more common among guanabenz-treated patients, these effects generally were mild and became less frequent with continued therapy. The therapeutic efficacy and safety of guanabenz were similar to those of the two beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, propranolol and pindolol. Guanabenz therapy decreased serum total cholesterol (p less than 0.05), whereas propranolol therapy decreased HDL cholesterol (p less than 0.05). Thus, guanabenz did not produce serum lipid abnormalities that may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "There is increasing interest in initial therapy of hypertension with sympatholytic agents and the influence of antihypertensive therapy on cardiac and renal function. We treated 26 men with essential hypertension with either guanabenz alone (n = 14) or propranolol alone (n = 12) and assessed blood pressure and renal perfusion before and after 5-7 weeks of treatment. Cardiac performance was evaluated for the guanabenz-treated patients. Both drugs substantially reduced blood pressure without weight gain. During guanabenz therapy, glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow were preserved, with a fall in renal vascular resistance (from 12,100 +/- 1,500 to 9,300 +/- 1,190 dyne X s X cm-5, p less than 0.01). Propranolol decreased glomerular filtration rate (from 95 +/- 11 to 70 +/- 6 ml/min, p less than 0.05) without significant change in renal blood flow or renal vascular resistance. In guanabenz-treated patients, there was a decline in left ventricular mass (from 290 +/- 23 to 257 +/- 14 g, p = 0.067). Thus, both agents are effective initial therapy in hypertension. Guanabenz treatment also was associated with reduced renal vascular resistance and left ventricular mass.", 
    "12": "After reviewing the pharmacological and physiological basis for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) symptoms with alpha 1-adrenergic blockers, the authors analyze the clinical trials published in the literature. The indications, doses, side effects and contraindications for the alpha 1 blockers in the treatment of BPH are summarized.", 
    "13": "The venous concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine and changes in ventilation, respiratory gases, circulation and ECG were determined in 20 young healthy male medical students during standardized stepwise ascent to 6000 m in a low pressure chamber, once without (control) and once with beta-receptor blockade (propranolol). The results show that the plasma concentration of norepinephrine increased significantly as a result of hypoxic hypoxia. The moderate increase in epinephrine was, besides the minor but significant hypoxic influence, mainly due to psychic tension. Since beta-receptor blockade does not prevent the respiratory and circulatory adjustment, beta-adrenergic stimulation is not thought to be necessary at altitude. Propranolol, on the contrary, lowers the hypoxia-induced increase in cardiac output and diminishes the ECG changes, in particular the S-T depression, significantly. By antagonizing the effects of epinephrine and by its central effects, propranolol improves subjective tolerance to altitude, and, on the other hand, by economizing the cardiac work load, the objective ability to withstand oxygen want.", 
    "14": "The goal of this study was to synthesize biotinylated derivatives of alprenolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, and to determine whether these ligands could bind simultaneously to both avidin (a biotin-binding protein) and to the beta-adrenergic receptor. Such ligands would be useful for beta-adrenergic receptor localization and purification, since avidin can be covalently labelled with fluorescent or electron-dense markers or can be linked to solid supports for affinity chromatography. Three biotinyl derivatives of alprenolol were synthesized and characterized. Each derivative bound to avidin and also possessed high affinity for the duck erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptor. Two of the compounds, biotinyl-caproyl-cysteaminyl-alprenolol (BCCA) and biotinyl-dodecanoyl-cysteaminyl-alprenolol (BDCA) had the same affinities for the duck erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptor (membrane-bound or digitonin-solubilized) in the absence and presence of avidin. This indicated that high affinity complexes could be formed between the beta-adrenergic receptor and avidin using these bifunctional biotinyl-alprenolol ligands. In contrast, biotinyl-cysteaminyl-alprenolol (BCA), in which the distance between the biotin and alprenolol moieties was shorter, had greatly reduced affinity for the duck erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptor in the presence of avidin. Additional studies showed that BDCA, avidin-BDCA, and ferritin-avidin-BDCA were equally potent in inhibiting the isoproterenol stimulation of cAMP accumulation in intact HeLa cells. The data reported in this paper demonstrate the importance of an appropriate spacer sequence to allow correct apposition of the receptor and avidin molecules, and suggest that BDCA may be a useful probe for beta-adrenergic receptor localization and purification.", 
    "15": "We conducted a prospective randomized trial of propranolol for the prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding in 48 patients with cirrhosis of the liver. During a follow-up period of up to 21 months, 12 of 26 patients in the propranolol group and 11 of 22 in the control group had rebleeding from esophageal varices. There was no significant difference in rebleeding between the two groups. This contrasts with a previous report of the efficacy of propranolol in preventing recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding in alcoholic cirrhosis. The difference in results may be due to the inclusion in our study of patients with other causes of cirrhosis and more severe liver disease. Propranolol may not be indicated for the prophylaxis of variceal rebleeding in such patients, and we advocate that its use be limited at present to controlled clinical trials.", 
    "16": "In patients without heart failure and with exercise-induced angina pectoris, betablockers are still the treatment of choice. The pharmacological differences within the betablockers are of minor importance clinically. Patients with angina at rest, or with a considerably changing effort threshold, are suspect for additional coronary spasms. Here calcium antagonists, and possibly nitrates, should be given first. A combination of these three treatments often proves beneficial. Amiodarone, which in the beginning was only rarely used because of its complex pharmacokinetics, is now generally accepted as an effective and well-tolerated drug for angina. In unstable angina, medical treatment varies according to the differing clinical symptoms. In addition to immobilization and anticoagulation, prolonged pain attacks are treated with intravenous nitrates. If the symptoms persist, combination of antianginal drugs as described above, sometimes in high doses, is necessary in order to postpone selective coronary angiography and bypass operation by one to two weeks. Otherwise these procedures must be performed after intraaortic balloon pumping has been instituted.", 
    "17": "Dansylcadaverine, which structurally resembles the calmodulin antagonists W-7 and W-5, prevented the calmodulin dependent stimulation of 3':5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in vitro. Dansylcadaverine and trifluoperazine sensitized cells to Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A in apparently the same way, exept that 40 times higher concentrations of dansylcadaverine than of trifluoperazine was required.", 
    "18": "Seventeen patients in advanced premature labor (cervical dilatation greater than or equal to 3 cm and effacement greater than or equal to 50%) were randomized in a double-blind protocol to receive metoprolol (a beta 1-adrenergic antagonist) or a placebo in conjunction with intravenous and oral terbutaline (a beta 2-agonist) in an attempt to inhibit the side effects of terbutaline. Both groups of patients had a dose-related increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure. Laboratory studies revealed significant hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and acidosis during the intravenous terbutaline infusion, all of which normalized during oral terbutaline therapy. There were no significant differences in the cardiovascular or metabolic responses to terbutaline between the metroprolol and placebo patients. The mean delay in delivery was 5.7 days, with 59% of patients having delivery delayed for 48 hours or more. The mean prolongation time was shorter, but not statistically significant, for those patients receiving metroprolol. Despite the use of high-dose terbutaline, there were no significant complications of therapy. There was little efficacy of infusion dosages above 40 micrograms/min or repeated courses of intravenous tocolysis. Although recent reports do not recommend tocolysis in these patients, this study suggests that combined beta-mimetics and glucocorticoids may be the optimal care for patients in advanced premature labor, in particular, those with infants of very low birth weight.", 
    "19": "Perfusion of the isolated rat heart with Ca2+ concentrations exceeding 3 mM activated phosphofructokinase and phosphorylase, and decreased the concentration of cyclic AMP. Half-maximal activation of phosphofructokinase occurred at 5 mM-CaCl2; significant activation of phosphorylase did not occur until the concentration of CaCl2 exceeded 12 mM. The time course for the activation of phosphofructokinase at 12 mM-CaCl2 indicated that maximal activation occurred within 2 min; when the perfusion-medium Ca2+ concentration was re-adjusted to 3 mM, the phosphofructokinase activity returned to pre-activation values within 30 s. The addition of Ca2+ to extracts of heart did not activate phosphofructokinase. The activation of phosphofructokinase by sub-maximal doses of adrenaline and Ca2+ were not additive. The activation of phosphofructokinase by 1 microM-adrenaline + 10 microM-propranolol and by 1 microM-isoprenaline was inhibited by high concentrations of K+ (22-56 mM). The activation of phosphofructokinase by 1 microM-adrenaline + 10 microM-propranolol, 12 mM-CaCl2 and by 1 microM-isoprenaline was blocked by the slow Ca2+-channel blocker nifedipine. These findings suggest that both the beta- and alpha-adrenergic mechanisms for the activation of rat heart phosphofructokinase involve an increase in the myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. This increase may result from an inhibition of Ca2+ efflux or a stimulation of Ca2+ influx.", 
    "20": "Changes in isoprenaline-sensitive phospholipid methyltransferase were studied in hepatocytes isolated from juvenile, mature and adrenalectomized rats. Isoprenaline produced greater stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation in juvenile and mature adrenalectomized rats than in mature animals. Similarly, isoprenaline stimulated phospholipid methyltransferase in juvenile and mature adrenalectomized rats but had no effect in mature animals. Isoprenaline-mediated activation of phospholipid methyltransferase in adrenalectomized rats was time- and dose-dependent. In hepatocytes isolated from adrenalectomized rats incubated with [Me-3H]methionine or [3H]-ethanolamine the addition of isoprenaline increased the amount of radioactivity incorporated into phosphatidylcholine. The activation by isoprenaline of phospholipid methyltransferase was abolished by the beta-blocker propranolol and by insulin. These results indicate that rat liver the occupation of functional beta-receptors causes a stimulation of phospholipid methylation. It is suggested that, as reported previously, cyclic AMP activates phospholipid methyltransferase.", 
    "21": "We have investigated the effects and mechanism of action of propranolol and mepacrine, two drugs with local anesthetic-like properties, on phospholipid metabolism in rabbit iris and iris microsomal and soluble fractions. In the iris, propranolol, like mepacrine [A. A. Abdel-Latif and J. P. Smith, Biochim, biophys. Acta 711, 478 (1982)], stimulated the incorporation of [14C]arachidonic acid ( [14C]AA) into phosphatidic acid (PA), CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), the polyphosphoinositides (poly PI) and DG, and it inhibited that of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), triacylglycerol (TG) and the prostaglandins. Similarly, mepacrine, like propranolol [A. A. Abdel-Latif and J. P. Smith, Biochem. Pharmac. 25, 1697 (1976)], altered the incorporation of [14C]oleic acid, [3H]glycerol, 32Pi and [14C]choline into glycerolipids of the iris. Time-course studies in iris muscle prelabeled with [14C]AA showed an initial decrease in the production of DG and a corresponding increase in that of PA by the drugs, followed by an increase in accumulation of DG at longer time intervals (60-90 min). The above findings are in accord with the hypothesis that these drugs redirect glycerolipid synthesis by inhibiting PA phosphohydrolase. Propranolol and mepacrine stimulated the activities of DG kinase and phosphoinositide kinases and inhibited that of DG cholinephosphotransferase. The drugs had little effect on the activity of DG acyltransferase. It is concluded that propranolol and mepacrine redirect glycerolipid metabolism in the iris by exerting multiple effects on the enzymes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis. We suggest that these drugs could exert their local anesthetic-like effects by effecting an increase in the synthesis of the acidic phospholipids (PA, PI and the poly PI) and subsequently the binding of Ca2+- to the cell plasma membrane.", 
    "22": "Isoprenaline treatment of C6-glioma cells induced a fast decrease in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors as determined by binding of [3H]CGP-12177, which paralleled the decrease in the hormonally stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. The total number of receptors, as determined by binding of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol, did not decrease. Separation of the beta-adrenergic receptors on a sucrose density gradient showed that the decrease in the number of receptors detectable with CGP-12177 was due to a movement of the receptors from the plasma membrane to a vesicular cell compartment. By using both (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]CGP-12177 it is thus possible to differentiate between the total number of receptors and those present at the plasma membrane in an unfractionated cell lysate.", 
    "23": "In 34 men with essential hypertension the increase in blood pressure during static and dynamic exercise, after long-term antihypertensive medication, was investigated in a randomized prospective study. The patients were randomized to either hydrochlorothiazide or to atenolol. The exercise tests were performed after a mean treatment duration of 14 months. At this time, the entering blood pressure was significantly and equally lowered from 163/108 to 148/96 mm Hg with a mean dose of 71 mg hydrochlorothiazide and from 164/108 to 147/91 mm Hg with a mean dose of 144 mg atenolol. The heart rate was significantly lower under beta-blocker therapy (62 min-1) than with diuretics (78 min-1). There were no significant differences in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure rise between the two therapy groups during static exercise with the hand grip (33% of the earlier determined individual maximum for 2 min duration) and with the squatting technique (for 2 min). During dynamic exercise on the bicycle ergometer (50-100 W) the increase in the systolic blood pressure was significantly lower between 70 and 100 W, with a range from 12 to 28 mm Hg, in the beta-blocker group than in the diuretic group. There were no differences in diastolic blood pressure between the two therapy groups. Rate-pressure product as a parameter for the myocardial oxygen consumption and heart rate were significant lower in the beta-blocker group as compared with the diuretic group, at rest and during both kinds of exercise and at all exercise steps.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "An existing dedicated pharmacy computer system (MIDAS system, Alfred Hospital and Health Computing Services, Victoria) used primarily for pharmacy labelling and dispensing, has been rewritten for an in-house minicomputer, with enhancements that allow it to be used in budgetary predictions, drug use monitoring, therapeutic audit and as a research tool. An automatically updated hard copy record of individual patient prescription profiles is generated and represents a valuable addition to the patient medical record. Allied to automatic \"sorting\" and retrieval techniques, all patients on nominated drugs can be identified and their records examined for particular combination use. Current application to assessment of nifedipine- beta blocker use will be presented, as will an application to cimetidine audit. Prescriptions can be scanned and segregated in terms of numbers of prescriptions in addition to segregation in terms of a particular therapeutic agent. Initial application to audit has detected an unacceptable level of polypharmacy (more than 26% of all prescriptions involve greater than or equal to 5 items and more than 3% involved greater than or equal to 10 items). Statistical information on the volume and unit cost of outpatient prescribing allows a precise estimate of ongoing budgetary commitments, while trends in discharge medication profiles allow a basis for prediction of budgetary trends, particularly with respect to the use of recent additions to the formulary. The system allows for expansion at minimal cost with potentially revolutionary applications, for example, interactive prescriber education if and when \"on-line\" capabilities are developed. Cross-linking with relevant data-bases will allow a major expansion of applied research into therapeutic drug use and its consequences.", 
    "25": "C6 glioma cells were stimulated with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. The rate of cyclic AMP accumulation and lipid methylation increased. However, the elevated rate of lipid methylation did not affect the fluidity of the plasma membrane. It is concluded that lipid methylation is not responsible for making the plasma membrane more fluid during the beta-adrenergic response.", 
    "26": "We report three cases of propranolol overdose in two patients, both of whom suffered cardiovascular collapse after receiving an emetic compound in a hospital's casualty department. Such a collapse may be caused by vagal activity in the presence of sympathetic beta-blockade. We recommend the administration of atropine, which may increase vagal tone, before a patient receives an emetic compound, or undergoes gastric lavage or endotracheal intubation.", 
    "27": "Asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH) is the characteristic finding in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of chronic pressure overload on left ventricular hypertrophy and ASH in 34 patients with arterial hypertension. 15 patients (Group 1) showed normal blood pressure values (less than 140/90 mm Hg) under antihypertensive treatment but blood pressure remained elevated in 19 patients (Group 2) despite antihypertensive therapy. Left ventricular septal and posterior wall thickness, left ventricular internal diameter and systolic shortening of the internal diameter were measured in all patients by our standard technique. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly (p less than 0.001) elevated in Group 2 (164/98 mm Hg) as compared to Group 1 (128/84 mm Hg). Septal (1.7 versus 1.1 cm; p less than 0.01) and posterior wall thickness (1.2 versus 1.0 cm; p less than 0.01) as well as the septal/posterior wall ratio (1.4 versus 1.1; p less than 0.001) were significantly increased in Group 2 as compared to Group 1. Left ventricular internal diameter and systolic shortening of the internal diameter did not significantly differ between the two groups. ASH (septal/posterior wall ration greater than or equal to 1.3) was found in 10 patients of Group 2 (55%) and 1 patient of Group 1 (7%). It is concluded that asymmetric septal hypertrophy can be observed in one third of all patients with severe arterial hypertension. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy seems to be dependent on the duration and severity of hypertension and does not appear to be related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "28": "Two selective and sensitive methods for the quantitative analysis of butofilol in human plasma and urine are discussed. The first method is a gas chromatographic assay with electron-capture detection using extraction with toluene, several clean-up procedures and derivatization. The second method is based on high-performance liquid chromatography and a single extraction with dichloromethane. The two assay methods were applied to the determination of the same human plasma samples after administration of a single, oral 200-mg dose of butofilolol. A good correlation between the results (inter-laboratory comparison) is obtained, validating both techniques.", 
    "29": "The effect of dimethindene (DMI) on transmembrane potentials and contractile force was studied in atrial and ventricular myocardium of guinea-pigs. DMI reduced the maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax) without changing the resting potential in both preparations. In ventricular myocardium, DMI shortened the action potential duration and exerted a negative inotropic effect. In atrial muscle, the drug prolonged the action potential duration and induced a positive inotropic effect which could be antagonized with neither the alpha-blocker phentolamine, nor the beta-blocker pindolol, H1-blocker mepyramine and H2-blocker cimetidine. DMI had no effect on the slow action potentials induced by caffeine in K+-depolarized myocardial preparations. The drug consistently shifted the sodium inactivation curve to more negative membrane potentials. The results suggest that DMI has a quinidine-like membrane-stabilizing property, which may be due to its fast Na+ channel blocking activity. The differential inotropic action of the drug in atrial and ventricular myocardium is discussed.", 
    "30": "Specific beta-adrenergic receptors were characterized in rat ovary, using an in vitro receptor binding assay with [3H]dihydroalprenolol. The ligand was bound to a single class of saturable and high affinity receptors (dissociation constant = 3.5 nM and maximum capacity = 3.4 pmol/g tissue). In competition studies, the binding was stereoselective for the (-)-isomer of isoproterenol. Known beta-adrenergic agonists displaced the ligand from ovarian receptors with the following order of potency: isoproterenol greater than epinephrine much greater than norepinephrine, which is typical for a beta 2-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "31": "To determine whether epinephrine-induced hypokalemia is due to beta2-adrenoceptor stimulation, and whether hypokalemia can occur at physiologic concentrations of the agonist, epinephrine was infused into six normal volunteers at a rate of 0.1 microgram per kilogram of body weight per minute. The circulating epinephrine concentration was increased to 1.74 +/- 0.65 ng per milliliter, plasma potassium was reduced by 0.82 +/- 0.19 meq per liter, plasma insulin fell by 12 +/- 4 mU per liter, plasma renin activity was elevated, and tachycardia occurred. Isoproterenol infused at 0.02 micrograms per kilogram per minute caused similar tachycardia (25 beats per minute) and elevation in plasma renin activity (6.0 to 6.5 ng per milliliter per hour), but no hypokalemia. The difference in responses to the two catecholamines was ascribed to the relative beta2-selectivity of epinephrine. This hypothesis was tested in six subjects given infusions of epinephrine (0.05 micrograms per kilogram per minute) after administration of either 2.5 or 5 mg of ICI 118551--a selective beta2-receptor antagonist--or placebo. After placebo, epinephrine infusion elevated the circulating epinephrine concentration and reduced plasma potassium; hypokalemia was prevented by the beta2-antagonist. This drug only partially inhibited the rises in plasma renin and glucose and the shortening of systolic time intervals; there was no tachycardia. Fifteen-fold to 30-fold increases in circulating epinephrine concentration appear to cause hypokalemia by a specific beta2-receptor effect distinct from other actions of epinephrine. This phenomenon may be of physiologic importance after severe myocardial infarction, when similar increases in plasma epinephrine have occurred.", 
    "32": "A preparation of cardiac sarcolemmal membranes is described. These membranes exhibit 9-24-fold purification of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, potassium-stimulated nitrophenolphosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, adenylate cyclase, sialic acid content, and beta-receptor number. Sarcolemmal membranes have two classes of binding sites for the calcium entry blocker, bepridil, 70 X 10(12) high-affinity sites/mg, Kd 25-40 nM; and 30 X 10(15) low-affinity sites/mg, Kd 54-70 microM. Binding of bepridil to these sites appears responsible for inhibition of isoprenaline-stimulated and activation of fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase. Since basal adenylate cyclase activity is not influenced, bepridil must act not at the catalytic site, but by altering the interactions between beta-receptor and catalytic and regulatory components of adenylate cyclase.", 
    "33": "The present study was undertaken to determine if chronic administration and abrupt withdrawal of propranolol would induce supersensitivity to the chronotropic effects of isoproterenol in the conscious rabbit. Eight rabbits were pretreated with propranolol (40 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for one week. Dose-response curves were obtained one week prior to pretreatment and 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours after the last dose of propranolol. Isoproterenol (0.01 to 10 micrograms/kg) was injected via the marginal ear vein and heart rate was monitored continuously by recording the ECG. During the withdrawal period no significant rebound increase in basal heart rate was noted. Geometric mean ED50 values and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated and used as an index of potency. Twenty-four hours after withdrawal of propranolol pretreatment, the ED50 value for isoproterenol was significantly greater than control indicating continued surmountable beta-adrenoceptor blockade. In contrast, 72 hours after withdrawal, the geometric mean ED50 value was significantly less than control. The maximum chronotropic response to isoproterenol was not found to be different from control at any time during the withdrawal period indicating that a change in responsiveness was not induced. These data are interpreted as evidence of a true supersensitivity to the chronotropic effects of isoproterenol in the conscious rabbit following propranolol withdrawal.", 
    "34": "The role of the beta-adrenergic nervous and prostaglandin systems in vasodilator-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin system was studied in conscious rats. The plasma renin activity (PRA) response to intravenous hydralazine (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg body wt.) was compared to the PRA response following administration of similar doses of hydralazine to rats pretreated with either indomethacin (3 mg/kg body wt. i.v.) or indomethacin and propranolol (1 mg/kg body wt. i.v.). PRA increased significantly above control levels after each of the hydralazine doses. In rats pretreated with indomethacin, PRA did not increase with the 0.25 mg/kg dose of hydralazine; increased significantly with the 0.5 mg/kg dose but remained significantly lower than the PRA response in the absence of indomethacin; and increased with the 1 mg/kg dose to a level not significantly different from PRA in rats receiving only hydralazine. When rats were pretreated with indomethacin and propranolol, PRA did not increase significantly in response to either the 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg doses of hydralazine. Although a statistically significant increase in PRA was noted with the 1 mg/kg dose of hydralazine, the level of PRA achieved was very low and only 15% of that observed with the other two treatment regimens (i.e., hydralazine alone or indomethacin and hydralazine). These results demonstrate that vasodilator-induced renin release is only partially mediated via the prostaglandin system, that the degree of this control is related to the intensity of vasodilator stimulus and that renin release following administration of hydralazine can be attributed almost entirely to activation of the beta-adrenergic nervous and prostaglandin systems.", 
    "35": "The heart rate (HR), the cardiac output (Qc) and the coronary sinus flow rate (Qcs), the left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressures (LVSP, LVEDP), the femoral artery pressure (FAP) and the difference between the coronary arterial and coronary venous oxygen tension (DAVcO2) were measured in patients with stable coronary insufficiency without cardiac failure, before and 40 to 60 minutes after 2 or 3 mg of molsidomine (M). In 20 patients, these measurements were made in the basal state, in spontaneous rhythm (SP). In 8 of these patient, (including 3 receiving beta-blockers) the measurements were made during an atrial stimulation test (ST) and in 8 other patients, all receiving long-term beta-blocker therapy, the measurements were made during a cold test (CT). At the basal state in SR, a gradual reduction in the LVSP to 70% or less of its initial value was observed in the patients receiving 3 mg of M (2 of whom received beta-blocker treatment). The LVSP was immediately restored by vascular filling. In 16 patients, M decreased the LVSP, the LVEDP, the FAP, the Qc and the double product (DP = LVSP X HR). The DAVcO2 was unchanged. Qcs and MVO2 (MVO2 = Qcs X DAVcO2) were decreased. In the course of ST, the haemodynamic and coronary changes are similar to those seen in the basal state. During the Ct, the increase in the LVSP, FAP and DP was significantly reduced by M. The variations in Qcs and coronary resistance (FAP/Qcs) were also significantly different after M., with better metabolic regulation of the coronary circulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "A 60-year-old man presented with a unilateral mass involving the iris and ciliary body associated with iridocyclitis, which was refractive to both topical and systemic corticosteroid therapy. After a systemic work-up was negative, anterior chamber paracentesis and transcorneal biopsy were performed to rule out malignant melanoma and other tumors. The lesion proved to be an inflammatory lymphoid process, which resolved when systemic propranolol administration was withdrawn. Evidence for the possible role of propranolol in the induction of an intraocular inflammatory pseudotumor is presented.", 
    "37": "The technique of non-invasive blood pressure monitoring was used to compare the 24-hr control of blood pressure in 10 patients with essential hypertension taking either twice daily propranolol or a once daily long-acting formulation of propranolol (propranolol LA). Both drug regimes produced smooth control of blood pressure and heart rate through the 24 hours and significantly reduced blood pressure and heart rate on bicycle ergometry tests. There was no significant difference between the two treatments. The non-invasive oscillometric method of measuring 24-hr control of blood pressure provides an alternative to ambulatory intra-arterial monitoring.", 
    "38": "We attempted to detect and quantify the mechanical effects of change in right atrial pressure on the chronotropic properties of the cardiac pacemaker, when blood volume was altered in an isohaemic fashion by +/- 27% in 8 conscious rabbits. Under control conditions there was a strong negative association between heart rate and right atrial pressure, attributable to the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex. After deletion of the main afferent sources of reflex effects on heart rate, by denervating the arterial baroreceptors and chemoreceptors, there was an insignificant association between heart rate and right atrial pressure or arterial pressure. Then, in addition, the main neurohumoral effects on the cardiac pacemaker were eliminated by three different pharmacologic treatments: (1) the cardiac nerves were blocked by instilling 2% procaine into the pericardial sac, (2) cardiac beta-adrenoceptors and cholinergic receptors were blocked with intravenous propranolol and hyoscine methyl bromide, (3) the above treatments were combined with autonomic ganglion-blockade by intravenous pentolinium. The combination of cardiac afferent and efferent blockade (1 and 3) revealed a small but consistent positive association between heart rate and right atrial pressure of 1.3 and 0.7 beats/min/mmHg, respectively. With efferent blockade alone (2), there was a steeper positive association of 2.3 beats/min/mmHg. We conclude that in the conscious rabbit there may be a mechanical effect of right atrial pressure on the cardiac pacemaker, but that it is so small as to be of little importance under physiological conditions.", 
    "39": "Labetalol, an alpha and beta adrenergic blocking drug, was used during anesthesia for removal of a very large pheochromocytoma which was predominantly epinephrine secreting. The 70-year-old female patient suffered from angina pectoris and chronic bronchitis. A preoperative treatment including an alpha-adrenolytic drug was administered but beta-adrenergic blockers were avoided because of the risk of cardiac decompensation and bronchoconstriction. During the operation, hypertensive peaks were easily controlled by bolus injections of labetalol 20 mg. The removal of the tumor was followed by a transient moderate hypotension. Heart rate remained stable throughout the operation. No hemodynamic problems occurred during the postoperative period. With regard to this case, a summary of the literature concerning the properties of labetalol is presented.", 
    "40": "In the anterior chamber of the rabbit eye the following were determined: the rate of appearance, the inflow and the outflow of water under control condition and after pretreatment with timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution. In the aqueous humor HCO3(-), Na+, K+ content and pH was determined. Results suggest that timolol acts on the inflow (production) of aqueous humor.", 
    "41": "For the control of the antihypertensive efficacy and the long-term tolerance in 1970 156 stable essential hypertensives of the clinical stages I-III were stablized with propranolol (obsidan). After an observation of the course lasting at first one year 58% (n = 90) proved as propranolol responders, 72 of them could be led monotherapeutically over 10 years (maximum mean dose 157 mg/die). The permanent propranolol therapy caused a persisting decrease of blood pressure in the non-hypertensive region (RR less than 160/95 mm Hg) by systolically on an average--44 mm Hg and diastolically--22 mm Hg with an adequate mean reduction of the heart rate of 19% compared with the basis values. Under conditions of the bicycle ergometer (watt-degree test) a significant decrease of the mean values of heart rate and blood pressure depending on the load as well as the tension-time-index could be established; at the same time the physical work capacity increased on an average by 25 Watt. After an abrupt interruption of the chronic propranolol therapy (partial study in 29 hypertensives) blood pressure and heart rate again increased only relatively retardedly. In 10 cases a remaining normotension was observed during the therapy-free phase. There were no paradoxical reactions or discontinuation phenomena; altogether the number of side-effects was low. As a result of our 10-year study of the administration of propranolol the high value of the beta-receptor blockers as a basis medication is to be emphasized in the therapy of hypertension.", 
    "42": "Thirty-three patients with essential hypertension and two with symptomatic arterial hypertension (Stage I-III) were treated for about two years with the drug obsilazin containing 50 mg propranolol and 50 mg dihydralazin per tablet (the maximum average dose of each drug was 174 mg/day). In 18 patients (51.4%), the arterial pressure returned to normal; in 16 (45.7%) it dropped by more than 10% and one patient showed no response to the treatment. The decrease in systolic and diastolic pressure averaged 20%. The hypotensive effect of obsilazin lasted for several years, attended by no paradoxical reactions on the part of arterial pressure. In individual treatment-refractory cases, the hypotensive effect of obsilazin was strengthened by adding disostate into the treatment modality studied.", 
    "43": "The effects of a large amount of adenosine and ATP (100 to 3000 micrograms) were investigated on sinus rate and developed tension, using the isolated dog atrium which was perfused with arterial blood from a heparinized donor dog. Each of the substances used for study was administered into the cannulated sinus node artery of the isolated atrium. Adenosine caused monophasic negative chronotropic and inotropic effects in a dose-related manner. However, ATP induced two-peaked positive chronotropic phases during a long-lasting negative chronotropic phase, i.e., initially, brief positive (t-1) effects and secondarily, relatively longer positive chronotropic (t-2) effects. These responses were repetitively induced during the experiment. The t-1 and t-2 were not influenced by treatment with propranolol which significantly blocked the positive chronotropic effect of norepinephrine. Aminophylline treatment significantly suppressed t-2 but not t-1. Quinidine (100-1000 micrograms) did not affect either the t-1 or t-2. It is suggested that ATP-induced tachycardia in the dog is partially due to activation of the P1-purinoceptors named by Burnstock.", 
    "44": "The effects of long-term propranolol treatment on renal hemodynamics at rest and during submaximal physical exercise were evaluated in 15 mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive patients. After 3-month treatment propranolol induced a significant decrease at rest both of effective renal plasma flow (-17.1%) and glomerular filtration rate (-7.4%) and an increase of renal vascular resistances (+11.8%). These changes were irrespective of response to treatment, degree of beta blockade, age, or initial values of hemodynamic parameters. The beta blocker had an additive effect to physical exercise in reducing renal perfusion, but it did not induce any qualitative variation in the response of renal hemodynamics to exercise.", 
    "45": "The effect of intravenously administered nifedipine (7.5 micrograms/kg) on sinus node and atrioventricular (AV) node function was evaluated in 17 patients, 9 of whom had sinus node disease after autonomic blockade (propranolol 0.2 mg/kg and atropine 0.04 mg/kg i.v.). The patients' ages ranged from 18 to 77 years. After nifedipine there was a nonsignificant increase in the median values for sinus cycle length from 750 ms to 760 ms, for sinus node recovery time from 1150 ms to 1240 ms, for corrected sinus node recovery time from 440 ms to 460 ms, and for sinoatrial conduction time from 63 ms to 75 ms. Nevertheless, nifedipine produced a significant increase in the AV node refractory periods (median values): the effective refractory period lengthened from 300 ms to 305 ms (rate 100/min) and from 290 ms to 300 ms (rate 120/min) respectively. The functional refractory period increased from 380 ms to 400 ms (rate 100/min) and from 385 ms to 410 ms (rate 120/min) respectively. The Wenckebach period was significantly prolonged from 370 ms to 390 ms. We conclude, therefore, that in the absence of autonomic control intravenous administration of nifedipine exerts a mild depressive effect on AV node but not on sinus node function.", 
    "46": "A survey of the literature concerning the interaction of timolol and epinephrine in lowering intraocular pressure, and a study comparing the efficacy of timolol and dipivefrin (a prodrug of epinephrine) to that of timolol and pilocarpine are presented. These observations suggest that timolol-epinephrine therapy is less effective than timolol-pilocarpine treatment, although the former combination has clinical value in some patients, and it is possible that this can be enhanced when special schedules for drug administration are used.", 
    "47": "The ocular hypotensive effects of timolol and a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide or methazolamide) are partially additive; that is, concurrent administration of these drugs produces a clinically useful reduction in intraocular pressure which is greater than the effect of either medication alone, but less than the arithmetic sum of the effects of the individual drugs. Similarly, concurrent administration of timolol and a miotic agent (pilocarpine, carbachol, or echothiophate iodide) produces a clinically useful response in most glaucoma patients. In contrast, the ocular hypotensive effects of timolol and epinephrine are poorly additive. Only a minority of patients maintain a substantial, longterm reduction in intraocular pressure when timolol is added to a regimen of epinephrine or vice versa. Ophthalmologists prescribing timolol or epinephrine for patients receiving the other drug are urged to use a therapeutic trial to one eye for several weeks to determine the efficacy of concurrent treatment. The addition of timolol to the medical regimen of patients uncontrolled on maximum tolerated antiglaucoma therapy (a miotic agent, epinephrine and a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) reduces intraocular pressure substantially in one-third to one-half of the cases.", 
    "48": "The mechanisms of the secondary glaucomas and the actions and side effects of antiglaucoma drugs are reviewed. Based on these observations, the advantages of timolol, as compared to other medications, in the management of secondary glaucomas are discussed. To illustrate some of these advantages, a study is reported in which timolol is evaluated for control of the early intraocular pressure elevation after routine cataract surgery.", 
    "49": "We reviewed the effect of timolol in 89 eyes (50 patients) with various types of pediatric glaucoma. Systemic side effects were observed in two patients (4%). Intraocular pressure (IOP) effect of timolol could only be observed in 18 eyes of 11 patients. The average decrease of IOP was 30.7% at the last follow-up.", 
    "50": "In determining the role of timolol in the treatment of childhood glaucoma, the difficulties of conducting investigational studies in children and the possible delayed appearance of longterm side effects are real concerns. However, an equally important consideration is the fact that young children may face a lifetime of blindness from uncontrolled glaucoma. Timolol is not always successful in lowering intraocular pressure on a longterm basis in severe glaucoma, but it often does help in managing extremely difficult cases. In some respects, the results of using timolol in children are consistent with those achieved with severe adult glaucoma. Although experience with children under one year of age is still extremely limited, theoretical considerations would suggest that children might be particularly vulnerable to the known systemic side effects following local absorption, as well as to longterm side effects that are yet unknown.", 
    "51": "Timolol maleate, a nonselective beta blocker, has been associated with adverse reactions when administered topically or systemically. The current literature pertaining to timolol-related side effects and reports to the National Registry of Drug Induced Ocular Side Effects are reviewed. Knowing what side effects are associated with the systemic administration of timolol is helpful in predicting systemic side effects that may be encountered when timolol is administered topically.", 
    "52": "Intracellular electrical recordings were made from arterioles and venules of the cat gastric submucosa. Spontaneous rhythmic fluctuations of the membrane potential were recorded in 54% of the venular preparations. Arteriolar cells showed no spontaneous activity. Excitatory junction potentials were recorded in arterioles but not venules after single shocks to the perivascular nerves. The amplitude of the excitatory junction potential was decreased in the presence of alpha-blockers. Repetitive stimulation of the perivascular nerve caused a biphasic electrical response of venular smooth muscle cells. The depolarizing component was decreased by alpha-adrenergic blockade and the hyperpolarizing component by beta-blockade. Venules contracted in response to smaller depolarizations than did arterioles. The voltage threshold for contraction of venular cells was similar to that for arteriolar cells but the venular cells were significantly more depolarized at rest than were the arteriolar cells. The difference in resting potential provides an explanation for the difference in sensitivity to electrical input.", 
    "53": "K depletion leads to a selective loss of K from skeletal muscles, which is associated with a decrease in the number of [3H]ouabain binding sites. The significance of the nerve supply for these changes has been assessed in denervation experiments with K-depleted rats. In K-depleted rats (age 4-12 weeks) denervation led to a partial recovery of the K contents in soleus (46-77%), gastrocnemius (23%) and extensor digitorum longus (e.d.l.) muscles (19%) within 24 h. These effects were not prevented by beta-adrenoceptor blockade or mimicked by alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. In K-depleted rats the number of [3H]ouabain binding sites was not increased following denervation. In K-depleted rats 24 h of plaster immobilization of the entire hind limb caused 51% recovery of the total K content in soleus, whereas gastrocnemius and e.d.l. showed 49 and 16% recovery, respectively. Tenotomy for 3 h caused a rise in total K content of 33% in soleus muscles from K-depleted rats. Anaesthesia for 3 h increased the total K content by 23%. The recovery of K induced by denervation, immobilization in plaster, tenotomy or anaesthesia was associated with an equivalent decrease in Na content. Denervation performed before K depletion reduced the loss of K from soleus, but not from gastrocnemius and e.d.l. In both soleus and e.d.l. the number of [3H]ouabain binding sites, however, decreased to the same level as in the contralateral innervated muscles. Denervation reduced, but did not prevent, the increase in the number of [3H]ouabain binding sites seen after re-administration of K to K-depleted rats. It is concluded that the changes in Na-K contents seen after denervation in K-depleted rats are the outcome of cessation of muscle activity. The results give no support to the idea that the effects of K depletion on the K content and the number of [3H]ouabain binding sites in skeletal muscle are mediated by the peripheral nerves.", 
    "54": "The effects of both bolus injection and constant infusion of various levels of norepinephrine (NE) on the activity of single-carotid chemoreceptor nerve fibers was studied in pentobarbital-anaesthetized rabbits under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. All animals were paralyzed and artificially ventilated. The dominant effect of NE was to excite carotid body chemoreceptor fibers in a dose-dependent fashion. There was an inverse relationship between the effect of NE on afferent fiber discharge and arterial O2 tension at all levels of exogenous NE above threshold levels. Propranolol (PROP) in sufficient dosage abolished the chemoreceptor response to NE and also markedly reduced the chemoreceptor response to hypoxia. These results support suggestions that beta-adrenergic receptors may be an integral part of the O2 chemosensory mechanism. They also demonstrate a nonadditive interaction between the effects of NE and hypoxia on the chemoreceptor afferent fibers. A reduction in resting discharge levels after infusion of PROP further suggests that endogenous catecholamines may contribute to carotid body chemoreceptor activity even under normoxic normocapnic conditions.", 
    "55": "The binding of four secondary and tertiary amine drugs with local anesthetic activity (propranolol, tetracaine, lidocaine, procaine) to liposomes containing charged surface groups of different chemical composition has been investigated. Binding is determined by measurement of partition coefficients and of drug induced zeta potential changes of the liposomes. For propranolol 30% of the total amount of drug dissolved in phosphatidylcholine is located as protonated form in the liposome surface. Fifty percent of tetracaine and 13% of procaine contribute to the surface charges. Negative surface charges (phosphatidylserine) facilitate drug binding and drug protonization in the liposome surface. Positive surface charges (hexadecyltrimethylammonium) prevent the protonization of the drugs. Different chemical groups of single negatively charged phospholipids or of electrostatically neutral lipids have no significant effect on drug binding which proves that binding is not influenced by steric and bulky head group configurations. The drugs interact hydrophobically with the lipid phase in such a way that the drug amine protonizes in the presence of the negatively charged phosphate oxygen of the phospholipid. Hexadecanoic acid is located deeper within the liposome surface than other negatively charged phospholipids. Correspondingly the drug action is weaker and drug protonization is prevented.", 
    "56": "The positive inotropic effect of inosine in intact dog hearts was approximately halved by beta-adrenergic blockade with sotalol. The same result was obtained in dogs with chronic denervation of the heart, in which the sympathetic nerve terminals had degenerated. Therefore part of the positive inotropic action of inosine appears to be non-adrenergic. Inosine infusion caused supersensitivity of the positive inotropic effect over a wide range of doses of adrenaline. It is postulated that inosine may act by blocking the desensitising action of cyclic AMP on the reaction between calcium ions and the contractile proteins.", 
    "57": "Functional and organic psychoses have been reported in association with propranolol therapy. The authors report a rare occurrence of both types of psychoses in the same individual at two different times during propranolol therapy.", 
    "58": "Although clinically relevant, drug-protein interactions in the morbidly obese population have not been studied thoroughly. The objective of this study was to evaluate serum chemistry profiles and the degree of serum protein binding of propranolol, diazepam and phenytoin in the serum of four female, morbidly obese (greater than 190% of ideal body weight) and eight control female subjects. Serum triglyceride concentrations were higher and high-density lipoproteins were lower in the obese subjects than in the control group. Serum albumin and total protein concentrations in the obese were not different from controls. Unexpectedly, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations were doubled in the obese subjects (mean obese value 121 mg/100 ml vs 62.9 mg/100 ml for the control subjects). Obese subjects had a mean fraction unbound (fu) for propranolol of 0.086, which was significantly different from the controls (fu = 0.123). The binding of diazepam was decreased slightly in the obese subjects. The binding of phenytoin was similar in both groups. The altered serum chemistry of obesity may play a significant role in the drug management of the obese patient by altering drug-protein interactions.", 
    "59": "Fourteen patients with established hypertension followed a double-blind crossover-styled trial to study the effects of 100 mg/day atenolol compared to placebo. Atenolol was found to be an effective antihypertensive agent, reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Hypertensive patients appear to have increased in vitro platelet adhesion and aggregation. Atenolol significantly reduced platelet adhesion, but had little effect on aggregation. This may be important in contributing towards the now-recognised cardio-protective effect of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. Blood chemistry and haematological parameters were unchanged; but whereas plasma cholesterol and plasma triglyceride levels remained normal, there was a significant fall in plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Side effects were very few.", 
    "60": "The elimination of the cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol has been studied in 35 neonates by measuring drug concentration in cord blood and in blood obtained at 24 h by heel stab. Elimination rate was assessed by calculating the slopes of lines joining these two concentration points. The slopes had a mean of 0.043 h-1 (equivalent to a half-life of 16 h) and were normally distributed with 95% of values being in the range 0.02-0.066. There was no relationship between slope and neonatal weight or skinfold thickness, but most babies were at term and the range of these indices was narrow. Babies who developed a bradycardia had cord atenolol concentrations and slopes which did not differ significantly from those in babies without bradycardia. We conclude that atenolol elimination in the neonate is reduced when compared to adults. This prolonged elimination is consistent with the physiological characteristics of this age group and with previous observations on drugs eliminated by renal excretion.", 
    "61": "Ten healthy male volunteers performed maximal exercise tests on a bicycle ergometer. A control reading was obtained; at a second session propranolol 80 mg was given, and then placebo, 100 mg or 200 mg AQ-A 39 were administered in a randomised double-blind manner. At peak exercise, the heart rate averaged 191.6 beats/min during the control test, 185.8 beats/min after placebo, 172.4 beats/min with 100 mg of AQ-A 39 (-10%), 166.0 (beats/min) with 200 mg of AQ-A 39 (-13.4%); with 80 mg of propranolol, the heart rate averaged 132.8 beats/min and the workload accomplished was substantially lower than that accomplished with AQ-A 39 and placebo which remained the same as in the control test. No effect on blood pressure was observed. The rate pressure product was significantly reduced with AQ-A 39.", 
    "62": "The effect of timolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug on the clinical status, thyroid status and left ventricular function as measured by serial M-mode echocardiographic recordings was assessed in a double-blind randomised study in 18 hyperthyroid patients. A significant clinical improvement was documented after 2 weeks of timolol treatment compared with placebo. There was no evidence that timolol impaired peripheral monodeiodination of thyroxine (T4). There were significant increases in left ventricular fractional shortening (Fr. Sh.) and velocity of circumferential shortening (Vcf) as well as a significant decrease in the left ventricular systolic internal dimension (LVIDs) (all P less than 0.01) in the untreated thyrotoxic patients compared with a normal euthyroid control group. After timolol treatment (2/52) there were significant increases in LVIDs and LVIDd and a significant decrease in Vcf (all P less than 0.05). No further changes occurred after a further 2/52 treatment with carbimazole. The cardiac data suggest that both an augmented sympathetic drive and a direct effect of thyroid hormone on myocardial contractility are mediators of the haemodynamic changes in hyperthyroidism.", 
    "63": "Exercise-induced changes in the plasma levels of propranolol and noradrenaline were determined in nine volunteers. Total plasma propranolol levels were increased during submaximal treadmill exercise, with exercise-induced increments of 13 +/- 4% at 4 h after the last dose, 18 +/- 7% at 9 h and 41 +/- 5% at 16 h. Exercise-induced increments in plasma propranolol were observed after single as well as repeated doses. During exercise, increments in plasma propranolol were correlated temporally with changes in plasma noradrenaline. Exercise-induced increments in plasma noradrenaline were greater during propranolol administration than during placebo periods. The changes in plasma propranolol concentration during exercise may reflect a redistribution of propranolol at its site(s) of action.", 
    "64": "A 42-year-old normotensive woman developed a severe mental depression 6 months after an operation for intracranial aneurysm. The use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was judged to be of vital importance. By concurrent administration of intravenous hydralazine and propranolol before induction of anaesthesia the normally occurring ECT-induced blood pressure elevation was completely prevented, and the patient received a series of ten ECTs without complications.", 
    "65": "Ninety patients, divided randomly into three groups, received either no metoprolol, 50 mg or 100 mg metoprolol as an oral premedication. The electrocardiogram was monitored throughout the procedure. It was found that both doses of metoprolol significantly reduced the incidence of cardiac dysrhythmia.", 
    "66": "In helical strips of monkey cerebral and mesenteric arteries contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha, dopamine in low concentrations produced a moderate relaxation but in high concentrations produced a contraction from the level of relaxation. On the other hand, coronary, renal, and femoral arterial strips responded to dopamine with only a concentration-dependent contraction. Treatment with phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine potentiated the dopamine-induced relaxation seen in cerebral and mesenteric arteries and reversed the contraction in the other arteries to a relaxation. After treatment with phenoxybenzamine, relaxant responses to dopamine of cerebral, mesenteric, and renal arteries were almost identical, and, compared with those, the responses of coronary and femoral arteries were appreciably less. Relaxations induced by dopamine were not influenced by propranolol, atropine, aminophylline, cimetidine, and aspirin but were markedly attenuated by droperidol. Adenosine-induced relaxations were not affected by droperidol. It is concluded that dopamine preferentially relaxes monkey cerebral and mesenteric arteries, possibly via dopaminergic receptors. It appears that the dopamine-induced contractions mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors predominate over the relaxation in coronary, renal, and femoral arteries, and dopaminergic receptor function is greater in cerebral, mesenteric, and renal arteries than in coronary and femoral arteries.", 
    "67": "We investigated albumin and IgG concentrations in the aqueous humor of 41 patients before intracapsular cataract extraction (primary samples) and at the end of surgery (secondary samples). Albumin and IgG concentrations were determined in all samples by means of a quantitative fluoroimmunoassay. A short-term topical application of timolol in 24 eyes was associated with a significant increase in both proteins in the primary aqueous humor samples compared with 17 control samples (P less than .005). The ratios of albumin to IgG--even when corrected for serum levels--were not significantly different in the two groups. Timolol did not affect the change in these ratios in the secondary aqueous humor samples. Thus, we concluded that these findings were not caused by a breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier, but rather resulted from reduced aqueous humor flow and undisturbed protein filtration.", 
    "68": "Perifusion of dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells with pulses of the beta-adrenergic agonists isoproterenol and epinephrine resulted in a prompt, but brief, rise in growth hormone release. This effect was blocked by propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, but not phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist. These results, in conjunction with other recent reports, suggest that epinephrine may act directly at the anterior pituitary gland as a physiological growth hormone-releasing factor.", 
    "69": "Ventricular fibrillation was electrically induced in 60 rats and the effects of adrenergic stimulation ad blockade on the time taken to spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm were determined. Alpha adrenergic stimulation by norepinephrine and phenylephrine infusion shortened ventricular fibrillation from 3.21 +/- 0.42 (+/- S.E.M.) to 1.48 +/- 0.17 sec (P less than .001) and from 5.13 +/- 0.77 to 2.18 +/- 0.27 sec (P less than .001), respectively. Nonselective beta adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol prolonged the time to defibrillation from 1.65 +/- 0.20 to 7.01 +/- 0.95 sec (P less than .001), whereas beta-2 adrenergic stimulation with salbutamol produced no change. Alpha adrenergic stimulation antagonized the effect of a concomitant isoproterenol infusion (P less than .05). Alpha adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine prolonged ventricular fibrillation (P less than .001) whereas beta blockade with propranolol or metoprolol shortened the duration of fibrillation. It was concluded that these effects were due to direct stimulation and blockade of cardiac adrenergic receptors. These actions were associated with changes in ventricular refractoriness. Cardiac alpha adrenergic stimulation prolonged the ventricular effective refractory period and promoted spontaneous defibrillation. Beta adrenergic stimulation shortened the ventricular effective refractory period and prolonged the time to defibrillation.", 
    "70": "In 585 patients with a first acute myocardial infarction the maximum activity of heat stable lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) was correlated with mortality at three months. The patients participated in a double blind trial with metoprolol in acute myocardial infarction. In all patients not taking a beta blocker a highly significant correlation was found, but this was not evident in those who were. When patients with anterior or inferior infarctions treated with a placebo were analysed separately the correlation remained, as it did when the patients who were alive on the fourth day after the onset of pain were analysed separately. No correlation was observed between enzyme activity and three month mortality in these subgroups if only patients treated with metoprolol were included. In a subsample of only 171 patients it was found that the maximum activity of creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) and creatine kinase subunit B did not correlate with three month mortality regardless of treatment. Thus it is concluded that when a sufficiently large number of patients are investigated there is a highly significant correlation between the enzymatic estimation of infarct size and early mortality in acute myocardial infarction. This relation did not persist when patients treated with beta blockade were analysed.", 
    "71": "Excessive grooming was induced in male rats by two ip injections of physiological saline. This mild stressful procedure did not modify open-field locomotion in 5-min trials. Methysergide (15 mg/kg) and pizotifene (5 mg/kg), serotonergic blockers, selectively prevented the grooming response to saline without affecting locomotion. Haloperidol (.4 mg/kg) also prevented the excessive grooming. However, this dopaminergic blocker impaired locomotion. The alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists phentolamine (20 mg/kg) and l-propranolol (20 mg/kg) did not prevent the excessive grooming in response to saline and did not affect locomotion. The results suggest that some serotonergic pathways in the brain are involved in the grooming response to a mild stress and support previous findings on the role of dopaminergic systems on this activity.", 
    "72": "Propranolol is an effective drug for patients with angina and has been shown to favorably alter exercise ejection fraction and myocardial perfusion images in patients with coronary disease. A characteristic effect of propranolol is reduction in exercise heart rate (HR). Twenty men with coronary disease (10 with prior infarction), angina-limited exercise tests, abnormal myocardial blood flow distribution images (MBFDI) (201thallium) during exercise, and normal resting ejection fractions underwent treadmill exercise testing with imaging on three occasions. Control maximal exercise was performed initially with measurement of MBFDI. Propranolol, 40 mg by mouth four times a day, was administered for a week with exercise repeated to the same workload. A third study, with men off propranolol, was undertaken with exercise continued only to the HR obtained while the men were taking propranolol (submaximal exercise). All men had improvement in MBFDI while receiving propranolol (men without infarction +780 +/- 88 [average +/- SEM] normalized count rate difference between control and propranolol; men with infarction +724 +/- 73 normalized counts). Greater count differences were noted when control exercise and HR-controlled, submaximal exercise MBFDI were compared with a greater difference in men with infarction (+1094 +/- 89 normalized counts) than for men without infarction (+896 +/- 88 normalized counts). Results suggest that propranolol improves MBFDI during exercise in men with angina, but that submaximal exercise results in more normal MBFDI than does propranolol for exercise to the same HR.", 
    "73": "One of the major metabolites of propranolol (Inderal) is the O-glucuronide. In order to further study its disposition, possible metabolism, and contribution to the antihypertensive effect of propranolol, we have synthesized and separated the two diastereomeric propranolol O-beta-D-glucuronides (9a,b). These compounds were prepared by reaction of naphthol with epichlorohydrin and treatment of the resulting (2RS)-1'-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)naphthalene (2) with sodium azide to give (2RS)-1-(1'-naphthoxy)-3-azido-2-propanol (3). Alkylation of 3 with methyl (2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-1-bromo-1-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosid)uronate (4) gave methyl (2RS)-[1-(1'-naphthoxy)-3-azido-2-propyl-2\",3\",4\"-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D- glucopyranosid]uronate (5a,b). Reductive alkylation, followed by HPLC separation of the diastereomers, gave methyl (2R)- and (2S)-[1-(1'-naphthoxy)-3-(isopropylamino)-2-propyl-2\",3\",4\"-tri-O-acetyl- beta-D-glucopyranosid]uronate (6a,b). Hydrolytic removal of the acetyl and methyl protecting groups gave the free glucuronides, which were then converted to the sodium salts, 9a,b. The stereochemistry of the glycoside linkage was deduced from the 400-MHz 1H NMR spectra. The absolute configuration of the aglycon portion was determined after Glusulase hydrolysis by derivatization with (R)-(+)- or -(-)-alpha-methylbenzyl isocyanate and comparison of the HPLC retention volumes with those of derivatized reference (R)- and (S)-propranolols.", 
    "74": "Eight healthy men received single oral doses of 400, 800, and 1200 mg medroxalol and a single intravenous dose of 1 mg per kg body weight on four occasions separated by at least 2 wk. Plasma medroxalol concentrations were assayed up to 24 hr after each dose by a specific high-pressure liquid chromatographic assay. Urinary excretion of parent compound was determined as well. Following oral doses medroxalol reached peak plasma concentrations within 2.5 to 3 hr. The t 1/2 of the terminal decay phase was 11.1 hr. Mean apparent volume of distribution (aVD) was between 11.2 and 16.4 l/kg, and mean total body clearance (ClT) was between 0.73 and 0.99 l hr-1 kg-1. Mean urinary recovery of parent drug within 48 hr was 2.3%, 3.9%, and 3.6% after the oral doses compared to 8.2% after the intravenous dose. Bioavailability estimated from AUC was 27.2% after 400 mg, 31.3% after 800 mg, and 37.4% after 1200 mg by mouth. Since aVD, t 1/2, ClT, and urinary excretion did not differ significantly after the three oral doses, medroxalol kinetics appear to follow a dose-linear model.", 
    "75": "The possibility that hemodynamic and biohumoral factors may help predict the antihypertensive effectiveness of selective beta 1 blockers was investigated. The effects of 3 wk of treatment with two selective beta 1 blockers, metoprolol and atenolol, were observed in 54 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. No significant difference between the hemodynamic effects of the two drugs was found. The percent fall in systolic blood pressure induced by the two correlated strongly with the pretreatment values of the chronotropic response to isoproterenol and with the pretreatment values of cardiac output, heart rate, and plasma renin activity (PRA). There was no correlation between the decrease in systolic blood pressure induced and initial 24-hr urinary catecholamine output, total peripheral resistance, and plasma aldosterone. Percent fall in diastolic blood pressure correlated only with the pretreatment levels of PRA. Our results support the view that the hypotensive effect of beta 1 blockers are predictable on the basis of the pretreatment values of chronotropic response to isoproterenol, PRA, heart rate, and cardiac output.", 
    "76": "We examined the hemodynamic effects and kinetics of prenalterol, a new beta-adrenoceptor agonist, in 10 normal subjects. There is some doubt whether prenalterol is selective for beta 1 adrenoceptors in animals; therefore, we also compared its cardioselectivity with that of the nonselective agonist, isoproterenol, with respect to heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) responses after inhibition of cardiovascular reflexes with atropine, clonidine, and phentolamine. After intravenous (2.5 mg) and oral (10 mg and 100 mg) dosing, t 1/2 beta was 2 to 3 hr. Oral bioavailability averaged 33% and was independent of dose. Oral prenalterol, 10 mg and 100 mg, increased resting HR, systolic BP, and cardiac index by up to 27% but had no significant effects during graded exercise. Prenalterol infusions were calculated to attain steady-state plasma concentrations of 10, 20, and 40 ng/ml. HR and BP effects of the levels (10.8, 23.6, and 47.4 ng/ml) were compared with those of 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 micrograms isoproterenol. Before autonomic block, prenalterol increased HR by 10 bpm at the highest dose and mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 10 mm Hg. In contrast, HR rose and MAP fell after isoproterenol. After block, at the highest doses of prenalterol and isoproterenol, there was an average rise in HR of 42 and 27 bpm; BP was almost maintained after the former but fell by 33 mm Hg after the latter. Prenalterol is an inotropic drug that has the effects of a full cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist. Its inotropic effects are evident at doses that have little effect on HR because of the modifying effect of cardiovascular reflexes. The hemodynamic effects are most obvious at rest when sympathetic tone is low.", 
    "77": "The hypothesis that variability in metoprolol metabolism stereoselectivity is related to debrisoquin oxidation phenotype was tested in six extensive (EM) and six poor (PM) debrisoquin metabolizers. In EM, plasma AUCs for (S)-metoprolol were 35% higher than for (R)-metoprolol, whereas in PM, AUCs for (S)-metoprolol were lower than for (R)-metoprolol. AUCs for total metoprolol correlated with the ratio of (S)- to (R)-metoprolol AUC. The renal clearance of metoprolol was also stereoselective but to the same extent in both EM and PM. Findings suggest that the enzyme system responsible for polymorphic oxidation of the debrisoquin-type is stereoselective. The relation between log total metoprolol plasma concentration and response (beta-blockade) was shifted to the right in PM relative to EM, which is compatible with a difference in pharmacologic activity of metoprolol enantiomers. Kinetic predictions based on total drug measurements will tend to overestimate dynamic differences between EM and PM, but the magnitude of the error is relatively small, and, in absolute terms, there is a large difference in pharmacologic activity between the phenotypes (beta-blockade at 24 hr: EM = 5.3 +/- 5.6%; PM = 18.9 +/- 3.8%).", 
    "78": "Our aim was to determine possible stereoselectivity in the plasma binding of propranolol. Equilibrium dialysis with plasma from seven healthy subjects and a deuterium-labeled pseudoracemate of propranolol was used. Plasma binding of the propranolol enantiomers differed with the unbound fraction of (-)-propranolol (22 +/- 2%; mean +/- SE) being smaller than that of (+)-propranolol (25.3 +/- 1.9%). The (-)/(+)-propranolol ratio for the unbound fraction, a measure of the stereoselectivity, was 0.86 +/- 0.02. There was an inverse correlation between the unbound (-)/(+)-propranolol ratio in individual subjects and overall binding of (+/-)-propranolol, indicating greater stereoselectivity at higher total binding. To assess the site of the stereoselective binding to plasma proteins, the binding of (+)- and (-)-propranolol to human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and human serum albumin (HSA) was examined. The binding to AGP was stereoselective for (-)-propranolol with a (-)/(+)-propranolol ratio for the unbound fraction of 0.79 +/- 0.01, whereas (+)-propranolol was bound to a greater extent to HSA with a (-)/(+)-propranolol ratio for the unbound fraction of 1.07 +/- 0.01. Although these results demonstrate opposite stereoselectivity in the binding of (+)- and (-)-propranolol to AGP and HSA, the stereoselective binding of (-)-propranolol to AGP predominates in plasma. This stereoselective plasma binding of the (-)-enantiomer of propranolol could limit the access of this more active enantiomer to beta-receptors or other active sites. The uptake of propranolol by red blood cells was not stereoselective.", 
    "79": "The action of acetylcholine (10(-9)-10(-4) M) was investigated in isolated rabbit cardiac Purkinje fibers, using standard microelectrode recording of transmembrane potentials and two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. In nonstimulated fibers, acetylcholine hyperpolarized the diastolic membrane potential and slowed or suppressed spontaneous activity. The hyperpolarization was more pronounced in low potassium solutions and in depolarized fibers; it was less marked in the presence of cesium (2 X 10(-2) M), and was suppressed by barium (3-5 X 10(-3) M). In stimulated fibers, acetylcholine shortened the action potential duration and shifted the plateau level to more negative values; this effect was influenced little by the stimulation frequency and not by chloride removal from the perfusing solution. In voltage-clamped preparations, acetylcholine shifted the holding current in the outward direction at potentials less negative than EK, while it shifted the current in the inward direction at potentials more negative than EK. The changes induced by acetylcholine were concentration-dependent (apparent KM: 1.5 X 10(-7) M); they were mimicked by carbachol (10(-8)-10(-5) M) and blocked by atropine (10(-8)-10(-7) M). The time course of the effects was biphasic: a maximum was reached in the first minute after addition of acetylcholine; thereafter, the effect decayed to a steady value. On removal of acetylcholine, a transient inversion of the changes produced by acetylcholine was observed, the magnitude of which depended on the acetylcholine concentration used and on the duration of exposure to acetylcholine. This time course was not abolished by pretreatment with physostigmine (10(-6) M), manganese ions (2 X 10(-3) M), or with adrenoceptor blockers [propranolol (2 X 10(-7) M) and/or phentolamine (10(-7)-10(-6) M)]. The results show that rabbit Purkinje fibers are as sensitive to acetylcholine as atrial preparations. The changes produced by acetylcholine are suggestive of an increase in an inward rectifying potassium ion conductance and are mediated by muscarinic receptor stimulation. The secondary decay in the effects of acetylcholine and their inversion on washout can be explained by a desensitization mechanism if it is assumed that the acetylcholine-sensitive channel is already functional in the absence of acetylcholine and is modulated in its conductance and/or open state probability by acetylcholine.", 
    "80": "A double-blind investigation with parallel groups was carried out in three Danish neurological clinics to evaluate the effect of metoprolol (Beloc, Betaloc, Seloken) versus placebo in migraine patients. 71 patients were included; 62 completed the study. The following parameters were used in the evaluation: frequency of headache attacks, days with migraine, severity score (days X intensity), and the consumption of pain-relieving tablets. The results of the study show that metoprolol 200 mg in Durules (a controlled release formulation) once daily is more effective regarding all evaluated parameters than placebo and that metoprolol is well tolerated.", 
    "81": "A 32 year old woman who complained of exercise-induced chest pain was found to have widespread elevation of the ST segment of the electrocardiogram during exercise testing. Coronary angiography demonstrated no obstructive lesions and no evidence of coronary artery spasm despite ergonovine administration, bicycle ergometry and rapid atrial pacing. Exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy demonstrated no perfusion defects despite ST segment elevation. Radionuclide blood pool imaging revealed a slight decrease in ejection fraction with exercise. The available evidence raises the possibility of small vessel coronary artery disease, either structural or vasotonic, as a cause of this patient's symptoms."
