    "0": "Two opposing actions of CO2 on pulmonary vessels, vasoconstriction and vasodilatation, were studied in dogs, cats, ferrets and rats using isolated lungs or a lobe of lung in vivo. Both preparations were perfused at a constant flow rate so that changes in inflow pressure at constant outflow pressure represented changes in vascular resistance. Lungs were ventilated with 5-15 percent CO2 during hypoxic vasoconstriction in order to permit demonstration of dilatation and because the two stimuli frequently concur. During hypoxia CO2 caused further constriction, dilatation or a biphasic response. Only constriction occurred in dogs and only dilatation in rats. Constriction predominated in cats but dilatation sometimes occurred in later tests in isolated lungs and after a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. All three responses were seen in ferrets. The type of response did not depend on CO2 concentration. In rats dilatation turned to constriction after beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs. The vessels affected by dilatation could not be determined. Thus CO2 can enhance or diminish the action of hypoxia but the circumstances determining one or other action are not resolved.", 
    "1": "The results of long term oral therapy of cardiac arrhythmias in 43 patients successfully treated with propafenone are reported. The patients were treated for periods ranging between 1 month and 34 months with a mean of 13.4 months. The administered dose varied between 150 mg tds and 300 mg qds with an average daily dose of between 600 and 750 mg. The doses were decided on a body-weight basis with range of 6 to 17 mg/kg and an average of 12 mg/kg. Altogether 30 patients were successfully treated over a long period, sometimes in combination with other antiarrhythmic agents, particularly beta-blockers. 2 patients did not appear after some first controls. In 7 patients the drug was not effective, even when used in combination with others. 4 patients stopped the treatment due to side-effects. Further 18 patients complained temporarily of gastrointestinal and cerebral side-effects. Some Ecg changes were noted, particularly A-V conduction delays and spreading of the QRS-complex. We suggest that the clinically most important parameters for monitoring an antiarrhythmic regimen of propafenone are the patients's own history and Ecg-examination noting the PQ interval and particularly the width of the QRS-complex and long-term monitoring.", 
    "2": "Cytoplasmic (c) and mitochondrial (m) isoenzymes of aspartate aminotransferase (AAT, EC 2.6.1.1.) were isolated from rat heart extracts by electrophoresis in agar gel. Their pH optima and Km values were estimated; optimal conditions for estimation of the enzymatic activities are reported. Isadrine activated and adrenaline inhibited the cAAT activity. Noradrenaline did not affect the activity of both isoenzymes. Phentolamine, as contrary to obsidane which decreased the activity of both isoenzyme, activated the isoenzymes; the effect was partially decreased by obsidane. Phentolamine did not alter the noradrenaline effect on either mAAT or cAAT; it decreased significantly the free form of the mAAT activity only. Results of the experiments with administration of adrenomimetic drugs suggested that adrenaline and noradrenaline-isadrine had different sites of attachment through which they mediated their action on aspartate aminotransferase in rat heart mitochondria.", 
    "3": "1. The antiarrhythmic properties of 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy)propoxy-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril hydrochloride (opc-1085) were compared with those of propranolol and pindolol using various kinds of preparations for experimental arrhythmia in dogs. 2. Although OPC-1085 was the most potent drug to antagonize adrenaline-induced arrhythmia in animals anaesthetized with either pentobarbitone sodium or halothane, it was scarcely effective on ouabain-induced arrhythmia in pentobarbitone sodium anaesthetized animals. 3. When these compounds were administered intravenously to conscious dogs 24 h after two-stage ligation of the anterior descending artery, ectopic ventricular beats of coronary ligation-induced arrhythmia were reduced while regular sinus beats were simultaneously increased. 4. OPC-1085 was very effective on aconitine-induced arrhythmia in dogs anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium. The effective dose was similar to that of propranolol but about fifteen times less than that of pindolol. 5. It is concluded that different potencies among these beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists against various kinds of experimental arrhythmias cannot be simply deduced from any one of the following properties; beta-adrenoreceptor antagonism, intrinsic myocardial stimulation, local anaesthetic and so-called quinidine-like effects.", 
    "4": "Several experimental observations accumulated during recent years have suggested an active participation of the sympathetic system in the pathogenesis and maintenance of hypertension in various experimental models of hypertension. The evaluation of sympathetic tone by various indirect means in human hypertension has also revealed that the sympathetic system plays an important role in the maintenance of hypertension in a subgroup of the human hypertensive population. The study of circulating catecholamines, which appears to be the best and most reliable indirect means to evaluate the sympathetic activity in the human, at present, has indicated that 25 to 40 per cent of patients with essential hypertension are characterized by higher basal circulating catecholamines and by a higher sympathetic reactivity in response to postural changes. These hyperadrenergic patients are also characterized by a higher heart rate, heart contractility, cardiac index and probably by higher plasma renin activity. The identification of these patients as a separate entity is desirable since it is possible that the evolution of the hypertensive disease and the response to therapy differ in this group of patients. The study of these patients could lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of cardiovascular complications and to the development of more rational and efficient therapeutic approaches.", 
    "5": "The effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic agonists and antagonists on discharge of secretory product by the granular and mucous glands were examined in the red-spotted newt, Notopthalmus viridescens viridescens. Observations were made also on the South African clawed toad. Xenopus laevis, the grass frog, Rana pipiens, and the crested newt, Triturus cristatus. In contrast to the granular glands of the South African clawed toad and the grass frog, which were stimulated by alpha-adrenergic agents, those of the red-spotted newt discharge in response to acetylcholine, either in vitro when added to the Holtfreter's solution in which explants were incubated, or in vivo when injected subcutaneously. Granular glands of the crested newt were also dischared in response to subcutaneous injection of acetylcholine. Stimulation of the granular glands by acetylcholine was blocked by atopine but not by tubocurarie, indicating that the cholinergic receptors are muscarinic rather than nicotinic. The mucous glands of the red-spotted newt, on the other hand, did not discharge in response to either acetylcholine or to adrenergic agents.", 
    "6": "A convenient method of measuring initial rates of free fatty acid efflux from isolated adipocytes during triglyceride breakdown by hormone-sensitive lipase is described. The procedure is based on the dissociation of protons from carboxyl groups of free fatty acids. A recording pH meter is used to monitor H+ concentration in the medium continuously as an index of free fatty acid release. A stoichiometric relationship was demonstrated between proton release and extracellular free fatty acid concentration as determined by the 63Ni radioassay method of Ho (1970. Anal. Biochem. 36: 105-113). An acid pH (6.8) caused a reduction in proton release, which was immediately and completely reversed by raising the pH to 7.4.", 
    "7": "A double blind trial was undertaken to determine whether the addition of the beta-receptor blocker Betadrenol in two different doses to a lidocaine solution containing adrenaline could influence the exogenous and endogenous beta-adrenergic effects in the field of dental interventions under local anesthesia. It could be shown that already very small amounts of the beta-receptor blocker Betadrenol could suspend beta-adrenergic stimulation of the heart and so prevent unwanted circulatory reactions without side effects on the central nervous system.", 
    "8": "The synthesis of the 1,1-disubstituted tetrahydroisoquinoline analogues, 1-methyl-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrochloride (2) and 1-benzyl-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrochloride (3), is described. The profile of beta-adrenergic activity for these analogues was determined and compared to that of trimetoquinol (1) in isolated guinea pig atrial, tracheal, and rat adipocyte preparations. Unexpected selective beta1-blocking activity in guinea pig trachea was noted with analogue 3. With the exception of 2 in guinea pig atria, 2 and 3 did not possess any beta-stimulant activity. Substitution at the 1 position of trimetoquinol (1) has revealed qualitative differences in beta-adrenergic activity.", 
    "9": "The effect of timolol, propranolol, epinephrine, and isoproterenol on intraocular pressure (IOP) (measured by tonometry) were compared after topical administration in conscious rabbits. Epinephrine and isoproterenol decreased IOP in normotensive rabbits, whereas propranolol had no effect. Timolol produced only a slight and inconsistent lowering of IOP in normotensive rabbits. All four agents reduced IOP elevated by an oral water load; the adrenergic agonists were substantially more active than the two beta-adrenergic blocking agents. In alpha-chymotrypsin-induced ocular hypertension, epinephrine, isoproterenol, and timolol were essentially equally effective, whereas propranolol exhibited only weak activity. In this latter model, timolol did not lose its effectiveness after multiple instillations (three/day) over an 8-day period. The concentration of timolol in the acqueous humor after topical application of effective hypotensive doses was relatively high as compared to that found in plasma. In addition, topical doses of timolol required to lower IOP were considerably greater than those needed to reduce or block the ocular hypotensive activity of isoproterenol. The mode of action and therapeutic implications of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in glaucoma are discussed.", 
    "10": "Some of the effects of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists on the adenylate cyclase system of human fat cell ghosts were studied. Isoproterenol, by causing about a fourfold increase of enzyme activity, was more potent than epinephrine and norepinephrine (about 2.5--3.0-fold stimulation). The beta2-adrenergic agonists salbutamol, terbutalin, and fenoterol were considerably less effective than the naturally occurring catecholamines. The stimulatory actions of isoproterenol and beta2-adrenergic agonists were competitively inhibited by the beta-blocking agent propranolol. Isoproterenol stimulation was also inhibited by the selective beta1-adrenergic antagonist practolol. This compound, however, was less potent than propranolol. The results are suggestive for an adenylate cyclase system in human fat cell ghosts coupled to beta1-adrenergic receptor sites. These receptors differ from the cardiac beta receptors with respect to practolol affinity.", 
    "11": "Dipivalyl derivatives of epinephrine, norepinephrine and isoproterenol were injected intravenously into conscious dogs while cardiovascular variables were monitored. The dipivalyl compounds produced cardiovascular effects that were comparable to those produced by their respective parent catecholamines except that the responses had a delayed onset and a prolonged duration. The catecholamines were more potent than their derivatives; norepinephrine was 28 times, epinephrine 15 times and isoproterenol 1.7 times as effective as their respective dipivalyl derivatives. Alpha or beta adrenergic responses to the dipivalyl compounds were attenuated or abolished after alpha adrenergic blockade (phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine), or beta adrenergic blockade (propranolol), respectively, or combined alpha and beta blockade. Since other evidence indicates that the dipivalyl derivatives themselves are inactive, our results suggest that these compounds act as prodrugs that exert their cardiovascular effects only after they are biotransformed to catecholamines.", 
    "12": "In order to study the function of adrenergic receptors in the submaxillary gland in vivo, rats were treated with the alpha-sympathicolytic, phentolamine (Regitin) and with the beta-sympathicolytic, propranolol (Dociton) and the protein, amylase, and isoamylase content of their submaxillary glands were investigated. The protein concentration rises after 3 weeks of alpha- as well as combined alpha- and beta-sympathicolysis while the amylase concentrations remain, on the whole, unchanged. The pharmacologically induced secretory inhibitions are being discussed in connection with the generally accepted receptor functions.", 
    "13": "A new beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drug (timolol) was used in two clinical studies. In the first double blind study administration of hydrochlorothiazide and timolol reduced the mean (formula: see text) blood pressure by 23 mm Hg, compared with a fall of nine mm Hg with administration of hydrochlorothiazide and a placebo. Plasma potassium (K+) levels fell with the administration of hydrochlorothiazide alone, but rose back to control values when patients were given timolol. In the second study (patient blind), Moduretic (hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg and amiloride, 5 mg) and timolol were given once daily. The mean blood pressure fell by 20 +/- 2 mm Hg allowing hypertension to be controlled by this once-daily regimen; the control persisted throughout the day. Plasma potassium (K+) levels fell slightly after treatment with Moduretic, but the fall was not as great as with hydrochlorothiazide. Of the 65 patients who entered these studies, 35 had not been previously treated and had diastolic blood pressure between 105 mm Hg and 130 mm Hg. In 18 patients the diastolic blood pressure was reduced below 95 mm Hg after treatment with a diuretic alone, in 15 patients treatment with a diuretic and timolol (5 mg to 20 mg) reduced the diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg. In two patients, the diastolic blood pressure was between 95 mm Hg and 100 mm Hg. The response achieved with a relatively simple therapeutic regimen that can be administered once daily suggests that the therapy of most hypertensive patients could be supervised by paramedical personnel.", 
    "14": "In 36 patients with essential hypertension the action and side effects of hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d), hydrochlorothiazide-triamterene (25 and 50 mg/d) and propranolol (160 mg/d) were investigated. Hydrochlorothiazide and hydrochlorothiazide-triamterene led to an average decrease of the systolic blood pressure by 21 and 30 mm Hg and of the diastolic pressure by 11 and 18 mm Hg. Propranolol alone decreased the systolic pressure by 35 mm Hg on average in 8 out of 16 patients. The diastolic pressure was lowered by 20 mm Hg. In the remaining 8 patients the systolic pressure, when propranolol was used alone, decreased by 21.3 mm Hg, the diastolic pressure by 11.3 mm Hg. Addition of hydrochlorothiazide-triamterene lowered pressures by a further 22.5 (systolic) and 10.6 (diastolic) mm Hg. No disturbances of the potassium or acid-base balance were observed using hydrochlorothiazide-triamterene.", 
    "15": "beta-Adrenergic antagonists injected into the amygdala complex of rats trained in a passive avoidance task produced time-dependent and dose-dependent decreases in retention of the task. In addition, the effects observed with beta-adrenergic antagonists were both stereospecific and reversed by norepinephrine. The results support a role for an amygdala beta-adrenergic system in memory processes.", 
    "16": "The availability of excellent short-acting and long-acting drugs for the treatment of angina pectoris needs to be emphasized. Properly used in conjunction with other measures such as the treatment of hypertension and a graded exercise routine, they provide, for most patients with angina, a tested therapeutic program that is remarkably effective, well-tolerated, appropriate for long-term outpatient use, and quite inexpensive.", 
    "17": "In rabbits long-term beta-adrenoceptor blockade did not cause any change in the morphology of individual organelles in the ventricular myocardium. There were, however, striking and significant changes in their relative distribution: (1) the relative volume of the mitochondria was reduced and was replaced by an equivalent relative increase in sarcoplasm; and (2) the relative volume of vascular elements was increased and the interfibrillar volume was decreased, so that the path from capillary to cell wall was reduced. The relative volumes of myofibrils and nuclei were unchanged. The doses used were well within the range used clinically, so that the results could be relevant to the efficacy of beta-blockers in angina pectoris, because the relative increase in capillaries and shorter diffusion pathway for oxygen could raise oxygen availability. The reduced rate of growth of the heart in young rabbits during beta-blockade may also be relevant to the treatment of infants with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy by beta-blockers.", 
    "18": "Sixty healthy male volunteers were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups on a double-blind basis: 1. Atenolol = 50 mg t.d.s. 2. Methyl dopa = 250 mg t.d.s. 3. Propanolol = 40 mg t.d.s. 4. Reserpine = 0.2 mg t.d.s. 5. Placebo. 6. Control = no tablets. Tests were carried out before treatment, 2 h after the first dose, after seven doses, and after 21 doses. Subjects performance on the Stroop Colour-Word Test was assessed in terms of (a) word reading speed and (b) an 'interference' score based on the difference between the incongruous colour word and colour card reading speed. No evidience was found of central effects of the beta-blockers, but personality X drug interactions were found, particularly in the reserpine group.", 
    "19": "Rats were kept on a 12-h light-dark cycle. One hour after the light was switched on, physiological saline, (+)-amphetamine 1 mg/kg, and H 77/77 5 mg/kg were injected s.c.; the number of groomings was counted 1-2 h after the treatments. (+)-Amphetamine and H 77/77 produced increased grooming which was antagonized by the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor H 44/68 (250 mg/kg), the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor FLA 63 (40), the neuroleptics haloperidol (0.1 and 0.5), and clozapine (1 and 5). The (+)-amphetamine-induced grooming was also antagonized by the NA-receptor blocker aceperone (10) but not by the sedative phenothiazines mepazine (10) and diphenhydramine (20) nor diazepam (1). These results indicate that NA-release is involved in the mediation of (+)-amphetamine- and H 77/77-induced grooming. The inhibition of haloperidol and clozapine is presumably due to NA-receptor blockade.", 
    "20": "The effect of beta adrenergic blocking agents on the renin release from the kidney and its possible role in the hypotensive effect of these agents were studied in patients with essential hypertension. Oxprenolol induced a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure and PRA, but the correlation between the decrease in blood pressure and the decrease in PRA was not found. When the effect of carteolol, another beta adrenergic blocking agent, was studied, a decrease in blood pressure was obtained, but there was a rise in PRA. These observations suggest that the hypotensive action of beta adrenergic blocking agents does not result from their effects on PRA.", 
    "21": "Hypertensive crises were reported in three patients with hypertension associated with underlying renovascular occlusive disease during reduction of antihypertensive therapy. In each case, rebound hypertension was observed during clonidine hydrochloride withdrawal. Therapy with propranolol hydrochloride and diuretics had also been discontinued in two of the three patients. This and other reports of rebound hypertension during clonidine withdrawal are contrasted with the absence of reports of this syndrome in the setting of cessation of beta-adrenergic blockade therapy. This suggests that the discontinuation of clonidine therapy was primarily responsible for the hypertensive crises herein described. It is further concluded that rebound hypertension may follow gradual as well as abrupt reduction of clonidine dosage, and that patients with renovascular hypertension may be at greatest risk.", 
    "22": "An inactive form of renin is activated by incubating human plasma at -5 degrees C. The relative proportions of active renin and this cryoactivatable \"prorenin\" in plasmas of untreated hypertensive patients varied widely. However, prorenin increased in parallel with active renin after sodium deprivation or diuretic therapy in 36 patients; the increases were similar whether or not blood-pressure fell. In contrast, propranolol administration in 22 patients lowered active renin in all, but it increased prorenin by 98% in 15 in whom systolic pressure fell. In the other 7 blood-pressure did not change, and beta-blockade produced a fall in total renin (active renin plus prorenin) while prorenin was unchanged. For all 22 there was an inverse relationship between propranolol-induced changes in plasma-prorenin and systolic pressure (r=-0-77, P less than 0-001). The fraction of active plasma-renin fell during propranolol administration from 43% to 18%, regardless of the blood-pressure response. Clonidine produced similar changes in 10 patients. Thus, sodium depletion stimulates total renin release, while propranolol and clonidine produce divergent responses of active renin and prorenin, the changes in prorenin depending on the changes induced in blood-pressure. These observations suggest that propranolol may block intrarenal conversion of prorenin to active renin while also suppressing total renin release. But the latter effect may be offset by concurrent baroreceptor-mediated release of total renin (mostly prorenin) when blood-pressure is lowered.", 
    "23": "Plasma renin concentration (PRC) was measured in 46 patients with essential hypertension before and after treatment for 4 weeks with alprenolol 600-1200 mg daily. In 27 of these patients PRC was measured after 4 weeks of combined treatment with alprenolol and hydralizine. During alprenolol treatment PRC and blood pressure were reduced, but the changes were not correlated. Alprenolol treatment caused similar blood pressure reductions in patients with high and low PRC, and the antihypertensive efficacy of beta-adrenergic blocking agents could not be predicted from the pretreatment PRC. When beta-adrenergic blockade was supplemented with hydralazine, blood pressure was further reduced, but PRC remained unchanged. Although a causal relationship between blood pressure reduction and suppression of renin, production might exist at low doses of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, the present study did not indicate such a relationship when higher doses were used. It was shown that alprenolol inhibited the increase in PRC usually induced by hydralazine, but it is not known whether this was important for the effectiveness of the fall in blood pressure produced by hydralazine.", 
    "24": "Twenty-four patients with mild to moderate hypertension were treated for up to 60 weeks with hydrochlorothiazide and either placebo, timolol, or timolol and amiloride. The effect of adding timolol and amiloride to hydrochlorothiazide was evaluated in a double blind trial. In 22 of the 24 patients a supine diastolic blood pressure below or equal to 95 mm Hg was produced by hydrochlorothiazide and timolol. Replacing a potassium supplement with amiloride increased the antihypertensive effect.", 
    "25": "Acebutolol, a new cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, has been evaluated for the treatment of hypertension. Thirty eight previously untreated male patients with essential hypertension received placebo treatment during a 4-week run-in period, and then they were randomly (double-bind) allocated either to continued placebo treatment for three 4-week periods or to treatment with acebutolol 400, 600, and 1200 mg daily, respectively, for three 4-week periods. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at the end of each 4-week period. Treatment with acebutolol produced statistically significant reductions in blood pressure and heart rate as compared to the placebo regimen.", 
    "26": "In a double blind study including 24 patients with essential hypertension the beta-blocking agent Timolol showed a mild antihypertensive effect. These patients had been pretreated with hydrochlorothiazid to which they responded already with a significant lowering of their blood pressure before Timolol was added. The effect of Timolol equals the effects of Pindolol and Alprenolol. We also found a suppression of the plasma-renin-activity under Timolol. This effect did not correlate with the degree of blood pressure reduction. There were no side effects noted except for a lowering of the pulse rate about which some of the patients complained and which is typical for beta blocking agents without intrinsic symphaticomimetic activity. According to our results this new beta blocking agent for antihypertensive therapy has very much the same properties as the other beta-blocking drugs already in use.", 
    "27": "Changes in catecholamine, c-AMP and lactate concentrations in the coronary circulation of man, during smoking, were studied in 12 patients. The heart rate increase from 63 +/- 2 beats/min (control) to 74 +/- 3 (smoking)(P less than 0.01), falling to 70 +/- 2 (10 min after smoking) (0.05 greater than P greater than 0.01), whilst coronary sinus c-AMP concentrations rose from 11 +/- 0.7 nmol/l (smoking) to 11.9 +/- 0.8 nmol/l (after smoking) (0.05 greater than P greater than 0.01; one tailed 't' test). There was no significant change in blood pressure, catecholamine or lactate concentrations. The study was repeated in eight of the patients following intravenous oxprenolol. Coronary sinus catecholamine concentrations increased from 4.1 +/- 0.7 nmol/l (control) to 5.5 +/- 1.1 nmol/l (after smoking) (0.05 greater than P greater than 0.01; one tailed 't' test), but heart rate and c-AMP concentrations remained unchanged, confirming that smoking-induced tachycardia is a result of a beta-adrenergic mechanism, at least part of which is due to a release of cardiac catecholamines. Arterial lactate concentrations increased only following oxprenolol from 0.74 +/- 0.07 mmol/l (control) to 0.83 +/- 0.09 mmol/l (smoking).", 
    "28": "The ultrasonic-Doppler technique is a very simple method for flow measurement. With this method the generally accepted mechanism of hepatic arterial flow increase after reduction or interruption of the portal vein flow could be confirmed. The increase was not related to cardiac output. Previous doubts about the portal vein flow behaviour after suppression of hepatic artery flow were decided, joining the little group of authors, who did not observe a variation of the portal vein flow in this condition. The concept of the autoregulation of the liver blood supply seems to be connected to the hepatic arterial system only. Although an increase of the hepatic artery flow after infusion of isoproterenol supports the existance of beta-receptors in the hepatic arterial system, it could be proved, that there was no reduction after propranolol infusion. This suggests, that autoregulation of the liver blood supply is not connected to the beta-receptors only.", 
    "29": "Effects of inosine on left ventricular contractile force, circumflex blood flow, heart rate, and arterial pressure were investigated in mongrel dogs. Infusion of 50 ml of 10, 25, or 50 mM inosine into the right atrium over 5 min produced arterial blood inosine concentrations of 20-120 microM. Infusion of inosine concentrations of 10 mM or greater produced statistically significant increases in contractile force and circumflex blood flow (P less than 0.05). The increases in contractile force and circumflex blood flow caused by 50 inosine were approximately 40% and 110%, respectively. No statistically significant increases in heart rate or arterial pressure were observed during infusion of inosine at any concentration. Administration of propranolol (2 mg/kg) in no way altered the effects of inosine on contractile force or circumflex blood flow. Thus, the present study suggests that inosine in concentrations which may be produced in the myocardium during stressful conditions causes a substantial effect on the inotropic state of the heart and that the effects of inosine are not mediated through adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "30": "Experiments performed on rats showed that insulin, when applied i.v. or s.c., inhibited the foot edema induced by carrageenin, thermic effect of 45.7 degrees C, compound 48/80 and 5-HT, but moderately increased the paw swelling evoked by kallikrein, a kinin-forming enzyme. The increased vascular permeability elicited by intradermal injection of histamine, 5-HT, bradykinin, PGE1, carrageenin and compound 48/80 was also suppressed. The anti-inflammatory effect was not significantly altered by propranolol and adrenalectomy on the thermal and carrageenin edema, it was variably inhibited on the skin test, and was completely abolished on the paw swelling induced by 5-HT and compound 48/80. Since insulin had little or no effect on the vascular response when given topically together with the vasoactive agents, its complex effect on the acute inflammation appears to be brought about via indirect mechanisms.", 
    "31": "A rapid GLC method for measuring plasma propranolol levels is reported. 4-Methylpropranolol was utilized as an internal standard. Pentafluoropropionate derivatives of propranolol and the internal standard eluted rapidly and gave good sensitivity under the conditions employed. The advantage of this procedure over previously reported methods is the speed of analysis, which is facilitated by rapid elution of contaminant peaks.", 
    "32": "Male spontaneously hypertensive rats were either fed a diet containing 3 mg/g of (+/-)-propranolol, giving a mean daily intake of 178 +/- 4.2 mg/kg, or a control diet from 7 weeks of age for 6 months. Three days after cessation of propranolol-treatment, the arterial blood pressure of the treated group was about 10% lower than that of the control group. Adrenal dopamine content and tyrosine hydroxylase activity were reduced to 76% and 71% of the control values, respectively. The results indicate that propranolol causes a reduced sympathetic discharge through its central action, although blockade of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated local regulatory mechanisms cannot be excluded.", 
    "33": "1 When the isolated thoracic aorta of the rabbit was contracted with prostaglandin F2alpha, 5-alkylpicolinic acids produced dose-dependent relaxations. 2 Picolinic acid, 2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid and 5-acetylpicolinic acid which do not have the 5-alkyl residue failed to relax blood vessels. 3 The vascular relaxation was dependent on the number of carbon atoms in the 5-alkyl compounds. 4 Relaxations which occurred with 5-alkylpicolinic acids were not affected by pretreatment with either propranolol or atropine. 5 It is concluded that the 5-alkyl residue is necessary for the vascular relaxation with 5-alkylpicolinic acid and that it was not produced by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors or cholinoceptors but rather through an activation of the basic process.", 
    "34": "1 The hypothesis that low temperature converts inotropic beta-adrenoceptors to alpha-adrenoceptors has been tested in isolated heart preparations of the frog and rat. 2 The results do not support the adrenoceptor interconversion hypothesis. In the frog ventricle strip lowering the temperature from 24 degrees C to 14 degrees C did not significantly alter the inotropic potency of the sympathomimetic drugs isoprenaline, adrenaline and phenylephrine and did not reduce the potency of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug propranolol as an isoprenaline antagonist. In the isolated left atrium of the rat lowering the temperature from 31 degrees C and 24 degrees C to 17-19 degrees C did not significantly alter the inotropic potency of isoprenaline, noradrenaline and phenylephrine, did not diminish the potency of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug propranolol and did not increase the potency of the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drug phentolamine. 3 Phenylephrine acted on alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in rat left atrium at 31 degrees C and 24 degrees C, but only on beta-adrenoceptors at 17-19 degrees C.", 
    "35": "Central hemodynamics at rest and during supine ergometer exercise have been studied in 12 hypertensive subjects and three healthy persons before and 20 min after 5 mg of intravenous propranolol. Cardiac output (CO) decreased by 19% at rest (p less than 0.001) and by 15% during exercise (p less than 0.001). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCP) during exercise rose after beta-blockade by 56% to 28 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); a similar increase could be observed in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and right atrial mean pressure (RAM). Brachial artery mean pressure at rest did not change significantly; during exercise this value was 6% below the pretreatment level (p less than 0.001). In order to evaluate the influence of digitalis on beta-blocker induced hemodynamic changes, measurements were repeated 30 min after administration of 0.6 mg beta-Methyldigoxin intravenously. After addition of digitalis, average PCP during exercise was significantly lower than after beta-blockade alone (22.8 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Likewise, PAP and RAM after digitalis were lower than after propranolol alone. CO did not change following digitalis administration. These findings indicate that digitalis partially counteracts the elevation of filling pressures induced by beta-blocking agents but leaves CO unchanged.", 
    "36": "The electrophysiological effects of acebutolol were studied in 12 patients. Heart rate and systemic arterial pressure were monitored. Plasma acebutolol levels were estimated. The first 6 patients (group A) received 0.3 mg/kg body weight I.V. The subsequent 6 patients (group B) received 0.5 mg/kg body weight I.V. Acebutolol delayed both antegrade and retrograde conduction through the AV node. The effect was greater in group B patients. Effective and functional refractory periods of the AV node were also increased after acebutolol. Intraatrial and intraventricular conduction and the effective refractory periods of the atrium and ventricle were not affected. Acebutolol did not alter significantly the sinus node recovery time or the QTc interval. Heart rate fell, especially where initial rates were fast. Systolic arterial pressure was lowered in group B patients. Peak mean levels of acebutolol were reached 5 min after injection of the drug. In the doses used, acebutolol, although well tolerated, failed to demonstrate electrophysiological evidence of a membrane-stabilizing effect and is therefore unlikely to add to the areas of success achieved by other beta-blocking drugs in the management of arrhythmias.", 
    "37": "1 We have measured the plasma concentration of acebutolol and a major metabolite in patients on chronic oral therapy with this drug, using a new assay, specific for each species. Our study suggests: 2 The acetyl metabolite was present in concentrations greater than those of acebutolol at all times during the dosing interval in all seven subjects. 3 The ratio of the mean steady-state plasma concentrations of the acetyl metabolite to unchanged acebutolol was 2.7 +/- 1.0. 4 Previous studies using non-specific methods that measure plasma concentrations of the acetyl metabolite and acebutolol as a single species cannot be used to determine pharmacokinetic parameters or to provide reliable correlations of plasma drug concentration with effect. 5 Future studies determining plasma concentration of acebutolol should take this metabolite into account. 6 Further work will be necessary to determine the metabolite's contribution to acebutolol's effects in man.", 
    "38": "A 70-year-old woman with angina pectoris developed a migrainous headache 3 days after starting oral propranolol. She had not complained of headaches since her second and third decade when she had suffered occasional attacks of migraine. It is likely that propranolol was the cause of her headache, since it recurred when she was rechallenged with the drug.", 
    "39": "This study was designed to assess the influences of cholinergic stimulation on coronary flow (CF), oxygen metabolism (MVO2) and contractility (MC) of the left ventricle in the newborn. Nineteen lambs, 1-7 days of age, were anesthetized with pentobarbital (20 mg/kg) and prepared for continuous measurement of CF, heart rate (HR), aortic (AP) and left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDP) pressures, dP/dt max, and cardiac output (CO). HR, AP, and CO could be controlled as desired. Simultaneous arterial and sinus blood samples were analyzed for O2 content, hematocrit, pH, PO2, and PCO2. LV MVO2 and %O2 extraction (Ext) were calculated. Acetylcholine (ACh) infusion (30-50 microgram/min-kg) caused an increase of LVEDP (4 cmH2O), but no significant change in dP/dt max or HR with constant AP and CO. CF increased by 44%, but MVO2 per beat was unchanged. Similar changes were observed with constant HR (pace). Suramaximal efferent stimulation of right or left vagus nerves produced bradycardia (77-68 beats/min) but no significant changes in contractility, CF, Ext, or MVO2. These findings were unaltered by beta blockade. The changes elicited by ACh infusion or vagal stimulation were abolished by giving atropine. It is concluded that although cholinergic sensitivity can be demonstrated, vagal stimulation does not importantly influence MC, CF, or MVO2 in the lamb. This may relate to incomplete development of the adrenergic system.", 
    "40": "The effect of short-term intravenous administration of procainamide (12 patients), propranolol (4 patients) and verapamil (4 patients) was studied in 12 patients with chronic recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia. In all patients tachycardia could reproducibly be initiated and terminated with programmed electrical stimulation of the heart. Procainamide (1) lengthened the effective refractory period of the right ventricle, (2) affected the tachycardia zone, (3) reduced ventricular rate during tachycardia, and (4) lengthened the interval between the tachycardia-initiating premature ventricular beat and the first QRS complex of tachycardia. No effect on the refractory period of the right ventricle or the mechanism of tachycardia was seen after administration of propranolol or verapamil. Apart from their therapeutic implications these data suggest that it may be possible to use drugs to study mechanisms of ventricular tachycardia in the human heart.", 
    "41": "The mechanism of the abbreviated atrioventricular (A-V) nodal conduction time and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in the Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome was evaluated in six patients. In each the A-H interval increased in response to rapid atrial pacing and atrial extrastimuli; typical dual A-V nodal pathways were demonstrated. In five patients studied at two cycle lengths prolongation of conduction and refractoriness of the \"fast\" pathway was noted at the shorter basic cycle length. Propranolol prolonged conduction and refractoriness of the \"fast\" pathway in three patients and in one produced Wenckebach conduction during atrial pacing which did not occur prior to its administration. In three patients the atrium did not appear necessary to sustain supraventricular tachycardia. These findings suggest that preferential rapidly conducting A-V nodal fibers and intranodal reentry are the responsible mechanisms in those patients with Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome and reciprocating tachycardia.", 
    "42": "In most arteriopathic patients, the release of a transitory ischemia in the affected limb reduces blood flow, instead of increasing it as in normal subjects. In this study the effects of propranolol administration on this paradoxical response have been investigated. After rheographic tracings were recorded in 14 arteriopathic patients in the basal condition and in the postischemic period, 10 mg of propranolol was administered IV and the protocol was then repeated. The blood flow in the affected area, measured as Jantsch's index of the rheographic tracings, was 0.63 +/- 0.04 in the basal condition and was reduced to 0.51 +/- 0.05 (P less than 0.001) in the postischemic period. When the ischemia was repeated after propranolol administration, Jantsch's index rose from 0.57 +/- 0.04 to 0.85 +/- 0.09 (P less than 0.01). The reversion of the paradoxical response to the ischemia induced by propranolol administration suggests that the beta-adrenergic blockade can increase blood flow to the ischemic area, probably through a constrictive action on arterovenous connections.", 
    "43": "Furosemide was shown to decrease inulin clearance in 20 of 27 normal subjects. The depression in inulin clearance occurred in both water-loaded and non-water-loaded subjects. The renal clearance of practolol, but not digoxin, was reduced when furosemide was given. The average total plasma clearances of gentamicin and of cephaloridine over a 6-hr period were decreased after furosemide. The reduced clearances of the antibiotics were associated with higher plasma levels, the increase in antibiotic concentration being as much as 100% at 1 hr after an intravenous bolus injection.", 
    "44": "Plasma catecholamines were measured by a modified single-isotope radioenzymic assay in five healthy medical students during and after a Finnish sauna bath with or without previous beta-blockade. The plasma noradrenaline rose more than twofold after 10 min in the hot room (100 degrees C) while the plasma adrenaline content exhibited smaller increases. The plasma noradrenaline concentration remained elevated or further increased after 5 min in a cool swimming pool (22 degrees C) whereas the exposure to cool water restored the plasma adrenaline concentration to resting values. Plasma noradrenaline, but not adrenaline, was still markedly elevated after a rest period of 15 min after the cool pool. Oxprenolol (40 mg) given 30 min before the sauna did not alter the plasma catecholamine pattern although it effectively lowered the heart rate before, during, and after the exposure to the heat stress.", 
    "45": "The effects of two beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs, the non-selective propranolol and the cardioselective metoprolol, on the concentrations of blood glucose, serum insulin (IRI) and growth hormone (GH) were studied in 8 healthy male volunteers both at rest and on exercise. The tablets of 160 mg of propranolol and 200 mg of metoprolol were tested against a placebo. The heart rate and systolic blood pressure were significantly lower during treatment with the active substances than with placebo. There were no significant differences between the blood glucose and serum IRI levels after the compounds and the placebo. A decreased insulin/blood glucose ratio after exercise was seen during metoprolol. The serum GH levels were of about the same magnitude after the three different treatments but the peak values were seen 30 and 40 minutes earlier after propranolol and metoprolol than after the placebo. The concentrations of the drugs in plasma did not correlate significantly with the changes in serum levels of IRI and GH in the exercise test. In the present acute test situation propranolol and metoprolol did not significantly affect glucose homeostasis and there were no apparent differences between the drugs.", 
    "46": "Carotid baroreceptor function has been studied in twenty-five patients with essential hypertension and in ten normotensive control subjects of corresponding age. The carotid baroreceptors were stimulated by increasing the transmural pressure over the carotid arteries by the application of negative pressure in a box enclosing the neck. Stimulation elicited significant decreases in intra-arterial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac index in both hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Both groups also showed a significant decrease in stroke index and a significant increase in total peripheral vascular resistance index. The response to carotid sinus stimulation did not differ significantly between the two groups. In fourteen of the hypertensive subjects, carotid baroreceptor function was studied after 4 months of saluretic therapy, mefruside, and in nine of these patients after additional treatment with a beta-receptor blocking drug, alprenolol, for another 4 months. Both mefruside and alprenolol induced a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure but the response to the carotid baroreceptor stimulation was not significantly altered. The findings indicate that the carotid baroreceptor is re-set to the actual blood pressure level, with little or no change in gain in hypertensive subjects both without and during hypotensive therapy.", 
    "47": "The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of selective beta-I-blockade on the exchangeable splenic platelet pool (ESPP). Therefore, 50 mg of metoprolol (a selective beta-I-receptor blocking agent) was given by mouth to three groups of subjects: (1) 15 healthy volunteers, (2) five asplenic subjects, and (3) 10 patients with different myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) with and without splenomegaly. The platelet count was determined 90, 150, 210, 270 and 330 min after the ingestion of the drug. In the group of healthy controls a significant increase (P less than 0.005) in the platelet count occurred and amounted to about 10% over baseline. The average peak value was reached at 150 min and the elevation in platelet count was maintained more than 4 h. An increase in the platelet count was also induced in patients with MPD, but the mean for the peak value only reached borderline significance (0.10 greater than P greater than 0.05). In the group of asplenic subjects no change in the platelet count occurred. It is concluded that acute oral administration of metoprolol causes a significant release of platelets from the ESPP. This platelet release is, however, no enhanced if the ESPP is enlarged.", 
    "48": "Hemodynamic studies were performed at two levels of dietary sodium intake (10 mmoles/day and 100 mmoles/day for 14 days) in a group of patients (with retained kidneys) on chronic hemodialysis. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone, plasma, and extracellular fluid (ECF) volumes were measured while the patient were at rest. Cardiac output, mean intraarterial pressure, and the calculated total peripheral resistance index were recorded while the patients were at rest and during acute \"total\" autonomic blockade. On the sodium diet of 10 mmoles/day, normotensive and hypertensive patients had similarly low total blood volumes, low-normal ECF volumes, and similar levels of plasma renin and aldosterone. The resting cardiac output was increased in both groups, but the total peripheral resistance was increased only in the patients with hypertension, in whom peripheral resistance was inappropriately high for the degree of anemia. Six hypertensive patients were studied on both diets. The resting mean arterial pressure was greater on the sodium diet of 100 mmoles/day than on the 10 mmoles/day diet, accompanied by increased in plasma volume, extracellular fluid volume, and cardiac output, but no change in peripheral resistance. During autonomic blockade on either diet, there was a marked fall in blood pressure in the patients with hypertension. This was mainly due to a fall in peripheral resistance which reached levels similar to those seen in the normotensive patients whose resistance was unaltered by blockade. Autonomic factors appear to contribute to the elevated peripheral resistance of hypertensive dialysis patients. In these patients, the effect of a high sodium diet, at least over the time-scale studied here, is to increase blood pressure and cardiac output, without the change in peripheral resistance expected from autoregulation.", 
    "49": "Visken (prindolol) was used in 42 patients. Its hypotensive effect was studied by the double-blind method. The hypotensive effect was encountered in 34 patients. With the administration of a placebo the arterial pressure became elevated, while after repeated prescription of the drug it again decreased significantly. Study of hemodynamics by radiocardiography in 18 patients treated with prindolol revealed no essential changes in the cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, rate of venous blood flow and volume of circulation.", 
    "50": "The vasodilator action of CV-705 was investigated in a number of vascular regions of anesthetized mongrel dogs and this action was compared with that of papaverine. When CV-705 was administered intravenously the vertebral, common carotid and internal carotid blood flow was increased considerably and was long-lasting. These effects were most remarkable among the regions tested. Femoral, aortic and coronary blood flow were also increased. On the other hand, the blood flow through superior mesenteric artery and portal vein increased only slightly. Renal blood flow was decreased slightly after an intravenous administration, whereas an increase was observed after an intra-arterial administration. Such a regional distribution of blood flow after CV-705 was quite similar to that observed with papaverine. CV-705 was well absorbed through the digestive tract. CV-705 given intravenously showed a weak hypotensive and positive chronotropic action. The increase in common carotid blood flow induced by intra-arterial administration of CV-705 was not affected by pre-treatment with atropine or triprolidine, but was partially suppressed by pre-treatment with propranolol. These results suggest that CV-705 has a papaverine-like action as well as a weak beta-adrenoceptor stimulating action, consequently a vasodilator action occurs.", 
    "51": "The comparative antiarrhythmic activity of quinidine, propranolol and the combination of these two drugs was studied in experimental atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in the dog. Quinidine, but not propranolol, suppressed atrial arrhythmias produced by topical application of aconitine to the atrium, as well as the ventricular arrhythmias that developed approximately 20 hr following coronary artery ligation. When the two drugs were coadministered, synergism occurred in the atrial arrhthmias but not in the ventricular arrhythmias. Some possible mechanisms of action of these drugs are discussed. The change in response to quinidine by coadministration with propranolol may have resulted in part from suppression of atrial automaticity in the aconitine experiments and from further slowing of ventricular conduction in the coronary artery ligation experiments. Both effects might have occurred as a result of myocardial beta adrenergic receptor blockade."
