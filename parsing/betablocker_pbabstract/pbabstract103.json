However, it is still disputed whether this is a class effect, and, specifically, whether carvedilol or bisoprolol are superior to metoprolol. The present study was a comparative effectiveness study of \u03b2 blockers for patients with HF in a population-based setting. We conducted an observational cohort study using the Quebec administrative databases to identify patients with HF who were prescribed a \u03b2 blocker after the diagnosis of HF. We used descriptive statistics to characterize the patients by the type of \u03b2 blocker prescribed at discharge. The unadjusted mortality for users of each \u03b2 blocker was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using the log-rank test. To account for differences in follow-up and to control for differences among patient characteristics, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the mortality. Of the 26,787 patients with HF, with a median follow-up of 1.8 years per patient, the crude incidence of death was 47% with metoprolol, 40% with atenolol, 41% with carvedilol, 36% with bisoprolol, and 43% with acebutolol. After controlling for several different covariates, we found that carvedilol (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97 to 1.12, p = 0.22) and bisoprolol (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.01, p = 0.16) were not superior to metoprolol in improving survival. Atenolol (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.87, p <0.0001) and acebutolol (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95, p = 0.004) were superior to metoprolol. In conclusion, we did not find evidence of a class effect for \u03b2 blockers in patients with HF.", 
    "1": "When using aqueous polymer dispersions for the preparation of controlled-release film coatings, instability during long-term storage can be a crucial concern. Generally, a thermal after treatment is required to assure sufficient polymer particle coalescence. This curing step is often performed under static conditions in an oven, which is a time-consuming and rather cumbersome process. Dynamic curing in the fluidized bed presents an attractive alternative. However, yet little is known on the required conditions, in particular: temperature, time, and relative humidity, to provide stable film structures. The aim of this study was to better understand the importance of these key factors and to evaluate the potential of dynamic curing compared with that of static curing. Recently proposed ethylcellulose:poly(vinyl alcohol)-poly(ethylene glycol) graft copolymer (PVA-PEG graft copolymer) dispersions were coated on theophylline and metoprolol succinate-loaded starter cores, exhibiting different osmotic activity. Importantly, processing times as short as 2h were found to be sufficient to provide long-term stable films, even upon open storage under stress conditions. For instance, 2-h dynamic curing at 57\u00b0C and 15% relative humidity are assuring stable film structures in the case of theophylline matrix cores coated with 15%ethylcellulose:PVA-PEG graft copolymer 85:15. Importantly, the approach is also applicable to other types of drugs and starter cores, and the underlying drug release mechanisms remain unaltered.", 
    "2": "Ivabradine is a selective I(f) current inhibitor in the sinus node that decreases heart rate without negative inotropic effects. We report the case of an 88-year-old diabetic patient with arterial hypertension and peripheral arterial disease who experienced an antero-lateral non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction following post-surgical anemia. After admission, the patient complained of anginal pain at rest with ischemic alterations of ST-T at the ECG and mild increase in troponin T levels. According to the clinical status, the association of ivabradine with beta-blockers was started. The addition of ivabradine reduced heart rate, improved symptoms (CCS class I-II) without modifying the main hemodynamic (non-invasively measured cardiac output, stroke volume and cardiac index) and echocardiographic parameters (left ventricular ejection fraction and aortic transvalvular gradients). In conclusion, the antianginal effect of ivabradine seems to be sure in very old ischemic patients with aortic stenosis.",

Forty-two percent of the PCPs participating in the survey had a free access to echocardiography whereas measurement of natriuretic peptide serum levels was freely available to 14% of PCPs. Pharmacological therapy for HF prescribed by the PCPs included in this survey included: diuretics (91%), inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (87%), digitalis (34%), beta-blockers (33%), aldosterone antagonists (23%). Drugs considered to potentially leading to major side effects were: digitalis (51%), beta-blockers (48%) and diuretics (47%), much less angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors (17%) and aldosterone antagonists (14%). Consultation with a cardiologist for starting beta-blocker treatment was judged mandatory by 57% of PCPs. Management of HF patients was considered sufficient by 70% of PCPs.

    "7": "During Alzheimer's Disease, sustained exposure to amyloid-\u03b2\u2084\u2082 oligomers perturbs metabolism of ether-linked glycerophospholipids defined by a saturated 16 carbon chain at the sn-1 position. The intraneuronal accumulation of 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine (C16:0 PAF), but not its immediate precursor 1-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine (C16:0 lyso-PAF), participates in signaling tau hyperphosphorylation and compromises neuronal viability. As C16:0 PAF is a naturally occurring lipid involved in cellular signaling, it is likely that mechanisms exist to protect cells against its toxic effects. Here, we utilized a chemical genomic approach to identify key processes specific for regulating the sensitivity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to alkyacylglycerophosphocholines elevated in Alzheimer's Disease. We identified ten deletion mutants that were hypersensitive to C16:0 PAF and five deletion mutants that were hypersensitive to C16:0 lyso-PAF. Deletion of YDL133w, a previously uncharacterized gene which we have renamed SRF1 (Spo14 Regulatory Factor 1), resulted in the greatest differential sensitivity to C16:0 PAF over C16:0 lyso-PAF. We demonstrate that Srf1 physically interacts with Spo14, yeast phospholipase D (PLD), and is essential for PLD catalytic activity in mitotic cells. Though C16:0 PAF treatment does not impact hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine in yeast, C16:0 PAF does promote delocalization of GFP-Spo14 and phosphatidic acid from the cell periphery. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, similar to yeast cells, PLD activity is required to protect mammalian neural cells from C16:0 PAF. Together, these findings implicate PLD as a potential neuroprotective target capable of ameliorating disruptions in lipid metabolism in response to accumulating oligomeric amyloid-\u03b2\u2084\u2082.",

The analysed compounds were extracted from human urine by means of solid phase extraction (SPE). The effective UHPLC separation of the examined compounds was applied on a Hypersil GOLD\u2122 (50 mm\u00d72.1 mm, 1.9 \u03bcm) column with a gradient mobile phase system and a UV detector. The complete separation of all analytes was achieved within 8.0 min. The method was validated for the determination of the aforementioned substances in human urine. The linear ranges, limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) for \u03b2-blockers, isoflavones and their metabolites were determined. The intra- and inter-day precision (%C.V.) was less than 4.48%, and the intra-day and inter-day accuracy was less than 4.74%.

We report here the effects of intracisternal (ic) administration of selective 5-HT(2A/2B) antagonists on the vagal bradycardia elicited by activation of the von Bezold-Jarisch reflex with phenylbiguanide. The experiments were performed on urethane-anesthetized male Wistar rats (250-270 g, N = 7-9 per group). The animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame and their atlanto-occipital membrane was exposed to allow ic injections. The rats received atenolol (1 mg/kg, iv) to block the sympathetic component of the reflex bradycardia; 20-min later, the cardiopulmonary reflex was induced with phenylbiguanide (15 \u00b5g/kg, iv) injected at 15-min intervals until 3 similar bradycardias were obtained. Ten minutes after the last pre-drug bradycardia, R-96544 (a 5-HT(2A) antagonist; 0.1 \u00b5mol/kg), SB-204741 (a 5-HT(2B) antagonist; 0.1 \u00b5mol/kg) or vehicle was injected ic. The subsequent iv injections of phenylbiguanide were administered 5, 20, 35, and 50 min after the ic injection. The selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonism attenuated the vagal bradycardia and hypotension, with maximal effect at 35 min after the antagonist (pre-drug = -200 \u00b1 11 bpm and -42 \u00b1 3 mmHg; at 35 min = -84 \u00b1 10 bpm and -33 \u00b1 2 mmHg; P < 0.05). Neither the 5-HT(2B) receptor antagonists nor the vehicle changed the reflex. These data suggest that central 5-HT(2A) receptors modulate the central pathways of the parasympathetic component of the von Bezold-Jarisch reflex.", 
    "19": "An increase in the area under the curve (AUC) after oral digoxin due to coadministration of drugs known as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors has been reported in several studies, but there is very little information on the rate of absorption after P-gp inhibition. Based on an inverse Gaussian density absorption model and using a population approach, the authors reanalyzed data showing an increase in oral digoxin AUC in healthy volunteers after coadministration of talinolol. The model fitted the data well, and the results revealed that the maximum rate of digoxin absorption increased nearly 2-fold, whereas bioavailability increased only by 21%. It is concluded that the increase in the rate of absorption seems to be a better indicator of intestinal P-gp inhibition than the increase in extent of absorption. Furthermore, the authors use a simulation study to demonstrate the ability of the method to estimate bioavailability based on the population characteristics of digoxin disposition kinetics obtained from a different group of healthy volunteers.",

    "28": "A 2-month-old female patient presented an extensive bilateral parotid hemangioma (PH) focally ulcerated. Additionally, hepatic ultrasonography revealed a hemangioendothelioma located at right lobe. She was treated with oral prednisolone (3\u2009mg/kg/day) during 10 months with clinical improvement of PH, despite failure to thrive and arterial hypertension. However, regrowth of the lesion occurred after discontinuation of oral steroid. Propranolol hydrochloride (2\u2009mg/kg/day divided into two doses) was then started and maintained for 16 months, with marked involution of the hemangioma and with no systemic side effects during treatment course. Curiously, also the liver hemangioendothelioma completely resolved after starting propranolol. PH is a threatening cervicofacial segmental hemangioma that frequently proliferates after the year of age and needs long-term treatment. On the other hand, hepatic hemangioendotheliomas may be associated with cutaneous hemangiomas in some patients and their natural history is similar to these, although patients may die of associated conditions. As for other infantile hemangiomas, propranolol proved to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for PH. Its role in liver hemangiomas and hemangioendotheliomas should also be taken into account.",

    "34": "The recent publication of several G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structures has increased the information available for homology modeling inactive class A GPCRs. Moreover, the opsin crystal structure shows some active features. We have therefore combined information from these two sources to generate an extensively validated model of the active conformation of the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor. Experimental information on fully active GPCRs from zinc binding studies, site-directed spin labeling, and other spectroscopic techniques has been used in molecular dynamics simulations. The observed conformational changes reside mainly in transmembrane helix 6 (TM6), with additional small but significant changes in TM5 and TM7. The active model has been validated by manual docking and is in agreement with a large amount of experimental work, including site-directed mutagenesis information. Virtual screening experiments show that the models are selective for \u03b2-adrenergic agonists over other GPCR ligands, for (R)- over (S)-\u03b2-hydroxy agonists and for \u03b2(2)-selective agonists over \u03b2(1)-selective agonists. The virtual screens reproduce interactions similar to those generated by manual docking. The C-terminal peptide from a model of the stimulatory G protein, readily docks into the active model in a similar manner to which the C-terminal peptide from transducin, docks into opsin, as shown in a recent opsin crystal structure. This GPCR-G protein model has been used to explain site-directed mutagenesis data on activation. The agreement with experiment suggests a robust model of an active state of the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor has been produced. The methodology used here should be transferable to modeling the active state of other GPCRs.", 
    "35": "An urgent need exists to assess the exposure of fish to pharmaceuticals. The aim of the present study was to assess the uptake and metabolism of waterborne pharmaceuticals in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). A further objective was to determine the possibility of monitoring exposure to low levels of pharmaceuticals by bile assays. Rainbow trout were exposed for 10 d under flow-through conditions to mixtures of five pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen, bisoprolol, and carbamazepine) at high and low concentrations. The low concentration was used to mimic the conditions prevailing in the vicinity of the discharge points of wastewater treatment plants. The uptake and the bioconcentration were determined by blood plasma and bile analyses. The average bioconcentration factor in plasma ranged from below 0.1 for bisoprolol to 4.9 for diclofenac, the values being approximately similar at low and high ambient concentrations. The biotransformation of diclofenac, naproxen, and ibuprofen was considered efficient, because several metabolites could be detected in concentrations clearly exceeding those of the unmetabolized compounds. The glucuronides were the dominant metabolites for all three pharmaceuticals. The total bioconcentration in the bile was two to four orders of magnitude higher than in the plasma. The results of this work show that the exposure of fish to pharmaceuticals in environmentally relevant concentrations may be monitored by blood plasma and bile analyses, the latter allowing detection at markedly lower ambient concentration.",

Vasorelaxation responses to the H(2)S donor NaHS and the H(2)S precursor L: -cysteine were examined by measuring isometric tone of mouse aortic rings in a small vessel myograph. H(2)S concentrations in Krebs' solution were determined with a polarographic sensor. H(2)S expression was examined by Western blot, and H(2)S production from CSE was assayed using a spectroscopic method. In pre-constricted mouse aorta, NaHS (1\u00a0\u03bcM-3\u00a0mM) elicited vasorelaxation of 95\u2009\u00b1\u20097%, EC(50) 189\u2009\u00b1\u200969\u00a0\u03bcM. This response was unaffected by removal of the endothelium. Maximum vasorelaxation was significantly attenuated by global blockade of K(+) channels (50\u00a0mM K(+)) and the K(ATP) channel blocker glibenclamide (10\u00a0\u03bcM) alone (P\u2009<\u20090.01, ANOVA). Specific inhibition of K(Ca), K(IR), or K(V) channels elicited a significant shift to the right in the concentration-response curve to NaHS (P\u2009<\u20090.01, ANOVA) without affecting maximum relaxation. NaHS-mediated vasorelaxation was inhibited by the Cl(-) channel inhibitor DIDS (1\u00a0mM, P\u2009<\u20090.05, t test), and NaHS caused a significant concentration-dependent inhibition of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (P\u2009<\u20090.001, two-way ANOVA). The H(2)S-producing enzyme cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (CSE) was expressed in mouse aorta and had activity of 7\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u00a0\u03bcmol H(2)S/g/min. L: -cysteine (1\u00a0\u03bcM-3\u00a0mM) elicited a CSE-dependent vasorelaxation of mouse aorta with intact endothelium (20\u2009\u00b1\u20097%), but not when the endothelium was removed. CSE inhibitors DL: -propargylglycine (20\u00a0mM) and \u03b2-cyanoalanine (1\u00a0mM) caused concentration-dependent contraction of mouse aorta. In mouse aorta, H(2)S elicits endothelium-independent vasorelaxation involving several different ion channels and seems to converge at the vascular smooth muscle cell voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel. The L: -cysteine-CSE-H(2)S pathway contributes to vasorelaxation and appears to modulate basal vessel tone.", 
    "37": "Nonselective \u03b2-blocker therapy and endoscopic variceal ligation reduce the incidence of variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotic adults, but their use in children is controversial. There are no evidence-based recommendations for the prophylactic management of children at risk of variceal hemorrhage due to the lack of appropriate randomized controlled trials. In a recent gathering of experts at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases annual meeting, significant challenges were identified in attempting to design and implement a clinical trial of primary prophylaxis in children using either of these therapies. These challenges render such a trial unfeasible, primarily due to the large sample size required, inadequate knowledge of appropriate dosing of \u03b2-blockers, and difficulty in recruiting to a trial of endoscopic variceal ligation. Pediatric research should focus on addressing questions of natural history and diagnosis of varices, prediction of variceal bleeding, optimal approaches to \u03b2-blocker and ligation therapy, and alternative study designs to explore therapeutic efficacy in children.",

Novel poloxamer gels containing CT-TPP complex formed in situ during the administration were prepared by mixing poloxamer-CT and poloxamer-TPP solutions in double syringes. The micellization and gelation of poloxamer 407 in the presence of chitosan and/or TPP were studied using differential scanning calorimetry and tube inversion; both additives were found to reduce the critical micellization temperature and critical gelation temperature of poloxamer aqueous solution. The poloxamer gels containing CT-TPP complex formed in situ were found to exhibit reduced dissolution rate and superior release characteristics with three different drugs--metoprolol, doxycycline and flufenamic acid. Furthermore, by varying the compositions of the two solutions independently, it is possible to control the pH in a way to suit the solubilization of a drug as well as the specific environment of a particular application site. By varying the concentrations of chitosan, TPP and poloxamer, the delivery system can be fine-tuned to afford gels with specific properties, ranging from nanoparticle suspensions to semisolid gels. These in situ gels have the potential to increase the utility of thermo-reversible poloxamers in drug delivery.", 
    "43": "The venom of the North African scorpion Androctonus amoreuxi (Aam) was analyzed using a combination of gel filtration, C18 reverse phase HPLC together with mass spectrometry analysis and bioassays. Three novel Birtoxin-like (BTX-L) peptides of 58 amino acid residues comprising three disulfide bridges were isolated and chemically characterized. One peptide, AamBTX-L3, induced serious toxic symptoms in mice and was lethal at nanogram quantities using intracerebroventricular injection. The three BTX-L peptides were tested in competition experiments on rat brain synaptosomes against the (125)I-labeled \"classical\" \u03b1- and \u03b2-toxins of reference, as well as with the (125)I-KTX, a voltage-gated potassium channel blocker. Only AamBTX-L3 was able to prevent the equilibrium binding of the \u03b2-toxin (125)I-Css IV to its receptor site 4 with a IC(50) value of 189 nM. Even if previous electrophysiological data allowed the classification of other BTX-L peptides among the \u03b2-type toxins, this report clearly shows that AamBTX-L3 is pharmacologically a \u03b2-toxin, which recognizes the voltage-gated Na(+) (Na(v)) channels from central mammalian neurons. In order to uncover the residues functionally essential for interaction between the AamBTX-L3 with the putative receptor site of (125)I-Css IV on Na(v)1.2, molecular models of the three novel Aam BTX-L molecules were made and their surfaces were compared to the already described Css IV biologically interactive surfaces. A hypothesis is given that in BTX-L3, three residues found in the \u03b1-helix play a key role during target binding.", 
    "44": "Cardiac autonomic neuropathy is a frequent complication of diabetes and often presents as impaired cholinergic regulation of heart rate. Some have assumed that diabetics have degeneration of cardiac cholinergic nerves, but basic knowledge on this topic is lacking. Accordingly, our goal was to evaluate the structure and function of cardiac cholinergic neurons and nerves in C57BL/6 mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Electrocardiograms were obtained weekly from conscious control and diabetic mice for 16 weeks. Resting heart rate decreased in diabetic mice, but intrinsic heart rate was unchanged. Power spectral analysis of electrocardiograms revealed decreased high frequency and increased low frequency power in diabetic mice, suggesting a relative reduction of parasympathetic tone. Negative chronotropic responses to right vagal nerve stimulation were blunted in 16-week diabetic mice, but postjunctional sensitivity of isolated atria to muscarinic agonists was unchanged. Immunohistochemical analysis of hearts from diabetic and control mice showed no difference in abundance of cholinergic neurons, but cholinergic nerve density was increased at the sinoatrial node of diabetic mice (16 weeks: 14.9\u00b11.2% area for diabetics versus 8.9\u00b10.8% area for control, P<0.01). We conclude that disruption of cholinergic function in diabetic mice cannot be attributed to a loss of cardiac cholinergic neurons and nerve fibers or altered cholinergic sensitivity of the atria. Instead, decreased responses to vagal stimulation might be caused by a defect of preganglionic cholinergic neurons and/or ganglionic neurotransmission. The increased density of cholinergic nerves observed at the sinoatrial node of diabetic mice might be a compensatory response.", 
    "45": "Activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a complex phenomenon. Here, we applied Induced Fit Docking (IFD) in tandem with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to generate hypotheses on the conformational changes induced to the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor by agonist binding, preliminary to the sequence of events that characterize activation of the receptor. This analysis, corroborated by a follow-up molecular dynamics study, suggested that agonists induce subtle movements to the fifth transmembrane domain (TM5) of the receptor. Furthermore, molecular dynamics also highlighted a correlation between movements of TM5 and the second extracellular loop (EL2), suggesting that freedom of motion of EL2 is required for the agonist-induced TM5 displacement. Importantly, we also showed that the IFD/LDA procedure can be used as a computational means to distinguish agonists from blockers on the basis of the differential conformational changes induced to the receptor. In particular, the two most predictive models obtained are based on the RMSD induced to Ser207 and on the counterclockwise rotation induced to TM5.",

Beta blocker utilization increased across all centers and surgeons participating during the study period, and increased in patients of low, medium, and high cardiac risk. However, the rate of POMI did not change over time (5.2% in 2003, 5.5% in 2008; P = .876), although a trend towards lower POMI rate was seen in patients on preoperative beta blockers (4.4% in 2003-2005, 2.6% in 2006-2008; P = .43). In multivariable modeling we found that age >70 (odds ratio [OR], 2.1), positive stress test (OR, 2.2), congestive heart failure (CHF; OR, 1.7), chronic beta blocker administration (OR, 1.7), resting heart rate <70 (OR, 1.8), and diabetes (OR, 1.6) were associated with POMI.

The compound SMe1EC2 is a new derivative of stobadine, with enhanced antioxidant properties compared to the maternal drug. Carvedilol, a non-selective beta-blocker, possesses besides its cardioprotective and vasculoprotective properties also an antioxidant effect. We compared the effect of carvedilol and SMe1EC2, antioxidants with a similar chemical structure, in two experimental models of oxidative stress in young and adult rat brain tissue. SMe1EC2 was found to improve the resistance of hippocampal neurons to ischemia in vitro in young and even in 18-month-old rats and inhibited formation of protein carbonyl groups induced by the Fe(2+)/ascorbic acid pro-oxidative system in brain cortex homogenates of young rats. Carvedilol exerted a protective effect only in the hippocampus of 2-month-old rats and that at the concentration 10-times higher than did SMe1EC2. The inhibitory effect of carvedilol on protein carbonyl formation induced by the pro-oxidative system was not proved in the cortex of either young or adult rats. An increased baseline level of the content of protein carbonyl groups in the adult versus young rat brain cortex confirmed age-related changes in neuronal tissue and may be due to increased production of reactive oxygen species and low antioxidant defense mechanisms in the adult rat brain. The results revealed the new pyridoindole SMe1EC2 to be more effective than carvedilol in neuroprotection of rat brain tissue in both experimental models involving oxidative stress.",

Deletion of micA or the two-component signal-transduction system, CpxAR, abolishes the phenotype. The hormone response is inhibited by the \u03b2-blocker propranolol.

Among M2 monocyte subpopulations, M2b monocytes (IL-17(-)CCL1(+)CXCL13(-)) are predominantly present in the peripheral blood of severely burned patients. In the present study, the rise and fall of M2b monocytes were examined in severely burned patients treated with propranolol. Catecholamine is known as an inducer of M2 monocytes, and propranolol is a competitive blocker of catecholamine binding to \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. Twenty-two children with 30% or more TBSA burn were enrolled in the study. Propranolol at a dose of 4 mg/kg/day was administered to these patients by feeding-tube or mouth. Burn patient monocytes exhibited weak bactericidal activity. IL-12 was produced by propranolol-treated patient monocytes after stimulation with Staphylococcus aureus antigen, and the production of IL-10, CCL1, CCL17, or CXCL13 by these monocytes was not demonstrated. These results indicate that a predominance of M2b monocytes in severely burned patients is intervened by the propranolol treatment. The increased susceptibility, to be associated with the appearance of M2b monocytes, of severely burned patients to opportunistic pathogens might be controlled by propranolol.",

For some patients, these tachyarrhythmias have important consequences including patient discomfort/anxiety, hemodynamic deterioration, cognitive impairment, thromboembolic events including stroke, exposure to the risks of antiarrhythmic treatments, longer hospital stay, and increased health care costs. We conclude that prevention of POAF is a worthwhile exercise and recommend that the dominant therapy for this purpose be \u03b2-blocker therapy, especially the continuation of \u03b2-blocker therapy that is already in place. When \u03b2-blocker therapy is contraindicated, amiodarone prophylaxis is recommended. If both of these therapies are contraindicated, therapy with either intravenous magnesium or biatrial pacing is suggested. Patients at high risk of POAF may be considered for first-line amiodarone therapy, first-line sotalol therapy, or combination prophylactic therapy. The treatment of POAF may follow either a rate-control approach (with the dominant therapy being \u03b2-blocking drugs) or a rhythm-control approach. Anticoagulation should be considered if persistent POAF lasts >72 hours and at the point of hospital discharge.

    "73": "The goals of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) arrhythmia management are to alleviate patient symptoms, improve patient quality of life, and minimize the morbidity associated with AF and AFL. Arrhythmia management usually commences with drugs to slow the ventricular rate. The addition of class I or class III antiarrhythmic drugs for restoration or maintenance of sinus rhythm is largely determined by patient symptoms and preferences. For rate control, treatment of persistent or permanent AF and AFL should aim for a resting heart rate of <100 beats per minute. Beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the initial therapy for rate control of AF and AFL in most patients without a history of myocardial infarction or left ventricular dysfunction. Digoxin is not recommended as monotherapy for rate control in active patients. Digoxin and dronedarone may be used in combination with other agents to optimize rate control. The first-choice antiarrhythmic drug for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with non structural heart disease can be any one of dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, or sotalol. In patients with abnormal ventricular function but left ventricular ejection fraction >35%, dronedarone, sotalol, or amiodarone is recommended. In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <35%, amiodarone is the only drug usually recommended. Intermittent antiarrhythmic drug therapy (\"pill in the pocket\") may be considered in symptomatic patients with infrequent, longer-lasting episodes of AF or AFL as an alternative to daily antiarrhythmic therapy. Referral for ablation of AF may be considered for patients who remain symptomatic after adequate trials of antiarrhythmic drug therapy and in whom a rhythm control strategy remains desired.",

We report that two miRNAs located on chromosome 17p13, miR-132 and miR-212, are over-expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissues. Both miRNAs are predicted to target the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, Rb1. Validation of this interaction was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay and western blot in a pancreatic cancer cell line transfected with pre-miR-212 and pre-miR-132 oligos. Cell proliferation was enhanced in Panc-1 cells transfected with pre-miR-132/-212 oligos. Conversely, antisense oligos to miR-132/-212 reduced cell proliferation and caused a G(2)/M cell cycle arrest. The mRNA of a number of E2F transcriptional targets were increased in cells over expressing miR-132/-212. Exposing Panc-1 cells to the \u03b22 adrenergic receptor agonist, terbutaline, increased the miR-132 and miR-212 expression by 2- to 4-fold. We report that over-expression of miR-132 and miR-212 result in reduced pRb protein in pancreatic cancer cells and that the increase in cell proliferation from over-expression of these miRNAs is likely due to increased expression of several E2F target genes. The \u03b22 adrenergic pathway may play an important role in this novel mechanism.", 
    "80": "The aims of this study were to explore the changes in expression of myocardial adiponectin (APN), changes in serum APN, and the significance of bisoprolol intervention in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) rats. An AMI rat model was established for the purposes of this study and was used for analysis of serum APN as determined by ELISA. Changes in expression of myocardial APN mRNA and APN protein in AMI rats were determined via reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Serum APN concentration and APN protein expression of the myocardium decreased significantly in the AMI groups compared with the sham operation group, with the lowest serum APN and APN protein expression on day 7 after AMI. On days 7 and 10 after AMI, the expression of myocardial APN mRNA in the AMI groups decreased significantly compared with the sham operation group. However, the APN mRNA increased on day 10 compared with that on day 7. Notably, there was an increase in levels of serum APN and myocardial APN expression after bisoprolol intervention. The expression of myocardial APN and serum APN decreased in AMI rats. APN may be an important protective factor against AMI. Bisoprolol can also protect against AMI because it increases APN expression.", 
    "81": "Nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2)-derived nesfatin-1 located in the brain has been implicated in the satiety and control of energy metabolism. Nesfatin-1 is also produced in the periphery and present in the plasma. It has recently been reported that NUCB2/nesfatin-1 is localized in pancreatic islet \u03b2-cells in mice and rats and released from islets. However, its function in islets remains largely unknown. This study examined direct effects of nesfatin-1 on insulin release from pancreatic islets and on cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in single \u03b2-cells from ICR mice. In the presence of 8.3 mmol/L glucose, nesfatin-1 at 10(-10)-10(-9) mol/L tended to increase and at 10(-8) mol/L increased insulin release from isolated islets, while at 2.8 mmol/L glucose nesfatin-1 had no effect. Furthermore, nesfatin-1 at 10(-10)-10(-8) mol/L increased [Ca(2+)](i) in single \u03b2-cells in the presence of 8.3 but not 2.8 mmol/L glucose. The nesfatin-1-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase and insulin release were inhibited by removal of extracellular Ca(2+) and by addition of nitrendipine, a blocker of voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2+) channels. Unexpectedly, the [Ca(2+)](i) responses to nesfatin-1 were unaltered by inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA) and phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)). These results indicate that nesfain-1 potentiates glucose-induced insulin secretion by promoting Ca(2+) influx through L-type Ca(2+) channels independently of PKA and PLA(2) in mouse islet \u03b2-cells.",

Systemically administered propranolol has been reported to increase, decrease, or not alter sweat production during exercise. To eliminate the confounding systemic effects associated with orally administered propranolol, we used iontophoresis to deliver it to the eccrine sweat glands within a localized area on one forearm prior to exercise. This allowed for determination of the direct effect of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockade on sweating during exercise. Subjects (n = 14) reported to the laboratory (23 \u00b1 1\u00b0C, 35 \u00b1 3% relative humidity) after having refrained from exercise for \u226512 h. Propranolol (1% solution) was administered to a 5-cm(2) area of the flexor surface of one forearm via iontophoresis (1.5 mA) for 5 min. A saline solution was administered to the opposing arm via iontophoresis. Each subject then exercised on a motor-driven treadmill at 75% of their age-predicted maximal heart rate for 20 min, while sweat rate was measured simultaneously in both forearms. Immediately after cessation of exercise, the number of active sweat glands was measured by application of iodine-impregnated paper to each forearm. The sweat rate for the control and propranolol-treated forearm was 0.62 \u00b1 41 and 0.60 \u00b1 0.44 (SD) mg\u00b7cm(-2)\u00b7min(-1), respectively (P = 0.86).

Etanercept, a blocker of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), is effective in the treatment of psoriasis. We aimed to evaluate the expression profiles of AMPs in psoriatic skin before and after a 6-week course of etanercept therapy. We included 12 psoriasis patients who underwent medium-dose etanercept treatment for 6weeks. At baseline and at the end of therapy immunohistochemistry from lesional skin was performed for psoriasin, LL-37, and human \u00df-defensin 2 (hBD-2). After 6-week treatment, the modified psoriasis area and severity index significantly decreased from 37.5\u00b15.9 to 14\u00b113.4. Lesional immunoreactivity scores of psoriasin, LL-37, and hBD-2 also significantly decreased after a 6-week course of etanercept.

Most of the ligands were inverse agonists for \u03b2(2) -adrenoceptor-cAMP signalling, although one (5217377) was a partial agonist and another a neutral antagonist (7929193). None of the ligands were efficacious with regard to \u03b2(2) -adrenoceptor-\u03b2-arrestin signalling. The (2S,3S) enantiomers were identified as the most active, although unusually the racemates were the most selective for the \u03b2(2) -adrenoceptors. This was taken as evidence for some unusual enantiospecific behaviour.",

The results substantiate the notion that \u03b2-blockers do more than simply inhibit receptor activation, and differences between the ligands could provide useful tools to investigate receptor biology.", 
    "88": "This article documents quantitative changes in the size of a periocular capillary hemangioma using sequential echographic testing in a patient receiving off-label treatment with systemic propranolol therapy. The patient presented at 7 weeks old with a right periocular capillary hemangioma. Systemic propranolol therapy was elected. Diagnostic B-scan and quantitative A-scan echography documented the lesion size at presentation as 22.3 mm in greatest dimension. The tumor decreased in size to 20.0 mm after 2\u00bd weeks of treatment and 16.0 mm after 6\u00bd weeks of treatment. No adverse side effects have been noted. Echography is an excellent modality for documenting the regression of periocular capillary hemangiomas during treatment with systemic propranolol.", 
    "89": "Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been linked to the pathogenesis of contractile dysfunction in heart failure. However, it is unclear whether ROS can regulate physiological cellular processes in the myocardium. Here, we characterized the role of endogenous ROS production in the acute regulation of cardiac contractility in the intact rat heart. In isolated perfused rat hearts, endothelin-1 (ET-1, 1nmol/L) stimulated ROS formation in the left ventricle, which was prevented by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin. N-acetylcysteine, the superoxide dismutase mimetic MnTMPyP, and apocynin significantly attenuated ET-1-mediated inotropic effect, which was accompanied by inhibition of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation. Moreover, the mitochondrial K(ATP) channel blocker 5-HD, and the mitochondrial large conductance calcium activated potassium channel blocker paxilline, but not the sarcolemmal K(ATP) channel blocker HMR 1098 attenuated the inotropic response to ET-1. However, ET-1-induced ROS generation was not abolished by inhibiting mitochondrial K(ATP) channel opening. In contrast to ET-1 stimulation, the positive inotropic effect of \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptor agonist dobutamine (250nmol/L) was significantly augmented by N-acetylcysteine and apocynin. Moreover, dobutamine-induced phospholamban phosphorylation was markedly enhanced by apocynin. In conclusion, NAD(P)H oxidase-derived ROS play a physiological role in the acute regulation of cardiac contractility in the intact rat heart. Our results reveal that ET-1-induced increase in cardiac contractility is partially dependent on enhanced ROS generation, which in turn, activates the ERK1/2 pathway. On the other hand, \u03b2-adrenergic receptor-induced positive inotropic effect and phospholamban phosphorylation is enhanced by NAD(P)H oxidase inhibition.", 
    "90": "Short-acting \u03b22-adrenoreceptor agonist (SABA) is the major asthma reliever as indicated in the GINA guidelines. Regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES) is a chemokine that attracts eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils toward site of allergic inflammation. Interferon \u03b3-inducible protein (IP)-10 is a Th1-related chemokine that is also important in asthmatic inflammation and also involved in our immune defense against pathogens. Bronchial epithelial cells are first-line barrier against invasive pathogen and also have immunomodulatory function. However, whether albuterol and fenoterol (two SABAs) have modulatory effects on RANTES and IP-10 expression in bronchial epithelial cells is unknown. The human bronchial epithelial cell lines, BEAS-2B cells, were pre-treated with different concentrations of albuterol, fenoterol or dibutyryl-cAMP (a cyclic AMP analog) before polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) stimulation. In some condition, BEAS-2B cells were pre-treated with ICI-118551, a selective \u03b22-adrenoreceptor antagonist, 30 min before albuterol or fenoterol treatment. The levels of RANTES and IP-10 were measured by ELISA. Intracellular signaling was investigated using cAMP assay, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB inhibitor, and western blot. Albuterol and fenoterol suppressed poly I:C-induced RANTES and IP-10 expression of BEAS-2B cells. ICI-118551 could partly reverse the suppressive effects of albuterol and fenoterol on RANTES and IP-10 expression. Albuterol and fenoterol increased intracellular cAMP levels. Dibutyryl-cAMP conferred the similar effects of albuterol and fenoterol. Western blot revealed that albuterol suppressed p-ERK, p-JNK and pp38, and also their associated kinase expression. Albuterol had no effect on pp65 expression. Albuterol and fenoterol could suppress poly I:C-induced RANTES and IP-10 expression in human bronchial epithelial cells via at least partly the \u03b22-adrenoreceptor-cAMP and the MAPK pathways, implicating that albuterol and fenoterol could exert anti-inflammatory effect and benefit asthmatic patients by suppressing RANTES and IP-10 expression. However, these suppressive effects of albuterol and fenoterol may inhibit the defense against viral infection.", 
    "91": "Fuzzy logic can handle questions to which the answers may be \"yes\" at one time and \"no\" at the other, or may be partially true and untrue. Pharmacodynamic data deal with questions such as \"Does a patient respond to a particular drug dose or not,\" or \"Does a drug cause the same effects at the same time in the same subject or not.\" Such questions are typically of a fuzzy nature and might, therefore, benefit from an analysis based on fuzzy logic.The objective was to assess whether fuzzy logic can improve the precision of predictive models for pharmacodynamic data.The methods and results were as follows: (1). The quantal pharmacodynamic effects of different induction dosages of thiopental on numbers of responding subjects were used as the first example. Regression analysis of the fuzzy-modeled outcome data on the input data provided a much better fit than did the unmodeled output values with r-square values of 0.852 (F-value = 40.34) and 0.555 (F-value = 8.74), respectively. (2). The time-response effect propranolol on peripheral arterial flow was used as a second example. Regression analysis of the fuzzy-modeled outcome data on the input data provided a better fit than did the unmodeled output values with r-square values of 0.990 (F-value = 416) and 0.977 (F-value = 168), respectively.Fuzzy modeling may better than conventional statistical method fit and predict pharmacodynamic data, such as, for example, quantal dose response and time response data. This may be relevant to future pharmacodynamic research.", 
    "92": "Beta-blockers remain a cornerstone of therapy in the management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association unstable angina/non-ST elevation myocardial infarction guideline revisions recommend a target heart rate (HR) of 50-60 beats per minute (bpm). Despite improved trends toward utilization of beta-blockers therapy, beta-blockers continue to be underdosed. Guideline-based tools have been shown to improve adherence to evidence-based therapy in patients with ACS. Implementation of a standardized ACS pathway would lead to titration of beta-blockers to recommended dosages with improved HRs in eligible patients. The ACS clinical protocol was implemented at the University of Toledo Medical Center in May 2007. A retrospective study of 516 patients admitted during a comparable 6-month period, before and after the institution of the protocol, was conducted. The preprotocol and protocol group included 237 and 279 patients, respectively. Patient information extracted from the medical records included age, gender, HR on admission, blood pressure on admission, duration of hospital stay, preadmission use of beta-blocker, type of beta-blocker and dosage, discharge beta-blocker and dosage, peak troponin levels, and therapeutic intervention. A target HR of less than 60 bpm was achieved in 19% of the protocol group, as compared with 6% in the preprotocol group (P < 0.001). The protocol group had a significantly lower mean discharge HR than the preprotocol group (67 vs. 74 bpm; P < 0.001). The mean discharge dose of metoprolol in the protocol group was noted to be significantly higher (118 vs. 80 mg/d; P < 0.001). The institution of an ACS clinical pathway led to utilization of beta-blockers in significantly higher dosages, resulting in improved HR control and increased attainment of target HR.", 
    "93": "The objective of this study was to evaluate in rats the potential utility of the nasal route to enhance central nervous system (CNS) delivery of drugs recognized by P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Well-known P-gp substrates verapamil and talinolol were perfused nasally or infused intravenously, and when plasma concentrations following intravenous infusion and nasal perfusion showed similar profiles. The concentration of verapamil in the brain after nasal perfusion was twice that after intravenous infusion. Although talinolol in the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid after i.v. infusion were below the detection limit, it was detected after nasal perfusion. When rats were treated with cyclosporin A, brain concentrations of verapamil after both administration modes were increased significantly, while those of talinolol were not significantly changed. Since the permeability of talinolol is low, talinolol in the brain which was transported directly from the nasal cavity has little chance of transport by P-gp localized in the apical membrane of cerebral microvessel endothelial cells. The potential for drug delivery utilizing the nose-CNS route was confirmed for P-gp substrates. The advantage of nasal delivery over i.v. delivery of talinolol to the brain was more significant than that of verapamil, suggesting that nasal administration is more useful strategy for the brain delivery of low-permeability P-gp substrates than the use of P-gp inhibitors.",

We hypothesised that breast cancer patients receiving beta-blockers for hypertension would show reduced metastasis and improved clinical outcome. Three patient subgroups were identified from the medical records of 466 consecutive female patients (median age 57, range 28-71) with operable breast cancer and follow-up (>10 years). Two subgroups comprised 43 and 49 hypertensive patients treated with beta-blockers or other antihypertensives respectively, prior to cancer diagnosis. 374 patients formed a non-hypertensive control group. Metastasis development, disease free interval, tumour recurrence and hazards risk were statistically compared between groups. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to model survival and DM. Beta-blocker treated patients showed a significant reduction in metastasis development (p=0.026), tumour recurrence (p=0.001), and longer disease free interval (p=0.01). In addition, there was a 57% reduced risk of metastasis (Hazards ratio=0.430; 95% CI=0.200-0.926, p=0.031), and a 71% reduction in breast cancer mortality after 10 years (Hazards ratio=0.291; 95% CI=0.119-0.715, p=0.007). This proof-of-principle study showed beta-blocker therapy significantly reduces distant metastases, cancer recurrence, and cancer-specific mortality in breast cancer patients suggesting a novel role for beta-blocker therapy. A larger epidemiological study leading to randomised clinical trials is needed for breast and other cancer types including colon, prostate and ovary.",

Pretreatment with calphostin C significantly decreased the proportion of sensitized neurons that generated action potentials in response to \u03b1,\u03b2-meATP. Recordings measuring VGSC activity in neuropathic neurons show significant change in amplitude and voltage dependence of sodium currents. In situ hybridization data indicate a dramatic increase in expression of embryonic Nav1.3 channels in neuropathic DRG neurons.

Exposure to a potentially life-threatening event such as military combat may be followed by PTSD. Despite recent advances in pharmacotherapy for PTSD, monotherapy with the currently available medications is only partially effective, as demonstrated in large clinical trials of combat veterans with PTSD. This underscores the need to investigate novel combination strategies to enhance treatment response in PTSD. The \u03b1-1 adrenergic receptor (AR) antagonist, prazosin, appears promising in recent studies for its capacity to reduce trauma-related nightmares (a group B night-time intrusion symptom) and insomnia (a group D night-time arousal symptom), while recent evidence supports using the \u03b2-AR antagonist, propranolol, to dampen the emotional content of traumatic memories (daytime intrusion symptoms including flashbacks, intrusive recollections of traumatic event, and heightened physiological reactivity/ responsivity to trauma reminders). In this review, we present data supporting the potential utility of combined drug regimen (prazosin and propranolol) acting through different noradrenergic mechanisms, with the potential to target more than one set of PTSD symptoms to optimize PTSD treatment.", 
    "139": "Marfan's syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition with an estimated prevalence of one in 10,000 to 20,000 individuals. This rare hereditary connective tissue disorder affects many parts of the body. The diagnosis of Marfan's syndrome is established in accordance with a review of the diagnostic criteria, known as the Ghent nosology, through a comprehensive assessment largely based on a combination of major and minor clinical manifestations in various organ systems and the family history. Aortic root dilation and mitral valve prolapse are the main presentations among the cardiovascular malformations of Marfan's syndrome. The pathogenesis of Marfan's syndrome has not been fully elucidated. However, fibrillin-1 gene mutations are believed to exert a dominant negative effect. Therefore, Marfan's syndrome is termed a fibrillinopathy, along with other connective tissue disorders with subtle differences in clinical manifestations. The treatment may include prophylactic \u03b2-blockers and angiotensin II-receptor blockers in order to slow down the dilation of the ascending aorta, and prophylactic aortic surgery. Importantly, \u03b2-blocker therapy may reduce TGF-\u03b2 activation, which has been recognized as a contributory factor in Marfan's syndrome. The present article aims to provide an overview of this rare hereditary disorder.",

We used isoproterenol to simultaneously activate \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptors, salbutamol to selectively activate \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptors, and the combination of isoproterenol and the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI 118,551 to stimulate only \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptors. Animals received one of the drug treatments, and water drinking was measured for 90 min. About 1 wk later, animals received the same drug treatment for measurement of arterial blood pressure responses for 90 min. In some rats, levels of renin and aldosterone secretion in response to isoproterenol or salbutamol were measured in additional tests. Old and middle-aged rats drank significantly less after isoproterenol than did young rats and also had greater reductions in arterial blood pressure. Old and middle-aged rats drank significantly less after salbutamol than did young rats, although reductions in arterial blood pressure were equivalent across the ages. The \u03b2(2)-adrenergic antagonist ICI 118,551 abolished drinking after isoproterenol and prevented most of the observed hypotension. Renin secretion after isoproterenol and salbutamol was greater in young rats than in middle-aged rats, and wholly absent in old rats. Aldosterone secretion was reduced in old rats compared with young and middle-aged rats after treatment with isoproterenol, but not after treatment with salbutamol. In conclusion, there are age-related differences in \u03b2-adrenergic receptor-mediated drinking that can be explained only in part by age-related differences in renin secretion after \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation.",

Mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood but may include beneficial effects on physical conditioning and vagal tone. We investigated the association of n-3 fatty acid levels to exercise parameters in 992 subjects with stable coronary artery disease. Cross-sectional associations of heart rate recovery time, treadmill exercise capacity, and exercise time with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels were evaluated in multivariable linear and logistic regression models adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, co-morbidities, self-reported physical activity, medication use, and left ventricular function. After multivariable adjustment, n-3 fatty acid levels (DHA + EPA) were strongly associated with heart rate recovery (beta 2.1, p = 0.003), exercise capacity (beta 0.8, p <0.0001), and exercise time (beta 0.9, p <0.0001). Increasing levels of (DHA + EPA) were also associated with decreased risk of impaired heart rate recovery (odds ratio 0.8, p = 0.004) and exercise time (odds ratio 0.7, p = 0.01) and trended toward significance for exercise capacity (odds ratio 0.8, p = 0.07). These associations were not modified by demographics, body mass index, smoking, co-morbid conditions, statin use, or \u03b2-blocker use (p for interaction >0.1 for all comparisons). In conclusion, an independent association exists between n-3 fatty acid levels and important exercise parameters in patients with stable coronary artery disease. These findings support the hypothesis that n-3 fatty acids may increase vagal tone and physical conditioning.",

The use of sequential scanning for coronary computed tomographic angiography reduces the radiation dose. The application of sequential scanning to TRO CTA is much less well defined. We analyzed the radiation dose and image quality from TRO CTA performed at a single outpatient center, comparing the scans from a period during which helical scanning with electrocardiographically controlled tube current modulation was used for all patients (n = 35) and after adoption of a strategy incorporating sequential scanning whenever appropriate (n = 35). Sequential scanning was able to be used for 86% of the cases. The sequential-if-appropriate strategy, compared to the helical-only strategy, was associated with a 61.6% dose decrease (mean dose-length product of 439 mGy \u00d7 cm vs 1,144 mGy \u00d7 cm and mean effective dose of 7.5 mSv vs 19.4 mSv, respectively, p <0.0001). Similarly, a 71.5% dose reduction occurred among the 30 patients scanned with the sequential protocol compared to the 40 patients scanned with the helical protocol using either strategy (326 mGy \u00d7 cm vs 1,141 mGy \u00d7 cm and 5.5 mSv vs 19.4 mSv, respectively, p <0.0001). Although the image quality did not differ between the strategies, a nonstatistically significant trend was seen toward better quality in the sequential protocol than in the helical protocol. In conclusion, approaching TRO CTA with a diagnostic strategy of sequential scanning, as appropriate, can offer a marked reduction in the radiation dose while maintaining the image quality.",

    "166": "In the hippocampal formation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, both focal and diffuse deposits of A\u03b2 peptides appear in a subregion- and layer-specific manner. Recently, pyroglutamate (pGlu or pE)-modified A\u03b2 peptides were identified as a highly pathogenic and seeding A\u03b2 peptide species. Since the pE modification is catalyzed by glutaminyl cyclase (QC) this enzyme emerged as a novel pharmacological target for AD therapy. Here, we reveal the role of QC in the formation of different types of hippocampal pE-A\u03b2 aggregates. First, we demonstrate that both, focal and diffuse pE-A\u03b2 deposits are present in defined layers of the AD hippocampus. While the focal type of pE-A\u03b2 aggregates was found to be associated with the somata of QC-expressing interneurons, the diffuse type was not. To address this discrepancy, the hippocampus of amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice was analysed. Similar to observations made in AD, focal (i.e. core-containing) pE-A\u03b2 deposits originating from QC-positive neurons and diffuse pE-A\u03b2 deposits not associated with QC were detected in Tg2576 mouse hippocampus. The hippocampal layers harbouring diffuse pE-A\u03b2 deposits receive multiple afferents from QC-rich neuronal populations of the entorhinal cortex and locus coeruleus. This might point towards a mechanism in which pE-A\u03b2 and/or QC are being released from projection neurons at hippocampal synapses. Indeed, there are a number of reports demonstrating the reduction of diffuse, but not of focal, A\u03b2 deposits in hippocampus after deafferentation experiments. Moreover, we demonstrate in neurons by live cell imaging and by enzymatic activity assays that QC is secreted in a constitutive and regulated manner. Thus, it is concluded that hippocampal pE-A\u03b2 plaques may develop through at least two different mechanisms: intracellularly at sites of somatic QC activity as well as extracellularly through seeding at terminal fields of QC expressing projection neurons.",

    "183": "This is a prospective, randomized, parallel, active-controlled, PROBE design study (ClinicalTrials.org: NCT00942487) in 60 patients (53\u00b19 years, 67% men) with arterial hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, normal ejection fraction, and no coronary heart disease, randomized to either a nebivolol-based or a metoprolol-based treatment, who had conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography, at rest and during dobutamine stress, at baseline and after 6 months.", 
    "184": "SBP and DBP, and resting heart rate decreased by 13, 13, and 12%, respectively, on nebivolol, and by 11, 13, and 7%, respectively, on metoprolol (all, P<0.01). Mean longitudinal early diastolic velocity increased by 16% (P<0.05) on nebivolol compared with 9% (P=not significant) on metoprolol (P=not significant for intergroup differences), whereas flow propagation velocity increased by 34% on nebivolol (P<0.05) and did not change on metoprolol (P<0.01 for intergroup differences). Mean longitudinal displacement increased by 10% on nebivolol (P<0.05) and did not change on metoprolol (P<0.05 for intergroup differences), whereas ejection time increased by 5% on nebivolol (P<0.05) and did not change on metoprolol. All the other parameters of left ventricular function were not different between the two treatment arms.",

    "186": "To assess the in vitro tolerance and in vivo efficacy of new unpreserved formulations of timolol maleate (TM) in aqueous solutions of bioadhesive polymers used for dry eye treatment and to compare them with three traditional TM formulations: unpreserved Timabak (Thea, Madrid, Spain), benzalkonium chloride (BAK)-preserved Timoftol (Frosst Laboratories, Madrid, Spain), and BAK-preserved Timolol Sandoz (Frosst Laboratories).", 
    "187": "New formulations were composed of TM (0.5%) and carboxymethyl cellulose (0.5%), hyaluronic acid (0.2%), or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (0.3% or 0.5%). In vitro tolerance was determined in human corneal-limbal epithelial cells and normal human conjunctival cells. The ocular hypotensive effect was evaluated measuring IOP in rabbit eyes for 8 hours.", 
    "188": "In all cases, cell survival after exposure to the formulations was greater in the new unpreserved TM formulations than in the traditional TM solutions (BAK-preserved and unpreserved). In addition, the new formulations were demonstrated to maintain the hypotensive effect of TM in different magnitudes. The maximum hypotensive effect was reached by TM 0.5% in carboxymethyl cellulose 0.5% (32.37%).", 
    "189": "The results demonstrated that new unpreserved formulations of TM with bioadhesive polymers decreased IOP in rabbits and reached values closer to those reached by traditional solutions. Furthermore, new formulations presented a significantly higher in vitro tolerance than the same compound in traditional formulations. Although unpreserved formulations are usually more expensive, preservative-free antiglaucoma eye drops should improve compliance and adherence in the medical treatment of glaucoma. Bioadhesive polymers could be part of antiglaucoma formulations to reduce ocular toxicity, improve drug efficacy, and protect the ocular surface in long-term therapies.", 
    "190": "It remains unknown whether left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling (LVRR) after therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers and \u03b2 blockers is correlated with prognosis in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Forty-two patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy treated with the therapy were studied. Complete left ventricular reverse remodeling was defined as LV end-diastolic dimension \u2264 55 mm and fractional shortening \u2265 25% at the last echocardiographic assessment. The incidence of complete LVRR was significantly higher in patients who survived than in those who died or underwent heart transplantation. Patients were divided into 3 groups: death or transplantation, alive with complete LVRR, and alive without complete LVRR. Although patients who died or underwent transplantation did not show any LV improvements, those with complete LVRR showed significant improvements at 1 to 6 months after starting the therapy. Patients without complete LVRR also showed small but significant improvements at 1 to 6 months. The decrease in LV end-systolic dimension from the initial value to that at 1 to 6 months was an independent determinant of future cardiac death or transplantation. In conclusion, complete LVRR is related to favorable prognosis in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The extent of left ventricular reverse remodeling at 1 to 6 months after starting the therapy is predictive of long-term prognosis.", 
    "191": "Difficulty of use of eyedrops is a factor associated with poor patient compliance that reduces treatment efficacy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the handiness and global acceptability of the new Abak timolol bottle (multidose preservative-free eyedrops) in comparison with that of other administration systems (classical multidose eyedrops or single-doses) in patients treated for glaucoma or ocular hypertension.", 
    "192": "Cross-sectional, retrospective and multicentre study involving 41 ophthalmologists in France. Selected patients were those who had been treated with the new Abak bottle since at least two months, as a replacement for other beta-blocker eyedrops. Handiness and acceptability of the new Abak bottle in comparison with other delivery systems were evaluated using a questionnaire filled by the investigator.", 
    "193": "Almost all the patients were unanimous regarding the handiness of the new Abak bottle: easy to open for 96.5% of them, easy to handle for 96.0%, and easy to get drops for 91.1%. For all these criteria and in a general manner, patients preferred the new Abak bottle in comparison with the previous eyedrop container. These results were confirmed in the oldest patients.", 
    "194": "The new Abak bottle had a greater acceptability compared to preserved multidose eyedrops or to single-doses. Its handiness and the absence of preservative which may improve local tolerance are in favor of a greater compliance in chronically treated patients.", 
    "195": "We have previously shown that metoprolol improves function in the diabetic heart, associated with inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and a shift towards protein kinase B signaling. The aim of this study was to determine the relative importance of these metabolic and signaling effects to the prevention of cellular damage. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by a single IV injection of 60mg/kg streptozotocin, and treated groups received 15mg/kg/day metoprolol delivered subcutaneously by osmotic pumps. Echocardiography was performed 6weeks after streptozotocin injection, and the hearts immediately excised for histological and biochemical measurements of lipotoxicity, apoptosis, signaling and caveolin/caspase interactions. Metoprolol improved stroke volume and cardiac output, associated with attenuation of TUNEL staining and a more modest attenuation of caspase-3; however, the positive TUNEL staining was not associated with an increase in apoptosis or cell regeneration markers. Metoprolol inhibited CPT-1 without affecting CD36 translocation, associated with increased accumulation of triglycerides and long chain acyl CoA in the cytoplasm, and no effect on oxidative stress. Metoprolol induced a shift from protein kinase A to protein kinase B-mediated signaling, associated with a shift in the phosphorylation patterns of BCl-2 and Bad which favored BCl-2 action. Metoprolol also increased the interaction of activated caspase-3 with caveolins 1 and 3 outside caveolae. The actions of metoprolol on fatty acid oxidation do not prevent lipotoxicity; its beneficial effect is more likely to be due to pro-survival signaling and sequestration of activated caspase-3 by caveolins.", 
    "196": "Postoperative complications are directly related to poor surgical outcomes in the elderly. This review outlines evidence based quality initiatives focused on decreasing neurologic, cardiac, and pulmonary complications in the elderly surgical patient. Important anesthesia quality initiatives for prevention of delirium, the most common neurologic complication in elderly surgical patients, are outlined. There are few age-specific quality measures aimed at prevention of cardiac and pulmonary complications. However, some recommendations for adults can be applied to the geriatric surgical population. In the future, process measures may provide a more global assessment of quality in the elderly surgical population.", 
    "197": "The time and height at the peak maximum are key parameters to describe a chromatographic peak with prediction or optimization purposes, or in the qualitative/quantitative analysis of samples. Three different approaches to estimate these parameters, using the experimental points in the peak maximum region, are here described and compared. The approaches are based on the reliable description of the peak profile using a modified Gaussian model with a parabolic variance (PVMG). In the first approach, non-linear fitting of the chromatographic data to the PVMG model is carried out to obtain the time and height at the peak maximum (Approach I). In the other two approaches, the PVMG model is linearized to carry out a linear fitting. In each case, the optimal number of processed points was assessed. The three approaches yielded highly satisfactory results, being Approach I the best in terms of accuracy and robustness. The assessment of the accuracy in the estimations was carried out using simulated peaks. These peaks were built with the parameters obtained from real peaks for several probe compounds eluted under reversed-phase liquid chromatographic (RPLC) conditions, to which noise was added.", 
    "198": "In this study, we determined the effects of norepinephrine (NE) on immunity and the pathway of its function in the freshwater giant prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii. The total hemocyte count (THC), differential hemocyte count (DHC), phenoloxidase activity, respiratory bursts, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, phagocytic activity, and clearance efficiency in response to the pathogen, Lactococcus garvieae, were measured when the freshwater giant prawn, M. rosenbergii (16.2\u00b12.1 g) was individually injected with saline or NE at 0.5, 5.0, and 50.0 pmol prawn(-1). Results showed that semi-granular cells, respiratory bursts and phagocytic activity at 2 h, PO activity and clearance efficiency from 2 to 4 h, THC at 8 h, and SOD activity from 4 to 8 h significantly decreased, but hyaline cells at 2 h, and respiratory bursts at 8 h had significantly increased after injection of NE at 50.0 pmol prawn(-1). In prawns that had received 5.0 pmol NE prawn(-1), the PO activity had decreased at 2 h, SOD activity at 8 h, and the clearance efficiency at 2 h. PO activity had decreased at 2 h after prawns had received 0.5 pmol NE prawn(-1). All of the immune parameters had returned to control values by 16 h after receiving NE. However, no significant differences were observed in the granular cells during the experimental period. An injection of NE also significantly increased the mortality of prawns challenged with L. garvieae, which appeared to be dose dependent. In another experiment, NE co-injected with prazosin, metoprolol, or propranolol significantly decreased the mortality of challenged prawns, especially when co-injected with prazosin and metoprolol. These results suggest that stress-inducing NE suppresses the immune system, which in turn promotes the susceptibility of M. rosenbergii to L. garvieae via both \u03b11- and \u03b21-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "199": "A 53-year-old man with depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 35% and QRS width of 88 ms at rest was admitted to our institution with a complaint of exertional chest discomfort and dyspnea. During treadmill exercise, left bundle-branch block (LBBB) with a QRS width of 152 ms occurred at a heart rate of 100 bpm. During LBBB, the patient showed significant mechanical dyssynchrony as evidenced by a two-dimensional speckle tracking radial strain of 260 ms (\u2265 130 ms), defined as the time difference between anterior-septum and posterior wall. Five-month after carvedilol and candesartan administration, EF had improved to 49% and LBBB did not occur until a heart rate of 126 bpm was attained during treadmill exercise. It appears that pharmacological therapy may be useful for patients with heart failure and exercise-induced LBBB."
