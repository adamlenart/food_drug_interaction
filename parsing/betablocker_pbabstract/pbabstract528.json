Sotalol caused a highly significant lengthening of the absolute and corrected QT (QTc) interval over atenolol which was apparent by day 6 and persisted unchanged throughout the follow-up period. The increase in QT interval averaged 43 ms (9%). Sotalol blunted the increase in ventricular premature beat frequency on ambulatory monitoring which occurred with atenolol, although direct comparison of arrhythmia frequency between the groups receiving atenolol and sotalol revealed no significant difference. Marked lengthening of QTc interval (greater than 500 ms) was observed on 29 occasions in patients receiving sotalol, most commonly at day 6, but no episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia were recorded. The Class III action of sotalol persists over and above any response to beta-blockade during a one-year follow-up period. In a population with a low incidence of spontaneous arrhythmias, however, there was only a modest difference in antiarrhythmic efficacy between atenolol and sotalol. Episodes of marked lengthening of QT interval induced by sotalol in the absence of other adverse factors need not be arrhythmogenic.", 
    "1": "The concentration of mRNA encoding proopiomelanocortin (POMC) was measured in AtT-20/D-16v cells, a clonal pituitary tumor cell line. Treatment of the cells with potassium (20 mM) or veratridine (10 microM) for 12, 24 and 48 h caused a time-dependent increase in the levels of POMC mRNA which became significant after 24 h. These effects were not seen in the presence of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (5 microM). In addition, the calcium channel blocker verapamil (10 microM) completely abolished the responses to either potassium or veratridine, whereas the calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644 (0.1 microM) potentiated the effect of potassium. Furthermore, the calcium channel blockers verapamil (10 microM) and nidefipine (1 microM) significantly decreased not only basal levels of POMC mRNA but also the increase of mRNA levels induced by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF; 0.1 microM), 8-bromo-cAMP (1 mM) or cholera toxin (100 ng/ml). The drug-induced alterations in the mRNA POMC levels of the cells were, in each case, associated with similar alterations of immunoreactive beta-endorphin in the medium. These results indicate that membrane depolarization to activate sodium channels and calcium channels initiates an entry of calcium ions which triggers POMC gene expression in the AtT-20 cells. Moreover, calcium entry into the cells may exert a tonic stimulatory effect on POMC mRNA under basal conditions and may also contribute to the enhancing effect of CRF or cAMP on POMC mRNA in these cells.", 
    "2": "Effects of prolonged in vivo infusion of phenylephrine upon receptor binding and cardiac contractility were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. A 1-hr i.v. infusion of phenylephrine (3 mg/kg/hr) resulted in a sustained 50% increase in diastolic blood pressure and 5% increase in heart rate. Chronic (6-day) infusion (3 mg/kg/hr) utilizing Alzet mini-osmotic pumps maintained plasma concentrations of phenylephrine at 1.0 microgram/ml, depleted myocardial norepinephrine stores 8-fold and resulted in a modest cardiac hypertrophy. Density and affinity of myocardial adrenoceptors and calcium channels were quantified by analyzing saturation isotherms of radioligand binding. [3H]Prazosin, [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]nitrendipine bound specifically and with high affinity to cardiac alpha-1 and beta adrenoceptors and calcium channels, respectively. As measured by Scatchard analyses, phenylephrine infusion significantly decreased the maximum number (Bmax) of specific [3H]prazosin binding sites by 39% (430 +/- 20 vs. 263 +/- 16 fmol/mg of protein; P less than .05). Chronic phenylephrine treatment also decreased the Bmax for [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding by 31% (124 +/- 3.3 vs. 86 +/- 6.6 fmol/mg of protein; P less than .05) and the Bmax for [3H]nitrendipine binding by 32% (342 +/- 8.8 vs. 235 +/- 6.7 fmol/mg of protein; P less than .05). Binding affinities (Kd) of [3H]prazosin, [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]nitrendipine remained unchanged. Administration of vehicle alone or surgical manipulation due to osmotic pump implantation did not affect either the density or affinity of [3H]prazosin, [3H]dihydroalprenolol or [3H]nitrendipine binding. Contractile responses to phenylephrine were studied in isolated ventricular strips to determine the functional significance of alpha-1 adrenoceptor down-regulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "Norepinephrine may be the neurotransmitter responsible for triggering the surge release of luteinizing hormone (LH) in proestrous and steroid-treated ovariectomized rats. In a previous study, we electrically stimulated (ES) the locus coeruleus (LC), a norepinephrine cell body region from which some axons project to the hypothalamus. These studies were performed in estradiol-treated rats in which the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) initially had been electrochemically stimulated (ECS) to partially depolarize luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) neurons. We observed that LC-ES markedly amplified the amount of LH released after preoptic-ECS. The purpose of the present study was to determine if these amplifying effects of LC-ES were due to the release of a catecholamine and if so which neurotransmitter was involved in this response. All rats in this study were ovariectomized and 7 days later (day 0) they were treated with estradiol for 2 days (day 2). On day 2, all animals were anesthetized with chloral hydrate. In control rats, the MPN was electrochemically stimulated (100 microA/60 s DC) and 30 min later the LC was electrically stimulated for 15 min. MPN-ECS significantly increased plasma concentrations of LH and LC-ES markedly amplified these plasma LH levels. Thereafter, 3 studies were performed and the following drugs were given: (1) alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (MPT, 300 mg/kg i.p.); (2) phenoxybenzamine (PX, 15 mg/kg i.p.) and (3) propranolol (PROP, 15 mg/kg i.p.). MPT and PROP were administered 15 min prior to MPN-ECS and PX was given 90 min before MPN-ECS. None of these drugs affected the amount of LH released after preoptic stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "Sudden cardiac death is the leading mode of death in adults in the United States. While it appears intimately associated with coronary artery disease, the factors that render some subjects vulnerable to sudden cardiac death, while others with the same coronary disease do not die suddenly, are unknown. An approach is described which considers that sudden cardiac death represents a separate syndrome of coronary artery disease within certain vulnerable subjects. It is suggested that the response to psychosocial stress in vulnerable subjects results in deleterious cerebral cortical influences on the autonomic control of the heart which render it more vulnerable to ischemia-induced ventricular fibrillation. Studies in the pig, an animal known to be susceptible to sudden death resulting from an environmental stress, demonstrate that cerebral cortical influences on autonomic centers play a central role in vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation after coronary artery occlusion. In this model, the incidence of ventricular fibrillation can be reduced by psychologic adaptation of the animal to his environment, cryoblockade of frontal cortical brain stem pathways and by central administration of propranolol. The relative role of adrenergic and cholinergic innervation of the heart is an important consideration.", 
    "5": "Anxiety may have deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system in persons who have, or are predisposed to have, cardiovascular disease. Contributing factors consist of the type of anxiety, constitutional characteristics and personality traits. The treatment of anxiety thus has a beneficial effect on patients with cardiovascular disease. However, anxiety reduction through medication, even if it includes subjective improvement in somatic symptoms, should not necessarily be equated with beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. Three groups of medication used in the treatment of anxiety have different effects. Antidepressants lower psychic anxiety but may have the opposite effect on the cardiovascular system, whereas beta-adrenergic blockers lower sympathetic tone without affecting psychic anxiety. Only benzodiazepines fulfill both functions. Since subjective reports of somatic, including cardiovascular, changes correlate poorly with physiologic changes, assessment of new medications should not rely on self-reported improvement in cardiac symptoms but should include objective measures as well.", 
    "6": "The efficacy and safety of nifedipine in a gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) push-pull osmotic pump formulation was compared with long-acting propranolol in 49 patients with mild to moderate hypertension already receiving diuretics. Using a two-week placebo run-in, double-blind study design, patients were randomly assigned to receive nifedipine GITS (n = 24) in doses of 30 mg, 60 mg, or 90 mg once daily; or long-acting propranolol (n = 25) in doses of 80, 160, or 240 mg once daily. Previous diuretic therapy was continued. Sitting and five-minute standing blood pressure and heart rate measurements were made 24 hours after dosing. At the endpoint of treatment, both nifedipine GITS and sustained-release propranolol reduced blood pressure compared with placebo (p less than 0.001) in the sitting and standing positions. Nifedipine GITS was more effective in lowering standing systolic blood pressure than was propranolol (p less than 0.02). Propranolol caused a greater reduction in resting heart rate than did nifedipine GITS (p less than 0.003). Both drugs were well tolerated. Nifedipine GITS is an effective and safe once-daily drug for use in patients with hypertension who are already receiving diuretics, may be more effective than sustained-release propranolol, and may be better tolerated than conventional nifedipine capsules.", 
    "7": "This multicenter study assessed the efficacy of a new formulation of nifedipine in 54 patients with stable angina pectoris receiving beta-blocker therapy. This once-daily preparation of nifedipine was administered in double-blind fashion in doses of 30, 60, and 90 mg. All patients experienced pain-limited exercise at placebo baseline treadmill testing. Eight hours post-dose exercise testing resulted in a significant increase in time to onset of angina for all three dose levels of nifedipine but not for placebo. Exercise testing 24 hours after dosing showed significant improvement in time to angina and total exercise time for patients receiving 60-mg and 90-mg doses but not for the 30-mg or placebo categories. These preliminary results suggest that this new formulation of nifedipine is beneficial when added to stable doses of a beta blocker in patients in whom angina is still exhibited during exercise testing.", 
    "8": "Membrane damage caused by phospholipase A action is thought to be an important factor in ischemic myocardial injury. Propranolol has been shown previously to have beneficial effects in both animal experiments and clinical trials, and it has membrane-stabilizing properties in vitro. To investigate the possibility that these effects might be due, in part, to effects on phospholipases, we determined the effects of propranolol on rat heart phospholipases A at physiological pH using small unilamellar liposomes of di[1-14C]oleoylphosphatidylcholine as substrate. Propranolol inhibited heart phospholipases A in vitro. The concentration required to give 50% inhibition was 0.2 mM for the mitochondrial and cytosolic phospholipases A and 2.9 mM for sarcoplasmic reticulum phospholipase A. The binding of [4-3H]propranolol to fresh membrane preparations was studied using an ultracentrifugation method. Propranolol bound readily to both membrane fractions in vitro with no significant difference in the saturation number (0.20 to 0.28 mol drug per mol phospholipid) but the association constant, KA, was higher for mitochondrial membranes (3760 +/- 350) than for the sarcoplasmic reticulum (2190 +/- 390). Our results show that propranolol inhibited heart phospholipases A in vitro at physiological pH. The mitochondrial and cytosolic phospholipases A were more susceptible to inhibition than the phospholipase A of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Propranolol bound to mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum in vitro, suggesting the possibility that propranolol binding to heart membranes in vivo could result in drug concentrations in these membranes high enough to inhibit phospholipase A. This could represent an additional mechanism by which propranolol exerts beneficial effects in myocardial ischemia.", 
    "9": "We studied the bilateral intraocular pressure lowering effect of long-term unilateral timolol maleate 0.5% in 30 patients in whom early primary open-angle glaucoma had recently been diagnosed. A significant intraocular pressure reduction was found in the untreated fellow eyes (21.9 mm Hg from 26.4 mm Hg at baseline) (P less than .001), as well as in the treated eyes (21.0 mm Hg from 28.5 mm Hg at baseline) (P less than .001). Fourteen patients (47%) showed a significant bilateral intraocular pressure reduction (P less than .001), with little difference between the treated (8.2 mm Hg) and the untreated eyes (7.7 mm Hg) (P greater than .8).", 
    "10": "A 47-year-old patient suffering from coronary artery disease was admitted to the CCU in shock with III. AV block, severe hypotension, and impairment of ventricular function. One week prior to admission a therapy with standard doses of metoprolol (100 mg t.i.d. and then 100 mg b.i.d.) had been initiated. Two days before admission diltiazem (60 mg b.i.d.) was prescribed in addition. Analyses of a blood sample revealed unusually high plasma concentrations of metoprolol (greater than 3000 ng/ml) and diltiazem (526 ng/ml). The patient recovered within 1 week following discontinuation of antianginal therapy. Three months later the patient was exposed to a single dose of metoprolol, diltiazem, propafenone (since he had received this drug in the past), and sparteine (as a probe for the debrisoquine/sparteine type polymorphism of oxidative drug metabolism). It was found that he was a poor metabolizer of all four drugs, indicating that their metabolism is under the same genetic control. Therefore, patients belonging to the poor-metabolizer phenotype of sparteine/debrisoquine polymorphism in drug metabolism, which constitutes 6.4% of the German population, may experience adverse drug reactions when treated with standard doses of one of these drugs alone. Moreover, the coadministration of these frequently used drugs is expected to be especially harmful in this subgroup of patients.",

The combination drugs showed an immediate, significant reduction in intraocular pressure of 7.2 mm Hg (25%) and 10.7 mm Hg (37%), respectively. The lowered intraocular pressure level was maintained throughout the three-week test period. With pilocarpine alone, intraocular pressure was reduced 5.3 mm Hg (19%). The mean intraocular pressure 12 hours after the last dose compared to two hours after the last dose was significantly higher both in patients receiving pilocarpine four times a day and in patients receiving timolol 0.5%-pilocarpine 4% twice a day (5.1 and 3.6 mm Hg, respectively), but not in patients receiving timolol 0.5%-pilocarpine 2% twice a day (2.6 mm Hg).",

The results show that the inhibition of the ventricular receptors significantly increases coronary resistance and that this reflex response is eliminated in hypertensive patients with ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "13": "The alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine was found to inhibit protein labelling from [3H]valine in isolated liver cells. This effect is only observable under conditions of partial Ca2+ depletion and in cells displaying maximal rates of protein labelling, i.e. cells isolated from fed animals or from starved animals when incubated in the presence of alanine. The ability of phenylephrine to inhibit protein labelling at near-saturating concentrations of the amino acid precursor indicates that this alpha-agonist actually decreases the rate of protein synthesis. The possibility that phenylephrine acts by making cellular Ca2+ availability further limiting can be ruled out, since alanine stimulates protein labelling under conditions of severe Ca2+ depletion obtained by pretreatment of the cells with EGTA. The following observations indicate that the phenylephrine action may be mediated by an increase in cellular cyclic AMP content: (1) a close relationship was found between the abilities of phenylephrine to inhibit protein labelling and to increase cyclic AMP content; (2) cyclic AMP mimics the phenylephrine action only in cells partially depleted of Ca2+; (3) the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin, which inhibited the phenylephrine-mediated increase in cyclic AMP, also abolished the effect on protein synthesis.", 
    "14": "The effect of chlorpromazine (CPZ) on the degradation of collagen and non-collagenous peptides in clonal osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells was investigated by measuring the activities of PZ-peptidase, collagenase-like peptidase (CL-peptidase), dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase (DAP), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) (EC 3.4.11.1), and post-proline cleaving enzyme (PPCE) (EC 3.4.21.26). CPZ increased PZ-peptidase and CL-peptidase activities in a dose-related fashion, but it had no effect on LAP and PPCE activities in the cells. CPZ (10 micrograms/ml) enhanced the specific activities of PZ-peptidase, CL-peptidase, and DAP for 72 hr after the start of CPZ stimulation; in particular, about a 3.3-fold increase of PZ-peptidase activity was observed at 12 hr of culture. Furthermore, other phenothiazine derivatives specifically enhanced the PZ-peptidase, CL-peptidase, and DAP activities as well as CPZ. Since PZ-peptidase, CL-peptidase, and DAP, involved in the degradation of collagen peptides, were induced significantly by CPZ (and/or other phenothiazine derivatives) in comparison with LAP and PPCE, involved in the degradation of non-collagenous peptides, these results show that CPZ specifically stimulated collagen catabolism by inducing the collagen-catabolizing enzymes. In addition, CPZ specifically inhibited collagen synthesis in clonal osteoblasts.", 
    "15": "The interaction of 12 phenoxypropanolamines, all ligands with high affinity towards beta-adrenoceptors, with the [3H]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate ([3H]BTX-B) binding site on voltage-sensitive sodium channels in a rat brain synaptosomal preparation, was studied as a measure for local anaesthetic activity. All derivatives are capable of displacing [3H]BTX-B from its specific binding site, penbutolol displaying the highest affinity. Multiple regression analyses were performed, correlating biological activity (pKi values) with physicochemical parameters. Lipophilicity is of prime importance in the established regression equations, but steric factors are relevant as well. Comparisons were made with analogous equations relating beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor affinity with physicochemical parameters, leading to the conclusion that \"cardioselective\" beta-adrenoceptor ligands appear to have fewer membrane stabilizing properties.", 
    "16": "The daily administration of 240 to 360 mg of diltiazem lowered blood pressure in a dose-related pattern similar to that seen in patients taking a daily dosage of 50 to 100 mg of atenolol. Sustained-release diltiazem was administered twice daily and atenolol once. Goal blood pressure was defined as less than 90 mm Hg or a reduction of greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg for patients with baseline pressures of 95 to 99 mm Hg in the supine position and was achieved in 60% of diltiazem-treated and 63% of atenolol-treated patients. The mean diltiazem dosage at the end of the study was 329 mg daily; for atenolol it was 80 mg daily. Adverse reactions considered possibly or probably drug related were reported by 26% of diltiazem patients and 38% of atenolol patients. Although both drugs were associated with a slower heart rate, atenolol patients showed a significantly greater negative chronotropic effect. Diltiazem, in a sustained-release form taken twice daily, is as effective as atenolol as a sole antihypertensive agent. It has a favorable side-effect profile and may be a useful alternative antihypertensive medication compared with existing beta-blocker therapy with atenolol.",

Blood pressure and heart rate were measured in the supine position, immediately after and 5 minutes after standing. Modified Bruce protocol treadmill tests were performed to determine the time to onset of 1 mm ST-segment depression, time to onset of chest pain and time to termination of exercise. Diltiazem monotherapy resulted in equivalent blood pressure control in 28 of 38 patients (74%). In the remaining patients, blood pressure control was achieved with resumption of the diuretic.

    "18": "Because of the growing number of antihypertensive agents that are suitable for initial therapy in mild and moderate hypertension, it is important to identify factors that influence the response to various medications. Although individual patient considerations, such as associated illnesses and potential side effects, are of primary importance in choosing therapy, the influence of demographic factors has received increasing attention. The effect of age, race and gender on the response to antihypertensive therapy will be examined. Several studies have indicated that the beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are more effective in younger than in older patients. Conversely, there is a trend toward greater responses in older subjects to the diuretics and calcium antagonists. In the few studies available that have compared agents in various classes, it appears that diuretics, and probably calcium antagonists, are significantly more effective than beta blockers or ACE inhibitors in patients over 60 years of age. However, the interdrug differences in young patients are probably less important. With regard to race, the relative lack of effect of beta blockers and ACE inhibitors in blacks is well accepted; in comparative studies, diuretics proved significantly better. From the few available studies, it does not appear that the calcium antagonists are more potent in either racial group, but they may be superior to the beta blockers and ACE inhibitors in blacks. Far less information is available concerning differences in antihypertensive responses between men and women. There is some suggestion that women may be less responsive to beta blockers than men.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "Polymyxin B (PXB), a cyclic peptide antibiotic, in concentrations 0.1-3.0 mg/ml (0.08-4.0 mmol/l), inhibited the K+ efflux induced by opening of the Ca2+-activated K+ channel (the G\u00e1rdos effect) in intact human red blood cells. The inhibition was observed when the G\u00e1rdos effect was elicited by Ca2+ in the presence of vanadate, or propranolol, in ATP-depleted cells, and in A23187-treated cells. The inhibition of the G\u00e1rdos effect is caused neither by the inhibition of the anion channel by PXB nor by the inhibition of Ca2+ entry. It can be ascribed to the inhibition of the Ca2+-activated K+ channel. The mechanism of the inhibition remains to be elucidated.", 
    "20": "Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) kills by myocardial failure or by the sudden development of lethal ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation. Impaired coronary flow causes myocardial ischaemia, which acutely predisposes to ventricular fibrillation. If ischaemia is sustained, it may develop into cell necrosis (myocardial infarction). All these clinical manifestations of IHD depend on myocardial metabolic changes which in turn can be modified by pharmacological manipulation such as beta-adrenergic blockade or by reperfusion. The mechanism of reperfusion injury appears to be metabolic in origin, related either to free radicals or excess accumulation of cytosolic calcium.", 
    "21": "The function of structural domains of the beta-adrenergic receptor were probed by studying the ability of tryptic fragments of the receptor to catalyze the binding of guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S) to the GTP-binding regulatory protein, Gs. beta-Adrenergic receptor purified from turkey erythrocytes was treated with trypsin under nondenaturing conditions. Such treatment decreased beta-adrenergic ligand binding activity by only 15-25%. Active components of the limit digest were repurified by affinity chromatography on alprenolol-agarose and then reconstituted with purified Gs into unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. After reconstitution, the proteolyzed receptor was able to catalyze agonist-stimulated binding of GTP gamma S to Gs at a rate and extent equivalent to that of the nonproteolyzed receptor. The proteolyzed receptor was also partially activated upon reduction by dithiothreitol, as previously reported for the intact receptor (Pedersen, S.E., and Ross, E.M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14150-14157). The repurified, active tryptic digest contained two detectable peptides. One, of approximately 2 X 10(4) Da, contained either four or five of the amino-terminal membrane-spanning domains plus the intervening hydrophilic loops but not the amino-terminal extracellular, glycosylated peptide. The second, of 9,000-10,000 Da, was composed essentially of the two carboxyl-terminal membrane-spanning domains and the intervening extracellular, hydrophilic loop. These data indicate that most of the large intracellular hydrophilic loop and the hydrophilic, carboxyl-terminal region of the receptor are not necessary for the agonist-stimulated regulation of Gs.", 
    "22": "The deletion of residues 239-272 from the hamster beta-adrenergic receptor resulted in a loss of the ability of the receptor, expressed in mouse L cells, to stimulate adenylate cyclase (Dixon, R. A. F., Sigal, I. S., Rands, E., Register, R. B., Candelore, M. R., Blake, A. D., and Strader, C. D. (1987) Nature 326, 73-77). This mutant receptor (D(239-272)beta AR) bound the agonist isoproterenol with a single class of binding sites, in contrast to the wild-type beta-adrenergic receptor, which exhibited two classes of agonist affinity sites. We now report that the affinity of D(239-272)beta AR for isoproterenol is relatively insensitive to detergent solubilization or to treatment with either GTP or NaF, indicating the absence of a receptor-Gs interaction. Whereas deletions within the region of amino acids 229-258 did not reduce the ability of the receptor to couple to Gs or to stimulate adenylate cyclase, the deletion of either of the regions 222-229 or 258-270 resulted in receptors which were unable to couple to Gs. The affinities of D(222-229)beta AR, D(239-272)beta AR, and D(258-270)beta AR toward isoproterenol were greater than that observed for the low affinity, uncoupled form of the wild-type receptor. These results suggest a role for the regions of the beta-adrenergic receptor encompassing amino acids 222-229 and 258-270, which are predicted to form amphiphilic helices, in the agonist-promoted activation of Gs.",

    "24": "Increased arterial permeability to [125I]albumin is one of the earliest abnormalities found in the cholesterol-fed rabbit model for atherosclerosis and precedes morphologic changes in the arterial wall. Since propranolol is reported to retard atherogenesis in this model, the current study was undertaken to study the effect of propranolol on arterial permeability to albumin in cholesterol-fed rabbits. Carotid permeability to [125I]albumin was measured after 1 week of (a) a control diet containing only trace cholesterol (N = 9), (b) a 1.5% cholesterol diet (N = 11), or (c) a 1.5% cholesterol diet plus intraperitoneal propranolol 5 mg/kg/day (N = 19). The carotid artery was cannulated proximally and distally and peristaltically perfused with oxygenated Modified Eagle's Medium to which [125I]albumin had been added. The permeability of the carotid artery to albumin was estimated by measuring 125I activity in peripheral venous samples obtained after 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min of carotid perfusion. 125I-radioactivity of the perfused carotid artery was also counted at the end of the experiment to measure 125I retained in the arterial wall. The transfer of [125I]albumin across the arterial wall to the venous circulation was greater in the untreated cholesterol-fed group than in controls (P less than 0.05), but cholesterol-fed animals treated with propranolol did not differ significantly from controls. 125I-albumin in the arterial wall after 240 min of perfusion was decreased in both untreated cholesterol-fed animals (1444 dpm/cm +/- 350) and in propranolol-treated animals (1629 +/- 309) when these were compared to controls (3909 +/- 693, P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "The genetically controlled polymorphic oxidation of debrisoquine and sparteine is caused by the absence or functional deficiency of a cytochrome P-450 isozyme. In order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the differences in cytochrome P-450 function we have studied the 1'-hydroxylation of the prototype drug bufuralol in human liver microsomes of individuals phenotyped in vivo as extensive metabolizers (EM, N = 10), poor metabolizers (PM, N = 5) and in subjects with an intermediate rate of metabolism (IM, N = 4). PM- as compared to EM-microsomes were characterized by a decreased Vmax for (+)-bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation (7.51 +/- 2.03 nmol X mg-1 X hr-1 vs 11.95 +/- 4.80 nmol X mg-1 X hr-1) but not for (-)-bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation (4.72 +/- 0.87 nmol X mg-1 X hr-1 vs 5.55 +/- 1.49 nmol X mg-1 X hr-1). The apparent Km for (+)-bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation was increased in PM microsomes (118 +/- 84.9 microM vs 17.9 +/- 6.30 microM). Inhibition of bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation by quinidine was biphasic in EM microsomes, providing further support for the involvement of at least two cytochrome P-450 isozymes. Quinidine acted as a competitive inhibitor of only the high affinity/stereoselectivity component of the reaction. Our data suggest that the debrisoquine/sparteine type of oxidation polymorphism is caused by an almost complete loss of a minor cytochrome P-450 isozyme which has a high affinity and stereoselectivity for (+)-bufuralol and a high sensitivity to inhibition by quinidine.", 
    "26": "The response to intravenous administration of propranolol hydrochloride was studied in 24 children undergoing operation for isolated or complex right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Ten had pulmonary valve stenosis, 4 had pulmonary valve stenosis plus ventricular septal defect, 8 had tetralogy of Fallot, and 2 had complex lesions. Propranolol (0.01 to 0.2 mg per kilogram of body weight) was given to patients with a residual right ventricular to left ventricular systolic pressure ratio greater than 0.75. Four children did not respond to propranolol and required further surgical intervention. Twenty patients responded, 2 of whom died. Fifteen were restudied by cardiac catheterization 3 weeks to 27 months postoperatively. The right ventricle-pulmonary artery gradient was 25 mm Hg or less in 13 patients. We conclude that a small dose of propranolol given intraoperatively can identify patients in whom a reduction in the right ventricle-pulmonary artery gradient to acceptable levels will occur in the months following operation. This may reduce the need for placement of a subannular or transannular patch in some patients.", 
    "27": "The metabolic and physiological alterations associated with changes in myocardial tissue electrical resistivity during ischemia were characterized to assess the feasibility of using such resistivity as an on-line indicator of the onset of ischemic injury. Twelve anesthetized dogs underwent rapid cardiac extirpation; 5 served as untreated controls, and 7 were pretreated with metoprolol tartrate. Beta blockade was used to alter the time course of ischemic injury as demonstrated previously in studies using this experimental model. In vitro measurement of myocardial resistivity, the detection of ischemic contracture, and serial measurements of tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and lactate were obtained from totally ischemic left ventricles at 37 degrees C. Myocardial resistivity began to increase significantly before onset of ischemic contracture in the untreated control group (resistivity at 42.3 +/- 3.1 minutes, contracture at 53.8 +/- 3.7 minutes; p less than 0.025) as well as the metoprolol group (resistivity at 50.7 +/- 1.5 minutes, contracture at 70.0 +/- 3.5 minutes; p less than 0.005). As expected, ischemic contracture was delayed in the beta-blocked group compared with controls (p less than 0.01). Similarly, the onset of myocardial resistivity increase was delayed in the beta-blocked group (p less than 0.025). ATP and lactate levels at the onset of myocardial resistivity increase were consistent with severe but reversible injury. Resistivity changes during ischemia correlated linearly with simultaneous ATP depletion and lactate accumulation (r = 0.88 to 0.98; p less than 0.05). Furthermore, during global ischemia studied in 3 anesthetized dogs in vivo, the onset of myocardial resistivity increase occurred after 20 minutes. Finally, 6 anesthetized dogs underwent 60 minutes of in vivo regional ischemia by coronary artery occlusion, followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Myocardial resistivity in the ischemic region increased immediately and steadily after coronary occlusion, followed by a rapid decrease during subsequent reperfusion. These data show that myocardial resistivity may be useful for identifying severe but still reversible ischemic injury in on-line fashion during regional and global myocardial ischemia.", 
    "28": "Reported is the case of a 17-year-old woman who experienced full cardiac arrest less than one hour after ingesting 8 g of propranolol. More than two hours of CPR were required because she did not respond to glucagon or high doses of beta and alpha agonists. An intra-aortic balloon pump was used for hemodynamic support of drug-induced cardiogenic shock when pulses returned. She experienced complete recovery without sequelae.", 
    "29": "The effects of esmolol, a beta 1-selective adrenergic receptor antagonist with a short duration of action, were studied in a canine model of the hemodynamics of theophylline toxicity. Animals were anesthetized, then given 50 mg/kg aminophylline IV over 20 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/hr. Hemodynamic parameters, including heart rate, cardiac output, systemic blood pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure, were measured every 30 minutes along with plasma catecholamines and theophylline levels. Marked tachycardia was seen in the intoxicated state, with heart rate rising from a baseline of 128.0 +/- 8.3 beats per minute (BPM) to 179.0 +/- 7.4 BPM (P = .012). This was associated with increases in catecholamines (baseline norepinephrine .04 +/- .04 ng/mL plasma rose to .42 +/- .21 ng/mL plasma after intoxication, P = .048). The average serum theophylline level during the experiment was 44.0 +/- 1.1 micrograms/mL serum. Esmolol then was given by IV infusion in these animals in doses of 25, 50, and 100 micrograms/kg/min. It returned the heart rate to the preintoxication baseline in a dose-related manner. Esmolol did not decrease cardiac output or lower blood pressure.", 
    "30": "In 55 patients with persistent sinus bradycardia who underwent an electrophysiologic study of sinus node, both in the basal state and after autonomic blockade (propranolol, 0.2 mg/kg, and atropine, 0.04 mg/kg), an atropine test (0.02 mg/kg) was performed the following day. The 49 patients in whom sinus rate could be evaluated after atropine were subdivided into two groups--group I, 24 patients (age: 54 +/- 13 years) with normal intrinsic sinus automaticity (normal intrinsic heart rate and intrinsic corrected sinus node recovery time) and group II, 25 patients (age: 62 +/- 9 years) with abnormal intrinsic sinus automaticity. In group I, atropine increased sinus rate from 53.7 +/- 4 to 87.9 +/- 17 bpm (delta %: 65.5 +/- 33) and in group II from 51.6 +/- 5 to 73.9 +/- 14 bpm (delta %: 43.1 +/- 26). The discriminant threshold of sinus rate after atropine and its percent increase, obtained by discriminant analysis, was 80 bpm and +52%, respectively, with a misleading classification of 32% and 36%, respectively. The overall predictive accuracy of sinus rate after atropine was higher than the percent change in sinus rate (73% and 65%, respectively). These data evidence that the atropine test is not very helpful in discriminating between an organic and an autonomic involvement of sinus automaticity in patients with sinus bradycardia.", 
    "31": "Morphometric and chemical changes in the arterial wall were studied after 12 months of diet-induced atherosclerosis in rhesus monkeys treated with either bilateral surgical thoracic sympathectomy or propranolol. There was a marked reduction in the progression of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries and a moderate reduction in the disease found in the thoracic aorta of monkeys treated initially with a sympathectomy, in comparison to control monkeys fed an atherogenic diet alone. Propranolol at a dose of 40 mg/12 hrs also seemed to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries and thoracic aorta, although the differences were less dramatic. There were minimal differences in the extent of atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta or femoral arteries of animals in either treatment group as compared with the control group. Similarly, the chemical composition of these same major vessels showed no significant differences. Therefore, in the face of severe atherogenic stimuli, chemical or surgical sympathectomy may be useful in controlling atherosclerosis in specific arterial beds.", 
    "32": "We studied the effect of propranolol on the diet-induced coronary artery atherosclerosis (CAA) in 30 adult male cynomolgus monkeys living in social groupings of five animals each. Animals in the \"treated\" segment (n = 15) consumed propranolol, which was mixed into an atherogenic diet. Animals in the \"untreated\" group (n = 15) consumed only the atherogenic diet. Finally, the social groupings were subjected to disruption through monthly redistribution of monkeys among the groups within each treatment segment. The experiment lasted 26 months, following which all animals underwent autopsy during which the coronary arteries were evaluated for atherosclerosis. Regarding atherosclerosis, we observed a significant interaction between social status and experimental condition (p less than .03). Socially dominant animals had (as in previous studies) significantly exacerbated CAA, but only in the untreated segment; the effect of social dominance on CAA was abolished by long-term administration of propranolol. The antiatherogenic effect of propranolol on dominant animals was independent of the influences of serum lipid concentrations, blood pressure, and resting heart rate. We conclude that treatment with beta-adrenergic-blocking agents may confer a degree of protection against CAA among individuals behaviorally predisposed to coronary heart disease.", 
    "33": "The concomitant administration of hydralazine with metoprolol or propranolol substantially increases the oral bioavailability of these beta-blockers, presumably via reduction of the first-pass effect. It has been suggested that this effect may be secondary to a decrease in the intrinsic clearance of propranolol, possibly by inhibition of oxidative metabolism. To examine the possibility that hydralazine alters oxidative metabolism in vivo, the effect of hydralazine on the pharmacokinetics of antipyrine was examined in the rat. The oral administration of hydralazine hydrochloride, 7.5 mg/kg, 15 min prior to antipyrine administration reduced antipyrine clearance from 9.66 +/- 1.18 to 8.19 +/- 0.76 ml/min/kg (P less than 0.05). Hydralazine was observed to cause substantial hypothermia. The study was repeated in temperature-regulated animals and no alteration in antipyrine clearance was found. Two doses of hydralazine in temperature-regulated rats also failed to alter antipyrine clearance. Thus, it appears that the effect of hydralazine on antipyrine clearance is secondary to the hypothermic effect of hydralazine and not due to a direct inhibition of cytochrome P-450-mediated enzyme activity.", 
    "34": "The effects of acoustic stress (AS) on gastrointestinal motility and their prevention by previous treatment with naloxone, phentolamine, propranolol, muscimol, and diazepam were investigated in intact and vagotomized fasted dogs fitted with chronically implanted strain gauges on the antrum at 10 cm from pylorus and on the jejunum at 70 and 140 cm from the pylorus. These effects were compared to those produced by intracerebroventricular administration of ovine corticotropin releasing factor (oCRF). Beginning 40-50 min after the occurrence of a gastric migrating motor complex (MMC), a 1-hr hearing of prerecorded intense music through earpieces (less than 100 dB) delayed the occurrence of the next gastric MMC observed after 2.8 +/- 1.2 hr, while jejunal MMC were still present at a normal frequency. During AS, heart rate and plasma cortisol were significantly increased by 32.7 and 215%, respectively, 10-15 min after the beginning of hearing. The AS-induced lengthening of the gastric MMC cycle as well as cortisol increase were abolished after previous administration of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg intramuscular) or muscimol (10 micrograms/kg intravenous), while they were still present after naloxone (0.1 mg/kg intravenous), phentolamine (0.2 mg/kg intravenous), or propranolol (0.1 mg/kg intravenous). CRF administered intracerebroventricularly (100 ng/kg) also delayed the occurrence of gastric MMC without affecting jejunal motility, and this effect was not antagonized by previous treatment with diazepam or muscimol. Both the effects of AS and CRF were abolished after bilateral thoracic vagotomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "Twenty-five hypertensive patients participated in a randomized placebo-controlled study. After blood pressures were normalized with propranolol or verapamil alone over a 6-week period, patients were entered into a 4-week double-blind period where they received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment (sulindac or piroxicam) or placebo treatment in addition to their antihypertensive therapy. There was a significant elevation in standing systolic blood pressure (P less than 0.05) with propranolol and sulindac, when compared with propranolol and placebo, but no significant changes were shown with propranolol and piroxicam. Systolic blood pressures on sulindac treatment were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in both supine and standing positions during treatment of hypertension with verapamil compared with propranolol. Both supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures on piroxicam treatment were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) during treatment of hypertension with verapamil compared with propranolol. We conclude that NSAID transiently block the antihypertensive effect of propranolol, causing blood pressures to increase and side effects to improve. However, NSAID do not cause loss of antihypertensive control with verapamil.", 
    "36": "Phorbol dibutyrate (PDB) is an activator of protein kinase C and has been observed to cause a slow developing contraction in vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of phorbol ester-induced contraction is unknown. We studied the Ca++-dependence of, and the degree of myosin light chain phosphorylation (MLC-P), during PDB-induced contractions in rabbit aortic rings. PDB elicited concentration-dependent contractions (3 X 10(-8) to 10(-6) M) in rabbit aortic rings incubated in normal (1.6 mM Ca++) physiologic salt solution (PSS). Addition of the Ca++-channel blocker nifedipine (0.1 microM) to PSS or removal or Ca++ from PSS significantly reduced the contractile responses to PDB. Depletion of Ca++ by repeated washes in O Ca++-PSS containing 10(-3) M ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid reduced, but did not eliminate, the responses to PDB. In PSS, PDB significantly increased the fraction of phosphorylated MLC/total MLC to 0.33 from a resting value of 0.20. Ca++ depletion reduced the resting fraction (MLC-P/MLC) to 0.14. PDB-stimulated contractions in Ca++-depleted tissues occurred in the absence of significant increases in MLC-P. Sodium nitroprusside partially relaxed PDB-induced contractions by approximately 50% whether elicited in the presence of 1.6 mM Ca++ or after Ca++ depletion. In both cases relaxation occurred in the absence of statistically significant decreases in MLC phosphorylation. Ca++-dependent MLC phosphorylation may account for a component of the PDB contractile response in rabbit aorta. Studies in the absence of Ca++ suggest that PDB may activate contraction without concomitant MLC-P.", 
    "37": "During the maturation of sheep reticulocytes in vitro, there is release of material that can be pelleted from the cell-free incubation medium by centrifugation at 100,000 X g. This pellet contains activities that are derived from both the plasma membrane and lysosomes. No evidence was obtained for the presence of mitochondrial activities or cytosolic enzyme activities. The release of these activities is ATP and temperature dependent, since reduction of either results in a greater retention of the activities by the cells and a lesser amount in the 100,000 X g pellet. The pelleted material is vesicular in nature, and the production and (or) release of the material are reduced upon ATP depletion or lowering of the temperature. It is concluded that the externalization of specific membrane components is a normal metabolic process that occurs during reticulocyte maturation and represents a means by which reticulocytes shed specific types of membrane-associated functions that are known to decrease during reticulocytes maturation.", 
    "38": "Forearm arterial hemodynamics, including measurements of brachial artery diameter and compliance with pulsed Doppler velocimetry, were determined before and after acute administration of labetalol in patients with sustained essential hypertension. Labetalol caused a significant and rapid drop in blood pressure, with a decrease in forearm vascular resistance and an increase in brachial blood flow. Brachial artery diameter did not change, whereas arterial compliance increased significantly. The study provided evidence that labetalol caused a shift of the pressure-brachial artery diameter curve toward lower values of blood pressure, indicating a pharmacological effect of alpha and beta blockade on the hypertensive arterial wall.", 
    "39": "The effects of several new specific bradycardic agents, AQ-A39 and AQ-AH 208, were evaluated in two models of myocardial ischaemia in anesthetized dogs. In the first model, equal bradycardic doses of AQ-AH 208 and propranolol were compared for their effects on coronary collateral blood flow in dogs subjected to an acute coronary artery occlusion. AQ-AH 208 produced a significant (P less than 0.05) increase (35%) in transmural collateral perfusion whereas propranolol had no effect. Atrial pacing to control heart rate only partially negated the beneficial effect of AQ-AH 208 on collateral flow. In the second model of ischaemia, AQ-AH 208 and AQ-A39 were evaluated for their effects on subendocardial segment shortening (% SS) and regional myocardial blood flow in dogs subjected to 15 minutes of coronary artery occlusion, followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. Both compounds produced similar decreases in heart rate (24%) and increases in the endocardial/epicardial distribution of collateral blood flow. During occlusion and throughout reperfusion, AQ-AH 208 and AQ-A39 resulted in a significant improvement in % SS in the ischaemic-reperfused region. These results suggest that specific bradycardic agents may have potential for therapeutic use in certain types of myocardial ischaemia by several different mechanisms.", 
    "40": "The role of bradycardia in reducing exercise-induced ischaemia and wall dysfunction was examined in dogs with single vessel chronic coronary artery stenosis created using an ameroid constrictor. Treadmill exercise produced significant regional myocardial ischaemia (blood flow measured using microspheres) and contractile dysfunction (systolic wall thickening measured with sonomicrometers). Dogs were initially studied during a control run before and during a second identical run after administration of the cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker atenolol, which improved regional ischaemic function from 4.4 +/- 3.7% to 8.5 +/- 2.8% and subendocardial perfusion from 0.43 +/- 0.23 to 0.55 +/- 0.29 ml min-1 g-1. In another group of dogs during a run with atenolol, the heart rate was paced to match the rate observed in the control run. During the atenolol run with pacing, all beneficial effects of atenolol observed at the reduced exercise heart rate were lost. A third group of dogs received the bradycardic agent UL-FS 49 (1.0 mg kg-1, i.v.) prior to exercise. UL-FS 49 produced a heart rate reduction during exercise from 230 +/- 19 to 139 +/- 10 beats min-1; this was associated with an increase in systolic wall thickening from 9.3 +/- 5.0% (during the control run) to 21.5 +/- 8.4%, thereby eliminating the exercise-induced contractile dysfunction. Transmural myocardial blood flow per beat to the poststenotic myocardium was improved significantly from 4.8 X 10(-3) +/- 1.9 X 10(-3) ml beat-1 to 9.8 X 10(-3) +/- 1.7 X 10(-3). Atrial pacing to match heart rate to the control exercise rate during the UL-FS 49 run did not eliminate all of the improvement in systolic wall thickening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "Alinidine and ULFS 49, two specific bradycardic agents were comparatively investigated with propranolol in a model of exercise-induced regional myocardial contractile dysfunction in dogs. Standardized treadmill exercise resulted in a marked decrease in regional function in the myocardium supplied by the critically stenosed circumflex branch of the left coronary artery. All three drugs prevented exercise-induced myocardial dysfunction. The effect on the exercise-induced increase in heart rate and left ventricular dp/dt, however, suggests different modes of action. Propranolol prevents dysfunction by a marked negative inotropy and negative chronotropy, alinidine by a marked negative chronotropy and moderate negative inotropy, but ULFS 49 prevents dysfunction solely by a marked negative chronotropic effect.", 
    "42": "In an attempt to evaluate the propranolol (P) concentration-effect relationship, percentage reduction in exercise heart rate was modeled as a function of unbound and total P concentrations using the linear, Emax, and sigmoid Emax models. Nine volunteers underwent repeated treadmill exercise tests over 48 hr during a control period, after receiving 160 mg of P orally and again after receiving 160 mg once daily for 7 days. Beta blockade was assessed as the percentage reduction in exercise heart rate compared to control. Total serum P concentrations were determined by HPLC and unbound fractions by equilibrium dialysis. Using nonlinear least-squares regression, the Emax model was best in describing the concentration-effect relationship in each subject. Mean parameters for combined single dose and steady state were Emax 33.6 +/- 4.5% and EC50 18.2 +/- 15.6 ng/ml for total P and Emax 33.5 +/- 4.3% and EC50 1.66 +/- 1.56 for unbound P. Model fits were not significantly better for unbound versus total P and EC50 values showed similar intersubject variability. The observed unbound EC50 values are consistent with reported receptor dissociation constants. Therefore the large intersubject variability in EC50 could not be accounted for by variability in P protein binding.", 
    "43": "Microelectrode recordings of muscle nerve sympathetic activity (MSA) in man have shown a reflex relationship between heart beat and corresponding sympathetic burst, the latency of which is stable at rest and independent of heart rate. In peroneal nerve recordings in 35 healthy subjects this latency was reduced during the Valsalva manoeuvre by 120 ms (mean; range 40-245 ms; P less than 0.001) from a mean value at rest of 1300 ms. Slow deep breathing and simulated diving shortened the latency by 60 (P less than 0.001) and 80 ms (P less than 0.05), respectively. When intrinsic heart rate was induced by i.v. administration of atropine and propranolol, the latency was increased by 70 ms (P less than 0.001). A number of other manoeuvres affecting the outflow of MSA did not change the latency. It is suggested that the findings indicate the existence of more than one central pathway involved in the baroreflex regulation of MSA. Alternatively, altered central processing time may follow influence from other receptors in different manoeuvres.", 
    "44": "Spectral analysis was utilized in order to determine the influence of postural change on heart rate fluctuations and respiratory frequencies and to evaluate the frequency-specific contributions of both vagal and beta-adrenergic mechanisms to the genesis of the heart rate fluctuations during change in posture. In unmedicated subjects the total power (0.01-0.5 Hz) of heart rate fluctuations and the relative power at the mid-frequency band (0.05-0.15 Hz) were significantly increased in response to postural change, while the relative power of high-frequency fluctuations (0.15-0.5 Hz) was significantly depressed. Low-frequency fluctuations (0.01-0.05 Hz) were unchanged. The respiratory frequency was non-significantly slowed. The coherence between heart rate and respiration showed a significant reduction during orthostatic load. The heart rate fluctuations above 0.05 Hz were abolished by vagal blockade, during supine rest, while beta-adrenergic blockade reduced fluctuations at the mid-frequency band. Combined blockade caused a depression of heart rate fluctuations over the entire frequency range. On standing, vagal blockade or autonomic double blockade caused a decrease in heart rate fluctuations at each frequency band. After beta-adrenergic blockade alone, mid-frequency and high-frequency fluctuations were significantly reduced. The coherence between heart rate and respiration was nearly abolished under vagal blockade in each body posture. We conclude that the increased sympathetic outflow during orthostatic load is reflected by a marked increase in heart rate spectral power densities in the mid-frequency range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "The metabolites of 1-tert.-butylamino-3-(2-cyclopentylphenoxy)propan-2-ol (penbutolol, Betapressin), penbutolol 2-glucuronide, 4'-OH-penbutolol 2-glucuronide, 4'-OH-penbutolol 4-sulfate and 1\"-dehydropenbutolol 2-glucuronide were determined in urine by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The compounds were determined after direct injection, that is to say without prior cleavage of the conjugates to the corresponding aglycones. In the case of the glucuronides, the urine was injected into the HPLC system without further sample preparation. The sulfate was determined after ion-pair extraction. Fluorimetric detection was employed. Depending on the compound, the detection limits lay between 0.07 and 0.3 micrograms/ml. This method was used to determine the cumulative urinary excretion of a subject.", 
    "46": "The role of glucagon and catecholamines on serum and liver metallothionein (MT) concentrations in basal and stress conditions has been studied. Glucagon showed no effect on serum MT either in basal (unstressed) or stress (20 hours of restraint) conditions. In contrast, glucagon administration increased both unstressed and stressed levels of liver MT. No effect of the alpha + beta-catecholamine blocker labetalol on serum MT levels was observed in unstressed rats. However, the administration of labetalol abolished the increase in serum MT levels caused by stress. These data suggest that catecholamines might be involved in serum MT regulation during stress, while they might not be important in the maintenance of basal serum MT levels. Finally, no significant effect of adrenergic blockade was found on basal and stress levels MT, in agreement with previous data from this laboratory.", 
    "47": "1. The ventilatory responses to step changes from rest to 100 W cycling exercise were studied in five healthy human subjects. Exercise was performed in hypoxia (end-tidal O2 pressure, PET,O2, 50-55 mmHg), a condition characterized by a marked enhancement of arterial chemoreceptor activity, and in hyperoxia (PET,O2 greater than 250 mmHg), a condition in which arterial chemoreceptor activity is largely suppressed. The subjects were studied at each O2 level after placebo and after an oral dose of 120 mg propranolol. 2. The magnitude of phase 1, the immediate, rapid ventilatory response at the onset of work, was unaffected by hypoxia and at both oxygen levels it was also unaffected by propranolol. 3. Phase 2, analysed from 20 to 120 s after the onset of exercise, was significantly affected by both O2 level and beta-blockade. The kinetics of the ventilatory changes in this phase were well described in all four conditions by a simple exponential function. The overall mean time constants after placebo were shorter in hypoxia (31.0 s) than in hyperoxia (40.2 s), and at each O2 level longer after propranolol, in hypoxia 61.3 s and in hyperoxia 106.0 s. 4. Continuous analysis of gas sampled at the mouth with a mass spectrometer showed constancy of end-tidal PCO2 throughout the step change in hypoxia both with and without beta-blockade. In contrast, in both hyperoxic conditions PET,CO2 rose, mainly in phase 2, to a value 5-6 mmHg higher than the starting value. 5. The steady-state ventilation was higher in hypoxia than in hyperoxia, and end-tidal CO2 pressure, PET,CO2, correspondingly lower. Neither ventilation nor PCO2 were, however, affected by propranolol in either condition. 6. It is concluded that the arterial chemoreceptors are important for both the rate of adaptation of ventilation to a new rate of metabolism during a step change of work rate, and for the matching of ventilation to CO2 flow which normally ensures isocapnia. The further slowing of the dynamics of the ventilatory response in hyperoxia as well as the preserved isocapnia in hypoxia after beta-blockade argue against any major role of beta-adrenergic mechanisms for these functions of the arterial chemoreceptors. The observed effects are considered to be secondary to the reduced cardiac output and an increased CO2 storage initially during exercise following beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "48": "Effects of diazepam on the pacemaker activity and atrial contractility were investigated using the isolated and blood-perfused canine atrium. When diazepam in a dose range of 3-300 micrograms was injected directly into the sinus node artery, biphasic (negative followed by positive) chrono- and inotropic responses were dose-relatedly evoked. These responses were not affected by atropine in a dose which blocked ACh-induced negative ones. Propranolol inhibited positive chrono- and inotropic responses to diazepam, and prolonged the duration of the negative responses. Imipramine, in a dose which blocked tyramine-induced positive responses, significantly augmented the positive inotropic responses to diazepam. From these results, it is suggested that diazepam induces direct negative chrono- and inotropic effects, the mechanism of which remains to be defined, and indirect positive effects by catecholamine release from the sympathetic nerve terminals, though not mediated by a tyramine-like action. Diazepam tended to potentiate negative chrono- and inotropic effects of adenosine but not significantly, suggesting that diazepam plays a minor role as an adenosine potentiator in the dog right atrium.", 
    "49": "The influence of propranolol and verapamil, i.e. two cardiodepressant drugs differing in their pharmacological actions, on cellular autophagy in the left ventricular myocardium of the rat was investigated. In the first experimental series 10 animals were given propranolol subcutaneously (3 mg/kg body weight). Ten controls received physiological saline. In the second series 8 animals were treated with verapamil subcutaneously (9 mg/kg body weight) and 8 controls with physiological saline. Two to 4 h after the injections in the first series and 1 3/4 to 3 h in the second series retrograde perfusion fixation was carried out via the abdominal aorta with a paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde mixture. Myocardial tissue from the left anterior wall was processed for electron microscopy and was morphometrically evaluated for volume fraction and numerical density of early stages of autophagic vacuoles (AVs). Propranolol and verapamil significantly increased the AV volume fraction 4.3- and 2.7-fold, respectively. The numerical density was increased by the two drugs, although to a lesser degree (2.3-fold, and 1.7-fold, respectively). As verapamil affects neither the beta-adrenoreceptors nor the intracellular levels of the second messenger cAMP, the only common denominator for the stimulation of cellular autophagy seems to be the cardiodepressive effect of the two drugs. The data suggest that the rise in cellular autophagy is an early regulatory step in the adaptation of heart muscle mass to reduced work load.", 
    "50": "1 Immunohistochemistry was applied to study the presence of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) in cerebrovascular nerves of monkeys, and serotonergic receptors were characterized in the vessels by in vitro pharmacology. 2 A well-developed plexus of 5-HT immunoreactive fibres was found to supply the pial arteries at the base of the brain. The network closely resembled the distribution of neural DBH, used as an index for noradrenergic nerves. 3 5-HT contracted the basilar artery (BA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) with equal potency and intrinsic activity. The effect was not antagonized by phentolamine or propranolol. 4 The 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin, inhibited the response to 5-HT in a competitive manner in both vessels, with pA2 values obtained from Schild plots of 9.15 in BA and 9.40 in MCA. 5 Electrical field stimulation elicited a neurogenic contraction that was completely blocked by 3 X 10(-7) M tetrodotoxin, 3 X 10(-6) M guanethidine, and 10(-6) M phentolamine. The response was also antagonized by ketanserin, but only in concentrations higher than those inhibiting the response to 5-HT. 6 In accordance with the findings during nerve stimulation, noradrenaline (NA) contracted the pial arteries, particularly MCA where the intrinsic activity closely resembled the value obtained with 5-HT. Ketanserin antagonized the response, but less efficiently than that induced by 5-HT. 7 5-HT had no effect on the (noradrenergic) neurogenic contraction obtained during electrical stimulation. Nor did 5-HT affect the contraction induced by exogenous NA. 8 It is concluded that 5-HT and NA may be co-localized in perivascular nerves of the monkey brain. 5-HT contracts pial arteries through postjunctional 5-HT2 receptors, but does not seem to interfere prejunctionally with the noradrenergic nerves or with exogenous NA.", 
    "51": "1. The effects of various drugs on excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) elicited by field stimulation of the longitudinal smooth muscle of the guinea-pig vas deferens were examined using the sucrose-gap method. 2. Field stimulation with a single pulse (1.0 ms, 20 Vcm-1) produced a depolarization of 3-7 mV. When a single pulse was repetitively applied, the depolarization showed summation, resulting in action potential firing. 3. Tetrodotoxin (1 microM) and guanethidine (1 microM) completely suppressed EJPs whilst propranolol (1 microM) or atropine (0.1 microM) did not affect them. Phentolamine (1 microM) slightly potentiated EJPs. 4. d-Tubocurarine (dTC) at lower concentrations (0.5-2 microM) suppressed EJPs, but at a higher concentration (20 microM) the drug little affected them. 5. Hexamethonium (C6) suppressed EJPs at low concentrations (0.5-5 microM), but potentiated them at a higher concentration (50 microM). 6. Either dTC or C6, each at a concentration of 0.5 microM, did not affect the depolarization induced by exogenously applied ATP or noradrenaline. 7. These results suggest that in this tissue cholinergic nerve activity can contribute to the magnitude of EJPs, and that this effect is mediated through nicotinic receptors.", 
    "52": "In 25 chronic adult rabbits, the functional organization of neurally mediated short-term rhythms and patterns of the heart rate (HR) were investigated. The respiration-unrelated arrhythmia seems to be vagally mediated only, being abolished with atropine. The respiration-related arrhythmia exists not only within the range of respiratory frequency but also in lower frequencies as discovered by spectral and coherence analysis. During motor activity, there is a systematic correlation among increasing premotor, motor and amygdaloid multispike activities, increasing HR and depressed HR-rhythms with limbic initiation of motor and concomitant autonomic patterns, \"Immobile confrontations\" alone produces vagally induced HR-decrease and increased amplitudes of vagal HR-rhythms with a concomitant cortical multispike depression, a mirror image of the autonomic patterns after nociceptive stimulation.",

This report presents the results of 62 serum cholinesterase phenotyping including 12 cases of prolonged apneas. One clinical case of prolonged apnea in a patient homozygous for the atypical cholinesterase gene is presented with a study of his genealogy. The phenotypes were established on the basis of dibuca\u00efne, fluorure, chloride and propranolol differential inhibition. The frequency and significance of the various phenotypes is discussed.", 
    "54": "A pilot study was conducted to find out whether it is possible to achieve a further drop in intraocular pressure in eyes with glaucoma, which is about 22 mmHg after treatment with 0.5% timolol, by employing a combination preparation of timolol 0.5% and pilocarpine 2% or timolol 0.5% and pilocarpine 4% respectively, administered as eyedrops. This resulted in an average additional lowering of 1.9 mmHg after 2 hrs and by 2.1 mmHg after 6 hours (TP2) or by 3.0 mmHg after 2 and 3.5 mmHg after 6 and by 2.7 mmHg after 12 hours (TP4), the therapeutically relevant duration of effectivity being 6 (TP2) or 12 (TP4) hours, respectively.", 
    "55": "Diacetyl nadolol, a prodrug of nadolol and a beta-blocker, has corneal permeability approximately 20 times higher than that of its parent compound due to its higher lipophilicity. Hydrolysis studies were conducted for diacetyl nadolol at various elevated temperatures and pH values to provide stability information for its ophthalmic preparations. The apparent rate constants for diacetyl nadolol hydrolysis to acetyl nadolols and nadolol were determined. Within the neutral pH range (6.8 to 8.2), the hydrolysis of diacetyl nadolol may be proposed as specific base catalysis. Various constants for diacetyl nadolol hydrolysis to acetyl nadolols and acetyl nadolols to nadolol were respectively listed as following: activation energy, 9.78 and 11.39 kcal/mol; entropy at 25 degrees C, -9.78 and -5.86 cal/mol.deg; second-order rate constant at 75 degrees C, 3.47 X 10(4) and 2.22 X 10(4) M-1h-1. According to these kinetic constants, a diacetyl nadolol aqueous solution with pH 6.5 may be prepared as an antiglaucoma agent. The shelf-life was estimated to be only 43 d at room temperature (25 degrees C). However, when the storage temperature is lowered to 5 degrees C, the shelf-life can be extended to greater than 2 years.", 
    "56": "A study of 31 patients with mild or moderate hypertension and 17 patients with severe hypertension was conducted to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of nitrendipine, a new calcium channel blocker with a long duration of action. Nitrendipine (5-40 mg bid) was given as monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide and/or propranolol. Seventeen patients (54%) with mild to moderate hypertension were controlled with nitrendipine alone, but all except one patient with severe hypertension required combination therapy. In patients with mild or moderate hypertension, nitrendipine reduced supine blood pressure from a baseline mean 154/100 mm Hg to 136/87 mm Hg after 1 year of treatment (P less than .05). In patients with severe hypertension, supine blood pressure was reduced from 186/124 mm Hg to 148/91 mm Hg by the end of the planned treatment period (P less than .05; mean duration, 10 weeks). During extended observation, antihypertensive effect was sustained for up to 2.5 years and 1.6 years in patients with mild or moderate and severe hypertension, respectively. Nitrendipine was well tolerated; and only one patient, a moderate hypertensive, discontinued treatment because of pedal edema. The results of this long-term study show that nitrendipine alone or in combination with a diuretic and/or a beta blocker is a safe and effective agent for the treatment of patients with all degrees of hypertension.", 
    "57": "The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of intracoronary administration of dl-propranolol on coronary blood flow and regional myocardial function in anesthetized open-chest dogs. The results were compared with those obtained with d-propranolol, atenolol and lidocaine. Bolus intracoronary injections of dl-propranolol (0.02-2 mg) dose dependently produced transient increases in coronary blood flow and subsequent depression in regional segment shortening which qualitatively resembled those produced by the dextro isomer (0.02-2 mg) and lidocaine (0.2-10 mg). Atenolol (up to 2 mg) was almost devoid of these effects. Isoproterenol-induced responses were abolished by dl-propranolol and atenolol but only incompletely blocked by d-propranolol. These results demonstrate that propranolol at high doses has direct coronary vasodilating and cardiodepressant effects in situ, and indicate that the major part of these effects can be attributed to the membrane-stabilizing action rather than beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "58": "The peak effects of 10 mg nisoldipine p.o. with or without 80 mg propranolol p.o. on systemic and regional haemodynamics in conscious pigs were investigated. Nisoldipine increased heart rate (70%), cardiac output (67%) and maxLVdP/dt (75%), but decreased mean arterial pressure (21%) as systemic vascular conductance increased by 120%. Left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressures were not affected. Vasodilatation occurred in most organs. The increase in left ventricular blood flow (150%) favoured the epicardial (195%) over the endocardial (110%) layers. As a result the endo-epi blood flow ratio decreased by 30%. When nisoldipine was administered simultaneously with propranolol, heart rate (29%), cardiac output (35%) and systemic vascular conductance (65%) increased, but maxLVdP/dt did not change. Mean arterial (18%) and left ventricular systolic (10%) pressure decreased; left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was again unaffected. In most organs vasodilatation was attenuated, but still present, compared to the changes after nisoldipine alone. The increase in epicardial blood flow (70%) again exceeded that in endocardial blood flow (35%), however, the endo-epi ratio decreased by only 15%. In the presence of propranolol, nisoldipine did not exert a negative inotropic action while the reflex-tachycardia was attenuated. In addition, no detrimental effects on perfusion of regional vascular beds were observed.", 
    "59": "With the use of two balloon catheters inserted in the right jugular vein, the following parameters were measured before and after injection of sotalol (1.5 mg/kg): cardiac output with the thermodilution method, hepatic output with the indocyanin green perfusion method, free sub-hepatic pressure, blocked sub-hepatic pressure recorded at rest and during coughing. After 30 minutes, the following modifications were recorded: the cardiac output goes from 6.8 +/- 2.1 to 5.9 +/- 1.9 L/min (NS), the hepatic output goes from 1.9 +/- 1.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.6 L/min (NS), the hepatic pressure gradient goes from 18.2 +/- 6.1 to 11.5 +/- 5.4 mmHg (p less than or equal to 0.0005); the blocked sus-hepatic pressure at rest goes from 25.0 +/- 7.8 to 19.8 +/- 8.0 mmHg (p less than or equal to 0.025); the blocked sus-hepatic pressure during coughing goes from 92 +/- 32 to 82 +/- 39 mmHg (NS). This study demonstrates: a) that the drop in the hepatic pressure gradient induced by a dose of sotalol is more important than that observed by Westaby et al. with propranolol: 37% vs 31% (NS); b) that sotalol cannot lower the blocked sub-hepatic pressure during coughing. This result suggests that the potential protective effect of sotalol toward esophageal varices rupture disappears during coughing.", 
    "60": "A 78-year-old woman admitted for an elective hip operation was maintained on atenolol for control of her hypertension. She received neostigmine and atropine for reversal of muscle relaxation at the end of general anaesthesia. She then developed prolonged bradycardia and hypotension which necessitated the use of adrenaline and isoprenaline. Such an adverse reaction with atenolol has not been described previously.", 
    "61": "The concentration of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent metoprolol was determined in the blood plasma and aqueous humour of two groups of subjects after oral administration of the compound. One group (8 cases) had received a single divided dose of metoprolol, whilst the other group (7 cases) was receiving chronic therapy with the drug. There was a tendency towards a higher concentration of metoprolol in the aqueous humour as compared to the blood plasma in the chronic treatment group in contrast to the 'single' dose group.", 
    "62": "The effect of pharmacologic blockade of beta-adrenoceptors on the relationship between rectal (Tre) and pulmonary artery (Tpa) temperatures was studied in six coronary artery disease patients during 30 min of exercise. Exercise was performed at a set work rate (120 W) on a cycle ergometer before and 2 h after the ingestion of 80 mg propranolol. The heart rate on completion of exercise was reduced (P less than 0.001) from 140 +/- 5 to 108 +/- 3 beats.min-1 by propranolol demonstrating a considerable degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. At rest, neither Tre nor Tpa were modified by propranolol. Likewise, propranolol failed to modify the Tre response to exercise. However, propranolol induced an alteration of the normal relationship between Tre and Tpa during exercise. In particular, although Tre was essentially unchanged, propranolol accentuated both the initial fall (by 0.28 degrees C, P less than 0.001) and the subsequent rise (by 0.46 degrees C, P less than 0.01) in Tpa during exercise. The present data therefore demonstrate a considerable limitation to the use of Tre when assessing thermal homeostasis during acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Furthermore, although research with more chronic therapy is warranted, our study suggests an accentuated risk of hyperthermia and, by implication, its adverse physiologic consequences during prolonged exercise performed by coronary artery disease patients treated with propranolol.", 
    "63": "Twelve hypertensive patients who were already on treatment with atenolol (100 mg once daily) and nifedipine as tablets (20 mg twice daily) were entered into a double-blind, randomized crossover study of the addition of 1 month's treatment with either bendrofluazide (5 mg once daily) or a matching placebo. The addition of bendrofluazide to the combination of atenolol and nifedipine did not cause any statistically significant fall in the blood pressure 2 h after the last dose of nifedipine compared to treatment with placebo [bendrofluazide: 135.2 +/- 5.1/89.8 +/- 2.5 (mean +/- s.e.), versus placebo: 132.1 +/- 4.6/89.9 +/- 3.1 mmHg; P = NS]. However, 12 hours after the last dose of nifedipine blood pressure tended to be lower whilst on bendrofluazide compared with placebo. Plasma urate levels were significantly higher on the diuretic compared to placebo (461 +/- 27 versus 396 +/- 21 mumol P less than 0.001). Plasma potassium was lower on the diuretic compared to placebo (3.59 +/- 0.12 vs 3.76 +/- 0.10) but this difference just failed to reach statistical significance. The results of this study suggest that a thiazide diuretic has little additive effect on blood pressure in patients already on treatment with atenolol and nifedipine, particularly when nifedipine is maximally effective. However, the addition of a diuretic does have potentially deleterious metabolic effects.", 
    "64": "Slow-release nifedipine has been used in the treatment of severe hypertension in 23 pregnant women. In 22 this was in combination with other drugs, in 18 including atenolol. Good control of blood pressure was achieved in 20 women. The perinatal mortality of the group was 130/1000, with a high caesarean section rate (71% of live-births), a high rate of abnormal CTGs, a high rate of premature delivery, and a high rate of infants who were small-for-dates. Whether this is due to the disease process or the medication is uncertain. For the present time these combinations should only be used in severe hypertensives or in the context of a controlled trial.", 
    "65": "Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured with aequorin in ferret and rat aortic strips contracted with phorbol esters. In ferret aorta, 12-deoxyphorbol 13-isobutyrate 20-acetate (DPBA, 1 microM) induced contractions without significantly increasing [Ca2+]i, whereas 21 mM K+ induced smaller contractions with a significant rise in [Ca2+]i. Ca2+-free 2.5 mM ethyleneglycol-bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA)-physiological saline solution (PSS) had no effect on DPBA-induced tension, whereas it abolished contractions induced by 66 mM K+. The alpha 1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (10(-5) M) induced less than 10% of the tension with no initial [Ca2+]i spike under Ca-free conditions. In rat aorta, both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 2 microM) and DPBA (1 microM) induced contractions without increasing [Ca2+]i; Ca2+-free EGTA-PSS or the addition of the calcium channel blocker gallopamil (D600, 1 microM), however, abolished greater than 50% of the tension induced by either phorbol ester with a decrease in [Ca2+]i. These results are consistent with the idea that 1) resting [Ca2+]i is both sufficient and required to support phorbol ester-induced contractions in two vascular smooth muscles, suggesting an increased sensitivity of the contractile apparatus for Ca2+, and 2) there are differences in the mechanisms by which phorbol esters and alpha 1-agonists may activate vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "66": "Both intestinal motility and intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport are influenced by the sympathetic nervous system. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the sympathetically induced inhibition of spontaneous contractile activity and epithelial function, monitoring simultaneously motility, fluid transport, and transmural potential difference (PD) in the rabbit ileum. Experiments were performed in vitro to eliminate any possible indirect effects on intestinal function caused by alterations in intestinal blood flow. Perivascular nerve stimulation induced an inhibition of spontaneous motility, a fall in transmural PD (toward more lumen positive), and an enhanced fluid absorption. The sympathetically induced inhibition of motility was abolished by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, whereas the subsequent administration of phentolamine, the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, was required to abolish the fall in transmural PD. Thus the sympathetic nervous system is capable of simultaneously influencing intestinal motility and fluid and electrolyte function. However, separate but parallel neural mechanisms control the smooth muscle and epithelial responses; the inhibition of motility is beta-mediated, while alpha-receptors alter fluid and electrolyte transport.", 
    "67": "Captopril, a sulfhydryl compound that lowers blood pressure by inhibiting the zinc metalloenzyme, angiotensin converting enzyme, may occasionally result in ageusia, a symptom also associated with zinc deficiency. We therefore studied serum zinc and copper concentrations in a group of 14 essential hypertensive subjects before treatment and after 5-6 months of antihypertensive oral monotherapy with either captopril (50 mg, twice daily; n = 7) or other drugs (propranolol or alphamethyldopa; n = 7). Serum zinc and copper were unaltered by either regimen. Thus, zinc depletion is an unlikely consequence of long-term exposure to captopril, at least in the dosages commonly used for treatment of hypertension.", 
    "68": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of ST 567 in patients suffering from ischaemic heart disease and to compare the effects of this drug with those of propranolol. The study group consisted of 48 male patients, mean age 53, with stable, exercise-induced angina pectoris. After a two-week run-in-placebo period, the patients were randomized to treatment with ST 567 3 X 30 mg (N = 24) and propranolol, 3 X 40 mg (N = 24). The drugs were administered in a double blind fashion during four weeks. Heart rate at rest was decreased by ST 567 from 76 to 65 (P less than 0.005) by propranolol from 76 to 62 (P less than 0.001). Systolic blood pressure was lowered by ST 567 from 131 to 121 (NS) and by propranolol from 133 to 118 (P less than 0.05). Exercise tolerance was increased by ST 567 from 20 X 10(3) to 34 X 10(3) J (P less than 0.05), by propranolol from 26 X 10(3) to 32 X 10(3) J (P less than 0.01) (mean values). Anginal attacks (no. per week) were reduced by ST 567 from 14 to 7 (P less than 0.05) and by propranolol from 14 to 5 (P less than 0.01). Nitroglycerin consumption in no. of tablets per week decreased in ST 567 from 12 to 7 (P less than 0.01), in propranolol from 11 to 4 (P less than 0.0). There were 7 drop outs during treatment with ST 567:2 cases of myocardial infarction, exacerbation of angina in 2 patients, visual disturbances in 2 patients, vertigo in 1 patient. With propranolol we observed worsening of angina in 1 patient, with disturbances in sexual potency in 1.",

    "70": "Alinidine, a drug which reduces heart rate without depressing myocardial function was compared against metoprolol, a beta-blocking drug, in the treatment of stable angina pectoris in a double-blind cross-over trial. It was found that both drugs reduced anginal attacks and nitroglycerine consumption to a comparable degree. Exercise tolerance did not appear to be improved by either drug yet chest pain at ergometry was postponed by both drugs. In the doses used metoprolol was more effective in restraining heart rate, both at rest and even more during exertion. Both drugs were well tolerated and side-effects were few. It seems probable that the optimal dose of alinidine was not used in this trial and that the dosage could have been higher.", 
    "71": "In a randomized, controlled study 10 male patients with angiographically confirmed ischaemic heart disease received AQ-A 39 (falipamil), a heart rate reducing agent in a single intravenous dose (2 mg kg-1) in comparison to propranolol (0.1 mg kg-1). Both drugs reduced heart rate in supine position slightly. The rise of heart rate induced by orthostasis was diminished by AQ-A 39 to 4 +/- 2 beats min-1 and by propranolol 9 +/- 2 beats min-1. After submaximal exercise heart rate during placebo was 129 +/- 3, during AQ-A 39 113 +/- 3 and during propranolol 103 +/- beats min-1. Systolic arterial pressure decreased by propranolol only. The double product obtained by placebo was 231 +/- 10 while it was for 194 +/- 9 after AQ-A 39 and 158 +/- 6 mmHg min-1 after propranolol, respectively. Both substances increased exercise time as compared to placebo. Furthermore, AQ-A 39 increased noradrenaline plasma levels in the upright position and after submaximal exercise compared to the values obtained following placebo. The dose of isoproterenol necessary to induce an increase of heart rate by 20 beats min-1 was after AQ-A 39 4.2 times greater and following propranolol 9.2 times greater than during placebo. The results suggest that AQ-A 39 will be useful in the short term management of patients with ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "72": "Fourteen-day anaprilin treatment of coronary patients with varying glucose tolerance has demonstrated that the drug's therapeutic efficiency was greater in patients with normal glucose tolerance. Anaprilin caused a moderate drop in baseline glucose level and considerably limited the degree of hyperglycemia in response to the glucose tolerance test in coronary patients with abnormally low glucose tolerance. Insulin content was virtually unaffected by the drug, irrespective of the type of glucose tolerance.", 
    "73": "Six healthy subjects (two female) aged 23-40 years participated in a double-blind randomized cross-over study to investigate autonomic mechanisms involved in the chronotropic effect of adenosine in conscious man. Adenosine was infused in increasing doses following saline, propranolol (0.2 mg kg-1 body weight) or propranolol (0.2 mg kg-1 plus atropine (0.04 mg kg-1). Heart rate and blood pressure were measured supine, on standing and during a Valsalva manoeuvre. Plasma catecholamines were measured in the supine and standing positions. Following saline, adenosine (up to 120 micrograms kg-1 min-1) caused a dose-related increase in heart rate (mean +/- SD maximum increase 18 +/- 8 bpm; P less than 0.01). The change in heart rate with adenosine after propranolol (12 +/- 9 bpm; P less than 0.05) did not differ significantly from the corresponding change following saline but was abolished by propranolol plus atropine, which, in turn, was associated with a mean maximum decrease in heart rate of 5 +/- 3 bpm (P less than 0.01). The increase in heart rate during the initial 30 s on standing was augmented with adenosine compared with saline (16 +/- 5 bpm; P less than 0.01). A significant increase in plasma noradrenaline on standing was also found with adenosine compared with saline (6.37 +/- 2.86 vs. 4.77 +/- 1.79 nmol 1(-1); P less than 0.05). The heart rate response to the Valsalva manoeuvre was not affected by adenosine. These results suggest that the positive chronotropic effect of infused adenosine in conscious man may in part be caused by an inhibition of cardiac vagal tone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "Mild to moderate hypertension is often an asymptomatic disease, but it is strongly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular, renal and central nervous system morbidity and mortality. Because of the chronic nature of the disease, treatment involves the reduction of blood pressure without functional impairment. Since the adverse effects of pharmacological agents greatly reduce compliance, it is of prime importance not only to control blood pressure but also to preserve the patient's quality of life. Previous studies have demonstrated the adverse effects observed in patients treated with antihypertensive medications, but few have attempted to analyse the impact on the quality of life. Therefore, a multicentre trial was carried out to investigate the quality of life in hypertensive patients before and after treatment with the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol or the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine. Both treatments were effective in the reduction of blood pressure. Preliminary results indicated that patients taking nitrendipine were more vigorous (P less than 0.01) and less fatigued (P less than 0.05) than those taking propranolol. In addition, patients in the propranolol group perceived a decrease in a partner's sexual satisfaction (P less than 0.05). No other major negative impacts on the quality of life were caused by either drug. These preliminary data indicate that nitrendipine and propranolol reduced blood pressure equally, but that nitrendipine caused less of a negative impact on the quality of life than propranolol.", 
    "75": "The metabolic and hormonal response to acute moderate intensity (40% of VO2 max) bicycle exercise was examined in eight uremic subjects maintained on chronic dialysis and in 12 age- and weight-matched controls before and after the administration of low dose, selective (metoprolol) and nonselective (propranolol), beta adrenergic antagonists. The fasting plasma glucose concentration and basal rates of hepatic glucose production (HGP) and tissue glucose disappearance (Rd) were similar in control and uremic subjects. In both groups HGP and Rd increased in parallel during exercise, and the plasma glucose concentration remained constant at the fasting level. However, the increments in Rd (2.27 +/- 0.27 vs. 0.87 +/- 0.31 mg/kg.min, P less than 0.01) and HGP (2.47 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.19 mg/kg.min, P less than 0.01) were 2.5-3 fold greater in the control compared to uremic subjects. Although the VO2max was decreased by 50% (39 +/- 2 vs. 20 +/- 2 ml/min.kg; P less than 0.01), the correlation between Rd and VO2max was weak (r = 0.33, P less than 0.10), suggesting that factors other than diminished physical fitness contribute to diminished tissue uptake of glucose in the dialyzed uremic patients. Following the cessation of exercise, HGP and Rd promptly returned toward basal levels in both uremic and control subjects. The glucose homeostatic response to exercise was not significantly altered by either propranolol or metoprolol. In the postabsorptive state fasting levels of insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, and norepinephrine all were significantly increased in the uremic group (P less than 0.01 to 0.05). During exercise in the healthy young controls the plasma insulin concentration declined and plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels rose three- to fourfold. In contrast, in uremics plasma insulin failed to fall (P less than 0.05) and the increase in circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine levels was markedly impaired (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "76": "Metoprolol slow-release tablets (Durules), 200 mg, given once daily in the morning were compared with placebo in the prophylaxis of classic migraine. The trial comprised eight Scandinavian neurologic centres and was designed as a double-blind cross-over study with 4 weeks' run-in, four weeks washout, and 8 weeks of either treatment. Seventy-seven patients with two to eight migraine attacks per month were entered in the trial, and 73 completed it. A total of 1119 attacks with aura symptoms and 374 without were recorded. Metoprolol was significantly better than placebo with regard to the total frequency of attacks (1.8 versus 2.5 attacks/4 weeks), mean duration of attacks (6.0 versus 8.0 h/attack), mean global rating, and consumption of analgesics per attack. Similar differences could be shown for attacks with aura symptoms alone, except for the duration of attacks. Metoprolol is the first drug for which a prophylactic effect in classic migraine has been convincingly demonstrated.",

Slow-release nifedipine was as effective as nifedipine in the treatment of these patients, both alone and in combination with atenolol.", 
    "78": "Drug-induced ocular pemphigoid has been reported to occur after long-term use of topical glaucoma medications. We have reviewed the literature on drug-induced ocular pemphigoid and have added our experience with five patients with glaucoma who developed ocular cicatricial (benign mucosal) pemphigoid after treatment with various topical glaucoma medications. We also describe a case of timolol-induced ocular pemphigoid. The presentation and progression of drug-induced ocular cicatricial pemphigoid can be variable. We propose that drug-induced ocular pemphigoid represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from a self-limiting, toxic form to a progressive, immunologic form.", 
    "79": "Hepatic and systemic hemodynamics were measured in 19 cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding enrolled in a controlled trial of propranolol for the prevention of rebleeding. The patients were studied on three separate occasions. The first study was performed before randomization within 24 h of the bleeding episode, once hemodynamic stabilization had been achieved. The second study was performed after 10 days of treatment, and the third after 6 mo without rebleeding. Propranolol dosage was titrated according to blood levels. Wedged and free hepatic venous pressures and the hepatic venous pressure gradient were recorded. Hepatic blood flow and cardiac output were also measured. Before treatment, the groups of patients treated with propranolol (n = 11) or placebo (n = 8) were comparable according to clinical, biochemical, and hemodynamic parameters. After 10 days, hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased similarly in the two groups (-20% in the propranolol group, -25% in the placebo group). Cardiac output fell only in the propranolol group (-40%). Hepatic blood flow remained unchanged in either group. After 6 mo, hepatic venous pressure gradient remained lower than the values from the first (within 24 h of bleeding) study in both the propranolol group (n = 5) and the placebo group (n = 6). Our results suggest that portal pressure increases shortly after hemorrhage with a return to baseline values 10 days later, and that propranolol does not further magnify these changes. Spontaneous changes in hepatic hemodynamics after variceal hemorrhage must be taken into account when evaluating the effect of pharmacologic agents on portal pressure.", 
    "80": "The effects of mild to moderate exercise (450 kpm/min followed by 600 kpm/min, 20 minutes each) on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) were studied with a group of 12 young patients with newly diagnosed essential hypertension. The mean age was 37 years (range 22-45 years) and mean weight 82 kg. During exercise UAE increased significantly from 12.1 microg/min to 16.7 microg/min. Six of the twelve patients were investigated in an acute study with two exercise tests with minimum one week between one of the times metoprolol was given intravenously and the other time was given placebo. In spite of an effective reduction in systolic blood pressure (in mean 23 mmHg during the maximal workload at 600 kpm/min) no significant difference could be seen in UAE. However, a marked decrease in UAE in six patients treated with beta-blocker in a long-term study was seen. Six months after initiating antihypertensive treatment, the baseline systolic blood pressure was reduced by 38 mmHg and UAE by 63%. The maximal exercise induced increased systolic blood pressure level at 600 kpm/min was reduced by 58 mmHg and UAE by 58%. We conclude that UAE both at rest and during exercise may be a sensitive marker of the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy. UAE is easy to measure and this parameter might be useful in following essential hypertensive patients.", 
    "81": "In anesthetized guinea-pigs previously sensitized to ovalbumin by intratracheal immunization, the intravenous administration of propranolol (3.1 mg/kg) produced an increase in the respiratory insufflation pressure induced by ovalbumin. Atropine (2 mg/kg), zolertine (1 mg/kg) and indomethacin (3.1 mg/kg) did not antagonize the propranolol-induced airway hyperreactivity. Indomethacin at higher dose (10 mg/kg) and BW755c (10 mg/kg) decreased the potentiation of the respiratory insufflation pressure to ovalbumin. Our results suggest that besides the beta-blockade, propranolol-induced bronchial hyperreactivity to ovalbumin in sensitized guinea-pigs could be mediated by leukotrienes.", 
    "82": "The concept that acute myocardial infarction is a dynamic event and that different interventions can modify the extent of the necrosis, has led to renewed interest in early pharmacological and surgical treatments designed to reduce the ischemic injury. To evaluate the effects of different pharmacological interventions aimed to reduce the extent of necrosis, we studied 166 patients (138 male and 28 female, mean age of 59.4 +/- 11.3 years) admitted within 6 h after chest pain and treated with a single therapy during the first 72 h. Enzymatic infarct size (IS) was calculated by serial creatine kinase isoenzyme MB determinations using a compartmental model. Six groups of patients were evaluated: 33 patients were treated only with antiplatelet drugs, 38 with anticoagulants, 34 with intravenous thrombolytic therapy, 20 with calcium channel blockers, 25 with nitrates, and 16 with beta-blockers. Estimated IS (gEq/m2) and elimination constant (Kd, U/L/h) did not differ in the six groups, but patients treated with streptokinase had higher release constant (Ka, U/L/h) and shorter time to peak CK-MB value. Early treatment (less than or equal to 2 h after chest pain) had a favourable effect on the enzymatic IS only in patients treated with calcium channel blockers (p less than 0.005).", 
    "83": "Single cells and whole tissue specimens were used in this study to determine sources of Ca2+ utilized for contraction of the circular muscle layer of esophagus and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) of the cat. In vitro circular muscle specimens from the cat esophagus respond to electrical stimulation with phasic contractions at the end of the stimulus, whereas the LES spontaneously maintains tonic contraction and relaxes during stimulation. In Ca2+-free buffer, esophageal contractions rapidly decline and disappear within 10 min after the removal of Ca2+, while LES tone is only partially reduced. Similarly, incubation in a solution containing the Ca2+ influx blocker, La3+, abolishes esophageal contraction but only partially decreases LES tone. Conversely, strontium and caffeine substantially reduce LES tone without affecting the amplitude of esophageal contractions. In single muscle cells isolated by enzymatic digestion from the LES and the body of the esophagus, blockade of extracellular Ca2+ influx by methoxyverapamil (D 600) or ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethylether) N,N'-tetraacetic acid abolished esophageal contraction in response to acetylcholine without affecting LES cells, and conversely, strontium abolished LES contraction without affecting esophageal cells. These data are consistent with the view that extracellular Ca2+ is required to initiate esophageal phasic contraction, while the LES has the ability to utilize intracellular Ca2+ to maintain resting tone and to contract in response to acetylcholine."
