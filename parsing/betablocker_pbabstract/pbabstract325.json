Beta-receptor blocker therapy has been effective in improving clinical status and left ventricular function in patients with heart failure. Similarly, high doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with nitrates partially reverse the ventricular remodeling of heart failure.", 
    "1": "We tested the hypothesis that beta-blocker therapy added to high-dose ACE inhibitor-nitrates would potentiate the reversal of heart failure.", 
    "2": "Thirteen patients, aged 52 +/- 8 years, with moderate to severe heart failure, 12 of whom were referred for transplant consideration, with heart failure duration of 4.8 +/- 2.2 years, were prospectively followed for 12 months. Baseline echocardiographic ejection fraction was 19 +/- 8%, and presenting New York Heart Association class was 2.9 +/- 0.7. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nitrates were uptitrated over 6 months to a final dose of lisinopril 53 +/- 31 mg/day, and isosorbide dinitrate 217 +/- 213 mg/day. At 6 months, beta-blocker therapy with atenolol was initiated and titrated to a final dose of 46 +/- 23 mg/day. Two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography and metabolic stress testing were performed at baseline, at 6 months on lisinopril-nitrates only, and at 12 months on combined ACE inhibitor-nitrate and beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "3": "New York Heart Association classification improved from 2.9 +/- 0.7 to 1.8 +/- 0.8 on lisinopril-nitrates (p < 0.05), and to 1.5 +/- 0.5 with the addition of beta blockade (p = NS). On follow-up, peak oxygen consumption rose from 17 +/- 7 ml O2/kg/min at baseline to 21 +/- 5 ml O2/kg/min at 6 months on lisinopril-nitrates (p = 0.06) without further change on beta blockade. Ejection fraction rose from 19 +/- 8 to 33 +/- 14% on lisinopril-nitrates at 6 months (p = 0.005) and to 36 +/- 18% on beta blockade at 12 months (p = NS).", 
    "4": "High-dose ACE inhibitor-nitrate therapy significantly improved patient clinical status and left ventricular systolic function in heart failure. The addition of beta-receptor blockade over and above high-dose ACE inhibitor-nitrates was well tolerated but had no further impact on symptomatic status, exercise tolerance, or left ventricular systolic function. The potential for pharmacologic reversal of heart failure remodeling may be finite despite the use of complementary therapies. Larger placebo-controlled and randomized trials of beta-receptor blockade added to high-dose ACE inhibitor-nitrate therapy are needed to confirm these observations.", 
    "5": "We recently demonstrated that the ratio between colonic K+ absorptive and K+ secretive pathways was higher in infant than in adult rats. To test the hypothesis that hormones selectively affect these pathways during ontogeny we examined the effect of adrenergic agonists on cellular K+ uptake in distal colon from infant (10-day-old) and adult (50-day-old) rats. Here we describe that adrenaline (10(-5) M) increased total and ouabain-insensitive 86Rb uptake in both age groups, but it did not affect ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake. This stimulation was more pronounced in adult than in infant rats. The effect of adrenaline was mediated via beta-adrenergic receptors. Incubation in vitro with beta-agonist, isoproterenol, stimulated SCH-28080-sensitive, i.e. H+, K(+)-ATPase-dependent, 86Rb uptake in adult but not in infant rats. The threshold dose of beta-agonist was at 10(-7) M, and the maximal activation was observed at 10(-5) M. In vivo inhibition of beta-adrenergic system with propranolol caused a significant decrease in H+, K(+)-ATPase-dependent 86Rb uptake in infant but not in adult colon. In conclusion, this study suggests that the higher colonic K+ absorption in infant rats may be as a result of a selective beta-adrenergic up-regulation leading to stimulation of the apical H+, K(+)-ATPase.", 
    "6": "As experience with beta-blocker use in patients with congestive heart failure is increasing, enthusiasm for carvedilol use in these patients is also increasing. Dermatological reactions to carvedilol are rare and have not been well described in the literature. A patient who developed an acute dermatological reaction after one dose of 3.125 mg carvedilol is presented. Given the rapid onset of symptoms experienced by the patient after a single, small dose of carvedilol, clinicians should be aware of the potential adverse effects of the drug.", 
    "7": "Arrestins have been shown to act as adaptor proteins that mediate the interaction of G protein-coupled receptors with the endocytic machinery. In this study, the role of arrestin-3 in receptor internalization was investigated by constructing different arrestin-3 minigenes that could potentially act as dominant negative inhibitors of arrestin function. Expression of arrestin-3 proteins containing amino acids 1-320 or 201-409 resulted in the inhibition of beta2-adrenergic receptor internalization in HEK-293 cells by approximately 40%. Both of these arrestins were diffusely localized within the cytoplasm of transfected cells, were unable to mediate redistribution of receptors to clathrin-coated pits, and did not localize to coated pits in either the presence or absence of receptor and agonist. Arrestin-3(1-320), but not arrestin-3(201-409), bound to light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin with an affinity comparable with that of wild-type arrestin-3. In contrast, expression of arrestin-3 proteins composed of only the clathrin binding domain, arrestin-3(284-409), and arrestin-3(290-409) resulted in the constitutive localization of these arrestins to coated pits. Arrestin-3(284-409) and arrestin-3(290-409) acted as dominant negative inhibitors of wild-type arrestin function, inhibiting receptor internalization by 70 and 30%, respectively. Carboxyl-terminal deletions of arrestin-3 retained the ability to promote internalization until residues amino-terminal to amino acid 350 were deleted, suggesting that residues in this region also compose part of the clathrin binding domain in addition to the major binding site between residues 371-379. These studies characterize at least two distinct mechanisms, competition for either receptor or clathrin binding, by which dominant negative arrestins inhibit receptor internalization and further define residues within arrestin-3 that constitute the clathrin binding domain.", 
    "8": "The electrophysiological effects of UTP on freshly isolated rat aortic myocytes were examined using the perforated patch clamp technique. Application of alpha,beta-methylene ATP (alphabeta-meATP) and UTP, putative P2X and P2Y2 or P2Y4 purinoceptor agonists, induced transient and oscillatory inward currents, respectively. Experiments with Cl- channel blockers and different external Cl- concentrations demonstrated that the oscillatory current elicited by UTP is attributable to activation of Cl- channels. The transient component elicited by (alphabeta-meATP appeared to be responsible for a non-selective cationic current. With internal application of low-molecular-weight heparin, a blocker of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), the oscillatory current elicited by UTP was abolished. The oscillatory current was activated in an all-or-none manner by UTP over the concentration range 0.1 and 1 microM and the frequency and amplitude were independent of the UTP concentration. Under current-clamp mode, UTP produced an oscillatory membrane potential. These results show that rat aortic myocytes have at least two types of P2 receptors. Activation of the P2Y receptor by UTP produces InsP3, which releases Ca2+ from the store site. The resulting increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration causes the oscillatory Cl- current and the subsequent membrane potential changes.", 
    "9": "Although the underlying mechanisms no doubt differ, activation of the sympathetic nervous system is an important pathophysiological feature in primary arterial hypertension, in portal hypertension accompanying hepatic cirrhosis, and in heart failure, and is a logical therapeutic target for centrally acting sympathetic nervous system suppressant drugs. Portal hypertension: The sympathetic outflows to skeletal muscle vasculature, the heart, the kidneys and to the hepatomesenteric circulation are stimulated in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, perhaps as a reflex response to the vasodilatation and vascular shunting present. Acute dosing with clonidine produces dose dependent reduction in noradrenaline spillover from visceral organs and reduction in hepatic vein wedge pressure, with preservation of hepatic blood flow and negligible fall in arterial pressure. These findings indicate the clinical potential of drugs such as clonidine, moxonidine and rilmenidine for chronically lowering portal venous pressure in cirrhosis. Arterial hypertension: Activation of the sympathetic outflow to the heart, kidneys and skeletal muscle vasculature is commonly present in younger (< 45 years) patients with essential hypertension. The sympathetic stimulation appears to have adverse consequences in hypertensive patients beyond blood pressure elevation. Neural vasoconstriction in skeletal muscle has metabolic effects by impairing glucose delivery, which is a basis for insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Within the heart a trophic effect of sympathetic activation on cardiac growth, contributing to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, and an arrhythmogenic effect are also likely. Cardiac failure: The cardiac sympathetic nerves are preferentially stimulated in severe heart failure, with norepinephrine release from the failing heart at rest being increased as much as 50-fold, similar to the level seen in healthy people during near maximum exercise. This preferential activation of the cardiac sympathetic outflow contributes to arrhythmogenesis and possibly to progression of the heart failure, and has been directly linked to mortality; a high rate of spillover of noradrenaline from the heart is a strong, independent predictor of poor prognosis in severe cardiac failure. The mechanisms underlying sympathetic nervous stimulation are not entirely clear. Increased intracardiac diastolic pressure seems to be one peripheral signal, and increased forebrain norepinephrine turnover an important central mechanism. Following the demonstration of the beneficial effect of the beta-adrenergic blocker, carvedilol, and with second generation centrally acting sympathetic suppressants now under clinical investigation, elucidation of the abnormalities in central nervous control of sympathetic outflow in heart failure has become clinically relevant.", 
    "10": "The agonist radioligand N-[2-hydroxy-5-[1-hydroxy-2-[[2-(4-[11C]-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]am ino]ethyl]phenyl]formamide ([11C]formoterol) was synthesised in order to test its ability to visualise pulmonary beta2-adrenoceptors in vivo, with positron emission tomography (PET). Formoterol was labelled via reaction of a dibenzyl-protected precursor with [11C]CH3I. Subsequent deprotection with Pd/C and H2 yielded [11C]formoterol in 5-15% (corrected for decay) and the specific activity ranged from 5.5-22.2 TBq mmol (150-600 Ci mmol(-1)), 60-70 min after end of bombardment. Biodistribution studies with [11C]formoterol were performed in male Wistar rats which were either untreated or predosed with (D,L)-propranolol hydrochloride (2.5 mg kg(-1), beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), erythro-DL-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminobuta n-2-ol hydrochloride (ICI 118551, 0.15 mg kg(-1), beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist), isoprenaline (15 mg kg(-1), non-subtype selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist) or (+/-)-(2-hydroxy-5-[2-((2-hydroxy-3-(4-((1-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl)1H-i midazol-2-yl-)phenoxy)propyl)amino)ethoxy]benzamide)monomethane sulfonate (CGP 20712A, 0.15 mg kg(-1), beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist). Lungs, heart, liver and plasma were analysed for radioactive metabolites. The kinetics of [11C]formoterol in the lungs of male Wistar rats were investigated by means of a dynamic PET study. The biodistribution studies showed significant specific binding in tissues known to contain beta2-adrenoceptors (lungs, spleen, and heart). Binding in these organs was blocked by ICI 118551 and isoprenaline, but not by CGP 20712A. [11C]Formoterol was rapidly metabolised in rats but lungs and heart did not substantially take up the labelled metabolites. The binding of [11C]formoterol in various tissues of rats is consistent with the beta2-selectivity of formoterol. Whether [11C]formoterol selectively binds to the high affinity state of beta2-adrenoceptors remains to be elucidated. [11C]Formoterol is potentially useful for studying beta2-adrenoceptors with PET and this radioligand may provide new insights in the mechanisms underlying prolonged sympathomimetic action.", 
    "11": "Angiotensin II receptor antagonists lower blood pressure by blocking the final step in the renin pathway, whereas ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II production. ACE inhibitors also block kinin degradation, which may alter both efficacy and side-effects. Irbesartan, one of the newer receptor antagonists, has confirmed their tolerability and shown similar dose-related efficacy to other major classes.", 
    "12": "Nightly melatonin (MEL) durations > 8 h provoke gonadal regression and decreases in body mass, whereas signals < 7 h stimulate gonadal and somatic growth in male Siberian hamsters. The authors sought to determine the minimum frequency of short MEL signals sufficient to induce the long-day phenotype in several photoperiodic traits. D,L-propranolol (hereafter propranolol) injections shortened MEL signals on the night of treatment without altering MEL on the subsequent night; this permitted interpolation of short MEL signals at variable frequencies against a background of long MEL signals (chimeras). Hamsters kept in short days (10 h light/day, 10L) were injected with propranolol 6 h after dark onset for 28 consecutive weeks beginning at 30 days of age (Week 0) either every other day or once every 3, 6, or 9 days. Control animals were injected with saline or with propranolol during the light phase or were transferred to long days (16L) at Week 0. Hamsters in 16L underwent rapid gonadal development and increases in body mass and displayed summer pelage color, as did hamsters treated with propranolol every other day. Animals treated with propranolol less frequently than every other day uniformly maintained undeveloped gonads and winter-like body weights, but pelage color became proportionately darker with increased frequency of propranolol treatments. The onset of spontaneous testicular development in 10L was unaffected by propranolol injections. After termination of injections at Week 28, testicular regression was not observed in most 10L animals that previously had undergone spontaneous testicular development; however, 40% of hamsters that had been injected with propranolol every 3rd night did manifest the winter phenotype after Week 28. In an alternating sequence, short MEL signals completely override long signals and induce the summer phenotype. Threshold frequencies differ for MEL stimulation of long-day pelage and gonadal phenotypes. The timing and development of refractoriness to MEL does not depend in any simple manner on the number of long MEL signals or on the accumulation of a reaction product produced by long, and depleted by short, MEL signals.", 
    "13": "Cilostazol is an antiplatelet agent and vasodilator marketed in Japan for treatment of ischemic symptoms of peripheral vascular disease. It is currently being evaluated in the United States for treatment of symptomatic intermittent claudication (IC). Cilostazol has been shown to improve walking distance in patients with IC. In addition to its reported vasodilator and antiplatelet effects, cilostazol has been proposed to have beneficial effects on plasma lipoproteins. We examined the effect of cilostazol versus placebo on plasma lipoproteins in 189 patients with IC. After 12 weeks of therapy with 100 mg cilostazol BID, plasma triglycerides decreased 15% (P<0.001). Cilostazol also increased plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (10%) and apolipoprotein (apo) A1 (5.7%) significantly (P<0.001 and P<0.01, respectively). Both HDL3 and HDL2 subfractions were increased by cilostazol; however, the greatest percentage increase was observed in HDL2. Individuals with baseline hypertriglyceridemia (>140 mg/dL) experienced the greatest changes in both HDL-C and triglycerides with cilostazol treatment. In that subset of patients, HDL-C was increased 12.2% and triglycerides were decreased 23%. With cilostazol, there was a trend (3%) toward decreased apoB as well as increased apoA1, resulting in a significant (9.8%, P<0.002) increase in the apoA1 to apoB ratio. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) concentrations were unaffected. Cilostazol treatment resulted in a 35% increase in treadmill walking time (P=0.0015) and a 9.03% increase in ankle-brachial index (P<0.001). These results indicate that in addition to improving the symptoms of IC, cilostazol also favorably modifies plasma lipoproteins in patients with peripheral arterial disease. The mechanism of this effect is currently unknown.", 
    "14": "We aimed to evaluate the use of evidence-based prophylactic treatment after myocardial infarction on hospital discharge and in primary care after 1 year of hospitalization.", 
    "15": "We conducted a 1-year prospective study of all the patients discharged from a tertiary hospital who had been treated for myocardial infarction from January 1 to December 31 1995. Three hundred and eighty surviving patients were consecutively discharged from the hospital. Seventy per cent of patients were treated with aspirin, 45% with beta-blockers, 27% with calcium channel blockers, 26% with ACE inhibitors, 40% with nitrates and 8% with cholesterol-lowering drugs after discharge from the hospital. In primary care, prescription of lipid-lowering drugs increased to 17%, while prescription of beta-blockers decreased to 34%. ACE inhibitor prescriptions at discharge were clearly more common in patients with impaired ventricular function or heart failure (57%).", 
    "16": "According to the evidence, there is still potential for reducing the risk of a further ischaemic event or death in patients with MI, especially by increasing the use of beta-blockers and lipid-lowering drugs.", 
    "17": "Agitation is a frequent and troublesome problem in the long-term care setting. The term agitation is a nonspecific descriptor of a variety of verbal, vocal, and motor behaviors that can be unsafe, disruptive, and distressing to staff, families, and patients alike. Agitation can occur as a result of psychiatric and nonpsychiatric conditions, and appropriate treatment needs to be directed at the target symptoms. Optimal results are achieved with a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic interventions. In this review, we examine some of the causes and interventions that can assist physicians caring for the agitated elderly in long-term care settings. The role of the atypical antipsychotics is discussed in detail.", 
    "18": "1. In human congestive heart failure beta-adrenoceptor antagonists improve exercise tolerance and cardiac contractility. These beneficial effects are thought to reflect an up-regulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors, involving mainly the beta1-subtype. In the present study we evaluated the functional contribution of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in an animal model of dilated cardiomyopathy, and compared the effects of treatment with propranolol on cardiac beta-adrenergic signal transduction in myopathic and control hamsters. 2. Cardiomyopathic BIO TO2 hamsters and BIO F1B controls aged 270 days were used. In the treatment study, hamsters received drinking water with or without propranolol 40 mg kg(-1) d(-1) for 4 weeks prior to sacrifice. Density and subtype distribution of beta-adrenoceptors were determined in radioligand binding studies. Functional contributions of beta-adrenoceptors were evaluated by subtype-selective stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Cardiac G-protein content was determined by immunoblotting. 3. Compared to BIO F1B controls, myopathic hamsters showed increases in cardiac total beta- and beta2-adrenoceptor density, G(s alpha) and G(i alpha) content. In BIO TO2 ventricles, beta1-adrenoceptors were almost completely uncoupled from adenylyl cyclase stimulation despite an unchanged density. Treatment of hamsters with propranolol resulted in increased density of beta1-adrenoceptors in both strains, but had no effect on their functional efficacy. Moreover, beta2-adrenergic stimulation of adenylyl cyclase was even reduced in propranolol-treated animals, which could not be explained by changes in cardiac G-protein content. 4. Cardiomyopathic BIO TO2 hamsters showed functional uncoupling of cardiac beta1-adrenoceptors, which could not be normalized by propranolol and, therefore, is unlikely to be solely due to agonist-dependent desensitization. The paradoxical reduction in beta2-adrenergic efficiency in propranolol-treated myopathic and control hamsters deserves further investigation.", 
    "19": "1. The goal of this study was to analyse the effects of propafenone and its major metabolite, 5-hydroxy-propafenone, on a human cardiac K+ channel (hKv1.5) stably expressed in Ltk- cells and using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. 2. Propafenone and 5-hydroxy-propafenone inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the hKv1.5 current with K(D) values of 4.4+/-0.3 microM and 9.2+/-1.6 microM, respectively. 3. Block induced by both drugs was voltage-dependent consistent with a value of electrical distance (referenced to the cytoplasmic side) of 0.17+/-0.55 (n=10) and 0.16+/-0.81 (n=16). 4. The apparent association (k) and dissociation (l) rate constants for propafenone were (8.9+/-0.9) x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) and 39.5+/-4.2 s(-1), respectively. For 5-hydroxy-propafenone these values averaged (2.3+/-0.3) x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) and 21.4+/-3.1 s(-1), respectively. 5. Both drugs reduced the tail current amplitude recorded at -40 mV after 250 ms depolarizing pulses to +60 mV, and slowed the deactivation time course resulting in a 'crossover' phenomenon when the tail currents recorded under control conditions and in the presence of each drug were superimposed. 6. Both compounds induced a small but statistically significant use-dependent block when trains of depolarizations at frequencies between 0.5 and 3 Hz were applied. 7. These results indicate that propafenone and its metabolite block hKv1.5 channels in a concentration-, voltage-, time- and use-dependent manner and the concentrations needed to observe these effects are in the therapeutical range.", 
    "20": "In cats, distention of an isolated segment of the ileum with a saline injection elicited its contraction which could be abolished with blockade of muscarinic receptors. Serotonine acting from the ileum lumen enhanced the response, whereas acting from the vascular bed induced a contractile response which could be decreased with the beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agent propranolol. The findings suggest a possibility of the serotonine participation in realisation of peristaltic reflex, the character of its modulating effect being dependent on activation of excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory nonadrenergic neurons.", 
    "21": "Myoelectrical activity of the duodenum and ileum was recorded in rabbits with implanted electrode. Acute haemorrhage caused either elevation or reduction of the firing rate, the responses being abolished with a combined blockade of alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors. Beta-adrenoreceptors agonist isoproterenol resulted in a biphasic (decrease-increase) change of the myoelectrical activity which could be abolished with blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors. The character of the small intestine motor responses to acute haemorrhage and isoproterenol infusion depended on the initial level of the intestinal contractile activity. The findings suggest that catecholamines induce a small intestinal motor effect via stimulation of both inhibitory adrenoreceptors and excitatory presynaptic adrenoreceptors.", 
    "22": "Unilateral microinjections of acetylcholine into the rat solitary tract nucleus evoked inhibitory effects in electrical activity of symmetrical portions of the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles. Administration of propranolol exerted excitatory respiratory responses. The findings suggest participation of cholin- and noradrenergic systems in inhibitory mechanisms of respiratory control. Different roles of the right and left solitary tract nuclei in their involvement in formation of efferent impulses to bilateral inspiratory muscles, are discussed.", 
    "23": "To propose guidelines for treatment based on the study of early and late outcome after various surgical procedures for sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP). PRIMARY BACKGROUND DATA: SEP is rare. The main complication is intestinal obstruction. Ideal treatment is resection of the membrane, whenever possible. Mortality and morbidity, however, have not been well analyzed.", 
    "24": "The case records and histopathological reports of 32 operated cases of SEP (18 centers during 16 years) were retrospectively studied. Patients underwent four types of procedures: group 1 (n = 5), membrane resection; group 2 (n = 12), enterolysis with partial excision of the membrane; group 3 (n = 7), intestinal resection, and group 4 (n = 8), exploratory laparotomy only. Five cases were considered as idiopathic. Medical and surgical antecedent history for the 27 other cases (6 patients had associations) included laparotomy for carcinoma (n = 14) or benign disorders (n = 5), beta-blocker treatment (n = 4), cirrhotic ascites (n = 4), generalized peritonitis (n = 3) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (n = 3). Indications for operation included subacute (n = 22) or acute intestinal obstruction (n = 6), abdominal mass (n = 8), other clinical presentations (n = 4) and asymptomatic SEP discovered during surgery for portacaval shunt (n = 1). Seven patients had two associated clinical presentations. All cirrhotic patients with ascites and the asymptomatic patient were in group 4. None of the imaging techniques (plain radiograms, barium follow-through, sonograms and CT scans) were formally contributive to the preoperative diagnosis of SEP.", 
    "25": "In group 1, both complicated patients, one with an inadvertent intraoperative intestinal wound, the other with a postoperative intestinal leak, healed uneventfully. In group 2, 4 inadvertent intraoperative intestinal wounds led to 4 postoperative leaks with 3 consequent deaths. One further patient died of persistent intestinal obstruction. In group 3, 1 inadvertent intestinal intraoperative wound healed uneventfully and 2 deaths, one due to persistent intestinal obstruction associated with anastomotic leakage and the other due to ventricular fibrillation, were noted. In group 4, there were no intraoperative wounds, no postoperative morbidity or deaths. The median follow-up was 49.5 months (range 4-142 months). Seven patients (1 or 2 in each group) experienced transient episodes of subacute intestinal obstruction between 1 month and 6 years after discharge, none of which required a repeat operation. Eight patients (in all groups) died of their initial cancer between 4 and 75 months after discharge.", 
    "26": "Our results suggest that: (1) resection of the membrane should be attempted when feasible; (2) in case of inadvertent intestinal wound(s), the most proximal one should be brought out as a stoma, and partial resections should not be anastomosed primarily, but (3) no surgical treatment is required in ascites, asymptomatic SEP or subacute intestinal obstruction.", 
    "27": "For the immunopharmacological characterization of murine passive anaphylactic shock, the effects of antihistaminics and/or anti-platelet-activating factor (anti-PAF) agents were studied on the shock mediated by allogeneic monoclonal IgE and IgG1 antibodies and hyperimmune serum. IgE antibody-mediated shock was strongly suppressed by cyproheptadine (10 mg/kg, ip) in every strain regardless of the age and sex of the mice and the presence or absence of a shock potentiator. As far as tested with CTS, DS, and B6D2F1 mice, IgE antibody-mediated shock was also suppressed by the other two antihistamines, triprolidine (10 mg/kg, ip) and oxatomide (100 mg/kg, po). This type of shock was not suppressed by an anti-PAF agent, CV-6209 (3.3 mg/kg, iv), when tested on aged CTS mice given no shock potentiator and young DS mice given a potentiator such as Bordetella pertussis organisms or DL-propranolol. IgG1 antibody-mediated shock was also suppressed by cyproheptadine in general except for CTS mice. Suppression in the DL-propranolol-treated DS and C3H/He mice was not very marked on sensitization with undiluted or slightly diluted IgG1 ascites but quite striking on sensitization with properly diluted ascites. In contrast with the effect of cyproheptadine, suppression by CV-6209 was obvious in aged CTS mice but not in young DL-propranolol-treated DS mice. The shock in DL-propranolol-treated DS mice sensitized with undiluted or slightly diluted ascites was completely abolished by the combined use of these two agents. These results suggest that histamine and/or PAF play a major role in IgE antibody- and IgG1 antibody-mediated shock. However, so far as tested in young DS mice, the shock mediated by hyperimmune serum differed in drug susceptibility from that mediated by the monoclonal antibodies. In the absence of shock potentiators, prevention was produced by cyproheptadine in the males which had been sensitized with the 1:4 or 1:8 dilution of the immune serum. In the presence of DL-propranolol, prevention was not produced even by the combined treatment with cyproheptadine and CV-6209. Therefore, it is likely that some mediators other than histamine and PAF, whose release is triggered by antibody isotypes other than IgE and IgG1, play a greater role for the shock mediated by hyperimmune serum than for the shock mediated by IgE or IgG1 antibody, especially in the presence of shock potentiators.", 
    "28": "Adrenomedullin intracerebroventricularly administered (0.1 to 20 ng/rat i.c.v.), showed significant gastroprotective activity in a dose-dependent manner. When the peptide was intravenously administered (1 to 1000 ng/kg i.v.) it did not show significant gastroprotective activity in the same test. The gastroprotective effect of the peptide (10 ng/rat) was abolished by bilateral adrenalectomy, by pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (1 mg/kg i.p.), or by a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, CGRP-(8-37) fragment (1 or 10 ng/rat i.c.v.). This study showed that adrenomedullin is protective against reserpine-induced gastric lesions, that the action involves sympathetic nerve activity, and moreover interferes with CGRP receptors.",

Gradual prolongation of the QT interval suggested an overdose of sotalol. Sotalol has been commonly used in cases of angina pectoris and hypertension.

    "35": "One day after induction of Thy 1.1 glomerulonephritis, rats were treated with increasing doses of the Ang I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and/or the Ang II receptor blocker losartan in the drinking water. Six days after disease induction the therapeutic effect on glomerular TGF-beta overexpression was evaluated.", 
    "36": "Both enalapril and losartan reduced TGF-beta overproduction in a dose-dependent manner, showing a moderate reduction at doses known to control blood pressure in renal forms of hypertension. A maximal reduction in TGF-beta expression of approximately 45% was seen for both drugs starting at 100 mg/liter enalapril and 500 mg/liter losartan, with no further reduction at doses of enalapril up to 1000 mg/liter or losartan up to 2500 mg/liter. Co-treatment with both drugs was not superior to single therapy. Consistent with our hypothesis that reduction in TGF-beta expression is a valid target, other disease measures, including glomerular matrix accumulation, glomerular production and mRNA expression of the matrix protein fibronectin and the protease inhibitor plasminogen-activator-inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) closely followed TGF-beta expression.", 
    "37": "The data suggest that these therapies act through very similar pathways and that, in order to more effectively treat renal fibrosis, these drugs must be combined with other drugs that act by different mechanisms.", 
    "38": "To examine if acclimation of rats to cold led to alterations in the coupling between different beta-receptor subtypes and thermogenesis in brown fat cells, we investigated the adrenergic response patterns in brown fat cells isolated from warm-acclimated (28 degreesC) and cold-acclimated (4 degreesC) rats. In the cells from warm-acclimated rats, the relative affinities (EC50) for different agonists (isoprenaline, BRL-37344, norepinephrine, CGP-12177, dobutamine, and salbutamol) were those expected from their interaction with a beta3-receptor. The response to norepinephrine was competitively inhibited by propranolol with a pA2 of approximately 6, implying interaction at the beta3-receptor. No evidence for a beta1-receptor-mediated response to the beta1-selective agonist dobutamine could be obtained; the low-affinity response observed was most likely through the beta3-receptor. The beta1-antagonist ICI-89406 could not inhibit a specific fraction of the thermogenic response to norepinephrine. Thus beta3-receptors were the only beta-receptors involved in the control of thermogenesis in brown fat cells from warm-acclimated rats. A modified method of preparation was developed to isolate functional cells from cold-acclimated animals. Also in these cells, the beta-receptor coupled to thermogenesis was the beta3-receptor, although the response was desensitized with an approximately sevenfold shift in EC50 values. The pA2 for propranolol inhibition of norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis was also 6 here, and that for ICI-89406 was 5.5, also implying interaction at the beta3-receptor. Thus acclimation to cold did not alter the beta-adrenergic receptor subtype (beta3) involved in the control of thermogenesis.", 
    "39": "The degree of involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in endothelial dysfunction was investigated by using a one-kidney, one-clip (1K,1C) model of renal hypertension. Male Wistar rats received 0.02% enalapril, 0.02% losartan, or tap water for 1 day before and for 48 h after the induction of renal artery stenosis or sham operation. The aorta of 1K,1C rats showed increased contraction and decreased relaxation responses produced by norepinephrine and acetylcholine, respectively, vs. control responses. Exposure to 10(-5) mol/l NG-monomethyl-L-arginine acetate augmented the contractile responses to norepinephrine to a greater extent in control rats than in the 1K,1C rats. The increased contraction and decreased relaxation responses to these agonists in the 1K,1C rats were normalized by enalapril or losartan. The addition of HOE-140 to the bath did not alter these normalized responses. Results suggest that angiotensin II causes endothelial dysfunction and reduces nitric oxide levels in 1K,1C rats. Such endothelial dysfunction enhanced the norepinephrine-induced contraction during the early-stage hypertension in 1K,1C rats.", 
    "40": "The effect of epinephrine on transport of K+, Na+, Cl-, and HCO-3 across the rat colon was studied using the Ussing chamber technique. Epinephrine (5 x 10(-6) mol/l) induced a biphasic change in short-circuit current (Isc) in distal and proximal colon: a transient increase followed by a long-lasting decay. The first phase of the Isc response was abolished in Cl--poor solution or after bumetanide administration, indicating a transient induction of Cl- secretion. The second phase of the response to epinephrine was suppressed by apical administration of the K+ channel blocker, quinine, and was concomitant with an increase in serosal-to-mucosal Rb+ flux, indicating that epinephrine induced K+ secretion, although this response was much smaller than the change in Isc. In addition, the distal colon displayed a decrease in mucosal-to-serosal and serosal-to-mucosal Cl- fluxes when treated with epinephrine. In the distal colon, indomethacin abolished the first phase of the epinephrine effect, whereas the second phase was suppressed by TTX. In the proximal colon, indomethacin and TTX were ineffective. The neuronally mediated response to epinephrine in the distal colon was suppressed by the nonselective beta-receptor blocker, propranolol, and by the beta2-selective blocker, ICI-118551, whereas the epithelial response in the proximal colon was suppressed by the nonselective alpha-blocker, phentolamine, and by the selective alpha2-blocker, yohimbine. These results indicate a segment-specific action of epinephrine on ion transport: a direct stimulatory action on epithelial alpha2-receptors in the proximal colon and an indirect action on secretomotoneurons via beta2-receptors in the distal colon.", 
    "41": "In the rat muscle vascular bed, vasoconstrictors either increase or decrease oxygen consumption (VO2). The present study compared the effects of norepinephrine (NE), angiotensin II (ANG II), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on vasoconstriction-associated metabolism in the constant-flow perfused hindlimb of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) in the absence of insulin. Basal perfusion pressure, VO2, glucose uptake, and lactate production were increased by 21.4, 11.9, 46.4, and 44.9% (P < 0.05 for all), respectively, in SHR, which also had higher blood pressure and metabolic rate (P < 0.05) in vivo. Dose-response curves for NE-induced perfusion pressure, VO2, and lactate production in SHR were shifted to the left compared with WKY. Associated with the increased perfusion pressure, NE-induced VO2 and glucose uptake were both decreased (P < 0.01), particularly at high concentrations. These differences were unaffected by 10 microM propranolol but were all diminished by further addition of prazosin (2.5 nM). ANG II stimulated VO2, glucose uptake, and lactate production in both strains, but the increased lactate production was smaller in SHR (P < 0.05) with a proportional decrease (P < 0.05) in glucose uptake. Conversely, 5-HT decreased VO2 in both strains (P < 0.01), and this effect was greater in SHR (P < 0.01). These data suggest that SHR muscle thermogenesis and glucose uptake are impaired during vasoconstriction, especially in response to NE.", 
    "42": "Little is known about the regulation of catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis in human skeletal muscle. Therefore, beta-adrenergic regulation of lipolysis and blood flow was investigated in healthy subjects in vivo by use of microdialysis of the gastrocnemius muscle. First, during a hypoglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp, which induces a lipolytic response in skeletal muscle tissue, the muscle was locally perfused with beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. Perfusion with nonselective (propranolol) and beta2-selective (ICI-118551) blocking agents counteracted the hypoglycemia-induced lipolysis (P < 0.01), but perfusion with metoprolol (beta1-blocker) did not affect the glycerol response. Second, selective beta-adrenoceptor agonists were perfused in situ into skeletal muscle during resting conditions. beta2-Adrenoceptor stimulation with terbutaline induced a concentration-dependent increase in skeletal muscle glycerol levels and in tissue blood flow, whereas perfusion with beta1- or beta3-adrenoceptor agonists (dobutamine or CGP-12177) did not influence the glycerol concentration or blood flow. In conclusion, in skeletal muscle tissue, only the beta2-subtype is of importance among beta-adrenoceptors for regulation of lipolysis and blood flow. This is in contrast to adipose tissue, where beta1- and beta3-adrenoceptors are also involved.", 
    "43": "The role of intracellular guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate concentration ([cGMP]i) in nitric oxide (NO)-mediated relaxations in the uterus has become controversial. We found the NO donor S-nitroso-L-cysteine (CysNO) to potently (IC50 = 30 nM) inhibit spontaneous contractions in the nonpregnant human myometrium. CysNO treatment increased [cGMP]i significantly (P < 0.001), and this increase was blocked by the guanylyl cyclase inhibitors methylene blue (10 microM) or LY-83583 (1 microM); however, pretreatment with these guanylyl cyclase inhibitors failed to block CysNO-mediated relaxations. Intracellular cAMP concentrations were not altered by treatment of tissues with 10 microM CysNO. Incubation with the cGMP analogs 8-bromo-cGMP or beta-phenyl-1,N2-etheno-cGMP did not significantly affect spontaneous contractility. Pretreatment of tissues with charybdotoxin [a calcium-dependent potassium channel (BK) blocker] completely reversed CysNO-induced relaxations. We conclude that NO is a potent inhibitor of spontaneous contractile activity in the nonpregnant human uterus and that, although guanylyl cyclase and BK activities are increased by NO, increases in [cGMP]i are not required for NO-induced relaxations in this tissue.", 
    "44": "alpha-Conotoxin MII, a 16-residue polypeptide from the venom of the piscivorous cone snail Conus magus, is a potent and highly specific blocker of mammalian neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors composed of alpha3 beta2 subunits. The role of this receptor type in the modulation of neurotransmitter release and its relevance to the problems of addiction and psychosis emphasize the importance of a structural understanding of the mode of interaction of MII with the alpha3 beta2 interface. Here we describe the three-dimensional solution structure of MII determined using 2D 1H NMR spectroscopy. Structural restraints consisting of 376 interproton distances inferred from NOEs and 12 dihedral restraints derived from spin-spin coupling constants were used as input for simulated annealing calculations and energy minimization in the program X-PLOR. The final set of 20 structures is exceptionally well-defined with mean pairwise rms differences over the whole molecule of 0.07 A for the backbone atoms and 0.34 A for all heavy atoms. MII adopts a compact structure incorporating a central segment of alpha-helix and beta-turns at the N- and C-termini. The molecule is stabilized by two disulfide bonds, which provide cross-links between the N-terminus and both the middle and C-terminus of the structure. The susceptibility of the structure to conformational change was examined using several different solvent conditions. While the global fold of MII remains the same, the structure is stabilized in a more hydrophobic environment provided by the addition of acetonitrile or trifluoroethanol to the aqueous solution. The distribution of amino acid side chains in MII creates distinct hydrophobic and polar patches on its surface that may be important for the specific interaction with the alpha3beta2 neuronal nAChR. A comparison of the structure of MII with other neuronal-specific alpha-conotoxins provides insights into their mode of interaction with these receptors.", 
    "45": "Sudden profound hypotensive and/or bradycardic events (HBE) have been reported in >20% of patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy in the sitting position under interscalene block anesthesia. Retrospective studies suggest that the administration of beta-blockers is safe and may decrease the incidence of these episodes. We performed a randomized, prospective study to evaluate prophylaxis of these events. One hundred fifty patients were randomized to one of three groups (placebo; prophylactic metoprolol to achieve a heart rate <60 bpm or a maximal dose of 10 mg; or prophylactic glycopyrrolate to achieve a heart rate >100 bpm or a maximal dose of 6 microg/kg) immediately after the administration of the interscalene block. Blood pressure control was achieved with IV enalaprilat as needed. The incidence of HBE was 28% in the placebo group versus 5% in the metoprolol group (P = 0.004). The rate of 22% in the glycopyrrolate group was not significantly different from placebo. Preoperative heart rate and arterial blood pressure, intraoperative sedation score, IV fluids, and enalaprilat use were similar in those patients who had a HBE compared with those who did not. Many aspects of this clinical setting are similar to tilttable testing for patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope, in which beta-adrenergic blockade with metoprolol has also been shown to be effective. We conclude that the Bezold-Jarisch reflex is the most likely mechanism for these events.", 
    "46": "Episodes of acute hypotension and bradycardia occur during shoulder arthroscopy in the sitting position under interscalene block. In this study, we demonstrate that metoprolol, but not glycopyrrolate, markedly decreases the incidence of these episodes when given prophylactically immediately after the administration of the block.", 
    "47": "Two hypotheses were investigated: (1) helical computed tomography (CT) of the chest on victims of decelerating trauma can yield a diagnosis of, or \"rule out,\" a traumatic rupture of the aorta (TRA) without the need for an aortogram; and (2) selective delay of aortic repair can be safely accomplished through a medical management protocol. Screening helical CT examinations were done on 6169 victims of blunt thoracic trauma; 47 were found to have TRA; in 8, indirect but nondiagnostic findings not clarified by an aortogram led to surgical exploration. The sensitivity of helical CT was higher than that of aortograms, and a \"normal\" helical CT scan was never associated with a proved TRA. It is estimated that the use of helical CT has resulted in at least a 40% to 50% decrease in the need for aortograms, in addition to yielding rapid, noninvasive valuable information about other injuries. Drugs (beta-blockers +/- vasodilators) to decrease the stress in the aortic wall were used in 93 patients when the diagnosis was suspected and were continued as necessary through the evaluation, stabilization, and until the aorta was cross-clamped at operation. Elective, delayed operation was done between 2 days and 25 months in 15 patients who were deemed to be excessive risks for emergency aortic repair; there were 2 deaths (13. 3%). Eleven patients never had aortic repair. No patient maintained on this protocol, whether repaired emergently, electively, or not at all, developed free rupture of the periaortic hematoma and death from TRA.",

The analytical methods for the determination of both drugs used the same reversed-phase HPLC column, mobile phase and extraction procedure. Linearity was obtained in the ranges 15.63-1000 and 25-800 ng/ml for celiprolol and oxprenolol, respectively. Intra-day and inter-day variation was lower than 14%. After validation of the methods, analytical error functions were established as S.D. (ng/ml)=3.096+0.041C for celiprolol and S.D. (ng/ml)=8.906+8.075x10(-8)C3 for oxprenolol.", 
    "49": "The opossum kidney (OK) cell line has been shown previously to express endogenous 5-HT1B receptors which negatively couple to adenylate cyclase. Since other Gi-linked receptors have been shown to inhibit adenylate cyclase and to elevate intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i), studies were initiated to determine whether native opossum 5-HT1B receptors could also display dual coupling to these signal transduction mechanisms. Saturation studies using [125I](-)-iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) to radiolabel the 5-HT1B receptor in OK cell membranes (in the presence of 3 microM (-)-isoproterenol to mask beta-adrenergic receptors) yielded an equilibrium dissociation constant (pKd) of 10.04 and binding site density (Bmax) of 55 fmol/mg protein. Exposure of intact OK cells to 5-HT, CP 93,129, a selective rodent 5-HT1B receptor agonist, and (+/-)-cyanopindolol, a mixed 5-HT1A/1B receptor agonist/antagonist, produced concentration-dependent inhibitions of forskolin (3 MM)-stimulated cAMP accumulation (FSCA; Emax=90-95%) and elevations of [Ca2+]i (Emax approximately 200 nM increase above basal levels). Agonist potencies (pEC50) ranged from 9.7 to 8.1 and were comparable between the two second messenger assays, although slightly higher agonist potencies (approximately three-fold) were observed in the cAMP assay. GR 127,935, a selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist, behaved as a strong partial agonist in both the cAMP and calcium assays, with an intrinsic activity of 0.7 relative to 5-HT. Methiothepin, a nonselective 5-HT receptor antagonist, competitively antagonized the inhibitory cAMP response elicited by CP 93,129, yielding an apparent pKb value of 7.3. Methiothepin (10 microM) completely antagonized the stimulatory calcium response evoked by a saturating concentration of CP 93,129 (100 nM). Pertussis toxin pretreatment blocked the CP 93,129-induced inhibition of FSCA and elevation of [Ca2+]i in OK cells, indicating the involvement of Gi/o proteins in transducing these second messenger responses. The agonist properties of (+/-)-cyanopindolol and GR 127,935 observed in both second messenger assays suggests that a large degree of receptor reserve may be present, even though 5-HT1B receptor expression is low in OK cells. The OK cell line continues to serve as a model system to investigate 5-HT1B receptor-mediated signaling events.", 
    "50": "In the present study, we measured acetylcholine (ACh) released from rabbit detrusor smooth muscle strips induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS) using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with microdialysis procedure. There were frequency- and duration-dependent increases in contractile response and ACh release. There was a significant, but not simple correlation between EFS-induced contraction and ACh release. Atropine caused a decrease and increase in the contractile response and ACh release, respectively. Pretreatment with propranolol increased ACh release, but pretreatment with phentolamine had no significant effect. These results demonstrate that this method is applicable to direct measurement of ACh release by EFS, and that neurotransmitters other than ACh may relate to EFS-induced contraction. In addition, it is suggested that there are prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors and beta-adrenoceptors, which contribute to ACh release induced by EFS in the rabbit detrusor smooth muscles.", 
    "51": "This study used [3H]CGP 12177 as a radioligand to determine the beta1 and beta2-adrenoceptor changes from the pre-hatching E17 stage, where the beta2 subtype is first detected, to the post-hatching P30 stage. While beta1-adrenoceptors were found to be present from E18 and were limited to cerebellum and hyperstriatum in all stages studied, beta2-adrenoceptors showed a wider distribution throughout the brain. In most of the structures analysed both beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor binding values reached a maximum in the P2 stage, followed by a decrease over the following days. A second increase in both subtypes was detected again in the P15 and P30 stages. These results support the notion of a specific role for beta-adrenoceptors in neural plasticity in the first week after hatching and suggest that the beta2 subtype is the main adrenoceptor in chick brain throughout its development.", 
    "52": "Depriving heart tissue of their blood supply leads to a decrease in high-energy compounds and many metabolic disturbances. Following short periods of ischemia, heart can recover their physiological functions after reperfusion, but prolonged ischemia injures heart irreversibly. Mitochondrial disfunction is one of the most critical events associated to injury irreversibility because regeneration of a high ATP level is indispensable for recovery of cellular functions. Reperfusion injury is also implicated in the irreversible damage of the ischemic heart. Even after a period of ischemia that is too short to injure the heart, reperfusion can cause further irreversible damage. The formation of oxygen radicals caused by reintroduction of O2 is probably the most important factor of this phenomenon. The mitochondrial redox chain is one of the main sources of O2 radicals responsible for causing damage to mitochondria, and thus mitochondria can be damaged during reperfusion. Most probably the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore due to increased production of oxygen radicals is associated with the irreversible disruption of mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation. Carvedilol, a potent antioxidant, prevents the lipoperoxidation of mitochondrial membranes what suggest a strong contribution to the known cardioprotective activity of this compound through protection of mitochondrial functions.", 
    "53": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of formulation and processing changes on the dissolution and bioavailability of propranolol hydrochloride tablets. Directly compressed blends of 6 kg (20,000 units) were prepared by mixing in a 16-qt V blender and tablets were compressed on an instrumented Manesty D3B tablet press. A half-factorial (2(5-1), Resolution V) design was used to study the following variables: filler ratio (lactose/dicalcium phosphate), sodium starch glycolate level, magnesium stearate level, lubricant blend time, and compression force. The levels and ranges of the excipients and processing changes studied represented level 2 or greater changes as indicated by the Scale-up and Post Approval Changes (SUPAC-IR) Guidance. Changes in filler ratio, disintegrant level, and compression force were significant in affecting percent drug released (Q) in 5 min (Q5) and Q10. However, changes in magnesium stearate level and lubricant blend time did not influence Q5 and Q10. Hardness was found to be affected by changes in all of the variables studied. Some interaction effects between the variables studied were also found to be significant. To examine the impact of formulation and processing variables on in vivo absorption, three batches were selected for a bioavailability study based on their dissolution profiles. Thirteen subjects received four propranolol treatments (slow-, medium-, and fast-dissolving formulations and Inderal 80 mg) separated by 1 week washout according to a randomized crossover design. The formulations were found to be bioequivalent with respect to the log Cmax and log AUC0-infinity. The results of this study suggest that (i) bioavailability/bioequivalency studies may not be necessary for propranolol and perhaps other class 1 drugs after level 2 type changes, and (ii) in vitro dissolution tests may be used to show bioequivalence of propranolol formulations with processing or formulation changes within the specified level 2 ranges examined.", 
    "54": "The main objective of the study was to use the statistical response surface methodology to evaluate the effect of formulation variables and their interaction on drug release in atenolol gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) development coated with cellulose acetate (CA) pseudolatex system. A three-factor, three-level, face-centered design was employed to evaluate the quadratic response surface, and to achieve the desired response in atenolol delivery. Coating was achieved by spraying plasticized CA pseudolatex on atenolol bilayered tablets in a Uni-Glatt fluidized-bed coater. The independent variables were orifice size (X1), percent coating weight gain (X2) and Carbopol 934P (X3). The response variable (Y1) was time for 50% (t50%) drug dissolution with a constraint on cumulative percent released in 24 hr (Y2). The polynomial equation obtained was Y1 = 61.88 - 3779.8X1 + 1.89X2 - 3.95X3 - 266.87 X1X2 - 1675X1X3 + 0.07X2X3 + 215123X1(2) + 0.06X2(2) + 0.10X3(2). Contour and response plots were used to relate the independent and dependent variables. The optimization procedure predicted a t50% of 10.83 hr with 92% atenolol release in 24 hr when orifice size (X1), percent coating weight gain (X2), and Carbopol 934P (X3) were 0.014 in., 13%, and 20 mg, respectively.

    "55": "The effect of systemic application of carteolol, which induces almost the same plasma carteolol level as obtained by a long-term instillation on rabbit eyes, on the tissue blood flow in the optic nerve head (ONH) was investigated in rabbits. The plasma carteolol levels in 27 rabbits which received 3-week instillation, intravenous injection (10, 20, 30 micrograms/kg), or continuous intravenous injection (2.5, 5, 20, 40, 80 micrograms/kg/hr) were measured by gas chromatography-negative-ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. The plasma level with 3-week instillation was determined as 5.55 ng/ml and a continuous intravenous injection (5 micrograms/kg/hr) caused nearly the same plasma level. The intravenous injection of this dose significantly increased the ONH blood flow which was determined by the hydrogen clearance method, compared with controls from 30 minutes to 2 hours after the injection (n = 10). The vascular resistance in ONH was thought to be reduced because mean blood pressure and intraocular pressure (n = 6) were not significantly changed. The results suggest that the plasma carteolol level in rabbits after a long-term instillation can increase ONH blood flow due to a decreased vascular resistance.",

Enhanced blood pressure responses to either agonist were found in the transplant patients, but not when venous plasma concentrations were considered. Norepinephrine decreased heart rate and cardiac index in patients with hypertension receiving placebo and more markedly when receiving atenolol and nadolol. In contrast, heart transplant patients showed increases in heart rate, ejection fraction, and cardiac index, which largely were blocked (but not reversed into decreases) by atenolol and nadolol. In patients with hypertension receiving placebo, epinephrine increased heart rate, ejection fraction, and cardiac index. These responses were enhanced in transplant patients, also relative to plasma concentrations. Atenolol had only minor effects on these cardiac responses. On nadolol epinephrine decreased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac index in the patients with hypertension, whereas the transplant patients receiving nadolol showed no longer increases in cardiac function by epinephrine.",

Passive permeability was shown to be 20 x 10(-6) cm/sec for SDZ-RAD and 10 x 10(-6) cm/sec for rapamycin. In situ rat studies also showed the permeability of rapamycin to be half that of SDZ-RAD with permeabilities of 12.6 X 10(-6) for rapamycin and 24.8 x 10(-6) cm/sec for SDZ-RAD.",

    "64": "Large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have contributed to an increased recognition of the importance of systolic hypertension. Data from landmark epidemiologic studies such as the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial screenee follow-up and the Framingham Heart Study have demonstrated that elevated systolic blood pressure dramatically increases the risk of cardiovascular events. Of particular concern is the extremely high risk associated with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), which is much more common in the elderly than in young adults. Clinical trials have identified significant risk reductions after treatment with diuretics or the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nitrendipine in older individuals with ISH. Beta blockers have not been associated with such benefits. The recently released sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) recommends drug therapy for all patients with stage 1 (140 to 159 mm Hg) or stage 2-3 (> or = 160 mm Hg) systolic hypertension, whether it occurs in isolation or in conjunction with diastolic hypertension. The sixth JNC report identified diuretics as the initial therapy of choice, with a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker as an alternative if diuretics are ineffective or not well tolerated. More research is needed to evaluate other classes of drugs in this setting. Regardless of the choice of therapy, patients should be encouraged to adopt lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, exercise, sodium restriction, and reduced alcohol consumption.", 
    "65": "Ventricular remodeling following nonfatal myocardial infarction includes an excentric hypertrophy of the surviving myocardium, associated with hemodynamic overload. Disseminated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and phenotype changes of the surviving myocardium, such as a labile calcium homeostasis of the hypertrophied cardiomyocytes, impaired beta-adrenergic signal transduction, interstitial fibrosis, and reduced coronary reserve are typical features of the overloaded, distended ventricular wall. They are considered as relevant for the myocardial dysfunction progressing to overt cardiac failure and for the enhanced mortality risk. Hemodynamic load and trophic angiotensin effects are assumed to cause this excentric hypertrophy, since systemic and local angiotensin formation in the overloaded myocardium is activated. In isolated rat cardiomyocytes, cultured on distensible membranes, overload is mimicked by distension, and causes enhanced formation and release of angiotensin II, which results in AT1 receptor mediated trophic reactions of distended neonatal cardiomyocytes and in AT1-mediated apoptosis in distended adult cardiomyocytes. In experimental models of postinfarct remodeling, therapy with ACE inhibition or with AT1 blockade similarly normalizes myocardial hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and impaired coronary reserve. In patients with terminal heart failure, a reduction of apoptotic signs and a normalization of antiapoptotic gene expression is obtained by myocardial unloading under ventricular assist devices or by treatment with ACE inhibitors, and the latter therapy has been shown to improve survival. In contrast to general assumptions and to predictions from data in vitro, the improvements obtained by AT1 blocker therapy in vivo are mediated by bradykinin, as are those obtained under ACE inhibitors. Under AT1 blockade, bradykinin is probably activated due to stimulation of AT2 and other AT receptors.",

The underlying cardioprotective mechanism relies upon protection against the deleterious consequences of cardiac sympathetic stimulation. Heart rate reduction induced by beta-blocker treatment may importantly contribute to such benefit especially by improving myocardial energetic balance and by inducing a less negative force-frequency relationship. Results from clinical trials such as CIBIS suggest that prognosis in chronic heart failure may partly depend on left ventricular function improvement, but additional data are needed to more precisely define the relationships between heart rate reduction, left ventricular function improvement, and survival.", 
    "67": "Hypoglycemia, as produced by insulin administration, elicits counter-regulatory processes including sympathetic nervous system arousal. Humans report that these autonomic responses are salient cues in the recognition of hypoglycemia. The role of these autonomic responses in the recognition of the hypoglycemic state by rats was investigated in this experiment. Nine rats were trained to discriminate the normal state of euglycemia from the hypoglycemia produced by the injection of 2 units/kg insulin, which caused a reduction in blood glucose levels to 66-77% of baseline values. A 'drug discrimination' procedure was used with a food-motivated operant. After extensive training, reliable hypoglycemia discrimination was established, in that the mean percentage of total test-period responses on the 'hypoglycemia' lever was 78% after insulin treatment, compared to 16% after water injection. Tests were then conducted after the injection of epinephrine (and no insulin), and after the injection of insulin plus propranolol, with the intention of eliciting sympathetic activity during euglycemia, and blocking sympathetic responses during hypoglycemia. These manipulations failed to simulate or to block the hypoglycemia cue, with the insulin or non-insulin operant response choice being essentially unchanged. These results indicate that in rats beta-adrenergic sympathetic responses are not critical for the recognition of hypoglycemia. Appropriate discriminative responses were apparently made on the basis of the impairment by hypoglycemia of central nervous system (CNS) function ('neuroglycopenic' effects), although a role for cholinergic activity of the sympathetic nervous system cannot be ruled out.", 
    "68": "Rats implanted bilaterally with cannulae in the entorhinal or posterior parietal cortex or in the amygdaloid nucleus were trained in one-trial step-down inhibitory (passive) avoidance using a 0.3 mA footshock. At 0, 3, 6 or 9 h after training, they received localized 0.5 microliter infusions into these areas of a vehicle, or of 8-Br-cAMP, forskolin (adenylyl cyclase activator), KT5720 (protein kinase A inhibitor), SKF38393 (dopamine D1 receptor agonist), SCH23390 (D1 antagonist), norepinephrine hydrochloride, timolol hydrochloride (beta blocker), 8-HO-DPAT (5-HT1A receptor agonist) or NAN-190 (5-HT1A antagonist) dissolved in 20% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in saline (vehicle). Rats were tested for retention 24 h after training. 8-Br-cAMP, forskolin, SKF 38393 and norepinephrine caused memory facilitation and KT5720, SCH23390, timolol and 8-HO-DPAT caused retrograde amnesia when given into the entorhinal cortex 0, 3 or 6 h but not 9 h after training. When given into the posterior parietal cortex 0, 3 or 6 but not 9 h after training, KT5720 was amnestic. When given into this structure 3 or 6 h but not 0 or 9 h after training 8-Br-cAMP, forskolin and norepinephrine caused memory facilitation and KT5720, SCH23390 and timolol caused retrograde amnesia. All treatments given into the amygdala 0, 3 or 6 h after training were ineffective except for norepinephrine given at 0 h, which caused facilitation. The data point to a role of cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent mechanisms in memory formation in the entorhinal and parietal cortex, but not the amygdala, from 0 to 6 h after training, and to a strong modulation of these mechanisms by dopaminergic D1, beta-noradrenergic and 5-HT1A receptors. The lack of effect of NAN-190 but not 8-HO-DPAT in both cortical regions suggests that 5-HT1A receptors do not play a physiological role but can be activated pharmacologically. The fact that SCH23390 was amnestic but SKF38393 had no effect when given into the parietal cortex suggests that D1 receptors may play a maintenance rather than a stimulant role in this area.", 
    "69": "Electrical field stimulation of ovine trachealis muscle produced neurogenic atropine-sensitive contractions under resting conditions. However, when the tissues were precontracted with 5-hydroxytryptamine in the presence of atropine, electrical field stimulation induced a frequency-dependent tetrodotoxin-sensitive relaxation. The relaxation was biphasic, consisting of fast and slow phases. The fast component was attenuated by propranolol, indicating an action on beta-adrenoceptors. The slow phase was attenuated by capsaicin and, therefore, involved release of a peptide. These results showed that excitatory responses in ovine trachealis muscles are cholinergically mediated, while both adrenergic and peptidergic components mediate electrically induced relaxation in the trachea. We also examined the influence of lowering bath temperature to 20 degrees C on electrically evoked responses. These were significantly reduced by cooling. At 20 degrees C, under resting conditions, the time-to-peak tension was lengthened, and the amplitude of the contractile responses was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced. In the same preparation, carbachol-induced contractions were not reduced by cooling, indicating that the reduction in electrically induced contractions was probably due to a reduction in transmitter release. Cooling also abolished the fast inhibitory phase (adrenergic in nature) without significantly inhibiting the slow (non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic) component. Propranolol (1 micromol/l) and capsaicin (100 micromol/l) did not affect significantly the slow relaxation observed during cooling. It was concluded that cooling inhibited cholinergically mediated, electrically induced contractions and selectively abolished the adrenergic component of electrically induced relaxant responses.", 
    "70": "The actions of different adrenoceptor antagonists on gastric potential difference (PD), electrical current (I) and resistance (R) were studied, using the voltage clamp technique. In an isolated gastric mucosal tissue, 5% ethanol was able to reduce the PD and I across the gastric mucosa. Direct incubation with propranolol 10(-4) mol/l either from the mucosal or submucosal sides attenuated such effects. Intraperitoneal administration of propranolol (2.5-10 mg/kg), a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker with significant membrane-stabilizing activity, given 30 min before the preparation of the gastric tissue, not only alleviated the fall in PD and I across the gastric mucosa, but also increased the R of the stomach tissue. Butoxamine, a selective beta2-antagonist, produced the similar but less significant effects in the same experimental setting. Metroprolol, a beta1-adrenoceptor blocker, given by the similar doses did not produce significant effects. Nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker, nadolol but not the beta- and alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, labetalol, also significantly preserved the decrease of PD induced by ethanol, but to a lesser extent. These findings suggest that blockade of the beta2-receptors in the gastric mucosa together with membrane-stabilizing activity could improve the integrity of the gastric mucosa, and these effects are probably acting through its direct action on the tissue.", 
    "71": "Cyclic AMP production in the presence or absence of various adrenergic agonists and antagonists was determined in cultured human trabecular cells using a gammaflow automated radioimmunoassay that allowed multiple simultaneous experiments and reproducible results. Adrenergic agonists and antagonists showed activation and inhibition constants consistent with the presence of beta2-receptors: Ka of isoproterenol < epinephrine < norepinephrine < phenylephrine; Ki of timolol < betaxolol < celiprolol < atenolol. Selective ICI antagonists showed beta2-specificity.", 
    "72": "This study examined the influence of benzodiazepine receptors on amylase release from rat parotid acinar cells. Diazepam (10(-8)-10(-6) M), which is a potent agonist of both central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, dose dependently decreased amylase release induced by isoprenaline and carbachol, which are beta-adrenoceptor and muscarinic receptor agonists, respectively. The maximum inhibitory response was obtained with 10(-6) M diazepam: amylase release was decreased to 57% (isoprenaline) and 39% (carbachol) of maximal levels, while these responses were completely inhibited by propranolol and atropine, respectively. Clonazepam and 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-p-chlorophenyl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2- one (Ro 5-4864), which are selective agonists of central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, respectively, also produced a significant and dose-dependent decrease in isoprenaline-induced amylase release. The inhibitory potency was diazepam > clonazepam > Ro 5-4864. Flumazenil and 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK 11195), which are selective antagonists of central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, respectively, dose dependently blocked the inhibition of isoprenaline-induced amylase release by diazepam. At a concentration of 10(-5) M, flumazenil and PK 11195 restored amylase release to approximately 75% of that in the presence of isoprenaline alone. The combination of both antagonists completely prevented the inhibition by diazepam. Similarly, the inhibitory responses of clonazepam and Ro 5-4864 were completely blocked by flumazenil and PK 11195, respectively. These results suggest that, in rat parotid acinar cells, benzodiazepines inhibit beta-adrenoceptor and muscarinic receptor-stimulated amylase release and that both central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors contribute to this inhibitory regulation.", 
    "73": "The effects of a serotonin (5-HT) releasing drug, p-chloroamphetamine, on plasma glucose levels were investigated in rats. p-Chloroamphetamine elicited a significant hyperglycemia. The hyperglycemic effects of p-chloroamphetamine were completely prevented by the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor, p-chlorophenylalanine. Prior adrenodemedullation abolished the hyperglycemia elicited by p-chloroamphetamine. p-Chloroamphetamine-induced hyperglycemia was prevented by methysergide, which blocks the 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor, the 5-HT1A/1B/2C receptor antagonist, (-)-propranolol, the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, 4-(2'-methoxyphenyl-1-[2'-n-2\"pyridinyl)-p-iodobenzamido]-ethyl-pi perazine (p-MPPI), the 5-HT2A/2B/2C receptor antagonists, ritanserin and 4-isopropyl-7-methyl-9-(2-hydroxy-1-methyl-propoxycarbonyl)-4,6A,7 ,8,9,10,10A-octahydro-indolo[4,3-FG]quinolone maleate(LY 53857). However, the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, tropisetron, the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, 2-methoxy-4-amino-5-chloro-benzoic acid 2-(diethylamino) ethyl ester (SDZ 205-557), and the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, ketanserin, did not affect the p-chloroamphetamine-induced hyperglycemia. These results suggest that p-chloroamphetamine-induced hyperglycemia is elicited by an enhanced 5-HT release and facilitated adrenaline release. Moreover, our results indicate that p-chloroamphetamine-induced hyperglycemia is mediated by 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B/2C receptors.", 
    "74": "Patterns of antihypertensive drug use, the cost of this care and potential savings with changes of treatment patterns, were studied for all hypertensives treated at US Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities for fiscal years 1995 and 1996. Data was aggregated by individual medication as well as by antihypertensive drug class. Cost estimates were based on median cost and number of units for each dosage form of each medication dispensed at all facilities. Potential savings were estimated by substituting beta-blockers or diuretics for calcium antagonists. In a subset of patients the prevalence of hypertension, and among hypertensives the prevalence of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus, was determined. For these patients, patterns of treatment by antihypertensive drug class was examined. For all VA facilities, of the 10 most frequently prescribed antihypertensives in 1995, four were calcium antagonists, two angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, two beta-blockers, and two diuretics. In 1996, this was changed by the addition of an ACE inhibitor and the subtraction of a diuretic combination. Calcium antagonists accounted for 37% of treatment days in 1995 and 35% in 1996, ACE inhibitor use went from 34% to 36%, beta-blockers from 17% to 18%, and diuretic use remained at 12%. In 1996, approximately 86.6 million dollars were spent on calcium antagonists, 51.8 million on ACE inhibitors, 7.9 million on beta-blockers, and 3.6 million on diuretics. The estimated annual cost savings for each 1% conversion of calcium antagonists to beta-blockers would be $713,000 and to diuretics $758,000. In a subset of 7526 hypertensive patients with known comorbid conditions, calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors were also the most commonly used drug classes for all categories of patients, including those without coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors were the most commonly dispensed antihypertensives at VA facilities for both 1995 and 1996, with a small decrease in calcium antagonist use from 1995 to 1996. The cost implications of these practice patterns as compared with the primary use of diuretics and beta-blockers are enormous.", 
    "75": "1. Arginine-vasopressin (VP) has both vasoconstricting and vasodilating action. We report here the discovery of four novel selective hypotensive VP analogues: d(CH2)5[D-Tyr(Et)2,Arg3,Val4]AVP; d(CH2)5[D-Tyr(Et)2,Lys3,Val4]AVP and their iodinatable Tyr-NH2(9) analogues. 2. Bioassays in rats for activities characteristic of neurohypophysial peptides showed that the four VP peptides possessed little or no V1a, V2 or oxytocin (OT) receptor agonistic or antagonistic activities. 3. In anaesthetized rats, these peptides (0.05-0.10 mg kg(-1) i.v.) elicited a marked fall in arterial blood pressure. 4. Blockade of cholinoceptors, adrenoceptors and bradykinin B2 receptors, and inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis had little effect on their vasodepressor action. 5. Classical V1a, V2 and OT receptor antagonists did not block the vasodepressor response. 6. L-NAME, 0.2 mg kg(-1) min(-1), markedly suppressed the hypotensive response to ACh but not the vasodepressor response to the hypotensive VP peptides. However, the duration of the vasodepressor response was shortened. Very high doses of L-NAME attenuated both the vasodepressor response and the duration of action. 7. These findings indicate that the vasodepressor action of these VP peptides is independent of the peripheral autonomic, bradykinin and PG systems and is not mediated by the known classical OT/VP receptors. NO does not appear to have an important role in their vasodepressor action. 8. The discovery of these novel VP peptides could lead to the development of new tools for the investigation of the complex cardiovascular actions of VP and the introduction of a new class of hypotensive agents. The two iodinatable hypotensive VP peptides could be radiolabelled as potential markers for the localization of the receptor system involved.", 
    "76": "1. The beta2-agonist salmeterol is a potent relaxant of airway smooth muscle with a long duration of action. Previous studies of cyclic AMP accumulation, however, have indicated that salmeterol is a low efficacy beta2-agonist when compared to isoprenaline. Here we have compared the properties of salmeterol and isoprenaline as stimulants of gene transcription in CHO-K1 cells transfected with the human beta2-adrenoceptor to different levels (50 and 310 fmol mg protein(-1)). 2. Gene transcription was monitored using a secreted placental alkaline phosphate (SPAP) reporter gene under the transcriptional control of six cyclic AMP response element (CRE) sequences. 3. In the lower expressing cells (CHO-beta2/6), salmeterol produced a maximal cyclic AMP response that was only 22% that of that obtained with isoprenaline. In contrast in the higher expressing cells (CHO-beta2/ 4), the two maxima were of similar magnitude. 4. Salmeterol was a more potent stimulant of gene transcription, producing the same maximal response as isoprenaline in both cell lines. Furthermore, in the CHO-beta2/4 cells, Salmeterol was 50 fold more potent as a stimulant of SPAP secretion than of cyclic AMP accumulation. In contrast, isoprenaline was 24 fold less sensitive as a stimulant of SPAP secretion than of cyclic AMP accumulation. In the presence of serum (10%), the effects of both salmeterol and isoprenaline on gene transcription were augmented. 5. These data suggest that the low efficacy and/or long duration of action of salmeterol, favours a potent stimulation of gene transcription when compared to more efficacious but shorter-lived agonists such as isoprenaline.", 
    "77": "The effects of the 5-HT1A/1B/1D/5/7 receptor agonist, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), on blood glucose, insulin and glucagon levels in rats were investigated. 5-CT above the dosage of 0.05 mg/kg elicited significant hyperglycemic effects and 0.1 mg/kg, induced a 35% increase in plasma glucose levels. 5-CT did not affect plasma glucagon, and serum insulin levels increased following the high dose of 5-CT. Adrenodemedullation abolished the 5-CT-induced hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia induced by 5-CT was prevented by pretreatment with the 5-HT1/2/7 receptor antagonist, metergoline, and the 5-HT1/2/5/7 receptor antagonist, methysergide, although the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, ketanserin, the 5-HT2A/2B/2C receptor antagonist, ritanserin, and the 5-HT3/4 receptor antagonist, tropisetron, had no effect. Although 5-CT has a high affinity with 5-HT1A receptors, the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B and beta receptor antagonist, (-)-popranolol, did not affect 5-CT-induced hyperglycemia. These results indicate that 5-CT-induced hyperglycemia is elicited by facilitation of adrenaline release from the adrenal gland and that 5-CT-induced hyperglycemia is mediated by the 5-HT7 receptor unrelated to 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4 or 5-HT5 receptors.", 
    "78": "1. Frequency-domain spectral analysis of stationary ECG R-R intervals was made by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) in conditions of monitored arterial blood pressure and respiratory activity in diethyl-ether-anaesthetized and pithed adult rats. This technique yields a number of parameters which allow quantitative evaluation of the non-random distribution of the mean values obtained in time-domain studies. The frequency-analysis method enables the overall heart rate variability to be broken down into its various constituents, which are differently affected by physiological loading and capable of selective reactivity to pharmacological agents. 2. The low-frequency spectral component obtained by breaking down the total spectral density power, i.e. the appropriate variability signal (band width < 0.15 Hz) and a higher-frequency band corresponding to spontaneous (0.80-1.60 Hz) or artificially imposed (0.75 Hz) respiratory activity were estimated and their integrated areas evaluated as absolute powers or normalized fractional values. 3. The power of the high-frequency spectral component increased in all animal preparations under treatment with prazosin, dl-propranolol, endothelin-1 and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril, lisinopril, quinapril and ramipril. The power of the low-frequency band increased under alpha-r atriopeptin and ACE inhibitors in the pithed preparations only, and decreased in the anaesthetized animals. 4. The new power spectrum features and trends detected indicate that these time-independent, model-dependent cardiovascular and respiratory markers are subject to some form of complex peptidergic control. 5. The relative roles of the various factors operating in the genesis of these short-term changes in spectral power in the low- and high-frequency bands cannot be interpreted as indicating a reciprocal push-pull relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic control. 6. The study findings, however, can be interpreted as providing evidence of a different and to some extent alternative form of integrative cardiovascular control persisting in the pithed rats (i.e. in the 'peripheral', CNS-destroyed preparations). 7. New areas of theoretical and applied research are being developed in the (auto)classification of (iso)receptors and drug analogues through exploration of multiple physiological and pharmacokinetic parameters in the frequency-domain. Furthermore, model-independent frequency-domain methods not requiring stationary data will afford scope for even more significant developments by separating the overlapping dynamic processes from a whole series of correlated effects.", 
    "79": "1. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that the offset of action of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on the heart is related to their lipophilicity, with low and highly lipophilic drugs having a rapid and slow offset, respectively. The effects of beta-blockers with low (atenolol), moderate (celiprolol), high (propranolol) and very high (bopindolol) lipophilicity on the contractile responses of the rat right ventricle to isoprenaline were determined. 2. Atenolol at 10(-6) and 10(-5) M, celiprolol at 10(-7), 10(-6) and 10(-5) M, propranolol at 10(-8), 10(-7) and 10(-6) M and bopindolol at 2 x 10(-9) and 10(-8) M caused parallel rightward shifts of the isoprenaline response curves with no effect on maximum responses. The Schild plots for atenolol, celiprolol and propranolol had slopes that were not significantly different from 1, which is indicative of competitive reversible antagonism. The pKB values were 7.33, 7.78, and 8.79 for atenolol, celiprolol, and propranolol, respectively. The Schild plot for bopindolol had a slope that was significantly greater than 1. 3. Our hypothesis is supported as the effects of propranolol and bopindolol were more slowly offset than those of atenolol and celiprolol. Thus, the concentration-ratio of 141 in the presence of atenolol at 10(-5) M was reduced to 4 after the first wash, whereas the ratio of 100 in the presence of propranolol at 10(-7) M was only reduced to 45 after a similar wash. The ratio of 54 with celiprolol at 10(-6) M was reduced to 5, whereas the ratio of 70 with bopindolol at 10(-8) M was only reduced to 28 by the first wash. 4. The effects of bopindolol were very slowly or not reversible over two washes in the absence or presence of atenolol at 10(-6) M. It is suggested that bopindolol is a very slowly reversible beta-blocker, and that this contributes to its slow offset of action.",

    "88": "An indirect lighting protocol was developed to measure nocturnal melatonin suppression by light in normal human subjects. Goals were to minimize both discomfort due to staring intensely at a bright light source, and behavioral variation due to wandering gaze. Subjects sat with a bank of five full-spectrum light sources placed behind them. Lights reflecting off the surfaces before each subject produced a hemisphere of light that measured 500 lx +/- 5%. Subjects retired to bed in darkness by midnight and then sat in the hemisphere of light from 02.00 h to 04.00 h. Blood for melatonin was drawn at 20-30-min intervals from midnight to 06.00 h. Plasma melatonin was measured by radioimmunoassay. The indirect lighting protocol was used to compare the effects of 500 lx light to dark (21 subjects) and to study varying light intensities from 300 to 2000 lx (7 subjects). We studied the effects of the sitting posture in very dim light of 20-30 lx (6 subjects). We also studied the effects of propranolol plus dark and propranolol plus 500 lx light on melatonin levels. Subjects received placebo, 10 mg propranolol or 40 mg propranolol orally at 23.00 h, and were then exposed to either the dark or light condition. Melatonin levels obtained with the indirect lighting protocol were consistent with studies using direct lighting; light of 500 lx significantly suppressed nocturnal melatonin and suppression was dose related between 300 and 2000 lx. Sitting in dim light had no significant effect on melatonin suppression when compared with the supine posture in the dark in six subjects. Propranolol caused a dose-dependent decrease in melatonin levels in both the dark and the light. There was no relationship between suppression of melatonin by propranolol and suppression by light.", 
    "89": "Antiarrhythmic drugs are known to affect the depolarization and repolarization time in a different fashion. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of Sotalol, Flecainide and Propafenone on some common (QT, QTc, JT, JTc) or uncommon (QTc dispersion, T-peak to T-end interval) electrocardiographic parameters in order to evaluate the effects of these antiarrhythmic drugs on ventricular repolarization time both in terms of absolute values and of dispersion across the myocardium. The analysis of these antiarrhythmic drug effects was performed on the standard 12-lead electrocardiograms of 31 patients (17F and 14M, age 38.1+/-17 years, range 11-67 years) in the free-drug state and at the steady state after oral treatment with Sotalol (160 mg daily), Flecainide (200 mg daily) and Propafenone (450 mg daily). These drugs were prescribed, separately, to all the 31 patients, free of underlying structural heart disease, for the treatment of their atrio-ventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia. Data of the present study show that Sotalol, over the range prescribed, significantly prolongs ventricular repolarization index QT (P=0.001), JT (P=0.0001) and JTc (P=0.0001) values in an homogeneous fashion, as shown by the significant decrease in QTcD (P=0.019) and Tp-Te (P=0.01).

Seventy percent of patients were treated pharmacologically. Calcium channel blockers were the most common agents (26%), followed by diuretics (25%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (22%), and beta-blockers (8%). The relative use of these drugs changed according to the presence of other cardiovascular conditions. Adjusting for potential confounders, the relative odds of receiving antihypertensive therapy were significantly decreased for the oldest subjects (> or =85 years old: odds ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.89) and those with marked impairment of physical (odds ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-0.81) and cognitive (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.70) function.",

    "100": "This study sought to determine the relationship between perceived and actual use of intravenous beta-blockers by cardiologists and emergency physicians for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The charts of 35 patients who presented to the emergency department of a community hospital with AMI during a 6-month period were retrospectively reviewed. Members of the departments of cardiology and emergency medicine were mailed a one-page survey pertaining to their use of intravenous beta-blockers in AMI. Of the 35 patients only 4 (11%) received an intravenous beta-blocker. Three of these 4 patients were either hypertensive or tachycardic and none had a contraindication to beta-blockade. A contraindication was present in 15 (48%) of those who did not get intravenous beta-blockade. The survey was completed by 11 (100%) of the emergency physicians and 68 (69%) of the cardiologists. Emergency physicians were significantly less likely to report using intravenous beta-blockers in AMI patients who were normotensive with normal heart rates (P=.007) and most (9 of 11) deferred the decision to the cardiologist. Although the majority of cardiologists reported giving an intravenous beta-blocker to at least 50% of AMI patients with normal blood pressure and pulse rates, the actual frequency was only 8% (1 of 13). In this institution, cardiologists overestimated the frequency of intravenous beta-blocker administration to patients with AMI. Emergency physicians usually deferred the decision on intravenous beta-blockers to cardiologists and reported a frequency of use that was much closer to actual practice.", 
    "101": "BACKGROUND-MATERIALS: Dopamine is known to induce hyperglycemia in both animals and man, but the precise mechanism by which this occurs has not yet been fully clarified. We investigated whether dopamine has any direct effect on glucose release from hepatocytes through the glycogenolytic and/or gluconeogenic pathways, and at the same time determined the main type of adrenergic receptor involved in glucose release, using primary cultured rat hepatocytes. METHODS-RESULTS-CONCLUSIONS: Glycogen-rich and glycogen-depleted hepatocytes were prepared in order to study glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic glucose release, respectively. After exchanging the culture medium for Hanks-HEPES buffer containing no glucose (but with fructose for the glycogen-depleted hepatocytes), dopamine was added to these two groups of hepatocytes at final concentrations of 0, 10(-7), 10(-6), 10(-5), and 10(-4) M. The amount of glucose released from the hepatocytes 30 minutes after adding dopamine at concentrations of 10(-5) and 10(-4) M were significantly higher than those obtained at dopamine concentrations of 0, 10(-7) and 10(-6) M. Tne increase in glucose release at the dopamine concentration of 10(-5) M was inhibited by 10(-5) M propranolol, but not by 10(-5) M phentolamine. Our findings suggest that dopamine has a direct effect on hepatocytes, increasing glucose release via both the glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic pathways and mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "102": "The relation between high current atrial stimulation and antiarrhythmic drugs was not clear. We evaluated the effects of procainamide and dl-sotalol on the electrophysiological changes induced by high current stimulation. Effects of high current atrial stimulation on effective refractory period, dispersion of refractoriness, conduction velocity, and wavelength of the earliest atrial premature beat were evaluated at baseline and after infusion of procainamide (10 patients) and dl-sotalol (10 patients). High current atrial stimulation shortened effective refractory period locally (-12% +/- 4.0%, -7.0% +/- 3.0%, -5.1 +/- 3.3%, and -3.0 +/- 2.0%, at 0, 7, 14, and 21 mm from the S1 stimulation site, respectively; P < 0.001); increased the dispersion of refractoriness (from 17.8 +/- 8.5 to 27.4 +/- 12.5 ms, P < 0.001); decreased conduction velocity of the earliest premature beat (from 0.58 +/- 0.10 to 0.52 +/- 0.09 ms, P = 0.01); and decreased wavelength of the earliest atrial premature beat (from 10.9 +/- 2.4 to 8.8 +/- 2.1 cm, P < 0.001). These effects of high current stimulation persisted after procainamide infusion. However, after dl-sotalol infusion, high current atrial stimuli did not change the dispersion of refractoriness (23.1 +/- 10 ms vs 26.4 +/- 10.4 ms; P > 0.05, twice diastolic threshold vs 10 mA); conduction velocity of the earliest premature beat (0.54 +/- 0.06 ms vs 0.50 +/- 0.06 ms, P > 0.05); or wavelength of the earliest premature atrial beat (11.5 +/- 1.6 m/s vs 10.1 +/- 1.7 cm; P > 0.05). Although high current atrial stimulation shortened effective refractory period locally, increased dispersion of refractoriness, and decreased the wavelength of the earliest premature atrial impulse, these effects were abolished by dl-sotalol but not procainamide.", 
    "103": "This study examines the cellular basis for the phenotypic appearance of broad-based T waves, increased transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR), and torsade de pointes (TdP) induced by beta-adrenergic agonists under conditions mimicking the LQT1 form of the congenital long-QT syndrome.", 
    "104": "A transmural ECG and transmembrane action potentials from epicardial, M, and endocardial cells were recorded simultaneously from an arterially perfused wedge of canine left ventricle. Chromanol 293B, a specific IKs blocker, dose-dependently (1 to 100 micromol/L) prolonged the QT interval and action potential duration (APD90) of the 3 cell types but did not widen the T wave, increase TDR, or induce TdP. Isoproterenol 10 to 100 nmol/L in the continued presence of chromanol 293B 30 micromol/L abbreviated the APD90 of epicardial and endocardial cells but not that of the M cell, resulting in widening of the T wave and a dramatic accentuation of TDR. Spontaneous as well as programmed electrical stimulation (PES)-induced TdP was observed only after exposure to the IKs blocker and isoproterenol. Therapeutic concentrations of propranolol (0.5 to 1 micromol/L) prevented the actions of isoproterenol to increase TDR and to induce TdP. Mexiletine 2 to 20 micromol/L abbreviated the APD90 of M cells more than that of epicardial and endocardial cells, thus diminishing TDR and the effect of isoproterenol to induce TdP.", 
    "105": "This experimental model of LQT1 indicates that a deficiency of IKs alone does not induce TdP but that the addition of beta-adrenergic influence predisposes the myocardium to the development of TdP by increasing transmural dispersion of repolarization, most likely as a result of a large augmentation of residual IKs in epicardial and endocardial cells but not in M cells, in which IKs is intrinsically weak. Our data provide a mechanistic understanding of the cellular basis for the therapeutic actions of beta-adrenergic blockers in LQT1 and suggest that sodium channel block with class IB antiarrhythmic agents may be effective in suppressing TdP in LQT1, as they are in LQT2 and LQT3, as well as in acquired (drug-induced) forms of the long-QT syndrome.", 
    "106": "Previous studies have shown that an intravenous infusion of dextran sulfate (DXS) causes arterial hypotension via release of bradykinin (BK) and stimulation of bradykinin B2 receptors in pigs. The bradykinin B1 receptor is not physiologically present but its expression can be induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This study was designed to assess the relative roles of bradykinin B2 and B1 receptors in the hypotensive response produced by DXS in LPS-treated pigs. In LPS-treated pigs a continuous infusion of DXS produced a progressive drop in blood pressure that peaked at approximately 30 min after onset of the infusion and returned to baseline after another 30 min. In animals receiving the selective B2 receptor antagonist Hoe-140 a significant attenuation of the peak fall in blood pressure to DXS was observed. In pigs treated with Hoe-140 and the selective B1 receptor antagonist CP-0298 (Lys(0)-Leu(8)-des-Arg(9)-bradykinin) DXS infusion had no effect on blood pressure. This is the first demonstration in vivo that following activation of the contact system both B2 and B1 receptors are involved in the resulting hypotensive response. This would be consistent with the production of BK (which stimulates B2 receptors) that is subsequently converted to the biologically active metabolite des-Arg(9)-BK in sufficient concentrations to activate B 1 receptors. The significance of these observations to pathophysiology remains to be determined.", 
    "107": "Blood flow in salivary glands is regulated mainly by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity. This study was carried out to determine the relative contributions of cholinergic, adrenergic and peptidergic neurotransmitters to the control of submandibular blood flow in the rat using laser-Doppler flowmetry. Parasympathetic impulses caused a rapid atropine-sensitive vasodilation followed by a maintained increase in blood flow, a portion of which remained in the presence of both atropine and L-NAME. In contrast, continuous sympathetic stimulation caused an intense vasoconstriction that was followed by a prolonged after-vasodilation. The same number of impulses delivered in bursts resulted in a cyclic vasoconstriction followed by a rapid vasodilation. Alpha-adrenoceptor blockade largely abolished the vasoconstriction, and the duration and magnitude of the after-vasodilation were reduced. Inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthase by L-NAME reduced the vasodilation. The addition of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist eliminated the sympathetic vasodilator response, but in the presence of complete alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade and L-NAME a small vasoconstriction remained. We conclude that the vasoconstrictor effects of sympathetic stimulation of the rat submandibular gland are due to alpha-adrenergic receptor activation and probably also NPY, and the vasodilator effects are due to NO and beta-adrenergic activity. Parasympathetic vasodilation was due to NO-independent mechanisms mediated by acetylcholine and substance P, and NO-dependent mechanisms mediated by VIP.", 
    "108": "Ion transport properties of the human submandibular gland cell line A253 were investigated by X-ray microanalysis. The cells were grown on ultrathin plastic films on titanium grids. After the experiment, where the cells were exposed to various agonists and inhibitors, the specimens were briefly rinsed in distilled water, frozen, and freeze-dried. The elemental composition of the cultured cells most closely resembled that of striated duct cells. Beta-adrenergic stimulation caused a small decrease in the cellular Cl- and K+ concentration, but cholinergic stimulation had no effect. Also stimulation with cAMP caused a decrease in Cl- and K+; this decrease could be inhibited by the chloride channel blocker NPPB. Loss of Cl- and K+ could also be elicited by exposure to a hypotonic solution. The results suggest that there may be several types of chloride channel present in A253 cells.",

The objective of the treatment is not only the relief of the symptoms, but also prevention of the onset and progression of the disease. The emphasis of treatment aims to moderate the increased neuroendocrine activity and thus to prevent myocardial damage. This review summarizes our knowledge concerning the treatment of chronic heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction. It is based on former American guidelines and especially on the guideline of the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology. The treatment of systolic and diastolic dysfunction of left ventricle are separately discussed. Emphasis is laid on the non pharmacologic treatment of heart failure. The treatment with ACE-inhibitors, diuretics, betablockers, digitalis, calcium antagonists and other drugs as well as the invasive procedures are also discussed.",

    "118": "Changes in the RR interval within episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) have not been fully characterized. A database of 177 24-hour Holter recordings were created from patients with PAF in the CRAFT studies. PAF episodes of > or = 1 minute duration containing < or = 20% noise and preceded by > or = 1 minute of sinus rhythm with < or = 20% noise were selected. Sections of each AF episode containing 10 and 25 RR intervals were identified at the onset, middle, and termination of each episode. Descriptive characteristics (mean, SD, and RMSSD of RR intervals) were calculated within each section, and compared using a nonparametric, paired Wilcoxon test. In 25 patients (17 men, 60.6 +/- 12.2 years old), 231 episodes from 44 recordings met the selection criteria. The mean RR interval increased slightly between the onset and mid-portion of AF episodes (565.9 +/- 128.3 vs 580.3 +/- 144.7 ms, P < 0.001). The RR interval at the termination of AF was significantly greater than that at the start (627.1 +/- 156.1 vs 565.9 ms, P < 10-11) or mid-portion (627.1 +/- 156.1 vs 580.3 +/- 144.7 ms, P < 10-13). SD of the RR interval increased significantly between onset and mid-portion (111.1 +/- 60.2 vs 118.2 +/- 66.7 ms, P < 0.001) and more substantially between mid-portion and termination (118.2 +/- 66.7 vs 201.8 +/- 93.7 ms, P < 10-21). During paroxysms of AF, the mean RR interval and the variability of RR intervals increases. Termination of a paroxysm is preceded by a marked increase in RR interval variability.",

In the absence of a clear epidemiological link between intra-ocular pressure (IOP) and disease progression to blindness, the economic impact of treatments that lower IOP on long-term outcome cannot be estimated. As an alternative, effectiveness may be expressed as the ability to control IOP over time, making it possible to estimate the cost-effectiveness of therapies. The objective of this study was to investigate treatment strategies for patients newly diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OH) in Germany and to estimate the impact of new topical therapies on the total cost of treatment.", 
    "120": "We performed a retrospective analysis of 200 randomly selected patient charts in 50 ophthalmology practices. Demographics, diagnoses, IOP and detailed resource utilization over 2 years were collected. Resources were valued independently from the quantitative data collection, and a standard charge from the perspective of the third party payer, as well as a cost from the societal viewpoint, was determined for each item. A Markov model was created to calculate total treatment costs with the new therapy.", 
    "121": "During the 2 years, 54% of patients had their therapy changed at least once. Mean total charge and cost per patient were DM 815 and DM 1274, respectively. Mean IOP at baseline was 31.2 mm at baseline and 18.8 mm after 2 years. IOP at baseline was positively correlated with costs, while IOP reduction after treatment initiation was negatively correlated with costs. Simulations of the effect of new topical therapies on treatment costs to third party payers and to society indicate that a potential reduction or delay of surgical interventions may partly offset the extra cost of the new drugs.", 
    "122": "Observational data for glaucoma treatment indicate a high frequency of treatment changes that are associated with higher costs. New treatments that control IOP effectively over time may thus reduce the cost of patient management.

The drug was given orally in a daily dose of 200 mg for 30 days. Plasma ANP levels increased by 187% despite the drop in blood pressure, while left atrial and ventricular diameters remained unchanged. These findings indicate that ANP secretion, which is mediated by beta 1-receptor blockade, is not affected by stimulation of the vasodilatory beta 2-receptors. There is strong evidence suggesting that beta-blockers exert part of their antihypertensive action by increasing ANP secretion.", 
    "124": "The effects of racemic nebivolol, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg; d-nebivolol, 2.5 mg; l-nebivolol, 2.5 mg; atenolol, 50 mg; and placebo, each given once daily for 7 days, on exercise-induced increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure were compared in a seven-way double-blind randomized crossover trial in 14 healthy male volunteers. Observations on these variables were made 3 and 24 hours after dosing on the first and last days of therapy. Similar effects on both exercise-induced tachycardia and increases in systolic blood pressure were seen with nebivolol 5.0 mg and with d-nebivolol 2.5 mg; l-nebivolol 2.5 mg was no different from placebo. These data show that the beta-blocking effects of nebivolol reside in the d-isomer. A dose-related response was evident with racemic nebivolol in inhibiting exercise-induced tachycardia over the range of doses studied. Whereas the effects of atenolol on both exercise-induced tachycardia and increases in systolic blood pressure were fully evident on the first day of treatment, those of nebivolol, especially with regard to heart rate, and, to a lesser degree, systolic pressure, were greater on the final than on the first day. Nebivolol had a clearly superior trough-to-peak efficacy ratio than atenolol.", 
    "125": "The prognosis remains poor for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), despite reduced mortality rates resulting from the addition of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to traditional treatment regimens. Because much of the myocardial damage that occurs in patients with CHF may be related to sympathetic activation, interest in the use of beta blockers has grown. Recent studies have shown the benefits of beta blocker therapy in many patients with heart failure. Carvedilol, the first beta blocker labeled in the United States specifically for the treatment of heart failure, has been shown to improve left ventricular ejection fraction and may reduce mortality.", 
    "126": "Recent studies in heart cells have shown taurine to induce a sustained increase of both intracellular Ca2+ and Na+. These results led us to believe that the increase in Na+ by taurine could be due to Na+ entry through the taurine-Na+ cotransporter which in turn favours transarcolemmal Ca2+ influx through Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange. Therefore, we investigated the effect of beta-alanine, a blocker of the taurine-Na+ cotransporter and low concentrations of CBDMB (a pyrazine derivative, 5-(N-4chlorobenzyl)-2',4'-dimethylbenzamil), a Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger blocker on taurine-induced [Ca]i increase in embryonic chick heart cells. Using Fura-2 Ca2+ imaging and Fluo-3Ca2+ confocal microscopy techniques, taurine (20 mM) as expected, induced a sustained increase in [Ca]i at both the cytosolic and the nuclear levels. Preexposure to 500 microM of the blocker of the taurine-Na+ cotransporter, beta-alanine, prevented the amino acid-induced increase of total [Ca]i. On the other hand, application of beta-alanine did not reverse the action of taurine on total [Ca]i. However, low concentrations of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger blocker, CBDMB, reversed the taurine-induced sustained increase of cytosolic and nuclear free calcium (in presence or absence of beta-alanine). Thus, the effect of taurine on [Ca]i in heart cells appears to be due to Na+ entry through the taurine-Na+ cotransporter which in turn favours transarcolemmal Ca2+ influx through the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger."
