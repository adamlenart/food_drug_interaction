Norepinephrine (NE) plays a significant modulatory role in the acquisition of learning; however, other neurotransmitters are also involved. The goal was to determine whether NE, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (GLU) release are observed in cerebellar cortex during EBC, and whether such release was selectively associated with training. Further studies examined the role of the beta-noradrenergic receptor in consolidation of the learned response by local infusion of propranolol at 5-120 min following training into the cerebellar cortex. In vivo microdialysis coupled to EBC was performed to examine neurotransmitter release. An increase in the extracellular level of NE was observed during EBC and was maximal on day 1 and diminished in amplitude with subsequent days of training. No changes in baseline NE release were observed in pseudoconditioning indicating that NE release is directly related to the associative learning process. The extracellular levels of GABA were also increased selectively during paired training however, the magnitude of GABA release increased over days of training. GLU release was observed to increase during both paired and unpaired training, suggesting that learning does not occur prior to the information arriving in the cerebellum. When propranolol was administered at either 5-, 60-, or 120-min post-training, there was an inhibition of conditioned responses, these data support the hypothesis that NE is important for consolidation of learning. In another set of experiments we demonstrate that the timing of release of NE, GABA and glutamate are significantly delayed in onset and lengthened in duration in the 22-month-old F344 rats. Over days of training the timing of release becomes closer to the timing of training and this is associated with increased learning of conditioned responses in the aged rats.",

    "2": "A 63-year-old hypertensive and diabetic man with peripheral neuropathy and lacunar pseudobulbar palsy presented with three episodes of spasmodic laughter which had induced syncope. No new episode was observed after the beginning of low dose bisoprolol.", 
    "3": "Sustained or spasmodic laughter is accompanied by repetitive bursts of forced expiration, corresponding to short repetitive Valsalva maneuvers. Laughter-induced syncope is considered as one of the many Valsalva-type/vagally mediated syncopal attacks leading to rapid fall in blood pressure without compensatory tachycardia. The presence of autonomic diabetic neuropathy may also contribute to these attacks.", 
    "4": "Alpha-Synuclein (alpha-syn), a 140 amino acid protein associated with presynaptic membranes in brain, is a major constituent of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (PD). Three missense mutations (A30P, A53T and E46K) in the alpha-syn gene are associated with rare autosomal dominant forms of familial PD. However, the regulation of alpha-syn's cellular localization in neurons and the effects of the PD-linked mutations are poorly understood.", 
    "5": "In the present study, we analysed the ability of cytosolic factors to regulate alpha-syn binding to synaptic membranes. We show that co-incubation with brain cytosol significantly increases the membrane binding of normal and PD-linked mutant alpha-syn. To characterize cytosolic factor(s) that modulate alpha-syn binding properties, we investigated the ability of proteins, lipids, ATP and calcium to modulate alpha-syn membrane interactions. We report that lipids and ATP are two of the principal cytosolic components that modulate Wt and A53T alpha-syn binding to the synaptic membrane. We further show that 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C16:0 PAF) is one of the principal lipids found in complex with cytosolic proteins and is required to enhance alpha-syn interaction with synaptic membrane. In addition, the impaired membrane binding observed for A30P alpha-syn was significantly mitigated by the presence of protease-sensitive factors in brain cytosol.", 
    "6": "These findings suggest that endogenous brain cytosolic factors regulate Wt and mutant alpha-syn membrane binding, and could represent potential targets to influence alpha-syn solubility in brain.",

We report perioperative and postoperative management of two such cases with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. The first patient is a 41-year-old man with a past history of uncontrolled Graves disease, and was scheduled for emergency video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for spontaneous pneumothorax. The second patient is a 25-year-old man with a past history of hypertension, and was scheduled for open reduction and internal fixation for mandibular fracture. In both patients, tachycardia and hypertension were observed at admission to the operating room. Therapy included the use of landiolol infusion, a short acting beta blocker, for control of tachycardia. Heart rate was controlled around 90 beats x min(-1) using landiolol during surgery. In each case, landiolol was administered until they can take long acting beta blocker and antithyroid drug orally. In the postoperative period, delirium appeared for a few hours in the first case, but no severe complications were observed in each case. Short acting beta blocker was useful for control of tachycardia in the perioperative and postoperative management of the patient with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism.",

Physicians are responsible for initiating, titrating and optimizing drug and device therapy to reduce morbidity and mortality.

    "13": "A comparison of the responses of extracellular pH, buffering capacity and actin cytoskeleton in autotroph and heterotroph Chenopodium rubrum cells to heat shock revealed cell-specific reactions: alkalinization caused by the heat shock at 25-35 degrees C was higher in heterotroph cells and characterized by heat shock-induced changes in the actin cytoskeleton and ring formation at 35-37 degrees C. Rings (diameter up to 3 mum) disappeared and extracellular pH recovered after the heat-shocked cells were transferred into control medium. At 41 degrees C, no rings but a network of coarse actin filaments were induced; at higher temperatures, fragmentation of the actin cytoskeleton and release of buffering compounds occurred, indicating sudden membrane leakage at 45-47 degrees C. The calcium chelator EGTA [ethylene-glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl-ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic-acid] increased the frequency of heat shock-induced rings. Ionophore (10 microM nigericin) and the sodium/proton antiport blocker [100 microM 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride] mimicked the effect of the 37 degrees C heat shock. The cytoskeleton inhibitors latrunculin B, cytochalasin D and 2,3-butanedione monoxime inhibited ring formation but not alkalinization. In autotroph cells, the treatment with nigericin (10 microM) produced rings, although the actin cytoskeleton was not affected by temperatures up to 45 degrees C. We conclude that Chenopodium cells express a specific temperature sensor that has ascendancy over the organization of the actin cytoskeleton; this is probably a temperature- and potential-sensitive proton-transporting mechanism that is dependent on the culture conditions of the heterotroph cells.",

Besides beta blockers, a variety of substances have proved efficacious in migraine prevention. Thus individualised treatment of migraine patients is possible. When choosing the appropriate preventive drug, the potential side effects are considered. Drugs of first choice, besides beta blockers, are flunarizine, valproic acid, and topiramate. Second-choice drugs with lower efficacy or less well published evidence include amitriptyline, venlafaxine, gabapentin, naproxen, acetylsalicylic acid, butterbur root, vitamin B2, and magnesium. Flunarizine or propranolol are recommended for children.", 
    "15": "Diastolic heart failure is characterized by the symptoms and signs of heart failure, a preserved ejection fraction and abnormal left ventricular (LV) diastolic function caused by a decreased LV compliance and relaxation. The signs and symptoms of diastolic heart failure are indistinguishable from those of heart failure related to systolic dysfunction; therefore, the diagnosis of diastolic heart failure is often one of exclusion. The majority of patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction have a history of hypertension. Hypertension induces a compensatory thickening of the ventricular wall in an attempt to normalize wall stress, which results in LV concentric hypertrophy, which in turn decreases LV compliance and LV diastolic filling. There is an abnormal accumulation of fibrillar collagen accompanying the hypertension-induced LV hypertrophy, which is also associated with decreased compliance and LV diastolic dysfunction. There are no specific guidelines for treating diastolic heart failure, but pharmacological treatment should be directed at normalizing blood pressure, promoting regression of LV hypertrophy, preventing tachycardia and treating symptoms of congestion. Preventive strategies directed toward an early and aggressive blood pressure control are likely to offer the greatest promise for reducing the incidence of diastolic heart failure.", 
    "16": "Lowering of the central pulse pressure (PP) has been shown to contribute to an improvement of the cardiac damage beyond that of lowering the brachial PP. We assessed the hypothesis that the change in the central PP is more useful than that in the brachial PP in the assessment of the change in cardiac load.", 
    "17": "We studied 434 treated hypertensive patients whose home systolic blood pressure was 135 mmHg or higher. They were followed for 6 months after allocation to either a control group or an added treatment group (doxazosin 1-4 mg and atenolol when needed). We measured the brachial and central (carotid) blood pressure simultaneously using a validated device, and the B-type natriuretic peptide at baseline and at the sixth month of treatment.", 
    "18": "In the added treatment group, the brachial systolic blood pressure was successfully reduced, but the central PP increased significantly, whereas the other blood pressure parameters did not change from the baseline. In the added treatment group, the change in the B-type natriuretic peptide was significantly correlated with the change in the brachial PP (r = 0.18), central systolic blood pressure (r = 0.18), central PP (r = 0.26), and PP amplification (r = -0.22) even after adjusting for the confounding factors. The correlation with the central PP was stronger than with the brachial PP (P = 0.018) or central systolic blood pressure (P = 0.002), and these relationships were essentially the same even after adjustment for the use of atenolol or the change in heart rate.",

    "20": "The metabolic syndrome considerably increases the risk of cardiovascular and renal events in hypertension. It has been associated with a wide range of classical and new cardiovascular risk factors as well as with early signs of subclinical cardiovascular and renal damage. Obesity and insulin resistance, beside a constellation of independent factors, which include molecules of hepatic, vascular, and immunologic origin with proinflammatory properties, have been implicated in the pathogenesis. The close relationships among the different components of the syndrome and their associated disturbances make it difficult to understand what the underlying causes and consequences are. At each of these key points, insulin resistance and obesity/proinflammatory molecules, interaction of demographics, lifestyle, genetic factors, and environmental fetal programming results in the final phenotype. High prevalence of end-organ damage and poor prognosis has been demonstrated in a large number of cross-sectional and a few number of prospective studies. The objective of treatment is both to reduce the high risk of a cardiovascular or a renal event and to prevent the much greater chance that metabolic syndrome patients have to develop type 2 diabetes or hypertension. Treatment consists in the opposition to the underlying mechanisms of the metabolic syndrome, adopting lifestyle interventions that effectively reduce visceral obesity with or without the use of drugs that oppose the development of insulin resistance or body weight gain. Treatment of the individual components of the syndrome is also necessary. Concerning blood pressure control, it should be based on lifestyle changes, diet, and physical exercise, which allows for weight reduction and improves muscular blood flow. When antihypertensive drugs are necessary, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II-AT1 receptor blockers, or even calcium channel blockers are preferable over diuretics and classical beta-blockers in monotherapy, if no compelling indications are present for its use. If a combination of drugs is required, low-dose diuretics can be used. A combination of thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers should be avoided.",

Consequently, the positive lusitropic effect of beta-adrenoceptors stimulation could be altered, and beta3-adrenoceptor over-expression may play a role, as previously demonstrated with an altered positive inotropic effect. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the beta-adrenergic positive lusitropic effect is altered in diabetic cardiomyopathy, and that beta3-adrenoceptor over-expression is involved.",

The beta3-adrenoceptor was up-regulated whereas beta1-adrenoceptor was down-regulated in 4W and 12W diabetic, compared with healthy, rats. Nevertheless, S-cyanopindolol or NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester had no lusitropic effect.",

    "25": "One of the greatest challenges of cardiovascular prevention is to minimize the risk of cardiovascular events through the achievement of target lipid levels. Its importance is suggested by the comprehensive meta-analyses of large scale clinical trials and the therapeutic guidelines determining everyday clinical practice. The attainment of target levels is often emphasized, nevertheless, there is a gap between theory and practice. The authors compare the goal attainment rate based on Hungarian medical literature and their own data, and analyze the possibilities of further improvement. The CEL Program evaluated the achievement rate of target total cholesterol levels in more than 10 000 patients of general practitioners in 2004, 2005 and 2006, and the ratio increased from 12% to 30% within 3 years. According to the results of the Hungarian REALITY study the rate of patients achieving the target total cholesterol levels was 21% in 2004, and it increased to 27% during a 3-year period. To this very low improving rate also belongs the fact that in 2007, when only one fourth of patients were on target levels, 87% of general practitioners and 56% of specialists reconciled themselves to it and did not propose any modification in the therapy of patients not achieving the target levels. The surveys conducted at the department of internal medicine with cardiological profile of the county hospital in Gyula proved a considerable increase in the last 7 years in the administration of drugs improving the life expectancy of cardiovascular patients (aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors and statins) due to the widespread application of clinical guidelines and the special attention; nowadays the administration rate is above 90% in all four groups. Nevertheless, the rate of patients achieving the LDL-cholesterol goals was 37% in the high risk and 18% in the very high risk groups in December 2007 and January 2008. The fact that in the latter group only 21% of patients received combination therapy indicates that improving this ratio may be the next step. A greater emphasis should be placed on the achievement of target levels and regular revision of applied medical therapy, particularly in the high and very high risk patients as these groups can benefit the most from it.", 
    "26": "Induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) associates with cigarette smoke exposure in many malignancies. Nicotine and its derivative, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), are the two important components in cigarette smoke that contributes to cancer development. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which nicotine or NNK promotes gastric carcinogenesis remains largely unknown. We found that nicotine and NNK significantly enhanced cell proliferation in AGS cells that expressed both alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 nAChR) and beta-adrenergic receptors. Treatment of cells with alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX, alpha7nAChR antagonist) or propranolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist) blocked NNK-induced COX-2/PGE(2) and cell proliferation, while nicotine-mediated cell growth and COX-2/PGE(2) induction can only be suppressed by propranolol, but not alpha-BTX. Moreover, in contrast to the dependence of growth promoting effect of nicotine on Erk activation, inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) repressed NNK-induced COX-2 upregulation and resulted in suppression of cell growth. In addition, nicotine and NNK mediated COX-2 induction via different receptors to modulate several G1/S transition regulatory proteins and promote gastric cancer cell growth. Selective COX-2 inhibitor (SC-236) caused G1 arrest and abrogated nicotine/NNK-induced cell proliferation. Aberrant expression of cyclin D1 and other G1 regulatory proteins are reversed by blockade of COX-2. These results pointed to the importance of adrenergic and nicotinic receptors in gastric tumor growth through MAPK/COX-2 activation, which may perhaps provide a chemoprevention strategy for cigarette smoke-related gastric carcinogenesis.", 
    "27": "The prognostic value of a hypertensive blood pressure (BP) response is still unclear. Therefore, the prognostic value of a hypertensive BP response in patients during single-stage exercise testing for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) on long-term mortality and major adverse cerebrovascular and cardiac events (MACCEs) was investigated. In addition, effects of statin, beta-blocker, and aspirin use in patients with known or suspected PAD were studied. A total of 2,109 patients were enrolled in an observational prospective study from 1993 to 2005. Hypertensive BP response was defined as an increase in systolic BP > or = 55 mm Hg (95(th) percentile within our population) after a single-stage treadmill exercise test. The outcome was obtained by using the civil registries, and a questionnaire about cardiac events was sent to all survivals. Hypertensive BP response was associated with increased risk of long-term mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12 to 1.80) and MACCEs (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.97). After adjustments for clinical risk factors and propensity score, baseline statin use was associated with reduced risk of long-term mortality (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.79), and statin, beta-blocker, and aspirin use were associated with reduced risk of MACCEs (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.81; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95; HR 0.73, 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.92, respectively). In conclusion, hypertensive BP response at exercise in patients with known or suspected PAD is an important independent risk factor for all-cause long-term mortality and MACCEs, whereas statin, beta-blocker, and aspirin use were associated with an improved outcome.", 
    "28": "The clinical course and risk factors associated with beta(2)-agonist therapy for asthma have not been investigated previously in patients with the long-QT syndrome (LQTS). The risk of a first LQTS-related cardiac event due to beta(2)-agonist therapy was examined in 3,287 patients enrolled in the International LQTS Registry with QTc > or = 450 ms. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the independent contribution of clinical factors for first cardiac events (syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, or sudden death) from birth through age 40. Time-dependent beta(2)-agonist therapy for asthma was associated with an increased risk for cardiac events (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.00, 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 3.15, p = 0.003) after adjustment for relevant covariates including time-dependent beta-blocker use, gender, QTc, and history of asthma. This risk was augmented within the first year after the initiation of beta(2)-agonist therapy (HR = 3.53, p = 0.006). The combined use of beta(2)-agonist therapy and anti-inflammatory steroids was associated with an elevated risk for cardiac events (HR = 3.66, p <0.01); beta-blocker therapy was associated with a reduction in cardiac events in those using beta(2) agonists (HR = 0.14, p = 0.05). In conclusion, beta(2)-agonist therapy was associated with an increased risk for cardiac events in patients with asthma with LQTS, and this risk was diminished in patients receiving beta blockers.",

    "34": "alpha-Synuclein is the fundamental component of Lewy bodies which occur in the brain of 60% of sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease patients. Moreover, a proteolytic fragment of alpha-synuclein, the so-called non-amyloid component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid, was found to be an integral part of Alzheimer's dementia related plaques. However, the role of alpha-synuclein in pathomechanism of Alzheimer's disease remains elusive. In particular, the relationship between alpha-synuclein and amyloid beta is unknown. In the present study we showed the involvement of alpha-synuclein in amyloid beta secretion and in the mechanism of amyloid beta evoked mitochondria dysfunction and cell death. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells transfected with amyloid beta precursor protein bearing Swedish double mutation (APPsw) and control PC12 cells transfected with empty vector were used in this study. alpha-Synuclein (10microM) was found to increase by twofold amyloid beta secretion from control and APPsw PC12 cells. Moreover, alpha-synuclein decreased the viability of PC12 cells by about 50% and potentiated amyloid beta toxicity leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase-dependent programmed cell death. Inhibitor of caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-FMK, 100microM), and a mitochondrial permeability transition pore blocker, cyclosporine A (2microM) protected PC12 cells against alpha-synuclein or amyloid beta evoked cell death. In contrast Z-DEVD-FMK and cyclosporine A were ineffective in APPsw cells containing elevated amount of amyloid beta treated with alpha-synuclein. It was found that the inhibition of neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthase reversed the toxic effect of alpha-synuclein in control but not in APPsw cells. Our results indicate that alpha-synuclein enhances the release and toxicity of amyloid beta leading to nitric oxide mediated irreversible mitochondria dysfunction and caspase-dependent programmed cell death.", 
    "35": "A capillary electrophoresis method using carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrin as the chiral selector and mixture of methanol and ethanol as the organic additive was successfully developed for the simultaneous enantioseparation and determination of six beta-blockers, namely, carteolol, atenolol, sotalol, metoprolol, esmolol and propranolol in this paper. The most suitable running buffer for enantioseparation was found to be the solution of 20 mmol/L NaH(2)PO(4)-Na(2)HOP(4) (pH 5.5) containing 1.5% w/v carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrin, 5% v/v methanol and 5% v/v ethanol. Furthermore, field-amplified sample injection as an on-line sample stacking method was developed in order to increase the detection sensitivity. The experimental conditions for both simultaneous enantioseparation and the field-amplified sample injection method had been investigated in detail. Under the optimum conditions, the detection limits (defined as S/N=3) of this method were 0.01, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05 and 0.5 microg /mL for (+/-) carteolol, (+/-) atenolol, (+/-) sotalol, (+/-) metoprolol, (+/-) esmolol and (+/-) propranolol, respectively, which were much lower than those of the conventional methods. The enhancement factors were greatly improved by 25-fold for the enantiomers of the beta-blockers except five-fold for (+/-) propranolol.

    "36": "The growing number of chiral new drug substances requires increasing efforts in developing enantioselective methods. According to International conference on Harmonization guidelines, one should quantify the enantiomeric impurity of 0.1% relative to the major constituent. Capillary electrophoresis has evolved into an important tool for the separation of chiral drugs. The common strategies consist of two steps: firstly, initial separation conditions are evaluated. This screening usually focuses on the selection of the appropriate chiral selector. In our study 22 neutral, anionic or cationic cyclodextrins were dissolved in phosphate buffer (pH 2.5, 50 mM, CD conc.: 2.0%). Then they were investigated for the separation of 14 chiral compounds. Secondly, the obtained initial conditions for the enantiomeric separation were optimized in terms of resolution and analysis time. In our approach, important optimized factors including the concentration of the chiral selector (1-10%), the pH of the buffer (2.0-9.0), and the percentage of organic modifier (0-15%) were studied. This common strategy was completed by elaborating final requirements for the quantification of the enantiomeric impurity. A resolution between 3 and 4 was found to be necessary for the racemic mixture during the screening and optimization steps, in order to later allow for peak overloading and thus to sufficiently increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The complete strategy was conducted for atenolol, isoprenaline, verapamil and mandelic acid.", 
    "37": "We previously identified an alpha1-AR-ERK (alpha1A-adrenergic receptor-extracellular signal-regulated kinase) survival signaling pathway in adult cardiac myocytes. Here, we investigated localization of alpha1-AR subtypes (alpha1A and alpha1B) and how their localization influences alpha1-AR signaling in cardiac myocytes. Using binding assays on myocyte subcellular fractions or a fluorescent alpha1-AR antagonist, we localized endogenous alpha1-ARs to the nucleus in wild-type adult cardiac myocytes. To clarify alpha1 subtype localization, we reconstituted alpha1 signaling in cultured alpha1A- and alpha1B-AR double knockout cardiac myocytes using alpha1-AR-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins. Similar to endogenous alpha1-ARs and alpha1A- and alpha1B-GFP colocalized with LAP2 at the nuclear membrane. alpha1-AR nuclear localization was confirmed in vivo using alpha1-AR-GFP transgenic mice. The alpha1-signaling partners Galphaq and phospholipase Cbeta1 also colocalized with alpha1-ARs only at the nuclear membrane. Furthermore, we observed rapid catecholamine uptake mediated by norepinephrine-uptake-2 and found that alpha1-mediated activation of ERK was not inhibited by a membrane impermeant alpha1-blocker, suggesting alpha1 signaling is initiated at the nucleus. Contrary to prior studies, we did not observe alpha1-AR localization to caveolae, but we found that alpha1-AR signaling initiated at the nucleus led to activated ERK localized to caveolae. In summary, our results show that nuclear alpha1-ARs transduce signals to caveolae at the plasma membrane in cardiac myocytes.",

Short-term effects were defined as death within 3 months after the first prescription of a topical beta-blocker. Mortality was compared between incident beta-blocker users, that is, participants who started using a topical beta-blocker between the onset of the Rotterdam Study in 1990 and October 1, 2004, and age-matched controls.

Yet, there are no alternative or complimentary electrocardiographic (ECG) techniques available for assessing the cardiotoxicity of novel compounds. In this study, we investigated a set of novel ECG parameters quantifying the morphology of the T-loop.

These parameters measure the time interval needed for the heart vector amplitude to change from its maximum value to a time when its amplitude has been reduced by 30%, 50%, and 70%. These measurements are called early repolarization duration (ERD) when they are located before the T-wave apex and late repolarization duration (LRD) when measured after the apex. They depend on both the speed of the repolarization process and the morphology of the T loop. Thirty-nine healthy individuals were exposed to sotalol in a crossover-design study. Sixteen ECGs were recorded per day during 3 days. The first day (day 0) was baseline; a single dose of sotalol (160 mg) was given during day 1, and a double dose was given during day 2 (320 mg).

    "56": "Neuropathic pain has been known to be refractory to traditional analgesics, such as opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatoy drugs. Some mechanisms of the development of neuropathic pain have been proposed; 1) sprouting of A beta fibers to the superficial layer of the dorsal horn, 2) ectopic discharge in the dorsal root ganglion and/or in neuroma at the nerve stump, 3) spinal sensitization. Ectopic discharge has been reported to be inhibited by Na+ channel blocker, such as lidocaine, and anticonvulsant. Lidocaine and anticonvulsant are used in the management of neuropathic pain. Activation of NMDA receptor is usually involved in the development of spinal sensitization and NMDA receptor antagonist, such as ketamine, is used in the management of neuropathic pain. Recently, alpha2delta subunit blocker, new class of anticonvulsant, is introduced to the management of neuropathic pain. alpha2delta subunit is the subunit of Ca2+ channel and modulate the influx of Ca2+. This Ca2+ influx induces release of neurotransmitter in the neuron. alpha 2 delta subunit blockers, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, may reduce the release of neurotransmitter and elicit analgesic effect in the treatment of neuropathic pain.",

The retention of analyzed substances was also examined in terms of mobile phase composition. Sixteen different configurations of mobile phases were prepared, all based on methanol and acetonitrile with ammonium acetate and ammonium formate. The difference in retention between ammonium formate and acetate water solutions, and peak shape changes related to the addition of triethylamine (TEA), were investigated. Principal component analysis was used to find the similarities between stationary phases. Polar-embedded phases synthesized on the same sorbent possess very similar properties. All phases based on silica gel compared with the monolithic column also showed similarities in retention of beta-blockers. The addition of TEA to the mobile phase did not influence strongly the retention, and analysis of asymmetry factors showed only a little peak broadening for a few compounds on the monolithic column.", 
    "58": "We investigated the role of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels in beta3-adrenoceptor (beta3-AR)-induced relaxation in rat urinary bladder smooth muscle (UBSM). BRL 37344, a specific beta3-AR agonist, inhibits spontaneous contractions of isolated UBSM strips. SR59230A, a specific beta3-AR antagonist, and H89, a PKA inhibitor, reduced the inhibitory effect of BRL 37344. Iberiotoxin, a specific BK channel inhibitor, shifts the BRL 37344 concentration response curves for contraction amplitude, net muscle force, and tone to the right. Freshly dispersed UBSM cells and the perforated mode of the patch-clamp technique were used to determine further the role of beta3-AR stimulation by BRL 37344 on BK channel activity. BRL 37344 increased spontaneous, transient, outward BK current (STOC) frequency by 46.0 +/- 20.1%. In whole cell mode at a holding potential of V(h) = 0 mV, the single BK channel amplitude was 5.17 +/- 0.28 pA, whereas in the presence of BRL 37344, it was 5.55 +/- 0.41 pA. The BK channel open probability was also unchanged. In the presence of ryanodine and nifedipine, the current-voltage relationship in response to depolarization steps in the presence and absence of BRL 37344 was identical. In current-clamp mode, BRL 37344 caused membrane potential hyperpolarization from -26.1 +/- 2.1 mV (control) to -29.0 +/- 2.2 mV. The BRL 37344-induced hyperpolarization was eliminated by application of iberiotoxin, tetraethylammonium or ryanodine. The data indicate that stimulation of beta3-AR relaxes rat UBSM by increasing the BK channel STOC frequency, which causes membrane hyperpolarization and thus relaxation.", 
    "59": "Urotensin II (UII) was identified as the ligand for a novel G protein-coupled receptor, GPR14. UII was found not only to have a potent vasoconstrictive action but also to have profibrotic effects in the heart. The present study was to define whether UII and GPR14 also play important roles in diabetes-induced renal fibrosis and dysfunction. Diabetic rats were induced using streptozotocin, and the rat proximal tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E) were used for the in vitro mechanism study. Results showed that expression of UII and GPR14 was significantly upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in the diabetic kidneys compared with controls. The upregulated expressions of UII and GPR14 in the kidney were accompanied by significant increases in the renal profibrotic factor transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 expression, the renal extracellular matrix (fibronectin and collagen IV) accumulation, and the renal dysfunction (increases in urinal N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase content, 24-h urinary retinol-binding protein excretion rate, and decrease in creatinine clearance rate). Exposure of NRK-52E cells to 10(-8) mol/l UII for 48 h caused a significant increase of TGF-beta1, but not ANG II, production that was GPR14- and calcium-dependent, since GPR14 small-interfering RNA and calcium channel blocker nimodipine or calcium chelator EDTA all could abolish the induction of TGF- beta1 by UII. Furthermore, exposure of NRK-52E cells to TGF-beta1 or ANG II also increased UII and GPR14 mRNA expressions. These results suggested that diabetes-induced upregulation of UII and GPR14, most likely through autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms, plays an important role in TGF-beta1-mediated renal fibrosis and dysfunction.",

The S(-)PRO stimulus generalized fully to the beta-adrenoceptor agent pindolol, the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine, cocaine, and the serotonergic agents TFMPP and RU 24969; partial generalization occurred to (-)ephedrine and nisoxetine but not to fenfluramine or 5-OMe DMT. The S(-)PRO stimulus was blocked completely (and competitively) when prazosin, an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, was given in combination with the training dose of S(-)PRO. Moreover, prazosin exerted antagonism of the S(-)PRO-like effect of (+/-)PRO or R(+)PRO but produced only partial antagonism of the S(-)PRO-like effect of cocaine. In a second study, rats were trained to discriminate 8 mg/kg of cocaine from saline. The cocaine stimulus generalized to S(-)PRO, (+/-)PRO, and R(+)PRO. Prazosin partially attenuated the stimulus effect of cocaine (8 mg/kg) but completely blocked the cocaine-like effects of (+/-), S(-), and R(+)PRO.",

Genetic variants in the beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1-AR) associated with lesser response to beta-blockers are more common in blacks than in whites.

We also measured plasma atenolol concentrations and determined genotypes for variants of the beta1-AR (Ser49Gly, Arg389Gly) and alpha2C-AR (del322-325). The effects of ethnicity, genotype, and other covariates on the heart rate reduction after atenolol were estimated in multiple regression analyses.",

    "68": "Most of the evidence suggests that peptides in the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family act on CRF receptors and are involved in depressive disorders. Urocortin 3 (Ucn 3) is specific for CRF type 2 (CRF(2)) receptors and mediates anxiolytic-like action. Little is known about the roles of Ucn 3 and CRH(2) receptors on depressive disorders. The previous study revealed that Ucn 3 elicits the antidepressant-like action by shortening the immobility time and increasing both the climbing time and the swimming time. The involvement of the adrenergic and serotonergic receptors in the antidepressant-like effect of Ucn 3 (0.5\u03bcg/2\u03bcl, i.c.v.) was studied in a modified forced swimming test (FST) in mice. Mice were pretreated with a non-selective \u03b1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, an \u03b1(1)/\u03b1(2\u03b2)-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin, an \u03b1(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonist, yohimbine, a mixed 5-HT(1)/5-HT(2) serotonergic receptor antagonist, methysergide, a non-selective 5-HT(2) serotonergic receptor antagonist, cyproheptadine or a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol. Phenoxybenzamine prevented the effects of Ucn 3 on the immobility time. Prazosin prevented the effects of Ucn 3 on the climbing time. Yohimbine prevented the effects of Ucn 3 on the immobility, climbing and swimming times. Methysergide prevented the effects of Ucn 3 on the immobility and climbing time. Cyproheptadine prevented the effects of Ucn 3 on the swimming time. Propranolol did not change the effects of Ucn 3. The results demonstrated that the antidepressant-like effect of Ucn 3 is mediated, at least in part, by an interaction of the \u03b1-adrenergic and serotonergic receptors in a modified mouse FST.", 
    "69": "The purpose of the present study was to verify our assumption that rhythmic respiratory activity may be regulated by endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) in the medullary slices of neonatal rats. We found that a moderate concentration of donor of H(2)S, NaHS, mainly induced diphasic respiratory responses indicated by changes of discharge frequency (DF) of hypoglossal rootlets, an initial inhibitory stage followed by a later excitatory one. Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) substrate, cysteine (CYS), exerted similar effects. CBS inhibitor, NH(2)OH, could eliminate both inhibitory and excitatory effects in the two stages induced by CYS. K(ATP) channel blocker, glibenclamide (Gl), could eliminate the decrease in DF in the initial stage, but not the increase in the later one. On the other hand, adenyl cyclase (AC) inhibitor, SQ-22536 (SQ) could eliminate the increase in DF in the later stage, but not the decrease in the initial one, of the rootlets caused by NaHS. Co-application of Gl and SQ eliminated both inhibitory and excitatory effect induced by NaHS. The cAMP level was increased in the later stage but not in the initial one by NaHS, and the increase in the cAMP level could be eliminated by SQ. It can be concluded that the endogenous H(2)S could be produced through the CBS-H(2)S pathway and could be involved in the control of the central rhythmic respiration in the in vitro medullary slices of neonatal rats by opening K(ATP) channels and activating AC-cAMP pathway of the neurons.", 
    "70": "Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience. We demonstrated the crucial role of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the negative affective component of somatic and visceral pain induced by intraplantar formalin and intraperitoneal acetic acid injections, respectively, in rats. Recently, we reported the involvement of enhanced noradrenergic transmission via beta-adrenoceptors within the ventral BNST (vBNST) in formalin-induced aversion. Here, we examined the role of intra-vBNST noradrenergic transmission in the negative affective component of visceral pain induced by intraperitoneal acetic acid injection. In vivo microdialysis showed that extracellular noradrenaline levels within the vBNST significantly increased after intraperitoneal acetic acid injection. Using a conditioned place aversion (CPA) test, we found that intra-vBNST injection of timolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, dose-dependently attenuated the acetic acid-induced CPA without reducing nociceptive behaviors. These results suggest that enhanced noradrenergic transmission via beta-adrenoceptors within the vBNST plays a pivotal role in the negative affective, but not sensory, component of visceral pain.", 
    "71": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in the excitatory effect induced by genistein in isolated guinea pig left ventricular papillary muscles and to determine relationship of genistein action with the tyrosine kinase pathway and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, the cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) signal system and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ mobilization. Genistein (1-100 microM) significantly increased contraction of left ventricular papillary muscles from male and female guinea pigs in a concentration-dependent manner and its action had no obvious gender differences. Prior treatment with an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil hydrochloride, beta-adrenoceptor inhibitors propranolol and atenolol, an inhibitor of Na+-Ca2+ reverse exchanger Kb-r7943 or the blocker of estrogen receptor ICI 182,780 failed to alter the positive inotropic effect induced by genistein in papillary muscles. However, tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate or a potent phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor bpV (phen) could partly but significantly reduce the stimulatory action of genistein. Interestingly, insulin-like growth factor-1, a known PI3K activator could also decrease the stimulatory action of genistein obviously, but the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 had no significant effect on the stimulatory action of genistein. The excitatory effect of genistein was markedly attenuated not only after treatment with an inhibitor of cAMP synthesis Sq 22536, carbachol or an inhibitor of specific protein kinase A H-89, but also after the inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ mobilization by ruthenium red, ryanodine or the inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase thapsigargin. All these results indicate that the excitatory effects of genistein in papillary muscles are due to the inhibition of tyrosine kinase pathway and PI3K activity, thereby locally activating cAMP signal transduction and facilitating intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, but are not related to the activation of beta-adrenoceptor, the Na+-Ca2+ reverse exchange and the estrogen receptor.", 
    "72": "Endothelial injury is thought to play a pivotal role in the development and progression of vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension or restenosis, as well as their complications, including myocardial infarction or stroke. Accumulating evidence suggests that bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote endothelial repair and contribute to ischemia-induced neovascularization. Coronary artery disease and its risk factors, such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and smoking, are associated with a reduced number and impaired functional activity of circulating EPCs. Moreover, initial data suggest that reduced EPC levels are associated with endothelial dysfunction and an increased risk of cardiovascular events, compatible with the concept that impaired EPC-mediated vascular repair promotes progression of vascular disease. In this review we summarize recent data on the effects of pharmacological agents on mobilization and functional activity of EPCs. In particular, several experimental and clinical studies have suggested that statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, PPAR-gamma agonists and erythropoietin increase the number and functional activity of EPCs. The underlying mechanisms remain largely to be defined; however, they likely include activation of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, as well as inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase activity of progenitor cells.",

Health states were defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and death. At a given NYHA class and a given cycle, patients could die, be hospitalized for cardiovascular disease or remain stable. Risks for these events were derived from individual patient data from the SENIORS trial. The risk of each event in a given cycle was based on the subject's baseline characteristics and time in the current health state. The economic analysis was conducted from the UK NHS perspective with a lifetime horizon.

SSc-ILD is now one of the leading causes of death among patients with SSc. SSc-ILD, classified most often as a non-specific interstitial pneumonia, may culminate in interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and end-stage lung disease. Fibrosis in the lung is the net result of fibroblast proliferation and deposition of excessive amounts of extracellular matrix proteins. Among the many cytokines and growth factors involved in the pathogenesis of SSc-ILD, ET-1 may be a central mediator. In vitro and in vivo studies of animals and SSc patients support the notion that ET-1 can enhance the proliferation of pulmonary mesenchymal cells and may also enhance the fibrogenic effects of TGF-beta. Two well-designed randomized controlled trials of the dual ET receptor blocker bosentan were negative in their primary (and for SSc also secondary) endpoints, although there might be explanations for this apparent lack of efficacy.",

High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) is a key mediator in the development of sepsis. We investigated whether landiolol, a short-acting selective beta1-adrenoceptor-blocking agent, can attenuate acute lung injury and cardiac dysfunction in a rat model of endotoxin-induced sepsis. We administered LPS i.v. to rats, with or without simultaneous treatment with landiolol (0.1 mg/kg per min). After the induction of sepsis by LPS treatment, we measured cytokine and HMGB-1 levels in the serum and lung tissue. In addition, we performed histopathology, determined wet-to-dry weight ratios, and measured cardiac function and cell signaling in the lung. Cotreatment with landiolol was associated with significantly less severe disease, as assessed by lung histopathology and cardiac function metrics. Serum and lung HMGB-1 levels were lower over time among landiolol-treated animals. Furthermore, nuclear factor-kappaB activity was inhibited by the administration of landiolol. Cotreatment with the selective beta1-adrenoceptor-blocking agent landiolol protects against acute lung injury and cardiac dysfunction in a rat model of LPS-induced systemic inflammation. Treatment was associated with a significant reduction in serum levels of the inflammation mediator HMGB-1 and histological lung damage.", 
    "82": "Reactive airway disease predisposes patients to episodes of acute smooth muscle mediated bronchoconstriction. We have for the first time recently demonstrated the expression and function of endogenous ionotropic GABA(A) channels on airway smooth muscle cells. We questioned whether endogenous GABA(A) channels on airway smooth muscle could augment beta-agonist-mediated relaxation. Guinea pig tracheal rings or human bronchial airway smooth muscles were equilibrated in organ baths with continuous digital tension recordings. After pretreatment with or without the selective GABA(A) antagonist gabazine (100 muM), airway muscle was contracted with acetylcholine or beta-ala neurokinin A, followed by relaxation induced by cumulatively increasing concentrations of isoproterenol (1 nM to 1 muM) in the absence or presence of the selective GABA(A) agonist muscimol (10-100 muM). In separate experiments, guinea pig tracheal rings were pretreated with the large conductance K(Ca) channel blocker iberiotoxin (100 nM) after an EC(50) contraction with acetylcholine but before cumulatively increasing concentrations of isoproterenol (1 nM to 1 uM) in the absence or presence of muscimol (100 uM). GABA(A) activation potentiated the relaxant effects of isoproterenol after an acetylcholine or tachykinin-induced contraction in guinea pig tracheal rings or an acetylcholine-induced contraction in human endobronchial smooth muscle. This muscimol-induced potentiation of relaxation was abolished by gabazine pretreatment but persisted after blockade of the maxi K(Ca) channel. Selective activation of endogenous GABA(A) receptors significantly augments beta-agonist-mediated relaxation of guinea pig and human airway smooth muscle, which may have important therapeutic implications for patients in severe bronchospasm.",

Blood pressure (BP) and HR were monitored by telemetry. BRS and HR variability were estimated by linear regression between HR and BP responses to phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside and autoregressive spectral analysis. Measurements were made during control period, 7 days after induction of diabetes, and 7 days after ICV leptin infusion. STZ diabetes was associated with hyperglycemia (422 +/- 17 mg/dl) and bradycardia (-79 +/- 4 beats/min). Leptin decreased glucose levels (165 +/- 16 mg/dl) and raised HR to control values (303 +/- 10 to 389 +/- 10 beats/min). Intrinsic HR (IHR) and chronotropic responses to a full-blocking dose of propranolol and atropine were reduced during diabetes (260 +/- 7 vs. 316 +/- 6, -19 +/- 2 vs. -43 +/- 6, and 39 +/- 3 vs. 68 +/- 8 beats/min), and leptin treatment restored these variables to normal (300 +/- 7, -68 +/- 10, and 71 +/- 8 beats/min). Leptin normalized BRS (bradycardia, -2.6 +/- 0.3, -1.7 +/- 0.2, and -3.0 +/- 0.5; and tachycardia, -3.2 +/- 0.4, -1.9 +/- 0.3, and -3.4 +/- 0.3 beats.min(-1).mmHg(-1) for control, diabetes, and leptin) and HR variability (23 +/- 4 to 11 +/- 1.5 ms2). Chronic glucose infusion to maintain hyperglycemia during leptin infusion did not alter the effect of leptin on IHR but abolished the improved BRS. These results show rapid impairment of autonomic nervous system control of HR after the induction of diabetes and that central nervous system actions of leptin can abolish the hyperglycemia as well as the altered IHR and BRS in STZ-induced diabetes.",

On postoperative days 2 and 4, serum creatinine levels were higher among the control and the metoprolol treatment groups compared with the carvedilol treatment group (P < .005). However, there were no significant differences on postoperative day 7. In conclusion, increased antioxidant modulation by carvedilol attenuated renal I/R injury.",

    "101": "Recent evidence suggests that binding of agonist to its cognate receptor initiates not only classical G protein-mediated signaling, but also beta-arrestin-dependent signaling. One such beta-arrestin-mediated pathway uses the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR) to transactivate the EGFR. To determine whether beta-adrenergic ligands that do not activate G protein signaling (i.e., beta-blockers) can stabilize the beta(1)AR in a signaling conformation, we screened 20 beta-blockers for their ability to stimulate beta-arrestin-mediated EGFR transactivation. Here we show that only alprenolol (Alp) and carvedilol (Car) induce beta(1)AR-mediated transactivation of the EGFR and downstream ERK activation. By using mutants of the beta(1)AR lacking G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation sites and siRNA directed against beta-arrestin, we show that Alp- and Car-stimulated EGFR transactivation requires beta(1)AR phosphorylation at consensus G protein-coupled receptor kinase sites and beta-arrestin recruitment to the ligand-occupied receptor. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of Src and EGFR blocked Alp- and Car-stimulated EGFR transactivation. Our findings demonstrate that Alp and Car are ligands that not only act as classical receptor antagonists, but can also stimulate signaling pathways in a G protein-independent, beta-arrestin-dependent fashion.", 
    "102": "Nebivolol (Bystolic) is a cardioselective beta 1 (beta(1))-adrenergic receptor blocker with endothelium-dependent vasodilating properties. The endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by nebivolol is blocked by inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and guanylate cyclase. Nebivolol also increases in vitro and in vivo nitric oxide (NO), which is an essential signaling molecule involved in the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. This review summarizes the data involving nebivolol and NO bioavailability. Endothelium-dependent relaxation of blood vessels, which is impaired in hypertensive animals and humans, is reversed by nebivolol treatment. Animals exhibiting endothelial dysfunction also show an improvement in NO-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling and an increase in NO bioavailability when treated with nebivolol. When blood vessel and cultured endothelial cells from hypertensive animals are treated with nebivolol, there is a decrease in superoxide production and an increase in the expression and activity of endothelial NOS (eNOS). As a result of the increased bioavailability of NO, nebivolol also increases in vivo arterial distensibility, glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow. In normotensive volunteers, nebivolol infusion increases the forearm blood flow, an effect that is blocked by inhibitors of NOS and restored by the NOS substrate, L-arginine. In hypertensive patients, chronic treatment with nebivolol improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced by acetylcholine and shear stress and reverses endothelium-dependent vasoconstriction. Furthermore, nebivolol displays distinct hemodynamic properties in patients that include improvements in stroke volume and a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. These studies demonstrate that nebivolol produces endothelium-dependent vasodilation by increasing NO release, decreasing oxidative stress to increase NO bioavailability, or both. The NO-dependent vasodilatory action of nebivolol, coupled with its high beta(1)-adrenergic receptor selectivity, is unique among the clinically available beta-blockers and contributes to its efficacy and improved tolerability (e.g., less fatigue and sexual dysfunction) as an antihypertensive agent.",

Here we consider the updated NICE guideline, the rationale for its treatment recommendations, and the subsequent change in clinical practice. In particular, we focus on the initial drug management of adults without conditions such as diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease that would in themselves be a key determinant of management.", 
    "109": "The present study investigated the effects of dopamine on chloride transport across cultured rat caudal epididymal epithelium. The results showed that dopamine induced a biphasic short-circuit current (Isc) in a concentration-dependent manner. The dopamine-induced response consisted of an initial rapid spike followed by a sustained phase. The alpha and beta adrenoreceptor inhibitors, phentolamine and propranolol, inhibited the initial spike and the sustained phase, respectively, suggesting a contribution of adrenergic receptors. The response was almost abolished by removing the extracellular Cl-, suggesting that the dopamine-induced short-circuit current is primarily a Cl- current. The response was inhibited by the apical Cl- channel blocker, diphenylamine-dicarboxylic acid, and the Ca2+-activated Cl- channel blocker, disulfonic acid stilbene, indicating that Cl- may pass through two types of Cl- channels on the apical side. Preloading monolayers with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA/AM abolished the initial spike and greatly reduced the second phase in the Isc response to dopamine. Pretreating the monolayers with an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, MDL12330A, inhibited all of the second Isc response and part of the initial spike. Also, characteristics of the Cl- currents induced by dopamine were observed in whole-cell patch-clamp recording. The increases of intracellular cAMP and Ca2+ induced by dopamine were also measured. The results suggest that extracellular dopamine activates Ca2+-dependent and cAMP-dependent regulatory pathways, leading to activation of both Ca2+-dependent and cAMP-dependent Cl- conductances in epididymal epithelial cells.",

    "111": "Glucose induces many changes in the transcriptional pattern of beta-cells derived from the endocrine pancreas. The zinc finger protein Egr-1 belongs to the transcription factors that are activated in glucose-treated beta-cells. Egr-1 expression is additionally induced by treatment of MIN6 pancreatic beta-cells with tolbutamide, a compound that triggers a closure of ATP-dependent potassium channels, K(ATP), in the plasma membrane or by KCl that depolarizes the cell membrane. Stimulation with glucose, tolbutamide or KCl induces a Ca2+ influx into the beta-cells via L-type Ca2+ channels. Accordingly, incubation of the cells with the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine or the acetoxymethylester of the cytosolic Ca2+ chelator BAPTA prevented Egr-1 expression. Moreover, diacylgycerol-dependent protein kinase C isoenzymes and activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) are required for glucose-, tolbutamide- and KCl-induced Egr-1 expression. The signaling cascade was blocked by MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) overexpression that dephosphorylated ERK in the nucleus. Stimulation of beta-cells by glucose, tolbutamide and KCl induced the phosphorylation of the transcription factors Elk-1 and CREB. ChIP experiments revealed that phosphorylated Elk-1 and CREB bound under physiological conditions to the Egr-1 gene. Lentiviral-mediated expression of dominant-negative mutants of Elk-1 or CREB interfered with glucose-, tolbutamide- and KCl-induced upregulation of Egr-1 biosynthesis. Together, these data indicate that stimulus-induced transcription of the Egr-1 gene in beta-cells requires combinatorial regulation by Elk-1 and CREB following activation of ERK. The newly synthesized Egr-1 is biologically active and binds under physiological conditions to the genes encoding basic fibroblast growth factor, tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta and PTEN.",

In the developed method, seven sample sets, each consisting of three samples, were sequentially injected into the capillary and analyzed within a single run. This enabled a total of twenty-one sequential injections, i.e., six standards and fifteen samples, containing salbutamol and the injection marker oxprenolol. The injected sample plugs were separated by plugs of background electrolyte, through application of a short-term voltage (30kV) over the capillary for different time periods, i.e., t(PE1) and t(PE2). The samples in each set were isolated from each other by partial electrophoresis for 2.35min (t(PE1)), while the sample sets were separated for 10.50min (t(PE2)). After the final injection, all the applied samples were subjected to electrophoresis for a time period corresponding to that in conventional single-injection CZE. The method was validated regarding linearity, accuracy, precision and robustness before it was applied to the determination of salbutamol in 15 tablets of Ventoline Depot with a labeled content of 8mg salbutamol.

    "113": "We have previously demonstrated that a G1/S-phase cell cycle blocker, deferoxamine (DFO), increased the number of new neurons from rat neurosphere cultures, which correlated with prolonged expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p27(kip1) [H. J. Kim et al. (2006)Brain Research, 1092, 1-15]. The present study focuses on neuronal differentiation mechanisms following treatment of neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) with a G1/S-phase cell cycle blocker. The addition of DFO (0.5 mm) or aphidicolin (Aph) (1.5 microm) to neurospheres for 8 h, followed by 3 days of differentiation, resulted in an increased number of neurons and neurite outgrowth. DFO induced enhanced expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and cdk5 at 24 h after differentiation, whereas Aph only increased TGF-beta1 expression. DFO-induced neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth were attenuated by administration of a cdk5 inhibitor, roscovitine, suggesting that the neurogenic mechanisms differ between DFO and Aph. TGF-beta1 (10 ng/mL) did not increase neurite outgrowth but rather the number of beta-tubulin III-positive cells, which was accompanied by enhanced p27(kip1) mRNA expression. In addition, TGF-beta receptor type II expression was observed in nestin-positive NPCs. Results indicated that DFO-induced TGF-beta1 signaling activated smad3 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In contrast, TGF-beta1 signaling inhibition, via a TGF-beta receptor type I inhibitor (SB-505124), resulted in decreased DFO-induced neurogenesis, in conjunction with decreased p27(kip1) protein expression and smad3 translocation to the nucleus. These results suggest that cell cycle arrest during G1/S-phase induces TGF-beta1 expression. This, in turn, prompts enhanced neuronal differentiation via smad3 translocation to the nucleus and subsequent p27(kip1) activation in NPCs.", 
    "114": "In the last decades new pharmacodynamic properties of beta-adrenoceptors have been discovered that could greatly impact in the use of beta-adrenergic agents in the clinical practice. Concepts such as multiple binding sites, constitutive activity, polymorphism and intracellular signaling of betaadrenoceptors may contribute in the discovery of more efficacious pharmacological agents for treatment of heart failure and asthma. beta-Adrenoceptors show a relative high constitutive activity in both cardiac and pulmonar tissues. Most beta-blockers exert an inverse agonist action that could contribute to their beneficial effects in the treatment of heart failure. Recently, the existence of multiple affinity sites has been described for beta1-adrenoceptor. It was proposed that beta-blockers that show agonist properties at the beta1L-adrenoceptors binding site may exert neutral or harmful effects when used for treatment of heart failure. Considering the cardiac effect of beta1L-adrenoceptors, activation of the low-affinity state of beta1-adrenoceptor could be deleterous in cardiovascular pharmacology. The ability of beta2-adrenoceptor to couple to Gs or Gi-protein gives the possibility that different agonists can activate different signaling cascades. Full beta2-adrenoceptor agonists would be highly useful for improvement bronchodilatation in the acute treatment of asthma. Polymorphic variants of beta-adrenoceptors have profound impact in the understanding of normal physiology and pathophysiology. Genotypic characterization of patients could improve selection of patients during beta-adrenergic pharmacotherapies. The aim of the present review is to describe new insights in pharmacological and biochemical properties of beta-adrenoceptors and their impact on the use of beta-adrenergic agents in the treatment of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.",

Although cardiac myosin is a dominant autoantigen in animal models of myocarditis and is released from the heart during viral myocarditis, the characterization, role and significance of anti-cardiac myosin autoantibodies is poorly defined. In our study, we define the human cardiac myosin epitopes in human myocarditis and cardiomyopathies and establish a mechanism to explain how anti-cardiac myosin autoantibodies may contribute to heart disease. We show that autoantibodies to cardiac myosin in sera from myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathies in humans targeted primarily epitopes in the S2 hinge region of cardiac myosin. In addition, anti-cardiac myosin antibodies in sera or purified IgG from myocarditis and cardiomyopathy targeted the beta-adrenergic receptor and induced antibody-mediated cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) cell signaling activity in heart cells. Antibody-mediated PKA activity in sera was abrogated by absorption with anti-human IgG. Antibody-mediated cell signaling of PKA was blocked by antigen-specific inhibition by human cardiac myosin or the beta-adrenergic receptor but not the alpha adrenergic receptor or bovine serum albumin. Propranolol, a beta blocker and inhibitor of the beta-adrenergic receptor pathway also blocked the antibody-mediated signaling of the beta-adrenergic receptor and PKA. The data suggest that IgG antibody against human cardiac myosin reacts with the beta-adrenergic receptor and triggers PKA signaling in heart cells. In summary, we have identified a new class of crossreactive autoantibodies against human cardiac myosin and the beta-adrenergic receptor in the heart. In addition, we have defined disease specific peptide epitopes in the human cardiac myosin rod S2 region in human myocarditis and cardiomyopathy as well as a mechanistic role of autoantibody in the pathogenesis of disease.",

Eleven subjects acutely withdrawing from cocaine were tested in this pilot study on tasks of cognitive flexibility as well as word fluency, attention, verbal memory, and spatial memory, off and on propranolol in a double-blinded manner. Propranolol significantly benefited certain aspects of cognitive flexibility in acute cocaine withdrawal, and improved some measures of verbal fluency and verbal recall.

Sorbents of this type were obtained by the chemical modification of silica gels of various porosities by cholesterol ligands. The cholesterol-based packing material was investigated by spectroscopic methods and elemental analysis. The recoveries obtained with the extraction procedure were optimum over a relatively broad sample pH range (3.08-7.50). Analytical factors such as the sample loading, the washing step and elution conditions, the concentration of beta-receptor antagonists to be extracted, and the type of sorbent were found to play significant roles in the sample preparation procedure and would therefore need to be controlled to achieve optimum recoveries of the analytes. Under optimum conditions, the recoveries of nadolol, acebutolol, esmolol, oxprenolol and propranolol from spiked buffers, blood and urine were reproducible and dependent on the polarity or hydrophilicity of the compounds. The above analytes were determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV and ESI-ion trap mass spectrometry (MS) detection. The described method was found to be suitable for the routine measurement of compounds that are both polar and basic, and can be applied for the analysis of biological samples such as urine and blood in clinical, toxicological or forensic laboratories.

Previous studies have shown that chronic administration of clenbuterol affects cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. However, the acute effects of clenbuterol and the signaling pathway involved remain undefined. We investigated the acute effects of clenbuterol on isolated ventricular myocyte sarcomere shortening, Ca2+ transients, and L-type Ca2+ current and compared these effects to two other clinically used beta2-AR agonists: fenoterol and salbutamol. Clenbuterol (30 microM) produced a negative inotropic response, whereas fenoterol showed a positive inotropic response. Salbutamol had no significant effects. Clenbuterol reduced Ca2+ transient amplitude and L-type Ca2+ current. Selective beta1-AR blockade did not affect the action of clenbuterol on sarcomere shortening but significantly reduced contractility in the presence of fenoterol and salbutamol (P < 0.05). Incubation with 2 microg/ml pertussis toxin significantly reduced the negative inotropic effects of 30 microM clenbuterol. In addition, overexpression of inhibitory G protein (Gi) by adenoviral transfection induced a stronger clenbuterol-mediated negative inotropic effect, suggesting the involvement of the Gi protein. We conclude that clenbuterol does not increase and, at high concentrations, significantly depresses contractility of isolated ventricular myocytes, an effect not seen with fenoterol or salbutamol. In its negative inotropism, clenbuterol predominantly acts through Gi, and the consequent downstream signaling pathways activation may explain the beneficial effects observed during chronic administration of clenbuterol in patients treated with LVADs.",

Even if adequate ecotoxicity data are not available, it is of primary importance to get informations about their fate in environmental waters, particularly about their photofate in sewage treatment plant effluents (STP). The main difficulties when studying pharmaceutical photochemical behaviour in environmental waters, are linked to the very low environmentally relevant concentrations (ng L(-1) to microg L(-1)) which can generate problems in terms of analytical sensitivity. Moreover, the complexity of environmental matrices can modify micropollutants degradation kinetics. The photodegradation of beta-blockers has been compared at two concentration levels (10 microg L(-1) and 10 mg L(-1)) and in two different matrices (pure water and STP effluent). It has been shown that the concentration does not influence beta-blockers degradation pathways, thus allowing the identification of degradation compounds using the 10 mg L(-1) solutions. Although environmental waters speed up the degradation process, the same photoproducts were appeared in both matrices. Using LC-MS/MS, hydroxyl radical additions have been identified as an important degradation pathway for especially pindolol, propranolol and timolol, leading to several positional isomers, corresponding to mono-, di- or tri-hydroxylations. Kinetics of appearance/disappearance of these photoproducts have been studied in STP effluents.",

The impact of 2 functional polymorphisms (beta1-Arg389Gly and beta1-Ser49Gly) on HF susceptibility, arrhythmogenesis, and prognosis was evaluated in Brazilian outpatients. Genotyping at codons 389 and 49 was performed using polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 201 outpatients with systolic HF and 141 apparently healthy controls. Enrolled patients were followed up at the HF clinic, and vital status was evaluated using electronic hospital records, telephone contact, and a local death certificate database. Allele frequencies were similar between patients with HF and controls, with neither polymorphism related to HF susceptibility. The beta1-389Gly homozygotes had significantly less nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitoring (17% vs 48% for Arg/Arg patients; p = 0.015) and improved HF-related survival, with no events after a median follow-up of 40 months (log-rank statistics = 0.025). The negative impact of beta1-389Arg allele on HF-related survival was substantially reduced using high-dose beta-blocker therapy (80% survival for high-dose vs 42% for low-dose beta blockers or nonusers; log-rank statistics = 0.0003). The beta1-Ser49Gly polymorphism was not associated with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia or HF prognosis. In conclusion, beta1-Arg389Gly and beta1-Ser49Gly polymorphisms had no influence on HF susceptibility. However, the Gly389 allele was associated with a lower prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias and better HF-related survival. A pharmacogenetic interaction is suggested because beta blockers were more effective in beta1-389Arg allele carriers.",

HR at rest and at peak exercise was retrospectively examined in 1,097 consecutive patients with AF referred for exercise myocardial perfusion imaging. In a subgroup of 195 patients, HR was also measured at an intermediate \"moderate\" level. Median HR at rest was 80 beats/min, at the upper end of the recommended range of 60 to 80.

Only patients administered a BB had significantly reduced HRs (p <0.003) at moderate exercise. Median peak exercise HR was 147 beats/min. Forty-five percent of patients exceeded their age-predicted maximal HR. Patients administered BBs were significantly less likely (p <0.01) to exceed their age-predicted maximal HR.

Animal models have shown that interference with the reconsolidation of drug-cue memories can reduce seeking of drugs or drug-paired stimuli. One such model is conditioned place preference (CPP) in which an animal is trained to associate a particular environment with the rewarding effects of a drug. Previous work from this laboratory has shown that intra-nucleus accumbens core infusions of a MEK inhibitor can interfere with reconsolidation of these drug-cue memories. A question that remains is whether post-retrieval drug effects on subsequent memories represent an interference with reconsolidation processes or rather a facilitation of extinction. In this experiment, we explore the effect of post-retrieval injections of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, on reconsolidation and extinction of cocaine CPP. After acquisition of cocaine CPP, animals were given post-retrieval propranolol injections once or each day during a protocol of unreinforced preference tests, until the animals showed no preference for the previously cocaine-paired environment. Following a cocaine priming injection, the animals that received daily post-test propranolol injections did not reinstate their preference for the drug-paired side. In contrast, a single post-retrieval propranolol injection followed by multiple days of unreinforced preference tests failed to blunt subsequent cocaine reinstatement of the memory. These data suggest that daily post-retrieval systemic injections of propranolol decrease the conditioned preference by interfering with reconsolidation of the memory for the association between the drug-paired side and the reinforcing effects of the drug, rather than facilitating new extinction learning.",

    "171": "In this study, we have addressed the role of H(2)S in modulating neutrophil migration in either innate (LPS-challenged naive mice) or adaptive (methylated BSA (mBSA)-challenged immunized mice) immune responses. Treatment of mice with H(2)S synthesis inhibitors, dl-propargylglycine (PAG) or beta-cyanoalanine, reduced neutrophil migration induced by LPS or methylated BSA (mBSA) into the peritoneal cavity and by mBSA into the femur/tibial joint of immunized mice. This effect was associated with decreased leukocyte rolling, adhesion, and P-selectin and ICAM-1 expression on endothelium. Predictably, treatment of animals with the H(2)S donors, NaHS or Lawesson's reagent, enhanced these parameters. Moreover, the NaHS enhancement of neutrophil migration was not observed in ICAM-1-deficient mice. Neither PAG nor NaHS treatment changed LPS-induced CD18 expression on neutrophils, nor did the LPS- and mBSA-induced release of neutrophil chemoattractant mediators TNF-alpha, keratinocyte-derived chemokine, and LTB(4). Furthermore, in vitro MIP-2-induced neutrophil chemotaxis was inhibited by PAG and enhanced by NaHS treatments. Accordingly, MIP-2-induced CXCR2 internalization was enhanced by PAG and inhibited by NaHS treatments. Moreover, NaHS prevented MIP-2-induced CXCR2 desensitization. The PAG and NaHS effects correlated, respectively, with the enhancement and inhibition of MIP-2-induced G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 expression. The effects of NaHS on neutrophil migration both in vivo and in vitro, together with CXCR2 internalization and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 expression were prevented by the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)(+)) channel blocker, glybenclamide. Conversely, diazoxide, a K(ATP)(+) channel opener, increased neutrophil migration in vivo. Together, our data suggest that during the inflammatory response, H(2)S augments neutrophil adhesion and locomotion, by a mechanism dependent on K(ATP)(+) channels.",

    "174": "Baseline NT-proBNP and the failure to decrease oxLDL, IFN-gamma and prolactin are associated with poor outcome in PPCM, suggesting a potential role of these factors in the pathophysiology of PPCM and for risk stratification of PPCM patients.", 
    "175": "The noradrenergic system modulates performance on tasks dependent on semantic and associative network flexibility (NF) in individuals without neurodevelopmental diagnoses in experiments using a beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. Some studies suggest drugs decreasing noradrenergic activity are beneficial in ASD. In individuals without neurodevelopmental diagnoses, propranolol is beneficial only for difficult NF-dependent problems. However, in populations with altered noradrenergic regulation, propranolol also benefits performance for simple problems. Due to decreased flexibility of access to networks in ASD, we wished to examine the effect of propranolol on NF in ASD. ASD subjects benefited from propranolol on simple anagrams, whereas control subjects were impaired by propranolol. Further study will be necessary to confirm this finding in a larger sample and to compare clinical response with cognitive response to propranolol.", 
    "176": "Both pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation during intermittent positive-pressure ventilation predict preload responsiveness. However, because ventilatory and cardiac frequencies are not the same, increasing the number of breaths sampled may increase calculated pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation because larger (max) and smaller (min) pulse pressure and stroke volume may occur. Tidal volume and contractility may also alter pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation. We hypothesized that the magnitude of pulse pressure variation would increase with sampling duration, and that both tidal volume and contractility would independently alter pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation.", 
    "177": "In seven pentobarbital-anesthetized intact dogs arterial and left ventricular pressure (Millar) and left ventricular volume (Leycom) were measured over 8 intermittent positive-pressure ventilation breaths at tidal volume of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mL/kg (f = 20/min, 40% inspiratory time) under baseline, esmolol (2 mg/min), dobutamine infusions (5 microg/kg/min) and following volume loading (500 mL NaCl). Stroke volume variation was calculated using pulse contour method (PiCCO, Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) averaged over 12 secs. Pulse pressure variation was calculated as 100 x (PPmax - PPmin)/PPmean and calculated over 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 breaths.", 
    "178": "Pulse pressure variation increased progressively with increasing sampling duration up to but not exceeding five breaths. The effect on sampling duration was increased by greater tidal volume. Esmolol infusion decreased both pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation as compared with baseline (p < 0.05) at all tidal volume levels. However, dobutamine did not alter either pulse pressure variation or stroke volume variation.", 
    "179": "Sampling duration, tidal volume, and beta-adrenergic blockade differentially alters pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation during intermittent positive-pressure ventilation. Thus, separate validation is required to define threshold pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation values used to drive resuscitation algorithms.", 
    "180": "We evaluated the effect of carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker with vasodilating action, on coronary flow reserve (CFR) in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).", 
    "181": "Twenty-four patients (17 males, 7 females; mean age 57+/-11 years) with IDC were consecutively enrolled. After obtaining clinical and hemodynamic stabilization, transthoracic echocardiography was performed including CFR measurement and carvedilol therapy was initiated with 3.125 mg twice daily and titrated to a target dose of 25 mg twice daily. Twenty-three patients reached the target dose in a mean of 11+/-3 weeks. The mean duration of carvedilol therapy was 19+/-3 weeks, after which echocardiography was repeated and findings were recorded at baseline and after dipyridamole infusion. Clinical and echocardiographic findings were compared with those of 23 age- and sex-matched patients (13 males, 10 females; mean age 55+/-4 years) with atypical chest pain.", 
    "182": "Compared to the control group, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, left ventricular mass index, and isovolumic relaxation time were significantly higher and ejection fraction was significantly lower in the IDC group. Before carvedilol therapy, patients with IDC had a significantly higher baseline diastolic peak flow velocity (DPFV) and a significantly lower CFR; however, hyperemic DPFV was similar in the two groups. After carvedilol therapy, left ventricular end-systolic volume decreased significantly and ejection fraction increased significantly. Decreases in baseline DPFV and hyperemic DPFV were slight and there was no improvement in CFR. Even after elimination of the confounding effect of rate-pressure product using analysis of covariance, pre- and post-treatment CFR remained similar.", 
    "183": "Carvedilol therapy does not improve coronary microvascular functions in patients with IDC.", 
    "184": "Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is still measured in rats by the tail-cuff method, allowing readings when pulse/flow disappears during cuff inflation and reappears during deflation, separated by a compression interval. Although cuff deflation is habitually used to estimate SBP, we found cuff deflation-cuff inflation pressure to be usually negative, indicating that cuff deflation pressure < cuff inflation pressure.", 
    "185": "SBP was measured in 226 male Wistar and SHR utilizing compression intervals of different durations, and also pharmacological interventions intended to modulate the cuff deflation-cuff inflation cycle. Direct, simultaneous intravascular measurements were also performed in some animals.", 
    "186": "With compression interval congruent with 15 s, cuff deflation-cuff inflation was--6 +/- 0.6 mmHg in 73 Wistar and--6 +/- 1.4 mmHg in 51 SHR. Lengthening compression interval up to 4 min increased cuff deflation-cuff inflation pressure significantly to--27 +/- 3 mmHg in Wistar and to - 31 +/- 5 mmHg in SHR, suggesting accumulation of a vasodilating mediator. This increase of cuff deflation-cuff inflation pressure was prevented by papaverine (totally in Wistar, partially in SHR), indicating its dependence on vasodilatory capacity. Adrenergic blockade decreased cuff deflation-cuff inflation pressure to--13 +/- 5 mmHg (P < 0.05) in SHR, but had no effect in Wistar rats. Injection of L-NAME decreased cuff deflation-cuff inflation pressure to--5 +/- 2 mmHg (P < 0.05) in Wistar rats but was ineffective in SHR. Simultaneous measurements by tail-cuff method and carotid cannulation revealed that the cuff inflation most accurately estimated the intravascular SBP.", 
    "187": "1) Cuff inflation measurements should be considered representative of SBP, as cuff deflation can underestimate SBP depending on compression interval duration, 2) nitric oxide accumulation due to flow deprivation is the main cause of SBP underestimation by cuff deflation in Wistar, and 3) in SHR, nitric oxide effects were minimal, and sympathetic activation plus physical factors seemed to predominate in the determining the outcome of measurements.", 
    "188": "We search for pair production of supersymmetric top quarks (t over1), followed by R-parity violating decay t over1-->taub with a branching ratio beta, using 322 pb(-1) of pp over collisions at sqrt s=1.96 TeV collected by the upgraded Collider Detector at Fermilab. Two candidate events pass our final selection criteria, consistent with the standard model expectation. We set upper limits on the cross section sigma(t over1t over1) x beta2 as a function of the top-squark mass m(t over1). Assuming beta=1, we set a 95% confidence level limit m(t over1)>153 GeV/c2. The limits are also applicable to the case of a third-generation scalar leptoquark (LQ3) decaying LQ3-->taub."
