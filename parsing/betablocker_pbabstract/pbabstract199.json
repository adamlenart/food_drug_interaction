Patients treated with amitriptyline (20 and 40 mg), pizotifen (1 mg), propranolol (80-160 mg), atenolol (50-100 mg), verapamil (160-240 mg), valproate (600 mg) and gabapentin (900-1200 mg) were evaluated after a period of 3 and 6 months. In particular, 89 patients were assessed (78% female, 22% male) at 6 months, of whom 10 were in treatment with amitriptyline 20 mg, 19 with amitriptyline 40 mg, 7 with pizotifen (1 mg), 13 with propranolol (80-160 mg), 4 with verapamil (160 mg), 10 with valproate (600 mg), 15 with atenolol (50 mg) and 11 with gabapentin (900-1200 mg). The control group consisted of 97 patients with migraine (79% female, 21% male; mean age 35+/-16 years) without indication for prophylactic therapy. Weight variations >or=1 kg were considered. After 6 months of therapy, the percentage of patients with weight gain was 86% with pizotifen (6/7; mean weight increase 4.4+/-2.5 kg), 60% with amitriptyline 20 mg (6/10; 3.1+/-1.6), 47% with amitriptyline 40 mg (9/19; 5.4+/-2.7), 25% with valproate 600 mg (2/8, 3.0+/-2.8 kg), 25% with verapamil (1/4, 2.5 kg), 20% with atenolol (3/15, 1.7+/-0.6 kg), 9% with gabapentin (1/11, 1.5 kg) and 8% with propranolol (1/13; 6 kg). We conclude that propranolol, gabapentin, atenolol, verapamil and valproate affect body weight in a modest percentage of patients at 6 months. A greater mean weight gain at 6 months was found in patients treated with pizotifen, amitriptyline, and, in one patient out of 13, with propranolol.", 
    "1": "Conventional spectral analyses of heart rate variability (HRV) have been limited to stationary signals and have not allowed the obtainment of information during transient autonomic cardiac responses. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) method to detect transient changes in vagal effects on the heart. We derived high-frequency power (HFP, 0.20-0.40 Hz) as a function of time during active orthostatic task (AOT) from the sitting to standing posture before and after selective vagal (atropine sulfate 0.04 mg/kg) and sympathetic (metoprolol 0.20 mg/kg) blockades. The HFP minimum point during the first 30 s after standing up was calculated and compared with sitting and standing values. Reactivity scores describing the fast and slow HFP responses to AOT were calculated by subtracting the minimum and standing values from the sitting value, respectively. The present results, obtained without controlled respiration, showed that in the drug-free condition, HFP decreased immediately after standing up (P < 0.001) and then gradually increased toward the level characteristic for the standing posture (P < 0.001), remaining lower than in the sitting baseline posture (P < 0.001). The magnitudes of the fast and slow HFP responses to AOT were abolished by the vagal blockade (P < 0.001) and unaffected by the sympathetic blockade. These findings indicate that HFP derived by the STFT method provided a tool for monitoring the magnitude and time course of transient changes in vagal effects on the heart without the need to interfere with normal control by using blocking drugs.",

Rat ileum was stripped of its serosa and mounted inside an Ussing Chamber. Apparent permeability coefficients (P(app)) of the markers from the mucosal to serosal side of the tissue were determined at 37 degrees C in the presence and absence of the beta-cyclodextrins on the mucosal side.

    "23": "The difference in adsorption behavior between a conventional monomeric endcapped C18 stationary phase (3.43 micromol/m2) and an endcapped polymeric RP-Amide phase (3.31 micromol/m2) was investigated. The adsorption isotherms of four compounds (phenol, caffeine, sodium 2-naphthalene sulfonate, and propranololium chloride) were measured by frontal analysis (FA) and the degree of heterogeneity of each phase for each solute was characterized by their adsorption energy distributions (AED), derived using the Expectation-Maximization method. The results show that only certain analytes (phenol and 2-naphthalene sulfonate) are sensitive to the presence of the polar embedded amide groups within the RP phase. Their binding constants on the amide-bonded phase are significantly higher than on conventional RPLC phases. Furthermore, an additional type of adsorption sites was observed for these two compounds. However, these sites having a low density, their presence does not affect much the retention factors of the two analytes. On the other hand, the adsorption behavior of the other two analytes (caffeine and propranololium chloride) is almost unaffected by the presence of the amide group in the bonded layer. Strong selective interactions may explain these observations. For example, hydrogen-bond interactions between an analyte (e.g., phenol or naphthalene sulfonate) and the carbonyl group (acceptor) or the nitrogen (donor) of the amido-embedded group may take place. No such interactions may take place with either caffeine or the cation propranololium chloride. This study confirms the hypothesis that analytes have ready access to locations deep inside the bonded layer, where the amide groups are present.",

A combination of amlodipine and perindopril effectively lowered the blood pressure, and significantly reduced overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events and stroke risk in comparison with atenolol/bendroflumethiazide. In combination with both ACE inhibitors and AT1 blockers, diuretics reduced blood pressure more effectively that the respective components used alone. Now, however, the long-term use of diuretics is suspected of increasing the risk of terminal kidney failure and diabetes. This also means an enhanced probability of a cardiovascular event. In the ASCOT study, the combination of beta blocker and diuretic proved inferior to treatment with a calcium antagonist and ACE inhibitor.

However, it is not known whether this is the case for patients with compensated HF receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenoreceptor blockers. Therefore, we determined the hemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses to 1 wk of a low-sodium diet (70 mmol/day) and 1 wk of a high-sodium diet (250 mmol/day) in 12 HF patients and 12 age-matched controls in a randomized, balanced fashion. During steady-state conditions, hemodynamic and neuroendocrine examinations were performed at rest and during bicycle exercise. In seated HF patients, high sodium intake increased body weight (1.6 +/- 0.4%), plasma volume (9 +/- 2%), cardiac index (14 +/- 6%), and stroke volume index (21 +/- 5%), whereas mean arterial pressure was unchanged. Therefore, the total peripheral resistance decreased by 10 +/- 4%. Similar hemodynamic changes were observed during an incremental bicycle exercise test. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and norepinephrine were suppressed, whereas plasma pro-B-type natriuretic peptide remained unchanged. In conclusion, high sodium intake was tolerated without any excessive sodium and water retention in medically treated patients with compensated HF. The observation that high sodium intake improves cardiac performance, induces peripheral vasodilatation, and suppresses the release of vasoconstrictor hormones does not support the advice for HF patients to restrict dietary sodium.", 
    "45": "Hypertension is a common disorder associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, in the US only about one-third of those who are aware of their hypertensive status have their blood pressure adequately controlled. One reason for this is the variable and unpredictable response individuals have to pharmacologic treatment. Clinicians often resort to \"trial-and-error\" to match patients with effective drug treatment. Hypertension pharmacogenetics seeks to find genetic predictors of drug response. To date, more than forty studies have investigated associations between genetic polymorphisms and response to antihypertensive drugs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers have been most frequently studied, followed by angiotensin II blockers, diuretics, adrenergic alpha-agonists, and calcium channel blockers. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system genes have been the most widely studied, with the angiotensin-converting enzyme I/D variant being typed in about one-half of all hypertension pharmacogenetic studies. In total, 160 possible gene polymorphism-drug interactions have been explored, with about one-quarter of these showing that genes predict drug response. However, disparate and conflicting findings have been the rule rather than the exception, and the discovery of clinically relevant antihypertensive drug-response genes remains elusive. While there is a growing enthusiasm that pharmacogenetics of hypertension is important, the translation of pharmacogenetic findings to clinical practice in the future will depend on additional studies to enhance our pharmacogenetics knowledge base, the availability of pharmacogenetic screening tests that are affordable and easy to implement in clinical practice, a cohort of clinicians who are trained to interpret genetic test results, and health care systems that pay for them. Caution regarding the future of hypertension pharmacogenetics is warranted.", 
    "46": "Several groups of investigators have shown that peri-operative goal directed therapy (GDT) may reduce mortality in high-risk surgical patients. GDT usually requires the use of beta-adrenergic agents, however, and these may also carry the risk of cardiac ischemia, especially in patients with ischemic diseases. In this commentary, we will discuss the apparent contradiction between studies showing beneficial effects of GDT in high-risk surgical patients and studies showing the benefit of beta-blockade in high-risk surgery. One of the key differences between both types of studies is that GDT is applied in patients with high risk of postoperative death, excluding patients with cardiac ischemic disease, while studies reporting beneficial effects of beta-blockade have investigated patients with high risk of cardiac ischemia but moderate risk of death related to the surgical procedure itself. It is likely that beta-blockade should be proposed in patients with moderate risk of death, whereas GDT using fluids and inotropic agents should be applied in patients with high risk of peri-operative death. Monitoring central venous oxygen saturation may be useful to individualize therapy, but further studies are required to validate this option.",

Physicians should identify the risks and benefits of each drug or interventional option being considered for the treatment of HF. Inhibition of the neurohormonal axis with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers has significantly improved morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic HF. An aggressive approach targeted at improving hemodynamics and end-organ function is warranted during acute exacerbations or decompensated heart failure. Immediate recognition and management of potentially reversible causes and simultaneous initiation of supportive therapy to augment the cardiac output are key elements to the successful treatment of acute heart failure.", 
    "48": "The evidence that endoscopic band ligation (EBL) has greater efficacy and fewer side effects than endoscopic injection sclerotherapy has renewed interest in endoscopic treatments for portal hypertension. The introduction of multishot band devices, which allow the placement of 5-10 bands at a time, has made the technique much easier to perform, avoiding the use of overtubes and their related complications. EBL sessions are usually repeated at 2 week intervals until varices are obliterated, which is achieved in about 90% of patients after 2-4 sessions. Variceal recurrence is frequent, with 20-75% of patients requiring repeated EBL sessions. According to current evidence, nonselective beta-blockers are the preferred treatment option for prevention of a first variceal bleed, whereas EBL should be reserved for patients with contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers. Nonselective beta-blockers, probably in association with the vasodilator isosorbide mononitrate, and EBL are good treatment options to prevent recurrent variceal rebleeding. The efficacy of EBL might be increased by combining it with beta-blocker therapy. Patients who are intolerant, have contraindications or bled while receiving primary prophylaxis with beta-blockers must be treated with EBL. In the latter situation, EBL should be added to rather than replace beta-blocker therapy. EBL, in combination with vasoactive drugs, is the recommended form of therapy for acute esophageal variceal bleeding; however, endoscopic injection sclerotherapy can be used in the acute setting if EBL is technically difficult.",

It has one chiral center, and, therefore, two optical isomers. It was essential to develop an enantioselective assay to measure each enantiomer in human plasma. However, separation of enantiomers using chiral chromatography usually requires relatively long retention times. This can pose a problem for rapid turnaround of a large number of samples (i.e., clinical studies). In the present study, a simple and sensitive chiral liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of S-(-)- and R-(+)-pindolol in human plasma. To increase throughput, staggered sample injection was employed using a CTC Trio Valve system on a CTC HTS PAL autosampler. The method exhibited good intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision, and was linear over a dynamic range of 250 pg/mL to 250 ng/mL for each pindolol enantiomer. Intra- and inter-day accuracy ranged between 90.0-106% and 91.6-104% for both quality control (QC) samples of S-(-)- and R-(+)-pindolol, respectively. The respective intra- and inter-day precision ranged between 4.24-7.86% and 4.98-10.4%.",

Because of the combined impact of these complications, PHT remains the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Over the years, it has become clear that a decrease in portal pressure is not only protective against the risk of variceal (re)bleeding but is also associated with a lower long-term risk of developing complications and an improved long-term survival. A milestone in therapy was the introduction of non-selective beta-blockers for the prevention of bleeding and rebleeding of gastro-esophageal varices. However, in practice, less than half the patients under beta-blockade are protected from these risks, supporting the overall demand for innovation and expansion of our therapeutic armamentarium. Recent advances in the knowledge of the pathophysiology of cirrhotic PHT have directed future therapy towards the increased intrahepatic vascular resistance, which, in part, is determined by an increased hepatic vascular tone. This increased vasculogenic component provides the rationale for the potential use of therapies aimed at increasing intrahepatic vasorelaxing capacity via gene therapy, liver-selective nitric oxide donors and statines on the one hand, and at antagonizing excessive intrahepatic vasoconstrictor force through the use of endothelin antagonists, angiotensin blockers, alpha(1) adrenergic antagonists or combined alpha(1)- and non-selective beta-blockers or somatostatin analogues on the other. The focus of this review is to give an update on the pathophysiology of PHT in order to elucidate these potential novel strategies subsequently.",

The present study evaluated the economic impact of a modest increase in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, spironolactone and digoxin on CHF hospitalizations. Patients with CHF were identified through the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) database. The efficacy of ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, spironolactone and digoxin in the first year of treatment were retrieved from the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial, a meta-analysis, the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) and the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trial, respectively. Cost of CHF hospitalization was based on the National List of Provincial Costs. Costs of drug treatment were based on the 2002 Alberta Health and Wellness Drug Benefit list. Physician visits for drug titration were also included in the model. A total of 85,679 patients with CHF were identified with a total of 106,130 hospital discharges. A 10% increase in use of ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, spironolactone and digoxin would incur in a total cost due to avoidable hospital admissions of 0.4 million dollars, 1.3 million dollars, 3.7 million dollars and 1.2 million dollars, respectively. Similarly, the costs of drug treatment would be 2.2 million dollars, 1.3 million dollars, 0.3 million dollars and 0.5 million dollars, respectively. An increase in the use of the above medications would save 6.6 million dollars due to avoidable hospital admissions.

The hippocampus, a region primarily responsible for learning and memory, appears to be particularly susceptible to AD-related injury and chronic alcohol abuse. Although certain risk factors for AD are known, it is unclear if alcohol abuse or dependence may contribute to neuropathology in AD. Recent research suggests that low-to-moderate consumption of alcohol may protect against development of AD, while alcohol dependence may increase risk of developing AD. Therefore, the current studies aimed to investigate the effects of exposure to 50 or 100 mM ethanol (EtOH) and withdrawal on hippocampal injury induced by Abeta peptide treatment.",

    "75": "The percentage of post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (ALVD) is now estimated at 10%, and that number is expected to grow as reperfusion procedures increasingly become routine. Since average all-cause mortality risk in these patients is high (up to 27%), definitive diagnostics are recommended to screen all post-MI patients for ALVD, defined as left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the absence of heart failure symptoms. Post-MI management strategies for patients with ALVD target the two routes of progression to heart failure: (1) cardiac remodeling mediated by neurohormonal activation, and (2) continued and recurrent myocardial ischemic events. Clinical trials of neurohormonal antagonists in post-MI ALVD patients have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors attenuate left ventircular remodeling and that beta-blocker therapy reverses remodeling for patients already on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Neurohormonal antagonist therapy is also associated with significant reductions in sudden death in post-MI ALVD patients.", 
    "76": "Patients with high serum immunoglobulin E levels were reported to be protected against sudden death during acute myocardial infarction. The protection mechanism might be attributed to the facilitation of histamine release from sensitized mast cells; however, this remains to be clarified. In this study, we examined the influence of sensitization on ventricular fibrillation (VF) induced by myocardial hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Guinea pigs were actively sensitized by subcutaneous injection of ovalbumin in Bordetella pertussis vaccine. Hearts isolated from non-sensitized and sensitized guinea pigs were subjected to 30-min hypoxia / 30-min reoxygenation using a Langendorff apparatus. The amount of histamine released in the sensitized guinea-pig hearts was elevated, and the duration of VF was found to be reduced. The treatment with a histamine H2-receptor antagonist inhibited the reduction of VF duration. Treatment of the non-sensitized hearts with the histamine H2-receptor agonist resulted in the decrease of VF duration to the same level as that in the sensitized hearts. In conclusion, these results suggest that the risk of sudden death during myocardial H/R may be attenuated in the sensitized hearts and that histamine H2-receptor activation due to the released histamine may be involved in the protective effect.", 
    "77": "Recent clinical trials have explored whether angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or aldosterone blockade should be added to standard angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/beta blocker treatment in heart failure. Both strategies are of some value but it is unclear which strategy should be used first in patients with mild but symptomatic heart failure. The arguments for and against each strategy are discussed. The strongest argument for aldosterone blockade is the consistency in the results of the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) and EPHESUS (Eplerenone Post-acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study) studies, but what is lacking is a trial of aldosterone blockade in patients with mild, symptomatic heart failure as such. The strongest argument for ARBs is that the CHARM (Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity) Added trial result was positive in the precise patient population of interest (mild, symptomatic heart failure). The strength of this argument is diminished by the somewhat different results in Val-HeFT (Valsartan Heart Failure Trial). A third possibility is to use neither an ARB nor an aldosterone blocker and arguments can be marshalled for this position also. Clinicians should now assess these various arguments to select what they believe would be best for their patients.", 
    "78": "Levodopa reportedly inhibits insulin action in skeletal muscle. Here we show that C2C12 myotubes produce levodopa and that insulin-stimulated glucose transport is enhanced when endogenous levodopa is depleted. Exogenous levodopa prevented the stimulation of glucose transport by insulin (P < 0.05) and increased cAMP concentrations (P < 0.05). The decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose transport caused by levodopa was attenuated by propranolol (a beta-adrenergic antagonist) and prevented by NSD-1015 (NSD), an inhibitor of DOPA decarboxylase (DDC; converts levodopa to dopamine). Propranolol and NSD both prevented levodopa-related increases in [cAMP]. However, the effects of levodopa were unlikely to be dependent on the conversion of levodopa to catecholamines because we could detect neither DDC in myotubes nor catecholamines in media after incubation of myotubes with levodopa. The data suggest the possibility of novel autocrine beta-adrenergic action in C2C12 myotubes in which levodopa, produced by myotubes, could have hormone-like effects that impinge on glucose metabolism.",

The study population consisted of 634 consecutive young and middle-aged men (31-65 years) that visited our outpatient clinic. From them, 358 patients had arterial hypertension and 276 were normotensive. Erectile dysfunction was evaluated with the International Index for Erectile Function questionnaire.

Patients with essential hypertension had more severe erectile dysfunction than their normotensive counterparts (chi(2) = 17.1, P < .001). Hypertension duration, hypertension severity, antihypertension medication, and age were positively correlated with erectile dysfunction. The prevalence of erectile dysfunction is higher in patients with essential hypertension compared with normotensive subjects of similar demographic characteristics. Erectile dysfunction is related to age in both groups, whereas duration and severity of hypertension as well as antihypertension drugs affect erectile function of hypertensive patients.

These data are acquired by frontal analysis (FA), modeled, and used for the calculation of the adsorption energy distribution (AED). Four compounds were used, two neutral compounds of different molecular sizes (caffeine and phenol) and two ionizable compounds of opposite charges, 2-naphthalene sulfonate, an anion, and propranololium, a cation. This work was done on a C30-bonded silica stationary phase (Prontosil-C30), using the same aqueous mobile phase (30% methanol, v/v) for all compounds, except that sodium chloride (25 mM) was added to elute the ionizable compounds. All four adsorption isotherms have Langmuirian behavior. The AEDs are tri-modal for phenol, quadri-modal for caffeine. The total saturation capacity of the stationary phase is four-fold lower for caffeine than for phenol, due in part to its larger molecular size. The equilibrium constants on the low-energy sites of types 1 and 2 are eight-fold larger. These two types of sites characterize the heterogeneity of the bonded layer itself. The density of the high-energy sites of types 3 and 4 is higher for caffeine, suggesting that caffeine molecules can be accommodated in some hydrophobic cages into which smaller molecules like phenol cannot. These high-energy types of sites characterize the heterogeneity of the whole stationary phase (silica support included). The ionizable compounds have larger molecules than the neutral ones and, accordingly, a lower relative density of sites of type 2 to sites of type 1. A tri-modal and a quadri-modal energy distributions were observed for the 2-naphthalene sulfonate anion and the propranololium cation, respectively. The fourth types of sites measured and its unusually high equilibrium constant are most probably due to ion-exchange interactions between the non-endcapped ionized silanols and the propranololium ion. No such strong interactions are observed with the anionic compound.",

African Americans suffer from nephrosclerosis more frequently than Caucasians. Nephrosclerosis affecting Caucasians seems to show a less aggressive pattern and could represent early age-related renal sclerosis. The risk of end-stage renal disease is increased when atherosclerotic lesions in large renal arteries coexist.

U937 macrophages were exposed to the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce an inflammatory reaction, which was inhibited by the addition of zilpaterol (LZ). This inhibition was counteracted by addition of the beta(2)-AR antagonist propranolol (LZP). The extracellular proteome of the U937 cells induced by the three treatments were examined by DIGE. PCA was used as an explorative tool to investigate the clustering of the proteome dataset. Using this tool, the dataset obtained from cells treated with LPS and LZP were separated from those obtained from LZ treated cells. PLS-DA, a multivariate data analysis tool that also takes correlations between protein spots and class assignment into account, correctly classified the different extracellular proteomes and showed that many proteins were differentially expressed between the proteome of inflamed cells (LPS and LZP) and cells in which the inflammatory response was inhibited (LZ). The Student's t-test revealed 8 potential protein biomarkers, each of which was expressed at a similar level in the LPS and LZP treated cells, but differently expressed in the LZ treated cells. Two of the identified proteins, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1beta) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) are known secreted proteins. The inhibition of MIP-1beta by zilpaterol and the involvement of the beta(2)-AR and cAMP were confirmed using a specific immunoassay.",

Calcium channel blockers also cause gingival overgrowth or intensify it. Tacrolimus is a new inhibitor of calcineurine used as an alternative to cyclosporine A. 124 patients were treated with cyclosporine A, and 38 patients were given tacrolimus. At the same time, patients were given calcium channel blockers. Impact of age, sex, calcineurine inhibitors dosage, sort of calcium channel blocker used as well as treatment duration on gingival overgrowth were studied. Also, periodontal status: oral cavity hygiene, gingivitis degree as well as extent and level of gingival overgrowth were evaluated. Gingival overgrowth of different degree was present in 58 patients (46.7%) treated with CsA and in none of the patients treated with tacrolimus. Hygiene and inflammation indices were significantly higher in the group of patients with gingival overgrowth as compared to the group without gingival overgrowth treated with CsA. In the group of patients treated with tacrolimus, these indices were the lowest, and the gingivae were sort of shrunk and paler. Patients with risk factors in gingival overgrowth and patients with severe overgrowth should be converted to tacrolimus treatment.",

Forty consecutive patients with bleeding oesophageal varices underwent either injection sclerotherapy only or injection sclerotherapy with an adjuvant fixed daily dose of propranolol (40 mg tds) in a single-blind randomized controlled trial. They were injected on a weekly basis until varices were eradicated at which time propranolol was withdrawn. Patients were then followed-up for a period of two years. The results showed that ad to a decline in resting pulse rate by a median of 23.9%. Patients undergoing injection sclerotherapy with adjuvant propranolol required fewer injection sessions for variceal eradication than patients undergoing injection sclerotherapy alone (8 versus 11: p > 0.05).

    "116": "To clarify the beneficial effects of cilnidipine, an L- and N-type calcium channel blocker, which were clinically observed against diastolic dysfunction in hypertrophied hearts of hypertensive patients, we investigated the effects of cilnidipine on cardiac remodeling and enhanced gene expression in stroke-prone, spontaneously hypertensive rats in comparison with that of captopril, a well-known angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, at threshold doses with little blood pressure lowering effect. The expression of type III collagen and beta/alpha-myosin heavy chain as well as transforming growth factor-beta, and basic fibroblast growth factor were suppressed by both treatments, indicating the prevention or amelioration of cardiac dysfunction. Such beneficial effects were much more intense with cilnidipine treatment than in captopril. These results indicate that Ca2+ is a key factor in the pathogenesis of cardiac remodeling in hypertension. One possible beneficial effect of cilnidipine in the prevention of cardiac dysfunction may be due to the decreased amount of growth factors such as transforming growth factor-beta and basic fibroblast growth factor via direct action for Ca2+ influx and also via inhibition of local renin-angiotensin system in the myocardium.", 
    "117": "Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading cardiovascular health problems in Europe and the United States. Acute decompensated HF remains a lethal diagnosis with a morbidity and mortality that often exceeds neoplastic or infective diseases. The incidence of HF continues to increase despite an intensive effort to increase education and delivery of healthcare to these affected patients. Yet, current guidelines in the United States do not address the management of acute decompensated HF, and focus predominantly on chronic stable systolic HF as well as patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Although the European Society of Cardiology has established some parameters for the management of acute HF, these guidelines are largely established by expert opinion, and are predominantly devoid of prospective randomized data in this cohort of patients. Current pharmacotherapies for acute decompensated HF include diuretics, neurohormonal antagonists, vasodilators, and inotropes. Regrettably, all of these drugs have their limitations in acute HF. Neurohormonal antagonists reduce morbidity and mortality, but may be inadequate to achieve and maintain the necessary hemodynamic relief required in advanced HF; while, bolus diuretics, a mainstay of initial symptomatic relief, may be maladaptive and up-regulate adverse neurohormonal regulatory mechanisms longterm with no positive impact on longterm mortality. Today, for those advanced HF patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal conventional therapy, limited treatments exist; but as newer therapies evolve, the options will expand to include more than palliative care, heart transplant and ventricular assist devices for these patients.", 
    "118": "Heart failure (HF) is a common complication of myocardial infarction (MI) that carries a poor prognosis when present. HF and/or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) occur in approximately 40% of patients who suffer acute MI. The estimated mortality of patients developing HF or LVSD post-MI is 20% to 30%, with that risk varying based on the presence of HF upon initial assessment versus occurring later during the MI hospitalization. Clinical factors and comorbidities associated with post-MI HF include age, diabetes, hypertension, female gender, infarct size, and tachycardia. Factors associated with decreased survival in patients with post-MI HF include Killip class, age, low blood pressure, tachycardia, male gender, and anterior location of MI. Despite extensive data identifying this patient population as high risk, patients with post-MI HF or LVSD are significantly less likely to receive evidence-based medications or revascularization procedures than those without HF. Despite the high prevalence of HF after MI, few studies have examined therapies to prevent it. This review summarizes studies that reported the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of patients with post-MI HF or LVSD. Additionally, we discuss therapies to prevent post-MI HF and treatment of patients with post-MI HF and/or LVSD.",

These guidelines offer evidence-based recommendations and allow a standardized therapeutic approach thereby improving the patient's treatment and reducing the mortality. The optimal care for patients presenting with ST segment elevation myocardial infarctions consists of a prehospital phase where an immediate diagnosis should be reached by means of a twelve-channel ECG followed by basic medical treatment with administration of acetylsalicylic acid, heparin, beta-blocker, and nitrates by an emergency physician. The hospital phase can be optimized by integrated myocardial infarction networks with coronary care units offering primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) and adjuvant medical treatment including the administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. If the onset of symptoms is < 3 h and the transportation time to a coronary care unit > 90 min, the indication of primary fibrinolysis should be given by the emergency physician. If fibrinolysis fails, there is a clear indication for rescue PCI. Even with successful thrombolysis PCI should be performed within 24 h. A dual oral antithrombotic therapy starting immediately after diagnosis with a loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel should be continued with 75 mg/d clopidogrel for 9-12 months on top of 100 mg/d acetylsalicylic acid.",

We studied the effects of the PDE3-selective inhibitor cilostamide (300 nM) and PDE4-selective inhibitor rolipram (1 microM) on the positive inotropic and cyclic AMP-enhancing effects of CGP12177 and noradrenaline in right ventricular strips of rat. 2.--CGP12177 (under (-)-propranolol 200 nM) only increased contractile force in the presence of either cilostamide or rolipram with -logEC(50)M 6.7 (E(max)=23% over basal) and 7.1 (E(max)=50%) respectively. The combination of cilostamide and rolipram caused CGP12177 to enhance contractile force with -logEC(50)M=7.7 and E(max)=178%. 3.--The positive inotropic effects of noradrenaline (-logEC(50)M=6.9) were potentiated by rolipram (-logEC(50)M=7.4) but not by cilostamide (-logEC(50)M=7.0). 4.--In the presence of rolipram and (-)-propranolol, noradrenaline (2 microM) and CGP12177 (10 microM) produced matching inotropic effects but failed to increase cyclic AMP levels. 20 microM (-)-noradrenaline increased cyclic AMP levels, a response further enhanced by rolipram. 5.--Both PDE3 and PDE4 of rat ventricle appear to hydrolyse cyclic AMP generated through the low-affinity beta(1)-adrenoceptor site, thereby preventing inotropic responses of CGP12177. When (-)-noradrenaline interacts with the beta(1)-adrenoceptor, the generated cyclic AMP is hydrolysed only by PDE4, thereby reducing cardiostimulation.", 
    "121": "Activated beta2-adrenoceptors are rapidly desensitized by phosphorylation of Ser262 by protein kinase A (PKA) and of Ser355,356 by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK). We sought to determine whether the phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation of these sites had similar kinetics and requirements for receptor endocytosis. The phosphorylation of the PKA and GRK sites were measured using antibodies that recognize phosphoserine 262 and phosphoserine 355,356. Endocytosis in stably transfected HEK293 cells was blocked by inducible expression of dominant-negative dynamin-1 K44A or by treatment with hypertonic sucrose. The phosphorylation of the GRK site Ser355,356 during a 10 microM isoprenaline treatment rapidly reached a steady state, and the extent of kinetics of phosphorylation were unaffected by dynamin-1 K44A expression, and minimally by hypertonic sucrose. In contrast, phosphorylation of the PKA site Ser262 during a 10 microM isoprenaline treatment peaked after 2 min and then rapidly declined, while inhibition of endocytosis enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation. Treatment with 300 pM isoprenaline, a concentration too low to provoke endocytosis, also resulted in prolonged PKA site phosphorylation. The dephosphorylation of these sites was measured after removal of agonist. Significant dephosphorylation of phosphoserines 262 and 355,356 was observed under conditions of very low endocytosis, however dephosphorylation of the GRK site was greater if antagonist was present after removal of agonist. The results indicate that the kinetics of beta2-adrenoceptor GRK and PKA site phosphorylation are distinct and differently affected by endocytosis, and that receptor dephosphorylation can occur either at the plasma membrane or in internal compartments.",

Evidence is provided that compared with diuretics and beta-blockers, new-onset diabetes is less common with 'new' drugs, and that conventional antihypertensive compounds, particularly when combined together, may amplify the natural time-dependent tendency towards the development of this metabolic disease.

The membrane permeability of isovaleryl-PL was greater than that of PL because it was more lipophilic. Isovaleryl-PL was almost completely hydrolyzed to PL and isovaleric acid (IVA) in epithelial cells at a rate limited by its uptake. Based on pH partitioning, PL and IVA were transported into both vascular (pH 7.4) and luminal sides (pH 6.5). Therefore, when isovaleryl-PL was perfused into the jejunal lumen, more than 90% permeated into the blood vessel as PL. In addition, PL appeared in the lumen at a rate 6-fold greater than that in blood vessels. When isovaleryl-PL was perfused, its disappearance (50.5+/-1.95 nmol/min) was the sum of the absorption and secretion rates of PL. In contrast, IVA was transported into blood vessels rather than the jejunal lumen. In addition, the calculated degradation clearance from in vitro hydrolysis (Km 13.7+/-1.71 microM, Vmax 29.1+/-3.81 nmol/min/mg protein) was 3.42 ml/min/10 cm jejunum, which was 24-fold greater than the observed degradation clearance (CLdeg) (0.14+/-0.02 ml/min/10 cm jejunum).

Because of increasing population age and improved survival after myocardial infarction, the prevalence of heart failure is likely to increase dramatically. Primary care physicians are in an ideal position to care for patients throughout the spectrum of heart failure, from identifying patients at increased risk to managing the final stages of the disease. New understandings of heart failure pathophysiology have led to more effective treatments aimed at blocking neurohormonal pathways. There is still much to be learned about the pathophysiology and treatment of diastolic heart failure, and rapidly expanding knowledge of heart failure is likely to lead to better treatment in the coming years.", 
    "151": "Our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical consequences of atrial fibrillation has led to an evidence-based revolution in the management of atrial fibrillation over the last decade. As we improve in our ability to detect recurrent atrial fibrillation and treat it definitively, the patients who benefit from long-term anticoagulation may change. We can expect, however,that stroke prevention through systemic anticoagulation will be a cornerstone of atrial fibrillation management for decades to come. Innovations in anticoagulation therapy will make the use of these medications safer. Finally, as we further understand the underlying mechanisms of the development of atrial fibrillation, the pursuit of preventative therapy will be an investigational focus of great import.", 
    "152": "Stable angina should first be treated medically, particularly with aspirin and beta-blockers. Diagnostic stress tests are used in patients who have intermediate probability of CHD to further assess the likelihood of disease,with catheterization reserved for patients who have symptoms despite optimal medical therapy or are at risk for multivessel CHD. The work-up for low-risk unstable angina can involve medical management followed by stress testing. Moderate-to-high risk unstable angina and NSTEMI should be treated with an integrated approach, using medical therapy, cardiac catheterization, and revascularization. Patients who have STEMI require urgent reperfusion either with thrombolytic agents or primary angioplasty. Follow-ing a diagnosis of CHD, patients should undergo intense coronary risk-fac-tor modification to reduce the risk of future events.", 
    "153": "Approximately one third of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery have coronary artery disease, and cardiovascular complications are an important cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Several algorithms are available to assess the risk for peri-operative cardiac events. Although preoperative risk assessment is useful in identifying patients at greatest risk for cardiac complications, recent investigations have provided additional guidance in choosing interventions to improve perioperative outcomes. These investigations show that perioperative beta-blockers significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in noncardiac surgery and appear to offer the greatest benefit to high-risk patients. Because of the lower complication rate in intermediate- and low-risk patients and the absence of large randomized controlled trials, the role of beta-blockers in this population is less well-defined.", 
    "154": "We examined the effects of the endocannabinoide-anandamide (AEA), the synthetic cannabinoid, WIN55,212-2, and the active phorbol ester, 4-beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (4-beta-PMA), on the release of [(3)H]d-Aspartate ([(3)H]d-ASP) from rat hippocampal synaptosomes. Release was evoked with three different stimuli: (1) KCl-induced membrane depolarization, which activates voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels and causes limited neurotransmitter exocytosis, presumably from ready-releasable vesicles docked in the active zone; (2) exposure to the Ca(2+) ionophore-A23187, which causes more extensive transmitter release, presumably from intracellular reserve vesicles; and (3) K(+) channel blockade by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), which generates repetitive depolarization that stimulates release from both ready-releasable and reserve vesicles. AEA produced concentration-dependent inhibition of [(3)H]d-ASP release stimulated with 15 mM KCl (E(max)=47.4+/-2.8; EC(50)=0.8 microM) but potentiated the release induced by 4-AP (1mM) (+22.0+/-1.3% at 1 microM) and by A23187 (1 microM) (+98.0+/-5.9% at 1 microM). AEA's enhancement of the [(3)H]d-ASP release induced by the Ca(2+) ionophore was mimicked by 4-beta-PMA, which is known to activate protein kinase C (PKC), and the increases produced by both compounds were completely reversed by synaptosome treatment with staurosporine (1 microM), a potent PKC blocker. In contrast, WIN55,212-2 inhibited the release of [(3)H]d-ASP evoked by KCl (E(max)=47.1+/-2.8; EC(50)=0.9 microM) and that produced by 4-AP (-26.0+/-1.5% at 1 microM) and had no significant effect of the release induced by Ca(2+) ionophore treatment. AEA thus appears to exert a dual effect on hippocampal glutamatergic nerve terminals. It inhibits release from ready-releasable vesicles and potentiates the release observed during high-frequency stimulation, which also involves the reserve vesicles. The latter effect is mediated by PKC. These findings reveal novel effects of AEA on glutamatergic nerve terminals and demonstrate that the effects of endogenous and synthetic cannabinoids are not always identical.", 
    "155": "We examined the effects of carvedilol on cardiac inwardly rectifying K(+) (Kir) channels, i.e., ATP-sensitive (K(ATP)), G-protein-activated (K(G)) and background (I(K1)) Kir channels. We found that carvedilol effectively inhibits K(ATP) and K(G), but not I(K1) channels. Carvedilol inhibits K(ATP) channels reconstituted in HEK293 cells with Kir6.2 lacking the C-terminal 26 amino acids (Kir6.2DeltaC26), suggesting that carvedilol acts in the channel pore. A sequence comparison of the three channels revealed that a cysteine residue, C166, in the inner helix of Kir6.2 is conserved in both Kir6.xs (K(ATP)) and Kir3.xs (K(G)), but not in Kir2.xs (I(K1)). The mutation of this residue (C166A) made Kir6.2DeltaC26 resistant to the drug. Homology modeling and docking simulation suggested that interaction between carvedilol and the pore could be located at the cytosolic portion of the inner helix (bundle-crossing region) containing C166. This study shows that carvedilol blocks specific groups of Kir channels by interacting with the bundle-crossing region.",

As compared with Gly389 carriers, the Arg389 homozygotes had a higher baseline IOP (15.8 mmHg vs. 13.7 mmHg; P = 0.009) and a greater magnitude of response to betaxolol therapy (-3.4 mmHg vs. -1.5 mmHg; P = 0.0009). The Ser49 homozygote genotype was not independently associated with baseline IOP (P = 0.47) or with a response to betaxolol (P = 0.99).

The polymorphism at codon 389 may predict short-term response to betaxolol and may serve as a determinant of response to betaxolol and other adrenergic agents in glaucomatous eyes requiring treatment.",

Cardinal manifestations include proximal aortic aneurysm, dislocation of the ocular lens, and long-bone overgrowth. Important advances have been made in the diagnosis and medical and surgical care of affected individuals, yet substantial morbidity and premature mortality remain associated with this disorder. Progress has been made with genetically defined mouse models to elucidate the pathogenetic sequence that is initiated by fibrillin-1 deficiency. The new understanding is that many aspects of the disease are caused by altered regulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), a family of cytokines that affect cellular performance, highlighting the potential therapeutic application of TGFbeta antagonists. Insights derived from studying this mendelian disorder are anticipated to have relevance for more common and non-syndromic presentations of selected aspects of the Marfan phenotype.", 
    "164": "Anti-glaucoma drugs exhibiting anti-inflammatory properties are desirable for the long-term treatment of glaucoma since they may reduce the risk for treatment-related inflammatory processes in outer compartments of the eye. The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential anti-inflammatory effects of two topically and systemically applied anti-glaucoma drugs i.e. GLC 756, a novel mixed dopamine D2 receptor agonist and D1 receptor antagonist, and timolol a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist using endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) and arthritis in rats as an in vivo model. For EIU, 8-week-old Lewis rats were intravenously injected at 160 microg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Salmonella typhimurium. GLC756, timolol, or betamethasone, as a positive control, were either topically (0.4%, 0.5%, and 0.1%, respectively, 16-times 20 microL eye drops during 48 h) or systemically (1mg/kg subcutaneous for 5 days) administered. Cell infiltration in tissue of the eye and knee joint were assessed histopathologically and in special compartments of the eye by confocal microscopy 48 h after LPS-induction. Numerous infiltrating cells were detected in the eyes after LPS-induction and half of the animals showed arthritis. Topical and systemic pre-treatment with GLC756 and timolol resulted in reduced cell infiltration in the eye. In addition, GLC756 reduced, whereas timolol increased the incidence of arthritis. Betamethasone suppressed almost completely the cell infiltration in the eye and the incidence of arthritis. In conclusion, the observations that GLC756 reduced cell infiltration in the eye and the incidence of arthritis after LPS-induction is compatible with anti-inflammatory properties of this drug. By contrast, timolol produced no consistent anti-inflammatory effect since both inhibitory as well as stimulatory effects on inflammatory processes were seen.", 
    "165": "The effects of perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, atenolol, a beta adrenergic receptor blocker and amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker were investigated in chronic alcohol administered rats. Adult male Wistar rats (240-320 g) were used in the present study. Alcohol was given to rats by a modified liquid diet for 21 days. Perindopril (2.5 and 5 mgkg(-1)), atenolol (5 and 10 mg kg(-1)) and amlodipine (5 and 10 mg kg(-1)) were injected to rats in different groups intraperitoneally for 21 days. Control rats were pair fed by an isocaloric liquid diet containing sucrose as a caloric substitute for alcohol. Saline was injected to control rats for 21 days. Rats were anesthetized with ether. Their hearts were removed and 1 mm3 samples from left ventricles were fixed. Five fields per heart were examined and photographed with transmission electron microscope. Blood alcohol levels were also measured spectrophotometrically. Daily alcohol consumption of the rats was in a range of 12.09-15.5 g kg(-1). Blood alcohol concentrations were found as 145.63 mg dl(-1) at 21st day of alcohol consumption. Chronic alcohol consumption caused some marked myocardial injuries. Perindopril and atenolol but not amlodipine produced some significant beneficial effects on alcohol-induced myocardial damages. Our results imply that perindopril and atenolol but not amlodipine have protective effects on heavy chronic alcohol consumption-induced myocardial injury in rats.", 
    "166": "The possible role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in cardioprotection was investigated in isolated rat ventricular myocytes exposed to severe metabolic inhibition (MI) in glucose-free buffer containing 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DOG), an inhibitor of glycolysis. Pretreatment (30 min) with NaHS (a H2S donor) at concentrations of 10(-5) to 10(-4) mol/L caused a concentration related increase in cell viability and the ratio of rod-shaped cells. A time course study showed that NaHS-induced cardioprotection occurred in 2 time windows (approximately 1 h and 16-28 h). To observe whether endogenous H2S may be involved in the delayed cardioprotection response of IP, DL-propargylglycine (PAG) and beta-cyano-L-alanine (BCA; two inhibitors of H2S biosynthesis) were used. Both drugs significantly attenuated the cardioprotection produced by MI using cell viability, cellular injury index, and electrically-induced [Ca2+]i transients as end-points. These data suggest that endogenous H2S plays an important role in the cardioprotection following MI preconditioning. In an attempt to determine the mechanism of the cardioprotective effect of H2S, we examined the effect of blocking KATP channels with glibenclamide (a non-selective KATP channel blocker), 5-hydroxydecanoic acid (5-HD, a mitochondrial KATP blocker), and HMR-1098 (a sarcolemmal KATP blocker). The cardioprotective effects of NaHS were significantly attenuated by glibenclamide and HMR-1098 treatment but not by 5-HD. Inhibition of NO production with L-NG nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) also attenuated the cardioprotection of NaHS. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence that H2S may protect the heart most probably by activating sarcolemmal KATP channels and/or provoking NO release and the cardioprotective effects of metabolic ischemic preconditioning is, at least partially, mediated by endogenous H2S.",

    "180": "To reach their biological target, drugs have to cross cell membranes, and understanding passive membrane permeation is therefore crucial for rational drug design. Molecular dynamics simulations offer a powerful way of studying permeation at the single molecule level. Starting from a computer model proven to be able to reproduce the physical properties of a biological membrane, the behaviour of small solutes and large drugs in a lipid bilayer has been studied. Analysis of dihedral angles shows that a few nano seconds are sufficient for the simulations to converge towards common values for those angles, even if the starting structures belong to different conformations. Results clearly show that, despite their difference in size, small solutes and large drugs tend to lie parallel to the bilayer normal and that, when moving from water solution into biomembranes, permeants lose degrees of freedom. This explains the experimental observation that partitioning and permeation are highly affected by entropic effects and are size-dependent. Tilted orientations, however, occur when they make possible the formation of hydrogen bonds. This helps to understand the reason why hydrogen bonding possibilities are an important parameter in cruder approaches which predict drug absorption after administration. Interestingly, hydration is found to occur even in the membrane core, which is usually considered an almost hydrophobic region. Simulations suggest the possibility for highly polar compounds like acetic acid to cross biological membranes while hydrated. These simulations prove useful for drug design in rationalising experimental observations and predicting solute behaviour in biomembranes.", 
    "181": "Conventional therapy for intoxication with calcium channel blockers consists of crystalloid solutions, calcium gluconate, glucagon and vasopressor agents. These therapies often fail to improve hemodynamic function in intoxicated patients. The pathophysologic mechanism proposed for intoxication with these agents, suggest hypoinsulinemia as the determinant factor. We will describe the case of a 77 years old man treated for an overdose of nifedipine and atenolol who arrived at our institution with hypotension and bradycardia. After conventional therapy failed to improve the patient's hemodynamic status, hyperinsulinemia and euglycemia contributed to the improvement of the patient's neurologic and hemodynamic condition. Thus, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic therapy was of benefit in this patient with hemodynamic compromise secondary to intoxication with calcium channel blocker not responding to conventional therapy. We will review the mechanism of action of calcium channel blocker drugs as well as the clinical presentation and treatment options for calcium channel blocker intoxication.",

Atrial flutter is most often arising from a macroreentry circuit in the right atrium or around scar tissue in case or previous cardiothoracic surgery. As a macroreentrant tachycardia it is regular and can lead to higher heart rates, especially if occurring with 1:1 conduction. In contrast atrial fibrillation, especially when occurring paroxysmal at the beginning, is arising from triggers within the pulmonary veins. Ablation strategies to electrically isolate those triggers have a treatment success rate of 80%, which is much more than can be achieved with antiarrhythmic medication (success rates 30-50%).

We report three cases of pulmonary edema during preterm labor associated with the use of calcium channel blocker, intravenous nicardipine, widely used for tocolysis in France. In this article, potential mechanisms of this severe complication are briefly discussed: pregnancy-induced overload, deleterious hemodynamic effects of calcium channel blockers, concomitant administration of calcium channel blockers and/or beta-agonists and finally concomitant administration of physiological saline and/or glucocorticoids. Based on our experience, we recommend avoiding the association of calcium channel blockers and beta-agonists for preterm labor. Nicardipine, if used, should be administered at an adjusted dose with electric syringe to reduce volume infusion."
