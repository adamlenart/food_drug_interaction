    "0": "Alternative interventions are available for patients in whom thrombolytic therapy is inappropriate after an acute myocardial infarction. Administration of a beta blocker within the first 24 hours of the patient's admission to the coronary care unit can reduce overall morbidity and mortality within the first 7 days by about 15%. Maintenance therapy with an oral beta blocker can reduce mortality within the succeeding 3 years by about 25%. Esmolol, a unique cardioselective beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocker with a half-life of 9 minutes, can enable some patients with relative contraindications to beta blockers to nevertheless benefit from early beta-blocking therapy. It also is useful in screening patients for subsequent therapy with beta blockers. Those who tolerate the esmolol infusion can be given a long-acting beta blocker. For patients who exhibit intolerance to esmolol, the infusion can be terminated with rapid return to baseline hemodynamics.", 
    "1": "Labetalol (L) was intravenously given to ten patients with an acute elevation of arterial blood pressure above to 200 to 100 mmHg. Blood pressure was controlled in 9 of 10 patients (less than or equal to 170/100 mmHg) with 50 mg in 4, 100 mg in 4 and 200 mg L in 1 patient. In 9 responders, systolic pressure decreased from 207 +/- 20 to 161 +/- 9, diastolic pressure from 107 +/- 11 to 90 +/- 8, and mean pressure from 140 +/- 11 to 113 +/- 5 mmHg, and all pressures remained at these levels during a 25 min control period. Heart rate decreased significantly from 87 +/- 20 to 69 +/- 11 per min and cardiac index from 3.2 +/- 0.8 to 2.6 +/- 0.61/min x m2. Stroke volume index remained unchanged. Total peripheral resistance and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure were not significantly altered but tended to increase, resulting in a small shift to the right of the ventricular function curve. Pulmonary vascular resistance increased significantly from 236 +/- 108 to 314 +/- 132 dyn x sec x cm-5 and mixed venous oxygen saturation decreased from 70 +/- 5 to 65 +/- 8%. Peripheral resistance was considerably higher and cardiac index lower in patients with a heart rate below 70/min. We conclude that L effectively lowers the arterial blood pressure in hypertensive crisis, but the substance should not be used in patients with heart rates below 70/min, as in this case the beta-blocking effect may supervene resulting in a high-resistance low-output state.", 
    "2": "We have investigated the stimulation of phospholipase D activity by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor agonist [D-Ala6, des-Gly10]GnRH N-ethylamide (GnRH-A) in preovulatory, cultured granulosa cells. GnRH-A stimulated up to 10-fold accumulation of phosphatidylethanol, produced by phospholipase D phosphatidyl transferase activity when ethanol acts as the phosphatidyl group acceptor. The effect of GnRH-A was concentration dependent (EC50 = 1 nM) and was inhibited by a specific GnRH receptor antagonist. Low GnRH-A concentrations (less than 10 nM) stimulated also accumulation of phosphatidic acid, but at higher concentrations this response was attenuated. Propranolol, which inhibits phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, increased both basal and GnRH-A-stimulated production of phosphatidic acid. A protein kinase C activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 100 nM), increased up to 30-fold phosphatidylethanol levels. The effects of supramaximal concentrations of GnRH-A (50 nM) and TPA (1 microM) on the accumulation of phosphatidylethanol were additive, suggesting that the two agents may not act via the same mechanism. This is supported by the fact that 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, inhibited the effect of TPA 50%, but not that of GnRH-A. However, 24 h pretreatment with TPA abolished cellular response to subsequent treatment with either TPA or GnRH-A. The stimulatory action of GnRH on steroidogenesis could be mimicked by elevating endogenous phosphatidic acid levels in granulosa cells. Exogenous phospholipase D (from Streptomyces chromofuscus, 10 IU/ml) significantly increased (2.7-fold) progesterone production by the cells; under the same conditions, GnRH-A and FSH stimulated progesterone production 3- and 2.6-fold, respectively. Similarly, propranolol stimulated progesterone production 2.2-fold. These results suggest that, in granulosa cells, GnRH receptors are coupled to a phospholipase D whose activation may participate in transducing the GnRH signal for accelerated steroidogenesis. Phospholipase D activity can be independently regulated also by protein kinase C. The possible interrelationships between phospholipase D and other phospholipases which may be activated by GnRH in these ovarian cells are discussed.", 
    "3": "The antiangina effects of atenolol, 50 to 200 mg once daily, or nifedipine, 10 to 30 mg 3 times daily, were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel study of 39 patients with known symptomatic coronary artery disease. Treatment was titrated to produce at least a 30% increase in treadmill exercise duration over placebo baseline and then maintained at that dosage for an additional 3 weeks. Both treatments produced significant (p less than 0.001) increases in duration of exercise, total work and exercise capacity when compared with placebo baseline. These improvements in exercise performance were obtained with significant (p less than 0.001) reductions in both ST-segment depression and rate-pressure product for atenolol compared with nifedipine. Furthermore, the total angina attack rate and rate at rest were significantly (p less than 0.01) less frequent with atenolol than with nifedipine. Hence, the antiischemic effects of atenolol exceeded those of nifedipine, based on ST-segment depression and rate-pressure product at comparable workloads.", 
    "4": "The effect of CGP-12177, originally developed as a radioligand with antagonist properties for binding studies of beta-adrenergic receptors, was investigated in brown adipose tissue. Contrary to expectations, CGP-12177 showed clear agonist properties in experiments with hamster brown-fat cells, with a maximal effect in stimulating oxygen consumption similar to that of the physiological stimulator noradrenaline, and also with a potency similar to that of noradrenaline [EC50 (50% effective concn.) approx. 70 nM]. This value could be contrasted with the very high affinity of CGP-12177 (KD about 1 nM) for ligand-binding sites on the cells. It is therefore suggested that the high-affinity binding site may not be the one that mediates the CGP-12177-stimulated thermogenesis in isolated cells. Also, when injected into cold-adapted rats, CGP-12177 stimulated non-shivering thermogenesis similarly to noradrenaline. This observation, in conjunction with the reported low general sympathomimetic effect of CGP-12177, may indicate that CGP-12177 could be of interest for the development of anti-obesity drugs.", 
    "5": "To determine the reversibility of the effects of flecainide on accessory pathways, electrophysiologic studies were performed in the drug-free control state, after flecainide loading and with isoproterenol infusion during flecainide treatment in 12 patients with symptomatic preexcitation syndrome. After the baseline drug-free evaluation, oral flecainide was given in dosages of 50 to 200 mg twice daily (mean daily dose 282 +/- 75) for at least 4 days before the repeat electrophysiologic study. Isoproterenol infusion was given in dosages of 1 to 4 micrograms/min to increase the heart rate at rest by 50%. Anterograde block in the accessory pathway was observed in 3 patients with flecainide therapy, whereas in the other patients the anterograde refractory period increased from 243 +/- 20 to 315 +/- 23 ms (p less than 0.05). The shortest preexcited RR interval during atrial fibrillation lengthened from 234 +/- 27 ms before flecainide to 313 +/- 38 ms (p less than 0.05). Retrograde block occurred in 2 patients after flecainide, whereas the retrograde refractory period of the accessory pathway increased from 247 +/- 26 to 337 +/- 45 ms in the other patients. Orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, inducible in 10 patients before therapy, became noninducible in 3 patients. Its rate was significantly slowed in the other 7 patients (from 346 +/- 50 to 471 +/- 81 ms). In 2 patients the tachycardia was nonsustained during flecainide treatment. Atrial fibrillation, inducible in all patients at baseline, was rendered nonsustained and more difficult to induce in 7 patients with flecainide. When isoproterenol was infused during flecainide treatment, complete anterograde (3 patients) or retrograde block (2 patients) persisted in the accessory pathway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "A family with the Romano-Ward syndrome is presented. This family showed typical features of this syndrome with QT prolongation, torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia, sudden death and an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The index case presented with an exacerbation of torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia from diuretic induced hypokalaemia, and responded to diuretic withdrawal and beta blocker therapy.", 
    "7": "Levomoprolol is a beta-blocking agent used in the topical treatment of glaucoma. The necessity for comparing the plasma levels of a drug administered by the ophthalmic route with those obtained following systemic treatment requires increasingly sensitive methods in order to determine the low plasma concentrations produced by the administration of eye drops. On-line high-performance liquid chromatography-gas chromatography and concurrent solvent evaporation proved to be advantageous in the determination of levomoprolol in human plasma. Levomoprolol was determined by capillary gas chromatography (GC) with electron-capture detection (ECD) after solid-phase extraction from plasma and derivatization. Quantitation was based on the internal standard method. The detection limit of 0.2 ng/ml is 50 times lower than that obtained with previous GC methods involving on-column injection and ECD.", 
    "8": "The effects of some Class I antiarrhythmics (quinidine, procainamide and lidocaine) and some Class II antiarrhythmics (propranolol, atenolol and acebutolol) on canine cardiac sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity were studied. Both quinidine (5-100 microM) and procainamide (1-100 microM), unlike lidocaine, inhibited Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in sarcolemmal vesicles. The effective concentrations of these agents were well within their respective therapeutic ranges; about 30% inhibition was seen by 10 microM quinidine or procainamide. Propranolol showed a 25% inhibition of the Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity at 100 microM, which concentration is well above its therapeutic range. Acebutolol (0.1-100 microM) had no significant effects, whereas atenolol (10-100 microM), which appeared to inhibit Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake, also stimulated nonspecific Ca2+ uptake. These results indicate that the cardiac sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchange system may be one of the sites for the antiarrhythmic actions of quinidine and procainamide.", 
    "9": "Controlled pulmonary hypotension using sodium nitroprusside in combination with propranolol was employed in 23 patients in the early postoperative period after closed mitral valvulotomy. Pulmonary circulation, gas exchange and some nonrespiratory pulmonary functions have been assessed. It has been shown that increased blood levels of serotonin, histamine, noradrenaline and especially cyclic adenosine monophosphate play an essential role in the pathogenesis of postoperative pulmonary vasoconstriction.", 
    "10": "The effect of 4 weeks, 8 weeks and more than one year of treatment with the non-selective beta-receptor blocking agent, propranolol was investigated on glucose tolerance by oral glucose tolerance test. Statistically significant decrease in blood glucose level was observed in oral glucose tolerance test after 4 weeks and 8 weeks therapy with propranolol (P = less than .01 and less than .001). Statistically significant increase in glucose tolerance was also observed in all the samples of blood glucose level (P = less than .001) after more than one year therapy.", 
    "11": "In a double blind cross-over drug trial, antihypertensive effects (resting and after dynamic exercise) of atenolol and of labetalol were studied in 20 patients of mild to moderate essential hypertension. Both drugs exhibited almost equal antihypertensive response, and were well tolerated. Haemodynamic variables (HR, SBP, DBP and RPP), both at rest and after maximal tread mill exercise, were significantly altered (P less than 0.001) by both drugs. Exercise capacity was observed to be marginally improved by atenolol. Although the antihypertensive effect, when compared between the two drugs, was not statistically significant, individual suitability or comparison revealed a preference for atenolol in 17 patients and for labetalol in 3 patients.", 
    "12": "A study of the effects of low dose Metoprolol was undertaken in 37 patients with acute myocardial infarction. These patients were randomly divided into three groups depending on the dose of the drug per kg body weight. Group I, consisting of 18 patients, received 0.36 to 0.65 mg per kg per day, Group II (10 patients) received 0.66 to 0.99 mg/kg/day, and Group III (9 patients) 1 to 1.81 mg/kg/day. To assess the degree of beta blockade achieved, the parameters that were evaluated were the fall in blood pressure and heart rate. There was a fall in systolic blood pressure which ranged from 7 to 17%, and fall in heart rate of 6.6 to 12.8% in the 3 groups over the 48-hour study period. These observations were compared with the results obtained from the Goteberg Metoprolol trial and Metoprolol in acute myocardial infarction (MIAMI) trials wherein 200 mg of Metoprolol per day were used. Our preliminary observations suggest that Indian patients may not need such a high dose, and Metoprolol at 50-100 mg per day would probably be sufficient to get the desired effect.", 
    "13": "The changes of the parameters of Fourier's transformations of electrogastrorhythmograms of humans after feeding are investigated as well as of dogs after vagotomy. The study has demonstrated that the method of myoelectronic electrical stimulation (with feedback) may be used for estimation of efficiency of vagotomy.", 
    "14": "In vitro contracture tests for susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH) were performed with halothane and caffeine in 27 patients according to the protocol of the European MH Group. Additional halothane and caffeine tests were performed in the presence of propranolol 80 micrograms/l. Contractures after exposure to halothane were seen only in MH-susceptible (MHS) patients (n = 12), and were not affected by propranolol. In contrast, propranolol shifted the caffeine dose-response curve to the right and significantly increased the caffeine threshold in the MHS group. Propranolol did not influence the caffeine results in the normal response group group (n = 12). It is concluded that beta-blockers should be discontinued before investigation for MH susceptibility.", 
    "15": "Experiments were performed on conscious, chronically instrumented rats to assess the effect of chronic propranolol treatment on basal pulmonary hemodynamics and on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Rats received either propranolol (4 mg/day) or vehicle for 31 days via implanted osmotic mini-pumps. Animals were then acutely exposed to 8% and 10% O2. Pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored via chronically implanted catheters, and cardiac output (CO) was measured by thermodilution. Chronic administration o propranolol was associated with minimal changes in MABP, PAP and total pulmonary resistance (TPuR). However, HR and CO decreased and total systemic resistance (TSR) increased in propranolol treated rats. The acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor response of propranolol treated rats was significantly less than that of untreated control animals. Systemic hemodynamic responses to acute hypoxia did not differ between the groups. These data indicate that chronic propranolol administration reduces the acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor response in conscious rats, but does not alter basal pulmonary hemodynamics.", 
    "16": "The so-called \"low T3 syndrome\" has frequently been reported in patients with cirrhosis. In this study, we aimed to determine whether administration of propranolol to such patients leads to further changes in plasma thyroid hormones, since it can affect their peripheral metabolism. Twenty cirrhotics (11 with ascites) whom we investigated showed no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. The free fractions of plasma T3 and T4 (FT3, FT4) were determined by radioimmunoassay before and after the achievement of an effective beta-blockade by propranolol. The activity of the sympathetic nervous system also was evaluated by measuring plasma norepinephrine concentration. Under basal conditions, cirrhotics showed a reduced FT3 (2.45 +/- 0.11 SEM vs 3.55 +/- 0.16 pg/ml; p less than 0.001) and comparable FT4 (7.62 +/- 0.79 vs 9.2 +/- 0.42 pg/ml) and FT3/FT4 ratio (0.38 +/- 0.04 vs 0.42 +/- 0.013) with respect to healthy controls. When patients with ascites were considered apart, a reduction of FT4 was also found (6.78 +/- 0.74 pg/ml; p less than 0.01). In these patients, many of whom showed an increased plasma norepinephrine concentration, an inverse correlation between log FT3/FT4 and log plasma norepinephrine concentration was found (r = -0.79; p less than 0.01). The effective beta-blockade did not lead to significant changes in either FT3 or FT4 or FT3/FT4, whether the patients were considered as a whole (2.52 +/- 0.19 pg/ml, 9.3 +/- 1.41 pg/ml, and 0.36 +/- 0.04, respectively), or were split into groups according to the presence of ascites. When administered to cirrhotics, propranolol did not worsen thyroid hormone abnormalities, thus appearing to be safe in this respect. This may result from an impaired influence of the sympathoadrenergic system on thyroid hormone metabolism.", 
    "17": "A 40-year-old man, who had regularly taken illicit amphetamine by intra-nasal inhalation for several years without ill effects, was admitted to hospital with signs of massive adrenergic overstimulation shortly after inhaling material which he had purchased in the belief that it was amphetamine. The administration of the beta-blocker practolol produced a paradoxical increase in blood pressure. After his discharge from hospital he suffered disabling feelings of anxiety for several weeks. Analysis of a sample of the material showed it to contain p-methyl amphetamine and N, p-dimethyl amphetamine.", 
    "18": "In the present work [3H]-WB4101, [3H]-DHA, and [3H]-clonidine were used for the study of the localization of alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta adrenergic receptors in the chick brain. The highest concentration of [3H]-WB4101 was observed in the nucleus pretectalis, followed by the nucleus brachium conjunctivum descendens. The superficial layers of stratum griseum fibrosum superficiale, the nucleus mesencephalis lateralis pars dorsalis, and the locus coeruleus showed concentrations of [3H]-WB4101 binding higher than 300 fmoles/mg protein. Concentrations of [3H]-DHA binding higher than 300 fmoles/mg protein were observed in the paleostriatum, the external part of nucleus pretectalis, the nucleus isthmi parvocellularis, the nucleus mesencephalis lateralis pars dorsalis, the dorsal nucleus of oculomotor center, and the molecular layer of cerebellum. Locus coeruleus was the only area of chick brain which showed concentration of [3H]-clonidine binding higher than 300 fmoles/mg protein. With few exceptions, [3H]-clonidine binding was very low and in the telencephalon it was undetectable.", 
    "19": "The goal of the present study was to document the intrinsic origin of atrioventricular nodal functional properties (recovery time, facilitation, and fatigue) in two groups of six superfused isolated rabbit heart preparations. These properties were determined from recovery curves (A2H2 versus H1A2 intervals) obtained with previously defined periodic premature stimulation sequences performed before and after autonomic blockade demonstrated effective with the injection of agonists. In group 1 preparations, the muscarinic cholinergic and beta-adrenergic receptors were blocked with atropine (1 mg/L) and propranolol (1 mg/L), respectively. The blockade reduced the facilitation and increased the fatigue by the direct membranous effect of propranolol. To avoid this effect in group 2 preparations, propranolol was replaced by sotalol (5 mg/L), which in combination with atropine altered neither the presence nor the magnitude of the functional properties. These results show that the origin of the three nodal functional properties is independent from the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "20": "A self-tuning, closed-loop controller, based on the algorithm of Clarke and Gawthrop, was used to regulate the inspired concentration of isoflurane to reduce arterial pressure electively in 33 patients undergoing ENT surgery. The patients were allocated randomly to one of four groups and received differing doses of fentanyl and labetalol to vary the range of sensitivities to the hypotensive action of isoflurane. The performance of the controller was evaluated at two target arterial pressures (AP), by its response to simulated changes in AP and by a comparison with a further group of eight patients with manual control of AP. The controller's undershoot of AP (range 2.8 +/- 0.5-4.5 +/- 1.3 mm Hg) and % time spent within +/- 5 mm Hg of the target AP (range 83 +/- 3.4-89 +/- 2.2%) were acceptable and equalled the manual performance figures (range 3.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg; 90 +/- 5%). The regulation of induced hypotension in all four groups was rapid, accurate, stable and reproducible.", 
    "21": "A number of physiological responses and adjustments occur at high altitude to compensate for hypoxia. We hypothesized that interference with one component of the normal compensatory process, the sympathetic nervous system, would hinder altitude acclimatization and thereby exacerbate acute mountain sickness (AMS) and compromise well-being. Twelve young males (21.2 +/- 0.4 years) received either 80 mg propranolol (PRO; n = 6) or placebo (PLA; n = 6), t.i.d. at sea level (SL) and during the first 15 d of a 19-d residence at 4,300 m (HA). Individuals were randomly assigned to each group. The Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire (ESQ) was administered at SL and twice daily (AM and PM) during the entire altitude exposure in order to assess AMS symptoms and subjective feelings of well-being. Supine heart rate (HR) was determined at rest twice at SL and four times at HA. HR in the PLA group increased 40% over SL values (57 +/- 3 to 80 +/- 4 beats/min) by day 7 at HA (p less than 0.01). HR in the PRO group did not increase above SL values during medication at HA. By 4 d after the medication administration was terminated, HR in the PRO group had increased and did not differ from the PLA group. Throughout the entire altitude exposure, ESQ scores for the PRO group were lower than or similar to the PLA group. Furthermore, cessation of PRO treatment did not result in a change in well-being. These findings suggested that interference with the normal acclimatization process by beta-adrenergic blockade did not exacerbate AMS or reduce feelings of well-being.", 
    "22": "Accidental injection of local anesthetics containing epinephrine into a digit can cause distal tissue necrosis. Norepinephrine infiltration in subcutaneous tissue also causes tissue necrosis. Phentolamine has been used to prevent necrosis from norepinephrine. Because both epinephrine and norepinephrine are alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulators, the rat foot model was developed to study the possible use of phentolamine or labetalol in protection against tissue necrosis after injection of epinephrine in the extremity. Phentolamine was found to be useful in preventing tissue necrosis after the injection of local anesthetic containing epinephrine in the skin of the rat foot. Labetalol was found to be less effective in preventing tissue necrosis. Phentolamine may be useful in preventing tissue necrosis after the inadvertent injection of epinephrine containing local anesthetics in the digit.", 
    "23": "Dilevalol (50 mg) was given orally twice daily for eight days in six healthy subjects. All parameters were obtained following 1st (on day 1) and 15th (on day 8) dosages. Blood samples for plasma drug concentrations were taken for a 12-hour (after 1st dosage) or a 24-hour (after 15th dosage) post-drug period. Blood pressure (BP) as well as heart rate (HR) at supine position, during 50 degrees tilting and during a submaximal exercise were measured after each dosage. The mean time to maximum concentration (tmax) was faster, and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was greater after 15th dosage than following 1st dosage. No significant differences were observed in the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), the distribution half-life (t 1/2 alpha) or the elimination half-life (t 1/2 beta) between the two dosages. BP at supine position as well as during 50 degrees tilting decreased significantly after each dosage, and did not differ between 1st and 15th dosages. Postural changes in BP or HR during 50 degrees tilting were not induced following 1st or 15th dosage. The suppressing effects (%R) on an increase in HR during a submaximal exercise were significantly larger after 15th dosage than after 1st dosage. A significant correlation was observed between plasma dilevalol concentration and %R in HR. These data indicate that the hypotensive effect of dilevalol is not altered during the repeated administration of the drug for 8 days. However, the beta-blocking activity of dilevalol might be enhanced during the repeated dosages, which is, in part, attributed to dosage-dependent elevation in plasma drug concentrations.", 
    "24": "Dilevalol, the R-R optical isomer of labetalol, is a nonselective beta adrenergic blocking drug with selective beta-2 agonist properties. In a double-blind, crossover study the renal function effects of dilevalol were compared to placebo in 12 normotensive elderly volunteers before and after single dose administration. In addition, chronic treatment (greater than 4 weeks) effects of dilevalol were determined in eight elderly patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Renal function was determined by plasma disappearance curves from single injections of 99mTc-DTPA and 131I-orthohippurate. In both study populations renal function tests commenced two hours after dosing at expected peak plasma levels of dilevalol. Normotensive volunteers had an acute decrease in glomerular filtration rate of 10.3 ml/min, which was significant (P less than 0.05), while hypertensive patients had no change in glomerular filtration rate. There were no significant changes in other parameters of renal function measured. In the hypertensive elderly dilevalol treatment resulted in significant reductions, 18 and 19 mmHg respectively, of systolic (P less than 0.01) and diastolic (P less than 0.001) blood pressure. Heart rate was reduced by 5 beats per minute, and the change was not statistically significant. Dilevalol appears to be an excellent agent for treatment of hypertension in the elderly hypertensive patient, and does not change renal function when administered chronically to the hypertensive patient. Small but significant decrements in glomerular filtration rate occur with acute administration to normotensive volunteers.", 
    "25": "This study examined the effects of a nonselective beta-blocking agent on whole-body leucine metabolism in humans. Five normal, healthy subjects (4 male, 1 female) underwent a 6-h primed, constant-rate infusion of L-[1-13C]leucine after 5 days of twice daily oral use of 80 mg propranolol and a placebo. Leucine turnover was determined by tracer dilution and leucine oxidation by 13C enrichment of the expired CO2. Propranolol decreased the total daily energy expenditure from 1,945 +/- 177.5 to 1,619 +/- 92.5 kcal/day (P less than 0.05). A fasting associated decrease in blood glucose and an attenuated rise in free fatty acids and ketones were observed during beta-blockade. Propranolol also increased plasma leucine concentrations (73.1 +/- 8.7 to 103.4 +/- 7.3 mumol/l; P less than 0.05) and leucine oxidation (13.2 +/- 1.2 to 17.1 +/- 1.3 mumol.kg-1.h-1; P less than 0.05), although leucine turnover was not significantly altered (100.5 +/- 7.3 vs. 126.0 +/- 12.3 mumol.kg-1.h-1). In addition, the urinary urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio was greater during propranolol administration (0.24 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.34 +/- 0.02 mol/g; P less than 0.05). These data suggest that the beta-adrenergic system plays a role in the modulation of whole-body leucine metabolism in humans. Whether these changes are the result of a direct effect on skeletal muscle or an indirect effect mediated by altering the fuel supply to skeletal muscle cannot be discriminated by the present study.",

Electrolytic disturbances, long QT syndrome and nervous mechanisms were all ruled out. Right and left ventriculography, coronary angiograms, electrophysiologic study and endomyocardial biopsy all proved normal. A beta-blocker was empirically given in the absence of any reliable test to guide therapy more scientifically.", 
    "27": "1. Intravenous administration of platelet activating factor, Paf (600 ng kg-1 h-1) to ventilated anaesthetised guinea-pigs induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness to i.v. acetylcholine. 2. Pretreatment of ventilated, anaesthetised guinea-pigs with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, or the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin, induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness to i.v. histamine. 3. Paf-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with three different Paf antagonists, CV-3988, BN 52021 and WEB 2086. 4. Pretreatment of guinea-pigs with CV-3988, BN 52021 or WEB 2086 at doses inhibiting Paf-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness, had no significant effect on propranolol or indomethacin-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness. 5. It is suggested that bronchial hyperresponsiveness induced by propranolol or indomethacin is not secondary to Paf release in the guinea-pig.",

A patient diagnosed at age 22 and followed for 24 years who progressed to a dilated cardiomyopathy with severe congestive heart failure is reported. Left ventricular dilatation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be due to a complication of surgery, beta-blocker therapy, or myocardial infarction. It may also represent the natural history in a subset of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "29": "Intravenous (i.v.) access for administration of antiepileptic drugs can be time-consuming and difficult in an infant during a seizure. This study examined the intraosseous (i.o.) route as an alternative means of vascular access for drug administration in an animal-seizure model. Domestic swine (13-20 kg) were anesthetized with ketamine (20 mg/kg i.m.) and alpha-chloralose (80 mg/kg i.v.) and given gallamine (4 mg/kg i.v.) to prevent muscle fasciculations. Tracheosotomies were performed and the animals were ventilated with a Harvard respirator. The left femoral vein was cannulated and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) (100 mg/kg) was given to elicit epileptogenic activity. Sixty seconds after onset of epileptogenic activity, the animals received saline or diazepam (DZP) (0.1 mg/kg) or propranolol (2.5 mg/kg) i.v. or via the i.o. route (18-gauge spinal needle placed in the right proximal tibia). Both DZP and propranolol were effective in suppressing epileptogenic activity via the i.v. or i.o. routes. Thus, the i.o. route is a rapid and effective alternative route for the administration of antiepileptic drugs when an i.v. route cannot be readily established.", 
    "30": "The first pass uptake of fentanyl in the human lung was studied in two groups of patients using a double indicator dilution technique. A bolus containing fentanyl and indocyanine green dye (ICG) was rapidly injected into the central venous catheter of patients prior to anesthesia. Sequential arterial blood samples were collected at 1-s intervals for 45 s after injection. The total amount of fentanyl taken up by the lung during the first pass and the instantaneous extraction of fentanyl at each time point during the first pass were calculated from the differences in the arterial blood concentration versus time curves of the nondiffusible indicator (ICG) and the drug. In patients who had been receiving no other drugs prior to the experiment, the total first pass uptake (mean +/- SE) of fentanyl was 82.6% +/- 1.4% of the injected dose. In patients who had been receiving 30-120 mg/day of propranolol the total first pass uptake (mean +/- SE) of fentanyl decreased to 52.8% +/- 6.3% of the injected dose. In one patient on 120 mg of propranolol per day, first pass uptake of fentanyl was only 20.3% of the injected dose. Additional studies in a rat isolated perfused lung preparation coperfused with fentanyl and propranolol also demonstrated that one basic lipophilic amine (propranolol) could inhibit the pulmonary uptake of a second basic lipophilic amine (fentanyl). The high first pass uptake of fentanyl in the human lung limits the rate of entry of this drug into the systemic circulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "The direct effect of ketamine on cardiac muscle was studied using rat left ventricular papillary muscle. At an extracellular calcium concentration [( Ca++]0) of 2.5 mM, rat myocardial contractility is nearly maximum, and a positive inotropic effect was demonstrated by an increase in maximum shortening velocity (Vmax) with ketamine at 10(-5) M but not 10(-4) M. At a [Ca++]0 of 0.5 mM, ketamine 10(-5) and 10(-4) M had a positive inotropic effect as shown by an increase in Vmax (135% +/- 22% and 147% +/- 33%, respectively) and in isometric active force (AF/s) (120% +/- 10% and 152% +/- 44%, respectively). The positive inotropic effect of ketamine was not related to catecholamine uptake inhibition and/or alpha/beta receptor stimulation because it persisted after phentolamine and propranolol and because ketamine had no relaxing effect. Ketamine 10(-5) and 10(-4) M impaired isotonic relaxation, contraction-relaxation coupling under low loading conditions, and the load sensitivity of relaxation, which suggests impairment of the calcium sequestering systems, especially the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Ketamine modified postrest recovery: the first beat (B1) after a 1-min rest period was decreased by ketamine 10(-4) M but not ketamine 10(-5) M. Moreover, the beat-to-beat postrest recovery has been demonstrated to be exponential, and tau, the time constant of the decay was increased by ketamine 10(-4) M (5.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.9 +/- 0.2 beats) but not by ketamine 10(-5) M (3.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.2 beats). These effects on postrest recovery suggest that ketamine impairs SR function. The authors suggest that ketamine had a dual action on rat myocardium: a positive inotropic effect without any relaxing effect, probably related to an increase in calcium influx, and an impairment of SR function. Nevertheless, impairment of SR is only significant at high concentration (10(-4) M) and might overcome the positive inotropic effect only at supratherapeutic concentration.", 
    "32": "The maternofetal potential difference (PD) between catheters in maternal and fetal blood vessels has been measured in conscious sows between 97 and 107 days of gestation. The maternofetal PD was -18 +/- 4 mV (mean +/- SE, n = 13, fetus negative) on the day of surgery and -29 +/- 5 mV (n = 6) on the day after surgery. Injection of 2, 20, or 200 micrograms of epinephrine into the fetuses caused a marked rapid change in maternofetal PD such that the fetus became less negative and, in some cases, became positive with respect to the mother. The maximum change, obtained with 20 micrograms, was 19.9 +/- 5.6 mV (n = 7); measurements of fetal plasma epinephrine concentrations (using high-performance liquid chromatography) after injection of this dose gave a time 0-extrapolated concentration of 436.5 +/- 169.0 nmol/l (n = 4). Injection of 20 micrograms of the beta-agonist isoprenaline caused a maximum change in PD of 20 +/- 4 mV (n = 6); 2 mg of the alpha-agonist phenylephrine was required to produce a similar change (15 +/- 2 mV, n = 6). Injection of the beta-antagonist propranolol (1 mg) reduced the effect of 20 micrograms epinephrine by 40%. The effect of catecholamine on maternofetal PD is similar in polarity and specificity to that found for transplacental PD in vitro in the same species. There is, however, a difference between resting maternofetal and transplacental PD that remains unexplained.", 
    "33": "Caffeine-norepinephrine interactions were studied in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers perfused in vitro. Caffeine (0.5-1 mM) or theophylline (0.5-1 mM) increased and then decreased contractile force in the absence and presence of 0.5-10 microM norepinephrine (NE) [in high extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca]o) caffeine only decreases force]. Occasionally, caffeine only decreased force in the presence of NE. In the presence of NE and 12 mM (sometimes even 4 mM) extracellular potassium concentration, caffeine did not decrease force below the precaffeine level. Reciprocally, in 0.5-2 mM caffeine NE increased force, although less than in the absence of caffeine. Even in 9 mM caffeine, NE increased force but slowed the final phase three repolarization of the action potential. Both NE and 8.1 mM [Ca]o increased force, but NE decreased force in the presence of high [Ca]o. In NE and propranolol (or propranolol alone), caffeine only increased force, whereas it had the usual effects in the presence of methoxamine or phenotolamine. In the presence of iodoacetic acid and 2-deoxy-D-glucose, NE caused contracture and caffeine exaggerated it. In contrast, in NE and 2 mM Mn, caffeine only increased force. It is concluded that initially NE diminishes the cytoplasmic calcium overload induced by caffeine (by promoting Ca uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum) and subsequently enhances it (by increasing the slow inward current).", 
    "34": "To help define the mechanisms involved in the handling of propranolol by normal and injured lungs, we studied the pulmonary extraction of [3H]propranolol in 23 unanesthetized sheep. Extraction of propranolol by normal lungs during a single circulation was characterized by 1) subsequent back-diffusion and pulmonary retention of the drug, 2) no evidence of saturable uptake or binding, 3) no effect of isoproterenol or imipramine, and 4) no effect of increasing cardiac output by treadmill exercise. In lungs damaged by oxygen toxicity, [3H]propranolol extraction decreased progressively to 63% of base line, paralleling progressive arterial hypoxemia and hypercapnia. In contrast, [14C]serotonin extraction remained unchanged from base line. Our results suggest that in normal unanesthetized sheep, pulmonary extraction of propranolol occurs primarily by passive diffusion that is flow-limited. Also, lung injury induced by oxygen toxicity in sheep reduces the pulmonary extraction of propranolol. Indeed, in oxygen toxicity, the depressed extraction of propranolol is a more sensitive marker of lung injury than is serotonin extraction.", 
    "35": "The combination of atenolol with diltiazem has been shown to be useful in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. Eighteen patients with proven coronary artery disease, stable angina, and no previous myocardial infarction were studied before and after treatment with atenolol (100 mg/day) (9 patients) or diltiazem (180 mg/day) (9 patients). Ischemic threshold at stress test, pressure-rate product at ischemic threshold, direct oxygen consumption at ischemic threshold, and exercise ejection fraction were determined. There was a slight increase in the duration of exercise, maximal oxygen consumption, and ischemic threshold after treatment with each drug. Double product at ischemic threshold decreased from 20.9 to 19.8 (p = NS) with atenolol but increased from 20.1 to 21.9 (p = NS) with diltiazem. Conversely oxygen consumption at ischemic threshold increased with atenolol to nearly significant values from 17.2 to 23.6 (p = 0.067) but not with diltiazem (16.2 to 22.3; p = 0.16). Before treatment, exercise ejection fraction increased less than 10% or decreased from its resting values in all patients but 1 with atenolol and 1 with diltiazem, but exercise ejection fraction increased significantly after treatment with atenolol (60.6 to 67.5; p = 0.02) but not with diltiazem. This improvement was due to a significant reduction in end systolic volume (103.8 to 78.6; p = 0.019), despite a similar increase in heart rate and blood pressure in all patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "In 24 patients with stable spontaneous and effort-related angina, ischemic episodes at rest were not preceded by changes in circulatory variables (heart rate, systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures) that may raise the myocardial oxygen consumption. We interpreted these episodes as caused by critical and reversible coronary flow reduction at the site of a stenotic lesion, and evaluated the clinical efficacy of nifedipine and propranolol in the treatment of this condition.", 
    "37": "The study was randomized, placebo-controlled, and crossover in design. Nineteen of the 24 subjects were men (mean group age, 59 years; range, 47 to 65 years). The study consisted of four four-day periods. The first and the fourth periods, during which patients received placebo, were single-blind. The treatment consisted of 80 mg of propranolol or 20 mg of nifedipine administered four times daily. The second and the third periods, during which patients received propranolol or nifedipine crossing over to the alternative drug in the next period, were double-blind and separated by a 24-hour interval.", 
    "38": "Propranolol fully abolished or reduced the number of spontaneous ischemic episodes in a significantly larger proportion of patients than did nifedipine; it was also effective in several cases in which nifedipine had failed or had even caused a paradoxic effect. Quantitative angiographic evaluation of the influences of nifedipine (Group 1, 12 patients, 10 mg sublingually) and propranolol (Group 2, 12 patients, 0.1 mg/kg intravenously) on the residual lumen diameter of one significant coronary stenosis in each patient showed that (1) after nifedipine, the lumen was unchanged in one, augmented in seven, and reduced in four cases; (2) variations ranged between +1.59 and -1.2 mm, and their direction correlated closely with the influence of oral nifedipine on the episodes of spontaneous ischemia; and (3) in no case did treatment with propranolol vary the stenosis lumen by more than 0.3 mm.", 
    "39": "In this form of angina, a number of lesions seem to offer a compliant substrate for vasomotion and, possibly, for critical changes in flow. The vasomotor influences of nifedipine on these lesions are variable as well as the efficacy of the drug on the manifestations of ischemia at rest. Propranolol produces no important variations of the coronary stenotic lesions, causes a decrease of heart rate that facilitates coronary flow in diastole, and reduces the baseline metabolic demand of the heart so that the threshold of ischemia during critical reduction of coronary flow may become elevated.", 
    "40": "The effect of chronic propranolol administration on antipyrine and paracetamol clearance was studied in patients with chronic liver disease. Propranolol caused an acute reduction in antipyrine clearance which did not persist with chronic administration. Propranolol did not influence the clearance of total or unconjugated paracetamol, either acutely or at 6 or 12 months. A slight increase in serum urea occurred in patients receiving propranolol, compared with the control group, but this difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that, although propranolol may have some influence on drug handling acutely, chronic administration does not interfere with hepatic drug metabolism or renal drug clearance.", 
    "41": "The electrophysiologic effects and antiarrhythmic efficacy of oral sotalol were investigated in 42 patients with coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction who presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF) or syncope. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 36 +/- 9%. Baseline programmed cardiac stimulation initiated sustained VT (26 patients) or VF (16). The induced arrhythmia was not suppressed by conventional antiarrhythmic drugs in any patient (3 +/- 2 trials/patient). The mean daily dosage of sotalol was 221 +/- 84 mg. The right ventricular effective refractory period increased from 247 +/- 25 to 273 +/- 26 ms with sotalol (p = 0.0001) and the corrected QT interval increased from 431 +/- 35 to 456 +/- 62 ms (p = 0.02). Arrhythmia suppression was defined as no sustained VT or VF in response to programmed cardiac stimulation using up to 3 extrastimuli. Induced VT or VF was suppressed by sotalol therapy in 10 (24%) patients (group 1). Group 1 patients had faster induced arrhythmias at the baseline study than patients whose induced ventricular arrhythmia was not suppressed (group 2). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction tended to be higher in group 1 patients (p = 0.07). Fourteen patients (including 9 group 1 patients) continued receiving sotalol after discharge. In 2 group 2 patients, sotalol was combined with a class IA antiarrhythmic drug. During a mean follow-up period of 7.9 +/- 4.9 months, 2 patients had recurrent VT and in 2 others sotalol was discontinued due to side effects.", 
    "42": "We compared dilevalol (an isomer of labetalol), 200-400 mg daily, against atenolol, 50-100 mg daily, in a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial with respect to effects on arterial distensibility (measured as pulse wave velocity [PWV]) and wave reflection (assessed from carotid pressure wave contour). Twelve patients of mean age 58 years (range 44-73 years) with essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure 95-114 mm Hg) took active therapy for 12 weeks, separated by a 2-4 week placebo period. Carotid pressure waveforms were recorded noninvasively by applanation tonometry with a Millar micromanometer-tipped probe. PWV was measured between carotid and femoral arteries (aortic PWV), carotid and radial arteries (arm PWV), and femoral and pedal arteries (leg PWV). Early wave reflection was calculated from the ratio of the height of the peak of the carotid wave above its shoulder to the pulse pressure and was expressed as an augmentation index. Both drugs were equally effective in reducing brachial sphygmomanometric pressure and PWV in all three regions (active vs. placebo, p less than 0.001), but there was no significant difference between the two active therapies. However, the augmentation index (averaged during the treatment period) was significantly lower with dilevalol (19%) than with atenolol (28%, p less than 0.01), corresponding to a greater decrease of 5-8 mm Hg in carotid systolic pressure compared with the brachial artery. Although both drugs were equally effective in reducing arterial distensibility, the vasodilating action of dilevalol gave added benefit in reducing wave reflection, presumably through its vasodilatory effect on peripheral conduit arteries.", 
    "43": "Previous work has shown that exercise training increases the ventricular fibrillation threshold of the isolated perfused rat heart. The aim of our study was to determine whether exercise training that begins after myocardial infarction can similarly increase the ventricular fibrillation threshold. Rats that had suffered an experimental myocardial infarction were subject to a running training program. Thereafter, the ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured before and after the onset of acute reinfarction induced by a second coronary artery ligation. Ventricular fibrillation thresholds were significantly elevated in trained rats during normoxia (13.7 +/- 2.2 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.8 mA, p less than 0.01) and during acute ischemia (6.8 +/- 1.6 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.7 mA, p less than 0.02). The myocardial cyclic AMP level was lower in the nonischemic zone of the trained hearts (0.21 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.28 +/- 0.01 nmol/g, p less than 0.05), which also had lower cyclic AMP levels after epinephrine challenge (0.50 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.73 +/- 0.09 nmol/g, p less than 0.01; 1.41 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.85 +/- 0.09 nmol/g, p less than 0.02 after epinephrine 10(-7) M and 5 x 10(-6) M injection, trained vs. untrained). Both propranolol 10(-6) M and epinephrine 5 x 10(-7) M attenuated the difference in ventricular fibrillation thresholds before and after second coronary artery ligation and eliminated any difference in cyclic AMP content of both the nonischemic and ischemic myocardial tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "Acute right ventricular pressure overload shifts the interventricular septum leftward and decreases systolic shortening of the left ventricular (LV) septal-lateral diameter. These changes should alter regional shortening in the LV minor axis. To test this hypothesis, LV minor axis circumferential segment lengths of the septum and anterior, lateral, and posterior walls were measured during pulmonary artery or venae caval constriction in seven open-chest dogs with intact pericardia. Starting at an end-diastolic pressure of 10 mm Hg, venae caval constriction decreased LV end-systolic pressure by 19 +/- 6% and stroke volume by 40 +/- 15% and produced uniform decreases in systolic shortening and end-diastolic length around the minor axis. However, during pulmonary artery constriction resulting in similar decreases in end-systolic pressure (22 +/- 7%) and stroke volume (39 +/- 11%), decreases in systolic shortening were significantly larger in the anterior (-34 +/- 10%) and posterior (-33 +/- 21%) walls than in the septum (-10 +/- 9%) or lateral wall (-8 +/- 13%). The mechanisms of these large anterior and posterior shortening decreases differed: anterior end-diastolic length decreased more than posterior and lateral end-diastolic lengths, while posterior end-systolic length decreased less than anterior and lateral end-systolic lengths. Similar changes were seen at starting end-diastolic pressures of 5 and 15 mm Hg. Propranolol did not alter this nonuniform response, while pericardiectomy attenuated the regional variations. Thus, changes in LV geometry during acute right ventricular pressure overload are associated with nonuniform regional changes in systolic shortening in the LV minor axis that are enhanced by the pericardium.", 
    "45": "The hypothesis that cocaine has Class I-type antiarrhythmic drug effects was tested in tissues isolated from rabbit heart with standard microelectrode methods. Propranolol (1 microM) was used to block beta-adrenergic effects. The actions of cocaine on cellular electrophysiology were concentration- and time-dependent and were reversible. In paced right atrial (RA) and right ventricular papillary (RVP) tissues, cocaine produced a profound prolongation of the effective refractory period (ERP) assessed by either premature stimulation or minimum pacing interval. ERP was increased up to eightfold in RA tissue and doubled in RVP tissue by 60 microM cocaine. This concentration of cocaine depressed action potential phase 0 depolarization 80% in RA tissue and 53% in RVP tissue but had no effect on resting membrane potentials. Automaticity was moderately depressed in sinus node (34% decrease in rate) but not in tricuspid valve cells. Phase 0 depolarization was not altered in these spontaneously active slow-response cells. Repolarization was depressed in RA, tricuspid valve, and sinus node cells leading to a twofold increase in action potential duration during exposure to cocaine. Evidence from the effects on cellular action potentials suggests that cocaine affects both fast Na+ channels and repolarizing K+ but not Ca2+ channels. We conclude that cocaine has Class I-type activity and the effects on ERP are extreme.",

Both treatments significantly (P less than 0.001) decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure; 45.6% of patients receiving chlorthalidone and 82.5% receiving combined therapy had a diastolic blood pressure of less than 95 mmHg. Patients not controlled by chlorthalidone or chlorthalidone plus metoprolol subsequently received chlorthalidone plus metoprolol (137 patients) or chlorthalidone plus metoprolol plus a third drug (34 patients), respectively, for 8 weeks. A total of 79.5% of patients receiving chlorthalidone plus metoprolol and 61.8% receiving chlorthalidone plus metoprolol plus a third drug had a diastolic blood pressure of less than 95 mmHg. Only 5.9% of patients experienced mild to moderate side-effects. Plasma potassium levels significantly (P less than 0.01) decreased during the first 8 weeks only. It is concluded that a diuretic alone or in fixed combination with a beta-blocker is effective in the long-term treatment of arterial hypertension.", 
    "48": "We report here the final analysis of a multicentre randomized, single-blind trial of propranolol for prophylaxis of first bleeding in cirrhosis. One hundred and seventy-four consecutive patients with large esophageal varices were randomly assigned to either propranolol in doses reducing the resting heart rate by 25% (85 patients) or to a placebo (vitamin K: 89 patients). Three were lost to follow-up and 26 had to be withdrawn from propranolol because of side effects (n = 23) or low compliance (n = 3). The cumulative value over 42 months of patients free of bleeding was 74% (95% confidence interval = 85%-63%) in the propranolol and 59% (95% CI = 79%-43%) in the control group and the corresponding survival figures were 51% (95% CI = 63%-39%) and 59% (95% CI = 75%-43%): neither of the differences was significant. A retrospective analysis according to the presence of ascites at randomization showed that in the subset without ascites the proportion of patients free of bleeding was significantly higher in the propranolol group than in the control group (83% vs. 61%; 95% CI = 97%-69% and 78%-44%, respectively; P = 0.028); this difference was even more evident in the ascites-free period (94% vs. 58%; 95% CI = 100%-86% and 76%-40%, respectively; P = 0.002). No differences were found in patients with ascites at randomization. Survival was not significantly affected by treatment in any subgroup, although it was shorter in the ascitic patients given propranolol than in controls (33% vs. 49%; 95% CI = 51%-15% and 71%-27%, respectively; P = 0.07).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "In a randomized, double-blind study (n = 58) with parallel groups, the effects of diltiazem (mean dose 329 mg/day) and atenolol (mean dose 67 mg/day) on carbohydrate and lipoprotein metabolism in hypertensive patients were compared. The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reductions in the supine position were similar and satisfactory, 9/11 and 11/9 mmHg during atenolol and diltiazem treatment, respectively. Insulin-mediated glucose uptake, measured with the euglycaemic insulin clamp technique, decreased during atenolol treatment, from 7.1 to 5.6 mg/kg per min (P = 0.05). but not during treatment with diltiazem (initial value 6.8, final value 6.7 mg/kg per min; P greater than 0.8). Treatment differences between groups were statistically significant (P less than 0.05). During atenolol treatment there was a slight but significant increase in plasma glucose in the fasting state (P less than 0.05) and at the end of an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT; P less than 0.01), and in plasma insulin at the end of IVGTT (P less than 0.05). Despite increased insulin resistance the increase in insulin response was small, suggesting inhibition of insulin release. The insulin peak was decreased by 13% during diltiazem treatment (P less than 0.05). The concentrations of very-low and low-density lipoprotein triglycerides increased, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was unaffected during atenolol treatment. In conclusion, there was no difference between the antihypertensive effects of atenolol and diltiazem, but atenolol decreased insulin sensitivity and altered the lipid profile, thus possibly increasing the risk of diabetes mellitus and theoretically reducing the benefits of blood pressure reduction with regard to risk of coronary heart disease.", 
    "50": "Dilevalol (25 mg----50 mg----100 mg) or labetalol (100 mg) was given orally in six healthy subjects. The study was carried out on four occasions with a week interval. Blood samples for plasma drug concentrations were taken for a 24-hour post-drug period. Blood pressure (BP) as well as heart rate (HR) at supine position, during 50 degrees tilting and during a submaximal exercise were measured after each treatment. The mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) as well as the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increased in a dose-dependent manner after dilevalol. These parameters after dilevalol 100 mg were significantly lower than after labetalol 100 mg. No significant differences were observed in the time to maximum concentration (tmax), the distribution half-life (t1/2 alpha) or the elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) between dilevalol and labetalol. There were no significant differences in BP at supine position or during 50 degrees tilting among the dosages. Postural changes in HR during 50 degrees tilting was significantly smaller after dilevalol 100 mg than following labetalol 100 mg. The suppressing effect of dilevalol 100 mg on an increase in HR during a submaximal exercise was significantly greater than during labetalol 100 mg. These data indicate that although plasma drug concentrations are lower after dilevalol than following labetalol, the beta-blocking activity of dilevalol is more potent than labetalol.",

Doses required to reduce SDBP to 90 mm Hg were not different in young (1.08 +/- 0.21 mg/kg/day) and elderly (0.82 +/- 0.14 mg/kg/day) patients (mean +/- SE). Trough plasma nadolol concentrations at steady state were similar and were linearly related to dose in both groups. More unchanged nadolol was recovered in 24-hour urine samples from young subjects (15.6% +/- 1.9%) than from elderly ones (10.7% +/- 1.1%) (p = 0.028). With increasing nadolol doses, plasma norepinephrine concentration increased and isoproterenol sensitivity decreased in both young and elderly subjects, and creatinine clearance and plasma active renin levels were unchanged; plasma inactive renin levels increased in the young, and aldosterone concentration declined in the elderly with the lowest nadolol dose.",

The enhanced levels of lipid peroxides, xanthine oxidase activity and lowering of superoxide dismutase may lead to excessive formation of free radicals resulting in cardiac cell damage. Nifedipine--a calcium antagonist, Propranolol--a beta-blocker and guggulsterone a lipid lowering agent showed marked reversal of these metabolic changes related to ischemia induced by isoproterenol.", 
    "53": "The effects of a beta-blocker, propranolol, on the enzyme and isoenzyme activities in the heart muscle in vitro and concomitant histopathology of the component cells of the islets of Langerhans were studied in the Wistar rats after treatment with streptozotocin and isoproterenol. The biochemical data indicated that the isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction (MI) precipitates an acute diabetic response in the rat heart. The superimposition of MI in diabetes mellitus caused significant inhibition of phosphofructokinase and hexokinase in the heart muscle. The lactate dehydrogenase depicted shifting of H-type to M-type in diabetes with or without MI. The drugs, when administered in combination, brought distinctive histopathological changes in beta-cells of the pancreatic islets including degranulation, hyalinosis and a near-total destruction; however A and D cells remained more or less unaffected. The effect of propranolol in diabetes mellitus was uncertain but in MI with or without prior diabetes, the drug inversely altered the activities of all the cardiac enzymes, besides stimulating a mild recuperation of the cells of the endocrine parenchyma.", 
    "54": "The effect of a single treatment with cigarette smoke on the blood levels and hemodynamic effects of propranolol in rats was studied. Pentobarbital sleep time was not affected whereas zoxazolamine paralysis time was shortened 72% in rats, 24 h after the cigarette smoke exposure. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect of propranolol observed at 10 and 20 min time intervals was abolished in rats exposed to cigarette smoke 24 h after the exposure. The blood propranolol concentrations were decreased in rats pretreated with phenobarbital, 3,4-benzpyrene and ethanol as well as in cigarette smoke exposed rats. Among several factors that could influence propranolol metabolism, in this study, enzyme induction is suggested to be dominant.", 
    "55": "Isoprenaline stimulated increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine content in cardiac tissues are implicated in macromolecular synthesis and cellular growth, but little is known about polyamine metabolism in functionally distinct regions of the heart. We therefore determined regional changes in ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine content in the right and left ventricles, septum, and the right and left atria of the rat following the administration of isoprenaline. An increase in ornithine decarboxylase specific activity and tissue polyamine content occurred in all cardiac regions, but the highest ornithine decarboxylase activity was found in the septum. Propranolol inhibited the isoprenaline stimulated ornithine decarboxylase activity in all the regions. Putrescine increased and peaked between 6 and 8 h in right and left ventricles and septum and declined to a control level by 12 h. Following a peak increase at 8 h, spermidine and spermine contents of both ventricles were maintained at peak levels, while those in the septum declined to control values by 12 h. There was no detectable putrescine in the right atria from the control experiments and in either atrium at 2 h following isoprenaline administration. Putrescine content peaked at 6 h in the right atrium and at 8 h in the left atrium and then declined. In both atria there was a peak increase in spermidine and spermine contents between 4 and 8 h. These results show that there is a regional variation in the accumulation of polyamines in the rat heart following isoprenaline administration.", 
    "56": "A new method based on displacement electrophoresis has been developed for the determination of the total and free concentration of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker drug, in plasma. To determine the total concentration the drug is extracted from human plasma into a chloroform + heptane mixture in the presence of ammonia. After evaporation of the solvent mixture the residue is submitted to displacement electrophoresis in a glass tube containing a two-layer polyacrylamide gel. When the propranolol electrophoretically leaves the gel column it is transferred by a buffer flow to the cuvette of a fluorimeter for continuous detection and quantification. The concentration of the free non-protein bound drug can be determined by the same displacement electrophoresis technique following extraction of the plasma sample into the above organic solvent mixture in the absence of ammonia. Alternatively the extraction procedure can be exchanged for dialysis for 1 h. To decrease the risk that large size material might comigrate with propranolol two layers of polyacrylamide are used, one having small pores to retard such material. In addition, we use fluorimetric detection which means that many possible contaminants are not recorded and therefore do not affect a quantitative determination of propranolol.",

    "59": "The beta-adrenomimetic and beta-adrenolytic activities of R(+) and S(-) isomers of befunolol, a beta-adrenergic partial agonist, were studied in the guinea-pig taenia caecum. The pA2 value (9.38) of the S(-) isomer against S(-) isoprenaline was significantly different from that (7.94) of the R(+) isomer, while the pD2 values and intrinsic activities of R(+) and S(-) isomers were not significantly different from each other. The competitive inhibition curves of the specific binding of [3H]befunolol (50 nM) to the microsomal fraction from the guinea-pig taenia caecum by S(-) and R(+) isomers were biphasic, suggesting two different affinity binding sites. The affinity ratio of the R(+) isomer against the S(-) isomer to the high affinity site was 0.081 while the affinities of R(+) and S(-) isomers to the low affinity site were not significantly different from each other. The affinity ratio of the R(+) isomer against the S(-) isomer to the high affinity site resembled their potency ratio in beta-adrenergic blocking action. These findings suggest that beta-adrenoceptors contain two different affinity binding sites and that the high affinity binding site for isoprenaline is more stereoselective than the low affinity binding site.", 
    "60": "The effects of pimobendan on the sinus node pacemaker activity and atrial contractility and on the left ventricular contractility were investigated in the isolated, cross-circulated right atrial and left ventricular preparations of the dog. Pimobendan, at a dose range of 1 to 1,000 nmol, injected into the sinus node artery of the isolated atrium, induced dose-dependent positive inotropic and chronotropic responses. At the same doses, it also induced dose-dependent increases in the left ventricular contractile force, similar to those in the atrial one, although the norepinephrine (NE)- and isoproterenol-induced positive inotropic effects in the ventricles were less than those in the atria. The positive cardiac effects were not inhibited by propranolol but they were depressed by intramural vagal nerve stimulation. These results suggest that pimobendan increases left ventricular contractility more effectively than atrial contractility in comparison with a beta-adrenoceptor agonist and that the positive cardiac effects of pimobendan were partially induced by a phosphodiesterase inhibition but not by a beta-adrenoceptor activation in the dog heart. When pimobendan, at a dose of 10 to 1,000 micrograms/kg, was cumulatively administered into the jugular vein of the support dog, a decrease in arterial blood pressure and an increase in heart rate were dose-dependently observed in the support dog. Half a minute after administration, the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses were induced in the isolated atrium in a dose-related manner. The pimobendan-induced positive cardiac effects were not inhibited by i.v. administration of propranolol, whereas the isosorbide dinitrate-induced positive chronotropic effects were significantly inhibited. These results indicate that pimobendan directly increases cardiac contractility and heart rate with vasodilatation in anesthetized dogs.", 
    "61": "1. An in vitro preparation of the rabbit knee joint, perfused with oxygenated Locke solution, was used to assess the nature of adrenoceptors within articular blood vessels. 2. Dose/response relationships were obtained to intra-arterial injection of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists. 3. Adrenaline and noradrenaline produced a similar pattern of increasing constriction of articular vessels with increasing dose of drug. 4. The alpha 1-agonist, phenylephrine, also produced dose-dependent constrictor responses, but the alpha 2-agonist; clonidine, had no effect. The alpha 2-agonist UK-14304 did, however, produce modest vasoconstriction which was not greatly altered by the alpha 1-blocker prazosin. The constrictor effect of noradrenaline was abolished by both the alpha 1,2-blocker phenoxybenzamine and by prazosin but not by the alpha 2-blocker rauwalscine. 5. The beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, had little effect at a dose of 10(-6) M or lower, but gave rise to a constrictor effect at higher concentrations. This response was blocked by phenoxybenzamine but not by the beta 1,2-blocker propranolol, suggesting that the constrictor effect was mediated via alpha-adrenoceptors. 6. The results suggest that alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors are present within articular blood vessels, but that beta-receptors are absent. The effects of noradrenaline appear to be mediated principally via alpha 1-adrenoceptors.",

    "64": "The prognosis for patients with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) remains controversial, although a number of studies have shown a less favorable outlook after hospital discharge for patients with non-Q-wave than for those with Q-wave infarction. Numerous management strategies are available to the clinician, many of which involve an interventional strategy (myocardial revascularization with coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty) or a more conservative approach which emphasizes secondary prevention with medical therapy. This review summarizes the role of identifying risk variables in patients with non-Q-wave MI and their importance to clinical decision making. Based on data obtained from the Diltiazem Reinfarction Study (DRS), it has been shown that 20% of patients experience one or more episodes of spontaneous postinfarction angina which is associated with a significant increased (33%) 2-week mortality and an appreciable fivefold increased incidence of early reinfarction compared to patients without early recurrent ischemia. Similar findings have been observed in this same cohort of patients who were followed for one year, in that there was twofold higher incidence of death and late reinfarction at one year of follow-up. Other risk factors also appear to be important determinants of adverse long-term outcome after non-Q-wave MI and include persistent ST segment depression on serial electrocardiograms, congestive heart failure, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Medical therapy employed for secondary prophylaxis after non-Q-wave MI has failed to show a convincing therapeutic rationale for beta blocker administration. In contrast, diltiazem has been shown to influence the early and late outcome following non-Q-wave MI favorably.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) differs from Q-wave MI in three important respects: (1) smaller infarct size possibly due to early reperfusion as a result of spontaneous thrombolysis, relief of spasm, or both; (2) more frequent patency of the infarct-related artery; and (3) a larger residual mass of viable but jeopardized myocardium within the perfusion zone of the infarct-related vessel. Left ventricular function, unless impaired by previous MI, is generally better. The prognosis is worse after the acute phase, when residual ischemia is present, and reinfarction rates during hospitalization and in the subsequent year of follow-up are higher. Obviously, since myocardial ischemia is potentially reversible, its presence should be energetically sought in all patients with recognized non-Q-wave MI. Based on our current understanding and available data, the following guidelines for the management of non-Q-wave MI patients can be recommended: (1) antiplatelet therapy along with diltiazem should be administered to patients as soon as the diagnosis is established, unless contraindications exist; (2) patients who develop early recurrent ischemia on therapy, that is, angina with associated ST-T-wave changes, should undergo prompt cardiac catheterization and myocardial revascularization; (3) patients with entirely uncomplicated hospital courses who are asymptomatic should undergo exercise stress testing, preferably in conjunction with thallium-201 imaging, before hospital discharge. Only those with evidence of significant residual ischemia need cardiac catheterization and myocardial revascularization.", 
    "66": "The aim of this study was to investigate the relative numbers of myocardial beta 1 and beta 2 receptors in pigs. Membrane particles from left ventricular porcine and mixed ventricular rat myocardium were examined for subtypes of beta adrenergic receptors with a radioligand binding technique using [125I]-cyanopindolol (ICYP) as trace, and the new highly beta 1 selective antagonist Sandoz 204 545 and the beta 2 selective antagonist ICI 118 551 for displacement. Radioligand displacement experiments were also performed using propranolol, isoprenaline and terbutaline. The displacement curves obtained with the subtype selective antagonists and agonist revealed biphasic inhibition of specific ICYP binding in rat preparations, indicating a beta 1/beta 2 ratio of approximately 2/1. In porcine preparations displacement of specific ICYP binding with all agents resulted in monophasic curves, thus sharply contrasting the rat preparations. Affinity constants of displacing drugs derived from these monophasic curves indicated that the specific binding site was a beta 1 receptor. No displacement compatible with beta 2 affinity was found. In the same rat preparations we found that adenylate cyclase activation and inhibition by beta receptor subtype specific agonists and antagonists were mediated by two receptor subtypes, whereas in the pig, adenylate cyclase activation and its inhibition seemed to occur via only one receptor subtype, the beta 1 adrenoceptor.", 
    "67": "A delay in the onset of isoniazid-induced convulsions was found in rats pretreated with the beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker, butoxamine and the nonspecific beta-blocker, propranolol. In these animals the convulsive responses were inhibited in a dose dependent manner. These compounds were found to be effective even after the induction of convulsions. The beta 1-blocker, acebutolol was able to protect rats only when injected prior to the challenge. The anticonvulsant effect of acebutolol and propranolol but not that of butoxamine was found to be enhanced in animals pretreated with a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) elevating agent, aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA). The findings indicate that the GABA-mediated anticonvulsant action of AOAA seems to be additive with that resulting from beta 1 but not beta 2-blockade.",

    "69": "A transient increase (10 min) in extracellular calcium concentration (4 mM) causes a long-lasting (greater than 2 hr) enhancement of population spike responses evoked by radiatum fibers to CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices. This phenomenon is similar to tetanic long-term potentiation (LTP), and is also related to memory processes. The influence of various drugs was investigated on calcium-induced LTP. The NMDA antagonist 2 amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5; 100 microM) was able to prevent the calcium-induced LTP, while atropine sulphate (10 microM), propranolol hydrochloride (10 microM) and verapamil hydrochloride (100 microM) were ineffective. The results suggest an involvement of the NMDA receptor in the development of calcium-induced LTP.",

Eight patients were withdrawn in the group I (poor efficacy, n = 5 or unexpected event, n = 3), and one in the group III (unexpected event).

In this work, we confirmed in vitro the renal vasodilator effect of tertatolol and we investigated its mechanism. The rat kidney was isolated and perfused at constant flox in an open circuit with a Krebs-Henseleit solution. A vascular tone was restablished by sequential bolus injections of serotonine (every 5 mn) at a dose increasing perfusion pressure by 40 mm Hg. Tertatolol and other drugs were perfused at increasing concentrations during successive periods of 15 mn. Any relaxation was expressed as percentage inhibition of the initial vaso-constriction induced by serotonine.

BTX doses varied from 10 to 40 mg/day. BTX given as monotherapy (n = 19) or associated to dihydralazine (n = 3) led to a satisfactory control of arterial blood pressure (ABP). In the mother, the drug was very well tolerated. (table; see text) The fetal safety, evaluated by mean of cardiotocography and echography was also satisfactory. Fetal heart rythm was significantly slowed following first intake of BTX and remained stable until delivery; there was only one case of intra-uterine growth retardation pre-existing to the pharmacological treatment. Nine deliveries were ceasarian [fetal distress (n = 1); poor control ABPI (n = 1); obstetrical reasons (n = 7)]. Seventeen neonates were full-term and six were premature (twins included). The state of neonates at birth was very satisfactory (Apgar at 5 minutes greater than 9 in 21/23). Glycemia less than 1.66 mmoles/1 in two neonates, was normal within 24 to 48 hours. In conclusion, BTX was very efficacious in controlling increased blood pressure in pregnant women and its safety in the mother, the fetus and the newborn was very good.",

However, the usefulness of beta blockers in the treatment of recurrent variceal bleeding remains controversial with controlled trials showing both benefit and lack of benefit.

    "75": "The cardiovascular effects of SIPI-549 [4'-methyl-7-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminoproxy)-flavone hydrochloride] were investigated in isolated canine atrial and ventricular muscles perfused with heparinized arterial blood from a donor dog. When SIPI-549 was administered intravenously to the intact donor dog, a slight hypotension was induced in a dose range of 0.01 to 3 mumol/kg. At the same time, slight negative chronotropic and inotropic responses appeared in isolated and perfused atria, suggesting a cardiac depressant action. Direct administration of SIPI-549 into the cannulated sinus node artery of the isolated atrium produced negative inotropic and biphasic chronotropic responses in a dose related manner (0.01-1 mumol). SIPI-549 also induced a dose-dependent decrease in developed tension of the isolated left ventricle. The SIPI-549-induced negative chronotropic and inotropic effects were not modified by atropine in doses which blocked carbachol-induced negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. The SIPI-549-induced positive chronotropic effects were inhibited by propranolol but significantly potentiated by imipramine treatment, indicating that a large dose of SIPI-549 produces a release of catecholamine via a non-tyramine like action. Large doses of SIPI-549 did not significantly affect norepinephrine-induced positive chronotropic effects. These results indicate that SIPI-549 may have non-cholinergic cardiac depressant properties and no beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity. However, it appears to elicit a release of catecholamines in a non-tyramine-like manner at relatively large doses.", 
    "76": "1. The actions of angiotensin II, bradykinin, oxytocin, arginine vasopressin, relaxin, serotonin and the prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha were examined on preparations of costo-uterine muscle from stilboestrol-treated rats. 2. All the agonists, except relaxin, when used in concentrations which contract the rat uterus, also produced contractions of costo-uterine muscles. Concentration-response curves were steep and maximal responses to the agonists were comparable. The negative log molar EC50 values were: serotonin, 6.5; angiotensin II, 8.8; bradykinin, 8.4; PGE2, 8.3; PGF2 alpha, 7.1. The EC50 values (units/L) for oxytocin and vasopressin were 4.4 and 2.7 respectively. 3. Indomethacin (2.8 or 5 mumol/L) did not decrease the contractile effects of the peptides or serotonin. The effects of serotonin were reduced, but not reversed, by methysergide (0.94 mumol/L). 4. Porcine relaxin inhibited field stimulation-induced contractions of costo-uterine muscle and uterine horns from immature rats pretreated with oestradiol cypionate and from stilboestrol-treated mature rats. It was much less potent, and its effects were less clearly concentration-related, on costo-uterine muscle. 5. The inhibitory effects of relaxin on the uterus were unaffected by propranolol (1 mumol/L), confirming that on this tissue relaxin acts independently of the release of catecholamines. Progesterone (30 mumol/L) was also without effect on the action of relaxin on the uterus. 6. These results taken together indicate that the costo-uterine muscle of the rat: (i) contracts in response to serotonin and the peptides angiotensin II, arginine vasopressin, bradykinin and oxytocin independently of the release of the contractile prostaglandins F2 alpha and E2; and (ii) in contrast to the uterus, may lack a significant population of receptors for relaxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "Catecholamines are important in the modulation of smooth muscle contractile activity; this study was undertaken to evaluate adrenoceptor stimulation of intracellular inositol-phosphate production in a genital tract smooth muscle myocyte. DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle myocytes, derived from a hamster ductus deferens leiomyosarcoma, were loaded with 3H-inositol, incubated in 10 mM LiCl, then stimulated with adrenergic agonists with and without antagonists. Subsequently, the inositol phosphates were isolated by anion-exchange chromatography. In the presence of norepinephrine (NE), inositol trisphosphate (IP3) was produced by 30 s and peaked at 2 min; inositol 1-phosphate was also apparent by 30 s, and continued to increase over 15 min. Clonidine (an alpha-2 agonist), isoproterenol, and NE in the presence of phentolamine or prazosin (an alpha-1 antagonist) failed to increase IP3. In contrast, NE in the presence of yohimbine (an alpha-2 antagonist) or propranolol stimulated IP3 production to levels comparable to that stimulated by NE alone. These studies provide evidence that inositol phosphate production is involved in alpha-1 adrenergic signal transduction in DDT1 MF-2 myocyte.", 
    "78": "A behavioral study was performed in an attempt to understand the role of central beta-adrenoceptors in yawning in rats.

The apomorphine-induced yawning was increased by pindolol, propranolol, indenolol, alprenolol and bukumolol which block the central beta-adrenoceptors, but not by the peripheral beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, carteolol and atenolol. These beta-adrenoceptor antagonists given alone did not elicit yawning. Conversely, the yawning was inhibited by salbutamol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, without being affected by prazosin, an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist. The combined administration of SK&F 38393 and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists did not induce yawning. The yawning elicited by either apomorphine or piribedil in combination with pindolol was suppressed by spiperone and YM-09151-2 [cis-N-(1-benzyl-2-methyl-pyrrolidin-3-yl)-5- chloro-2-methoxy-4-methylamino-benzamide], dopamine D2-receptor antagonists, and scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, but not by SCH 23390 [R(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-3- benzazepine-7-ol], a dopamine D1-receptor antagonist.

    "79": "The beta-blocking effects of bopindolol, a new long-acting beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, and its two metabolites, 18-502 and 20-785, were studied in the isolated atria and trachea preparations of the guinea pig. The partial agonist activity (PAA) and the membrane stabilizing activity (MSA) were studied in the pithed rat and the right ventricular papillary muscle preparations of the guinea pig, respectively. Antagonistic effect of bopindolol against isoproterenol was 1.1-2.8 and 14.1 times more potent than propranolol in the atria and the trachea preparations, respectively, while those of 18-502 were 34.7-38.0 (in atria) and 29.0 (in trachea) times more potent than propranolol. beta-Blocking potencies of 20-785 were 50% (in atria) and 10% (in trachea) of those of propranolol. Bopindolol, 18-502 and 20-785 increased the heart rate of the pithed rat dose-dependently. The effects were inhibited by pretreatment of the preparation with propranolol. The onset of action of bopindolol was slower and the duration, longer than those of its two metabolites. Bopindolol and 18-502 were more potent membrane stabilizers than propranolol, while 20-785 produced only a minimal stabilizing effect. These results indicate that not only bopindolol, but also the metabolites of bopindolol, 18-502 and 20-785 are potent beta-blocking agents with PAA. It is presumed that the long duration of action of bopindolol is due to the potent activities of its metabolites 18-502 and 20-785.", 
    "80": "Three nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockers, propranolol, cloranolol and talinolol, were examined in male rats. The amount and function of polysubstrate monooxygenase, serum bilirubin and carbohydrate metabolism were investigated. Doses producing a 25% reduction in heart beat/min were given orally. The effect of a single dose was compared to that of a 12-day treatment period. Propranolol in a single dose did not influence hepatic parameters. The 12-day treatment reduced the amount of cytochrome P-450 (cP-450) and prolonged hexobarbital biotransformation time. Cloranolol decreased cP-450, prolonged hexobarbital anaesthesia and inhibited aminopyrine-N-demethylation (AND) even in a single dose. No further impairment occurred with continued treatment. A single dose of talinolol led to cP-450 loss and inhibited cP-450 dependent liver functions. This inhibition progressed with continued treatment. High bilirubin levels were measured. Both cloranolol and talinolol elicited an initial rapid hyperglycaemia with normal liver glycogen content. At the end of the treatment blood glucose and liver glycogen values were normal. The reversible hyperglycemic reaction shows the necessity of controlling glucose tolerance. When talinolol is administered liver function parameters should be checked in appropriate time intervals.", 
    "81": "Effects of three calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, NIF; verapamil, VER and diltiazem, DIL) and one antiallergic drug, ketotifen (KET) on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced beta 2 adrenergic receptor desensitization and resensitization have been studied with intact human lymphocytes in vitro. While incubation of lymphocytes with 1.0 microM NIF, VER, or DIL alone neither changed [3H]-CGP-12177 binding (Bmax) nor increased cAMP responsiveness to ISO, they all partially prevented 50 nM ISO-induced beta 2 adrenoceptor-adenylate cyclase uncoupling. VER and DIL also partially prevented beta 2 adrenoceptor down-regulation, but NIF did not. In contrast, 10 microM KET not only diminished ISO-induced desensitization but also accelerated subsequent resensitization. KET alone also induced an up-regulation of cell surface beta adrenergic receptors. The effects of these compounds on beta 2 adrenoceptor regulation may partially explain their potentiation of ISO-induced cAMP accumulation in lymphocytes.", 
    "82": "1. The purpose of the study was to assess and compare the effects of inhaled salbutamol on heart rate (HR), finger tremor (Tr) and specific airways conductance (sGaw) in the measurement of beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade in normal subjects. 2. Five healthy volunteers were given oral doses of atenolol 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg (A50, A100, A200), propranolol 40 mg (P40) or identical placebo (P1) in a single-blind crossover design. 3. Three hours after drug ingestion, dose-response curves were constructed using cumulative doses of inhaled salbutamol: 200 micrograms, 700 micrograms, 1700 micrograms, 3200 micrograms, 6200 micrograms. HR, Tr and sGaw were measured at each dose increment, made every 20 min. 4. Increasing doses of atenolol were associated with progressive reduction in salbutamol induced beta-adrenoceptor responses. The greatest attenuation occurred with propranolol. These effects on beta-adrenoceptor responses were similar for HR, Tr and sGaw. Geometric mean dose ratios (compared with placebo) for A50, A100, A200 and P40 were as follows HR: 1.98, 2.75, 4.29; Tr: 1.60, 3.78, 6.34, 80.50; sGaw: 1.08, 4.35, 12.30, 66.0 (no dose ratio was obtained for HR with P40). 5. These results showed that atenolol and propranolol attenuated the effects of salbutamol on HR to a similar degree as Tr and sGaw. Furthermore, the variability was least in the measurement of chronotropic responses, suggesting that this may be used to quantify beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonism. The beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity of atenolol was a dose-dependent phenomenon, although the beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade of A200 was much less than with P40.",

The effect has been compared to previous results of propranolol and to effect of practolol, respectively. It has been established that DL-Chinoin-103-similarly to DL-propranolol but in a little higher concentration--has significantly impeted both basal and total ATP-aze activities. Since in the nase of practolol similar effect was not obsreved and furthermore the effect could not be suspended by isoproterenol, the authors suppose that impediment of sarcolemmal ATP-aze activities cannot primarily be attributed to beta-blocking effect of compounds. Study of effect of racemic Chinoin-103 on enzymatic kinetic parameters of basal and total ATP-aze acticities has shown that primarily the reaction rate had decreased, affinity to substratum had not changed in the case of total ATP-aze and it has moderately decreased in the case of basal ATP-aze. The results of this publication has drawn attention to the fact that some beta-receptor blocking compounds may have other specific membrane effects besides antagonism on beta-receptors.", 
    "84": "Medical records were examined for 1935 patients who presented sequentially to a hypertension clinic between 1971 and 1981. Patients were classified according to whether they were on a beta-blocker, methyldopa, a potassium-losing diuretic, or whether they had discontinued any of these treatments. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated and the relative risks of stopping compared with non-stopping were computed. Those stopping a beta-blocker had a significantly higher mortality in the following year than those who continued, both in men [relative risk (RR) = 5.91, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 2.78-12.56] and women (RR = 5.67, 95% Cl 1.75-18.41). Moreover, women also had a significantly higher mortality when stopping methyldopa, compared with those who continued on the drug (RR = 4.91, 95% Cl 1.82-13.20). However, analysis of data from the years following withdrawal indicated that a high RR was not limited to the first year after the withdrawal of beta-blockers, but was still apparent in the fourth year after stopping. This indicates that the high mortality was not an early function of withdrawal. The high initial RR of mortality in women stopping methyldopa was followed by a substantial decrease in risk over the later years of follow-up. The high mortality in patients stopping particular antihypertensive drugs was not explained by known cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "85": "The adrenergic receptor subtypes mediating the response to sympathetic nerve stimulation in the pulmonary vascular bed of the cat were investigated under conditions of controlled blood flow and constant left atrial pressure. The increase in lobar vascular resistance in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation was reduced by prazosin and to a lesser extent by yohimbine, the respective alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists. Moreover, in animals pretreated with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist to prevent an interaction between alpha- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, responses to nerve stimulation were reduced by prazosin, but yohimbine had no significant effect. On the other hand, in animals pretreated with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine had an inhibitory effect on responses to tyramine and to norepinephrine. Propranolol had no significant effect on the response to nerve stimulation, whereas ICI 118551, a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, enhanced responses to nerve stimulation and injected norepinephrine. The present data suggest that neuronally released norepinephrine increases pulmonary vascular resistance in the cat by acting mainly on alpha 1-adrenoceptors and to a lesser extent on postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors but that this effect is counteracted by an action on presynaptic alpha 2-receptors. The present studies also suggest that neuronally released norepinephrine acts on beta 2-adrenoceptors and that the response to sympathetic nerve stimulation represents the net effect of the adrenergic transmitter on alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta 2-adrenoceptors in the pulmonary vascular bed.", 
    "86": "In order to gain further knowledge about the potential role of catecholamines in mammary carcinoma, we have used the potent beta-adrenergic antagonist cyanopindolol (CYP) as iodinated ligand to characterize beta-adrenergic receptors in membranes prepared from mammary tumors induced by dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) administration in the rat. The binding of [125I]CYP to membrane preparations of DMBA-induced rat mammary tumors is rapid at room temperature, reaching half maximal specific binding at 30 min of incubation. Scatchard analysis of the data indicates that [125I]CYP binds to a single class of high affinity sites (114 +/- 2.1 fmoles/mg protein) at an apparent KD value of 38.0 +/- 0.3 pM. The order of potency of a series of agonists to compete for [125I]CYP binding is consistent with interaction with a beta 2-subtype receptor: zinterol greater than (-)isoproterenol greater than (-)epinephrine much greater than (-)norepinephrine. In addition, the potency of a series of specific beta 1 and beta 2 synthetic compounds to displace [125I]CYP in mammary tumors is similar to their potency in typical beta 2-adrenergic tissues. The binding of [125I]CYP to DMBA-induced rat mammary tumors shows a marked stereoselectivity, the (-)isomers of isoproterenol and propranolol being 150 and 80 times more potent, respectively, than their respective enantiomers. The autoradiographic localization of [125I]CYP performed on frozen sections revealed the presence of specific beta-adrenergic receptors in all the malignant cells. Spontaneous mammary tumors of aging (18-22 months) female rats have high levels of beta-adrenergic receptors. Castration decreased the concentration of [125I]CYP binding sites in DMBA-induced mammary tumors. A close correlation was observed between progressing, static, and regressing tumors after ovariectomy and beta-adrenergic receptor concentration. The presence of beta-adrenergic receptors in mammary tumors as well as the modulation of their level by ovarian hormones provides a mechanism for catecholaminergic influence in mammary cancer tissue.", 
    "87": "The effect of local X irradiation on cardiac alpha and beta receptors was studied in Wistar rats. Animals were given local heart irradiation with single doses of 15 or 20 Gy and were examined after a range of latency times of 7 to 400 days. Using the radioactive ligands [3H]CGP-12177 and [3H]prazosin, the maximal binding capacity was determined from saturation experiments. At 7 days after 20 Gy the maximal binding capacity of both alpha and beta receptors was reduced to below the level of untreated control animals. Subsequently it rose continually to a maximum of 160% of the control level for beta receptors and 130% for alpha receptors at 400 days postirradiation. The antagonist affinity as judged from the dissociation constant for [3H]CGP 12177 and [3H]prazosin did not change significantly. A similar effect was observed after 15 Gy. An increase in adrenergic receptors may represent an important pathogenetic link between early morphological and late functional changes in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced heart disease.", 
    "88": "Short-term studies indicate that the side-effects of adrenergic beta-receptor blockade may be influenced by lipid solubility and receptor selectivity of the blockers. The aim of the present study was to investigate the extent to which lipid solubility and receptor selectivity are related to the occurrence of symptoms during ordinary beta-blocker treatment in out-patients. Two hundred and five patients (mean age 60 years) on beta-blockade were interviewed about their symptoms. Eighty-five per cent of the patients had been on beta-blocker treatment for more than 1 year. The blockers most commonly used were atenolol (51.0%), timolol (20.0%), propranolol (18.5%) and metoprolol (7.8%). beta-Blocker treatment was associated with a significantly increased frequency of central nervous system and peripheral symptoms. The increase in central nervous system symptoms was significantly smaller in those on beta-blockers with low rather than with intermediate (P = 0.015) or high lipid solubility (P = 0.007). The increase in peripheral symptoms was not significantly different with beta 1-selective and non-selective blockers. The results indicate that the liability of beta-blockers to cause side-effects on the central nervous system is determined partly by their lipid solubility, and that receptor selectivity has only a small impact on their tendency to cause peripheral side-effects.", 
    "89": "Cats were anesthetized with alpha-chloralose and pentylenetetrazol, 10 and/or 20 mg were administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) to elicit epileptiform activity, including both interictal and ictal discharges. Timolol, 10, 100, 500 micrograms/kg i.c.v. and 1, 5, 10 and/or 20 mg/kg i.v., was administered at 5 min intervals to determine whether it suppressed the epileptiform activity. Mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate increased after the administration of pentylenetetrazol; these increases were associated with the development of epileptiform activity and cardiac arrhythmias. All doses of timolol caused a decrease in the blood pressure and heart rate elevated by pentylenetetrazol and suppressed the epileptiform activity. Similar findings were obtained in cats that received the same doses of timolol administered at different time intervals. The data indicate that the central administration of timolol reverses the epileptiform activity of pentylenetetrazol in the brain and suppresses the associated increases in blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac arrhythmias.", 
    "90": "When a published clinical report concludes that there is no difference between two or more groups of patients, the reader must discern between two alternative possibilities. Either there is truly no difference in outcome between the groups or the study failed to detect an actual difference. The application of sample size and power calculations to outcome variables in a clinical study can provide essential insight into resolving this ambiguity. While one can never prove that there is no difference between groups of patients, these techniques can estimate the likelihood that a particular study will detect or fail to detect a difference of specified size."
