    "0": "The previous finding that chlorothiazide (about 250 mg/day) induces a sustained reduction in the polyuria of homozygous Brattleboro (BB) female rats, as well as an increase to about 250% of plasma renin activity was confirmed. Disruption of the renin-angiotensin system by either the angiotensin antagonist saralasin or the beta-blocking agent propranolol does not interfere with chlorothiazide antidiuresis. Each inhibitor reduces BB polyuria on its own, an effect which, however, may be explained by a possible interference with thirst.", 
    "1": "The antihypertensive effect of 2,000 mg of acebutolol investigated with an acute 48 hr test in 60 diabetic and 60 non-diabetic in-patients with essential hypertension. In hypertensive diabetic patients, acebutolol was induced a significant fall in blood pressure similar to that observed in non-diabetics. The acute antihypertensive effect of acebutolol was not uniform in hypertensive subjects: a significant decrease of blood pressure was observed in 34 diabetics and 31 non-diabetic patients. Fifteen out of the 34 diabetic responders to the 48 hr test were treated by acebutolol alone for six months; a highly significant correlation between the acute and the chronic antihypertensive effect of the beta-blocker was observed. As long-term results paralleled those of the short-term experiment, acute acebutolol administration appears to be a rapid means to select hypertensive diabetics sensitive or resistant to betablockers. Plasma renin activity was not found to give, in hypertensive diabetics, a reliable predictive index of the response to acute administration of acebutolol.", 
    "2": "Single oral doses of propranolol (120 mg), metoprolol (150 mg) and placebo were given in a randomised, double-blind fashion to 23 patients with essential tremor. Both beta blockers were significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the magnitude of tremor. The decrease in tremor produced by metoprolol (47, sem 9%, n = 23) was not significantly different from that observed propranolol (55, sem 5%, n = 23). Tachycardia on standing was antagonised by both drugs to a similar extent. These findings suggest that metoprolol may represent a valuable alternative to propranolol in the treatment of essential tremor. The data is consistent with the hypothesis that the tremorolytic effect of beta blockers in these patients may be unrelated to peripheral beta-2 adreno-receptor blockade, being possibly mediated by other central or peripheral modes of action of these drugs. However, it cannot be excluded that at the dose used, metoprolol had lost its relative cardio-selectivity and that the reduction in tremor was mediated by competitive antagonism at beta-2 receptor sites in skeletal muscle.", 
    "3": "A randomised, double-masked clinical study was conducted in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma to determine if timolol and epinephrine have an additive effect in lowering intraocular pressure. Sixteen patients were randomly assigned to one of 2 treatment sequences (timolol alone, supplemented after 2 weeks with epinephrine, and vice versa). An initial additive effect in lowering intraocular pressure was found in both sequences. However, after several weeks of combined therapy complete loss of additive effect was found. Patients who were treated first with epinephrine for 2 weeks and then supplemented with timolol had significantly lower intraocular pressures for at least 2 weeks than patients in the reverse treatment sequence. Epinephrine treatment alone caused a significant increase in facility of outflow, but this effect did not occur with simultaneous timolol treatment. The results are discussed in terms of possible fundamental beta and alpha adrenergic influences on aqueous dynamics and their potential clinical relevance.", 
    "4": "The authors examined the effects of controlled hypotension induced with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) with and without propranolol on the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renin-angiotensin systems in 10 consecutive anesthetized patients with kyphoscoliosis undergoing posterior spinal fusion. SNP infusion (4.1 microgram . kg-1 . min-1) alone decreased mean systemic arterial pressure (SAP) by 25 torr +/- 3 SE (P less than 0.001), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) by 1113 dyne . sec. cm-5 . m2 +/- 125 SE (P less than 0.001), mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) by 6 torr +/- 2 SE (P less than 0.02), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) by 4 torr +/- 1 SE (P less than 0.01), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by 50 dyne . sec . cm-5 +/- 18 (P less than 0.05), and PaO2 by 16 torr +/- 7 SE (P less than 0.05), whereas cardiac index increased by 1.08 l . min-1 . m2 +/- 0.24 SE (P less than 0.01) and heart rate increased 16 beats/min +/- 5 SE (P less than 0.02). After 40 min of hypotension, 0.03 mg/kg propranolol was injected intravenously while the SNP infusion rate was held constant. Ten min later there was a significant decrease in the heart rate (10 beats/min +/- 4 SE, P less than 0.02) and cardiac index (0.65 l . min-1 . m-2 +/- 0.21, P less than 0.02). Plasma renin activity (PRA) increased from 2.37 ng . ml-1 . h-1 +/- 0.7 SE before anesthesia to 6.50 ng . ml-1 . h-1 +/- 1.45 SE (P less than 0.05) after 40 min of nitroprusside infusion. Forty min after propranolol there was a significant reduction in PRA to 4.07 ng . ml-1 . h-1 +/- 0.73 SE (P less than 0.05). Thus propranolol, when given during SNP hypotension, exhibits an early cardiovascular response manifested as a decrease in cardiac output and heart rate and a delayed action of the kidney resulting in an inhibition of renin release.", 
    "5": "Previous studies have shown that there is both a significant shortening in platelet survival and a measured hyperactivity to platelet-aggregating agents in patients with documented coronary artery disease compared with control groups. We used a recently described radioimmunoassay for the platelet-secreted protein platelet factor 4 (PF4) to study 162 patients with documented coronary artery disease. There was a significant increase in plasma PF4 concentrations in patients with documented coronary artery disease compared with angiographically normal patients (8.7 vs 16 ng/ml, respectively, n = 121), but as in previous studies of platelet survival, we could not correlate elevated plasma PF4 concentration and the severity or site of the coronary artery disease. In addition, there was no correlation with left ventricular function, serum cholesterol or the type of angina. Patients with confirmed acute myocardial infarction had no significant difference in mean plasma PF4 concentrations compared with similar groups of coronary disease patients who had prolonged chest pain or chronic stable angina. Coronary artery bypass grafting in a subgroup of patients did not affect the mean plasma PF4 concentration during 1 year of follow-up after bypass surgery, but medical therapy for angina with increasing doses of propranolol and nitrates significantly reduced PF4 concentration in another subgroup of patients who were not considered to be candidates for surgical therapy.", 
    "6": "Quantitative histometric methods were used to established the relationships between the extent of thyroid lymphocytic infiltration at operation, and outcome exactly 18 months later in 50 surgically-treated Graves' disease patients prepared by carbimazole and triiodothyronine. Periods of pre-operative treatment, surgical technique, histometric analysis and diagnostic criteria were all standardised. Controls (107) were obtained from the forensic laboratory. Thirty-seven patients became euthyroid, but there was no relationship between outcome and epithelial or lymphoid content of the thyroid gland. Neither was there any correlation between the size of lymphoid infiltrate and epithelial mass of the resected thyroids, suggesting that simple lymphocyte infiltrations do not replace thyroid tissue as once thought. The variation in thyroid epithelial content was nearly 3-fold, so that a surgeon, even if able accurately to judge the anatomical mass of the remnant, would still have little or no idea of its functional mass. The scatter of epithelial content was even greater in glands from patients prepared for surgery by propranolol alone (38 glands, variation X 5.5) or propranolol and iodide (32 glands, variation X 5.9). Outcome after sub-total thyroidectomy for Graves' disease seems unrelated to the lymphocyte content of the gland and it is questionable to what extent the surgeon can either predict or control the outcome of thyroidectomy in individual Graves' disease patients.", 
    "7": "Ten patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease were treated with sodium ipodate (1 g daily) in addition to propranolol (P) plus propylthiouracil (PTU; 100 mg every 8 h) and were compared with a control group of 8 patients treated with P and PTU. Patients on P and PTU had a mean (+/- SEM) basal free T3 index of 387 +/- 59 (normal, 70--160) compared with that of 409 +/- 47 (P greater than 0.05) in the sodium ipodate group. The respective basal free T4 index values (normal, 4.5-10.9) were 21.3 +/- 2.8 for the controls and 25.9 +/- 2.8 for the ipodate group (P greater than 0.5), and the basal rT3 values were 192 +/- 49 and 210 +/- 41 (normal, 16--50 ng/dl; P greater than 0.05). The average percent changes in each thyroid index and rT3 were calculated. The first 3 days on P and PTU served as the basal period for the control group, and comparisons were made to the following 9 days. The ipodate group received P and PTU for 2.7 +/- 3.0 days, and comparisons were made with the interval on ipodate, P, and PTU (mean, 9.1 +/- 0.9 days). For the free T3 index, the control group showed a mean decrement of 20.5 +/- 4.4% compared with 50.2 +/- 3.1% for the ipodate group (P less than 0.001). The respective free T4 index decrements were 14.5 +/- 4.4% and 18.5 +/- 2.7% (P greater than 0.05). The respective changes in rT3 were -13.4 +/- 7.6% and +140 +/- 26.9% (P less than 0.001). In patients with hyperthyroidism, short term daily therapy with sodium ipodate plus P and PTU produces a greater reduction of free T3 index values than that caused by P and PTU alone.", 
    "8": "The T-wave characteristics, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output and blood pressure were examined in acidosis-prone Pietrain and acidosis-resistant Gloucester Old Spot pigs, before and after autonomic blockade with propranolol, atropine and phentolamine. Assessments were made at normal arterial blood pH and pCO2, and at either the same age or live weight in the two breeds. T-wave amplitude was influenced by alpha-adrenergic activity in the absence of beta-adrenergic and parasympathetic receptor activation. The initial cardiac output was 25% greater in the Pietrains, and 75% of this breed difference was due to autonomic factors. Myocardial chronotropic responsiveness to noradrenaline was similar in the two breeds. Initial blood pressure was greater in the Gloucester Old Spots because of a non-autonomic factor, and vasopressor responsiveness to noradrenaline was greater in the Gloucester Old Spots. Although acidosis-prone pigs may be afforded some degree of protection from a sympathetic crisis by having a low vasopressor responsiveness to adrenoreceptor stimulation, enhanced catecholamine output is the likely cause of their stress-induced myocardial lesions. A high catecholamine output may also account for the reduced body fatness in this type of pig.", 
    "9": "The electrophysiological properties of of 0,6 mg/Kg SOTALOL administered intravenously were studied in 15 subjects aged between 32 and 81 years. The following parameters were recorded: sinus rate (SR), corrected sinus node recovery time (SNRT), sinoatrial conduction time (SACT), PA interval, right atrial effective refractory period (ERP), right atrial functional refractory period (FRP), AH interval at rest, at 100 bpm, Luciani-Wenckebach point (LWP), AV node ERP and FRP, HV interval, His-Purkinje ERP, right ventricular ERP, corrected QT interval. At this dosage, intravenous SOTALOL displays two types of behaviour: --That common to the betablocker drugs: slowing SR by 16%, increasing the AV nodal conduction, increasing the AH interval at rest (5%), at 100 bpm (23%), increasing AV nodal ERP (26%) and FRP (20%), decreasing the LWP (18%). --Other properties: increasing intraatrial PA interval (3%), increasing right atrial ERP (II%), FRP (I7%), increasing right ventricular ERP (8%), increasing His-Purkinje ERP (when measurable) (about 6%), no change in corrected QT interval. At this dosage, SOTALOL exhibits electrophysiological behaviour similar to drugs in Class III (Touboul): those with a \"wide electrophysiological spectrum\".", 
    "10": "The effect of a single oral 40 mg dose of propranolol on ventilatory responses to symptom-limited maximal exercise were studied in 14 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and in four normal volunteers. In both groups, there was significant reduction of carbon dioxide production, minute ventilation, and respiratory exchange ratio at matched workloads. Propranolol did not affect oxygen uptake at matched workloads. A possible explanation of these findings was that propranolol, as a result of beta blockade, inhibited stimulation of glucose metabolism during exercise. Such an effect may diminish ability of CAD patients taking propranolol to obtain beneficial results of an exercise training program.", 
    "11": "Capping provides a rapid assay for the transduction of 1 type of membrane signal generated by the cross-linking of cell surface receptors. The order of the steps comprising this signal was determined by employing reversible inhibitors of lymphocyte surface Ig capping in a sequential incubation protocol. The results demonstrated that surface Ig cross-linking leads to capping by a linear series of discrete events. Although the steps inhibited by the calcium ionophore A23187 and the tranquilizer chlorpromazine could not be distinguished, other agents also thought to influence calcium distribution in the cell acted at different steps. The order of inhibited steps was shown to be: 1) hydrocortisone; 2) calcium ionophore or chlorpromazine; 3) cytochalasins; 4) dibucaine; 5) propranolol; 6) fluoride; 7) azide. These results suggest a model wherein cross-linked membrane Ig aggregates engage the preassembled microfilament system by means of a calcium-dependent linkage. Further calcium redistribution within the cell then leads to an energy-consuming contractile event.", 
    "12": "1. The effects of thyroid status on the specific binding of the muscarinic ligand (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) and of the beta-adrenoreceptor ligand (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) in the adult rat lung were investigated. 2. The specific binding of (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) to lung membranes was saturable and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) determined from Scatchard analysis was 54 pM. Kinetic analysis of the binding of [3H]QNB yielded a KD of 42 pM. [3H]QNB binding was inhibited by muscarinic agonists and antagonists, the order of their potency was l-hyoscyamine greater than atropine greater than scopolamine greater than oxotremorine greater than carbachol. These data were consistent with [3H]QNB binding to the muscarine receptor. 3. Adult male rats treated for 2 weeks with the antithyroid agent 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ) showed a 52% and 80% reduction in the serum concentration of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) respectively. These hypothyroid rats also had a 39% decrease in the concentration of lung beta-adrenoreceptors and a 37% decrease in the concentration of lung muscarinic receptors as compared to euthyroid controls. Concurrent treatment of rats with ATZ and T4 for 2 weeks resulted in a reduction of 15% and 20% in the concentration of lung beta-adrenoreceptors and muscarinic receptors respectively. The KD values for [3H]DHA and [3H]QNB binding did not change with the ATZ or ATZ+T4 treated groups. 4. Administration of T4 (500 micrograms/kg/day) to male rats for 12 days did not result in any significant change in the concentration of either beta-adrenoreceptors or muscarinic receptors compared to euthyroid controls. No change in the KD values for [3H]DHA or [3H]QNB binding were detected. 5. The results show that hypothyroid rats have a reduced lung concentration of both beta-adrenoreceptors and muscarinic receptors whereas in hyperthyroid rats these receptors do not significantly change from euthyroid controls.", 
    "13": "Thyroid hormones are known to enhance normal erythroid colony growth (CFUE) and this enhancement depends on a functional beta 2-adrenergic receptor mechanism. we investigated the response of Friend cells to thyroid hormones, catecholamines, and other compounds influencing cellular cAMP activity. The thyroid hormones L-T3, L-T4, and \"reverse T3\" stimulated erythroleukemia colony growth in a serum-substituted methylcellulose culture system with peak activity at 10(-7) M. Various beta-adrenergic compounds enhanced Friend leukemia colony growth; however, the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine was inactive. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline also enhanced Friend leukemia colony formation. Adrenergic antagonists with beta 2 specificity abrogated the stimulatory effect of L-T3, L-T4, and of \"reverse T3\" at equimolar concentrations. These experiments demonstrate that thyroid hormones, beta-adrenergic agonists, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline, and dbcAMP have a direct effect on the proliferation of Friend erythroleukemia cells. We conclude that thyroid hormones' action requires a functioning beta 2-adrenergic receptor mechanism. Thyroid hormones directly modulate the growth of neoplastic erythroid cells in a manner consistent with their effects on normal erythropoiesis.", 
    "14": "In eyes with pupillotony (Argyll Robertson) the effect of locally applied timolol maleate (0.5%) on intraocular pressure is considerably less pronounced than in normal control eyes. In Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis the timolol response is the same as in controls. Infrared thermography of the anterior segment of the eye showed that the maximum drop in IOP was preceded by a fall in temperature. These findings suggest that the IOP-lowering effect of timolol depends on parasympathetic innervation and that timolol decreases the blood flow in the ciliary body.", 
    "15": "Cardiac beta-adrenoceptors were studied in membrane fractions from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and rats with two-kidney, one clip hypertension (2K, 1C HT), using radioligand binding method. beta-Adrenoceptor concentration measured by [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding was significantly lower in cardiac membranes from two months old SHR than those from Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) (38.2 +/- 2.6 vs 45.1 +/- 1.8 fmol/mg protein, means +/- SEM, p less than 0.05). Cardiac membranes from 2K, 1C HT rats had also a lower concentration of beta-adrenoceptors than those from the sham-operated control rats at a week after operation (30.9 +/- 2.2 vs 47.8 +/- 1.6 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.01). But receptor affinity remained unchanged. These reduced concentrations of beta-adrenoceptors were restored to control levels at 12 months old in SHR and at 6 weeks after operation in 2K, 1C HT rats, although age-dependent decrease in beta-adrenoceptor was observed. The decrease in beta-adrenoceptor was associated with increase in plasma noradrenaline levels during the earlier stages of hypertension. But there is no correlation between beta-adrenoceptor concentrations and plasma noradrenaline levels in the chronic stages of hypertension. No significant difference was found in activities of 5'-nucleotidase, which is a marker enzyme of cell membrane, in membrane fractions between the hypertensive hearts and the controls, suggesting that the cardiac hypertrophy is not a determinant factor for change in beta-adrenoceptor. The observed decrease in beta-adrenoceptor concentration may reflect an increase in sympathetic nerve activity during development of hypertension. In the chronic stages of hypertension, additional factors may be involved in the restoration of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "16": "1 Relationship between plasma catecholamines (measured as noradrenaline and adrenaline) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were examined at rest and during passive head-up tilting for 30 min in nine normal subjects, before and after treatment with propranolol 160 mg daily for 7 days. 2 Noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) increased substantially after tilting for 15 min. There were no changes in PRA. After 30 min tilting, NA remained elevated, whereas A had returned to resting levels. A significant increase in PRA was apparent at 30 min. Pulse rate and diastolic blood pressure increased progressively during tilting. Systolic pressure did not change. 3 Treatment with propranolol reduced pulse rate and systolic blood pressure at rest and during tilting. Resting catecholamine concentrations and the response of NA to tilting were unaffected. In contrast, treatment prolonged the A response leading to significantly higher levels after 30 min tilting. Propranolol reduced PRA in six of the nine subjects and prevented the increase with tilting observed before treatment.", 
    "17": "Norepinephrine is known to inhibit its own release from presynaptic nerve terminals through alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, which presumably have a presynaptic localization. alpha 2-Adrenergic receptors (as determined by [3H]clonidine binding) appear in rat submandibular gland membranes following reserpine treatment. These alpha 2 receptors seem to be localized postsynaptically, based on the following evidence. (1) Partial destruction of the presynaptic nerve terminals with 6-hydroxydopamine did not decrease the density of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors following subsequent reserpine administration. (2) Duct ligation, which results in atrophy of the gland, markedly decreased the density of the receptors following subsequent reserpine administration. (3) Surgical denervation resulted in the appearance of high levels of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. (4) The changes in alpha 2 receptors paralleled the changes in postsynaptic beta-adrenergic receptor binding (as determined by [3H]dihydroalprenolol). While these results establish the existence of postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in an innervated tissue, the concomitant presence of a low density of presynaptic alpha 2 receptors has not been eliminated.", 
    "18": "We have used the primed-constant infusion of [6-3H]glucose to study the effects of phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, and propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, on glucose production and clearance in gastrostomy-fed control, septic (repeated sub-Q Escherichia coli injections), and burned (25-30% BSA) guinea pigs. Hypermetabolism and elevated glucoregulatory hormones were evident in both traumatized models, whereas their glucose kinetic response was different. Basal glucose production and clearance were elevated in the burned group and were depressed in the septic group when compared to control values. Propranolol caused a further increase in glucose production and clearance in the burned group, whereas it depressed glucose production and clearance to an even greater extent in the septic group. Phentolamine also produced an increase in glucose production and clearance in the burned group. In the septic group, phentolamine had no significant effect on glucose production, but clearance was significantly elevated. Thus, although alpha- or beta-adrenergic blockade normalized metabolic rate in both groups with respect to control animals, glucose kinetics remained different despite similar changes in counterregulatory hormones.", 
    "19": "The effects of three doses (5, 30, and 60 mg/kg) of morphine on pupillary diameter (PD) were studied in rats that were either normal, neurotransmitter antagonist pretreated, guanethidine pretreated, cervical sympathectomized, or adrenalectomized. Morphine produced a dose-dependent increase in PD and exophthalmos. In addition, the PD concurrently underwent fluctuations. alpha-Adrenergic antagonists blocked both mydriasis and exophthalmos, whereas a beta-adrenergic antagonist had no significant effect. This suggested a role for the sympathetic nervous system. However, cervical sympathectomy or guanethidine pretreatment only partially blocked the increase in PD or exophthalmos. Adrenalectomy also partially blocked the mydriasis and exophthalmos. Adrenalectomy combined with guanethidine pretreatment completely blocked morphine-induced mydriasis but no exophthalmos. Thus, the results suggest that both direct sympathetic innervation and hormonal action from the adrenals are involved in morphine-induced mydriasis in the rat.", 
    "20": "Evidence based on the ability to accumulate [3H]noradrenaline by a mechanism sensitive to desmethylimipramine suggests that there is a period of hyperinnervation of the cerebellum by noradrenergic fibres around the beginning of the second postnatal week. Different developmental profiles for specific noradrenaline uptake and noradrenaline content indicate that invasion of the tissue by noradrenergic fibres precedes their full acquisition of transmitter. Developmental increases in the density of beta-receptors and adenyl cyclase responsiveness to isoproterenol lags behind those of the presynaptic components and does not begin until the hyperinnervation is declining around day 12.", 
    "21": "The ontogeny of beta-adrenergic receptors was investigated in the pineal glands of rats 1-64 days of age. The density of beta-receptors increased about 3-fold between 1 and 16 days of age and decreased slightly by 64 days, correlating temporally with the development of the sensitivity of adenylate cyclase to norepinephrine in pineal gland. Preventing adrenergic innervation of the pineal gland by neonatal ganglionectomy or decentralization failed to prevent the development of beta-adrenergic receptors in pineal gland. Bilateral adrenal demedullation alone or in combination with ganglionectomy also failed to prevent the normal developmental increase of beta-receptors in the gland. These results, showing that the ontogeny of pineal beta-receptors correlated temporally with that of the responsiveness of adenylate cyclase to adrenergic neurohormones, support the hypothesis that the responsiveness of tissues ot beta-agonists is dependent on the development of the beta-receptor. In addition, these experiments show that the beta-adrenergic receptor can develop even in the absence of sympathetic innervation or circulating catecholamines produced by the adrenal medullae.", 
    "22": "Repetitive oral administration of propranolol to rats (100 mg/kg/day for 5 days) resulted in a marked inhibition of hepatic microsomal metabolism of propranolol when incubated at low initial substrate concentrations (less than 2 microM). Associated with the inhibition of propranolol metabolism was a significant reduction in metabolites derived from naphthalene ring oxidation and an increased formation of N-desisopropylpropranolol. In vivo studies after propranolol pretreatment resulted in: an increased hepatic concentration and an increased systemic availability of propranolol; a decreased hepatic and plasma concentration of polar metabolites; and an increased plasma concentration of metabolites derived from propranolol N-dealkylation. Propranolol was converted both in vitro and in vivo by a hepatic microsomal mixed-function oxidase to a reactive metabolite capable of covalently binding with microsomal macromolecules. We propose that selective covalent binding of the reactive intermediate to the molecular form of cytochrome P-450 that ring hydroxylates propranolol would account for the marked inhibition of propranolol metabolism in vitro and for the increased systemic availability of propranolol in vivo after pretreatment.", 
    "23": "Microdissected rat median eminences (wet weight, 110 micrograms) were electrically stimulated in vitro in the presence of bacitracin and bovine serum albumin. Incubation media collected at 20-min intervals, were assayed for corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) with dispersed pituitary cells and for arginine vasopressin (AVP) by a specific RIA. CRF activity of the media or of synthetic AVP was plotted as function of AVP content. Dose (AVP)-response (CRF) curves for media were not significantly different from those of synthetic AVP. Extracts of incubated median eminences had 3 times more CRF activity then the AVP contained within these extracts, showing that CRF distinct from AVP ws contained within the median eminences but had not been released into or had been degraded within the media. In the presence of 1 mM ascorbic acid, AVP release was not significantly different from AVP release in the absence of ascorbic acid, but accounted for only 49-67% of released CRF activity, suggesting that a CRF distinct from AVP had been released into or protected within the medium. At an AVP level similar to that found in hypophysial portal plasma, the total CRF activity of median eminence media were not significantly different in the presence or absence of 0.13 microM haloperidol or 1.3 microM propranolol in ascorbic acid-rich media, but were 12-17% (P less than 0.05) lower in the presence of 0.35 microM phentolamine. The results indicate that CRFs, distinct from AVP, released from the median eminence in vitro can be detected only when ascorbic acid is present in the medium, and furthermore, that AVP and some alpha-adrenergic agonist account for at least 61-84% of released CRF activity.", 
    "24": "Peripheral administration of the alpha-adrenergic agonist clonidine (0.5 mg/kg, sc) evoked a 2- to 3-fold rise (0.22 +/- 0.03 to 0.59 +/- 0.05 ng/ml) in plasma levels of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-END-LI) 15-30 min later in intact, but not hypophysectomized, rats. This rise in plasma beta-END-LI, which was dose dependent up to 0.5 mg/kg clonidine, appeared to be mediated by activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors, since pretreatment with the alpha-adrenergic antagonists yohimbine (1 mg/kg, ip), phentolamine (1, 3, or 10 mg/kg, kp), or phenoxybenzamine (2 and 10 mg/kg, ip) partially or fully blocked clonidine's effect. By contrast, the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (1 and 5 mg/kg, ip) did not modify the clonidine-induced increased in plasma beta-END-LI. Given alone, the adrenergic blocking drugs were generally without effect on plasma levels of beta-END-LI. Clonidine appeared to be acting on the brain (or pituitary), since the intracerebroventricular injection of phenoxybenzamine (20 microgram) blocked the drug-induced rise in plasma beta-END-LI. These data suggest an alpha-adrenergic mechanism influences the release of pituitary beta-END in the rat.", 
    "25": "Rest and exercise radionuclide angiocardiographic measurements of left ventricular function were obtained in 496 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization for chest pain. Two hundred forty-eight of these patients also had an exercise treadmill test. An ejection fraction less than 50% was the abnormality of resting left ventricular function that provided the greatest diagnostic information. In patients with normal resting left ventricular function, exercise abnormalities that were optimal for diagnosis of coronary artery disease were an injection fraction at least 6% less than predicted, an increase greater than 20 ml in end-systolic volume and the appearance of an exercise-induced wall motion abnormality. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were lower in patients who were taking propranolol at the time of study and in patients who failed to achieve an adequate exercise end point. In the 387 patients with an optimal study, the test had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 58%. Radionuclide angiocardiography was more sensitive and less specific than the exercise treadmill test. The high degree of sensitivity of the radionuclide test suggests that it is most appropriately applied to patient groups with a high prevalence of disease, including those considered for cardiac catheterization.", 
    "26": "The effect of exercise on the urinary excretion of albumin, beta 2-microglobulin, renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was studied in two groups of young patients with mild essential hypertension, one comprising nine untreated patients (1) and one comprising eight patients treated with propranolol (2), and in a group comprising ten normotensive healthy control subjects (3). The urinary excretion of albumin and beta 2-microglobulin, RPF and GFR were measured during four consecutive periods: a control period of 40 min; two exercise periods of 20 min each, with a load of 75 W and 100 W, respectively; and a control period. During exercise group 1 showed an increase in albumin excretion and a decrease in beta 2-microglobulin excretion, while group 2 showed an increase in albumin excretion during heavy exercise only and unchanged beta 2-microglobulin excretion, and group 3 showed unchanged albumin and beta 2-microglobulin excretion. RPF and GFR were reduced during exercise in all groups, most markedly in the hypertensive groups. During both exercise loads albumin excretion was higher and RPF was lower in group 1 than in 3. In group 2 albumin excretion was lower than in 1 during the light exercise load, whereas RPF and GFR were lower during both exercise loads. It is concluded that young patients with mild essential hypertension have both an abnormally high albumin excretion and an abnormally low RPF during exercise. During propranolol therapy urinary albumin excretion was partly normal. The changes in albumin excretion suggest glomerular leakage.", 
    "27": "The effects of intravenous infusion of the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug labetalol (100 mg over 10 min) on heart rate, blood pressure, and several endocrine and metabolic variables have been evaluated in 12 hypertensive patients (6 men and 6 women). Drug administration was associated with significant lowering of heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in comparison with a control study performed with saline infusion. Plasma glucose was significantly increased, while no changes were observed in serum-free fatty acids, insulin, C-peptide, and growth hormone levels. Serum prolactin concentration was significantly increased in the whole group, a marked rise occurred in females, while only a trend upward was observed in males. The acute lowering of blood pressure suggests a predominant activity on alpha-adrenoceptors following intravenous labetalol infusion, although the reduction in heart rate is consistent with the beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect of the drug. Although the reason for the increase in plasma glucose is not apparent, it might depend on the rise in norepinephrine levels observed after labetalol. Stimulation of prolactin release by intravenous labetalol is not easily attributable to interference with adrenergic receptors. The mechanism of this action of the drug is presently obscure, although a possible antidopaminergic activity of labetalol might be involved.", 
    "28": "We measured intraarterial, ambulatory blood pressure over a 24-h period in 12 subjects 24--63 years (mean 47.6) of age with newly diagnosed untreated hypertension. Measurements were performed both before and after 2--9 months of once-daily treatment with atenolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. Significant reductions in arterial pressure (p less than 0.005) during treatment with atenolol (dose range 50--200 mg) were observed over the full 24-h period.", 
    "29": "We studied the effects of intravenous injections of three beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on cardiac automaticity in conscious dogs after sinoatrial node (SAN) excision. Injections were repeated for 60 days postoperatively. In controls, mean corrected sinoatrial node recovery time (CSNRT) was 535 +/- 24 ms. One milligram per kilogram of dl-propranolol did not modify heart rate but raised CSNRT (p less than 0.01). One-half milligram per kilogram of dl-pindolol raised heart rate (p less than 0.05) and reduced CSNRT (p less than 0.05). Ten milligrams per kilogram of dl-practolol were needed to significantly reduce heart rate and raise CSNRT (p less than 0.01). In dogs after SAN excision, 0.1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg of dl-propranolol lowered heart rate on days 3, 30, 43, and 60. Corrected recovery time (CRT) at a cumulative dose of 0.5 mg/kg rose to 9015 +/- 1028 ms on day 3 and to 3064 +/- 810 ms on day 30 (p less than 0.001). dl-Pindolol stabilized the rhythm. With 0.1 mg/kg, heart rate and CRT were not modified significantly on days 9 and 46. dl-Practolol at cumulative doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg lowered heart rate significantly on days 7 and 46. On day 12, the same doses did not modify heart rate but raised CRT (p less than 0.05). This suggests that of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists studied here pindolol may be preferable in treatment of certain supraventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "30": "Previous studies have suggested that prazosin is a selective post-synaptic alpha-receptor blocker. It has also been suggested that it may have greater blocking actions on arterioles than on venous beds. These aspects have been investigated in cats anesthetized with pentobarbital. Prazosin had no effect on conductance in the acutely denervated hindlimb bed but caused a slowly developing vasoconstriction in the acutely denervated intestinal bed. The vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were reduced to a similar extent in both vascular beds. Since maximal doses of prazosin produce only partial block of the alpha-receptor responses, there may be more than one type of postsynaptic alpha-receptor, and it is suggested that the postsynaptic receptors are of both alpha 1- and alpha 2-types. In the intestinal bed, prazosin produced similar reductions in both resistance and capacitance responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation. In isolated guinea pig aorta and portal vein, prazosin blocked the responses to noradrenaline competitively, and the pA3 values for the aorta and portal vein were similar. Thus, no selectivity for resistance vessels compared to capacitance vessels could be demonstrated in the intestine, and this result is compared to our previous observations in the liver. Although prazosin only reduced the vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation in the intestine, phenoxybenzamine reversed the response to a beta-receptor-mediated vasodilatation, as reported some years ago. These observations support our earlier hypothesis that nerve stimulation does not normally activate beta-receptors, but after phenoxybenzamine, the increased release of noradrenaline combined with alpha-receptor blockade results in a beta-receptor-mediated vasodilatation in the intestinal bed.", 
    "31": "We have investigated the mechanism by which cyclic AMP inhibits PGI2 synthesis in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. Inhibition of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) blocks calcium ionophore-induced PGI2 production by 62%. The addition of 3 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP, alone with IBMX, increases the inhibition to 96%. Release o 3H-arachidonate from membrane phospholipids was inhibited 25% by dibutyryl cyclic AMP, 48% by IBMX, and 76% by isoproterenol plus IBMX. Inhibition by isoproterenol was reversed by 10 micro M propranolol. Release of 3H-arachidonate was also reduced 75% by a combination of 10 micro M PGI2 and 3 mM IBMX. We conclude that hormones like isoproterenol and PGI2 may regulate endothelial cell PGI2 biosynthesis by increasing intracellular cyclic AMP, which then inhibits release of endogenous arachidonate from membrane phospholipids.", 
    "32": "1. Dose-response curves to the relaxant effects of isoprenaline, salbutamol, adrenaline and noradrenaline were determined on the partially contracted smooth muscles of the cat nictitating membrane following alpha-adrenoreceptor blockade in order to test the hypothesis of a causal relationship between the inhibition of neuronal uptake and denervation supersensitivity. 2. Denervation did not produce supersensitivity of the nictitating membrane to the beta-adrenoreceptor-mediated relaxant effects of any of the four agents studied. 3. The sensitivity of the inferior muscle was greater than that of the medial muscle to agents which were good substrates for neuronal uptake (adrenaline and noradrenaline) as well as to those which were not (isoprenaline and salbutamol). 4. Denervation did not alter the antagonist activity of beta-adrenoreceptor blockers propranolol (nonselective) and metoprolol (beta 1-blocker) against isoprenaline or of H 35/25 (beta 2-blocker) against salbutamol. 5. These results do not support the hypothesis of a casual relationship between inhibition of neuronal uptake and supersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines.", 
    "33": "1. The relaxant effects of isoprenaline, salbutamol, adrenaline and noradrenaline on the partially contracted isolated nictitating membrane of the cat were determined in the absence and the presence of alpha-adrenoreceptor blockade. 2. It was possible to demonstrate significant relaxant effects of isoprenaline and salbutamol in the absence as well as in the presence of alpha-adrenoreceptor blockade. However, the relaxant effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline could not be demonstrated in the absence of alpha-adrenoreceptor blockade. 3. Molar concentrations (EC30) of isoprenaline, salbutamol and adrenaline causing 30% relaxation of the tone did not significantly differ from each other; EC30 of each of these agents was significantly less than that of noradrenaline. 4. Beta 1-Adrenoreceptor antagonist metoprolol was less potent than beta 2-antagonist H 35/25 in antagonizing the effect of salbutamol; metoprolol was more potent than H 25/35 in antagonizing noradrenaline. Both these agents were effective antagonists of isoprenaline; however, metoprolol and H 25/35 in combination produced greater antagonism of isoprenaline than did each antagonist separately. 5. It is concluded that the cat nictitating membrane possesses both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoreceptors which are responsible for the relaxant effects of sympathomimetic agents. A study of these receptors is, however, complicated by concomitant stimulation of alpha-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "34": "Isoprenaline and adrenaline produced an increase of cAMP content and a decrease of the activity of the endogenous inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (type I inhibitor) in human lymphocytes and in rat heart. The maximal effect was seen at a concentration of 10(-6) M. Noradrenaline and dopamine required much higher concentration to elicite the same effect. The decrease of type I inhibitor activity was mediated through beta-adrenergic receptors because propranolol, but not phentolamine, blocked the effects produced by isoprenaline. Stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors did not influence the activity of type II inhibitor.", 
    "35": "The effects of the beta-1-adrenoceptor agonist, prenalterol, 20 microgram/kg intravenously on renin secretion rate (RSR), renal haemodynamics and sodium excretion were examined in anaesthetized dogs with innervated or denervated kidneys. In dogs with innervated kidneys, prenalterol increased RSR from 1.1 +/- 0.2 to 7.9 +/- 0.1 units X min.-1 X g-1 (P less than 0.01). Prenalterol did not affect mean arterial pressure, renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate or sodium excretion. Heart rate was increased by 53 +/- 17 beats/min. (P less than 0.01). The increase in RSR produced by prenalterol was independent of intact renal innervation as RSR increased to the same extent in dogs with denervated kidneys. Pretreatment with the beta-1-adrenoceptor antagonist, metoprolol 0.5 mg/kg intravenously, abolished the increase in RSR produced by prenalterol. These findings suggest that prenalterol directly activates renal beta-1-adrenoceptors to increase RSR.", 
    "36": "Isometric exercise causes a substantial rise in BP in normotensive and untreated hypertensives. The authors studied the isometric hand-grip test in 5 groups of treated hypertensives, namely beta-blockers, beta-blockers + diuretics, beta-blockers + diuretics + vasodilators, alpha-methyldopa alone and labetalol. All groups showed a substantial rise in both systolic and diastolic BP, and the increments in BP differed little from that in normotensives. Some patients, despite multiple therapy, achieved increments of up to 60 mmHg from rest. Treated hypertensives with cardiac and cerebro-vascular disease are at risk performance isometric exercise.", 
    "37": "In hydrated, conscious goats nicotine was administered into the 3rd ventricle and its effects on water and electrolyte excretion were studied. Acetylcholine (ACh.) in combination with eserine (Es.) was injected by the same route in goats pretreated with atropine. Nicotine as well as large doses of Ach + Es. induced an antidiuresis of the pituitary type. The responses to ACh. were dose-dependent. Intracerebroventricular (icv.) pretreatment with hexamethonium blocked the responses to both nicotine and ACh., whereas atropine and propranolol were ineffective. It appears likely that nicotine receptors are involved inthe ACh.-induced release of antidiuretic hormone. Phentolamine (icv.) completely blocked the effects of ACh. + Es. and partly those of nicotine, indicating that catecholamines might be involved to some extent.", 
    "38": "Acute ligation of the left coronary artery of rats produced abnormal Q-wave in the electrocardiogram, tachycardia and frequent ventricular fibrillation. Serum CPK level was elevated, reaching a maximum at 3 to 5 hours after ligation and returning to near the pre-ligation level 24 hours later, when CPK activity in the left ventricle markedly decreased. Pretreatment with bucumolol at 2.5 mg/Kg s.c. and 5 mg/Kg s.c. lessened these changes and increased the survival rate in a dose related manner. d-Bucumolol at 5 mg/Kg, on the other hand, increased survival rate primarily by suppressing ventricular fibrillation without any significant effect on other parameters. These results suggest that the membrane stabilizing action does not contribute to protective actions of bucumolol against myocardial ischemia.", 
    "39": "The coronary blood flow and vascular resistance responses to static hindlimb exercise were studied in 11 anesthetized dogs after beta- and combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade to determine if this stress causes coronary vasoconstriction. After beta-blockade static exercise increased the blood pressure and double product, but decreased the right and left ventricular (LV) coronary blood flow and increased the coronary vascular resistance. These vascular changes primarily occurred in the epicardial and mid-myocardial but not the endocardial layers of the LV. Following combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, the systemic hemodynamic and coronary flow and resistance changes were abolished. These data suggest that alpha-adrenergic mediated coronary vasoconstriction occurs during static hindlimb exercise in dogs.", 
    "40": "Beta-blockers, originally introduced into clinical practice for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, are being increasingly advocated in the treatment of diverse neurological and psychiatric conditions. Thus, propranolol and certain other beta-blockers have been shown to be effective, and may be the drugs of choice, in the treatment of benign essential tremor and the prevention of recurrent migraine attacks. These drugs also have a useful role to play in the treatment of anxiety and alcohol withdrawal states, although beta-blockers have not come into general use in these conditions. The action of propranolol and related drugs in these neurological and psychiatric conditions is generally considered to be mediated by blockade of peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors, although other effects, either central or peripheral, may also be involved. The use of beta-blockers in the treatment of psychosis remains controversial. Current evidence does not support the use of propranolol in schizophrenia, but further studies in mania are warranted.", 
    "41": "In six female and male patients taking the specific beta 1-receptor blocking agent talinolol in daily maintenance doses between 100 and 300 mg, the plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) and the amount of excreted radioactivity via urine was evaluated after intake of a single dose of 14C-talinolol (0.88 MBq per 100 mg talinolol), and in the case of one patient with biliary fistula after intravenous injection (1.06 MBq per 10 mg talinolol). In this patient the bile concentration and elimination of radioactivity via bile was studied additionally. In the urine of three healthy volunteers, talinolol metabolites were isolated by TLC. In the six patients, 14C-talinolol was eliminated with a plasma t1/2 of 2.4 and 2.5 h, and a t1/2 of 4.6 via bile. The excretion of radioactivity amounted to 51.19% (intravenous injection), 23.9% (oral intake) in urine, and 7.49% in bile. In a urine fraction of one volunteer m-OH-talinolol was identified besides talinolol. The results indicate a remarkably high hepatic first-pass effect after oral administration of talinolol.", 
    "42": "Liquid-chromatographic procedures were developed to assay the formation of diastereomeric glucuronides of propranolol (PG) and 4'-hydroxypropranolol (HPG) by rat liver microsomes, with identifications performed by GC/MS techniques. Propranolol was conjugated at a rate 10% of that determined for 4'-hydroxypropranolol. Glucuronyltransferase activity increased slightly (10-17%) in the presence of MgCl2. Inclusion of 0.04% Triton X-100 produced a 55% inhibition of PG formation, but increased HPG formation greater than 2-fold. Pretreatment of animals with phenobarbital resulted in a 4-fold increase in PG formation, but did not affect HPG formation unless MgCl2 was also present. Under these conditions, a 50-60% increase in HPG formation occurred. Pretreatment with 3-methylcholanthrene did not affect the formation of either glucuronide. (R)-(+)-Propranolol was glucuronidated 2-fold faster than the (S)-(-) enantiomer at substrate concentrations below 0.1 mM, and 1.3-fold faster at substrate concentrations above 2.0 mM. The estimated Vmax, 0.67 nmol/mg/min, was identical for both enantiomers. The dissociation constants were significantly different, however, being 0.57 mM for (R)-(+)-propranolol and 0.87 mM for (S)-(-)-propranolol. No stereoselectivity was observed in the formation of HPG when 4'-hydroxypropranolol was used as substrate, or when propranolol was incubated in the presence of an NADPH-generating system. Propranolol and 4'-hydroxypropranolol were used as substrate, or when propranolol was incubated in the presence of an NADPH-generating system. Propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol are apparently glucuronidated by different forms of rat liver glucuronyltransferase. Furthermore, propranolol glucuronidation occurs stereoselectively in vitro because of the different enzyme affinities for the enantiomers of the drug.", 
    "43": "1 Simultaneous serum and milk samples were collected over a 10-day period from twelve normotensive, lactating subjects who ingested 80 mg nadolol once daily for a period of 5 days. For comparative purposes, serum samples were also collected from seven patients with a history of mild essential hypertension who ingested the same dose of nadolol for a period of 13 days. 2 In lactating subjects, steady-state serum concentrations of nadolol were attained in 3 days. Milk concentrations of nadolol were much higher than serum concentrations starting on Day 3 and throughout the remainder of the study. The mean (+/- s.e. mean) steady-state levels of nadolol in milk (356.9 +/- 40.4 ng/ml) were 4.6 times higher than the mean steady-state levels in serum (77.3 +/- 6.9 ng/ml). 3 In hypertensive patients, the mean serum concentration of nadolol 24 h after the twelfth dose was 40.3 +/- 8.2 ng/ml as compared to a mean serum concentration in lactating subjects of 40.7 +/- 3.4 ng/ml, 24 h after the fifth dose. Mean serum concentrations in hypertensive patients at 1 and 4 h after the final daily dose were not significantly different from those in lactating subjects. 4 It can be estimated that a 5 kg nursing infant would consume about 2-7% of the daily adult therapeutic dose of nadolol. The data suggest that caution should be exercised in the use of nadolol in lactating patients.", 
    "44": "Ninety-five patients with angina at rest were observed in the coronary care unit. Eighty-one per cent presented concomitantly or had previously presented some other manifestations of coronary artery disease. These patients were divided into two subgroups. In subgroup 1 (40 patients), episodes of non-exertional angina were associated with a pattern of hyperacute subepicardial injury and, frequently, with ventricular arrhythmias. In subgroup 2 (55 patients), the episodes of angina at rest were attended by horizontal ST depression, isolated T wave inversion, or trivial ST-T changes. Coronary angiographic findings were similar in both subgroups. Symptoms regressed in only 9% of patients in subgroup 1 while they were receiving beta-receptor antagonists, whereas amiodarone alone or amiodarone with nifedipine was successful in 58%. Of these patients, 25% developed a myocardial infarction shortly after admission. In subgroup 2 patients, beta-blockers were successful in 61%. Amiodarone isolated or associated with nifedipine was successful in 55% of the patients in whom it was tried. Only 5% of patients in this subgroup developed a myocardial infarction during their hospital stay. It is concluded that: (1) observation of the electrocardiogram during spontaneous angina in patients with known atherosclerotic coronary heart disease may be of prognostic significance and may influence therapeutic decision. (2) Amiodarone by virtue of its anginal and antiarrhythmic properties may be particularly useful in the treatment of non-exertional angina.", 
    "45": "The authors attempted to evaluate through a literature review, lipid and lipoprotein changes induced by anti-hypertensive drugs (especially diuretics and beta-blockers). Generally, these drugs induce a modification of the lipid and lipoprotein profile towards profile atherogenicity by a moderate increase in total cholesterol, a marked increase in triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein triglycerides, and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In theory, these changes could decrease or cancel the reduction in cardio-vascular risk obtained through the antihypertensive treatment but current data do not allow to confirm or disprove this hypothesis. However, it is certain that adherence to a suitable life-style and good dietary habits tend to reduce the associated risk factors and compensates, at least in part, for the effects of hypotensive drugs on the lipids and lipoproteins.", 
    "46": "The effect of propranolol (non specific blocking agent), acebutolol (beta 1 blocking agent), butoxamine (beta 2 blocking agent) and several beta adrenergic agonists was studied on 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation and granulo-monocyte colony formation in agar by human bone marrow. Only butoxamine and propranolol decreased 3H-TdR incorporation by total normal bone marrow cells at concentrations above 10(-6) M for butoxamine and 10(-5) M for propranolol. Autoradiography showed that inhibition of 3H-TdR incorporation by butoxamine was slightly more pronounced on neutrophil precursors than on red cell precursors (neutrophil series LI..53 and erythroblasts .67 compared to control bone marrow cells at 10(-5) M concentration). The development of granulo-monocyte colonies in agar culture was delayed by preincubation with butoxamine at concentrations above 5 X 10(-6) M. Hydroxyurea suicide showed that this was due to a decrease in the number of CFU-C in S phase. beta 2 blocking agents are able to decrease the number of normal hematopoietic cells entering S phase. This effect is seen on both neutrophil and erythroblastic precursors and on granulo-monocyte progenitors. It could be used as a means of protecting bone marrow cells during cancer intensive chemotherapy.", 
    "47": "The abrupt cessation of antihypertensive medication is usually without immediate consequence but may be associated with symptoms and signs of enhanced sympathetic activity, severe hypertension, morbid ischemic cardiovascular events, or death. This syndrome is more common after discontinuation of high doses of centrally acting antiadrenergic and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs or combination antihypertensive therapy, but it also occurs with numerous antihypertensive agents. Predisposing factors include ischemic heart disease, severe hypertension, renovascular or high renin hypertension, and high doses of multiple antihypertensive drugs. Gradual tapering of antihypertensive medications over seven to ten days will prevent symptoms and marked elevation of blood pressure. Should a discontinuation syndrome develop, re-administration of the drug previously discontinued is the most appropriate treatment.", 
    "48": "The effect of epinephrine on basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in perfused hindlimbs of fed rats was studied. Insulin increased glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner from a basal value of 1.5+/-0.3 up to a maximum value of 5.3+/-0.9 mumol/min per 100 g with 6 nM (1 m U/ml). Epinephrine at 10 nM and 0.1 muM also increased glucose uptake to 2.6+/-0.1 and 3.1+/-0.1 mumol/min per 100 g, respectively. These same concentrations of epinephrine, however, suppressed the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake to 3.2+/-0.3 mumol/min per 100 g. Both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of epinephrine on glucose uptake were completely reversed by propranolol, but were not significantly altered by phentolamine. Uptake of 3-O-methylglucose and 2-deoxyglucose into thigh muscles of the perfused hindlimbs was stimulated fivefold by insulin, but was unaffected by epinephrine. Epinephrine also did not inhibit the stimulation of uptake by insulin. Epinephrine decreased the phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose, however, and caused the intracellular accumulation of free glucose. These last two effects were more prominent in the presence of insulin. Whereas epinephrine caused large rises in glucose-6-P and fructose-6-P, insulin did not alter the concentration of these metabolites either in the absence or presence of epinephrine.THESE DATA INDICATE THAT: (a) epinephrine has a stimulatory effect on glucose uptake by perfused rat hindlimbs that does not appear to be exerted on skeletal muscle; (b) epinephrine does not affect hexose transport in skeletal muscle; (c) epinephrine inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle by inhibiting glucose phosphorylation. It is hypothesized that the inhibition of glucose phosphorylation is due to the stimulation of glycogenolysis, which leads to the accumulation of hexose phosphates, which inhibit hexokinase.", 
    "49": "Six normal subjects were studied after graded bolus injections of isoproterenol. Log dose-response curves for increases in both heart rate (mostly beta 1), and amplitude of physiologic tremor (beta 2) were constructed for each subject in the control state and 2 hr after 10 or 40 mg propranolol, 200 mg sotalol, or placebo. All heart rate curves were shifted to the right in an approximately parallel fashion by all active treatments (40 mg propranolol greater than 200 mg sotalol greater than 10 mg propranolol). The tremor curve was also shifted to the right by 10 mg propranolol in an approximately parallel fashion and to the same extent as the heart rate curve (both dose-ratios = 6.1), but the tremor curves after both 40 mg propranolol and 200 mg sotalol appeared to be flattened as well as shifted laterally. We conclude that whereas it may be possible that 10 mg propranolol acts as a competitive antagonist of isoproterenol at beta 2-sites in skeletal muscle, 40 mg propranolol and 200 mg sotalol must have additional actions in reducing isoproterenol tremor. The possibilities are discussed.", 
    "50": "Our subjects were seven severely hypertensive patients with blood pressures (BPs) over 140/90 who were using minoxidil, propranolol, and diuretics. Clonidine followed by prazosin was added to their regimen on an outpatient basis to establish the dose-response for BP and catecholamines. Plasma renin activity (PRA), body weight, and renal function were measured. Clonidine was given in doses of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/day. Supine and standing systolic BP decreased at all dose levels of clonidine (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.05). Diastolic BP decreased in the standing position with doses of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.05). Subjects were hypernoradrenergic initially with plasma norepinephrine (PNE) 895 +/- 122 pg/ml. PNE was suppressed by 0.2 to 0.8 mg clonidine (P less than 0.01) with near maximal suppression at 0.4 mg daily. Systolic BP correlated with PNE (r = 0.59, P less than 0.001). Supine and standing PRA decreased after 0.2 mg clonidine (P less than 0.05) but not after higher doses. Our findings suggest the antihypertensive action of clonidine is related to PNE suppression but not to that of PRA. Plasma epinephrine (PE), body weight, and renal function did not change. Prazosin was given after clonidine to the same patients in a dose range of 3 to 40 mg/day. With doses of 6 to 40 mg, systolic and diastolic and supine and standing BP fell (P less than 0.001, P less than 0.01). PNE remained elevated throughout all dose levels and did not correlate with BP. Weight rose with prazosin (P less than 0.02) but PE, PRA, and renal function did not change. Hence, clonidine and prazosin induced additional lowering of BP but had different effects of PNE and weight.", 
    "51": "Each of seven subjects received on a weekly basis placebo or 10, 20, 40, 80, or 160 mg propranolol orally four times daily. The effect of propranolol on the resting heart rate and the heart rate responses to the Valsalva maneuver, tilt, isoproterenol, and maximal exercise were measured. Coefficients of determination were calculated from the individual dose-response curves. The results indicate that the resting heart rate and the tachycardiac response to the Valsalva maneuver and tilt cannot be used to estimate beta blockade. Propranolol concentrations correlated well (mean r2 = 0.80) with the isoproterenol dose ration minus one, but isoproterenon challenges appear clinically inapplicable. Reduction in maximal exercise tachycardia correlated best with propranolol concentrations (mean r2 = 0.89) but, to the extent that exercise could not be performed, there was no reliable way of clinically documenting beta blockade and only the serum concentration of propranolol was available as an indicator of appropriate therapy.", 
    "52": "One hundred one patients with unstable angina were treated conservatively without the routine use of beta receptor blocking agents, calcium antagonist drugs, anticoagulant agents or nitrates. Only two patients underwent arteriography and coronary arterial bypass surgery during hospitalization and one patient during the 1st year of follow-up study. The 28 day mortality rate was 4 percent and the total 1 year cardiac mortality rate 10 percent. Two patients died from carcinoma. The incidence rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction was 9 percent during the first 28 days and a further 3 percent for the 1st year. These results compare favorably with the immediate and 1 year prognosis reported from other studies using different treatment procedures, including modern intensive drug treatment and coronary arterial bypass surgery. Various factors studied during the acute stage of unstable angina were assessed in an effort to predict the immediate and long-term outcome. Only persistence of pain after admission to the hospital was found a significant indicator of an adverse prognosis. Modern medical treatment of unstable angina with beta receptor blocking agents, calcium antagonist drugs, anticoagulant agents, nitrates and antiarrhythmic agents is critically examined. The paucity of proper randomized controlled studies confirming the value of medication is underlined. There is little evidence to show that aggressive or intensive medical or surgical treatment is superior to a conservative approach to management in the coronary care unit. This approach includes bed rest until the pain has resolved, symptomatic drug treatment only, the minimal use of invasive investigations and careful risk factor intervention.", 
    "53": "Multiple injections of dobutamine, a selective adrenergic beta-1 receptor agonist, or isoproterenol, a nonselective beta receptor agonist, produced significant dose-dependent enlargement of the submandibular glands of male rats. The glandular enlargement induced by dobutamine or isoproterenol was characterized by significant increases in glandular protein and nucleic acid content and a marked increase in the RNA/DNA ratio. Metoprolol, a selective beta-1 receptor antagonist, significantly inhibited the glandular enlargement induced by dobutamine or isoproterenol and produced a parallel shift in the isoproterenol dose-response curve. Metoprolol also inhibited the increased protein and nucleic acid content induced by dobutamine or isoproterenol. Multiple injections of selective adrenergic beta-2 receptor agonists, terbutaline, fenoterol or salmefamole, failed to produce submandibular gland enlargement. These results indicate that adrenergic beta-1 receptors mediate submandibular gland hypertrophy in the rat.", 
    "54": "Studies of mononuclear leukocytes from patients with atopic dermatitis showed depressed cyclic AMP (cAMP) responses after exposure to isoproterenol, histamine, and prostaglandin E1. Because plasma and tissue histamine levels are elevated in atopic dermatitis, we questioned whether histamine or other mediators might be responsible for cAMP abnormalities. We found that exposure of normal cells to low (10(-6)M) concentrations of histamine, isoproterenol, or prostaglandin E desensitized the cells to subsequent stimulatory concentrations of any of the agonists. This heterologous desensitization occurred within 15 min and persisted for days, with gradual recovery of cAMP responses roughly paralleling those of cells from patients with atopic dermatitis. These findings provide a possible explanation for Szentivanyi's beta adrenergic blockade theory and the depressed leukocyte cAMP response to multiple agonists in atopy.", 
    "55": "In order to assess the effects of increasing myocardial metabolic demand on the large epicardial coronary arteries, we measured left circumflex coronary artery diameter (ultrasonic transit time technique) and blood flow in conscious dogs with chronically implanted transducers. Myocardial oxygen consumption was increased by pacing-induced tachycardia and aortic constriction, and monitored by multiplying left circumflex coronary arterial blood flow by coronary arterio-venous oxygen content difference. Increase of heart rate by 90 beats/min caused myocardial oxygen consumption to increase by 34 +/- 4.3% (1 SEM); coronary blood flow at constant arterial pressure to increase by 32 +/- 6.8%; and coronary diameter to increase by 0.07 +/- 0.01 mm, P less than 0.01. Aortic constriction, producing a 53 +/- 5.1% increase of left ventricular systolic pressure, caused myocardial oxygen consumption to increase by 49 +/- 7.2%, coronary blood flow to increase by 50 +/- 6.0%, and coronary diameter to increase 0.03 mm, P less than 0.01. The increases in coronary artery diameter were gradual, not immediate, in onset and not altered by beta-adrenergic blockade. Thus, increased myocardial metabolic demand dilates large epicardial coronary arteries, but with a slower response time than the rapid dilation of the smaller resistance vessels.", 
    "56": "A radioimmunoassay for the direct measurement of carteolol, a new beta-adrenoreceptor blocker, in human plasma was developed. Carteolol was acylated to form O-glutarylcarteolol, which was conjugated to bovine serum albumin to provide the immunogen. Antibody to carteolol was raised in New Zealand albino rabbits. The tracer was the radioiodinated derivative of O-glutarylcarteolol-tyrosine methyl ester conjugate. The method is highly sensitive, with a lower quantifiable concentration of approximately 0.4 ng of carteolol/ml using 0.1 ml of plasma, and has good specificity, with the major metabolite (8-hydroxycarteolol) showing only 0.2% cross-reactivity. It is reproducible, with relative standard deviations from triplicate standard curves being mostly within +/- 8%. The method is currently being used to monitor carteolol levels in clinical samples.", 
    "57": "Observed venous plasma concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, griseofulvin, and theophylline at 0.33 and 0.66 min after intravenous bolus injections to unanesthetized dogs were compared with those extrapolated using the instantaneous input hypothesis. At 0.33 min, extrapolated/observed plasma level ratios as high as 20.5, 65.5, 226, and 1.17 were found for these four drugs, respectively. Venous plasma levels peaked at 1 min postinjection in all studies. Total plasma areas (AUC0-->infinity) estimated using the instantaneous input principle were higher by as much as 6.0, 6.8, and 19.6% for propranolol, griseofulvin, and furosemide, respectively, when compared with experimental data. The effect on theophylline was negligible. These results suggest the need for cautious interpretation of some venous pharmacokinetic data. More studies in animals and humans are required to assess the magnitude of deviation from the instantaneous input hypothesis for drugs in general.", 
    "58": "An assay is described for the simultaneous determination of propranolol and its active metabolite, 4-hydroxypropranolol, in human plasma. Both compounds were separated from an ethereal extract by high-performance liquid chromatography employing a C18 bonded-phase column. Detection of the effluent was by fluorescence. Suitable fluorescent spectrometers and wavelength settings that allow optimum detection of both compounds have been described. The limit of sensitivity was 2 ng/ml for both propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol. Mean peak plasma levels of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol in six patients receiving a single dose of a slow-release 160-mg formulation of propranolol were 28 and 6 ng/ml, respectively. These levels were about one-tenth the level obtained following a single conventionally prepared dose of propranolol (160 mg). Peak levels were delayed and plasma levels of propranolol persisted for a longer period with the slow-release formulation. Area under the curve estimates suggested that the bioavailability of the slow-release formulation following single-dose administration was about one-third that of the conventional preparation."
